They followed McGonagall up the stairs, immediately breaking into whispered conversation. Whether the other students were more excited or apprehensive, Draco couldn’t tell. Once they had reached the third floor, McGonagall guided them to a large wooden door flanked by the stone bust of a very old, square-jawed wizard.
They locked eyes and Draco’s heart stuttered. For a brief moment, Potter smiled, and like a reflex, Draco smiled back, just a little.
“I swear to all the gods in this world, Potter, if you say that it isn’t working
“I think it’s a great idea,” Potter answered, and something in his voice made Draco wonder if maybe he understood exactly why Draco wanted to make this potion. “Amazing, actually.”
Potter didn’t answer. Unable to handle the weight of the Gryffindor’s stare, Draco pushed himself up from the floor, brushing a few stray bits of Mandrake root off his trousers as he stood.
Draco wanted to say something, anything, to alleviate the stiff discomfort that seemed to have crept back between them overnight. But what could he say? Even as they turned in the description of their project and the details of their preliminary experiments to Professor Slughorn, Potter held himself at an exaggerated distance, unusually rigid in his posture and stubborn in his forward-facing gaze, studiously avoiding Draco’s frequent glances. His cursory pleasantries sounded brittle, to the point that even Slughorn seemed to notice something was off, and he was out the door of the classroom before Draco could even try to stop him.
“Th-that’s—that is beside the point, Potter,” Draco stuttered. “Slughorn is going to want to hear from both of us soon enough, and it’ll be my neck on the line if you look incompetent.”
There was a familiar glint in Potter’s eyes: it was the look he wore when he was seconds away from stealing the Snitch out from under Draco’s grasp; the look he wore moments before aiming a jinx; the undeniable look of someone who not only refused to back down but who knew they would triumph. It made Draco shiver.
“It’s not,” Potter said. His brows were slightly furrowed as he looked at Pansy, like he too sensed this wasn’t just a simple discussion of their preferred subjects. “I didn’t use to like it much at all. But…” He glanced at Draco. “Recently I’ve started to realize it’s not so bad.”
Potter chewed his lip, not meeting Draco’s gaze. “Honestly, I didn’t really think about it before. But now that I have…” He took a deep breath. “If our potion works, I don’t want to use it on myself. I don’t want to get rid of any of my scars.”
“You came before then?” Draco’s brow furrowed. “But you weren’t a Prefect.”
“No, of course not,” Draco dismissed the ludicrous suggestion with a small shake of his head. “We’ll have to test it on ourselves now.”
Draco turned the phrase over in his mind, wondering what it could mean.
“Er…” Potter ran a distracted hand through his already untidy hair, making it stand on end. “I’m not sure, Professor. I don’t really know if I want to take on something like that. I’m just trying to get through my N.E.W.T.s.”
“I think it best that you leave now, Mr. Potter.” Although she didn’t so much as look at the Gryffindor when she spoke, her tone left no room for debate. Draco felt a stab of disappointment.
“You tested that potion on your arm a couple of weeks ago,” Draco reminded him, his eyebrows raised. “On that Basilisk scar. How was that any different?”
“Yeah.” Potter gave a small smile. “All the time.”
” another voice insisted. “Just yesterday he took a turn down a staircase that I happen to know leads to a dead end, just to avoid me!”
Slughorn’s smile fell. The sinking feeling in Draco’s stomach returned.
Draco shifted his focus to his own bed, determined not to think on it any longer. He rifled through the stacks of neatly folded clothes in his trunk until he found his pyjamas. They were the black silk ones he always wore, his favourites. Yet for some reason as he pulled them on and his gaze landed on the delicate emerald green trim, Draco felt a strange flicker of displeasure.
He glanced over at Potter, who was sitting cross-legged on the edge of the massive sunken tub, watching it slowly fill with water. “There’s no bubble bath in that tap, is there?”
, repeating it in an endless and unproductive litany. “We should—we should keep working, though. We might be able to come up with something before then.”
“Ron, don’t…”.
supportive. Always. You know that.” Pansy’s long hair tickled the inside of his arm and Draco absentmindedly twirled a lock of it around his finger, still staring at the ceiling.  “But I also know you. I’m not going to let you overthink this too much. It is what it is, Draco, it’s who you are, and there’s nothing wrong with that, end of story.”
, and although he had been the one to ask, he wasn’t so sure anymore that he wanted to hear the answer.
?” Draco demanded.
At Draco’s suggestion, they stopped at the bookshop, where Draco became so engrossed perusing a copy of
Potter seemed to understand the unspoken meaning behind his words. He hesitated slightly, then said, “Those memories, at the manor…”
“It’s not working,” Potter repeated after two minutes had passed.
When they weren’t alone, and reality encroached around them, the truth of it shrank. Under the judgmental eyes of his peers, all the reasons why he couldn’t like Potter and shouldn’t like Potter came crashing back.
“Sure,” Draco said, smirking, and he could see how Potter’s eyes flickered down to his lips, just briefly. “Or maybe you were just looking for an excuse to press me up against a wall.”
He inhaled deeply, the air in his lungs painful. His voice was too loud in the empty corridor. Potter’s hand was still on his arm, somewhere near his elbow, and he used the light grasp to pull Draco towards an empty classroom, closing them inside.
He wasn’t aware of moving, but a moment later his arms were around Potter, too excited to even think twice about the gesture. Potter was laughing, the sound giddy, like he couldn’t quite believe it. Draco couldn’t quite believe it either. He had tried to remain optimistic, though it wasn’t in his nature; at the very least, he had always remained determined. But some part of him had feared that it was impossible, and that in the end all their efforts might end up being for nothing.
A moment later, to Draco’s great relief and even greater confusion, he heard Potter and Weasley’s footsteps retreat in the opposite direction. He remained frozen against the bookshelf a moment longer, blood still pounding with adrenaline. Potter had seen him, Draco had no doubts about it, and more than that, he was sure that Potter had recognized him. So why, then, had Potter acted like he hadn’t? Was he that desperate to avoid talking to Draco?
“Family loyalty doesn’t mean a whole lot to owls, I don’t think.”
Vaguely panicked, still all too conscious of their nudity, Draco tried to flee from his unexpected approach, but his back was already pressed against the smooth tiles of the sunken pool. The best he could do was sidestep towards the corner, where his retreat was quickly hindered by a narrow ledge at about hip height under the water, a sort of seat that ran the length of one side of the tub.
Potter swore and scrambled for his wand, careful to avoid touching any of the spilled liquid as he quickly vanished the potion and came to kneel at Draco’s side, his face lined with worry.
Draco, who had been in the middle of trying to cast a very casual and definitely not practiced glance across the Great Hall to where a certain Gryffindor sat eating his breakfast, forced himself to focus his attention on his best friend.
Draco breathed a silent sigh of relief. At one point in his life, detention might have seemed like the worst punishment imaginable, but now, it sounded like a gift. Maybe Miranda McKinnon had harboured some malicious intent when she pointed her wand at him; maybe she hated him for being a Death Eater and had wanted to watch him suffer. Or maybe she was just a scared little girl who had seen and endured far too much and was simply trying to do what she thought was right. It didn’t matter. Maybe it wasn’t much, but Draco couldn’t stand to think that he was the reason for any more punishment.
It was a ridiculous thing to complain about, since Draco had practically begged Potter to help him; obviously he had been hoping Potter would agree. But now that had said yes, and after the way he had looked at Draco—the way he was looking at Draco so often nowadays—the Slytherin couldn’t stop thinking that none of it made sense. He was the last person Potter should be doing anything for.
Draco was nervous; he had been nervous ever since he first made the suggestion two days ago. But now as he left the common room, the anxiety seemed to increase with every step he took. Somewhere around the fourth floor, he began to feel like he might be sick. By the time he reached the fifth, the nerves had almost gotten the better of him, and he might have contemplated just turning around and forgetting the whole thing had Potter not already spotted him.
“Sorry to keep you boys from your lunch,” Slughorn said, his chair groaning in protest as he sat. “This won’t take long. I only wanted to make you aware of an opportunity open to our N.E.W.T.-level students. I take it you both read
But in the end, his anxiety had proved to be unfounded. The next day, Potter had smiled at him in the hallway before class, small but meaningful. Then, halfway through Transfiguration, he had passed Draco a note asking if he wanted to work on their potion that night after dinner, smiling again when Draco replied back with a simple scrawled yes.
“Right.” Potter hitched his bag higher up on shoulder, turning away. “Thanks, Professor.”
Ashamed, Draco shook the thoughts away and forced himself to raise his gaze. Despite how vehemently he had been arguing with Pansy only moments ago, Potter looked calm now, although the green of his eyes was darkened by an emotion Draco couldn’t identify.
“You didn’t come when you were Quidditch captain?”
Potter, it would seem, was not satisfied with this answer. “That’s not it,” he said, shaking his head. “You hate me, Malfoy. You wouldn’t come asking me for help if it were just about the prestige.”
Potter leaned forward so that his elbows were resting on his knees, his expression expectant. Draco knew he should say something, anything, but his mouth was far too dry, and he was horrified to realize that, beneath the blankets, he was hard.
Draco swallowed. His unconscious had replicated the reality with astounding accuracy.
“I have a very good feeling about this,” Slughorn went on, too wrapped up in his own excitement to pay any real mind to what his students had said. He seemed to be talking almost to himself now, a faraway gleam in his eye. "Obviously, there’s no way to be certain, but with your combined talent, and coming from the Chosen One no less… yes, I think the odds are very good.”
was the kind of honour he’d only ever dreamt of; obviously this was an opportunity he could not pass up. And yet...
And if the constant physical pain, crushing boredom, and unspeakable vulnerability of having to depend on other people were not enough, Draco was also forced to deal with the mental torment induced by his last encounter with Potter. Memories of what could only be described as their almost-kiss plagued his every waking thought. Sleep, unfortunately, was no safer: his brain seemed determined to cast Potter as the leading role in every one of his fantasies, no matter how much Draco wished otherwise.
Potter bit his lip. “Maybe I should say something—”
“Thought what?” He held his breath, almost afraid of what Potter was about to say.
“My Transfiguration notes are missing,” she said, looking agitated as she began to empty out her bag, still apparently unable to find what she was looking for. Although the statement seemed to have been directed at Potter and Weasley, neither of them replied. “I don’t know what could have happened to them. Harry, can I borrow yours?”
your tie purple?” Blaise finally asked once Slughorn had settled behind his desk, leaving the class to follow the complex set of instructions written on the blackboard. “And more importantly, why is our entire bloody dormitory purple?”
The only good thing about being watched was that it made it easier for Draco to justify how much he watched Potter in return. He would steal glances in class and across the Great Hall, and in those moments when Potter was busy stirring and Draco was ostensibly taking notes, he would catalogue the curls of hair around Potter’s ears, the way he sometimes bit his lip as he worked, and the dark bruise of the circles under his eyes that never seemed to fade.
Slughorn gave a small start. He had clearly thought that Draco had already left.
“Malfoy…” Draco could feel the warmth of his uneven breath. Draco knew that he wanted to say something more, probably to try and drag them back towards a conversation that Draco wasn’t ready for. But if Potter said
Draco said nothing as Potter left. The pain in his side was beginning to recede, replaced by a heavy, drowsy feeling. It might have been his imagination, but the scent of spice and cedarwood seemed to linger.
Distractedly, Draco began stripping off his school robes, grabbing his towel with the idea that maybe a long, hot shower would help him clear his head. Pansy’s comments had only served to stir his confusion. What had she been insinuating, anyway, telling him those things about Potter? Why would she think Draco would be interested? Pansy loved gossip, she always had, and over the years Draco had often joined her in sharing malicious accusations and unconfirmed rumours, especially about Potter. Yet this time seemed different, somehow. Why had she brought it up like that, so seemingly out of the blue?
“Er, sorry?”
Draco was still holding Potter’s note crushed in his fist. The real implication behind Potter’s words was clear to him, if to no one else: he was not taking no for an answer. Draco could refuse, deflect the petty challenge as easily as he had crumpled the piece of parchment, but Potter wasn’t going to let it go.  One way or another, they would talk.
“So, then what do we do now?”
That couldn’t be right, Draco thought. Surely, in all the years they had known each other, there must have been at least one time that Potter had seen him laugh. But maybe it was true; maybe Potter had never seen this side of him, laughter without malice or mockery. Maybe they had always known too much of the anger in each other and too little of the joy.
“You know…” Draco willed him to stop, knowing that it could lead nowhere good, but his silent plea went unanswered as Potter continued, “You could probably come meet him sometime. I think Andromeda would like that.”
“Malfoy,” Potter said, and Draco wished he wouldn’t say his name like that, all soft and rounded at the edges, warm like the light of the fire reflecting on his glasses, almost as if he was glad to see Draco standing there. It was too much, too obvious. “What…?”
Draco tried not feel bothered by any of the other eighth years who cast them curious or confused glances when they saw him and Pansy sitting near the Gryffindors in the common room. Tried to tell himself that he had handled much worse staring, that if Potter wasn’t worried about what other people thought, then he didn’t need to be either. Potter could make his own choices about whether he wanted to be seen with Draco. And Draco couldn’t live his whole life cowering under the scrutiny of others. At least, that’s what he told himself.
“Why not?” The question sounded almost like an accusation.
Of course Draco was interested. Being published in
Slughorn sighed, setting the quill back down. “Mr. Malfoy,” he seemed to be choosing his words carefully, “Though you may have been cleared of all charges at your trial and granted significant clemency in your return to Hogwarts, I cannot pretend that any submission attached to your name alone would make it very far.”
He just needed more time. More time to figure out their potion; more time to figure out how he felt. Until then, Draco was doing his best to keep their increasingly complicated relationship — was it even a relationship? a friendship? something less definable? — a secret. The number of times he caught himself staring at Potter while lost in thought was perhaps not anywhere within the realm of plausibly platonic, but overall, he’d thought he was doing a pretty good job. Despite the risks they sometimes took, no one seemed to suspect anything was going on between them, least of all that they were getting each other off in empty classrooms.
Draco rolled his eyes. He had never found the Weasel to be very bright, but these accusations seemed particularly unfounded – he had not done anything even remotely suspicious for at least a few months now, and certainly not since coming back to Hogwarts.
“Seeing as Mr. Potter was the first to rush to your aid,” McGonagall looked over at the Gryffindor, who was picking at his nails, “I think I can presume that was not the case.”
“Will you tell me sometime?” His voice did not sound like his own. When those green eyes fixed on him, bright with surprise, his breath caught in his throat.
“Like the size of a bathtub.”
“Look, he’s saved my life more times than he should. And somehow, he’s
an irritating voice in the back of his mind whispered.
In his dreams, nobody stopped him.
“You needed
“Good gods, no,” Draco answered. It was peculiar, but he could have sworn Potter looked relieved. “Why, are you interested? Looking to dabble with a Slytherin now that the Weasel girl has left you?”
“Me?” he asked dumbly. “Er… are you sure, sir? Hermione is much better at Potions than I am…”
Draco was at a loss. He looked to Blaise, but the dark-skinned boy merely shrugged and directed his attention to his scrambled eggs. Goyle had an expression of mild panic on his face—he had never been good at dealing with other peoples’ emotions.
He was going to have to ask Potter for a favour.
He knew he shouldn’t ask, shouldn’t even care really, but his mouth was quicker than his judgment. “Why did you break up?” He couldn’t help but think of the rumours that Pansy had told him, of Potter’s
Flustered, he parted his legs, trying to move them away from all the places on Potter’s body that were far too close, and yet somehow not close enough. He saw his mistake almost instantly as Potter stepped forward into the open space between Draco’s knees, as far as the ledge would allow him to go. His hand slid from where Draco still held it loosely against his chest, up to the space just beneath Draco’s jaw, right over the pounding of his pulse.
He tried to focus through Arithmancy, which as a general rule was too demanding of a subject to allow for any distractions, but last period Charms was a different story. Potter was already sitting towards the front of the room with his friends by the time Draco arrived, which meant speaking before class was out of the question. Instead, Draco tuned out Flitwick’s review of combination nonverbal spells in favour of staring at the back of Potter’s head as if that bird’s nest of black hair might give him some sort of insight. What was the best way to convince Potter to help him? Should he appeal to Potter’s saviour complex? Should he offer to help him study in return? Potter had said he wanted to focus on his N.E.W.T.s, and Merlin knew he wasn’t the bookish type. Would that be enough?
Draco nodded in agreement. Little though he liked the Muggle-born girl, no one could deny she was skilled. Not as good as Draco when it came to Potions, of course, but talented enough, and certainly more so than Potter.
Draco was getting very tired of being told what he could and could not do. “I didn’t promise that I would
“This is it.” One of the bottles he was holding fell from his grasp as he took the Murtlap tentacles from Potter, rolling across the floor and out of sight. Draco paid it no attention. All he could do was stare in awe at the wriggling tentacles through the midnight tint of the bottle’s glass, mind reeling with the thought that this was it, the final missing piece for their potion, it
“Whatever you’re thinking, it wasn’t like that!” Potter insisted, cheeks red. “He didn’t invite me to go
“This is ridiculous,” Draco muttered, finally daring to look at Potter now that they were both mostly hidden beneath the potion-darkened water.
“More than you’re capable of, I’m sure. But that’s not saying very much is it?” Draco drawled, a hint of a smirk on his lips. “Considering you can’t even cast the simplest of charms without it blowing up in your face.”
Draco raised an eyebrow. “What, you mean Finnigan harassing me?”
He clung to the memory, replaying it in his mind over and over again, so that when sleep finally found him, it continued even into his dreams.
Any lingering worry Draco might have had that Potter was going to back out on him vanished two days later when Slughorn once again called them up to his desk at the end of Potions class. Judging by the satisfied smile on the Professor’s face as they approached, Draco knew Potter must have already spoken with him. He took care to stand a deliberate distance away from Potter, unable to forget what Pansy had told him.
“What if I want to help with the work?” Potter asked, pushing his hair back from his face. He looked slightly flushed, probably from running up the stairs.
“And here I was hoping that you were gone for good.”
Within minutes, the ground was speckled with raindrops. Without speaking, they both quickened their pace, trying to outrun the inescapable. They made it almost to the edge of the village before the sky opened up on them, pouring down in a heavy sheet, unable to be contained any longer.
It wasn’t the same as the shift that had happened between Draco and Potter in private, one that still made Draco dizzy at times. It was subtler, not quite a reversal of years of enmity. But it was enough that other people started to take notice.
Draco shook his head.
“I know.” Potter forced a smile. “But it’s fine, really. Don’t worry about me.”
Draco felt an instant surge of regret. Potter was doing him a favour, after all; it would be wrong to leave it on such a sour note.
“Don’t flatter yourself,” Draco sneered. “As I heard it, even the Weasel knows that
Pansy sighed, flipping her long hair over her shoulder as she stood. “Fine, fine, whatever you say.”
Weasley seemed on the brink of a retort but was interrupted by the loud bang of the dungeon door hitting the wall. An irate-looking Slughorn appeared, his voice forcedly cheerful as he ushered his students inside. Apparently, everyone had been too focused on Draco and Potter’s confrontation to heed the bell signalling the start of class.
As she smothered him with a hug, Draco felt a throb of pain through his ribcage, but he ignored it, allowing her a moment to fuss.
Potter looked a bit sheepish as he glanced down at the water. “I didn’t,” he admitted. “I just picked it because it looked bigger than the other taps, and when I gave it a try, the water came out clear. I guess I just—”
“Right, now that we’ve solved all that, can we go eat?”
“Dark creature injuries, huh?” Potter leaned over the cauldron. The potion was no longer boiling, but it was still warm enough that tendrils of steam curled from the surface. Potter reached for the set of silver brewing tools that Draco had laid out earlier, selecting a shorter stirring rod that ended in a shallow spoon. “May I?” He gestured towards the potion.
Draco stared. “Like a
Potter’s expression was so determined and so earnest that Draco almost gave in. If there was one thing he loved, it was talking about potions, especially his own experimentations, and on some level he thought it might actually be of use to have Potter’s help, if only to have someone to listen and bounce his ideas off of. But his suspicion ran too deep, and Potter’s responses were far too lacking for Draco to even begin to believe he had spontaneously developed a passion for the subject.
There was something in the teasing way that Potter spoke, a subtle suggestiveness almost, that Draco didn’t care to think too much about. He could only hope that the flush on his cheeks had not begun to creep down the back of his neck, where Potter would surely notice it. “I thought you didn’t want to test the potion on yourself. I thought you were
“It’s not that they don’t do
Draco waited, expecting him to say more, but nothing else came. Potter was watching him carefully, much calmer than Draco felt. Unbidden, an image came to his mind of a cupboard under a staircase, crowded with shabby bedding and decorated with cobwebs; he saw the red-faced man slamming the door and heard the click of a lock. A sick feeling tugged at Draco’s gut.
It was Halloween night when it finally happened.
Potter grinned. “That does happen, occasionally.”
He stopped, not knowing where that sentence ended, or where it began.
Draco was now thoroughly irritated. “Is there anything else you’d like to hold over me?” he snapped. “Because if not, I’d like to get to dinner, I’m supposed to meet—”
Draco froze. He knew immediately which day Potter was referring to. It was the first time that either of them had ever mentioned the trial; Draco had never dared to bring it up.
“If I’m published in
The soft sound of the bathroom door as he pushed it open seemed loud in the early morning quiet. It was almost like déjà vu, finding that he wasn’t alone. Just like the last time, Potter sat with his back against the wall across from the sinks, arms wrapped loosely around his knees. The last time the two of them had been here, Draco had stared at him in the mirror, frozen in a moment of understanding that neither of them knew what to do with.
Draco could still sense that green gaze all around him, watching his every move. The dormitory seemed designed to mock him. The tapestries draping the walls, the bed hangings, the pillows, even the carpets — it was all green. In the seven years he had been at Hogwarts, it had never bothered him. In fact, he had always quite liked the colour. His bedroom at the family manor in Wiltshire was a riot of green. But now, lying in his bed remembering that cold morning in the Ministry courtroom, the colour felt like an oppressive weight under which he could hardly breathe. Another moment of it and Draco thought he might go insane.
“If you’re not going to eat it, Draco, just leave it alone!”
“It wasn’t cheating, exactly,” Potter defended. “I had a second-hand textbook that had all kinds of notes written in it, about the ingredients and how to brew the potions and stuff, and it was really helpful. I didn’t know back then, but it was actually Snape’s old book, from when he was a student.”
Potter answered slowly, as if searching for the right words. “My scars… they’re sort of like my history. They’re not exactly great memories, but…” Almost unconsciously, he reached up to touch a spot on his chest as he spoke. Draco wondered what kind of scar must be hidden there, just below the collar of his shirt. Knowing Potter, it was probably from some great heroic feat. “Getting rid of them feels almost like forgetting. And I don’t want to forget. I don’t want to erase the past, not after everything that’s happened.”
to be. “This is exactly what we need, I’m sure of it.”
“It is working, the potion is just absorbing too quickly.” He traced his finger along the ridge of scar tissue at the centre of the synthetic skin, drawing Potter’s attention to the jagged edges. “See here? The edges are beginning to smooth—that means it’s working. We just have to reapply it.”
“Or… I guess not.” Blaise sounded confused. Draco watched through lowered lashes as Potter wavered near the end of the Ravenclaw table, too distant for Draco to read his expression, then made an awkward turn to leave the hall instead. Once he was out of sight, Draco breathed a sigh of relief.
“Well you’re both being idiots then! But in any case, you really don’t have to—”
Draco was out of bed in seconds, throwing on his clothes with uncharacteristic haste. Ignoring whatever question Blaise was in the middle of asking him, he snatched up his book bag and sprinted out the door, very nearly tripping when he reached the stairs. They had double Potions first period and Draco was accustomed to being much closer to the dungeons; he had forgotten that their new common room was on the third floor.
Potter snorted. “Yourself included, I assume?”
Potter’s fingers stilled at the centre of Draco’s chest, right over the hummingbird beat of his heart. At Potter’s shaky breath, Draco looked up. He knew that look in Potter’s eyes, the familiar weight of regret; it was a look that Draco himself wore like a second skin.
“And here you thought I would be no help,” Potter teased.
Peeking through a narrow gap between two books, he managed to glimpse the heads of the two Gryffindor boys and the bushy hair of the Granger girl, who was busy examining a series of leather–bound tomes on the opposite shelf.
Draco’s scowl returned. “Hardly. I’m just tired of your pathetic attempts to pretend you don’t see me every time we pass in the hallway, as if catching you snivelling in a bathroom wasn’t pitiful enough.”
“Right,” Potter replied, already moving towards the door. As their eyes met one last time, Potter flashed him a small smile. “See you later, Malfoy.”
you echoing around them; he was staring at a pair of pale, elegant hands, busy stirring a potion; he was on the cold floor of a bathroom, horribly vulnerable, looking up into the mirror where grey eyes watched him; he was sprinting across the Great Hall towards a fallen figure, shoving students out of his way; he was in the hospital wing, leaning over a bed.
“And why on earth would we do that?”
Draco snorted. “I don’t need to ‘talk about my ideas’ with you, Potter.” He pulled a few small, sealed vials from his bag, each filled with a different colour potion. Slughorn had given them permission to use the classroom in the evenings, on the condition that they didn’t test anything too risky without supervision. “I already know what I want to do. There’s no use wasting time faffing around.”
It was easier when it was just the two of them, heads bent together over a cauldron, stealing kisses. When they were alone together, Draco let himself consider it. He weighed the words on his tongue and watched Potter’s expression, wondering how he’d react if Draco said it, if he would smile.
Potter eyed the cauldron. “Are we brewing already? I thought we were just going to talk about your ideas.”
As a matter of fact, Draco
(See the end of the chapter for
He met Potter’s gaze with a cold stare. Potter’s jaw tightened.
“You’re saying Cedric Diggory invited you to the Prefects’ Bathroom… to open a golden egg?” Draco wasn’t deliberately trying to misconstrue the scenario that Potter described, but it sounded so much like a bad euphemism for something less than innocent that he was having trouble biting back a laugh.
Though he said none of this out loud, the Gryffindor boy was staring at him like he’d never quite seen him before. After a prolonged silence, Draco couldn’t take it anymore. “So what do you think?” As much as he had claimed he didn’t need or care about Potter’s opinion, the lack of response was making him nervous.
He had not been able to stop thinking about the kiss for even a single minute since it happened. A full 22 hours and 43 minutes had passed and yet he could not so much as brush his teeth without remembering the way Potter had tasted on his tongue. The steam of the bath seemed to cling to him, the warmth like a fever. He could see the canopy above him; he knew that he was in his room, sprawled out on his bed, nowhere near the fifth floor bathroom, and yet he could clearly feel the bare skin of Potter’s hips pressed against the inside of his legs. It was as if his nerves were frozen in time, unwilling to let go of the sensation.
“Back to the drawing board, I guess.” Draco smoothed out a fresh sheaf of parchment in front of him, tapping it thoughtfully with his quill. “Starting from scratch will take too long. I think our best bet is to try and find a way to make the potion penetrate more quickly.”
They both spoke at the same time, words clashing. Potter laughed a little, gesturing for Draco to go first.
“How much longer?”
“I’m sorry, Mr. Malfoy.”
“Draco’s been working with Potter for that potion competition,” Pansy answered for him, seeing his hesitation. “They’re friends now. Right Draco?” Draco gave a noncommittal gesture somewhere between a nod and a shrug, breathing a sigh of relief. He really didn’t know what he’d do without Pansy. Every time he began to overthink things and the anxiety started to set in, she knew exactly how to help.
, I promised I would take it easy, and it’s not as if brewing potions with Potter is particularly strenuous.”
“You really should take it easy for a bit.” Pansy’s voice came from the other side of the privacy curtain as Draco dressed. He had managed to negotiate with Madam Pomfrey to wear his own pyjamas rather than the abhorrent hospital gown she had first offered him, but after almost four days, it was nice to finally put on a pair of real trousers again. “Or for tonight, at least.”
Draco managed to hide his smile by leaning over his notes. “Very, very occasionally, I’m sure. Now keep stirring, I don’t think we should start from scratch just yet.”
Something unpleasant twisted in Draco’s stomach. In his previous experiments, he had tested nearly every potion that had shown even the slightest hint of promise on himself, even the ones that were perhaps too risky to merit it. But all those times, he had been alone in his study at the manor, with no one to see as he rolled up his sleeve and dripped one dubious potion after another onto the skin of his left forearm. Now, with Potter in the picture, he knew he would have to find an alternative. He could not bear the thought of having Potter stare at the Mark on his arm, not even in the name of research.
Slughorn’s voice followed Draco as he fled from the room, that same loathsome note of pity colouring every word.

How humiliating, that Potter should once again be the one to act as his saviour. Draco knew his face was red, both from shame and anger, but more curiously, so was Potter’s. He averted his eyes as Draco glanced over at him, cheeks flushed as if embarrassed that by the fact that he had rushed to Draco’s side.
“Merlin’s pants, Potter, is this the Inquisition? Do you plan to burn me at the stake if I answer wrong?”
“I’m hardly a
“Not enough, apparently, because if you’ll look at the picture she’s attached…” Pansy plucked the small, butter-stained photograph out from where it had fallen onto a platter of toast, holding it out to Draco in the same way she might offer someone a particularly revolting insect. “She’s expanded her search to include Durmstrang students now.”
It was a terrible lie.
“I don’t need your help,” Draco growled, jerking the pillow away from Potter’s grasp. Potter drew back, watching silently as Draco managed to shove himself up and prop a pillow behind his back. It took more effort than Draco cared to admit, and his side was throbbing by the time he finally settled into a half-reclined position.
“Hired to do what?”
Potter and his clingy friends were nearing the door. This was his chance. “I’ll be there, Pans, I promise,” Draco insisted. “Just give me ten minutes, alright?”
In the past, Draco supposed that he would have felt a sense of vindication knowing that he had been right all along to suspect Potter’s sixth year potions performance. But now, the whole thing seemed trivial. “I knew you couldn’t have gotten better marks than me without cheating.” Draco shook his head.
Draco responded, “Yes, of course, sir” at the exact same moment that Potter replied with a hesitant, “Er, no.”
He leaned over the cauldron and jabbed angrily at the ruined potion, which was now the colour of charcoal and smelled like spoilt milk. Potter had relinquished the stirring rod without question, but he had not otherwise moved; his expression was distant and unreadable.
“You don’t have to be here,” Draco had said as he stirred the half-finished potion in the cauldron. “You can go back to drinking with your friends.”
Pansy pushed herself up from the chair that she had made her home over the last few days. “I’m not remanding you to your room or anything,” she said, reaching for his discarded pyjamas. Draco winced as he watched her shove them unceremoniously into his bookbag. “I just don’t want to end up right back here tomorrow morning, alright?”
In his dreams, Draco stormed across the Great Hall and seized Potter by the front of his robes, dragging him up off the bench as onlookers gasped. In his dreams, they stood nose to nose, those green eyes flashing as Draco pressed the tip of his wand to Potter’s chest.
Professor Hayward, misinterpreting the glance, offered, “If you would prefer, you could do the demonstration with another student – Miss Granger or Mr. Weasley, perhaps?”
.” His green eyes flashed. “You still barely look yourself.”
He was supposed to meet with Potter again later that afternoon to work on their potion, which was part of the reason why he hadn't been able to sleep. It wasn’t strictly Potter’s fault, Draco knew, although he wished he could blame it on the Gryffindor. He just couldn’t explain what it was that had him tossing and turning even more than usual at night, or why he felt like someone had hexed him every time Potter looked his way. Maybe Potter
“Draco?” Pansy whispered, clutching his hand so tightly that even with the petrification, Draco could feel the sharp sting of her nails digging into his skin. Her voice and the grounding touch were enough to bring him back to the present.
Refusing to back down from Potter’s aggressive observation, he stared back stubbornly across the hall. He would not cower, not to the likes of Potter. But as the seconds dragged by, Draco grew more and more unnerved. Why wasn’t Potter turning away? He had suffered many unpleasant looks that evening, but for reasons Draco could not explain, Potter’s gaze made his stomach twist more than any other.
McGonagall continued to regard them both, eyebrows raised, and after a moment, Draco realized she expected a response.
Draco flipped back through his journal, searching for the list that he had made last week of possible potion additives. “Yes?”
Draco’s morning was not off to an auspicious start.
He understood then what was behind Potter’s hesitancy. Draco remembered how their last kiss had ended, how he had pushed Potter away. He remembered the words he had yelled before he ran out of the bathroom.
“On my wrist? Like a baby bottle?”
“Is that good or bad?” Potter raised his head from his arms to look at the potion, expression caught somewhere between hopeful and concerned.
Potter set aside the stirring rod he’d used to sample the potion, shrugging. “I had some help from Dumbledore’s phoenix, Fawkes. It’s kind of a long story.”
“I swear, what was even the point of coming back to finish your N.E.W.T.s if you two can’t even be bothered to put in a minimal amount of effort?” Granger shook her head in exasperation, looking thoroughly put out as she began to put back all the belongings she had just dumped out of her bag.
Draco thought back, trying to understand how on earth the tournament related to the Prefects’ Bathroom, but nothing came to mind. “Care to elaborate, Potter?”
Purely by chance, his Colour Change Charm had turned the fabric a vibrant shade of green. Someone towards the front of the classroom snickered.
Draco didn’t understand, not at all, but he nodded as if he did.
“Are you sure you don’t want anything?” Potter asked him when he returned, tucking his purchase into his coat pocket.
Draco wanted to wipe that shit-eating grin off his stupid freckled face. His wand was halfway drawn when he remembered that he was supposed to be staying out of trouble. Cursing Potter and his friends into oblivion would definitely count as stepping out of line.
“What do you want, Malfoy?” Weasley cut in before Potter had a chance to speak. Granger bit her lip.
“I’ve been taking it easy for three and a half days,” he told her as he pulled on his shirt. “Even I have my limits on how many hours I can spend reading alone in bed.”
For a long moment, Pansy was silent. When she finally spoke, it was not at all what Draco expected.
Pansy gestured behind him, grinning. “Maybe because he’s right over there.”
“I’m supposed to be taking it easy, remember?” Draco smirked, stepping past her before she could protest any further. He could hear Pansy grumbling under her breath as he headed towards the door, but when he realized that she wasn’t following him, he turned back.
“What?”
Draco wanted to ask Pansy what the bloody hell had just happened, but he knew he’d have to save the interrogation for later when they were alone. Instead, Draco somehow ended up making eye contact with Granger, who raised her eyebrows at him, clearly wondering the same thing. Draco just shook his head.
Draco’s heart began to race. Obsessive? What did that mean? Surely nothing good, and yet…
Potter had stopped stirring. “When was the last time you ate, Malfoy?”
“Sure, I guess.” Potter raised an eyebrow. “Why?”
Instead, he shook his head at Pansy, muttering something dismissive to Goyle about wanting to rest before he turned his back on the room, heading down the hallway McGonagall had indicated earlier. It split off into two separate passageways, one labelled for men and another for women. Further along the corridor, Draco found the door draped in Slytherin green and quickly slammed it shut behind him, silencing the sounds of laughter and conversation that carried from the common room.
Draco thought back to the moments just before the curse had hit him. He knew he had been furious, but he could no longer summon the kind of blood-boiling anger that had driven him then. What exactly had he wanted to say to Potter?
Potter ran a nervous hand through his hair. “I, er…” He glanced at Pansy. “I wanted to know when you thought we should get back to work on the potion. If you, er, still wanted to, that is.”
Draco was reaching for his wand when Potter’s hand closed around his arm, pulling him towards the alley between two nearby shops, just barely shielded from the rain by the eaves of the buildings. Too surprised to do anything else, Draco allowed Potter to guide him until they were face to face beneath the meagre shelter, only a handsbreadth between them in the narrow space.
“Just because I’m smarter than you, it doesn’t mean I’m omniscient, Potter,” Draco replied dryly.
In his periphery, he could see Blaise and Pansy both reaching for their wands, and he could only hope that they knew better than to cast the first spell. Even if his friends had not had to fight quite as hard as Draco to return to Hogwarts, initiating a duel with the Gryffindors seemed like a pretty sure-fire way to get them all a one-way ticket home.
Draco shook off Pansy’s hand from where she was still gripping his sleeve, like he was a wild animal liable to bolt at any moment. It was too late to run now.
“I’ve been wrong before.” Draco smiled just a bit. “I guess I should have given you more credit.”
They were coming up on it, the moment Draco knew was inevitable and yet had still desperately hoped to avoid. He dug his nails into his palms.
Draco could not help the triumph in his voice as he held up the synthetic skin, now flawlessly healed. “I told you it was working!”
“I changed my mind,” Potter repeated, cutting him off midsentence. Draco waited for him to illuminate further, but somehow it seemed that Potter thought this response was sufficient, despite the fact that it answered exactly zero of Draco’s questions.
for Draco, okay?”
Draco pursed is lips, hazarding a glance to his left. Potter shifted uncomfortably on his feet.
He glanced around the room as Potter began filling the tub with water. The Prefects’ Bathroom had been the obvious choice—the only choice, really—since the eighth year bathrooms only had showers, not tubs. They could have conjured one, he supposed, but then they would’ve run the risk of someone walking in on them, and even if all they were doing was a simple potions experiment, it was for the best that people didn’t see him and Potter together like that; neither of them needed more rumours.
“Don’t be ridiculous, of course I still want to,” Draco said brusquely. Relieved as he was that Potter still wanted to work with him, he wasn’t about to give the Gryffindor any reason to think he was
“She’s still at it.”
Draco wasn’t sure what to say. He thought that perhaps Pansy expected him to tell Potter to leave, or demand to know why he was there, but something made Draco hesitate. Both Potter and Pansy were staring at him, waiting, but Draco’s mind was whirling. He hardly knew why he was in the Hospital Wing in the first place, let alone why Potter might be sitting at his bedside; it was too much to take in at once, and he could hardly decide which question to ask first. Not to mention, the pain in his ribs was killing him. “Erm, what—?”
“What’s your problem, Potter?”
Still, they managed to find time now and then to slip away to an unused classroom or hidden passageway, pressing each other against the walls, lips and hands touching, tasting, searching.
, he tried to push back with his mind, to force out the intrusion.
“Why are you here, anyway? You’ve been avoiding Draco for days now, I don’t understand—”
Finnigan looked between Draco and Potter, eyes narrowed. It looked to Draco like he was considering shoving Potter’s hand aside and ignoring him, but after a moment, Finnigan lowered his wand.
“Wormwood,” Potter murmured, uncorking the bottle while Draco made a note in his journal. “It’s used in the Draught of Living Death, isn’t it? To reduce the side effects of the asphodel root?”
“Good, good,” Slughorn nodded thoughtfully, smoothing his moustache. “Well, if you boys need any help or advice in the meantime, you know where to find me.”
Draco had been so caught off guard by Potter’s familiarity with his potion-making habits that he hadn’t been able to think of a comeback, and so in the end they had pushed back the tables and spread out their supplies and ingredients on the stone floor. If Potter found it uncomfortable that they were sitting almost knee-to-knee, he made no indication of it. His nonchalance about what had happened—or almost happened—between them should have been a source of relief, considering how anxious Draco was to put the whole thing behind them. But even so, he couldn’t help the slight quickening of his pulse every time Potter leaned forward over the cauldron, his mind automatically calculating the distance left between them.
Draco was so hard it was almost painful, unable to help the way his nails dug into Potter’s skin, although Potter didn’t seem to mind. His hips had started moving against Draco in an achingly unsatisfying rhythm, the friction so good and yet nowhere near enough. His breath was coming in gasps, lips hovering just over Potter’s. He flattened his palm against the small of Potter’s back beneath his shirt, guiding his movements, seeking something faster, harder,
, you two should know better.” Professor Hayward’s voice was as stern as Draco had ever heard it. “You are both adults. I will not tolerate this kind of childish behaviour in my classroom.”
“I wanted to finish my N.E.W.T.s,” he answered evasively, shoving his hands in his pockets. “And that’s all I’m here to do. I don’t really care to add on a load of extra work.”
In the silence that followed, Draco let his gaze flicker back to Potter, just to see if the other boy was still watching him. But as it turned out, Draco wasn’t the only one looking at Potter. Almost all of the Gryffindors as well as a few students from other houses had their eyes focused on him, as if under the impression — accurate or not, Draco didn’t know — that Potter had experience with Occlumency or Legilimency. Even Granger and Weasley, oddly enough, had turned to look at Potter, although Granger was quick to look away.
“Calm down, Pans,” he grumbled, trying to extricate himself from her embrace as the pain in his side became too much to bear. “I’m not dead yet, you just said it yourself. Now get off, will you? You’re hurting me.”
He was ready to settle in for a long night of research to try and find a method of stabilizing the potion, or perhaps a replacement for the Bubotuber pus, when the sound of a familiar voice drew his attention.
Potter’s expression betrayed only a moment of surprise before shifting into a maddening smirk. “I was only looking at your tie,” he replied coolly, nodding his head at Draco’s chest. “What happened, Malfoy? Slytherin not want you anymore? Did you have to create your own House?”
“When has he ever wanted to just talk to Harry?” the Weasel insisted, a mulish look on his face.
It wasn’t a particularly witty or cutting reply, but for a few long seconds, Draco almost thought he’d managed to render Potter speechless. There was a beat of silence, and then abruptly Potter stood, pulling his jumper over his head without ceremony and tossing it aside before beginning to undo his shirt.
“I’m sure you are all wondering where you will be staying,” she began. “Since an eighth year class is unprecedented, and you are all now adults, we have decided to assign you your own common room.”
“Good, I think.” Draco didn’t want to get Potter’s hopes up too high, or his own for that matter, but he couldn’t keep the eagerness from his movements as he reached for one of the pieces of synthetic skin he had already prepared, very nearly knocking over the bottle of Murtlap tentacles in his haste. He was more careful as he applied a small amount of potion along the line of artificial scar tissue bisecting the piece of skin, watching with bated breath as it smoked slightly upon contact. A few seconds passed, and then the scar slowly began to smooth, fading until not a single trace of it remained.
“Yeah.” Draco swallowed, thinking back to sixth year, to the long, dark days when a ghost was his closest confidant.  “Yeah, I guess I do.” The smile faded from Potter’s lips. With a jolt, Draco realized that perhaps they were recalling the same thing: that day in the boys’ bathroom on the sixth floor, mirrors and porcelain shattering as they duelled; the spilling first of water, then of blood.
Two photos accompanied the story: the first was of Potter, looking uncomfortable and yet still somehow noble as he accepted his Order of Merlin, First Class from Kingsley Shacklebolt. The second one was of Draco at his trial.
Concentrating back on his notes, Draco was horrified to find that he had drawn a rather familiar-looking lightning bolt in the bottom corner of his parchment. He hastily scribbled it out, hoping to Merlin that Potter hadn’t seen, silently chastising himself for his foolishness. It was high time he started focusing on what really mattered, which was the potion. It wouldn’t do to keep getting distracted like this, not when the stakes were so high for him.
“No,” Potter answered quickly. He glanced over at Weasley and Granger, then amended, “Er, well, yes, I guess I do, with both, but I’m useless at it, I swear.”
Draco could hear Potter’s grin in his voice. “I guess that’s my mistake.”
Draco struggled to speak. Potter wasn’t wrong, exactly—after all, those were the same excuses that Draco had used time and again to assuage his own guilt. He had never regretted trying to protect his family, and he never would, but he also knew that those justifications were not enough to absolve him for his actions. Underage or not, he’d known full well what it meant when he took the Mark; when he’d sent that necklace and poisoned that mead and raised his wand at Dumbledore. He’d tortured people, no matter how unwillingly. He’d nearly tortured Potter, even. But by the time he opened his mouth to point all of that out, Potter had already started talking again.
Potter shook his head, smiling a little. “It’s nothing, really. I’ve just never seen you laugh like that before.”
The black-haired boy still had that inquisitive look on his face, like he wanted to ask yet another unnecessary and invasive question. Before he could, Draco pressed, “So will you help me out or not?”
He made a vague gesture, but Draco didn’t need to hear the end of that sentence. He had thought that Slughorn had only picked Potter because of his own reverential affection for the precious Boy Who Lived. Now, Draco realized Slughorn had hoped that with Harry Potter’s name attached, it might just be enough to cancel out the horrible weight of his own.
Time was a fickle thing. Draco could remember enduring days in Azkaban that had felt like years, each minute longer than the last. Now, when he might have wished for more, the hours felt like they were slipping through his fingers.
Since there were so few eighth years, the boys' showers were shared, although mercifully the bathroom was empty when Draco entered. He turned on the water and stripped quickly, setting aside his neatly folded clothes before ducking under the hot spray.
Potter nodded. He was looking at Draco with that unfathomable expression again, the one that made Draco want to pull his hair out and Charm all of his possessions purple.
Draco was halfway to the Gryffindor table, muttering furiously under his breath as he went, when out of the corner of his eye he saw an unusual burst of shimmering blue light. There was a shout, followed quickly by an agonizing, blinding pain in his left side, and as Draco fell to the floor, all he could think was that it better not be Potter who came and saved him, because he really couldn’t afford any more personal debts.
“Actually,” Potter said, green eyes meeting grey like flint striking stone, “Malfoy is a great Occlumens. I think he should give the demonstration with me.”
, he reminded himself,
Draco didn’t have to ask what he meant. He had wondered the same thing, after all, about whether defending Potter might have just been a convenient excuse to attack him. It wasn’t as if the students at Hogwarts made it a secret how unwanted he was—how unwanted all the Slytherin eighth years were, but most especially him, the Death Eater who had never paid for his crimes.
“I think…” He hesitated just a moment longer. He knew the words were true, but that didn’t do anything to alleviate their heavy weight on his tongue. They sat at the back of his throat, leaden, and since he could no longer swallow them, the only option left was to spit them out. “I think I’m gay.”
With some difficulty, Draco managed to suppress his surging anger, cornering it into a little box in the back of his mind along with the hideous sensation of embarrassment. When he spoke, all that remained was a kind of cold contempt.
All it had taken was one little word. Perhaps, Draco thought, he should use that more often.
Drunk or not, he was glad for Potter’s company. It felt right to have him there, almost like Potter himself was an integral part of the process. And maybe he was, because when Draco added the Murtlap tentacles — one large spoonful, finely minced, added over a low heat with three clockwise stirs — the potion frothed and rapidly changed colour, unlike any reaction they’d produced before.
“Well…” Weasley and Potter shared a helpless look. “We were sort of counting on being able to borrow yours,” Weasley admitted, scratching the back of his neck. It was hard not to laugh at the pathetically guilty look on Potter’s face, but Draco didn’t think Granger would find the situation very funny just now, and he didn’t want to risk her turning her fury on him.
“Professor Snape always insisted you were the best in your year, and I have to say I quite agree. I think you have what it takes to win this competition.” In that moment, the praise felt like a knife to Draco’s gut. “But, unfortunately, the judging isn’t blind. I thought that, perhaps, with Harry…”
” The word echoed off the marble walls, too loud. “You know nothing about my relationship with my family.” Draco kicked off his shoes and socks, perhaps a bit more aggressively than he usually would. One skidded dangerously close to the edge of the bath, barely an inch away from toppling into the water. “Don’t pretend you do.”
Pansy sighed in relief as she was freed of the weight of the last two volumes. Then, eyeing his collar, she advised, “You should probably do up the rest of your buttons first.”
“I thought...”
As if the implication weren’t obvious enough, McGonagall shot a glance in the direction of the Slytherins. Draco wished she would just let it be. No amount of conciliatory speeches would make the students cheer his return.
Pansy sat up, tossing her magazine aside. “Come on, would you really have preferred that I make a big deal about it?”
Draco ignored her sarcasm. “You knew?”
Weasley’s barking laugh was not the only one that echoed through the hall; even Granger appeared to be struggling not to smile. Draco had no idea what Potter was on about. In fact, he was sure that Potter was speaking complete nonsense until he heard Blaise’s quiet snicker beside him.
Draco cleared his throat. “You can borrow my notes, if you want.”
A few seconds passed in which Potter remained blissfully unaware of the surely very awkward encounter that was about to occur, and then Granger quietly cleared her throat, drawing his attention. His eyes flicked over to her, then moved to Pansy, expression rapidly shifting to confusion as his gaze finally landed on Draco.
“Get over here, Draco!” Pansy called, gesturing imperiously at the open armchair next to hers.
“What’s up with you, anyway?” The Weasel’s voice carried from behind the shelves to Draco’s right, loud enough that it wasn’t quite muffled by the oppressive quiet that Draco was half certain Madam Pince charmed into the walls of the library itself. “You’ve been acting weird all day.”
Nights like this were almost a routine. The fragmented nightmares, jolting him awake; the long moments of disorientation and fear; the splash of water on his face and neck to rinse the clammy feeling of sweat from his skin; the soft light from his wand as he stayed up the rest of the night reading, choosing a day of exhaustion over the terrifying prospect of having to close his eyes again.
colour, don’t you think?”
Draco thought, turning back to Pansy with a resigned sigh.
Draco’s more fastidious side got the better of him and he abandoned his shirt buttoning in order to save his pyjamas from Pansy’s clutches. All too familiar with his compulsive neatness, Pansy said nothing, but Draco caught her rolling her eyes as he went about carefully folding each article of clothing.
He wanted to believe that the Draco Malfoy the other students glared at, the one they hated, was a different person; that the Draco Malfoy that liked Potter was someone new, someone better. He wanted to believe it so badly, but most days, the past felt far too close, and much too painful.
It was a longer answer than he might have normally given, maybe longer than Potter expected, but the other boy just nodded, seeming to understand.
Draco gnashed his teeth. “
