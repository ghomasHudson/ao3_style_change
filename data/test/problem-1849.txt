But despite the growing commotion going on around him, Harry can’t bring himself to worry. Strangely, as McGonagall huffs and casts a
He’s having trouble moving because it’s so cold in the house. The heating charms seem to have broken. “I don’t know what’s happening,” Harry shivers against Draco as they lay in bed.
He thinks, with some amount of resignation, that he was probably right the other night—about falling in love with him. But loving him means that he’ll do what Draco wants, what he needs, and if Draco needs them to stay just friends, then he’ll do it.
He’d thought—dreamed, maybe, that he could get over this if they had sex. And this is as close as they can get, but—
Harry’s just lonely. That’s why he suddenly wants to be near Malfoy again, right? He’s just lonely, and—and touch-starved. That’s all.
They finish dinner and retire to the sitting room. Draco does his best to keep his mind blank, to not think of Potter, to not think of death. He notices eventually that Mother is writing a letter, and when he tries to snoop, she hides it with her arm.
Draco stares at him for a moment, then lets out a long sigh. “Potter. As much as I’m flattered, I hope you know it would be a terrible idea, for us to sleep together.”
His Draco climbs into bed next to him, and Harry allows it, because he’d give anything to feel Draco holding him again—
They spend the day researching with Ron, Owling back and forth with Hermione. Harry still doesn’t quite know what to make of the information he's finding, but every time Hermione reads his summaries she gives him an approving note and then refines the list of books he’s supposed to read, so he assumes she’s making something of it all.
“Thanks, you two,” she says, eyes sparkling. And then she lets out a large yawn, momentarily leaning into Ron’s side. “I think I need to head off to bed now, though. I’ve been awake for far too long,” she adds, and they all laugh. “But thanks for everything. Really.” She’s looking at Draco as she says it.
“A gift from Blaise,” he says, crossing to stand next to Potter. And then he lets out a small gasp—he’d had it all wrong, really, how they would look together like this. Potter’s actually nearly his height—Draco always thought he was a bit shorter, but no, they’re nearly even—and Potter’s eyes are greener too, his shoulders a bit more broad.
Malfoy looking at him, saying his name, he liked watching Malfoy coming—and he wants to do it all again.
She’s the only person he’s willingly told he loved them besides Mother in his whole fucking life. He hadn’t even told Pansy that, even though they were close for literally all of his childhood.
“Fine,” Malfoy says sharply, as if Harry isn’t doing him a favor. Harry almost opens his mouth to say so, except then Malfoy closes his eyes and says, more quietly, “Fine. I... thanks, Potter.”
things about Draco. Like the way his hair glints in the light from the ceiling when he tilts his head a certain direction, or the way the edges of his lips prick into the tiniest of not-quite-smiles just before he’s about to laugh. And maybe he’s noticed these things before, but they all seem so much more
Malfoy bows his head. “Oh,” he says, and for a moment it looks like he might pass out. As it is, he wavers where he stands, and Harry raises a hand to steady him without thinking about it.
He bites his lip, sitting back against the arm of the sofa. “I won’t come back yet,” he says. “I’m… watching.”
That at least makes sense, and Draco feels a wave of guilt, something he doesn’t let himself feel when he’s off the potion. There’s a lot of things he doesn’t let himself feel when he’s off the Amortentia—or rather, that he
“You’re trying...” Draco swallows, stomach churning with the realization. “You’re trying to get my sentence overturned.”
“Yes,” Draco says, heart flipping into his throat. “I want it to be—to be real. When I say it, I want you to—to feel the same way.”
“Just wait and see,” Potter says, turning and motioning to where the memory is again changing around them.
The next time he goes down Knockturn, he avoids Malfoy’s stoop on the way home. He feels distinctly embarrassed about the idea of confronting him again so soon, and if Malfoy actually wants to see him, he can reach out to Harry himself.
Pansy and Draco have to stay in the waiting room along with the rest of the Weasleys who have shown up to visit, but Harry and Hermione, being the only non-Purebloods, are allowed to enter Ginny’s room. “Hey,” Ginny says, seeming cheerful as she slides out of her hospital bed, but Harry can tell from her face that she’s been crying. “I’m so glad you two are here.”
It’s not the first time Harry’s been out on Knockturn late on a job. Most of the alley’s shop owners don’t want to be seen with a Ministry-appointed ward-builder during the day lest it incite distrust from their seedier customers, but they need him, and Harry is one of the few in his small department who doesn’t mind taking the more dangerous jobs.
“Oh, this is mostly for fun,” Harry says, shrugging as he picks up the clock. “I’ve never been able to figure out how to charm electrical things—they always glitch halfway through. So I’m just fiddling, really. I can take a break.”
“Patience, Potter,” Draco says, but he jerks Harry’s trousers down his hips anyway, taking his pants with them. Harry’s cock springs out, flushed and leaking, and Draco stares at it and groans, pressing his hand to the front of his own pants.
Harry scowls. “I’m not the one who got disowned,” he points out, regretting it a little when Malfoy winces.
He sighs. “Even if you have a point, it’s ridiculous to try to engage with him. He hates me as much as I loathe him.”
Harry is not all right. He’s just choked on his stew, and he coughs loudly for several moments before he manages to calm down. “Sorry, I—just. Never mind. Keep going.”
It’s a bit sad that Harry smiling is such a strange occurrence that Hermione’s called it out. Harry shrugs, trying for nonchalance. “Just daydreaming.”
Somehow Draco’s become one of his closest friends, and despite the horror his younger self would feel at that, he thinks he doesn’t mind at all.
Silverware clinked, and mugs of pumpkin juice were emptied and refilled. Everything was going swimmingly until mid-dessert, when without warning, Draco stole a bit of treacle tart off of his plate.
“Okay, and...?” Harry says, his voice twinging with annoyance. And really, Harry’s not actually as annoyed with Malfoy as he’s pretending to be, but Malfoy deserves it for giving him the cold shoulder for so long.
“Shh, it’s okay, I’ve got you,” Draco murmurs, pulling Harry in close and holding him steady. Harry sighs in relief.
Malfoy’s lips twist, and he actually seems sad to hear that. He sighs. “Everyone would notice if you were gone, Potter. A lot of people care about you, if only superficially. Me, on the other hand...” He scoffs bitterly. “Me, they’d be glad to never see again.”
. You use me so you don’t have to think about what you did, or—no, let me finish,” she says when he tries to interrupt. “You use me so you don’t have to think about your past, or how other people look at you now, or about how much you loathe yourself, and—and do you know how much that pains me? I adore you, but you
But instead of seeming offended by it all like Harry half-expects him to be, Malfoy just shakes his head. “Whatever, Weasley. Don’t worry about it,” he says, and he sounds like he actually means it.
The TV has stopped turning on. It’s not too big of a deal, because they didn’t watch it anyway (every station showed the news, and all of the news involved the bombing). But the drawers don’t want to seem to open either, and they’ve both somehow misplaced their broomsticks.
Grinning, Potter leans into him, pressing a kiss into his jaw. “It means I can look forward to falling in love with you—cuz then I get to hear you say it back.”
Draco nearly chokes. He grits his teeth against the hurt in his lungs, feeling suddenly miserable—because she
Draco toys around with a chip, contemplating her words before taking a bite. “Do you really despise it? I just always assumed you weren’t interested.”
“I do,” Harry says, nodding. “She’s—honestly, she’s like a mother to me. And she’s my best product tester, too. Not to mention that Mr. Weasley’s always good to consult so I can make sure I’m not breaking the Misuse of Muggle Artifact laws.”
Malfoy stares at Harry for a second, his mouth dropping open, and then Harry knows with sudden certainty that Malfoy is thinking about the kiss, about that dumb game, being paired together, snogging until they were both breathless—
As it turns out, unfortunately even friendship with Malfoy can’t really help Harry sleep at night, and after the third night in a row of nightmares so bad he can barely sleep at all, Harry goes to see Madame Pomfrey out of desperation.
Their past-selves make small talk, but Draco’s finding it honestly kind of hard to pay attention to the memory because
“I didn’t do anything!” Potter shouts back, sounding strained. “I only cast a Bat Bogey. It didn’t even hit you!”
He’s said it so openly that Harry’s chest burns. “What do you mean?” Then he thinks about it and adds, “I mean, besides us being coworkers, obviously.”
“Oh—sorry,” he apologizes, sitting up in the uncomfortable library chair he’d been slouched in. The book in front of him is still lying open on its first page, his parchment for his Transfiguration essay completely blank. Making a face, he glances at the clock—he really ought to get started since it’s due tomorrow morning.
Although, now that he thinks of it, Malfoy wasn’t as horrible as Harry expected during their eighth year either.
“You can be you without me,” Malfoy says, looking him in the eyes. He pulls his hands away from Harry, and Harry misses them immediately. “We can’t do this, you understand?”
Malfoy waves it off. “I was fine—that part was better than coming home and getting laid into by Father, by far—no, don’t you dare apologize, I can see it in your eyes.
Malfoy’s desperation strikes a chord in Harry’s chest, and Harry’s heart hurts. It reminds him of the part of himself that whispers, in the back of his mind, that his only purpose in life was killing Voldemort.
“Oops.” He dropped it, picking up another one with his own name on it. He caught sight of Draco, who looked slightly wounded.
Still, as he looks over at the other man, lounging in the same deep blue Unspeakable Trainee robes Harry is wearing and somehow managing to seem almost elegant despite it being so late at night, Harry can't help the way his heart thumps unsteadily in his chest.
Potter’s always been brave in the face of death; Draco wonders if he can tell that Draco means to kill him. It’s fitting, then, that Draco is the one who steps away. He can’t do it, not now, with Potter’s eyes hot on his skin and anxiety scrambling his thoughts.
“Hm,” Hermione says. “It’s possible he needs some time to cool down before he can really accept your apology. But it’s also possible that he needs you to
—Draco’s cock twitches against his thigh as he imagines Harry, standing there with him in the showers, throwing furtive looks in Draco’s direction as he pulls himself off—
“C’mere,” Harry says, patting the bed next to him. He half expects Malfoy to say no, to change his mind, especially when Malfoy raises an eyebrow at him—but then Malfoy slowly stands from the chair, walking over and sitting next to Harry on the bed.
“Thank you, Nimsy,” Draco says, registering that Potter’s giving him a strange look. He ignores it. “Do you think you could start dinner for us?”
Although, there’s the unfortunate side effect that he’s started getting erections at the mere sound of Potter’s voice.
“Oh, I see,” Hermione says, her brows furrowing in thought. “You know, there’s a spell we use around the hospital that might be useful to him, if he’s worried about that.”
“No, it’s just… different.” He looks down at their hands intertwined, Potter’s skin pleasantly warm against his. “You do it so easily.”
“You don’t just touch it—you have to strike it. Like this.” Harry reached for Malfoy’s hands without thinking about it.
Malfoy catches it, looking breathless as he drips some onto his hand. Then he slicks himself, moaning softly, his eyelids fluttering shut.
As much as he wants to insist on going anyway, Harry concedes that he probably won’t even be able to see Draco for most of that time. “Okay,” he says, his voice cracking. Then he throws his arms around Draco. “Fuck,” he mumbles.
. And more than that, they’ve only been not-enemies for so long. “I need some time to think about it, maybe.”
Hermione rubs his shoulder, nodding and closing her eyes. “I’m getting closer to the cure, I think,” she says slowly. “I’m starting to feel hopeful. He’ll be okay soon enough.”
“Okay,” Harry says, ignoring the sense of yearning stretching its claws in his chest as he watches Malfoy unsuccessfully try to mask his enthusiasm. “Then we’ll... we’ll keep trying, all right?”
Startled, Harry snatches his hand back inside the bubble of the charm, wanting to laugh and cry all at once. “I... I dunno.”
“Are you in love with me?” Potter asks, in the middle of unbuttoning Draco’s shirt, and Draco chokes on air.
Malfoy tried to strike another match, a little too tentatively. It didn’t light, and he frowned at it, trying once more. This time, when the flame appeared, he flinched but didn’t drop it.
“I liked you,” Draco says, quieter then. “I was happy when we kissed—I might’ve asked you to the last Hogsmeade weekend, if I hadn’t—if the bond hadn’t—”
Then he takes Draco in hand and Draco sucks in a breath, his eyes fluttering shut. Moments later, he comes, spurting into Harry’s hand, and Harry revels in the image of him, mouth rounded, gasping as he presses upward into Harry’s touch.
The frown slowly evaporated from Draco’s lips. He leaned over, inch by inch, and slid his arms around Harry’s neck, resting his head on Harry’s chest.
Harry’s not expecting Malfoy to take off soon after, to head off into the dance floor while Harry’s still halfway through his drink. Harry’s not sure whether he was meant to follow him or not, so in the end he stays put, staring moodily out in the crowd as he slowly embraces the thrum of the alcohol.
“All right,” Draco says, acquiescing easily as Harry takes his hand and tugs him back into the sunlight of the late fall afternoon.
He thinks with some resignation that maybe Malfoy was partially right—he’s kind of just accepted that his life is pretty dull. Which is to say that his life is a mess that’s barely held-together by the fact that he ignores all his problems in favor of working too much, and it will probably continue to be like that for the foreseeable future, because he doesn’t know how to change it even if he wanted to. He and Ron and Hermione are all well aware of it, and unfortunately it seems now like Malfoy knows it too.
“I’ll have to test them all, of course, which could take a month or more,” Draco cautions, but Hermione still looks overjoyed.
“I like it,” Harry declares, shocking even himself. It’s as if the castle had heard him deep inside, crying out that he didn’t belong, and had opened itself up to make room for him.
wanted that, for so long it’s painful, and yesterday, for a brief moment, he thought it might even be possible.
“Hello, Mr. Potter,” says the woman at the front desk, interrupting his thoughts. She's the same woman as the first time he’d come, and he opens his mouth to ask how all of this works, but before he can get a word out, she picks up an orb from under the desk and sets it afloat. “Your room is ready for you.”
Harry’s embarrassed when his cock immediately throbs. “You better learn quite a lot of charms to keep us from getting caught, then, if you plan on shagging me in public.”
In response, Neville gives a long sigh and rubs at his temple with one hand. “What am I going to do with you two?”
“Fine,” Draco says, rolling his eyes. “When you’re not being an absolute fucking tease, I rather adore you, so would you just get on with it?”
And she’d caused a medical revolution. Her coworkers at St. Mungo’s had been distrustful of her methods at first, because even though the war was over, varying levels of anti-Muggle sentiment still remained. But time and time again, Hermione proved that her new kinds of spellwork were undeniably effective. It helped that at that point, Muggle ideology had finally started seeping further into Wizarding culture, and eventually Hermione was moved from the Janus Thickey Ward to a position where she could be appointed wherever she was needed.
“I think it’s time to move on to other subjects,” Malfoy says, his expression blank as he starts packing up his easel. “One can only learn so much painting one person.”
“It is,” Malfoy says, looking pained. “Mother’s the only person I really have left. Vince is dead, and Greg and Pansy went off to France... but I’m stuck here, and when she dies, I’ll—I’ll have nothing.”
“Seems to be,” Malfoy says, making a face. “My mother Owled me as soon as she saw the notice in the Prophet. Apparently there are some old Pureblood families who are attempting to blame it on some sort of Muggleborn curse.”
By the time he walks outside again, the sun is starting to set. He thinks of Potter’s earlier words, debates following his advice for a moment, and then finally decides to head to the Ministry after all.
“So anyway,” Hermione is saying, “I was checking over the updated pureblood family registry before I sent it in for approval, and by chance I noticed that Malfoy’s name was missing—probably some legal irregularity, I assume, and—Harry, are you all right?”
Potter must’ve been thinking about something similar because the memory fast-forwards then, zooming on later in the night.
“What the hell are you talking about?” Draco sneered at him. “Are you serious? We never fucked, if that’s what you mean.”
Draco pushes his shoulder, flushing with warmth, a tentative happiness sprouting in his chest. “Sap.”
“You won’t need reminding, I’m sure,” Draco tells him, pressing a kiss to Harry’s temple, and Harry sinks into him, feeling fuzzy with happiness.
He left the head table, bee-lining straight for the door of the Great Hall before anyone decided that it would be a good idea to strike up a conversation. Dancing was on the schedule right after dinner, and Harry was glad for any reason to get out of it.
“I can’t believe it,” Hermione says, jaw dropping open as she examines one diagnostic tool, then another. “There’s barely a trace of the virus, and the numbers of infected cells are dropping as we speak.”
At last, they’re sitting, backs to the lift wall, less than a foot away from each other and Potter’s hand still clutching at Draco’s fingers.
Harry reaches over and squeezes her shoulder. “I believe in you, and I know Neville and Blaise do too. We’ll get through this.”
He looks—content. Usually he feels a lot guiltier when he’s standing in front of the mirror, staring at Potter like this.
But he’s tired, so he’s glad when Harry flops down beside him with a groan. Draco grabs his wand and casts a muttered cleaning charm over both of them, which thankfully rids his skin of the sticky, sweaty feeling that he hates.
Draco gives him an embarrassed look. “It feels so good when you say that,” he says. “I want—I want…”
, Harry remembers dimly, and that thought hurts. “You didn’t,” he says, aching at the thought of Draco not loving him mere minutes ago. “You didn’t really miss me, before.”
“Oi, you liked it too,” Harry protests, but he’s unable to stop himself from grinning back, heart aching with the weight of his love for the man in front of him—for Draco. His Draco. “And anyway,” Harry says softly, reaching down to hold Draco’s hand. “Wasn’t it fun to pretend?”
“It’s the truth, Harry!” Draco sits up, staring at him urgently. “And if you don’t want to leave…” He trails off, looking conflicted.
“No, just—listen,” Draco says. “I’m an arsehole sometimes. A lot of times, honestly. I don’t like to talk about my feelings, and I’m not really… I don’t like myself very much either. So. I want you to think about it, really think about it. If you want to be with me, I mean.”
“By the way,” Hermione says. “Would you all mind if I recorded your genetic information? Just to test my methods on, so if there really are big differences between Pureblood and non-Pureblood DNA, I’ll be able to pick them up by comparing the samples.”
, willingly holding him even though Draco isn’t crying anymore, and Draco doesn’t have the strength to tell him to stop.
And there is Potter, who somehow always knows what to say, even when Draco doesn’t have the faintest idea.
“Potter...” Malfoy says, looking for the first time as if he’s been caught off guard. He looks away. “Well. Usually I at least make potential suitors take me out for drinks beforehand.”
been in love before? He’s not actually sure, because every previous sexual encounter he can remember pales in comparison to this moment, to the desperate way he yearns to touch Draco even as Draco fucks into him—to the way Draco starts making little sighs and whimpers into his ear, ones that even sound like his name.
“There’s a sex shop on Diagon, if you know where to find it,” Blaise tells him. “And as for why… Listen, old pal. We all love you very much.” He pauses, and as the rest of them nod in agreement, Draco gets the overwhelming sense that this is some sort of planned intervention. Bloody hell. “But you’ve been whinging on about not getting laid for
“That wasn’t a big deal,” Harry says, because it wasn’t. His relationship with Ginny had unraveled pretty much the same way everything else in his life had at the time, slowly slipping away until he turned to look and realized it was gone. “I started working as a ward-builder with the Ministry after I quit the Aurors. I have a flat down a side-street of Diagon.” He shrugs and tries not to think about how his life is patently uninteresting nowadays—he gets up and he works too much and sometimes he sees Ron and Hermione and the rest of the Weasleys, and then he goes home. Sometimes if he focuses on his routine enough, he can almost forget about the war, about how lonely and angry he is and the terrible, messy turns his life has taken.
Harry closed his eyes again, wondering at how Malfoy had not yet told him to leave. He was also surprised at himself, however—since when had he had the energy to make conversation, much less have a friendly argument? Lately, every time he had talked to someone, he’d wanted it over with as quickly as possible. When Ginny had finally left their conversation the other night, citing tiredness, he’d felt a wave of relief even though she was a great friend. And she didn’t cause him nearly as much grief as his ‘adoring fans’ did whenever he was in public.
He bids Esther goodbye, turning and pushing through the curtain that separates the store area from the back of the shop. This is where he truly spends most of his time—it’s where they keep their inventory, on neat shelves that Harry would never been able to organize without Esther’s (and a little bit of Hermione’s) help, and it’s also where Harry does the bulk of his charmwork.
But Potter has escaped Draco’s grasp yet again, has left him hanging unrequited, another bid for friendship scorned.
“Okay,” Harry says. “You know… if you’re looking for something to get your mind off things for a little while, the Love department isn’t bad to visit. I go after work sometimes. It’s… calming. Though, I suppose it depends on the scent of the Amortentia at the moment,” he adds, wrinkling his nose as he thinks back to when they’d been dosed with it.
“Fuck, Potter,” Draco sighs, and how many times has he said those words in this room? But even his most vivid mirror fantasies couldn’t compare to the way Potter’s skin is hot beneath his hands when Draco slides them up the back of Potter’s shirt, and the sound of mirror-Potter moaning is really only a faint echo of the way the
“He won’t go with me either,” Pansy chimes in from on the sofa next to Blaise, tucking one stockinged foot underneath her.
Harry’s face flames. He can’t meet Malfoy’s eyes. “I dunno,” he says, throwing absolutely all of his caution out the window. “What if I am?”
“Honestly? Sometimes,” Malfoy admits. “But I shouldn’t have said some of those things. You’re—” He swallows, hard, and looks as if he wishes he didn’t have to say what he’s currently about to. “You’re the only one here that gives a damn I exist, and I can’t... I can’t piss you off. But I can’t rely on you either, because then you’ll be—you’ll be too important, and when you decide you’ve done your job and helped me learn painting, you’ll leave and...” He clamps his mouth shut. “I’ll stop talking. This is stupid.”
Draco’s breath hitches, and suddenly he realizes why Mother was hiding the letter. He’s sure she’s noticed that Potter isn’t here today, noticed Draco’s corresponding surliness. “I’m glad for you,” he says honestly.
him—“I’ll, um,” Draco says, grabbing his wand and casting his usual lubrication charm. He’s about to add the stretching charm, too, when Potter stops him.
Harry’s face goes red. “It’s just—a lot.” Because, yeah, he still wants to have sex with Draco. A lot. And seeing Draco half naked is just… too much.
Of course, that doesn’t stop him from dropping to his knees a moment later and reaching for the waistband of Potter’s pajamas, gasping at the way Potter’s already hard and pushing against the fabric. “D-Draco,” Potter says, “You don’t have to, really—”
“Potter,” Draco gasps, letting Potter climb on top of him. He’s almost surprised to find that he’s hardening again, prick twitching against his belly, but then again—it’s
“What are we looking for, exactly?” Harry asks. He’s just been taking brief notes on each of the sections in hopes that it might help later on.
“You could’ve warned us,” Trainee Two says, voice surly. But halfway through her sentence, her voice begins to change—with a start, Harry realizes that the identity charms are slipping off, melting away like water down the drain.
Draco stares back. “Wait—fuck,” he says, sitting up. His wings had retracted at some point during their sleep, and all Harry can see are the slight bumps in his back indicating where they once were when Draco climbs out of bed, aiming his wand at the lantern in the corner to light it.
“Could you light one of the torches?” he asks Potter eventually, and for a moment Potter looks confused.
Harry thinks he’s okay with that. There’s hope in his chest that wasn’t there before, and he stands up, setting his glass on the coffee table and moving over to the Floo.
The bleeping of the television censor rings in Harry’s ears, but then the screen turns off. He blinks, then looks down at his lap, where Draco’s hand has hit the “off” button on the remote.
So now he’s here in a last ditch effort to distract himself. Maybe all he really needs right now is sex.
Draco doesn’t hesitate to answer. “No,” he says, shaking his head, and Harry shivers a sigh of relief. “Not at all. You… you were willing to give all of this up—" Draco gestures at the way their bodies are pressed together—“just to make me happy. And that speaks volumes.”
Draco wipes his mouth and his hand comes away with blood. “I have no fucking idea,” he says roughly.
It occurs to him that he’s waited years for this moment, to be sitting together with Potter almost like equals, but now that it’s happening, he doesn’t really know what to say. There’s too many years’ worth of fucked up things between them, and he’s starting to think that most of them were his own fault.
Then Draco looks at her and slowly starts putting two and two together—the impromptu shopping trip, Potter mentioning her name… “Astoria?”
“There’s a restaurant nearby that sells Muggle cuisine. Hamburgers, and the like,” Malfoy tells him.
They kiss until, beside them, the water starts to boil. Draco sighs through his nose and pulls away, leaving Harry with an armful of longing where Draco had been.
“Are you going to keep calling me Potter forever?” Harry retorts instead, and he knows he’s probably grinning like a loon but he can’t bring himself to care.
“Yes, my father’s a racist arsehole, but it’s not what you’re thinking—Mother’s probably part Veela, at any rate.” He pauses, scrunching up his face as if trying to remember, then he shrugs. “No matter. Anyway, he disowned me because I’m gay, not because I’m a vampire.”
Draco swallows around the sudden lump of emotion that seems to be blocking his throat. “I didn’t say that.”
“I mean, we’d never be doing this without the Amortentia,” Malfoy says, measuring out the potion. “Ridiculous, wouldn’t it be?”
Draco gives him a look. “Come on, Harry,” he drawls, and he looks so good with the water running down his chest and his pants tight against his skin that Harry can’t help but follow, carefully leaving his glasses on the side of the pool before splashing in.
“I dunno,” Potter says. “I think he was making weird assumptions. He might’ve thought we really were dating after all.”
“I basically told you I’ve fancied you for years, and yet you’re still shocked?” Draco says, grinning at him mischievously. “Merlin, you must be just as thick as I always used to think you were.”
you for it later, for taking pity on the poor Death Eater—I’m not going to stand for it. I’m not your next
“Then there’s no one to blame,” Ginny says. “Anyway, I guess I’m stuck here for a while, but I suppose I’ll get out someday. Either all the Purebloods in the world will get sick and it won’t be considered a contagion anymore, or you’ll crack it and we’ll all be cured. And I’m definitely betting on the latter,” she adds, grinning fiercely.
“You are,” Draco says, and then slaps a hand over his mouth. “You’re really—fuck. See, I can’t stop myself. I can’t
That was sure anti-climactic, Harry concludes as he turns to leave the room, but then he hears Malfoy shifting behind him.
“Not ’til I say,” Potter says, grinning, and Draco lets out a moan. Potter tilts his head, looking up at him as if he possibly thinks the world of Draco—which is
But he can’t convince himself it’s a bad enough idea to stop, and when Potter pushes his knees up high and climbs over him, Draco can only clutch at Potter’s waist.
“I’m not sure,” Draco says, in answer to a question he’s already forgotten. He scrambles for something else to say. “Unfortunately I’m not privy to that kind of thing.”
Finally, Draco sighs, pushing his face into Potter’s neck. “I’m going to wait to say it again,” he decides.
going to sleep together?” Malfoy asks, eyebrows rising. “Don’t you realize how absurd that is? We’ve been practically enemies for half our lives, so pardon me if I don’t fucking trust you.”
Harry can’t take it anymore, arousal pulsing so strongly in his veins he can’t think. “Come here,” he says, his voice losing its stern tone, coming out needy instead, because he
means, that this has happened so easily, this culmination of wanting that’s been going on for weeks or even months. Maybe they’re moving too fast, or this really is just a bad idea. But Harry doesn’t want to stop. He wants desperately for this to be good, for Draco to look at him and maybe love him back.
“No,” Draco says, squeezing his hand. “He’s not, don’t worry. I’d be far more distraught about him being sick if he were.” He raises an eyebrow. “Anyway, you should stop asking who my mate is, or someday you’ll run out of people and I’ll have to tell you.”
It sounds simple enough. They have to prepare for their lives now—for life after the war. Beside Harry, Hermione beams in excitement, surely at the prospect of really digging her teeth into research.
“God, I’ve been an idiot,” Draco says, looking down at him with a rueful smile on his face. “I ran away instead of really thinking about what—what we could’ve been.”
“Well, they didn’t try to sell you out to Voldemort, did they?” Potter mutters, his eyes going hard, and Draco drops his fork.
so fucking hard, fumbling through endless days full of guilt and shame to atone for his sins from five years prior. It’s the reason he’d become an Auror—he’d been determined to fight back, to show everyone that he was more than just Death Eater scum, blindly following his father’s twisted ideals.
It occurs to him that he’s not even sure he wants to be alive anymore. He can’t even remember the last time he wanted something.
, after all. He can do whatever he wants to. “You know what? Do it. I don’t care,” Draco says, and turns away.
“You’ll be fine,” Harry reassured for what was probably the tenth time that week. “Tell you what? Why don’t we go to London on the weekend? We’ve been stuck here for a while.”
So he reaches up blindly to find Draco’s hand, pulling it down to rest against his own hair, and Draco thankfully takes the hint, curling his hand into Harry’s curls and using his grip to urge him faster.
The week continues in much the same way. It’s fine, really, it is—it has to be, because it’s probably going to be this way for the rest of their damned lives—like hell he’s
“You’ll let me do this…” Draco murmured, and he was actually crying now. “But you don’t want me. You don’t want me enough to fucking get over yourself.”
“Yes,” Harry says, and Draco gives him a heated look, kissing him then, over and over until Harry can barely think.
Draco nods, clinging to him as they make their way over to the sofa. Then they curl up together, Draco’s long limbs pressing up against Harry’s, and happiness dances in Harry’s chest as he runs a hand through Draco’s hair. Draco sighs, leaning into it, and then he presses his face into Harry’s neck and whispers, “I missed you so fucking much.”
Her words leave Harry with the feeling that, somehow, this might actually end up all right. So he nods, relaxing next to her, trying to push away the feeling that he’s just thrown away his entire future, that it’s okay, it’s
They take off. The wind whips in his face and he flies circles around Potter, whooping, not even caring how he might look or sound. Potter matches him, laughing, zipping along, always nearby, and for a moment they forget even about the Snitch as they fly around the grounds together.
He flits his eyes over the stock as he does every morning, making a mental note that the self-scrubbing pots will need to be restocked soon, and that he’s going to have to order some more chairs for his Easy-Shrink line. Oh, and he seems to be rather low on unbreakable dishes, which is funny because he doesn’t seem to remember having sold quite that many this week. He almost walks back into the shopfront to ask Esther about it, but just as he reaches the curtain, he hears the bell that signals their first customer of the morning and decides to let it go for now. Better for her to be open for customer questions than to be bothered with Harry’s spotty memory.
But Potter lets Draco touch him, and when the desperation finally grows enough in Draco’s lungs that he breaks and says, “Please,” Potter’s eyes soften.
Then, as quick and fleeting as a Snitch, she darts out of the room, closing the door behind her. She has no idea what she’s done, does she?
Soft lips, wet against his, the taste of salt and yearning. It changed him. Before, as he’d been told as a child, his worst fear had been fear itself. He’d learned to battle the darkness, had dealt with being alone just fine. But everything was different now, and he could tell because he was no longer most frightened of fear. He was frightened of losing Draco.
And Ginny—well, Ginny and Pansy are just late. As usual. Ginny often stays after practice to help give extra instruction to the Harpies’ Reserve Chasers, and it’s not unheard of for Pansy to get so caught up in writing her gossip articles for her up-and-coming magazine
Not to mention that his year spent doing nothing had taught him that the Aurors were neither his top career choice, nor the most trustworthy people. Yes, there were those who valued justice and fairness, but when Death Eaters were involved it became an entirely different story. He’d heard whispers of forged documents and Confunded eyewitnesses involved in the capture of more than a few Voldemort sympathizers. Everyone had. And he’d turned a blind eye. They had deserved it… right?
Of course, it’s just as Harry’s standing there in the middle of the sidewalk trying to convince himself to leave before he makes a stupid decision that Malfoy catches sight of him.
“I agree,” Hermione says, reaching over to pat Harry’s arm. “I won’t tell him either, but—we do both care about you, Harry. If you ever need to talk, I’m listening.”
Harry kisses him deeply, the rhythm of his hips stuttering, and Malfoy meets him eagerly, urging him faster with hands gripping at his hips, his waist.
If they could just slow down the curse’s progression, it would be easier to study, one of the Curse Breakers said. Right now, it’s simply too quick, too unpredictable, barely even responding to their diagnostic spells.
“Are you all right? It’s not a big deal,” Potter says. “I just figured that’s what it looks like anyway.”
Harry leaned his head back. “Yeah, wouldn’t it…” He stared at the ceiling, calming himself down bit by bit. He hadn’t been that angry in a very long time.
“Draco?” Blaise says cautiously, interrupting Draco’s train of thought, and Draco realizes with no small amount of embarrassment that he’s been staring at the package in front of him for almost a solid minute. “Sorry to pick on your love life,” Blaise says, sounding worried. “I didn’t think it was that much of a sore topic.”
There’s a bit of an awkward silence for a moment, and then Potter puts his mug down only half empty. Draco’s almost afraid he’s going to leave, so he blurts out—“I can show you my documents, if you like. I mean, the financial documents for the company. I have copies—”
” he says, and then anger erupts in his chest all at once, choking him—and before he even knows it, he’s standing up and striding toward Harry—and then he slaps him.
Then he collapses in his bed, laying facedown for as long as he can stand. When he turns aside to breathe, tears threaten to prick at his eyes, and he has to swallow them back.
He shook his head, trying to head her off. “Malfoy’s just…” a great kisser, his mind supplied unhelpfully. “…aggravating, is all.”
Well, two’s company, as it was said. If Malfoy was scared, then Harry supposed the least he could do would be to admit the same. Anything to say to stop Malfoy from leaving—and the realization that he didn’t, in fact, want Malfoy to leave was more telling than anything.
Draco’s eyes soften, and he bites his lip, looking Harry up and down. “I sure hope not. I mean, I do love you.” He swallows, a strange expression coming over his eyes. “Very much.”
Potter’s quiet for a moment, and Draco almost thinks he’s getting ready to yell again, but when Draco looks up at him, Potter looks contemplative instead. “I wish you were more comfortable with it, maybe,” Potter says, then blinks and shakes his head. “Er, that was weird. Forget I said anything.”
He turns back to look at the first years. As they watch, three others join the table, pushing in to see. One of the two playing, a young girl with a thick braid, pokes her tongue out and reaches for one of the cards. But she must make a wrong move, because all at once the cards explode, and several in the group jump before they all start laughing and chattering with excitement.
“Sorry about that,” Potter says sheepishly. “I didn’t think about it, just—your skin is so soft,” he says, his tone full of admiration, and it’s such an honest compliment that Draco shivers.
“I’d like that,” Potter says. “If you, er, wouldn’t mind me ruining your fun? I mean. You probably want to go alone…”
Potter doesn’t seem to have the same reservations. “Why are you looking at me like that?” Potter asks once, just after Draco’s watched him bid the bookstore clerk farewell with a cheery smile.
Harry can feel his own face crumple. He shakes his head, mouth trembling. Quietly, he says, “He doesn’t want me there.”
Then Draco presses him down against the bedspread and kisses him in a way that feels possessive, feral, and Harry’s body sings as he kisses back with as much intensity as he can give.
Almost as an afterthought, Malfoy spells his shirt off too, leaving only the tie. Harry’s nipples go hard in the cold air of the bedroo—er,
Except that ever since they both kind of sort of admitted they wouldn’t mind having sex with each other, it’s all Harry can think about.
But when he goes home, lying in bed, staring at the ceiling—when he closes his eyes, pulling the covers up around him—all he can think of is Draco, and how much he misses having him in his bed.
,’ like a wish, like a prayer; thinks of how Draco melted into him, kissed his mouth, his cheek, his chest. Draco is the only warm, bright thing left, and when Harry pushes him away, it feels like there will be nothing but darkness.
“Maybe not,” Draco admits, and then he pushes Harry’s hand away from where Harry’s still trying to touch him. “Just let me,” he says, and then he speeds the rhythm of his fist on Harry’s cock until Harry tenses, curling tightly into him, groaning as he comes.
Draco sighs and pulls him into a hug, and then tilts his head and presses a soft kiss to the mark on Harry’s neck. “I should heal this better,” he mumbles into Harry’s skin, turning to grab for his wand, but Harry stops him.
So they’re in the ‘dungeons’, then. Harry closes his eyes and allows himself to pretend. It helps that he can barely see anything from his position against the wall, so all he really has to do is imagine that the carpet beneath his feet is the stone flooring of the corridor instead, that the Malfoy behind him really
Harry lets out an unexpected chuckle as he stands and moves back to his stool. Malfoy is kind of funny. Sometimes. “So,” he says, eyes trailing over Malfoy as he sits primly in the chair. “What is it you wanted to talk about?”
Draco puzzles it over. He supposes it could be any number of things, considering all the awful circumstances Potter’s had to go through, but as he takes in Potter’s frown and reserved posture, it slowly occurs to him—“You won’t tell me because it has to do with me, doesn’t it?”
The flames spluttered and died. Draco lowered his wand, gasping, then shouted the spell again, sending another burst of fire into the air.
looking,” Harry says, and it shouldn’t make him feel so vindicated that Malfoy’s been paying attention to him—it’s
And that’s how he ends up in Draco’s kitchen, helping him find various materials for pasta and listening to him chat away about the raid.
It’s—fuck. It’s more than Draco could even have imagined, finally getting to taste him, the feeling of Potter’s lips soft and pliant against his own, Potter’s tongue darting briefly into his mouth and sending sparks down his spine.
“I’m just thinking…” Potter sighs. “Last night—you couldn’t have said no, could you? You were too drunk, and… I dunno, Hermione’s always on about not coercing people into things, but you seemed so—enthusiastic about it all, and now you don’t even remember it.” He swallows, looking guilty. “I basically forced you to take me home with you, didn’t I?”
“Draco… oh, Draco,” Potter says, and the next moment Potter is circling the table, sitting next to him, pulling him into a hug, and
“For Merlin’s sake—give me that,” Draco mutters, snatching the vial from Potter’s hand and Summoning a cup to measure the potion into. Honestly, he ought to Vanish the damned thing.
Harry flushes, partially because he should have known about the sunscreen charms and partially because Draco is gorgeous with his shirt off. He leans over and runs a hand down Draco’s side. “Mm. I could live here forever.”
“I’m happy for you.” And for Ron and Hermione, he meant it, even though his voice had threatened to crack. They deserved nothing other than happiness.
Hermione seems to perk up slightly at that. “That would be a great help, actually,” she says. “There are some threads I’d like to follow that I haven’t had time to read into.”
Inexplicably, he thinks of how it felt to have Malfoy’s body pressed against his own, hands painfully tight on his wrists, and he has to squeeze his eyes shut to scrub the image from his brain.
“We have to go home together, obviously,” Potter says. Potter is very good at making him feel like an idiot. Draco is already loathing the next couple of days, stuck to Potter like this—
“Unexpected is an understatement,” Ron says, arching his brow. “You two look happier than I would’ve thought.”
, I want—I want your fingers, p-please,” Draco babbles, gasping for air, and Potter grins and sits up. He slicks his fingers with lube and casts a subtle cleaning charm at his own mouth, and then that finger is back, running in circles around Draco’s hole and then pushing in.
It takes all of Harry’s concentration to flip the book over and actually read the title—something about curse-breaking. “Have your bloody book back,” he says, trying to turn to hand the book to him and expecting Malfoy to move away.
He had to escape then, walking quickly to his room and closing the door. He plunked his box down on the floor, not even bothering to open it because—Draco. Merlin. Pressing his palm to his erection, he willed it to go away because he did not fancy having a wank right now.
“What—what happened?” Harry asks. Sweat is still drying on his skin from meeting Malfoy at the motel. He wonders if he smells like him too, and abruptly feels ashamed.
“No,” Malfoy says, his tone mocking. “You’re friends with him because you’ve got a savior complex bigger than the castle grounds.”
Draco whirls around to look at the Potter standing next to him, eyes wide. “You—you tried to kiss me!”
Harry tumbles onto the sheets, pulling Draco down with him, and this time when they kiss it’s softer, more like the other times, full of a warm fluttering that insists on stirring in Harry’s gut. They kiss until Harry almost forgets they’d been fighting, almost forgets how nervous he is, and then they keep kissing still.
Slowly, Harry feels the tension leave his limbs. “Oh,” he says, and he thinks he’s starting to get it.
He feels like he’s in a daze as he enters the fountain room, excruciatingly aware of the fact that Draco’s two steps behind him—and as soon as he takes a breath in he wants to leave, because the entire fucking room smells just like Draco, the fucking
“You’re asking my secrets, now? Don’t you know that Slytherins never share parts of themselves unless it gives them an advantage?”
Harry’s tempted to look for him on the Marauder’s Map, to try and see where he goes when Harry can’t find him, but—
Hoping his desire didn’t show on his face, he breathed an unsteady breath and wondered at his situation. Figuring out his feelings was far more terrifying than he’d expected. And besides… even if he did like Malfoy, he really didn’t think he was cut out for a relationship right now. Even Ginny had mentioned that he looked glum, and if he was really being honest, he felt glum, too.
Malfoy squints down at the hairbrush. “Oh,” he says, lips pursing. “I guess one of the Elves… well, whatever. Can you fix it or not, Potter? I’ll pay.”
“Malfoy?” Harry says hesitantly. Malfoy’s done with the painting, or at least he seems to be—he’s put down his wand arm and stopped murmuring strings of incantations, anyway. Except he’s still staring intently at the canvas, saying nothing at all, and after another moment, Harry tries again. “Malfoy? Can I... see?”
Privately, Harry thinks that sounds like a shit reason. He’s about to say so, except then Malfoy speaks again.
He dreams that Potter is there, sitting next to where he lies on the bed, the light of the sunrise making his face glow and his eyes impossibly green. Draco lets himself smile at Potter, and Potter smiles back, summoning a warm, fragile happiness in Draco’s chest.
Draco awakens to birds chirping outside his window, and for a moment he can almost pretend this is a normal early summer day, that he’ll go downstairs and find his father reading the paper and his mother tending to the garden.
“Harry,” Harry corrects, laughing again, sliding his knuckles up against Draco’s cheek and making his eyelids flutter.
“I’m just so worried about time,” Hermione says, brows knitting together. “The first patients are getting sicker, and I wasn’t even able to find a way to slow down the disease, let alone stop it. This virus is really good at multiplying out of control, even when I try to Vanish it, and that’s risky in the first place. And there are other Healers working on it too—none of us has found anything helpful at all.”
“Oh,” Malfoy says, nodding. “Right.” He leans back, taking out his wand and murmuring a charm, and Harry watches as far above him, a neat outline of the relevant stars is formed, the makings of a dragon in the sky. “You can’t see all of it from here without Astronomy magic, but that’s most of it.”
Harry flushes, unable to look away from the way Draco’s fingers are sinking deep inside of him. “You are,” he says. “I want you.”
Pretending he doesn’t see the expression Potter throws at him, one that’s wounded and let down and reminds Draco a bit of the puppy Pansy had as a child, Draco turns and Disapparates.
it feels good. Clenching his teeth, Harry hooks his hands behind his knees and pulls them higher, feeling a small amount of delight in the way Malfoy can’t withhold a moan the next time he presses in.
“I’d like that, okay?” Draco says, and he briefly looks around the room, probably to ensure no one’s watching before focusing back in on Potter.
Draco wants to stare back, but he doesn’t. Only in the morning hours, when Potter hasn’t yet woken up, does he allow himself to look at Potter’s face, the curve of his mouth and eyes and the dark stubble that grows overnight on his brown skin. He wants to touch it, and doesn’t; he catches himself fantasizing about kissing him all the time now, and doesn’t do that either.
Harry’s again caught up in the fact that Malfoy is probably going to end up fucking someone else tonight. He doesn’t realize he’s scowling until Malfoy elbows him lightly in the side.
“Listen,” Malfoy says, and there’s venom in his voice, a sense of anger he hasn’t felt from Malfoy since before the war ended. “You’re doing me a favor and I thanked you for it. That doesn’t make me your fucking
“Already courting… shite,” Draco says, and then he slumps into Harry’s back, wraps his arms around Harry’s waist, and closes his eyes.
Draco whips his head around. There’s no one there, of course, and he turns back to the mirror, jaw dropping open. “What the fuck are you doing?”
“I gathered that very early on in life and decided to go with it,” Draco says. “It’s your fault if you can’t deal with it.”
“Surely you must have at school,” Draco says, frowning a bit, and Harry aches to kiss away the lines of stress in his face.
“That’s bloody awful,” Harry says, eyes widening. Briefly, he tries to think of a life without magic, one where he could no longer cast spells or fly a broom. He’d have to close his shop—hell, he would never be able to work in the Wizarding World again. And with the Muggle-repelling charms in effect too, he wouldn’t be able to get into Diagon on his own, much less see Hogwarts again. A shudder ripples down his spine at the thought, and beside him, Luna frowns.
“He’s not too old for you-u,” she says in a sing-songy tone, and then she darts back into the front of the shop before Harry can say a word.
Harry awakens from a nightmare, lungs poised to scream, and has to force himself to relax. It’s certainly not the first time he’s grateful for Silencing Charms at night, not even the first time this week, and he’s barely been back for three days now.
It’s only because it reminds him of Will, he tells himself. Will, with his dimples and brown hair, who left the morning after Harry tried to propose without a look back even though Harry loved him more than he ever loved anyone before.
Draco laughs and leans down to give him a long, slow kiss. Then he sits up, finally pulling off of Harry and curling into his chest.
“No, not at all,” Harry says, frowning. “As long as you still want to?” He tries and fails to swallow back the sudden fear building in his throat, the fear that Malfoy will suddenly change his mind, that he’ll get up and leave Harry’s house and stop coming by the shop, that he’ll go right back to ignoring him just as he has for years.
For a long moment, nothing happens. Draco’s starting to think this is some sort of sick joke when, ever so slowly, an image starts to appear on the mirror’s surface.
Malfoy’s face goes all flushed, and he looks away. “You know. You always say it. When—when we’re on the Amortentia, I mean.”
“I wouldn’t be surprised if you pulled out some grandiose gesture to try to woo me,” Draco says, smirking, and Harry snorts.
So, for obvious reasons, Draco can’t tell his friends about any of this. He has too much pride, for one, and also dating Potter is a bloody
The wave of pleasure between Draco’s hips finally reaches its peak, and he feels himself implode, loses himself in the feeling of Potter’s skin on his and the warm burning in his arse. He clings to Potter’s hand, his body, as he spurts out between them, clenching around Potter on a stream of whimpers—and then Potter’s coming too, pressing his face into Draco’s chest as his whole body goes silently taut, fucking into him until he’s too soft to push in anymore.
“Come on, come for me,” Potter says, pressing the words into Draco’s jaw, and Draco stops thinking and just lets himself feel—Potter thick inside him, Potter’s arms boxing him against the mattress, Potter’s lips on his jaw, his cheek.
“Oh, that’s the restaurant,” Malfoy says, pointing over at a small shopfront a few strides ahead of them.
He waits there for a moment, hearing the sound of clothes rustling, most likely Malfoy getting undressed. He doesn't look—Malfoy never told him he could move. All he can do is wait.
“That’s mine,” Draco stopped him. Harry glanced down at it. Predictably, ‘Draco Malfoy’ was emblazoned clearly across the top.
Draco clasps his hands against his chin and thinks about it. “I’d mourn,” he says truthfully. He can’t imagine life without Astoria. He doesn’t even know if he’d want to go to work, or do anything at all, really. He would just want to sit around at home. “Maybe sell the Manor,” he adds, because honestly he can’t imagine staying there alone for the rest of his life. The only reason Mother was able to convince him to keep it for now is because the wards offer special protections for Malfoys who reside there, meaning it’s safer for Astoria.
And Harry did feel guilty, extremely so. Because Draco loved him in every little glance, even as he poked fun at Harry or nagged at him for leaving his socks around the main room.
“Still,” she says, “That’s better news for the patients than I’ve heard in the last two weeks. Which says something about the state of the Healing department right now—no doubt my coworkers will be happy to hear that too.”
Draco sleeps well that night, surprisingly enough. He supposes it’s because he’s exhausted or depressed or some combination of the two. Either way, it won’t matter soon enough.
“You know, I haven’t had sex in—I dunno. A year or two? I don’t just... go around fucking whoever I want. And when I tried to, it didn’t work,” he says, a little disgruntled as he gestures between himself and Malfoy. “My life is boring and pitiful, remember?”
“Look, Harry!” Hermione whispers, nudging his elbow, and he’s jolted back to the present—a present where he’s sitting in the middle of a crowded Great Hall, starry sky twinkling above and murmuring students surrounding him like a never-ending ocean. “The first years are lining up.” Hermione tilts her head toward the door.
And then they sit at his kitchen table and Malfoy pulls out the vial of Amortentia, setting it between them. Harry stares it down like it’s an adversary in Wizarding chess, ready to knock him out at the slightest provocation. He clenches his teeth.
“Potter, you’ve been looking at me like you want to eat me instead of the other way around,” Draco tells him. “It’s rather obvious.”
He lets out a sigh of relief when he sees Malfoy’s name at their spot by the lake, and he heads over, practically jogging by the time he reaches the grounds. Malfoy is alone there, his back hunched as he sits facing the water, a letter dangling from his fingertips. Harry slows down, catching his breath as he walks closer. “Are you all right?”
“I don’t think that’s how it works, Potter,” Draco says, sounding half amused and half like he might just want this too.
cock, thick and swollen and pink in the flickering torchlight. Draco nearly chokes at the sight. God, if he could only touch—
“I’ve heard sex with non-mates described as varying between vaguely uncomfortable and excruciatingly painful, yes,” Malfoy says, folding his arms across himself. “It’s not really a risk I’d enjoy taking.”
Usually with mirror-Potter, Draco keeps his eyes open, staring at Potter’s face or his chest or their hips moving together. Now that it’s real—now that he can
Malfoy wrinkles his nose. “I can hardly go a day without the media shoving all of the great Harry Potter’s fantastical deeds in my face. You can’t expect me to actually pay attention to all that rot.” He still hasn’t moved from his spot just inside the curtain, as if he’s so affronted at being in the same room with Harry that he won’t dare move closer.
“Fine, fine,” Malfoy says, looking as if another eye roll isn’t too far off the horizon. “If a Veela doesn’t
When Harry finally rolls off of Draco, he doesn’t go far, instead spooning himself along Draco’s back and holding him tight. “I’m a cuddler, I’ll warn you now,” Harry murmurs against the base of his neck.
So he slips his hands downward, feeling much more nervous than when he’d started, and starts to unbutton his trousers. Thank God he’s not turned on right now, because he doesn’t think he could bear the embarrassment of getting hard in front of Malfoy.
“But Ron—surely he would’ve mentioned it?” Hermione said dubiously. “If he was dating again, after Will?”
Harry looks up at him, still holding the letter, his hand trembling. “It’s Gin,” he says. “She’s caught it—she’s sick.”
It hurts so much to hear Draco say that, so much that Harry nearly does just that. But he’s feeling brazen and rather reckless at this point, because either way their relationship is going to be over, right?
,” Draco chokes out, pulling out and pressing back in, hot and thick inside him. Then he sets up a frantic rhythm, grasping at Harry, and Harry attempts the best he can at this angle to push back toward him and meet him at every other thrust. It’s messy and hot and feels so fucking
He thinks of last time they drank the potion, when he let it slip that he missed Harry. He wasn’t lying.
“Why not?” Harry asks, watching as the tip of Draco’s cock disappears into his hand and then appears again. He wants to suck it, he thinks. Fuck.
It’s been just over an hour by the time Harry returns to the common room. Malfoy stayed behind to clean up, and Harry’s grateful—he’s not sure what he would’ve said if Hermione saw them walking back in together. He’s definitely not ready for the questions that would bring.
“I’ve thought about it a lot. Even when I was angry with you, or sad that you left…” He swallows thickly. “I still couldn’t stop thinking about you. Because I want to
Briefly, he closes his eyes. This is too much, too much to have all of these feelings come surging back, washing over him, breaking through the dams that he thought were stable, flooding his senses with the ghosts of emotions that are far too strong for their own good.
Draco’s prick twitches in his jeans. Fuck. He hurriedly turns toward the door, gesturing with one hand and saying, “Let’s go in.”
about budgeting or profit margins or haggling with distributors when Draco accepted the position, and Draco has been more than happy to handle that ever since.
,” the mirror says. “You’ve literally fucked him in front of me dozens of times. You have to tell him.”
Looking down, Hermione licks her lips. “I just have a feeling that there’s more to this than he’s told you,” she says quietly. “I won’t tell you my suspicions, just in case I’m wrong, but. I think you should go see him.”
Harry is out shopping when he feels a light tap on his shoulder, turning to see a slight woman with dark hair and pretty eyes. She’s holding a basket containing only a baguette and a block of cheese. “Er,” he says, “Sorry, was I in the way?”
Which is where they are now, in Potter’s memory, past-Draco looking very flustered as past-Potter walks up to him wearing only a skin-tight pair of leather trousers. Fucking Lovegood and her insistence that everyone be true to themselves and allow their attractions to be unfettered for that one day—not that Draco had
“Ah—f-fuck,” Harry gasps, bucking toward Malfoy. Then Malfoy pulls away, and he lets out a groan of disappointment.
The trees were one of the only things in the garden that survived after Voldemort took over the manor. Everything else wilted. The heaviness of the dark magic that filled the Manor then was too much for the delicate plants to flourish.
“You always call me Potter when you’re trying to tell me off,” he says, and his hand is so close and Draco
He nearly groans. “Fuck,” he mumbles, blushing. He can feel himself growing hard in response, and he knows Draco will be able to feel it too—
“Right,” Draco says, and his breath is starting to go ragged. “I’m thinking of sucking you off right now. I want—um.”
Hughes interrupts them by walking back over with a creaky-looking wooden chair Levitated in front of him. He sets it down with a dull thunk next to the similar chair already at the desk, then nods once. “There,” he says, brushing his hands off as if he’d gotten them dusty. “Feel free to read any of the books we’ve got lying around here. I’ll be over there if you need me.” He points with a bony finger to another desk across the small room.
When he’s done reading it the second time, he’s surprised that the ink has somehow gone all splotchy in places, and when he reaches a hand up he realizes there’s wetness on his cheeks.
But then a noise makes them both jump, and it’s not coming from Potter—instead, it’s the sharp clicking of heels as someone joins them in the chamber.
Draco breaks the kiss a moment later, raising a knuckle to stroke across Harry’s cheek and making him shiver. “Get your wand,” Draco says, and then proceeds to straddle him, fuck.
Harry’s about five strokes in, pressing inside Draco in tandem with his hand, when Draco cries out and comes—“Oh,
Harry is lost completely, he thinks, whimpering every time he sinks down onto Malfoy, wanting to come so badly he could cry, but he
“Then tell me,” Draco says finally, twisting his hands in his lap. “Tell me why you kept lying about the Amortentia.”
Which is unfortunate because Draco can feel himself getting hard again, and Potter snickers beside him.
“Yeah, I mean,” Harry says, shrugging. “It’s like you said. I know you better than the others. And it’s not like you’re not fit.”
to ask what he’s thinking. It’s obvious from the hard set of Malfoy’s shoulders and the derision in his brow—not to mention that ever-present sneer—that he’s back to regarding Harry with utter contempt.
But it seems that’s going to be a difficult task when his coworkers have turned out to be Malfoy and three others who can’t see past his fame.
tried,” Draco says, and he’s being honest—Potter’s done more for him than anyone on this damned planet.
“Shouldn’t you follow the instructions, though?” Harry asks tritely, barely concealing a grin as Malfoy dances backwards to try and avoid him.
He’d have fallen in love, Draco thinks as they towel off. With just a little more time, he’d have fallen in love.
Harry shudders as a strong wave of attraction rushes through him. God. He could stay like this for the rest of his life and be happier than he’s ever been.
Draco’s mouth goes dry. He feels unsteady, teetering dangerously on the edge of despair, but just as he thinks his legs might give way, Potter’s backing him toward the bed, catching him in his arms and holding him safe.
He wants to be the name Malfoy groans out when he comes, and not even in a romantic way, really—it was just infuriatingly hot the last time, Malfoy moaning his name all breathily. Malfoy
“This doesn’t change the fact that you still need to make progress on your capstone topic,” Hermione tells him matter-of-factly as he sits down. “I’ll help you find more books once you decide on a different one, okay?”
“Yeah,” Potter says. “Too many people—I felt all, er, self-conscious without someone to talk to, I suppose.”
But Draco doesn’t think he’s the only one who feels that meeting like this is keeping him sane. He can see it when Potter looks at him with poorly concealed fondness in his eyes; he can see it when Potter comes close to kiss him, lips pricking into a smile, and it makes Draco’s heart starts to race.
“I don’t have anything bothering me,” he scrunched his brow slightly. Weird? He hadn’t been weird today, had he? Sure, he had avoided the general public as much as possible, but didn’t he tend to do that anyway?
They finish eating in silence. But instead of being awkward like Harry half expects it to be, it feels almost comfortable to be sitting there next to Malfoy, strange as that is.
He thinks of when Draco was faceless Trainee Four, of a time when they were in one of the Unspeakable breakrooms until three in the morning the night before an exam because Harry was struggling with some of the concepts. Draco made snarky comments the whole night, of course—and how Harry
“Potter,” he sighs, and he doubts Potter can hear him with the music blaring, but Potter must’ve seen his lips move because he grins.
“Then—then will you fuck me?” Draco says, voice raspy, pupils all blown out as he looks up at Harry, and Harry’s breath hitches.
In turn, he has Potter, who takes turns making tea with him and cuddles up to him on the couch even when he’s grumpy, who won’t allow him to work after hours even if Draco wants to.
Harry shivers, a warm pulse of want flashing through his veins, and he kisses Draco again until they’re both panting. Draco still doesn’t call him by his name as much as Harry would like, but on the rare occasion he does, it feels special, like Draco telling him he loves him in not as many words.
Snorting, Harry leans down to pick up a set of self-cleaning gloves that’d fallen on the floor. He hangs them back on the shelf, idly straightening the second row of gloves beside it. “Sounds about right.”
Draco sighs. “I don’t,” he says, and then stops, because he wonders if he should be admitting this at all.
“Arsehole,” Draco mutters, nevertheless throwing Harry’s shirt on the floor and tugging at the zip to Harry’s trousers.
“Who is it?” Draco asks, leaning toward him in interest, and suddenly Harry is even warmer than before. Maybe he should switch to drinking water.
“Touch yourself,” Potter says, voice husky, and Draco groans and wraps his hand around himself just as the tip of Potter’s cock presses into him.
Malfoy will reject him, will push him away, and then Harry will know for sure and can move on with his life. Maybe he can even go and actually get fucking laid for once.
To make things worse, he’s getting hard—because, okay, yes, he thinks Potter is fucking sexy, all right? And Potter’s
Malfoy sighed deeply, standing up and striding toward the door. “I’ll think about it,” he mumbled gruffly as he left.
Four Gryffindors. Three Ravenclaws. Five Hufflepuffs. And... one Slytherin. Not that they’re in Houses anymore. Not for the first time, Harry finds himself just a bit glad that they haven’t been separated, especially since there are so few of them.
“Hmm,” Malfoy says, gaze suddenly serious, searching, and Harry wishes that wasn’t enough to make him start to go hard. Except it is. “Can I see your neck?”
Potter shifts as Draco reaches down to stroke his own cock, moving forward, and then Potter’s next thrust hits Draco’s prostate—“
Harry flushed. “No… I liked it. But if you ever tell anyone that, I swear I’m going to learn that Italian itchy armpit curse, just for you.”
“I would’ve said,” Harry tells her, “Definitely. And at any rate, this is pretty recent, so I haven't really even processed it myself yet.”
“Hey, Ginny…” he started, tacking on a smile at the end that he wasn’t sure reached his eyes. She picked up on his misgivings immediately, of course.
, but instead he nods and forces himself to look like he doesn’t care. “I’ll probably head out, then.”
“I can work on that in the next few days, then,” Harry offers, smiling at her. “Most of what I’m doing at the shop right now is product development anyway. I can afford to slack off a bit.”
Slowly, Potter lets out a shaky breath and nods. He doesn’t cry, thank Merlin, because Draco doesn’t know what he would’ve done with that, but he does put a hand on Draco’s arm for a moment which is nearly just as bad. The warmth sinks into Draco’s skin for just a second, making his blood go all tingly, before Potter removes it and looks at the ground. “At least I was able to... er,” he says, and stops short, as if he’s going to say something that would get him in trouble.
It’s been his dirty little secret for years that sometimes arguing with Malfoy turns him on. And it doesn’t
Harry yawned, still drowsy. “You’re not my enemy. You never were, Voldemort was.” Belatedly, he thought about what he had said, and realized that he actually believed his own words. It surprised him—he couldn’t remember ever having thought that about Malfoy before.
He had desperately tried to hide how he felt toward Draco, before. But Draco’s lips were moving slowly on his, changing him, tearing him up inside, and all he could do was hold on and kiss him back. Draco made a quiet noise in response that sent his heart into overdrive, tugging at him in a direction he hadn’t known he wanted to go. “Mmph,” he sighed. Everything was Draco, and it was okay.
“Harry, I’ve got—oh, where are you going?” Hermione asks the next night, bright-eyed, books held out toward him. “I’ve got some resources for your capstone research that I think would be helpful!”
And then, eyes wide with arousal as he looks right at Harry, Malfoy sinks down on his cock, slick and hot and tight.
When he’s done speaking, McGonagall makes one last note on her clipboard. “Very well,” she says. “Your choice of topic is satisfactory—but prepare better for our next meeting, do you understand? And don’t go relying on Miss Granger for all of your research, either.”
Potter, who was his rival at Hogwarts practically since Draco first stepped onto the train. Potter, who works five cubicles down in the DMLE, whose throaty laugh Draco has to suffer through hearing on a regular basis while Potter jokes around with the others.
“You’re an idiot,” Draco says, and when Harry looks at him again he’s sitting up, disbelief in his eyes.
It’s an embarrassingly short amount of time before he can’t take it any longer, before he finally, finally reaches up and threads his fingers through Potter’s stupid, messy hair—and kisses him.
Also he doesn’t have any idea what to wear because he hasn’t been on a night out for years, and he has to hurriedly go through his closet to find a shirt that’s not too wrinkled. He comes out with a dark green polo that’s maybe a little too tight, but he’s not going to risk Engorgioing it and so he’ll have to deal with the slight discomfort.
Harry found himself wearily climbing to the sixth floor a few minutes before ten o’clock, as per a succinctly worded owl that Malfoy had sent earlier that day. He wondered at the lack of people in the halls—he assumed it was because the celebration goers would mostly be retiring to bed now.
“What? No! No, of course not, it’s just Malfoy. I mean, I’m not in love with Malfoy! Or anyone, really! I was just thinking about him—not like that though—oh, fuck.” He could tell from her widening grin that he had already dug himself into a bottomless pit.
“Potter,” Draco sighs, slipping his arms around Harry, and when Harry hugs him back Draco sinks into the embrace, looking like a load has been taken off of his shoulders. A spark of pleasure sings in Harry’s lungs at the fact that he’d been able to help Draco relax like this.
“I dare you to try,” Malfoy says, smirking. “I think you’ll find that I’m very unpunchable nowadays.”
They’re very close, he realizes, when Potter’s lips twitch into a smile. They’re very close and Draco is looking at Potter’s mouth and he’s pretty sure Potter can tell.
“Where were you?” Ron shouts, and grabs at Harry by his shoulders as soon as he steps into the living room. Harry is stunned. He thinks maybe he hasn’t talked to Ron in days.
Slowly, he sighs. “This was important to me,” he says. “And I’m really... I appreciate it. A lot. But the things that you want—that you need—those are important to me too, y’know?”
,” he says, even though he’s already turning, moving closer to Harry and pressing his face into Harry’s shoulder. “Gross.”
Draco eats even though he’s not hungry, watching the Muggles lounge or socialize around him. Many of them are using devices he thinks are called computers, but these are smaller than he’s seen before, shaped like a chair with no arms or legs. It’s so odd that they can stare at these things for so long without getting bored—Draco thinks he’d get far too restless.
“Load of help you are,” Malfoy complains. Shaking his head, he pulls a shrunken book out of his pocket and enlarges it, flipping through its pages. From what Harry can tell, it seems like a beginner’s guide to Wizarding portraits. “Not that this book is much help either, and it was the only one in the library. It’s so damned
“Witches and wizards live far longer than Muggles do, obviously,” Malfoy states, face twisting as if it’s a pain to even have to speak to Harry. “Then there’s other methods of prolonged immortality, such as the Sorcerer’s Stone, which I’m sure
Harry’s surprised to find that he’s actually okay with that. It makes it easier to ignore the fact that not too long ago, he was in love with him.
Draco’s breath hitches, and Potter sighs, lips spreading into a soft smile. “Good,” Potter says, sliding his hand up to card his fingers gently in Draco’s hair. “I almost thought—I dunno, that I’d dreamed last night up, or something.”
He didn’t know he was still capable of hurting for Malfoy, which for some reason makes him hurt more.
Harry wraps his arms around his knees, looking at Malfoy and wanting, wanting. “I don’t know, he says again, and Malfoy nods.
“Now, as much as I enjoy staring into your open mouth for long periods of time, I should be going now.”
Draco buries his face into Harry’s shoulder as Harry leans against the pillows, and Harry shivers, feeling trembly and exhausted. At any moment, Draco could change his mind. Harry has to be okay with that.
Still, wasn’t it worth it, to finally be so happy? Doesn’t he deserve that for fucking once in his life?
His palms tingle as he loads a portion of mashed potatoes onto his plate, despite suddenly feeling not hungry. But if he doesn’t eat, then he’ll no longer have an excuse to be here with Malfoy, so he forces himself to dig in.
“Draco,” Harry says, and then presses his lips to Draco’s mouth in a chaste kiss. “I loved it. And I’d do it again—you seem to have forgotten that I’m the one who suggested it.”
Harry chuckles at that, even though at the same time he can feel his own face flushing. “Well. Er. You go to the… the Gentlewizard’s club on occasion, right?” he asks.
Harry stares at the name on the parchment, his given name, and lets out a breath of relief. He’s not entirely sure why he even still wants to go out with Malfoy after what happened the last time, but the fact that Malfoy wants it enough to have asked feels reassuring somehow.
Draco waves it off. “Figured you could use a bit of relaxation,” he replies, and Potter nods gratefully, then tips back a swallow of the whisky, wrinkling his nose and gasping. Fuck—Draco really should’ve thought to ask what he wanted. “Sorry,” he mouths, feeling mildly horrified.
When Draco tries to enquire about what the other Unspeakables are working on, he’s confronted with topics such as “Quantitative Analyses of Magical Interplay in Bodily Weakening Due to Old Age” and “In-Depth Interviews about Life and Death in Wizards Above Age 150.” Which he’s sure are topics that are
He pictures returning to the Dark Lord and telling him that he’s failed, that Potter caught wind of what he was trying to do and escaped, of the blissful feeling giving up, of letting go—
So he goes, and they do their usual Friday routine of ordering takeout and eating it on Draco’s sofa. It’s going perfectly fine with them idly watching the telly, shooting the shit, pointedly Not Talking About What Happened—
“Listen, I know this is an awful idea,” Malfoy says, holding out the vial, and Harry realizes with astonishment that his hand is faintly shaking.
“Well, it’s certainly not Ginny you were smiling about,” Hermione says primly, somehow managing to make him flush without even looking up from her paper—which is ridiculous, anyway, as he’s not crushing on anyone. He’s
“Accepted, I suppose,” Draco says, and then for good measure—“I’m sorry for being an arse, just in general.”
get an erection right now. Quickly, he fumbles for a memory of something to distract himself, settling on trying to imagine Hagrid and Madame Maxine going at it—which thankfully turns him off almost immediately.
Another thought plagues him now too—that this is hurting Potter. It must be. He doesn’t quite have words for what they’re doing together, shared stories and stolen glances and bitten lips, but he can feel himself longing more for Potter’s touch with every minute they spend together, and he’s slowly growing convinced that it can’t be one-sided.
“Magic works in odd, stupid ways,” Malfoy mumbles. “She doesn’t want to be alive without him, awful as he was. So she’s stopped casting, and her magic is shriveling up. And when your magic dies, well...” He shrugs. “It’s so tightly wound up into our systems that it’ll kill you.”
Slowly he resumes speaking. He tells Potter of things that burn his lungs as they leave his throat, of the Vanishing Cabinet and watching Dumbledore die, of the summer when Voldemort invaded his house and he felt like he was perpetually two seconds away from screaming.
Draco shoves him lightly, grimacing. “That’s disgustingly sappy and you know it,” he complains. But then he laughs, and Harry joins him. It feels strange to be laughing again.
“Draco—” Harry starts, and then realizes that Draco is right behind him, having been reading over his shoulder.
“Yeah,” Draco says, hoping against hope that Harry didn’t hear what the mirror was saying before he walked into the room.
“Well, it’s not like you care,” Draco says, scowling. “You hate me. You don’t even try.” Something thick and painful is forming in his throat. He doesn’t know why he’s even said it, because they’re not lovers, or even friends. Potter doesn’t owe him anything. But Draco is going to be spending every living moment with him for quite possibly the rest of his life. Maybe he’s owed this much, at least—for Potter not to hate every inch of him so long as they live.
“Coming, boss,” Draco says, snickering when Potter throws a glare at him. At least he can still get a rise out of Potter, given that Potter
Except that wouldn't be right, would it? Just to watch Draco without him knowing? Especially if the room only allowed Harry entrance by mistake.
And Harry’s lips have touched Malfoy’s skin of his own accord—because he wanted to. He wanted to kiss him.
It’s been some time since Draco’s had his mouth on a cock, but this time puts all the others to shame because it’s
He opens it up, and then his heart drops, because the first thing he sees is Astoria’s wedding ring, neatly charmed to the top of the parchment, oh Merlin—
“Potter! What the fuck are you thinking? That would never work! Just because you’re disgustingly trustful doesn’t mean everyone else feels the same. I’m a Death Eater. Do I really have to spell it out for you?”
“I—shite, sorry, I just thought you might want to take it back,” Potter says, shrugging. “I mean… you couldn’t even remember it. It could’ve just been a drunk thing, you know, and—”
pitiful when he thinks better of it and decides he’s not allowed to think of Malfoy for the rest of his shift.
So Potter proceeds to demonstrate almost just as he said, licking lightly over Draco’s arse until Draco is quite literally sobbing from need and want and Harry fucking Potter being a fucking awful
A brief flicker of amusement appears on Draco’s face, but he nods in acceptance. “I appreciate the effort, Weasley. I’ll attempt for Harry’s sake as well, and Granger’s.”
Draco slowly shakes his head. But still, his voice has less bite in it when he speaks. “How am I supposed to forgive you?”
Harry shakes his head, pulling his arms around himself and feeling deflated. “It’s—you’re not engaged, are you?” he asks, because that’s the only thing he can think of that could explain Malfoy’s reluctance.
Draco looks pained for a moment. He licks his lips. “I do feel very strongly about you,” he admits carefully, briefly shutting his eyes before turning to look at Harry. “It’s terrifying.”
That burns, and he finishes the rest of his work in a sullen mood. He thought he would be sad to no longer be so close to Malfoy at work, but instead he’s relieved to reach the end of the day, to stand up and walk away from him—he no longer has to work so hard to pretend he doesn’t care. Because it
His stomach sinks. He flips through the next couple pages, discovering in horror that each survey seems to be several pages long, all filled with words like
“I know,” Harry says, and kisses him again, lets their mouths meld together. For a moment he can’t think, until they finally part and he pulls back, gasping. “You think it’s not terrifying for me too?”
“Christmas is all the more reason to extend welcome to those in need, and Draco needs protection just as much as you do,” Lupin says in a voice that strongly reminds Harry of Lupin’s days as a Professor. “Now be good, Harry,” he adds, as if Harry’s but a child, left behind at the Dursley’s again for another summer—and at least the cozy safehouse is a bit of a step up from
Laughing, Harry shifts, stretching his legs. “Sometimes I wonder what it’d feel like if you didn’t.”
He takes a deep breath in through his nose. He doesn’t want to be short with her, but in this case he can’t help it. “Why would you
Draco can smell him, all warm and somehow reminding him of Quidditch, every time Potter idly shifts in his chair. Sometimes their knees brush against each other under the desk, sending sparks up Draco’s spine, and he’s fiercely glad they never located the missing torch in their corner because the
He doesn’t, of course. As unfortunate as it is, there’s still part of him that’s overwhelmingly curious about Malfoy—not to mention the terrible part that wants to fuck him.
“Partially,” Malfoy says. “Some far off ancestor on Mother’s side. The Veela traits don’t always show up, though—Mother doesn’t have any symptoms of it at all, and neither did my grandparents.”
But Potter seems to know exactly how to distract him because then he nudges Draco’s knees apart, pulling off of his cock with a wet pop. “You said you’d let me do this later,” he says, grinning as he Summons a jar of lube.
“I guess,” Draco says. Slowly, his mouth spreads into a smirk. “But either way, you’re fucking me in the morning,” he adds, looking pleased.
Not even quite realizing he’s doing it, he feels around behind him for a chair, unable to look away as he sits down.
They eat in silence for several moments. Harry wants to ask what Malfoy’s doing here, but he’s afraid that Malfoy will leave again if the conversation grows serious.
Maybe Harry’s imagining it, but it feels like there’s the smallest hint of fondness in that statement.
“Fuck, it’s warm,” past-Potter mumbles, reaching for his wand. “Just gonna try—” He casts a spell, and then suddenly both of the two on the bed are completely naked.
“Off,” Draco mutters, tugging at his own shirt, and Potter helps him take it off, removing his own as an afterthought. They climb into bed, shucking their trousers as they go, Potter climbing on top of him and pressing his hips down,
Potter stills. “Fuck, sorry, sorry—” He starts to pull out, but Draco’s hands fly to his hips, holding him there.
Harry nods, even as misery builds thick in his throat. “You shouldn’t hide anymore,” he says quietly, feeling empty inside. “You shouldn’t hide from how you feel, and—and you hate me. You shouldn’t…” Tears leak down his cheeks. “You shouldn’t love me anymore, if that’s not how you really feel.”
But Harry has to obey nonetheless. “Mm—Draco,” he sighs, and behind him, Malfoy makes a choked off sound, one of surprise and maybe desire.
Maybe it’s because they absolutely refuse to let him work on anything to do with Astoria’s curse. “Oh, no, no, no,” Ford said immediately when Draco first brought it up. “We don’t work on personal subjects in this department. It’s far too tempting, and too dangerous… Don’t you think, at least?”
As it turns out, neither is Potter, which makes the morning a mess of exhausted grumbling and bickering at each other (“Stop elbowing me, Potter!” “I’m just brushing my teeth!” “Well, brush your teeth somewhere else, then!” “Malfoy, I
A lump forms hard and painful in Draco’s throat at the very thought. “I… You’re not, right? You’re not going to die soon, you still have time—”
“Please don’t tell anyone this,” Malfoy says, and Harry nods. Truly, he has no idea what Malfoy’s about to say. His brain’s still all foggy from Malfoy’s admission of wanting to fuck him anyway, so all he can do is steel himself.
Sure, he has to deal with his fair share of wanker customers who get their panties all in a bunch about how “this tree should be two inches to the left
He looks at the table, thoughts swirling, impossible to pin down. Suddenly he’s terrified, because if Potter keeps doing things like bloody apologizing then Draco won’t ever be able to stop maybe-liking him, and then Potter will find out—
Harry makes a face at him and kicks at a rock on the ground. It skitters off into the lake, and he turns to watch it sink. “I’m a bit surprised you know what a broken record sounds like.”
Most of all, he’d just felt off the whole time, even as he went through the motions of his job—the job he normally rather enjoys.
“Why do you even care, Potter? I know you can’t feel that strongly about this truce thing, and you have no reason to want to be around me at all, so why are you even suggesting this?”
Harry thinks through the other things Draco’s told him about mating. Slowly, he grins. “I expect it’ll take us quite a while to find out what happens if we stop having sex.”
“And?” Malfoy says, stretching the word out. “I paint rather regularly, if you’ve somehow managed not to notice.”
Instead, his heart jumps into his throat as he sees the shadowy outlines, glowing clearer every second, of Potter, standing right behind him in the mirror.
“Just tell me why, and I’ll let it go,” Harry says. Because more than anything—more than thoughts of future kisses or even just friendship—Harry just wants to know what he’d done wrong.
Malfoy is caught off-guard—Harry can see it in the way he opens and closes his mouth a couple of times. Then Malfoy sighs and shuts his book, setting it on the coffee table. “I don’t...” He swallows audibly. “I don’t know how to say this,” he says, and for the first time since Harry saw him out on the stoop that one night, he looks scared.
“All I’ve ever wanted is to be happy,” he says then, his voice rough. “I couldn’t stand being in Azkaban. Not for one day.”
Well. Apparently he did, because Malfoy is staring at him in confused horror. “I beg your pardon, Potter?”
look at him, and Harry has to will away the thrum of lust that hits him when he locks eyes with Malfoy—no, no, absolutely not. He
“Thank you so much, you two,” Hermione says, giving them a relieved-looking smile. “Really, I appreciate it.”
He'd never thought about it at all before, so he tried to think about it now. It didn’t seem… bad, per se—the thought of kissing a bloke, at least.
good to have Malfoy’s mouth on him. His thighs are shaking with the effort of staying still, of letting Malfoy lick him open, letting him press his tongue inside him with quick slides that make Harry gasp.
One moment, they’re lying there, Harry’s arm slung around Malfoy, staring each other down across the pillow.
Two: he will not call Malfoy ‘Draco’ unless Malfoy’s on the Amortentia, because the Draco Harry is falling in love with and the Malfoy he sees at work every day are far from the same. He can’t let anything slip.
... I know you’re lying,” Potter says, though his tone is light as he sets the trowel down and begins carefully transferring several flowery plants into the ground from a tray at his side.
Draco lurches forward and hugs him. Draco’s hair is prickly in his face, and then Draco’s leaning up and kissing him again, and it’s…
Draco could have tried killing Potter a dozen times by now, but there hasn’t quite been the opportunity—Potter never lets Draco’s wand out of his sight. Even when he comes apart, Draco deep inside him, bodies pressed flush together and filling the room with ragged moans, he never closes his eyes for more than a moment.
Harry blinks at her, setting down his pliers and casting a Muffliato in the direction of the shopfront. “Don’t you have work?”
“I haven’t… thought about it, you know? And—and wait, what do you mean, ‘guess you were wrong?’” he spluttered.
Harry doesn’t speak a word about what happened to Ron and Hermione at their weekly Saturday night dinner—both because there’s not much he can say without violating the Oath and because he doesn’t know what he would say even if he
He supposes it has something to do with dying. In less than twenty-four hours, he won’t care about anything anymore, but Potter has to go on, to keep on living in this awful, cruel world.
Harry’s heart flips in his chest—it’s rare that Draco says that, and Harry hopes he’ll be able to remember this later. He’ll have to Pensieve it, just like all the other times Draco’s said he loves him—although his Pensieve is starting to get quite full.
“I don’t,” Harry says, “Not really.” Mouth going dry, he leans in closer, reaches out and skims the tips of his fingers over Malfoy’s knee.
It’s too bad he can’t go back to sleep, can’t slip back into his dreams where visions of Potter are at least within his reach—
“Fuck, that’s weird,” Ron says, shaking his head. “I never would have thought… Never mind. Harry, as long as you’re happy, and as long as he’s not—I dunno, planning to curse you in his sleep or something—”
He’s been doing a good job of forcing himself to ignore him, he thinks, but that hasn’t made Harry want him any less.
He starts walking back to the door, but before he’s halfway across the room, the door opens and Malfoy steps in. Harry’s shoulders immediately tense, but he thinks of Adams’s words and forces himself to simply turn away, starting toward the door. See? He can avoid their “
“Because you always worry!” Astoria says, but the effort to shout is too much for her and she begins to cough. Draco looks around for the button to summon the Mediwitch, but she waves him off, stopping her fit soon after. “You always worry too much,” she says, her voice hoarser now. “This is what I mean—you consume yourself with my illness, and you don’t leave room for anything else.”
one dies, but both he and Potter have separately brought that up to Hughes, and both times they’ve gotten the same answer: “Beyond the veil, of course.” Hughes refuses to humor any other questions about the topic.
“Me neither,” Harry says. He used to, with Hermione, but he thinks it frightens her to know that Harry’s still not really okay, because she always gets this incredibly sad look on her face that Harry honestly never wants to see again. So he’s stopped, mostly, except for when things are bad enough that he absolutely can’t bear them alone.
Draco wrinkles his nose—Astoria’s mum is not unpleasant, albeit over-perfumed and fairly conservative in her beliefs. Still, that doesn’t mean he wants to be
“I don’t think so?” Harry says, surprised. “I mean, besides, um, the fact that we’re—Draco and I, I mean—are sort of together now, but. I thought you knew that.”
Harry grins at him. “Okay,” he says, and then he stands and shucks off his trousers, not missing Malfoy’s soft inhale or the way his pupils go all large.
Not to mention that, ever since he’d fallen in love, Draco hasn’t even been able to wank to thoughts of anyone else. He’d tried to pull a bloke once at the club, right after the corridor incident happened, but he ended up having to lie and say he was too drunk to get off, giving the man what was probably a sub-par blowjob and sending him off on his way. Then he lay in bed afterwards and wanked himself raw to thoughts of how it would’ve felt if it was Potter instead, how Potter’s lips and hands would’ve felt roaming over his skin—
Malfoy purses his lips. “I suppose that’s fair.” He sucks in a breath, looking Harry squarely in the eyes. “But if you feel like you might be developing some sort of feelings at any point, you should really tell me. Because I meant it when I said I didn’t want to hurt anyone, Potter, and believe it or not, that includes you.”
“Of course, Harry. I’m quite hungry myself, but you go on ahead. I’ll clean up.” Langley gestured to the mess that they had made that day. Books were scattered around the room from that day’s research, and several desks were broken and exhibited charred tops as a result of their dueling. Harry smiled appreciatively.
“Out of forty students, thirteen of your class returned to complete your final year at Hogwarts,” McGonagall continues, “and we—the professors, that is—we sincerely welcome you all back.” She pauses to give them a brief smile. “Though many of your peers have moved on to other stages in their lives, we appreciate your dedication to this school and to learning. However, the Board of Governors has predicted that several of you will not go on to complete this school year—no need to be alarmed now,” she says, directing her words to Hannah Abbott, who suddenly looks faint. “It is simply the case that several of you have standing job offers, and at this moment, suffice it to say that the wizarding world needs more witches and wizards in the workforce, N.E.W.T.s or no.”
Hermione shakes her head, expression dismal. “It’s awful,” she says again. “It’s Neville, see. He’s—he’s sick.”
like this,” Malfoy says, but it’s not quite in character—instead, his voice is hushed in wonder, the same dumb, sappy tone he always takes on when he’s about to finger Harry open, and Harry nearly chokes on the sudden swell of love that fills his throat.
If someone had asked, he wouldn’t have said he was dating Draco. Harry had turned him down, after all. But they stayed up far too late and talked of everything and nothing almost every night. Sometimes Draco laid in his lap, and Harry would run his hands through blond hair that was growing longer every week.
“Good, then,” Ron says, sitting back down on the sofa, and Harry and Draco head to the other one, across the coffee table from Ron.
“…Right.” Harry pulled a matchbox out of his pocket, filched from the Transfiguration classroom. “Here, look.” He struck a match on the side of the box. “It’s one of the Muggle ways of making fire. It’s not as convenient as magic is, but it’s a lot more controlled because it’s small and you can blow it out easily.” He demonstrated his words as he spoke, watching the smoke as the flame disintegrated into the air.
She gives him a look, but still, she nods. “Briefly,” she says, setting her fork down with a sigh, and he nearly regrets bringing it up. “He’s busy drowning in his own misery, and I suspect that nothing either of us can do will change that.”
He makes his way off the dance floor, glancing every so often at Malfoy, who’s walked confidently up to the other man—now they’re exchanging words, now they’re dancing, now Malfoy’s wrapping his arms possessively around him the same way he’d done with Harry. Harry means to leave, he really does, but instead he finds himself lingering until the two of them start making their way to the door.
“We’ve made bad decisions,” Harry says, his voice husky as Draco nips at his ear. “I think I was leaving.”
He was just settling down at his desk to go through the potions orders for the day when Potter walked in. Potter—who is
Malfoy turns to face the lake, holding his robes closed as one of the first stiff breezes of autumn blows over the water at them. “It’s for my Capstone research.”
“No, it doesn’t,” Malfoy confirms. “Veela tend to take very good care of their mates in—well, various ways.” There’s a small flush on Malfoy’s face, and Harry feels a brief spurt of arousal—he thinks he might rather like to know some of what Malfoy’s thinking about.
“Yes,” Harry says, which is stupid because fake-Draco would already know that. “You were there, and then you left.”
“You know the lube charm?” Malfoy asks, and Harry shakes his head so Malfoy casts it. It hasn’t fully processed in Harry’s mind what Malfoy is about to do until Malfoy reaches down and begins to slick Harry’s cock.
“It’s fine,” Harry says, crawling into the bed, and Draco crosses to the other side and climbs in next to him. Harry points his wand up at the Magi-bulb in the ceiling, flicking his wrist so that the room goes dark. Then he drops his wand on the bedside table, rolls onto his back, and looks over at Draco. “You, um. You were watching.”
coming, tense shudders under Harry, spurting warm inside of him, eyes squeezed shut as his hand falls away from Harry’s cock. ‘
Potter is, how selfless and giving and kind. And it’s not fair that he always, always extends some of that to Draco, even despite their awful past at Hogwarts. It’s not fair that he’s the only person who even spared a look at Draco’s job application after their eighth year, when everyone snubbed him for the mark on his arm; that he hired him without a second thought and then somehow proceeded to ignore their past treat him as if they’d been friends for ages.
“Ugh, my legs,” Harry groans, still shaky, muscles screaming with the strain of standing that way for so long. He’d been able to ignore it when Draco was fucking him, but now that it’s over the soreness is all he can think about.
“Without stooping to paying for a rentboy,” Pansy adds, red lips stretching into a smirk. “That was Blaise’s
What?—anxiety surged through his system, and he gritted his teeth. What the fuck was Draco getting at?
Malfoy rolls his eyes, but even so, he shivers as he starts to work a third finger in himself, wet and sloppy. “I don’t answer to the likes of you.”
“Merlin, they can’t be serious,” Harry says, flicking his eyes to the paper name. He half expects it to be The Quibbler, or some kind of joke paper that George has made as a prank, but no, it’s the Prophet, signature logo and all.
Harry resists the urge to turn around and look at his spot at the end of the old Ravenclaw table. “Is Hermione over there?”
Harry grits his teeth and shakes his head. He’s looked Death in the fucking face—certainly he can deal with sharing a department with his ex-whatever, even if he did sleep with him barely a month ago.
The hole in his chest tears itself wide open, and he gasps for air—it’s like when Astoria left, only
“Oh, I’ll try my best,” Draco says. It’s a lie—he has no plans to even open this thing, and he wonders how long he has to keep it before he can pawn it off to someone else.
He goes stiff with violent embarrassment and jerks away. “I... shit,” he mutters, frantically blinking awake, his neck burning with shame.
Tonight they’re at Draco’s after the pub, which isn’t abnormal on its own. No, the abnormal part is that after they arrived, Draco went and pulled two glasses and a bottle of firewhisky out of the cupboard, offering Harry some with a raised brow.
“Ginny, it looks like,” Harry peeked at the top of the letter, then sighed as he took in the length of the scroll. Ginny’s letters rivaled Hermione’s in wordiness at times. “I’ll read it later,” he shrugged, stuffing it in his pocket and serving himself. Draco immediately stole a meatball, and Harry felt proud of himself when only a small twinge of dismay ran through him. He grinned at Draco, who unexpectedly grinned back—it was possibly the first time Harry’d seen him smile in a week or so, as he still wasn’t quick to display his happiness.
Draco smiles back, looking relieved, and Harry feels so warm he wants to burst with it. “Good,” Draco says, moving his hands to Harry’s calf, and Harry lies there, warm and comfortable, his lover’s hands skating over his skin and putting just the right amount of pressure on the muscles in his legs.
looking at him—but only to glare at him like he’s tainting the air just by standing too near, and Harry almost wants to cry.
“Sure,” Harry says, sitting up. He casts a brief, hopeless look at the messiness of his workspace, but there’s no time to make an attempt to clean it up before someone steps into the back room.
, Potter, now shut up, I’m coming through,” Draco grumbles, summoning his shoes, dimly aware that he’s accidentally put them on the wrong feet but too anxious to care.
“This is brilliant,” Potter says, his voice all breathy, and Draco can’t hide his subsequent shudder.
Harry thinks he remembers seeing her during the Battle, helping to heal those with the worst wounds. She must have gotten caught in the crossfire.
like this, not off the potion. Draco shouldn’t be groaning out Potter’s name as Potter drops to the ground and starts to suck him off, shouldn’t be running his hands through Potter’s hair, knocking his glasses askew.
” McGonagall hisses at the Hat, striding over to stand in front of it, hands on her hips. But the Hat remains still.
Harry hurries and takes it so that it won’t catch fire—Floo powder flames are significantly less hot than real fire, but that doesn’t mean they can’t do strange things to flammable material—and then he quickly skims over the headline.
Potter definitely seems surprised at that, but his face brightens, and they stumble to their feet and make their way to the Floo.
It’s the most twisted sort of thing to realize that the only reason he wants to live right now is because he doesn’t want this to end.
“Here,” Malfoy says, holding out a handful of coins. Harry goes to take them, but one drops to the ground in the process, and both of them lean down to reach for it—
“Well, tough,” Potter says. “If we’re not linked together somehow, then we’re going to accidentally separate at some point, and I don’t fancy waking up in the middle of the night because of a headache.”
Harry groaned internally as he pushed his plate away, full to bursting from the rich food that the Ministry had provided. Sure, he loved feasts as much as the next person, but feasting every meal for an entire week was not nearly as appealing as it sounded.
Looking back down at the thick tome in front of her, one of several from a stack that’s already piled up next to her on the table, Hermione smiles back. “I know.”
He starts with the stories he can bear to tell, ones of his youth, of running through the fields of Wiltshire with Pansy, of growing up at the Manor playing with (and getting bitten by) the peacocks. He tells him of learning to fly, of getting his Hogwarts letter, of Mother sneaking him sweets even though Father discouraged it, of Mother—
how trusting he is of Draco all the bloody time. “So you say, every other minute of every single day.”
“It’s—it’s okay,” Harry says. He picks up his wand and casts another warming charm because he suddenly feels chilled.
Harry laughs. “You should see yourself,” he says, biting his lip. “I—I would fuck you right now. If I could, I mean.”
“Shut up,” Draco murmurs into his mouth, even though Harry hasn’t said anything. “God, I thought I didn’t have a chance…” he shakes his head, trembling. “Oh, shut up, Harry!”
Draco stares at him in faint shock, his pale eyes wide, mouth slightly agape. Then he bites his lip. “Of course I want it,” he says quietly. “But it’s not worth the possibility of—of you turning your back on me someday. Of not having you anymore. I’d—” He shakes his head. “I don’t know what I’d do. You’re the only one I have left.”
They reached the Great Hall, where Harry found an unfamiliar owl awaiting him at his usual spot. “Now who are you from?” he murmured, taking the letter and offering it a bit of food as he sits down.
Moore takes him to her office, where she finally shows him the paperwork to record a new prophecy, as she’s been promising to do for his entire rotation. “It can take months for a prophecy to appear, you know,” she tells him, also for about the seventh time. “You’ve gotten lucky. Maybe you’ll be fit to take over for me when I retire after all.” Then she cackles.
“I should be leaving,” he says, looking as if he feels uncomfortable just to be here. Which could easily be true, Harry thinks, eyes straying toward the living room.
A sly expression appears on Draco’s face, and he smirks. “Did you do this so you’d have a better chance of kissing me?”
“Well, most people don’t notice on a regular basis, but spellwork can take a lot of energy from you. It takes time for your magical core to store up more of it, especially when you’re doing a lot of spells at once, which is part of the reason why professional Duelists have to retire at such an early age. It can be really draining.”
Harry was beginning to smile, because Draco was maybe okay and that was better than anything—but then something went wrong, and Draco’s arm faltered.
“Yeah,” Draco says, then makes a face. “I mean. No. Or... fuck. I don’t know, Potter,” he says with a sharp sigh. “It was a bad idea.”
“Yeah, it was,” Harry admitted, already regretting his decision to say anything. He slumped down, sighing. Ginny was probably going to overanalyze it now, and he hadn’t even figured out what he thought about it yet.
“Yeah, a bit,” Harry says. Then, a strange unsureness in his eyes, he reaches out to take Draco’s hand.
Harry’s hips buck as his blood goes tingly in his veins—and then his brain short-circuits because all of a sudden Malfoy’s on top of him, pushing him over and kissing him, lips cold from the outside air and Harry can’t
But thinking of the war now, of the guilt and shame he felt afterwards as his morals slowly righted themselves, of the fear shooting up his spine when people shouted curses at him years ago in Diagon—it still feels like a punch in his gut.
Harry thinks of Draco, of the way sadness drags at his edges until he starts wasting away, of seeing him crying, long ago, over a bathroom sink. He aches for him.
“I’ve booked you time at Bentley’s tomorrow night,” Astoria says, and Draco nearly spits out his next bite of food.
And that’s how they end up walking several blocks into Muggle London to a club Harry’s never heard of, even though there’s a faint shimmer of magic over the entrance that suggests the Muggles can’t see it. “How’d you know this was here?” Harry asks as they draw closer.
They sat in silence for a moment, then Ginny sighed. “You know, I’m a little relieved. I thought you were going to say you really were in love Malfoy.”
He takes a moment to position himself, gaze fierce on Draco’s face, and Draco wants and wants and wants—and then Harry pushes in slowly, filling him, groaning, and Draco wouldn’t give up this moment for anything.
turn him down? Go out and do something worse? Be an insufferable arse every day they work together from now on?
He’s at his wits’ end when he returns home Friday night in a sulky mood, which Astoria recognizes immediately, wordlessly going to scrawl an order for Owl-In fish and chips on a bit of parchment and sending it off with one of the Manor Owls.
This time Harry is the one to lean in, to catch Draco’s wrist in one hand and his shoulder in the other, to slot their mouths together in the middle of the kitchen.
Smiling, Potter leans in close, knocking his forehead gently against Draco’s. “So,” he says. “D’you want to go on a date with me sometime?”
“I know. But.” Malfoy finally rolls to face him, and Harry lies down again, close to him but not quite touching. “Listen, Potter. You’re not...” He shuts his eyes. “When we fuck, you’re not just a body to me, all right?”
“Not—not in a mean way,” Harry explained. “Just start with lighting candles, maybe, and then try to get used to bigger things, like fireplaces. I dunno. So you’re less scared.”
Pride shines from Ron’s eyes as he wraps an arm around Hermione. “I knew you could do it, love,” he says genuinely.
He expects Malfoy to challenge him, or maybe simply to not respond. Instead Malfoy sighs disdainfully and says, “Yes, Potter, I live here. Why else would I be sitting on the front step?”
As his lungs grasp for air, one thought surfaces in his mind, above all the panic and the worry and the sadness.
Harry nods, chasing a spare grain of rice with his plastic fork. “I dunno if you would know much more than I do about the case she’s working on, then—the one she mentioned at pub night?”
Really, Harry’s the one who should hate himself for this. Because it’s slowly dawning on him that he’s taken advantage of Malfoy being in this state, because Malfoy’s high on the potion and Harry—Harry isn’t.
“No,” Harry says. “I just—I never knew. I was lonely back then too, you know? I always thought you had so many friends.”
The last bit of convincing that Harry needed was the soft moan that came from Draco’s mouth when Harry started truly kissing him back.
to visit him? Pansy maybe, but she’s in France, and she’s already told him she doesn’t know if she can bear to see him again. He understands. Pureblooded children are taught from a young age that it’s disdainful to show too much emotion, and he knows that all that would come of her visit would be too many tears from both of them.
Slowly, he removes his hands from around Malfoy’s back, swallowing thickly—because Malfoy, too, is still hard inside of him. “You won’t keep going,” he goads.
“I’d gathered,” Potter says drily, and Draco grimaces a bit, thinking of all the times he’d snapped at Potter instead of letting him in.
“I would deserve it, probably,” Draco says. “But I have a feeling you have a lot of work to do right now, and so do I.”
“Of course you didn’t,” Malfoy says, a half-smile on his lips. “I went out of my way to be an arse to you for most of our time at Hogwarts.”
“But...” Draco thinks for a moment, pulling his hand away. “I do like to see you—in pleasure. So maybe...” He swallows, reddening, and Harry leans sideways and kisses him until all the red vanishes, until Draco’s voice is husky as he says, “Maybe I’d tell you to stay completely still. Maybe I’d charm one of the dildos from the cabinet to fuck you while I fucked your face, and you’d have to—to take it.”
But Father has locked himself in his study since the sentencing, and the garden is long overgrown, ever since Voldemort poisoned the Manor with his presence.
“What is it?” Draco asks, standing far too close as he leans in to attempt to look at the clipboard. Harry turns away to hide it from him, already annoyed as he skims the first few questions.
And even though Harry was the one who wanted him gone, he misses him when he walks away, misses him so much he could die from it.
He blinks at her in shock. He nearly protests, except that there's the faintest thought in the back of his mind that maybe Draco's here, and maybe, just maybe, Draco wants Harry here too…
Rolling onto his back, Draco stares at the ceiling, heaving a sigh. “Do you know why I still call you by your surname?”
But then the unsettling thoughts began to bombard him, just as they’d been doing for the past year. He wasn’t worth the effort that loving him would cost. He was a person torn in two—one half lost the night of the final battle, the other half left torn and flimsy. Seeing that many deaths didn’t leave one right in the head. Even if Draco loved him, he’d be loving an empty person, and Draco deserved so much better.
Vaguely, Harry wonders how long they have before the potion goes off, but before he can fully calculate it he yawns, too tired to think so hard. “Love you,” he mumbles, like it’s second nature even though it’s only the second time he’s ever said it.
“...no Houses any longer...” “...hoping Mary would be Sorted with us!” “...what do we do?” Snatches of conversation swirl around Harry’s head, and he takes it all in. For once, everyone around him looks just as misplaced as Harry feels. Almost like he fits in.
Malfoy shakes his head, looking away. “I can hardly believe it myself. Did you know you’re a frustratingly good person?”
He still wants him. That part stays, tingling frustratingly beneath his skin, making him want to do reckless things. He wonders what would happen if he kissed Malfoy, but he thinks that Malfoy would just as soon tear him apart if he tried.
“Evil? Mean? Death Eater scum of the earth?” Draco asks flatly, and has the pleasure of seeing Potter flush at that.
Draco’s not sure if he’s happy or not. Actually, he’s mostly tense, because he can’t quite say he’s ever actually cuddled up to someone like this, save for maybe his mother when he was very young. “It’s fine,” he grits out. At least now he can roll onto his side, which he can admit is far more comfortable than before.
“Draco…” he breathed, and somehow Draco seemed to know what he needed because then they were face to face, breathing the same air, and Draco was kissing Harry.
“Yeah,” Harry says, feeling suddenly nervous. “Is it okay? I can Transfigure it into something different if you don’t want a bracelet, or—”
He reaches over and takes the vial, and then despite the wide-eyed look Potter gives him, he tips it toward his mouth.
“I forget, sometimes. That everyone’s not like my father, I mean,” Malfoy says, shaking his head. “Not that I’d expect you of all people to be.”
And Harry starts to laugh. He doesn’t know why he’s laughing, because nothing’s really funny, but then Malfoy joins him and Harry doesn’t think he’s ever seen Malfoy
“Why are you still here?” Draco mumbled. But he wasn’t telling him to leave, and Harry could feel his warmth even through the covers, so he felt a little more okay.
Malfoy swallows audibly. “If you want,” he says, looking away—“If you wanted to, you could fuck me.”
“It’s fine,” Draco blurts out quickly—fuck, now he just sounds overeager. “I mean, I go with Blaise all the time,” he adds hurriedly. It’s nearly true—he used to, before Potter at least, so it’s barely even a lie.
“Here, I’ll show you,” Hermione says, picking up her wand. She teaches him the wand movement as well as the incantation, pausing to correct his wrist position. “There. Now you can teach it to him. It’s a suppressant spell of sorts—it blocks transmission of viruses and bacteria, but I bet it would work for pheromones too.”
“God, I really, really hope not,” Hermione says. “I’m—I’m working on a solution. But I keep hitting dead ends, and I just don’t have
Harry bursts into a fit of laughter. “It’s yours, you know,” he says, grabbing his wand and spelling himself clean. He aims the wand at Draco’s arse too, but Draco stops him, cheeks reddening.
Of course, then his guilt returns again—Draco’s been seeing Potter in this mirror for ages, after all, practically using images of Potter’s body to get off—but then Potter’s positioning himself behind him, his cock catching at the rim of Draco’s arsehole, and Draco can’t bring himself to care anymore.
“Of course I am! I’m not about to get plowed down by whatever magical creature you’re practicing on next,” Draco scowled, and Harry and Langley guffawed loudly. They had been working on doxies last week, which were surprisingly hard to keep contained (as evidenced by Lockhart in second year). Draco had opened the door just in time for a full on pelting as the creatures made a run for it.
He doesn’t realize that he’s moving closer until he’s already taken a few steps, his eyes locked on Malfoy’s, arousal spiking deep in his veins. He can’t look away. His mouth goes dry, his heartbeat speeds—and for the first time in a very long while, he’s afraid. He tries to break out of it, pushes and shoves with his magic, but it seems like Malfoy’s pull is stronger than Harry, dragging him ever closer. He hasn’t been so overpowered by someone’s magic in years.
Harry laughs and kisses him. “We can do one better,” he says then, grinning mischievously, and Draco wonders what he’s thinking.
Then he thought about what he had just agreed to. Shit, Ron and Hermione still hated Draco, didn’t they? What was he going to do?
“I’ll forgive you for everything except the teasing,” Harry pretends to grumble, and Draco snorts and rolls his eyes.
“No! I—we’re not dating. I mean. I’m not dating anyone. Anyway, you don’t even know what you’re talking about,” Harry grumbles, furrowing his brow.
He remembers clearly what happens next—he’d ended up feeling so overwhelmed that he had to start making excuses to leave. He knew that if he stayed there for one more moment, he’d want to give into the temptation to do something stupid and
“Like this?” Langley purposely did the movement wrong. Harry shook his head and made corrections, and they continued back and forth while Langley “fixed” what he was doing wrong.
“I’d like that,” Astoria says, a small smile on her lips, and he resolves to search even harder for some sort of clue now that he has access to the Unspeakable archives. “Aren’t you supposed to be at work?”
“We’re radically different, aren’t we?” Draco says, shaking his head. “And anyway… you don’t love me.”
Harry slowly peels himself from the couch and scrawls a quick note to them assuring them that he’s fine before Flooing home to get ready.
It rains in tiny pieces all over the carpet, and Draco stares down at it, chest heaving. And then he looks up at Potter and realizes that it’s too late.
It’s silent for a moment as they both hop over one of the missing steps in the staircase leading to the fourth floor. “He’s... he’s one of us,” Hermione says eventually. “He’s the only Slytherin who returned, you know? And houses aren’t supposed to matter anymore.”
“I didn’t used to be. I was fine before… you know. But now I can’t even go near it.” His mouth twitched in annoyance. “I feel like such a fool… I’m supposed to be reestablishing my family, and I’m scared to light a candle. I hate it,” he sighed through his nose.
“It’s—fuck, you’re being so—” Malfoy’s cheeks go all pink. “You think you can embarrass me like this, Potter?”
Malfoy lets out a long sigh. He looks tired now, worn out. “I’m sorry, Potter. I really can’t tell you. It’s… not something I can control.”
“Please,” he whispers, urging Harry’s hips faster, and Harry obliges, jaw going slack as he grows closer. Draco takes himself in hand, matching Harry’s pace as best he can, reveling in the feeling of Harry inside him.
Adrenaline skewers Draco in the stomach, and he leaps up from the sofa, nailing his shin on the edge of the coffee table in the process. “
Potter shrugs. “It’s mostly fine,” he says, sounding a bit rueful. “I can bear it normally. As long as I don’t get stuck like this—it mostly just means I can’t do a lot of surveillance stuff on the job, which is fine.” He grins. “It’s the most boring next to paperwork anyway.”
“I’m already fucking angry,” Draco snaps, trying to hide the weakness that wants to make him tremble, the awful hole slowly forming in his heart. “Just tell me.”
And it’s cathartic, in a way, to view death academically instead of through the lens of the loss and emotion he’s attached to it over the years. It was enough to get him off of his sofa and make him apply for the Unspeakable position, even though Hermione warned him that she heard it was a ton of work. Which it was. But he made it through. He’s never been the best at studying, but he’s picked up enough good habits from Hermione over the years that he just managed to scrape by during the Trainee exams.
“It’s okay,” Draco says, wishing that his heart wasn’t beating quite so fast. “Is there anything else I can do?”
“Fine,” he muttered, glancing around the hall before motioning into a nearby classroom. It wouldn’t do to be overheard, not now, and not ever.
“Oh, I have my sources,” Malfoy says, lightly tapping the pad of his finger at Harry’s arsehole and making him clench. “Very
Draco bites his lip, casting an eye toward where their past-selves are rutting against each other, all soft moans and long-winded kisses. “Maybe later,” he says. “I want to know what happens, but…”
He leans back in his desk chair. What was Potter thinking, all those times? What was Potter feeling, when he kissed him, fucked him, when Draco pushed him to say he loved him.
“No, I—” Malfoy stops, letting out a short breath, and Harry’s honestly rather delighted to see his cheeks go pink. “I wanted to… apologize,” he says, and then before Harry can get a word in, he holds up a plastic bag filled with what looks like Muggle Styrofoam cartons. “Have you eaten?”
But the fact of the matter is that he could see that changing in a very short amount of time, with the way things have been going.
Harry swallows, wondering why Malfoy’s answer feels so important to him. Maybe because he’s always craved, deep down, to figure Malfoy out, to dig under his skin and figure out what makes him tick. “Tell me some of it, then.”
Harry pushes himself out of the bed, catching Hermione in a hug. “Fuck, that’s brilliant, ‘Mione! Are the patients—is everyone all right? Ginny and Neville?”
Potter actually fucking shivers. “God,” he mumbles quietly, eyes going all half-lidded as he opens the jar.
“You sure?” Harry asks, and when Draco nods he continues to open him up, his fingers thick inside Draco as he slowly adds them. Yet still, Draco thinks of
“It wasn’t just the dirty-talk,” Harry says. “It was just—all of it.” He gestures between them. “Us. I like us.”
“She said I show a lot of promise,” Malfoy says. And then, all in a rush, he adds, “You could come with me.”
Potter nods. “Sorry, I had—” he starts, then waves his hand in a vague gesture, as if Draco will instinctively understand what he means.
. But just then, as if Potter’s read his mind, Draco feels a slick finger sliding along his crack, drifting over his hole and away again. “Fuck,” Draco says, looking away.
“It’s fine. I can see how you would come to that conclusion,” Malfoy says, shrugging. “At any rate, I don’t suppose you have any idea either?”
“It was just a mistake—” Draco starts, but Adams gives him a severe look and he clamps his mouth shut.
“Nothing,” Draco says, but Potter’s already noticed the mirror, and Draco curses mentally. Thank Merlin Draco always cleans the spunk off of it when he’s done.
He shouldn’t have stayed last time. He shouldn’t have climbed in bed with him, because he knew even then that he wouldn’t be able to break it off properly if he let Draco touch him.
. I mean, okay, I like to help people, but that’s not something you’re allowed to make fun of me for! And what about you? You
Draco is suddenly overly aware of his own body, of how unkempt he is. He hasn’t bothered to bathe for a couple of days, and he’s wearing a pair of pajamas that feel a size too small, tight across his shoulders and too high at the ankles. He doesn’t even want to consider the state of his hair.
Draco’s heart seizes. He pulls off slowly, wiping his mouth, because maybe this will only happen once and he should try to make the best of it. “You should fuck me.”
The pleasure comes in waves, and he shudders through it, gasping. Above him, Potter moans and fucks into him faster, and Draco can feel Potter’s cock start to pulse as he comes too, moments after Draco does.
Still, the whole place makes him anxious somehow, for reasons he can’t put his finger on. Maybe because the repercussions for disturbing the time-space continuum are incredibly high, or because unlike the Death department, people actually
One moment they’re not kissing, and the next they are. Potter’s mouth is soft and his stubble lightly scratches Draco’s face, but it feels good, better than Potter’s tightest embrace. Potter slips his tongue into Draco’s mouth, soft and hot and wet, and Draco wants to either groan or cry. He wants Potter more than anything he’s ever wanted in his life.
He cries until he can’t anymore, feeling hollow, curled against Potter’s chest. “I hate this,” he mumbles, pressing his face into Potter’s jumper, breathing in the scent of warmth and laundry detergent.
They’re the same, Harry realizes. They’re the same and he aches to touch Malfoy, but he doesn’t. He can’t.
“Okay,” Harry says, even though this is the last thing he wants. God, Draco, his Draco—well, not ‘his’ in some senses of the word, but his enough that he can think that—
Harry thinks back to that first train ride. He has a vague recollection of seeing Malfoy, along with a brief memory of lots of sweets and Neville’s old toad, but that’s all. “I barely even remember that.”
Malfoy glanced at the flame before blowing it out, setting the match warily on the floor. He looked at Harry and consequently adopted a startled expression. “You’re… I don’t believe you’ve ever smiled at me, Potter. It’s unnerving.” He looked away, an odd look on his face.
By the time they were both back from dinner the next night, Harry’d had enough. Draco had immediately locked himself in his room upon returning, refusing to glance at Harry even once. With that on top of already having a bad day—Harry hadn’t at all been able to concentrate on anything Professor Langley was saying, making his training for the day effectively useless—he almost wanted to cry.
“I think you’re stronger than I am,” Draco admits eventually, thinking of the state he left the Manor in, half-blocked off. “I just avoid everything.”
He heard Draco draw in a deep breath beside him. “It won’t hurt me, if that’s what you’re worried about,” Draco whispered, and Harry knew he was lying but was helpless to resist the desire in his eyes.
Draco takes a deep breath, spelling the dildo to hover there. Then he adds a sticking charm at the mirror to anchor it to the floor, tosses his wand to the carpet, and grabs hold of the edges of the mirror with both hands.
“I suppose you’ll have to kick me out soon, yes?” Draco asks, bookmarking his own book with a spell.
Potter chuckles, and Draco can’t even be annoyed at him for that because then he’s swirling his tongue around the head of Draco’s cock and Draco couldn’t even straighten his thoughts out if he was Imperio’d to.
He knows that he can’t go on like this. At some point, he’s going to have to force himself to stop—or worse, Potter will realize how gone on him Draco is, and Draco will simply die of embarrassment.
“It’s all right,” Harry tells him. “Sometimes lately, I’ll walk by, and—and I’ve started to feel at peace with it.”
Draco stands in front of the club, tapping his foot nervously as he waits. He’d realized belatedly that they hadn’t specified a time, and he’s been waiting for ten minutes now, feeling out of place in the thick summer air with his his skin-tight Muggle jeans and thin black V-neck. The music trickles out in loud bursts every time someone opens the door, and Draco yearns to go in and swallow down as much Firewhisky as he can handle. He could deal with being a bit numb right now.
It starts a week and a half into their predicament, lying in bed for the night, Potter’s arm slung around Draco’s waist in a way he’s horrified to find is very comfortable. It’s then that Draco realizes, with even more horror, that Potter is a man, is wrapped around him in his bed, and that he’s rather fit to boot.
He can’t bear the idea of actually falling for him—it would be too much, too much history, too much hurt.
It didn't work either time, of course. Harry's willpower is too strong, or maybe Malfoy’s casting is too weak, or some combination of both of those things. Either way, it only serves to make Harry feel inadequate at best. He's been so useless after the war, and he can't even do
Potter pushes the sheet down. Draco gets a brief glimpse of his own cock, flushed and leaking against his stomach, and then Potter slides down the bed and licks a long stripe up his shaft.
Harry slowly nods. It’s probably good for Malfoy to talk about this, he reasons—the mind needs to process and all that, Hermione might say—so he asks another question. “Why was she in the hospital?”
Now that Potter isn’t quite as angry with him anymore, he just seems confused. Draco catches Potter watching him sometimes, curiosity in his eyes, and every time Draco thinks of asking him what he’s thinking, he stops himself.
“You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to,” Ginny smiled easily. She leaned over and patted him on the shoulder. “So what are you going to do about it? Or do you want advice?”
“Yes, of course I do,” Draco says, and maybe it’s just the teeniest bit of a lie, but she doesn’t need to know that. He pushes thoughts of wanking to Potter as far away as possible, along with thoughts of Potter’s skin against his, of wanting to rip his robes open in the middle of the Death department. They’re just fleeting fantasies of his. They don’t mean anything.
“Absolutely not,” Malfoy says, and then he reaches down and grabs at Harry’s arse, urging him to keep going, until the friction and warmth and pleasure are all too much and Harry cries out, shuddering, spilling against Malfoy.
“What are you doing in the dungeons, Potter?” Malfoy spits out, his tone sounding positively nasty—a perfect mimicry of the way he used to sound back at Hogwarts.
That’s a good sign, right? If he feels nothing then that means he can skip having his heart broken, can just pick up and keep going with his life.
At least it’s better than Hughes, better than the dankness of the Death department. Draco swears he lost a couple of years of his life working in that dark room. Time at least is brighter, if not sometimes
Later, as Harry helps Hermione wash dishes while Ron tidies up the rest of the house, Hermione asks him about it. “Have you seen Malfoy lately, then?”
“No, no, it’s fine,” Potter says, downing another swallow. “Really. I’ll need it if I want to dance at all.”
He also kind of wants to just let this play out because either this isn’t real or it’s a one-time fluke that will certainly never be happening again. And he wouldn’t be a true Slytherin if he didn’t take advantage of the fact that Potter is
that,” Draco says, frowning. “It’s…” He shakes his head, frustrated. “I can’t talk about it without revealing who he is.”
Potter is eyeing him with something like amusement, still far too close on Draco’s pillow. “Er, good morning to you, too.”
“Wait,” Potter says, sitting up suddenly, and Draco makes a put-out sound because he’d rather liked the way they’d been cuddling. “Sorry—only, I just thought—do you have a Pensieve?”
Hermione elbowed him. “Shove off, Ron. Of course we’ll be nice to him, as long as he’s not overly awful to us,” she agreed sensibly.
Draco gives him a desperate look then, wrapping his arms around himself. “It already tears me apart to be away from you, and we haven’t even mated. I don’t want to rely on you like that, because if you leave—if you left—”
“I should do the same,” Malfoy says, moving his empty glass to the edge of the table. “Places to go, blood to drink, you know.”
He won’t, of course. But he stares at Malfoy’s face, his body folded in on itself in the moonlight from the window, and wishes it were okay to want him.
When he looks up, it appears the rest of them have finished writing. Adams raises her wand and swishes it cleanly, causing the slips to soar into the air in front of her. Then, one by one, she taps them with her wand and they disintegrate into ash. “Unspeakable Bailey is assigned to the Space department,” she says, motioning to whom Harry used to know as Trainee Two. “Unspeakable Lee to the Love department,” Adams continues. “Unspeakable Knight to the Hall of Prophecy, and…” She holsters her wand. “Both Unspeakable Potter and Unspeakable Malfoy to the Death department.”
“F-fuck, that’s—you’re brilliant,” Potter says, sounding shaky as he leans down and presses a kiss to Draco’s back.
“You won’t. You won’t,” Harry shook his head in disbelief. No, no, it was impossible, this couldn’t be happening… His ears fill with a strange buzzing sound, the embodiment of his distress in the form of noise. “And… and you’re the one who doesn’t understand,” he choked out, eyes filling rapidly with tears. “I can’t do that. I… I love you, Draco, so I can’t…!”
They eat in silence for several minutes. Eventually Malfoy sighs, looking uncomfortable. “Your friends,” he says quietly. “They’re staring.”
“I thought you agreed with me,” Draco says, his words warm puffs against Harry’s chin, his eyes half-lidded.
Every time he goes to meet Malfoy, he thinks to himself that this will be the last time, all the way up until Malfoy touches him and his thoughts go slack. Some part of him wishes there was more intimacy between them, more than just sex and moans and stolen glances, more than motel rooms in the dead of night. They’re not dating in any sense of the word, but Harry can’t imagine that it’s really just sex either—it’s too intense, too full of tension, both of them clinging to each other as if it’s the only reminder that they’re still human.
. If they weren’t bonded he’d be tempted to make life so awful for Potter that Potter would voluntarily choose to leave, but then again, he supposes it would be fairly rude of him to disservice Neville by wreaking havoc on their workplace.
He has to tell himself that it’s not bloody likely. It’s just his own mind playing tricks on him, the culmination of a week full of Potter’s knee brushing against his and Potter’s scent warm in his nose.
“Oh, that’s just the short version,” Malfoy explains, flipping a hand in the air dismissively. “The long version is: I went out to too many seedy clubs trying to fuck men, and one of those men accidentally happened to be a vampire. Alas.” He gestures at himself. “Irresponsible, Father called it. At least the sex was good.”
“These things I vow in order to be accepted into the position of Unspeakable, and from this day forward, I accept the title as my own.”
“Good morning,” says Unspeakable Adams, gesturing at the five of them. “It is now time to choose your first specialty rotations. I’m sure you all have been looking forward to this.” She Summons a handful of small slips of paper, shimmering with charms. “Simply write down your first and second choice, and then the magic will sort you.”
Because Draco doesn’t need Harry. What he needs is for Harry to leave, so that he won’t be tempted to bond anymore, so that he won’t have to go against the decision he made so long ago.
He’s disappointed. It’s growing more and more clear that this is absolutely not the department he wants to be working in for the rest of his life. He hopes to Merlin that Prophecy is more interesting. He hasn’t even thought ahead to a third choice.
Harry reaches over, feeling for Draco’s hand, and squeezes it. Draco gives him a grateful smile and a sigh.
They sat in a shocked silence for only a second before Draco’s face crumpled. “Okay,” he whispered, dragging a hand through his silken hair and looking as if he were ready to cry.
“Oh, don’t get all weird about it,” Draco says, frowning. “It’s not a big deal—it’s not like I’m mooning over you or anything. It’s just that I’ve only ever really had sex with my friends, and, well. You’re the only person in the department I spend time with regularly, so...” he trails off, looking embarrassed.
When Potter comes back, he’s holding a vial of potion, and Draco instinctively flinches, staring at him in horror. “Potter, what—”
Harry has a terrible time sleeping for the rest of the night, so much so that he’s awake and out of bed early enough to catch Hermione bustling about.
Potter lets out something that sounds suspiciously like a sigh of relief, but Draco doesn’t let himself believe it until Potter smiles softly at him and says, “Oh, thank Merlin.”
And then Potter walks into the room, all muscular and unfairly attractive and smelling like warm, blissful nights spent cuddling on the couch—fuck, Draco hates this. Hates
Harry can’t decide where to put his hands. He can barely think once they set up a rhythm—he’s so heady and warm and frantic that he just wants to touch Draco everywhere he can. He slides his hands over the cool skin of his back, his shoulders, down to the swell of his arse, then back up to just under his shoulder blades. Draco meets his eyes then, searching carefully into the depths of his soul. “Wh—what?” Harry asks, breath catching on the word.
