“Yeh whoever. I don’t care.” Harry snapped.
Malfoy chuckled. “There are such things as warming charms Potter. This coat has one sewn in.” They made their way towards the kitchen, Harry taking Malfoy’s coat and hanging it carefully on his coat stand. “In Quidditch it’s pretty standard to have charms sewn into your match day kit so that you don’t get cold after the game. After experiencing a warm cloak after a match I decided that permanent warming charms were a luxury I refused to go without.”
would do that job well enough. He didn't think he'd ever dated anyone they hadn't at first idolised as the man Harry was 'finally going to settle down with', but when they inevitably broke up, the
Andromeda laughed, eyes twinkling. “Perhaps he learned his meddling from me.”
Harry balanced the joint in the ashtray on the coffee table and opened his fly, hissing slightly as the warmth of his hand surrounded his cock. He closed his eyes, imagining it was Malfoy instead, imagining Malfoy’s hands stroking and twisting, imagining Malfoy’s teasing smile as he thumbed the tip.
Draco was smiling now, but he hadn’t replied.
“You know it does.” Ron laughed. “I’ll always be here for your meltdowns mate. Especially when they’re boy related, it’s just too cute.”
The realisation scared him a little. He wasn’t sure he’d felt like this before. There had been other men in his life, of course, but those relationships had been casual, transient, physical. This, this felt different. He recognised a bubble of nerves in his chest and took a moment to appreciate how different the sensation felt to the dread and anxiety he’d been carrying around with him for the past few years. Maybe Hermione was on to something with this whole thinking thing.
“Agreed.” Malfoy was tucking his shirt into his trousers. “Now sleep tight princess, but do try not to fall asleep down here. I presume you have a large number of bedrooms in this house.”
“Thanks, you’re a lifesaver. I thought I could spare one of the staff but it’s manic out there.”
Harry really hoped he wasn’t blushing. Andromeda clearly thought his caution stemmed from their being on opposite sides of the war, not that Harry was currently trying to do everything in his power not to be affected by the memory of the man pushing his tongue into Harry’s arse the other night.
If this went wrong he was blaming Ron.
“I want to get these ones.” Teddy explained, pointing at the pair of shoes he was holding.
He adjusted his bowtie nervously. He hadn’t seen Malfoy arrive yet.
Malfoy was on him as soon as they landed, pulling him in for a rough kiss before pressing their bodies together and mouthing down the side of Harry’s neck.
“Yeh and if you want to be the one to break his tiny dreams, you can do that.”
He felt the pleasure building and he couldn’t help but push back against Draco’s finger. He groaned loudly as Draco grazed his teeth against his balls again and then suddenly, sharply, he felt his orgasm crest. His dick twitched hard and he shot his load across the wall of the shower. Draco pulled his mouth away but kept his finger held in place as Harry moaned through the aftershocks.
“You mean Draco?” Teddy asked. His voice sounded normal so Harry allowed himself to relax slightly.
Malfoy grinned and then flipped Harry onto his front. Harry felt him crawl up the bed, his trousers rubbing up against Harry’s naked calfs. Harry shivered at the image, him, naked, hard dick trapped against the covers, Malfoy, on top, fully dressed. Then he felt a warm breath against his hole and he lost the ability to think at all.
"Thank you." Harry interrupted. "If you could just not bring this up in front of your family." While there was no one else in the kitchen currently, a moment alone in this house was a rare thing.
“Thanks. Bill taught me this one. He spends a lot of time in Egypt and the Middle East.”
Harry slunk lower in his chair. “I know I know, just-” he sighed “-he’s just so goddamn hot. Do you know how hard it is to sit opposite that man and not think about going home with him?”
“Enjoying the view?” Draco was hovering next to him now, Teddy having shot off towards the goal posts.
But today was a new day. He didn’t have a bullpen full of new recruits to worry about. In fact, he didn’t have anything to worry about at all. It was a new feeling, but he liked it.
He settled between Draco’s legs and looked up. Draco was pushing his underwear down slightly, pulling out his cock. Harry reached up to grab Draco’s hips but Draco pulled back. “Keep your hands behind your back.” he ordered gently, eyes meeting Harry’s to check his reaction. Harry sighed deeply and complied. This was perfect.
“I get what you mean.” Ron replied. “It wouldn’t be for me. But honestly mate, I think you’d be good at it.”
“Ohmygod can we not?” Harry cringed.
Harry barely had time to think through what the man was talking about before Malfoy had pushed him back onto the bed and bent over him, taking Harry’s cock straight into his mouth. Harry’s mind went blank, all he could focus on was hot, wet, tight as Malfoy bobbed up and down on his cock.
Harry felt himself blush. “He and I have err-” He scratched the back of his neck. “We’ve err-” Merlin how was he supposed to phrase this.
He pushed Malfoy off him. “Fuck!”
Of course he valued her friendship, and there were times where her whimsical sense of humour was refreshing, but the day after your friend has been dumped? Well, today he didn't think she deserved the leniency. He'd only apologised because he knew he was in a foul mood and had certainly been more heavy handed with his words than perhaps he'd intended. But he wouldn't take it back.
"Good thing we bought him some special Christmas juice isn't it Rose? He might not feel so funny afterwards."
Harry grabbed the Firebolt. “You’re on.” he nodded.
Draco and Harry arrived back at Harry’s later that afternoon. They’d dropped a giddy but tired Teddy back at Andromeda’s before apparating together. To Andromeda’s dismay, and to Harry’s relief, she’d accepted their refusal to stay for tea. She looked like she had a lot of questions for them both, but all Harry wanted right now was Draco all to himself, and definitely a shower.
“Oh really?” Malfoy shifted in his chair and Harry was sorely tempted to run his foot up the inside of Malfoy’s thigh. But he resisted, this would be a delicate game. Malfoy wasn’t giving anything away.
“Mmm.” Malfoy replied, slowly pressing his hips forward. “You feel incredible. You take me so well.”
Harry had been pleasantly surprised and distinctly relieved to find a note from Malfoy when he’d woken up that morning. He had never been the best judge of whether his crushes were requited, much to the amusement of his friends, but this time, instead of Harry asking Malfoy out, Malfoy had asked Harry out. Harry had suggested dinner at his house in a shameless attempt to get Malfoy back into his bed and had been delighted when Malfoy had agreed.
“Do you mind?” Harry asked hopefully.
Ron thrust a cracker into his face and Harry closed one eye to ensure he managed to grab hold of the other end as the room spun around them. There was a loud bang followed by a cloud of glitter and Harry found himself wearing a party hat and holding a pair of furry handcuffs.
“Oh Merlin I’d forgotten about that!” Harry groaned. “How do you remember that? In fact, how are you okay?”
An indeterminate number of hours later, he really couldn’t be sure, Harry was sprawled on the sofa next to Ron trying very hard to focus the conversation happening in front of him.
The sound of his voice shattered the tension between them and Harry surged upwards capturing Malfoy’s lips with a soft sigh. He felt a hand settle on the small of his back as Malfoy leaned into him, kissing back slowly, carefully. Harry felt a warmth flutter through his body that had nothing to do with the kiss and everything to do with being surrounded by the other man. But then Malfoy bit his lower lip gently, just how Harry liked, and all thoughts of slowly and carefully went out the window.
“Go on, kiss already!” Teddy shouted, startling them both.
“Yeh, I like it like this.” Harry replied. And it was true, he liked the feeling of that first press, the slight burn, the cold shiver followed by warm tingling pleasure.
Draco walked over and pulled Harry close by his belt loops. “I am being serious.” he said quietly, then he was leaning forward and pressing a kiss to Harry’s lips. “Hey, relax.” he said, running his hands up and down the outside of Harry’s arms. “Why don’t we go to Diagon for coffee?” he asked.
Harry smiled. “I was with someone, but now-” His thoughts turned to Malfoy, again catching him by surprise. “Maybe.” he added. As much as he enjoyed Tuesday night, one shag did by no means make for an exclusive arrangement. Still, interesting how his mind went there again, even surrounded by scores of potential hookups.
Harry chuckled. “You’re right. And I am trying to think things through properly, this time.”
Ron wrapped an arm around him. "Well, why not think about it this Christmas, you know, as things get quieter? Take some time to think about everything and plan it out."
“Something you want, Potter?” Malfoy asked, eyebrows raised. A lock of hair had fallen out of his fringe and Harry couldn’t help but think what he’d look like with it properly mussed.
“Of course, of course!” Luna rushed over. Perhaps business was slow today. No demand for pets that didn’t exist he thought, a little unkindly.
actually was the first thing on his mind, but only as a certain dull ache reminded him of the night before.
Teddy reached for the closest letter and started to flatten it out before Harry snatched it from him, blushing. He did not need his fourteen year old godson reading what he’d written so far.
Much later he found himself back at the bar in need of one last whisky. He’d only just managed to escape a conversation with some donor or other that Kingsley simply insisted he must meet. He wasn’t drunk, perhaps pleasantly buzzed, but one more wouldn’t hurt, then he could head home and maybe even roll a gillyweed joint. That should help him sleep. Or he could find someone to take home, a good orgasm never failed to knock him out.
“Ah yes. You wanted him to try some of mine.” Harry nodded. “I should have them back mid next week if that works?” Malfoy asked.
It was currently five minutes to seven, the food was ready, there was a bottle of red on the table, and Harry was wearing the tightest pair of jeans that he owned.
“Which makes you perfectly placed to consult on wards.” Ron challenged, eyebrows raised. He took a sip of his tea. “Look, so what you’re a bit more chaotic, at least you know it. And you’re working on it. Look at you, you’ve said more sensible shit in the past two weeks than I’ve heard from you in years.”
Dean was holding a shocking pink dildo looking blankly at Seamus, a matching pink beret balanced precariously on his head. Meanwhile Seamus looked like he was having trouble breathing, tears of laughter streaming down his face.
“Were you training today?” Harry asked. “It was nice weather for flying, when the sun was out at least.”
“Tongue.” Draco requested, and Harry complied, letting Draco slowly push the tip of his cock up and down against it. The slight tang of precome and the dull taste of skin made Harry's mouth water. He breathed steadily as Draco continued to tease himself with Harry’s mouth. Harry felt saliva running down his chin, his own neglected cock was pressing against his joggers, almost painfully, but he tried to ignore it. He glanced up at Draco and noticed with delight that Draco’s composure was slipping. He had his head tipped back slightly, eyes closed, and it looked as if he was putting a lot of effort into not thrusting forward.
Harry pushed his jeans and pants down to mid-thigh giving himself more space to pick up the pace. His free hand gently pulled on his balls as he imagined Malfoy pushing one hand in the centre of his chest, holding him down as he stroked him.
“I didn’t say that!” he retorted. She glared at him.
Finishing his drink, he decided that a night out wasn’t for him. He found an empty side street nearby and apparated home.
Draco looked him up and down and Harry felt himself blush. “Quite.” Draco grinned. “Well you’ll have to take me out then.” Draco suggested, pouting.
The canevnous ballroom was tastefully decorated. Thousands of suspended sparkling snowflakes drifted gently, and no-drip icicles adorned the floating podium tables dotted around the room. A gap in the crowd drew Harry’s eyes to an ice sculpture, a dragon, wings outstretched, it’s majestic swoop literally frozen.
They were almost at her office now, and Harry noted with delight that the gargoyles were still in place. When they made it to the circular room, Harry took a moment to look around. While there were fewer spindly objects now, there were many many more books. Harry supposed it made sense. Where Dumbledore had been powerful and political, McGonagall was much more academic. He nodded briefly at the portrait of the man himself where he snoozed, and noted with slight sadness that Snape was missing from his frame. He’d hoped to pass on a hello from Draco. When he’d mentioned his trip to Draco the day before, Draco had asked Harry to pass his message along.
“That’s it darling, like that. Perfect.” Draco breathed. If he could still talk, Harry thought, then Harry wasn’t doing his job. He redoubled his efforts, picking up the pace. His jaw ached, but he kept going, bobbing his head back and forth. His own cock was desperate for attention but he kept his arms in place, knowing that Draco would more than return the favour afterwards.
Harry looked to his right. The man in question was still asleep, breathing deeply, blonde hair still unfairly well-styled. Harry absently wondered whether he slept with a charm in. He wouldn’t be surprised if he did.
Draco kissed him slowly. “Not this time Potter. Dry off, then I want you on the bed. I’m going to wash my hair, and when I come back, I want you laid out for me with a plug in your arse, ready for me. I’m sure you’ve got one.”
Harry moved to grip Malfoy’s arse, giving him a small push, a subtle suggestion for Malfoy to move. The other man seemed to get the message. Malfoy began to slowly fuck his mouth, so Harry moved one hand to his own throbbing dick and began to wank in time with Malfoy’s thrusts.
” dragged him straight back to his Hogwarts days.
Either way, Harry thought as he pulled out the tray, it was time to get the dish under a stasis. After hours of lessons from Molly over the years, he thought of himself as a relatively good cook, but cooking for a date added an extra level of stress that at this very moment, he could really do without.
“No problem.” Harry replied, smiling. “Uncle Harry to the rescue.”
“Good boy.” Draco said again. Merlin if those words weren’t sending Harry wild.
“I’m happy to be of assistance, I’m not doing anything today. Have you got anything in the back though? I’m not sure how I feel about being on display.” He’d already noticed a few less than subtle glances, and while for now he was mostly hidden by the large Christmas tree next to the counter, he was sure it was only a matter of time before someone gained the confidence to come and introduce themselves.
"I can't believe I'm saying this but it sounds like you need to ask Malfoy out. Like you said, he was here four days ago. For all you know Malfoy arrived at the same time as Rory and then decided to take the photo together for fun."
He was packing up the samples when Luna looked at him airily. “I never really thought your auras were particularly well matched, you know. So perhaps it’s no bad thing.”
They made it to his bathroom without incident, although Harry was sure he was going to miss a step on the stairs. He spelled the shower on and the room quickly filled with steam. They stripped in silence, Draco’s dark eyes expressing how he felt more succinctly than words could.
“I think I’m going to head home too.” Harry announced.
“He was there. It was really good. He said it was really good!”
Harry chuckled. It was so easy to fall back into their teenage days when they were all together. Well, their earlier, happier teenage days perhaps. It was all stupid jokes and laughter like they were still in dorms. Their meetups had quietened down slightly when Neville had finally got together with Hannah, but she was outnumbered in their circle of Gryffindors.
“Alright, enough, leave him be.” Hermione admonished, pulling Hugo back onto her lap from where he’d been trying to lean over the arm of the sofa. “Have fun on your date!”
Harry looked at him quizzically.
“I’m in the study.” Harry called back, surveying the mess in front of him. His desk was covered in crumpled pieces of parchment, each a discarded attempt at a letter to Malfoy. Artimus was perched close by looking mildly annoyed at the amount of time she’d been waiting.
“Ooh Draco is it?”
"Christmas crackers!" Neville was shouting. Neville hadn’t joined them in trying Ron’s mystery alcohol, which even in his current state Harry recognised had been a wise choice.
“Mione and me are trying to teach them Muggle and magical festivals. ”Ron whispered. “When Rose heard about Santa’s grotto she insisted she come and help. She’s like her mum, trying to help the elves!”
Ron laughed. “Yeh I bet Malfoy would be able to spot a wonky bowtie from half a mile off.”
“But that’s how I know I like him.” Harry insisted. “We barely spoke and we just had this, Merlin this is going to sound so cliché, we had this
“It wasn’t hard to find.” he replied. “Also, the security at this place is terrible. I just walked right in, and I couldn’t only feel very basic wards. Nothing that felt like it would dissuade malicious intent at least, just your usual muggle-repelling stuff.”
“Are you going to be allowed to wear these at school?” he asked, eyeing the shoes sceptically. Harry strongly suspected that the gleaming white trainers did not meet the Hogwarts uniform requirements.
“You’re speaking to me like you’re speaking to your daughter!” Harry joked.
Ron laughed. “I’ll see myself out.”
Then seeing him with Teddy had only added another layer of confusion. He’d never introduced any of his previous boyfriends to the boy, but now it felt different. He could picture dinners at Andromeda’s, quidditch in the autumn, waving goodbye when Teddy took the train back to school.
“Of course.” Malfoy replied, a touch of humour in his voice. “Do you not believe me?” he asked at Harry’s slightly narrowed eyes.
“Merlin Harry, I’m going to come.” Draco choked out above him. “Are you close?”
Harry could feel his frustration growing again, but then Rose came in, eyeing them both cautiously. “Daddy can I show you my drawing now?” she asked.
“That’s the second time I’ve seen you glance at the front door Harry. Expecting someone?” she enquired with a faintly amused expression.
The team landed and dismounted and Harry saw Malfoy scan the stands as he packed up his broom. He nodded once when his eye’s found Harry and Harry waved. Should he go down?
She smiled, sadly. “I know I am Harry. On this at least.” she looked at the clock above the counter. “Look, I have to get back, but don’t think we’re done talking about Malfoy. And think about what I said okay?”
He had, of course, not wanted to come, but Kingsley had personally requested his presence. Harry had agreed, knowing full well that ‘his presence’ was likely to help lobby persuadable members of the more conservative opposition group on some piece of legislation or other. He generally indulged Kingsley when he made these requests, mainly because Harry thought that Kingsley was a good bloke doing a thankless job, but also because Hermione regularly asked him to use his strong personal relationship with the Minister to gain insight into upcoming policy.
Ron looked very uncomfortable but replied. “Malfoy.”
“I’m ready Malfoy. Fuck me.” he said.
He took a sip of his tea and tipped his head back against the sofa. Teddy hadn’t stopped talking about their upcoming day flying with Draco, chattering all afternoon about brooms and maneuvers. But right now the idea of getting on a broom tomorrow seemed impossible, especially in front of Draco. An embarrassingly large part of him was gearing up to snatch the snitch right from under Draco’s nose, just like in their school days, although his slightly more realistic side said that Draco was a professional Quidditch player these days and was hardly going to lose to someone who’d played a handful of pick up games over the past year. In fact, the last time he’d even been on a broom was that disaster of a chase right before he’d quit the Aurors.
"Hermione look at him!" Ron exclaimed. "He really likes him."
Harry smiled at her no nonsense attitude. Since becoming a mother she’d managed to become, if possible, even better at being productive with short amounts of time. He didn’t know how she did it. “Right, okay. Let’s start with McGonagall.” He paused, realising that he had absolutely no idea where to start. “Just, help?” he asked pleadingly.
They arrived at a small packing table after Ron had stopped to give an update to a few members of staff who were just arriving for the afternoon shift.
Harry let out a breath. On some level he’d always known that Ron would understand, but he was relieved to hear it. Ron had always been his biggest supporter in the force, even after he’d quit to work with George. He’d often act as a sounding board for Harry’s ideas, and a friendly ear who understood Harry's situation when something frustrating had happened. He was a strategic thinker both inside and outside of work, something Harry had yet to master. Harry was truly lucky to count him among his friends.
He actually hadn’t seen Malfoy yet, but they were right, they needed their own time to catch up. Though as luck would have it, by the time he made himself over to the makeshift bar he noticed Malfoy arriving. He looked stunning as always, almost dangerously good looking in a black velvet tuxedo. It should have washed him out, but instead the contrast made him look very sexy indeed. Harry gambled and ordered him an elf made wine, then, taking a deep breath, he made for where Malfoy was just finishing up with Luna.
“Who might have an idea whether they have any teaching positions open at Hogwarts at the moment?” she prompted.
“Did I not give you enough last night?” Draco bit Harry’s earlobe. “Was having your arse plugged then fucked not enough?” He breathed over the shell and Harry whimpered. “I bet you’re still nice and open for me aren’t you?”
Harry scoffed. “Bullshit.”
Malfoy smiled. “Tell Weasley I’ll buy him a beer.” He took a sip of his drink and Harry watched him swallow. Merlin this was hot. “You’re right, and I did say the team had been welcoming.” He paused. “It doesn’t hurt to be cautious though.”
"Merlin’s pants mate, it’s bigger than my arm!" Seamus shouted to the room, elbow balanced on the table, his forearm running alongside in comparison. "It might even be bigger than Neville’s knob!" Neville resolutely ignored him, but Harry spotted Hannah’s blush.
I'm so sorry that I'm so behind. I've been really ill. There's no way I'm giving up on this though. Thank you for sticking with me!
Harry grinned. “You daddy has a very important job.”
He looked like he had something else to say, but Harry wasn’t so sure he wanted to hear it tonight. Soon, yes. But maybe not tonight. “I thought that perhaps you were only interested in hooking up?” Harry asked. “You seemed quite keen on leaving my flat last week.”
He looked up at Hermione. “I think this-” he nodded at the drink, “-rather undermines my outburst.” he offered.
“No Harry it’s not funny. I don’t care about the wards, but I’m worried about you. You’re rushing into things.”
“Hmm, I can see how that would work for you.” Ron agreed.
“They have two kids.”
Harry found himself nodding. Next time.
“Thanks so much Harry, you’re the best!”
Malfoy had one hand holding Harry in place and the other was frantically undoing his own buttons, revealing inch by tantalising inch of pale skin and sharp collarbones. A flash of silver caught Harry’s eye and he tried to pull himself back to reality. Hadn’t he resolved to apologise?
“You do?” Harry managed to reply, despite the fact that he wanted nothing less than to melt into his chair. It’s not that he didn’t feel comfortable sharing this with Andromeda, after all, she was Draco’s aunt, but he didn’t expect to have the conversation so soon.
if she’d known he’d traded a deep and meaningful conversation for shower sex.
“Are you sure you won’t stay for dinner?” Andromeda asked.
“Oh no thanks, not right now.” Harry replied.
Ron groaned. “Mum sent them. She must have knitted them in June! I was planning to get a photo of us all wearing them all just to keep her happy but it turns out that they’re quite cosy.” he admitted. “I think she knitted warming charms into them.”
"Harry, you're blushing. What's going on in here?" She asked, levitating a ladle of mulled wine into her own mug.
He nodded, his body almost acting on autopilot. “Mine?”
“Stop messing with it, you look great.” Hermione chastised. “Just leave everything as it is.”
“I was just telling Harry here to keep his hands off his suit if he wants to impress Malfoy.”
“Might you consider it?” McGonagall, as if sensing his enthusiasm.
Harry could hear her crisp Scottish accent in his head as he read. Trust McGonagall to send such a formal letter. He imagined her wry smile as she wrote the words ‘embarking on a new career path’. There was no doubt that she had heard of his less than professional exit from the Aurors.
“Good.” Malfoy replied. “It sounds like you dived into the Aurors with no consideration about what you actually wanted to do. You should take all the time in the world, it’s not like you're short of money.”
Ron winced in sympathy. "Admittedly they only get this hyped in the build up to Christmas, it's infectious." He conjured more water into Harry's plastic cup. "Still feeling last night?"
Ron was the first to respond with an arm around the shoulder, pulling Harry’s body roughly towards his. "Tough luck mate."
Well, this was unexpected. He felt a flash of momentary guilt that in all his daydreaming about Malfoy he’d not really given any thought to what he might do for work now that he’d quit the Aurors. Given all the Christmas gatherings and days out the last two weeks had felt more like a holiday than permanent unemployment. He definitely needed coffee to get through this development.
Andromeda just smiled. “He seemed like he might be your type.” she added mischievously.
As he surveyed the garden, he thought about what he’d do that day. Hermione had told him to think, so he would. But he’d start small.
“Look Harry.” She began again. “I’m not saying that things have turned out how I planned at the Ministry. And I’m lucky that I have Ron and the kids to keep me grounded. But I want to keep going, it’s the right thing to do.”
"Okay yes." Harry replied. He supposed there was no harm in it. The worst that could happen was that he'd lose a potentially good fuck buddy, really. But if Malfoy said yes… Harry felt a small grin tug the corners of his lips.
“Thank you Harry.” she replied sincerely, vanishing the mess he’d made. “It’s a family recipe. Ted used to make the filling and I’d do the pastry.” she said wistfully. “And now I’m teaching young Teddy. Although I’m not sure if I ever manage to keep his attention on the measurements, you know fourteen year old boys!”
“What about you though. How’s your life of leisure treating you? Mimosas in your pyjamas?”
"Merlin, Ron, enough." Harry pleaded before they were interrupted. As if on queue Harry heard the sound of footsteps and was relieved to see Hermione enter the room.
Harry’s momentary good mood dropped. "Oh right, yes. He’s not coming. We broke up." He turned to Hermione who had just come in from the kitchen and was now looking at him with poorly masked sympathy. "Sorry I forgot to mention." He turned back to the table. "More food for everyone else though?" he offered into the silence of the room.
“Oh don’t waggle your eyebrows Ron, you were the one who said I should do this.” Harry replied, part exasperated, part just wanted to get his friend to leave. “Look, I’ll catch you up on it another time, but I really don’t want Draco to leave if you get what I’m saying.”
“Sorry, excuse me.” A nervous looking waitress had just arrived at his shoulder and was looking at him a little like he was going to explode. “Christmas hot chocolate for table 3?”
Luna looked at him thoughtfully. "Maybe you should head home and run a bath Harry. I can give you a bundle of herbs which are
was a thorn in his side, constantly referring his present to his past, but he didn’t read articles about himself.
to be relaxing." He didn't miss the passive aggressive emphasis she put on the word proven, but he chose not to engage.
Harry grinned. Teddy was in the shower, so they had little chance of being overheard, but he enjoyed their conspiratorial conversation nonetheless. The fact that the room was lit only by the Christmas tree in the corner rather added to the secrecy.
Harry remained silent but he strongly suspected that his blush was giving him away.
Harry set the cup in the sink and headed upstairs to get changed. Either way, it was ten thirty on a Tuesday, and Malfoy wasn’t around, even if a surprisingly large part of Harry wanted him to be.
"Your husband is bullying me." Harry complained. "Make him stop."
Harry laughed. “I’m sure. I’ll try to stay presentable. I have Hermione to thank, she styled me tonight.”
Harry sighed. That was probably the best he was going to get. He’d always struggled saying no to his godson. “Okay, but don’t even think about wearing them to potions, you’ll ruin them”
Harry looked back. Draco’s hair was pressed against his head and his face was flushed from the heat of the shower, and from what he’d just been doing. His own cock was very hard between his legs.
“I can believe that.” he said, thinking of their own student days.
Arriving back in Islington, he kicked off his shoes, set the coffee machine and drank a large glass of water. He filled up the glass again and placed it on the table. The
She magicked open the heavy doors and led the way through the empty great hall. It felt slightly unsettling, it being so quiet, but he supposed that term had finished. It was hard not to reminisce about his school days, the lazy weekend breakfasts and school cup wins. Taking a deep breath, he took a moment to acknowledge how it had looked after the war. It was different now, the colourful Christmas lights and decorations adorning the walls instead. Their footsteps echoed across the stone. “Is that what we’re doing?” Harry asked cheekily. “Discussing my career prospects?”
Her party this year was no different. Despite the freezing temperatures, it was taking place outside. On arrival, all guests were given a pebble with a warming charm of Luna’s own creation. Not only did it keep each guest toasty as they stood in the garden, but when you began a conversation with someone else the two charms apparently merged to create a larger warming bubble. Luna had informed Harry that this was to encourage, in her words,
"That's more like it mate!"
“I am.” Harry replied. “Very much so.” He paused to shake out his napkin before refolding it across his lap. “Are you?”
“Fuck.” Harry swore, partly at Draco’s words, and partly at the sensation of Draco tonguing his balls.
Harry prepared to throw the portkey not wanting to waste another moment. He was already working over time and now this. Stefano was no doubt going to hit him with passive aggressive stinging hexes all evening.
“Oh Merlin I remember that. Just one of the many reasons why I feel so terrible today.”
As he folded and taped, his mind wandered to Malfoy. There wasn’t anything he could to stop it. Seeing the man yesterday had given him a lot to think about, in more sense than one. He couldn’t deny the visceral reaction he’d had to Malfoy in his quidditch gear. Of course the man had looked phenomenally sexy, almost stereotypically so, with his leather and windswept hair making as if he'd stepped straight off the pages of one of Seamus’s dirty magazines. But seeing him like that had triggered something deep in Harry’s subconscious too, memories of schoolboy competition, memories tinged with frustration, that now, nearly twenty years on, Harry could accept were perhaps more complicated than a straightforward rivalry.
“Fuck!” Harry exclaimed into the night. This time it got a reaction, an elderly witch looked at him disapprovingly. He threw the coin to the ground and apparated home. He needed a beer.
“Is he around today?” Harry asked. He didn’t pop into the Weasley’s as much as he used to, but he always enjoyed catching up with Ron’s brothers. He’d even stayed relatively close with Ginny despite never reconciling
Five hours later, after three rounds of living room gymnastics, one film, two tantrums (both Hugo), and more requests to try his Auror broom than he thought it possible for a fourteen year-old to make, Ron, Hermione, Rose, Teddy, Hugo, and Harry were all seated around Harry's large oak kitchen table eating swiss roll with hot chocolate. The Weasley-‘Potter’ Christmas get together was now an established Christmas tradition, and Harry was quietly relieved that Teddy still wanted to come. He and Harry normally had their own Christmas day out too, but Harry was happy to see that Teddy still had time for Rose and Hugo - they both certainly looked up to him like a big brother, following him everywhere, Rose peppering him with questions.
"Why are you wearing sunglasses inside?" Rose enquired loudly, and Harry barely managed not to wince.
Harry shook his head. “No, but I want to watch you.” Harry was delighted to see that he’d made Draco blush. He felt Draco’s rhythm stutter and Harry kept his eyes focused on Draco’s face as he watched him close his eyes and groan. Harry thought he looked beautiful.
Harry took a moment to roll his shoulders in an attempt to loosen up his back. He could still feel the effects of yesterday’s digging.
“Of course it can.” Ron nodded. “But have you actually told him? I was under the impression the two times you’ve seen each other in the last five years were, how can I say this, a drunken hookup and a booty call?” He looked at Harry sternly.
“Uncle Harry!” Rose shouted as he tumbled through the floo into their living room. They were in the middle of watching a film, all four of them snuggled up on the sofa.
“I know you didn’t say that Harry. But I was catching up with Luna last night and she said that you had shut her down rather abruptly when she brought him on Friday.” she said pointedly.
. It was as close as he could get to entertaining her eccentricity without calling her out. He’d had enough arguments about nargles to last him a lifetime, and now he just hoped that a slightly glazed expression wasn’t too much a giveaway of how he really felt.
This was not what he needed this morning. He’d tried calling Stefano when he got home to no answer, and the note he’d sent afterwards had been returned unopened. He supposed he deserved nothing less, but it still stung. They’d been dating long distance since the summer, and although it hadn’t been particularly intense, Harry found himself sad at the prospect of not spending time with him again. They’d been pretty compatible in the bedroom too, professional quidditch left Stefano with more than enough upper body strength to bend Harry into the perfect position.
“Mmm yes, like that darling.” Malfoy encouraged as Harry felt him bottom out. “When you’re ready, put your hands on my chest, I want to watch you fuck yourself on me.”
A sharp rap at the front door jolted him from his musings and he flattened his hair as he made his way past the thankfully silent mirror in the hallway.
Was Malfoy flirting with him, or just taking the piss? Harry was notoriously bad at spotting whether someone liked him. He generally preferred clubs. At least when someone was grinding against him he could be sure.
“You’re right.” Harry continued, taking a seat. “While I both understand and respect your reasons for inviting me here, I have to politely decline. I don’t think I’m ready to teach, not yet at least.”
“Oi Harry mate, looking fly!” Ron handed him another mulled wine and leaned in to kiss Hermione. “The queue for drinks was pretty long so I got us all another round.”
Hermione raised her eyebrows further than he thought it was possible for them to go.
“Alright alright!” Harry protested. “I’m incredibly lucky to have you both in my life, and Ron, I need all the interventions I can get. Happy now?”
“Are you having a nice evening?” Malfoy asked him after the main course had been cleared.
He was fixed in a staring contest with a chameleon when Luna exclaimed. “Oh I know this one. This is a feather from a specific type of red bird of paradise. I forget the name but I can look it up for you. Their feathers are not at all common in Europe, they don’t travel well.”
I promise that Draco arrives next chapter!
She looked surprised. “I only meant that-”
“Nice jumper.” Draco said to Ron, and then, in nothing but his underwear, he walked past Ron and out of the room.
“Okay okay maybe two.”
Friday night and he was heading home for a bath. This wasn't how he thought this weekend would go.
“It sounds like a great idea. Really. However-” He paused. “Given that I’m not currently employed, perhaps I wouldn’t be the best example?”
“Oh you are on! Rose! Hugo!” Ron called up the stairs. “Grab your coats, Uncle Harry says you can practice throwing snowballs at him!”
“I’m sure you would have sent me back if I’d chosen wrong.” Harry responded.
Malfoy laughed. “Trust you to have a natural intuition for something it takes most people years to learn. You should start your own security consultancy, maybe the Falcons could be your first client.”
Harry smiled. “You know I am.” He leaned over to give Draco a quick peck on the cheek. “You’re making it difficult for me to sit on this broom.”
“Oh, yes. Of course. That.. makes sense.”
Harry almost spat out the tea he’d just drunk. “I don’t know, why can’t it be both?”
“If it’s specialist brooms he’s interested in, he could always ask Draco now he’s back in the country. I imagine he’d have all sorts, what with him playing professional quidditch.”
Malfoy took a moment to take a sip of wine. “Honestly, there’s always been something that has intrigued me when it comes to you. You have this
Harry arrived back downstairs a short while later to find Rose quietly colouring and Hugo playing with a unicorn toy. Harry left them to it and headed to the kitchen.
Harry smiled. He quite liked the dynamic between them. Malfoy was confident, pushy even, but at the same time he gave Harry the space to lead. There was no mistaking that the man was a top, but Harry felt empowered rather than overshadowed. He liked it. He’d been frustrated in relationships before where the other person had simply assumed that he was generally more submissive, just because he bottomed in bed. Malfoy, on the other hand, seemed to strike a good balance.
Harry was moaning shamelessly, the noises he was making echoing over the sound of the water. Draco had a finger inside of him now while he continued to use his mouth to pleasure Harry’s balls. He grazed them carefully with his teeth and Harry groaned, collapsing forward, face now pressed against the inside of his elbow.
"Shush Ron." She turned to Harry. "I'm really happy for you." She said sincerely, and then suddenly Harry felt himself gathered up into a heartfelt hug. She kissed his cheek affectionately and looked into his eyes. "I'm really proud of you Harry."
“Thanks.” he said. “When did you leave last night anyway? I don’t remember you going?"
Harry nodded dumbly, and he felt his spent cock twitch in agreement.
“I rather think it was I who invited you.” McGonagall replied wryly. “Inside with you, it’s much too cold to be talking about your career prospects outside the front doors.”
Harry nearly spat out his wine as he tried desperately to pull his mind out of the gutter. Picturing Malfoy, flies open, pushing Harry to his knees, was not helping. “No, you’re right. I want to do this properly."
“Indeed. I’m sure it’ll work, but we can talk about it on the way to the bar. I need another drink.”
Harry looked at her blankly.
Malfoy looked at him, a calculating expression on his face. “I’d say you were fishing, but you actually want to know, don’t you?”
"Thanks Dean." Harry replied. Dean had always been the calmer of the two, and since he and Seamus had gone exclusive a couple of years back Harry had noticed that even Seamus was comfortable with a quiet night in nowadays, so it was nice they were offering.
As soon as he heard Ron step into the floor he was rushing up the stairs as fast as was physically possible with a raging erection. Fucking hell. Draco better still be naked, he thought.
, about returning to the UK. I’m sure you haven’t forgotten that I didn’t leave on the best of terms.”
“I remember you always liked to dive. The Cleansweap is good for quick changes in direction.”
“Harry, that’s far too generous!” Andromeda insisted.
prints that picture of him necking Malfoy tomorrow.”
“Uncle Harry Uncle Harry, are you staying to watch the film with us?” Rose asked, excitedly.
“Where are your priorities?” Draco looked mortally offended by the idea that someone could put off replacing their only source of caffeine.
Malfoy clinked his glass against Harry’s. “That makes two of us.”
“Draco will be staying for dinner Harry. Are you sure you have to go?” Andromeda asked.
“You sure?” Malfoy asked, propping himself up on one elbow.
Harry nodded, slightly overcome with emotion. Her use of his first name was no doubt intentional.
"Saw these at
“Nuh uh.” Draco breathed into Harry’s ear, making the hairs on the back of his neck stand up in pleasure. “Not yet darling.” Draco continued massaging his arse, long fingers gently pulling him open, teasing his hole. “I’d quite like to see your beautiful mouth wrapped around my cock first.” he said.
“So am I to believe that you’ve left a life of catching Britain’s most dangerous criminals-” Malfoy paused dramatically. “-for babysitting?”
He took a deep breath.
“Touché. Are you saying I should settle down now Malfoy?”
“A little.” Harry replied. And that was the truth. Towards the end of the meal they’d had their first stilted conversation about the war, the almost-finished bottle of wine giving them both the liquid courage they’d needed. Malfoy had mentioned conversationally that he’d tried his first glass of wine with Snape, which had led to a surprisingly respectful conversation about the man. Malfoy had given Harry the space to talk through his mixed feelings, and Harry had stayed quiet as Malfoy expressed his sadness at how things had ended up. They’d actually ended up toasting the man’s memory. It had been a sobering but poignant moment.
“Whatever Malfoy, I’ll sort it out tomorrow.” He could already feel his eyelids closing. “That was fun Malfoy, good suggestion.”
Ron leaned towards him, briefly looking over his shoulder to check whether anyone was in earshot. “Hermione tells me that perhaps you enjoyed yourself after all, if you get what I’m saying.” He nudged Harry in the ribs playfully. “Are you going to see him again?”
Harry pinched the bridge of his nose. "Can you please stop." It was embarrassing enough to talk about this, let alone when Ron was very much on the money. Draco had insisted on taking him home and fucking him through the mattress after their public debut. That man had a possessive streak a mile wide and Harry’s body was definitely still feeling the consequences.
“No no, I couldn’t. You’ve already done so much today! Thank you anyway.” Harry insisted. As much as he loved spending time with Teddy and Andromeda, after an afternoon of small talk he needed some alone time. There were only times you could say ‘Actually I’m taking a break from work at the moment’ or ‘No no, single, like last year’ without needing to spend some time in a dark room.
“I felt that too.”
Malfoy wasn’t bad looking though. Harry took a surreptitious glance. He was pretty stunning actually, all legs and lean muscle, slightly taller than him, just what Harry liked. Harry was single now, and he hadn’t got laid in a couple of weeks.
“Oh stop it you two, you have company.” Harry said, taking another sip of his drink.
He paused to look up at Harry. “Can I say that you fancy him?” He asked, eyes glinting.
“Did you sponsor this thing Malfoy!?” Harry exclaimed, breaking the silence.
“Don’t worry yourself dear.” Andromeda cut in, interrupting his floundering. “I know.” she grinned.
“What are you doing here then?” Harry asked. “I mean, If you don’t even live in the UK then I’m pretty sure you don’t work here.”
“You know me.” he replied. “Act first, think later.”
Luna didn’t host a Christmas event every year, but when she did, Harry always thought she did it well. Usually there was good food, good friends, and just enough of the unexpected to keep things from feeling dry. Her events could always be described as unique which Harry felt was a welcome change to the circuit of parties and galas that usually took place at this time of year.
Harry relished every noise, every sigh, every curse. His lack of gag reflex was something previous partners had wondered at, and he put it to good use, taking all of Draco’s sizable cock into his throat each time.
, he often found that people struck up a conversation with him simply because they recognised him. He enjoyed watching their expression shift to mortifying embarrassment when they realised that he was not, in fact, a family member they usually only saw at Beltane but couldn’t quite place. It didn’t bother him, not like the hordes of wellwishers did soon after the final battle, but it did make going about his day fairly inconvenient. After last night he could really have done without ‘inconvenient’.
The smell of burning coffee roused him from his thoughts. Now he’d fucking burned his coffee! “Well fuck you very much Malfoy.” he snarled out loud, wandlessly vanishing the whole fucking coffee machine. This was what he gets for fucking thinking, Harry thought bitterly. He spends a few days collecting his thoughts and misses his fucking chance. He’d always been fine trusting his gut. He defeated Voldemort hadn’t he? He should never have listened to Hermione.
“We literally slept together last week!” Harry exclaimed.
"Your family too." Ron shot back. "Anyway, I heard you two were seen together in Diagon yesterday, and so far today I haven't seen you sit down once." Ron's eyes were twinkling with mirth. "Was the git really that good?"
“Did you sponsor this event?” Harry repeated. He pointed at the dragon and Draco followed the line of his finger. “That monstrosity seems like your style.”
“Cat got your tongue?” Draco teased.
“Thanks for the tea, Andromeda.” he said as she walked into the room levitating a tray of biscuits, still wearing her apron.
"I won't." She countered, smiling. "Not a month ago we were in that cafe and I have to admit that at the time I was worried about you. You quit your job so suddenly, you were moping over Stefano."
” he’d said, and Harry had just laughed.
For the first time in a long time Harry woke up smiling. He felt younger than he had in years, the time off work having done wonders for both his mind and body. He felt energetic and excited, although he was self-aware enough to know that his giddy optimism was in part due to his growing feelings for Malfoy. The start of a relationship was always exciting, he knew he wasn’t the first person to be swept up.
“Harry.” she began. He mentally prepared himself.
“Ah yes. I always forget about that.”
“Oh I am so sorry your majesty.” Harry replied sarcastically. “Let me just pour you a glass of wine from the bottle that’s right in front of you shall I?”
A little shorter today, but hopefully you can forgive me after yesterday's chapter ended up being more than 3k!
“Indeed. I can see why you had Teddy send me a note then, if you’ve been constantly surrounded by children. You’ve probably realised that they already have neater handwriting than you.”
"Harry do me! Do me!" cried Hugo and he came careering over to him, still dusted with ash from the floo.
“You what?” Harry squeaked, taking a sip of tea and coughing to hide his embarrassment at the noise he’d just made.
Malfoy laughed. “Fuck indeed Potter. That was good.”
He’d almost finished with the gifts, he could take a break.
was no longer the first thing on his mind.
“Did I not tell you that your little tantrum was an overreaction? Remind me what Malfoy said last night?” Ron tried to imitate Malfoy’s drawl. “Who, Rory? We simply arrived at the same moment. He’s not my type.”
Harry awoke feeling like someone had hit him with a bombarda from point black. Everything ached, especially his brain. He blindly groped for his wand, and eventually found it on the floor next to, for some reason, one shoe and a luminous pink beret that hurt his eyes to look at. As he struggled to piece together the preceding evening, he suddenly remembered something terrible.
someone.” she teased.
I'm so sorry for the delay! I'm off work now though, and feeling loads better. This story is probably going to run past the 25th though!
was first with the sensationalist headlines. He wondered if there was anyone queer even working at that paper, they seemed to have no idea how most gay men lived in their twenties and thirties.
Harry resolved to talk to Draco today about their relationship. For all it felt like a fairytale, without a sincere conversation about where Draco’s head was at, Harry wouldn’t allow himself to get too carried away. He’d planned to bring it up yesterday after all, but his cock had rather got in the way. He pictured Hermione’s eye roll and accompanying sigh of
Ron kissed her again. “My talented wife. You look stunning by the way darling.” He cupped one of her pendent earrings gently. “Are these the ones I got you for your birthday?”
Malfoy pointed to a woman Harry vaguely recognised from events like these. “She’s the owner of the Falmouth Falcons. I’ve just joined them. She requested the team attend.”
doesn't run on Christmas Day."
Yeh?” Malfoy asked. Then thrust forward again, hitting the same spot. “There?” he teased as Harry groaned in pleasure.
“Night.”
Ron sighed, the comment seemed to rouse him. “It’s from George’s Christmas collection. I’m headed to the shop now. Ridiculous I know.” He stopped. “So-” he started in a lower, more playful tone. “You and Malfoy.”
He felt Malfoy’s hips stutter then he tasted the first shot of bitter spunk hit his tongue. Harry allowed himself to be overwhelmed by the sensation, the slight pain in his jaw, the taste on his tongue, the sound of Malfoy panting above him. He felt a familiar white hot pleasure building and he tightened his fist. Malfoy started to pull out but Harry squeezed his arse hard, holding him in place. Malfoy stilled and Harry used his tongue to lick up the last few drops of cum as he felt his own orgasm wash over him, pleasure rushing through his body. He felt himself covering his hand in cum as he groaned deeply.
“Honestly Hermione, I’ve been thinking about stuff loads since our last coffee, but I don’t think I’m ready for this kind of situation!” He looked up at Hermione from his seat at her kitchen table as she finished preparing their drinks.
He turned, and sure enough, next to him at the bar was Draco Malfoy. Of course Harry had bumped into him a handful of times as an adult, it was hard not to bump into people he knew in the miniscule wizarding world, but the last Harry had heard was that Malfoy had moved to France.
"I didn't take you for a prude. Did Malfoy not spend half of yesterday fu-"
Apologies again for the delay. I've been kinda ill, but I promise I will catch up just as soon as I'm feeling more alive :)
“When you offered me coffee Potter, I rather expected you to have the means to deliver.” Draco asked as they wandered into the kitchen later that morning. To the untrained ear his question sounded pointed, rude even, but Harry could tell he was joking. He was getting better at differentiating Draco’s tones.
Harry took a deep breath and looked at Draco. “Yes?”
“Sure thing mate.” Harry had no problem spending the afternoon with his goddaughter. At six years old she was already a force to be reckoned with. Perhaps now he wasn’t working, he could spend even more time with Ron and Hermione’s kids, maybe even offer to look after them a day a week. The idea warmed him right through. Another thing to think about it, he mused.
A flash of gold below them caught his eye, but while he might have seen the snitch first, he quickly realised that he’d have very little chance of catching it. Draco executed a phenomenal twisting move which had him plummeting downwards before Harry could even think about diving. That didn’t stop him from giving up though. He pressed his nose to the handle and willed his broom to catch up. Draco had the head start, but Harry’s broom was faster. As they got closer and closer to the ground, Harry’s broom was getting closer and closer to Draco. Harry gritted his teeth. Come on. Almost there. He reached a hand out in front of him, but as he did so, the snitch zipped sideways leaving Harry, who had committed to a pure speed play, with no chance in hell of matching. Draco on the other hand pulled out of his dive faster than Harry thought was possible on a twenty year old Nimbus, and managed to grab it before it vanished.
He ambled downstairs slowly, blinking sleep from his eyes. He honestly didn’t want to even guess at the state of his hair. He’d had a strong suspecicion that his hair was vaguely sentient for a while now. It had a habit of being extra disastrous when he was especially sleepy or frustrated, as if wanting to help physically represent his emotional state. He made some toast, and, noting the weak sunshine streaming through his kitchen windows, he decided to take his plate outside.
McGonagall leveled him with a stern expression. “While my letter was vague, I expect you understand my reasons for inviting you to Scotland.”
when sucking Malfoy’s cock last night. Merlin that was good sex.
He untied both letters and watched as both owls neatly unfurled their wings ready to leave. He wandlessly spelled the door open for them before pulling out a chair.
Harry felt himself freeze, his jumping to the memory of just how enthusiastically he’d
He wasn’t sure.
to shut up any time I go out, and this will only make it worse.” Draco remained silent. “Merlin, not that I wouldn’t be seen with you, just, I thought I’d, Merlin, I wanted to check-”
He’d joined the force with so much enthusiasm after Hogwarts, but he soon realised that the old guard just got older as it overlooked anyone under the age of fifty for promotion. Too famous to leave his house without having a camera stuck in his face but too young to make decisions, apparently. What a life.
Malfoy sighed. “I know we don’t have the most straightforward past.”
Malfoy took out his wand and Harry was about to object when Malfoy vanished his clothes.
He felt Draco duck under the covers, moving down his body, then suddenly his cock was enveloped in Draco’s warm wet mouth. Draco ran his hands up and down Harry’s thighs, over the inside his knees, but Harry was grateful he steered clear of his sensitive arsehole.
“I know Harry, I wasn’t going to say that. You shouldn’t interrupt!”
Malfoy had walked them down to the end of the garden, ostensibly to show him some constellation or other, but when they’d arrived he’d left a hand on Harry’s hip and very obviously stepped into Harry's personal space. Harry’s heart was racing as he looked up at the taller man.
“Okay I’ll drop it. But I’m really glad you’re thinking about it carefully.”
“That’s okay Harry.” Teddy added. “Can I still come by next week though? For our day out?”
“Patience Potter. This time we have all evening.” He kissed Harry’s cheek. “Want to show me your bedroom?”
He was watching Dean's lips move, trying to work out if he’d somehow found a way to throw his voice, or whether Harry was so drunk that somehow light waves and sound waves had become confused in his mind. He was about to ask Hermione whether it was possible when he realised firstly, that she wasn’t there, and secondly, that something small and papery had hit him in the face.
He looked up at the clear blue sky, a rarity for this time of year, and willed himself to remember what the warmth of the sun felt like. The sun was too low to have any power this late in the year, but he closed his eyes and pictured the summer. Instead of bare trees and dewy grass, the garden would be full of colour and life. Perhaps he could invite Draco over and they could have a private picnic, Harry’s mind going to thoughts of Draco leisurely feeding him strawberries. Perhaps as he made Harry watch as he lazily pulled himself off.
“I’m not going back Mione.” he interrupted, snatching his hand away. “I hate it. Sure things are changing, but too slowly. Look at us.” We’re nearly fifteen years out of the war and half the stuff’s the same. The judicial process is still fucked up! Like elected politicians involved in criminal proceedings, even if they don’t have the dementors at Azkaban anymore. This isn’t how it was supposed to be. This isn’t what we all fought for. And I don’t want to be a part of it anymore!”
“Sorry Harry, just the feather. The rest is difficult to make out given it’s mostly been crushed.”
“Do it.”
“I agree.” She gestured to her empty cup. “Well, I’m going to get a little more mulled wine. Would you like a top up?”
Yes, despised was the right word. The swirling sense of frustration and injustice that he carried with him Monday to Friday, and often weekends too, had crystallised over the course of the day into a righteous anger. Anger at his complete lack of work life balance, and the material consequences of that lack of balance in the ashes of another failed relationship. Anger at his superiors and their inability to recognise potential, let alone quality ideas to move the force forward in their post-war era. And anger at himself, for allowing himself to get so caught up in going through the motions of his life without taking control of a situation that was clearly making him unhappy.
He cut her off. “Yeh? Well you're wrong Luna. I liked him. And you don't get to get away with your pseudoscience. Tell me what your nargles think another time, I can't deal with this today.” He shot a shrinking charm and the sample box with a little too much power and it completely disappeared. He stared up at the ceiling, blinking. Fuck this day.
Perhaps if Stefano hadn’t messaged he would have thought about it. He sighed again. That wasn’t fair.
Harry wanted to deny it but he’d seemingly lost the ability to think in words. Plus, Malfoy was right, he’d worn those jeans with exactly this end result in mind.
"Hermione stop it!" Harry pushed her playfully. She really was such a mum now.
he’d said, fucking next time! Had he gone off the idea now he had this floozy no doubt throwing himself at his feet? Merlin their world was so small, someone new on the scene and all the gays suddenly start preening.
“Two small kids mate, you gotta be prepared. Mum was dropping them back early so I took three sobering potions last night, and paracetamol.” Harry nodded.
“You wish.” Harry retorted, although he kept quiet about his sore muscles. He didn’t want Draco to go easy on him. A part of Harry wondered whether he’d still got it. “Just waiting to choose my broom.” he added.
“No you don’t need to go Harry.” Hermione pulled on his arm.
“Nngh right there.”
“Right. Of course.” Harry stuttered. “I just mean, it’s been a while, right? Don’t most people know you for quidditch now? Your face is all over the European league. Ron’s been telling anyone who’ll listen to place bets on the Falcons since they signed you.”
Harry scoffed. "That's one way of putting it."
“I’ve already ordered you a macchiato.” He said, in a meagre attempt to distract from the topic she’d no doubt come to discuss.
Harry turned towards him, wrapping his legs around Draco’s so that they were face to face under the duvet and pressed a kiss to his chapped lips.
“I thought I’d give it a try, you looked like you were on another planet. Were you thinking about
Harry smiled. “Have I told you how much I appreciate you Mione?” he asked. “You’ve saved my life more times than I can count and you still have time to help me with boys, and when I quit my job in a temper without a plan for what to do next.”
him!”
“Funny.” Harry replied sarcastically. “No, Teddy wanted to write it. We were spending the day together and my, let’s say, lack of letter writing was making us late. Actually, that reminds me. Andromeda suggested you and I might want to take him flying? I’m buying him a broom for Christmas, and she said you might have a few that he can try to get a feel for the style he likes?”
Twenty minutes later the snitch was nowhere to be found, but Harry found he didn’t care. Flying with Teddy and Draco was just too much fun. They took a short break after Teddy asked if he could try a different broom.
He threw the floo powder into the fire, announced his destination, then stepped in. As he was spinning away he couldn’t help but wonder whether he’d imagined the slightly disappointed expression on Malfoy’s face.
Sorry again for the delay. My goal is to finish before the end of the month!
“I didn’t want to give anything away today in case it doesn’t work out, but Draco’s trying to get his hands on one of the new Nimbus brooms. If he pulls it off, you might have to prepare yourself for Teddy’s excited debrief tomorrow night.” Harry warned.
Harry gaped at her, but when no further explanation was forthcoming he sighed, resigned. Even though he was burning with embarrassment, he could still appreciate her looking out for him. She couldn’t have known they’d hooked up beforehand, but in fairness, her suggestion they do something with Teddy had helped him to frame Draco in his mind as perhaps more than a one night stand.
“I’ve been busy?” Harry tried.
“Ngh.” Harry didn’t trust himself with full sentences as Malfoy continued to rub back and forth against the front of his jeans. It felt simultaneously incredible but also nowhere near enough.
“Thank you for today.” Harry said as he toed off his shoes, leaving them in a pile under a small rainbow coloured Christmas tree that Seamus had given him as a joke some years before. “I think you made Teddy’s Christmas, or perhaps even his life.”
“Fucking hell.”
Harry wanted to disagree with him but the boy wasn’t wrong, he hadn’t got anywhere so far. It was unconventional, sure, but maybe Malfoy would appreciate it. He nodded, digging out an envelope. “Okay Lupin, you’ve got your way. Now go get your things together so you're ready to head out!”
Harry chuckled. “You’ve found me out. How do you think I normally get through parties?”
Harry sighed heavily. “Thank you anyway, this was really useful.” He didn’t particularly think his facial expression matched his words but he was tired, hungry and pissed off, and he found that he didn’t really care. Luna and he had been through enough together, she’d get over it.
after the war. He wondered distractedly if Ginny and Malfoy would come across each other now they both played in the UK league.
Malfoy tilted his hips downwards slightly and Harry took him into his mouth. Malfoy made a guttural noise above him and Harry groaned as he shifted his jaw, swallowing as Malfoy’s dick touched the back of his throat.
Ron looked at him quizzically. It was the kind of look that came with knowing someone for a very long time. "You're really not happy with your job at the moment are you?"
.” he replied, and she rolled her eyes.
“You’re the first I’ve asked. I couldn’t risk you getting snapped up by another organisation without at least asking. This school owes a lot to you Harry, and while teaching would certainly require a time commitment, it is immensely rewarding. I suspect that you’ll get out more than you put in. Especially someone like you.”
"I'm not!" Ron insisted. "I was congratulating him on his love life." He added innocently.
“Andromeda suggested you and I take Teddy out, together?” Malfoy questioned.
"Ron." Hermione chastised. She turned back to Harry. "But look at you now." It was almost like she was sizing him up. He knew better than to interrupt her. "You've got a man in your life, you've got a job offer.” She took a sip of her wine. “Have you written to McGonagall yet?”
“Yeh, well. It is what it is.” He wasn’t particularly in the mood to go into any details. It was probably early enough to head home now.
“You weren’t really thinking straight at that moment?” Hermione repeated, eyebrows raised. “Might that have something to do with the fact that you ‘weren’t really thinking’ about quitting that day either?”
“I know.” Draco smiled.
“And me!” Ron chipped in. “I think I must have staged about three interventions this month alone!”
He slid into an empty seat laughing and quickly grabbed the beer that Ron had sent floating towards him. He snapped his fingers to pop the cap and took a sip.
Harry moaned in agreement, grinding back against Draco.
“Say my real name.” Malfoy instructed between swirling his tongue around the head and taking Harry all the way into his throat.
All Harry could do was nod.
Malfoy was looking at him curiously. “You can feel the difference between different types of wards?”
"Oh get you, show off." teased Seamus. "Want to teach the class?" he asked, clicking his fingers at a whole case of beer to no effect.
Malfoy leaned towards him conspiratorially, his mouth only inches from Harry’s ear. “I’ll give you a better option, if you’re interested.” he whispered. To any passing onlooker it would have looked as if Malfoy was simply leaning in to be heard over the music.
“Good morning.” Draco said, voice cracking from disuse. “Sickle for your thoughts?”
“Ah, well in that case.” He raised his glass. “To
“Umm. What would you do?” he tried.
“Hi.” Harry said, a little breathlessly. “You made it.”
Harry pushed back his chair and stood. “I’ll grab my coat.” He tucked the chair back in and paused. “And thanks Ron, again. I don’t know how I’d get through life without you.”
“Yeh it’s Christmas babe, give the man a break. Plus he’s with Draco now, the amount that man must pull in for sponsorship deals alone. Harry, you could be a house husband!”
