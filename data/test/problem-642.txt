Taking another breath, Harry turned and made his way over to Draco as the table righted itself in the background, mended pieces of crockery flying back into their proper formation.
The original note had been slipped under the surgery door, addressed to Draco; Isobel had collected it along with the rest of his post and had left it on his desk.
It was distracting, a case to focus on, a criminal to hunt down, but Malfoy getting under his feet too, all long blonde hair and pale skin that must bruise easy under lips and fingers, flashing grey eyes full of challenge as he’d faced Harry in the pub, as they’d walked together in the wind, as they’d stood by his front door.
“He’s not a target,” Harry insisted, taking a rather violent bite of his toast. “And I’m not mighty.”
“You truly cannot expect me to stay here,” she’d said pointedly, the night they had apparated here, lip curling as she sneered at the cobwebs her wand-light illuminated.
“No,” Gawain insisted, from the other side of his oak desk. “Takes too long to set any of that up. I need you both there now, so off you hop. We’re already running out of daylight. No arguing. Floo. Go.”
about Draco ruddy Malfoy and get out there and do your jobs, before I floo in and kick you both door to door on your arses!”
It almost made him blush to remember it, the ferocity, the fear, on the other man’s face. As if Draco’s fate mattered somehow, meant something to him.
Harry decided to be on his way when the toddler sneezed, and the resulting little flames nearly singed the photo entirely.
Harry, who was open-mouthed with shock, couldn’t tear his eyes away. Malfoy’s hair was longer, long enough to tie back, and he’d grown taller, it seemed, or else he somehow managed to fill out his robes now far better than he had their Hogwarts gear. Other than that he still looked so familiar – still fair-skinned and regal, with apprehension in his light eyes. Forcing himself to look away from his former nemesis, Harry lowered his own wand and grabbed at Innes’s arm, hissing for him to stop.
“Thanks,” Harry bade the family farewell, but the mother didn’t have time to respond with any more than a quick wave. Her boys had found some sticks and were whacking each other with them. The little girl was wailing about poor attendance to her tea-party. And, as Harry reached the road, he heard the baby sneeze once more.
“I heard Granger is shaking things up at the Ministry?” Draco let Potter prattle on about how proud he was of Granger and her work at the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, and how great he found it sharing an office with Weasley, even though they weren’t partners.
Now, Draco was working on a potion Yaxley had demanded, to keep him hidden. Whether he knew about the Aurors’ presence or not, Draco wasn’t sure, but Yaxley was growing sick of hiding in caves and along the coastline, and wanted the comforts of a proper roof over his head, warm food, a bed.
Several hippocampi nested on the craggy, rocky islands just off the mainland, but they’d never bothered the humans on Iona too badly.
Innes gave him the finger as they walked down opposite sides of the lane to the first houses on the inland side of the village, which looked roughly identical to each other, with white pebble-dash walls and thatched roofs.
“I hope so,” she twisted her fingers together nervously, so he gestured with his chin back to his house.
“You realize you’ll have to Floo back and forth from the Ministry every day? The village is warded against apparition. Unless you want to walk back and forth from the barriers.”
“I was raised scared and surrounded, hid it with an arrogance I never felt, a self-confidence I had to fake. Death Eaters and the... the pure blood ideology... the motives, the fucked-up beliefs they hold tight to their chests with both hands because they
“Thank Merlin for alcohol, then.” Draco gratefully accepted his drink from Eileen, who’d appeared at his elbow, then paused to glance at Potter. “Another?”
The little village of Adharmuir was hidden behind a mirage of empty air and unfertile, rocky earth. Like at Hogwarts, any muggles who ventured past the first set of marker stones would be overcome by the curiously insistent need to immediately leave. So far it had worked, and no muggle had ever made it past the second set of stones which the village lay behind, which had an even stronger charm in place to repel outsiders.
The nettle paste he’d been working on was finally dehydrated enough to continue on with the potion he was concocting, so he added it to the cauldron along with powdered chameleon spine and essence of Belladonna, and charmed the flame to burn low for several hours, tucked away in the corner of his lab.
“It was,” Draco was stubborn, as stubborn as Innes. As stubborn as Harry. “It was. I can’t just... I can’t just let you go, not now, not after all this time, after everything. I can’t just let you run head-long into trouble!”
Draco liked it here, though, for all it’s claustrophobic, isolated charm. It was home now, the little village with its crotchety, hardened villagers. Distance from his mother was best. Distance from his father was welcome. He could remake himself here. He
“Thank you. What can you tell me about Malfoy?” Harry asked her as she set down the tray on the desk, the question coming out completely unbidden.
Then he was gone, the fire back to its normal flickering orange flame, and Innes stamped off across the hall to his own room. Harry immediately downed his drink, allowed himself one long look down the lane in the direction of Malfoy’s cottage, then dropped into bed and gazed at the full moon outside until he fell asleep.
Heaving a deep sigh of relief, Harry waved his own wand at the mess he’d made of the table behind him. Draco remained at the door, seemingly frozen in shock, or anger, or fear. Harry couldn’t tell which.
Closing the folder, Harry glanced absently around the room. A few people, two little old ladies with floral patterned scarves wrapped around their heads sipping sherry by the fire, and a young man with potion burns on his hands, nursing a pint by the door, were eyeing Harry. Whether that was because he was a new face or because they actually recognised him, he couldn’t tell.
In the far corner, under the window, the nettles for another concoction had finally absorbed up all the rowan tree sap, so he crushed them up in his mortar and pestle and laid the resulting mash out to dry overnight. That potion should be ready to start brewing this time tomorrow, but he didn’t really want to dwell on that.
“I knew you’d betray me, you little bastard. Surely you know what happens now; as soon as I saw this dead prick waltz in here, I sent my men to do the job.”
“Come in,” he called, recognising the measure of the knock and finally feeling fortified enough to deal with his partner.
“Well, then. It’s been a long time, Potter. I’ll pop out and get a bottle or two to ring in our reunion, shall I?” Draco’s mother didn’t wait for an answer, just pulled her cape on and ducked out into the wind.
“I’ll double my efforts, just for you,” Potter laughed as he stood. “I’ll walk you home. I need fresh air to wake me up, still got some work to do tonight.”
“Let me tell you what I know. A hippocampus has been far too close to the island the past few days. Driven from his lair, I suspect.”
“You were difficult to find, even for me,” Harry shrugged at her, before he turned to meet Draco’s gaze.
Draining his glass and rubbing at his sore eyes, he decided not to stay up long. Tomorrow was Saturday, meaning his practice was only open for a few hours from late morning to early afternoon. He was already looking forward to an early night and a good lie in tomorrow, as pathetic as it sounded for a 24-year-old man on a Friday evening.
Rhona, who’s crush on him he had never taken particularly seriously – she’d grow out of it – had figured out something was wrong with him. Draco had broken one night and confided the whole thing to her.
“I’ll ask Draco the same questions I’m asking everyone, because the only reason we’re here is to find this man,” Harry cut her off loudly, shoving the photo of Yaxley under her nose. “Now, Rhona, have you seen him?”
But she was already peering through the peep-hole, and then, with a scoffed laugh, threw the door wide open.
“Draco knows nothing about Yaxley,” Harry insisted, as the fire in the grate turned green and Robards’ head appeared. Their boss was already yelling at them.
“I wish we could help them,” she sighed. “Give them some sort of hint that we think he’s in the caves…”
“Where, Draco? Stupid, stubborn, ruddy Innes, always thinks he can one-up me and get the job done when my back is turned…”
“Well, we lay the past to bed now,” Potter pushed away from the wall, and took a step down the path, before he glanced back. “Right?”
“Faster,” he groaned out, sliding his hands down Potter’s sweat-damp bare back, squeezing at his waist, his hips, his ass. “Come on. Faster. Harder.”
“He’ll be at the practice until the early afternoon, but it’s the largest house at the other end of the village, two-storey, quite close to the water.”
“Don’t go,” Draco begged, clutching at Harry’s shoulders, fingers digging practically down to the bone. “Don’t. Just... stay. Stay here. Stay with me. Let Innes handle it. You’ve done enough, for fuck’s sake; how have you not done enough?! You defeated Voldemort, you saved the world. You’ve done
He did what Hermione said, when she said it, lackingany presence of mind to think for himself. Grief numbed him; grief over Innes, over Draco, for himself.
Harry had been peering at the files for a while, but Innes, Alasdair, and a young woman who’d come over from the general store were all debating the likely outcome of the Falcons vs. Harpies match tomorrow.
“Not unscathed. Trauma just looks a little different on me than on you. I fought him several times, never wanting it, never knowing what to do, never expecting to survive. I lost friends and family to him. But you had him breathing down your neck your whole life, your head filled up with his ideals and the promise he would return. There was nothing your family could do to break away, even when he was believed to be gone.”
Clearing his throat and trying to ignore the way his fingertips still felt the pull of wanting to almost-touch Draco again, Harry opened his mouth to explain his presence when sounds of crashing and shouting reached their ears from inside the house.
Turning back to the files, Harry perused his notes, his headache not abating as he slowly sipped at his scotch and ignored Innes’s loudly grumbled insults at his taking his time. The room around them filled up steadily with villagers as night began to descend, people coming in for drinks, a meal, or simply to gossip.
“Alright look,” Harry pitched his voice loud enough to carry. “My partner and I are Aurors here on official Ministry business. We’re searching for a man named Corban Yaxley, who’s been sighted in the area; a former Death Eater. He is considered highly dangerous and there is a warrant out for his immediate arrest, so if you do see him, please do not approach him. We’ll be talking to each of you over the next few days, to find out if you’ve spotted anyone new or suspicious about the place. Now, about Mr. Malfoy,” he started to add.
“I don’t think fairy tales are all that accurate a representation of the way things blur,” Potter murmured, his smile wry. “Voldemort’s supporters, from what I witnessed first-hand, were scared. Few were truly evil. Just frightened and in too deep, just trying to protect their loved ones. Same as you. Merlin, same as
“It’s alright, Rhona,” Draco murmured to her, as he backed away to the door even as Harry approached, and then turned and disappeared through it before Harry could even say his name.
Draco sighed, rubbed at his sore eyes. How was this his life? How was he standing in the village lane talking to
Then he was falling forward out of a different fireplace a few moments later, stumbling onto grey slate flagstones, coughing and covered in ash, his wand raised defensively across his chest.
Corban Yaxley had been sighted at last… after all these years with the Aurors only ever just on his tail but never quite close enough. Harry would walk until his feet bled if it meant finally bringing the rogue Death Eater in.
“What’s done is done,” Harry pressed his teeth into Draco’s throat, hands slipping into his robes and parting them. It wasn’t forgiveness, but acceptance and agreement to move on. That was enough.
Harry’s dislike at the possibility of Ron being put in danger must have shown on his face, because Gawain eyed him back, looking equally livid.
“She’s alive, and has her freedom. All things considered, what more could we have hoped for? My parents picked the losing side, chose evil over good. Didn’t those shitty Muggle relatives of yours even bother to read you fairy tales? Evil never triumphs, in the end. They were always going to lose. And once they were indentured, they couldn’t get out, and so I was born into a dark dynasty on the side of the evil and hateful Death Eaters, and never had a choice.”
“Do you bloody mind!” Potter continued to gape as Draco snarled at him, so he just shoved past the gawping idiot and hurried off down the street and towards the water.
“Draco Malfoy was cleared, Innes,” Harry repeated, when his partner wouldn’t lower his arm. “You waving your wand and shouting accusations about a civilian to all and sundry is wrong and you know it.”
The kiss alone was a risk. To attempt for more would be asking for trouble, pure and simple. Besides, Draco made his feelings clear. Harry’s own feelings were another matter.
“If I wait,” Innes said over his shoulder as he reached his door, “and Yaxley disappears... I know where he’s likely to be. It’s my turn to surprise him.”
He readd the letter that night in his tiny living room, after building himself up to it all day, with a glass of whiskey in one hand and a fire roaring in the grate.
The messages, always written in green ink, were the only way Yaxley had contacted him since the first one, a month prior.
Potter was in a chair by the fireplace, sipping at something and ignoring the scowls of his partner, who was seated at the bar. Other than the two Aurors, there were only a few others about; it was still a little early for anyone intending more than just a quick drink before heading home to eat.
“Young chaps like the two of you have a lot more to live for,” Dawlish shrugged. “And a fuck-ton more to learn.”
Or rather, he’d become himself, without having to maintain a reputation around the peers who knew him when he was a selfish, foolish schoolboy, and having the chance to break away from the sycophantic, arrogant children of the other Death Eaters he’d been raised alongside.
to the Isle of Iona for this case if it meant he didn’t have to use the network. And he was perfectly serious about it, too.
it’s wrong... all of that comes from a place of protection, and identity. In themselves those aren’t bad morals. The sacred 28 families, the bloodlines... if some people want to preserve those by excessive and weirdo in-breeding, fine. But the concept that that blood makes them special,
By midday they were tired and cold, and worst of all there was no sign of Yaxley, or any other lone magical presence on the island.
“Stop talking!” One of his eyelid’s was peeled back by cold fingers so a wand light could be shone directly into his pupil; Harry flinched away.
“Four, if you include yourself. I assure you, Mr. Potter, many more had their hands on their wands. But it’s not for village-folk to get between you mighty Aurors and their targets.”
“Not particularly. We both know who we’re looking for. We know his history – he was present at the battle of Hogwarts, slipped away, and has been running the six years since. A few sightings – Inverness, Ullapool, Castlebay – it doesn’t seem that he's ever left the Scottish Highlands in all that time, let alone the UK. This lead’s the most certain we’ve had – but who was it that clapped eyes on him long enough to ID him? It’s such a small village, I can’t fathom why he would take the risk to linger near a tiny wizarding community. So, what’s drawn him here? Who called the sighting in?”
He dithered at the door, examining the fuchsias in their window box under the sill, taking in the view up and down the lane, the angry sea to one side, rocky landscape to the other.
“Slimy bastard’s seen Yaxley, or I’m a Quaffle. He’s helping him too, or I’m a fucking beater’s bat! He’s a fucking Death Eater, lad!” Innes was furious. He was one of many who’d never accepted the pardoning of the Malfoy’s by the Ministry. But Harry wasn’t about to stand back and let him attack a civilian unprovoked.
It had been one heck of a shock, walking into his local pub after a harried day of curing sniffles and patching up grazes, only to come face to face with two wands pointed at his chest and Potter’s frantic green eyes.
Then his fingers twitched as they curled tight around Draco’s, and the hottest noise Draco had ever heard was the sweet, whimpered cry that tore from the man draped over him.
Ron was already there, and Harry sat with him in his office, unable to step into the one he shared with Innes.
But Draco was right on his heels as he staggered down the stairs and out into the street. As Harry started to jog towards the inland side of the village, Draco grabbed for his hand again.
“Look. Potter. I... Look, this doesn’t make us friends. We had shitty childhoods, a lot of crap thrown at us at Hogwarts, even more crap with Voldemort and now... we’re both in the same boat, trying to move on from something that won’t ever let go. But we’re not friends. I don’t have friends, and if I did, I wouldn’t want
A knock at the door chilled him, and his mother downed her wine before she drew her wand and preceded him to entry-way.
“Do you really want to know?” Draco muttered, looking away from his mouth and taking another sip of his own drink.
“What do you mean, Hermione knows? I thought you weren’t going to tell her!” Draco slammed the book he was reading down and stared at Harry.
"And what do you know about being alone? You have everyone around you to support you. At any point in time, you can go to anyone. I've have no one, I've never had anyone. And before you even mention my "friends" in Slytherin, remember that they are all on the side of You-Know-Who. They would think me a fool if I told them I wanted out, that I didn't want any of this, that I didn't want to…" He stopped and took a breath, composing himself.
Harry stilled before staring down at the pen in his hands. He started anxiously tapping the pen against the table before he started speaking once more. "I was raised by my aunt and uncle. They… didn't like me very much. From a young age, I was taught to be seen and not heard, to make myself as small as possible and not call attention to myself. I lived in the cupboard under the stairs." There was a quick intake of breath that Harry tried desperately to ignore. "I grew up thinking my parents died in a car accident and that they were these weird, terrible people. They were...abusive. Verbally, sometimes physically. My cousin was encouraged to participate in what he called 'Harry Hunting.' He would chase me with his friends and it would end badly if they caught me. Sometimes, strange things would happen to me. The boys would trip over nothing or I would be one place and then, boom, I'd be on a roof somewhere. I would get hit once or twice for being late, breaking something or talking out of turn, but it was always worse once Dudley told his parents about the incidents. My uncle would try to beat the evil out of me. The calmer I kept myself, the less likely I was to have outbursts of what I know now to be magic. It was...difficult. I was so full of rage sometimes that I was so sure I would explode." He didn't look up from the pen he was gripping so tight. The silence was almost deafening.
“Say one of the Slytherins reaches out to you. They want to get to know you. They want to LEARN the difference from their parent’s beliefs. They want to see how wonderful YOU are. But all YOU see, is a Slytherin. You second guess why on earth such an EVIL person from such a DARK house would dare speak to you. You don’t consider that maybe they want to change. It doesn’t even cross your mind, does it? What if, by just accepting the hand they’re extending to you, you can save them from the path that their parents and their breeding set them on? What if, you found out years down the line, that you rejected that outreach and caused them to continue on that path? Could you live with yourself?” He took a deep breath and watched the shame cross their faces. It was a long moment before either of them could bring themselves to speak.
"No worries, I don't think the world will end if we were to spend more than one day together. What class are you working on today?" Harry looked at his schoolbag lost in thought for a minute for how to broach the subject.
“Yeah, that’s what happens when you save someone’s life, I suppose. I wanted to ask… why were you outside Dumbledore’s office today?”
Draco slowly turned in the are-you-serious manner and stared at Harry. "Are you really going to ask me that when you know my father? All he cares about is maintaining the family name, keeping in good favor with the Dark Lord, and guaranteeing with stay in favor with the Ministry. If I die, it will be a tragic accident and a smaller smirch on our name than if I wouldn't do kill him. If I manage to do it, our family will rise quite quickly in favor. But that's not to say he won't soon ruin us once again. My father's ambitions for both the Ministry and the Dark Lord don't tend to mesh well."
They stayed there, just enjoying the solitude, for another couple hours before deciding to leave. They stood at the door, both wondering how to approach this goodbye. The events and closeness they had just experienced deemed a handshake too informal, yet a hug seemed too intimate. Malfoy finally stuck out his hand. Harry gave him one of his own and they smiled at each other.
“If it’s all the same, sir. I’m excused from the rest of Potions per Professor Slughorn and I would like to stay, at least for a little while. I want to make sure he’s okay.”
"You know I couldn't do that. Who would I get into daily fights with then?" His joke fell flat and he softened. "Draco, you have a choice you know. You don't have to keep doing this."
“Mine are of my father. Sometimes Voldemort. I don’t always have the luxury of waking up. I’m stuck sometimes. Have you tried Dreamless Sleep? I take it sometimes when they persist.”
“Much appreciated. It would be nice to sleep without nightmares every now and then. Why am I not surprised that Snape gives you extra lessons?” Harry’s lip quirked and he left his hand under Draco’s. The warmth was a comfort after his nightmares.
“No, Hermione. Just a little study session before bed. Got almost all my homework done for the week. Just need to finish the Transfiguration paper and I’ll be set.”
“Sometimes. I fall asleep here studying sometimes. It’s why our room has a bed in it.” He tensed at the slip up, but Harry felt his insides warm at the sentiment.
Harry rushed off to the Great Hall, catching the last 10 minutes of breakfast before the food disappeared. Waving off his friends concerns, he quickly ate before walking with Ron and Hermione to their first class. Once away from the table, his friends didn’t hesitate to jump to the chase.
Dumbledore sighed and waved Harry along. It was a quiet, tense walk to the Hospital Wing and Harry couldn’t take his eyes off the blond. He was looking pale and his breathing was quite labored. When they reached the Hospital Wing, Dumbledore shooed Harry to the corner and called for Madam Pomfrey. He set Draco down on one of the beds and the two closed the curtains. All Harry could hear was quiet murmurs behind the current and his anxiety spiked. He put his head between his knees and tried to breathe. He couldn’t stop thinking that he should have been with Draco and this wouldn’t have happened. Dumbledore came from behind the current and sat down next to Harry.
“I mean, being gay is a thing, Harry, and more common than you think. Did you really never consider it?”
The quiet surrounding Harry’s statement was deafening. They both knew the expectation weighing on the both of them and their ages were sometimes forgotten. Both were being asked a great deal for still being children and their mental health was sorely neglected by the adults around them. One of the largest casualties of war were the children that would be left behind to grow up when it was over. Even more so with the children who would have to fight in that war. After a moment’s thought, Draco snuck his hand over Harry’s.
"Neither. I have to go to the cabinet first." Malfoy directed them towards it and they slowly made their way over to it. He removed his arm from around Harry and searched the cabinet quickly. He brought out a large, pleasant smelling jar. "I fear I'll need help applying this." He flushed with embarrassment.
“No, that’s not why I’m speaking to Malfoy. I am serious that he’s helping me with Occlumency. Malfoy and I have an understanding, that’s all. And he’s offering an olive branch. Come study with us tomorrow. You can see that he’s not manipulating me, we’re honestly just studying.”
"On to your project. You're going to want to start small. I'm assuming you weren't raised to keep a sharp control on your thoughts or put up mental blocks?"
“I promise Hermione. I just needed air last night. And he’s not casting spells on me. Just helping with research. If something was going on, I would tell you. Can we please go to lunch now? And can you not tell Ron about this? I don’t want a repeat freak out. I just need all the help I can get.” He guided her to the door of the classroom. She reluctantly agreed and followed him out. He took a deep breath and sighed. Just a few more classes and then he had a lot to talk to Draco about.
“Will you stop jumping to conclusions? I just...wanted to know if you were seeing someone. That’s all.”
Harry chatted idly with his friends on the way to their next class. His mind was mainly focused on the idea of learning wandless magic. He had known it was possible. How else had all of those strange things happened before he was 11? He drummed his fingers incessantly in Charms thinking on it before Hermione stilled his hand with another whispered threat. He grinned sheepishly at her and tried to focus on the lesson.
“I don’t know? I don’t think so. I highlighted the fact that I’ve been fighting for my life the entirety of the time that I’m supposed to be discovering girls. I’ve had one kiss in my life. I’ve never really looked at girls before.”
It took Malfoy a little longer than normal to get back to his common area. Even after the healing spell and the salve, he was still ginger from the spell's effects. He waved away his friend's concerns and straightened his spine. He made himself walk as normal as possible up to his room before succumbing to the pain. He changed into his pajamas and lay in bed. He tried to fall asleep but it eluded him. Thoughts of the raven haired boy filled his head. His attempts to befriend him had finally succeeded and with that friendship came liberation from all the hardship he knew he would have to face if he continued on the path he was forced to walk. Even though he had often insisted so, he never hated Potter. The hurt and confusion over the rejection in their first year had caused him to make stupid decisions in an effort to pretend that it hadn't affected him at all.
“Yeah, I think I’ll be heading there. I think I’m starting to get comfy there. I may never leave.” Draco chuckled.
“There’s a little bit of the Draco we know and love. I was beginning to get concerned when we had a yelling match that didn’t resort to violence or wands drawn. I dare say… we even came to a compromise! Are you feeling okay? Do I need to run and get Pomfrey?” Draco scowled at him.
“That’s good! I’m glad to see you getting your head on straight with your homework. You said you had to talk to Dumbledore this morning? Is everything alright?”
"Alright, if you're sure." Both Ron and Hermione gave him a weird look before continuing their discussion on who was going to win the match.
“Well, I damn well didn’t tell her. Your little notice-me-not charm apparently didn’t work on her while she was staring holes into me during Potions. She guessed I was with you last night and had a mini-meltdown as to why I was passing notes with you in class. But she doesn’t know why we’re meeting and I told her I was by myself last night, just getting some air. I told her you’re helping me with Occlumency. I got her off our backs and made her promise not to tell Ron anything.”
“Sometimes I dream of what Voldemort’s doing. Sometimes the night in the graveyard. The night my parents died. Every once in a while, I dream of the Chamber or Quirrell. The nightmares vary, but the theme is the same. And every time, I wake up screaming.”
"Well considering they are both on opposite sides of this war, I would think not." Harry tried to keep a straight face and was rewarded with a scowl.
“Fine by me. You have your choice of sleeping in the bed as well or you could take the couch. It’s not as comfortable to lay on as it is to sit on, I warn you.”
“If you insist. But please be quiet and stay out of Madam Pomfrey’s way. If there are any developments or issues, please make sure you send for me immediately.”
“Oh shove off, Harry. If people were going to talk about us anymore, they would have continued after Rita Skeeter’s articles. But that’s sort of what I wanted to talk to you about.”
“I was just wondering what would happen if Death Eaters decided to defect from Voldemort’s side?” Dumbledore paused, staring at Harry calculating.
At dinner, he laughed at Ron's antics with his brother's new products and Lavender's attempts at getting Ron's attention. Apparently, she thought hanging all over some other boy and glaring at Ron would steal his attention. The poor boy was terrifyingly oblivious. Despite the amusement of his housemates, he found his eye constantly drifting to a certain blonde. While his table was full of laughter, the blonde sat by himself in a solemn silence. A slight smile graced his lips when he would peek and see Harry's gaze on him.
“Okay, Mr. Ravenclaw.” Harry chucked amusedly. “What if I talked to him first? I won’t name names. I’ll just… feel out your options for you. That way, you don’t risk anything before you have thought it through entirely.”
“I haven’t told anyone about them to see about getting any. The nightmares feel like a weakness. Everyone looks to me to be strong and defeat Voldemort. I don’t want to disappoint anyone.”
Harry nodded and they both left. Harry headed down to the kitchens since they had missed dinner. He begged a plate from one of the house elves and watched them while he ate it. His thoughts were consumed with how he would break the news about the end of his and Malfoy's feud to his friends. They had been feuding since they had first arrived and the mere idea that it could be over in just one incident would be too much for his friends to handle. He handed his plate back to the elf, thanked him and made his way back to his common area. He waved his friends concerns away and went straight to bed.
"Yeah, I know what I did wrong. I don't see why I have to evaluate and pick apart every little thing I did is silly."
Harry nodded and brought him over to the couch. Malfoy gingerly removed his robes, staring down at his chest. A dozen still pink scars littered his chest, spreading up his neck, and there was a spattering across his face. Malfoy turned his face away from both his chest and Harry. Harry unscrewed the cap on the jar and scooped out some of the lotion. He used his other hand to take a little off and apply it to Malfoy's chest. He hissed but held still. He moved his ministrations to his neck. When he had finished with his chest and neck, he took a deep breath and put his hand on Malfoy's face and gently brought his face forward. He felt the other boy tense and bit his lip.
"That's because it's been drilled into your head by Snape, silly. Harry, however, seems to have been having other things on his mind in Potions. You've been distracted a lot lately. Do you want to talk about it?" Hermione handed him back his homework.
“Bed’s fine. We’ve already slept there once and neither of us died. I think it’d be safe a second time.” Harry nervously moved to the other side of the bed and waited for Draco. After a moment’s hesitation, he climbed under the covers with the blond. It wasn’t as strange as he thought it would be. The bed was big enough that they could both lay in it without touching. He did have to resist the urge to run his hand along the blond’s pajamas to see if they were as soft as they looked. He turned his back to the blond and they whispered their goodnights. Soon, he was drifting off to sleep.
He watched in anticipation as the blood flow ceased, but the wounds remained open. He muttered it once more, relief at the cessation of the blood, but fear for Malfoy's life crashing over him. The wounds started to scab and knit together. He laid his head on Malfoy's chest desperately listening for a heartbeat. It thudded faintly. He whispered the spell once more against his skin. The wounds finally healed over, his heartbeat grew louder and he started breathing heavily.
He sent the crane back before he could second guess himself. The regret didn’t have much time to sink in before Seamus’ cauldron exploded. Purple goo, which was definitely not the color or consistency the potion should have been, exploded over a few of the students. Slughorn shouted instructions as children wiped themselves off to find their skin was turning every shade of the rainbow. Seamus and Neville had gotten the brunt of the potion and their skin was changing at a nauseating speed. Harry had thankfully stepped out of the way of the spray and set about gathering his friends’ things to take to the hospital wing for them. He shrugged apologetically at Draco as he set about cleaning up. After class, he ran their things to the hospital wing, where he was informed his friends would be there for the rest of the afternoon. He set off for lunch, but found himself dragged into an abandoned classroom. He turned startled to find Hermione glaring at him.
Harry nodded and they both laid back down. Neither of them moved their hands. The feel of Draco’s hand over his was comforting as he drifted off back to sleep. Draco waited for his breathing to steady before casting a quiet Lumos and summoning his book. He watched over Harry for any further signs of nightmares and read his book. He cast a Tempus charm every once in a while to keep track of when he needed to wake Harry up to get back to his dorm. Harry’s face was surprisingly relaxed in sleep and he was curled up in a ball. When the clock struck 5, he sighed and started shaking Harry awake. He sat up and rubbed his eyes.
He racked his brain for some spell, some charm to stop the bleeding. He struggled to remember anything else written down by the curse in his Potion's book or any possible cure from his lessons. Finally, the words broke free of the panic-filled fog that has descended on his brain.
“You’re more than welcome to do your reading here, Granger. We won’t have to bother you with homework help, I’m sure. Or if you’re interested in Harry’s topic, I’m sure he’d be more than happy to walk you through it. Whatever suits your fancy.” Draco turned his attention back to the Defense book in front of him.
He woke up to the feeling of something soft on his back. He woke with a long stretch, cracking his stiff back from falling asleep on the floor. Rubbing his eyes, he woke to seeing Draco stretched out on the other side of the bed. A quick Tempus charm read the time as 5 a.m. He felt a quick panic at having been out all night, but there was nothing to be done about it now. He removed himself from the bed as quietly as he could. He sat down at the table and watched the boy on the bed. It amused him how peaceful he looked while he slept. He paused at the idea of waking him up and disturbing that peace. The blond’s hair fell haphazardly across his face quite different from the put together appearance he usually had. Harry decided to let the blond rest awhile longer before waking up for breakfast. He passed the next hour working on homework until the blond started stirring.
“She asked if I was gay because I said the girls here are mental and because I described kissing Cho as wet. She was crying!” He threw his hands up in frustration.
Dumbledore watched Harry with a considering look. Harry was certain Dumbledore didn’t believe him, but he wasn’t certain if he was sure Harry had nothing to do with Draco being in the corridor. He crossed his fingers and prayed Dumbledore would let him stay.
"What's the difference between sky blue and light blue? Isn't the sky light blue?" He honestly looked a little panicked.
"Glad you took an interest. Meditation is mostly a Muggle practice. It's sort of a relaxation technique and it helps you to order your mind. It helps you to concentrate and improves your memory. Some people take it as far as to create a sort of Mind Palace. Mine is a library." She blushed lowering her head slightly, "It's easier for me to find the information in my brain because it's sorted by time period or subject. It also eases stress and anxiety. I use it frequently before exams, among other things."
"What will talking about it do, Potter? It is what it is." His jaw tensed and he avoided looking at Harry.
Harry’s face grew warm at the sentiment and he cast his eyes down. “We’re in the same boat then, if I ever get my situation figured out. I can’t imagine dragging someone along this road with me. It wouldn’t be fair to them.” Draco stood quickly.
“Well, I got cornered into an abandoned classroom by Hermione. Not for a snog fest, I assure you.” He clarified at Draco’s raised eyebrow, “She wanted to know if I was seeing someone. Then the silly girl asked me if I was gay!”
“What happened, Harry? We were really worried when you didn’t come back to Potions and weren’t in Transfiguration. All your note said was you had to go find Draco!” Hermione twisted her hands nervously.
"I don't know. Anyways, enough about my nonsense. What was with the letter at breakfast?" At his mention, Draco closed off and became distant.
“Harry. Stop. That’s not what I’m asking. I’m asking if you even LIKE girls. I mean, honestly. When describing your kiss with Cho, the only adjective you could use was WET. That’s not exactly how most people describe their first kiss, you know. I was just wondering if that’s even the door you want to be opening.” Hermione grabbed his hand to stop the pacing. “Maybe your interests lie in a different direction?”
“Early to bed, early to rise, right? I’m really hungry though, so I’m going to head to breakfast. I’ll see you and Ron down there, okay?”
“It’ll be fine, Ron. Just pay close attention to the instructions and stop getting distracted. It’s easy if you just pay attention.”
Draco dug into the food for a minute before answering carefully. “I wanted to talk to him about his offer. I don’t want to do this anymore and as today shows, I have good reason. Someone must have found out.”
"My mission…" Harry let him take his time. "I'm supposed to kill Dumbledore. That's what the letter was about. He's putting pressure on my father because I haven't done it yet. The longer I wait, the more likely it is that he will kill my family." Draco dropped his head to his hands.
“Harry Potter! Dobby is happy to see you! And… Master Malfoy?” Dobby hid himself behind the chair Harry was occupying.
“No offense, Hermione. But if you’re about to declare your undying love for me, I hate to be the one to break it to you, but you’re not quite my type.” Hermione wrinkled her nose at the thought.
“I just needed some time. I had some things to work on. Don’t worry. I was perfectly safe, I promise.”
“The thing about love is if they love you, they’ll be more than happy to come with you. It’s about support and guidance. Being there for the person you love when they need you the most. And I dare say, you desperately need people who love you, romantic or otherwise. You have a long road ahead, Potter. Better have people with you for the ride. And on that cheerful note, I’m about to get some sleep.” He set the book down on the coffee table before stretching.
Harry grinned at the smiling blond. Draco was absolutely correct. This would be a new beginning for the both of them.
“There’s a classroom a hallway away from the library that would be a believable hiding spot. I may be able to sacrifice tomorrow night to ease her conscience a little. It may also be helpful. She loves having her nose in books, so you may get a little more research done with her breathing down your neck than if you were doing it on your own. I draw the line at the Wea- at Weasley though. She can keep her boyfriend in the Common Room.” Harry felt more settled at the sneer on Draco’s face.
“I did enjoy the quiet time, but I couldn’t do it all the time. You know Ron struggles to study without one of us there to keep him on task. And I do find it strange the way the tables have turned. Normally, it’s us trying to convince you that Malfoy isn’t up to something. It is quite strange to see you two on a first name basis. Makes a girl wonder how that came about.”
Hermione nodded and they left the classroom. It was an awkward walk to the class. He sat away from his two friends and spent his class periods doodling and thinking. Looking around at everyone around him, he tried to think of anyone he found particularly attractive. He could see when someone was handsome or beautiful physically, but there weren’t any that particularly pulled his attention. They were attractive, but he wasn’t attracted to them. He mulled over this thought for the rest of the day, even staying quiet and aloof at dinner. When Hermione was done with dinner, they said their goodbyes to Ron and headed to the library. Hermione still felt awkward and so it was a quiet walk. They stopped at the library for a moment so Harry could pick up a couple more books and headed down to the classroom. When they arrived, Harry was pleasantly surprised to see large tables around the room. Draco was already spread out at one of the tables.
Harry chuckled at the conversation quip. “I’m sure the conversation with your dinnerware was delightful. I only have about 6 inches of parchment left on my Defense essay. I have already finished my Charms and Transfiguration. I’ve mostly been working on the Occlumency. I think I have a good basis for how it’s supposed to work and I’ve already been working on meditating and creating the walls in my mind. I’m sure I’ll be able to start practical practice soon. What about you, Hermione?”
“Yes, I was. I didn’t want to give them another chance to hurt you. I feel bad enough it happened the first time. If I had another chance to prevent it, I was not going to ignore that.”
"Sorry, Mom. Just a little distracted this morning." He smiled at her and took a large bite of his eggs for effect.
"Not really. Nothing's going on really. Just lots of things are going on and parts of me just don't know what's really going on. Just trying to sort it all out. So how'd the game go, by the way?" Both Ron and Hermione noticed the subject change but let it go.
“Better than I do in the dorms, yeah. Sorry for not waking you. I moved you to the bed to get a little sleep because you looked so tired. And don’t worry. Your virtue is still in tact.” Harry blushed at the insinuation.
“Don’t get smart with me, Harry. I meant with Malfoy. I saw you passing notes with him. Is he forcing you to do something you don’t want to do?” She looked at him with concern.
“I’m glad you showed up actually… I wanted to talk to you about going to Dumbledore. I know you said you wanted to think about it and I just wanted to see where your head was at.”
“I wasn’t too tired, so I stayed up reading a little bit. Reading’s soothing for me.” Draco put his book on the table and got up for the day.
"Where the fuck did you learn that spell? I feel like I've been trampled by a hippogriph." He braced his hand on Harry and dragged himself up right. He was in too much pain to think about killing Potter.
"Not very. Depends on the person. People have a shockingly hard time sitting still. Not to mention their thoughts race, they get itches, and people interrupt. That's partially where the pensieve comes in. When things that have happened bother you, you place them in vials and when your head is clearer after you meditate, you take another look. Time to head to class though, or we'll be late."
“Hermione, I get that. I really do. But it’s just like I said at the table the other day. Growing up in a Wizarding family, you’re generally expected to follow the same ideals, come to Hogwarts and wind up in the same house. Ron, it was thought that you would be in Gryffindor, right?” At Ron’s nod, he continued. “The boys would have teased you mercilessly if you had wound up in any other house. How would your parents have reacted if you’d been in Slytherin? Do you think it’s not the same in a Pureblood household that follows the Dark Arts? That they’re not ingrained to see Muggleborns as lesser, that to be in any other house than Slytherin would make them lesser in the eyes of their parents? They’re taught that Dark Arts and following Voldemort will unlock their potential and bring them to greatness. Then, they come to Hogwarts. They escape the confines of their parents' worldview. They meet other children in a manner not controlled by their parents. They meet someone like Hermione. A beautiful, talented witch, but someone their parents have taught them is a Mudblood for the circumstances of her birth.” He watched carefully to see how the message was being received, watched the cringe at his word choice.
"Magic without words?" She looked up and bit her lip as she thought. "That would depend on your discipline. There's two issues you have to deal with. It requires a great deal more concentration and willpower. That's what our magic basically is, forcing our will through our wands like a conduit. The second issue is that speaking is something that's a habit for us. We connect the words we speak with our intentions and basically give the words power. That's why you have to think happy memories for a Patronus. You're pushing that memory, that power through your wand and producing it in a physical manifestation. Why the sudden interest?"
“He expressed some of the same concerns. But he’s also reached out to students here. He let them know that they have protection, should they desire it. I don’t know if any have accepted the offer or not. I don’t even know if he’d tell me if they did. But I hope they do. I don’t want to see anymore lost to Voldemort.”
"They're notebooks and pens. Instead of loose parchment, they're papers fitted on metal rings to keep the papers together. And the pens hold the ink in a plastic container that dispenses it automatically, rather than dipping in the inkpot constantly. It also dries faster to help against smearing. As for the Mind Arts, I was thinking over ways to have an edge or advantage in a duel. Knowing body language, reading lips, all assist with anticipating your opponents next moves. It helps prepare counterspells or shields and increases the chance of winning. When I was talking to Hermione, she mentioned it requires discipling the mind, having greater control over your thoughts and by extension your magic. She also mentioned meditation and through research into that, I found Occulmency. It also serves another purpose of calming and assisting with focusing your mind for exams." He chuckled nervously.
He stopped her at the portrait and gave her a quick hug before they entered. Claiming tiredness, he waved at Ron before ignoring the hurt look on his face and headed up to the dorm room. He changed into pajamas before climbing into his bed. He grabbed his cloak and map, made up his bed like he was still in it and spelled the bed curtains. He wrapped the cloak around himself and left the dorms. He watched Hermione and Ron for a moment before leaving the Common Room. He walked quickly to the Room of Requirement, eager to see Draco. He paced in front of the door and launched himself in as soon as it opened. Draco was curled in the armchair by the fireplace reading a book.
Draco woke to thrashing next to him. Low moans and quiet screams jolted him from his sleep. He sat up to see Harry tossing and turning next to him, clearly in the throes of a nightmare. He shook him gently, calling his name. When Harry didn’t wake from his nightmare, he shook him harder.
Dumbledore nodded and Harry muttered his goodbyes. He pulled a chair over to Draco’s bedside and closed the curtains around his bed. The swelling around the blond’s face was starting to go down after Madam Pomfrey’s ministrations, but he still looked brutal. With all the blood cleaned up, the boy just looked pale and broken.  Harry felt the guilt eat at him. He shouldn’t have left Draco alone this morning. He had been honest from the start that he would be targeted by other Slytherins and he should have kept a more careful eye on him, even if just through the map. He felt antsy watching the boy sleep, so he pulled out his Potion’s text and looked over the pain relief potion they had been working on in class.
“There’s been no sighting of Yaxley as far as Alasdair knows. But we’ll have to get out into the village tomorrow, have a proper look about, find out who knows what.”
He banished their clothes when undressing proved to take too long, and sank back without complaint onto the bed when Potter eased him down.
“We just don’t get strangers here,” she'd told him helplessly, taking up her knitting needles, on which an ice-blue scarf was taking shape. “You and your oaf of a partner are the first all year. Now,” she took a sip of her tea before she forged on, “You tell that horrid chap you’re with not to go riling up the Healer! He’s the best thing that’s happened to this village in a long time. He fixed my hip, you know, and I’m ever so pleased. Now I can manage the stairs better than ever and I'm making him this scarf; he wouldn’t take any payment.”
“How are Weasley and Granger?” Draco asked, trying to distract him, taking a long gulp of his cider.
“I haven’t seen him,” Draco insisted, his eyes flicking again to Potter’s partner even though he already knew he was going to see the distrust and disgust he found on the older man’s face.
Harry continued to the spot he had seen Draco’s name, impatient at the speed Dumbledore was walking. He had a feeling in the pit of his stomach that he just had to get there and soon. He turned one last corner and his stomach dropped when he saw a crumpled figure in a corner. He ran and dropped next to the figure. There was a pool of blood and the blond’s hair was matted with it. He rolled him over with a groan and just stared at his face. Dumbledore moved Harry out of the way and ran his wand over Draco. He cast a levitation spell on Draco and turned to Harry.
Time passed quickly while Harry quietly worked on his homework. He knew his other classes had to have started, but he couldn’t tear himself away from the Hospital Wing. He was worried that whoever had attacked Draco would come back to finish the job. He didn’t know if the injuries had been meant to kill him or just to send a message to him, but he wasn’t going to give them the chance. Madam Pomfrey came in and out of the curtains checking on Draco’s condition. After a couple hours, she deposited a tray of stew and bread with a goblet of pumpkin juice next to Harry with strict instructions to eat. As he dug in, there was another rustle of the curtains. He looked up to see Ron and Hermione peering in. He dropped his spoon and ushered them out quickly.
"I found it in a book... I'm so sorry." He resisted dragging Malfoy to him once more and hung his head in shame.
“Just having a conversation. Draco and I have spent the last 5 years always at each other’s throats. We never took the opportunity to actually listen to one another. Having the patience to stop and actually hear what’s coming out of the other person’s mouth does wonders for understanding someone. Just like you did tonight. I know you came into this looking for how he could be manipulating me, but even so, you were open to the possibility that he wasn’t. And I thank you for that, Hermione. I really do.”
“We can start with getting your things from the Manor. I can do that tonight while you’re still here in the Hospital Wing. Madam Pomfrey would like to keep you overnight for observation. I will have your things stored until tomorrow and we can get you situated. I will also send an owl to a friend of mine to get the process of your emancipation started. It’s not difficult, but can be time consuming. I am hoping your circumstances will speed the process up, so your parents have no legal say in your presence at Hogwarts. You may need to have a court hearing and explain your side of the story. I do recommend you keep up appearances with your parents until we hear back from him on how to proceed. No need to give them a reason to demand you be removed from Hogwarts. I will go get started and you rest. You will be excused from lessons tomorrow to get settled. Mr. Potter, you may remain here, but please make sure you’re in the Tower before curfew.”
, can’t be muddied... look, a lot of ancient power and skills lies in the old Wizarding bloodlines. Death Eaters joined him because they wanted to preserve the lines of that power and natural ability. Voldemort offered the surest way to do it. I’m not making excuses,” Draco hurried to add, because Potter had gone very tight-lipped.
The room around them was dead silent with tension, though the young Quidditch fan from the bar had rushed to Draco’s side and hovered with a protective hand around his elbow as she murmured something in his ear, and a middle-aged couple had stood to position themselves directly between him and Innes.
Potter had been good-looking in their school days – now he was just plain hot. His olive skin made his green eyes all the more stunning, and his previously unruly hair was shorter at the sides than Draco had ever seen it, but longer on top. Robes were never the most attractive garment, but Potter’s shoulders and arms were clearly defined in his, noticeable even through Draco’s haze of shock.
Only too happy to turn away from him and head down the path of his first house-call, Harry glanced at the slumping pink begonias in a hanging basket at the front door, which itself needed a fresh coat of yellow paint, then reached out to knock.
“Harry. Mate. Three bodies were recovered two days ago from a château in Sancerre, France. All known associates of Yaxley. Narcissa and Draco Malfoy seem to have gotten away safely; they’ve been tracked to another region of France, and watched but not approached. We thought... well, the next step is up to you.”
“We don’t know jack shit!” Gawain roared over them both. “Because you two still haven’t deigned to do your fucking job and canvas the fucking village! Malfoy is to be questioned along with everyone else, nothing more, nothing less. I didn’t tell you that he lives there, Potter, because it’s none of your bloody damn business! He is a trained medical professional and has done nothing to warrant any suspicion. Innes, he has served his community these past years in ways you can’t imagine, from curing the most complex of diseases to healing the most minor of skinned knees so do
Looking from one to the other, refusing to allow himself to give in to guilt, or shame, or fear, Draco straightened his shoulders and raised his chin.
He needn’t have bothered. Yaxley was sitting on a rock inside the cave as if it were a throne, casual as anything.
“Lad’s never happy,” Innes grunted. “I don’t give a flobberworm’s ass about his happiness, so long as he lives.”
Banging from the mouth of the cave indicated the apparition of his reinforcements, and Harry only let Innes go when Gawain eased his fingers free.
Then Potter’s oaf of a partner slammed his way inside, Potter’s unconscious body thrown over his shoulder. Draco was scrambling over to help lay him down flat on the flagstones without thinking about it, worry beating the guilt to churn away in his stomach.
Of course, Blaise's Mother could use his owl, and send actual letters to Blaise. But his mother had to get up in the middle of the night to sneak Draco letters. Draco had a strong urge to hit something, but his thoughts were interrupted by Weasley who walked by them, talking loudly to Potter and Granger. “She can’t just ban Quidditch, I mean- It’s quidditch!”
His father came over, Draco scrambled for his wand but also prepared himself for the hit to come. It was a magical backhand across his face.
Draco's heart was racing, and he began to build his walls, from the ground up, as Snape had taught him to. He forced the word “Yes” to come out of his mouth. He didn’t know how his father would react to this information. He had been stupid not to see it coming, Father knew Draco had been blocking him out of dreams, and would know he was being trained.
, Potter.” Draco wasn’t answering the question, but the implied words behind them. “C’mon then, I'll teach you.” Harry ignored him and stood up, laughing as Draco began shaking his head in horror. “Oh come on, it’s not that hard- I’ve taught practically everyone else in the year-”
“Yes, and it’s wonderful to have her back. It was... difficult at first, but she is slowly regaining her own mind once again. Come, Bella will want to meet you.” She led him into the antechamber and through to the sitting room.
“Yes, Father did mention he knew you, he's very excited to see just what you can do with the school.” He gestured to Blaise who stood awkwardly beside him. “This is Blaise, an American exchange student, I’m just helping him out by showing him to all his classes.” He paused and smiled at Blaise, then gestured back to Umbridge “But this is also a great opportunity to introduce you to one of the more
Potter. You don’t understand- I won’t deny that I’ve undergone a… change in perspective.” He could feel Potter’s eyes boreing into the back of his head. “But I never put myself in danger- I never put myself at risk like Snape did. I always hid and acted from the sidelines... So don’t- don’t compare me to him, because he
He didn’t try to fill the silence again in the time it took them to reach the common room. Just before they entered she stopped him. “Wait a second.”
Narcissa looked sharply at the boys “Put those away. If you attack my son again, I shall ensure that it is the last thing you ever do.” Potter’s eyes switched from Draco to his mother
Goyle’s wand flew out of his hand and disappeared into the mountain of objects beside him and he immediately tried to retrieve it. Draco, on the other hand, focused on getting out of the way of Granger’s second well-aimed stunner.
After making sure he was okay and getting him some of his occlumency medicine, Pansy left to get them dinner from the house elves. Soon she had returned and was questioning him. He described what had happened, and she was shocked. “It only lasted for like, a second” she informed him, “You went up to him, he spoke to you and stood up, then you stepped back and fell to the floor. Then he told you to leave. That was all”
“I think I’ve buried what I needed well enough, but I'll need to make some memories with you to cover them.”
He growled as the thought came unbidden to his head and he shoved it aside. He left the room feeling sour.
“You bloody menace” As usual, Draco couldn’t help but grin back. “Where have you been all night then? All week? We’ve missed you” Around him, Pansy, Crabbe and Goyle nodded.
They walked into the out of the castle and towards the groundskeeper’s house, rejoicing to be free of the inane torture that had been Defence against the Dark arts.
This was a man he had always respected and in a way loved, but he had come to hate the beliefs he had once shared with him.
Draco rolled his eyes and got back to measuring, “The instructions will appear on the board once the Gryffindors get here…they always take their time. They don't like potions.”
As he tramped around the lake and the morning frost crushed beneath his feet, he tried to process what he had dreamed the night before. Most of it was gone but he could still hear the weird voice saying “Why am I here?” Draco shook his head… it didn't matter. There was no use giving himself a headache trying to remember a dream.
Chest heaving, he stopped and immediately darted to the side he spotted the procession coming out of the forbidden forest. His eyes found Voldemort, who was looking ever so vile and
“Thestrals,” said Hagrid and Draco’s mind was taken back to the night when they had gotten off the Hogwarts express. Theo had mentioned the beasts.
handsome boy from America sitting with us... he seems pretty interesting. I call dibs if he's Bi.” She said with a smirk and began walking away, checking over her shoulder that he was following.
After returning to the castle, he angrily worked on his occlumency for hours. He didn’t sleep well that night.
Despite the fact that Draco finally had realised his mistakes, had finally realised he was an asshole- Had been ready to just quietly let Potter get on with his life and not torment Granger anymore--
Pansy went a bright red and stuttered “Oh- I... Of course” she finished lamely. She turned and hurried away. Draco rolled his eyes, Pansy got so needlessly emotional sometimes.
The room sunk into a chilling silence again. Draco felt his body growing colder at the thought of the man- if he could even be called a man anymore- who had caused so much death and destruction. Who had changed every aspect of Draco’s life. Who- until now, had been… invincible.
“You alright mate?” Theos voice was soft, unheard by anyone else. Draco tried to put a brave face on. “Im- Im fine”
After Umbridge had sufficiently embarrassed and flustered Hagrid, they began the walk back towards the castle, and Draco couldn’t help himself “Who have you seen die?” Blaise looked at him coldly, while Theo gave him a side glance. Draco regretted asking the question immediately.
In answer, the oaf just pointed to the cow. Draco looked at the cow again, despite how gross it was, and held back a need to sprint in the other direction as he noticed a strip of flesh that seemingly tore itself off the carcass.
His Mother stepped back from him, shocked at his tone. Draco tilted his head, finding that he did not care. She was being far too worrisome. Just like she had always been.
“Really?” Potter took a step forward- getting too close to Mother, and Draco felt the anger rise within him as his protective instincts took over.
Horrified, Draco watched as the presence in his mind was transforming into a towering mass of darkness. Draco was distantly aware of his body stepping back, interpreting the distress signal Draco was subconsciously sending it-
The version I imagine Draco (eventually) playing of "The Heart Asks Pleasure First" is similar to that of Valentina Lisitsa. Its one of my most favourite piano pieces to play. (Fun Fact! I'm a musician!)
“He looks like a fool doesn't he.” Theo gestured “Bloody Weasleys...they make it so easy to make fun of them! Why... would you dress like that?! I wouldn’t turn up.” He laughed and held out a punch cup to Draco. “Want some?” Draco took the cup from him only to nearly spat out the drink upon sipping it.
Draco was frozen for a second, processing the death, but Snape's and Dumbledore's words came back to him quickly enough.
So Draco did. He was angry but not surprised. This was Lucius Malfoy, the great manipulator, he had a plan for everything, and plenty of minions to execute anything.
“It’s something that comes with the teeth” Fenrir smiled, his teeth glistening in the lamplight. “Blending in with the shadows that is.” He snorted “Not the secret that I keep.” He gestured to Blaise’s door “I’ve been watching the boy’s door. Don’t want him running off without payment now.”
As Harry stalked away Draco found his eyes once again being drawn to his sworn enemy, his gaze slid lower, and centred on Potters rather round a- A loud sigh came from Theo who was sitting beside him.
He dusted off his hands and straightened his robes, and resisted rolling his eyes as his Mother gave him a look.
Draco looked up to find the small house elf which clutched the stack of parchment in its hand. He nodded and gestured to his table.
The waitress nodded and waved her wand, which caused the correct cutlery to appear on the table before them.
He had always been the more tolerant father figure in Draco’s life… and Draco was fairly sure he knew Draco was gay. Snape taught him everything useful he had ever known and had always made sure he was okay. But Snape acted as a double agent against Dumbledore, he was a pivotal figure in the meetings between the Death Eaters... Snape was on the wrong side.
There was silence, and then something Draco never thought he would ever hear come from the stony professor was softly spoken, “I’m sorry Draco.”
“Congratulations,” Said Theo, in a Snape-like drawl “You have just awarded mediocrity” -this time he got giggles as a reaction.
And I am way hotter than you.” Pansy huffed and continued on. “Such a tragedy… anyway, we’re nearly there- game face on.”
that you hide behind! I see your conversations! I see everything!” Draco felt invisible hands wrap around his neck, and begin to lift him off the ground. He was choking silently. Mother screamed. “Lucius, no! He is your so-” With a flick of his wand, Father sent her flying backwards into the wall behind her, a sickening thump making Draco’s stomach drop in panic. Lucius turned to her, a deranged look upon his face, “Don’t you dare defend him! He brings shame to the Malfoy name- you stupid woman!” Father's attention on Mother broke the lifting curse on Draco. His petrified body fell to the ground, meaning he hit his hip on the dining chair along the way. He sucked in a sharp breath through his nose, as his mouth wouldn't open. He began to panic as he saw his father grasping his mother's throat- with real hands this time. Draco went to scream, but it got caught in his tightly sealed mouth. He was powerless and could do nothing. Tears began to leak from his eyes, blurring his vision. His heart thundered in his chest- he was panicking.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Blaise began to pile food onto Draco’s plate. “You have to eat Draco, we talked about this.”
He glanced over at Blaise who he had almost forgotten was there. He didn’t feel as if he could speak so he just nodded and left for a shower.
Apparently his Mother took his grunt of exertion as a call to enter, for she opened the door and gave him a flabbergasted look when she saw him hanging from thin air by his hands- one of which curled around her wand.
“Welcome to the family” he greeted one girl who looked more frightened than the others. She smiled nervously and stuck out her hand.
“Just lost in thoughts is all…” He paused, trying to gathering courage, but failing “How have you been?”
Once again, it was difficult to write and anything you liked/didn't like commented down below would be appreciated.
Eyes alight with the thrill of the hunt, Crabbe whipped his wand at the fifty-foot mountain of old furniture, broken trunks, old books, robes and unidentifiable junk, and shouted, “Descendo!”
“I heard you were fucking crazy” He heard his mother's gasp behind him, but he was focused on the woman in front of him, whos amused smile had widened into a manic grin. She cackled, her hollowed out eyes suddenly lighting up with an intensity Draco could not have foreseen.
Despite his fear, Draco stood tall in his own mind, knowing this time Voldemort was taking a specific interest and wouldn’t be tricked by the sight of a small cowering boy- he was hunting for evidence of foul play, and anything to do with Potter. Draco could feel his hunger through the connection legilimency created.
against his father, forcing him out. They struggled for a moment and Draco searched for extra strength. He found the memory of his mother crying in his arms and gathered the anger.
No matter how many times he told himself that he knew kissing boys was a bad idea, the thought kept nagging at him.
“And I’m not gay, you fucking idiot!” Weasley cut Potter off, his face now a bright scarlet which matched his horrid hair.
Theo rolled his eyes “I bloody knew it, you literally never stop! It's amazing you have time to study.” Pansy just smiled sweetly, but there was a different, more mischievous kind of joy in her eyes.
A few minutes later Blaise stepped back from the mock dummy he had made from pillows and blankets, bound together with magic and levitating off the floor. He beckoned Draco over “Hit it.”
Unfortunately, once again it might be a bit until my next upload as there is quite a bit I have to write. :(
Her eyes brightened, she had come up with an idea. “I would like you both to gather some of the other reputable members of your house for my own,
“It’s not that simple... Draco, he loves you. You are still his son. He is just struggling to change a belief he thought was wrong his entire life. His father did incredibly cruel things to him as he grew up and he thinks that his treatment of you is normal.” Draco felt tears prickling in his eyes.
I know I said I hadn't written too much on this new Draco... but... I wanted to show the deteriorating of his relationships and include some things critical to the story later. Ah! Sorry!
Yes, the next part of this story will be filled with far more Drarry. Sorry I pulled you through that.
They began to approach the counter, only to be stopped by a heavy hand which fell on Draco’s shoulder.
He had finished and taken notes on three chapters, and was well through his fourth when Pansy said “Draco, come on, we’re almost there. We should change into our robes now.” Despite being annoyed at the interruption he knew she was right. He got up and slowly stretched, he hadn’t moved in hours. He was pleased to see out of the corner of his eye that the new boy, Blaise, was watching him.
They made their way to Madame Malkins, and Draco smiled as the rows of brightly coloured fabric and clothes that filled the windows took him back to his childhood when he and his mother had often gone robe shopping together, it was one of the passions they had shared as he had grown.
Draco moved out of the way as his house began to leave the hall. He saw, out of the corner of his eye- the
As he said it, he shoved back at the wall of muscle, pleased to find Crabbe actually staggered back. His workouts were doing something then.
Crabbe and Goyle had made their way back over, and targeted the Hufflepuff “Yeah, do you have a problem with us?” The cruel look was back in their eyes again.
was with Blaise. Before his Father found out. His father in his dreams last night proved he was still weak.
Something in him was horrified, but something else much darker was egging him on. He recoiled once he realised what it was.
Crabbe and Goyle made their way over, cracking their knuckles and grinning. They were fairly confident they were going to get the beater positions. Millicent Bulstrode was a contester for one of the beater positions but Draco thought that she wouldn't have the chemistry that the two boys did.
Draco conjured a protego, anticipating the oncoming curse- only to be thrown off his feet, along with Blaise, as Bellatrix growled and stalked over to them. They were both still on the floor.
Luna smiled as she came out of the shower, her hair wet. She took the tea from Draco and then went over to his cabinet to grab some ginger biscuits. After Draco had discovered they were her favourite he always made sure to keep them stocked for her when he brought her into his room.
. Did that mean quidditch? It couldn’t, quidditch was the first thing that had brought him real joy in over two months. He hadn’t been able to play the previous year at all so there was no fucking way he wasn’t going to be allowed to play again. His Father's words came back to him. “
He would have to do some more boxing soon- he hadn’t been able to keep his mind on task for at least an hour...or maybe some pushups, or some pull ups? Or maybe he would just lose his mind to the piano.
Finally, at the hospital wards doors, Snape spoke. “Draco, you must never forget to do the meditations,
As he desperately searched for anything that could help him-- it struck him like a bolt of lightning.
“Your defence is strong but still has cracks in it. You will need to make sure the foundation is stronger before you build upon it.” This was Draco’s only warning before Snape slipped through one of the forsaid cracks and was in Draco’s mind. Draco immediately tried to clear his mind. But he knew he was not successful as he felt Snape digging through memories, an unmatched force in his mind. Draco began to muster his strength for a counterattack. Snape stopped at the memory of Pansy and Draco making badges.
He father frowned. “That’s impossible. I have him sworn under oath. He would risk death if he betrayed any of our secrets.” His father left.
“Better,” She smiled “Much better. Now that Bella is here- and you too! It’s wonderful to have you home.”
Draco continued, not caring. “Is it- Is it possible that Fenrir Greyback could let the wizarding world know that the Zabini’s are here?”
He was about to call that out when he realised Granger had already beaten him to it- her hand was stuck up in that stupid way of hers, like she was bursting with the answer. Draco, hating himself, took the opportunity to make fun of her. He imitated her- much to Pansy’s delight whos laugh turned into a scream when she noticed the Bowtruckles. The little creatures had jumped at the noise of her scream.
“That’s quite enough!” said Madam Malkin sharply, and looked to his mother for support who had just come out from behind a clothes rack “Madam, please!”
He didn't know how long he sat there but at some point a house elf appeared and vanished what was left of the vase, telling Draco dinner would be served in an hour.
“Over here!” Came an American accent, and it took Draco a second to realise it was Blaise calling them. They made their way over to what looked like a pretty uncomfortable Blaise. “Why do you look like you’ve seen a Boggart?” Said Pansy as they walked over.
He had walked in to find Blaise, Theo, Crabbe and Goyle waiting for them. The crackling of the fire was the only sound to be heard.
“Why did you do it then? If you're a coward- why did you help me? Why did you give this up?” Harry’s voice was too soft.
He punched his bedpost, and pain ricocheted up his arm. The action along with the pain felt good. He hit it again.
"He might be a hated Death Eater, but he's still a Death Eater," Goyle continued his reasoning "he wouldn't turn down a chance to get Potter whether we were there or not because he'd still get all the credit." The words were spoken with some venom.
you and you weren’t there…” He couldn’t bear to look at her, but he heard her sob. He closed his eyes, wishing for-- he didn’t know. Something to make this
Draco opened his eyes. He was on the floor- but this time he was not shocked. He pulled himself off the cold flagstones, his mind in a protective blank state, and grabbed Blaise’s hand to drag him from the room- ignoring the pounding in his head from the occlumency. His Father’s scream of pain filled the room as they ran from it and he could hear more screams as he ran through the hallways to his room.
However, two days away from Christmas he was surprised by Pansy, Crabbe and Goyle when they returned early, citing that they had ‘gotten bored’ at home. That had been a good night, full of laughter and boardgames. Draco had been happy.
what this joke of a school needs... You do know how involved with my peers and my own education he is.” Umbridge nodded. The mentioning of his father had caught her attention.
Draco watched as Crabbe and Goyle's dissolusion charms had wore off, their forms coming back into focus in his eyes - a very odd process - and so he too revealed himself. The more Potter saw, the better his chance.
“Oh don’t give me that look Draco. Do better.” She snarled as she rebuked him. “For now, not getting hit is a good place to start. It’s good to develop your dodging instincts. But eventually, you will start having to be on the offensive.”
Draco felt the same longing for better times... but then growled as the anger came back in full force. He threw the photo across the room, but it didn't break as the vase had last time. In response, Draco punched the wall. A large dent opened under his fist and pain blossomed up his arm. It felt good. Realising he didn't want his father in his room he cast a silencing charm. Then he punched the wall again.
Hagrid turned around, looking pleased with himself. “Now... put yer hands up, who can see 'em?” he looked around as Potter and Longbottom stuck their hands up. Blaise cautiously raised his too. “Yeah ... yeah, I knew you'd be able ter, Harry,” Hagrid looked sincere 'An' you too, Neville, eh? An...” Hagrid trailed off, obviously not knowing Blaise’s name. Theo slowly raised his hand, an uncomfortable expression on his face.
This time when Voldemort entered Draco’s head he didn’t bother to put on his show of fire and lightning, he just threw aside Draco’s walls. Draco felt himself cry out from the shock.
Draco and Blaise finished their potions quickly- Blaise's colour and scent were slightly off, causing Snape to inform him it might; “Let someone have a peaceful 3-hour
with anyone. Umbridge stood out stuck out her hand, Draco went to shake it and wasn't surprised by how clammy it was.
“Well... you can’t enter when someone else-” Draco was cut off as he felt a wand shoved into his back and Crabbe's voice came from the other side, “We watched you enter that room a hundred times, Draco. Including the time when Trelawney was in there- No funny business.”
Draco raised his hands in the air as Harry Potter stared at him and, after a second of being gobsmacked, immediately started apologising.
Draco took the largest breath of him life. He opened his eyes and found himself on the floor. He did not remember getting there. “Leave now, boy. You are too young for the table” The Dark Lord left the room. Draco pulled himself off the ground and with Pansy’s help went back to his rooms. He couldn't believe he had succeeded in hiding the memories. He had managed to fool the
Hello! Please leave comments and suggestions! No seriously, please leave a comment to make me feel as if I'm doing something because someone wants to read it?... Maybe a kudos? I dont know what the fuck I'm doing man.
and he invaded my mind... He invaded everything that was private to me! He found that stupid fucking kiss and tried to beat it out of me-
Underneath the rather disturbing sounding headline was a rather disturbing looking woman. Her hair was curled in tight ringlets around her rather bulbous head, her face was pinched into a patronising smile and her eyes came out cold through the paper. He picked up the prophet, raising his eyebrow at the ugly woman who couldn't see him doing it. Of course, the Prophet was utter shit these days so he didn't really believe it when it cited this new inquisitor was “
“At least you’re not as uptight as your parents.” She swept out of the room, calling as she left “I will train you to be better than the mudblood, have no fear”
Draco probably could have refused on the grounds of studying for his OWLs, but he knew he had studied more than enough and he wanted to see his Mother, he was worried what the presence of Bellatrix had done to her. Blaise had also decided to come to support Draco and to see his mother.
“Yes, I do understand how that may not be beneficial to one’s mental state. Is that all that has been causing you to be distant?”
“You have to murder someone to tear your soul. And he’s not short on murders to pick from.” Theo's face was dark.
Always, his mind would play these events and words over and over. He could do nothing, but surely he could do
The first whistle for the Hogwarts express echoed shrilly across the platform, meaning the students could board the train. Pansy grabbed Draco's hand and began dragging him towards the Hogwarts Express. Draco broke the contact, disliking the feeling of her sweaty hand in his. She looked back, confused.
Granger raised her hand. “The only people who can see thestrals,” she said, “are people who have seen death.”
“Possibly,” said Borgin, his eyes lighting up with greed. “I’ll need to see it, though. Why don’t you bring it into the shop?”
“I saw your decree this morning. I think it’s a great idea. Clubs truly can be dangerous if they aren’t regulated well.”
“Well, there are other ways to make your head shut up. You’re not in control if you turn to something that is painful. That means the pain is controlling
Draco considered his words. “I swear to never again, while drunk, speak ill of the cause you follow.” He met his father's furious look. “I will say no more. You will not put me in a cage like that.” His father grunted, a furious look upon his face.
Is everything making sense? Im scared the writing quality has gone down in my rush to get chapters out :l
Draco suddenly didn't know what to think. He hated his father but such compliments had always been rare. Something had warmed inside him. He despised it.
Snape addressed the class, “Those of you who have managed to read the instructions, fill one flagon with a sample of your potion, label it clearly with your name and bring it up to my desk for testing,” said Snape. “Homework: twelve inches of parchment on the properties of moonstone and its uses in potion-making, to be handed in on Thursday.”
An ethereal light swelled at the tip of his wand, and from it burst a large stag- it had been the animal that had startled Draco before- but now it just cantered gently up to him, it's light as beautiful as its wielder.
Draco and Pansy spent the next hour finishing the badges off while Crabbe and Goyle handed them out to all the Slytherins. They were all tasked with making sure as many people as possible wore them the next day, especially the Hufflepuffs.
the carriages. Look!” At their confused looks Blaise desperately looked around, then pointed “They see them!” He was referring to two people standing, near a carriage, looking up, as if at a horse. Draco realised it was Potter and some blonde girl. The girl reached a hand out to the air, as if she were petting a horse, then smiled at Potter and climbed into their carriage.
Also please leave a comment, I cannot explain how happy they make me and make it worth it - plus the messages on tumblr make me beyond happy! (plus these motivate me so if you want that new chapter you better bet yo ass Ima upload better content more quickly if you leave suggestions/critical advice and love!)
Draco had his usual breakfast, tea and newspaper delivered to his rooms, and was halfway through his fruit salad when his attention was caught by the headline “
” He could barely hear his mother’s voice echoing through his mind, but could see her pale, concerned face, and hear his vicious reply as clear as day.
Draco couldn’t help it, he laughed and then shoved his hand over his mouth, dismayed. Something about being in the potions environment again where he had always laughed at Potter made it easier to laugh.
Before he could stop himself, he snuck forward and stood in the doorway of the Great Hall, dissolusioned to everybody's eyes and searched his eyes roaming the hall.
Black spots appeared, his balance escaped him and he cried out and fell to the floor. He made eye contact with his Mother who was also on the floor across the room. Her neck was a deep red from the choking. He looked back to his father only to be grasped by the shirt and pulled up, His father used that grip to anchor Draco as he began hitting him.
Underneath the headline was a picture that gave Draco the chills. The ransacked shop had not been treated with any mercy- it was a message to the wizarding world. Just as every attack so far had been.
She tensed in his arms and he was horrified to discover how much weight she had lost since he had hugged her last. He supposed he had just gotten used to her sunken face.
Yeah so, I think that this was a mistake of the canon. There's no way that Narcissa, who only gave a shit about herself and her son wouldn't have taken his wand when she was wandless.
“Don’t be so petty” he snapped at them, enjoying it as their eyes widened. They were stupid, but they held too much confidential information for him to discard them.
“Oh,” Draco sighed, “That’s good. My Mother wasn’t doing so well by herself I don’t think.” He looked away from Blaise, and up at the bright blue sky.
“Sit down” said Blaise and Draco did as he was told. He drew his knees up to his chest and hid his head, hating this whole situation.
Shaking his head, he turned back to his marks, which were good enough. He would be dropping Care of Magical Creatures, so there was no need to feel disappointed about that- but the neatly written E placed so innocently next to ‘Defense Against the Dark Arts’ annoyed the shit out of him. He blamed Umbridge, for her incredibly inadequate lessons the previous year.
say or do anything that could compromise our family’s position in the Dark Lords mind.” He gripped Draco’s shoulder, Draco now recognised the look as a vicious anger, cold and under a facade of deathly calm. “Do not do anything stupid, such as getting drunk and saying
“You know, one day I am going to get you to open up” Blaise rested his hand upon Draco knee and Draco struggled to breathe for a second. He wanted to open up to Blaise, but knew he never could. Sighing, he changed the subject.
“Well...go on then!” Squeaked Flitwick. While Theo showed his mastery of Accio and Depulso to Flitwick by summoning and dismissing a pillow, Draco looked around for a more difficult object to summon.
as the blanket was whipped off Draco. He squinted, his eyes adjusting as she hauled him up and shoved him into a cupboard. “I’ll send Crabbe and Goyle back for you,” she whispered as she shut the door.
"Potter has another hour of Potions to complete, He will come upstairs when this class is finished."
There’s so much I have planned after school ends, but I want the character setup and exploration of Draco first, plus a few story elements that need to be there for after school.
The movie tried to rectify that in a now-deleted scene when Malfoy tosses Harry his wand, which you can see here if you didn't know about it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEywLcF16t8
“Master Lucius wishes to see the young Draco in his office, sir.” Before Draco could say anything, the elf had raised its hand and
Pansy snickered “Maybe she's secretly related to a ghoul!” Crabbe and Goyle barked out loud laughs, causing a sleeping painting on the wall beside them to wake up with a start.
Pansy sighed, then rushed over and hugged him. “Are you okay...truly?” Her whisper was close to his ear and full of worry.
He closed his eyes to block out the smoke and yelled again, his scream weaker for he could not get a proper breath in. “HELP ME!”
. All four of them slowed down to take it in, not believing this was where they ate their meals everyday. The only feature which had stayed was the enchanted ceiling, which now dusted them with a light layer of enchanted snow which disappeared upon contact. He led Pansy over to the drinks table, noticing all the eyes on them. As he poured them both some punch he began to hear the whispers. “She looked incredible” and “I can't believe how different she looked!” Pansy practically glowed besides him, until they heard “And she got Viktor Krum! How on earth did that happen?” He and Pansy looked at each other in shock. Who had gotten Krum? They both looked around, not willing to actually ask somebody.
They were approaching the majority of the class when Goyle spotted Potter. He snorted and exclaiming “Oh look, it’s the new
“She doesn't have money, she doesn't have a family name, she only has her own resources. I put myself in a position of power above her, and despite that conflicting with her because I’m a fifteen year old boy-” Draco paused, admiring his own abilities for a second, “She ultimately realized there was someone with power over her and her most automatic response is to submit.”
It was a bright, cloudless morning and he was stretching- about to begin his daily run around the lake when Blaise jogged up “Can I come? ...If you don’t want me to I can run somewhere else.” Blaise looked hopeful, Draco couldn’t turn him down.
Draco had just made it in when he was roughly grabbed by Crabbe and pushed onto the wall beside the door.
Draco couldn’t speak- his mouth opened and closed, but he swallowed again and then managed, “I was sick of the death, and the suffering. I just wanted it to be over.” He didn’t even think to lie.
“Oh Draco, this will go perfectly with my dress tonight! Thank you darling!” she stepped up to him and they quickly kissed. Pansy looked at him with adoring eyes, they both had agreed this was good for the fake memories. He made sure to cement the memory in his mind so it would be the first his father would find. Everybody, including Crabbe and Goyle, thought he and Pansy were dating, so nobody batted an eye. They then proceeded to cuddle on the couch as Draco opened the pile of presents from his parents and other relatives.
“That music was...pleasant, you are very good at what you do” Draco bowed his head, knowing that few received praise from the man in front of him. “Thank you, My Lord.” As he spoke he felt the same presence in his mind again, small and inconspicuous, considering his walls.
His Father glanced up, beckoned him in and then went back to his work. Draco, assuming this meant he would be ignored for some time, sat in the chair in front of his father and began picking at his nails and looking around the room he was rarely allowed into.
“Getting through” was her response. She untangled herself, “I’m so proud you made Prefect dear” The letter from Hogwarts had come two nights before. Draco had tossed it away, not caring. It had been expected.
“No!” Blaise looked panicked. “I’m fine Draco, really. I don’t want you to have to go to your father unnecessarily. Greyback’s just another asshole who would do anything to get with my mother. I don’t want to make him feel he has power over me if your father cracks down on him. Just- just let it cool down.”
“Potter.” Draco tried to match the contempt. He resisted the urge to criticize Potter, as he still had the ferret incident hanging over his head, which- he reminded himself- he would get Potter back for. He and Pansy had some wonderful badges coming along.
He sat down on a fallen statue and put his head in his hands again, wondering how he had any tears left at all.
Umbridge’s eyes bulged “He what- dear? I have heard none of these doubts from the minister!” She was struggling to maintain her pleasant expression, and her face was going red.
Bright sunlight came through the windows, shining down and beautifully lighting one of the darkest witches in existence.
“First year Slytherins! This way Please!” Pansy’s voice caught the attention of the nervous looking children who quickly flocked towards them.
It took a couple of minutes, but after separating the parts of his mind and building his walls, and double-checking their strength, he slowly stood up and walked towards it. It's measured pulsating sped up, it seemed to know something was happening. He wondered if it was conscious.
“So, how were your holiday’s guys?” Draco glanced up and found Blaise looking directly at him. He realised everyone in the cabin was looking at Draco too.
He flicked his wand, and the two steaming cups he had just made began to drift over. As they did, Draco once again picked up one of the cut ropes off the bed.
“Ten points to Slytherin for reading quietly!” said Pansy, perfectly recreating the tones of Umbridge, who had actually awarded them points for such a stupid endeavour. “Merlin,” she continued “You’d think she would realise that's an embarrassment to the house, giving us points for something so stupid!”
Man, I forgot how happy this once made me before I let it stress me out. Ima be taking my time and not trying to stick to any sort of schedule so hopefully, I won't abandon this anytime soon.
They made it to the small village, and despite the Easter joy that seemed to be in the air, they were both solemn-faced. Draco pushed the door of the three broomsticks, sighing as the familiar smell and atmosphere hit him. He looked around, his father nowhere to be found.
As soon as they got out of the shop Draco headed for a side alley, barely hearing his Mother’s footsteps behind him. He doubled over as they reached the safety of the darkness, and placed his hands over his head to try and stop the anger which was consuming him.
Deciding that being above ground might make him feel better, he took his Charms homework and went up to the library enjoying the bright sunlight streaming through the windows and the warmth that came with it. As he was getting settled at his table he saw the newly reunited Golden Trio walking by. Ever since the display Potter had put on for the first task, Weasley was no longer ignoring Potter. Draco scoffed,
“Na-uh” said Blaise who whipped the covers off him. “We... are going for a run.” Draco groaned, hating Blaise with a burning passion. “Nice ass by the way.” Blaise chuckled as Draco yelped and jumped out of bed, clad only in underwear. He covered his junk with his hand.
“I need you for something before class starts, so hurry up” He took another bite of his apple and then turned to Theo, who was frowning at him.
Draco's stomach dropped. He had seen his father's mark but it had always been a faded red, and most certainly had never
“Good Morning Draco,” His Mother looked a bit distant- she had been since Voldemort had come into the household. She didn’t even seem to find it odd that Draco was out of his rooms.
He knocked and waited for the muffled “Enter” to respond. It was a longer wait than usual. Merlin, his father was such a
Let's keep in mind he's been self-harming, and has cut himself off from his family and friends. Very vulnerable.
Snape took the bottle back as Draco shoved it back at him, glad to be done. He sunk into a seat, placing his head in his hands, emotionally and physically drained.
Draco sniffed, slowly drawing himself out of the haze. He couldn't see any way to make it better so for now...just for now- he would play along.
“No.” Draco spoke sharply, trying to scare the screams away as well as Harry’s pity, “I had a change of heart a long time before that actually, but it’s… complicated.” He didn’t quite feel like explaining his crush on Harry quite at this moment, or his experience being trapped in his own head for almost an entire year, the latter of which had changed him quite a lot.
Draco twisted out of the way of a stunning spell she fired at him while Blaise tired to circle around her.
Not long after that, they were jogging in the gardens, the smell of various flowers filling their nostrils. Draco had missed them and the colours they held. As they jogged past the broom shed Draco pulled up and gestured. They had abstained from flying during the winter- But now... now it was spring. Blaise grinned and they rushed to grab some brooms and a practice snitch.
and he also agreed to incite this new order, for the benefit of the school of course-” Her stumbling over the words highlighted her uncomfort. Draco knew she was close to cracking.
Draco found ‘boxing’ as Blaise called it, and running, were his favourite ways to help his head from flying into fits of rage or horror at the situation... not that he didn’t. Several times he found himself kicking or punching walls, or even sometimes statues, and suits of armour- much to their distress.
Draco- still putting up a facade as a monster as Ollivander is in the dungeon (He fears Ollivander may unwillingly betray him if Voldemort looks into his mind) he takes Luna to his rooms. She then proceeds to attack him until he convinces her that he is trying to help her.
“Lets go and see how Potter’s coping with being beaten by Weasley! ...Pansy told us.” Their smiles were cruel. Draco had never noticed that before. But after having spent a number of weeks with Death Eaters he now noticed the small details. The glint in the eyes- The eyes that held no kindness at all. He wandered how often he had once worn the same smile.
He was pleased to see that he had double potions after History of Magic and had a free period later in the day before Ancient Runes. Tuesday, however, bought Defence against the Dark Arts. He couldn’t help but wonder what lessons with Umbridge would bring.
“You were already on the right track with the punching, you just need something soft that won’t hurt you hands.” Draco felt Blaise’s cool hand touch his own. Draco flinched, his hands still hurt as the potion hadn’t yet fully healed him.
Still breathing heavily, Harry continued explaining, “Anyway, yeah, it’s like my brain was falling from the sky, and it pulled the parachute- ah... the things muggles use to stop them from falling- so they just glide slowly to ground… they use them to kinda just float above the world…”
“Mr Malfoy! And Mr Zabini! Why you have me quite unprepared! Did you make an appointment I’ve forgotten about dear?”
No. It wasn't a realisation. He snapped himself out of it. It was just a stupid reaction to the actions of Potter. He would find anyone doing this to be incredibly hot. Anyone. Father would not find the image of Draco cheering for Potter in his mind. He would bury it.
Draco felt the already sick feeling in his stomach sink into absolute nausea. He had thought that at worst Potter might get a few
“More like- ‘Defence Against the Art of Intelligence!’” Cried Theo, prompting groans from the rest of them for his terrible humour, and a grunt from Crabbe who had, it seemed, enjoyed the lesson.
And so Draco found himself once again watching Potter. He was training hard but didn't seem to be outwardly affected by the pressure of the third task at all. But Draco knew he was feeling many more things then he let people see. He himself was familiar with outward facades. Potter was a little too stony, a little too quick to laugh at jokes- and when he thought no one was looking he often rubbed his eyes with his hands, signalling tiredness.
“No Mother,” he silenced her guilty words with a wave of his hand “I gave you nothing to suggest otherwise. I’m just sorry I didn’t tell you sooner”
“You know I cannot tell you, so stop asking.” Snape hesitated, grunted and then sighed, put his feather back into its holder, then stiffly twined his fingers on the desk in front of himself and straightened. Draco had just watched him go through a moral dilemma.
“Got a problem Malfoy?” Potter walked over to his desk. Malfoy, wary of the challenge, and of the fact that he had none of his friends around to help him, stood so they came face to face.
. He knew if Voldemort had wanted to, he could have searched Draco's mind, but Draco had played the worthless child well and hadn’t been of any interest to the Dark Lord. He felt some of the desperate fear that he had felt leave him.
Blaise looked at Pansy who gestured at him to follow with a grin on her face. He looked to Theo, who just shrugged at him. His confused eyes finally came to rest on Draco who gave him another sly smile. With an eyebrow raised, he turned on his heel and walked out of the great hall.
“That’s bullshit,” Draco said, and Blaise snapped his head up “You have my father's protection, and my father is employing that man. Bad things happen to people who cross my father.”
Flitwick squeaked in surprise “Ah! And you have mastered summing one object from a group of similar objects! Fantastic, Mr Malfoy, that will be a further twenty points to Slytherin!”
Potter, who had friends he could lean upon and talk to in these terrible times, who actually had something worth fighting for.
Blase cleared his throat “Ah, well, we should jog back… it’ll- ahm- keep us warm.” They jogged back in silence.
“I can’t,” Draco gave Borgin a look which rightly inspired some fear in the eyes of the piggish man. “It’s got to stay put. I just need you to tell me how to do it.”
Draco used it that night and got the best night's sleep in months, as his dreams weren’t full of his Father beating him, or beating his mother while he watched.
“What” Draco snapped at Theo, scared he had been caught staring. Theo had a disapproving look on his face, which didn’t help with Draco’s fear. He rolled his eyes “I can practically hear the scheming you’re doing.... It’s written all over your face.” Theo broke his disapproving look with a large grin “Don’t you ever get tired of it?”
“Mixing implements and knives are there-” he pointed at the cupboard, “- and the ingredients are where I just came from.” He glanced up at the chalkboard, seeing that it was blank. “It’s not on the board yet, but today we are making the Draught of-”
They began to walk to the gryffindor carriage, Draco remembering last minute that he usually sauntered. He completed the look by once again put a smirk on his face as they entered the carriage. He found himself looking to Harry’s face which was just as tired looking as in the papers, and then to his lips, wandering if they too were as soft as they looked.
Blaise stepped forward and shook her hand, then subtly wiped his hand on his robes. “I believe you were once a Slytherin, Professor?” Draco asked.
Draco looked around for any signs of the invisible horses, when the Patil twin screamed “I think I felt something, I think it’s near me!”
“Draco!” He had no idea how long he had been standing there. He looked around. The train had already started to move. In the carriage door was Pansy, she had been the one to call his name.
Draco paused, “Oh.” He had gotten so used to using wordless that he had forgotten it was uncommon for wizards his age. “Yeah- I ah, taught myself.” He cleared his throat again. “Anyway- measure out 2 ounces of lavender oil, and 6 ounces of moonstone powder”
The darkness reached out, and crumbled his defences. Draco cried out as the walls he had placed his faith in turned to smoke. There was a feeling of amusement as the Dark Lord considered him. Draco knew he saw the cowering boy, but he took no pity. Draco could now feel what Voldemort felt. There were no walls between them now. He felt…
Everything had changed. There was no way Draco could leave now.  His mother was in danger. There was no safety, there was no hiding. They could only put their heads down and pray they wouldn’t be noticed.
He knew where his Mother was hidden- the empty charms classroom- and he was sure she would be safe. So he had a little time. He kicked his feet at some rubble that blocked his path, and the scattering of the rocks created loud echoes that bounced off the stone walls.
Blaise looked perplexed and at Draco’s deepening frown Blaise rushed to explain “Just that my Mom’s living at your house at the moment, and in the holidays I will be too-”
He stepped forward to inspect it, running his hands over the smooth mahogany wood, which was such a dark brown it looked black. He could feel the low buzz of magic emanating off it. This was the one.
Draco turned around, his lips lifting and his eyes going straight to Potter who looked like he was about to vomit up some slugs.
After giving Crabbe and Goyle their presents- massive boxes of their favourite chocolates and other treats, as well as some Zonko’s tricks, he walked over to Pansy.
- to fight back... To end him.” He looked up and found Theo and Blaise’s eyes, seeing in there the same hope Draco felt and the shared recall of a conversation they had had long ago… about hating the position they found themselves in. About being brothers in their struggle.
She stood up and walked over to him, her movements graceful and confident. Draco felt a shiver run through him, his hairs raised. He was on edge.
I live in Australia and go to university and I'm four weeks in and the work has been piling up :))))
They had waited for so long- the hour had stretched on for an eternity- but eventually, the Potter boy came. He had walked rather calmly into the clearing, peaceful in the face of death.
You have read the journey of my first fanfiction, you have seen me begin to understand character development, understand teasing out the plot- seen the absolute clusterfuck that was me figuring it all out by myself. So thanks for sticking around- (I see all you bookmarker and subsriptions!)
Soon enough they reached the halfway point, which was the top of a hill which overlooked the property. Sitting down upon the old body of a fallen tree, with his breath coming out in a steamy puff of cloud, Blaise asked the usual question.
Only once he looked impeccable did he leave his cottage, dropping his medical bag at his empty practice before crossing the road, almost eager for the warmth of the inn.
Innes had got it in the neck though, doors slammed in his face and one old man had actually ‘spilled’ coffee all down Innes's front as he’d poured it for him.
When Harry finally pressed his cock – rock hard and red with need – inside, it was Draco who keened, high and frantic, scrabbling at his shoulders to grip him tight as his hips starting to roll.
“If only.” Potter looked quite drained, actually. “The only person we’re yet to speak to is you, and if you haven’t seen him, then we’re really screwed.”
“If you like.” Draco ignored the way his heart skipped a few beats at the possibility of more time with Potter. They both ignored the scoff from the bar as Potter beat Draco to the till to pay.
Harry groused to himself, as the wind blew him back down the village road towards the warm lights of the pub.
“You intend to come back to Adharmuir with me, then?” Draco asked Harry, keeping his tone casual and hiding his smile behind his champagne glass.
! Stop having sex with Malfoy! Macgregor, stop getting on Potter’s case about having sex with Malfoy.”
“Well, she’s not. She pretends she is, but she’s miserable. She’s humiliated. And lonely. And permanently drunk, if the state of her fire calls are anything to go by.”
“No, you weren’t,” Draco agreed pointedly, making a show of deliberately stepping around him to resume his trek back to the practice with his medical gear.
They moved together slowly at first, but Harry picked up speed fast, apparently not interested in slow or steady, not that Draco was complaining.
Harry and Innes were outside moments later, with Harry rushing to take the side of the street that contained Malfoy’s medical practice before Innes could cross the road.
His reaction startled Harry – it didn't feel good to see shock and a tinge of fear in Draco's eyes as he looked at him.
“Draco and his mother were cleared of all charges. Narcissa Malfoy is the reason I’m alive,” he said loudly, directly into Innes’s ear, clenching onto his forearm all the tighter.
“You’ve got issues, Potter,” Draco snapped at him, when Potter almost walked smack into him for the third time today.
jump out of their skin and maybe scream a little bit if they went out the front door of their business and ran smack into Potter? Yes, he was rushing, but Una McIntosh had just fire-called to say her man Darragh had almost been dragged into the sea by a hippocampus, and was left with a nasty bite.
When Draco tapped at the other Auror’s door in the inn, a few minutes later, he was admitted with a grunt and a heavy scowl.
Draco spent most of the rest of the day in his garden – it hadn’t been ‘cool’ to enjoy Herbology back at school, and he’d regretted not paying more attention. Atrix Campbell, who ran the apothecary for his grandparents now they were getting on in years, couldn’t always get the supplies Draco needed, so he had to grow a lot of the rarer herbs and plants himself.
Then the girl took the opportunity to half climb up Draco’s torso. “Are you staying for the tea party after all, Draco?”
Once Yaxley was bound and motionless, infuriating smirk frozen on his face, Harry summoned his patronus. Happiness was hard to come by, but the recall of feeling of Draco’s lips against his proved to be enough that he could send his stag galloping off to Gawain.
“I’m a Healer. I took an oath too, to preserve life, if I am able. If Innes is in trouble, or you get into trouble...”
“You’ve got several weeks of bereavement left,” Dawlish reminded him gently. “You don’t need to be here, so don’t be here. But before you go, I’ve got something for you.”
But as he’d looked at Malfoy, his face illuminated by the dusk light, the wind ruffling his long hair… once wouldn’t feel like enough, and that very simple knowledge scared Harry a little.
“You distract yourself by pushing your mind and your body to capacity, throw yourself into focusing on others,” Potter nodded along like he understood, as they wandered through Draco’s little front gate and up the front path.
“I haven’t seen him, but I figured out yesterday where he is. A hippocampus lair. Let me show you the way.”
“That’s in case I don’t come back,” he mumbled against Draco’s lips, when he finally found the strength to pull back enough to explain himself.
“You’re gallivanting off with a Death Eater! Excuse me if I’m a little concerned about the safety of my idiot of a protege!”
Eileen brought Potter another glass of whatever he was drinking, and Potter ordered seared scallops in burnt butter sauce, then shot his drink back in one.
“And now we’re all just being towed along in the traumatic aftermath of our teenage years like the lucky boys we are.” Draco toasted him with his glass, and Potter actually smiled.
“Absolutely nothing else,” Draco agreed. “Just don’t take too long to find him. This isn’t an invitation to bloody move here.”
? Just go in, ask the questions, same as all the other house-calls. But Malfoy wasn’t the same as all the other villagers. Harry couldn’t just treat him the same as all the other villagers, there was too much... history, too much familiarity, too much resentment, too much emotion. Harry didn’t feel the same about him, that was for sure, if his thumping heartbeat was anything to go by.
Canvassing was more straight-forward after that. Not one single person had ever laid eyes on Yaxley, or any other stranger recently, except for Harry and Innes.
for him, just… checking – about an hour ago, and had been sipping away at his cider at the bar with only Alasdair’s taciturn grunts for company ever since.
Tapping at the door roused him after a little while – it was the innkeeper’s wife, Eileen, with his tea and toast.
“Do you want to have a drink with me tonight?” Potter repeated, all cocked head and stupidly tentative expression. The salt-and-ice wind off the sea ruffled at his hair and his equally dark robes.
The notes Harry was trying to read were basic, just what information was known on Yaxley – description, last sightings, criminal history. Harry checked over it all slowly but perfunctorily – the past didn’t matter to him these days, but it was always good to keep a firm picture of the target in mind. What was confusing him was that there was no information on the informant – whoever it was that had allegedly seen and positively identified Yaxley, then reported him to the Ministry, they were anonymous.
He was still trying to mull through his foggy head and ghostly feel of Draco’s lips still on his, when he slid back into the pub. It felt like walking into a wall of warmth, the air heavy with heat from the fire. He made a beeline for the bar to get another drink, then took it upstairs.
“Don’t be ridiculous, darling, of course you are,” Narcissa cut him off, as she raised her glass in a toast.
“Why’d you become a Healer?” Potter decided he wanted to know, as they walked into the wind, heading down the lane towards the water.
Sighing, Draco wandered into his bathroom and ran the bath. Summoning the wine bottle from downstairs, he had it pour a refill into his glass all on its own as he yanked his robes over his head, and sank into the warm water.
“Not just me; she wanted to protect you too. She wanted you to defeat him. She wanted to give you a chance,” Draco told him.
Draco nodded to a few of the patrons and forced himself to compose his features as he sat down opposite Potter. He refused to feel out of place in his own local or, Merlin forbid,
They traded a bit more small talk about what they and their respective friends have been up to since Hogwarts; Draco told Potter about Blaise’s modelling work, and how Pansy writes a gossip column for
His mind drifted back to Potter, even as his body relaxed, which annoyed him. They hadn’t clapped eyes on each other since Draco’s trial, when he’d been seated before the Wizengamot, trying desperately not to let anyone see how badly he was shaking. Potter had come bursting into the closed chamber with Granger at his heels, and had damn near caused a riot, shouting that Draco was to be cleared immediately. Draco hadn’t had a chance to talk to him. Instead, he had been hustled off back to Azkaban, but Potter had met his eyes as the guards had hauled him from the room.
The village of Senaide was as nondescript as France could achieve; their safehouse wasn’t as grand as Narcissa was used to, and she wouldn’t stop letting Draco know it.
When Harry eventually managed to go back to the Ministry, he purposefully got to the office early in order to avoid too many stares. Or worse, condolences.
“Who called in the sighting?” he asked Innes again. “Do we not know? Gawain didn’t say, and it’s not mentioned in the report. But there’s no way we’ve been sent here if it’s not from a legitimate source.”
“It’s sick, and wrong,” he carried on. “Preservation through elimination was way too far... The atrocities committed, the lives of innocent people blatantly discarded as being worthless, simply due to ancestry... what would he have done if you weren’t
Sighing, Harry flagged down the waitress to order him and his partner some food, and Innes finally deigned to join him as she departed for the kitchen.
The next few days were a blur; Harry mostly spent his time being fussed over by Hermione in his London flat (he’d sold the Grimmauld Place house years ago, not needing the space or wanting the memories). She nagged him to eat, nagged him to bathe, nagged him to sleep, nagged him to get outside for a walk in the fresh autumn air and weak sunlight.
“Yaxley,” he snarled, wand pointed at the Death Eater’s throat as he moved into a dueling stance, ignoring the strangled pitch of his own voice. “Stand. Or surrender.”
“Neat, boy,” Innes scowled back at Harry over his shoulder. “Ye’ da wasn’t around to teach it to you, so I’ll teach it to you. You drink scotch
Innes was waiting for him, scowling over the rim of his whiskey glass, camped out on Harry’s armchair.
So, Draco had gone racing downstairs and out into the street, only to collide with ruddy Potter’s ridiculously muscular chest. Again!
Harry sighed as he shouldered his bag and led the way to the other end of the office, grabbed a handful of floo powder from the table by the damn fireplace, and climbed into it. You didn’t argue with Gawain, not even when the man was in a good mood. Harry shot his boss one last insolent scowl for good measure, then called out the name of the village inn that was his intended destination, gripping his bag tightly as the flames flared around him.
! Get your arses around the island tomorrow, and fucking track Yaxley, or else I’ll pull you both off this case and send in Weasley and Dawlish!”
Innes stared out over the grey ocean, shielding his eyes against the glare of the sun. “He’s not here on the island. He’s not on Mull. All I can think is that
The night air was a shock to the system after the stuffy heat of the pub, but Draco always rather enjoyed the way the icy wind billowed down the lane. Tonight, it cooled the heat from his face and the sweat from his palms. It didn't alleviate his rapid pulse, however.
“I don’t know,” Harry told him helplessly. “It really doesn’t look like there’s any trace of him, does it?”
Harry sighed and waved him out of the room. It was late now, and dark. From this high up he could see both up and down the street. Some of the cottages were lit up inside, while others were dark with absence.
As the rest of the people in the room slowly went back to low, muttered conversation, the couple who had stood to protect Draco went slowly back to their seats. The girl stayed where she was, eyeing Harry suspiciously as he drew nearer.
Innes nodded curtly. “He surprised us. It was chase after him, or protect the lad. I have to report to my superior. Help him, please. But don’t Floo him anywhere unless you want him to throw up, even unconscious. He hates Floo.”
With that, and not wanting to be around Innes anymore, Harry took himself up to his room, ordering tea and toast on his way.
“So you didn’t take a wrong turn for once?!” Innes roared, clapping Harry about the shoulder good naturedly and sending more black soot onto the flagstones at their feet. “Not like last time when you went shooting out into that old Muggle woman’s living room, two doors down from the mark!”
Harry laid it down carefully on his coffee-table, downed his drink in one mouthful, and finally cried.
A man’s head in the fire-place turned in his direction, his brow creased in concern and confusion, but Potter’s partner didn’t look surprised in the slightest.
“But there isn’t time for that,” Harry’s partner Innes MacGregor interjected, slowly, as if Harry was daft. “Do you want an apparition point then, lad? Or a portkey?”
“No, of course not. Just curious.” He poured tea through the strainer and into his teacup, feigning nonchalance.
“We’re not engaged, Mother,” Draco pointed out, though he accepted the glass of champagne she was offering him all the same.
He poured himself a large glass of the wine and leaned against his white marble kitchen counter to take the first fortifying gulp. As if the day hadn’t been long and draining enough as it were…
By the time Harry was back in the centre of the village to meet his partner, he was stuffed to the brim with baked goods that had been offered by most of the village-folk. It seemed to be the way of things – he was invited in almost everywhere he called on, and was promptly sat down and plied with coffee, tea, cakes, biscuits, slice… He’d polished off three of Mrs. Campbell’s fresh scones with jam and cream despite her, too, never having any recollection of seeing Yaxley.
Harry couldn’t look up from his mentor, and Draco’s words dropped into his ears like rain, ineffectual and cold.
, he thinks, but doesn’t say. He also doesn’t let on to the fact that he hasn’t actually heard from either of them, or any other of his ‘friends’, in almost a year. Not that he'd told anyone from his past that he was back in the UK, not even Gregory. He didn’t need friends, didn’t miss them, didn’t want them to visit, Merlin forbid. Besides, this village was his, his sanctuary, his place of rest and peace, where he didn’t have to put on airs or pretend. He didn’t want them to wreck it all and bring back the old Draco Malfoy to the fore. He was so far down the path of freedom, so close to happiness and self-acceptance. He could handle the loneliness if it meant preservation of his tentative peace.
