“So what happened?” she asks quietly.
“To become a solicitor, Draco needs to complete a training contract with a law firm,” Andromeda explains. “Gringotts has a Muggle front, too, and has the added benefit of training him in Wizarding law.”
Harry frowns. “It’s fine, I can tell her later then...Thank you for your help.”
Meanwhile, Draco decides to research magical bonds, in particular, loyalty bonds. When magical Lords and Ladies were prevalent in the feudal past, families and mages would be aligned under a particular Family Head. The relationship between the Head and the vassals would be magically codified in loyalty bonds. These bonds allowed the Head to draw on the magic of their vassals, but in turn, the Head had the responsibility to protect their vassals.
He flies through Hogwarts, out of the great doors, over the gardens, through the gate. A quick check to see no one is watching, and then Draco leaps into the air and transforms in one fluid motion.
Nolan quickly glares at Potter before putting glazed parsnips and carrots on his plate.
“Forget them,” a Hufflepuff says. “Look, the Hufflepuff part still looks alright! Why can’t we go and check?!”
Harry relaxed when it was clear that everyone enjoyed the food. Draco then took the second course out.
“Malfoy donated to some charities for me. It sounds like an excuse, doesn’t it?” Harry sighs. “Hermione...look, I know that maybe you don’t like his reasons, but the actions still hold, don’t they?”
“You’re not too bad indeed,” Hagrid says, stroking his unkept beard.
Draco became rebellious, and gave his mum a hug. “Can I visit every week?” he asked, face pressed into his mum’s shoulder.
Harry’s cheeks grow hot. “Okay, we are
the one demonised,” she adds bitterly.
Draco broke down that morning. It just all came crashing down on him. How little he had. How little care there was left for him in the world. He could floo his friends...but he was just a distraction in their busy lives. He could talk to his colleagues, but they were never close enough for that kind of non professional relationship.
“You’re hurt.” Draco glares at the cut in Jamie’s left sleeve. “Arm,

Harry swallows down a laugh, and gets a glare from Malfoy.

Harry looked down a little. “You’re not as cold as you like to think you are.”
“It’s late, I’m going back to Slytherin now.”
” Harry cried as he came all over the bed beneath him. His hole automatically clamped down.
Garren’s face freezes. “How considerate. Class, back to work!”
: 🥰🥰🥰 *lips curve up with happiness, eyes blissful*
“We’re not telling you!” Jamie says loudly.
Especially when Dumbledore testifies for you in his will. Especially when Harry Potter asks for leniency on your behalf…
Madam Pomfrey brows pull together. “
Harry shivers slightly as Draco’s magic rises strongly. An entire swathe of stones is moved in one go.
They’ve even caught the Slytherins’ new “game” of saying to each other,

in Britain lost something. Friends. Family. Your own body, your futures,” Draco says. “On both sides. Losing you two...I will not accept it.” He gives them both a head ruffle.
“Yes. From Aegis. These items are confiscated.”
McGonagall nods. “Well, as you may know, Hogwarts is now officially independent. Because of this, you can now officially step down from your post as Head of Slytherin.”
“Of course, professor,” Draco says, and follows McGonagall, leaving his friends behind.
“Now, now,” he says, showing just a hint of sharp teeth. If anything, Mrs Norris
(Mhm, Harry’s getting hard just thinking about it.)
Harry frowns, thinking hard. They must both enjoy the sport of making the
Harry raises his eyebrows. “Really? You didn’t seem to need me around at all.”
“We’re doing that now,” Harry confirmed, and leaned down to kiss him. More than words, their actions showed, and Draco could believe that they finally both understood each other.
: HAHA finally, I don't have to keep a secret from Mr Malfoy!

Potter laughs. “I know.” He shifts and sits down on the bed. Draco allows it.

“Hey, you would marry him too for his cooking skills,” Ron said defensively.
Harry freezes. “What?”
As the main food service ends, the music gets louder and students start contorting their bodies (Draco hesitates to call it ‘dancing’). There’s even the girl Weasley with Luna Lovegood. But no Potter.
“Because that would be a permanent transformation,” Mesa says drily.
In the Great Hall, icy chandeliers grace the ceiling, and the air is filled with sparkles. Multiple decorated fir trees line the sides, and the four long tables have been condensed into two.

He can hear the howl of wolves. There is no scent of Potter.
Harry jumps onto Draco’s staircase step and wraps an arm around Draco. “Save me, Draco! Keep me safe!”
The ground shudders beneath them.
: Wow Harry, didn't expect that sudden segue into your sex life with Draco.
“And yet Malfoy still calls me Potter.” Harry quickly then adds, “Well, I still call him Malfoy, so that’s even.”
“I painted many things,” Harry said happily. “Molly, did you get a haircut?”
“Hmpft!” Robards pushes the Auror into the floo. “Let’s go.”
McGonagall’s Independent Hogwarts declaration makes a huge splash on the front pages of the papers the next day, with her speech printed verbatim. This is combined with articles talking about the timely re-collapse of the rebuilding attempt of Hogwarts by the Ministry team.
“Has the Ministry bothered you over the matter of the transformation in the papers? I have informed the family lawyers. You will only be fined for not registering.” Narcissa’s tone lightens. “The Greengrass family have been in contact again…”
A hand ruffles his hair.
Malfoy frowns at him, and glances back at his menu.
Aside from the Slytherins, Hogwarts is mostly empty during the Winter Break, and Garren is mercifully gone. Nonetheless, Draco and Blaise continue their regular rounds of the floors by the Slytherin Dungeons.
Samhain starts at sunset of October 31st and will last till the sunset of November 1st. There are many different variants of the event, but given that this is the first Samhain after the Battle of Hogwarts, after the civil war the Dark Lord propelled, the Slytherins are sombre.

’s himself up and above them all.
“Wait, where are we going?” Harry says.
, that kind of hatred is more what Harry expects.
Draco knows the stouter of the two with the lighter hair: Auror Hitchly, Draco’s parole Auror.
Draco strikes the damn thing down with a burst of fire.
Pansy replies calmly, “Is there anything wrong with students dueling Draco instead of, say, cute little Alyss?”
Garren snorts and waves his hand in dismissal.
There’s something wrong with the staircases the next morning. They don’t

“Draco!” Narcissa stands up.
Draco’s lips quirk. “You’re my Slytherin. It’s my duty.”
Now that it has been a few weeks since he spoke to his mother, Draco has calmed down. Sometime after his proposal with Harry, they sent polite letters congratulating him. He wouldn’t be surprised if they had initially tried to remove the engagement from the Malfoy Genealogy Book, and that only after failure did they slowly come to terms with the new reality.
But Harry doesn’t give up, he just changes tact. He hangs around Malfoy (it’s
“Well, they forced Malfoy to do it instead. And you know how much Malfoy hates me, so I have to keep on his good side.”
As each Slytherin mentions another property of the robes, a huge sense of responsibility wells up in Draco.
“Two on one, not really fair, but you asked for it,” Draco drawls, looking down on Greyback.
A dark-haired girl glumly nods her head.
Granger raises one eyebrow. “The Houses were set up by the

“Everyone always tells me that
“Work first,” Draco orders them, crossing his arms. “Unless you can confidently tell me that you’ve all finished your assignments for next week already?” He raises an eyebrow, even at the older Slytherins.
“Alright, we will,” Granger says. “We’ll see you tomorrow.”
Potter nudges Nolan. “Are you scared? Malfoy plays with them all the time.”
Draco ignores Potter’s garbled response behind him, picking up his walk to the point that’s a run through quiet Hogwart corridors. He passes a group of laughing Gryffindors who jeer at him, and finds Jamie, Michelle and Pansy.
Harry’s lips quirk up by themselves. “Really, Draco,
Draco raises his hand. “
, cover to cover. There is absolutely no precedent recorded as to what Malfoy purported to do.
going alone,” Pansy immediately says. “I’ll tell your mum if you do.”
Draco stumbles out, unsteady on his feet. He’s focusing his magic down the bond, trying to keep his Slytherin alive.
By the time Harry returned home, he was really tired. He didn’t

” sounds.
: What was that?
“Dark spells against Greyback are much more effective,” Draco says. “Greyback’s constitution means that he is naturally resistant against many spells.”
“You’re so focused on my cock, did you even notice that your big brother Charlie Weasley is watching you?”
The Auror’s face turns bitter. “They’re being questioned downstairs, sir!”
A growl rips through the air. White-hot flame spews to an apparently empty patch of water, setting the water boiling as the wave of heat explodes outwards.
cushioning charms, Harry ran down the street, weaving between surprised street-goers. Behind him, a crowd of enthusiastic citizens and parasitic reporters followed.

Pansy chuckles. That said, she

Harry reaches up and grabs Draco’s hand. “I’m still angry with you, Malfoy. Don’t think that calling me sweet will get you off the hook.”
Ben Taylor scoffs. “
“Yes. How surprising that I like to spend time with you.” Each of Malfoy’s words were even and measured, without a hint of a joke in his tone.
. It takes Harry a while to stop laughing. Then he catches sight of the decorations around the castle, and manages to spit out a, “
“Stupid! Of course, taking out the bottom floors would lead to the building collapsing! Why did they do all that? It would have been easier to just expel all the Slytherin students!”
“Harry Potter’s here?”
“Did the Slytherins’—” Ron starts.
Harry beamed. “It’s pretty neat, isn’t it? It’s nice to know that children across the world can enjoy the same story and the same pictures. I bet you can read many of those languages.”
Harry’s frown deepens.

The four of them head up the stairs of Hogwarts to McGonagall’s office. Draco enters the floo first, to open the connection to Malfoy Manor.

Draco offers him his handkerchief. “I could light a fire,” he says. “Conduct a small Samhain ritual.”
Harry gives his hand to Draco [in marriage!]. Ah, no it's just giving Draco his magic...
Some of the students notice the arrival of the three Slytherins.
Harry could feel it. That hot, hardness of Draco through the two layers of clothes.
“Auror Pyne, take those two to the side room for questioning immediately.”
“Then I would say the same to you. Doesn’t that make you a teen parent?” Harry bursts out laughing, not stopping even when Draco jabs him in the arm. “It might be that when summer comes, some of them might want to go with you.”
“Aren't you going to eat?” he asked, sometime during the dinner.
Draco inwardly rolls his eyes. “The thestrals are good, proper, wizarding creatures.”
and creepily underwater.”
Nolan scoffs.
,” Harry says, a grin on his face. “I should try flying inside some time.”
Hermione casts until she can’t cast anymore. Zabini’s method seems to work. When the house-elf comes to call them to eat, Hermione lets out a huge tired sigh, scanning the area for Harry. She knows that Harry and Malfoy went off together a while ago.
, Draco explains to himself. He gives Nolan one last pat.
Right then, someone else knocks at the door.
One of the Hufflepuff boys huffs pointedly. “Just give up, Laurel. I want my turn.”
Draco raises his head and shoulders , pulling away from the kiss. “Harry…” His voice is raspy and low.
: *receives an arrow through the heart*
Harry’s heart leaps to his throat, turning slowly to Hermione. It’s past midnight, and he didn’t expect anyone to still be up. With the invisibility cloak in one hand and the map in the other, he knows full well how incriminating his looks.
“State your purpose,” Ralak orders.
received the broken back and the broken limbs.”
“So, Malfoy, would you like to go out for lunch?” Harry tries again. “I know this place in Muggle London, it’s good, I think you’ll like it.”
Harry pants, chest heaving. Draco’s fucking is slow, slower. As though he’s trying to push out the last of Harry’s orgasm, as though he’s trying to push his come as deep as he can inside of Harry. Harry’s mind hazy. He reaches out for Draco, a little aimlessly, wraps his legs around Draco’s hips to keep that cock inside.
Harry blinks innocently. “Malfoy?” He gives them a wave. “I’ll collect my things and be off now!”
” Gardiner tries, wand jabbing and sharp.
Draco inhales a lungful of Potter’s scent. Less smelly-Gryffindor-boy this morning, thank Merlin.
“Enough talking, next duel!” the Hufflepuff boy shouts.

Draco serves himself sausages and eggs instead of his usual morning pastry. He can hear the susurration of whispers about the

“Now shh.” Draco casts a disillusion charm around the both of them. The Professors have set up temporary safety barriers around the ruins, but no one is on watch.
Draco whispered, “It’s foreplay.”
Harry internally groans. “Ah, um, I wanted to make you something for Valentine’s Day, so I baked this chocolate apple cake…”
Blaise smirks and lifts his chin.
Aster turns to Mesa. “Isn’t there a muggle tradition of throwing cold water on people to wake them up?”
Harry squeezes his eyes shut. He opens them again. “Still there,” he mutters. “Wait, this isn’t the first step in pureblood courting rituals… Or even the second….Don’t know about the rest, I didn’t read that far…”

“Draco…”
“Merlin, Malfoy!” Harry tilts his head back, and shrugs nonchalantly. “I didn’t even know you worked here until like, right now. Don’t you think, as
Draco raises an eyebrow. “It’s clearly not nothing. Do you dislike Mr Potter that much?”
“Understood,” Draco says, nonchalantly smoothing his robes.
“Take a set of warm robes,” Draco reminds him. “It’s colder outside the Dungeons.”
“What are you doing here?” Draco says coldly.
Draco whips back. “
A tinkling of sound fills the air, as Minister Kingsley Shacklebolt calls attention for the round of obligatory talks. When it’s Harry’s turn, there’s no need for Harry to search for Draco in the crowd of faces. Draco simply twirls his fingers a little, and Harry will
Greyback startles, slowing his advance.

“You call all the Slytherins by their given names!”
“Firstly, how did you take the Sorting Hat?”
Hermione immediately whips her head around, her expression becoming complicated.
“...If you have time to spare, go check the access,” Draco returns.
. Draco’s lips twitch. He feeds it more magic to placate it.
McGonagall looks down on Hitchly. “Did I not say that you’re not allowed to call Mr Malfoy in for questioning?”
if you don’t come to class!” Coates shouts.
Pomfrey doesn’t budge, and worse, Flitwick agrees with her.
Sequoia starts to gag. “Too much, I can’t, let me vomit—”
“Come with me, Harry,” Blaise says.
Draco still doesn’t let go of Harry.
Alice smiles politely. “I don’t know what you’re talking about. Since you’re back, Harry Potter gave us some extra chocolate to hand out to those who weren’t here during the Winter Break.”
Draco meets his mother’s eyes, and they silently head to the master bedroom. McGonagall follows them.
Other small modifications appear overnight, like wide window seats, and a previously designated classroom magically turns into a student lounge room.
Harry’s gears are

Greyback narrows his eyes, even as breath starts leaving him.

“You’re going to give your speech tonight,” Draco says. “You’re going to look the audience in the eye and smile. The War is over, Harry. Its effects are not, but you’ve done such good work, Harry. You should be proud.”
Harry rolls his eyes. “Yes, mum.”
. Draco focuses back on Potter. “We’re heading out to the Forbidden Forest—”
Draco’s expression cools. “Granger and Weasley are waiting outside the Slytherin entrance. Do you want me to send them away?”
McGonagall’s lips thin. She absolutely does not want to cooperate in this farce.
Harry’s knees weaken.
Harry would not be standing if it weren’t for Draco’s support. He has known that this will happen for a while now, but
Potter frowns. “I don’t know if it makes me feel better. Maybe most of the Slytherins didn’t fight for Hogwarts. Or didn’t fight at all. But that’s not all your fault, is it? McGonagall forced you all to go back to the Dungeons.” He sighs heavily. “Would it kill people to be

Harry let out a loud cry of pleasure as sensation overcame him. Heat spread from Draco’s cock, come exploded out from his own cock, painting his chest in white. “Draco!”
Behind him, Pansy smirks. “Nolan, Sequoia, give Mr. Malfoy some privacy.”
damn it Draco hadn’t smelt him through the thick scent of fresh meat—step into the clearing.
” Hagrid’s voice pricks Draco’s ears.
“Since you’re new, I’ll let you go first,” Jamie says with utmost seriousness.
“Now off you go, and don’t come back,” Malfoy says.
“Aegis are muggle like,” Draco says coolly. “Those soul orbs contain muggle components.”
Malfoy casts a spell that turns half of the miniature Hogwarts invisible, showing the staircases and…

that shakes the earth. The base is completely ruined, but the rest of it remains together, leaning.
Malfoy grimaces. “Then give me a moment.” His wand draws shapes, trails of gold and white. The fingers of his other hand pick apart the strands that come loose. And Malfoy’s face is deep in concentration, those silver-grey eyes sharp and focused.
Narcissa reads the entire article once, then twice, narrowing her eyes at the photo provided. She is sure that they are not holding hands, but that the angle has created this lie. She knows that her son has been working in tandem with Potter over the matter of Slytherin and Hogwarts, even though Potter should have stayed in Gryffindor where he belongs.
Nolan slumps back on his seat with a sigh of relief. Someone starts clapping, leading the wave of applause.
Letters and business documents are arranged neatly on the desk. One of the Aurors pulls out a fresh sheet of parchment, and by cross-referencing Lucius Malfoy’s handwriting, starts to write a letter.
“Well, it was summer in Australia—” Hermione starts.
, he tells it lightly.
, look, is that Potter?”
“You can’t do anything to him, Draco!” Harry’s brows draw together in distress. “If you do, the Ministry will definitely capture you! We...we should report this to McGonagall. She can handle it.” Harry’s eyes narrow. “I mean it, Draco! If the Aurors take you away, then what would happen to Slytherin?”
“No, sit down,” Draco said, gently pushing Harry onto his chair.
The others give their farewells, and Harry hops off the bench and heads over to Draco’s side.
Ron sighs and reaches for the newspaper. Harry quickly tucks it into his side.
Nolan pouts unhappily. “I had the idea first!”

Potter looks uneasy. “Yeah…”
Harry concedes.
*carefully taking notes of how the younger Slytherins get head pats: listening to Draco. Not listening to Draco. Acting spoiled. Pleading eyes*
Draco lets him pretend otherwise. They have a long time together, after all. Draco will convince Harry eventually.
Darkness descends. Draco carefully picks out the different noises in the Hospital Wing. There are quiet footsteps coming closer. He casts a new large

Draco resizes the Slytherin Banner from its small portable size to its proper size. He goes up the stage and levitates the Slytherin banner back into place.
“Mr. Malfoy, let’s go,” Madam Pomfrey says.
Harry’s ear-tips go red. “Stuck up prat,” he grumbles. He lifts his head a little, and his gaze falls upon the downed Gryffindors. “Draco...what happened?”
Ron choked. “You mean Draco Malfoy?!”

“Sticky. Like this...your come will—”

Draco’s gaze turns cold, as a sense of fierce
But their enemies are getting smarter. Draco is left scrambling to keep up and protect his Slytherins.
“Don’t mind me, I won’t die overnight,” Draco says. “If I do, you can have everything.” He lowers his voice, adding only for Pansy, “If we had those communication devices, this wouldn’t be a problem.”
“Well, we all know where Aegis likely was,” Draco says drily.
Pansy laughs. “Well, I’m going back to bed. You two can do whatever you want.” She heads into Slytherin first, and closes the entrance behind her, leaving Harry and Draco standing outside in the dim light of predawn.
Harry squeaked when Draco suddenly pushed his legs apart again. “You’ve already watched him getting fucked.”
,” Ron adds.
Harry ushers everyone else into the old Slytherin Head Boy chambers. Everyone takes a seat on the sofas and chairs set around a central table while Blaise gives his report.
“Nnnnnngg…” Harry moans. His hips make tiny motions, inviting Draco’s fingers in. Offering himself up to Draco. Draco pushes a third finger in.
After it sends off the last student, the lift comes down again and Draco and Harry enter.

“Look how
Draco doesn’t bother to argue with them. He simply defeats them and continues on the inspection with Blaise.
The Slytherin Dungeons is very, very different from what Harry remembers.
Granger glares at him. She takes a deep breath, and says in a forced, even tone, “Then we need to practice control, Harry. Come, I can find some books for you.”
Malfoy has a faint smile. “Indeed.”
“It is a waste of time,” Michelle Nguyen says. She’s clearly thought about these words and delivers them smoothly to Draco.
Harry’s expression darkens. “I see.”
“Oh, go to bed!” Draco told them. “Isn’t it past your bedtime?” He squabbled with the teenagers, damn kids.
“You were a kid.”

In the dark Forest, this small clearing is bubbling with activity. Draco entertains the young thestrals and the more playful werewolf students with conjured jumping obstacles; Harry attempts to play fetch-the-stick with Nolan (who soon returns with a huge branch and attempts to poke Harry with it). Some other students lie in the nest, while some stretch their limbs in the surrounding Forest.

Suddenly, a different kind of pain strikes across his side, from a spell that didn’t land on him.
But it’s odd playing with Ron and Hermione instead of the little second years. Not to mention the gazes of the other Gryffindors, half unwelcoming, half assessing.
“Oh yeah, we could make them for the Burrow,” Ron agrees.
Harry cleared his throat. “Um. Malfoy. Sorry about running into you. I bet you want to be on your way.”
“Good Potter,” Draco says, smirking. His hand rises, lifting to pat Potter on the head…

“Mr Malfoy, how is it floating?” Jamie asks, eyes bright.
“Can you bring out some snacks?” Harry asked Draco.
Draco chuckled. “Yes. Yes, you are. And do you know what good boys get?”
Harry rolls his eyes. “I helped!” He grins. “You’re clearly happy when I kiss you.”
There’s a traitorous warmth accompanying Flitwick’s praise. Draco forces it back, his expression and voice taking on a tone of mocking. “Sir, I hope you’re aware that I’m a Death Eater.”
Harry very carefully plucks a white rose too. He sheepishly gives it to Draco to deal with the thorns, but it’s Harry who puts it into Draco’s hair.
“...So if I change my Quidditch team, you’ll cook for me more often?”
All eyes turn to him.
, a certain
Robards rubs his forehead. Not only does he have to deal with the dark items sent in by McGonagall, but he also has to clean up the messes of the other Aurors!
“How can I make you pay? This is my treat. Thank you.”—That last thank you was to the waiter returning his card. Malfoy stood up, and Harry followed him out.
Potter arrives to breakfast a bit after, looking like he’s slept in his robes, and Granger and Weasley come strolling in after him, hand-in-hand.
Nolan pouts. “No way! I’m protecting Slytherin, so it doesn’t count like that!”
Draco took Harry’s hand and placed Harry’s hand on his cock.
Robards’ perpetually grouchy expression doesn’t change when he sees Minerva McGonagall, Poppy Pomfrey, and Harry Potter accompanying Draco Malfoy. It’s as though they don’t trust him to give Draco Malfoy back.
As everyone finds a seat, soft music starts. The chatter quiets as the processions appear.
Draco scoffs. “Stop worrying about them,
Harry laughs and hugs Draco’s scaly neck as Draco climbs up into the air and loop-de-loops and barrel rolls and flies in circles. Seeing the fun, the younger thestrals jump into the air too!
“...And I asked one of the house-elves to help me.”
Harry laughs. “Git, no way, you’re just two months older than me.”
Bartholomew yanks his arm back, expression darkening. “With all due respect, this matter is highly important for British security. We will briefly escort Mr. Malfoy to one of our interrogation offices—”
“What a coincidence,” someone mutters.
Harry turns to Malfoy.
“Yes.”
.” Harry looks away from Malfoy’s face.
Harry is wearing dark robes, buttoned at the waist but otherwise open, revealing a jewel-green knee-length jacket and white trousers. His hair is messy as usual, his green eyes bright behind the black frames.
Zabini goes over and crouches down. “Maira Yang, you must be Shen’s little sister,” he says.
Jamie pouts. “You weren’t gone for that long, and I’ve definitely been good!” He looks at all the snacks that he has eaten already with his friends. “Um, should I ask the house-elves to make more of those chocolate-coffee brownies that you like?”

“I was saying, wouldn’t it be nice if we made a duck pond to raise ducks? Somewhere away from the Giant Squid,” Harry says innocently.
There is Malfoy’s chest that Harry had only been able to catch glimpses of in the Forbidden Forest and in the Hospital Wing... The curve of Malfoy’s muscles aren’t as well defined as Zabini’s, but...
Ushering staff and students away, the Ministry team prepare the foundation, using the pre-existing foundation as the base. As the lower Slytherin floors are no longer wanted, the bottomless level is completely filled in with stone and mortar. They then levitate more blocks to put in the basement floor where the house-elves’ quarters, kitchens, and the potions classrooms will be.
mumbling to himself: I was
Longbottom wakes up a bit more. “Alright, alright. Let me get dressed—”
“Unless you’re scared of losing,” Harry adds.
The adults give him space, but the little thestrals loop in the air—or try to, at least. One of them tumbles, and Draco uses the tip of his snout to nudge it upright. Thestrals, like winged abraxans, were not naturally suited for aerial acrobatics.
The Minister for Magic makes a light sound, calling attention to him. “During the Battle of Hogwarts last year, the Castle suffered damage and was rebuilt with the generous help of Hogwarts staff, volunteers, and the Ministry. The collapse of Hogwarts Castle is a tragic event. However, we can again rebuild the castle, restore our pasts and build for our future. There have been a number of teams who wish to lead the task in rebuilding. Today will be the start of the work by the team from the British Ministry, led by Wizengamot Member Holly Griffiths.”
“I don’t think he

Michelle keeps her mouth shut. Slytherin has been getting cookies from the house-elves for quite a while now… She glances around a bit. Professor O’Conor is on the opposite side of the tent.
All his confidence and joy and smugness about showing Harry off washes away in a sudden chill.

had the audacity to target Harry Potter, leader of the Light.
Malfoy’s hand immediately covers Harry’s, stopping his cutting motions. “Look closely, Potter,” he says. He takes the knife and demonstrates a tiny mince of the ingredients.
“Forgetting what?”
Then, as usual, they head back to Grimmauld Place to relax in the sitting room. Malfoy summons a beast of a book about something complicated about earth magic and its connection to the apparition charm, and so Harry gets a book for himself too. Harry feels settled, though, and much too lazy to read. He finds himself studying Malfoy’s profile: more angular than pointy these days. Those eyes that could center Harry in the world, and those lips so often quirked up in smirk at Harry. Harry dozes off despite himself, and wakes up in bed the next day.

Meanwhile, in another white pavilion, Draco raises an eyebrow when a loud voice calls out.
“It’s hardly even
, he calls out softly.
: *furiously nods his head* Mr Malfoy, COOL!!! Sugoi!! 666666!!
Harry chuckles. “Wasn’t he corrupted by a certain dragon?”
.” Harry prods Draco in the chest. “Remember my careers list? There was absolutely no ‘Wizengamot member’ on the list!”
So Jamie subtly pulls a small packet from his bag and extracts a chocolate coated biscuit—he had made them last night when he went over to chat with the house-elves. Some of the chocolate biscuits have already been given to Mr Malfoy to make him less grumpy and more head-pat-y.
Narcissa stiffens. “No, thank you,” she says coldly. “I trust Pansy.” She turns away first, casting her own spells on Lucius. With a purse of her lips, she lays a hand on Lucius’s forehead. “He needs rest, now. I really appreciate your work, Pansy.”
Blaise pats the stone he has been sitting on for the last week. It’s in fact the core foundation heart stone of Hogwarts, infused equally with magic of all four Founders to the point that which magic is which is literally indistinguishable. It’s where the bulk of Hogwarts’ sentience lingers. Blaise had taken it out from the old Great Hall during the ‘clearing the rubble’ phase, and no one had noticed.
Every single move Harry makes drives Draco to go faster, to fuck his hole, to make him cry. Harry’s cock is red and hot, pressed between their bodies. Harry’s legs tighten around him, pushing him deeper.
McGonagall turns to all the staff and students.  “There are no classes for the rest of today. Tomorrow’s Quidditch Match will continue as scheduled.” If the Quidditch stands have fallen, they’ll be easy to put back up again.

Twas the night before Christmas Eve. Tomorrow and all the way til New Year, Harry and Draco would be busy visiting respective family and friends. It was their last chance for quiet and privacy.
Draco collapses onto the bed next to Harry, breathing heavily.

: ...what is this weird feeling I’m feeling…
“Well,” Weasley says hesitantly, “You know that people won’t listen...”
“Don’t jinx it, Potter!” Nolan scowls.
Sweat beads on Garren’s forehead, his wand movements sharp and messy. His spells are in complete disregard for his environment; a statue fractures, the corner of a portrait frame starts to burn.
“I know that Aegis aren’t holy angels,” Harry says plainly. “Dennis said it’ll take the dark magic out of me.”
“Indeed, I will be the better man and concede that these...trousers, if we must call them, have their uses.” Draco tilted his head back. “I never knew you had such a kink for me in your clothing.”
Harry’s mouth dries, eyes wide as Zabini’s smooth dark skin emerges, glowing under the warm lights. He’s glad that Zabini isn’t looking Harry’s way, but it’s a small mercy.
Blaise joins the group of students playing dares and pouts. “Why does no one what to hug me?”
“Why?” Draco shook his head. “You’re my guest tonight. What would you like to do?”
Draco reaches out and grabs Harry, causing him to topple on top of him. Harry bursts out laughing, and Draco can’t help but laugh too, despite his hardest attempts at keeping a calm and collected face.
“I feel full watching you eat.” Malfoy’s tone was particularly deep, and his eyes indeed looked like he was eating up the image of Harry.
In another world, if it weren’t for Draco, Blaise might have attracted their primary loyalty instead. But there

Draco leaned over and pushed Harry’s head down again.
Rather than speaking anymore, Draco pulls Harry closer and occupies their lips. Harry immediately softens (it’s a pavlovian response, he’s sure), immersing himself in the familiar sensation of Draco’s lips. Their mouths part and their tongues slide across each other. Warmth builds in Harry’s body.
“Indeed. Then I’ll cooperate with you.”
“It is something we can now factor in,” Blaise muses. “In conjunction with your victory over Garren.”
Felicity laughs and turns to Pansy. “Nolan wasn’t like this when Harry wasn’t here.”
“—And with her invitation, obtaining an exemption from the Aurors will be simple,” Narcissa adds. “Do you think of nothing to help your own son?”

The Slytherins head out to dinner in the Great Hall by shifts. Draco dons a half-hearted costume of long cloak with comically large feathers and joins one of those groups.
Malfoy grimaces. “I’ve been
Draco hissed. “Good boy. You want us to come inside of you, don’t you? You want all our come, don’t you?”
But when she looked at that person’s memory, she found the same kind of anonymous letter as those who caused Aster to trip months ago.
“It’s true,” Hermione said. “He’s a consultant with the Minister’s Office, though sometimes he also works with the DMLE.”

Nolan launches forward, tackling the bastards. To his side, Harley immediately joins the fight. They draw wands; fighting in such close quarters, there’s no need to aim, just cast!

Meanwhile, in Harry and Draco’s room, Harry watches as Draco puts on his fancy Slytherin robes with the dragon crest. On Draco’s desk is a letter from McGonagall requesting his presence.
Harry squirms. “Do you have to carry me like this?”
Reluctantly, Longbottom says, “Let’s go.”

Harry happily accepted it. He took off the lid, and his eyes grew round. There were neat little eclairs, each one coated differently with either dark, milk, white, ruby or matcha-milk chocolate. The decorations on top of them were exquisite and delicate.
As the Golden Trio walks away, Pansy loops her arm with Draco’s, and Blaise on her far side.
Coates glares, scoffing. “Don’t be so entitled, I’m not running an extra class for

Hogwarts vibrates a little as it smooths the fit between itself and Slytherin, and then settles.

like a Slytherin? He’s been sitting at the Slytherin table lately. He sleeps in the Slytherin dorms. He plays with the younger Slytherins.
Draco glances at Potter’s schedule, which he has obtained from Felicity, which she obtained from Potter-surveillance. Around him are the other Seventh Years.
“We thank you for your consideration of us,” Blaise says smoothly. “I look forward to being able to hear more of your opinions, Hermione.”
“Oh? Are you sure? I was in fact asking her on your behalf…”
The past year has been...
However, Draco’s eyes narrow. “What’s wrong?”
The only reason his own parents aren’t there is due to their house-arrests.
By the time Draco transforms back, he’s exhausted having played with all the energetic children, both human and thestral. The only upside is that all the magic that the Slytherins gave him has now fully unified with his own partially recovered magic.

The spongy tip pressed against the rim of Harry’s hole, easily sinking in. The entire cock sunk in a slow and gentle glide.

Uncomfortable with that look on Harry’s face, Draco resumes petting again, and Harry’s eyes close.
Draco sniffs. “You haven’t

“Do you think I’m being overly anxious about it all?” Harry says quietly as they walk towards the castle ruins.
“Mr Potter!” Nolan cries.
Many families have come, taking the opportunity to see their children. Now that many students have established cross-House friendships, their parents must politely greet each other, which is especially awkward for those families whose members typically get sorted into one house. However, as it turns out, talking about their children is an easy common conversation topic.
Malfoy flips them two fingers, and some of the goblins

“Sweet dreams.” Draco strokes Nolan absently, as everyone burrows into the blankets, settles down, and falls asleep.
While Garren indeed doesn’t care for the Slytherin students, now that he has been forcefully relieved of that position, his gut feels uncomfortable.

The generic works page for any user is
“Harry, cast some warming charms.”
“I am Professor Flitwick, Head of Ravenclaw,” Flitwick says. He casts a spell on the ground so that he can elevate himself up above others’ heads.
“The Slytherin Head Boy chambers are empty,” Draco says. “Potter can have them.”
But this year, Hogwarts has gone through many upheavels. And this year, Draco is here.
Grudgingly learning from Blaise, Draco finds it easier to skim his fingers across the walls. Magic activates under his fingertips, the colours intertwining and glowing across the wall surface. Is it his imagination, or has the spell patterns visibly frayed in the short time that Draco dueled with those Ravenclaws? Draco’s eyelids lower. It’s as though Howarts has aged...was the Battle the turning point?
Harry rubs one tired eye under his glasses and nods.
Lucius immediately spots his son’s wax seal and takes the letter before Narcissa can reach for it.
Meanwhile, Madam Pince acquires dozens of books on architecture and design, leading to the biggest boom in non-classwork related reading she has ever seen.

Draco Malfoy gives her an empty look. He jumps, lightly landing on the stage. The moment his feet touch the wood, the four house banners appear, unrolling across the front wall—the ones that should only appear at the end of the year at the conclusion of the House cup.
Potter backs away. “Because. Because…”
“Careful, there are children watching,” Draco looks pointedly at Potter, Lovegood, and Ginevra.

“So it’s Malfoy,” Neville says.

Back at the thestrals’ glen, the younger thestrals fold bony legs, wings spread out, to rest in exhaustion. Draco lands and transforms back, taking a moment to resettle into a much smaller, more vulnerable frame.

“Wait, when did you start?”
Blaise and Pansy then have to leave briefly to escort the younger Slytherins from class.
Draco bites back a laugh. “Potter, how much older are you?”
The Hufflepuff students also watch curiously.
That mollifies the goblins, who let him pass, just as Draco emerges. Harry’s face splits into a wide grin. Harry does a little awkward run up to greet him.
“Really?” Potter finally looks at the tables of food. “And you celebrate Christmas too?”
Pansy pouts. “You’re just afraid that
If he goes to the Forest, he’ll be even further away from his Slytherins. They’re more important. Draco ruthlessly squashes the flame in his stomach, squishing into a tiny inferno and wrapping the dragon around it.

In the dining tent, where breakfast is being set up, Hagrid walks in, heading straight for the rather haggard McGonagall, his eyes sparkling.
Owls, firecalls, and visitors flood the Ministry wanting clarification, and press releases being given by Ministry officials quickly get inundated by questions that can’t, or don’t want, to answer.
“That’s still—they should be protecting everyone
hahahaha!
Draco’s eyes widen. The dragon in his chest stretches luxuriously. He slowly smirks. “I see.”
“Before we can retaliate, we need to ensure our own safety. If you retaliate in the dark, you must be sure that you will not be found, and that no one around you is implicated, and you must be ready to face
Harry began to grow lightheaded, unable to figure out how to breath through his nose. HIs breath turned into pants, and at last, Draco broke the kiss.
“Shall I tell you the story of the dragon and his prince?”
Malfoy ends up helping Harry replace wallpaper in the front door landing and promising to go on a day trip to find new rugs and carpet. But Harry can no longer bring himself to open his bedroom door, not even to retrieve his clothes—which are all still in his school trunk in the bedroom. Instead, he sleeps on the couch, which is where Ginny and Luna find him rather too early the next day. When they ask what’s wrong, he blurts out, “
Potter grunts, but then lapses into silence again.
“We would appreciate it if you kept an eye out for them,” Draco says.
“Yeah, have you been able to sleep well in the snakes’ den?” Ron says.
Harry stiffens when Malfoy takes a step closer, a smirk growing on his face.
“Hush, Nolan,” Draco says pointedly.
Harry secretly sighed in relief in his heart as the conversation moved away from trying to get him out to a public wizarding place again…
(;￣ー￣川  … No, no, you are fine…

Eventually, the number of diagnostic spells goes down and the panel and the Unspeakable gather together to discuss their results.
“Oh, you’ve earned a delay...for now,” Draco says.
“Do you want to help as well?” Blaise asks.
“Shut the fuck up!” Draco growls. He throws a ball of fire behind him towards the annoying voice, uncaring of where it lands.
The Gryffindor team are sullen as they march into the Hospital Wing for Pomfrey to do an after-match check-up on them, glaring at Draco and the Slytherin team who are drifting over to him.

“So...sorry.”
“I’m quite sure Muggles’ eyes aren’t this big,” Draco said, summoning the bowl of popcorn right out of Harry’s hands.
“The best way to recover and settle your magic is to sleep. But first...you need to tell me what happened.”
Harry’s mouth opens, as though he wants to say something, but then his lips twist into a defeated expression.
“Have you all

Draco deigns to pat its head. “I need to speak to your leader first.”
The Hufflepuff smiles. “That’s right, we’re nice Hufflepuffs. Go on, head back to your Dungeons.”
Various Gryffindors are lazing around the common room. They all look at Harry with complicated eyes. A student who Harry recognises from the morning after the full moon looks away.
Harry sits nervously on the bed.
The night of the full moon is Thursday, December 3rd. After making sure Potter is safely under Blaise’s eye, Draco leaves with Slytherin werewolf students.
Malfoy’s favourite colour may be emerald green, but it’s not the colour that flatters him the most.
“...The plate that you just put food on?”
Garren’s jaw tightens, eyes flickering to the weary third years. “Of course. Mind you two
Draco reaches out and pats both Harry and Nolan on the head. “Yes, yes. Now, why don’t we give the thestrals some food for helping us?”
dragon, Draco would be like a werewolf. Tainted blood. Less than human. Unreliable and dangerous. No family would want to marry their daughter to him.
Harry whines. He wraps himself up with the duvet, and ignores it when Draco pokes at the small part of his head that’s sticking out. Then, the air noticeably warms to the point that being inside the rolled duvet is starting to feel hot.
Harry frowns slightly. He doesn’t know whether or not he should snuggle up to Draco. Now that they’re dating, it doesn’t feel innocent anymore. But he feels cold lying this far apart.

He rests his hand against a stone wall. Under his hand, he can feel that it is a lot more stable and alive. After learning from Draco, he knows how to send a parcel of magic to Hogwarts. Hogwarts replies with a small pulse of magic, making Harry’s lips curl up.
Harry tries not to move. He doesn’t want to inadvertently touch anyone on either side.
“Okay,” Taylor reluctantly agrees. He follows Professor Hooch out of the Gryffindor tent, sneering in his heart towards all the people duped by the Slytherin dragon.
Their conversation meanders around Nolan’s worship of Draco and cups of hot chocolate. Eventually, Nolan returns, and the other werewolves of all houses arrive. Harry eagerly serves everyone wolf-appropriate food, and soon, full and drowsy wolves pile into the large blankety nest.
Draco smirks at the Hufflepuffs. At the Ravenclaws. At the Gryffindors. Mockingly. Daringly.

The two of them bicker, completely excluding Granger and Weasley from their conversation who are unable to keep up with Draco and Potter’s rhythm.
That was enough for Harry to have a figurative explosion in his mind.

“Me too!” Nolan jumps in.
: *fck fck fck make up a reason quickly*
Harry shuffles out of the bathroom and sits down heavily on his bed, yawning. Everyone is there in the bedroom. Malfoy is already under the blankets, leaning against the headboard and pillows, and Pansy is reclining on top.
“Yeah,” Harry returns brightly.
Harry nearly jumped out of his skin. “What, I know that!”
“To the Kitchen, I’m a little hungry,” Alice lies, not meeting Mary’s eyes.
Pansy grimaces. “Yes, but…”
“Good morning, Professor.”
Harry’s eyes crinkle. “How could I not?”
Potter laughs, eyes curving in humour. “No that’s right, you’re going to have a threesome marriage with Zabini and Parkinson…”
Granger curls her lips. “It’s not that simple, Harry. If I walked around saying that I was the Head of Gryffindor, that doesn’t make it
Harry picks up Draco’s cold hand and slowly reaches out with his magic. “C’mon Draco, take it,” he mumbles.

Robards has no time for this. “Save that for your questioning panel later. Think again about whether or not I have evidence.”

Draco freezes.

“You betrayed your own House,” Taylor retorts. “Which makes perfect sense because you’re a slimy Slytherin!”
Draco can feel the cracks appearing in Hogwarts’ magic. It’s most noticeable in the common areas of Hogwarts; in the Slytherin Dungeon, Slytherin’s magic dominates.
Draco looks back at him. His mouth opens—

Granger gives them a faintly disapproving look. “Making house-elves do extra work…”
Slytherin eyes narrow in on Ron. Harry clears his throat and leans against Draco, who technically isn’t part of the House-unity team, but is there because it involves people entering the Slytherin Building. “It’s a long story. I’ll tell you later.”

That night, the thestrals remain on watch. There is nothing the Ministry team can do to the Slytherin building.
, Blaise tells Hogwarts.
In Slytherin, the first day of internal classes starts with group study sessions as Draco, Pansy and Blaise plan out the new timetables for everyone in Slytherin. Students skim through the school curriculum and the content required for end-of-year examinations, taking the opportunity to revise, read ahead, or work on assignments that Draco intends to have marked, one way or another. The students in charge of teaching gather old class notes and other papers previously provided by Professor Flitwick.

“That’s because I’m Harry Potter, right? Once everyone hears my name, they forget that I’m a halfblood. People forget that Voldemort was a halfblood too.” Harry scoffs at the irony.
The rest of the world comes rushing back in as Malfoy tugs Harry towards the far doors. His strides are long, and Harry has to trot, lest Malfoy ends up dragging him along.

But if he says that outloud, he’ll be even more embarrassed.
“Of course.”
Draco rolls his eyes. Is Potter really that surprised about the Sectumsempra scars on his chest? Or the faded Dark Mark on his arm? He summons one of his robes; the buttons down the center front do themselves up, but Potter keeps staring. Draco inwardly shrugs. Maybe Potter’ll learn something about fashion.
Draco froze.
Harry’s arms quickly wrap around Draco as he kicks off.

wait, but not for long: They ‘kept in touch’ once: a short coffee in which Draco learnt that Harry was happy.
“Let us skip formalities,” Draco says. “I assume you know after your investigation yesterday.”
Tonight is not the night Draco wants to talk to her though. He’s sure it would ruin the atmosphere. So instead, Draco goes over to the thestrals to help supervise.
This is because their dormitories are going to be moved and re-integrated into Hogwarts!
“The fuck, Draco,” Harry threw the blanket at Draco’s face. Draco easily knocked it aside, and turned, moving his legs onto the sofa. He nudged one foot at Harry’s thigh, and revelled in the widening of Harry’s eyes, gaze snapping to Draco’s feet.
Pansy immediately notices. "What's wrong?"
He was definitely going to pay pleasurably for it later.

Draco shrugs one shoulder. “You’ve known that for seven years, surely.” He pointedly sits his quill back in its little holder, steeples his fingers, and gives Harry a serious look.  “How may I help you?”

But then he notices something a little off. Turning his eyes to the side, he frowns.
Narcissa’s eyes widen slightly before they narrow again. “

Minister Shacklebolt’s gaze is sombre but sharp. Under his eyes, the Ministry team can only be obedient as the panel of magical theorists examine their work.
How dare he? Who gave him the right??!” She stands up in a huff. “You better speak to your son or else…!”
Malfoy presses a hand on the growling werewolf’s head, drawing them close. “Potter, do you know the date?”
Pansy smirks. “What do you mean? I did nothing wrong at all. Also, you let Harry sleep in? You’re getting soft, Draco.”
: *grips the back of Draco’s robes and glares* GO AWAY!
Garren stalks to the opposite end of the space. Meanwhile, Harry positions himself a few meters to Draco’s side.
*meanwhile, in an alternate universe*
“Potter…” Draco pauses til Potter looks at him. Which, bad idea because Potter’s now
“Professor, Mother, good morning,” Draco greets them.
“Pansy,” Draco says.

Robards is haggard: hair messy, dark bags under his eyes. He glares at the gathered Aegis members and then turns to McGonagall. “What happened?”
“Cease at once!” Draco growls, rushing to Harry’s side.
. It’s good that Draco has finally started to mature, although his gaze is still very focused on protecting Slytherins and Slytherin-adjacent people only.
Malfoy’s footsteps stop a few feet away from Harry. A moment later, a warming charm blossoms, warding off the cold chill from the window.
“If it’s
“Fine,” Draco says. He accepts Harry’s hand and the two of them leave the Slytherin Wing.
: FORGET ROMANTIC CONFESSIONS, FORGET FEAR, JUST SHOUT IT OUT!!
“My muggle cousin liked chasing me and kicking me,” Harry says, shrugging. Saying it like it means nothing helps Harry feel like it’s nothing. It’s not important anymore, anyway.
Thankfully, Harry felt Draco’s gaze lift off. So Harry returned to watching the movie, eating the popcorn, and glancing at Draco’s feet, and trying not to catalogue all the times that Draco must have seen Harry’s own knobbly ankles.
“I—er—I sent you a Valentine’s Day poem in second year!” he blurts out.
, they certainly separated in time! I’ll go talk to the Minister before McGonagall twists her words. She may be the Headmistress, but Hogwarts is a state school! Does she want to sue us for breaking Hogwarts? Well, we can do the same thing!”
“You may,” Draco said. He sprawled back on the sofa, eyes half-lidded. “Go on.”
The juvenile thestrals are like the junior-years Slytherins, Draco thinks lazily. No fear after the adults give authorisation. Often, no fear before that too.
“I’m right

Harry went up to the top floor of Grimmauld Place, where Charlie had set up a nifty and cosy little owlery. There were nooks and crannies of different shapes and sizes, hardwood perches and soft bedding. Water and food were dispensed on one side of the room, and on the other side, owls could do their business.
the study).
“Harry, we’re leaving.”
Madam Pomfrey’s brows crease. “Mr Potter, magical infusions must be done carefully. Magical rejection is even more disastrous than organ rejection—”
Harley’s head immediately drops, his entire posture guilty.
Harry’s stricken expression makes Draco amused.
The pair hurry downstairs to the front hall. The Aurors burst through the door.
“Potter! You’re not a Slytherin, no matter what the blasted hat said!”
“Hey Draco, take a look at this?” Aster calls out.
“Well, I still hate you.”
: Senior Martial Brother! Senior Martial Brother Draco! *puppy-dog eyes*
Harry’s heart starts to thud in his chest. “Actually, the reason I asked was because there is someone I—”
With that, he falls back into step with Draco. The bond in Draco’s chest hums.
Draco barely suppresses the urge to roll his eyes. “However
“That—Malfoy boy?” Molly said, shocked.
Draco moved aside as Charlie took his place.
“Good evening, I hope I’m not interrupting anything,” Garren says with a charming, self-deprecating smile. That smile tightens when he sees Draco.
Harry sits up and downs the potion. Then he lies down again, grimacing.
“...What did you do after the War?”
“Yeah…” Harry says.
And that’s how Draco (and Harry by extension) obtains a long ‘tail’ of students following behind him like little playful ducklings.
“Um, neither of you finished breakfast, so can we go back inside?” Potter asks.

Harry smiles at her. “Unlike you first years, not all the Eighth years are up, are they?”
Jamie jumps up. “Yay!”
The circle never truly fades—at least not while the yule log burns. But it’s dimmed enough, and so Draco turns to his Slytherins. “Let us eat.”
.” Hermione’s tone was aggravated but also fond.
Draco gives a short laugh. “Uncomfortable?”
“Nolan,” Draco greets. “We saw each other at breakfast.” He rubs Nolan’s head. “Thank you for your work on the castle. You helped us pass.”
“Here,” Flitwick whispers, passing her a cup. It turns out to be a coffee mixed with a shot of Pepper Up.
Downstairs, the Slytherin Commons is lit with an enchanted predawn, the crackling flames in the central fire pit, and the candles on the giant Balsam fir. Piles of gifts surround the fir, and one certain Jamie Ottley’s already up and eyeing them. There are some other children awake too, but they’re chatting quietly and not nearly as obvious.
: Much better than you, Mr Potter.
Draco! Yes, yes you were,” Harry admitted. “You bastard.” His voice lowered. “That’s why I kept coming back.”
Draco fed him the stir-fried vegetables, savoury and with a hinting touch of nutty sesame. He moved onto the spiced pumpkin soup, and then the beef Wellington, and each “

Mrs Norris jumps up at Draco. With surprise, Draco catches her against his chest.
Pansy shakes her head. “It’s not much. I had to learn

Harry blushes slightly. “Well...aren’t we going to stay together…”
“Mr Malfoy, I have tea,” Michelle says in a calmer tone.

“I was preemptively fixing bad habits coming from Gryffindor,” Draco drawls.
“Malfoy! Fuck! Are you alright?!” Potter’s urgent tone drags Draco back to reality.

“You mean Harry,” Draco says at the same time.
“Hmm, okay,” Harry said with a soft smile.
Draco’s thrust was extra hard, extra punishing. A scowl was clear in his voice as he growled, “You’re looking at him. He’s looking at you. Can you really say you never thought of fucking him? Who’s your boyfriend, Harry? Who’s your future husband,
With a growl, Draco’s hips slammed against Harry’s arse. His cock slid in with one smooth motion. “Good boy!”
“Ah, well...Didn’t Slytherins invent bureaucracy? That’s totally you people, right?”
The spell slams into Draco, knocking him back, but nowhere near enough to knock him
“Charlie,
“...What children?”

Staring at their patterns which never meet, Draco’s lips curl in distaste, hot smoke wisping into the air. It would be much too easy for the two of them to take each other out.
McGonagall is ‘in charge’ of everyone else, as well as being the key person who weaves all the strands of magic into one cohesive whole.
A rushing of wind, the sound of things flying through the air—
“I don’t know why,” Harry says slowly. “But I know that Malfoy didn’t cast the first spell. Garren wasn’t even injured...only Malfoy was.”
,” she says again.
. Harry’s lips quirk up in amusement. “Hermione, did you really not notice? Behind you, just over there...”
“Your mother has a letter for you, Young Master Draco,” the house-elf says. After handing it over, the house-elf disappears.
Harry looks like he’s still in a daze, not quite listening to the magical theory speculations that Granger is talking about. More than once, he looks over his shoulder, back towards the Great Hall.
Draco yawns. “Is that all? I recommend you take a refresher lesson with our Defence Professor.”

“Only at Parvati and Lavender’s wedding. They had insisted,” Harry said, eyeing the sherwani. “But I don’t feel...I grew up with white muggles, you know. I don’t
Harry tightens his arms. “No escaping.” He clenches down, smirks when Draco’s hips stutter a little.
But then, Aster hadn’t protected them back during the previous year with the Carrows.
“If you hated Potter that much, you should have told him to take his gold and leave Gringotts altogether. Barclays has a wizarding branch in London—”
Harry narrows his eyes. “Dare you say that again?”
“But games are played together!” Jamie counters.
“But you
“It feels too much, too much!”
“Do you ever look at a calendar, Mr Potter?” Nolan says pompously.
Also, the writing style has slowly changed *author hides*
Draco hugs Harry to sleep.
Harry tilted his head up and smiled innocently. “What? Your cock is so cute. I could even give it a little pinch—”
: Hello!
“Was worried for me, the utter do-gooder,” Draco snorts. “Go off to lunch, I should be healed by dinner.”
“I’m going to help Madam Pomfrey,” Pansy says and leaves them.
“Hey, why do we only have dragons? How about we make a card for each of the houses? I want to have a lion!”
Pansy glares at her jar of broken soul orb pieces. “They’re made from materials that can be found in other items.” She looks at Draco, lowering her voice. “Your parents might have information about how the original orbs were created.”
McGonagall downs her second cup of coffee. An unregistered dragon animagus though… All animagi must be registered with the Ministry, and dragons are extremely dangerous creatures that are also monitored by the Ministry.
Garren’s smile becomes tight, and Hermione looks a beat away from dismissing Harry’s words.
They shadow the Slytherins down the stairs. Keep following past their own floor, down to the dungeons. At this rate, they’ll find out Slytherin’s location.
, but the news was big enough that some of the other Gryffindors shared alternative papers that they read.
“I understand,” Ben Taylor nods.
Harry startled, eyes widening at the
“Are you sure you don’t want to try both now?”
Madam Pomfrey’s magic immediately joins Flitwicks as they enter the Hospital Wing, and Draco’s set down on a bed. The scent of muskiness and baked goods follow them in.
“Then there is no need for these glasses.” Draco took them off.
After they bought the last thing on Harry’s list, Draco continued walking.
After a week, this is what Harry has managed to determine:
Valentines’ Day is coming up, so Draco and Harry are going shopping to buy Harry some clothes.
Auror Hitchly bristles. “What compensation?” he sneers. “You should be compensating

Harry gives a suppressed smile. “You’re saying that because you wrote half of my speech.”

Harry makes a face. “Fine, I trust your decisions.”

All three of them look at each other and grimace. An

Jamie smiles at Draco. “Good morning, Mr Malfoy. You said you’ll talk about the dragon later! It’s now later! Can we see?
In his sleep, Harry takes the opportunity to snuggle even closer to the warmth, pressing right up against Draco’s side.
Daily Prophet
Draco’s heart feels sweet. How...how did Harry
“Mr Malfoy, if you have any information about Aegis, it should be reported to the Aurors...” McGonagall frowns.
“Hey, Harry,” Ginny greets. “You didn’t play Quidditch with us this weekend! What gives??”

The tips of Harry’s ears go red. “You—git! I came here to call you to bed because it’s bedtime! How do you like

And there’s the gossipy looks from the general student body. How tedious. From what he can hear from their not-quiet talking, they know he’s been in to see the Aurors, and that he’s been to the Hospital Wing.

Dust and rubble make the corridor ahead hazy. There’s the sharp tang of offensive spells, the familiar scent of
“Don’t forget your scarf, it’ll be cold in the castle at night.”
There’s a big silver dragon on the ground with students, flying in the air with students, being petted by students, breathing fire to an audience of amazed students... And under many of these articles describing how friendly the dragon is, there is a little advertisement with a picture of a soft and fat dragon.

Harry presses his lips together, his fingers hovering above the rings. His fingers curl together and pull back.
“Do you see?”

Draco stops and turns to face him. “Sir,” he says respectfully. “You mean these?” He gives Flitwick the destroyed fragments of one of the soul orbs.
” Potter’s voice is tiny compared to Hagrid’s boom. But Draco recognises it perfectly.
“We are of Hufflepuff…”
Juvenile spells have jammed the motion mechanism, overwhelming the staircases’ ability to sense students’ requirements. The pattern of spells is spidery and holey in his vision, and deft cuts in certain strands make the hex fall apart.
“I’m not scared, Malfoy.”
Draco frowns slightly. It’s not that bad, but now that Felicity mentions it, he feels very light-headed. How many soul orbs has he crushed now...? How much magic did he give Harry…?
Draco breathes evenly. Magic flows through lines through the earth, and Hogwarts is built on a particularly active magical location. McGonagall is diverting some magic from those lines up towards Hogwarts’ heartstone in an amount that will far exceed Draco’s or Harry’s magic, provided that McGonagall maintains it for the entire duration of the ritual.

Harry’s legs tighten around Draco’s hips. “Uh-huh,” he says affirmatively. He grins and lands a completely failed kiss on Draco’s cheek.
“Come sit with us at the Gryffindor table,” Hermione says, “You haven’t spoken to Ginny and the others for a while, right?”
“Didn’t you want house-unity?” Granger says, annoyed.
“Malfoy...are you alright?” Potter hovers close to Draco.
When the children give heartfelt thank yous to Narcissa Malfoy and Lucius Malfoy, both for the gifts and for allowing them to spend Christmas here together, Narcissa and Lucius can’t help but think:
Back in the Slytherin Commons, students are chatting as the homework session is over.
So it’s not someone dangerous.
“Yes, that kind of thinking!” Harry grins.
At the Ministry, for once, a part of the bureaucracy is moving quickly. The anti-Slytherin faction in the Ministry and Wizengamot can only grind their teeth at Minister Shacklebolt’s speedy dealing with the administration behind Headmistress McGonagall’s paperwork.
“No, no!” Dilly looks more horrified now than when she first saw the wolves. “Dilly is feeding students, no compensation!” She disappears with a quiet
Harry flushed. “He’s treating me right,” he mumbled.
: ………………………………..
: ... Hey!! I'm not one of those evil stepfathers!
Narcissa smiles gently, but her eyes have no warmth. “Does the Ministry prohibit its citizens from writing a petition? But that cannot be, I surely remember a petition that was the instigator of a recent bill passed in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, Ministry incompetence made a horrible mess. Who do they expect to clean it up?”
“Hmmm, Draco, no,” Pansy mumbles. “Too early, what the fuck.”
“I know.” Not all the carriages are being used, so only a smaller crew of thestrals are required today.
: Call me dad too!
: (╯ಠ_ಠ）╯︵ ┳━┳
“Hm.”
“Again!”
“A-wooo!!” Nolan howls happily. He trots over to Mr Malfoy and flops right over Mr Malfoy’s super warm lap. A low rumble purr builds in his chest as Mr Malfoy scratches his ears and head and fur.
“I’ll move out,” Draco said. “The flat is too small for the three of us. That way, you could have the entire place and not worry about me.”
he can to help.”
. It has only been the more frequent transformations that have allowed Draco to control it.
“But what about Gamp’s Law?” Michelle asks. “Why don’t you ask your prefects for more food if you’re hungry? And...aren’t you living in tents now? It’s not so far to the kitchen tent.”
Draco laid out croissants and fruit and tea and an assortment of spreads and jams for breakfast.
Creevey presses his lips together. He props himself up, trying to shuffle away from Pansy.
I can combine this extra knowledge with numerous runs of the machine learning in an adhoc way, and doing this increased the correct percentage from 55% to 68%.
Surprise (shortish) Wednesday update!
“It’s fine,” Harry says magnanimously. “I spend every other night with Draco, it’s only fair that you pay attention to Nolan tonight.”
Harry squirmed. “Why are you sitting so tall and straight? Slouch down a little.”
Oh, dear. Mr. Malfoy, you’re going to see Madame Pomfrey
At the front, the members of the press are interviewing important persons and taking photos.
lighting spheres cast a warm glow to the green decor. The decadent and ornate furnishings are softened invitingly by details like messy piles of books and board games on the table surfaces, and throw blankets and cushions on the sofas.
Draco acquiesces. “Protect Slytherin first.”
“If that is the case...we’ll simply confiscate the Manor.” Hitchly’s gaze turns to Lucius. “Don’t you know that leaving the Manor will lead to your immediate relocation to Azkaban? Of course, you may soon be moved to Azkaban nonetheless. After all, you are Draco Malfoy’s father.”

“Hey, Malfoy,” the goblin says. “Kraker tells you to stop taking the carts so fast or she’ll string your guts up.”
The three of them walk in silence. When they enter the Slytherin Commons, Draco nods to Felicity, and then leads the two boys into the Slytherin Head Boy room that they use as a meeting space.
: (O_O;) (O_O;) (O_O;) Um….
: Yes you may.
“You were also great, Mr Malfoy!” Nolan shouts.
Finally in a quiet moment for himself, Draco takes a seat on one of the couches by the wall and reads through his parents’ letters. It is all as expected. He folds the letters back up and looks over the Common Room. Various students are relaxing or chatting. For this brief time, there’s no stress or pressure from the world outside these walls.
Pansy also pats the wall. “Is that it?” She pouts when Hogwarts’ reception of her is not nearly as obvious. “If only Hogwarts had eyes that I could cast Legilimency on.”
“It’s past your bedtime too, Mr Potter,” Draco drawls.
The two Ravenclaws flinch back in shock. One of them is tall. The other is short.
Granger glares at him with indignation.
Flitwick is extra attentive to Draco during Charm’s class. He’s also
Harry snorts. “You wish.”
“You hungry, Nolan?” Harry says teasingly.
If it is Draco, why didn’t Draco tell her that he’s a dragon animagus? Instead of registering and using that fact to his advantage, he remained unregistered, only for it to be used as blackmail!
He’s aware that Pansy and Blaise are flanking him. He’s aware that Pansy has told Potter to stay back. He’s aware of Potter protesting to his own friends, their voices getting smaller and smaller.
Harry looked up at Charlie from this unfamiliar position. Charlie was shorter and stockier and much more ginger than Draco. His skin was tanned, almost as much as Harry’s, and his muscles bulged. His cock was shorter but wider.
Harry’s lips twist in discomfort. “Don’t do that. You know...Snape tried to save my mum. Failed though.”
But...this is only the first day.
His magic is still not stable, but he really cannot listen to everyone discussing how to wake him up. He
“I’ll—”
Draco doesn’t even care, and he doesn’t care that he doesn’t care.

Harry emerges from the bathroom, rubbing his hair with a towel, only half dressed. The scary part is about to come—
Some indeterminate time later, Malfoy snaps his fingers in front of Harry’s face.
“Oh, you want to see a lawyer, do you?” Robards says. He motions to a group of Aurors. “Take them back to the Ministry, call their lawyers, and interrogate them.”
“I have no intention of stealing your cat!” Draco tugs Mrs Norris away from him, and puts her down, but she ends up rubbing against his leg instead.
Malfoy turns his head, and glares to the goblins to the side. “What are you looking at? Potter’s
“You were very good, Harry,” Draco whispered. “I love you the most.”
“Mhm.”
Harry wants to simultaneously cover his eyes, but also not cover his eyes...
Harry thought about saying what he wanted to say, but he ultimately shook his head, biting his bottom lip.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Better than a

Draco turns to Potter, whose gaze is still fixed on the circle. “Surely you’re hungry?”
The only difference is when their legs touch under the table. And then Draco would smirk like he’s some kind of god, and Harry would make a purposefully oblivious expression in response, and then Draco’s smirk would turn into a smile, and then Harry would smile back too because he can’t help it…

Draco turns to Potter now. “Potter, I’ll accompany you to the Library to retrieve your items. We need to talk about how you ran down here…”
“You should all go to sleep so that Draco can rest! What if he doesn’t have enough energy to transform in the morning?” Harry says.
He and Draco had talked about maybe bringing Charlie in, but he didn’t expect it to be in the morning when Draco liked to fuck him awake!

“For once, I’m siding with Nolan. Maybe we should just let him sleep,” Harry says.

“Yes.” Harry pauses, looking around hesitantly.
With each breath, he settles. The burning need to take the dragon form fades, as does the weirdness of the form itself: six limbs, counting his wings; the extra stomach filled with fire.

Slytherins are getting bullied. Then you should have gone to Garren or McGonagall!”
Harry blinks. “Oh.” He glances at the cut on his arm, only to see it fading away before his eyes.
Harry does so, and Malfoy accepts the papers back. Aside from his narrow-eyed look of suspicion, he doesn’t comment. “That’ll be processed within five working days.” With his wand, the papers fold up, seal, and fly off wherever it is that transfers go to get processed.

While Harry heated up the grill and coated the lamb in tandoori paste and oil, he directed Malfoy to reheat up the rice, mix in the almonds and currants, wash the spinach, and shred and blanch the beans.
Despite the coldness of late November, students from other houses sit arrogantly in their stands, wearing their robes in the muggle style—split open down the center-front and paired with a muggle uniform underneath.

Hogwarts is no longer fractious, as its different parts, castle and inhabitants, create bonds across Houses. Greyback and Aegis are dealt with, and his Slytherins have been pulled through, safe. And Draco has even acquired an unexpected future husband, Harry James Potter.
Pansy rolls her eyes. “Not everyone is a genius at charms like you.”
A few minutes later: Harry is thoroughly distracted ( ͡~ ͜ʖ ͡°)
...Nolan grumbles. It’s good that Potter knows the truth. But still! Nolan should hate Potter on principle! He stands up, turns around so his butt faces Potter, and lies back down on Mr Malfoy’s lap.

Draco straightened, Harry’s trust in him making his chest swell. Damn
Rather than responding immediately, McGonagall lays down the papers in front of Draco and Harry.
“Malfoy,” Nguyen says, “Flitwick asked me to give you these for now. He said he’ll come to talk to you later.”

Blaise smiles mysteriously as he is wont to do. Draco ignores him out of long practice.

Draco folds up the letter, slipping it into his robes. He nudges the chocolates towards Pansy without comment, and strides out. He ignores curious eyes as he heads for the Forbidden Forest.
Ella tries to shuffle them around the Hufflepuffs, but the tallest girl stops them.
Draco pulls apart Harry’s clothes. He lowers his head and takes one of the dark pink nubs into his mouth, sucking, teasing, biting.
“I can find my own way,” Draco says cooly. “Professor, since you’re disallowing me to leave, who will fix the hazards left in the corridor?”
Harry stares at Zabini and cannot muster a response.
There’s an unsettled feeling in her chest as she walks down the halls. Something has changed in Hogwarts, and it’s concentrated in the below-ground floors where Slytherin lies.

is. This...this isn’t like the old days. Draco no longer wants to listen blindly to the hard words of his father, nor the cloth-covered-heavy-hand words of his mother.
Harry continues in a slightly anxious tone, “And no one has touched that snitch yet. It’s for you, touch it first.”
Pansy folds up all the various papers and throws them on one of the coffee tables in the Slytherin Commons, yawning. The other students can read them and laugh at the Ministry later.
A low murmur starts that builds and builds.
“Good day.”
The other professors immediately urge the students to spread out.

“It was a duel.” Draco turns. “Potter, you were part of the Hogwarts restoration team.”
That night, Harry curls up by Draco’s side. It’s dark in the room, and Harry’s glasses are off. Draco’s skin is warm and sleepiness-inducing.
Draco shrugs. “During the War. Would you like my memory?”
Pomfrey’s eyebrows rise. “Is that so?”
The second spell smashes Draco’s shield. Draco dodges with a swirl of his robes, and flicks, “

Madame Pomfrey frowns at Mary Green’s receding back. Carrying a camera like that, it is clear that she does not have good intentions.
“That’s not a human sized chair,” Jones says.
Taylor’s eyes widen slightly. “For me?”
“No, no,” the first magical theorist says. “That would be like organ donation, and Hogwarts might well reject it—”
Harry’s heart jumps to his throat. In the firelight, he can see multiple round objects slam into the silver dragon’s body and wings, sizzling as they suck up magic. The dragon snaps his body, hitting the soul orbs

Nolan will have to return home with Harry first, with the last of the adoption procedures to be finished soon. There are also some other students that will best come stay with Harry and Draco over the summer holidays. Regardless, Draco plans to keep in touch with all of the Slytherins and werewolf students. They are also all welcome to either his home or Harry’s over any of the holidays.  He and Pansy and Felicity are working on how to extend the communicative functionality of their badges, both to facilitate communication during the rest of the year, and as a new product for Pansy to sell.

The next day, Sunday, is the last full day of the Winter Break; on Monday, students who went home will be travelling back to Hogwarts.
,” Draco says sternly.
Harry and Weasley look at each other, equally commiserating.
Although the visible pulsation of magic from the yule log and the blood sacrifice is gone, Draco can still catch glimmers of magic at the corner of his eye. Centered on the Slytherin Commons, Hogwarts’ magic has brightened and strengthened, fading as they go further up and further away.
Garren glares him down.
Draco unburies himself from the books and papers. He blinks when he realises that all the Slytherins have gathered down in the Commons once more, standing behind Blaise.
Harry takes the card: it says,

As part of this, they need a lot of new glass. One of the Hogwarts alumni happens to be skilled at making glass, so some of the Slytherins are sent off to learn how to make panes of glass, both clear and stained, out of the sand from the shore of the Black Lake.
Harry lowers his eyes. “I guess…”
—Well, it’s not that Skeeter believes all these things she’s making up, but they sure will make great headlines.
“...Since you said no, I want to even more now.”

Harry nods, bubbling anticipation in his chest.
“Headmistress McGonagall, we are here to discuss certain matters…” the senior Ministry Official Anderson says.
Malfoy leans in, and the head of it brushes against Harry’s entrance. A bit of pressure, and it slowly goes in.
McGonagall rubs her bleary eyes and pushes a copy of the
Harry steps back in Malfoy’s way. “Oh, come on, Malfoy.” He glances over Malfoy. “Your robes are pretty today,” he says, and smiles.
It doesn’t help that some students like to come and watch, making comments about what they would have done different, spouting off basic spells they’ve just learnt as though they’re now experts in magical castle building.

“I aimed perfectly,” the Auror retorts. “Stand down, Malfoy.”
After his come was well down the drain, Harry put on a pair of pants, draped the towel across his shoulders and left the ensuite, intent on picking some clothes from his wardrobe.
“Have a good day,” Harry quickly also says. The two of them exit.
McGonagall’s gaze becomes sharp. “Tell me, Mr Malfoy, who has the ultimate decision to separate Slytherin from Hogwarts? The Headmistress, the Head of Houses, and Hogwarts itself. As long as we do not implement the Wizengamot bill ourselves, the actions of the Ministry will have no true effect.”
“I’m sorry that I did nothing to help. I could have—should have—helped your resistance, because we were friends.”
“I agree,” Blaise says, his usually calm voice tight. His voice drops, words only for Draco. “The Hospital Wing isn’t St. Mungos. Madam Pomfrey has good principles.”
He lets himself be tugged along the white-stone footpath of the the gardens, before coming to a stop in front of a wall of white roses—

Harry straightens. Yes. I was thinking...the different Houses have class together, but it’s not that easy to talk and make deep friendships in class. So we should organise fun activities together. Show that we’re friendly, and that only Draco bites.”
Draco raises his voice. “There are a number of Slytherin students missing.”
When Malfoy hears his theory, he gives Harry a considering look. His, “
“This is not stable,” McGonagall says coldly. “We
Draco skims through the rest of the paper, but there’s nothing else interesting aside from the weather forecast for Samhain.
Draco glances at Harry, and tells McGonagall, “If it were only led by Granger, then I would accept that over Professor Coates’ presence. Under Coates’ watch, another student attacked Sequoia Hawks with a soul orb, while Coates preferred to deduct points rather than help.”
“If you may.”
, Fenrir?” Draco scoffs. “Must you fight like a dog?”
Draco’s cock hardened further. He reached down and gripped his own cock hard to stop it from forcing its way into Harry. He had to go slowly. He had to make Harry love it so much that Harry would want to get fucked again and again.
: Heh.
Before Harry is allowed to leave the Slytherin Commons, Draco makes sure that he has his hat, scarf, gloves, and warm over-robe.
, Draco growls at it. He throws his own magic out like a net, like sharp, digging claws that pulls the magic back, slowing its descent. Not all of it should return, either. Some of it is Draco’s magic, some of it is the magic of the badges, some of it is

Charlie Weasley takes the initiative to walk through first, and the others follow behind him. Robards is last.

Pansy yawns. “This is boring. Look at me.”
Draco hugged him to the point that Harry’s feet lifted from the ground. “Didn’t I say you could tell whoever and whenever you wanted?”
Harry reaches out and lightly touches Draco’s chest. “That’s not a problem. Of course they would know more things, just like how Ron and Hermione know things about me that you don’t. Anyway, are we really going to start divulging our deepest darkest secrets on the first day when we haven’t even kissed yet?”

McGonagall rubs her forehead. “Yes, I thought so. I have sent some letters out to find a second set of Professors...Unfortunately, whether or not I can appoint them depends on the Ministry. As you may know, the Ministry has taken control over most of the Hogwarts Board.”
Harry rolls his eyes. “You’re so petty, Draco.”

Wands are drawn, red spells cutting through the air.
Garren and Hermione continue to discuss the specifics and then move onto topics they could teach about, like science. Ron slumps, clearly bored. Harry listens quietly, if only so that he can warn Draco and the others if necessary.
Harry startles when Draco starts pushing him towards the other room. Draco closes the door firmly behind them.
“I’ll have you know that I’m extremely clean,” Draco retorts.
The other man grits his teeth. “Harry Potter,” he says tersely. “There is no law against disciplining my own fucking kid.”

Felicity blinks, smiling without smiling. “Why didn’t you try to stop it in the first place? Alerted a professor when you saw those Gryffindors maliciously lurking?”
“Passable.”
The Gringotts alarm lights flash, and guards flank him. The far door slams open and Malfoy stalks across the hall.
: *want to play with dragon!Draco*
But there’s no rush, no hurry. Harry has years to learn Draco, and vice versa. He learns more every day, knowledge refreshed anew and bright.
: 🤭🤭 Sad that you're no longer your mother's favourite child? Don’t worry, I still ~love~ you.
Draco can feel his peaceful, green-eyes-black-curls-Potter-free days slipping away like the wind. He turns back to his friends, and frowns when he realises they’re looking at him.
“You’ve looked after the second years.”
“You smell good,” Harry blurted out. “Luna said that scent compatibility is really important for a good love life.”
The Ministry remains as inefficient as ever, putting it nicely.
In fact, Harry’s not casting. Instead, he’s holding Malfoy’s hand, while Malfoy raises stone and adds it into the new construction.
“I do,” Draco says.
“That bastard,” Draco repeats. “Poor Mother, she’s been trying to arrange marriage for me with any pureblood witch of reasonable standing. Imagine the scandal.”

Draco takes his offered hand. “Now remember how I taught you to keep your magic under your skin? This time, push it into mine. But don’t forget to let go of it, so that I can control it.”
“That’s right,” Draco said, voice gravelly. “You’re so responsive, baby boy.” He leaned forward, dropping a kiss on Harry’s hair. Harry whimpered, arching his back.

Upon seeing the group of excitable third year Slytherins converge upon him, Blaise puts down his papers and bestows a smile upon the three who carry most of the excitement, Alberta Bulstrode, Raven Flint, and Rose Datta. In contrast, Nolan Larch and Harley Gerble look like they’ve been dragged along.

“Will the Slytherins move that inside their dungeons then?” Ron muses.
“Having healed Mr Malfoy before, his body has non-human characteristics, in a manner that is indeed consistent with those of werewolves moreso than animagi. For example, he has a constant temperature that would otherwise signal a dangerous fever in you,” Pomfrey adds. “I will testify for him if the Ministry wants to take this to the Wizengamot.”

“Pans, what happened?”
“Why, thank you.”
Harry tries, but his control of magic has never been that fine. By the time Draco returns to him, Harry’s face is contorted with frustration.
“Oh, as long as Draco is okay, I can have these printed and distributed across the entirety of Great Britain,” Pansy says carelessly. “Draco, you better start a business, quickly. With this kind of advertising, any venture would explode in popularity.”
“Your old flatmate, right?” his ex nodded, and smiled warmly at Draco. They were exactly Harry’s type. “But Harry—” they said, holding out the flowers.
Unbeknownst to Draco Malfoy, Harry watches all the Slytherin students leave breakfast, the image of Malfoy’s tight expression and heavy shoulders lingering in his eyes.
Pansy steps back, highly satisfied with herself. She smirks. “Imagine if Potter saw your hair like that.”
“Yes, yes,” Harry nudges Draco first, and they both carefully walk around sleeping thestrals, and carefully step over sleeping werewolves to get back to their original spots in the middle of the blanket nest.

Jamie Ottley tries not to fidget. He’s sitting next to Michelle, true, but all the other second year students from all the houses are here in this makeshift classroom too.
Last night, Draco didn’t come. Harry was reading downstairs, how did he get into bed?
Granger’s face falls, just as Weasley catches up to them.
Harry immediately reddened. At this point, it was probably a pavlovian response…
Jamie Ottley is a second year Slytherin. Compared to his first year, this second year has been much better.
Now that Harry is aware, he can clearly sense the warm-tingle-flickering of Draco’s magic.
“Sorry, sorry,” Harry quickly says, “I wanted to feed the students, and I’m also a bit hungry now…”
Draco inwardly shakes his head.
Malfoy sighs again and takes Harry’s arm. Before Harry can smell Malfoy’s cologne, they’re apparating and landing down somewhere in Muggle London. The streets are fairly crowded; and Malfoy takes him to a Japanese restaurant.

Jamie shakes his head, sniffing. His lips are downturned, eyes growing wet. “I was going to give the house-elves a gift, but…”

She looks back at the article. Due to the night-time setting, the image is not entirely clear. It’s not fully certain that the figure transforming into a dragon is her Draco. But people have been arrested by the Ministry on much lesser evidence.
Harry sends the last of his gardening tools back home, just as Andromeda and Teddy emerge from the house.
“Draco, you could—”
“Structural integrity is still in place,” Draco says. “But you may want to check whether or not anything came loose and have everyone reinforce everything again just in case.”
“—Hey!”

Granger and Weasley may poison Potter’s ears against Draco, but he can trust them to keep Potter safe. And anyway, Draco can easily keep an eye on Potter from the Slytherin table.

It was a gusty autumn day in London, and while the lunch crowd was just starting to peter out, the streets were still full of people. A small hunched-over man, in black robes with a deep hood over his head, hurried down Diagon Alley.

But McGonagall might have pulled her eyes away from the other houses long enough to notice the low turn-out of Slytherins at dinner, and Garren
But Harry didn’t know this. Harry was just happy to have another friend. But if Harry found out about Malfoy’s feelings...what would happen?
, the Commons is surprisingly quiet. Even the student signing with the merpeople by the glass window is making subdued movements.
Pleasure and sensation sparks across Harry’s cock, building up and up. And
Draco puts on a worried, demure expression. “I’m concerned about the younger students, just in case. I can protect myself. I’ll head back soon.”
Even though...the dragon
Draco’s thrusting stills. His fingers dig into Harry’s flesh. “What did you say?”
“We keep the Commons warm, and the younger students like to take the chance to sleep,” Pansy adds.
Severus’s front office has remained mostly untouched—Draco only uses his late godfather’s books. The potions laboratory, however, has been put to use.

Draco started to thrust his fingers in and out, drawing a moan from Harry’s lips.
“This animagus-like potion gives me the ability to turn into a dragon.”
How juvenile!
“...” Longbottom is now dressed in clothing that looks a lot like his own (but more expensive) with a breakfast muffin in one hand and cup of coffee in the other.
Draco glares at him and strides out. He meets Pansy at the Slytherin exit.

“If only others could see that Slytherins can have fun too,” Harry says, his eyes on the messy younger years. His slightly-cracked lips quirk up in a smile. “I still can’t believe we made you those robes.

“The Slytherins’ have a
“Bunk beds!” comes Jamie’s voice. Jamie comes out from the passageway that leads to the second year boys dormitory and walks over to Michelle, who is sitting on a sofa against one of the walls. “Michelle, we have bunk beds! They’re so cool, I got a top bunk! Do you have bunk beds too? What’s so bad about living in a tent?”
“Well, I’m not going to bed until he comes back.”
“Anyhow, see ya!” he says, pushing Ron and Hermione to the floo, before he himself floos to the Leaky Cauldron.
. You don’t have to run the company. I’ll give you 80% of the shares.”
“Go, go,” Pansy says, pushing Draco and Harry both towards the Slytherin Entrance. “Blaise and I will look after your children.”
“But is it enough?” Harry asks, looking at Draco.
Harry’s eyes narrow. “I’m watching you, got that?”
Draco was egging on the heroine. “

Draco has already helped the younger students before dinner: it’s best to teach them before they completely relax after eating. Now that it’s after dinner, the students in the laboratory are the older students, most of whom don’t require any instruction.
: Yes, mum.
if he asks to be close to Draco. He doesn’t want the others to have misconceptions about him!
“For what?” Harry absently touched the scarf too, brushing over Malfoy’s fingers. Malfoy’s hand withdrew. Harry could feel a warming charm embedded in the scarf that extended a handspan or so around the actual scarf. It meant that it also kept his ears warm.
: D-dad? ༼ಢ_ಢ༽
“If you wanted to look at my face so much, I’ll have Blaise take a picture for you,” Draco drawls. When Potter doesn’t reply, he continues, “Are you embarrassed? You’re very bizarre, Harry James Potter.”

As lunch approaches, Draco gathers the students willing to head to the Great Hall.
Pansy nods and summons her notes.
In fact, Harry didn’t feel cold anymore. No, he felt much too hot. But he was reluctant to take off the scarf that Malfoy had carefully wrapped it around him, and he was not going to tell Malfoy to remove his arm either.
Draco cannot stay...because he has his own herd to look after.
It doesn’t take long for both of them to fall asleep.
Draco reaches out and pats Harry on the head. “As the Head of Slytherin, it is

Hermione didn’t want Harry to feel sad, or played. But she also couldn’t stop him.
“You’re having dinner dates with Malfoy?” she said out loud.
“Most purebloods are related somehow,” Ginevra says with a roll of her eyes.
Charlie’s big hands grasped Harry’s butt cheeks, massaging them. “You feel so good, Harry.”
Robards is glad he’s sitting down when Pomfrey reveals that Malfoy is not an animagus but rather a
“I’m heading the potions lab.”
Harry shyly wrapped his hand around Draco’s cock. It was the first time he had touched another man’s cock. It felt large and heavy in his hand. How would it feel in his mouth? Was it...too big to fit? Would it feel good stretching out his body?
“...If I play with them a lot of times. Right.”
Harry had the novel experience of touching the top of Draco’s head. The strands of pale hair were soft, not surprising in hindsight given Draco’s bathing routine.
Hermione freezes.
“Thanks, Malfoy.” Granger’s eyes quickly scan the parchment. “Interesting…” she mumbles to herself.
“Don’t stop,” Harry mumbles. “It’s...it’s just wanking, right? I’m
“Wow….” Nolan breathes. “It’s warm, not cold at all!”
Both of them can see that the original anchor for the spell is intact.
“Dad! I want to fly too!” Nolan shouts.
Pansy shots him a meaningful look.
“Scared?” Draco drawls. “A little burn can be easily healed.”
Ron scratches his head. “The thing I don’t understand is why we haven’t heard about these Aegis raids. If they

Harry is not in the room. The bonds reach out from his chest, even the hair-thin ones. Every single person is accounted for—Harry is somewhere in the Common Room.
The sound of pecking at the door wakes Draco up. It’s barely 5am. Draco extracts himself from Harry and Blaise, pulling the blankets back up again.

“Don’t worry,” Pansy says comfortingly. “Your hypothetical children will be fine.”
Draco does not even bother to sigh. He only hopes that the house-elves will bring Jamie back when they send dinner over.
There was so much come inside of Harry. He could feel it, sloshing around inside of him. There was enough come to make someone pregnant.

Hermione leans in close to Harry, lowering her voice. “What is up with your Slytherins? I heard some of them aren’t attending classes.” The judgement in her voice is audible, despite how she has tried to push it down.
