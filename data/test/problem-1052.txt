“The women called that Death Eater scum lawyer; he’ll be representing them against us in Harry’s custody case this winter. I doubt he’ll see sense like any light lawyer and settle this out of court. It’s going to be a public spectacle and we’ll be dragged through the Wizengamot. Rita is going to be a nightmare if she gets wind of this. We’ll have to be careful with Alex’s PR.”
Carefully, Tom handed the paper to Severus, not letting Hadrian look on it too much. It was enough to know his little boy had lived it. He didn’t need to be reminded of it. Tom watched his husband flick through the pages, as a Potions Master, Severus knew the human body much better than Tom. Severus already fair complexion went white as a sheet as he lingered on a single page, his hands brushing Hadrian’s neck. The teen stiffened and glanced at the paper.
“I’ve heard you’re a Metamorphagus, is that your effortless or just your preferred appearance?” The words tumbled out of his mouth before he thought of just how rude he was being. He was relieved as instead of being offended by the blunt question the younger man smiled softly, eyes glancing at Draco.
“Let’s call this meeting adjourned for the time being as it seems the children have gone away. Would you all be amenable to meeting again soon? Alex is Harry’s brother and even if its just visits, don’t you want your son to know his birth family?” Erin frowned at him.
“Yes. I don’t mind. Do as you see fit, I trust you.”
Photographs of all their friends and the five years (summers and one holiday technically) they’d spent together. Hadrian’s paintings hung on the wall, with little knick-knacks they’d collects strewn on shelves. The blanket Draco had given Hadrian for Christmas when they were thirteen laid on the living room couch.
He was wary of course, but he also didn’t think his effortless looking more like his fathers would be so bad. Hadrian relaxed his shoulders and let out a sigh, raising the vial in a small toast, though he didn’t know what to. Having a family again? Finding his birth heritage? Reclaiming what he’d lost?
“Children.” All three of her kids stilled and looked at her immediately, Snape was impressed. He wished his snakes were as easily to wrestle into submission. Lily just glared jealously at the ease the woman showed in commanding her daughters and Lily’s son when she herself struggled to wrangle Alex and her husband under control on a daily basis. “No fighting. Why don’t you wait outside? I’m sure Annabee wants to tell you both all about her first day of kindergarten.”
“Diffindo.” The skin and muscle of his calf parted easily with the curse and James paid no mind as Hadrian screamed and writhed on the ground. James opened the trunk in the room and stuffed anything he could find that could serve to send a message or entertain the piece of shit, making double sure to swipe the phoenix feather from the floor. Slamming it shut once he’d finished.
A warning look was all that was needed to get her to back down. Draco snorted.
Hadrian more than kinda loved him.
“I thought I was going to say screw it and get expelled before I was even sorted when they prick started talking to us and trying to steal my brother. If he tries anything I’m severing off his limbs and beating him to death with his still bleeding arms.” Violent, the three pure bloods turned pale at the grotesque threat, but it seemed Potter- Dragma, the male Dragma, was unimpressed. Or rather unaffected.
“Oh, it’s a large bath. We have one downstairs I guess.”
“Lily. Go.” The redhead shot concerned and longing glances between her husband and her ex-son before she hurried Alex away and escaped down the hall. Leaving Hadrian to face
It made him sick. And there was no five-year-old to ground him. It was dizzying.
“Yes, that should be fine. He can speak with Hadrian’s therapist Nina too if he wants a better overview of his history.” Lucius jotted some notes down with his quill.
“Oh do tell?” The Potters looked confused, only Lily and Albus were perceptive enough to look wary with their Slytherin banter.
“Oh cool! Harry’s got his pet snake Suni, she’s been his for years now. But I just got a new kitten and I’m still trying to get her used to me. I named her Marissa. Do you have any pets?” Draco grinned, not responding for a moment as they all stumbled into one boat before he spoke again.
Immediately, it felt like shackles had dragged him down. Holding him in a vice grip and leaving Hadrian no choice but to collapse to the floor and wheeze. “Crucio! Give me your wand!”
“You’re so fucking beautiful, never talk about yourself like that again.” Hadrian finally cracked a smile, Draco could feel it hovering just under his bottom lip as Hadrian looked at them with those mesmerizing eyes. The scars, the emotions, the strength Hadrian had for enduring them; they were all Hadrian’s and it was all beautiful to him.
“Be calm my boy. He’ll have been returned to the Malfoys and his adoptive mothers, he’ll be back to school after they feel it is safe enough and then we can try again. We’ll do a blood adoption and perhaps a compulsion potion just to keep him put. You shouldn’t have given him access to the library, nor kept his door unlocked.” Albus’ voice was soft with a gentle cadence, he was in a similar state of undress.
-Lily likely won’t let him kill me if she heeled my head and leg
“You made English tea?”
“I remember the basic governing style. Some goblin wars from history class. Honestly, I barely remember the classes, most of what British wizarding skills I know I taught myself from my school books. I only remember the creepy headmaster really. It’s like from the moment he picks me up to the moment he drops me off is a giant blur.” Draco frowned.
Hadrian cocked an eyebrow. “Does that mean I need to cause a scandal? The only ‘closed door’ quirk I can think of is how shameless our mothers’ are with PDA. And that’s just so cute it’s sickening.”
Flicking a long ponytail over his shoulder, he blinked and turned his head when there was a knock on the train door. Pulling away from his thoughts he stared at a boy with platinum blonde hair stood in front of the two of them, cocking an eyebrow at his and Laney’s intertwined hands.
“I don’t like what you’re insinuating. My children aren’t spoiled with material goods, I want them to learn hard work and humility pays off.” Her fingers flicked, and like soldiers, Laney and Hadrian stood up. The little one smooshed between the pseudo-twins to stand in front of their Mother as their Mama watched intensely, the blonde pulled them all close against her hips. Snape watched Lily’s face blossom red with rage as her eyes glared venomously and protectively. “Money and possessions mean nothing when you’re rich in love.”
Hadrian knew his mothers were only meeting with Lucius just in case, but he was also unsurprised when it turned out to be necessary.
“He talks to her, Suni by the way. We decided if he had a gift that let him talk to snakes that he deserved to have the chance to let his gift flourish. It also helps him to have a confidant that isn’t one of us. Instant bodyguard too. He drapes her over his little sister and instantly she’s kidnap proof if he has to dart away for a minute.” Erin snorted.
Lily would come back to an untouched plate sitting outside the door. The only reason he didn’t throw it was because Tippy would have to clean in. James beat him for the offense anyway when Lily ran downstairs crying.
“I’ve been fine mostly. Seeing the Potters is… distressing at times. And Alexander keeps harassing Laney and I, it is bringing back some unpleasant memories. I’ve been taking it a day at a time however, and I have Suni and Laney with me. I’ll send a letter to mother if anything gets worse or to a degree I can no longer handle.” Laney scowled.
“I don’t know Lily. And I’m not going to chance it until Harry is in our family firmly and we’ve won both the court case and gotten the boys to settle their differences. I won’t risk Harry manipulating Sirius into thinking he needs to get away from us or using Sirius against us. His word in court could be the difference between a loss and winning and Harry is being extremely bitter towards us right now, who knows what he’d tell Sirius to get him to let him stay with those women.”
He looked so different too. Her eyes on a face she didn’t recognize. So tall as well, he’d be taller than his father if he continued growing. With long limbs and creamy pale skin, long dark hair and eyes that weren’t hidden by glasses. So cold. He looked at her as if she were a disliked stranger.
Narcissa frowned, “Dear, you didn’t need to do that. That’s your income!”
Mechanically, Lily dished out dinner into bowls.
“Oh, no dear, your full name is Harrison James Potter actually…”
Hadrian was Harry. Who was his Uncles’ child. Who was his mate.
‘Do go ahead. You’re the expert.’
First was easy, Alex always bothered him at dinner, the only meal all the houses could attend at the same time. Therefore, it was fully in his rights to have his familiar. The fact Suni was under his clothes and basically out of sight was only because she loved skin contact and warmth and certainly not because of the fact the second Alex tapped his shoulder and Suni poked up and glared at him to poking her he jumped nearly a foot in the air and shrieked. His little sycophant follower run cursing up a storm about how ‘slimey snakes needed to die’ ensured disruption of the peace and got them four dentitions a piece for disruption and bullying. The point loss was devastating, but the Gryffindors seemed annoyed but indifferent.
“I’m shaking.” The bland statement mixed with the pure look of boredom on Harry’s face made Draco internally lose his mind. All that came out of his mouth was a garbled and choked laugh. But immediately Laney’s head whipped around from her discussion about vassals and serving families.
-Albus sycophants in Wizengamot will slow proceedings or dismiss charges
A medium, he’d need one for the ritual circle. The only material thing he would need as long as he memorized the words he would need efficiently enough. The wards would scream if Hadrian tried to smuggle the book into his room for guidance, so memorizing was the only option. He should only need chalk or paint, something that would last and not get brushed away by a draft or swirl of magic. Not that his loving ‘father’ would ever give him access to anything like that. After that last visit he’d left Hadrian bloodied up and taken everything useful or studious for him to do, or for him to use against them.
Not Malfoy’s. Not the prince of Slytherin. Just Draco.
Those times were gone now.
He’d tried to apologize and beg Hadrian to forgive him.
Ultimately, pretty useless against most wizards as there was apparation, sleep potions, stunning, and shields. But it filled Hadrian with no small amount of love for her. Letting her care for him. Mother had never been the warmest person alive, but he’d known she cared. It had actually been her that he was closest to. She soothed the past trauma, didn’t force him into talks about feelings or physical comfort, instead she was an anchor. Stable. Forcing him to get up and work on a schedule, taking him to the shooting range with her, teaching him how to be a better person for the people he loved.
“Mr. Potter.” Hadrian didn’t respond at first until the man behind him repeated it again and Draco tugged his sleeve. The five of them turned around and there was the dark man, Professor Snape, Head of Slytherin House. “It would do well to answer to your name, Mr. Potter.”
“Don’t worry about it Lane. They’ll drop off all our luggage, pets included at our dorms once we’re sorted. Unless you have an owl, then they go to the Hogwart’s owlery.” Laney nodded happily, ignoring Draco’s small squawk as she grabbed his hand to hold as they walked. Harry sniggering near silently at the confused expression on Draco’s face.
Malfoy remained silent.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You mind if I hang at your flat for a couple of hours, guys?”
And just like that, she was out the door, and Harry was left alone with his thoughts again.
Ok, maybe he switched out the soft and fluffy towel he had out in the bathroom for a rougher one. But that was it.
Charlie and Malfoy seemed to have strange mannerisms, things they had picked up, little ways to communicate with each other without speaking, something probably learned after years spent together. Harry felt out of place within them. And he was bitter about that. It was his house, he shouldn’t feel out of place. If anyone should, it was Malfoy.
“Believe it or not Potter, not coming down to dinner was a bit of a signal that I don’t want to talk to you.”
Draco remembered the time about two years prior when Charlie had left with almost no notice, and only came back for days at a time over the course of several months for a “family emergency.” Draco suspected that maybe it had been a bit more than a rough patch. “He’s still thick as thieves with all his old school friends.”
Charlie smiled and kissed the top of Harry’s head before pulling himself up and stepping towards the stairs.
Draco didn’t want to talk about it with anyone, and certainly not this man who was everything to him, and who knew nothing about the horrors that had occurred at his own hands.
Malfoy put down his fork, but Charlie placed his hand onto Malfoy’s, and he took another bite before pushing his plate away.
“-school mates,” Theo chimed in.
“I really am sorry, Draco. I know this isn’t how this trip was supposed to go. I’m sure all of this stuff coming out wasnt how you wanted to relax.
God, this is why he didn’t sleep with his friends.
Charlie blushed, and hid his face in his hands briefly.
“You ready?”
“Yeah.”
“Oh, hey! Harry’s hookup!” He placed his hand around Draco’s waist. “You two know each other?”
He still had the jagged scar across his abdomen, though it hadn’t been a full moon at the time.
His hands were shaking, his bottom lip trembled. “Can we just drop it? I don’t want to talk about them.”
“He’s really not so bad nowadays. He always tried to make sure we were as well as we could be when we were stuck at the manor. We’re distant cousins you know, on my mother’s side. So we exchange letters every once in a while. We had tea once when he was eighteen, but he wasn’t doing very well, I don’t think. Wrackspurts everywhere, you know.”
“Oh, yes. Remember Hagrid’s baby dragon from first year?”
“Are you out of your mind, Charlie? I mean have you actually lost it? I am certainly not staying in Harry Potter’s house.”
Harry had taken down an entire wall to get Walburga’s portrait out years ago, but he left the rest of the portraits alone, because they usually stayed quiet.
“Good morning, mon trésor,” he whispered softly, and Charlie’s eyes fluttered open.
So he apparated to right outside the building, stepped in quickly to order a gin and tonic, took a sip, and immediately calmed significantly.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes Draco, you’ve asked four times now. It activates at three.”
Draco was quite frankly, miserable. He was sitting on the hardwood bedroom floor, his back leaned against the door, his hands clutching his ears, trying desperately to block out the world.
One of the reasons his slumber had been so unsatisfying was the quite loud sounds of Potter in his room, fucking someone or other. Maybe it was payback for the couple of times he and Charlie had forgotten to silence themselves, but it was annoying.
He was just about to give a real sigh of relief, when he heard a voice from behind him, and tensed.
Draco let his head drop onto Charlie’s shoulder and groaned. “Please, no.”
“Does one need a reason to talk to his favorite foster brother?”
“And who knows, maybe having someone else in the house will help with the nightmares. I know it’s the physical touch that gets you to sleep, but someone else’s presence might be reassuring. I’ve found that not spending so much time alone helps keep the nargles away.”
The tears were rolling down his cheeks now, and Harry didn’t know how to feel.
“Draco, you know me better than anyone. I’ve spent most of the last three years with you. Sure, you didn’t grow up with me, and you might not know much about my past, but you know the important things inside and out. You know me inside and out. And if that isn’t good enough for my family, then we’ll take our things and leave. Find a nice hotel and stay cuddled up together the whole two weeks. How does that sound, huh?”
“Theo, please correct me if I’m reading this totally wrong, but would you want to go back to my place fore a bit?”
“Marius will cover for me. I’ll even make both the phone calls for you, just stay in bed with me today.”
It wasn’t just his sworn enemies either, he had blown up at those close to him too many times when they were just trying to help, or relate to him.
“What’s his name?”
He thought back to the first time he had fallen into bed with that incredible man. He wondered if he regretted it. He probably should have. He didn’t. Not really.
“What about my first cousin? The metamorphmagus? Where is she buried?”
He laid his hand on Draco’s shoulder gently. It was warm, and somehow comforting, even though Draco was almost definitely about to be threatened.
Draco felt like he’d been punched in the gut. Potter was suddenly getting so angry just as he thought he was starting to make some progress with him. He had been trying to relate to the man’s experiences for Merlin’s sake, but suddenly he couldn’t breathe. The world was spinning again, and his heart was surely about to break out of his chest. He could feel the tears springing to his eyes because suddenly it was all happening again.
Malfoy was bringing back a wave of emotions he hadn’t felt in a long while. Sure, the five year anniversary coming up was fraying at his nerves a little, but this man’s presence was really throwing him for a loop. Hurling him right back into the war. Reminding him of how awful it was. Reminding him of all that had happened. Everything that Malfoy had done himself.
They walked for a while longer until Charlie squeezed his hand and spoke again, I’m a soft voice.
Harry glared coldly at the house elf, who was far too old, and really should have been dead by now. “Please, Kreacher. Just shut up, will you?”
“Hey, Anastasia? Yeah, Draco asked me to call..”
Draco retreated to the back of his mind, feeling numb, his awareness going fuzzy.
Still, it would’ve been nice to have something to do with his time, but there just wasn’t anything he wanted to do, or even could.
“Would you stop thinking so loud?”
“Like, in Harry Potter’s house?”
Have a great day,
“No, you haven’t. I didn’t ask. So you didn’t tell. It was what we did, and looking back it might not have been the best decision, but you never told me that you were an angel in your teenage years. If I had a past like that, I’d want to run away from it, too. Not that I approve of your methods of avoiding your problems. Just saying I understand them.”
Draco walked back over to the bed and burrowed under the comforter, then reached out a hand to brush Charlie’s hair back gently.
He smiled, looking into Charlie’s deep green eyes, and pulled him along, jogging lightly until he pushed the other man into an alleyway and kissed him gently.
“Look, I’ll see how fast I can portkey back to Romania to pack up my flat. I might even be able to get out before you come back.”
First, the Minister handed out medals, to some of the living war heroes. Draco caught a couple of familiar faces amongst the group, Luna Lovegood; that kind of weird girl in the year below him, the Weaslette clutching her left hand. Another redhead; likely a Weasley stood next to a tall and slender woman, white blonde hair cascading down her back. Part Veela, perhaps. The Thomas and the Finnigan boy exchanged a quick kiss on the lips, and smiled warmly at each other. Good for them, Draco thought. A woman who looked too much like a Black not to be his Aunt Andromeda observed the crowd, gaze soft. The remaining Weasley twin and McGonagall stood on the edges of the group.
“You and your little spoiled self don’t get it.”
Draco smiled and quirked his eyebrow. “You are, are you?”
“Yeah,” Harry said, leaning in again before pulling away, his forehead against Theo’s. He panted for a second. “Heads or tails?”
He wondered if he would see Greyback pinning him against the wall of the library at 17 when he walked past. He hadn’t killed Dumbledore himself, and the Dark Lord had been angry. He had thrown Draco in the room with the werewolf.
ok? I don’t want him poking through my shit.”
Your sacrifices cannot be drowned.
It didn’t help. At least not much.
So there he was, watching Charlie doze softly on the bed, and trying to sink into the cold wooden floor and never come out.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Listen, Draco. It’s been five years. This anniversary is important, and you have to start moving past this. I don’t know what happened to you during that war, but it was enough to make you pack up your things and run halfway across the world.”
Not even Charlie.
That was strange. Potter almost always used the bathroom closer to his bedroom, and there was an en suite in Draco and Charlie’s room. That bathroom never really got used.
Felt like longer.
And while it was quite frankly, impossible that Malfoy understood the depths of child abuse, he knew there were people that did. And he could talk to them about it.
“Charlie, just- don’t. Don’t pretend like I’m some sort of good person. I won’t be able to take that. Do you know what kind of things I’ve said? I’ve done? The things I’ve said about your family? About you? That isn’t something you can just let go.”
But he knew he couldn’t do that to anyone. He felt bad enough subjecting his friends to his ups and downs, but a partner? He couldn’t ask that of someone.
“Thank you for coming and commemorating this day with me. Have a wonderful afternoon.”
And Merlin’s beard, Draco Malfoy was going to be staying in his house.
“Charlie, you’re seriously telling me that in the three years you’ve been together, you haven’t told each other your last names?”
Harry apparated them straight into his bedroom, not wanting to deal with Charlie or Malfoy at the moment.
“There are lots of people who are rough around the edges. That doesn’t mean they don’t need people who care about them. I mean, look at half the dragons that come into our sanctuary. They don’t trust us, they can be aggressive, I’ve gotten hurt more times than I can count in this career. But I’ve never doubted that each and every one of them deserves a chance. Deserves our care. Same applies to humans, doesn’t it? You still deserve people who care. I think everyone does. Even the people locked up in Azkaban have families who wanted better for them.”
“Brother, can we blow up a sink?” The little one cooed, Snape marveled as the cold boy he was getting to know smiled again. Hadrian held her head in his hands.
“Blackouts, I go to a boarding school, but I never remember going or coming home. It’s like I don’t exist for nine months, I fall asleep on August 31
“Nothing you wanna know about Papa. I assure you.” Severus looked appalled but the Lord was ducking behind his husband where Draco could hear him snorting with quiet laughter, shoulder’s shaking as he tried to cover it with a cough. Severus glared at him.
“You’re gifted in making explosions.” The near maniacal grin that split the girls face made it difficult to keep a blank and straight composure. Hadrian seemed to have drifted back to reality as well, giving a barely there smirk.
“Obviously, we’re friends with Draco, Vince, and Greg. I would say we get along with pretty much everyone else. I don’t have beef with anyone in particular and Hadrian’s way too chill to really piss anyone off. As for our muggle school, not really? We had friends, but they were more school friends? Like, you hang out at school, but nowhere else? Hadrian has always been my first and best friend, more so after we adopted him.”
“Sara allowed me to claim Hadrian as my godson the other day before I contacted you, I would be more than happy to gift their two daughters the same protection and put them under my care.” Sara gave him a face splitting grin and Erin eyed him up and down before settling down easily. It seemed like approval to him.
Alex and Harry hadn’t gotten along as children, especially when Alex began his tutoring. Harry had always looked at her with such sadness when she had to stop reading to him to work on teaching Alex to read. James hadn’t helped. Not understanding how his sons could be so different from each other, and one so different from him.
“We’re fighting for your son, buck up Sara, we’re winning a battle.” Pushing them both up the stairs, they swept inside to find Erin standing, nearly looming over the Potters and Albus. Glaring quite viciously too.
Five minutes in and he was already homesick. What a disaster he was.
“Draco! I thought you had school?” Draco’s face uncontrollably split into a wide smile. A feral part of his mind purred,
It couldn’t be. Had to be a dream. Had to be a nightmare or trick or
“Of course.” Lucius rummaged through his files.
held the boy tight. He looked at his own father and got a nod from him. Immediately Draco set off to fetch his mother and their lord.
If the boy stuck with them he’d get used to the hurricane that was Laney Dragma.
For a moment, Sirius remembered how it once was. Charles’ puffing smoke behind the desk, bookshelves stuffed to the brim on the wall behind him. A book on heirship in front of two young boys in front of the desk. James had groaned and whined about having to study during the summer. Sirius had barely paid attention. He wasn’t going to be an heir when his mother disowned him in favor of Reggie, so to him it didn’t matter. Sirius blinked back to the present.
Hadrian didn’t think it would matter too much to him if they didn’t remember. The way they had bracketed him between them. How S-Papa would look at him as if he hung the moon, or how Dad would look at him with so much awe and pride. Hissing to Nagini to watch over his prince with all she had. Hadrian knew that even if they couldn’t remember his birth and the year he’d been blessed to have with them, he would be fine. They loved him, and that was more than enough for Hadrian.
“You’re a sap. Come on. Let’s go home. I, think we have more to talk about then we expected.”
“Flipendo!” His first accidental magic.
“You’re just pissed that you can’t find your brains behind your brash courage. My brother is fine where he is and the sooner you accept that the happier we all will be.” Alexander’s temper finally snapped.
“Hadrian.” The blond aristocrat kept his voice soft and nonthreatening as possible. The boy gave a slight nod, his sister was looking worriedly between the two of them. Hadrian blinked. “I promise, I’m not going to let anything happen to you. This will just be some questions to deviate your home life and how you’re doing, okay?”
“Maybe he won’t notice if we bolt to our next class, he can’t try to corner us if he can’t catch us.”
“How can it be so bad here? You’re my brother! You’re supposed to love us! DAD! DAD!”
Thomas, Severus had named their child after him.
Something about that didn’t sit right with her. But, he husband was an Auror, he knew the law better than she did. And she missed her little Harry. Everything would be okay, if Albus and James agreed nothing could go wrong. So, she didn’t question him. Only smiled warmly, brightening as he smiled back.
“I wouldn’t blame you. It happens you know.” Hadrian could see the understanding and between the lines words in Draco’s eyes. The blonde mulled over the words, before he stepped closer to Hadrian.
“Holy, you both look like my brother and don’t look like him at all. That’s a weird line to tip toe and I don’t like it. Still. Wild.”
He had his mother to thank his lungs for at least.
“I’m being attacked Hadrian. I need assistance.”
Hadrian giggled and nearly startled the whole table as he hissed back.
“We should get our robes on. We’re going to be at the school soon.” The train ride was supposed to be hours, but it had only felt like minutes to Hadrian’s surprise and delight. Their robes swished with their steps in the dying evening light as the train slowed to a stop and all the first years were dragged along by a very tall man into river boats. Hadrian felt a dim light of anxiety in his chest as he glanced back at the train. Laney felt the discomfort and granted a small mercy.
“Oh, I’m leaving. And you’re not stopping me.” Alex’s eyes widened, before he began screaming his head off for James. Hadrian only grinned wider. And slapped him. Alex paused with wide eyes.
She might hate him for a while, but she would come around.
“Dibs on not telling our Lord that we’re going to Diagon Alley.”
Next chapter we'll have our great escape! Wonder who's going to get there first ;)
Draco…
The red head glanced around and grinned like a lune when she saw no one, keeping the Cheshire grin locked on. She pointed her own wand at her face and shot herself with a stinging hex. It sent her wand flying and her directly to the ground with a thundering smack.
“The way my aunt and uncle sometimes spoke I think they were. I don’t know for sure though. My mentor let me have her last name when I moved here, it helped keep social services off our back. But, it also means I don’t even know where I’d start looking.”
Draco pushed the thoughts away. His lord and his mother were the first to-dos.
“Brother, I want Italian later tonight. We’ll see you after breakfast Professor.” Laney gave a cheeky grin and blew a kiss before grabbed her brother’s hand and squeezing it lightly. Dragging him off to breakfast as he trapped himself in his head.
Draco looked impressed with his knowledge, giving a nod as if pleased. “You seem to know what you’re talking about. I do hope when you say biological family and ex-brother it means you won’t be hounding to be one of those bumbling Gryffindors. I’d love to see some competent students in a more, respectable house.”
“That’s dumb. Of course, staying hidden is better. My aunt and uncle knew what I was growing up until I got away from them. It was awful… there are good people. But terrible things happen when the wrong people know…” Draco rubbed his hands along Hadrian’s sides, he’d never seen the scars. Hadrian always stayed out of his effortless as much as possible, but that didn’t mean Draco couldn’t infer his life before he’d been taken in by his boss and given a home to reside in. His mentor hadn’t been a parent in the strictest sense. Hadrian didn’t need a parent after the trauma he’d survived. But she had given Hadrian a roof, traded work for a living wage and food on the table, gave Hadrian a culture and heritage to call home.
Cons- Who knows how long I’ll be here
The letters were large and done with a magenta marker, but it was perfect to Hadrian; at the bottom of the paper was a child’s drawing of two stick figures and a yellow squiggle, labeled with their names. Hadrian smiled fondly and pulled out his own parchment as his friends minded their own posts and Laney was reading their other letter.
, but Hadrian walked in from the kitchen and any soft disappointment faded away. Hadrian’s long dark hair was held up in his signature high ponytail, bangs and fringe gently curling around those wide cheeks. A short apron tightened his waist to an impossible angle and hid a good portion of his sinfully tight light blue jeans and his maroon V-neck.
Hadrian gave a pointy grin. That’d work.
“You’re first years, one’s your brother and one is my godson so for tonight I’ll allow this exception. Breakfast is at eight, hurry to bed now.” Laney grinned at all four boys and snickered as they all snuck down the first year hallway to the dorm room. Hadrian rolling his eyes and brushing shoulders with Draco who stared at him with that strange look, flanked by his two vassals.
He didn’t know what the Carotid Artery was, but it seemed important and a turning point as belt lashings and iron burns turned into minor burns and ice skating accidents. Tom briefly remembered Draco mentioning that he’d met Hadrian rollerblading (he spoke as if it were an insult that Hadrian had crashed into him, but he always recounted the tale with the smallest of smiles) and saying he missed the ice. Severus himself mentioned ice skating when he’d peeked into the boy’s mind and saw the snowy forest ice rink in the boy’s mind. Odd for someone of a desert culture, but nothing about Hadrian was completely normal, was it?
"Who is that? With the dark hair on the left side? I meant to ask earlier, but I forgot.”
“I’m afraid it’s unplottable. I can’t help you or the Auror’s Severus. Just trust I will do what is right for the Greater Good.”
Hadrian hid a smirk in Draco’s hair when the blond leaned over to look at his notes.
With that, the two women helped themselves to the floo and vanished with a flash of green. Severus hid his own smile and left the Potters shell-shocked in their chairs while he went back down into the dungeons. He had a few letters to pen after all, and godchildren to check on.
Draco glanced up from his own letter and eyed the staff table with interest, frowning at something that Hadrian couldn’t see. The raven nudged him a bit as Laney collected their replies and waved down one of the post owls with a knut in her hand. Hadrian let his eyes ask his question and the blonde gave him a slightly bewildered smile.
Blood.
Immediately, the door was opened and Potter was shoved inside. The rest wandered inside and listened to Snape’s lecture in a contemplative silence. Watching as he flayed Potter alive with a small hint of amusement. The only thing reaching Hadrian was a note passed from Draco on his left to Laney on his right.
“True enough.”
So Alex not only was responsible for points lost (an extreme 50 points) and detention for a month, Laney was also extremely well liked by quite a few people in all the houses. She was fun loving, and chaotic while still being sensitive and kind. Social rating for Alex plummeted. The most important consequence was one he hadn’t seen coming.
The air rippled softly again and Hadrian’s dark hair pulled up to just below his shoulder, going just a bit darker than his natural hair color and falling in soft and thin waves. His eyes melted into the dark onyx of his Uncle’s and the smirk Hadrian tilted onto his lips was dead on. Tom nearly roared with laughter as Severus sputtered beside him. Even his mother was laughing and clapping delightedly.
“Shh. Sara, it’s okay. No one’s going to take Hadrian from you two. He’s Dragma-Potter on the registry, which means you have a claim on him How you adopted him is binding and legal. He’s your son no matter what lies Albus and the Potters try to feed you. He’s also your son in his heart. He looks to you like you hung the moon and all the stars. I caught him helping Laney pry off room sign to give to his little sister.” Sara gave a water laugh into his collarbone.
James stayed quiet. The judge glared and the brunet grit his teeth agitatedly before resignedly spitting out.
Or, rather, actually cared for him rather than some image procured of him. A fantasy son that would never exist except in the mind of Lily. Nor the monster that James seemed determined to make him out to be. As if he, a grown ass man, was ever in the right to kidnap, torture, and abuse a child that happened to be his biological son.
He could see why they wanted to remember, however. All the little moments had been taken from them. His birth, maybe even his first word, the memory of whoever attacked them and took their little boy away. Made them unable to get him back until all these years had passed.
They’d all clammered over him. Mrs. Anderson had shrieked when he’d passed out suddenly. However Narcissa had taken over and the women had run off to the infirmary, Severus had given him one firm nod and run off to alert the children and keep them calm. Lucius had wished him luck with a hard look in his eyes before following his wife. Sirius had his own ‘errand’ to run.
Finally, the feeling ebbed and faded away, leaving Hadrian a little shaky but otherwise fine. Hadrian opened his eyes to look up at his Dad who froze, he stayed still to let the older man trace the skin just beside his eyes.
Gathering himself up, Hadrian glided up to the stool and sat down as gracefully as he could. Long limbs gave him a lot to practice with that when he’d hit that large growth spurt when he was ten. The hat soon covered his line of sight with the crowd and his mind eased a little bit.
He’d had that exact dream. The dark hair, the wide dark blue eyes. He even knew exactly what stuffed dragon his husband was talking about. It’d been a red dragon because that was the mascot of his mother’s muggle university. He’d had the plushie for years. Severus knew it was in the Prince vault, as it had for many years, but Tom had never seen it to Severus’ memory. He’d wanted to save it, for a child, for a son.
“Amenable. It seems I don’t have to add you to the list. That little prat is still on there though.”
The girl fell silent and glanced at Hadrian, Lucius’ breath caught in his throat. His eyes were nearly glowing, eyes a deep emerald green with a sickly glow that reminded Lucius way to much of his ex-Lord’s favorite curse. “The Potters can crawl into a hole and die for all I care. I don’t want to see any of them.
“Couldn’t your godson ever do things by halves? He couldn’t just have a wizard as his mate, he needed a Metamorphagus Parseltongue. Had to go big or go home.” His Lord looked younger without Dumbledore’s forced grotesque glamour on him. Soft and spiked brown hair and warm tanned skin, the only thing unnatural about him was the blood-red eyes. He mocked disapproval, but there was a bemused tilt to his lips. Sipping tea and sitting down at the kitchen table so calmly. Draco almost could pretend there wasn’t a war. That this was just his family meeting his partner.
He couldn’t love his parents more.
Severus do you know a good barrister?”
people were going to
“What do you want?” Snape rolled over the thoughts in his head. Seems the mildly terrifying anger was on both sides. Good to know. Lily looked cowed however, holding a sulking Potter clone in her arms tight as James frowned deeply.
“Alex is probably still sleeping and dreaming of not being an asshole.”
His Lord and the other adults froze, staring at his son’s hand. Draco paused, giving his mate a quick glance up and down. Hadrian usually morphed the love bites away, so there were no marks. The blonde frowned a little bit in confusion when his uncle and his lord leveled him with twin venomous glares. Draco blinked again, the shimmer of red catching his eye.
It felt like chains had cracked and slipped off his shoulders. Leaving him raw and sore where the shackles had bit into him, but lighter than he’d ever been before. He felt free.
Feeling marginally better about the door (even if he knew it wasn’t actually secure) he took stock. His head was foggy, but there was no damage. Even his leg felt fine. That was good, next. Hadrian searched the room. Parchment, quills and ink in the desk. Useful. Various posters of Quidditch teams he’d never heard of or his brother’s useless books, which he’d never read. Not useful. A rug, warm at least, if James took away his sheets. Bed that was crimson and mussed up from his wake up call. Window, but he was high up in the Manor, he’d break his legs. Crawling was a last resort, but not one he was above using if he had to. His closet held clothes of differing sizes and varying amounts of use. Thrift stores? Hadrian grimaced as he amended the statement. Hand me downs from his brother.
“Not a bad idea. Crabbe and Goyle are already down in the hall.” Hadrian sighed and just decided to skip the robe as Suni cheekily rested her head on his shoulder. At least she let him put on a tank top and pants. “Are you going to walk around like that.”
“I had a dream that we had a son once. He had Severus’ hair, and my eyes, the color before I was devoted to the dark arts. I don’t remember his name, but it had felt so real. I could vividly see him playing with Nagini on the floor with a stuffed dragon that had a handkerchief. I almost thought it was real when I’d woken. I think…. If we ever did have a son. I think he’d look a bit like young Hadrian does.” Severus squeezed his bicep, ignoring the twinge that screamed in the back of his head.
‘No, he wasn’t. Laney was a little bit. She was just neurotic and didn’t care about other people’s opinions of her though.’
Holding her closer to his chest, he smiled. Eyes burning, though no tears leaked out. His vision was so bad enough it wouldn’t have mattered too much anyway. Something was hot in his chest, aching and blistering, worse than any broken rib he had, but it was addictive and sweet.
As always you got questions, comments, ideas? Plop em right in the comments. I don't always respond due to college, but I try to answer and read each one!
Alex sat down on the stool with a small glance at the side. Hadrian’s friends had all been thrown to the snakes! It was perfect, when he was in his rightful house with Alex he’d see how he was supposed to act. Right now, standing there on his own, he already looked so much better, his posture was still straight, but his hands tucked into his pockets. Shoulders back with easy and powerful grace. He wasn’t more powerful than Alex, but having some intimidation to back him up was always good. That’s why Draco ran with Crabbe and Goyle after all. He almost reminded Alex of Uncle Sirius.
“You’re a little tanner, but not unrecognizable from how you looked before. Would you like to see?” Hadrian nodded swiftly, letting his father, Dad, (Having two fathers was slightly confusing with titles, he could finally sympathize with his sisters in the homeland with multiple mothers) support him to the bathroom. The Malfoys stayed quietly in the kitchen. Hadrian peered into the mirror.
“Hadrian?” The brunet blinked, looking to his side and stepping back when he saw Draco on one knee. A box in his hands being wrung with the blonde’s jittery hands. Hadrian covered his mouth with his hands. “I’ve known you for so many years and loved you through all of them. The little arguments, the sass, the snark, the sweet, the nights in the doghouse. When I woke up on my sixteenth birthday at Hogwarts, your name on my lips and your love on my mind, I wasn’t even surprised. I knew you’d be the one I would spend my entirety with. For life and beyond death. I want to love you for all of it. For the rest of our lives. Hadrian Dragmire, now Hadrian Thomas Prince, will you marry me?”
The raven tightened his ponytail and gave himself one last glance in the mirror. He really did look sharp. A white button up paired with a liquid black vest that clung to him like a second skin, Draco had fitted him with a sleek tie that matched his eyes and slacks that hugged all the right places. He looked good. (And his ass looked fantastic).
“It seems the Headmaster would like a word with Hadrian today after breakfast. However, he said nothing about informing you as his sibling. We will endeavor there after you two and I eat.” Laney frowned.
“Ask your son, his best friend’s father is the best lawyer in wizarding Britain. However, I am rather close with Malfoy senior as well. I’d be happy to give him your address and arrange a meeting if need be.”
“They’ll never figure out her hissing is whining to be pet.”
“Okay James… we’ll wait to connect Sirius. Can Albus help us?”
“Ah, the anxiety disorder? Not a problem, of course his sister may join.” Sara relaxed again and Severus hid a smile, still sitting beside Lucius. “I hope they won’t try to use it against you or him, however mental health studies are slightly archaic in the Wizarding World. So I hope Potter won’t be depraved enough to dig, if push comes to shove however would Hadrian be comfortable to simply be assessed by a Mind Healer? A muggleborn named Ted Tonks, he would serve as an expert testimony to help keep Hadrian out of Potter’s hands. Only if they pursue legal action that is.” Sara nodded.
Then he’d lit up and she’d seen her little boy again. Only this time he was in the arms of actual strangers. Holding a child that wasn’t his sister and treating her with all the tenderness he’d rejected showing his real brother. Looking up to women who weren’t
“I will do whatever you want because you’re my precious angel.” Mother sighed.
“It’s not that rare.” His voice was smooth and level, the blonde blinked quickly, staring intently as Hadrian leaned his head back. Stretching his shoulder’s back elegantly and confidently as Mother taught him commanded attention and consideration. “My biological family were all Gryffindors. I’m certain my ex-brother will be vying to go to their family house. The Weasleys are another traditionally Gryffindor house hold, like the Lovegoods are traditionally Ravenclaw. Many old wizarding families in Britain have family expectations.”
Outcast at home, outcast at school. There's never been a break for him. Not for the Freak of the Dursley house, until unexpected people brings pasts to light and suddenly. It seems that he finds the chance he'd been waiting his l I f e for.
All that was left to do was wait.
, so we joke that we’re pseudo-twins. Both of us just turned eleven last month.” Draco nodded thoughtfully.
It was lonely, it hurt.
It went on and on, Tom felt dizzy and sick as he kept reading and the pages kept scrolling on, giving basics before going into graphic detail of every injury. Burns, hit with frying pans, hit with a belt, fists, glass, starved. Tom held onto his son and husband tighter, but blocked their view of the paper as he read on.
Though, as a Veela, Draco only had one mate for the rest of his life. It made sense that he was unafraid of commitment, especially with someone he already felt attached too. Severus smiled into his coffee. The adoring looked Hadrian kept sending at Draco made his feel reassured that his godson was in good hands. Lucius leaned forward.
Severus gently brushed his fingers through her hair. More shouting was beginning to echo down from the room. Along with a cold rumble that sent shivers down his spine. “No one will take your son. Sounds like your wife is going to freeze everyone with sheer will power.”
The feast was brilliant, even if Hadrian had to glare at Laney to keep her in line with her dietary restrictions. They had a merry time all the way until they were being called to be escorted to their dorms in the dungeon. Hadrian gently tugged on Draco’s arm, gaining the other boy’s attention easily. The brunet jerked a head towards the long head table.
Both of their heads whipped back when the floo flared. Severus rushed out and past them without a backwards glance toward them. “Albus was at the school, but he’s claiming that he never saw Hadrian after the court room. He locked himself in his rooms before Minerva or I could question him otherwise. I’ll be looking around once I get back there. Has anything new happened on this end yet?”
“I’m Draco Malfoy, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle. I’m going to be a Slytherin, what house do you think you’ll be?” Laney’s tight red curls bobbed in the corner of his eye and he looked at Draco’s face. Sharp silver eyes. Hadrian paused, watching as they continued to converse.
Faith in the savior? Gone. Belief that he was righteous and good? Destroyed.
“Oh, I know you hate James Potter, Hadrian wrote me a letter nearly hysterically laughing about how much you hated the Potters. Said he saw it, James was a cruel git to my son growing up and Hadrian remembers
“That doesn’t explain why I’m holding a Kit-Kat.”
“Don’t worry about that Lily-flower. Just spruce up Harry’s new room. We’ll be teaching him what it means to be a Potter whether he likes it or not. All children have a rebellious phase after all. Harry can’t be led astray by the dark. Alex needs to defeat the Voldemort and having Harry on our side is paramount according to Albus. Alex adores Harry already, so it will be wrestling Harry into not being so difficult and teaching him to that family comes first.”
I figured I'd update because I work open to close tomorrow! Enjoy! (Also Imma ask for help picking which fic I work on next so be on top for that my friends)
“Why don’t you go work on his room, I’ll clean up dinner.” Lily smiled at him and left the table, hurrying up the manor stairs. James heaved a sigh and started gathering the plates. Muttering to himself softly. “The thing needs to die. If I have to kill Harry at the right time to give Alex a chance to live and defeat the Dark Lord as Albus says. Then Lily is simply going to have to live with the fact Voldemort ensured that the boy’s soul was damaged tainted beyond repair. His sorting proves what I’ve always known. His life isn’t worth the thousands of lives his death will save.”
Hadrian had a weird feeling about this.
-I might get to hex James/Alex
Something a bit lighter and funnier before we start getting into the climax of the fic! (I got plans like you wouldn't believe my friends >:)
“Ah, they network so young these days. Yes. I’d like that very much Severus.” Severus smirked.
This would be a nightmare without her. All the people. The fact that for the first time in
“Really? Last I checked I’m the one who grew up with him. Oh my god this is a Twitches moment, isn’t it?” Hadrian snorted, a rather undignified sound, but it made Draco smile before listening mesmerized by the low, smooth drawl that left Hadrian’s mouth.
“That’s rich coming from you Malfoy.”
“That’s… awful. That’s like Urbosa wanting me dead when I was declared to have a dark affinity. Magic is of the soul and the body, morals of evil and good are of the heart and mind. They have no link besides how you use them together. The most evil king in our history was a light sorcerer, our greatest had no magic at all. Why would he want you dead?”
The hat seemed to give a pleased hum at not being shoved any particular way and shouted loud and clear.
“Welcome to the family, Hadrian. I’m glad my son found his one so easily.” Draco swept Hadrian’s long hair off his shoulder absentmindedly when Hadrian sat back down. Which Nagini seemed to take as an invitation to slither up onto Hadrian’s shoulders. His Lord stiffened, hissing.
Eventually, they finally ended their trip at Gringotts. Draco was nearly vibrating with excitement. Hadrian just rolled his eyes and dismissed his hyperness easily enough. His mother and their lord decided to go to some of the clothing shops, he could hear them debating color schemes the moment they had separated. Uncle Sav and his father had decided to accompany the boys to get Hadrian’s test. Because of the Malfoy status at the bank they were given a private room to get the test. It was a rather easy one. Hadrian was given a dagger and instructed to place seven drops of blood into the quill so it would begin to write on the various pieces of parchment.
Narcissa whistled low and smiled. “He’s as pussy whipped as you were when you and I started courting.” Lucius smiled weakly. Until his Lord also smiled, the look was distant and far away.
“Hadrian, where’s your shirt?”
“Those two don’t, I have a black owl named Akumu. He was my mother’s but she got him when I was a baby and he imprinted of me, so she gifted him to me when I was ten so I could send my own letters. I wanna meet Hadrian’s snake though, what breed is it?” The long hair brunet answered for his sister.
“Yes dear?”
Escape Myself
“I’ll stick to the basics because you’re more familiar with Dicai Wizarding Traditions, but in the British World. Which, do you remember any of that from school?” Hadrian sighed.
Hadrian and Laney both frowned, Hadrian stayed quiet though as Laney was more vocal about her displeasure. “He’s my brother, a Dragma, he’s only Potter because it’s illegal for me to beat some sense into the Ministry of Magic. By the way, is that one person or many I’ll have to beat up if it continues on like that.”
Hadrian tightened his grip on his wand. Lily flinched again and tried to entice him closer with open arms.
Hadrian gave a low chuckle, “I can’t say I have given it much thought. I think I’d rather like Slytherin or Ravenclaw. If I were trapped with my ex-brother in a common room I think I’d be sent to Azkaban within the hour for madness and attempted murder.” The blonde laughed loud and uncontrolled for half a second.
The next morning when Severus stumbled out of their bedroom, he was caught by Draco before he could even ask their host for the location of the nearest coffee shop. He glared at his godson grumpily who just rolled his eyes.
“Hadrian’s making a pot of coffee now, this conversation first. I need help.” Severus was wide awake. “It’s not big. Well, I think it is, but Hadrian has memory problems. Like he doesn’t remember months of his life, and something about it gives me a bad feeling and he won’t listen to me. So, I was wondering if…”
“Oh.” Hadrian opened his mouth, but it almost looked as if he choked on air before he clamped his mouth shut and drew his legs up to his chest. One hand beginning to tug anxiously at his ponytail and his gaze settled just over Lucius’ shoulder, glassy and unfocused.
“Haden’s mine! Go ‘way!” The little girl burrowed her head into Hadrian’s collar and Alex was gifted with a poisonous glare from his biological twin. But just before a fight could break out and Dumbledore could intervene their mother straightened.
“He’ll visit if that’s what he wants. And only what he wants. I won’t force my son to see the people who abandoned him.” With that the two women brushed out of the office. Severus and the Potters hot on their heels where outside the office Severus had to smother the chuckle that threatened to escape.
. Tutoring in most subjects was done by year,
A small thud from upstairs caught their attention, and Hadrian got up. Moving into the kitchen, presumably to start breakfast. Draco following like a love-sick dog at his heels. Cissa smiled into her mug.
Which, if he had a choice he’d follow her to the day he died, so wig.
Worst case scenario. He’s caught, hides the broken wand and uses it to slit his wrists.
“The twins are doing well in my care. I was short a bed on the first night. But it seems Laney and Hadrian made friends with my godson earlier in the day and they had no problem sharing a room until another bed could be procured for Laney in the dorms. Draco seems rather thrilled to have brought the two into his friend group. However, Suni has been terrorizing some of the students by, opening doors at random?” Sara snorted.
And James wand flew out of his hands into Sirius’ where he snapped it with barely a thought before forcing James to his knees at wand point. “Now, before I arrest you and Albus, I get to do this. WHY?! WHY DID YOU HURT MY GODSON?! HOW COULD YOU DARE LAY A HAND ON AND ABANDON YOUR OWN SON YOU WORTHLESS PIECE OF SHIT!”
Well, that was one way to announce their arrival. A barely there look of scolding crossed his eyes, before he painted on his blank mask. Hand still clutched in Laney’s, his chest froze though. A bubble filling his throat and leaving him dizzy and breathless. He couldn’t do it. Oh god. God. God. Laney squeezed his hand. And stepped to break his line of sight easily and protectively. Snape stood steadily behind him as the world spun slowly.
Hadrian squeezed his eyes shut.
They were right, it was still him. His skin was still tanned, but now it seemed more natural and less like it was just Hadrian staying in the sunny restaurant all day. His hair had changed from a dark brown to a glossy black, the only flecks of color was the slight sheen of brown when the light hit his hair just right. His eyes were the most different part, they went from that vibrant green to a dark and endless blue like an ocean.
“Annabee is just plain smitten with her brother, he could say the sky was green and she’d adamantly defend him against anyone who tried to say it was blue.”
“Yes. God, Dray, yes. I’d always marry you.” Draco grinned, a hysterical laugh bubbling up as he grabbed Hadrian in his arms and spun him around until they were both dizzy. Hadrian looked up at him and let his morph bleed away, uncaring of the scars as he kissed his
Now Alexander was bearing the full-frontal assault of the Twin Terrors of Gryffindor.
Morosely, she set the table just as the floo sounded and she perked up with a quick, but weak, smile. Her husband came strolling into the dining room, still wearing his Auror robes and his brown hair windswept gorgeously. He gave her a heart stopping smile, looking behind his glasses with warm hazel eyes. At least some things would never change. A quick kiss and then they both sat down to their dinner before Lily pounced.
“James?”
“Suni wouldn’t let him get dressed. It’s a Saturday anyway so, it’d probably be more exhausting to try and fight her on it.” Severus reached into his desk drawer and threw it at the half naked eleven-year-old. The raven shrugged it on without a single complaint, not even flinching as Severus shrunk it to fit him snuggly with a flick of his wand. Laney sniggered behind her brother’s shoulder, only smirking when Severus gave her a withering glare. Sara was all over them quickly enough, checking on them and kissing their cheeks. Lucius watched a little surprised as neither preteen tried to squirm away from her affections as many older children did, only basking in it. It was refreshing after three years of Draco’s ‘I’m a big boy’ attitude at being ‘coddled’.
The twins tormented his brother merrily for the rest of the month until they were in the beginnings of December. Each prank more humiliating and hilarious than the last. Until anger finally simmered down into distrust and dislike. Suspicion was also off the Dragma twins as Alex finally stopped screaming about how Laney set him up. (Dumbledore tried to back his savior up, but by the time anyone thought to check their wands it was too little too late and all that was on Laney’s prior incanteum was incendio spells).
Finally, he grit his teeth and
Having only James and herself at home again was nice, but she missed her son.
Draco’s shock spread into a deep grin. “There’s some Slytherin ambition, you had me worried for a second Dragma. I knew that goody-goody light family had to have some closed doors nonsense.”
“Perhaps I’ll talk to Uncle Sev after classes today, we can’t spend the rest of first year hiding in various alcoves and being sandwiched by Vince and Greg, as much as your protection is appreciated.” The boys grunted in agreement as Laney patted their arms. Her wavy auburn hair fanning out behind her.
The brunet was dragged by his ear by an irate and infuriated potions professor as Draco hurried over to his sister. Holding her wand which no one bothered to check, the sparkle in her eyes was full force. Yes, a beautiful job well done. Laney put her thumbs up for him to see from the library and whooped with glee when Greg piggy backed her to the infirmary. A month and a half until the court day left.
The only thing that held him back from lunging at the little prat was the pain in his leg, the fear of death, and James Potter glaring at him as if daring him to disobey. As it stood, Hadrian found it easier at each meal to ignore the food and everyone there. Let himself waste away and laugh as the ones who ‘loved’ him. Simply watched it happened.
This was coming home. Staying home.
but Laney had wanted to see him at least once a week since… then. So, his feet had dragged him out of his cupboard and came back to her as promised. Blood was dripping from a cut on his eyebrow, dripping into his eyes. His skin was almost white as a ghost, tainted with water color purple bruises over his jaw and arms, breathing hurt. He looked like death walking. Laney had grabbed his hands as he stayed silent. Fury lit in her blue eyes like a raging inferno, it shrieked and screamed like a dragon, almost too big for her body, bulging at the seams. His hands were bloody and ice cold in hers.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you Hadrian.” The crooked grin looked so innocent in that moment that Draco almost laughed hysterically as Hadrian grabbed her hand with both of his.
It was an even sweeter feeling when any fear of disappointing his parents faded. His mothers, his
“Haden! Haden!” Alex’s chest burned when that gained the first ever full blown smile he’d ever seen from his twin in all of their days together at home and now at school. It didn’t feel fair. He was his brother. He should get Harry’s smiles. His attention and doting. Instead, he watched as his taller brother curled around and coddled the tiny girl with his whole body, sharing his space with both girls that were
“The hot dish!” Hadrian immediately was out of his seat, uncaring of the human-sized snake curling across his waist and shoulders like a sash. Draco sighed dreamily as the adults eyed the boy warily in the kitchen.
James gave him a dark look, hauling up the trunk stuffed with all the parchment, quills and ink in the room. Leaving no books or utensils behind. “Perhaps if you have time to do nothing but reflect. You’ll realize how good you have it by even being welcomed back into this house.”
“Hadrian. Leandra. Go play with your friends. I need to talk to your professor.
“Met him. Didn’t like him. His ego crowds a room. Thought you didn’t want to associate with a bunch of
“Alexander has been on the list for years.” Snape furrowed his brows and Draco blinked.
“The password to his office.”
“Don’t worry about it Hadrian, not like these guys are big talkers either and at least you got the intelligence and competence to pull it off. I’m more surprised no one’s ears are bleeding from that harpy. She could have at least knocked. It’s only polite.” Draco checked the scenery and looked into the hallway.
Dumbledore cleared his throat, “Yes, I see. You mentioned Alex was quite upset when he met his brother again after so long. Do you know what happened?”
It took ten minutes for them to get ready and another ten to drag Laney out from her dorms. (Another five to get her to stop mooning at his bare arms and making suggestive comments. Draco pointedly tried not to stare at what were some nice biceps for a preteen). They made it to breakfast on time however and sat next to Crabbe and Goyle on the end. Marissa was on Laney’s lap mewing up a storm and demanding bacon from his sister’s plate. Hadrian hid a smirk. Simply eating and relaxing until the post came swooping down. Draco got his customary letter from his parents and Laney grinned as a letter from one of the postal owls dropped into his hands.
Their reputation untainted and in the clear from the hurled accusation, Hadrian had two weeks to figure out the plan to end his brother’s beloved social life and turn it into a PR nightmare when Alex did all the work for him.
“You must call me Sara then! I’m very thankful to Severus for suggesting we meet and more thankful to you for coming. My own son has only glowing reviews about your son, and my daughter is no doubt terrorizing him. I apologize for that.”
Hadrian’s own presence was quieter, like a calm stream without a sound, it soothed Draco’s still sensitive capacities as an empath. His hair was pulled into a sleek and long high pony tail, falling smoothly down his spine, the only hint of any messy curls was nestled under his ponytail and the baby hairs that skewed down his hairline and the gentle curves on Harry’s fringe and bangs. Harry’s eyes were a bright and intelligent green, with a tall and lithe figure that spoke of grace and easy elegance. Not standing out like a peacock, but still commanding respect and attention.
Throwing one last torture curse at Hadrian, the raven bit back a scream with a gasp. Body convulsing on the ground until James disappeared around the corner and Hadrian coughed wetly. Dragging in harsh breaths. Hadrian reached for the pieces of his broken wand and pulled them close to his chest. Not daring to move his leg.
Still, he limped to the window and peeked out. Heart dropping into his stomach, swirling with ice cold nausea. Outside was two familiar figures on brooms flying around the Quidditch pitch. Large hoops loomed on either side bearing large banners with the Gryffindor crest displayed proudly besides the Potter family crest.
“Good morning love,” Hadrian smiled. Draco grumbled but smiled back. Glancing around the room at all the adults before his mate handed him a cup of coffee with his left hand. Right still clutching his half eaten pastry.
His beautiful flower always did.
“I think I graduated, no one came to pick me up this year like the last few years. It’s been relieving.”
“Forgot to warn you guys about that, sorry. If you can lock Hadrian’s dorm room Suni can’t open locks. You’ve no idea the frights I’ve gotten at three am when I heard a slam in the kitchen and found Suni attempting to pry the pantry or the fridge open.”
She was a true task master. In charge of his physical therapy and healing, she pulled no punches. Forcing him to do his exercises daily and dragging his ass into doing the most helpful and horrid things imaginable. Whether it was forcing him to walk up and down the manor stairs until he was shaking from the effort, or tossing him into the pool with his arms bound and a bubble head charm to get him to tread water with his bad leg. He probably wouldn’t have healed as completely if it weren’t for her firm but well intentioned love.
The yellow and white boa snickered and slithered up her master’s chest. More firmly pushing herself into his jaw and affectionately scenting it. That was the second time his therapy had been brought to his mind. He doubted the headmaster would let him leave the school, however. He’d continue in the summer, and if it got worse he’d talk to Laney.
“He’s claiming there’s no way we can support three children without an inheritance, but we’re fine! I can prove it! We live in a safe neighborhood on base, the kids had activities, they went to school. They never wanted for food or clothing or love… I don’t want them to take my baby.”
Nothing seemed to be going his way that morning. He stepped in the shower only to find that there wasn’t hot water left, he cut himself shaving, and stained one of Sirius’ old t-shirts that he wore with his toothpaste.
And so, trying anything he could to make things better, a year later he had gone to Diagon Alley to ask Ollivander about wandmaking apprenticeships, and fled the country.

“I’m spending two weeks with my family. My foster brother’s going to speak at the ministry and we’re having a small memorial for my little brother. I’m leaving in three days.”
Charlie pulled out his wand, and murmured something under his breath, and soon a large black townhouse was emerging from between two others, making the ground shake around it. The muggles around them didn’t seem to notice.
Sirius Orion Black
“Maybe,” Charlie muttered, but then his lips were on Draco’s neck, and his fingers were dancing across his waist and Draco’s breath hitched, lost in the feeling, almost forgetting how completely fucked up this was. But not entirely.
Happy early Rosh Hashanah to all my fellow Jews! :)
Draco turned away from Charlie’s side of the bed. He didn’t even know what had happened to Draco during the war, and Draco only knew bits and pieces of Charlie’s story. That was part of the agreement. They didn’t have to talk about their pasts.
Draco’s eyes widened. “Excuse me?”
Retreating into his own head was the only way he could calm himself down sometimes, and he didn’t fancy starting to sob on a random street corner in the middle of London.
Malfoy seemed to deflate at this, almost collapsing with a sigh of relief. So did Harry. It seemed neither of them wanted to be alone with the other. “Yeah, of course. That’s fine. Happy to have you, Charlie.”
So he thought he should probably…apologize.
Draco did not complain as they walked back out into the street, though his face was quite a bit redder than it was when they had entered.
“…Yeah. Love you. Bye.”
Draco just groaned and turned father away from his boyfriend.
Hermione picked up a book and hit the back of her friend’s head. “You didn’t even ask Charlie his name, Harry?”
Then she stepped off the stage, and gave Potter and Weasley a hug before he seemed to take a shaky breath, and walk to the front to make his speech.
Malfoy swatted at Charlie’s arm and glared at him. “Shut up.”
“Oh yes I am. This is where he was supposed to stay, and it’s where he’s staying. You think he’d be better received at the Burrow?”
“You’re just nervous,” he said, and kissed the top of his boyfriend’s head. “I get it, you haven’t been in the country for a long time, but it’s nothing to worry about, I swear. My family and friends are some of the kindest people you’ll meet, and you can hide away with my foster brother all you like.
“I think Fred would actually appreciate that.”
Everyone clapped. And cheered. Really Draco thought it was far too loud, but he was tired. And he wanted to leave.
“It was a lapse of judgment! And you didn’t ask for his either, now can you explain the situation to me again.”
CW for brief mention of past suicide attempt and descriptions of eating disorders and disordered eating habits
He couldn’t quite place it at first, but after a few seconds, his face broke into a smile.
As he paced through the living room, Charlie caught his wrist gently and pulled him into a warm embrace. Draco was tall, but Charlie was one of the only men he had met who was taller. His rough, muscular figure enveloped Draco’s pale and thin body, and he relaxed marginally under the familiar touch.
He was cranky, and frantically combing through his flat to pack his things before they left. The international portkey hadn’t been easy to get on short notice, but Charlie held a small mint tin in his pocket that would send them to the British Ministry of Magic at 3:00 exactly.
“You do realize you should be hexing me inside out right now? Not offering me shelter? I’ve lied to you for years. You understand that, right?”
“I know you don’t want to do this, but I promise you we can come right back after it’s over.”
“How was your shower?”
Malfoy looked baffled. “Wait, why?”
And Merlin, Draco had forgotten about that in all the drama of the evening. He really shouldn’t have been doing this. Like, really shouldn’t have been doing this.
“Charlie, I can’t just..”
For two weeks.
As they walked down a small, dark street lined with townhouses, Draco had stopped talking. His heart was deciding to skip beats again, and each step only built up the pressure he felt.
Draco looked at the other man, puzzled. “What is it?”
“Explain the situation to me again, Harry. Because this is all really hard to wrap my head around.”
“Really?”
“Thank you, my dear. I’m gonna go shower. See you in a bit!”
“As I’ll ever be.”
“You’re worth it, Draco. You’ve always been worth it. I wouldn’t still be here if you weren’t. You can ask Harry, I don’t chase after things I don’t really want. I don’t settle.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Even if you were a father, I really don’t think you’d be the ‘world’s best.’”
Sure, he would love to give Malfoy a good yelling at, but he didn’t really feel the urge to slice him open anymore, which Hermione would say was progress.
“-I don’t want to visit them, Charlie.” His voice was shaky, but he didn’t care.
What in the hell had Charlie managed to say to him for him to be letting Draco stay in his house?
He held onto his bags a little bit tighter, and in an instant, he was standing in Great Britain for the first time in three years.
Draco hadn’t gotten horribly drunk that night. He had only had about 3 drinks before Charlie had asked him if he would go back home with him. Draco had agreed.
Now you see, that in itself wasn’t odd. Harry knew of course that Malfoy was staying there. But when he looked at Malfoy, he couldn’t turn his eyes away. Because he was so different from every other time Harry had seen him.
“-I adore you in fact, you might even be my favorite brother.”
Maybe he would nap.
“Potter.”
“Depends, you think you can get to sleep at all tonight?”
They had been together for 2 years now, Luna had moved into Ginny’s flat several months ago, and they were the epitome of a picture perfect couple. Harry knew he was technically actively avoiding that by refusing to have any ‘romantic’ endeavors past one night stands, but he had to admit it was something he longed for.
Harry’s hand seemed to reach out on its own, to catch his wrist.  “Malfoy, I-“
“-nice to see you, yeah.”’
“Maybe, Lu.”
Harry froze, because he didn’t exactly want Malfoy to know he was unemployed. But he couldn’t just lie, Charlie would call him out on it.
“No clue.”
“You need to face it, Draco. It happened. And it’s been five years.”
He was too busy staring at the man at the door, and listening to his heart beat so loud he was sure they could hear it. He couldn’t control the words coming out of his mouth, but without his consent he was choking out a name.
“Perfect. Severus, send for the twins?” A flick of his wrist sent a brilliantly white doe sprinting across the study and past the closed door. Sara was biting her lip nervously and twiddling her thumbs until the door gently creaked open and Lucius studied the new occupants of the room carefully.
Those kids were gone now.
“This would all be fixed in Hadrian let me beat him up.”
Godparents in wizarding society were as good as third or fourth parents to a child. They held nearly all the same parental rights to any child under their care. It was the reason their mothers were pleased that Severus took all three of them as his godchildren, it meant in the event of their passing Severus was next in line by the eyes of Magic. And Magic wasn’t to be trifled with in the matters of children. The fact that the Potters had denied visitation and custody to someone who
Ignoring his brother and leaning into that red haired little girl with the loud-mouth.
A sigh echoed through the halls, “Maybe you’ll feel better for dinner.” And her footsteps echoed down the hall.
“My father’s here at school apparently. I wonder where he is, and why?”
Hadrian glanced down at his hand. Proof of his lover’s devotion, to his parents and their proud eyes on him. To him and how he now resembled them again.
“It started with a disagreement about revealing ourselves to the muggle world and it escalated.” Hadrian scrunched his nose.
“Suni, Hadrian, how are you this morning?” Suni scented Draco affectionately, but refused to move off of her human. Choosing to be difficult and force the raven to squirm out of his pajamas, Suni unhelpfully constricting to keep her balance.
“Mama, it was one sink!” Laney didn’t look a bit remorseful
Happy thoughts. Focus.
. This was the first step into learning and growing into his magic, this is where all his possibilities would blossom and grow.
Hadrian held back a scoff. As if she didn’t always do that anyway, even before he escaped the hellscape that was this family. James rounded on him the second her footsteps disappeared, snatching the lists of Hadrian’s desk and hissing viciously. “What’s this?”
Summer wasn’t over just yet.
“You’ll get as much therapy as you want baby boy. As much as you want.”
“You didn’t walk in on them Laney.”
“Show me.” Hadrian didn’t bother to fight it, ignoring the gasps and the small sharp sob from Draco as he pulled down his small morph. Nothing changed, except the smoothness of his skin. Now there were scars marring him horribly, not many that could be seen as most were on his back or his limbs. He still grimaced as Severus, one of his fathers, traced the thick and gnarled scar across his neck. Fingers deftly sweeping back up, the tiny scar the cut the upper left of his lip, the long line under his left eye. All three caused by the same beer bottle that Uncle Vernon had sent hurtling at his head. The long and faded scar on his forehead was much smoother, nearly healed and unseen beneath his hairline.
School will never be dull again.
"Shut up.”
God, he hoped they hadn’t touched his mothers. There would be more hell to pay that getting a vase chucked at their head if they had.
Hadrian looked to him, almost as misty-eyed as his uncle as his voice cracked. “I had living parents, and they sent me to live with
Unbidden, Hadrian felt a deep longing for the massive mint green sweater in his real trunk. It was XXL, with cotton that was beginning to pill, and a cute pig face stitched into the corner. He’d had it for as long as he could remember knowing Laney. She’d give it to him the first day she’d found him shivering on a curbside, trying to keep him warm. Annabee also loved the sweatshirt, always crawling into the folds whether he was in the shirt or not. His little clingy honeybee and his chaotic twin. Suni usually dozed in the front hanging pocket, as much as she could anymore now that she wasn’t a one foot baby anymore.
Tom gave a smile and leaned into Severus, Draco pressed a kiss onto Hadrian’s temple as the oven dinged.
Sirius blinked and refocused.
“Naturally. Desert will be done soon too. If you’re lucky, I let you keep the extras.”
The shorter woman gave him a sweet smile, “Call me with that lawyer’s number. It’d be nice to meet Draco’s father. Hadrian and Laney positively gush about the lad. If that’s all, expect all these ‘meetings’ to stop. I’m considering you a threat to our family and I will file a restraining order if you push me or my son. Good day.”
And Hadrian knew no more than the dark surrounding him.
“Oh? Then you will have no issue with me lawyering up then. Just for precautions. Can never be to careful when someone’s trying to
Night had finally fallen when Hadrian felt safe to crawl out of his hiding spot. Earlier James had angrily pounded on the door when he’d ignored the call for dinner and Alex had whined at him from the door. But Lily had warded them away with soft words. She didn’t let him eat either however, saying nothing when James told the elves that he either ate with them or not at all.
No. NO.
“It was so real. It had felt so real. It was real, is real.” Immediately Hadrian was swept up and crushed into the other man’s arms. Sandwiched comfortably between the two lovers as Tom hovered over both of the shorter men. His princes. The most important men in his life, Tom still stared, as if his senses were lying to him. Like Hadrian was going to vanish if he blinked. “Why can’t I remember you?”
“Oblivate.”
was proud.”
What.
“No one thinks of the weird shit that happens, only the cool things.”
“It’s common knowledge how much the Potter’s value family and their children. The Potter’s quite obviously love their son, and they love Harry just as much. Any actions made were regrettable, but it was all to protect what they thought was a squib sibling from dark wizards that targeted the family. If you believe in the love of family, you’ll return young Harry to his parent’s loving arms and let him learn to regain his place in his rightful family.” As Albus sat down, Lucius smoothly got to his feet. Hair neatly pulled back.
Remus had stayed behind the second they’d gotten the letter. Packing up their house, preparing to move back to Britain if only to be close to him again. Sirius was ready to work his ass off to find his godson and then spend the rest of his life on his knees begging him and his new family for forgiveness and for a second chance. Severus, Lucius, and Mrs. Dragma had been prepping him on barging into Potter man and searching the place when there was a crack and Mrs. Anderson had run out the door.
“The Potters threatened to sue for Hadrian’s custody yes.” The room got so quiet you could here a feather falling. The red haired girl fell silent, mouth slightly agape with wide and shocked eyes locked onto him. Hadrian’s eyes were just as wide, terrified as his body remained stiff as a board, knuckles white where they clutched at his sister.
“Where’s your husband Severus?” The dark-haired man snorted and glanced at the clock. “Ah, well, I’ll wait a bit before starting breakfast then. How did you two sleep?”
"Wimp.”
“Be quick, Hadrian wait with your sister for your other sister. I’m in the room across if you need me. I’ll be right out once we drag your godfather out of his lab or his rooms. Then we’ll choose where we’re going hmm?” Mama gave him one last kiss and disappeared down the hall with Lucius.
“Snakes stick together, united front and all that jazz. Besides. I prefer you already. I can feel the entitlement from here.”
“Suddenly, being a parselmouth seems less appealing.”
“My name’s Hadrian Dragma.” Lily’s smile died.
Have I mentioning how frustrating and amusing it is to have a seven year old throw back you words at you. Exactly as you said them with the date and time you said them? It’s awful and funny!” Sara sighed. “I consider you kind of like a godfather anyway, I don’t really know what those are supposed to be. Not magical or religious here. But any legal godfather did nothing for my son, yet here you are… protecting him. Good enough for me.”
Staying here was intolerable. He’d die before that happened.
, write your answers to you sister and have her call them out then?”
“Alexander Potter!” The hall and its boisterous energy hushed as Alex sauntered onto the stage. Evidently, he was quite used to the spot light as he didn’t even bat an eye to the feeling of everyone’s attention on him. A small glance showed many faces, all curious, a couple scornful and glaring. He’d ask Draco who the man with long dark hair at the head table was later. He looked positively murderous with that sneer.
Nagini hissed again, pleased, and slithered away back into the kitchen. Draco groaned softly.
“I’m technically a half-blood. Muggleborn mother and Pureblood father. I disowned myself from them however due to… circumstances. And I lived with the worst of muggles that were my relatives, but only for a month or so. Laney’s always had accidental magic, so even though no one’s got a clue her blood status there was no doubt she’s a witch. That being said, any help would be appreciated. There’s a difference between knowing the basics of a society and culture and actually being immersed in it.”
His Papa choked as Hadrian skipped out of the room and tackled his beloved in his arms. Nagini hissing delightedly and the Malfoy’s snickering quietly at his parents.
First, he’d sleep a bit more. Things would be clearer in the morning.
Potter’s expression was openly brash and loud, large grin as he talked with a ginger beside him, Ronald Weasley if Draco remembered correctly. People were watching and whispering along the sides of the two and Potter seemed unbothered by the attention. Even flourishing under it. He looked slightly shorter than Harry, more stout with his chest puffed out. His hair was a shaggy and wild mess on his head with dark brown eyes that looked shone a slight gold in the torchlight. He was so Gryffindor Draco could feel a head ache forming from here.
“And do tell me, what is that child?” Hadrian hummed, a smile on his lips.
The rest of the trial went about the same, Albus touting the idea of family and love as well as trying to destroy any credibility the Dragma-Anderson household had. Which didn’t work as Lucius viciously and expertly destroyed any doubts and turned back the accusations on the Potters, who were much less prepared for such accusation. Hadrian rolled his eyes discreetly as many Lords were beginning to look at the Potter’s with distain. Especially when his therapist brought up his PTSD and abandonment issues from being tossed at his relatives when he was old enough to remember everything. The few purebloods who agreed with tossing a squib relative always did it young or obliviated the child of the magical world. Obviously, the Potters were hoping Albus and their fame would be enough to ride the coat tails to victory.
McGonagall reappeared in the doorway of the school, “Students! Come in, it’s time for the sorting to start!”
“Now you know how I feel when you whisper in French to me bastard.” Draco laughed before giving a soft sigh.
Hadrian definitely took after Ms. Dragma-Erin. Long limbs with carefully tamed hair and a disposition that screamed quiet power. Beside him was a girl with dark red curls and sun kissed skin, there was a spark in her brown eyes that burned with life and exuberance. Quite the opposites it seemed. Though, Hadrian was only wearing a tank top? Severus was quicker than him, frowning at his new godson.
“Now, I heard from your mothers’ that you were in therapy. Obviously, that is not offered here at Hogwarts. Can I inquire as to how you are doing?” Laney obviously looked at him, one of the few questions she couldn’t answer for him. Hadrian straightened his shoulders a bit.
“Harry was attached! I didn’t want Suni to get sick from wild rodents, he would have been heart-broken! Then you know Laney would have been upset and Annabee would have a downright melt down that her brother was sad.”
The excess potions and compulsion charms layered on each other and Tom wasn’t even surprised that no one would recognize Hadrian from Harry. With that much mind manipulation and compulsion, it was a wonder that he wasn’t a moody and violate mess full time. How Hadrian had kept himself intact for the summers away from the insane headmaster was impressive.
“God, I gotta work on pronouncing half of this. First one’s drought of living death? Draught? Second one is the stomach of a goat, that was the bezoar question. Third is nothing, both are aconite.” Snape pinched the bridge of his nose and summoned the sheet of parchment from her hands. Glancing it over and nodding firmly.
“HADRIAN!” The boy blinked tiredly and jumped when arms looked around him like a vice. Nearly struggling until the scent of brown sugar assaulted him like a brick to the face. Tears hot and burning welled up in his eyes as he desperately wrapped his own arms around her. Feeling her hands clawing nearly painfully at the back of his head and his back.
Rage. Fury. Rage.
“You’re too little too late, go away Mrs. Potter.”
“Never thought I’d see the day you volunteered to claim three children in a week. I trust you’ll be as good a godfather to them as you have been with Draco.” Lucius smiled. “Perfect, the next set is of course talking to the children. Without you present unfortunately to avoid claims of coercion. Would Hadrian be okay with that?”
Snape hid his slight surprise when the Potter spawn replied with a bland voice. “Many, and I believe Mama and Mother will beat you to it. Mother has been fed up with them since my adoption.” His godson hopped in the conversation. Snape eyed the way the blonde’s hands curled around the long-haired boy’s bicep. It wasn’t the worst Potter twin it seemed, but Snape was still displeased. Though, this wasn’t the conversation he’d been expecting, or where he was expecting to have it. Draco growled his input.
Valid reaction for an abandoned child.
“C’mon, let’s’ go back down. You promised desert.” Hadrian laughed and they went downstairs and host their guests. Draco was pleased with their desert and for a small while, the war didn’t weigh so heavily on the families.
Hadrian was going to reply when the door to their cabin was rudely forced open. A girl with frizzy brown hair barging in unapologetically. Hadrian gave a displeased pout as Laney smiled fondly and patted his arm. A tight smile on her lips as Draco sneered at the intruder.
“Would you just-“
Rage.
Child abuse, kidnapping, abandonment, neglect. Hadrian had a lot of firepower here.
Lily frowned and James sighed, watching her lightly pick at her food. Dark rich summer red hair curled like a waterfall around her face. Framing adorable freckles and those forest green eyes he’d be enraptured by since first year. Seeing her so unhappy always broke his heart. Which is why he couldn’t tell her everything. It would only upset her. If he kept it quiet, then he could wait until Albus let him tell the whole truth and she’d understand it was what he had to do. What had to be done.
“I’m not worried. That would mean he’s back home and murdering me.”
“Were your parents' wizards?” Hadrian shrugged.
His husband shook his head slowly, watching carefully as Severus pulled thin and callused fingers against his pulse point. “It’s the artery that leads to the brain, a laceration the scroll described would have killed him in minutes. That’s why he was magically exhausted that year, his magic was the only thing that kept him alive. We could have lost our son Tom! And we would have no idea what we’d lost.”
