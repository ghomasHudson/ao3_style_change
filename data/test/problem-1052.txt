Draco’s eyes were wide, and his nostrils flared. “How dare you? I understand it perfectly well! I’ll have you know Mother and I visited the Kennedy Space Centre, can you say the same?”
Draco tucked his son into bed, brushing his soft strands of hair away from his forehead and pressing a kiss to the tip of his nose. Then he leaned back, turned on the lighthouse lamp on the bedside table and flicked his wand to close the curtains.
“Oh! Yes.” Harry could have slapped himself. Of course, Malfoy was anxious. He enlarged the signed contract. “All done! I need to talk to you about something later.”
Malfoy also knew Latin and could read West Saxon English, which meant he could understand most of the books in these living quarters. When he found one on blood magic, he’d explained that it had many uses—not all of them being Dark—and got defensive. But Harry was oddly interested in all aspects of magic now. The word “Curse-Breaker” kept coming back to him. That required an intimate study of fields of magic that would scare many people shitless, didn’t it? And Harry didn’t enjoy studying, but he wanted to learn more. It gave him hope for the future—a different career perspective. He just wasn’t sure how to go about it without diving into books.
“What he means is that he spent hours decorating yesterday,” Weaselette said with a grin. “Your room is upstairs.”
“Noo! I need to say goodbye!” Scorpius hands him the backpack and jumps up and down, eyes glittering.
like Harry, and it speaks to him in soft murmurs, and Draco hears them but doesn’t want to listen; he’s torn apart, and he’s in so much pain.
He couldn’t wrap his mind around that. “I get— I can— but?” His breath was raspy. Jim hugged him again, and Harry hugged back, tight enough to be uncomfortable, maybe.
All Harry could do now was tell him he loved him in-between kisses, and he felt Draco smile and respond in a whisper,
“My recovery happened so fast that the corpse was still warm when I realised I’d been manipulated. Rowena confirmed that most of the students were free of this influence, but some of the youngest had died—Helga had figured out who was responsible and took offence.
They continued walking and casting until finally, Harry’s efforts produced a result. The brief glow came from the salt flats.
Harry’s eyes widened, and he heard Draco’s quiet gasp. Molly blushed and tutted, then turned her warm gaze on them. “It’s such a good picture, dears.”
Harry, who was drinking his juice, almost chokes, and begins coughing his lungs out. He doesn’t hear Draco’s answer, but when he catches his breath, Draco is watching him with a playful smile and his cheeks are pink.
A retort stung his tongue but didn’t make it out of his mouth. It was true that the Headmaster had been somewhat biased. Points shouldn’t have been granted for activities that had nothing to do with school or were against the rules. Harry had to agree with his inner Slytherin there; it was great to win the House Cup, but quite unfair. That traitorous part of his mind showed him the Feast in first year and the disbelief from the Slytherins when the Cup was stolen from them. Uneasy, he banished that thought and let out a sigh. “Okay. Welcome to the Chamber, and yes, that’s Slytherin’s Basilisk. Though I don’t know why it looks like that.”
1989 in the Muggle world was odd. The magical world was rather unchanged in 2010; people still wore the same clothes, listened to Celestina Warbeck and the Weird Sisters, and supported the Holyhead Harpies or the Falmouth Falcons. Muggles, though? The technological advancements alone were mind-blowing. Late 80’s fashion made Draco’s eyebrows twitch and what was the deal with pop music? The song playing on the radio right now irked him immensely.
The Hermione Harry loved so much wouldn’t. The traumatised, stubborn woman he’d parted ways with? Perhaps not today, after so long, but he wasn’t quite sure. Probably not without healing. He took a few deep breaths to dampen the rage bubbling up in his chest and thought about the manipulative bastards who would stop at nothing to further their agenda, spreading lies and twisting stories to their liking. The press made money, and the people ate it all up. Harry thought about his—
He also tried to lower his stress levels by drinking coffee, and yes, he was aware of the contradiction.
“Thanks. It hurts to breathe.” He drank and handed it back to Harry. “Either we come back here at night—mirages in the dark aren’t common, so magic should work—or we just try and summon it.” He lowered his voice and flicked his wand arm. He also wore a long-sleeved shirt, enchanted to keep him as comfortable as possible and protecting him from the sun, so no one could see his holster. “
magazine after an accident ended his career with Puddlemere United, would understand. He might even send him a get-well-soon card. He was the quintessential Gryffindor, which suited Draco just fine in these circumstances. All his coworkers were. Draco had no idea what he’d done to warrant being surrounded by Gryffindors all day long, but at least the Weaselette liked him, and Katie Bell had stopped staring at him like he was about to hex everyone she loved.
The man told him the truth about his parents, about why he lived with his horrible family, about a school called Hogwarts, about magic. Harry cried like he’d never cried before. Held tightly in a pair of strong arms, he let go of everything and didn’t feel a hint of shame. The man was him, after all. He must have cried, too.
Resentment runs deep in the Ministry, and children of Death Eaters are not always treated kindly. It’s an excellent reason to avoid renting from a magical landlord, but luckily for Draco, there’s a much bigger world around them. Harry can’t help but smirk as he tells him to widen his horizons. “You should hunt for a Muggle flat.”
Hermione leans over his shoulders from behind the couch when he unfolds the parchment. “Harry, who sent—oh.”
“Thank you,” he sighed, pausing to lick into his mouth and moaning when Harry responded in kind. “Thank you for bringing them.”
And so, they came back at night, as unwise as it sounded. They left the safety of their tent under Harry’s invisibility cloak, and with a clear image of the brand new hole in mind, they silently Apparated away from the campsite. The salt flats gleamed like a geode under the moonlight. The temperature was pleasant compared to the heat of the sun, but unlike the nights in the Iranian desert, it was still too much to stop sweating. Hottest place on Earth indeed.
Walking into the living room, Harry took a seat next to the fireplace and grabbed a pillow, holding it onto his lap as Noodle slithered down his leg and found a spot to nap near the fire.
It’s a globe of memories. The magic is sophisticated, the runes under its base have never been used in this manner before, as far as Draco is aware. It’s similar to how the weather in the Great Hall works, using a combination of charms and conjuration. Flitwick gave him tips, and Draco sacrificed many November nights studying Pensieves and portraits. He’s proud of his accomplishment.
“I see duck’s on the menu,” Draco drawled, rubbing his palm on Harry’s chest. “Don’t be late. I expect deliciousness.”
They don’t find much, but still more than they expected. The Chamber has areas where large groups of students could hide. It has food reserves under centuries-old stasis, general supplies and a considerable number of unmarked barrels - a sensible idea at a time where magic was starting to be looked at more closely by the Muggles. While the church-sanctioned killings didn’t start until the Founders and their children’s children were dead and buried, they still happened occasionally, and Hogwarts had been under siege - not because of magic, but because of the insanity that was Britain and its numerous kingdoms at the time.
“Then go ahead.” Malfoy swallowed him whole again. The warmth of his mouth sent delicious sparks through Harry’s cock. It took only one moan from Malfoy before Harry’s legs almost gave out under him as he emptied himself down his throat.
"How times change," the portrait observed, and Draco narrowed his eyes. Potter was still looking for his glasses with the bleary expression of those who hate mornings. It was cute. Even his disastrous hair melted Draco's heart. He was so gone.
Harry carefully applies the aftercare lotion on his new tattoo, taking his time on the locket scar, which is now partially hidden under a vertical depiction of the phases of the moon down his sternum. The right half of his upper chest displays the shape of a dog, a wolf and a deer, wispy and smoky, like a Patronus. They fade into lilies wrapped around Harry’s collarbone. Draco didn’t lie about the pain, but by Merlin, that spot in the corner of his underarm almost caused him to pass out. The needles punctured his skin for nine hours, and once the adrenalin vanished around the three-hour mark, it was no longer that easy. Harry must’ve become soft since the last time he was under the Cruciatus. Still, he’s already planning the next one. He wants Hedwig on his arm.
Draco briefly glanced away from his work in irritation as a shrill scream resounded through the library, but when the commotion seemed to have no outcome, he paid it no mind and continued with his research. It was going well enough until a rugged brunette careened around the corner where Draco's worktable was located, glancing around frantically while he tried to catch his breath. Finally, his gaze settled on Draco, who had been staring rather unashamedly at the man, and he heaved a sigh of relief.
“So we’re even, then. We’ve beaten our dirty laundry half to death and laid our souls bare, and if I got up and left right now, you would be okay with that.” Harry said it like a challenge, his tone aggressive but no longer scornful. Tentatively, Draco turned to face him and was surprised to find Harry’s glower had been replaced by something almost resembling curiosity.
“Yaxley still has your phone,” he blurted out. He couldn’t think of anything else to say, couldn’t even imagine talking about the ordeal they had both just been through. “I hope you have it backed up because there’s no way to retrieve—”
Draco stumbled on the pavement. He grabbed Harry's arm to steady himself, then used the grip to force Harry to face him once he was upright again. "You can't be serious," he said faintly.
“It’s beautiful,” Draco whispered in awe. He carefully unfolded the scarf to see it in its entirety before looping it around his neck. The scarf was warm as well as enthralling, and Draco found himself duly impressed.
A bright yellow sticky note caught Draco's eye from where it was plastered to his desk, the non-adhesive side lifting slightly from the wooden surface. Draco made his way across the room and peeled the note off so he could read it.
But we made it through! Things get worse before they get better, but they do get better eventually. Thanks to the people who have left encouraging comments <3 It genuinely means the world to me.
Wasn’t this exactly what he had been trying to prevent? Wasn’t this what he had been so worried about? All that time he had spent safeguarding Harry from his faults, shielding Harry from the inevitable crossfire, had been to keep the mistakes of his past from destroying the happiness he’d achieved in his present. And yet, what he had feared was exactly what had come to pass.
To his chagrin, Draco found himself inexplicably drawn to the horribly cliched Christmas films that seemed to air without pause as the holiday drew ever near. He forced Harry to watch as many of the cringeworthy films as they could stomach. More often than not, their impromptu movie marathons turned into drinking games that ended with the two laughing too loudly and snogging sloppily, the films continuing to play unheeded in the background.
And still, Draco couldn’t lay himself bare. He couldn’t watch the affection bleed out of Harry’s eyes, only to be replaced by disgust—or worse, fear. If he was going to lose Harry after tonight, he wouldn’t lose Harry’s love and respect, too.
Draco froze mid-bite, barely resisting the urge to glance at his left arm to ensure that it was still hidden. Should he tell the truth? Immediately he knew he couldn't do that. Oddly enough, he liked Potter and enjoyed his company. He couldn't bear the disgust Potter would surely feel if he knew the truth. Should he lie and say the library was cold? But he knew instinctively that Potter wouldn't appreciate deception, and regardless, he didn't want to lie to Potter anyway. What was it about the man that Draco found so compelling?
"Is that normal for you, girls chasing you through the library?" Draco asked as they found an out of the way table and sat down with their meals.
What had he been thinking, making such a reckless decision as this? There was no way this relationship could work out for him. In fact, the past had systematically proven to him that selfish indulgences could only result in heartbreak. There was no reason to suspect Harry was any different. Just this morning, Draco had been warning Harry not to go out with such a broken man as Draco, and just last night, Draco had had a vivid reminder of why his fears were legitimate. How had he forgotten all of this so quickly?
For the most part, their lives returned to normal. Draco hadn’t survived this long without picking up some ability to act, and he put those skills to good use. When the slightest noise made him jump, he passed his fright off as having seen a mouse or a cockroach. When Draco wanted to reassure himself that Harry was still alive and safe, he manhandled his boyfriend into a lengthy Netflix marathon and buried them both under layers of blankets.
He texted Harry late into the night, citing the excuse that he had misread the deadline for his homework when Harry admonished him to complete his studies. He didn't care that he would feel the exhaustion the next morning when he had to wake up for his eight o'clock class. It was worth it to know that Harry cared about him enough to stay up with him, and that knowledge sent him to sleep with a content smile on his face.
He made sure to keep the door open so Scorpius wouldn’t be scared and joined Potter and the Weaselette in the kitchen. He was offered some tea and accepted it gratefully. “Scorp’s room is beautiful. I don’t know how to repay you.”
“Hey, Dennis.” Harry pulled a chair and sat down. “I’ll have some cider. Half-pint, please, I’m Portkeying later.”
“You know you can afford that,” Draco points out as Harry gapes at a luxurious penthouse in Kensington. It has an indoor pool. The haughty employee who’s been lurking nearby looks like she has been handed a winning lottery ticket, and Harry imagines she must be paid on commission.
“I did.” Draco tapped his finger on the magazine. “Why do you have a crafts magazine with pictures that don’t even move?”
Laying on a beach at night is a familiar activity, and Harry rests his head on Draco’s chest. He spots five meteors in the first thirty seconds. “Perfect timing.”
The Basilisk is beautiful. Its scales shimmer in the magical light that makes the whole place look like the Slytherin common room. Part of Draco feels a pang of sadness for the loss of such a magnificent creature, but his Slytherin brain sees the answer to a few of his current problems: money.
“I didn’t dissociate.” It seems important. No, it is important, and it even brings a small smile to Draco’s lips. It disappears quickly, and Harry wants to ask what’s wrong, but he’s reluctant, just in case it scares him off. Instead, he pretends nothing is odd about them sitting on the floor of what used to be the Malfoy library. “I think my lungs are coated in dust.” As if eager to confirm, his body seizes, and he sneezes violently. Malfoy chuckles. “See? I bet I’m developing five different allergies all at once.”
Harry almost laughed when he felt tears running down his face once more. How weird was it, to think that the person who was kind enough to defy time for him would be himself. “Yes! Please! I don’t want to go back.”
Once freed from that pesky mistletoe that granted the paparazzi their dream shot, Harry didn’t move away fast enough, and someone grabbed his waist to drag him back, hoping to receive a kiss. Draco’s wand was pressed into the skin of the woman’s neck in an instant before he could even register what he was doing.
Harry couldn’t let go of the wardstone anymore, he didn’t want to. He kissed Draco breathless, unable to figure out what else he should do, and happier than he had ever been. He’d never be alone again; Draco had given him the most wonderful Christmas present.
Shrugging, Draco follows him to the car. It’ll be a cold day in Hell when he learns to drive, but Harry is enjoying having his license.
He had to support himself against the wall to reach the bathroom and sat in the shower so he wouldn’t crumble, his legs still shaking. When he went back to bed, the sheets had been changed and the air purified. He unrolled the map on his pillow and settled comfortably against the headrest. Far towards the North-East, a new dot flashed, so Harry Accio’d his Muggle map to compare the terrain, and wished he had a computer to do some research. That place looked like a big empty space.
Potter grinned. He looked well-rested, which was a good look on him and wasn’t a common occurrence. Draco wondered if the Chamber prevented nightmares. If so, he might just start living there. Permanently.
Then, at last, Hogwarts had removed his Mark, neutralising the spell that would have turned his organs to stone. He hadn’t thought it was possible. He’d been told attempting a removal would kill him in the most painful way possible—and he’d believed it because the Dark Lord would have found it entertaining.
“Yes, Potter, my tattoo artist is a Muggle, how terribly shocking.” He tilts his head back and exhales smoke.
“Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad Lucius Malfoy is rotting in Azkaban. But the boy? You did the right thing at his trial.”
France did wonders for Mother’s health. She’d always looked like a queen, but her skin had more colour. Perhaps she was dating someone. She smoothed her velvet gown and left her seat. Her embrace was, as always, like being held by a soft, lavender-scented cloud, and if Draco gripped her arms a little too tight, she didn’t mention it. She stepped back to look at him, running a hand through his hair and placing the other on his cheek. She’d never stopped doing that; Draco’s earliest memories were of those gestures.
“Don’t worry,” Narcissa says, “if all else fails, Minerva should know what to do. Is Harry at home?”
Whatever he wanted to say dies on his tongue. When he catches his train of thoughts, he blurts out, “How the fuck do you know where I live?”
He couldn’t resist those eyes, so he squeezed Harry’s upper arms and let out a slow breath. “Promise me to be helpful if we do that again. You must’ve known better from the start.”
The clock on the wall is still broken; Harry glances at it briefly, wondering why nobody bothers fixing it. Draco steals a fried calamari off his plate, his right arm slung loosely around Harry’s shoulders, tattooed fingers drumming on his chest. Harry squeezes his thigh under the table, and takes a sip of sparkling water. The barman’s reluctance in serving soft drinks is as strong as ever, and by now Harry orders it out of spite.
The sun was gone when they parted. Draco gathered the empty glasses and stood up. “I’ll go eat. Anything left, or did you devour all of it like a bottomless pit?”
Scorpius’ laugh is beautiful to hear; Teddy hides their face in their arms and wheezes, and Harry is crying and shaking with mirth.
Things had been somewhat tense since the purchase of their new tent. They’d been lucky to manage to summon their equipment before it got lost forever, but their previous accommodation got swallowed and torn to shreds by a sandstorm. They should’ve chosen a better one after that loss, but it would’ve required a trip to the wizarding district of Isfahan and Harry didn’t want to spend two whole days Apparating all over the country. With the regulations in place and the few approved itineraries for magicians, he’d rather sleep outside for a week. So, they’d headed to a Muggle shop in Kerman, then made a few adjustments so the tent would be cosier once they were out in the desert again. Needless to say, Draco Malfoy, born in the lap of luxury, did not appreciate the downgrade. Speaking of Draco, it was time to face the music.
Romance may seem dead, especially because the car is cramped and hitting one’s head against the roof hurts, but as Harry relishes in their intimacy and warmth, he thinks it might not be entirely true. Draco’s smile, the way he pulls on his hair, the marks he leaves on his throat, the strength of his arms around him, feel very much like love.
Harry tilts his head up so the chubby little hand doesn’t grasp them, and Victoire gurgles. “She’s huge.” It’s true; Victoire is growing at an even faster rate than Teddy did, it seems. Speaking of Teddy, Harry now has a tiny growth attached to his leg.
“Everyone deals with trauma differently. Your friends may be lucky, free to enjoy their lives, and I would wish that for them, but perhaps it’s their own way to heal. I don’t know them. But I get it,” Malfoy adds with an unsettling intensity in his eyes. “It’s very lonely.”
He doesn’t ask, but Malfoy goes on: “Before I invented this potion, I went to rehab. Dreamless Sleep addiction. Caught early, but it fucked me up. Luckily, it annihilated my marriage prospect with a reputable Pureblood girl, who is very lovely of course, but who liked the idea as much as eating a cactus.”
“It’s nearly September,” Harry points out. He doesn’t want to imagine how many people were shopping for school supplies.
“Malfoy, do you live in the Muggle world?” he asks, because it’s all well and good, but it’s killing him to try to guess everything about him.
Harry broke the kiss in shock, and Draco flipped him on his back. Holding Harry’s thighs open, he proceeded to fuck him with long, torturous thrusts. Harry’s toes curled each time he found the right angle, his back arched off the bed and he didn’t know what to do with his hands anymore. So he just gripped the nearest pillow, trying to bring Draco even closer by crossing his ankles behind his back. Draco lost control of his movements; a drawn-out moan and a jerk of his hips, and he pulled out slowly, before falling against Harry’s chest.
He expected his report to be snatched by his aunt, his arm twisted, while her shrill voice told him how useless he was. What he got instead was bewildering:
There was a soft smile gracing Malfoy’s lips. Bollocks, but Harry’s crush was getting out of hand. His mind turned into a whirlwind as he planned on decorating his best guest room. Malfoy liked light and airy spaces, and the master bedroom in Grimmauld Place had a huge window with a view of the back garden. Yes, it would work just fine.
He’d felt it when Cedric died, when he’d been railroaded at his disciplinary hearing, when Umbridge tortured him, unpunished. Righteous fury. His nervousness vanished, and he straightened his back, just in time for Ron’s return.
“Oh, no, you didn’t, he’s all right.” Draco pulls him into a hug. “Hear that? He’s not making that sound when he’s unhappy, right?” Scorpius hesitates, then nods. “I’m sure he had fun. I’m just telling you to be very careful in the future, but you didn’t do anything bad.”
When morning came, Draco didn’t remember falling asleep in his clothes, but his mood was excellent. Sleeping in Harry’s arms healed every ache.
The words tumble out of Harry’s mouth before his brain catches up on what he’s saying. “Two apartments.” He points at himself, then at Draco. “Two people.”
Draco shrugs. “It’s too big. I’m done with huge empty spaces.” He straightens his shoulders. “You know, it doesn’t have to be London.”
Ginny lands in front of him with a wide grin. “Well, look who is here, bringing gifts on his birthday!” She rests her broom on her shoulder. “You know, if you want to give me something, I’ll take your house. It’s perfect.”
Harry blinked and chose to face this head-on, quite certain he’d decrypted his snake’s words. He tightened his hold on Draco’s wrist, just enough to check his mood. If Draco didn’t want to talk, he’d tell him off. Since he didn’t, Harry’s Gryffindor boldness surfaced. “It’s the laws, right?”
Following that night, they’d argued about Dumbledore’s meddling and what they should avoid doing if they didn’t want the bearded, well-intentioned old fool messing with their plans. They’d ultimately agreed to keep him in the dark as much as possible if it didn’t mean sacrificing a child’s well-being.
“Ah, yes, pardon me, every single thing you did had a noble goal back then.” Malfoy shuffles closer. “Can you find Ursa Minor?”
She was babbling about her daughter being such a good match for him when he retrieved his wand and walked past her towards the elevator. Mercifully, he was alone inside (with a dozen flying bits of parchment). He exited at the Department of Law Enforcement and hurried down the corridor, unwilling to meet his old colleagues, more specifically Smith, whom he might very well blast to pieces on sight. He walked quickly, reaching the end of the corridor and the Wizarding Children’s Protection Office that had been opened at the end of the war, replacing the previous one that only dealt with adoptions. He knocked, didn’t wait for an answer, and opened the door.
He blinks at Potter. “Poison,” he says, and Potter’s hold on him tightens, his face turns into a mask of fury. “C-cyanide.”
, Draco thinks. He nods and looks at Scorpius, who is carefully climbing down the stairs with his backpack and his cuddly Niffler. “Harry was unpacking when I left. Ready, Scorpius?”
The snake is in pristine condition. There’s some odd magical energy around it, which Draco recognises only because it feels exactly like what the Malfoy elves use on food to keep it from spoiling (Draco was never supposed to go in the kitchen, so of course he spent many afternoons sneaking in). So, either an insane house-elf visited the Chamber years ago, or it’s been built into the foundations of the room.
Draco kicked him under the table when Harry’s thoughts drifted towards the Veil. He forced himself to listen again, but Unspeakable K had been droning on and on and Harry felt like nobody should blame him for not paying attention. He was a man of action; none of this was needed. He hadn’t been an Auror for long before his visions lost him his job, but Aurors knew something about efficient planning. This, however? How did Draco ever deal with such a slow, nitpicky system until he got his Mastery?
So, could Draco survive sharing a home with the man he lusted after? It went beyond lust, which was part of the problem. There were
"Potter, your tea will be cold by the time we come back." He drank his cup as if to make a point. "Savour it."
“Sure looked like it to me.” Tentatively, he reaches for a strand of hair brushing Draco’s cheek, and tucks it behind his ear. Draco doesn’t move. “I don’t know what I’m doing.” Harry’s fingers play with the laces of Draco’s shirt, twisting them, and doubt creeps in, but before it can stop him, Draco’s hand is on the back of his neck, the other cupping his chin, and that’s it, Harry’s heart is about to soar—
After they leave, Harry gathers all the toys, unwilling to use magic in case some of them contain batteries, and brings them into the small bedroom. When he comes back, Draco is smoking in front of the open window and checking the stack of leaflets on the coffee table. Despite the “no ads” sticker on the mailbox, they keep piling up, and Harry forgets to Vanish them.
Draco let out a cackle and headed to his bedroom, adding "Grimmauld Place's cellar takes up the entire basement, Potty." Then he stood in front of his open wardrobe and wished he had the time to take a shower, putting on a thick robe after casting a freshening charm on his body. Somehow being a bit scruffy within his own apartment was a lot more annoying than it had been in the tent.
It was December now. For the past two months, Harry had lived the life he should have had from the start—and he still struggled with the truth, the fact that he was not a freak, that he deserved to be happy and loved, but it was getting easier every day. Jim and Draco had taken care of everything, taking him out of the school system by using magic on Aunt Petunia to make her sign some papers. Because he willingly called the basement home, the blood wards were strengthening. He spent most of his time learning with Jim and Draco, who must have been very rich not to have jobs to go to. He was getting a normal education (Muggle was the word, apparently), but the best part of his days was when magic came into play.
“Ah, tell you what, we can go to the Christmas market and see if they have ice statues.” So what if Draco wanted to go back? This was the perfect opportunity. “If they don’t, we’ll go to the Manor, and I’ll try to build one for you.”
“Okay, so that gives us one week, and I don't know how we’re going to do this, but I’ll get enough people. I think.”
He was frustrated that the carvings on the wall hadn’t been directing them towards an exit, but at the same time, he was relieved. It was odd to feel so much weight lifting off his shoulders just because Malfoy had lost his shroud of misery. Harry had never seen him genuinely carefree, and he found himself thinking he wanted to commit that smile to memory.
It was still early when he heard Malfoy read a bedtime story from the half-opened door of the child’s bedroom. He grabbed the Butterbeers he’d bought in Diagon Alley earlier, sat on the couch and invited his rival to sit with him once the door to Scorpius’ room was closed and the child asleep. He erected a silence bubble around the living room, offered one of the Butterbeers to Malfoy and watched him slump in the armchair facing him.
“Oh, darling, don’t you remember? From the inside, you have to push until you hear it click. No wonder you got stuck in here so often when you were a child.”
Helped by another levitating spell cast on his own feet, he grabbed the edge of the hole and hoisted himself up. Malfoy trapped the piece of metal in an enlarged box, heavily warded by none other than Bill Weasley, and Harry brushed away the dust and sand off his kaftan, deeming the car far enough for now. Their various charms still protected them, but they shouldn’t linger for too long. One of the passengers might be a wizard.
Time ticks by, and Harry comes to him in a dream. He’s whispering sweet nothings into his ear when he thinks Draco’s asleep. He calls him love; Draco always tells him not to call him that, but in reality, he enjoys it. So he pretends to be in a deep slumber, only he sneezes, and Harry starts hitting him with a pillow and calling him a giant prat, and Draco laughs and laughs and
Draco sealed the vial and stood up in all his naked glory. “Don’t fall asleep without me,” he said, and left the room.
He grabs his Transfiguration essay and uses a textbook to support the parchment as he continues working on it. Studying, doing his homework - it helps him deal with the shitshow that plagues his life.
Harry thought Jim must have been very unlucky not to have a Jim and Draco of his own to learn potions properly: potions were so much fun! He liked it when they changed colours and bubbled. Sometimes, they made noises that sounded like farts and Harry would laugh hysterically. And Draco had a
Rolling his eyes, Harry held up the ice cream. “Belgian chocolate and hazelnut. They were out of the elderflowers flavour.” Why Draco liked that one was a complete mystery because the taste offended Harry’s tongue.
Draco takes the first step inside and Harry follows close behind. The entrance is snug and leads directly to a staircase. Lisa gives the general dimensions of the upper floor as they climb, and once they’re gathered upstairs, she gives them a tour, blabbering about the ideal location, the quiet, the lack of traffic, the friendly neighbours, things that should be important but that Harry tunes out. The stairs open on a square room painted in white, with beautiful wooden floorboards. Facing North-West, above the entrance, two rooms offer a fantastic view of the sea. Facing South-East, though, is the heart of the home. The bathroom is quite classy, all in dark grey tiles, but it’s the sitting room Harry falls in love with. Round black stones cover a portion of the wall, and it looks lovely against the white paint. The same stones adorn the kitchen which shares its dark theme with the bathroom. A door in the corner reveals another staircase, this one leading down to the large garden below. The harbour is visible from there as the house stands on a rather thin strip of land, and Harry thinks the location couldn’t be more perfect. He looks back at Draco, who is standing in front of the widest window with a soft smile on his face.
“Well, then you’ll stay all winter.” Harry may need to make an offering to a Malfoy ancestor for setting up the spell. His body was vibrating in excitement.
Was it odd, to feel proud of something that would have happened anyway? In the past two years, the child had gone from a version of Harry who needed saving, to someone Draco saw almost as a son. He’d never thought this day would make him emotional, but now he was the one who needed a hug.
He stretched his hole, soft and slow, hooking his fingers to find that sweet spot. His breath shuddered. His cock leaked on the sheets, no longer hard yet getting wetter with each push against his prostate. He couldn’t help but moan, wrist aching. He loved this. To avoid a humiliating reveal of his sexual prowesses on the front page of the
Harry spots Sirius and the Pleiades, and his lips stretch into a smile as the tension seeps out of his body. “I’m sure you drove your mum crazy.”
Greg had bought the shop after the war, struggled to succeed due to his past associations, then he’d hired Dudley, and the business saw a sudden growth just because “Harry Potter’s cousin works there”. As a recently-discovered Squib, Dudley (like Aunt Petunia, and wasn’t that ironic) could see the Leaky Cauldron without help, and he’d been looking for work among people who would understand what he’d been through at the safe-house during the war.
Harry blinks and it’s done. His forehead tingles where Draco’s lips have been, and fingers linger on his jaw. His eyes fascinate Harry. The pale, smokey grey is darker on the outer edge of his iris, but almost white around his pupil. He never noticed the length of his eyelashes before. Like his eyebrows, they’re brown, which is such an odd contrast for someone with nearly white hair. Harry drinks in every detail of his face; the light freckles on his nose, the small mole on his left cheekbone, or the reddish indent on his lips, where he probably bit himself. Then the fingers are gone and Draco, who rose on his knees, sits back down and dunks a plastic ship into the water, eager to participate in Teddy’s game. He’s still blushing. Harry can’t look away.
He traced a spiral on Harry’s bicep, then felt him shift, moving a bit lower. Warm lips played with Draco’s left nipple, making him shiver, then there was the slightest hint of teeth, and Draco gasped. “No, not now, morning breath, urg—”
“As I was saying, the wards are loosening, and I believe they should let you through. When you are rested, with your bellies full, the carvings will guide you through the old evacuation route.”
He takes a deep breath and heads back inside, welcomed by the delicious smell of the sauce he prepared. Draco knows how to cook, now, and that’s also courtesy of Molly. Mother wouldn’t know how to boil an egg.
With a slow blink, Draco ended his quiet admiration. Truthfully, he had no clue how Mother had made them, but he couldn’t disappoint his cousin. The climate spell would keep the statue from melting until it either malfunctioned or disappeared on its own at the end of March. “I guess we could make a snow dragon, cast
Draco and Harry weren’t into some of the kinky fantasies Ginny and Pansy imagined. Hell, they didn’t even have sex that often, because Draco had zero interest in it. He didn’t mind it; he liked it, but if he spent his entire life without it, he truly wouldn’t be bothered. Harry was attracted to him like a moth to a flame, but he liked their intimacy better. It had taken some work, and many conversations about boundaries, body language, and consent, lots of trial and error, but now they worked together like well-oiled cogs in a machine. They loved each other; Harry couldn’t ask for anything better.
The Fiendfyre devoured everything. The random objects in the Room of Requirement. Crabbe. Goyle. The room changed and turned into his room at the Manor, yet the fire was still there, rushing up the walls.
Draco has to admit he expected her to be less decent than that, but it’s his jealousy talking. He realises he should reply, and he chooses to share his secret too. “I’ve wanked and been wanked, that’s all. You’re not the only one.”
Harry resigns from the Aurors, so he fills his mornings with self-study. He pursues his interest in runes, progressing slowly even with Granger and Draco’s assistance, and Draco is proud of him for standing his ground when the Ministry comes begging. His resignation is a blow to their reputation.
“I know a good artist,” Malfoy replies. “Let me know.” Loki clicks his beak. “What time is it, anyway?” He casts
“George set up his own betting pool last time we hung out,” Hermione added with the look of a mad fiend. “You two were just so obvious, it was almost painful. I don’t understand how Ron
“We didn’t see any ice dragon,” Harry whispered in his ear, unwilling to let Teddy hear in case he threw a tantrum. He might be sweet-tempered, but when he was tetchy, he still raised hell.
“Oh, Harry,” Molly sighed, before wrapping him up in an embrace. “Of course we’re happy for you both.” Harry hadn’t even realised his eyes were wet. He buried his face in Molly’s shoulder, then felt Draco’s arms slide around his waist.
“Adoption. It would take longer to organise, and I’d need to keep it quiet, but if you can both agree to shared custody, the kid will be protected for life.”
“Oh bugger, I’m sorry, I didn’t think-” He tries to step back, but Draco won’t let him. That’s over and done with.
Draco doesn’t ask, but he wants to. Harry smirks mischievously. “If you’re good, I’ll show you the Chamber.”
Harry didn’t have a Muggle degree and he certainly didn’t earn any Mastery that would grant him a chance to go near the Department of Mysteries. It would’ve required studying. The thought of putting any effort into writing essays and doing endless research made Harry shudder. He preferred action, thank you very much.
Now, what to do with this milk? What could give it some texture? He mentally reviewed what he knew. Cheese would be nice, but it wouldn’t be a quiche lorraine then, would it? A runny potion needed heat; he figured milk would be similar. He transferred it into a pan, turned on the heat and let it warm up. It boiled a lot quicker than he expected. He lowered the temperature and chose to add some flour. The results were encouraging.
The piece of parchment vanished in a tiny burst of flames, and the house shimmered into view. Anyone looking at it would see the same house that had always been there and none of the changes Draco and Harry planned on carrying out. Even the real garden was hidden under an illusion.
Harry clucked his tongue. “You don’t. I expect you to return the favour, or no one will believe us about this place.” He snapped a few more pictures, then approached him. “It’s somewhere here?”
Harry agreed just as someone swooned and another screamed at him to “give her all his babies”, which made him and Draco hurry to Goyle’s coffee and pastry shop. Harry crossed his fingers and hoped Dudley wouldn’t be there because that had never stopped being awkward, but his wish was granted since Gabriel Delacour was behind the till, which meant Dudley wasn’t on shift.
When he’d voiced his opinion to Slytherin, who visited the small frame in his room shortly after Potter and Draco parted ways, he’d been told how throwing Squibs out of families, forcing them to join the Muggle world, was just as bad as welcoming Muggleborns and letting them leave again without taking a Vow of Secrecy. And it made him think.
Cooking in the wizarding world could be a hazardous occupation. When a regal Eagle Owl dropped a letter in the bowl of icing and proceeded to shed feathers all over the kitchen counter, Harry threw a shield charm so potent it made Teddy’s blue hair stand up straight. Biting back a string of curses Teddy was too young to hear, Harry grabbed the bowl as sticky little fingers reached inside.
Transforming back into a man, Sirius shrugged. “I live to annoy you.” He’d taken the news of their time travelling shenanigans and their marriage with an equal amount of disbelief.
Harry glared at his hands. “I hate this. I’m going to bed.” He stood up, shook his shoulders to dislodge the blanket, and stomped towards the bathroom, closing it with his foot. A muffled “Fuck!” could be heard through the wooden door.
Malfoy bristled like an angry kitten, which Harry thought was a brilliant comparison. He also couldn’t help but be fascinated by Slytherin, feeling terrible about what had happened to him. How hard must it be, to see yourself losing your mind as you age, helpless, just watching from a canvas hanging on a wall? He was about to defend Muggles when he remembered the Dursleys. With the power of a crowd behind them, they would be the sort of people to burn him alive, wouldn’t they? The thought chilled him to the bones.
“Let me guess, Parselmagic is no longer known. At all. Not even by families as old as yours.” Slytherin sighed. “What is wrong with this country?”
Harry woke up alone in a cold and dirty bed, feeling well-rested, so he must’ve dozed off for a good sleep cycle. He confirmed it with a silent
, one of the rarest books in the world. It must have cost a bloody king’s ransom. Where did he find it? No one in Britain owns it, or if they do, they guard it with their lives.
Andromeda mutters about reckless children falling onto their chin, bleeding everywhere and scaring her to death. Harry inspects his godson for any scratches and finds none.
“The portrait you know of is a much older me. It was painted when I reached my eightieth year on this Earth, unfortunately imbuing itself with madness and paranoia. I have last seen this version of myself as he sealed this very Chamber, ready to leave Hogwarts behind.”
Only Draco’s fast reflexes prevent his inkpot, precariously balanced on the couch, from spilling all over the fabric. He has no words, and Potter laughs, the absolute arse. “You’re fucking lying.”
He winced when someone knocked at the door. He wouldn’t get any work done if people kept interrupting him, so perhaps Wood would grant him the authorisation to maim his coworkers for the occasion. Lifting his fingers off the typewriter, he fell against the back of the chair and breathed out. “Come in.”
Here we are! I'm very sorry for the long wait, and I hope you enjoyed this story! I absolutely loved writing Scorpius. I have many more stories, so don't hesitate to check those out if you like what I write!
“Sex, Harry. It’s healthy and normal, don’t be embarrassed. Be safe. There’s this new condom brand—”
“It’s Kreacher. You’ll get used to him.” Potter served him a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. “Feeling better?”
Bristling, Draco considered telling him how he could do it if Potter didn’t want to help, but the truth was, Draco sucked at Conjuration. He’d earned excellent results in school because his creations weren’t meant to last, but building an entire house was completely different from making a quill appear out of thin air. Some people (aka Potter) were gifted with stable magic on top of that rare ability to manipulate the land and shape it into buildings. Draco was not one of them. He shared his thoughts as if they didn’t embarrass him, and still, he felt the telltale heat of a flush on his neck and ears. Pansy would say he attached too much importance to Potter’s opinion of him. She’d be right.
Silence settles, and it’s comfortable when it shouldn’t be. Potter is reading what appears to be a Muggle novel. Draco struggles to focus on his work; it’s the first time they exchange more than a word or two in a friendly manner, after all. Potter has been decent with him, but until now there was no sign that they could interact beyond basic greetings. To tell the truth, Draco is immensely curious. So many rumours about him have been proven false, what else is he mistaken about?
Draco flicked his wand at the mess around him to start packing. When he was done, he penned a brief letter to Pansy, cringing at the thought of her high-fiving Blaise and Greg, and taking bets on when Draco would end up in Potter’s bed. She would never let him live it down if he hid Potter’s generous offer from her, so Draco was wise enough to tell her instead of letting her find out—he’d never survive her wrath otherwise. He waited for Regulus to come back and hoped he wouldn’t get pecked to death for daring to send him on two errands in one day.
Wrapping his arms around him more securely and settling him on his hip, Draco finally takes a peek at the garden.
Harry grabs his Firebolt so that they can get back out of the Chamber easily. They walk hand in hand in the empty corridors, ignoring the portraits’ whispers, though it’s very hard not to stare at Sir Cadogan making a fool of himself to impress a group of witches. Harry’s thumb strokes the back of his hand, and he smiles, a little sadly. “We had him guarding the entrance of the Tower in third year.”
“Regulus would be proud of you for ensuring the safety of his cousin,” Harry pointed out, earning a venomous glare before the elf popped away. Then he smiled at Draco, and Draco was forced to face the fact that he was in love with the bastard. It happened a few times a week—small details that’d make him squirm and act in ways unbefitting of a Malfoy. Thankfully, Draco was no longer climbing trees to get Potter’s attention. He’d grown to appreciate the benefits of discretion.
The dreaded day comes a month after Teddy’s birthday. Hermione is berating Ron for dressing like a Cannons supporter, and Ron is mouthing “help” at Harry, who manages to quirk a smile. It’s a beautiful day, a day of celebration. To many, it’s more than a memorial, it’s the anniversary of their victory, the end of the war. The cheer in the air is almost enough to make Harry forget about the blood in the grass, the bodies in the Great Hall and the ruins of the first place he called home.
Said plan was written on a large piece of paper stuck to the fridge, and at the moment, Harry was staring at it like he often did; as if the list was a puzzle he was determined to solve. He looked particularly handsome this morning, with his long hair pulled in a messy bun and his short, scraggly beard. Gone was the starved child hiding under clothes much too large for him. Being a happily married Wardmaster and spending so much time in the field on assignments with Bill Weasley or the Aurors agreed with him. Draco, as an Unspeakable, felt like he couldn’t compete with his physical appearance (thankfully, Harry’s sense of style was as terrible as ever). While Draco had always been rather pretty for a boy, taking after his mother, he was a bookworm, and his job didn’t require the use of his muscles. He was still extremely pale and had none of Harry’s athletic frame; his body was softer, though he hadn’t gained much weight over the years. But he did not doubt that if he didn’t stop eating sweets, he would regret many of his decisions in a few years. He wasn’t too bothered anyway: Harry worshipped his body and Draco still liked what he saw in the mirror, soft belly or not.
Draco’s words came out a little choked up as he asked why she was here, why she hadn’t told him she was visiting.
quiet, not since the start of the Pygmy Puff mating season. The little buggers loved this place; as Harry reached the heavy front door, a dozen of them squeaked and rumbled, climbing all over each other on the front porch and leaving pastel-coloured hair on Harry’s black jeans. “This isn’t for you,” he said, tapping the ice cream. The squeaks intensified, taking on a distinctly outraged tone. “No. Remember what happened last week?” Rumbles. “The brain freeze?” The Puffs stared at each other with shiny eyes, then cooed and scampered. Harry shook his head and entered the house.
But Scorpius still manages to find a loophole, and the next time he stays at Malfoy Manor, Albert the peacock sprouts extra legs once more. Only, this time, Scorpius did it on purpose, and he’s not sorry.
!), but Draco kept them in a cupboard because Jim said he didn’t want to see that when they were eating.
He feels his eyes start to sting, and he sniffs, gathering his thoughts. Just in time, it seems, because Harry stumbles out of bed, looking hilariously ruffled. He reminds him of the oldest, crankiest bird in the owlery. Even with his glasses on, he still hits his foot against the doorframe of the bathroom. The muttered swearing that follows is almost sexy.
When Harry can’t sleep, he’ll look outside for the glow of Draco’s cigarette. If he doesn’t spot it, he goes for a walk around the harbour, or near the church on the hill if the harbour is crowded. If Draco’s in the garden, Harry joins him, and they sit and watch the stars.
“Hey, sweetheart, what’s wrong?” As he pronounces these words, his brain is screaming at him because it’s a stupid question.
It took a few minutes, but soon he was able to pour the hot mixture on the dough. It wasn’t smooth at all, which worried him a little. Harry was staring at it with a hand over his mouth. “Draco, it doesn’t look right,” he mumbled.
“Everything here is yours. These books were mine when I was at Hogwarts. I want you to decorate this room as you please. If you want toys, books, anything, let me know, and I’ll get them for you. At first. Afterwards, it’ll be for birthdays and special occasions.”
Harry’s left eyelid twitched. He gave up on denying his feelings since it seemed the whole world knew. “What do you suggest? Would he expect a courting ritual?”
Ona waited until Warrington was busy with a report, then poked Minitree and tapped her fingers on the ceramic pot. “You know, Potter, nothing will happen if you don’t make a move,” she murmured.
Draco Ignis Black, born June 5, 1960, in Locronan, France, from British parents. The picture looked horrendous and didn’t even move. One would think that after living with a Half-Blood for the past four years, he would be used to it, but that would be too easy, wouldn’t it? At home, they even had a computer, which he did find quite handy, and Draco checked his smartphone ten times an hour, but nothing weirded him out more than still pictures. They were unnatural to him, somehow. What felt worse was the absence of his husband’s last name on that shiny new ID.
“Cannons match Sunday?” Ron yells from his spot on the other end of the table. He’s stuck between a very drunk Dean and Pansy, who is flirting openly with Ginny.
Draco nearly fainted. Deep down, he knew Fawkes had only done as he’d told him to, but still, his son was gone. Any parent would panic. His disappearance put him even more on edge than he already was, and he stared at the fields around the cottage, waiting for any oddity, listening to unusual sounds. When Thor stood and growled, low and threatening, he cast
A hum is Harry’s answer. And then he’s alone again, and he tilts his head back, pushing aside the persistent thought telling him he enjoyed a conversation, as stilted as it was, for the first time in ages.
“I said I have it. Your wand. I kept it. Told the Ministry it was lost in the battle, or they’d have insisted about keeping it in the War Museum. I’ll just- I’ll get it.” And he ran down the stairs, flustered.
Draco sneered and sat up. “It’s never as good as a home-cooked meal.” He didn’t care if he sounded a bit whiny.
!” He could bet that if Slytherin’s portrait were listening, he’d scream in horror at the nonsensical terms. The painting was sensible to butchered Latin.
Potter grimaced. "Alright, I might have been a child actor for a semi-popular drama that's currently all the rage with teenage girls," he allowed. "Anyway, it didn't last long, and it's not like I have any dear love of acting or its accompanying popularity. None of these girls seem to get that, though. It's annoying," he said in what sounded dangerously like a whine. He stabbed viciously at his salad.
When the locket was only a pile of ashes and melted metal, he vanished it and asked Dobby to bring him back home.
He didn’t know, but he nodded. His throat was tight. He was going to meet his Godfather, Sirius. Until last week, he didn’t even know he had one! Jim had been very stressed but hadn’t told him why, except that Sirius was in prison because of Peter, the one who had betrayed Harry’s parents.
“No, Pansy is waiting for me, but I’ll come by tomorrow. You’ll see me at lunch. We’re leaving again in a few days.”
So that’s why the Hat took so long! A horrible thought goes through Draco’s head. “It was because of me, wasn’t it.”
“Be careful,” Harry said with a cough. He forced himself to ignore his arousal, and soon he was alone. He couldn’t help but think about the Horcruxes and how they reacted when destroyed, and he found himself praying—to what, he didn’t know—that they weren’t making a mistake, that Draco wouldn’t die down there. He looked at the dark water and thought it might be difficult for Draco to find his way back, so he dipped his wand under the surface and cast
The air smelled of lavender, as it always did. Harry’s lips stretched into a smile and he removed his shoes before stepping on the blue and gold rug in front of him. He still remembered what the previous carpet looked like before he renovated the place, and he truly didn’t miss it. The house was a Victorian Gothic beauty, with high, vaulted ceilings, stone archways, stained glass windows, a three-stories tower with rounded balconies and a pointed roof, and delicate carvings along the outer edges. The décor inside had left much to be desired when Harry discovered it. Then came the agreement between him and Malfoy, and the expectation that Harry would be in the house most of the time, and he decided to change it all. Malfoy helped (or rather, Malfoy listed all the things he didn’t want to see in his home, and asked Parkinson to watch what Harry did. To his dismay, Pansy ended up collaborating with Harry and got rid of the atrocious chandelier in the master bedroom).
“Yeah, I tend not to listen to you—isn’t that shocking?” Harry stood up and looked at the pipe above them. It was too high to reach in any way, and even if he somehow trusted Malfoy to levitate him, there was nothing to grip; he would just fall again. “There might be another way out. Let’s go.”
Harry didn’t want to listen. No, he did, he just didn’t want to be so obvious about it. That break-up had been in the papers, because at the time, Draco was still gracing the pages of the
He hurried back to Potter's side as he uncorked the bottle. Noodle was exploring the kitchen tiles, tongue flicking in and out and wobbling when he found something of interest, and Harry translated his hisses. "He loves it here. The floor is warm."
They spend their remaining free time enjoying each other’s company, snogging in broom cupboards and secret passages. They fuck in the Quidditch locker rooms, the shower, their common rooms. Harry brings him to orgasm against a tree at the edge of the Forbidden Forest, and Draco bends him over a desk in an unused classroom.
“Well, we’re going to pretend we’re not the same person, of course. I have a fake name, Harry Jim Evans. Evans was Mum’s name, too.”
, he’s distracted. He wants to sleep in Scorpius’ room, and Harry is having none of it. The prat is too relaxed about the events, in Draco’s opinion. It’s odd because Harry is usually the mother hen when it comes to their son. But then Harry Accio’s a piece of parchment and holds it in front of Draco’s face, and everything snaps into place.
Potter. Scarhead himself, wearing a blue jumper and jeans that, for once, fit him like a glove, steps into the common room. He looks around, sees Draco, and asks if he’s bothering him.
Around midnight, when Teddy was asleep, and Mother went home to her grumpy husband, Draco asked Harry if he wanted to continue the celebrations. That was how they ended up drunk in Draco's living room, playing Exploding Snap and arguing about the colour of the murder birds from Addis Ababa.
Draco stepped back and smirked. His cock, hard and leaking, was such a mouth-watering sight that if Harry hadn’t known he was bi, the mere sight of it would’ve made him fly out of the closet with a rainbow cape on his back.
The clock was ticking. Draco attempted to warm his hands by breathing on them and rubbing them together, but it didn’t help much, so he paced in the small space until he felt the tingling of the wards allowing Potter through. There was a crack as Potter Apparated from the inner edge of the wards to the boathouse.
Harry squeezed Draco’s waist and grinned, eyes shining in amusement. “You didn’t tell him. You just grabbed it.”
It’s summer when he goes back to work, and it takes a few days before he’s assigned desk-duty for reckless behaviour. He drowns his sorrow in endless, unresolved cases. He accepts the Weasel’s company in the quiet corner of the cafeteria where he sits to flee the noise—Draco’s very sensitive to the outside world now. The Weasel needs some peace, too. They leave the Auror department on the same day, without having planned any of it. Granger invites Draco for dinner, but that’s Draco’s limit.
“I’m sorry,” he says, and Myrtle sniffs with typical Malfoy-ish disdain. Draco is almost proud. “I’ll do better.”
“Potter, I thought you were going to give me bad news!” The tension left his body. “What’s Hamleys?”
“I made you some hot chocolate. If you don’t want it, I’ll drink it.” And he would. He had a massive sweet tooth.
He squashes his pride, stands up and attempts to walk, but he’s too weak and stumbles. Something’s wrong. He looks at the staff table; no one is paying attention because the
It took ten minutes for Harry to stop laughing hysterically and ten more to understand that this man was him. And he had to believe it because he knew things Harry had never told anyone, about the cupboard and the spiders and Harry’s hopes and feelings, all the times he had wished he could fall asleep and never wake up when he was tiny and wanted to join his parents. How he didn’t remember what a hug felt like. Had he even been hugged in his life?
In his absence, Harry realised he was holding a piece of parchment. He’d been so distracted by Draco’s lips that he hadn’t noticed him slipping it in his palm.
He felt numb. There was no other emotion in his mind right now, after the fear—the sheer panic of yesterday. He understood ancient wards, knew there was nothing to do but wait. As he thought about it, he realised it wasn’t just panic. Yesterday had brought joy, too—if only for several brief moments. The fascinating finds, meeting a sane Salazar Slytherin—but the truth he spoke of did make him uneasy.
Potter shrugged, an easy smile back on his lips. "I told you, I'd like to take you out sometime. You obviously weren't interested so I figured hanging out as friends was the next best thing. The beer really needs no explanation."
Harry whipped around to level Draco with a glare. "No," he said immediately, his voice firm, but Draco didn't let it faze him.
"Oh, him," Draco said, feigning remembrance. He pointed in the direction of a random bookshelf. "I think he was headed that way." The girls thanked him hastily and sped off. Draco kept his eyes on them, waiting for them to realize the man they were looking or was nowhere to be found.
He knew he needed to apologize for how vicious he had been yesterday, though he didn’t regret the words he had used. He would admit that shutting Harry out had only hurt them both, rather than protecting either of them as Draco had hoped, and he would promise to work on expressing vulnerability. And he would tell Harry the truth—about the Death Eaters, about Lucius and Yaxley and all of it. If Draco wanted to try to wipe his slate clean, Harry needed to know exactly what he was getting into.
Though he hadn't had much practice with it lately, Draco immediately schooled his expression into one of frosty disdain. "Yaxley," he said coolly, eyeing the other man with suspicion. The two regarded each other for a long moment as passersby continued to jostle past them, oblivious to the silent tension rising in their midst.
like you. Just don't know if I should." His hand fell back to the bed and Draco smiled softly, letting sleep claim him at last.
"Quite the celebrity, aren't you?" Draco said drily, hoping his voice didn't sound as hoarse as he imagined it did.
Nonetheless, even in the privacy of his own room, Draco couldn’t quell the anxiety buzzing beneath his skin. His eyes drifted towards the window above his desk almost obsessively, though whether he was hoping to catch one of Yaxley’s henchmen in the act or to reassure himself there was no one there, Draco didn’t know.
He stepped aside and let Harry in, accepting the figurative olive branch and extending one of his own by saying, “Which actors shall we heckle tonight?” As Harry opened a bottle for each of them, Draco retrieved his laptop and settled on the couch. The heat of Harry’s thigh pressed against his was a comfort he’d forgotten; he let himself revel in it for a moment before pulling up Netflix.
“At least tell me why you didn’t trust me,” Harry continued. “Or is that also too much to ask? Where did I fuck up so badly that you decided our time together meant nothing? Don’t I deserve to know at least that much, if you won’t tell me anything else? I want answers, Draco. I want to know where I stopped being enough.”
But he couldn't go back. Though he knew she would face harsh consequences for his disobedience, he would not allow Lucius to use Narcissa like a bargaining chip. It would only reveal that she was one of Draco's weaknesses, allowing her to be used again and again in the future.
Gradually, the crowded buildings and cramped streets gave way to sprawling warehouses. The crowds that had populated the city center thinned out to virtually nothing, and the incessant hustle and bustle that characterized the city traded places with relative silence. It unsettled Draco; he was reminded of the many encounters he had carried out in out-of-the-way buildings and alleyways, where bodies and bloodstains would go unnoticed until long after Draco had washed his hands clean.
Lucius raised an eyebrow. “Yaxley,” he called out. Draco suppressed a flinch at the sudden increase in volume. “Is that what you saw?”
Draco heard Yaxley shoulder through the trees and waited for the older man to stop moving before he spoke. "Why are you here?" he asked, his back to Yaxley. He squared his shoulders and drew himself to his full height, drawing on every lesson his father had given him on portraying authority to disguise his horror behind a stony facade.
Draco closed his eyes. It was easier than trying to meet Harry’s gaze without feeling guilty. He clenched the fingers of his right hand around his left arm, his grip so tight that he knew he’d find bruises there in the morning. It was what he deserved, he supposed. “I do trust you,” he said, injecting as much sincerity into his voice as he could. “I trust you, but I can’t involve you in this. I’m telling you things will be okay. Don’t you trust
It was a welcome surprise to find them clean, if a little clammy. Draco heaved a sigh of relief. He collapsed back into bed without bothering to turn off the light. A quick glance at the clock resting next to the lamp told him it was just past 5:00 in the morning - too late to try to fall back asleep. Draco rubbed his eyes instead of dragging himself out of bed, trying to prolong the inevitable.
Potter's lips tightened. "That's not something I'm willing to share," he said quietly, shocking Draco with the change in his attitude.
“Please, not tonight.” He kept his eyes locked on the screen, unwilling to see the unhappiness writ large upon Harry’s face. Even Draco could tell he sounded weary; he hoped Harry would take pity and cede to Draco just this once. “This is nice. Let’s have this, tonight.”
“Would you believe me if I said sorry?” Draco asked. He was immensely proud of how collected he sounded. Harry floundered for a response, and Draco used the momentary silence to push on. “I told you that very first day that they used to call me the Ice Prince. You didn’t listen. You never even asked why.” He laughed, a single, humorless bark. Malfoys didn’t feel emotion. Malfoys played their cards close to their chest. Malfoys didn’t expose their weaknesses. “Well, this is why. I’ve learned how to reckon with my emotions, Harry. How to shut them off, how to use them to my advantage. I’m not going to exhaust myself in a desperate attempt to placate you, only for you to lose your temper the next time I refuse to let you read my diary.”
Harry started walking again as he replied, forcing Draco to follow. "It wouldn't be permanent," Harry pointed out. "Look, just think about it. You've still got a week to decide, yeah? Besides, if you're that concerned, you can just cover Ron's portion of the rent over break." He jostled Draco's shoulder with a smile, amusement glinting in his eyes.
"Master Lucius has sent me to bring you home," Yaxley drawled. Even without looking, Draco knew the man was smirking. Draco scowled reflexively in response. Thankfully, the irritation gave Draco an outlet for the emotional turmoil he was struggling with. Focusing entirely on the ire Yaxley inspired within him, Draco let his anger grow until he trembled with the effort of keeping his rage contained.
The taller one puffed her chest in indignance and angrily opened her mouth to say something, but her friend stopped her before she could by placing a hand on her arm.
Draco's alarm woke him the next morning. He clawed himself into an upright position, feeling groggier than he normally did, and rubbed his eyes blearily. As he did, his shirt sleeve rubbed against his cheek, and he stared at it in confusion, wondering why he hadn't changed before sleeping.
Draco's phone buzzed a few minutes later, just as he was settling back into bed to sleep for another hour or two. He thumbed open the notification to see that he had received a text from Harry reading "Left your present under the tree; do NOT open until Christmas day. I will know if you do." Horror dawned on him as he realized that, caught up in Harry and the holiday spirit as he had been, he had completely forgotten to buy Harry a present.
During Draco’s stint with the Death Eaters, Dolohov had had a bad habit of leaving his key fob hanging from the door of his car. There was a reason he provided the muscle and not the getaway, after all. Luckily for Draco, Dolohov didn’t seem to have changed in the year Draco had been away, and he quickly commandeered the car that had carried him here to serve as his and Harry’s method of escape.
Harry laughed and shoved both his hands into his pockets. "I seem to owe you a favor," he said. "How about lunch? It's about that time, anyway."
Draco hummed, gathering his thoughts. He couldn't remember the last time anyone had asked him that question due to an actual desire to get to know him. It raised other questions Draco hadn't thought he would need to consider, since he'd assumed he wouldn't see the man again after this chance encounter: What could he afford to share? How much was he comfortable revealing to the other man? "Eighteen, studying law," he said. "I like green apples, I hate sweets, and I'm highly independent."
"Anyway," the other girl said forcefully, glaring at her friend, "we didn't mean to take up much of your time. We were just wondering if we could take a picture with you?"
"I'm sorry," he said in lieu of an explanation. He reached up to kiss Harry on the nose, the cheeks, anywhere he could reach. Simultaneously, he pushed Harry's shirt up until Harry lifted his arms so Draco could take it off entirely. "You're fine, I'm sorry." He caught Harry's lips in a soft kiss, and then another, and another, and soon it didn't matter that he was still fully clothed while Harry was down to his boxers.
Though it was hard to do anything on the Death Eaters’ terms given Draco still didn’t know what they were. It had been three weeks since Yaxley had confronted him, and Draco had yet to experience any fallout. Was Draco being lulled into a false sense of security, or was Lucius taking pleasure in watching Draco squirm? Draco also had to consider the possibility of Yaxley working alone. What was Yaxley’s endgame—currying favor with Lucius by returning his erstwhile son?
Draco stepped out from the stall and cautiously approached one of the mirrors. Step by step, he drew closer, until his arms bumped against the porcelain lip of the sink, and he could stare directly into his own eyes. This was the first time he had faced his reflection without shying away since Christmas Eve; he looked into his eyes, his haggard face, and tried to see what others saw. What his professors saw, and his classmates—even, possibly, what Harry saw.
Draco couldn't suppress his quiet chuckle in time, but he managed to turn it into a fake cough instead. The students seated next to him glanced at him briefly, and he smiled apologetically at them before facing forward again and trying once more to pay attention to his professor.
Draco’s breath quickened. Instinctively, he curled his right hand around his Dark Mark and pushed his fingernails into his forearm, using the ensuing burst of pain to ground himself. Meanwhile, Lucius crossed over to Harry. Using the head of his cane, he tipped Harry’s chin up so he could look into Harry’s eyes. Harry stared defiantly back.
As they headed to the bins, Draco finally noticed the tension in Harry's shoulders and the firm set to his lips. He remembered suddenly how Harry had told him he didn't care for fame, and Draco wondered if perhaps there was a deeper reason for Harry's discomfort.
From his angle on the floor, Draco could see a t-shirt lying in a crumpled pile beneath his bed: a soft cotton v-neck that Harry must have left behind before the winter holiday. He fished it out, eyes widening in surprise when he noticed it still smelled a little like Harry. In a flurry of movement, he stripped off his own long-sleeved sweater and pulled Harry’s shirt on in its place. He curled his arms around his waist, burrowing into the shirt and ignoring how pathetic he must look.
When it became clear Yaxley was going to neither break the silence nor release Draco from his grip, Draco sneered and did both himself. "If you want to talk, we certainly won't do it here," he said, injecting as much authority as he could muster into his voice. He turned sharply on his heel and stalked away.
He swallowed the lump building in his throat and his pride with it, and said, “I’m sorry. I’m truly sorry you got mixed up in my feud with my past. You were never supposed to be a part of this. My fear of my past and present colliding is why I was so hesitant to date you in the first place, and why I didn’t tell you the truth after Christmas. But you drew me in so easily and made me feel like I deserved happiness for once. I thought my father would leave you alone if I made it clear you had nothing to do with my decision to leave the Death Eaters. I thought…” Draco paused and shook his head. “It doesn’t matter what I thought. It wasn’t enough to keep you safe. I’m sorry for that.”
Objectively, Draco recognized Harry’s words for the taunt they were. He knew he shouldn’t rise to the bait. But after Yaxley, after weeks of anticipating a death warrant with his name stamped on it, after two decades of doing exactly what he was told—he was sick of being ordered around. He was sick of being told what to feel and how to behave and everything he owed the world. He whirled around and pinned Harry with a glare, no longer caring who heard him.
"Draco, no," Harry protested, gripping the laptop tightly. Draco easily distracted him with a kiss, stole the laptop when Harry's grasp loosened, and danced away triumphantly with his spoils. He deftly searched up the appropriate title and settled in the bed he and Harry were sharing with the laptop balanced on his crossed legs. As he eagerly pressed play and the sounds of the opening theme filled the small bedroom, Harry joined Draco on the bed as well. He made a show of groaning loudly and, hardly an episode in, began mouthing at Draco's neck to discourage him from continuing to watch the show.
Harry swatted at his chest with a laugh, calling him on his bluff. "We have Netflix and popcorn," he said instead, laughing again when Draco's face lit up with childish joy.
Lucius cocked his head in a mockery of curiosity. “Tell me,” he said before Draco could respond to his previous sally, “what is it about this boy that drives you to turn your back on everything you hold dear? What falsehoods did he feed you to make you think you owed him anything?”
Draco had finished his lunch and was waiting for Harry to do the same when he grew aware of two wide-eyed girls their age staring at them from across the small restaurant. They were whispering furiously to each other from behind hands raised to their mouths.
On some level, Draco knew it was unfair to keep Harry in the dark about this, especially if he might be at risk because of it. But warning Harry about this meant telling Harry about his past, and the thought made Draco sick to his stomach. He couldn't imagine Harry would want anything to do with him after finding out about the crimes Draco had committed. His nightmares had made it abundantly clear that Draco had done too much harm to deserve the kind of love and support he was receiving from Harry now, even if he was past all that now.
He took a deep breath, focusing only on the sounds of physical combat emanating from the speakers, and held it for a long moment. When he exhaled, he let the tension seep out of his muscles until he was once more draped loosely against Harry’s side.
As a result, Draco made sure to keep an eye on Harry as much as he could, and he made a concerted effort to keep both Harry and himself out of situations where they could be targeted. It was an easy task. After all, he knew how Lucius worked nearly as well as Lucius did; in turn, he knew how to preemptively counteract his father’s potential attacks.
“Draco,” Harry said. He swallowed, started again. “Draco, I know there’s something you aren’t telling me. I know something happened while I was gone. You haven’t been yourself. You’re jumpy and scared, and you’re having nightmares every night that make you scream and refuse to sleep in the same room as me. You won’t even leave the flat unless I force you. What’s going on, Draco? Let me help you,
Potter gave a small chuckle. "Yeah, I know, I should be ecstatic," he said. "Honestly though, it gets tiring after a while. I don't want the fame. I don't really understand why I have it to begin with. But it's a moot point either way, since I don't-don't like girls." He stared firmly at Draco, as though daring him to comment on his hesitance. But Draco noticed how his jaw clenched in fear and his shoulders tensed warily.
He left the flat in a hurry, barely pausing to wrap a scarf around his neck and lock the flat behind him, desperately hoping that the Christmas crowds hadn't stripped the shops bare quite yet.
“I never asked you to!” Draco shouted back, matching Lucius’ intensity with his own. He strode deliberately forward, too, meeting Lucius halfway. “I don’t want an empire built on the backs of innocents, an empire that only exists because the people within it fear you. I won’t spill more blood than I have already. If I spend my whole life making amends, it won’t be enough!”
Potter laughed nervously, shifting his weight from side to side, and said, "Harry Potter." He held out his hand to Draco.
Potter flicked a glance at Draco, but his gaze skittered away immediately afterward. "Did some child acting when I was young, just adverts and the like. There were a few that grew quite popular, and for some reason people seem to remember them, unfortunately for me." He held Draco's gaze at that, pure confusion etched upon his face. Draco resisted the urge to laugh at how incongruous the emotion seemed with Potter's headstrong personality.
Draco's lip curled. "I'm not too keen on reminding them of my existence right now," he said shortly.
Draco scowled to hide his mortification. "So you're not planning on going anywhere over break, then?" he asked, changing the subject.
Harry was quiet while Draco drank, but he seemed to have something on his mind. He wouldn’t meet Draco’s eyes. Instead his gaze seemed fixed on Draco’s left arm. Out of habit, Draco made sure the tattoo was still covered, coloring slightly in embarrassment moments later when he realized Harry had already seen it.
Draco opened his eyes and met Potter's gaze. "Why are you here?" he asked. It was a simple question, an easy one that would hopefully lead to the discussion they really needed to have.
As soon as Draco felt he could move again, he escaped into a nearby bathroom to collect himself. Though it was empty when he entered, he locked himself into one of the stalls to avoid being confronted by his reflection.
"Wait, Draco," Harry said, but Draco brushed him off and took hold of the smartphone one of the girls was passing him.
So he continued repeating the maxims his father had ingrained in him since birth, a reminder that Potter couldn't possibly be real. Something had to give.
"That's another thing," Draco said. He drained his bottle in one long pull and gestured for Potter to pass over both another bottle and the opener. "Are you mentally deficient? I told you, it won't do you any good to moon over me." He tried to ignore the regret that shot through his heart like a lance at the words.
Though he got one just a few moments later, Draco lingered in his room, hesitating. If he met up with Potter now, he could no longer continue pretending his relationship with Potter was little more than a series of ill-advised coincidental encounters, fated to collapse onto itself as quickly as it had begun. It was not an enticing outcome, and to Draco's chagrin, he found himself seriously considering hiding in his room until this situation went away.
's easy openness made it easy to trust him. Draco was still wary about the potential consequences that could come to pass, but for the first time, he didn't want to let those consequences hold him back.
Several things happened at once. By Draco's side, Harry stiffened with a sharp intake of breath and clutched so tightly at Draco's hand, he would not have been surprised to find mild bruises forming later that evening. The girl's companion exclaimed, "Oh my god, Lavender! You can't say things like that!" All conversation in the cafe drew to a close as the patrons zeroed in on Draco and Harry's linked hands, and though most turned away immediately, clearly disinterested, a few gawked openly, only adding to the overall tension of the situation. The sudden silence that permeated the atmosphere was disturbed only by the loud, out-of-place whirring of machinery from the back.
When he turned around, an easy smile and a white lie about wanting to see a film already graced his lips. But when he saw the person holding him, his smile fell, and his blood ran cold.
Unspoken words hung heavy in the air. They could have tonight, or they could have all the nights that followed, but they couldn’t have both. And Harry was leaving the choice to Draco.
Upon confirming Lucius confirmed was still too blinded with pain to pay them any mind, Draco turned to Montague. “Cut him loose,” he said, using the pistol to gesture towards Harry. He was buzzing, every centimeter of his skin alight with fear and gunmetal, something like acid scorching his veins. Montague made quick work of the rope holding Harry immobile, and Draco traded in his pistol for Montague’s while the other man was distracted. As soon as the last of the rope fell away, Draco rushed to pull Harry out of Montague’s reach.
"He'd be delighted," Draco cut in with a wide smile. "In fact, I can take it for you so you're both in the picture, how's that?"
Draco conducted one final assessment of the Death Eaters in the building—three incapacitated with injuries, two making aborted movements towards Lucius, the last rooted in place with eyes blown so wide Draco knew he would see the man’s irises ringed with white if he were close enough. Lucius himself was just now drawing himself to his knees, and then, slowly, to his feet, using his cane as a crutch. Satisfied, Draco drew Harry’s arm over his shoulder, threaded his own arm around Harry’s waist, and began pulling him to the exit.
He received a text from Harry a half hour before noon, letting him know that Harry would be back soon. It gave Draco enough time to freshen up and plaster a smile on his face, though he knew he couldn’t do anything to hide the exhaustion painted across his expression.
Draco let them come. Emotional distance was just what he needed right now. Potter had the vexing ability to bodily drag Draco's emotions from the cage wherein he had confined them long ago. His unflinching honesty had wormed past all of Draco's defenses. When had Draco last met such a sincere person? He couldn't remember. His life had been so full of lies and deceit that it was all he knew.
At least he had another day if he was unsuccessful today, he mused. Harry was returning the afternoon of Boxing Day, so Draco wouldn't be able to take advantage of the after-Christmas sales, but if worse really came to worst, he could always order something online and simply say it was taking longer to ship than he had anticipated.
"Why?" Draco asked petulantly, just to be contrary. He wanted nothing more to return to his work, and this stranger was quite effectively putting paid to that plan.
“Afraid of being gay? It’s true that I don’t want all and sundry to know my sexual orientation, but I’m not the person who becomes catatonic from being called a fag!” he retorted. Harry recoiled in shock, but Draco did his best to ignore him. “You want to talk about trust? You’re expecting an awful lot of it from me without giving me any in return. Don’t be a hypocrite.”
That last thought hit him like a freight train, punching the breath out of his lungs. He still couldn’t believe Harry was no longer a part of his life. And it had been his fault. As always, he had hidden away in fear, and his fear had become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
A minute later, Harry spoke again. "Come stay at mine, then," he said, determination etched on his features. "If you really don't have anywhere to go."
Draco scoffed at himself. Hadn't he decided not to let his worries of the past dictate his future? Now that the shock had worn off, Draco had no excuse to refuse. He had nowhere else to go, as Harry had so aptly pointed out, and Harry had made it clear that he didn't mind the imposition.
Silence reigned as the two of them sat and drank, but it was a comfortable sort and not wholly unwelcome. If Draco closed his eyes, he could almost pretend that Potter wasn't actually here, and Draco had hallucinated the past few minutes. It wouldn't have been too extraordinary, considering the workload Draco had been managing recently.
to get up and leave now that he’d gotten his answers? Draco hardly dared to hope. He drummed his fingertips against his thighs in search of a distraction from the anticipation swelling in his chest.
Draco choked back a distressed cry at the thought that his mother had interfered on his behalf. He swallowed against the lump that had suddenly taken up residence in his throat, burning the back of his throat with each breath. Unlike Narcissa, Lucius was neither kind nor forgiving; Draco could not even imagine the lengths to which his mother must have gone in order to give him this second chance.
Draco’s gaze skittered away from Harry’s. “I didn’t get you anything,” he said reluctantly. At least it wasn’t a lie, so much as it just wasn’t the full truth.
But he had been backed into a corner now, and there was nothing he could do but wait for the other shoe to drop. Yaxley had the advantage here, even without the power of Lucius on his side. The Death Eaters were more likely to give their loyalty to a man who wore his Mark as a badge of honor than a man who had turned tail and run the moment he turned eighteen. The lack of follow-through on Yaxley’s threats might speak to the weakness of Yaxley’s bluff, but his prolonged silence might also be an omen of more sinister things to come.
No, he amended immediately, not for nothing. The Mark was a remnant of the worst possible version of himself, a person he had the capacity to be no matter how badly he didn’t want to. The Mark kept him from forgetting what he had left behind.
Then Harry tried to pull the shirt off by prompting Draco to raise his arms so he could slide the fabric up them, and Draco panicked.
What would the Mark look like through the same lens? The image was grayscale, with detailed shading. Against Draco’s pale skin, however, the image stood in sharp contrast. Immediately, memories began vying for his attention—the first time he had fired a gun, the fistfight that had marked his sixteenth birthday, the day he had finally been marked with the Death Eaters’ symbol—but he pushed through the rising panic and tried to see the tattoo objectively. He tried to see nothing more than a snake pouring out of a skull near his elbow, undulating around itself, and culminating in a small snakehead baring its fangs a few inches above his wrist.
Guess who's back!! Christ, it's been a truly disgusting number of years since I last updated. The good news is that I finally, officially, genuinely, actually managed to finish writing the rest of this fic. It's been something of a personal goal of mine, actually; I swore to myself that even if it took a decade, I would finish writing and publishing this fic. I owe it to the idealistic 14-year-old writer who started writing ACOMI with nothing more than an AU premise and a vague idea of a climactic scene.
The tattoo was undoubtedly grim. It had to be; after all, the Death Eaters had chosen it to inspire fear in the hearts of all who saw it. But it was also a little nonsensical, Draco supposed. Why a snake, of all animals? And why combine the snake with a skull? If the skull represented Death, wouldn’t this image imply that Death was doing the eating rather than being eaten as the “Death Eater” epithet suggested?
Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, to each and every one of you who has read this fic, and who has left kudos, and who has taken the time to comment and leave encouragement for me. There have been times where I thought it might be better if I just abandoned this fic, but your comments encouraged me to push through each and every time.
He was shaking now, his hands trembling against his thighs and his vision narrowing until all he could see was Harry. He didn’t know what he wanted to say. All he knew was that Harry had no right to decide what Draco owed him. How dare Harry accuse Draco of not caring when he didn’t hold the cards Draco did? “Not everything is about you! You’re not some blameless victim. In all the time we were together, you never even
Seconds later, two girls came sprinting around the corner as well. They peered around the quiet library, obviously looking for something, and walked to Draco when they saw him.
Against all odds, Lucius lowered the weapon. “You’re right,” he said softly. But that was too easy. There had to be a catch. Draco held his breath, dreading Lucius’ next words. “If I killed him myself, you wouldn’t learn a thing.” He whirled around, his long coat whipping imperiously behind him, and approached Draco. When he was within arm’s reach, he spun the pistol in his hand and proffered it grip-first. “Kill him yourself, Draco, and perhaps I’ll be merciful when addressing your transgressions.”
Harry responded to the compliment by biting lightly down on Draco's shoulder, laving over the bite a second later with his tongue to take away the sting. He grazed his hand down Draco's torso before grabbing his hip and maneuvering him so that Draco lay flat on the bed with Harry straddling his waist.
But maybe he still had a chance. Harry had criticized him for not knowing how to lean on others for help, and he had been right. If Draco apologized to Harry now and told him the truth, would Harry see that he had changed? That he was trying to be better? And even if Harry turned Draco away, what did Draco have to lose? They had already broken up. Harry had nothing more to hold over Draco’s head.
"Draco," Potter said quietly, concerned. "Are you alright? I didn't think my question was that horrifying." Potter attempted a smile to accompany his latter words, but the attempt at humor fell flat.
"I did not abandon you," Draco scoffed. "I went to class. We are uni students, Harry, and that means occasionally attending class and learning things."
Slowly, Draco moved to get a better sight line on Harry. He kept Lucius in his field of vision as well, unwilling to give Lucius a chance to deploy any tricks hidden up his well-fitting designer sleeves. He raised the gun and aimed down the sight. The head wasn’t the most effective target, but a point blank shot would be devastating nonetheless. Besides, Draco knew Lucius well enough to suspect he expected a show; aiming for the chest or femoral artery simply did not offer the same melodrama. All the while, Harry’s eyes remained unseeing. Harry’s catatonia was worrying, but Draco filed it away to talk about later. He had other priorities right now.
"Um. Thanks?" Harry said. His eyes flickered to Draco's, a plea for help spelled clearly within them. Draco just turned his gaze to the table and snickered.
I wanted to play a drinking game while writing and editing this chapter called "take a shot every time I have a crisis over a dialogue tag" but I would have died. This chapter has reminded me why I avoid dialogue like the plague lmao; purple prose is easier to write when it doesn't have to sound natural.
The words hit Draco with such force that he wondered for a moment whether Lucius had shot him, though when he darted a glance toward Lucius’ holster, he found the gun still sheathed. Lucius was entirely correct; Draco had been the one to invite Harry into his life, the one to drop his guard and entangle Harry in his unresolved problems. For every moment when he had thought he might finally deserve to be happy, this moment was proving him utterly, irrevocably wrong.
Comments are adored. Pls pls pls leave a comment, even if it's just a few words! I'll love you forever if you do.
Harry apparently thought so as well, since he pulled back and frowned at Draco. He seemed to take in Draco’s tired eyes and halfhearted smile for the first time, and his frown deepened. “What happened? Are you alright?” he asked.
Harry released a short, explosive breath, and Draco flinched instinctively at the abrupt sound in their otherwise quiet flat. It was a subtle action, a slight tensing of his already rigid body, but he knew Harry had noticed. After a moment of silence, Harry turned and made his way into the living room, and Draco forced himself to follow. He sat on the opposite end of the couch from Harry, leaving over a foot of distance between them. His posture was stiff, his hands clasped firmly in his lap. He waited for Harry to speak.
"I'll be fine," he drawled, dismissing Harry's concerns. "Besides, loathe as I am to agree with Weasley, you'll only be a phone call away. If I ever do feel inclined to burst into tears, even though that's your area of expertise rather than mine, I'll simply call you."
Yaxley led Draco to a car idling in the street, where he opened the passenger door and motioned for Draco to enter. Draco saw no choice but to step inside. The door slammed shut behind him before he’d even sat down, pitching Draco off balance. Yaxley settled into the backseat soon after.
"A reminder," Draco answered quietly. "Of a mistake I made, once. A mistake that ended in a lot of pain for a lot of people." He left it at that, fear coursing through his veins at the thought of revealing more than he already had. Some part of his brain still expected Harry to recognize the tattoo and bolt, irrational as the conviction was, and Draco was surprised he hadn't already done so. It wasn't exactly an obscure symbol; if Harry really wanted to know the story behind it, he could easily Google the image.
They left the shop a while later before they could be kicked out by the visibly irritated staff, who were no doubt upset the two boys were taking seats that could be occupied by paying customers instead. Laughing to themselves at the glares they were receiving, they fled to a nearby bookstore for lack of anything better to do.
Harry didn’t respond, and Draco didn’t press the issue. Some of the pressure had eased upon offering an explanation. He’d achieved a sort of clarity: whether Harry accepted his explanation was out of Draco’s control. That knowledge was tremendously freeing.
Harry ignored his words and trained a steely gaze on Draco. The fire burning in his eyes simultaneously made Draco want to look away and held him captive. The feeling of having Harry’s entire attention focused on Draco was addicting, in spite of the dread currently pooling in Draco’s chest.
Draco felt like he was in hell for the rest of the day. Every sudden or loud noise sent a jolt of paranoia through his body. He had to force himself not to check over his shoulder every time he saw a shadow in his periphery. He took to avoiding his own reflection, knowing he would only find bloodshot eyes and gaunt skin staring back at him if he cared to look. He turned the television on briefly, hoping the Christmas spirit would take his mind off his worries, but he turned it off just moments later when the bright cheeriness and blinding optimism was too jarring for the unease that still lingered in his mind. Somewhere in between, he managed to send Harry a text saying “Happy Christmas!”, the cheery words at complete odds with how Draco really felt.
Draco made a decision. It was just one date, after all. And here, so far from his father's influence and the bloodied skeletons rattling in his closet, Draco couldn't justify letting fear dictate his life. Potter was right; he was only refusing to take this plunge because he was afraid. But Draco was done being afraid.
A week before Christmas day, Harry absently pointed out the lack of a proper Christmas tree in the flat, and the two braved the cold weather and holiday crowds to hunt down the perfect specimen. They found it eventually, a plastic, moderately-priced neon monstrosity wedged behind two larger packages containing faux-evergreen trees. Draco was hard-pressed to contain his disdain for the gaudy tree, but he had to admit it had begun to grow on him by the time they lugged it back to the flat.
They had reached the station by then, and Draco fell silent as he focused on scanning his card and following Harry to the correct platform. He took a minute to regain his composure and properly consider Harry's invitation.
Harry left for the Weasleys' the next morning, despite his numerous protests that he couldn't leave Draco after a night as emotionally charged as they had just shared. Draco simply manhandled him towards the door in response and thrust his duffel into his chest.
Draco paused. Distantly, he realized a few students crossing the quad had noticeably slowed to watch the fight unfold. He considered walking back to Harry, or imploring Harry to lower his voice. But resignation was quickly beginning to weigh down his limbs, and he couldn’t find the energy to turn around, much less willingly re-enter the fight Harry was trying to pick. Instead, he closed his eyes and clenched his hands into fists and waited for Harry to finish.
Harry sighed. "I wish you'd make more of an effort to get along with Ron," he said. The argument was a familiar one, since Harry and Draco both staunchly refused to change their stances.
*does the screaming thing* On one hand, I survived finals. On the other hand, I had to give up sleep and any semblance of an eating schedule in order to do so. Anyway, happy new year! I'm really sorry for the delay in updates, I've been super busy and then ACOMI just slipped my mind. I've also hit a pretty bad case of writer's block, and I was a little reluctant to upload a new chapter when I hadn't made any progress on the rest of the fic.
Draco laughed involuntarily. “The Draco you wanted is already dead,” he replied, “and his blood is on your hands.”
You don't care about that, though! So I'll save the introspective rambling for the end of the fic, once I've published the rest of it. For now, please know that there are 4 more chapters after this one, and I aim to update at least once a week (though I may update more frequently; it would be kind of cool to mark this complete before 2020 ends).
They went ice skating once, a few days after buying the tree. Draco immediately took to the ice, but Harry couldn't seem to skate more than a meter without falling spectacularly. Draco teased him mercilessly about it as they made their way back to the flat, cheeks red and fingers shoved deep into their coat pockets. Harry retaliated by sticking a handful of snow down the back of Harry's shirt, leading Draco to declare war. By the time the two stumbled through Harry's door, they were cold and wet, snow clinging to their clothes like a second skin. Neither boy could stop laughing.
Draco's mouth went dry. He had steadily grown more willing to come out to his and Harry's friends, even if he wasn't entirely comfortable, since he at least knew they would be supportive. But the thought of announcing his sexual preferences to a group of virtual strangers was enough to give him heart palpitations. He would never be able to maintain control in a situation that unpredictable and potentially volatile.
Harry looked at him curiously, but they had reached the register by then, and Harry was forced to redirect his attention to the cashier instead of Draco's estrangement from his parents.
Draco’s eyes snapped open at that, and he turned to look at Harry head-on. “Is that really what you think is going on?” he asked, hardly able to believe what he’d just heard.
He turned to face Yaxley, his jaw clenched, eyes narrowed. "Even if Father was feeling uncharacteristically merciful, he would never have sent a subordinate to escort me home," Draco said dismissively. "He wouldn't have trusted anyone else enough. So tell me why you're really here, and don't lie to me." He bit the last phrase out through clenched teeth, not bothering to hide his contempt for Yaxley.
When Harry's voice cut through the silence, it was hesitant and unsteady, a sharp contrast from the determination burning in his eyes. "My parents died when I was eleven," he said. "It was a car crash. We were driving home from an audition for some children's show, I forget what it was now, when someone ran a red and barrelled into us."
A handful of Death Eaters milled about behind Lucius like bodyguards, all of whom had their Dark Marks exposed. The visual reminder of Draco’s shared connection with these criminals and murderers sent a shiver down his spine. He assumed they were similarly armed. After all, Draco was a hostile force as far as Lucius was concerned, a renegade who may need to be subdued at any moment. Draco was painfully exposed in comparison, and goosebumps prickled along his arms.
Still, Draco wasn't lucky enough for Harry to drop the conversation entirely. The reprieve he was granted was mournfully short, and just moments after they left the shopping center, Harry asked, "So where are you staying over break, then?"
Draco jolted awake, heart racing and sweat soaking through his clothes. He threw the covers off his body and rolled onto his side, outstretched hands groping blindly for the lamp. He finally managed to turn it on, and he examined his hands in the resulting light, fully expecting them to be soaked in the blood of innocents.
He had told himself he wasn't a coward this morning, and in fact had used that as a rationale for meeting with Harry. But wasn't his very presence at university a contradiction of that? He had chosen to run away from the memories that haunted them rather than undergo the confrontations he knew he would have to face eventually. Instead of making his peace with the person he had been, he had pushed those consequences an interminable distance into the future, reasoning that he would be better equipped to deal with them later instead of burdening himself with them now.
The setting sun had leeched the warmth from the air, leaving behind only a brisk wind. Draco felt immune to it. Molten anger flooded his veins, leaving behind smoldering embers to warm him from within.
“Harry,” Draco cried out before he could stop himself. His mind had gone blank at the sight of his boyfriend—well, his ex-boyfriend now—trussed up like any other Death Eater target. He wanted to rush forward and make sure the other man was alright, to cut him loose and reassure him that everything would be okay. But before he could take a single step, Lucius cleared his throat, and in a rush, Draco remembered that a single false move could spell the end for both of them.
“When my parents died, my aunt and uncle got custody of me,” Harry said before Draco could break the silence with an explanation, or an apology, or anything at all. “They resented me. They had a son already: Dudley. He was about my age but twice my size, and he had just as many brain cells as letters in his name. The lot of them thought my parents were liberal embarrassments who coddled me far too much, and that I was in sore need of discipline, so in their infinite wisdom, they decided to starve the insolence out of me. I stopped acting because I was too busy trying to scrounge up dinner most nights to worry about learning lines.
Sure enough, Dolohov pulled up to another drab warehouse, its façade nearly identical to the others that lined the block. Draco climbed out as soon as the car came to a standstill, taking a brief moment to orient himself and take stock of his surroundings. Then he moved toward the entrance, not waiting for Yaxley and Dolohov to catch up. They may have brought him here, but he didn’t have to be delivered inside by them.
As the last of the gunfire echoed through the warehouse, Draco registered a faint noise—gravel shifting, the whisper of clothing catching on metal—and he turned and put a bullet centimeters in front of a Death Eater who had tried to rush toward Lucius. “Move again and I’ll adjust my aim,” he shouted to the three remaining Death Eaters. He locked eyes with each of them, ensuring they saw the manic determination blazing in his eyes.
By now, the handful of other patrons in the small restaurant had also begun to take notice of the situation. It was clear that the attention was unsettling for Harry, if the way he was nervously wringing his hands was any indication. "Um," Harry started, glancing helplessly at Draco. "I don't really-"
A chill ran down Draco’s spine. So Yaxley had had access to Harry’s phone—and presumably Harry himself—since at least this morning. He couldn’t have taken Harry any earlier than the night before, though; Harry had made no mention of Yaxley during their breakup. However long Harry had been in Yaxley’s clutches, he was probably still nearby, close enough to be used as leverage.
Weasley's animosity seemed only to grow when, a week later, Draco rolled his suitcase through Harry and Weasley's front door. If looks could kill, Draco mused, he was sure the intensity of Weasley's gaze would have flayed Draco's skin from his bones the second he crossed the threshold. The redhead fumed silently from where he stood angrily, arms crossed and shoulder stiff with tension, in the kitchen.
He didn’t give the Death Eaters time to react. As Lucius cried out, Draco fired three more times, and Montague, Yaxley, and Dolohov all crumpled, their own weapons falling from their hands and hitting the concrete floor with reverberating cacophony.
"Then why are we just standing here talking? Go on, make the popcorn, we have movies to watch and actors to heckle," Draco said imperiously, urging Harry to start moving.
The assessment was not overly inaccurate. On each of the rare occasions they had met, Weasley had made a point to impress upon Draco the severity of the consequences he would face if he broke Harry's heart. Weasley's overprotective behavior would have been endearing, in much the same way a precocious toddler was endearing, had Draco not found it so immensely irritating already.
Despite his concern for Harry, and the anger he felt that someone could have reduced the boy to the nearly catatonic mess sitting on Draco's bed, Draco had to concede that he had a point. Draco couldn't very well expect Harry to reveal the details of his past when Draco himself wasn't comfortable returning the gesture.
“But then I watched him execute one of my mother’s friends over some meaningless transgression without so much as flinching. His complete lack of remorse was startling. The way he walked away without a word while my mother stood witness, tears slipping down her cheeks…” Draco clenched his fists where they rested on his thighs, taking comfort in the pain radiating from the crescents his nails were carving into his palms. “He had no room in his life for trivial things like mercy and compassion. It changed my whole perception of him, and of my own life. I couldn’t become him; I didn’t
He was brought abruptly to the present when Potter clasped a hand around Draco's left forearm. Draco's eyes flew open and he pulled away sharply, shrinking further back into the couch before he fully processed the situation. Then he stiffened, wondering how Potter would react.
Breathless, Draco gives a jerky little nod, and takes Harry’s hand, pulling him towards the house. He steps into the kiddie pool that Harry should have put away a week ago, and by the time they’re in the living room downstairs, Harry is wheezing.
“Today was amazing. Thanks for letting me invite my friends.” Harry settled more comfortably. “We should spend a few weeks on an island somewhere in the Pacific next winter. We’ll wear Santa hats on the beach and write Merry Christmas in the sand,” he murmured in Draco’s ear, holding him close. Draco had bought a new shampoo, and Harry loved the smell and the silky quality it gave to his hair.
He looked at her and winced at the worry in her brown eyes. He took a deep breath and asked, “Is there a spell to find parts of an object I already own?”
He watched her bounce towards the kitchen where Potter was making tea, still bewildered, then shook himself and decided to investigate.
Maybe Harry could have fun in a pub with his friends in his current headspace. Or invite them over tomorrow. Those rum-infused-cherries brownies will kill him if he eats them all by himself. Might as well share. He starts mixing the cocoa and sugar with an old whisk, imagining how the evening would go, who would sit at the head of the table and joke about being the master of the house, who would get drunk the fastest, what they’d talk about — and his movements stop. He pictures it a little too well. Harry has nothing to say. He’ll find a topic, like crows and their ability to mimic (he researched it after meeting Loki, sue him), or Kneazles because he took Teddy to the shelter yesterday, or perhaps the book series since he finished the latest issue and is dying to see what happens but the next part won’t be out for two years. He’ll be enthusiastic. Words will fall from his mouth and everyone will tune him out, or pretend to listen until someone mentions Quidditch or scandalous gossip or Auror raids. And he’ll blame himself for being boring and fucked-up.
Instead of hitting Malfoy, the spell threw him violently against the sink, breaking the porcelain before an explosion of light made Harry’s grip on his wand falter. The rumble that followed, echoing through the stone walls, startled him badly. Blinded and deafened, he lost his balance as the floor undulated under his feet, and the tiles shattered into dust.
“Let me guess: Granger helped,” Draco said, flipping through the pages and glancing at the colourful pictures of starfish and sea lilies. “Okay, so, invertebrates. Got it. Not sure what I expected.” He found the relevant page and his eyebrows rose. “What the—how do I make these things child-friendly?”
Mother brushes Scorpius’ messy blonde hair away from his forehead. “I will, sweetheart. Now go get ready, you still need to wash your hands.” When Scorpius leaves, now humming to the tune of
Grimmauld Place looked nothing like the horror-show it had once been. Years ago, months of tearing down walls and stripping down tapestries had turned it into a home Harry didn’t hate, even if it was still old, temperamental and impersonal. He might’ve cared if he hadn’t been living at Hogwarts for the past decade. If he kept travelling, it’d take him a long time to put any effort into his decorating choices.
The siege wards didn’t vanish overnight, not even after the gash in his leg had healed. Finding potions in his room had most likely saved him from blood poisoning, but there was a different pain to deal with now. Lying on his side in that oddly lumpy bed, his feet sticking out from under the covers as he was too tall to fit, Draco stared at the pale skin of his left forearm.
He must have been staring at the picture a little too long because he found the redhead standing next to him with a little smirk on her freckled face. He had to admit she had grown into a beautiful woman. Not that he was attracted to her. The only reason he had managed to conceive Scorpius was that he had been drunk and, from what he pieced together, had been fucked by Theo (probably. Whoever it was had been behind or under him) while Astoria rode him. Women had never been attractive to him. He could appreciate beauty when he saw it, though.
“It’s not the rock, Malfoy.” He took a few steps around it, then peered at his confused companion from the opposite side. “There’s something beneath.”
Teddy bounced up and down, holding a scrap of parchment with what looked like a potato with a long neck, drawn in blue and green ink. Draco had become quite adept at pretending to be in awe of Teddy’s questionable artistic talent. “This looks great, why don’t you show Harry?”
The result was a tasteful décor, mindful of the style of the house but no longer ostentatious, dark, or Grimmauld Place-y. Malfoy liked blue, and Harry took his inspiration from the Ravenclaw common room, though he varied the shades so the colours wouldn’t be too strong. Pansy told him he’d be welcome at her interior decorating firm if he ever wanted to learn and ultimately get a chance at a career again. A year ago, Harry would’ve taken her up on her offer (and hoped he didn’t cause any scandal). Today, though? Harry couldn’t imagine doing anything different.
Draco and Harry extended their stay in Ethiopia by a few days, taking some time to visit the lush Semien Mountains after the alien sights of Dallol. They even took a peek from afar at a church in Lalibela despite the warnings but quickly Apparated back to the safety of a wizarding settlement before someone spotted them. Draco believed that, ironically, the most religious areas of the country were warded against magicians. He wondered if a magical being had been forced to create them, or if they'd been paid handsomely. He found he'd rather not know.
And Harry saw it. Malfoy’s left sleeve had moved just enough to reveal the black lines of his fake Mark. Fascination overtook his brain, and he attempted to push the sleeve further back, but Malfoy kicked his feet violently and shoved him—and that was when the rumble started again. Harry was yanked off the ground and stuck to a wall. On the opposite end of the room, Malfoy was struggling against invisible bonds, and in the portrait frame, Slytherin watched, unimpressed.
Gabriel shook his head, his Veela ancestry giving him the predatory look that Draco had once seen on an incensed Fleur. “Moldu, avec quelques charmes en plus. Tu peux le faire disparaître.
“Harry, I’m allowed to drink water once in a while.” She bit her lower lip but couldn’t prevent the spread of a smile, and Harry’s breath caught in his throat.
He checks the wards around the house one last time, grabs the luxury food basket he bought this morning, and Apparates to Ottery St. Catchpole. He’s nervous as the Burrow looms over him.
Draco attempted to hit him with a pillow, and Harry didn’t have the strength to hit back. He was lulled into a dazed sleep before he could blink.
Draco agreed quietly, but Kreacher didn’t, and he could hear him mumbling in the background. His stomach joined in with a squeaky rumble that sent both Draco and Harry in a fit of giggles, and Draco thought that maybe it wasn’t so bad to fail sometimes. As long as it brought a smile to Harry’s lips, Draco would enjoy it.
He imagined himself biting those arsecheeks, leaving marks behind and running a finger from Harry’s balls to his anus. He’d massage the back of his thighs, spread his buttocks and lick a path between them, teasing his hole, nipping at it, and slowly, so slowly, he’d flatten his tongue on it. Potter would beg, his hole would quiver, and Draco would make him wait. He’d step back and stroke his cock, heavy and leaking, then he’d go back and push his thumb inside Harry, just enough for him to push back. He’d add his tongue after that, lapping as Potter’s desperate pleas would grow louder. He’d feel him attempt to fuck himself on Draco’s tongue. Draco’s hands would leave red streaks on his arse as he’d sucked until his hole gaped, and when Harry’s entire body would start to shake, he’d flip him around and would take his cock deep in his throat, fingering his hole and swallowing around his girth until Potter emptied himself down Draco’s throat.
Draco then demanded a cuddle. Then another. He was a needy man, and Potter indulged him, so what else could he possibly want?
To the left of the counter, a wooden staircase led to a balcony offering more privacy than the lonely table in front of the window. Draco always took a seat as far from the door as possible, so after Harry ordered a cinnamon tea, they found a spot upstairs, hidden from view. The photographers had their picture, now the couple needed some peace. Draco removed his winter cloak and sat on the cosy banquette seat. He kept the scarf. “Potter. Why did I not know you spoke French?”
Mrs Malkin makes him stand on a small stool to measure him. She’s there, but she’s not, at the same time.
“No no no no no... please let me out, please let me go!” He looked around and gasped as if he couldn’t breathe.
After smoothing his wrinkled trousers, Harry started biting his nails. Draco gave him a gentle slap to make him stop and Harry blew him a raspberry in return. Then Harry stood up. “I can make pasta. There’s cheese, but no tomatoes.”
That peace was shattered, unfortunately, by an unearthly wail, and suddenly a decrepit house-elf appeared in the bathroom and squinted at them, Vanishing the shower curtain with a snap of his fingers. “What has Master done to Kreacher’s kitchen?”
Draco hesitated, but his cock won. He grabbed his wand, cast the spell on his mouth and on Harry’s, and flipped Harry over, pressing his pelvis against the very hard, very noticeable bulge in his pants. “You have good ideas, sometimes.”
“Well, aren’t we looking sexy tonight, Malfoy. Who would’ve thought you could tan. How long did it take before you went from lobster to sex on legs?”
There’s one thing Draco doesn’t like about the third Sunday of the month, and it’s visiting Malfoy Manor to pick up his son. He knows it's all in his head at this point, but he can’t shake the memories of the Dark Lord’s rotten magic seeping through the walls and poisoning the air he breathes. Unfortunately, after years of exile, Mother and Father have chosen to come back, purify the grounds, and settle there permanently. So, regardless of how rude it is, Draco Apparates into the main hallway so that he can avoid looking at the house looming over him from the top of the hill. Mother understands and never says a word about it. Floo travel is out of the question; Scorpius is allergic to Floo powder.
Harry glanced at the area he pointed at. This desert, like many others, hid the traces of old magical villages or cities—ruins invisible to Muggles and often undiscovered by modern witches and wizards. The world was too vast; there were few magical beings around, even less with the required qualifications. Archaeology in their world uncovered secrets at a snail’s pace compared to the Muggle world, even with the different spells that should’ve made the process easier and faster. The study itself wasn’t popular. The lack of a museum dedicated to magical history spoke for itself. Instead, the nations under the International Confederation of Wizards formed Unspeakables—too busy with other matters, like the mysteries of magic itself—or Curse-Breakers, whose job was more about disabling traps than finding broken pieces of antique pottery. Those who wanted to get involved in archaeology went to Muggle universities and usually worked in the Muggle world afterwards.
Kreacher had done an excellent job in the entrance hall; he’d dusted and repaired a lamp that Harry hadn’t realised was there, and the hallway was a bit more inviting now. Harry didn’t care much. Ever since he’d gotten rid of Walburga’s portrait and the revolting artefacts like the taxidermied troll leg, he’d been fine in this house. He’d filled it with the laughter of his godson and the company of friends, so he couldn’t care less about the gaudy porcelain and the colour of the walls. Besides, Teddy liked the house. He claimed it was like the ghost train at the fair. It said a lot that Harry would want to make some changes so Malfoy would be comfortable.
The wards started to waver. Not enough to let anyone through, but it encouraged Smith who, for an instant, looked eerily like Bellatrix, with a full, deranged smile and a malicious glint in his watery eyes.
An old, almost forgotten sense of excitement spread through Harry’s limbs. He looked at Draco, who winked.
The man's eyebrows rose. "I dare say she'd have no trouble at all, then. Opal, I should think." He gestured towards a selection of glittering stones, different from what Draco knew of opals. Some were red, bright green or blue, with many different patterns. He let out a breath as he found the perfect stone; it was a warm, golden orange, like a flame encased in a polished shell. The light reflecting on it still brought out a rainbow of other colours typical of opals, but the yellow and orange seemed to glow. It was a beauty.
Gabriel, on the other hand, had moved to England with his parents after graduating from Beauxbâtons. His initial motivation for leaving was to be closer to his sister and nieces. The next? St. Mungo’s new hormone therapy program, which wasn’t available in France yet, due to the distasteful opinions of their new Minister for Magic. French magicians were stuck with the old potion and its side-effects or had to seek treatment in the Muggle world. If someone had told Harry, before Voldemort’s defeat, that one day, the British Ministry would do better than its counterparts, he might’ve laughed. It was all thanks to the tremendous efforts of a wizarding association founded by Millicent Bulstrode and Alicia Spinnet. It helped that Minister Shacklebolt had listened to them.
“Fine. Riddle me this: why are you so intent on living in a house that stinks of dark magic, where your godfather was miserable for his entire childhood? Seriously, Grimmauld Place feels like the Manor during the war, and that’s just from standing on the doorstep. By the way, your elf is a nutter.”
Sheepish, Harry folded his coat and placed it beside him. “I don’t speak it. I understand the context of a conversation if it’s not too complicated. Victoire is very demanding; even Ron speaks it a bit, and he’s terrible at languages. He almost caused an international incident when he was sent to France on that weird Voldemort cult case.”
“I forgot, alright? My mother’s portrait was screaming at me, and I wasn’t prepared!” His eyes roamed over both of them. “And I didn’t need to see you two in that position, ever!”
“She’s right, but you don’t want bits of feathers on your biscuits, do you?” Harry flicked his wand and Vanished the stray feathers and the content of the bowl before mixing icing sugar and lemon. “There! Good as new.”
From what he remembered from Sixth Year, they’d been attached at the hip, so something went wrong. He could swear it.
Croaker’s theory, which Draco had confirmed through Scrying, was that smaller or harmless spirits didn’t need light to get through, but that the lantern used by the monster was its only ticket out. The type of entity mattered; which, yes, meant there were likely worse ones out there that hadn’t found an exit yet. In the case of Harry’s stalker, its lantern seemed to be the only one made of wood, whatever that meant. If he asked, Draco would talk about Animancy and Arithmantic equations until Harry’s brain oozed from his ears.
“I did. This is your bathroom and next door, there’s an entire room just for you. You never need to go back into the cupboard.”
“Potter.” The first thing Malfoy did upon entering the house was sneeze, and Kreacher immediately pushed a potion in his hands with a horrified gasp. Malfoy stared at Harry, helpless as Kreacher dragged him away from the door. Harry watched the scene in confusion.
The sight of the room made him wish he’d chosen that one as his own space instead of selecting Sirius’. The bedding had been changed from its old-fashioned flowery style and was now pure white. Kreacher had swapped the heavy velvet curtains for a translucent fabric and had bought new candles, and the tapestry had been stripped to reveal dark wooden walls.
Rinsing the shampoo out of his hair, he decided to let temptation win. Wanking when he shared a tent with Scarhead was inconvenient; they’d taken a Portkey to London in the morning, so he hadn’t given in to his urges yet. His right hand shook as he grabbed the base of his half-hard cock and rubbed the pad of his thumb on his soft skin. He pictured it; the dip of Potter’s lower back, the shape of his buttocks, his thighs—fuck, Draco wanted to slide his cock between them.
It had taken them a month to find a magical artefact, out of the blue, but it was enough to convince them to keep up with their plan. Rogue archaeologists, unwelcome on dig sites, sneered at by academics—none of that mattered. They took a Portkey to Iran next, just because they could, and they’d been there long enough now that they already planned their next stop. Perhaps Egypt or Jordan. Though, right now, the rock Malfoy had noticed was a more immediate concern.
Salazar was a wise man, even if Draco didn’t appreciate his every word. He was a wizard who’d been directly affected by the fear, intolerance, and cruelty of Muggles, yet still allowed Muggleborns into Hogwarts. “They’re in more danger than you, little Malfoy,” he’d said. And they were. He saw that now.
It was so quiet. No wind, no animals, just the sound of their steps. The night was clear, the stars breathtaking, away from any artificial source of light. Harry tried to recognise a few constellations, though he’d never paid much attention in Astronomy. He didn’t know why Draco wanted to be there tonight, but he loved every second of it. “Thanks for bringing me here,” he whispered in Draco’s ear. “It’s lovely.”
Sitting as far from the exit as he was, Draco couldn’t beat the crowd of students out the door when lecture ended. He was jostled about by the throng, all equally as eager to leave as he was, and it was all he could do to keep pushing forward. As he finally managed to pass through the door, a student bumped him rather forcefully from behind, causing him to throw out both his arms in an effort to regain his balance and prevent himself from sprawling face first into a wall.
"Harry," said Draco in a low voice, turning the name into a question and a reassurance at the same time. He didn't look at Harry as he said it, though, preferring instead to burn a hole into the girl's head with his eyes. If looks could kill, he mused absently, she would have been drawn and quartered by his gaze within seconds.
Potter's own eyes narrowed in response. "If you're homophobic, you can shove your opinions up your ass," he said fiercely. He angrily raked a hand through his hair and glared at his lunch.
He lasted exactly thirteen minutes and twenty-four seconds from the start of the lecture before he broke down and sent Harry a text, though it contained little more than a simple "miss you." Harry responded a few minutes later, saying "miss you too." A second text followed the first, accompanied by a picture of Harry lying haphazardly on what seemed to be his bed: "wish you were here."
Instead of answering Yaxley’s question, Draco asked one of his own: “Are you alone this time as well, or has my father finally dismounted from his high horse and come to see me in person?”
Part of me was almost hesitant to finish writing and publishing ACOMI, because I've been working on it for so long that I can't conceive of a future where I'm not still working on it. I guess it's time to start another huge project that I've got no hopes of completing in a timely manner?
Draco's stomach chose that moment to gurgle loudly, reminding him that he hadn't eaten breakfast that morning. "Lunch sounds wonderful," he admitted, before setting about clearing his workspace and replacing all his papers in his bookbag.
Potter rested a hand on Draco's arm then, startling Draco. "Wait," Potter said, turning Draco to face him. Draco tried to take half a step back as he realized Potter was standing much closer than he had been before, but Potter had blocked him in against the door and there was nowhere he could go. He tried to block out the panic threatening to engulf him as Potter leaned in towards him, clearly broadcasting his intent and giving Draco ample time to pull away or stop him.
They were only meters from escaping when Lucius gathered his wits about him enough to shout, “There’s no coming back from this, Draco! If you choose that mongrel over your own father, your own blood, I swear I will consider you dead.”
Draco drew a shuddering breath. He nodded and tried to gather his thoughts. As horrified as he was on Harry’s behalf, he knew Harry wouldn’t care to hear his platitudes right now. Besides, this was the opportunity he had wanted all along, wasn’t it? To come clean? He would never forgive himself if he wasted it. “We truly are a matched set,” Draco said faintly. “My father is a powerful man. He sits atop a sprawling criminal network in London. I was drafted into his militia at thirteen; I started as a simple runner, but I climbed the ranks with ease, and when I was sixteen, my father began training me as a lieutenant. That’s when I took the Mark.” He twisted his left forearm to display the Mark in its entirety, though he still couldn’t bring himself to meet Harry’s gaze and discern his reaction. “It was an enjoyable lifestyle, even if I couldn’t stomach the violence at times. I relished the power I held.
Shakily, but no less determined for it, Draco said, “I rather hope they’ll see who I’ve become instead.”
The nightmares only grew worse. The Harry in his dreams stopped accusing Draco of the blood on his hands and started painting them instead. Night after night, Draco woke up convinced Harry was dead, that Harry had died by his hand. He would sneak into Harry’s bedroom and simply sit by his bedside for an hour or more, reassuring himself that Harry was still alive and unaffected by Draco’s crimes.
"As if I'm not?" Potter challenged. Draco's eyes widened in surprise, but suddenly he remembered Potter's skittish behavior when Draco had asked about his scar. It seemed Potter had his own secrets; Draco was surprised he'd managed to forget this vital piece of information. "I'm not looking for perfect, Draco. I'm just looking for happiness."
To his chagrin, Draco realized he had no idea what was happening onscreen, or how the movie had reached what appeared to be its climax. And Harry was right: Draco’s hands were clenched into fists in his lap, and his shoulders were taut with stress. Instantly he was barraged by guilt for disappointing Harry yet again, so soon after trying to make amends.
Before Harry could accept or deny anything, though, Draco needed to actually apologize first. He began planning his words as he walked, letting the process distract himself from thinking about his Mark.
“So that’s my secret,” he continued, his voice suddenly dripping with scorn. Draco couldn’t suppress his flinch. He looked away, unable to meet Harry’s eyes. “I have PTSD. Reminders of that night trigger me, mire me in flashbacks so intense it’s like I’m reliving every blow, which is why it’s so difficult to talk about. So what the fuck is your excuse? Do I finally deserve to know what the
"I much prefer spending time with you to that," Harry remarked, and Draco rolled his eyes in response.
I'd also like to take a moment to say thank you to everyone who has commented or left kudos on this fic. I appreciate you immensely; I can't believe there are still people out there interested in this dumb story haha.
Thankfully, he made it back to the flat without incident. He collapsed into bed without caring that daylight still filtered in through the windows, exhaustion claiming him within seconds.
“I’m saying we both need an unreal amount of therapy,” Harry deadpanned. “But for some inexplicable reason, I still love you. Let it never be said life is boring around you. Lucky for you, I’m something of an adrenaline junkie. And now that everything is on the table…” Harry paused and raised an eyebrow, inviting Draco to speak up if he had anything left to say. When Draco shook his head, Harry continued, “I’d like to get to know you better.”
His lack of response, far from discouraging Harry from distracting him while he was in class, instead served to inspire Harry to send a spate of texts ranging from the flirty ("thinking about you xx") to the utterly outrageous ("do you think aliens know what capitalism is?"). Draco eventually had to resort to silencing his phone, something he usually never did; there were only so many times he could feign a coughing fit to disguise his laughter before his peers grew either wary or suspicious of him. By the time his lecture ended, Draco had nearly twenty unread text messages from Harry. More importantly, to Draco's chagrin, he realized he had barely caught half of the lecture and would now have to borrow someone else's notes.
When they stood up to leave, Potter offered to walk Draco to wherever he was headed next. Draco wondered why Potter was so eager to spend more time with Draco, but he didn't voice his thoughts. Instead, he simply said, "I'm done with classes for the time being, so I'm just headed back to my dorm," and Potter nodded and fell in step, chatting amiably as they walked.
Draco scoffed. “Home? London isn’t my home anymore, Father. I’m done! With the Death Eaters, with the bloodshed and violence, with you. Do you honestly think you’re making a case for yourself by bringing me out here, by kidnapping my—” Draco swallowed past the lump in his throat. “By kidnapping Harry as leverage? He doesn’t pose a threat. You only involved him to justify your own power trip. Because you couldn’t stand letting me pave my own way. All of this”—Draco swept his hand across the tableau, from Harry to Lucius to the Death Eaters lurking in the back—“has only convinced me I made the right decision.” He paused, breathing heavily and trying to rein in the anger and panic sweeping through him. “I’m leaving now—”
“Answer the question, Draco.” While the statement was innocuous, the force Harry put into it was anything but. Draco knew he couldn’t keep stalling. Harry’s voice would rise as he grew more impatient, and soon their conversation would be audible to any student passing by. Draco didn’t relish the thought of all and sundry bearing witness to his private affairs.
“Dudley in particular took my existence as a personal attack. See, I’d taken the bedroom he used to store all his presents and toys, and he didn’t like that much. He made it his personal mission to make my life hell. Having his friends beat me up, destroying my clothes and books. When he caught me kissing Justin Finch-Fletchley in the schoolyard one afternoon, he couldn’t wait to squeal to my aunt and uncle. Needless to say, they didn’t approve.” Harry smiled thinly. “Things got heated. They called me every name under the sun, told me they wouldn’t abide this kind of behavior in their house, said my parents were lucky to be dead so they wouldn’t suffer the indignity of having a dirty little faggot for a child. Everything else, I could deal with, but speaking poorly about my parents?” Harry’s expression darkened. “Eventually things got physical. At some point, I was pushed face-first into the coffee table and sliced my forehead on the corner.” He ran his hand through his bangs, pushing them back to reveal the lightning bolt-shaped scar over his right eye. “I was sixteen then, and I decided it wasn’t worth sticking around after that. I packed my things up and snuck out the window that night. Lived with a neighbor for the next year so I could finish out my GCSEs. Uni was my ticket out.
“Funny how things work out,” Harry said some minutes later. Draco laughed quietly, a little desperately, and left it at that.
Potter ducked his head in embarrassment. "Fairly normal, yeah," he admitted. "Sometimes it seems like half the female population is after me, and a quarter of the males as well."
Potter was the first to break the silence. "It seems pretty obvious to me what we should do," he declared quietly. "You like me, I like you, there's no reason to keep dancing around each other."
They left the cinema suppressing fits of laughter, squinting their eyes against the blinding glare of sunlight that welcomed them back into reality. They reenacted their favorite scenes from the film as they ambled across the pavement towards a deli Draco had seen across the street from the cinema.
Despite his concern and curiosity, however, Draco didn't pry. Instead, he gently guided Harry onto the tube, through campus, and into his room. He sat Harry down on the bed before turning away to fetch him a bottle of water. He perched on his desk chair, watching in silence as Harry downed the bottle in one go.
Draco reeled. This wasn’t supposed to be happening. He had never wanted Harry to feel as though Draco didn’t care for him. Draco cared for him more than he had ever cared for any other person; that was why he’d kept Harry in the dark about his past, his family, his Mark.
"Tall, brown hair, glasses, wearing a gray shirt?" she listed, eyeing Draco hopefully. The taller one stared at him with rapt attention as well. He suppressed a shudder at the gleam in her eyes.
The new term started a few short days later, preventing Draco and Harry from revisiting their argument. Draco wasted no time in moving back to his dorm. Relief washed over him as he put the last of his things away, the outcome of knowing he would no longer have to wear a permanent mask. Yet guilt twinged in his chest as well, flaring sharply each time he remembered the hard line of Harry’s mouth as he delivered his ultimatum, or his hurt expression after Draco had flung accusations at him.
“Please don’t,” he begged, all thoughts of maintaining his dignity or gaining the upper hand vanishing from his mind. Lucius was right, had always been right. Draco had never stood a chance against the man who had taught him everything he knew.
Draco relegated himself to the couch after the ninth consecutive night of jerking awake in a cold sweat. He told Harry it was because he didn’t want to disturb Harry’s sleep in addition to his own, and this was true to an extent. More importantly, however, Draco didn’t want to give Harry a chance to figure out what he was dreaming about, whether by hearing Draco cry out in his sleep or by asking him questions when he was still too incoherent after waking up to think about what he was saying.
“I want to learn all of it. Curse-Breaking, Parselmagic, my heritage, everything.” He blinked, then turned to face Draco. “What—what about the Malfoys? Can I learn that, too?”
The stairs spiralled down for so long that Harry worried about Malfoy’s pain. The Slytherin was shaking. What if the wound got infected? There must be some potions here, hopefully, because Harry wasn’t sure what to do with medieval healing supplies. When they reached the bottom of the stairs, they found themselves in a long corridor similar to the dungeons, just with more snake statues and carvings. Two doors were already open, and Malfoy shut himself behind the first one. Harry promised himself to check on him in a few minutes and entered his own room, which looked like a museum with several large—but short—beds, lumpy mattresses and pillows, and a scribe desk. A bookshelf with rolled parchments and leather-bound books in the room intrigued him, and he felt slightly like Hermione as he examined them.
The realism of the painting stunned Harry. Not just because it had probably been painted around the Founding in a style that was pretty much never seen at the time (at least he thought it wasn’t), but because it was so well done, it looked like a photograph. It depicted a Middle-Eastern man with handsome features, dressed in a dark green tunic, a sword at his belt and a dark, unvarnished wand at his fist. He sported wavy black hair streaked with grey and striking sea-green eyes. Harry found himself blushing, to his horror. He liked girls, didn’t he? His eyes darted away from the portrait and landed on his rival, taking in his delicate features and his jawline.
“I don’t have a choice.” The wind blew Malfoy’s hair away from his face. “I refuse to impose on Aunt Andromeda again.”
Malfoy raised an elegant eyebrow. “Thank you, Potter. Just wait until you try to make him wash his hair.”
“Please, Potter, everyone knew her name. I used to admire her in the owlery, or when she flew outside.” He grins. “She always tried to peck my eyes out. She was lovely. I’m sorry you lost her.”
Chang had created a dozen swans, and Lovegood’s hare had been frozen in various poses. Over the past week, Pansy, Goyle, Zabini, Granger, half of the Weasley clan, all of Harry and Draco’s colleagues, and most of the infamous Dumbledore Army, had chosen to help. Not everyone could; corporeal Patroni were still too rare. But if they couldn’t cast one, they could dig into another talent, and despite the obvious reluctance of some of them, Mother had agreed to show them the neat Transfiguration trick she’d used when Draco was a child. Patronus or Transfigured snow, the result was the same.
He took a seat, opened the bottom drawer of his desk and grabbed his scrapbook, and stuck the parchment on a new page. He already had another book filled with brief notes or ridiculous drawings, and he threw none of them away, so he had to start a new one recently. Draco told him it was sappy, but his gaze softened each time he noticed Harry slipping one of his notes in his pocket.
“Ah, young Malfoy, I was discussing what a great pair you and young Potter would make, should you choose to join forces and roam the world together.”
“Godric and Rowena wished to keep the Compass. Its healing capabilities alone could save so many, yet in the wrong hands, it’d lead to disaster. Imagine what a corrupt monarch or a conqueror could do with it. Helga and I convinced them. We discovered that no magic could permanently destroy it. We even treated it as a Horcrux, to no avail. Even broken into pieces, it still worked, but the pieces had to be close together. We entrusted their fate to Helga and never asked her where she sent them. We swore to keep its existence a secret.”
“Er, Malfoy, you okay?” He may hate the fucking prick, but he didn’t want him dead. He silently berated himself for duelling, again—for letting his screwed-up mind take over because trauma dictated how he reacted if faced with hostility. He hadn’t wanted to fight. He’d just hoped to figure out what Malfoy was doing, sneaking around all year, but Malfoy had been
"Because I'm begging you to," the man said rather unnecessarily. He glanced over his shoulder, and Draco heard the sound of nearing footsteps. "Look, I'll owe you one, I'll buy you a meal or something. Please."
Harry laughed at his antics. "Alright, I'm leaving," he said, underscoring his reassurance by opening the door and stepping through. At the last second, he pulled Draco forward by his collar and kissed him deeply. "I'll see you in a few days," he promised, and then he was gone, the door swinging shut behind him.
“What else am I supposed to think?” Harry argued. His hands were curled into fists by his sides and he was leaning subconsciously towards Draco. “You don’t want to go out with me anywhere, you won’t spend time with me of your own free will, you won’t even trust me enough to tell me what’s bothering you! Maybe you’re scared of how serious this is becoming, maybe you’re afraid of being gay, I don’t know. But whatever it is, don’t try to spare my feelings by lying to me. I at least deserve your honesty.”
"Alright," he said. "One date, Potter. We'll see how it goes from there." Potter turned back towards him uncertainly, and Draco turned his gaze away again, tracing the wood grain of the desk with his eyes. "I'm not ready to come out to the world as a whole, though," he admitted quietly, wondering if Potter would be content to keep their relationship secret. He hadn't thought about the fact that after putting himself completely on the line, this one detail could turn it all on its head.
"Eighteen, also studying law," Harry responded, surprise and pleasure coloring his tone. "I like reading but only if it isn't required for class, and I enjoy a game of rugby from time to time."
Feeling uncomfortably guilty, Draco swallowed his own discomfort and reached out for Harry's hand as they walked towards the door. He rubbed soothing circles on Harry's skin, trying to convey a silent apology and offer some small comfort in the tense atmosphere of the cafe. Harry squeezed Draco's hand in silent acknowledgement, and to Draco's delight, he noticed that Harry was smiling slightly.
He got none of that. Instead, the students immediately shifted to pass around him, with one girl saying only, “Wicked ink, Malfoy,” before continuing on her way.
Frantically, Draco scrabbled at his left sleeve, pushing it up to his elbow to stare at what lay below. A menacing skull was inked into his skin near his elbow, an intricate snake protruding from its mouth and winding its way up to Draco's wrist. The tattoo rippled ominously as Draco clenched his fist. Draco imagined the snake breaking free of its restraints and lifting off of Draco's arm, hissing malevolently as it aimed for Draco's jugular. Even now, inanimate though it was, its glittering eyes seemed to hold Draco in reproach not only for the horrifying acts he had committed in the past, but also for his attempt to run from them instead of facing them head on.
Wow, college has been kicking my butt. I'm so sorry to have left you all hanging, I haven't had much time to work on ACOMI recently orz but never fear! I have the next few chapters written and I'm working on the rest so you will get an end to this hell eventually! Thank you so much to everyone who's stuck with me this far.
A soft smile stretched his lips as memories of their date flooded back to him. Once more he felt the giddiness that had been buzzing through him all morning, and he remembered exactly why he had agreed to date Harry. Harry had the ability to convince Draco that everything would work out in its own time.
“Nothing permanent,” Yaxley replied, “though I can’t guarantee things will stay that way. Perhaps things would be different if you had come by this morning when I’d asked you to.”
On the other hand, my notes for chapter 12 were, in their entirety, "Breakup :D". I've spent a depressing amount of time staring at that one word and wishing I could go back in time to wring some more information out of my past self.
Draco left his Mark bare as he made his way to Harry’s flat. The sight of it still threatened to send him spiraling into anxiety, but it hadn’t yet. Maybe seeing Draco’s bare arm would convince Harry that Draco’s apology was sincere, and that he was willing to put in the effort to come to terms with his past.
Draco breathed in. Turned back to Harry. Noticed distantly that his hand had never once wavered, muscle memory keeping his motions smooth and steady.
“Someone who knows his worth,” Draco replied. “Someone who is confident, who can be vulnerable and honest and have relationships with others that aren’t founded on fear and violence.”
"You're deciding wrong," Draco said sullenly, despite knowing Potter was right. Draco had done his duty in warning Potter off, and now it was up to Potter whether he wanted to listen.
Draco opened the door to find Potter holding up a six-pack with a hopeful smile. Draco sighed again and walked away from the door without bothering to check if Potter followed, tossing a "Lock the door behind you" over his shoulder as he did. He curled up comfortably on his couch, tucking his knees underneath him, and held out a hand imperiously for a beer.
Draco took a breath to calm himself, glad that he had positioned himself so that Yaxley couldn't see how shaken he was. He needed to convince Yaxley of his conviction if he wanted to keep the upper hand in this already-tenuous conversation. "I don't owe you any justifications, Yaxley," Draco said. "Tell Father to come collect me himself, if he truly desires me to return. He must be losing his touch if he thinks I'll view this treatment as anything but an insult."
“I’ll stop by once I’m done with classes,” he responded. His thumb hovered uncertainly over the “send” button, but with a final exhale, he pushed his fears aside and pressed the button. Then he pocketed his phone, slung his bag over his shoulder, and left for his next class, trying not to care who saw his Mark along the way.
“Potter, of course,” Yaxley purred. He turned his back on Draco once more and strode away. This time, Draco followed without a word.
Even as he agonized over the consequences of this decision, his phone buzzed with a text. Draco glanced at it, his heart rate speeding up when he saw it was from Harry. He unlocked his phone to find a short and sweet "can't wait to see you again" waiting for him.
“Is he all that’s keeping you here? Are you reluctant to return home because you don’t want to leave him behind? I can make that decision tremendously easy for you,” Lucius drawled. He cocked the gun, and the other Death Eaters followed suit. Draco remained rooted to the spot, frantically trying to find a way to save Harry and escape with both their lives in hand. But it didn’t matter how he approached the situation; he came up blank every time.
with is none of your business,” Draco said tightly. “Besides, he’s a friend, nothing more. There was no need to involve him.”
The man was not sore on the eyes, that much was true. His eyes were a piercing green, his nose straight and narrow, his muscles clearly defined. His bronze skin only completed the tantalizing image. Still, his hair was an absolute mess, and his round, wire frame spectacles looked constantly on the verge of slipping down his nose.
He felt the bed dip as Harry stood up, and he had to suppress a cry when he heard Harry leave the room. Though the details of his nightmare were already fading from his memory, he could still vividly remember the utter contempt on Harry’s face as he had walked away from Draco in the dream. For a split second, Draco despaired that the real Harry had had enough as well and was finally leaving.
"I don't see a problem with that," Harry said smugly. Draco exhaled loudly, not bothering to hide his exasperation, but he smiled softly to himself where Harry couldn't see. "You abandoned me far too early today; texting you was the only way I could communicate with you."
"In fact, I looked it up earlier," he continued breezily, ignoring the look of panic slowly settling in on Harry's face, "and I found out it was on Netflix. How convenient."
“Not yet,” Harry said after a moment. “I’ll let you have the time you want. But you’re running out of chances, Draco.”
“That was uncalled for,” Harry said lowly. “I’ve been trying my best. You know that. It’s not like I’m asking you for something unreasonable. I just want to know why you’re so scared, Draco. Why won’t you tell me?”
The days passed with no sign of Potter, which was odd enough in that they were both studying the same subject and therefore ought to have crossed paths at some point. Draco steadily worked to convince himself that whatever attraction they had shared had been little more than a passing fantasy, the kiss just an indulgence, and Potter's parting words simply delusional as Draco had already declared. Draco's life moved on as normal, as though the afternoon with Potter had never occurred, and Draco managed to confine his obsessive over-analysis of Potter's words and actions to the half hour period he spent preparing for bed at night.
A whimper sounded then, drawing Draco’s gaze to a figure he hadn’t noticed before. Off to the side, in the shadows between the small patches of sunlight painting the floor, was a man tied to a chair, with Montague, a Death Eater near Draco’s age, standing alert beside him.
Potter looked at Draco skeptically. "So tell me the truth," he prompted. "I doubt it's really as bad as all that. Come on, you're interesting, you're witty, you're attractive. At least give me a chance."
"I'm sure we can find another ice cream shop," Harry placated, relief that Draco didn't actually regret going out with him evident in his tone. "It's not the end of the world, honestly."
Draco stayed rooted to the ground until the last students had disappeared, his arms slowly drifting down to rest at his sides. He was, to put it mildly, blindsided. There ought to have been a glaring neon sign pointing towards his Mark, drawing all eyes to the skull that announced his allegiance to all and sundry. Yet not a single student had paid him any heed.
Decision made, Draco pulled out his phone to message Harry, only to find a notification for an incoming message already blinking on the screen. Curious, he opened it. It was from Harry. “We need to talk. Can you come over?”
“No!” cried Draco. He rushed forward, but the sound of several Death Eaters drawing their own weapons stopped him. He looked toward them and was unsurprised to find three separate guns pointed directly at him.
They considered hitting up the post-Christmas sales that afternoon before the shelves were ravaged by determined shoppers, but Harry claimed he was too tired and cold from having just returned. They ordered takeout and cuddled up on the couch instead, putting on some comedy on Netflix that had them both in stitches. They relocated to the bedroom when it started to grow dark, where they engaged in a heated makeout session. By the time they fell asleep entangled in each others’ arms, Draco had managed to forget about both Yaxley’s visit and his nightmares. He felt more lighthearted than he had in days.
Draco paused, his hands balling into fists by his sides. “Are you breaking up with me, then?” he whispered, doing his best to keep his voice steady.
But Lucius only smiled in response, and once again Draco realized he had misstepped. “So this boy can still be used as leverage. How interesting,” Lucius mused. “You ought to learn to mind your tongue, Draco.” In one fluid motion, he passed his cane to his left hand, drew his pistol, and pointed the gun at Harry’s head.
Draco reached blindly for Potter, flailing aimlessly in the air until his hand collided with what felt like fabric. "Potter," he whispered with his eyes tightly shut, knowing he would lose his nerve if you opened, "you were wrong." He smirked at that. There was a certain vindictive pleasure in knowing he had managed to pull one over on Potter, who had been so adamant that he knew Draco better than even Draco did after only two encounters. "I
Draco had to admit, he had been apprehensive even as he had felt his defenses physically crumbling that this date with Harry would be immensely unsatisfactory, a justification that he needed to listen to his head instead of his heart. But conversation flowed easily between the two of them, and Draco easily lost track of time, so engrossed was he in Harry. They bickered, they teased each other, they joked, they shared memories both fond and otherwise.
Scrawled underneath in the same messy chicken scratch was a phone number. Draco quickly pulled out his own phone and dialed the number in as a new contact, attaching Potter's name to it when he was prompted. Then he shot off a quick text, asking Potter to meet him in the library where they'd first met so many weeks ago, and waited anxiously for a reply.
At length, Harry continued. "I still don't know if I even got the part," he said with a wry chuckle. The incongruous statement forced a surprised laugh from Draco as well. "But between preparations for the funeral and transferring my care to my mum's sister, I didn't have much time to dedicate to acting. And afterwards, well," he broke off. He swallowed audibly. "Well, circumstances prevented it," he said, echoing his previous statement. His shoulders moved against Draco's in what felt like a shrug.
Instead of looking revolted or scared, as Draco had hoped he might, Harry looked horrified. "That's awful," he said vehemently. "Idiots who say things like that would change their minds in an instant if they got to know you. The real you."
Draco turned away dismissively. He was silent for a minute, more to make Yaxley squirm with discomfort than to organize his thoughts. "Such threats are ineffective," he said finally. He was being truthful. What should he have felt lucky for? For the chance to reenter a life of needless violence and pointless cruelty? He stopped that train of thought, bile rising in his throat and threatening to spill over. Memories rushed unbidden to the forefront of his mind, as they had been doing ever since he had seen Yaxley, and he pushed them away to the best of his ability.
“I don’t know that I can,” Harry replied. “I don’t know that I can keep turning a blind eye when you’re being hurt like this. But more than that, I don’t know that I can stay in this relationship, if you won’t let me into your life, or past your walls.”
He was startled out of his thoughts when a firm hand gripped his shoulder and pulled him to a standstill. For a brief moment, he worried that something had gone wrong with Harry's train, forcing him to return. He panicked, though it didn't show on his expression - Harry could not be allowed to realize Draco had forgotten to get him a present.
Harry met Draco’s eyes evenly. When Draco said nothing more, Harry blew out an angry breath. “All I wanted before all this was an explanation. Some sign of trust and communication, something to show that you respected me enough to tell me the truth,” he said. “And I’m still angry at you for deciding I didn’t deserve to know my life was at risk. But…you’re not to blame for your father’s actions.” At that, Draco froze, his fingers stilling in their nervous staccato. “Besides, you saved me, in the end. And the way you handled that pistol was pretty hot.”
Draco spared a moment to think about the question. "I'm not entirely sure," he admitted finally, clenching his fists as a defense against the warning bells ringing in his head telling him not to share this vulnerability with Harry. "I thought I might stay with Blaise or Pansy, but Pansy is going to France with her parents, and I'm fairly certain Blaise is sharing his flat with his flavor-of-the-month."
"Thank you," he whispered against them, his forehead resting against Draco's, their breaths intermingling until Draco couldn't tell where his ended and Harry's began.
Sure enough, Harry’s gaze flickered away a moment later. He looked off into the distance for a few seconds. Then he seemed to come to a decision and, returning his gaze to Draco, he said, “This is it, then. We’re done, Draco. I can’t watch you self-destruct like this without even trusting me enough to tell me what’s going on—” He had been getting more heated as he spoke, and he cut himself off now with an explosive sigh. “Look, we both have secrets, but yours are hurting you, and that hurts me to watch. You might be fine with that, but I’m not going to keep hurting myself. More importantly, I won’t let you keep hurting me. I thought you might realize someday you’re not alone anymore, but I see now it was a misguided hope.”
But he needn't have worried. "Then we'll cross those bridges when we get to them," Potter said dismissively. "Anyway, if you're agreeing to this, then you should call me Harry, right?" His eyes were bright, and he wore an infectious, easy grin that had Draco instinctively grinning in response. Pot-
Draco tensed, clenching his eyes shut involuntarily in an instinctive defense against sensations he had no desire to feel again. He wouldn't wish those emotions, that guilt, on his worst enemy, much less someone he could potentially grow to care for.
For the first time, though, Draco found himself blatantly hoping that Potter would look past his posturing and call Draco on his bluff. The truth was, Potter intrigued Draco. There was something about him that drew Draco to him, leaving Draco wanting more than what little he had convinced himself he was allowed to have. Draco couldn't quite put his finger on it, even less so through the comfortable haze that was gradually settling over his mind, but whatever it was, Draco liked it.
Harry grinned. “Fantastic. I’ll get to see your reaction firsthand,” he said, genuine excitement coloring his voice. His happiness was infectious and Draco couldn’t help smiling a little in response. He didn’t resist as Harry pulled him to their eyesore of a tree, where a single poorly-wrapped package was nestled beneath the cheap plastic branches. “We should put some fake presents under the tree next year,” Harry mused even as he sank to the ground, dragging Draco down with him, and shoved the present into his hands.
Harry's mouth split open in a wide grin when he realized what Draco was saying. "Just pay me in kisses," he told Draco. "I think a thousand ought to cover five weeks' rent."
Harry visibly bristled. His hand flew to his scar, and though he immediately disguised the gesture by brushing his fringe out of his eyes, the action only served to confirm Draco's suspicions that the incident in the cafe was connected to Harry's scar. "It was nothing," Harry said finally, still avoiding Draco's gaze. He took a breath to add something, but hesitated at the last second and seemed to decide against it.
Draco glanced at Harry but looked away immediately, unable to handle the helplessness etched on Harry’s face. “It’s nothing. I’ll be okay,” he said resolutely.
“Father didn’t take that kindly, of course. He tracked me down, had one of his cronies visit me just before Christmas. Yaxley, on behalf of my father, threatened to rain hell upon me if I didn’t return to London, and to my post. It left me shaken, obviously. It was like the version of myself I’d buried in London had come back to haunt me, making it clear that I would never be free of my past.”
Draco hovered awkwardly once he no longer had something to do. He weighed the pros and cons of sitting near Harry or putting some distance between them, then wondered whether to pace to work off the nervous energy that had replaced the fire in his blood. Maybe he should get himself a glass of water as well, maybe he should sit on his bed instead, maybe—
"No, you tosser, I'm gay myself," Draco began heatedly, the confession pulled from him, but then he noticed something he hadn't seen before. "That's an odd-looking scar," he said curiously, his irritation draining away. He gestured to the lightning bolt shaped mark marring Potter's forehead. Potter gave a nearly imperceptible flinch, but Draco caught it anyway. "How did you get it?"
Within moments, Draco was walking up the stairs to the floor where he was supposed to meet Potter, buying himself some time to gather his wits by foregoing the lift. "Malfoys don't run and hide," he whispered to himself sternly, trying for the same nonchalant attitude he was known for. And really, what did it say about him that he had to talk to himself in order to prepare for a simple conversation? He didn't particularly want to know. "Malfoys take control of the situation and turn it to their advantage." The words soured his mouth, calling forth images of his father and his associates.
Harry was silent, and Draco claimed his victory with a vicious sneer. “I’m done here. I warned you from the start. You’re the one who chose not to listen.” He spun around once more and stalked away. Harry didn’t call after him again.
Finally, Draco lost his patience. "Are you going to say anything?" he demanded. "What happened back there? What she said wasn't right, but it wasn't something that should have caused the reaction it did. Tell me what's going on, Harry."
"But you won't share any of them, will you," Potter said, his inflection indicating the statement wasn't a question. Draco looked away to avoid admitting Potter was right. "So it doesn't matter, then. It's just a date, Draco. I'm not asking you to divulge your deepest secrets from the start. There's a chance we won't even work as a couple. But I like you. I'm drawn to you, and I don't want to miss this opportunity because you're scared."
Draco shook his head. "No one to shop for," he said plainly. "Besides you, anyway, and I'm hardly going to purchase your Christmas present with you right here."
"I'm only a phone call away, Harry," Weasley said loudly. With a quick glance thrown towards Draco, and a valiant attempt to lower his voice that fell just shy of success, Weasley continued, "You know you can stay with us, yeah? Mum wouldn't mind one bit."
Harry chewed nervously on his lip. “It seemed like there was more behind it,” he said. “You were really thrashing around.”
When Yaxley spoke next, his voice was cold enough to send shivers racing down Draco's spine. "You have a duty to the Death Eaters," he said. "You took the Mark. Do not forget the commitment you made."
The metal doors opened onto a dark, empty space illuminated periodically by shafts of sunlight filtering through small windows near the ceiling. Draco paused just past the threshold to let his eyes adjust. He stood his ground as Yaxley and Dolohov pushed roughly past, their shoulders slamming into his and leaving his muscles tingling with discomfort.
Harry finally raised his head and met Draco's gaze when Draco insulted him, remorse shining in his eyes. His hands stilled; silence stretched between the two, fraught with the words that remained unspoken. "It's not that I don't trust you," Harry started. He trailed off, frustrated. "I want to tell you," he tried again, "but it's not something I feel comfortable talking about right now. Surely you understand?" He dropped the water bottle onto the bedcovers beside him and gestured to Draco's left arm. Draco gripped at his sleeve reflexively and tugged it down. His face burned as he realized he had only played into Harry's intent. "You have your own secrets," Harry continued. "Let me have mine."
It took Draco a moment to reply, preoccupied as he was with his speeding pulse and debilitating fear. He closed his eyes rather than look at Harry, afraid that he would see the disgusted Harry from his dreams instead of his caring boyfriend. “Just a nightmare,” he said finally, his voice hoarse. He cleared his throat, the sound cutting harshly through the quiet night.
But he had built his walls and caged away such vulnerabilities for a reason, and regardless of how much he wanted it, Draco wasn't going to let Potter break them down.
The trek to his dorm was a blur. By the time Draco stumbled up to his door, his anger had been supplanted by exhaustion, and he fumbled his key three times before managing to slot it into the lock. Tears of frustration welled in his eyes; he let them fall as he entered, kicking the door shut behind him and sinking to the floor in one motion.
The contentment lasted right up until the moment he woke up gasping for breath, phantom blood painting his hands and Harry’s concerned voice breaching his racing mind.
He started driving again. Silence swelled between them, interrupted only by the GPS’ periodic guidance—an unwanted passenger, clambering into Draco’s lap and demanding to be addressed.
He realized the moment Harry caught sight of the tattoo, as a sharp intake of breath echoed through the room. Tentatively, Harry reached out with two fingers as though to trace the ink. His fingers hovered uncertainly above the decorated skin until Draco pushed his arm up to meet them. They began following the patterns that curved around Draco's arm, though Harry's movements were still slow and hesitant. Draco shivered at the sensation, goosebumps rising on the affected flesh, and glanced down to watch Harry caress his arm.
Harry looked back at Draco. "Too late for that," he said sheepishly, gesturing discreetly towards the two girls who were now making their way to Harry and Draco. The girls reached their table a moment later, leaving Draco unable to reply. He opted to glare halfheartedly at Harry instead, tugging self-consciously at his left sleeve to ensure his tattoo was hidden.
"We've got fans," Draco said quietly to Harry, who immediately whipped around to find who Draco was talking about. Draco resisted the urge to release an exasperated groan and possibly hide his face in his hands; he settled instead for closing his eyes briefly and sighing. "No, don't do that, you'll get their attention," he admonished.
As the last of the gift wrap fell away, Draco found himself holding an unbelievably soft, emerald green scarf in his hands. The material was obviously high-end, and the color was one that brought out Draco’s eyes. A subtle shimmer was woven into the scarf, lending it a certain allure that Draco couldn’t quite explain.
Draco let himself get lost in the pleasure. A euphoric haze settled over his mind, and his thoughts grew so scattered as to be incoherent. His world boiled down to the sight and feeling of Harry's mouth traveling across his body.
Draco had just rested his hand on the door handle when one of the girls blurted out, her voice laced with disgust, "Wait, he's a faggot?"
“Draco, open your eyes,” Harry coaxed. Draco realized with a start that his eyes had been clenched tightly shut ever since he’d woken up. He pried them apart with some effort, blinking rapidly to bring the dark interior of the room into focus. Once his vision stopped swimming, he saw that Harry was holding a glass of water towards him. He took it gratefully.
So why was he letting the Mark—and, by proxy, his past—dictate the way he lived? Why had he let himself be ruled by fear?
True to his word, Draco took Harry to see a film two days later. They caught an early afternoon showing of some popular new superhero movie, and what the date lacked in romantic cliches, it made up for with cheap tickets and the whispered, sarcastic commentary Harry and Draco kept running through the film, much to the irritation of their surrounding moviegoers.
Draco wondered if that scar had something to do with how Harry was acting now. Had the girl in the cafe said something reminiscent of the circumstances that had led to the scar? What was the connection?
"You could have built a fairly successful career using that as a starting point," Draco said to Harry. "It was phenomenal."
Harry was silent for a long moment. “You’re an ass,” he said finally. “It’s not your place to decide what I get to know or what’s best for me. And I ended up involved anyway, so a fat lot of good your self-sacrificial bullshit did me.”
Draco’s head spun with the possibilities. He felt strung out, ricocheting wildly between rocks and hard places, and the resulting strain etched itself into the growing shadows beneath his eyes and the ever-present frown upon his lips. He despised the ease with which Lucius and the Death Eaters could maintain such a grip on him after all these months. He had left London precisely to cut these ties, and to avoid a confrontation with Lucius until he was able to hold his own.
"Thank you for telling me," he murmured. He extricated his left arm from Harry's grasp and gently moved him to the side. He slipped out of bed to turn off the lights and move the laptop off the bed, before crawling back beneath the covers, which Harry had turned down in Draco's absence. They sought each others' arms in the darkness, and fell asleep entangled in each other.
Lucius sneered. “Amends? How can you make amends for who you are? Ruling is in your blood, Draco. It is your birthright. Do you truly intend to leave your legacy behind? You cannot escape your calling. You cannot run from the bloodlust that runs through your veins.”
