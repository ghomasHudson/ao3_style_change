“It’s not weird. Honestly, it’s really obvious, Ron. Does it matter if I’ve been told anything? Harry? What do you think?”
“History of Magic,” she started carefully, ignoring Ron’s groan. “Charms, Herbology, Transfiguration. We have a double Potions class with Snape at the end of the day.”
Ginny let out a laugh of astonishment at the vivid sky and Draco whipped around at once. This was the last person Harry wanted to see, but
In short, they had both — more or less — said they both smelt each other from the potion’s fumes. Everyone knew that the scent of love potions was different for every individual, but designed to be the most appealing smell to them.
a love potion. Then again, that must still be difficult for you.” Harry was trying his best to keep quiet until Draco continued.
A collective snicker went around aimed at Seamus, who grinned guilty.
“Honestly Ron,” Hermione sighed exasperatedly, rolling her eyes. She looked at Harry with a carefulness that looked almost prepared. “Isn’t it obvious? She
“We can go back, if you—”
“I guess so? ...I dunno,” replied Harry lamely. It felt all weird to him. He had only been with Cho once, but he hadn’t felt that way toward any other girls since. Something hazy in the back of his mind protested, but he couldn’t figure why.
“Wait!” Ginny pleaded. “Don’t punish Harry, I brought him here.” She turned to him. “I’m so sorry Harry, this is—”
” Draco drawled smugly, clearly basking in Harry’s flustered state. “Worried you’re going to stuff up in front of a Slytherin?” he smiled contemptuously. “It’s
“Watch where you’re going, Potter,” Draco sneered unpleasantly, shoving him lightly. Harry tensed up, his cheeks flaring. He could smell Draco’s sharp, minty intoxicant lingering in the air gingerly as he paused for a response, but Harry moved to his desk in silence. It wasn’t the tiredness, but the recurring thought of Draco throughout the day that had caused him to weird out around him.
He raised his voice so that it reverberated around the classroom. “You are all dismissed.”
Draco looked shaken and rather lost as he turned to the professor.
Harry was at his limit. He burst at Draco’s conceited, stupid, bastardly smirk.
It was a thorn in Harry’s pride, a reference Malfoy had made to last week. It had only been an accident… It wasn’t his fault he had mixed up anticlockwise turns with clockwise turns.
Harry whipped around. She looked nervous, twirling her red hair distractedly around her finger and her gaze fixed at the ground — odd for Ginny, who always seemed to keep fierce eye contact when she talked to Harry.
“I see you have finished your potion, Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Potter.” Snape appeared beside them, peering into the cauldron — Harry had let out a sigh of release as he was cut off from Draco’s nonplussed expression.
After a sound check for any disturbances, Harry flung the cloak off as they reached the stairs.
“Oh, hello Harry,” Hermione acknowledged as she looked up — albeit a little sulkily. She quickly noticed his attire and gasped.
He’d distracted himself from that peculiar thought of Malfoy in classes with a strange focus he didn’t realise he had. He remembered the astonishment on Hermione’s face beside him when he managed to transfigure his pumpkin into a rabbit before she could.
“I don’t think anyone’s here, come on.”
“Oh, don’t worry, I make sure to lower my expectations when it comes to
blow up the dungeon this time.”
He listened in dread as the Potions professor began to list the pairings, watching students from both parties scowl or glare as they made their way toward each other. Harry avoided Draco until Snape had listed every pair except… surprise, him and Malfoy. Brilliant.
“They’re not Crabbe and Goyle, Malfoy,” Harry retorted, “I don’t require Hermione and Ron to be in my company every hour of the day. My
Draco’s lip curled distastefully, and Harry forced down the rising anger— he couldn’t bring himself to name what it probably had always been. Ginny threw a hand to her mouth, the blood draining from her face.
“Where’s Granger and
“Oh! I was just wondering… could I talk to you a bit later? I-In private, I mean,” asked Ginny, eyeing Ron and Hermione fighting over a game of wizard’s chess beside the fireplace. She coughed, straightening and finally meeting his gaze but with unfocused, watery brown eyes. Harry was taken aback.
felt entitled enough to strut about the castle whenever he felt like it.”
The trio completed their breakfast in silence.
“Bloody hell,” Ron sighed, but he shared a grin with Harry. “Sore loser, that one is.” He scrambled up. “Better get changed before she hexes my nose off or something,” he joked. “See you at breakfast, Harry!”
Funnily enough, it hadn’t been the first time this had happened either. Harry could pinpoint days, moments, where he had been put in a strange daze by the Slytherin over the tiniest things — their petty arguments, the smirk on Draco’s face every time he caught Harry getting scolded, the glares they passed each other in class; Draco sneering, arms crossed, legs folded.
Anger sparked down his spine. He watched raptly as Draco’s nostrils flared and the two Slytherins shared a look. Harry couldn’t place what it meant and it enraged him. If he were next to Malfoy, he’d be ripping off his badge and—
At the thought, an image of Draco appeared in his head, sneering down on him as he always did. “Bewitch a Weasley into becoming your girlfriend, have you, Potter?” fake Malfoy taunted. “The nerve. Saint Potter, thinking that—” Harry shook the voice from his head before it could continue. What an odd thought.
What was wrong with him? His stomach fluttered as an image of the Slytherin appeared, but this time with that soft, loose expression of concentration he had back in the Potions class before… the love potion.
still hasn’t learnt from their first-year ingredient preparation.” He continued before Harry could speak, “I wonder what this potion smells like to you. Probably that... mudblood, Granger.”
“I’ll take note that this potion could have been prepared better. However, it is adequate at your standard,” he pivoted toward Draco. “Mr. Malfoy.”
“Not as incompetent as you thought then, Malfoy,” Harry growled. Draco met his gaze with aloof amusement, making Harry ball his hands into fists.
They made their way to the astronomy tower in silence, intent on getting there without detection, though it was a little awkward. This whole situation was weird now that Harry had context, and for two very outspoken Gryffindors the silence was... uncomfortable, to say the least. As they shuffled closer to the tower, Ginny pressing in on him to keep hidden, Harry let his thoughts wander. He grimaced as his mind went straight to Malfoy.
“Checkmate!” Ron announced proudly, grinning as Hermione’s King glared at his rook and turned around to squabble at her. Hermione’s eyes flickered determinedly across the board, checking for any possible moves.
“Found your voice, have you?” remarked Draco, folding his arms. He had been taunting Harry throughout the day — as he always did — but Harry had been determined to ignore him; until now. Harry found himself smirking at Draco.
“I’m a prefect. Do you know what that is?” He cocked his head slightly and spotted Ginny. His eyes hardened.
Harry bit back a groan of annoyance — he could recognise that snarky, posh voice from anywhere. He ignored it, unable to hold back rolling his eyes.
Harry tried to stumble into the parting crowd but Snape wasn’t finished. “Potter. I noticed you were the one who prepared your ingredients. Perhaps
Harry tried to bite back a retort, but to no avail, he had to retaliate. “I’m actually not worried at all,” he replied, returning the smile blandly, “just concerned that if you’re so obsessed with me, you’d actually let a
He looked swiftly back at Draco only to see his features settled and once again cool, if not for the wild glint in his eye. He watched the Slytherin smooth down his robe as if he had been unruffled the entire time. A silence lapsed over them again, but Harry was too bewildered to care.
Two, he hadn’t thought once about Ginny or her request the entire school day.
“Erm.. are you going to say something?” Harry continued. He was beginning to worry. Was something wrong?
“Fine,” Harry coughed, straightening. He joined them and walked off toward the Gryffindor towers. There was a collective, silent groan as Malfoy and Pansy whisked past them, snickering.
“Yeah, didn’t realise you cared that much.” He was surprised to see Draco return the grin in a much more startling, genuine way, but any trace of it vanished in a second as Snape loomed over the two.
He hadn’t looked up until he brushed shoulders with someone.
Suddenly there was a shriek as Ginny had been seized and shoved away from Harry. It was Draco, who had pushed her from Harry and taken her place, his face dangerously close with Harry’s. Draco’s silver eyes flickered up to meet his, a question burning in his eyes.
“It’s just the Potions homework I woke up early to finish,” Harry attempted, realising that was probably it. “Just tired.”
are human, and therefore entitled to freedom. I don’t treat them like
“Brilliant,” Harry replied, but it came out flat. He watched in surprise at Ron’s grin fall too.
Before registering what was suddenly happening, it was him,
, that had leaned in and kissed Draco. His eyes widened in horror at the impulse, his senses going overdrive, craving the touch. He felt Draco’s cool hand rest around his cheek, eyes fluttering shut and for once, relaxing. It was everything to Harry. He smiled and let himself get lost in the kiss, feeling alive.
Draco’s eyes widened, sending a glare towards Harry. Any previous warmth was obviously now nonexistent. “Sorry, sir,” Draco apologised. “I’ll make sure Potter learns how to
“Harry! There you are! ...Are you ok?”
“Hi, Ginny.” Harry felt himself grin. It was always good to talk to his best friend’s sister. Ginny continued to stare at the ground, looking a little flushed. Something seemed off, this shy, quiet persona of Ginny’s a stark comparison to her lively, assertive nature.
“You alright, Harry? You look… pale,” said Hermione.
“Oh! Ron, we have breakfast now! We need to get changed right away.” Standing up, she complained as she walked off, “Why did you convince me into playing this ridiculous game?”
“You sure, mate? You’ve been a bit off at breakfast today.”
Ginny reached upward to tent the cloak so that there was a bit more room, biting her lip nervously.
It was Ginny.
“Harry…” It was Ginny. “I wanted to tell you, I...”
do all the work.” He felt that hot satisfaction rise in his gut as Draco faltered at his words.
“Hey Harry! We’re here now- Oh.”
“Harry, we should go.” Ginny looked guilty, and Harry wanted to hex both the Slytherins into the ground.
” he leered. He waved his hands exasperatedly. “Besides, how can
It was a fairly normal morning in the Gryffindor common room for Harry until someone had called for him.
He joined Ron and Hermione by the embers of the fire, still in their nightgowns — Harry had already gotten dressed in preparation for breakfast and today’s classes, having gotten up early to complete his Potions assignment.
Harry’s eyes widened. Ginny Weasley was truly, fiercely courageous. He stiffened as she leaned closer.
Draco shifted and his smug features darkened considerably. “That’s not how it works,
The nagging, angered sensation in his gut came to life and seized his sides as though he was being bound with tight ribbon. Harry suddenly felt alarmed at the flare of adrenaline, even though it was a common feeling he had around Malfoy, but it had suddenly become unfamiliar. What he recognised as anger had drastically morphed into a newfound emotion, something much stronger and dangerous, but still something he hadn’t felt since…
Harry thought.
Harry reached for his assignment, ducking to avoid Snape’s intense glare as his work was snatched from him.
“Brought your girlfriend with you, have you?” Draco’s face remained cool but the tone was accusatory. Harry could feel the Slytherin seething. “I have the power to give you both detention—”
“Good,” replied Snape monotonously, eyeing Harry distrustfully before stalking off.
“Erm, yeah,” Harry muttered, busying himself with his pancakes and bacon. What was wrong with him today? He tried to change the subject as unobviously as possible. “What have we got on today, Hermione?”
Ginny smiled for the first time in the conversation, brightening considerably. “That would be good! Thanks Harry.” And she was gone before Harry could ask if she was alright.
“Not before you say what you were going to say, Ginny. That’s not fair to you!”
Harry braced himself to lunge forward and tackle him if it weren’t for Draco’s sudden, panicked look. He held back, suddenly very confused. Had Snape come up to them? He glanced around, not spotting Snape but catching Hermiome’s intense, startled gaze at him from the desk beside him.
“I love y—”
“Ginny? What is it?”
Shame burning red in his face, Harry lifted his head in time to see Draco’s cold snigger, a mirthless smirk etched on his face. Suddenly, they had locked eyes, silver and green. Harry moved his head away quickly, feeling embarrassed— annoyed. He couldn’t stand Draco mocking him any longer. He fought the urge to take out his wand and hex him good, or more like it, have a proper fight with him, wands discarded. He wanted to rip off Malfoy’s perfect prefect badge and watch his lip curl.
“To reinforce my earlier statement, I will be pairing up one Slytherin and one Gryffindor each for today’s tasks—” Snape continued, and Harry’s heart dropped. “—to create the love potion that we studied in our previous session.” There were always tens of other Slytherins to be paired with, but Snape had always made sure Harry was to be with Malfoy.
There was a beat where Draco would have snickered, but it was filled in by Pansy Parkinson— Hermione’s partner —as she walked up to them.
, as if we couldn’t get enough of Malfoy already,” complained Ron, which ironically voiced Harry’s thoughts exactly.
you.”
Harry nearly tripped as he turned a corridor. Attracted? To
“Of course, whatever you need,” he replied, “How about you meet me at the Astronomy tower after curfew? We can sneak past Filch with the cloak.”
“I’ll admit you did—” Draco paused, considering. “—
Doubt surged into his thoughts. Would he give her a chance? Harry pushed down the rising doubt, but — with a certain Slytherin in mind — found with dread that he wished it wasn’t the case.
“That’s so crazy,” he heard Ron exclaim to Hermione. “Totally weird. She’s my sister! Did you know?”
should take care to master more simple tasks before he goes off saving the world?”
Harry, Hermione and Ron filed into the Potions dungeon, flanked by their fellow Gryffindors. It had been a long, tiring day for Harry; he wasn’t sure how much more he could take.
“I will begin by reminding the Gryffindor students that potion instructions must be read correctly, and followed carefully,” droned Snape as he began the class. Harry yawned, resting his head on the desk as Snape proceeded to list all the rules, one by one.
figure out their potion’s smell when you’re clearly
. Nothing here stinks as much as you. Had a long day, have you?”
“I’m on duty, Potter.”
Harry whipped his head around to face Ron as he sat down, feeling his upturned cheeks slacken quickly. He felt strangely guilty, but he couldn’t grasp why. There was an odd look in Hermione’s eyes as she sat down, watching him.
It was at this point Harry suddenly registered a more prominent fragrance in the room — something much like cedar and burnt apple, smoky pine with a tang of peppermint. With sharp detection Harry realised it was Draco — not so much his wizard cologne (or whatever it was), but the musk of his body. Occasionally, Harry could smell it in undertones as he passed the Slytherin day to day.
Harry flung the cloak over himself and Ginny, the flowy fabric cut short at their ankles. It had been long since Harry was a first-year, so now the cloak — which once draped loosely over Harry’s shoulders, trailing along the floor — barely managed to conceal them both.
“No, it’s fine,” Harry insisted, smiling. He did mean it. He’d do anything for a good friend. Whether or not Ginny did like him, he wasn’t going to bail on her. He forced himself to calm down and kept moving, a bit quicker this time. They were nearly there.
Decided to play hero without them, Potter?” Malfoy drawled, his minions Crabbe and Goyle chortling stupidly in echo. Harry was already tired enough without Malfoy having to poke at him first thing during the day, but he felt familiar anger ball up in the pit of his stomach. He turned around, narrowing his eyes at Malfoy’s stupid, smug face. He wanted to punch it.
Harry recalled the alarm on Draco’s face when Harry had realised what he’d said earlier, which he now noticed, mirrored the panicked look Draco had when he’d said the same thing.
.” He peered into the cauldron. “I can still see some of your poorly chopped rose thorns in there, clearly
“Ready?”
It was right.
girlfriend. What fun.”
He smirked at Harry’s silence.
“And I wonder what it smells like to you, Malfoy,” he practically spat at him, “Professor Snape? How about your father— oh, I’m sure he’d be thrilled to hear about this!”
“Why aren’t you at your station?” His gaze flickered to Malfoy. “Draco. Don’t make me regret partnering you with Mr. Potter.”
” spat a voice behind him.
“...I do not tolerate students blowing up their concoctions and wasting the school’s potion supplies.” There was a delicate pause. “Am I clear, Mr. Finnigan?”
“Would you consider giving her a chance?” Hermione asked.
Harry drummed his fingers on his goblet of pumpkin juice, thinking about what Ginny had asked earlier. As hard as he tried, he couldn’t think of anything she’d possibly need to ask him in private like that. He bit back a yawn, tired from his early wake. He stole a glance at Ginny, chatting loudly with her friends. What had caused her to squirm around him?
But there was no denying the smell. Even Malfoy echoed his reaction, nostrils flaring.
“What’s the matter,
“Oh, c’mon Hermione,” Ron groaned, elbowing Harry as he sat down beside him — Hermione was still scanning, ignoring the protests of her pieces as she insisted they sit still. She gave up with a huff as they eventually ignored her and moved off the board.
“Blimey, was that Malfoy, Harry?” continued Ron as he reached for the pumpkin juice, seemingly unaware of Harry’s strange behaviour. “Still being an uptight prick to you, isn’t he? Doesn’t know how to leave you alone. Bloody hell.”
Scorpius started to call Harry out on that statement, but he got distracted when he heard his name. He glanced back to find his nanny waving at him by the gate. He had half a mind to ignore her and continue with this
Harry was trying to stop his big mouth from running off on him, but he failed. "You don't have anywhere else to go." He winced as soon as he said that.
"Harry's on here loads of times," Teddy explained. "In fact, I've been on here a few times myself. Witch Weekly loves Harry. Witches love Harry. You're famous now, Scorpius! Isn't that great?"
"I can hardly see you," Harry complained. He waved his hand in front of his myopic eyes. "You're a blur and not worth the money."
Harry paced in front of the roaring fireplace.
"Heat of the moment, right?"
"Patricia told you Harry Potter is your family?" Draco repeated.
When the thick curtains opened to reveal the first event in the program, twenty young children dressed to their nines stood on small risers with their eyes trained on Gabrielle and Harry who were kneeling in front of the stage. A few secretive flashes went off in the auditorium despite prohibition of photography, but that was easily overlooked. Gabrielle counted them in and started the music with a flick of her wand.
"I used to worry about you," Draco murmured. "I used to wonder what you would do if something happened to me. I used to get so worked up, thinking you would be all alone."
"Huh? What do you mean... Oh..."
"Shut up, Potter."
Harry grinned in astonishment. "Why? What's he done with it?"
By the time the third song started, Scorpius was singing properly. His voice couldn't be heard above all the other children's, but he was singing. Sometimes he forgot the words but quickly caught up by watching Gabrielle's cues. He somehow managed to get through the whole routine and he didn't even notice that they had finished until the parents started clapping.
After all these years of being tackled by children, Teddy knew to brace himself when Scorpius flew at him. "Merry almost Christmas!" he cheered just as enthusiastically as Scorpius. He caught the little boy mid-flight and spun around. "Did you get me a present?"
Theo simply watched with narrowed eyes as his friend coughed and spluttered, making quite a spectacle for the other patrons in the crowded coffee shop to snicker at. He slid a napkin across the table. Draco snatched it up and proceeded to dab at watering eyes and nose. Theo had to wait a few moments for Draco to stop embarrassing them both. Once Draco had composed himself, Theo asked again. "Christmas? With Harry Potter?"
Theo sputtered. "So what? So what?! Draco, have you gone mental?"
Harry was taken aback that Draco brought it up. "This morning?" he echoed.
"He fell asleep." Scorpius pulled a sad frown. "He was supposed to have ice-cream, Nanna."
The next day, Draco left for work at eight, which meant Scorpius and Harry could be up to any number of mischievous deeds all day long.
The brooms clattered together as it fell onto the grass when Draco grabbed Harry and pulled him to the side, behind a budding topiary, into a frustrated lip lock. Enveloped in soft leaves, they sank together in an exasperated embrace. Everything about Harry was infuriating to Draco - his manipulative words, his constant need to blurt out his thoughts, how good it felt to be close to him. Here they were hidden from the world. With eyes shut, they were hidden from each other too. How long was a moment? They hoped it would last for much longer, despite how ridiculous that moment was turning out to be.
The cellar door flung open up above, striking the stone wall with a terrific crash. "What's taking you two so long?" Theo called down.
"Memories?"
Harry looked at him, piquing a brow. "There's some in the kitchen," he added with a vague gesture towards the hallway.
"Eve. Christmas Eve."
"You do?"
Draco did count on them. He had no doubt that Harry and Teddy would deliver on their promise to throw a great seventh birthday party for Scorpius.
"He's never. He has never been sick."
Draco grabbed Harry by the scarf and pulled him down for a snotty kiss.
"I already told you I am," Harry said quietly while giving the boy a loaded look that told him to keep quiet. "I've been much worse, Molly," he added for her sake. "You know better than anyone. This is nothing at all. I don't even have to stay overnight. There's nothing to worry about."
Harry urged Scorpius on encouragingly whenever their eyes met. The boy always felt his shaky voice calming down when Harry nodded at him like that. He was also glad for his friends standing on either side of him because they remembered all the words and helped him remember when he forgot. The four-minute performance felt like four hours to him, but he sang just like he had practiced, just like Harry had told him to. His hands were cold and his voice was hoarse as they neared the end, but he pressed on with his classmates without faltering. As long as he kept his eyes on his teachers, he wouldn't have to worry at all.
"Sweet dreams."
tell you."
Harry was startled to hear a voice so familiar and buried so deep in his memories. Memories of the sounds of ladles striking cauldrons in potions class, freezing wind on the Quidditch pitch, the metallic stench of blood in a dirty bathroom, searing heat of magical fire... It all came flooding back when he heard the voice of Draco Malfoy.
"Really. Not everyone is great on stage the first time. You've never had to sing in front of so many people before, have you?"
He huffed indignantly. Trust him to make a fool of himself in front of Malfoy. "Ha ha, laugh it up," he muttered under his breath.
Astoria turned around deliberately to raise a derisive brow at Draco.
"My precious boy's grown into a perfect Malfoy," Theo whooped. He tilted Scorpius' chin up and said, "Did you know your father also said the same thing to me when we were at Hogwarts? Not in your politically correct terms, of course. But you get the gist of it. You're going a long way, you little devil."
"It's stupid," Scorpius grumbled as he took a candy cane from Gabrielle.
Draco swallowed to wet his dry throat. "What?"
Draco had to bite his tongue to keep from snapping at Harry. "Please let me speak-"
"I know. I didn't really... That is, Teddy and I didn't really give them a chance to back out." Not for the lack of trying. Draco had tried to talk his son out of it. He had snapped at Harry for interfering. He had thrown fits. When reason and arguments fell on deaf ears, Draco had had no choice but to go with the flow.
the smartest," Scorpius insisted. "If you keep being nice to me, then... then... That's why I-" He broke off as fresh tears rolled down his chubby cheeks.
"I wasn't serious," Ron blurted out. He held his hands up in surrender. "Do you really think I'd be coherent if he broke his neck?"
"Does your dad sing with you?"
"Don't say that. I've got Mum and Nanna. And I've got Teddy and Theo."
"I know," Scorpius sniffed. He knew he was being unreasonable. But he wanted to be perfect.
"Did you feel bad?" Draco asked.
"It's six, Potter. Why are you sleeping?"
Scorpius shook his head. He didn't bother to look up from his picture book he had chosen for reading hour.
Harry slumped as all the nervous energy in him finally fled, leaving him drained. That went better than he had envisioned, because for the past week he had imagined his next meeting with Malfoy ending with him flat on his arse with a bloody nose. This interaction had been... without fanfare, to say the least. A weight had finally been lifted off his shoulders.
Draco raised a derisive brow and repeated, "Yes," very deliberately, ending that discussion.
"Okay?"
"She's on holidays, remember?"
His expression was both honest and resigned, making Harry's heart sink. "I see." He glanced away while trying to think of a sensitive way to approach this topic. "Will I get in trouble for being nice to you?"
The summer flew by splendidly for Scorpius. He had played with Teddy and Harry, read with Draco, and pestered Patricia. He spent a week traveling with his mother in Europe where he was lounging on beaches in Greece, eating all the gelato he wanted in Italy, and walking all over France. It was the most brilliant summer. His life had never seemed fuller - full of fun, full of sunshine, full of laughs, and full of family. He was in Versailles with Draco and Astoria, in a lavish French hotel, eating delicious French food, wearing fancy French clothes. He felt so grown up. And when they got back to their large suite, he couldn't believe his little eyes when he saw a brand new Firebolt sitting on the table.
The moment that Harry walked into Ron and Hermione’s flat, he was attacked with a wild bush of hair.
No. “Yes, it was. Just trying something new.”
Jack nodded briefly, a sad smile, a look of pity on his face. Apparently, Harry's case wasn’t the first that he’d seen. A few moments later, Jack returned with a rock glass of amber liquid, Harry’s saving grace. Harry paid and grabbed the glass like it was his lifeline. Like reading his face, Jack said sternly,
Harry then decided that they were going to be a while. He would be the productive one and finish packing while they enjoyed Harry’s embarrassment and misery.
“Wait, hold on! Malfoy? The Malfoy, was at the gay bar that you were at?”
“Ginny, you didn’t.” They were the first words that Harry had spoken directly to Ginny since breaking up.
“Yes,” Harry cleared his throat, “I did.”
Harry could feel large tears forming in his eyes so he closed his eyelids tightly, trying to make the heartbreak go away. Ginny was probably disgusted, he thought. Why would someone keep that big of a secret from their partner. Harry just wanted to curl up into a ball and sob.
Harry released a breath he didn’t know he was holding. He returned to his original comfy position on the sofa and nearly closed his eyes until Ron came back into the living room.
“Need to freshen up.” He said quietly, making his way to the bathroom, pretending he didn’t hear what Ron had just said.
“Draco, let’s go” a voice from behind them made them both turn simultaneously. The shorter man who Malfoy was dancing with previously was staring at them, looking very expectant.
He tried to keep his mind blank as the door swung open and Ginny stood on the other side. She smiled warmly at everyone, including Harry. So maybe she had forgiven him, he didn’t know, but at least he wasn’t welcomed.
“Actually, Seamus. I have something to talk to you about.” Harry said confidently.
Each gathering the food that they wanted, Harry, Ron and Hermione sat in comfortable silence on the sofa, listening to the noises outside of the open window. The traffic could be heard but too far away for it to annoy the occupants in the flat. Birds chirped their morning song and the rustling of trees could be heard as well.
“And what happened?” Hermione came to sit next to him, Ron still standing.
Harry made it to the bottom of the stairs feeling a little bit tighter in his trousers and his arms aching from all the boxes. He probably should have taken the lift. He walked outside to Ron and Hermione’s car (Hermione had bought one when she finished training at St. Mungos, Ron was quite wary at first). He put the boxes into the open boot of the car and stood up, stretching his back and arms.
Harry sat at the bar on an empty bar stool, looking around at the dance floor, the scenery, feeling quite put out. His vibe must be very noticeable as the barman, after serving a couple, came up behind him.

“Department of Magical Law Enforcement please.” Harry asked the taller trainee who was standing nearest the buttons. The lift closed its doors and went down and there was silence. Harry could tell there were two pairs of eyes staring into the back of his head but he didn’t really want to get into an awkward conversation with others.
Harry, Ron and Hermione were all waiting outside Harry’s old apartment door, waiting for Ginny to open it. They would have floo’d but at the moment in Harry’s eyes, flooing felt a bit impersonal, like he was suddenly invading Ginny’s space. Obviously, the apartment belonged to the both of them but Harry left abruptly, making it clear that he didn’t want to be in that apartment anymore. That wasn’t what Harry was thinking at the time though.
“Don’t think I wouldn’t notice you staring at me.” Malfoy cheerfully said as he leaned in the wall next to Harry.
“Why would we be?” Ron’s voice could be heard from the kitchen.
When he was rather nervous, Harry would usually play with his hair, a tick that had come up since Auror training. It was a little hard to ruffle his hair as his now sandy brown hair was much shorter. Harry had asked Hermione to get a bit of hair from one of her co-workers at St. Mungos. With a little persuasion, mainly from Ron telling her that he will only do this once to get over the whole Malfoy fiasco, she managed to get some hair from one of her fellow medi wizards.
And he did.
Lots of love
“I’ll just get clothes from the bedroom.” Harry mumbled, gesturing for Ron to join him as he made his way to the bedroom, leaving the girls in the living area.
Harry was the first to break the silence after putting down his plate next to his half-drunk orange juice.
“Draco? Unusual name.” Harry joked. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Jack walking towards them with his much needed whiskey.
Harry hadn’t really thought this through. In the midst of his small panic, he just went with his polyjuice donor’s name.
“Ginny,” Harry spoke, not wanting to look at Ginny’s face otherwise he wouldn’t be able to finish.
Harry looked out onto the crowd of dancers. He was surprised with the idea that they could just be themselves, not having to worry about how others looked at them; in disgust, fear, whatever other emotions that Harry was sure to encounter when he met others. He did feel a little underdressed to be in a place like this. His casual wear of a red t-shirt, blue denims and a black jacket was nothing compared to the bright colours or tight clothing that the other men seemed to wear. Gulping down his whiskey again, he ordered another from Jack and sipped lightly. While drinking, one man’s clothing, well mainly his hair caught Harry’s attention. The man’s back was turned towards Harry. His hair seemed to glow in the fluorescent lights of the bar. It was like a beacon. He was wearing tight, black, leather trousers and accompanying that was a simple yet elegant white button up with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows. Harry was trying to imagine what his mysterious man looked like. But, when the man’s left arm turned to show the underside, Harry caught the sight of a hideous mark. To any onlooker, the man just looked like he had a badass tattoo but Harry knew what it really was. A death eater mark.
Gabrielle waved her wand to start the soft piano music. Then she counted them in.
"Harry gave me this!" Scorpius was holding a shiny Knut. "For you! Money!"
"Oh. That's definitely not the worst," Draco scoffed. "I could have been so much worse, Potter."
"I can barely afford it," Draco grumbled.
"You can't expect me to spend the night here." Harry hated hospital stays. "I hardly get any sleep in this place, nurses buzzing in and out."
"Hmm. His commendation would mean a world of difference to Scorpius."
"For God's sake-"
"Whaaaat?" he whined. "I don't have a problem, Dad."
"I'm game if you are," Harry said.
"Then lie."
Draco shook his head. "I already told you not to think about that anymore."
"He's not my teacher this year," Scorpius explained. "He's been teaching me to fly. Oh, you should see the tricks I can do, Theo. You'll hardly believe it."
"I'm not going anywhere," Draco insisted. "I'm here. See? I'm right here." His heart sank when he felt sweat soaking through Scorpius' pajamas. It was a fever. He flicked his wand to turn on the lights. "Everything is fine. Open your eyes."
Now he was doing something for himself, and surrounding it with many lies, pretending the lies were meant to protect Scorpius, when in actuality it was to protect himself.
"Just wondering." Harry set the cup full of pencil crayons on the table. "It's strange seeing you like this - a part-time homemaker."
"Huh?"
"I'm taking him home," Draco said. Scorpius had his arms around his father's neck and his face was hidden. "I need his knapsack and things."
He groaned again and thumped his head against the mattress a few times.
"With chocolate syrup and sprinkles and strawberries and-"
"Have you seen it?"
"I'll tell him."
That night, he tossed and turned in bed, growing more and more furious as the hours ticked by. He had always thought Potter was strange, but he had been stranger than usual, more confrontational than usual, and more callous than usual these past few weeks. About absolutely nothing at all. Draco couldn't even figure out why they were arguing this time around. The fact that he refused to admit he had a good day? Maybe that he didn't like Christmas? Or that he wasn't acting like all of Potter's friends, doting and fawning? What was it? Friends of convenience, that's what Potter had called them. Yes, that was exactly what they were. If circumstances had been different, they wouldn't be friends at all. Was that irksome? Draco didn't care. Potter seemed to care about making friends though. The right kind of friends. Draco angrily flipped the pillow over so he could rest his hot head on the cool side. Why in the world was he losing sleep over this? He firmly shut his eyes.
"Well, you did behave rather poorly," Patricia agreed.
Teddy fluttered his innocent doe eyes at Harry. "Encourage me to do what?" He placed three cards down. "Three sevens."
"I have a
By then, Scorpius could make out faint music and muffled clatter. His curiosity piqued, he wriggled out of his father's grasp and ran up ahead, trying to catch up to his cousin. Harry waved him along when he looked back to make sure it was okay to go. Then Harry turned to Draco, finally letting go of him. "What is your problem?"
Harry let out a forlorn sigh. "Not really."
He easily stepped up beside Draco, matching his stride as they blended into the evening crowd in the busy city. "Are you okay?"
Draco handed The Quibbler back to Theo without comment.
The next day, Draco was in a right foul mood from the absurd 'conversation' with his son, fresh snow that had fallen the night before, and the Gringotts goblin who had taken him down a wrong turn, adding an additional ten minutes to what was supposed to be a quick stop at the bank. Now he was fighting his way out of there when he was jostled in the shoulder. He stumbled to the side, knocking into a crotchety old witch who snarled at him. He snarled back and then whipped his head around to glare at the offending party.
"What else did Teddy tell you?"
"I won't say it, but I've been feeling this way for a while, Draco."
Draco pulled his gaze away from the window. The boys had marched out of the kitchen, taking their hullabaloo with them and leaving the kitchen quiet again. Harry was studying him with a kind expression. "I'm not fretting," Draco lied.
"Then no one should say you can't cry."
"It's not going to work."
Harry grabbed Draco by the collar and forced him outside, slamming the door shut behind them. Draco was too startled to protest and Scorpius jumped in fright when he heard the loud crash of the door striking the jamb. Harry was seething now. "Now you listen to me, Malfoy," he growled. "I couldn't care
"Yeah! Let's play with the Weasleys in the summer, okay?"
Scorpius whined, "Oh, come on, Dad. Look at what we've been working on!" He was talking about the ripped clothes that lay on the floor of his playroom.
In the meantime, Harry had found his way to the wine rack that seemed to span the entirety of the cellar wall. "You could drown a fish in all this," he said, grabbing the neck of a bottle at random. "How about this one?" He shook it around, listening to the sloshing. "Sounds like a good wine."
"Draco's told me." Astoria clasped her hands over Harry's. "I can't thank you enough. For everything. It has meant the world to Scorpius. He doesn't have anyone else."
"That's because I don't need one." Harry reached up and shook the branch above them, dumping fresh snow all over Draco. He laughed along with Teddy when Draco yelped as snow got under his collar and ran down his back.
Draco was still frowning when he made his way up the grand staircase with an armful of candy. Lately he felt like all he ever did was indulge Scorpius and Harry's exploits. What irked Draco the most was that Scorpius seemed to have more fun with Potter than with his own father - whether it be at school, with their inside jokes, or with Teddy, with their games, or at the manor, with flying lessons. It's not as though Draco didn't make an effort with Scorpius. It just seemed like Potter always made
Draco felt as though he had been squeezed through the eye of a needle before falling on his hands and knees, bouncing softly on his landing. He was breathless and disoriented. He whipped his head around to look at where he was. It appeared to be a bedroom. Potter's bedroom? "What the-" He was yanked down. "Whoa. Wait-" He caught himself just before he could smack into Harry. This was not how he expected their talk to go. "What are you doing?"
"Yes," Draco interrupted. "Of course. What kind of a question is that?"
"Ah, no." Harry smiled at him. "I've already eaten."
"I would rather have money," Draco said as he made his way up the stairs. "That's useful. What am I supposed to do with a star?"
"Dad?"
"I know that," Scorpius grumbled. His father was always bursting his bubble. "Harry said he likes me better than you because I'm nicer than you."
Harry sure hoped so as he smiled at Ginny and shrugged uncertainly.
"You wanted to see your cousin, didn't you?"
"Good."
"For school," Scorpius began, "I need to collect different leaves."
He stopped short just as Harry saw him. Harry shook his head in a reassuring manner. Draco hesitated, Harry noticed. "You just need a minute, right?" he asked out loud to Scorpius. Scorpius mumbled something. Harry mouthed, 'He's fine.' Draco, unsure of what to do, leaned against the doorjamb and crossed his arms against his chest. He would just watch for now, he supposed.
"Because you've been awfully needy these past few weeks."
how pathetic your future is because of your actions. You have only yourself to blame for your mistakes. But you have no right bringing your child up to be the same as you. Do you know how isolating his life must be for him? Do you have any idea how hard it has been for Gabrielle and me to bring him out of his shell? To get him to interact with children his own age? To encourage him to even
Draco hopped off the barrel, picked his wand up, regarded it for a moment, then slipped it back into his pocket. "Don't ever touch my wand."
"It matters, doesn't it?"
The overall
"Yes, let's digress," Ron said, eager to move on from any subject that frazzled Hermione so.
"So what am I supposed to do with you?"
"You asked me whether it bothered me." Harry reminded him. "Being here, with you, in this place. You asked me what my ulterior motive was."
Patricia shook her head in defeat. These days Scorpius was absolutely ravenous for her food. He was hitting a growth spurt, that must be the reason, she thought, as she flicked her wand at the sink to fill it with sudsy water. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw through the kitchen window Draco pulling Harry near.
"What's your problem?"
"Don't sleep on the couch."
"I'm only five."
"What if I am?" Harry snapped back. He knew that to be true, but had never seen that as a fault. Right now, however, he really wished he had a newer model. He swept his gaze over the horizon, squinting at the setting sun that coloured the skies with vivid red. Whose big idea was this anyway? He looked down at the small speck below them, and he could make out Scorpius waving wildly at them from the ground. Their friendly Seeker match had turned quite a bit more competitive. Draco had hardly broken a sweat.
"I'd say we all look a little stupid today." Harry gave Gabrielle a side-eye.
"Don't read other people's letters!"
Hermione was one of the many who smiled in response. She knelt down next to Scorpius. "Harry's told us a lot about you, Scorpius," she said.
Scorpius finally smiled through his tears. "Mhm, yeah."
"No, duh."
"Easy, Potter," Draco said as he sidled past. His fingers lingered at Harry's hip.
Harry shoved her to get her to stop.
"He doesn't think so anymore."
"Cheat."
Theo arched a brow. "Ah, is that so?"
"Fine." Harry held still for her inspection. "He was a bit shaken up."
"Last time we talked about him, you were using a few choice phrases. What were they again? Elitist? Ponce? Git?" Theo frowned at Draco. Lately it was getting quite hard to figure him out. "He hates your guts. After all you've done to that poor sod, how does he even stand you?"
Draco finished with Scorpius' hair and finally let him go. "You need money to get me what I want."
"I'll get Dad." Scorpius sped out of the kitchen.
Draco groaned in dismay as the streaming sunlight struck his face. He thought of burying himself under the blankets for another hour longer, but he heard commotion downstairs that roused him. He felt as though he had gotten barely a wink of sleep. He pushed himself out of bed and up for the day. A few minutes later, he was looking presentable, awake, and rather surprised when he found Astoria in his kitchen, making pancakes. His eyes narrowed. This was an unexpected scene. He needed coffee to deal with whatever was happening here. He didn't say a word to her, despite her beaming at him and humming a cheery Christmas tune. Astoria knew Draco well enough to keep mum until he had at least a bit of caffeine in him, so she kept flipping pancakes, setting the knives to cut up bananas, and sipping on her latte. Draco became even irritated when he realized that Astoria hadn't bothered to make a full pot of coffee. He brewed a fresh batch, poured himself a cup, and glared at her from across the kitchen.
"Scorpius, this is everyone," Harry introduced. "Come on." He tugged the boy away from his leg.
Harry swished his wand at the pantry. Scorpius' eyes widened when an assortment of cheeses, cold cuts and spreads floated out. "I used to do this with Teddy," Harry said conversationally as he sat down without noticing Scorpius' astonishment. "He's such a picky eater, so I let him make his own sandwich."
"What is it?" Scorpius asked casually.
"Gee, you're polite," Teddy chuckled. "You know, Harry's told me a lot about you."
"I'll be a Seeker like my father," Scorpius said.
That comment snapped Draco out of it. "Wait!" He resorted to stepping out in just his socked feet because Harry was so damned keen to leave. "Where are you going?"
Teddy flipped the cards over, revealing the seven of hearts, seven of diamonds, and seven of clubs.
Scorpius stood stock-still in the middle of Teddy's elaborate bedroom. There was a bed and desk and drawers. But then there were also posters of bands, Quidditch equipment, shelves with books and knick knacks, a large wooden trunk filled with toys, and a plush grey rug taking up most of the floor space. Scorpius was overwhelmed, to say the least.
"Sure, sure," Theo agreed without complaint. "Nice seeing you again, Harry."
Patricia listened to Scorpius' woes in the privacy of the playroom, as always. She could be trusted to lend a sympathetic ear. Scorpius was wondering how he could help put things back the way they were before the summer. He had said some mean things about Harry and shouted a lot at his father back then. He fidgeted with his colour pencils that lay scattered on his desk. He wished he could take it all back.
"Then tell him you'll only eat it once a week."
Things had begun to spiral out of control since then.
"My thoughts exactly." Harry placed a finger at his lips. "You get ice-cream after, so it's worth it. Trust me."
"Hypothetically."
"I think it's pretty cool."
Scorpius glared at Draco when a quiet sound interrupted his concentration. Draco was quick to look out the window and feign innocence. "Do you have something to say?" Scorpius asked in a clipped tone; another line Draco sometimes used on Scorpius when he was being stubborn.
all that. I'm not a baby! I'm not dumb!"
"Tell him you've remembered you're busy."
"Is Potter all you talk about these days?"
Draco snapped the lid onto the box of cookies and slid it over towards Harry. "Weasley, right?" he guessed. "Rickety bungalow, three kids, annual Quidditch League pass, Christmas year-round, that sort of thing." Draco turned around and rested against the counter beside Harry, both staring out the window at the fresh sparkling snow that had fallen overnight. The year had gone by quickly this time around. "The holidays aren't too bad," Draco confessed. "Mother used to dress the manor like this. She would throw lavish Christmas parties, mostly to impress. I don't think she had many friends, not in the strictest sense of the word. The presents, I didn't mind. I never liked putting it on for the society ladies though." When Astoria did her elaborate decorations, Draco was brought back to those memories. It was bittersweet, remembering his mother swishing her wand in an elegant swoop to wrap a garland around the tree. Things were different now, especially after divorcing Astoria. There were no more parties at the Malfoy Manor. No more facades. It was a lot quieter. "I did have a good time yesterday."
In the basement, something had gone horribly wrong. This kitchen had a mind of its own to begin with. The house was so old. Cooking accidents aplenty. But why today of all days? Harry looked around him in dismay.
A few minutes later, Harry, Draco, Ron, and Hermione were seated on the musty couches upstairs. Draco had his arms crossed at his chest and one of his knees bounced in an off-beat rhythm. He was frowning at Ron who was too busy frowning at Harry to notice. Hermione sat on the edge of her seat, waiting to hear an explanation while Harry darted his eyes at all of them, trying to gauge the atmosphere. There was just silence for a few minutes until Hermione broke it by clearing her throat. The three men turned their attention to her. She nodded at Harry, urging him to begin.
Draco wiped his mouth and rested the back of his head against the cool tile behind him as he caught his breath. An unbelievable nightmare, that’s all this was. He pressed a hand against his fevered forehead.
Teddy looked over his shoulder at Scorpius. "I probably kicked you a lot, huh?" He knew he was an excitable sleeper. Andromeda and Harry had made no secret of it. In fact, he sleepwalked so often that his friends at school had a Caterwauling Charm set around his bed to wake him if he decided to go on a night wander.
He exits the bathroom quietly, hoping Draco won’t come rushing back up now that Harry’s left the bathroom. When he doesn’t, Harry gets dressed. No more excuses, he thinks, time to face Draco. He doesn’t let himself consider how his life is ruined. How he might as well take Matt up on the offer to sell drugs, or his arse, because when Draco knows, Harry will have an Auror partner who can’t bear to look at him.
Admitting to himself that he wants to sleep with Malfoy seems to have opened some sort of floodgate in his brain, and now every time he closes his eyes Malfoy is there – pushing Harry up against a wall and breathing hot on his neck, bending Harry over the desk in his classroom, getting to his knees with a look of hunger. The dreams are a constant onslaught that haunts Harry in his waking hours too, whenever his mind drifts off or he looks at Malfoy for too long. Just yesterday Harry walked into a wall because he was too busy staring at Malfoy’s arse to see where he was going. The untethered anger Harry had been so worried about is gone completely, replaced by a desperate sexual frustration that is very much tethered.
Pansy, Ginny and Draco are still sitting in the living room where he left them hours ago. It feels strange to see them there like nothing life-altering has happened today at all and Harry is suddenly furious with them. With Draco for being so comfortable being loveless and with Pansy and Ginny for having the one thing Harry wants to want more than anything. He hates them all for making it look so easy, and he hates himself because he doesn’t hate them – he’s just jealous.
“Harry? Harry, are you home?” Draco calls from the hallway. It’s a Friday afternoon and Harry’s been enjoying his day off with baking chocolate cupcakes to celebrate the beginning of summer. It had all gone well enough until Draco’s Apparition had startled him so bad chocolate frosting had gone everywhere.
Millie shrugged. “Yes. And your permission to run it in your name. I don’t think I’ll get enough funding and donations otherwise. And well, you still get people sending you money every single day asking you to use it to make the world better and shit. And the royalties from those biographies people insist on writing. I was hoping you would donate that to the foundation, since I know you don’t want it.”
Harry walked over to the river and noticed a few stone steps leading down to a small bridge. Beyond that was a small trail leading into the forest. It was probably the route he would have taken there if he couldn’t Apparate.
Draco’s preference quickly became the brewing room they set up for him. He spent hours upon hours in the room, testing potions and new recipes to make potions more effective or to reduce their side-effects. By late March, Harry was pretty sure Draco wouldn’t make it to his self-imposed deadline of staying at his job until summer. His boss refused to accept Draco’s proposed changes to make medicinal potions more effective and was clearly furious that Draco continued to develop and improve potions for people she deemed to have ‘self-imposed’ issues.
As it turns out though, Draco is the one with his emotions on the outside. He goes suspiciously quiet towards the end of the movie, and when the credits roll and Harry sneaks a glance over at him he’s full on crying.
Harry tries to give Draco his winning ‘Harry Potter’ smile, but his mouth is so swollen it probably comes out weird.
“Desperate for it, aren’t you?” Malfoy asks.
“Honestly, I was seconds away from hexing her hair off,” Draco said, after he’d brought one of his improved potions to her. “She actually had the audacity to stand there and say that if we made the medicine for detoxing painless then people wouldn’t have a reason to stop using drugs. Like it’s the pain of going off drugs that keeps people from becoming addicted.”
“There you are,” Matt says, his arms wrapping around Harry from behind. “Wondered if you’d show up after the text Crucio sent you.”
Harry grabs the stick back from Ayla when she returns it to him. He picks her up and walks over to Draco, feeling strangely happy despite his surroundings.
Draco is suddenly closer to him on the sofa, and Harry doesn’t know when that happened. “Please tell me you know what BDSM is,” Draco says. He doesn’t touch Harry, but his hand twitches like he’s thinking about reaching out.
to see the small red marks he must be leaving all over Harry’s neck.
Draco bit his lip, considering. "Are you sure?"
On Halloween Draco comes with Harry to visit Godric's Hollow and his parents' graves. Harry’s brought flowers, like he always does, but something feels different this year. Visiting this graveyard has always brought up this ache in him, ever since the first time he visited with Hermione during the war. He’s come here alone, with Hermione, with Ron and Hermione, and with Ginny and he’s always felt the ache. Part of it is missing his parents, and that’s still there, but the other part was missing a home. Now he stands over their graves and looks over at where Ayla is picking up a stick and giving it to Draco clearly wanting him to throw it and Draco’s anxious expression as he tries to decide if throwing a stick with your dog is allowed in a cemetery, and Harry doesn’t feel that ache for home. He’s found who he is and what he wants, and he has so many people in his life to love and be loved by.
“I said, I was hoping you would stay behind after class. I have something I would like to discuss with you.”
are gay then?” The news seems to surprise Ginny, despite the whole debacle being her suggestion.
“You bought a TV?” Harry asks, “but you don’t have electricity in your flat.”
Harry feels a rush of joy and relief at the question. Draco doesn’t want their relationship to evolve into something Harry doesn’t enjoy, and he doesn’t want it to devolve either. He just wants this, for as long as it feels good for them both.
“Please do, so I don’t have to keep making embarrassing admissions,” Harry laughed, reaching for a new tomato.
Harry cringed a little. “Don’t call him that. Malfoy is the sixteen-year-old bigoted idiot. I can’t separate the name from that boy.”
Upon seeing Harry’s confused expression, he continues. “To the library Potter, care to join me? I could give you special treatment by helping you with your Potions homework.”
“And you’ll tell me if you start to feel that, what did you call it? Emotional hangover?”
“My puns are not catastrophically bad!”
“You can’t help anyone if you’re not taking care of yourself,” Hermione said.
Harry searched his brain for a new topic of conversation, because he wasn’t sure he could talk anymore about his future without having some time to think on it first.
Malfoy's smile grew at Harry's admission, and his eyes glinted with arousal. "I'll just have to teach you then. Wait here."
Harry nods, biting his lip and keeping his eyes fixed on their joined hands.
Draco shakes his head. “No, because what if you say ‘don’t stop?’ or I just
Draco is standing in the doorway of the balcony with a self-satisfied grin. Alya is sniffing at the door and trying to make her way out between Draco’s legs, but Draco doesn’t let her pass until Harry’s caught up. Only then does he move out of the way to let Harry see what he’s done.
“And it made us miserable,” Ginny agrees, “I didn’t really feel that love you said you had until after we broke up. It was like you were suddenly free to love me in the way you wanted to love me, instead of trying to love me the way you thought you had to.”
“I used to feel lost, looking at the stars,” Draco says. Harry jumps, having been so lost in the twinkling above that he hadn’t heard Draco come outside.
“What do you mean?” Draco asks.
“Shit,” Harry says. He pulls at his duvet in panic, double-checking that it’s covering his naked body. “Sorry, I forgot I asked you to come here this morning. I’ll —,”
Harry bit his lip hard to keep from asking for more, and he felt a rush of victory when Draco started using a second finger without being prompted. Draco used his fingers expertly now, bending and twisting them in just the right way to make Harry a twisting moaning mess on the bed. Harry’s hips rose desperately to meet the fingers on every thrust, and pleasure rushed through him every time they brushed past his prostate. Like this, he wouldn’t have to beg to be fucked. He wasn’t going to last long enough to beg. Draco put a possessive hand at the back of Harry’s neck, letting his fingernails dig into Harry’s skin just enough to hurt but not enough to mark. Harry gasped and pushed back into Draco and he was so close, any second now he was going to –
“It has a whole chapter on romantic and sexual attraction,” Hermione says, “you should read it – it’s really interesting.”
sees it is because he spent a good year of his life following Malfoy around like a stalker. He knows how Malfoy will straighten his back and force his hands open to hide his nerves.
Harry goes home first, because Draco is a maniac and will probably fire-call to make sure he’s really there, instead of out doing something reckless. Of course, he’ll be right but Harry reserves the right to act a little reckless sometimes. Sure enough, a shower and a drink later Harry’s fire flashes green. Harry accepts the call and kneels down to talk with Draco when the sod walks through entirely.
“I’ll spend the night in Ginny’s old room,” Draco says when he reappears with the movie in one hand and a bag in the other, “I want fancy birthday drinks with umbrellas in them and one shouldn’t drink and Apparate.”
, and Harry has no intention of doing anything else.
Harry remembered that conversation. How Draco loved to make his sexual partners talk about what they enjoyed, how he liked to see them a little flustered with it. The reminder made his cheeks even warmer, and if he wasn’t careful, he’d end up matching the tomatoes in colour.
Draco doesn’t usually call him Potter anymore, but apparently he has to revert back to it when he’s particularly disgusted or angry. ‘Harry’ just doesn’t have the same opportunity for harshly pronounced consonants as ‘Potter’ does. At least that’s how Harry imagines Draco would explain it if Harry ever got the guts up to ask him about it. He doesn’t though, because the other option is that Draco uses his last name to distance them somehow. Or that Draco still considers him ‘Potter’ and just forgets to censor himself when he’s angry. Better not to know.
“Happy anniversary,” he says into Daniel’s mouth.
“I know who M is,” Harry said. He sounded out of breath, and he looked desperately at Hermione as if she would have all the answers to his current predicament.
Harry made a frustrated sound into the bed.
Harry thinks back to what he actually knows about Daniel. “He’s kind,” he settles on. “He didn’t give me any grief about changing my mind about the sex, and he let me kip on his sofa.”
“That doesn’t make sense,” Harry said. His heart hammered in his chest, and his body felt trapped somewhere in-between rage and hope and hurt.
"Why are you with me, Harry?" Daniel asks, face suddenly constricted with a sadness Harry's only ever seen the shadows of before.
“Where are you headed?” Harry asks, figuring he might as well since he’ll have to follow.
The woman laughed. She was pretty, Harry thought. Her hair and eyes were both a warm brown colour and her smile lit up her whole face. Maybe he should take her out. Or if she was coming to his house anyway, he could just take her upstairs. They wouldn't have to do anything more for the media to assume something was going on, and Harry found less people tried to pick him up if he’d just been pictured with someone else.
“Nothing,” Harry says, turning his back to Draco to start on his dishes. He knows there is a spell for this, a little fix that would make his life so much easier — he’s never learned it though. Never thought to ask Molly when he was fresh out of Hogwarts, and years down the line it felt like it was too late.
“You don’t know for sure if you’re having a party or not?” she asked, still laughing.
When Harry makes it to breakfast in the morning he finds Ron waiting for him at one of the tables. The Dining Hall in the newly separated part of the castle looks different to what Harry’s used to from his schooldays. Instead of four large tables covered in food the Hall is filled with smaller tables that’ll seat anywhere from two to six people. A long table spanns the far wall, and it’s filled with various breakfast foods. Cereal, fruits, toast, different types of eggs, bacon, sausages and vegetables. At the very end of the table there are various drinks; coffee, tea, juices and milk. It reminds Harry of the buffet at the Muggle hotel he stayed at once, and he vaguely remembers reading something about measures to reduce food waste and limit extra work for the Hogwarts house-elves in the letter he received a few weeks back.
Harry doesn’t have time to reply, doesn’t know what he would say if he could. Draco’s words leave him feeling warm and desired in a way that’s too raw to be spoken. Maybe Draco knows, because he pushes in hard after he’s said them. Harry throws his head back and gasps at the delicious stretch, and Draco buries his groan in Harry’s neck.
"Merlin's tits!" Draco says, "That was really him!"
“You talk as if I would know a single thing about romantic relationships,” Draco says, but their voices are coming closer and Harry knows he’ll soon be sharing a bed with the both of them.
“That’s – holy shit.” Draco looked at Harry in surprise.
“Well, how do you know you love me?” Ginny asks. Pansy and Draco are both uncharacteristically silent and Harry feels it doesn’t bode well for where the conversation is going.
“Fuck,” he said to the empty room, burying his head in his hands. “Fuck, fuck, fuck!”
“I might have a few
“I’m horny,” Harry admits. “And it’s frustrating because it feels like being hungry and going to the kitchen to find nothing that looks appetizing.”
“That’s it Harry, Merlin, you’re perfect. So perfect.”
He carefully worked Draco’s pants down to rest above his knees with his trousers and stared in wonder at Draco’s cock. The hair around it was blond, but darker than the hair on Draco’s head. It bent a little towards Draco’s belly, the foreskin pulled tight by his arousal. It was bigger than Harry’s, but not significantly and Harry wanted it. Wanted Draco. He wanted it in his mouth, in his hand, in his arse.
The belt lands against his arse again and Harry groans as heat spreads from where the belt hit and through his body. Draco swings the belt again, and Harry’s focus closes in on the sensations of his body and the heat of his arse as the belt lands, impact after impact. He feels charged, each stroke of the belt sending electricity through him that's building and building until he’s ready to explode with it.
“Doesn’t really matter whose fault it is. I’m done trying. People either want me to become famous by proxy or they think they love this image of me that isn’t me. I’m not doing it again.”
“Fuck,” Harry laughs, “this is just like a scene from one of those terrible romcom movies.”
“Right now, my plan is I sell my house, because I don’t want to go back there. And then I buy a house with a huge garden, or maybe even a small farm because it turns out I really like to garden and be outdoors. And then, if or when that doesn’t feel like enough, I’ll make a new plan.”
Hermione snorts and closes her book. “Ron, I’m sure he already knows.”
“I wanted to apologise,” Malfoy starts.
“We use Muffilato all the time,” Harry protests.
“A little,” Harry laughs. “We’ve had pizza every day for two weeks. I never thought I’d say it, but I’m a little sick of pizza.”
Harry scribbles a hasty note to the records office asking if there is a file on Martin Walker, and the file comes flying into their office before Daco finishes his rant over the incompetence of everyone but himself and Harry.
Draco enters his bedroom wearing only his pants, and carrying a wet towel and a glass of orange juice. Harry’s pleased to see the wet patch on Draco’s pants and he doesn’t bother asking about the stuff he’s brought. Draco will explain when he’s ready. Draco places glass and the towel on Harry’s nightstand and looks down at Harry’s clenched fists.
“Could you get some basil?” he asked Draco, gesturing to the row of herbs behind the tomatoes. Draco didn’t move, and when Harry turned to look at him, he was biting his lip and pulling nervously at his scarf.
“Please can we talk about Potions now?” Harry begs, pulling his Potions book out of his bag and slamming it on the table next to his parchment.
“Is this one of those things where I’m making something difficult that doesn’t actually have to be?” he asked.
Ginny grins. “Both. There’s a VIP section just for Magical folks upstairs, but it’s more fun down here.”
Harry freezes when Crabbe pulls out his wand. They’d assumed he wouldn’t use magic, not in front of people he thought to be Muggles. Fuck, what if the anti-Apparition charms aren’t up yet? He could side-along Harry to fuck-knows-where.
“Maybe he just wasn’t the right person for you,” Ginny says, her voice soothing. “You’ll find someone to love. Just give it time.”
Draco fixes him with a serious stare then. “Frodo thinks he’s going to his death though, you had hope, didn’t you?”
Harry takes a bite of his sausage and pretends to think. “Oh, what could it be, Mr. Potions professor.”
taking care of me.”
“You sure you still want this?” Draco asked, taking a step back from Harry.
“I mean, if anything it’s makeup-sex right?” Harry says, still smiling.
Harry tugs gently at Draco’s clothes. He’s wearing so many of them, when Harry is just in jeans and t-shirt, and he wants skin. He wants heat and desperation and closeness, and he’s tugging fruitlessly at Draco’s clothing when he realises that Draco is waiting for him to
Draco laughs. “That’s a weird rule.”
She holds out the bottle, and Harry notices the ring on her finger before Draco does. He’s grateful for that, because his best friend is engaged and he’s going to be happy about it when she tells him. He’s going to grin and cry with joy and toast to her happiness with Pansy – he just needs a moment.
Harry's breathing sped up as he let Malfoy wrap a soft fabric around his wrists. It wasn't smooth enough to be silk, but not rough enough to be a rope either. It was velvet, Harry realised, when Malfoy gave a tug to the ribbon and the fabric suddenly felt rough around Harry's wrists.
Draco scoffs, “You never sleep well. If you sleep at all. Some days I worry you’re a Vampire, and where would we be then Potter? Me, an Auror, you a bloodthirsty creature. Utter disaster.”
“Yeah,” Harry shrugged. “The whole, reluctant attraction and submission thing is hot.”
Harry winces at the memory of the wet kiss he’d shared with Cho and the awkward realisation that he really wasn’t interested when he’d tried to pick things up with Ginny after the war.
“I mean, just because we divide work and knowledge between us on the job doesn’t mean we’re stupid enough to think we’d both pass the exam if we each learned half the curriculum,” Harry says.
“Ok, but is he hot?” Ginny asks, a grin plastered across her face.
be a good one if you’re an arsehole.”
“I’m glad you did,” Harry says. His voice breaks a little, sore from crying and disuse.
“Fuck it, he didn’t die, he was murdered. After spending a year trapped in his own body, forced to do whatever his father wanted. Taking down Crabbe Senior is the reason I fought so hard to join the Aurors in the first place.”
Harry groans and reaches down to his jeans. They’ve waited long enough for this, no matter what way you choose to look at it. Waited too long to realise their attraction, waited too long to have a proper conversation. Waited too long to feel the stretch of the other’s cock opening them up.
it fits better than anything he’s ever come across before.
I did, but I never had a crush on him or anything.”
"No," Malfoy said, eyes still fixed on Harry. "I'm not sharing tonight."
“Right, so are we done? Only I’d like to get to lunch.” Harry stuffs his book into his bag without waiting for an answer. He’s ready to find Hermione and get this
“Alright, go on,” Draco says. Harry’s eyes follow Draco’s circling finger up to his hand and his muscled forearm.
Draco had long since finished hanging his coat and he shuffled a little under Harry’s stare. And shit, he really was staring. Blushing a little Harry turned his head to focus on the tomato he was supposed to be dicing.
Harry’s good mood fades rapidly at the question. He’s so tired of the whole concept, tired of feeling left out in conversations about ‘hot chicks’ when he’s out with Ron and Dean, and ‘hot blokes’ when he’s with Ginny and Hermione. Tired of trying to find something about a person that’s probably ‘hot’ to point out to others. He doesn’t fucking know if Daniel’s ‘hot’.
Ginny summons two cans of soda from the fridge before sitting down next to him. “Tell me everything! Are you going to see him again?”
“Yeah, sure.” Harry agrees without giving it too much thought. He has no desire to disrupt class or start a fist fight in the corridor after all.
of Draco. The Potions lesson Harry had spent admiring Draco’s teaching technique.
"You know him?"
"Colour," Draco said when he'd finished tying his knot. He stood and walked to stand in front of Harry, running a hand through Harry's hair as he did.
“Dentist,” he says, and coughs.
Harry laughs with relief, itching to reach out and kiss Draco. “So nobody at work will know about — well, Henry?”
Draco fucks him through the orgasm, muttering words of praise and encouragement in his ear.
Harry gapes. “I don’t – I didn’t, I… What?”
“I want you to touch me,” Malfoy says.
Harry can’t help it, images of Draco bending him over the kitchen table and holding him down while he fucks him rush his brain, and his cock starts to harden in his pants.
Ron shook his head. “Physically, sure. But you’re not here, not really. I don’t want this front you’re putting on to please – I don’t even know who you’re trying to please. I want my friend back. I want you to answer my question of ‘how are you’ with something real, not a rant about this week’s social issue.”
“Absolutely, I want a literal mountain of Naan though, or there just isn’t any point.”
“I need to work on this whole instinct where I instantly think you hate me,” Draco said. He rolled the sleeve back up to his elbow and walked close enough to lean on the kitchen counter next to Harry.
“Mine,” he breathes into Harry’s mouth, leaning down to bite softly at where Harry’s neck meets his shoulder.
Harry feels stupid. He should have realised that on his own, really. “Oh, that makes sense.”
“Harry,” Hermione says, looking up from the book to stare at Harry. “Did you ever try to break the spell?”
Harry decides to ignore the fact that Dumbledore’s portrait apparently spends his days spying on the students and opens the cabinet to pull out the massive Pensieve there. It’s lighter than it looks, and the basin is empty.
“Why did you go with him?”
“I was thinking the study on the ground floor would be a very nice brewing room for you,” Harry added. “You know, for when you finally quit your job. And for the Wolfsbane potions your boss won’t let you brew at work.”
“’Course,” Harry said.
- from ‘Caged Bird’ by Maya Angelou
Harry looked up at Hermione who was sitting in the armchair across him and she shook her head. She hadn’t explained then. Not that she really knew what was going on.
Harry looks at them and knows he’s about to lose them to the privacy of their bedroom. He’s happy for them both, they make each other glow with happiness and want and he suffocates the twinge of jealousy he feels for them being able to have that and basks in their happiness instead.
“I think if we did a scene when I’m in one of those moods I wouldn’t be able to use the safeword. So maybe if we just have a question before starting, like ‘should we do a scene?’ then we could avoid that happening?”
. I thought everyone knew that after the whole Weasley clan walked in on me snogging Charlie. Not exactly how I wanted it to go, but I did think it was effective.” Harry turns to Hermione. “It was effective, wasn’t it? Pretty clear indication that I’m not straight? No further explanation needed?”
Malfoy walks out quickly, and Harry has to hurry after him, so he’s not pulled by his wrist. By the time he makes it out of the classroom Malfoy is already rounding the corner and Harry half runs after him, his wrist icy cold. When he turns the corner though, he almost crashes into Malfoy who’s leaning against the wall, arms crossed.
He fire-calls Molly and says he can’t make it to dinner, and then he paces. Draco never said
Harry pauses, like he would if he was speaking to someone who could actually answer. No answer comes, of course, but the silence is comforting rather than painful. “Anyways, I realised I was looking in all the wrong places, because the only person who can make sense of me and what I want from life is me. And I feel like I finally found what I was looking for because I know who I am now, and I feel at home in myself.”
. It had been better with Ginny than with the random girl a while after they broke up, still not like they both thought it should be, hence the breakup, but definitely better because he knew her.
Draco presses his finger against Harry’s rim, but doesn’t push inside and Harry wants to scream with frustration.
Harry nods slowly. That had indeed been Crabbe. And it had been Matt, the guy Harry had fucked only two weeks prior. Harry inhales shakily through his nose before opening his eyes to look at Draco. He looks excited, a hint of something wild in his eyes and the hurt from before forgotten.
“I — anything, just, please. More.”
He tries to make the invitation sound like a joke, or like it’s perfectly natural for Harry to ask Malfoy to breakfast. He’s not sure he succeeds at either. But he’s sick and tired of following Malfoy around under a cloak, and they’re friendly now so why can’t they have breakfast together?
Harry hands the glasses out and grins at his friends, “to Pansy and Ginny.”
“I was just –,” Malfoy trails off, but it doesn’t matter. The thought he started completes itself as a whisper in Harry’s ear.
Pleasure ebbs and flows in him, building steadily with every moan in the room, every thrust of Malfoy’s hips. The ropes around his torso only intensify everything, makes his skin flame with sensitivity and pleasure every time Malfoy pulls on them. Harry doesn’t know if he’s moaning or cursing, but his mouth still hangs open, gasping for breath and making sounds he’s too far gone to identify.
The fingers disappear without warning, and Harry feels empty without them. Disconnected.
“Yeah, not really. I haven’t been sleeping too well since we got here, if I’m honest.”
She looks almost scared, and Harry doesn’t understand why. He almost got off with a bloke last night, he obviously doesn’t mind the same gender part.
“So, er, what are we doing in class today?” Harry asks, trying to distract Malfoy from looking at his arse. He’s not sure he’ll be able to resist turning around and doing something stupid again if Malfoy’s thoughts don’t shut up.
“Harry, you coming to dinner?” Ron asks. He doesn’t open the door, even though it’s unlocked. This small act Harry fills with warmth for his friend. For how well Ron knows Harry and his need for having his own space; the need to be completely in control of it.
December 9th
“Fuck off,” Harry said, but he let the pillow he’d placed over his cock fall off as he twisted to take in the sight of Draco slowly shedding his clothes, taking the time to fold them before placing them on an empty chair.
Harry pulls out of the memory with his eyes closed, taking a moment to gather himself as his consciousness settles back into his body.
The words sound happy against Harry’s ear and he smiles as he follows Malfoy back into the classroom, silently thanking his robes’ effectiveness in hiding a boner.
Ron rolled his eyes and smiled. “True. So, Malfoy, huh?”
upside down.
So, he waited.
Despite Ginny's promises, Harry still feels unsure walking down the street towards the club. At least it’s not cold out, if anything it’s strangely warm for the middle of October. Harry studies the leaves that hang stubbornly onto the trees in the park they’re walking past and thinks maybe it’s time to let go a little. For the leaves and him both. He doesn’t go out much these days, or any days really. The feeling of being in the wrong place always hangs over him, whispering in his ear and his heart that he shouldn’t be there. The feeling had only grown stronger in the short months he and Ginny had dated after the war, but it’s better now, and at least it’s quiet when he’s in his own home.
“You made the balcony into a garden?” Harry asks, tearing his eyes away from the newly made garden to look at Draco in surprise.
Harry feels his face warm at the idea that he’s apparently been narrating his wet dreams out loud for his entire life without anyone bothering to tell him. Merlin that means Neville, Dean and Seamus probably know about the dreams, that had been so fucking hot and so fucking shameful, too. The horrible realisation that Ron must have heard Harry moaning
“I wish I could be enough for someone,” he says, “I’m not saying I need to be the only person in their life, or that they can’t have a boyfriend or a girlfriend. I just need to not be dumped as a person because they traded up.”
“You didn’t touch?” he asks.
Harry groans and arches up against Draco seeking more heat, more friction. Draco breaks the kiss and moves down Harry’s body, licking and kissing his way past Harry’s nipples down to his belly button. He bites softly at Harry’s hipbone and moves lower, tongue leaving a wet trail that makes Harry feel sensitive as it cools his skin.
“What do you want?” Draco asks, and Harry can’t suppress the thought that it’s a cruel question. He wants more than tonight, he wants everything Draco won’t let him have.
When Draco pulls out and casts a cleaning charm over them both Harry hums and grins. “That was a great idea.”
“What’s that stick?” Harry asks, praying that Draco can hear him through the door. He’s not in the room, he can’t be or he’d have brushed against Harry by now to let him know. What if Crabbe put spells on the door? What if Draco hasn’t heard anything?
“Draco, I don’t want –,” Harry said, but Draco cut him off.
Harry shivers as the words are spoken gently against his ear. He’d woken up achingly hard from a dream just an hour ago and listening to Malfoy’s thoughts about his body is making Harry’s erection return at a frightening speed.
Malfoy’s hand on him is too dry and too gentle, and it’s the best Harry’s ever had just because it’s
“So, it’s not just satisfying some curiosity?” Malfoy says, remaining by the door like he’s decided he needs this clarified before they touch. He must know as well as Harry does that once they start touching, they won’t stop.
This time Malfoy does laugh. “Never thought I’d hear you say that.”
“She’s told the press you’re taking a much-deserved vacation in the US,” Hermione said. “Though she dropped enough subtle hints that everyone thinks you’re actually in the US to do something heroic and altruistic that you don’t want credit for. She’s excellent at her job.”
“Millie,” Draco said. “She’s my friend too, remember? I knew she worked for you, so when I couldn’t reach you through the site I went to her.”
“I don’t want to be Harry Potter anymore,” he said. “I mean, the public figure. I don’t want to do it anymore.”
Draco keeps staring, mouth open and eyes wide and looking less put together than Harry’s ever seen him. “You — you love me?”
"How long were you going to let this go on? How long were you going to let me want you and love you without wanting me back?"
. He’d thought – maybe at least one, but no. Fuck. He’d let himself hope again.
He comes with a groan, clenching around Draco who curses and grabs Harry’s hand, intertwining their fingers as they come. They clean each other off with lazy spells after, and Draco wraps his arms tightly around Harry before falling asleep.
“Do tell,” Draco says, summoning four glasses from the kitchen with a lazy flick of his wand. “What are we celebrating?”
When the sensations he’s feeling start to change, Harry opens his eyes and almost jumps at how close Daniel is. He wants to laugh at himself, because he hadn’t forgotten Daniel was there – had he? Harry’s eyes drop to Daniel’s mouth and somehow the sight of the man he’s been enjoying very much grinding up against leaning in for a kiss chases the good feelings away in an instant. Still, he accepts the kiss and tries to make his lips and tongue move in a way that’s right. People always seem to really enjoy kissing, Ginny definitely had looked like she liked it earlier but Harry can never quite get over the slightly nauseating feeling of something wet and rough against his own tongue. And he doesn’t know how to do it, how to make it feel good for whoever he’s kissing because he can’t just get lost in it like Ginny says she does. Daniel seems to be enjoying it though, if the hardness pressing up against Harry is any indication.
Once Harry’s got the pillow in place Draco presses against him with two fingers and Harry groans as he feels them stretch their way into his body. Merlin, he loves that feeling. He pushes down on them, silently begging for Draco to move.
The office is empty too, and it allows Harry in without a password. The Pensieve is nowhere to be seen, and Harry wonders if summoning it would be a terrible idea.
Harry tells Draco everything. He starts out with the intention of just explaining what he got out of Matt while he was on Veritaserum in the living room. All about Crabbe going by the name Crucio, which makes them both flinch, and about getting a phone number to contact him. But when he’s finished with that part Draco just keeps looking at him, so Harry continues. He tells Draco about the sex, and it’s easier than he’d thought. Maybe because Draco had seen the evidence of it already, maybe because Draco just nods and sips his tea. When Harry talks about something Matt did that he didn’t particularly enjoy Draco frowns at his tea, and not at Harry and it makes it easier somehow. Harry tells Draco about Matt’s parting words too, just in case it becomes relevant to their work later.
“So, I’ve decided to sell my house,” Harry said.
“Talk to Hermione and Millie. They’ve contacts in the Ministry that can approve your potions for sale, and then you can open your own apothecary. The HP foundation would support you, you know? The potions you’re working on are exactly the kind of thing we made it all about – creating support and resources for the people who fall outside society for some reason.”
Harry laughed. “Turns out you can do pretty impressive things when you bother to read.”
“I just,” Harry shrugs. “I know you to be a pretty possessive person. And I think this memory might bother that part of you. I’m just thinking that a little bit of good old fashioned, rough, possessive sex might be the perfect fix.”
“DVD?” Harry laughs. “Alright let’s get it set up, then we can have a movie and cupcake night. Pansy and Ginny are off on a date this evening so we can order in Indian takeout.”
Back in his room Harry sits on his bed and considers what memories to show Draco. He starts at the end, how he fell broken to the floor when Draco left him. Then he shows him that morning, Harry’s utter bliss when he brushed his teeth. He makes sure to extract the memories in first person, so Draco will feel what Harry felt. Hear what he thought. Harry extracts the first time he looked at Draco in the morning sunlight and thought ‘I’m falling in love with you’. He extracts his thoughts and feelings of joy and pride when Draco fucked him with his fingers, all the while thinking praise and adoring thoughts. He extracts the longing desperate need he’d felt the week before they kissed. Then for good measure he extracts the conversation with Ron, the one that had made Harry blush so furiously on their first day together in the library.
Harry frowns. “Yes, I bloody am! What’s this about?”
place and manages to get a reservation for the same evening. He showers and picks out a nice shirt to wear and almost doesn't wish he could stay home and hang out with Ginny, Pansy and Draco instead. He picks up Daniel and the kiss is fine, and Daniel looks fine. The food is fine and Harry listens to Daniel as he talks about the two cats he'd like eventually, and the kids he wants to raise. And as long as Harry doesn't let the reality that Daniel wants it with
“Fuck, I want you.” Harry’s hands reached out of their own accord to run shaky fingers down the fabric of Draco’s pants. When they brushed over Draco’s cock he hissed and twitched against Harry.
“Desperate?” Harry supplies, grinning.
They spend the entire day together, planning and Harry doesn’t feel an emotional hangover at all. If that’s what he felt, he’d have to tell Draco, but it isn’t. He feels a gentle stiffness in his muscles, and a soreness in his backside that constantly reminds him of how they started the day. He feels a desperate yearning for the man sitting right in front of him. Harry wants to reach out and hold his hand while they work, he wants to ask Draco home for dinner. And it’s not an emotional hangover because it’s not a reaction to something they’ve
For a ridiculous moment Harry considers telling Draco that he does drink on Fridays and Saturdays like a normal person, thank you very much. Fridays he has a pint with Ron, and Saturdays he’ll have a glass of wine at the Burrow. Which means his ‘nights out’ have to be Sundays or weekdays. He imagines telling Draco that it’s more of an emotional hungover than anything else, since there aren’t hangover-cures for those. He imagines just telling Draco everything, but then he imagines the worry Draco only barely manages to hide behind his scathing comments changing into a full-blown panic.
“Yes,” Harry said. He twisted his hands against the ropes, wishing he could reach out and touch Draco to strengthen the weight of his consent; a thrill of arousal ran through him when he couldn’t. He wasn’t the one in control here, and he loved it.
Harry’s hands gripped the sheets tightly, searching for something to ground him through the pleasure he knew was to come. When Draco finally pushed in, they both moaned, and Harry’s arse clenched around Draco as if trying to hold him there. Draco rubbed soothing circles into Harry’s back until he relaxed, then pulled out and pushed back in at an unrelenting pace.
“Finally,” Draco growled. His hands were on Harry’s hips in an instant and he must have already lubed up his cock because it rubbed deliciously over Harry’s rim, dragging over the oversensitive skin there.
“You know how I’d wake you up whenever you had a nightmare, but never from a, er, pleasant dream?” Ron asks. “Ever wonder how I knew the difference?”
the result.
“It’ll be fine, I’ll be there the whole time,” Draco says. “And we’ve got six Aurors on standby, remember?”
Martin and Matt speak quietly to make their transaction. Harry’s eyes stay fixed on Matt the entire time, and he jumps when Draco prods him in the ribs and points to a dark corner further up the alley. Harry stares, and seconds later he sees movement.
Harry resisted the urge to puff his chest with pride that he'd be Malfoy's for the evening, but let a grin spread over his face.
Harry was falling for Draco Malfoy. No, he’d already fallen for Draco Malfoy. And he wasn’t supposed to know it was him.
Hermione grins, “Honestly Harry, I’m very excited about this, it’s such an interesting subject and when you feel more settled with this I’d really like to pick your brain on how it feels.”
Harry cooks them breakfast. Pancakes, strawberries and bacon with maple syrup because he’s feeling drained and the sugar will do him good. Draco pours him a glass of orange-juice and makes tea for them both, remembering to add two sugars to Harry’s.
Harry clenches his fists and refuses to cry. He doesn’t get to be hurt, he's the dick that's been stringing Daniel along. The one who closes his eyes to enjoy sex and who lies and says he's working so he doesn't have to hang out all the time. The one who's known he'll never want to fit the space Daniel has made for a partner in his life, ever since the first fucking date.
Daniel is crying now, and Harry feels horrible because he doesn't feel sad for what
. Alright so he’s attractive as fuck, and it would be a lot easier for Harry if they just started having breakfast together, but he shouldn’t be hurt that Malfoy doesn’t want to. Just like he shouldn’t have been hurt after the war when Malfoy rejected his offer to get a pint. He can admit that Ron had a point about being attracted to Malfoy, but Harry does not and never has had a
“I know! Merlin Draco, I didn’t
Harry doesn’t comment much on the movie until Gandalf dies. The way he falls and keeps falling reminds him of how Dumbledore had died, and he feels himself close off like he always does when his emotions get too big. The Hobbits don’t do that though. They’re on the ground weeping with their pain, and something about it feels like strength.
, but if Crabbe sees his wand he might Apparate out in a second, and they’ll have lost him.
, only they were a shitty human being so you wanted nothing to do with them?”
“Right,” Draco says, and it’s obvious he doesn’t believe it, but Harry doesn’t know how to bridge the gap that always opens up between them when his brain gets like this. He can’t ever say that he wants a hug, and he wants to be held down, and he wants to let go of all control. He especially can’t say it to Draco, because Draco is the one he wants to give all the control to. Harry wants to fall apart and let Draco pick up the pieces, but he
and holds out his hand to Draco instead. “You’ll have to side-along me, I left my wand. And you better have alcohol.”
“Malfoy!” he yells, making Malfoy freeze in place and turn to look at him. Harry freezes too, without any plan for what he’s going to do now that he’s got Malfoy’s attention.
“It’s Hogwarts fault anyway, for not teaching us Latin. The incantation is a blend of the words for cut and always – if we’d had Latin lessons, you would have been able to guess what the spell did.”
“Perfect,” Draco says. His face is buried in Harry’s neck and Harry feels his lips brush over his skin when he talks.
Draco, apparently, does too, because he’s done teasing. His lips close around Harry’s cock and Harry moans and fights to keep his hips steady. Wet fingers linger like a question below Harry’s balls and he bends his knees and lifts his hips slightly to grant them access.
They go to Harry’s, like they always do. And Harry mixes them a drink, like he always does. Then he adds a drop of Veritaserum to Matt’s. Just enough to make him talk honestly for fifteen minutes.
“You should,” Draco smiles. “You deserve to be taken care of, especially after a scene.”
“Alright,” Harry agrees.
“Sleep love, I’ll clean us up,” Draco promised. It was all Harry needed to drift off.
Written for the prompt:
“No, it’s fine,” Draco soothes her. “It is a bit sad sometimes. In a lot of ways I really do want a relationship like you and Pansy have, I just can’t ever seem to find someone I want it with. It’s a little like when you get a day off and you think it’ll be so lovely to just sit down and enjoy a good book, light a candle and just get lost in the story. Only then you read the back of dozens of books, and none of them really interest you, so you just pick one at random, and then you sit down with your candlelight and realise you can’t see the letters properly because it’s too dark so you have to turn the light on, but then the chair isn’t at all comfortable and you try to keep reading because you’ve been looking forward to having a day off with just you and a book for days, but you’re not actually enjoying it because even though that’s the perfect day for someone it’s just not for you. And yeah, sometimes you envy the people who can enjoy that and you really wish you did enjoy it, but you just like a nice bath and music so much more.”
“Is it selfish that I really like it when you talk about me?” Harry asks, wondering if that bothers Draco. If it’s weird that he so desperately wants to hear Draco praise him.
“You did it!” Draco says when the menu of the movie pops up on the screen and the music starts playing. “This one is about magic, isn’t that fun? The Muggles don’t even believe in magic but they make up their own kind to put in their stories.”
To this day Harry still firmly claims that he only followed Malfoy because he clearly was
Harry swallows back the fear that when this case is over Draco will leave the Aurors. Leave Harry. Harry lived through a war, he can live through losing his Auror-partner too. He’s just feeling the effects of what he’d done last night. He always feels unlovable and terrified of being left alone after his
Instantly curious, Harry lifts the book closer to see if there is anything else on the page. Snape had made a spell for his mom, and Harry is instantly curious to know what it does. It can’t be anything terrible, like the spell he had labelled ‘
“I understand why you’re angry,” Malfoy says. “It’s a terrible spell to cast on someone who isn’t interested in you – but I know he never cast it, if that helps at all.”
When Draco finally fucks him, draping his body over Harry’s and thrusting in a slow, torturous rhythm Harry’s already fighting the urge to come. Draco’s hips twitch and fall out of rhythm and he knows he isn’t the only one who feels close and raw.
Harry looks up before his conscious brain catches up to the words.
Harry grins. “Yeah, we could even share it now that we’re going to be in different classes.”
Turning to stare at Draco Harry gapes, “You’d do that for me? Lie to the others?”
Harry’s eyes immediately go to the leather belt wrapped around Draco’s hips. “Please,” he whispers, cock twitching.
“You’re just saying that so we won’t blame you for dragging us back here,” Harry mutters. He had thought, after putting an end to Voldemort, that his anger would ebb away, but instead it just became untethered. Without a healthy outlet for it he finds himself snapping at people who don’t deserve it. His work helps, gives him a target for his rage, but he hasn’t got his work right now.
“Maybe that’s exactly my plan,” Harry laughed, walking into the bathroom to shower and leaving Draco with the image of his naked arse.
“It’s cheating,” Hermione says. “And besides, what if one of the brilliant tips changes the whole potion? They haven’t been properly tested any more than the spells have.”
His orgasm hit more forcefully than he knew it could, making every muscle in his body spasm and shake with pleasure as it washed over him in wave after wave, as if determined to make up for the two he’d missed. Draco fucked him through it, and when Harry’s body finally relaxed and he almost collapsed into bed, Draco kept a firm grip on his hips and kept on fucking him.
“Where do you need to be Ben?”
“No mate.” Jack stopped him with the wave of his hand. “On the house.” He winked at Harry, nodded at Malfoy then walked back to the bar to serve some thirsty dancers.
“I’ve seen Malfoy. Draco Malfoy.”
~~~~~
“Yeah. He doesn’t actually own the place, but with the amount of people that like him and the amount of…”
“I understand mate. Coming in for the first time can be very overwhelming. I’m Jack, by the way” the barman said. He offered his right hand towards him, holding the glass in his other.
Hermione got up from the sofa and walked towards Ron. With Harry glaring at them, they whispered to each other with the occasional outburst of “No, Ron.” and “Give him a break”. Both simultaneously turned to face Harry who suddenly felt very small. Like he was a child about to be told off thoroughly by Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia.
Harry had actually known about his case as the Aurors talked about things such as their cases in the coffee room at break but Harry had a priority case at the moment and illegal potion ingredients aren’t going to deter him.
Being the Saviour and the Chosen One, Harry did have some privileges. Being eye-wateringly late was one of them. By the time he made it to the Ministry, it was already noon and his shift started over 4 hours ago. He also wasn’t in his standard Auror uniform, that was still at his shared flat with Ginny and he couldn’t force himself to go back there just yet.
“Tough time with the big guy?” Jack startled Harry who was now standing in front of him.
“We all had a bet?”
“Need some polyjuice potion.” They both said at the same time.
Harry now felt desire. He wanted, needed something more, more contact. Gracefully, he leaned his head further to the side, giving more exposure to his neck and shoulder. He did feel sort of on display for Malfoy but he didn’t care. Malfoy looked down and seemed to have got the message.
“Obviously upset.” Ron responded with food still in his mouth, “she had just broken up with…” Ron stopped abruptly when he saw that both Harry and Hermione were staring at him, saying “please stop talking or you’ll make this worse”.
“I do kinda agree with the manipulation point? Because, come on, it’s Malfoy!” Ron quickly stated when Hermione gave him the warning look.
Hermione and Ginny took just one look at each other before bursting with laughter. From looking around, Harry could tell that they hadn’t done much packing.
