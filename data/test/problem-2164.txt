Seeing Draco, Teddy leaps out of his chair and runs to hug him, wrapping his arms tightly around Draco’s legs and causing him to stumble a bit.
It's 2005 and Harry has recently purchased a new mobile phone so he can easily keep in touch with his friends. Little did he know that the Muggle technology would lead him down a path of self discovery and safe exploration that would lead him into the soft recesses of the last person he ever expected. As it turns out, very good things can be found in the dark.
Draco hesitantly retrieves his wand from his. "Are you sure you didn't take it with you to Nana's and leave it there?"
“Nothing, just asking about your last battle,” Teddy lies, because if either of them figured out what they were planning, they would do whatever they could to stop it, and Teddy couldn’t have that happening. “Hey, Harry, can Draco come with us to Diagon Alley tomorrow?”
“You just seem really happy. I haven’t seen you this happy with anyone ever so I thought you might like him. So do you?” For such a young boy, he really observed a lot. Harry is actually surprised with how much he picks up on sometimes.
Harry is about to open the door and get Malfoy away from his godson, when he hears Teddy whisper, “Draco?”
Despite not necessarily having bad memories in the room, he felt terrified. He felt as soon as he touched his hand-sewn Slytherin blanket that was draped toward the bottom of his bed, he would be instantly paralyzed. He felt as though if he sat on the bed for a moment, all the progress he made would disappear, and he would disappear into the bed with it. Instead he made for the window seat, a place which had sat cold for nearly an entire year. The gardens looked better now, but had been mostly gray and brown for the past year. It was no use looking at a view to remind him of the state of his life. Now the sun was out and he could be comfortable there again. He settled down and took out his new notebook
“W—what? Father, I don’t want you or mum in prison—“ Draco was left stuttering and grasping for the right words. He had never seen his father like this. Was it because of the Dementors, or was this what his father really thought of him?
“What’s wrong?” Draco was worried about how quickly Harry cut off his sentence. Did he not believe Draco’s apology after all?
“It won’t, not entirely. There’ll be other measures that you should take in your daily life as well to help you.” She walked over to her desk and pulled out a sheet of parchment. “Here are some things to do to relieve anxiety.” Draco gave the paper a once over. It described breathing exercises, coping strategies, and even some yoga positions. “I’d like for you to keep this on your person at all times. That way, if you are confronted with an anxious situation, you’ll have something to do.”
I’m still alive!!! So sorry guys, things with the COVID escalated fast. Now I’m safely at home from college and hope to finish this fic in the next few weeks. Not sure what’ll happen after that! Comments are always appreciated. I hope everyone is safe.
Draco nodded and went to the restroom to freshen up for bed. He felt lighter than he had in a long time, and he hadn’t even drunk that much Firewhisky
“They’re taking a recess, I’m not sure if you heard.” Harry started rubbing at his forehead, and Draco noticed his hand was shaking.
An enemy finds out that Harry and Draco are officially dating, and Draco heads home for the weekend.
He tried to pay attention to Professor Slughorn’s writing but the room started to sway, the chalkboard blurring together in a mess of white. Draco wondered if that liquid really was some sort of poison. He should tell Potter, he needed to see Madame Pomfrey. His chest didn’t feel right either and was tightening with each breath.
. I just mean not now. You’ve been really sick, I—I want to wait until you really want to do something like this.”
“How the—how the hell are you searching my mail?” Draco can’t imagine what would have to be involved to stop each and every owl that could possibly be carrying something for him. And they couldn’t have opened everything—what about the poisonous letter?
When Draco woke up the next morning, Potter was already gone. Draco reached his hand out and felt the part of the bed where Potter had slept—it was still warm. He was horrified with himself, not only for his various gross displays of emotions yesterday, but for allowing Potter to sleep next to him. Potter must think him such a child, so immature. Though he was alone in the room, Draco’s face glowed bright red with embarrassment.
“Um, don’t you have the entire Transfiguration essay to finish? You stay, I won’t be long.” At least, Draco hoped he wouldn’t be long.
Draco blinked and realized that the man sitting before him was full of wonder and mystery, and he couldn’t wait to learn everything about him. “Thank Merlin I never made you so angry that you turned me into a balloon...” Draco marveled as the two sat down, with their identities blissfully mundane, at the restaurant. A candle was lit between them, and they were handed wine menus.
“The conversation stays in the notebook though, so it isn’t dark magic. I’m honestly surprised that no one has thought of it sooner. This way, we’ll be able to stay in touch while you’re gone. There are a few limitations though—you can only write up to two sentences at a time before the other person has to respond in turn. But it’s faster than sending letters.”
“Yeah. Andromeda raises Teddy for now, but I’d like to have a big role in raising him. After all, it’s sort of my fault that he ended up orphaned like me.” Draco noticed that Harry tried to say the last part nonchalantly, but his eyes glazed over a bit.
He closed the door to the eighth year dormitory behind him and immediately ran into someone. “Watch it,” he growled, before realizing it was Harry Potter. “Oh, I’m sorry. I thought it was a stupid first year.”
Everything was fine when he was the one walking down the hallway, able to open and close doors at will. Problems only arose when someone else tried to get in. And with Potter as a roommate, even the past twenty-four hours, Draco felt like Harry was flinging open doors left and right without a care in the world. Draco wasn’t sure how much longer he could pick up the spilled contents and put them back without one or two emotions or memories escaping for good.
“No, of course not!” Daphne said, and Blaise and Greg nodded in agreement. “Sure, it wouldn’t have been our first guess or our first choice for you, but it’s like Blaise said. We want to see you happy. We like the Draco sitting across from us right now a lot more than we liked the sulking one from the past two years.”
“It’s good that you’re awake, but you need to sleep, alright?” Harry said. “You’re going to be fine, you just need to sleep.”
Kingsley nodded thoughtfully when Draco was finished. “I appreciate your honesty. The Aurors and myself have decided that your parents will not return to Azkaban, so long as they continue to cooperate with the Ministry. However, the wards will remain on your home for at least five years, and your parents will be on house arrest for an additional year.” Draco nodded—that seemed fair, and he didn’t want to push his luck. “In the meantime, if you hear from young Theo Nott again, you will be required to turn the letter in to the Ministry.”
“Now, which arm was the cut on?” Draco lifted up his right sleeve, very grateful that his left arm wasn’t attacked. The light imprint of the skull and snake still stood out to him everytime he took a shower, and so even in the summer he preferred long sleeves. “Ms. Granger healed this, yes?” Draco nodded. “She did a decent job, but you will have a small scar. It doesn’t look to be infected, so that’s good.”
Ginny bit her lip, and Dean stepped forward, placing a hand on her arm. “You need to stay away from Potter,” he said, using Harry’s last name despite them being in the same house.
After a few moments of this and of sipping on some water that Harry conjured, Draco felt he could speak again. “My mother is...fine, I guess. As well as she can be. My father, though...” And through sobs, Draco told Harry every awful thing that his father said to him. He told Harry how paranoid his father looked, how Lucius looked at him like he was an abomination.
“It’s—it’s not always that simple.” Draco swallowed thickly. “When I was dragged into...everything, I didn’t want to be involved. But I never would have turned myself in. Or my family.”
“Dumbledore’s Army...” Draco mused in his old sarcastic tone. He shifted uncomfortably in the chair, sort of wondering why they didn’t bother to tie him up.
Once he was gone, Draco was left standing outside his new bedroom. He put his hand on the doorknob, trying to work up the courage to go in. He had been under the assumption that he would be rooming with the other eighth-year Slytherins. That wasn’t such a big deal—they already heard him cry in his sleep for the past two years, and they were either kind or embarrassed enough not to say anything to him about it. But Potter—first he saw Draco’s...fit on the train, now this? Draco couldn’t even use a Silencing charm with the damned manacle on his wrist.
died. Part of me, anyway. Voldemort did cast the Killing Curse on me, and I went to this weird, afterlife train station. Dumbledore was there, and so was Tom Riddle. But he was—absolutely inhuman. That was his fate, that’s where he is now. In pain for the rest of eternity.”
Surprisingly, Draco decided to tell his friends about what would be happening on Saturday. There were only two options—they would be okay with it, or they wouldn’t. If it didn’t bother them, great. If it did, that would be alright too, and Draco would simply walk further down the path of distancing himself from the other Slytherins. He literally had nothing to lose, and had grown tired of sneaking around over the past year.
“Oh yeah. Pansy, Vince, Greg, Blaise, Theo, all the other kids in my lessons, we’d all get together on a snowy day and have a snowball fight. We had to do it out of sight of our parents though, they found it quite unbecoming. How about you?”
I feel like this second part of the series has been relatively angst-free. So here’s some angst! Not too much longer left in this book. Now we’ll get to holiday stuff, which will include fluff and a whole lot of angst.
“I’m not sure you ever get cured,” Harry sighed. “I think you just go into remission, you know? Get better.”
How is this piece already halfway over? We still need to see everyone’s family. What do you think Draco’s plan is? What should the DA do? Will we ever find out who sent Draco the Time Turner?
Also a note about scheduling: this weekend is my anniversary with my boyfriend, so I likely won’t have a chapter out until Sunday or even Monday. After that, I’ll be going on vacation for Thanksgiving, so chapters may not be as regular for that week. Then we’ll get back on track though!
Harry looked at him for a moment more and stood to finish putting on his robes. “I think you had a panic attack. You should see Madame Pomfrey when you get a chance.”
“I just don’t know which I’d want to do. How would I? I’ve never been with anyone,” Harry said, stressed. “I mean, do you know which you’d want?”
Thanks to Harry’s presence, Draco was able to get a decent amount of sleep that night. Harry gently pushed him awake bright and early the next morning, and they both got ready in silence. Hermione was already brewing tea when they entered the common room.
“Two things: first, I have a note from Professor McGonagall for you.” Draco’s eyes narrowed as he took the note. He cast it aside, having a sinking feeling he knew what it was about. “Second, I was wondering if you could help me with the Potions homework sometime this weekend.”
“I’m going to finish some paperwork and prepare for Lucius’s trial this afternoon. I will likely see you this evening at your residence.” Mr. Burke stood and took his leave.
Draco shifted uncomfortably in his chair as happy chatter settled around him. Diagonally from Draco, Gregory seemed to be having a similar problem, and again Draco noticed his thin frame. Daphne put some food on Gregory’s plate and smiled encouragingly. Gregory managed a small smile back before putting a shaking hand on his fork. The beginning part of the feast passed quietly as the four Slytherins tried to focus on keeping their panic at bay.
“I...I’m just thinking about my poor mum in there, you know? She’s been through so much. Now I don’t even know when I’ll get to talk to her again.” Draco’s eyes burned.
Draco sighed. “I’ll tell them when I get home, I suppose. Who knows what’s going to happen with my father now that the Time Turner was found. I doubt he’ll get sent back to Azkaban unless they can prove that somehow he was the one who sent it to me at Hogwarts, which makes no sense.” Draco was already feeling dizzy, and trying to figure out this puzzle only made things worse. Who sent him the Time Turner, and why?
Draco was somewhat hoping that Harry would share his bed that evening, since the date had gone objectively well. However, after planting a small kiss on Draco’s cheek, Harry crushed that particular dream. “I really want to take this slow,” he said. “Because I think it could be something special. All my relationships burned really brightly and then died out immediately. I don’t want that to happen with us. Is that okay?”
“Because of the new wards,” Hermione said. “They can detect any invisibility spells, and they say they can see through all invisibility cloaks,” she stole a glance at Harry. Draco wasn’t sure if the others knew that he had one. “I’m not sure how true that is, but if it is true and Draco is caught trying to sneak into the Ministry blatantly using invisibility, it won’t end well for him.”
“Do you have to make so much noise?” He should know better than to assume he would be alone in the night, but Granger startled him anyway.
project, it’s just my idea. Second, I don’t think we should leave him out. From what Ginny was able to tell me, he was an integral part of...the operations here. At the time.” Draco knew what Hermione meant. He was in charge of organizing seventh years to help the Carrows with detentions and other punishments. To be quite honest, Vincent was the only one eager to take part in the task. He loved to talk about who cried the most, and who was trying to be brave at first and then crumbled once put under the Cruciatus. He loved to use the Imperius curse in the hallways to make first and second years do stupid things that sometimes endangered themselves. His main goal upon graduation was to become a Death Eater.
“That sounds good, I need to work on some homework anyway. I’m going to go get breakfast with Hermione and Neville, do you want to come?”
“What do you want, Potter?” It was true that Draco and Harry had talked quite a bit over the past few days, but only in their bedroom. Outside of their shared quarters, Draco attempted to keep up the same malice he always had over the years. It was the one thing that could stay the same. But Potter refused to participate—he just ignored insults.
Most of the letters were thankfully nonsense, and all the four Slytherins thumbed through them once Blaise had returned after destroying the Howlers in the bathroom. Draco opened the second to last letter and a disgusting black liquid immediately oozed onto his hands. “Ugh!” he cried, and Blaise immediately vanished the liquid for him.
“Because Draco was right when he said it would be a good chance to get some fresh air,” Daphne said. “And interact with the others. As we’ve all seen, the amount of forced harmony this year is only going to increase.”
Harry smiled at him with patience. “You’re so cute. But look at all this work we have to do! Twenty four inches for Potions, nearly double that for Transfiguration, and only a few days left. We really should get to work.”
Draco leaned back, determined not to fall asleep despite his exhaustion—this conversation probably matched how much he had spoken this entire summer. Maybe half an hour passed with Draco just staring out the window, his mind blissfully blank, before there was a knock on the compartment door. Draco and Harry turned to look at the door, but neither moved. The curtain blocked their view of who was on the other side.
“I—I dream about him a lot, too. That’s actually why I’m up,” Draco decided to admit. He assumed Greg was thinking about Vincent given his intense focus on the fire.
“Dragon, it’s okay. I’ll see you soon. I love you.” Yarney didn’t say a word as Narcissa took one final glance at her son before the door was shut and Draco was locked in once again.
“Yeah,” Draco said truthfully. “Honestly? I’m happy the weight of the secret is off my shoulders. At least it’s all out in the open.”
As he exited his room, which Harry had left about an hour before Draco woke up, his mind was swimming with all the things he had to do. He would only be attending half of his classes today before meeting with Mr. Burke, but he also had to get his school work in anticipation of tomorrow, and maybe for longer after that if the Wizengamot couldn’t reach a decision. That’s the reason he had given Daphne, Blaise, and Greg for missing breakfast, but in truth he didn’t feel like he could stomach anything. He felt so heavy already, he didn’t want any food sitting in his stomach and weighing him down.
Draco wanted to mock Potter for telling such a ridiculous story, but the young man sitting beside him was so vulnerable, and so sincere. So instead, Draco nodded and looked at his feet. “That’s good to know. That he’s not going to come back.”
“Yes, Professor,” Draco said somewhat sheepishly. It really hadn’t been all that bad—he felt slightly embarrassed now for making such a fuss earlier.
“Well, yeah, we were close friends. Our parents were in the middle of deciding on a betrothal contract. But that doesn’t mean we were together.”
“He may look all tough on the outside, but his emotions run deep. Especially this upgraded version.” Blaise and Greg nodded along with her.
Draco couldn’t believe that his day was going to end as it begun—by him getting thrown out of the Three Broomsticks. “But...I don’t think...”
It was at that unfortunate moment that Zacharias Smith saw this exchange. “Well,” he said, smirking. “What do we have here? Not only does Harry Potter like it up the arse, but he likes Death Eaters?”
“Searched? Why?” Draco tried to keep his tone polite, but anger bubbled beneath the surface. His family home had been searched dozens of times over the past few months, and he knew how anxious it made Mother to have uninvited guests.
Draco smiled as he let the memory wash over him. “When I was seven, I woke up to the smell of cinnamon rolls that Dobby had made. I ran downstairs, and there were mounds and mounds of presents under the tree. My parents were up and snuggling on the couch. I got everything I wanted that year, but that wasn’t even the best part. It was snowing just the right amount, and it wasn’t too cold. My friends came over and we all went sledding together and had a big snowball fight. It must have been hours before we came inside shivering in our wet clothes, but my mother had hot chocolate ready for us all. Then all the families gathered to the Manor, not for a formal gala or anything, but just to have dinner together and spend time chatting. After dinner, my friends and I all fell asleep on the couch. My mother still has the picture of us sprawled next to each other. My father carried me to bed and tucked me in once everyone else had left. I think he thought I was sleeping, so he whispered that he loved me, which was rare for him.” As he told the story, Draco had somewhat lost track of where he was and who he was with. He blushed as he met Potter’s beaming face.
“The Ministry thinks they’re hiding something. Maybe they are hiding something, I don’t even know. I don’t even know my own family well enough to tell you, Potter, because my whole life I believed that my parents would protect me and keep me safe and how well did that work out? I believed my father when he said he would take care of my mother, and how well did that work out? None of it did, and none of it ever will. Sometimes I don’t even know why I’m fucking here at this school, following my probation. I’m never going to have a job, or a family, because I’ll always just be a reformed Death Eater
Harry ignored his quip. “Here, we’re both going to get under this. I hope your shoes are good, we’ve got a long walk ahead of us. Move closer to me.”
“Bathroom,” he mumbled, though neither Hermione nor Neville were really listening. Draco made for the restroom but took the back exit, and walked around the building to find Potter sitting on a bench, shivering a little. The village was strangely quiet—not a soul in sight even on a gorgeous autumn day.
Finally they came upon a little village Draco knew as Godric’s Hollow. Draco suddenly felt enormously stupid.
“It’s also rude to leave your guest alone at a table with people that don’t like him.” Draco said this in a sarcastic tone, but Potter looked sharply at him with guilt in his eyes.
“I just would hate knowing you felt guilty over it. I need you to know that I’m not angry at you in the slightest.”
Draco shifted so that he could lay down. He knew that he wouldn’t be able to stay awake all night and was ready to admit defeat. As per usual. So he did the next best thing he knew how to do.
“I’ll explain it to you some other time. Oh, also,” Harry walked over to his side of the room. “I do have this.” He rummaged through his trunk and held out Draco’s old wand. “I should have given it to you sometime this summer, I’m sorry.”
The rest of the meal passed in silence. Draco focused on closing his mind and feeling nothing, channeling his intense focus from his Occlumency lessons with Professor Snape and his aunt. When a knock sounded at the door, no Malfoy moved to answer it, but Draco put down his half-eaten toast and looked toward the doorway. A wave of nausea and anxiety rushed over him.
“Potter, you cannot tell anyone what happened. I’m serious.” Draco’s tone wasn’t so much angry, but pleading.
! Now Draco was regretting that he didn’t prepare a little better. But Narcissa wasted no time. “How are you my darling? You look thin.”
“Did Dumbledore know about this?” Draco asked one day after Harry showed him a memory of spending one of his earlier birthdays ill with pneumonia and not taken care of.
Harry shook his head. He looked nearly as pale as Draco always did, the brave young man clearly afraid.
Bill and Fleur had clearly also been told about Draco, because they just gave him friendly nods as well. Ginny immediately stood up. “Okay, we’ve got me, Harry, Malfoy, George, Ron, and Bill. We can play three on three.”
“I will,” Draco said, and he truly meant it. “You as well, Pot—Harry,” he said, correcting himself last minute from using Harry’s last name. “This isn’t going to be a one-sided friendship, not on my watch. I’m here for you anytime, anywhere.”
Kingsley did not waste any time with pleasantries, which Draco respected. He simply asked Draco to repeat everything he knew about the lost and newly returned Time Turner. Draco, remembering his conversation with Harry earlier about honesty, decided to come clean and tell Kingsley about the letter he had received and burned from Theo.
“Additional resources will be available throughout the year to help all students readjust to a peaceful school environment. But for now, enough chitter-chatter. Let us celebrate Hogwarts in the most traditional way—by welcoming our new first years into one of our four equally prestigious Hogwarts houses.”
Truthfully, seeing Mind Healer Christine was starting to get more and more difficult. Draco had delved into some of the less horrifying events of the past year—generally what it was like to have the Dark Lord in his house, what it was like at Hogwarts, etc. However, they were running out of easy material. Christine had pushed him more and more each session to be further in touch with his emotions and trauma, but Draco wasn’t sure he was ready. Draco explained this to Harry, who listened compassionately.
“Well, well,” a familiar voice drawled when he entered. “An unscheduled meeting, isn’t this? I’m surprised. Perhaps it has something to do with the latest rumor spreading across the school?” Draco reddened at the hint that Professor Snape knew he was dating Harry Potter.
“Alright everyone,” Hermione turned to face the small crowd. “We’re rooming in pairs. Two pairs share a bathroom. Due to the new House Elf Liberation program, we’re going to have to clean up after ourselves a bit more; we only get cleanings every week.” Blaise rolled his eyes. Draco couldn’t find it in himself to care—he liked to be tidy as it was. “Your names are on your doors. Have a good night everyone, Neville and I will see you tomorrow morning for our first briefing.”
That wasn’t what Draco was concerned about. He spat one more time and then spun to grab Potter’s arm. “Potter, my...my arm burned. Something’s wrong, I think—“
Granger looked down. “I’m up a lot at night because of nightmares. What happened at your house included...”
I’m so glad you guys like this second installment so far! I’m not sure yet how long it’s going to be, so I’m leaving the number of chapters as a ? for now. You can expect updates every few days, I’m going to try and do every 3 days but it may vary as the new semester starts. I’m super excited to read all of your comments, so please keep them coming! :)
. “I wasn’t trying to cover anything up, I genuinely forgot!” Draco raised his voice subconsciously, even though he knew he looked extremely defensive.
“How can you possibly know that?” Lucius had always been somewhat condescending toward Narcissa, who had proved herself far more capable at tasks requiring skills such as Occlumency than Lucius.
This chapter ends Harry and Draco’s adventures at Hogwarts, for now at least! The next three chapters will take place over the holiday break. Thank you all for continuing to support me, and most importantly, I hope you are all safe. Much love to everyone, and as always, comments are appreciated.
“Kind of convenient, innit? That you just forgot about that part.” Yarney was dropping his professional tone.
“Come in,” a friendly voice said when he knocked on the door. He slowly entered the office, and he cursed himself for not mentally preparing a little better. Professor Dumbledore and Professor Snape’s portraits stared down at him from behind McGonagall’s desk. Both wore a friendly, almost fond expression, but Draco couldn’t meet their eyes. “Hello, Mr. Malfoy. Please, take a seat.” Draco sat down, looking at his hands. “How are you doing?”
. I know he didn’t like your father. He was an odd one, but I miss him.” Harry looked wistfully at the walls.
A burst of cold air blew in as the door opened, making Draco shiver both with chill and with the memory of the past night. “Yer leaving?” Hagrid said as he came in carrying a watering can.
. “I’m Auror Yarney, by the way. I just finished my training and was hired last week as a junior Auror. I have been assigned to assist with your family case as well as other reformed Death Eaters. I imagine we’ll be meeting again after this.”
. While Yarney was making sure Narcissa’s chains were secured, Draco took the time to truly look at his mother. She had certainly lost weight, but didn’t look skeletal. Her face was the palest Draco had ever seen it, and she had dark circles under her eyes. However, Draco could still see the same spark in her as he had always been able to, even if that spark was dimmer now. He felt intense relief to actually see her and know that she was still alright.
Even Draco’s parents were traumatized enough that they no longer ate in the dining room. They purchased a small table for the three of them and put it right next to the kitchen. Draco sat down, being careful to not make a sound. He sat up straight, as a Malfoy should.
“Damn it Malfoy! I'm trying to be nice, can't you just take the apology and leave it?” Harry inquires bamboozled. Sensing the other boy's affliction, Malfoy brings himself down a peg.
“I'm not talking about this with you right now.” Draco spins and walks a few feet in front of Harry.
“Anyway, I brought up the fact he's hated me since school started, and he goes ‘I wanted your attention.’.” Harry mocks in an unflattering voice, “so obviously when he tries telling me I just need to touch him, I list all the things he's done, then ask why I would want to touch him, so it's safe to say he got the point when I knocked him back after he tried grabbin me.” Harry and Ron share a triumphant type smile.
“Doesn't matter! That was the reasoning. Someone who pulls stunts like that, for a reason so dumb, can't possibly completely change .”
“Of course not Harry! I can't believe you'd think he'd try cursing you, especially since you've saved each other's lives! He probably just wants to apologize.” She looks frazzled, shaking her head at Harry and Ron.
“Ow Harry! Just because you're heated doesn't mean I'll allow you to use me as your ottoman!” She squawks. Harry pulls into himself, embarrassed and feeling guilty.
“I-I just thought, that if uh, I give you this now you won't get another headache for a while. So at least it won't be doubled?” Harry's tone rises and he takes a step back. Dracos still looks at him from over his shoulder as he exclaims.
“‘Draco! You haven't visited me in so long, I-” She starts, but decides against complaining when she sees his face. “Are you alright, Dragonfly?” She asks pouting and floats beside him as he heads to sit on the lone step to the toilets.
“What the-'' The bags under Malfoy's eyes are oh so gradually fading. Curious, he takes his unoccupied hand and rubs Malfoys cheekbone. the bag under his right eye dims twice as fast and Harry's face lights up. A dull snore can be heard coming from Malfoy and he takes that as a win. Even more eager now to help, Harry drags his thumb down the crease between Malfoys brows and the blonde's slight pout turns to a subtler smile. Little does Harry know Dracos having the best dream he’s ever had in his life. A dream of calloused hands and warm skin. He knows for once he won't awake with an ache and wants to scream his gratitude at whoever could be accomplishing this.
“Whatever. You'll need to tell him.” Draco nods and pulls out a piece of paper. He writes a quick message, then walks outside of the Great Hall a few seconds after Harry and his friends. Walking opposite directions, Draco points his wand at the bird-shaped paper and whispers “Locomotor”. He takes a quick glance behind so he knows where to fly the thing. He commands it to do a few flips as it flies in front of Harry and then turns the corner, heading for Herbology.
“You're totally missing the point! Were supposed to be together for the rest of our lives. That's why mates exist, so people get happily ever afters. Sure, this can start out platonic, we can be ‘cuddle buddies’,” Malfoy quotes with his fingers. “But eventually that won't be enough.” He finishes.
“Draco, honey? You do know that it's been three days since Potter decided to help you, right?” Pansy points out as she slides next to him on his bed. He shifts his focus from the feathers on the floor to his friends face and answers.
Draco pinches his wrist to keep his eyes open as he walks through the door to the DADA classroom. Immediately he searches for Pansy and drags his feet her way when he finds her. The desks are pushed against the walls, curtains left open letting light far too bright inside and the professor stands straight in the front of the room.
“Tell me what happened Harry.” She says while pulling Harry's head onto her shoulder and wraps her arm around him. Harry's hair frizzes again as he talks.
Harry stalks out from behind the pillar and makes his way to Malfoy. Myrtle lets out an exaggerative gasp, face contorting into resentment.
“Be quiet Ron. You know i must do my very best to aid Harry in this unexpected predicament.” Her eyes scrunch and he gets to work sorting through the piles right away.
“I'm not saying to forgive him Harry. I'm saying you could've acted more your age, maybe tried to listen to everything. I doubt that's all he had to say! Judging by your appearance when you came in here, you definitely overreacted. Now, I'm off to the library. I've got Veelas to research.” Hermione says, walking out of the common room without looking back.
“The one time I rush into things and act like a Gryffindor, everything immediately falls apart.” He says laughing, wiping away a tear. “I guess doing that only works out for Harry.”
“That's hardly fair Potter!” Harry hears a break, and half of his vision is obscured with cracked glass.
“Draco, you know in order for me to help you I need to know who it is?” She raises her brow, seeming to feel his discomfort surrounding this mysterious person. He lets out a puff of air, preparing himself. He knows his mother loves him, but even he felt disappointed in himself when he found out who his mate was.
“Are you ok?” Harry throws a look over his shoulder as the professor watches them with concern. Considering Malfoy isn't complaining too much and there's no blood, he only shakes his head and the Professor , hesitant, goes to help another student. After all, what could go wrong when the boy who lived is watching over him.
“Exactly what it sounds like, you twat. Being a Veela's mate is basically like a Muggles equivalent to a soulmate. Which i hope isn't surprising to you, considering they both have ‘mate’ in them.” Malfoy states, studying Harry. Harry lets out an ‘Oh’, his hair curling in on itself, making it look tight. If you could even call hair tight. Harry's brain appears to be going 1,000 miles a minute because questions instantly fill his mind. Why would they be soulmates? How could they possibly give each other happily ever afters? Is he gonna have to snog another bloke? Does this mean he'll never be able to get another girlfriend? What if- Said boy backtracks a second, trying to figure things out, and drops his interest on another thing the blonde said.
for Draco to deflect. Everything seems fine. If Draco flinches a little bit harder every time Harrys jinx hits his shield, he doesn't notice and if Dracos forehead gets just
“What’re you doing Potter?” Harry jumps Pulling his hands into himself. “People are staring you know.” Out of his stupor, he observes his classmates. Noticing that, indeed, a good majority of them are staring. Turning to the person who spoke, he sees Pansy, with a smirk on her face and her hands on her hips looking down at him.
“Promises are for children who do not trust the people they confide in.” She gives her son an exasperated look, ready to help him already.
“No, Um go ahead.” He shuffles out of the way and makes eye contact with Ron as soon as he’s up. By Ron's face he can already tell he’s in line for an interesting conversation and as the class is dismissed and as Ron takes his arm pulling him from the room, he is not as excited as he was a couple minutes ago.
“You wanted to be my partner?” He rolls back and forth on his toes with his hands behind him. He noticed the bags under Malfoy's eyes and the droop to his posture the second he got close.
“I know that if I don't discourage you too, both of you will run with the idea that he's plotting. Don't look at me like that Ron! It's happened before.” they walk again. Harry falls back slightly as Hermione takes Ron's hand and kisses his forehead, lifting the pout from his lips. Harry frowns a bit and shakes his head, disappointed in himself. He's elated for them, but he can't help wanting someone to love him too. Hermione looks back at Harry to ask him a question.
“Ever since the show you put on, I've been having immensely painful headaches,” Malfoy leaves out the nightmare part of his affair, not willing to seem vulnerable.” My Veela side is having a laborious time coming to terms with our animosity. Part of having a mate means spending time with them and having regular touches. So, I'm not asking you to submit yourself to a life of obedience. I just need you to hangout with me every so often. Kapeesh?” So basically, the stuff you normally do with someone you've fallen in love with, Draco thinks sourly. There's silence. The two men stare at each other, unaware of what to do.
“Yes!” Ron yells into the silence “There's a passage about Veelas in this one!” he pushes the book forward, standing up in record time.
“Yes Pans, I know that.” His eyes droop and his head lulls as he speaks to her, but even in such a state irritation still easily drips from his voice. She smoothes out the wrinkles in his pajama pants that lays on his thigh and sighs.
“You're telling me, Your highly graceful mother, wants you to just outright tell him. No tact whatsoever!” Draco shushes her, swiftly reminding his best friend that there are many people around that could be listening. She frowns, not liking the forced silence.
“I need to go. My headache is making being calm out of the question.” He takes a big inhale as he heads for the door. Harry's eyes widen at his openness.
“Get dressed. Breakfast is ending soon, Your day’s going to be rough.” She smiles and pats him on the cheek before leaving.
“You have something else to say.” Harry looks at Draco thoughtfully. When Draco has the chance, he keeps going. He never just leaves it at that. Draco huffs, he closes his eyes wanting to pretend he wasn't here. He can't though, he's a Malfoy and Malfoys aren't cowards. Draco snaps his eyes open and starts.
“Jeez. You don't have to be so rude about it.” Malfoy raises an eyebrow and Harry stops. He looks so good when he does that, Harry thinks quickly.
It's been a few days since Draco talked to Harry. After being jinxed, he tried going about his life like before - lonely, full of homework, and miserable. Except he quickly realized it was hard to act normal when somehow life got harder. Instead of having nice fluffy dreams that left him meditative -  he has nightmares that leave him shaken to his core. The dreams used to be the same thing every time that made him feel good, now they differ every night- leaving him with another thing to drop on top of his tower of troubles. Harry leaving him to the flames that took Crabbe, Harry putting the whole of the school against him, Harry telling everyone what happened and how pathetic he must have looked, but worst of all the nightmares where he was the one that caused fear.
“I mean he did say I didn't have to forgive him at all-” Harry says, tone implying a but was coming.
He surveys Malfoy as he sullenly opens the doors to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. He waits for a minute. Following Malfoy into the bathroom might not be a good idea. I mean, that is where
“Are you now? I thought you didn't want to help me.”  Malfoy goes to pull away, but Harry's hold tightens. Harry hooks his chin down onto the place between his shoulder and neck, discouraging Malfoy from moving backwards. Malfoy looks down at the shorter boy, only succeeding in sticking his face in the others' unruly hair. Malfoy exhales harshly out of his nose to blow it away.
His most recent nightmare had been Draco revealing Harry at the manor. Draco had laughed and turned to his aunt, pointing out the fact he didn't think Harry could get any uglier. His aunt had dragged Harry to Voldemort and cackled as he threw him around, taunting. Draco just stood there. Giggling while Harry cried and sputtered, and then there was a bright green light. He'd woken up particularly shaken. He could handle Harry screwing him over or hating him. Never the other way around. Coupled with the new nightmares, he now dons a permanent headache that potions can't taper.
“Fine. If you don't want to talk about it, I won't make you, but I will force you to see him. You know he won't stay silent forever. Whether out of curiosity or concern, i do not know, but he will speak.”
“Well, even if she lied, wouldn’t this be the perfect time to help you?” He asks, proud of himself for bringing up the topic that had been plaguing his mind for days.
Towards the middle of the library lies a table. Invaded by piles upon piles of books. Some of which have not been disturbed in decades, immaculate layers of dust finally tore through by fingerprints. Passing students surprised by the sight of it all. A certain ginger surely wishing for death, watches as his girlfriend returns with more.
“Stop jesting, i'm not in the mood.” He stops to sit his stuff down. “You Protego this time.” When she doesn't draw her wand though Draco groans. She really is going to be a pain in the arse today huh? Before he can protest she sauntars over to Harry and grabs his hand. He can't hear what they’re saying from his spot but when they both make their way over to him he can assume what was said. Pansy drops Harry off and doesn't remain any longer to negotiate, leaving to find her own partner. They stand in silence until Harry speaks.
“It’s still rather improbable,” says Luna, shaking her head. “And you can’t just go up to any old dragon to ask for favours. That’s just silly.”
The usual back-to-school buzz seems muted this year. Understandable, Draco thinks, considering the circumstances. They all whisper to each other, eyes darting around and smiles strained.
mouth, on the reflection droops, lips pulling impossibly low like it is melting off his face. Blood drips from the ends like candlewax onto the basin.
But him being there helps. Lots of witnesses are more willing to speak up when they see him in the front row, a reminder that their tormentors are not as untouchable as they had seemed.
Hi! Yes, I am alive, largely unscathed. Sorry for the long hiatus. Lockdown has me struggling, but here's a present in honour of our favourite snake! Happy belated birthday to Draco!
Blaise, nonchalant as ever, flips a page of his magazine. “Little Antonius told you he has big dreams, did he?”
But it’s warm, like it had sat in the summer sun for a full afternoon, and it… hums. Not that Harry hears anything coming from the stone, but when he traces a finger over the smooth surface, he can feel a faint thrum if he concentrates hard.
An awkward cough and a resigned sigh. Then Harry feels Ron join the embrace from his side. “Just stay safe, mate. Any trouble and you write us, hear? We’ll come straight back, even if I have to drag ‘mione away from a library.”
Samhain. He might’ve been… jostled loose for a little bit.” Though even as he said it, Harry sees how Malfoy bites his lip a little, as if he wasn’t entirely convinced of his own reasoning.
Draco’s father is nothing if not a quintessential Malfoy. Having been pardoned on a technicality, he managed to gain a foothold in the ministry in less than five years through subtle manipulation of his connections.
Hello friends! This chapter took a little longer to come out, so I hope you're appeased by a slightly longer chapter this time. I'm so glad you liked Anton, the precious bean! He's a returning character don't worry.
Draco slumps back into his compartment after dropping Anton with a few other first years. When he had left, the boy had already been making fast friends with what looked like a Selwyn, bonding over their identical jumpers, of all things.
“The ones at the Samhain ritual all left by about five? Five-thirty? Most of ‘em stayed around their common rooms if they’re conscious, though Goldstein’s up and about. Bones ‘s still in bed, last I heard.”
But Anton wouldn’t know the difference. Draco glances down at him. Safely on the train, Anton looks nervous, fingers knotting into the wool of his jumper. Normally, Draco would wait for him to initiate before addressing the situation, but Theo had warned him about his little brother’s anxiety attacks and how he works himself into a state if left alone to spiral.
Draco’s eyes narrow at how Potter’s hand twitches at his side and- oh, look at that. He brought his wand along this time.
But then Draco thinks of Anton curled up in Blaise’s lap, of Theo’s glazed eyes on Azkaban visits. He thinks of Julian and the way his face turns blank as soon as he steps out of the common room, and the other first years. Andrea with her permanent scowl. Chloe with her huge, brown eyes that dart around whenever there’s a loud noise.
He watches and listens as a great howling echoes through the air and as the darkness of the lake swallows the light spilled by the Great Hunt.
Draco pauses and takes a deep breath. The tip of his quill hovers over the parchment as he bites down on his lip.
And as confident as he had looked in that courtroom, Harry thinks that no one would want to go back to living with dementors after escaping once.
Potter’ shoulders straighten, something shifting in his eyes. Draco thinks idly that this is probably what he’d look like on the battlefield, all fire and focus. “What do you want from me, Malfoy?” His voice is cold, controlled.
“Most of them transferred to Durmstrang or Beauxbatons,” explains Neville. “Their reputations aren’t as good as Hogwarts' academically, but I’ll bet anything the atmosphere’s a whole lot friendlier.”
The only thing he recognises is the look in his eyes, the same barely contained fury and something all consuming that’s been there since they were both kids. He’d never been able to put a name to it, but that’s what he remembers best when he thinks of Malfoy, what he tries to describe to people who hadn’t met him. He’d never quite gotten it across, though Harry remembers the expression Sirius had when he tried to find the words.
He blinks, slow, sleepy, wanting nothing more than to close his eyes and sink into the water. To follow the whispers home.
(Later, after Harry washes the stone and carefully tiptoes around his sleeping roommates, he stares up at the bed canopy and says, with feeling, “Luna. And Malfoy.
Harry remembers being in the front row of Draco Malfoy’s trial. The prosecutors had tried the Malfoys separately. “Lucius Malfoy is so slippery that he’ll get all of them out if they let him talk enough,” Kingsley had said. “This way he won’t be able to wiggle out of it.”
Robinson notices them looking and flashes an easy smile. “Here, Potter. Ham and mustard,” he says, tossing him a sandwich. “Tuna alright with you, Longbottom?”
“Oh, and Greengrass said she had something to show you too, but that it’ll wait until after you do your letters.”
, Harry thinks. The shortest one, a little boy trying so hard to look like he wasn’t vibrating out of his bones, barely came up to his elbow. Was he ever that tiny?
. But there’s really no denying it once Luna takes a turn down a spiralling staircase and into a dimly lit hallway that he vaguely remembers from second year. It looks a lot more run-down than before, but he recognises the stone wall they stop in front of and the stretch of the hallway that leads further down into the dungeons beyond.
Something in the tone of his voice drags a shiver down Harry’s spine, the way Robinson’s eyes turned steely where they were warm and amiable just a moment ago. He nods anyway. “I will, thanks.”
Still, they all felt their spines stiffen with tension as they landed on Platform 9 and ¾. They purposefully arrived a little late to avoid the biggest – and nerviest – crowds. It was safer that way.
. Thinking about Malfoy and Luna interacting in a friendly capacity had made him and the rest of their mutual friends’ heads hurt, so they’d simply ignored it, determined to get on with their own Malfoy-free lives.
Harry doesn’t really recognise them all, only vaguely remembering seeing their faces around the castle. Maybe one or two of them were at Quidditch tryouts?
Luna shakes her head. “He was looking scooped out on the train, but it got a little better. And then suddenly he was like this.”
“Thanks, Greg.” Draco salutes him with the sandwich before practically inhaling it. He spares a moment to kick Blaise’s sandwich under the bedframe surreptitiously. “How did everyone else fare this morning.”
He sighs, setting the parchment aside to mail later before bed. He supposes he could’ve gone with something a little less snide at the end there, but if his father wanted him to be more polite then he could write back and tell Draco off himself.
But Harry had watched as he was led in, no attorney to defend him, and as a long list of crimes was read out. Some of those charges were exaggerated, but none outright false. But in the post-war political climate it's unlikely that they won't stick, and the prosecution had looked like they knew it, with their shark-like grins.
She hovers there as a thousand voices join them, the smell of fresh earth and petrichor rich in the air. She holds out her hands, one to Draco, the other to Susan. They both close their eyes, reach into something that sits between atoms, just underneath the space around them, and
Harry sneers. “Fuck you too, Malfoy.” But Malfoy had already buried his head back under the pillows, holding his middle finger up at Harry while pulling his covers up from underneath Luna.
They all walk in together, robes billowing, and chins held high. Pansy tosses her hair, throwing the occasional disdainful look over her shoulder, and as usual, every eye was drawn to their entrance.
Potter snarls, looking like he wants nothing more than to lunge out of his chair and rip Draco’s hair out by the handful.
: Blaise, no, Blaise, listen. Why doesn't Potter think I'm scary? I need him to think I'm scary. I need him to feel things for me.
Luna gets up to help Malfoy with the covers, tucking him in with a smile. “Thank you, Draco. I’ll count it as a favour.”
“That should keep your soul from wandering around while you sleep. Just run it under clean water before you go to bed and keep it against your skin.” Malfoy lets out another yawn, flicking his hand at him. “Now fuck off and leave me alone.”
Malfoy seems like he’s keeping his cool though, wearing a neutral look on his face as he trades comments with Zabini under his breath. But Harry sees his eyes constantly moving, cataloguing exits, scanning over the first years being sorted, and occasionally meeting an acquaintance’s gaze and nodding. He claps politely, the gesture lazy, after every first year’s sorting.
He still avoids the bathroom mirrors though, ducking his head while he brushes his teeth. And if his hair looks a little more disheveled it's not like anyone really notices.
Robinson shrugs. “Got plenty. Oh, I think Lovegood was looking for you down by the kitchens. Don’t know where she is now though.”
He wonders if Hermione is eating wherever she is. She has the habit of forgetting when she’s caught up in something tricky, or losing her appetite entirely when she’s stressed. Ron could usually manage it well with reminders and homemade meals, and he knew that they would take care of each other, wherever they are today on their quest to find Hermione’s parents. But wherever they are isn’t
“Three months with the dementors is a hell of a lot more than a slap on the wrist,” says Harry, staring with distant eyes into the corridor.
Eventually, the crowd disperses, shouting promises to catch up later over their shoulders. The trolley-lady presses a few pumpkin pasties into his hand as she passes, thanking him with tears in her eyes. Harry’s glad that she moves on quickly, leaving Harry and a handful of friends in his claimed compartment. He hasn’t gotten any better at handling people thanking him for what happened over the summer.
He watched as Malfoy made eye contact with everyone in the front row, chin held high and expression unreadable. When the court asked him how he would like to plea, Harry remembers the look in Malfoy’s eyes as he had looked directly into his eyes and said,
So Draco automatically takes point position as they walk through the diminished crowd, his friends falling into place behind him. Blaise, the strongest caster, watches their flank with feigned casualness, eyes roving around the family groups as if bored. They arrange themselves around little eleven-year-old Antonius Nott, floating his bags along with theirs. He had insisted before they left that he was too big to hold their hands, but had still clutched a handful of Draco’s robes all the way to the platform.
Somehow, Zabini manages to look more intimidating here, petting the back of a sleeping child soothingly, than half the Death Eaters Harry had ever met.
Luna looks at him with her huge silvery eyes and places her cool hand on his cheek. She wears a look on her face that Harry realises is determination. Somehow, that look settles him. He lets his eyelids close when she brings rests her forehead against his.
Harry and his friends had claimed the slightly overstuffed set of armchairs at the back corner of the room from the first night, and for the most part, the other lions don’t bother them when they’re sitting there in an unspoken agreement to give them, Harry especially, some space.
“Luna?” he splutters, catching a glimpse of wet blond hair through his blurry eyes. “What-“ he chokes as he coughs up more water.
Hufflepuff and Slytherin relations had always been friendly. They two houses were too similar to not get along, really. But after the war reputations had taken a hit and inviting the other houses to take part in a Samhain ritual would go a long way to fix that, at least amongst the purebloods who knows what it means to stand in the same space and breathe in each other’s magic.
They all straighten their backs and arrange themselves quickly into a star, following the lines laid out on the dance floor beneath their feet. Draco relinquishes his hold on his partner as she pulls away to hobble to the centre.
He thinks of Pansy trembling in the dark, gripping his hand so tight he could hear his bones creak, of Greg, of
Out of all the strange things that have happened to Harry over his (really quite short, if you think about it) life so far, this night wouldn’t at first seem to rank in the top ten.
He fiddles with the stone in his pocket. That was another reason to not tell Ron and Hermione. If they hear that he’d had an encounter with Draco Malfoy and that he
Luna, fearless as always, bounces straight to the other boy to whisper lowly. “Is Draco still awake?”
The figure in the painting startles awake with a flurry of draped cloth. At least Harry thinks it’s supposed to be fabric. The painting is clearly not a masterpiece, the movement of the figure minimally depicted as stark, blurred lines. The colours bleed into each other, looking more like spilled paint than anything else. Harry wishes that he’d taken his glasses along on this adventure.
Harry doesn’t much like being a figurehead for justice. More and more, the ambiguous cases had him leaving the Ministry wanting to peel his skin off. The ones who were marked against their will. The ones who weren’t marked but did horrible things. The ones too young to know any better.
“A token of my favour, for your efforts,” she says, dropping the one made of holly on Draco’s head and the oak on Susan’s. “Until next year, children.”
He’s so busy having his crisis that he doesn’t hear Luna say the password, but the wall in front of them parts along seams he hadn’t noticed, leaving a stone archway.
He waves goodbye through the window as the train pulls out of the station, watching Ron and Hermione shrink into the distance.
Harry wakes up with the little holey stone clutched tight in one fist and the smell of rain in his nostrils. He doesn’t remember the dream he had been having, but it leaves him tense, jaw aching with how hard he’d gritted his teeth. He releases the breath he’d been subconsciously holding and feels his lungs ache with it as he blinks his crusty eyes open.
He can’t help but shiver. Her eyes at this distance are a void. He could feel them pull him in, urging him to take just one more half-step closer. To sleep. To fall.
I hope you liked this one too! The next chapter sees the plot actually progressing ahaha what even is planning. Thank you so much for all of your comments and I hope I hear from you again!
“Who’s he gonna bother? There’s no Voldemort anymore. He so much as sneezes wrong he’ll go right back, money or no.”
From there both Harry and Neville can see the whole space, having arranged the chairs so that they could cover each other’s blind-spots. When he sits down, he’s suddenly conscious of the textured surface of the upholstery, the faint ink stains on the arms.
The magic in the air is visible now, covering the whole area in wisps trailing a cold chill. Draco sees his breath fog in front of him and hears the music stutter for a moment. He was going to have to replace the strings of his violin. Samhain was always murder on them. But both Blaise and Susan compensate for the change in temperature and tone smoothly, the sound quickly rising and picking up speed.
Truly, at this moment Harry hates all his friends. “They think that there’s something wrong with my face,” he sighs.
His presence at them mostly serves as a token reminder of the war’s end, and the number he has to actually attend has been greatly reduced once Kingsley heard that he was returning to Hogwarts. It’s not like he can say he had witnessed much anyway, since he spent a fair chunk of the last year tripping over himself in the woods and avoiding places where there were people.
She hums. “And now you are eighteen summers old. Don’t you think boys your age should stop making a fuss about greens in their meals?”
He moves her through the next spin with extra vigour in apology, hearing her laugh as he draws her back towards him. The smell of moss intensifies as her black robes swirl around her ankles. When she is in his arms again, she is older, the freshness of childhood having left her face entirely. “You carry my heart when you go, my lady,” he says, and is rewarded with another laugh.
I did some minor but kinda important edits to the last chapter. Just added a handful of lines to the end bit. I wasn't really happy about it when I posted it the first time. The edit made me feel a bit better.
, is physically imposing enough that most people would think twice before causing trouble. Both Pansy and Blaise, though not as immediately threatening, have a look about them that has even the most daring criminals of Knockturn deeming them not worth the trouble despite their obvious wealth.
Oh, the blond one he knows. Garret Robinson. His little brother’s a Gryffindor too. Thomas, he thinks. Big for a twelve-year-old, with a habit of slouching to make himself look smaller. But his freckles made him look friendly unlike his older brother who’s built like a bear and does little to hide it.
Draco’s mother in some ways, is even better at it than Lucius. Narcissa kept the machinery of the Malfoy businesses working while Lucius greased the cogs. As a result, now sixty-eight percent of the businesses in Knockturn Alley, a good twenty-three percent of the ones in Diagon, and a solid
Malfoy’s mouth purses as he bites back what is sure to have been some choice insults, but he looks away with a hard exhale. “I won’t ask about what’s drawing you closer to the spirit world. I can guess, but it’s really none of my business.” He looks up to catch Harry’s eyes. “This is something you can fix. Do some grounding exercises, use your magic a little less over the next few days, and
Malfoy’s other hand gropes at his bedside table and plucks a leaf from an out-of-season Christmas wreath. He burns the leaf with a wordless spell and catches the ashes, smearing it all over what looks to Harry like a plain rock with a hole straight through the middle. He then holds it up for Luna.
But you don’t use wands at these sacred rituals. They predate wands. All the control work has to be done the traditional way, using their bodies and the movement of the stars.
Draco takes a moment to catch his breath, wiping the sweat off his brow. He scans the room for Anton, finding him helping his pink-haired friend to his feet.
He cuts himself off as a flash of blond hair passes the door to their compartment. They all glance to see what caught his attention and one by one, straighten in their seats.
Malfoy’s eyes cuts a glance at her slumped figure and sighs, drawing himself up. The look on his face this time as he inspects Harry again through the holey rock is the same as the one he wears in a hard Quidditch match, one where he has to outmanoeuvre and manipulate the other seeker to win the game.
“And he’s not likely to stop.” Zabini’s face softens, lips quirking up into a wry smile. “Stubborn little prince he is. Don’t keep him up too long. He’ll have a busy afternoon today.”
The afternoon light seems somehow muted as it streams through the tower window, the air smelling sharp and biting with the promise of a cold night. Harry slips the stone into a pocket, but can’t seem to help touching it occasionally between the little silences in his and Neville’s conversation. It’s warm on his fingertips, even after so long away from the press of his skin, like it somehow soaked up all the heat he radiated as he slept and stored it like a battery.
There are spells to reverse the damage, of course. But they make your entire skull thrum and vibrate for a solid week after. No one would willingly put themselves through that.
Someone, somewhere, starts playing their cello again and more and more instruments join in. All around him the revellers bow to their dead partners, some bidding them goodbye and others inviting them to dance once more. Draco honestly just wants to sleep for a year.
The air inside the compartment feels suddenly tense. Dean’s absence feels heavy, and Seamus looks like he’s suddenly remembering why. Neville’s eyes flick from him to the door, as if measuring the distance.
“The Dragon?” she says, voice curious. “My, my, he has everyone in the castle talking about him tonight. A promising young man, don’t you think so? Very talented.”
Also, if you noticed, I did put a chapter count up there. It's not definitive. I'm optimistic though that it won't reach 20 chapters ahahahaha *cries* this fic keeps getting longer.
Flecks of white appear suddenly in the woman’s eyes as they widen in interest. Maybe the artist trying to illustrate a ‘gleam’? Harry wishes whoever it was hadn’t bothered.
“But still less than he deserves,” Seamus bites out, fists clenched. “What he did- they only let him out ‘cos they need access to his money, not because he was innocent.”
speak French. Harry feels as if an entire chapter of his life has been a lie, and also completely confused as to why he would feel that way about Malfoy speaking French. Lots of posh people speak French. It shouldn’t surprise him to hear Malfoy speak a foreign language in general, but for some reason it does.
Too bad Harry had always only had one response to being intimidated. He straightens his spine and cocks his head to meet Zabini’s challenging gaze with his own.
He didn’t expect that. After all, with hair too short to cover his neck, you could see where Malfoy’s prisoner identification numbers were tattooed on his nape. For some reason, Harry had thought that he’d want to hide it.
“Oh dear,” says the figure, a roughly rendered woman with dark hair spilling over her bare shoulder. Harry squints to make out her face as she speaks. “I’m afraid I’m not fit for company at the moment, child. Pray, come back when the light is back.”
Neville nods. “Good thing he was willing to come out of retirement for it. No one else was.” He jerks his head towards the Slytherin table.
The Black family connection that Narcissa brought into her marriage set Draco to inherit not only the Malfoy businesses and shares, but also the legitimisation of an English Noble house. Draco’s sphere of influence in England and abroad is projected to be even wider than his parents, and he’d been trained accordingly since birth and walked with the confidence afforded him by his inheritance.
It really is a wonder how little Anton turned out so adorable, with a sadistic Death Eater as a father and a twitchy (also a Death Eater) older brother like Theo.
Blaise lets out a jaw-cracking yawn, wandlessly summoning his sandwich and pelting it at Draco’s face. “I’d rather watch you do it.”
Malfoy nods, chin propped up on a hand. “Just minor rituals to remind your soul of how it fits in your body. Luna knows them if you need someone to teach you and your gaggle of lions can’t help.”
But all through their horseplay Harry sees Luna frowning at him from the corner of his eyes. When he turns to ask her if something was wrong with a look, her frown deepens, and she reaches for his hand.
McGonagall now, Harry supposes. It’s odd to look up at the head table and not see Dumbledore with his twinkling eyes. No matter how much he resented the old man’s involvement in his life towards the end of the war, there was no denying that Harry loved him, as complicated as that love was, as one of the first adults who showed him that he
Harry catches the rock before he even realises Malfoy had thrown something at him. “Oi,” he says, more out of reflex than anything else.
A flash of black robes draws his eye to the right, and he watches as a girl who looks barely fifteen makes her way over to him on Blaise’s arm with a serene smile.
Draco nods. “It would be best. Another look will allow us to confirm our theories and assess whether the exercises are effective. But I believe we must address something else before we go any further.” He turns towards Potter to look at him with narrowed eyes. “I agreed to these meetings as a favour to a friend. But we, Potter, are not friends.”
He smiles at her over the body of his violin. “My lady, do you not enjoy my playing? I practiced so hard for you this year.”
This part is the trickiest. Both of them will have to act as conduits of the living magic that’s streaming into the ritual system to open a door to the spirit realm. That much power in one body is dangerous. Anything less than perfect control is… not ideal, to say the least.
Until faintly, from somewhere in the narrow distance between the space where they stand and the realm their shadows occupy, they hear the crying of a child.
Luna nods, smiling widely again. She picks up his arm and tugs him along again, moving faster this time. “He’s very gentle. I was quite surprised when I met him. I’m sure he can help us with your problem, Harry. He’s very clever.”
It feels like forever since he’d last seen them, even if it only really has been a couple of months at most. He’s glad that they’re here, really. But he knows how Ron and Hermione breathe, how they move in a confined space like this, and little things, like having to dodge out of the way awkwardly as Lavender and Parvati shuffle past him to go meet Ginny in another compartment, keeps throwing him off guard.
The room had broken out in a roar after a moment of startled silence. Harry had watched it all with narrowed eyes as Malfoy’s lips quirked in amusement, eyes dark. And at the end of that day, Draco Malfoy had walked out to serve a six-month sentence, somehow managing to look triumphant in chains.
I honestly did not expect to fall in love with baby Nott but he's so cute. I didn't even think Theo was gonna be in this.
But this was Julian Selwyn. The boy had asked Draco for a sterilising charm on the second night of term, holding a needle aloft with the same, vaguely disinterested expression he’d worn when asking for the plate of roast potatoes at dinner.
Meanwhile, Harry is silently having a crisis in his corner. “I didn’t know Malfoy was coming back this year,” he manages.
Malfoy rolls his eyes. “By all means, take as much time as you need to process this new and interesting experience. It’s not as if it’s –“ he flicks his wand. “-almost five am,
Greg nods. “She’d probably like that.” The ritual was always a little harder on the Light contingent, what with it being so firmly in the Dark time of the year, and if Draco was feeling lethargic this afternoon then Susan is
All that talk about ushering in a new era of magic supremacy. Draco had realised he probably wouldn’t even live to see it.
Harry laughs a little helplessly. “Hope she finds me before she gets distracted by the rain or something. Thanks for the heads up.”
Sorry it's been ages. I went overseas on holiday and this chapter was hard omg. I changed Julius' name to Julian in the last chapter because I liked it better, so please don't be confused when it comes up in later chapters.
Fair. It was a long shot anyway. “An exchange then.” He decides after a moment. “I teach you something, you do the same for me. Knowledge for knowledge.”
The thought of it had transformed Theo’s face and for a moment, it was as if the two of them were sitting across from each other in the Great Hall, eleven years old again. Both of them,
Even then, Harry can’t do as much watching as he wants to, since apparently taking a year off school has detrimental effects on his ability to remember what he learnt in sixth-year.

Over at the other bed, Blaise cackles and tucks his covers more firmly around himself with sharp, little movements. The prick. “Sounds like you’d better get dressed, Malfoy.”
Neville purses his lips. “Not sure. By himself? Nah. But…” Neville eyes him carefully. “Malfoy. Think he’s up to something?”
The humming rises in pitch and the participants join hands, living and dead now equally corporeal. The globes of
Draco scoffs, flicking his hand as if he’s physically batting the topic away. “Whatever. We have more important things to discuss than what Potter’s wearing this afternoon.”
He sighs, tired suddenly. “After the drama of the past few years, I would honestly appreciate a few solid decades of peace.”
He locks eyes with Susan who is sweating, her hair whipping wildly behind her. She nods, and he takes another deep breath.
Sorry this took so long to come out. I got so distracted. I just started Dragon Age: Origins, finished season 1 of the witcher, just started The Untamed. All three has me thoroughly shook. I am so obsessed.
(An absent part of Harry thinks that it must get cold in winter here and wonders how Slytherins heat up their rooms.)
Go ahead and read it first though if you think you need to. It's been a while since updates so you might want to anyway lol (sorry).
Harry Potter wakes up, eighteen years old, with joints that ache in the rain, and summons his glasses.
