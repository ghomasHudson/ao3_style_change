Furious loathing flooded through Harry like he’d never known it; he was filled with revulsion for the words spilling from Draco’s mouth, but he reviled himself, too, for having ever wanted him, for having kissed that mouth, for having ever thought anything could change. He wanted him to know what he was saying, to know the crippling anguish coursing through Harry; he wanted him to stop, he wanted it all to stop, he wanted . . .
“Studying Potions with Daphne Greengrass in the Slytherin Common Room.”
to this statement as well, and couldn't think of anything to replace it. Eventually, he came up with, 'I didn't know.'
'Oh.'  Harry scowls, though he can't tell if he begrudges Malfoy his living mother or the reason for Lupin's call.  'Hang on,' he says, then turns and bellows, 'Malfoy?'
'Shut up,' Harry said raggedly. 'You can't just go around saying those things! I can't believe—after
It was past midnight when Remus Flooed with Harry back to Hogwarts and, after forcing him to take a cup of tea and a half-melted bar of chocolate, led Harry into a small, dusty room on the second floor. “It’s been a long night, I know,” he sighed, one arm around Harry’s shoulders. “But here—everything will be explained, I think Albus must be here—"
'Yes, but this time we've got Harry, and Kingsley as Minister! He hasn't a chance. He'd be better off pleading guilty and hoping for a minimal sentence. I don't know how he thinks he'll get away with this.'
'If you're talking about Snape, I have . . . made a fuss,' Harry says, clearly remembering catching Malfoy in the drawing room and asking when he was going to get around to his half of the deal.  Malfoy had scowled, and Harry had narrowed his eyes, and reminded Malfoy of the terms of his safety.
want people knowing.  Smart thinking, Malfoy.'
'Oh.'
Harry crossed his arms. "But it's not worth it," he said angrily. "My mum, my dad, all of them, they all died because they loved me. It doesn't do them any good to know I loved them, especially my parents! I didn't even know them yet! And Cedric, he died for me, and I hardly knew him. And—and Sirius—there was never time, and—"
'You're spying on the Ministry?' Ron says, entering the kitchen.  Sparing a sneer for Malfoy, he reaches around Hermione to retrieve a carrot.  'Isn't that—I don't know, not right?'
on the table, he finally pulled out a small brown owl; blinking, it gave a soft little hoot.
'You are a part of my life,' Harry said, dumbfounded at how she could think anything else.
This resolution lasted approximately fourteen hours, at which point he ran into Malfoy near the Charms corridor.
'Yeah, I think you've made it clear you don't want to be with me,' Harry snapped.
'Well, we want information, don't we?' Hermione said, still with that smug air about her. 'Come on!'
“Serves him right,” Ron muttered, finally seeing the justice in the situation. “All those years of his jibes, let him see how it feels! I hope he mixes up the spells and turns his robes pink or something awful.”
And the newspapers, what of that? Harry had most of them burned, but he couldn't do much about it. He read somewhere that photographs only capture a moment of someone's consciousness, whereas portraits encompass the entire person, their thoughts, their being. This is minor comfort. Photographs are snapshots. Paintings are expressions of life.
“Fine,” he muttered. It felt impolite to jump into telling her that he knew about what had happened in Wales, but he suddenly had no idea what else to say. “Um, how are you?”
“Theodore Nott?” Ron choked. “That weedy bastard? But his dad was in Azkaban!”
“Oh yeah, and Ginny had Luna Lovegood over yesterday. I tell you, she’s nutters, Harry—all she did was wander around muttering about Nargles and Crumple Toothed Hornbacks or whatever they’re called!”
Harry spat, “Your father is Voldemort’s henchman! They’ll be in the same place!”
'Because of him,' Harry says.  'He chose his loyalty long before I got him put in Azkaban.  People have died on my side, too, you know.  Some of them because of him.'
'We have to talk about our project,' Harry started in, determined to stay on topic. 'Slughorn said we can do anything in Chapter Fifteen.'
. I want—I want—"
Harry stared at him. He could hear the echoes of Draco’s sneering taunts, the way he had shouted, “I hope next time it’s Granger!” He knew, in the back of his mind, that Draco was still a horrible, hateful little bigot who thought nothing of using other people, and the knowledge had frozen him, it was impossible to ignore. Yet here, staring at Draco standing so simply before him, he could almost feel his resolve melting away.
The warden's office is just to the left, beside the entrance to Azkaban, and Harry peers cautiously around the open door.  Behind an ever-replenishing stack of papers, he spots a dirty, empty teacup, and a half-eaten piece of toast on a plate.  'Hello?' Harry says.  'Er, excuse me?'  On the warden's desk, there is a plaque that reads ONA ELLERBY.
'I wasn't trying to be a champion! I just cared about—'
It had been naïve, perhaps, to think that the aftermath would be all sunlit days, all walks by the lake and stolen hours in corners of the Hogwarts grounds, Ginny warm and soft next to him.
Silence falls between them, more sudden than Harry expects; Malfoy is staring at him with an unreadable look, and only when he looks away does he say, 'To protect me.'
They're in the middle of dinner when the owl comes.  It overshoots and, instead of dropping the letter to Harry, it drops it right in the middle of Hermione's casserole.  'Oh, for heaven's sake,' Hermione mutters, and casts a quick
“I’m so sorry, Harry,” Hermione began, but he shook his head.
For an instant, Draco looked perplexed, and then he said, “It’s not, it’s a present.”
Harry sighed and moved away from Ron, who was nodding enthusiastically to something the girl had said. This was supposed to be fun? He wondered where Hermione had gone and was about to finish his Butterbeer and go find her when he felt a sharp prod on his arm. He spun around, Hermione’s name on his lips, and came face to face with someone decidedly more unpleasant.
Harry leans against the wall.  'She wouldn't have talked to us.  You know that.'
He was not even sure where he was going, only walking, going somewhere. He reached the familiar seventh floor corridor and strode angrily back and forth in front of the stretch of wall until a door appeared, and it wasn't until he flung it open that he registered what he had been thinking, a place to hide,
On an unseasonably warm night that month, they were ensconced in a broom cupboard near the Entrance Hall, Harry's gaze fixed on the cobwebs at eye-level while Malfoy rustled around on his knees, complaining loudly about the dust. Malfoy could whisper things in Harry's ear when they bumped into each other in the halls without anyone the wiser, but the instant he began to complain, it was like a habit: his voice carried as if he'd done a
'Be quiet!' Hermione hissed. 'I want to listen!'
Beneath them, Dudley had scrawled in the cursive of an eight year old,
Hermione had been right about security precautions, in any case; when they entered Hogsmeade, they passed by the disdainful presence of Professor Snape, hovering awkwardly around the milling students. And, just as he spotted Ron’s head towering above his gaggle of third-years, Harry also glimpsed a familiar cat vanishing into the crowd. McGonagall, he’d bet, keeping an eye out where she could.
"You forget, Potter, that I've nothing to lose,” he snarled. “If the Dark Lord wins, I win. If you win, I win. Otherwise, I don't care. I'm not you."
“Ron,“ Hermione pleaded.
'Who are you writing to, Harry?' Hermione asked innocently, peering over his shoulder. Harry slammed his hand over the parchment, getting several sticky jam fingerprints all over Malfoy's scrawl in the process. When he looked up, Hermione was shaking with suppressed laughter.
Tonks was at the bar of The Three Broomsticks when Harry entered; she was chatting pleasantly with Madam Rosmerta, who was giggling at something Tonks had said. Tonks was wearing a skirt over outrageously striped tights, which were cut off mid-calf by large boots. When she turned around to see him, he saw the word SPELLSHOCK emblazoned on her shirt, presumably a band, from the moving silhouette of a drummer banging silently on a drum set above the words. For an instant, when she turned towards him, she looked utterly exhausted, but then her face cleared and he wondered if he’d been imagining things. “Wotcher, Harry,” she said cheerfully, and gave Madam Rosmerta a parting smile before sauntering over to him.
'No,' Malfoy retorted at once. 'And if I did, I certainly wouldn't pick you. I'd prefer someone who won't hex me, thanks.'
She tucked her arm in his and they went into the roar of the other room. Now Hermione and Charlie were having a rousing discussion of the place dragons held in the mind of the Ministry, and their use in Gringotts defenses; when he heard the name Gringotts, Bill jumped into the fray as well, until the warbling tones of Celestina Warbeck were entirely drowned out by their voices. Fleur looked pleased at this.
“I was thinking about the essay on Veritaserum,” Hermione mused. Harry seemed to have sparked something with his mention of Potions. “I’d like to address it through ethical application, along with the issues Snape raised in class, about potency, and how its distilled cousins could be employed in more basic, less regulated—"
'She said Malfoy told her I would help him,' Harry says.  'She said that.  Why would she come to me otherwise?'
'Look,' said Ron. 'I think we should split up, it's the smart thing to do. If—'
It's past noon on a Sunday when Lupin's tired head pops up in the midst of green flames and Harry kneels down to meet him.  'How are you holding up?' Lupin asks immediately.  'How are Hermione and Ron?'
, Harry thinks,
'Oh, anyone can, Harry,' Dumbledore says.  'The only requirement is that the viewer believes, truly, in his or her heart, that Severus Snape is on their side, the side of the Order.'
Remus was smiling at him when Harry blinked and met his eyes. “Besides,” Remus said, “all of this with Draco, your dad never could have done that.”
“Actually,” Harry retorted, unable to stop himself even if he wanted to, “I don’t think you’re ready for that, are you, Malfoy?”
Ron practically glowed as he glanced in Hermione’s direction, as if to say, see? “Thanks, Luna,” he said pointedly. Luna giggled.
'Like my father, I suppose,' Malfoy snapped.
!” Harry yelled, and Bellatrix’s eyes bulged as she tried to speak and couldn’t. She looked insane, eyes bloodshot and wide, her expression livid, and it was a terrifying sight as she leapt at him, hands outstretched for his throat. He shouted, hoarse, “
“Harry?” She looked slightly worried about his reaction to what she was about to say but, nonetheless, plunged onwards. “Do you have—feelings—for—for Malfoy?”
'The arrogance of wand-carriers!' Griphook hissed. 'Assuming that they know best how all things can be used, even the magic which they do not possess! The enslavement of house-elves . . . thieving goblin-made treasure . . .'
'You were stealing,' Harry says, but his mind is already racing ahead of him.  Harry had seen Mundungus, months ago, in Hogsmeade . . . he had been carrying a suitcase stuffed full of things from the House of Black . . . and Harry remembers, suddenly, that in cleaning out the drawing room cabinets, there had been . . .
He is fast asleep when Ron wakes him that night,
'But that's only Quidditch.'
Tonks made a face. “Professor Tonks is my aunt. Tonks, please, unless Professor McGonagall’s around. What is it?”
'Well?'  Harry's eyes flicker pointedly towards the door.  'I'll be taking your wand with me, of course—you won't be needing it—'
She took one look at him and blanched.
Holding up his stash of sweets, Harry shrugged. "Not particularly. If you don't want to come, fine, I’ll go by myself—"
“Shh. I don’t want to wake Remus up.”
. Good lord, Potter, I'm not suffering from a case of low self-esteem. It's just that—you rarely think so.'
Caught entirely unprepared, wand still in his pocket, Harry’s mind swam. His thoughts raced with images, flashing by him . . . he was in the hall of the house on Privet Drive and Dudley was shoving him backwards . . . he was at the club in Diagon Alley and Malfoy was sneering at him . . . the Knight Bus was pulling up beside him . . . Tonks was grinding up against him in a blur of neon shapes and pulsing lights . . . Sirius’s laughter was fading to shock as he arced backwards, out of sight . . .
Malfoy had never been anything special. He didn’t matter. He was nobody to Harry, just an irritation who refused to leave, who persisted in getting attention by trying harder and harder to get under Harry’s skin. Malfoy repulsed him. Everything he stood for disgusted him. Malfoy wasn’t worth a second glance.
'Hermione,' he says, throat tight, and hopes he doesn't sound like an idiot.  'You and Ron, I dunno what I'd do without you.'
‘Getting less eloquent every year, aren’t you?’ Malfoy observes. ‘At this rate, by the time your sprog is at Hogwarts, you’ll be communicating in grunts.’
'Ron? Can you get my owl and have him take this to Kingsley right away?' Ron nodded and took the parchment from him. 'And Hermione, will you tell Professor McGonagall what's happened?'
'How should I know?  We didn't
Harry tried desperately to think of nothing, but he was staring directly at Snape, and he couldn’t help but think of how Snape had provoked Sirius in the kitchen of Grimmauld Place, how he had taunted him. “
Harry went with another goblin to retrieve his money and left the bank quietly.
are digging into my thighs, and I'm going to have permanent bruises, so excuse me if there isn't a lot of room for my elbows elsewhere.'
'That's touching, Potter,' Malfoy drawls.  'But we're sleeping on the ground and I'd like to go to sleep some time in this century, so spare me your emotional outpourings, would you?'
She gave him an exasperated, if fond smile. 'I think I ought to go find Ron and Kingsley,' she said. 'If anyone can convince the Minister of Magic to break the rules, it's me. I'll see you back at Hogwarts, all right?'
“Well,” Tonks said abruptly, interrupting just as Harry opened his mouth to shout at him, “no sense standing around in wet clothes, is there? I’m off to have a nice bath before dinner. See you, Harry.” With that, she gave him a wink before stomping wetly off towards the stairs.
He took all the stairs to the seventh floor as quickly as he could, so that by the time he burst into the common room, he was panting. There was no sight of Ron anywhere, but he spotted Hermione curled up in an armchair, Crookshanks on her lap.
Hermione looked a cross between revolted and amused. 'Sorry?'
For some reason, the idea of weekly letters made something around Harry’s heart seize up, and he had to glance away quickly. “I’m sorry,” he said, again.
He says, 'Malfoy's going to be staying here for a little while, Ron.'
'Wha's that yeh said, Harry?'
'Who're you calling—' Ron begins angrily, but Hermione is already shoving him in the direction of the kitchen.  Harry steps around the corner and leans against the wall, listening.  Sure enough, after a minute of Malfoy introducing himself and his extensive family history, Mrs. Black's shrill voice is heard exclaiming, 'A Malfoy!  What a surprise!  And Narcissa's son?  You don't say!'
'Don't say it.'
'Well, maybe Dumbledore will be faster,' Harry retorts.  'He
"Not Chang, then," Draco mused. "Well, who've you got your eye on, then, Potter? The Metamorphmagus, is it?"
Harry shut his eyes, the roar of his friends' voices around him. It was only for a minute. And perhaps everyone had a point, perhaps he really did need to rest . . .
Malfoy eyed him and for a split second, Harry thought he wasn't going to say anything, and then he replied, 'Hey yourself, Potter,' before strutting off down the hall.
'That's right. What were you out doing?'
'Oh, and Mr. Potter?'
Harry rests his hands on Scrimgeour's desk and leans forward.  Out of the corner of his eye, he sees another airplane memo zoom into the box and flatten itself out neatly.  He says, 'It's about Draco Malfoy.'
'There's got to be!' a voice exclaims from the fire, though Fred's mouth doesn't move.  After a moment, Fred's head disappears, and George's pokes through.  He exclaims, 'There are all kinds of spells linked to one person specifically.  Maybe it's linked to wands?'
Harry sighs and rubs his thumb over a spot of dirt on the table.  'I'll wear it for now, Ron.  In the meantime, what, Hermione?'
'So, boys,' she commented at last. 'That's a new thing, is it?'
It was all a blur to Harry. He stared at Malfoy through the growing crowd. Malfoy’s pale face stared back at him, expressionless, and then Ron pushed him aside to get to Harry, and he was gone.
'Yeah,' Ginny said. It was all too obvious that she had been hoping for something else. 'Sure. Bye, Harry.'
“The Ministry has been lenient, with some persuasion,” Dumbledore said, giving Tonks and her mother a faint smile. “But it is best if they go into hiding for some time, just as a precaution. That’s where you come in, Harry.”
'We did the right thing,' she hissed; she was white. 'We did, didn't we?'
“It’s a Slytherin concern,” Draco snapped, turning away from him. “Not yours.”
"Well, we werent—it's not much, I just—had it around—well, you probably have a million of them anyway, but—" Harry paused, suddenly aware that he was babbling, and shut up. For one stunned, quiet second, he realized that he actually wanted Draco to like it.
“I’m not the only one!” Harry retorted, aware that across the room, Malfoy was sniggering at the news that he’d needed Dumbledore’s help just to get in the class. “You just said it yourself, we’re all incompetent failures.”
'Look!' someone screamed as Harry was crossing the street. 'Look, that's Harry Potter! Hey, Harry! Harry, over here!'
'Yeah, what would you prefer,' said Harry, and not quite knowing what came over him, mock-groaned hotly in the other boy's ear, 'Oh, Malfoy, yeah, like that . . .'
Harry explained that he had talked with Tonks and been forced to face her reasons for betrayal, without mentioning the Fidelius Charm in any specifics. Both looked grim at the mention of Tonks, though Hermione made a small sound of sympathy when Harry told them about how Ted Tonks had been murdered, and she nodded at several points in his story, as if she understood.
Luna was sitting near the lake when Harry went out to send his owl; he went over to her, where she was sprawled with her feet in the shallows.
Harry shared a grin with him. 'You, too. Hey, are you going back to Hogwarts?'
'Oi!' Ron said, halting so suddenly that Hermione ran right into him. 'It's Malfoy!'
“I don’t trust anyone anymore,” Harry snapped, but he took the paper that Dumbledore handed to him. It was folded several times over and creased in strange places, as if it had once been a paper airplane like the memos Harry had seen on his visit to the Ministry. He glanced down at it disinterestedly, fuming inside.
'A shame?' Ron exploded. 'Hermione was tortured in that house! The Malfoys tried to shut us up in their cellar!'
Wryly, Harry muttered, "Well, we haven't exactly had the best of friendships."
'And Merlin himself, I'm sure,' Harry snorts.  'Never mind, I know how narcissistic you are.  I just came to tell you that I went to the Ministry today.'
'I'll suck it for you,' Harry said in his ear and Malfoy outright groaned, at which point Harry remembered his hypothesis on Malfoy's deformed dick and fervently regretted the offer he had just made, as well as his overall penchant for reckless behavior. At least, Harry thought, from the way Malfoy was grinding up against his thigh, he certainly had something down there, and it didn't feel abnormally small, either. He was pleased until a second later he recalled that he might want the exact opposite, if Malfoy were going to stick it in Harry's mouth.
'We'll Apparate right now, come on,' Harry said, his mind already racing to the next step, and the next. 'We'll go to Azkaban and make sure—'
'Do you want to take a walk?' Ginny repeats.  She smiles up at Harry, the sun catching in her hair.  'I can talk Quidditch, too, you know.'
'You should,' Harry snaps, trying to keep his tone even, 'because this entire thing is for you, to save your life, and if you think I'm just generous, if you think I'm doing you a favor, I'm not!  It's a deal.  I save your life.  I get your pardon.  I do the same for both of your parents, who I happen to despise, almost as much as I despise you, and in return you give me your information, you give me Snape, and you go along with my plans, or you know what?  It's off, the whole thing is off, and I'd be perfectly happy to leave you in the middle of London with a flashing sign above your head telling Voldemort exactly where you are!'
'Why, do you?' Harry grinned. 'Will you calm down? There's no one around.'
“Precious Potty was having nightmares again,” Malfoy sniggered to Blaise, as they walked past Harry’s desk. He smirked down at Harry. “What’s the matter, Potter, somebody been
Harry looked glumly at the end of the table. Though he knew it would only enrage him, he wished Hermione had told him how the reunion had happened. Probably, he thought bitterly, when he was out flying with Malfoy. It figured as much.
Harry nodded; he did not feel much like discussing it. 'Yeah, I did. Though Neville says it'll probably just pop out of the hat if someone needs it, but don't tell Hermione that. Hey, did you hear that Neville's going back to Hogwarts too?'
'Sorry,' Harry said. 'I guess I mean, I kissed Malfoy.'
It turns into prank warfare.  Harry and Ron have never had Malfoy alone, at their mercy, all the time, and both of them have been trapped inside the House of Black for weeks with only Hermione and several archaic biographies of wizards with the initials R.A.B. for company.  For his part, Malfoy takes to skulking in the drawing room, wand in hand, jumping the instant anything moves.  Once, he sends a swarm of bees chasing after Harry; they buzz at him for nearly three hours before Hermione can figure out the counter-jinx.  He thinks, ruefully, that Malfoy's constant whining might have been a very small improvement.
Harry ignores him and sidles out of his portrait. When you're dead and one-dimensional, Harry has found, it is easier to walk away from things. Even if you're walking sideways.
, Harry,' Mrs. Weasley mutters, looking distractedly around the kitchen.  'You and Hermione, you're like family—it's only that, we're so busy, and no one has time to look after the—after—
Harry passed the small selection of books and the rows of quills twice without seeing Hermione. Next was a long aisle of parchment, of all colors and sorts, and he was fingering the edible stuff with curiosity when he heard a shrill, familiar voice from the front of the shop. Unable to leave well enough alone, he moved towards the door.
'I suppose promises don't keep after—'
Harry barely made it to Herbology that afternoon before Hermione pounced and began to interrogate him about Lucius Malfoy's trial. They were in the greenhouses and everyone was sweating in the heat: Harry's fringe stuck to his forehead, and Hermione fanned herself with her Herbology textbook. Everything smelled like dirt in the streaming sun, sleepy and slow. All this was offset, of course, by the urgency in Hermione's tone.
“Yeah,” Harry said.
'If you want to call it that.'
“Wales,” Harry said impatiently. “To kill Voldemort.”
He spell-locks Malfoy's curtains closed just in case.
“Potter,” Malfoy said scathingly, still half in the shadows, “are you thick? Hogwarts is the other way.”
The magical world is obsessed with eternity. He remembers Nicholas Flamel and the philosopher's stone. He remembers the extended life, Dumbledore still spry at one hundred and fifty years old, their life somehow spiced and sustained by the magical spark. He remembers the thousands of paintings littering Hogwarts, each person's small piece of immortality, and thinks that it is silly, really. Commission a portrait and live forever!
The last week in February, the cold spell broke, and with it, Harry’s resolve. He was leaving the Room of Requirement after a particularly long DA meeting, after everyone else had gone, when he opened the door and came face to face with Draco. Draco’s eyes immediately went wide with shock at the sight of Harry.
Harry said, "I've never heard of him."
Harry glared at her. “Ron’s right, you know. You should just go live in Ravenclaw.”
“I practiced all those spells with you,” Harry snarled, still advancing. “Oh, I’ll bet you loved that. Is that what this was all about, Malfoy? Playing your twisted games? All of this—the Defense practices, the money, the—the sex—"
It turned out to be a portent of sorts: the next day, he rounded the corner from the Charms corridor and came across Malfoy cornered like a snarling cat, surrounded by several other students. Harry recognized some of them. His first instinct was to turn away, but then he recalled the expression of pure panic on Malfoy's face in his dream and did not. 'Hey!' he said loudly.
'If you haven't noticed, she's with Dean.'
In an effort to change the subject, Harry said, “By the way, Lupin wrote.” Though the letter hadn’t come with the tiny package Harry’d claimed was from Lupin, it was still true. Harry’d received it several days before, filled with Lupin’s neat, scrawling script.
'I don't know how you stand it.'
“Um,” Harry said, “yeah. Funny.”
"I'm sorry," Draco offers petulantly.
Harry felt something tighten in his throat and he had the sudden, strange urge to fling his arms around Ron. Instead, he flopped into a chair by the fire.
'Maybe that is what I mean!' Harry shouted. 'I have good reason to think so, don't I? You're the one who's acting the coward!'
“There’s no one around. Dinner’s not for hours, no one will come down here—"
'I think I'll sit here, actually,' said Harry, feeling a bit rebellious.
Even Harry had no idea what he'd said until a moment later, when he, too, was inclined to snap, "What?" Why had he said that? But instead he repeated, lamely, "You should come for the hols. To stay with Lupin. There's plenty of room, and if your mum's going to France, you don't want to have to stay here. Well, maybe you do, I don't know, maybe you've always dreamed of sharing pudding with Dumbledore on Christmas morning—"
“. . . quite a surprise to see you back here,” Mrs. Black was saying, her voice surprisingly civil. “After being infested by Mudbloods and werewolves, I’d thought there was no hope for us. Bless you. How is your mother?”
that you were at Malfoy Manor fetching him back to Hogwarts, and I shouldn't have to always be running around wondering where you are, and I shouldn't have to feel like the fourth wheel when you and Ron and Hermione are all chattering on about things you've never told me. And you shouldn't have to, to remember to
of one!'
“I wasn’t awful,” Harry said indignantly. “Were you listening at the door?”
'Why not?' Ron demands, scowling at her for using Voldemort's name.  'He's a rotten little shit, why do we care what happens to him?'
“And that’s why you’re dating Anthony Goldstein, then?” Harry said cheekily. “Because the Sorting Hat told you to?”
'I'd give you at least ten days.'  Harry glances over his shoulder at the kitchen, then smiles wryly.  'After that, I can't be accountable for Ron.'
“More like slaving, if you ask me,” Ron muttered darkly, but they had reached the kitchen and it, at least, had succumbed in its battle with Molly Weasley. The whole room was well-lit and warm; pots were scrubbing themselves vigorously in the sinks, while Celestina Warbeck warbled tinnily from a small radio. At Mrs. Weasley’s side was a slim girl with flaming red hair, arguing tirelessly as she dried plates. Hearing Ron’s voice, both turned and exclaimed, “Harry!”
Ron looked slightly mollified. 'You think so?'
'No one is going to forget,' Hermione continued. 'Not those of us who were there. Nineteen years from now, thirty-two, sixty if we live that long. We'll still remember. But we can't stay there. It doesn't do any good for anybody, least of all the dead.'
A moment later, he went to push through the portrait hole when it swung open and Ginny emerged, laughing at something from a conversation she was leaving behind. The light from inside was warm on her hair, that burnished red-gold. When she turned and caught sight of him, however, she raised both eyebrows.
'Hi, Luna,' Ginny said, smoothing her dress over her knees as she settled back onto a seat. She shot Dean a far less friendly look. 'Hey, Dean.'
'Mean what?'
'Eddie Carmichael was Professor Binns' favorite student, Binns even remembered his name, maybe we could ask him,'  Hermione continues, as if Harry hasn't spoken.  'Or the Grey Lady might know!  If we go to Hogwarts, I'll have to make sure to look out for her.  Orla Quirke said they once had a very stimulating conversation about the magic in the Hogwarts stones.'
Harry frowned. 'What do you mean, it's all right now?'
Harry, embarrassed, quickly scrawls his name on a slip of paper and gives it to her.  As he's on his way to the door, Ona calls out one last time.
'Fine!' Harry snaps.  'It's a deal.  Then you can start with Ron and Hermione.'
The look on Draco’s face at what he had just said was pure horror, and Remus had to take a swift sip to cover his growing smile. “To get back to what happened in Little Whinging,” Remus said, when he’d recovered. “Draco, you never cast an Unforgivable Curse on Harry Potter tonight?”
“Oh,” Harry said. There was a plummeting feeling in his stomach, and he stammered, “I’m—I didn’t know, I thought—"
'Keep it down, Potter,' Malfoy would hiss, right on cue, and sometimes he even went so far as smothering Harry's mouth with his hand. His fingers usually smelled of Potions ingredients and once Harry licked at his palm until Malfoy tore his hand away and snarled, 'Get your tongue away from me,' though his heavy breathing belied everything he said.
, and he comes that way, eyes still locked with hers. ‘Please,’ she says, and he fingers her til she’s breathing fast again, making soft urgent noises he has almost forgotten, the ones that make him half-hard again, make his throat close up with surprise—even now, even now—that she’s his. After she comes, he wraps his arms around her and wraps the blankets around them.
When they reach the back of the Burrow, Ron is sprawled on the grass, waving his arms at the sky; Malfoy is leaning against the side of the house, looking green and not quite able to stand on his own, mumbling to himself.  'Harry,' Ron exclaims, trying to sit up and failing.  He flops back to the ground.  'My best mate, Harry!  Come down here!  Come sit in the—in the grass!  Beautiful grass.  The beautiful Burrow grass.'
Harry thought, darkly, that his birthday night had begun all of this. This fixation on Malfoy, this almost pity for him, this
Harry nods. 'Well, good luck.  Let us know when you get more of these Ears in.'
"What other alternatives do you have?" Harry demanded, at the same instant that he realized Draco might have a whole House of alternatives, that he could stay with Pansy, Crabbe, Goyle, Blaise . . .
“Go see what’s wrong now,” Remus sighed, and Harry moved to the doorway to look. Draco was standing in front of the portrait, arms folded, and he was almost smiling. Harry moved closer.
'Who?  How do you know all these people?'
They stood there, half in light, and for some reason, Malfoy began humming, low and then louder.
Harry had gotten out of bed early to see Ron and Ginny off; Hermione had left the night before, with Anthony, to spend Christmas at his home. She’d kissed him on the cheek, wished him luck, and told him she would send him an owl. Ron had looked pleased when she’d done the same to him, though when he opened the portrait hole to find Anthony Goldstein waiting outside, he’d looked decidedly less cheerful.
Hermione squeezed Harry's shoulder affectionately. 'Did you have a good birthday?'
, Potter,” Snape hissed. “And as for you, Miss Parkinson, I advise you to return to Slytherin. Draco and I need to have a word.”
Mrs. Black sniffs, 'Suddenly thought he could be a leader.  Just a fool, in the end.  I had fools for sons.  Blood traitors, Muggle-loving traitors.  Now, with a boy like you . . .'
He was not looking quite at Harry. They had stopped in the doorway, trapped in between the cool evening and the golden light of Hogwarts.
“You wanted to see me?” Harry said, rather rudely.
Malfoy's face, surprisingly, went pink. 'I wrote you a couple letters,' he mumbled.
No one listens to him.
'Why?' Harry narrowed his eyes. 'What are you getting him?'
He’d felt relieved, mostly, that he apparently wasn’t expected to navigate the further awkward mechanics of pleasing her in return, as the most he knew came from several sloppy kisses with Cho, one botched attempt to put his hand on her breast when it actually ended up somewhere on her ribcage, and the suggestions of Seamus’s more sordid magazines, which Ron sometimes stole from him and waved around the room, shouting things like, “Will you look at those knockers, Harry, she’s bloody stacked!”
Harry ignores it.
'You'd tail me, though,' Malfoy presses, 'in case Snape came to get me, you'd have me followed—'
“Oh, really?” Harry raised an interested eyebrow. “Because it seems to me you’re around an awful lot. In fact, every time I turn around, you’re right there. Ron even thinks that you’re stalking me.”
'I don't know,' Harry flared up, 'maybe I do!'
Malfoy hexed him again and he blocked it, magic sparks flying off the stones of the dungeon. It was both like a battle with a Death Eater and like play-fighting with Ron, and he felt like screaming and laughing all at once.
going to kill the Dark Lord? With what, Potter, a Bat-Bogey Hex?”
In the next three days, Harry found it surprisingly easy to avoid Malfoy, quite possibly because Malfoy was avoiding him. It was easy to rush out of Potions beside Hermione, or sit at the opposite side of the room in Charms, or go down to breakfast early, so that not only did Harry not have to bump into Malfoy over meals, he did not even have to see him. Harry did not even have to try that hard.
'I'm so sorry,' said Hermione, before Harry could say a word. 'Please owl me. Please. I'll take the spell off. There's got to be a way, I'll find one. I'm so sorry, Marietta, promise me you'll owl?'
'I didn't see any point in moving, Potter,' McGonagall says calmly.  'Since we aren't currently open, there wasn't much need.  Besides, I'm rather fond of my old office.'
“All right, Ginny,” Mrs. Weasley said, “if you’ll give up this nonsense about a job.”
'Coward,' Ron pronounced.
Harry found, sizing up Draco's expression, that the thank you was genuine. He was gratified. "You've got to put a Mobilipennae charm on it to make it fly, I think. The salesman said it was good for Seeker practice."
“But what if someone finds out?“
Harry rolled his eyes. 'Fine,' he said. 'I'll be in Quality Quidditch.'
,” Harry shouted, before Ron could pull his wand. Ron glared at him. So did Malfoy.
Harry shrugged. 'It happens on occasion.'
She was smiling over at them fondly. 'I'm glad Malfoy has his friends back,' she mused. 'He looks happier, doesn't he?'
"I was going to look for you," Harry offered uncomfortably. All this talk of the previous night was making him uneasy.
“Hey, Hermione,” he said and put his arm around her. Harry tried to frown at him for Ron’s sake. “Hey, Harry. Snape’s not in the classroom. Nobody knows what’s going on. I reckon we should stick around anyway, though, or he’ll probably give us all Ds for not turning in our essays. And that’s the last thing I need now.”
'Harry,' she said. 'Are you okay?'
“You don’t think of yourself as the greatest gift to wizarding kind, you mean,” Remus said, and laughed quietly. “Harry, you’ll never be just like James, and do you know why that is? You’ve had to be grown up since you were eleven years old. All this time at Hogwarts, and you’ve had to deal with being Harry Potter, and with the knowledge that somewhere out there, people want you dead. And what were we doing at sixteen? Getting drunk off our arses and watching James make a fool of himself in front of Lily, that’s what. We hadn’t anything else to do. Sirius and James, they were—we were all young, we didn’t have to be serious. But Harry, your dad was courageous when he had to be. Despite all the pranks he and Sirius played, his heart was in the right place. You’re more like him than you know.”
“Not for Ginny!” Ron exclaimed, and then narrowed his eyes at her. “Well, it’s not like
“Under house arrest until her trial,” Draco said, his eyes flashing cold and unfamiliar. “I heard the Metamorphmagus is going to testify.”
'Aurors,' Hermione had scoffed, and turned the paper to ashes with a flick of her wand.
“What’s all the noise about now?” she said, her fifth year Transfiguration text tucked under her arm. “I could hear you yelling upstairs, Harry.”
“Good,” Tonks said, in his ear. She was watching Malfoy and Pansy too. Pansy was running her hands up Malfoy’s chest and twining her arms around Malfoy’s neck, and then she leaned up and kissed him, lewd and open-mouthed, still pressing up against him. “Harry,” Tonks whispered, and he had a moment of bewilderment before they were kissing too, her lips soft, her thumbs tucked in the belt loops of his jeans and pulling him closer. It was different than kissing Cho, which was mostly her crying with her lips pressed on his. Tonks was twining her tongue in his mouth and she pulled back to bite softly at his lower lip, his fingers bruising her back, her body small and eager against him.
'So are you,' Harry retorted, before the heel of his hand even found its way to the bulge in Malfoy's trousers.
'What's Tonks doing in Wales?'
Since Malfoy is still staring at him, Harry says,  'He had some other stuff to say.  Stuff I have to think about.  I don't know.'
You knew, did you? I’ll bet you did!”
“I think Jack’s lost it,” Ron whispered to him, grinning, although he, too, looked a bit peaky, and the rest of the team not much better. They had been doing all right, but their last practice had ended with Andrew accidentally knocking Natalie off her broom and Ron narrowly missing running into a goalpost, so none of them felt overconfident about a Gryffindor win.
“You can’t stop me,” Harry snarled. “I’ll bet he’s forgotten about you already, bet he thinks you’re just a pathetic little crybaby—"
At the moment, it suited Harry just fine.
'How do you fight an Inferius?'
She was looking at him, wide-eyed. “Harry—"
!' and suddenly he was inundated with Malfoy's memories, an image of Narcissa Malfoy's cool lips on his forehead . . . Malfoy as a very small blonde boy riding a horse with what looked to be a tiny Pansy Parkinson behind him . . . Voldemort punishing Narcissa while Malfoy cried, 'No, no' . . . Harry, Snitch still in hand, sinking his fist into Malfoy's stomach on the Quidditch pitch . . .
“Naturally,” Draco said, sounding reluctant and irritable. He was still hunched in the chair, deliberately avoiding Harry’s gaze.
He left Remus sitting there with his lukewarm tea and his sad eyes, and Remus let him, which made Harry even angrier. He felt furious and desperate all at once, with nowhere to go, and he was even contemplating going back to Remus just so he could shout that he didn’t care one bit about Draco Malfoy, when he ran smack into Dumbledore.
What shocked him even more, however, was the appearance of Malfoy. Harry hadn’t seen him come in the door, but later, he caught sight of him in the very back of the room, leaning against the wall with his arms folded and an inscrutable look on his face. Once they began practicing, however, Malfoy disappeared. Harry suspected he’d slipped out when everyone was partnering up.
Harry laughed, too. "Like you could ever beat me. I'm not worried."
“You must learn to control your emotions,” Snape said, as coolly as ever, staring down at Harry.
Harry studied Tonks all through the Sorting and Dumbledore’s brief welcome. He watched her smile secretly at something Professor Sprout said, touch her hair thoughtfully, clap dutifully at every new first year. She was quite possibly the youngest professor Hogwarts had seen in decades, and—perhaps with the exception of Professor Trelawney—certainly the most eccentric. And at that moment, just as Dumbledore clapped his hands for the food and the Great Hall filled with hubbub and the chaos of passing dishes, she looked directly at Harry and smiled.
'Filthy scum!' Mrs. Black screeched from her portrait. 'Half-breeds, Muggle-lovers, dirty, filthy blood traitors—'
'Is it really small?' he asked hopefully.
'If you don't come back to Hogwarts,' Harry said, 'they're going to get rid of Slytherin.'
He thought of his childish scrawl on the old piece of parchment, how it had looked as his owl carried it off. In that moment, with Ginny on his mind, he had thought he was doing the right thing, walking the line in between. But who was he, to choose? Who was he, to let Lucius Malfoy off with twenty years in Azkaban, or to see him die at the hands of the Muggle-born who had once been his victims?
She had that look about her that suggested she knew he wouldn't like what she had to say, but needed to tell him regardless. 'I only think you're letting your emotions get in the way of behaving more reasonably. Like a, um, grown-up.'
But Harry was too busy flushing at the mention of Tonks to answer properly, and he busied himself in the silver. Ron appealed to Hermione.
People were still talking about the Quidditch match two weeks later, when the second Hogsmeade weekend came around. Harry must have heard from half the school how both Goyle and Crabbe had sent Bludgers flying at him, and several eager fourth-year boys eagerly mimed the way he had fallen off his broom while eating dinner, until Hermione told them in a no-nonsense tone to get back in their seats. The castle was buzzing with the story of Malfoy’s intervention, as well, though most of the rumors in Gryffindor were that Malfoy had hidden his wand so he could hex Harry, or perform some other, worse, Quidditch foul. One of the favorite theories held that the entire thing had been planned and Malfoy had ordered Crabbe and Goyle to aim for Harry, so that Malfoy could act the hero. This didn’t make much sense, however, and no one outside Gryffindor believed it, though Colin and Dennis Creevey could be heard insisting to several people that it was the truth.
'Still looks like a weasel hole,' Malfoy mutters, and Harry pokes him hard in the side.  Mrs. Weasley, hurrying over to great them, gives them both a curious look when Malfoy yelps.
Malfoy sneered. 'Not everyone can be a Gryffindor. The brave, the worthy, the oh so virtuous—'
Sparked by fear into anger, Harry snapped, “That’s a real plan, Malfoy, go on and tell your fugitive dad about how Harry Potter cursed you, I bet he’ll be real proud of you then."
Harry laughed in spite of himself. They were silent for a moment, until he said, unexpectedly, “We should go flying sometime.”
They were silent afterwards, their breathing loud, everything sticky and awkward; Harry slid out of him and buried his head in the heated, sweat-slick place between Draco’s shoulder and neck. “I,” Harry said, muffled against his skin, and he wanted to say something, but he thought Draco knew, must know.
‘That’s—different.’
'Yes, so what? I'm good at fiddling with things.'
'Bit hard to look out for them when there aren't any,' Ron said with a grin. Harry had to stifle a smile.
'I know, but how do you
Harry smiles in spite of himself.  Malfoy's turned around now, staring out the window, something tight and frozen about his expression, and Harry puts his hand on the other boy's upper arm; says, 'Malfoy?'  He half expects him to turn and bury his face in Harry's shoulder, or something equally Cho-like, but all Malfoy does is clench his fists and push away from Harry, not angry, just determined somehow.
clear his mind before sleep now, and it was only a matter of time before he could manage the same while facing down Snape. Things had been getting easier . . . he hadn’t had a dream about Voldemort in months . . .
'Quidditch!' Harry exclaimed at the same time Ron said, 'How George is getting along,' and Hermione added,
'You too,' said Harry. He looked over his shoulder at the battered old door of 12 Grimmauld Place, which did not look quite as forbidding as it once had. Then he stepped away, and the house, and Andromeda, vanished from sight.
Just then, a voice croaks, 'Is that you, Potter?'
“I’m pleased to hear you aren’t set on curing Mr. Malfoy of his personality,” Dumbledore elaborated, eyes twinkling. “For that would be almost as foolhardy as caring only about one part of someone and ignoring the rest. In a void, perhaps that could work. In the real world, it never does.”
Malfoy is pale, arms crossed over his chest.  'But she—she's going to read the article and think I'm dead!'
Harry almost choked laughing. 'No,' he said. 'It's, I don't know, average. Like mine.'
'But Harry, that's fantastic!' Hermione exclaimed. 'Of course you should be an Auror!'
Several students were already goggling at her reference to Moody as “Mad-Eye,” while some others were still stuck on the shocking color of her hair. Seamus raised his hand next. “Professor Tonks?”
"Well, what've you been thinking about all this time?" Both of their voices were rising indignantly. Harry found that he didn't much care.
The library was no place for goings-on like the sort Malfoy and that Greengrass girl were up to. Harry cast a scandalized look at Hermione, expecting agreement; no one took the sanctity of the library more seriously than Hermione, save perhaps Madam Pince.
'Helping you out,' Malfoy snaps, brushing himself off indignantly.  'And as a reward, I had to touch you.  That's the last time I do something like that.'
'He's there because of me,' said Malfoy fiercely. 'Because of me, because he was trying to protect me, because he wanted the best for me!'
“Better,” Harry said, making a face. Beside them, Katie was felled by a Bat-Bogey Hex, which seemed to be Ginny’s specialty. Harry and Remus watched as Ginny immediately removed the hex, feeling sorry for Katie as she beat at her face. Without losing a moment, Katie cast a hex in return, and both Harry and Remus gave her an approving nod for her quick recovery.
? They need help, Fred told me, he said I’d be first pick, you know how particular they are!”
, he thought grimly. Something told him that he was really going to enjoy hexing Malfoy.
sometimes, and—' Harry scowls at Ron, who is apologetically mouthing something about Hermione, '—and, and fine, if you are, we'll throw in a cake.'
“Unfinished business?” Harry hissed. “Like the fact that you killed Sirius?”
“But I don’t
“I thought you said Pansy was your friend,” Harry shrugged. “Maybe she’d understand.”
“Mum’s like that,” Ginny interjected, grinning openly. “Are you allowed to do this? Come down here and sit with us like this?”
“Tom stole from kids at the orphanage. He tortured people, Ginny.” But he doesn’t sound enraged about it, only flat and disdainful. She feels miserable.
did. No other reason.”
She stays silent, but she had already resolved to reveal that she knew infinitely more about his situation than he had always thought.
Harry stands on Platform 9 of King’s Cross Station with Miss Granger and the Weasleys. As usual, they stand out sorely, being dressed in what is considered casual attire among the magical community. This means the women wear long dresses with corsets and multiple layers of fabric, although plain and practical for witches, they appear grossly outdated to the Muggles passing by, many of whom look quizzically at them.
“They’re worried sick,” Ginny says, trying to bite back her anger. “And you know, I would be too—more than I am, at least—if I didn’t know what was going on.”
Harry knows this too, that Draco will always give in, will always try to save him. That’s why he came in the first place. Harry grins smugly, and starts to walk away, and all Draco can do is watch him walk away.
“I wish I could help.” But he doesn’t look like it. He looks miserable.
Blaise smirks. “Isn’t it just me?”
Hermione opens the bedroom door an inch, looking inside the darkness and trying to make out a sleeping Harry on the bed. Ron nudges her side, and she opens it all the way.
Miss Granger and Mr Ron Weasley are worried, but they pretend not to be for his sake.
“But I’m very tall.” Dean ducks into the Portrait hole as if to make a point, smiling.
Draco’s eyelids begin to close with a heaviness only possible after three nights of a few meager hours of sleep. He turns the page of his Potion’s textbook. Snape sure did assign a lot of reading. As a fellow Slytherin he feels this is an injustice. Can’t Snape give him a pass?
Harry’s breath caught. His eyes fixated on Draco’s pale chest, traveling from the tattoo he saw earlier which was indeed the wing of a black sparrow arched across his chest. But there were more. Way more.
“I lied,” Harry says coldly, crossing his arms. “I don’t have any proof.”
“It’s the only way and you know it,” Harry says darkly. Draco turns, and tries to hide the pity that he feels. Harry hates pity above almost all else.
“Oh I know for convention sake everyone will say Harry Potter but anyone with eyes and a little bit of courage will say that Blaise is far superior in looks and personality,” Pansy says confidently, examining her long nails which today are painted a bright blood red for the start of the Halloween season. She smirks when Draco scowls.
“What if we are not accepted into a course?” Weasley asks worriedly.
It is deep in the night when he hears a noise from across the hall, and he sits up. Pansy has left her room, and her footsteps fade as she walks downstairs. He holds his breath, listening. Even though he knows what is coming, his eyes still burn with unshed tears, and his chest aches as if pierced through by metal.
“Well?” Weasley asks tensely when she finishes reading.
“I suppose,” Harry says awkwardly, wondering if Dumbledore hadn’t heard about his incident with Draco. It’d be strange, but not surprising.
,” Pansy quotes, and for a moment Draco remembers the night he said that to her, the cold wind off the icy lake stinging his cheeks, the sheer drop from the Astronomy Tower seeming to end in a fathomless darkness in the deep winter night.
It’s a large volume carefully bound in red velvet, with gold stamped lettering. Draco gingerly opens it, scanning the table of contents.
“Harry? Is that you?” It’s Lucy, coming from the pantry. Harry’s heart starts to pound, and he grabs Draco’s arm, pulling him off the counter. He crouches down and quickly scoops up the book, then follows after Harry.
“Nothing happened, exactly,” Ron says.
Potions with Professor Slughorn, highly selective
“That’s what got me so confused,” Hermione continues animatedly, her mind whirring a minute faster than the words could come out of her mouth. “He did say that he could never
"I'm gonna–just..." Draco jerked his thumb in some direction, never good at acting discreet. Pansy barely paid attention to him, and said goodbye half heartedly. Blaise, on the other hand, watched Draco go with sharp eyes, and a little too much clarity.
Mrs Weasley has become so anxious that she does not say a word, only retrieving the letter and offering a small treat to the owl, who takes it gracefully but remains on the windowsill, looming over them.
Pansy didn't say anything, too wrapped up in Blaise’s honey brown eyes. Draco let his gaze slide back on Harry, like it had been trying to all night.
Draco, on the other hand, didn’t fare as well as he had hoped. He thought his power and status as Pureblood would bring a flock of followers. Instead, his opposition to the charming, well-known Boy Who Lived would bring him more hate than fear. He was left with a few loyal followers in Slytherin, but other than that, he was unpopular and shunned.
“You heard me.” Pansy sighs, tired of beating around the bush. “She hasn’t figured it out yet, but Hermione’s the brightest witch of the century. Sooner or later she’ll connect those dots and you will have some explaining to do.”
“Merlin, Hermione,” Harry mutters, his voice suggesting that he’s not really there, something not unusual recently. Whenever Ron or Hermione try to talk with him, he shuts the conversation down with a cold efficiency that has scared Ron, at least, from ever trying again.
“Well, with me you can have both.” Pansy sashays across the room to the section of clothes displaying her latest arrivals. Pansy expertly sifts through the racks, draping any she likes over her shoulder. Hermione watches attentively a few feet away.
“It was somewhat spontaneous,” Ginny explains, blushing.
Harry sighs, and wraps an arm around Draco’s shoulders.
Harry’s heart leaps into his throat. He places his hand hesitantly on the curve of Hermione’s stomach. They both hold their breaths.
Her parents can’t tell a difference, though they are a little confused at how
“My loves,” he murmurs, oblivious to the tension, moving to kiss Pansy on the top of her head and then hugging Harry, leaning into his embrace indulgently. “How was Granger?”
They pull apart when Draco needs to breathe, and Harry curses, his chest rising and falling rapidly, leaning his forehead on Draco’s. It’s almost too much, after all this time, to kiss and to touch each other like it’s the first time, like they hadn’t nearly done just this that night after the bar, that they hadn’t been both waiting and dreaming and
At this Harry goes silent, then he calls over the bartender. “Two shots of vodka.” Draco raises his eyebrows, and Harry shrugs.
Maybe he could try to pinpoint it, the very catalyst of it all. A sunny morning during the golden days of Autumn, a fresh new school year after the terrible war.
“Mr Malfoy,” Harry murmurs, reluctantly.
He takes a step forward, and Draco’s head jerks up at the sound, eyes wide and frightened. Harry reveals himself in the dim light of a nearby sconce. Draco straightens himself when he sees it’s Harry, as if in preparation to defend himself, like invisible armor.
He has a reason to be here, but he doesn’t know it yet. He is older, that he does know. Everything goes calmer, stiller, like a Muggle photograph. Harry walks over to the edge and suddenly he remembers.
They were all on the couch, drinking wine, Pansy between them, the thin straps of her top slipping down her shoulders. Draco pressed his hand subtly on her thigh, so that she would know his thoughts, and she barely smiled, barely changed expression, and Harry remained ignorant, flushed from the wine, trying to pull his eyes away from the curve of Pansy’s neck, the delicate breadth of her collarbone.
Harry is walking up the stairs. It’s dark, but the moon casts everything in an eerie glow. His steps are silent as they continue up the endless staircase, up and up and up, an indefinite amount of time that feels like infinity but also just a second. He wonders where he is going, even though he already knows, like a premonition.
Ginny shrugs when Ron and Hermione look at her, baffled. “Dean’s waiting.” She leaves them with a grim smile like she knows something they don't, striding over to Dean who is sitting across the common room with Seamus. Dean smiles at her and Ginny kisses him briefly, sitting beside him on the couch.
Draco throws his hands up. “Honestly, this is ridiculous. Of course it's illegal. Who would want to live like that?”
Hermione hears the words as if underwater, and she’s not quite sure they make any sense at all. “But Ginny…”
“Yes. And then Hermione for—”
“Women?”
Their mouths ghost against each other, Draco’s teeth lightly scraping his bottom lip, hands fingering Harry’s curls, pulling so that his neck prickles. His hands inch farther up, searching his breastbone, the hollow above his collarbone, the movement of his throat like a trigger beneath his fingertips.
“Lavender…” Ron comes up with a million reasons not to stay, but compared to Lavender’s plump lips, her wispy blonde hair floating like golden sunshine around her heart-shaped face, and above all—perhaps even the only real attraction—her willingness, eagerness, and simple availability, made Ron hesitate.
“Do you have a guest?” Harry asks.
“Pardon me, Headmistress, I could not help but notice the damage done to Gryffindor Tower. Where will the Gryffindor house find accommodations?”
She opens the door.
“But?”
“It’s dangerous, and I have plenty of enemies as it is.” Harry pauses, and turns away, as if about to leave. “But if you don’t want to, that’s a different story. Just say the word, and I’ll never speak of it again.”
He half-smiles. “You’re too good for me. We both know it.”
“If you let me…” Harry begins.
She turns. Draco closes the door behind him, looking at her puzzled. The buttons on his shirt are off by one, though Pansy doesn’t point that out.
“How do I look?” Hermione asks, and Pansy’s head whips up. She gasps, and Hermione flushes, but doesn’t shy way, instead placing her hands confidently on her hips that flare out in the figure hugging pants.
When Ron’s gone down the hall and she hears their bedroom door open and close, she reaches for the button on her suit jacket.
“I could ask you the same thing,” Harry replies coolly. “Would you really have gone home with that man?”
“Not in the least,” Draco says coldly.
Harry did not expect it, and he remains still under Draco’s touch. He had all these doubts and worries about this exact moment, but now that it is happening, Harry cannot think at all, he can only feel. A hand finds his waist. His hand slides up Draco’s arm, fitting against his neck, trembling. Their lips move haltingly, hesitantly, warm where the rest of the world stays cold.
“Well, it is understandable. Professors of core classes under normal circumstances only teach First through Seventh Years, but this year they will also teach Eighth Years. Thus, they have lowered the number of students allowed to take their classes.”
Harry and Malfoy seem to be the only couple not quite joining in on the festivities, alternating turns drinking from the bottle, looking around the room, barely exchanging words, though this is mostly Harry’s fault with his short replies.
Hermione glances briefly at her watch before turning around, ready to find out what’s taking him so long, when Draco pops into existence in the middle of her office, coffee mug in hand, looking like he just rolled out of bed.
“You know what,” Draco says, his eyes revealing a worry which he hides by lightly shoving Harry’s shoulder. But Harry catches his wrist with his Seeker reflexes before it can slide away. Draco’s pulse thrums under his fingers.
Ron Weasley, are partnered with
“He said he kept falling over the Astronomy Tower, like Dumbledore did. And he also said something about finding another world, and then he mentioned death being an adventure. He sounded mental, Hermione. Mental.”
"Who are you looking for?"
“I trust you are well?” Mrs Malfoy asks politely. Harry nearly starts, being quite surprised she has continued the conversation.
Ginny says with a grin, touching Hermione’s arm affectionately. “Sometimes I forget we aren’t still sixteen and at Hogwarts.” Her smile falters, just a little. It hurt Hermione to see it then, just as it does now. The war took so much it’s hard to find something it left whole and unscarred, even something as beautiful and joyful as new life.
“We shouldn’t,” Harry whispers, pulling Ginny into the boy’s locker rooms, still out of breath from their Quidditch practice. Harry had just ordered the rest of the team to fly a few more laps and to put away equipment before dragging Ginny off on the pretense of a serious strategy discussion.
Draco looks away to hide the tears that well up in his eyes. He looks at the clock above the couch, and gasps.
Harry did not know what to think about Draco. Ever since he switched to their side, Draco has been a complete mystery to Harry. He was kind and sensitive where Harry had expected him to be cruel, like with Sirius’ death, but harsh and unforgiving where Harry had expected guilt or even pity, like with his own parents. Draco was resilient and surprisingly daring when protecting them, but deeply insecure and hesitant when receiving affection for it. He had a sharp wit when it came to insulting Harry’s unruly curls in the morning, but he flushed bright red when Harry complimented his.
“Ginevra?” Draco suggests.
Draco takes a deep breath before knocking on the door.
And that, my friends, is why Draco Malfoy died in his Eighth Year of Hogwarts, or at least, why Pansy was really, really mad at him for a month and only really forgave him for it five years later when he and Potter finally got married.
“Why?” Harry asks, though he could probably hazard a guess. Even the thought of Draco doing such a thing makes his stomach twist nauseatingly. “Tell me what’s going on.”
All questions disappeared the moment fingers brushed his neck, and a hand cupped his jaw. His heart drummed in his chest, his ears, his lips. When their soft breath ghosted his cheek, white static drowned out any sounds.
“Yes, you have me,” Draco whispers, his throat constricting.
He hears footsteps upstairs, and then Pansy appears at the top of the staircase, wrapped in a dark green robe and slippers, her face makeup free except for a faded tint on her lips.
Harry smiles, tracing Draco’s cheek. “I love you too.”
“But you die.”
“I’ll have a comprehensive plan by tonight. I’d love for you to look it over, of course, and offer your expertise,” Hermione says, rolling up the floor plans and storing it, then trudging up the stack of paperwork that will have to be completed. She stops when she notices Draco staring at her.
“Why should I? It seems the only person in my way...is you. If you won’t let me do this, well, you leave me no choice.”
“Yes,” Harry whispers. His throat feels dry and he takes a long gulp of the champagne, then passes it to Malfoy, who looks away from Harry, eyes wandering over the groups of students.
“The wealthy but secretly emotionally complex and intellectually cultivated heartthrob, of course.”
He hears a ruffle behind his curtains, and Draco goes still, grabbing his wand reflexively.
Blaise shrugs. “For the most part, not at all.” He smiles deviously, and with a flat hand glides up and down the curve of Pansy’s bare hip. “I find women the more sensual sex.”
Draco nods slowly, his body heavy like he’s sinking, a strong current pulling him to the bottom of a dark sea. “Right.”
“They’re teenagers, Ron, just like the rest of us,” Hermione said. Ron’s face softened.
Ron shakes his head in disbelief. “So it was Draco.”
as they like to cheer before taking shots together.
Harry bites his bottom lip. “I hope not. If it is decided by my Sixth Year marks, I’m afraid I will hardly get into much. But perhaps it is best this way.”
chosen yet?”
“It’s called a Vanishing Cabinet.” Draco runs a finger along the edge. “Hides things. People. It was used in the War a lot when someone needed to escape. This one connects to the one you saw in Borgin and Burkes. I’ve been fixing it.”
They take staircase after staircase, and Harry begins to wonder where they are going. Finally they reach the metal steps that lead to the Astronomy tower. Harry clenches his Cloak closer, praying to Merlin that he’s still small enough that his shoes won’t peek out from under.
Harry stares at her, wondering what to say. He wants to say that he chose Hogwarts as his home, but that she chose him as her son, and that the latter means more to him than anything in the world. Instead he says, “Thank you, Mrs Weasley. I greatly appreciate your advice, and I will write to you when we arrive.”
“Just visiting. Don’t like to be away from Mum too long at a time, you know.”
Draco looks at him under lidded, curious eyes. “Are you nervous?”
Draco kiss him again, more insistently, his tongue grazing Harry’s like the petal of a flower, soft like silk. His hand still moves against his stomach. Harry can barely stand it. His own hands flatten over the slim curve of Draco’s shoulders, down his back, sliding underneath the hem of his shirt. They keep kissing, their hands searching each other’s skin, that sea of intimacy, searching without knowing what they might find.
Harry looks stunned. “But I thought you could, I don’t know, speed up the process?”
“And he’s already forcing you to choose now, isn’t he?” Pansy asks, and her eyes are full of pity. Draco looks down, hating that she's right, and knowing it doesn't change a damn thing. “I really wish you would stay away from him.”
He would survive, of course, but his life would mean nothing. It would be bleak, colorless, futile. Each day would last an eternity, each sleep a blink of an eye. Not even Pansy would be able to console that loss.
Merlin, she is so beyond jealous now.
“Oh, it went well! You were right about that basement.”
This makes Ginny wince, and she reluctantly sits down in the love seat beside them. She’s reminded of her horrible experience in first year with Tom Riddle’s diary. She remembers Harry dying from the Basilisk fang, and the way he looked at her as he told her to save herself.
“Well, then, so will I,” Draco says, his voice shaking. Then suddenly he shouts, “
“No, sir.”
“Come on—” Draco frowns. “Well, I suppose she did. Now that you mention it, she did seem quite interested in Harry.”
“Me too.” Harry sighs and wraps an arm around Ginny’s shoulders. “I miss you.”
“I know,” Harry replies, and the memory of Dumbledore falling flashes through his mind, except this time it’s not Dumbledore, it’s him, falling and falling and falling, into another world.
“Come spying on my Potions shop?” Draco asks.
“My move?” Harry echoes, his heart suddenly pounding like a Bludger trapped in his chest.
“Secondly, Astronomy was also listed as a mandatory course, and will be taught by the centaur Firenze. He has agreed only to teach Eighth Years, and you shall find that his teaching style will be quite different than his previous classes. I only hope that his course will open your eyes to each other as much as to the stars above.
Harry raises his glass high, and he looks straight at Draco, longingly.
“You and Ginny, of course,” Hermione says, though seeing Harry visibly relax as if in relief makes her sound the opposite of confident in her intuition. “You know, the other day, we saw her kissing Dean. I had said more to hurt Ron than anything else that she was dating him now.”
“How do you feel?” Draco asks. For a second he regrets asking, but Draco also knows he’s the only person that will listen. Harry stays silent for so long that Draco thinks he won’t respond.
Draco appears on an apartment doorstep, a blue ward shimmering in front of the door, one hand gripping his briefcase and the other on his wand, just in case. The apartment complex seems modern and yet not overly ornate, the architecture and style subtle in its elegance, a sign of more wealth, not less; somehow Draco expected Harry to be living elsewhere.
“Oh that’s not too bad,” Ron says, grinning. He slings an arm around Hermione’s shoulders, who rolls her eyes. “Wanna get cuffed, babe?”
“Not more than me,” Pansy says with a grin of her own. “But I agree. From what I’ve heard, Ginny is quite good in bed.” She pauses, thinking. “What about Cho from Ravenclaw? She’s been in a state since that Diggory boy died—and who wouldn’t be over a gorgeous face like that?—but still, did you see her at the Yule Ball?”
“I came across it in a book,” Harry says quietly, “in the restricted section.”
Hermione surfaces from her Pensieve, thoughts clouding her head. She knows this is the memory, somehow, the last piece to the puzzle, but nothing made any sense, and if anything, she’s more confused than before.
Ginny stares at her for a moment longer, so stunned she feels no surprise at all, then returns to her textbook. Because she’s right. Ginny is not ready for something else, something new, especially not as new as Luna would be. Harry still lingers on her mind, and there’s that tingling feeling at the base of her neck that warns of an impending doom.
Harry falls beside him, numb. So this is what it feels like when the world ends….
But Ginny supposes that’s the terrible beauty of the past—she’ll never know.
“Well, what’s yours?” Harry asks.
Ron holds up Rose gently. “I gotcha in the end, didn’t I?”
Draco nods. Harry gets up, helping Draco up off the couch—and it's too late, their hands touch, and Draco can’t stand it, can’t wait another minute, pulling a suddenly quiet, almost solemn Harry closer, kissing him without pretense.
Harry stepped forward, and without even realizing it, his hand reached out and traced the curve of the sparrow’s wing. Draco shivered beneath his touch but didn’t stop him.
“I’d like to make a toast,” Harry begins, his voice soft. He clears his throat. “It’s been about ten years since the Second War started. I think about it a lot, we all do, around holidays, those we’ve lost, and it feels as if it were just yesterday when our whole world fell apart.”
“Actually, Ronald, for your information, I could care less either way!” Hermione shouts.
“About Draco.”
Red. Red fading into water.
Soon the dinner and probable awkwardness can't be avoided, and everyone sits down on the magically extended dining table. Harry sits between Ginny and Hermione, with Luna beside the former and Ron beside the latter. Molly and Arthur take the head and tail of the table, with the rest of the Weasleys and other guests scattered throughout with their partners and plus ones.
It reminds Hermione of her conversation with Pansy, that memory so vibrant it quickly faded away.
The doors swing open, rattling on the frame. Harry rushes in, disheveled, and sits down at an empty seat near the back, only a few seats down from Draco. Hermione and Ron sigh, shake their heads, but Draco sees them smile at him, their eyes all fond. Draco just doesn’t understand it.
She slowly pulls back the curtain just an inch.
A heavy silence blankets the room, so that the only thing heard are the fluttering wings of Cornish pixies. Then Draco murmurs, “A way into the castle.”
“This is certainly a surprise,” Hermione says, grinning. They take a moment to examine the rings. Hermione is shown the engagement bands up close, and sees the inscription
“You need a shave,” Draco whispers, rubbing his cheek against Harry’s jaw, before biting the skin there. Harry hisses and nudges him away with his head, then ducking and kissing him hard so that his head hits the wall, but Draco only growls and wraps his arms more tightly around Harry’s waist, bringing him closer.
Silence. Good.
She had felt something with Pansy, something undefinable, almost unexplored, which probably was undefinable
He looks, and his heart stops. It’s Katie Bell, fully recovered. Harry can’t help himself. He looks across the Hall at the Slytherin table, making eye contact with Draco, who is deathly pale. Harry scrambles out of his seat and approaches Katie, who smiles warmly when she sees him.
Harry pulls him towards him and kisses him roughly on the lips, salty from his tears, unable to see Draco so distressed, wanting to make it stop, however he can. Draco yields slightly, his body relaxing against Harry’s mouth. He kisses Draco’s jaw, then his neck, murmuring against his skin, “You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to.”
“Merlin, Harry, you scared me.” Draco narrows his eyes, tensing all over again. “Did you follow me?”
Harry walks in and a House Elf appears on the counter with a pop. It’s Lucy, a small Elf with large eyes and wrinkly skin. She’s old but still spritely. Harry has known her all his life. Indeed, in many ways, she raised him.
The classic Golden Trio in their natural habitat. Yuck.
“Please don’t follow me, Harry.” Then he’s gone, disappearing through the corridor. Harry watches him go with a sinking feeling in his stomach.
Harry passes a hand over his face, and Ron suddenly notices how exhausted he looks. “Ginny is a wonderful person. She deserves someone better than me.”
“Doesn’t he?” Draco asks bitterly. “He’s the Savior, the Chosen One. I’m the Death Eater everyone wishes had been sent to Azkaban with the rest of them.”
Malfoy has Harry pinned against the wall by his wrist, which is still tied, their champagne bottle lying half finished on the ground beside them, and one of Malfoy’s knees is pressed between Harry’s legs. Harry has the same miserable expression on his face, but Hermione realizes now that it’s not at all on account of hatred but…
“Stay out of it,” Draco snarls. “I have told you too much already.”
Draco leans back, looking at Harry. “Did we ever hate each other?”
“But how—all those times…” Harry’s voice dies in his throat.
This makes Draco flush a bright red. “Something like that.”
Harry rolls over, squinting at them before fumbling for his glasses on the nightstand. When he has them on, his face is guarded with suspicion. “Is it the Ministry?”
* * *
“Mr. Potter, do you think the Ministry is being too harsh on You Know Whose followers?” he asks in a high pitched voice, out of breath from Harry’s quick pace across the Atrium floor. He shoves the front page of the newspaper in front of Harry. At the top of the page reads in bold: PURE-BLOOD LEGACY PLUNDERED BY AUROR RAIDS.
* * *
Government with Minister Shacklebolt, highly selective
on him. In the bathroom.”
“But?”
Hermione and Ron stand next to each other in an awkward silence. These silences have only grown since Lavender Brown keeps following Ron around. He doesn’t understand why, although naturally Harry always smirks at him when Ron brings it up. Harry has always been more perceptive than Ron, especially when it comes to other people. Sometimes cruelly perceptive, dissecting a person’s motivation or insecurity with a few witty remarks and that razor sharp smile.
“I guess I wouldn’t mind a few shots. Feels like I’ve been working non stop what with that bloody potion you have me making,” Draco says, then narrows his eyes. “Has this been your move all along? To get me so exhausted that I go to a bar and you corner me there?”
Harry slides his hand across Draco’s skin, down his back, across his stomach, up his chest, tracing the bones, the muscles that tense under his touch. He loves touching Draco like this, with no intention of doing more, just a simple caress, watching Draco’s eyelids droop, then close, then flutter open again, a sleepy smile curving across his face.
“Hermione’s a romantic,” Harry interjects, his green eyes sparkling, as if he knows something about Hermione that Ron does not; this is probably true, as Ron has always been hyper aware of the closeness between Harry and Hermione that Ron has failed to achieve.
Draco goes still inside his arms, and he says nothing for a long time. Then, “It would be easier if I had never been born.”
“It’s not,” Malfoy muttered, just before bringing the cigarette up to his lips again. The gesture was carefree and languid, like a cat’s yawn or a lover’s caress. Both intimate and remote.
Ginny knows that Draco and Harry have been spending time together again recently, that much is certain. She had hoped that this time…
“Oh not this again,” Ron exclaims, exasperated. “Malfoy is too young to be a Death Eater.”
Harry could not sleep in this room. Not tonight. He already felt anxious as it was, no need to add a sleepless night.
“But Mr Potter,” Longbottom says, “you defeated the most powerful sorcerer in the world! The auror program will not spare a second glance at a poor mark once they see your name.”
Harry’s green eyes sparkle in the dim firelight. “There’s a dream I have over and over again. I’m on the Astronomy Tower, and I’m falling over the edge, like my—like Dumbledore did, that night. And then I wake up in another world, and I have everything I always wanted.” He looks almost dreamy, his mouth subconsciously lifting into a smile, and his eyes glazed over like he could see something Ron couldn't.
“Yes?”
Harry shakes his head. "It's complicated. We...could never get married. Ginny needed someone steadier, calmer, less dark and heavy. She was there for me when I needed her most, and then after the war, we tried to make it work. But people change, she as much as I."
and asking for a Slytherin tie. How simple, really, and yet how complicated, and dangerous.
Ron scratches at his sweater, the large letter R a bright red against the woven green. He loves his mother dearly, but her knitting could be more...comfortable.
“Yes,” Draco says, his voice breaking.
charm that rips away the Cloak from Harry’s body, then an
his firebolt and flew after Draco. They nearly collided in the sky, and Harry chased after Draco, and when Harry caught him, Draco chased after Harry.
She hears Harry and Draco begin to stir from the couch, clearing the dishes on the table, and slowly moving upstairs. They are lingering, she knows, because they can all sense the sun setting on their time together.
“I hadn’t expected this, is all,” Draco says, following Harry over to the couch. They sit down and Draco cuts himself a slice of Manchego.
Harry looks confused. “Aren’t you dating Dean?”
He sees Hermione laughing with Blaise. She notices Harry’s arrival and sees his hand linked with Malfoy’s, so Harry quickly untangles them, careful not to trigger a refill. Ron is currently watching Pansy chug the entire bottle, his mouth falling open, as a small crowd forms to watch and cheer her on. When she lowers the bottle to catch her breath, Ron unexpectedly tugs at their wrist tie.
“Oh.” Draco reminds himself that he doesn’t care about Harry’s life anymore, and should stop asking questions lest Harry gets the wrong idea. “Lead the way, then.”
She nods, and beckons him over. “This might come as a shock to you, but Harry had a secret relationship at Hogwarts that we didn’t know about.”
“Ginny,” he says brokenly, and he leans in, needing, falling apart, the shards of a love story that was never meant to last.
“Don’t listen to her, darling.” He kisses Harry’s cheek. “She doesn’t understand.”
“You never stop being a Death Eater,” Harry says coldly, and his voice sounds so different than last night, like two different Harrys are trapped in the same body, one light and one dark.
“But Headmistress,” Weasely begins, then stops at one look from Professor McGonagall.
Somehow younger Harry looks the most different and yet the most similar to his older self. Hermione scans his indifferent, almost bored expression. Her younger self reprimands Ron for not tying his tie correctly, and a flash of irritation passes over Harry’s face, before smoothing to his careful aloofness. It hurts Hermione to see it more than she’d like to admit.
How quickly had Draco slipped through his fingers? And, if he thinks about it, did he ever really have him to begin with?
“Well, I must be off.”
“Nightmares?” Harry asks. “You know I could ask Lucy to make you another Draught.”
“I’ll sleep downstairs, it’s alright.”
“Then help me get it, Draco!”
But he wouldn’t put anything past Harry at this point.
“Madam Malkin,” Harry says with a slight bow.
They drink over half the bottle and pick at some more of the cheese and crackers, continuing to talk about nonsense with the easy, always potentially flirty rhythm which Draco remembers fondly of in their late night conversations at Hogwarts.
“But where are you going?” Ron asks.
Draco sets his glass down.
“I’ll be back late,” Draco says bitterly. “Don’t wait up for me. And don’t worry either.”
“You thought if you didn’t ask it wasn’t going to happen?”
Draco Apparates to Harry’s apartment doorstep as he usually does to work on the Sad Nightingale at late hours of the night. Though it has been a few days since last coming here, as the potion required exactly seven minutes over seven days of boiling on low heat with no added ingredients.
“She says he’s a mess. Won’t get out of bed. Depressed. She’s worried that…” Pansy hesitates, her hands squeezed together in front of her.
Not since...
“Really? I found it hilarious,” Ginny replies, hugging Harry when he comes over to her. Something she would never have expected from Harry if she didn’t know him intimately is that he shows affection very physically, a lot of touching and hugging. She supposes it makes up for the lack of affection in other parts of him.
He remembers Harry asking questions about Pansy, how they became friends, if they ever dated in school. Draco never knew how to respond, in part because his friendship with Pansy is, well, complicated.
“Well, thank you for that.”
When she leaves, Harry, Weasley, and Miss Granger sit beside the fire. Weasley rings for tea, and a few moments later, they all hold steaming cups of tea on little porcelain saucers.
“Sparkly?” Harry sighs, then forces a smile. “Nevermind.”
“Is it that you can’t forgive him, or that you don’t want to?”
Tonight Slytherin is hosting. Harry feels less apprehension than perhaps is expected for such a notorious House. His reasoning is that the aftermath of the war and the mass arrests and raids from the Ministry have subdued any desire to take revenge, though in some cases more on account of fear rather than change of heart.
“What are we doing, Draco?” she whispers. “What am I doing?”
“Yes, Mr Potter.”
They both hear Pansy walk downstairs, but Draco was about to fall asleep, and so he does not move. Harry kisses Draco’s cheek, thinking he is asleep, and leaves their room. When he’s gone, Draco opens his eyes, sitting up.
“I admire your insistence,” Weasley says, “but I will not be taking any of those three classes if my life depended upon it.”
“What he means to say is thank you.” Harry smiles at Miss Granger, who sighs, but smiles.
“What does he mean by,
“Oh Harry’s here!” Ron grins at him, but Harry doesn’t return it. He sits down in the empty seat across from Draco, with Ron and Hermione at the ends of the table.
“But have all of them gone mad, sir?” Harry asks, with that laser focus intent that has always slightly terrified Hermione.
“No one will get hurt this time,” Harry says, stroking Hermione’s hair with one hand. But even as he says it, he’s not sure if he believes it anymore.
“Be well, Harry.”
Draco pushes his hips forward, sighing into Harry’s touch.
He would only ever see Draco. And she had to keep his secret, because no one else would understand. No one else truly saw the darkness, the coiled green serpent in his eyes.
“I think I may understand,” Miss Granger says. Weasley and Harry share a brief look of fondness over their friend. “Yes, I believe these core classes will encompass much more than the stated subject. For instance, there is a high chance Transfigurations will be related to healing the castle. And Firenze is a centaur.”
“It can only be you.” Harry threads a hand through Draco’s hair, and it’s not like anything he could imagine, slipping through his fingers like silk, like the glowing threads of a memory.
“Tom Riddle was an orphan. Like me,” Harry says, looking at Ginny. His voice is cold, and Ginny suppresses a shiver. “Dumbledore took him under his wing.” He sounds sarcastic and bitter. This angers Ginny more than anything.
“No.” Ginny follows Harry into the kitchen. She doesn’t have many memories here. In some ways, it’s a blessing. “Portkeying and alcohol don’t mix.”
Harry cuts an unreadable glance to his father’s grave. “What if I don’t have a choice? What if I have to do it alone?”
She avoids looking at Harry, instead looking at Hermione expectantly.
He lowers back beside Harry, hugging him closer than ever before.
Harry has a standing date with Hermione for afternoon tea when Ron is away at Auror training. Ron and Hermione moved into a small countryside home after the war and got engaged shortly afterwards. Since then, Harry has lived mainly at the Burrow to give them space, and with Ginny for a brief period, before his path crossed with Draco’s one too many times and they decided to live together.
“I can’t tell you. You have to trust me, Harry.” Draco walks towards Harry slowly, stretching out his hand. “Just give me the box.”
“Oh god.”
Harry seems to calm down at that, closing his eyes. “Please don’t go.” His voice is small and tired. “This will work, I promise. We just...we shouldn’t talk about the past. Soon I won’t remember it anyway.”
The night air cools her cheeks.
“Thought about what?” Harry asks in a strained voice. Draco leans even closer, his mouth brushing Harry’s cheek as he whispers in his ear.
Taking this to be a good sign, Harry takes a deep breath, and says,
“Wait here.” She quickly walks over to the other side of the store dedicated to her famous lingerie, and heads over to one of her newer lines. She picks out her favorite one—the one she designed as an homage to a certain schoolgirl crush that has long since faded away, a mark of a simpler time and a more innocent girl, before everything she loved was crushed under the indifferent weight of the war, like a cigarette crushed under the heel of a boot.
“War hero status gone to your head a bit?”
No answer. He’s gone. Draco sighs deeply.
And sure enough, the memory begins to focus, like a camera lens honing into the main actor on screen, and the noise of the party fades to the background as Hermione and Ginny’s voices raise in volume, clear and familiar.
“Don’t follow me,” Draco growls over his shoulder, a few paces ahead of Harry, the small heels on his dress shoes clicking softly on the marble floor. But Harry continues anyway, steadily gaining on him, ignoring other wizards and witches that try to greet him.
Harry mimics, ducking his head when Draco shoves the pillow in his face.
“It will always be him,” Draco says in a low voice.
When he’s with Draco, even like this, laying beside him while he rests, wishing they could be normal and sneak into each other’s dorms without risking everything, Harry can almost fly, can almost feel eternity rushing past him like the blur of the night sky as he rides on his broomstick, a vision of stars falling like rain.
“You know how much I need it?” Harry asks sharply.
Draco goes downstairs, hyper aware that he’s still in his clothes from the night before. Merlin, what he’d do for a shower. He needs to get back home, desperately.
Dumbledore doesn't look surprised. After a moment’s silence, he says seriously, “I loved someone, Harry, once. Very much. But he was on a different path than mine. I tried to love him and also love my family, but in the end I lost both.”
“That’ll give you cancer,” Harry said automatically, and felt stupid afterwards.
to keep her by my side. So I understand you more than you know.”
He should not have agreed to this. Even at night, the early September heat lingered in the dungeon. The close walls of the closet seemed to suffocate him further, even though he couldn't see. His breath came out short and his skin felt hot. If they didn't send someone in soon, Draco decided he would leave.
Harry loses the race.
them. So at the time I thought it was a harmless crush from afar, but now I think it was something more. And...” Hermione hesitates, wondering if she should tell Ron her theory just yet.
“What?”
“No.” Harry’s shaking his head.
But still, she must go. Time has run out, and her stay here is winding down to a close. She feels it in her bones, just as the animals know when winter is coming, and so they hunker down, curling in on themselves for warmth.
, Harry—look up to you. They need you. This potion is an escape, not a solution.”
But he was wrong. Draco liked him, and asked him to come over tonight, alone. He knows Draco well, from their growing friendship over the last few years, but now he doubts whether he knows Draco at all. For what does he really know about him?
Hermione tries her hardest not to glance at the clock in the common room. It won’t do her any good. She refocuses on the Potions reading at hand, but the words blur together. With a sigh, she gives in and looks up at the large ornate clock hanging above the fireplace.
“Of course you were.” Draco sighs. “Snape is only trying to help but—”
“Are you not helping?” Pansy asks with a tense drawl, motioning to the food ready to be placed on the table.
“What?”
Because she saw him that night, looking at Draco. Those two boys, looking at each other. Two boys destined to hate each other; two boys destined to fall in love regardless. Perhaps because of it.
“I’m not going to ask what happened,” Ginny says. “I just want to know what you need from me right now.”
“Fly of course. What else?” Draco snatched the nearest broom, an old model that Harry never imagined Draco would ride, and nimbly saddled it, rocketing up into the sky.
But something about that moment stayed with Hermione, for whatever reason. It has to be important. She feels the tingling sensation she always feels when the right answer is just beyond her reach. All she has to do is reach harder.
“About an hour.” Harry kisses Draco’s forehead. “You were exhausted.”
“He’s your father,” Lucy begins, but stops and shakes her head, knowing her argument is futile. They have had this discussion many times before.
“You’re the Chose One! I know you hate it but that still means something. But people—
“Oh, stop,” Draco mutters, lightly shoving her. “You’re just jealous.”
branded him for life? And what a life it was!
“That’s why he will never know,” Hermione says tightly.
“Do you want to see it?” Draco asked hesitantly, as if he’s never shown anyone before. And perhaps he never has.
They are sitting on the couch with plush, black velvet cushions, a fire burning low, and the room illuminated by hazy candlelight. Conversation has dwindled to a pregnant silence, Harry wondering how the night will end.
…Azkaban…”
Hermione’s lips quirk. “I was going to say high fashion.”
“Potions, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Government, Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, Alchemy, and Care of Magical Creatures.”
Then everything happened in a whirlwind, and Draco's thoughts struggled to catch up as his body took over.
Without a second thought, Harry throws the blankets off his legs, slipping his feet into soft slippers, and after a moment’s deliberation, snags his Invisibility Cloak that’s tucked under his bed. Then he leaves.
“Good evening, Harry,” Draco says, stepping inside. He shrugs off his coat, as the weather had recently turned chilly. Harry takes it and sets it on a peg by the door.
“I do.”
“At first?” Ron echoes.
“What?!”
Draco winces. “Apologies. I ... slept in.”
He could only ever say yes to Harry.
Instead, Harry shook his head. “Stop feeling sorry for yourself. And I guess,” Harry felt the tips of his ears burning, which only caused him to ramble, “I guess, if you want, you could still, you know, smoke.”
With that, Hermione storms off, slamming the door to the girl’s dormitory behind her. Harry looks at Ron, stunned.
Draco stepped back, taking the wine and drinking straight from the bottle. He watched as Harry’s eyes widened when Pansy slipped out of her thong, and climbed onto Harry’s lap, sinking herself down on his cock with a loud exhale.
“Friends? Don’t be ridiculous,” Pansy says, trying to appear as flippant as possible. “After all, they hated each other.”
“Draco, listen to me—”
“Naturally,” Harry says, hoping he doesn’t sound bored or sarcastic. The man is handsome, after all, with fluffy brown hair and blue eyes, and a nondescript, pretty face. It’d be a shame to miss his shot for a night of fun just because of some stupid Muggle politics.
When she shakes her head again, Harry circles his arms around her shoulders, hugging her to his chest. After a few moments, Hermione sits back, wiping her eyes with the back of her sleeve.
“No, I really didn’t,” Katie says sadly.
“We should probably tell them,” Malfoy says in a low, caressing voice. She hears Harry make a noise of protest, and she whips her wand out on instinct. “Oh, but you don’t want to, do you? You like the game.”
me here?” Harry argues with his cold stone logic, and it infuriates Draco how right and yet how so wrong Harry can be at the same time.
Hermione bows her head to hide a satisfied smile. “Of course. I’ll see you tomorrow.” She doesn’t move until the door opens and shuts closed. Then Hermione springs up, her mind revving like a machine, an engine, the wheels and cogs turning and fitting together rapidly, parsing and collecting together all the memories she has of Harry interacting with Draco.
Harry looked up, his throat straining, making a choking noise, his green eyes bright and lost, looking at Draco but not seeing him, slipping over the edge, crying out as he came, continuing to thrust into her until she spasmed around him, and fell very still.
“Look,” Malfoy interrupts, pointing to the bottle. Harry looks and sees champagne bubbling to the top, foaming as it spills down the sides, wetting his hand. He looks up at Malfoy, whose face is much closer than before. His blue eyes look grey this close, and they stare at Harry challengingly. “Do you understand?”
“That’s funny,” Draco replies tightly, “because when it comes to
And then there’s the pitch—pristine, glistening green grass—Harry’s safe haven. The moment Draco stepped into the locker room after him, he knew that would change.
“We haven’t done anything. Your parents will be home soon and they’ll want the telly.”
“I’m sorry I didn’t tell you—”
Pansy stares into the fire, watching the flames lick the air, wondering why some people would willingly burn themselves if they knew it would only bring pain.
“I can’t lie to you, Draco,” Harry says with a horrifying honesty and relief, “I’ve wanted to kiss you the moment I saw you at the charity ball.” Harry sighs, pushing even the thought away. “But it’s too dangerous.”
Then Ravenclaw hosted last weekend. To keep it brief, Harry blacked out and does not remember a single thing, although Hermione and Ron assure him that he did nothing too embarrassing.
He stares at the liquid, a silvery blue color reminiscent of a thread of memory, then he goes back up to his room. After carefully setting the vial down on his nightstand, he goes to sleep.
But still, she tries anyway.
“Okay, I’ll try out next year,” Dean says easily. That’s the thing Ginny has found with Dean; everything is always easy. It’s part of what annoys her, which only makes her more annoyed for being annoyed about that. She should want someone easy, someone uncomplicated and adoring.
Harry pauses. If he tells Dumbledore now, Draco’s plans would be ruined, and the Dark Lord would kill him if the Ministry didn't lock him up in Azkaban first. But if he doesn’t tell Dumbledore, then…
“I had good reason not to, if you recall,” Harry points out.
“Harry.”
Hermione shakes her head, sighing. It’s too early to voice the very tentative theory she has begun forming. Not without concrete evidence. “Maybe.”
“It’s not about what I want to do,” Harry says gently, rearranging himself so as to shift more of Draco’s weight on himself. “It’s what I should do.”
Of course, Harry has been absolutely no help. He lays back on the couch, studying that bloody Map of his, as if waiting for it to reveal its secrets. Hermione can’t decide if she hates the Potions textbook or this Map more.
“I hope you are right, Mr Weasley,” Harry says sadly. “I hope you are right.”
Draco almost groans aloud. Pansy is going to
“But that’s in so long,” Lavender complains. She leans in, kissing him, the only thing they seem to do together, not that Ron minds. Her round blue eyes and long lashes give him a flirty, suggestive look. “Imagine what could happen in those long, long hours…”
Then Ron looks up at her face and smiles so lovingly, that suddenly all those wonderings and doubts and worries disappear, and her heart speaks a single name, and it’s not a question at all.
“What?”
“It’s not just dinner anymore, is it?”
“Mhm?”
“Yes,” Harry says, blushing.
“You spend many nights here with that boy,” Lucy observes gently. Harry chooses to stare at the blanket, picking at a loose thread with a focus he doesn’t feel.
“Ron, don’t you dare.”
A small statue of a snake coiled and ready to strike that serves as a direct communicator on her desk suddenly begins speaking, and Pansy drops her quill, startled. “Ms. Parkinson?” a timid voice asks. It’s a store clerk from level one.
for Merlin’s sake. Not to mention he was openly bisexual. All at once air rushed back into his lungs. His hands were clenched on Harry's arms.
Kissing awakens Harry’s body again, so that he can move, placing his hands hesitantly on Draco’s thighs, then with his pulse quickening, he dares to slip them under Draco’s shirt, flat against his skin, which dips and twists under his touch, a warm, living body rising and falling to meet him like waves at sea. He likes this, feeling Draco under his shirt, as if it were not allowed, the cloth trapping him in a third dimension that’s been created between them.
“What do you mean by that?” Weasley asks.
“I should get going to bed,” Ginny says, once again ignoring that look on Dean’s face, that admiring look that harbors some confusion on the rejection. They have been talking for over a week and she’s yet to make a move or even suggest it.
Harry shakes his head, pensively staring ahead at nothing. “No. No, his dreams feel different. Heavy, and painful. This…”
“And you never trusted me,” Draco snaps.
“No,” Draco says firmly. “Absolutely not.”
He had only ever wanted his father to be home, to treat him like his child, and not a secret weapon that could not follow him on his adventures and trips for fear of being damaged. Harry now knows with a damning certainty that Dumbledore spent many, many nights at Hogwarts instead of with him, and the ring of truth to it hurts more than anything.
The meaning is clear.
He sits up, stretches, scrubs his face, and then freezes. Memories of the night before, which had melted with his dreams, rise up in front of his mind in a tequila tainted blur. Harry kissing him like his life depended on him. Harry saying that everything is different now.
But Draco never had a reason not to trust those he loved. Pansy hopes he never will.
Miss Granger’s eyes continue rapidly reading her letter, which looks as if someone wrote a lengthy note at the bottom.
But Pansy’s question lingers in his mind.
He looks up through his lashes at Draco, his smile dangerous and dark, and Draco’s breath catches at how beautiful Harry is, his dark curls spilling over his eyes, that smooth tan skin a sea of intimacy, and those lean muscles visibly shifting underneath where his loose long sleeve clings to his arms.
“Where’s Draco?”
He looks up. The space where the
“Maybe this is too personal a subject,” Hermione says hesitantly, “but I do consider us friends.” Draco smiles, surprised.
At first, nothing. Then, lights, red and green and gold, glittering against the walls. Hermione squeezes Ron’s hand, and he squeezes back.
Harry glances sideways at Draco. “And what will you use it for?”
Draco takes one last look behind his shoulder—Harry quickly ducks in an alleyway—before slipping into a public girl’s restroom. After making sure no one sees him, Harry follows after him, quietly creeping through the tiled archway. Inside Draco stands in front of the mirrors, a velvet box laying on the counter next to the sink.
“This brings me to my next two points. As many of you saw upon arrival, the castle has sustained severe damages from the Battle fought on its grounds. Some have criticized my decision to allow students to see such ruin at a place that many of you call home. However, I do not wish to protect you from the tragedy, because, indeed, all of you in some shape or form have already witnessed―if not experienced first-hand―the suffering that took place last May. As such, I see an opportunity for all of us to take a hand in healing this castle, in the hopes that it may also bring us comfort in times of sorrow, and reunite us in a common purpose.”
Why is it that the things he wants most could only exist in another world?
Harry looks at her with a dangerous ferocity, understanding that she’s beginning to pick apart the riddle. “Hermione? What is it?”
“I understand,” Draco says. “I feel the same way.”
She turns, pats down her hair, and straightens her suit. Draco stands near the door, the floor plans in hand. Hermione smiles, though all she can see now is a younger Draco, looking at Harry thoughtfully in a Potions classroom.
Harry blocks the spell and prepares to strike back, but Draco has lunged behind the bathroom stalls, and flings another hex his way that slams him off his feet.
“Some things never change,” Harry says darkly.
“Everyone has secrets.”
Ginny's words from the memory echo in Hermione's mind.
* * *
Outside the sky twinkled with stars, and the moon shined bright and round. There was a slight breeze, hints of a harsh winter to come. Harry and Draco walked side by side, down the cobblestone street until they were alone.
“Well, that’s why you have friends to remind you,” Ron jokes.
No, Draco should move on, live without him, find someone else to love who will choose him without shame, that soul-eating darkness which never truly goes away.
Regulus Arcturus Black. There was a faint light under the doorframe. Draco must still be up, like him. The decision was made in that instance, but he only moved towards the door a few seconds afterwards. He knocked lightly.
“You’re still young, Harry,” Ron says awkwardly, feeling the dark turn this conversation has taken. “I was just wondering if you were even planning to settle down. I mean, you have time, but…”
She pauses on her way to the stairs, her mind already drifting to long blonde hair, blue eyes, and soft, searching hands; the hands of an angel, of a rosy-fingered dawn. Harry’s voice breaks through like a blade cutting water.
“Could’ve told you that,” Harry mutters, earning a sharp elbow in his ribs.
“Who do you think did this?” Hermione asks, sitting down and tying back her hair. She feels frumpy today, and worried. Rose woke up screaming with a fever and she and Ron had spent all night trying to lower it.
“From your perspective, perhaps.” Harry pauses, half smirking. “The sun sets later from the top of a tower than the depths of a dungeon.”
“Hermione and Ron told you, then.” He sounds bitter.
“See you tomorrow, my dear,” Lucy says, patting his arm.
“Fucking me, of course.” Then Draco leans back, struggling to keep straight.
“We all have a choice, Harry,” Ginny says slowly, sadly. She knows he’s thinking of someone else, someone who has to make that choice, the hardest choice, when both choices lead to heartbreak no matter which way you cut it.
Draco stares at him in shock. “What did you just do?”
She stands up, smiling at him. Hermione and Ron stay silent, watching the scene unfold. Harry carefully searches her face, but she knows he won’t find anything except her smile.
“You don’t know that for sure.”
“We’re not friends, Potter.”
“I did have a choice,” Draco says slowly, sounding almost sober. “Not an easy one, that’s for sure. But I had a choice. You always have a choice.” He pauses, looking down. “I’m not ashamed of those choices Harry. I’m ashamed of our secret. Of letting myself be kept a secret.”
“The pants could fit better…” Pansy murmurs. “It’s a classic pant suit. Can’t go wrong. But I assume you have plenty of black clothes already. Perhaps a bolder choice would be more worth your while. Try the champagne pink.”
Harry stares at her as she drags Ron away, then cries after her, “What constitutes
“I grew up here, during the school year.” Harry looks at his knuckles, at the fading white scar on his left hand, spelling
“Stop, I’m serious!” Draco shouts, and his hands are trembling. He takes the box from Harry’s hands with a quick motion, gripping it to his chest.
and all now
Quite the selection to choose from, I must say. I would love to be able to take ten of them. Do you think Headmistress McGonagall would allow me to?”
“No,” Draco says quickly.
“How do you do, Mr Longbottom?” Harry asks politely. “Please, do not stand on my account.”
Draco grinned. “Jealous?”
“Not that much time?” Harry finishes wryly.
He also has his date with Granger for afternoon tea today. Draco scowls at the thought. She always says something to spoil his boyfriend’s mood.
That look was the same one Draco had when Harry had walked into their office the other day. The same stunned quiet, the same rising pride, the same utter hopelessness, all at the same time. Perhaps it is a unique trait in Slytherins? But somehow Hermione doubts that. This is something else, perhaps not unrelated, but certainly deeper, and absolutely more important.
He must have froze because they stopped kissing him, pulling back. Draco brought his hands up to their face, feeling the stubble on their jaw. His hands trembled as he worked his way down to their chest, which was flat and muscular.
Malfoy did, and his pants with them; he stood there and for an instant Harry just looked at him, thin and scarred in the eerie light. Harry had seen all his dorm mates naked more times than he could count and his Quidditch mates more than that, but he had never stood and looked like this. Malfoy had long, thin toes and skinny legs and a dark blonde tangle of hair around his cock, which was dark with arousal; he was thin all around, sharp elbows and collarbones, his chin pointed in a sort of challenge as he stared right back.
Slughorn actually chuckled out loud. 'Don't know your own limits, do you, Harry? It's not every day a powerful wizard like you comes along. Well, I'm sure you didn't mean it.'
Harry stops next to him, a step or so away; he stands there, hands in his pockets, and waits.  The sunlight spills over them, the sky painfully blue.  After a time, Harry realizes that Malfoy is not going to do anything, and they are just standing there, staring at each other.
“It’s only Rita Skeeter, back to her old ways,” Hermione said grimly from across the table. “Oh, Harry, don’t read that rubbish.”
'I'll send a report,' Hermione says with perhaps a bit too much enthusiasm.  Harry winces as he moves back towards the stairs.  Receiving reports is far too official for his taste.
'And I'm sorry,' Malfoy said, sweet as could be, 'that you, Potter, were born with shoulders the size of a gorilla, and therefore there is no room for one of mine in this bed, much less the rest of my body.'
'Just walk away from him, Harry,' he could practically hear Hermione admonish in his head. 'He isn't worth it. Let it go.'
Her eyes filled with tears. 'I wish I believed you.'
Tonks was, for some reason, snickering. “I probably scared you half to death,” she snorted, having to stop and catch her breath. “Well, now I feel ridiculous. We can talk Defense, if you want.”
Harry was kissing him again before he even knew what he was doing; it was desperate, lewd, their mouths sliding hotly and Draco’s tongue in his mouth, him grinding down against him, breathing hard at the shock of it. He pressed a wet kiss to Draco’s jaw and slid down, shoved aside his robes and the shirt beneath to get at the sharp rise of his collarbone, the hollow just above.
The man spins around, and Harry can't help thinking of him as the disheveled, stooped and dirty version of Dumbledore.  His grey, straggly beard hangs to mid-chest, and he is dressed as if he were cleaning the bar before realizing he was late for the wedding and didn't have time to change.  In fact, Harry is sure that he sees an old, dirty rag hanging out of Aberforth's pocket.
They went to the Room of Requirement.
There was silence in the Great Hall, then a smattering of applause. 'Blimey,' said Ron. 'You'd think it'd be happy that You-Know-Who was defeated, wouldn't you?'
Harry deliberated for a moment before reaching into his pocket and drawing out the little dragon. “What do you think of this?”
“What happened?” Harry asked, hating the grave look on Ron’s face. He sat down in the chair beside Ron, while Hermione perched at the foot of the bed. Hermione had not had time to tell him very much as they rushed to the hospital wing. And Malfoy had not waited to hear more; he had bolted as soon as Hermione spoke, face chalky.
“But who will teach Defense?” Hermione asked, at the same time Ron groaned, “Please don’t let it be Snape.”
'That isn't true,' Harry exclaimed. 'Ginny, why would you think that? Of course I want you to be, to be involved, I do.'
And, irrationally, he remembered Draco drawing close to him, rubbing his thumb across Harry’s lip, saying softly, “Lupin’s waiting.”
Ron begins, 'Malfoy, if you're going behind our backs—'
“What have you done, then?” Ron hissed. “So that’s why you don’t think Malfoy’s the spy—because he’s got his mouth on your cock all the time—"
Malfoy's eyes darted quickly away. Harry took this as a yes.
Harry hadn't been this close to Malfoy since they had last touched, and now, lying horizontally beside him, he realized just how pointy Draco Malfoy was. One of Malfoy's knees was digging into Harry's thigh, his shoulder was a hard uncomfortable angle in Harry's side, and when Harry shifted to get away from Malfoy, he almost toppled off the bed. In the attempt to right himself, he ran straight into Malfoy's hip.
“My mother—"
“Hey, Hagrid, what’s in Wales?”
‘Comforting,’ Harry said, half-smiling at her.
'Yes, I think once he was sentenced,' Hermione said hastily. 'I wanted to tell you, believe me, I did—'
Harry laughed. 'Caught on at last, has he?'
'Harry Potter,' he says, looking at his wand instead of Harry.  'Well, well.  I knew you'd turn up sooner or later.  It seems to me, the last time I saw you, you insisted rather rudely that you were—'
He glanced at the desk again: now that he thought of it, several of the newspapers lying scattered on the desk were recent and had his face on them, headlines blaring HARRY POTTER TRIUMPHS OVER HE WHO MUST NOT BE NAMED and SAVIOR OF WIZARDING WORLD TO RECEIVE ORDER OF MERLIN. This one in particular seemed to have made Malfoy so incensed that half the article was ripped clean away.
Ron stared at him in shock. Hermione gave him a knowing but unhappy look.
Harry knew he was flushing, and when Madam Rosmerta set his Butterbeer on the table, he gave her a profoundly grateful look. Uncapping the bottle, he took several swigs of it before he was finally able to look at Tonks again.
'Spells,' Malfoy said vaguely. 'What do you want, Potter? What are you doing, popping up everywhere?'
“Here,” Harry said, before he realized the words were leaving his lips, “ring them up, I’ll get them,” and he dug in his pocket for the coins he knew were there. The shop owner gave him a relieved look and immediately set about making change.
you, Potter," Malfoy hissed, so enraged that Harry almost backed down. He had never seen Malfoy quite this upset, even at the end of fifth year. "I
Even in early September, Azkaban is cold; it might be the ocean, or years of Dementors, but Harry starts shivering the instant he sets foot on the island, two Aurors on either side.  Malfoy, grumpier than usual, is in the company of four more, back at the station.  There is enough fog, rising around the small island and its forbidding, towered prison, that Harry can't even see the other shore.  He has a sudden, irrational fear that the Aurors will leave him there and won't return.
Draco gave him a guarded look. "Anyway, I suppose it's a good thing you didn’t, or you'd be watching the Weasel and Granger snog each other all the time. Now if that isn't a sight to induce self-mutilation, I don't know—"
'I don't have any control over that,' Harry argued.
Hermione frowned at them. “Well, it turns out that it was
'I'm coming, Potter.'  The corner of Malfoy's mouth twitches.  'It'd make the Veela too happy if I didn't.'
'Yeah,' Harry said. 'Yeah, okay.' After a moment, he added, 'Good night, Malfoy.'
He shut his eyes and was asleep in minutes.
'Oh, of course, I usually skip meals and lie awake nights and think about death all the time,' Malfoy snapped. 'That makes perfect sense, Potter!'
He also received an envelope from Mrs. Creevey, holding a letter that she seemed to have cried on more than once and a handful of glossy photographs. Harry did not want to look at them, but he did anyway: they were of him, and his friends, and other people from Gryffindor, people whose names he didn't know but thought he should. He looked at them until he felt sick, because he realized that it had been two months and he still didn't know if Parvati Patil was alive or dead.
“Percy,” Ron mouthed to Harry, who nodded in understanding. If the Weasleys had thought Fudge’s admittance of Voldemort’s return would shame Percy into remembering his family, it had done nothing of the sort. Harry had seen him in the background of a picture in the Prophet the other week, and he had been straightening his glasses nervously, paging through his notebook as dutifully as ever.
Harry didn’t need telling twice.
'Potter!' Malfoy squeaks.  'What are you doing?'
For a moment, Harry says nothing.  Then he yelps, 'WHAT?'
, Potter,' he said at last, pronouncing the word as if it were poisonous.
'Oh, you see how he acts around teachers when he needs something from them, Ron. He's just trying to get on her good side. Besides, he's probably glad, I'm sure he's grateful that someone treats him decently, and he wanted to thank her with dinner.'
would be around
“But what does that have to do with Voldemort?” Harry said, after a moment.
Harry blinked. It took him a moment to recall what Malfoy was ranting about. 'Wait, you're still upset about the House Cup?' he demanded at last. 'From eight years ago?'
He heard a sound behind him and whirled, ready to confront Voldemort himself. Instead, Malfoy stood there, arms folded. Looking decidedly unimpressed, he said, “Where are you running to now, Potter?”
It took him less than half an hour to give in and climb out of bed again, creak his door open softly, and tiptoe back across to Draco’s room.
'Well, for better or for worse, Kingsley refuses to abuse his powers as Minister,' Hermione sighed. 'Ron, did—oh, Harry! Harry, what's happened? You look—didn't you find Doge?'
At that moment, a thin, raggedy-looking wizard sits down on the other side of Ron, still mid-conversation with Madam Rosmerta, who takes the seat next to him.  Ron's face falls noticeably, and Harry is sure that he's wishing Rosmerta had been the one to sit beside him.
“It’s going to be rescheduled for the weather,” Harry shrugged.
It was not as if Harry could not sympathize; he hated being wrong, it was true. He had not been able to face what he had done to Malfoy in that bathroom, had scarcely been able to think about it. It was easier to blame the Half-Blood Prince . . . to blame Malfoy for stoking his anger . . .
For an instant, Harry was caught off guard. And before he could recover, Draco said icily, “Now leave me alone,” and he stalked off down the hall without a backward glance, something in his stride looking unexplainably broken.
And even more strangely, just why did Malfoy, who’d probably never done a noble thing in his life, not say a word either?
And he held out his hand.
'He deserves to live with it,' Harry said, thinking of something Dumbledore had once said.
“I made a mistake,” Tonks said, and her voice was even, though she looked shaken. “I messed up, okay? They killed Dad and it scared me. They said they wouldn’t hurt my mum, they said I wouldn’t have to do anything really, just.” She glanced once up at her mother, then away. “Even you make mistakes.”
don't remember that,' he mutters.  'It's Harry, okay?  Let them down.  Well, let Harry down, you can leave Malfoy up there all day.'
"Oh, of course, Potter. No need to listen to me. I can't possibly have anything important to say." Draco raised his eyebrows again, leaning back against the headboard of his bed. "I was saying, the look on the Weasel's face when he hears you spent the hols with me instead of at his little hole will be priceless."
'Hey,' Harry says, hands in his pockets.  Malfoy blinks a couple times, as if he can't quite focus.  'What are you doing out here by yourself?'
Harry went looking for Malfoy after his Thursday Occlumency lesson. As a last minute thought, he’d tucked the Marauder’s Map into his bag, and upon leaving Snape’s office, he unfolded it to find that Malfoy was only a few hallways away, apparently speaking to some student named Tracey Davis. He made his way to the hallway, but stopped before rounding the corner, suddenly apprehensive. Did he even know who Tracey Davis was? He could hear Malfoy’s voice.
while you go? Don’t be ridiculous, Ron. It’s Harry’s birthday anyway, and you’d want us there, wouldn’t you, Harry?”
He caught up with her just before the grounds sloped down towards the lake and they wrestled in the snow for a minute before Ginny panted, breathless for laughing, 'I'll let you win if we can sneak up on Ron together,' and Harry said,
'They've got tobacco in them,' Harry said. 'I don't know, you roll them up and light one end on fire.'
“We’ve got a lovely selection of Puffskeins,” a voice said behind them, and both of them turned around to see a witch with thick-rimmed black spectacles. “Bit lower cost, much more manageable—quite a favorite with the children—"
He was rather gratified at the way Malfoy's mouth dropped open.
, he thought heavily,
“Harry,” Mr. Weasley was saying, peering at him, “Harry, are you listening to me? You’ve got to come with us immediately, we’ll go to the Order’s Headquarters, something’s gone wrong. We don’t know how you were found, you see, it’s a very strong magic keeping you hidden here, and there’s the possibility they might come back. You see, if your aunt is killed, Dumbledore thinks your mother’s protection will no longer save you. Harry? You come with me, we’ll get it sorted out.”
Harry had hoped to put off his first class with Tonks for as long as possible, so his appetite waned significantly when he scanned his schedule and discovered that Defense Against The Dark Arts was the first thing that morning. Ron, who was shoveling in porridge to Harry’s left, showed no such trepidation.
'As unreachable as your companion there,' Phineas says.  Your impatience will get you nowhere.  It took me two years to wake, you know.'
Malfoy's lip might have twitched; it was neither a yes nor a no. He sneered, 'What happened to your owl, anyway? The white one?'
Harry went cold, and it took him a blank moment before he could even manage to say, quietly, “You aren’t alone.”
“What was that, Potter?”
'What am I, a
"Snape was like a father to me," Malfoy said, bitterly, and then, without looking up, added, "Now you've managed to take away both of them, haven't you?"
on Gabrielle and seizes Ron's arm.  'I'll go take care of him,' she says darkly to Harry, just as he glimpses Molly Weasley striding towards them, looking qualified to pen three or four Howlers without a single hesitation.  'You go find—'
Harry looks at her askance.  Lately, she's been reminding him a little bit too much of Malfoy for his own comfort.
'You're just trying to get me in trouble,' Malfoy whined.
'Why did you stay?' Harry asked. 'If it was so terrible, why did you stay?'
take you to Azkaban.  I'm sure Voldemort wouldn't mind sending his Inferi back for another little visit—'
Ron, still vigorously chewing a mouthful of chicken, garbled, 'See what?'
Malfoy was standing there, flushed and scowling; it looked as if someone had spit on him, from the slimy patch on the shoulder of his robes. He was dressed as if he had just returned from a funeral: his robes were buttoned high around his neck, and the sleeves covered the expanse from elbow to wrist that Harry knew drew most people's curious eyes. His mouth tried to work itself into a sneer, but could not quite manage the task.
'But Mum and Dad aren't the same as they were at Hogwarts,' Charlie said. 'They've, you know, changed together. Though they're just as bad as Bill sometimes, to hear Dad, he calls Mum "Mollywobbles," did you know? It's enough to put me off my supper.'
There were bluebell flames in a little bowl beside her. She was curled up around her notes as if someone might come and filch them away at any moment. Harry smiled and touched her shoulder. 'Hermione?'
“I don’t eavesdrop, Harry,” Hermione retorted, just as indignantly. “I can see it by how you’re scowling. Cho’s not bad, you know. She’s been helping me practice with Apparation and everything, and she’s been so helpful.”
'Oh, obviously I have nothing better to do than follow you around,' Harry replied, rolling his eyes. 'Stop being so paranoid. I was just at my counseling session with McGonagall. Have you done yours?'
The girls left them on the second landing and Harry practically dragged Ron inside and dumped him on his bed before collapsing exhaustedly on his own and kicking off his trainers. He scarcely had time to process the night before he lay down in his clothes—just for a minute, he’d get up in a minute—and the next thing he knew, he woke up stiff and exhausted. It was still early, by the clock, and he sat up to see what had woken him just as Mrs. Weasley threw open the door.
Malfoy looked disgusted. 'I'm not your replacement Weasley, Potter. We have an arrangement, that's all.'
“What?” Ron looked momentarily bewildered, but then he shook his head. “But—no, she doesn’t! She can’t, she’s always telling me to sit up straight and stop shouting and not to be a blithering idiot—"
They spent a good portion of the evening arguing about Demelza's odd strategy of training each of her players in multiple positions, and the merits of the Chudley Cannons, which Harry insisted were many, and which Malfoy insisted were nonexistent. It went with surprising ease, save for a brief moment in which Malfoy slipped up.
. Remember what happened less than a year ago, Harry? Hermione was tortured at his house? He was one of You-Know-Who's biggest fans and he has the Dark Mark to prove it?'
side,' Malfoy says.  He's wearing a black shirt that buttons, and it makes his pale skin stand out even more; Harry looks at him, his jutting collarbones and the flush on his cheeks, and the way he can see Malfoy's ribs through the fabric.  For an instant, Harry thinks of Malfoy lying on the bathroom floor with blood spraying out of his chest, Malfoy's pale hands scrabbling desperately over the wounds.  Like spiders, Harry had thought then.
“Don’t call it that,” Harry said. He leaned around Draco to knock on Remus’s door.
'I did it too,' he said. 'And worse. You know, I always thought the Imperius Curse was the least of them. But I mean, Travers. How long was he stuck in a crack in the wall? I didn't even realize it, I didn't think. Griphook said they found him dead.'
Harry gets up from the hearth to let Malfoy take his place.  When Lupin's head vanishes and the pale blonde tresses of Malfoy's mum appear, Harry retreats to the door of the room, but stands there, arms folded, watching.  He can't hear what either of the Malfoys are saying, but he can see the tears streaming down Narcissa Malfoy's face, and Malfoy reaching out to brush them away into the hissing green flames.
But in the back of the house, Harry can hear that Charlie and several of his friends are playing their own music, which promises a bit more fun.   Harry thinks it sounds almost like the Weird Sisters, but at that moment, Gabrielle Delacour bounds past him, shrieking, 'It's The Mermen, I love them,' and pumping her fist in the air.  Somehow, in the last ten minutes, she has changed out of her bridesmaid dress and into what look like black leather pants.
“Hello there,” Tonks said, looking up at him. She added agreeably, “It has been a long time, hasn’t it? Harry was just leaving, actually.”
'Yes, happy birthday to me,' Malfoy said sourly. 'What a splendid day.'
“I’ve got to,” Harry said. “I’ve got to work on my Occlumency.”
Diagon Alley was bustling with people when Harry and Ron edged out of Fred and George’s shop, having narrowly talked their way out of testing a new product, something sludgy and green that Fred looked a bit too keen on someone drinking. The streets were so crowded with last-minute shoppers that Ron was nearly run over by a group of what looked to be three blonde triplets, probably no older than seven or eight, chasing each other ferociously down the street.
“Draco,” Remus said, sternly, before Harry could even open his mouth, “while you are in this house, you will respect Sirius Black, and that is final, or you will leave immediately. I don’t want to hear a single word against him.”
“I told you everything I know,” Harry snapped, getting a bit irritated himself. “I couldn’t hear anything else, I told you, I felt something, like he was after me.”
This seemed to fluster Hermione enough that she had no response, and Harry left her in a hurry to join Ron and Remus, who looked at him with curiosity.
'Sirius did give his house to you,' Hermione said, her tone gently probing. 'Are you sure you want to give it up? You don't have to give your house to Teddy just because he hasn't got—'
? Perhaps these are not the most
'Oh,' said Cho. She frowned sympathetically and reached across the table to squeeze Harry's hand. Her cool fingers stayed wrapped around Harry's for several minutes after that, and Harry squeezed back. It was nice.
'You're sick, Potter,' Malfoy says.
'It is doing him some good,' Harry retorts.  'It's saving his life, and his wife's, and yours.  In case you forgot.'
“Wait until I’m on my deathbed, Potter, and then you’ll be sorry,” Draco said, still looking put off, but he sat down anyway. Weak sunlight filtered into the room and washed over them, making Draco look even paler as he sat there, carefully picking out his pieces. His forehead was creased in concentration, and Harry watched him, watched his nimble fingers and the way he frowned and the shift of the shadows around his neck as his shirt collar peeked open. And for a moment, nothing else, none of it, mattered.
'I didn't know!' Harry insisted. 'God, Malfoy, I would have come, all right? Why didn't you just ask me to be there? Why'd you take so many precautions to insure that I didn't know, why did you—that Unspeakable spell, it's awful, why did you do that?'
Harry frowned. Something in his robes had clinked heavily on the chair leg, as if hearing his silent plea for distraction. Kneeling, he felt in his pocket absently, wondering if he’d stuffed an old ink bottle in there, or perhaps an empty tin of Cockroach Clusters that Ron had left about. Then he realized what he had crammed there: Malfoy’s package.
Hermione smiled. 'Exactly. So, well, that's what I want to do.'
'That doesn't make any sense,' Harry snapped in frustration.
But Malfoy seemed intent on taking his time; his gaze swung around the room, landing on the near-empty jar of beetle eyes balanced precariously on a stack of wrinkled old essays, the duvet kicked half off the bed, the chair with uneven legs piled so high and haphazard with clothes that it could have been a stool or a settee for all Malfoy knew. On the wall beside the picture of the Marauders hung a peeling Cannons poster, so faded that the players' robes were more yellow than orange, and one corner was ripped clean off.
Harry picked up the small package. Taped on the front was a card covered with posies, the likes of which he had seen Aunt Petunia using for as long as he could remember. Inside were the words:
,' Harry snapped, fervently recalling the outcome the last time he, Cho, and Marietta's mother were all involved in a situation. 'If more people were helping maybe it would have seemed like we were winning faster,' he added, a bit miffed.
'Oh,' says Harry, who may judge people too harshly once in awhile, but certainly doesn't want to admit it.  'Well, can we trust you?'
“You want me to
Empty, Harry looked up at Draco. He couldn't think through the sound of the pounding of his heart. "So why aren't you a Death Eater then, Malfoy?" he asked dully. "Why aren't you out there murdering people, if Muggle-born are so bad? Why did you save me from Tonks, if you think all of this?"
'This was the first one I ever got,' Harry says softly.  In the picture, Dumbledore winks at him, and he feels his throat close up.
'So, Lucius Malfoy,' Ron says grimly.  'I suppose he had his chance, didn't he?'
,' Harry exclaimed at Malfoy's back. He scrambled after him. 'Hey! Sirius gave it to me!'
'Shut up and listen.  Second, you hand over Snape.  None of this is solid unless I get Snape.'
'What are
"I," Harry said.
“No, you know what, Hermione? I don’t care about the sodding spy at Hogwarts. I’m going to bed.”
Malfoy gives a small snort. ‘Likely made by some Ministry hack who’d never even met the man.’
By the time Harry crept back out the portrait hole, hidden under the cloak, Hermione was fast asleep in her chair with a thick, dusty book in her arms, an old Weasley jumper draped over her knees.
And Malfoy looked at him, his pale gaze inscrutable and possibly a bit pitying. Far away, Harry heard the dull thud of two grindylows chasing each other into the common room windows, the pop of a log on the fire. The set of Malfoy’s mouth seemed sad, but in recollection, later, Harry thought perhaps that had just been him, seeing what he wanted to see.
Malfoy looks taken aback.
Dumbledore’s tone was serene, but there was no doubt that he meant it. “No, Harry,” he said. “You are not leaving yet. If you cannot bear to hear it from either of us, perhaps you’d like to hear it from Alastor Moody himself. Do you trust him?”
Harry knew the feeling. But sorry for what? For trusting Draco in the first place? For letting himself believe there could be something more there? For giving him a chance? For letting Ron down? For shattering his illusions about the war, about Harry himself?
Harry sighed. “Do you really want to get in trouble now? He’s not worth it, Ron, and you know it.”
'Okay,' Harry says.  He looks up above him, at the intricately curled wrought iron gate, rising like a knotted doorway over his head.  'And you'll come back, will you?'
?" Harry's pretense of interest dissolved into indignant horror. "But your mum is, what, fifty?"
'You tell me where the next Horcrux is, then!' Harry exclaims, shoving his own book—the diary of Rupert Belby, grandson of Flavius—off his lap.  It slides further than he means it to slide and drops with a soft
,” a voice said calmly to Harry’s left. A jet of light shot over his shoulder and before him, Draco dropped like a stone.
'What eleven year old gets up at this hour anyhow?' Neville wondered from his own bed, his words a sleep-slurred mumble. 'Breakfast isn't for another twenty minutes.'
“I hadn’t thought of that, Ron,” Hermione said, looking impressed. “You’re right.”
Hermione was still looking at him with her eyebrows drawn together in that anxious way of hers, like a caricature of herself, and he shrugged.
'Yeah,' says Harry, only vaguely surprised.  'We're going to use The Hog's Head again, did he tell you that?'
In the next three days, Malfoy leaves spiders in Ron's bed, hexes Harry's sheets so they glue themselves together once he's between them, and talks loudly every chance he gets about the lice he's seen in Hermione's hair.  'I have not got lice,' Hermione says crossly, and channels her fury into knitting, producing four hats in one night.
'Well, I'm not finished with you!' Harry snapped, then paused, because he wasn't entirely sure that was what he had meant to say. 'I just mean, Hogwarts needs Slytherin.'
“Yeah.” Harry found, once again, that he didn’t want to talk about it any longer. Grabbing his towel, he moved towards the door. “Come on, or we’ll be late for Quidditch practice.”
They had planned to go down to see Hagrid at the end of lessons that day, but Hermione stormed off to Gryffindor after Defense, so Ron and Harry only shrugged and made their way out of the castle. The fog from that morning had cleared, leaving the sky a cold blue, the day poised on the edge of autumn. Hagrid beamed at them when he opened the door.
'Sure,' Harry said, grateful for the distraction. He felt a pang of guilt for how surprised and pleased Ginny looked.
'I shouldn't think so,' Narcissa said mildly.
'Malfoy kissed me,' Harry said over lunch. Ron choked on a piece of chicken and had to be rescued by a sharp thump on the back from Hermione. His eyes were streaming when he recovered.
"No," Harry answers, because he likes his painting just the way it is, and has no desire to confront Draco about what are now the concerns of another lifetime. Even so, he isn't going to forgive Draco. The door creeps open, and he sees two figures silhouetted by the light. A father—Harry doesn't care if he knows him, and keeps his eyes closed—and his small daughter, carrying a sad bouquet of flowers to lay at the base of the central memorial statue. It is of a nameless wizard dying at the feet of a robed Death Eater, and the candles all around it on the floor flicker as the girl steps close. Harry does not open his eyes until they go.
"I reckon she's still a bit upset over last night," Ron muttered to Harry. "Go on, what'd the Ministry send you now? Hope it's not another memo calling you batty, had quite enough of that last year."
‘Look at me,’ Ginny says, so he does, both their eyes wide open in the dark, searching each other’s gazes while they gasp and lose the rhythm and find it again; at some point he flips them and braces over her, as she says,
“I guess not,” Harry said and smiled faintly. “What are you going to do, then? If your mum’s gone?”
“Speaking of the twins,” Ron said, “I’d better be getting back before Mum comes after me. She’ll want me to polish the silver, no doubt, and set the table, and comb my hair . . .”
“But she wasn’t—she didn’t help the Death Eaters, did she?”
'Kingsley is not going to break the law,' Hermione muttered as they all trudged up to the boys' dormitory, which was also thankfully empty. 'Honestly, Ron. Oh, Harry, get your Invisibility Cloak, we might need it.'
'I'm not taking them off until you take yours off,' Malfoy said, a bit shrilly, and Harry could have laughed: it was so like him to be suspicious, to the very last.
Ron, who had wandered out onto the stoop behind them,
Harry shoved him playfully at the stairs. 'Go on, I'll see you in the morning.'
“I don’t care,” Harry said honestly, and he folded his arms. “I need to know, and I’m trusting you to answer.”
'Yeah, on my bed.  Get off.'
Tonks appeared in the doorway with wet hair, wearing a faded black T-shirt with some Muggle band, and flashed him a grin. “Harry,” she said, sounding happy to see him, “come in,” and he thought, desperately,
Harry grinned. 'Come on, then.'
to him?'
“Got ter be some o’ his followers around,” said Hagrid. “Bu’ he isn’ goin’ ter jus’ attack Diagon Alley, yeh see, he’s got ter assemble his forces, so ter speak—"
if I died—'
'Shut up and go to sleep,' Malfoy hissed.
“Don’t you dare say one more word about Sirius,” Harry hissed, furious with Malfoy, furious with himself for continuing. “I’ll meet you tomorrow night at seven. Right there.” He gestured fiercely behind him, towards the Room of Requirement.
"Er, what?" he said, realizing that Draco had been talking.
“Excuse me?” Malfoy had stopped laughing. Something glittered in his eyes. “If I did need help with Defense, which I most certainly do not, what makes you think I’d want
“Well, there’s no need to be rude about it,” Hermione said briskly. “We’d better hurry, Tonks is waiting for us.”
He remembered that holiday quite clearly; Mrs. Figg's pudding had contained a few stray cat hairs, and his clothes smelled of cabbage for weeks afterwards, but he got to sleep as late as he wanted and there was a fat slice of fruitcake at Christmas dinner just for him.
'Dunno,' said Charlie, hands still stuck in his pockets, kicking a pebble off into the foggy morning. It came perilously close to striking Harry in the knee. 'You're asking the wrong brother, to be honest. Well, all right, I'm better than Percy, I hope, and maybe even Ron, but I haven't got the best record—'
“She’s only taking the Sorting Hat’s warning from last year to heed,” Hermione said. “Each prefect takes part of their house’s third years, Harry, and works with a prefect from another house. Anthony and I are together. So’re Ron and Pansy.”
She disappeared downstairs in a huff and Ginny crept in, hair in a tangle, her nightgown on. “What’s going on?” she asked, sleepily, taking the newspaper from Ron and squinting at it in the faint light. “Oh, for—Harry, look at this.”
'What?'
“You were nowhere near—where was it, Harry?”
'You'd think they would at least keep up with your favorite sweets,' Ron added, eye on the Acid Pops. 'I could do with a few nice chocolates.' He cast a longing gaze at the tin from Romilda, though clearly knew better than to touch them.
“Starting things you can’t finish,” he said furiously. “Walking into things you know nothing about—"
. He noticed that Mrs. Weasley had hung the clock half in shadow.
“Well, she is the only new staff,” Ginny mused. “Unless you count Tonks and Lupin—"
“She's famous,” Draco says with a ghost of a smirk, “for her lingerie.”
She was always surprised by how gentle, how soft, Harry was, when she first arrived and they got over their initial hatred, which was really just a knee-jerk reaction between Gryffindors and Slytherins. She had expected a rougher style, a clumsier, louder presence, that would befit a popular jock, which Harry essentially was during school. But instead, he spoke quietly, a little sarcastic sometimes, standing with his arms by his sides, not moving much, as if he were always waiting to be told off, and didn’t want to draw attention to himself.
The space between them suddenly shrinks. Harry hesitates, lowers his head, Draco shifts, rising, meeting him, and Harry shivers, right as their lips touch, awkwardly, closely, so closely, closer than ever.
Draco’s halfway through his usual routine for closing up shop at the end of the day when the door rings, signalling a new customer, even though he had locked the door and closed the blinds already. He pulls his wand out, his heart already beating wildly in his chest, and braces himself for an attack.
Pansy shrieks loudly, half laughing and half indignant, “How dare you, Draco Malfoy! You sexist pig! You know he’d raise my grade
“It’s your choice,” Draco says quietly.
“And you care what people would say?”
He blocks it, smiling viciously, before running towards Draco.
“Sorry, students, I was just talking to Professor Dumbledore about...about...well, it doesn’t matter what, let’s get to the lesson!” He smiles anxiously and then turns around, fiddling with a few textbooks on his desk.
anymore. I’m sick of it.”
“Hermione Granger visited my store the other day,” Pansy says conversationally. “She wanted to buy a new pant suit. And imagine this, a set of lingerie. Bet that Weasley was over the moon.”
“And I’m serious, too,” Harry says in a low voice. “I know you have been sneaking around the castle at night. I know you are up to something. I just don’t know what and you won’t tell me.”
Just then Draco tenses, his gaze latching onto someone in the distance, coming down the hallway. Pansy follows his gaze and sees Harry flanked by Ron and Hermione, both in a heated argument that Harry seems to be ignoring.
“I don’t cook.” When Draco looks at him in surprise, Harry frowns and looks away. “I usually have dinners with Ron, since he eats alone often when Hermione works late at the Ministry. And I go to a lot of luncheons and have a coffee for breakfast.” The way he phrases it makes him look charitable, but Draco just thinks he looks lonely.
“Oh.”
“It’s sweet,” Malfoy says. He hands it to Harry, who grabs it awkwardly with his left hand.
, Draco might add, but he still smiles at Harry’s bravery, however stupid.
Pansy smirks. “You mean
Harry’s fists clench at his sides, and his gaze flickers back and forth as he stares off into nothingness, like he’s trying to make a tough decision. After a moment, he stands up straighter, his previously tense face easing into a smirk.
Harry turns to Ron, and smiles coldly.
Harry turns the small, worn Potions textbook over in his hands, staring into the fire. He tunes out the quiet bickering between Ron and Hermione, who sit on the floor next to the couch he’s stretched out on.
Her heels click ominously as she walks down the hall, entering an elevator that just opened. She takes a deep breath as the elevator shoots down three flights of stairs to the main shopping level.
Harry stared at Draco, stunned, and didn’t answer for a long time. Then, “What do you want, Draco? Because it seems like you’re lying to yourself just as much as me.”
Ginny, nothing, without him. I would rather be dead than be without him, and I’m not just saying that because I am heartbroken or because I want you to feel bad for me. No, it’s something that I know and have known for a long time now and tried to ignore it but I can’t anymore. So no, you really don’t understand.”
"So you had a secret affair with Draco,” Hermione continues, pushing her thoughts aside reluctantly, “but never told us, for whatever reason. I suppose you had a reason?”
“Merlin, Potter, isn’t it enough that some of them have lost their minds?” Draco says sharply. Harry ignores him, but his mouth tenses into a line.
“They stop pestering me about being an Auror if I show up and speak at these events,” Harry says, flushing, though he doesn’t know why.
Pansy smiles grimly. “And tell me, Draco, did she ask any other questions?”
“Wouldn’t we know it,” Ron mutters under his breath, which earns him a sharp look from Hermione. “What?”
"I'm gonna go check on something. Catch you later." Then Harry walked away, his hand accidentally brushing Draco's arm as he disappeared around the corner.
As if Harry could ever resist him.
But he already knows who it is.
“But how did you know?” Pansy knows Draco would be mortified if he ever found out that Blaise knew.
“He hates me Draco, you know that.” Harry hears the steps getting louder. He looks at Draco, and there’s an edge of disappointment in Draco’s frown. “I’m sorry.”
“He couldn’t have known,” Ginny says sharply. Harry looks at her in surprise.
Parties such as these gained popularity in Gryffindor around Fourth Year. Harry always dreaded them as much as he anticipated them. When it was his turn, Harry always chose Truth, for fear of being asked to kiss Hermione, which would utterly destroy Ron and their friendship. Of course, picking Truth entailed revealing often intimate questions about his experience with Voldemort or Dementors or whatever recent rumor his name was dropped in, and he sometimes killed the mood so much they called it a night. Now that the war was over and much loss was had on both sides, everyone avoids such sensitive topics as a general rule, which has naturally resulted in a much greater focus on each other’s sexual exploits than any past trauma.
“It was during Sixth Year,” Hermione says pointedly, to which Ron smiles sheepishly. “Exactly. We weren’t on speaking terms at the time, and then by the end of the year, Harry and Ginny were dating again and I forgot all about it.”
“Really, you didn’t have to,” Draco says quietly, glancing at the romantic set up. It’s a nice gesture, but it only makes Draco’s chest pang painfully, knowing that it all means nothing beyond that closed door.
“Good night, Miss Granger,” Weasley says, rising and bowing. Miss Granger and Harry rise with him, then Miss Granger curtsies, and leaves the room.
“Oh is it Pansy now?”
“Mr. Potter! Mr. Potter!” A short reporter with tufts of blonde hair scurries over to him, a newspaper in one hand and a large camera in the other. He briefly reminds Harry of Colin Creevey before he gets closer and Harry can spot the differences, the main being that Colin will never reach the old age of the reporter. Harry doesn’t slow down when the reporter walks beside him, trying to keep up with his large strides.
“Please, dear, that is plenty of time,” Mr Weasley says, pained. “I expect they will explain―”
Draco is at his best half-drunk on wine. His cheeks flush, his eyes brighten, and his body becomes languid and loose. Harry never knows what to expect from him when he gets like this.
“Right.”
“Easy?” Draco asks in disbelief. “Easy? You’re not the only person who had to deal with shit in life. You’re not the only person who has suffered. And you have people that love you and you toss them aside like they mean nothing to you. Have you ever thought about how much you made
Hermione is surprised to see Harry arrive at Molly and Arthur’s Christmas Party, albeit an hour late. He looks just about as awful as she expected, dark circles under his eyes, barely brushed curls, frumpy Christmas sweater from five years back. She wonders anxiously how he will react with Draco also being invited to the party, arm in arm with Pansy Parkinson.
Pansy looked at Draco, who nodded, and took off Harry’s briefs, leaving him sitting on the couch, his erection prominent and twitching against his stomach.
“But seriously, what’s going on? You haven’t been yourself lately.”
Ron shakes his head, exasperated, when Harry looks up distractedly from his Potion’s textbook—his new obsession— that balances on his knees, then smiles that small, helpless smile, as if to tell Ron,
to empathize with others whom you do not understand. You may be surprised to discover that we are not so different from each other after all.
“But you can’t just say—”
Finally Harry nods. “Sometimes I forget.” He smiles ruefully, and it’s the first smile Ron has seen on him in what feels like months. “Sometimes I forget that I have friends.”
“I will send you my address tomorrow night when you can come by,” Harry says at the door, already pulling his hood up over his head, shrouding his face in darkness. For a moment, Draco sees another face beneath the hood with that same smirk, and he goes very still.
“See you around, Potter.” But Malfoy didn’t move to leave, and that’s when Harry realized that the blonde git expected
His eyes catch onto another name, a name as familiar to him as his own, walking down the Third Floor corridor to the Room of Requirement. Without a second thought, Harry scrambles off the couch and runs out of the common room, ignoring the Fat Lady’s yelp of protest.
Harry plants feverish kisses along his neck, pulling Draco’s clothes and his own off hurriedly in between them, and then following the trail down his chest, across the delicate expanse of skin between his hip bones. With each kiss Draco’s body arches to meet Harry’s mouth, heat like he’s never known searing his skin, like a white hot band of pleasure that radiates and fragments into small gasps, eyes rolling back as the stars swing wildly overhead, his hands grasping fistfuls of grass beside him.
Draco lets himself smile, at least for today. She doesn’t know for sure, and Hermione’s too nice and too thorough to ask such a dangerous question without being positive that her theory is correct.
“Clever, as always, Miss Granger,” Weasley says, his voice quiet but his expression warm. This time Miss Granger blushes, looking down at her letter shyly, though nonetheless pleased.
“Nice things. I don’t deserve it.”
He lays back down on the blanket, and is about to close his eyes when a loud pop erupts in the room, and Harry almost shouts, sitting up straight like a lightning bolt. Harry looks around wildly, then sees Lucy peek out from the pantry door. When she sees Harry alone, she walks out, watching him with that childlike curiosity so distinct in House Elves.
“Breathtaking,” Pansy says, that rush of satisfaction when she gets an outfit down perfectly; the sharp, plunging neckline that is a breath shy of too much and how the color brings out that rich tone of brown that she has always found so beautiful in Hermione’s complexion.“Has anyone ever told you that blue is your color?”
As he falls, Harry feels the wind against his cheeks, his stomach drop as his body plummets like a stone through the air, and the darkness rushes up to greet him.
Then Harry opens the door and leaves.
“Okay.” Ginny holds Harry’s face between the palms of her hands, not wanting him to say another word. “Okay.”
Ginny had thought.
Draco looks at his own cigarette. “To blend in.”
“Would you ever consider dating me in public?” Draco asks in a peculiar voice.
At this comment, Harry cannot help looking across the room and searching the Slytherin table. They are definitely the smallest group compared to the other three houses, though not by much. Clearly many of them would rather not be there, but as it happens, many also do not have a choice. He finally sees Malfoy seated at the edge of the table, between Mr Goyle, who looks distraught, and Miss Parkinson, who also sits beside Mr Zabini and across from Mr Nott. There is a notable empty space across from Mr Goyle. Malfoy himself betrays nothing in his face besides a slight downturn at the corners of his mouth.
They stay silent, then Hermione looks at Ron, who nods. “I’m gonna check on Rose real quick,” Ron mutters, then his face disappears from the flames. Hermione remains, looking anxious.
“Are they fantasies? Or are you just lying to yourself?”
“Now without further delay, let the feasting commence!”
To anyone else this moment would feel random, maybe even unsentimental, but to Draco it feels terrifyingly right, as if every word and every kiss and every tear before this has naturally led to Harry saying these three words in the dead of night.
“What?”
Harry, who was not hungry, absently took a piece of toast and dropped it onto his plate.
“Natalie’s not bad,” Ginny offered, trudging into breakfast between Harry and Ron, all three of them shivering and damp with the morning fog. She’d become the other new Chaser once Harry rejoined the team as Seeker. “Kirke’s okay, although he’s rather slow, isn’t he? I told Jack we should have held new tryouts for the other Beater, that Kirke was just a replacement for Fred and George, but he doesn’t listen. Doesn’t want to be reminded that he was a replacement too, I suppose.”
“Might as well just leave Malfoy like that,” he muttered, stepping back so Harry could Stun him. “Do us all a favor.”
‘Are you telling me you aren’t sleeping in your own bed because you don’t want to be around Dean? He’s not seeing Ginny anymore. Even if he were, he would never bring her up there, you know that.’
Malfoy's glare was withering. "What does it look like I'm doing, Potter?"
Hermione stood up and shouldered her bag. 'I've to go to the library before class, I'll meet you later. Anyway, Harry, it's up to you. You're the one Kingsley owled. It's your choice.'
on his chair. Before Harry could say a thing, two glasses of the stuff flew over the bar and landed on their table with a flick of Aberforth's wand. Harry thought the gruff old man might have winked, but it could have been his imagination.
'Please,' Malfoy spat. 'I know what you're doing down here, Potter, you thought you'd feel a bit better about yourself if you saw how empty Slytherin was, right? Or you were tired of listening to Granger shriek about house-elves, yeah, you're so bored with your golden life that you decided to come pick a fight with me—'
Draco snorted. "Twenty three."
'Feeling—contrite, Potter?' Malfoy's breath huffed out slow, his voice a little funny.
Malfoy's expression immediately turned furious. 'Yes, poor precious Potter, he's so famous that his friend quota is all full up—'
“It’s worth a lot more than a few quills, Malfoy,” Harry said quietly.
'It might stop your pining,' Malfoy drawled. 'The look you get when Thomas comes around with her on his arm, it's obvious.'
'So,' Malfoy said, when he turned and leaned against the desk. He was wearing dark gray robes that buttoned up to his neck and fell to his ankles, but he still looked thin and wan, and he was not polite any longer, but staring at Harry with a pinched expression. 'What do you want?'
Malfoy sticks his hands in his pockets.  It's quiet, the sunlight filtering through the windows, the castle oddly still.  'Want to keep an eye on me, do you, Potter?'
'Excuse me?' Malfoy blinked. 'We aren't
'Oh, just because you don't know a thing about romance.' Malfoy arched an eyebrow. 'Couldn't even keep a Weasley around, and everyone knows they'll take any scraps that are thrown to them.'
“That’s enough, Hermione,” Ron interrupted her, as abruptly as he had at the end of fifth year.
Mrs. Black, in her silent and stoic way, looks unimpressed.
'Oh, god,' Harry says, 'I really should have Apparated you back.'
"In first year. You know, did your father tell you to, or what?"
'Spying?  Revenge?  Sexual attraction?'
“Tomorrow’s Christmas Eve,” Ron said. “Noon, how about? At Fred and George’s shop? Mum’ll only let me go if I say they’re coming along.”
The first thing Harry saw when he entered the office was Dumbledore, who straightened immediately and smiled at him. “Ah, Harry,” he began, but Harry was already staring in shock at the other occupants of the room. Before he knew it, his wand was clenched in his hand.
“Catch the Snitch early,” Ginny suggested brightly to Harry, as if it were that simple. “We thought Angelina was bad, but Jack’s really living in Oliver Wood’s shadow. Saw him poring over all these diagrams yesterday, like some kind of battle plan.”
'Who?'
Hermione and Ginny were standing outside Gryffindor Tower when Ron and Harry stepped out of the portrait hole. “. . . he didn’t,” Ginny was saying, low-voiced, looking impressed. “That’s so sweet, Hermione.”
“Yeah,” Harry said absently. Harry lifted the lid of the box and immediately saw a picture of his father beaming up at him. He seemed to be hoisted above several people’s heads, considering the hands that were holding him up, and he winked rakishly at Harry.
'That did not happen!' Malfoy spluttered. 'Pansy, that's enough, really—'
Draco. Who was sitting just to the right and a little behind Harry, and who sneered deliberately at his notes when Harry twisted to look at him.
“How does it feel?” Remus asked him gently, when Harry went to his rooms for tea. He looked gray and tired, sitting there with a stack of essays on his lap, and something in Harry’s chest tightened protectively at the sight of him. “Albus thought I should know as well, in case you had any . . . questions.”
'They breed according to the cycles of the moon. Their scales are used in Wolfsbane Potion, but they're poisonous otherwise. Nice, though, aren't they? Pansy used to love them.'
bed?”
Besides, if he tells that to Hermione, he can already imagine her sympathetic 'oh, Harry,' followed by her brisk 'Well, I think it's good that you're having some fun, in the middle of all this research and stress, but it's not harmless, is it?  It could be turning him against us, after all, which is rather the opposite of what we want to happen—and besides, there are better ways to release tension than to harass people—oh, I'm not saying you're like
“Right,” said Ron, at the same time Hermione exclaimed, “Of course, Harry, we won’t keep you!” Both of them stood around the doorway while Harry pulled his trunk in and let it settle beside the unclaimed bed. The room was exactly as he remembered it, though Phineas was not in his frame.
!' Malfoy hissed at once, jerking his head around in panic. 'Lord, Potter, were you planning on telling the whole school? Do you want Peeves to hear?'
“All right,” Hermione said, looking both annoyed and apologetic. “Then let me get this straight. You lent Malfoy some coins, and he sent you this?”
'Hi, Harry,' she said. 'How's your owl?'
'I saw you wander off,' Malfoy adds smugly, as if he has accomplished a great spying feat.  'Snogging in the woods, Potter, that's, that's disgusting.  Unless you did more than snog—oh, I think I'm going to be sick—'
“Voldemort does,” Harry said, rather casually, and stood up. “Here.” Malfoy’s wand clattered to the floor, and he grabbed for it, scowling. “It was a challenge because I wanted you to fight back. Now will you let me help you with Defense?”
With one last tired smile, he Disapparated, and Harry was left alone with Stan Shunpike’s pimply grin and Tonks’s virulently purple hair. “Better hurry,” she shouted, and he followed her up the steps while she stuffed his luggage out of the way. He settled in the first seat available, next to a dozing older woman with a hat not unlike Neville’s grandmother’s, which left Tonks to sit several rows behind him. He felt a bit cruel, avoiding her, but he was in no mood for the chatter he knew would come with the young Auror’s company.
'They are nowhere near my bed!' Harry said hotly, though as he said it, he could not help but imagine Ginny, splayed on Dean's lap over Harry's pillows, red hair spilling everywhere. He could not tell if the sharp ache in his stomach was anger or jealousy or—
Harry thought of his first day at Hogwarts and looked across the table where Nearly-Headless Nick was floating, eyeing Hermione's spotted dick with an expression of jealousy.
“Heavy,” Harry repeated. “Tired. Lots of things.”
Harry shoved his hips back at Malfoy's. The stone scraped against his knuckles but he didn't much care. 'So what if I have?' he breathed. 'I bet you have.'
Quidditch!' Ginny argued.
“Well, Voldemort’s quite persistent in trying to kill me, isn’t he,” Harry snapped. “But that doesn’t mean he’s succeeded!”
Which was when Harry heard the laughter. He looked up, heart seizing.
“Tonks?” Harry said, every bit of his anger and arousal vanishing, so overcome was he by surprise. His heart was racing at how close they’d come to being caught. “What are—what are you doing here?”
Malfoy's jaw dropped. 'Is that a joke?'
'I stopped getting the paper once Rita Skeeter started her sensationalist obituary series,' Harry grumbled; after the claims she made about Remus Lupin's former porn career in the bestiality magazine
'Oh,' Malfoy said. He looked odd, perhaps even pleased, if Harry didn't know better. 'Well, fine then.'
'What kind of brute attacks an eleven year old girl?' Malfoy demanded. 'Slytherin stands up for its own!'
“I’ve changed my mind,” Malfoy sneered immediately. “I don’t want your stupid Defense lessons. As if I’d let you get near me with a wand.” Harry opened his mouth to reply, and Malfoy said quickly, “And don’t you dare hex me, Potter.”
“Maybe it’s got to do with the attack,” Ron speculated, looking hopeful. “Maybe the slimy git’s the one who got them out, and now—"
He's getting punch when he runs into Ginny, still in her pale gold bridesmaid dress, her hair done up with pearls.  'Hi, Harry,' she says, leaning around him for a cup.  'Did you like the wedding?  Fleur looked beautiful, didn't she?'
'Potter,' Malfoy said again, mockingly slow. 'What—do—you—want?'
In the middle of the night, or rather, the night moving towards morning, Harry woke disoriented. When he turned to look at Malfoy, his eyes were open and Harry struggled to sit up, but Malfoy made a shushing noise.
They went to the Burrow for Christmas Eve. The house was a-bustle with Teddy shouting, George's explosions ('It was Fred's idea, Mum, I swear'), and a very pregnant and very bossy Fleur. In one room, Arthur and Andromeda were talking about Ministry politics, while Hermione looked on. Ron and Bill were playing chess by the fire, while Ginny was curled up beside them with Crookshanks on her lap. Everyone seemed cozy and content, until Harry went into the kitchen for a glass of water and found all the counters covered with busy pots and pans, but no Mrs. Weasley.
does—"
,” said Harry, calmly, wand suddenly in hand.
“Oh,” Harry said, taking a breath, “wait for what, your goons to catch up to you? Give me a real pounding, won’t they? I don’t have to remind you just how you arrived to King’s Cross at the end of the year last year, do I?”
'He took away Slytherin's victory in first year!'
'Floo,' Hermione said simply.
“What are you staring at, Weasley?” he snapped, brushing off his robes with an angry look.
'But you don't trust me.'
my Bellatrix?”
Fleur stares down at him, then says very stiffly, 'I expected better from you, 'Arry Potter,' and stalks out of the kitchen in a whirl of silver hair.  Gabrielle looks back and forth between the empty doorway and Harry.
'Er,' Harry said. 'Fancy a game of chess while we wait for your mum?'
He says, 'Er, Parkinson?'
'Fine,' Harry shot back. 'I didn't ask you to. Leave, if you want.'
Malfoy was near grinding his teeth. 'Potter almost killed me,' he bit out. 'He used this horrible spell that ripped my chest open—there was blood everywhere, Professor—'
?” Draco demanded heatedly. “Potter, it’s
'No,' Harry begins, but at that moment, Hermione taps him on the shoulder.
Hermione winced. "Bad, I think," she said, her voice quiet. "He's only really spoken to Ginny, but she says he's still upset, goes through these whole periods of denial where he talks about Dennis as if he's right upstairs." She put her hand on Harry's arm and added, grimly, "He still talks about you, though, and how you're going to save us. When he's clear that Dennis died, he keeps babbling to Ginny about how you're our only hope."
'Hermione says we've got to go,' Harry agreed. 'Besides, I want to be an Auror, and you need five N.E.W.T.s for that.'
'But it's regenerative, of course,' Hermione said.
“Sorry,” he said, oblivious, and resettled.
'I'm not
’s captain?” he heard Ron gasp beside him, and Harry exchanged a disgusted look with Ron before they turned back to see Jack and Malfoy shake hands. They both gripped each other’s hands until they were white-knuckled, but Jack looked no less wild-eyed as he turned to mount his broom on Madam Hooch’s instructions.
'Well, how were we supposed to know you were telling the truth?' Malfoy demanded. 'You were Harry Potter, you were full of exaggerated, self-important stories!'
'Probably because everyone else is busy pairing off,' Harry snapped. 'Excuse me if I don't want to watch you lot staring at each other and holding hands all day.'
“I assume she’s well,” Draco drawled, though there was a certain pride in his tone that Harry had never heard. “She’s in France, of course, though I expect I’ll be hearing from her soon.”
certainly wouldn't have wasted them on a werewolf.'
“I do have you pegged!” Harry yelled. “You’re nothing but a worthless little toady, you think everybody cares about you but you’re nothing, even your dad couldn’t come back for you—"
He left the room without looking back.
'Yeah, I'll bet he just wants our secrets!' Ron exclaims, mouth still half full, before Hermione can finish. 'Durmstrang's all about the Dark Arts, his headmaster was Karkaroff, don't you think it's all a bit suspicious—'
He was trembling, too, so turned on he was almost dizzy.
'My mum was,' Harry retorted. 'Besides, if Voldemort's supporters rose up again, don't you think I'd be their number one target?'
Hermione sighs.  'I'm trying to figure out how to get around the Ministry's Portkey laws.  This time, everyone can't just tramp upstairs to the Room of Requirement.  If necessary, we could have them all Floo in, but it'd just be so much easier to make their fake Galleons into Portkeys.'
“Do you know what happened in the Department of Mysteries last June?”
“Oh,” Harry said, caught off guard, “no, that’s okay, I’ve got—other things to do. See you.”
so it doesn't matter what's done to them—it's
“Potter,” Draco said icily, “I will come to Potions class when I am ready to come. Until then, you can shut your mouth about it.”
“And there are at least sixteen different runes for violence, you see, so it was impossible to track down a book until we were able to clarify whether the . . .” Hermione trailed off impatiently, glaring at Ron and Harry as they walked to the Room of Requirement. “Are you even listening to me?”
is getting stronger and stronger, and one of these days he’s going to attack, and none of us will expect it.”
'Getting—windy,' he managed, flopping into a chair by the fire. 'Filch made me do my detention behind the greenhouses, I've been pulling monster weeds for hours.'
'It has to be you. Please, Harry, you know it does. Ron and I are Head Boy and Head Girl, we can't go around breaking rules!'
They were both careening desperately upwards, Harry’s right hand clenched tight around his broom as his left, closer to the Snitch, extended out to grab it—he was so close, Malfoy grasping beside him, his fingers grabbing desperately at the air—
“Well, what are we waiting for?” Moody rumbled. At his voice, Draco’s head flew up and he stared at Moody, glaring balefully as if he didn’t trust him. Moody continued without hesitation, “Potter, you’re here to give us your side of the story. Albus, have you got the potion?”
'Pansy's been acting weird,' Harry said that night, leaning against the back of the door to Malfoy's dormitory, empty but for him. When Malfoy did not look all that interested in Pansy's behavior, normal or otherwise, Harry shrugged. 'I don't know, she's your friend. Did you have a good birthday?'
'He might.' Hermione shrugged. 'It was only an idea.'
Ron grinned in the semi-darkness. “Remember that time he streaked out of the shower starkers and jumped on all our beds?”
Ona sees Harry looking.  'I wager you know about the properties of chocolate in combating and healing from the Dark Arts.  You'd go mad here without it.'
he started to write on the same scrap of parchment, just below the other boy's initials.
"I was afraid I'd be lonely," Draco whispers to him, in the dim candlelight.
“It could be that you wanted to get me in trouble,” Harry mused, “but then, I’m not doing anything wrong. In fact, it’s hours until curfew. So maybe you wanted to get me alone so you could get me back for what happened with your dad, is that it?” He saw a glint of fury in Malfoy’s eyes and pressed onward. “Bet you were furious about having him gone, huh? The Ministry taking your stuff, all your money taken. Did you have a rotten summer, Malfoy? Want to make me pay for it? Because you can try, if you want, but we’ve all seen what rubbish you are at Defense.”
“There’s nuthin’ yeh can do,” Hagrid said again, as if they hadn’t heard him the first time. “Nobody knows the truth, an’ Dumbledore doesn’ tell the Order everythin’ he knows, either—select information, yeh know, I don’ hear much o’ what’s goin’ on—anyway, bin hearin’ rumors all summer long abou’ activity over there. Firs’ nobody wanted ter listen, with loads o’ diff’rent stories all over the Prophet, bu’ eventually we had ter pay attention—"
“What did I say?” Ron looked startled, but not entirely displeased, as Hermione seized him without warning and kissed him on the cheek.
, Malfoy had gone white, and Harry remembered in a rush just how recently Malfoy had been made to do things against his will. 'So that's it,' he said, quiet. 'You only do things when people threaten you and hold your family hostage, right? When you can pretend you don't have a choice?'
“Yes.”
'You're dead—you—aren't you?'
, Potter?'
'Busy, I know,' Harry says sharply.  'Fine, there's no point in you splinching yourself on the way there.  Come on.'
“Nott didn’t say a word to me! He just sat there with Padma and looked angry!”
Harry almost choked.
'All the better that you didn't, then,' Harry snapped, pulling him back to the present. 'Honestly, Malfoy.'
He felt closer to Draco, too: it was impossible for Harry not to be acutely aware of how closely Draco was pressed against him, how Draco’s chin had nearly been resting on Harry’s shoulder the entire time, Draco’s arms around his ribs. As they settled to a stop, he could feel Draco breathing harshly against his ear for one fleeting moment, and then the other boy climbed off.
Pansy smirked. 'Oh, did she. Right up to the Astronomy Tower and everything, she had those bite marks on her neck for days. Poor Vince just moped around and she never even realized.'
"As if you can tell me what I should or should not do, Ron Weasley," Hermione said from across the room, having heard him. "I had a fine time, for your information, though it was no thanks to you."
'Nice to know you'd return the favor,' Harry said, then sent a pale shape streaking off up the corridor. Across the room, Myrtle was floating, looking almost regretful that she had alerted them to Malfoy's presence; Harry knew she would be all too pleased to have a fellow ghost to share her toilet.
'Malfoy,' Harry groaned. 'Come
to want death more than Draco. At least, he doesn't want Draco to think he wants death more than Draco.
It was hard to believe from this side of the war, but he had thought it would be different.
'Yeah.' Harry looked up at Ron in the dusk and gave him a grateful grin. 'I know.'
'I don't—' Harry said blankly, and then Malfoy was on his hands and knees between Harry's legs and it hurt for a second, when Malfoy leaned hard on Harry's legs, and then his mouth was descending on Harry's cock, which twitched so badly Harry was not sure how he kept from coming right then and there.
He had to knock multiple times. At last, Malfoy's voice came from behind the door. 'Is that you, Potter? What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be snogging some little Gryffindor up in your tower, or have they all fainted in awe of your daring victory?'
Being is a portrait is a strange thing. For instance, everything—upon close inspection, since the magic blends it well—is painted. It is not wet or textured like paint, but it is nevertheless exactly the way it sounds; it is like living in a painting. Harry wonders if he is real, if his thoughts are his thoughts or some flawed interpretation of magic, if perhaps he has the wrong memories, if his mind is truly his mind or a magical invention. He is, after all, dead. However, usually he doesn't think those thoughts, because if he thinks too hard about it he is afraid that his brain—if it exists—will explode.
When she enters the house, the first thing Ginny hears is a baby screaming. She grimaces, then continues walking into the living room, where Hermione and Ron try to soothe a very upset Rose, whose bib is stained with what Ginny hopes is apple sauce.
Then Harry walks past Draco, hands shoved in his pockets to keep them from shaking.
“He’s obsessed with that Potion’s book,” Hermione comments, a worried crease between her brows. She looks at Ron searchingly, probably wondering how “The Ginny Talk” went down, as she has been calling it of late. Ron shakes his head.
“We’re not angry with you,” Ron adds gently. “It’s just, sometimes, you come off a bit insensitive. You’re hard to read, and right now, it looks like you could care less how Ginny’s feeling. And as her brother, I can’t let that slide. You guys don’t need to be what you were, but the least you could do is check in with her.”
Maybe, just maybe, could she be trying to warn him?
“What’s wrong?” Pansy asks, out of breath as if she’d been searching the castle grounds. “Did you find them?”
“Mmph.”
“Oh I am sure you are quite right,” Mr Weasley says, his eyes twinkling. “I thought perhaps I would surprise you as well.”
“Yes.”
She knows it’s not normal, but then again, when has anything in Harry’s life been normal? “I’m sure it’s nothing to worry about. If it’s not from You Know Who, then it’s probably just stress.”
Arithmancy with Professor Vector
His body worked on autopilot, his hand catching the door handle clumsily. The door gave, and Draco cautiously opened it.
Blaise raises an eyebrow. “No. I definitely heard you talking to someone. I thought it sounded like—but it doesn’t matter.” He turns around, his black robes unfurling behind him. “Hurry up and get ready. I’m hungry.”
“You’re joking right?” Draco wants to laugh and scream and strangle him. “This potion takes weeks at best. It’s a very complicated and dangerous process, not to mention the risks I’m taking acquiring all of the very illegal ingredients. Honestly, Potter, did you do any research?”
to leave.
during Hogwarts.”
Hermione bites her lip. “Maybe they were friends?”
“You know, the ending is the best part...” his voice is smooth like a storyteller’s.
It was easier, still, to bleed than to open his heart up completely, to see in himself someone worth loving, someone Draco, lovely, lovely Draco, would look at and love despite the darkness that eats at his soul, day and night.
“Yes,” Hermione says quietly, “I suppose we do.”
“To let the Death Eaters into the castle,” Hermione finishes sadly, remembering the terror of that night, the Dark Mark flashing green against the stormy grey sky.
He doesn’t regret it, falling deeper and harder in love. Back in school, sure, they loved each other, they needed each other...but this time it was different. They didn’t
He was not going to find Harry. It could be a prank. A Weasley joke. One final humiliation before they graduated and never saw each other again.
“Yes?”
Draco couldn’t imagine a world where Harry Potter grew up in the muggle world, never knowing he was the Boy Who Lived, the Chosen One, come to save us all from the return of He Who Must Not Be Named.
Harry blocks it easily, brushing it away with the back of his hand like an annoying fly. “Come on, Draco, is that the best you’ve got?”
For it isn’t just sex, anymore. Maybe it never was.
At this Draco laughs, and Pansy wishes she could bottle up the sound for later. She’s always been able to tell just by the taste of the wind if a storm was brewing, and Merlin knows there’s a dark and thundering one just on the horizon.
Draco stirs at his serious tone, and Harry’s arms tighten their hold around him. “That’s interesting, because for me it’s the opposite. With you I feel real, and the rest of my life is a nightmare.”
“Were you and Harry ever...friends at Hogwarts?” Hermione asks, hesitantly. She somehow can’t imagine it, but it’s worth a try. Draco flinches, then smiles tightly.
