Draco laid down, grabbing a random stuffed animal from his side. He gave it to Harry, who grabbed it after a moment. Draco still wasn't sure he was asleep, so he tucked Harry in as best as he could with the awkward position they were in.
Knowing who his father was, it was likely he would interfere in some way with the correspondence. Draco didn't trust that the Aurors would arrive any time soon.
"Potter will be vulnerable for another two weeks, at least. That leaves plenty of room for him to take action. I have to give him some information next time he calls or I will likely not be returning." Severus spoke at a whisper, coming to a rest with his hands gripping the back of a chair harshly.
Draco smiled. Harry didn't like it. "My last name. My blood. The Malfoy's are an ancient Pureblood line. That means we've only had wizards in our ancestry. Not a single filthy Muggle among the bunch. We're extremely powerful, everyone looks up to us."
Abruptly, Draco turned, shoved his wand into Harry's face and murmured a quick spell that shrunk his glasses to be proportional to his face. Harry stared up at him, startled and confused. Draco didn't look back down at him, instead choosing to immediately continue walking, leaving Harry to jog slightly to catch back to up him.
He needed to figure out what that was. Wrapping his invisibility cloak around him, he went to the library to start looking. He wouldn't be sleeping again tonight.
Before Harry could protest, the stern women held up a hand to silence him. Harry deflated slightly, nodding. "Before we get into all of that, take this." She handed him two vials, one an ugly light green and the other a dark blue. He swallowed them both quickly, shuddering. He felt the ache in his bones vanish, the pain from where his injuries would brush against his clothes gone. His stomach felt full and a headache he hadn't even noticed went away.
"Draco, wake up." Harry nudged the boy. It was nearing midnight, it would soon be Draco's 15th.
"Yes, My Lord."
"It has come to my attention that there has been an incident concerning Mr. Potter today that you all witnessed," she began. The students in the classroom shifted nervously. "I have been informed to tell you that if I hear any of you, even if you are not from my house, saying anything about this situation you will be punished. This is not a laughing matter. I do not want to hear any gossiping, murmuring, whispering, anything concerning Mr. Potter. You will keep this to yourselves, least you all wish to be responsible for a considerable loss of house points and any detention I wish to bestow upon you. Do I make myself clear?"
"What was the nightmare about?" Draco asked quietly, now moving his thumb in small circular motions on the back of Harry's neck. Harry turned his face so it was hidden into Draco's shoulder, who pretended not to melt at the action.
"My stomach hurrrrrttttssss," Harry groaned, making a grand gesture of flopping against Draco and giving him puppy eyes.
"Come in."
He saw Dumbledore frown out of the corner of his eye. "And we will hope he is not. Mr. Malfoy, I am very glad I entrusted his care to you. I wouldn't expect anyone else to do a better job."
because everyone was
"A week? That's it? And his memory is just-gone? Like that?"
Madam Pomfrey nodded again, muttering something under her breath. "Please sit, Mr. Malfoy," she told him gently, pausing. Draco backed up, realizing he had encroached her space and had been hovering. He sat on the bed next to Harry, feeling like he would vanish if he looked away for a moment.
Mumbling, Harry woke up yawning. Draco realized his tongue was normal, though his canine teeth were still unusually long. "Harry?"
"I'm scared." Harry whispered. He was looking up at him with wide eyes. Draco picked him up easily, feeling better as Harry wrapped his arms around his neck and his legs around his waist.
Draco's brow furrowed, not sure what Harry was talking about. "Of course, yes. Anything. Just ask," he prompted.
"How does something so small eat so much?" Draco asked, gasping and holding a hand to his chest. Harry giggled. Draco tweaked his nose, smiling.
"I have no idea," Harry told her, before he ran at Snuffles. The two engaged in a small race, that Snuffles easily won. Harry stopped, gasping for breath and laughing as he walked back to Hermione, who was watching the two of them with a warm smile.
Harry's whole demeanor changed. His body tensed and his eyes snapped open, jumping back and forth as his entire body stilled. "Hey, hey it's okay, what's going on?" Draco tried to sooth, alarmed by the change.
Harry wrinkled his nose. "That's mean."
"Well, Malfoy, I will have to ask you to leave the compartment," Harry said nonchalantly, not reacting when Malfoy stood as well, outrage on his face.
"Weak,
Hermione smiled at him, and took off with Neville down the hallway. He hoped they wouldn't say anything about him. If all went well, the creature would be dead, and there would be no way of knowing Harry was involved in it, when word got back to Voldemort.
Draco's heart leaped into his throat. After a moment, Harry prodded the side of his head. Draco battled his hand away.
Harry grabbed a few pounds from her purse and slipped back into his task of the dishes. He just had to wait until he was sent out again. And after a few years of this, Harry found out they didn't notice when suddenly his pant legs weren't cuffed, there wasn't a belt double wrapped around him, his coat didn't have holes and his shirt hung to his waist. They didn't pay enough attention to realize, and after the initial stung of that had worn away, Harry found he preferred it.
A little note was attached.
"Oh, you're speaking to me again?"
Explosion after explosion assaulted the wall, Harry and Draco adding a small contribution to the destruction. Soon many holes were dotted in the brick, and Harry and Draco quickly swooped past Pettigrew's broom, collecting an armful of brooms and flying towards the cheering inmates.
Harry backpedaled into the compartment. "No, not at all. Do you need help with your trunk, Neville?"
Harry hardly had to read a page before he had the answer he needed.
Draco shrugged. "You're not wrong, Potter. I don't think many people have earned my pleasantries."
"Do you frequently make friends with portraits, Potter?" Draco asked, looking down at Harry with a raised eyebrow. Harry shrugged.
Harry leaned forward in his seat, challenging Draco. "And what exactly makes you so superior?"
Draco leaned his head forward into Harry's hair. Again feeling like that aching emotion in his chest was controlling him, Draco kissed the top of Harry's head. Moving away, a hair caught in his nose and made him sneeze. Harry giggled, stretching his arms as he woke up. Draco wanted to sigh in disappointment. No more cuddles for now.
"Uhm... my head hurts pretty ba-" Harry paused, choking a little on his own words. "I... I was - I was small and-"
"Harry?"
Draco grabbed one as well, looking around as he ate. In the corner, a spiral staircase went up from the common room, which Draco presumed lead to their bedrooms. He went up, Harry not far behind him. On the right side, a room in tones of dark greens and blacks, a four-poster bed and his trunk at the bottom of the bed. A desk and a chair in the corner, and a bathroom that connected.
Draco was ready to bolt to the Hospital Wing the moment Harry's breath changed.
"Harry? Harry?"
Harry smiled wider, pulling Draco in for a hug. He buried his face into his neck and pretending not to notice when Draco shivered and held him tight.
Hermione frowned at him again. "Still, we can't exactly sneak a whole dog into the castle. It's not curfew, a teacher or a student could pass and see us," Hermione said. Harry frowned for a moment, until a slow smile came to his face.
Draco mourned the loss of his lunch as he began walking.
Draco nodded slowly, chewing on mashed carrots. "I still don't understand why you socialize with that Mudblood."
"There's just... a lot going on right now that I need to focus on, and I'm not sleeping great." Harry brought his head back up to smile at her, though he knew it looked rough. "I promise, Hermione."
Draco huffed. "We both know I'm better than her, Harry. It's impossible for a Mudblood-
"Oh look how skinny it is, I think it's shivering! Oh the poor thing," Hermione frowned heavily, her hand twitching to reach out to it. "Do you think it's friendly?"
"You really should keep your door locked, you know, given all the," Harry paused, "unfavorable company we're keeping now."
"You're welcome," Draco said curtly. And that was that.
Harry laughed at him.
broken. It seemed to have stopped bleeding, but Draco figured better safe than sorry.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I got you back...you're safe...you're going to be okay..." Draco continued to whisper to him, petting his hair and his face until Dumbledore and Snape walked through the door. Draco reluctantly pulled himself away from Harry to face them. Madam Pomfrey joined a second later.
Draco shared a grim look with Professor Snape. "Who is Professor McGonagall?"
Harry stretched out his hand, and clasped it tightly in it's fist. It fluttered feebly in his palm, and soon stopped. He landed and stuffed the key into the door, hearing a soft
" Draco gasped right along with him, hands twitching to hold the sleek broom.
"Hagrid was the first friend I had. He's a good person, you really shouldn't hold what he is against him, you know," Harry said, getting himself some tea too.
Harry accepted the cup, adding some sugar to it. "How are you, Professor?"
Harry didn't say anything. He didn't think he could. He was frozen in place, eyes flickering between the red eyes and the vibrant green snake that wrapped around his feet. The man pulled out a wand and pointed it at Harry, unwavering.
Panicking, Draco looked for anything Harry could've hurt himself on. Did he hit his head when he fell yesterday? Were one of his stuffed animals stuffed with rocks? Had Draco hurt him? Dumbledore and Pomfrey were going to kill him-
. When had everything changed so much? When did it start feeling like Harry belonged with him, tucked into his arms and sleeping on his chest?
"Yes, Professor?"
The two chatted for a while, before the compartment door opened again. There was a dark skinned boy, and behind him stood Draco.
Harry was used to it at this point. Look out the window while in the kitchen, make sure the door to the living room was closed, and find the inner right pocket of Aunt Petunia's purse while listening for blundering footsteps. He slipped the cash into one of his baggy pockets to go under a loose floorboard he had in the corner of his cupboard. A little bit once or twice a week added up eventually, so when Harry was sent on an errand he had an opportunity to help himself and get proper-fitting clothes. Last time he had gotten brand new socks; they had been heaven on his feet.
"No..."
It didn't take long for him to finish his quiet explanation. McGonagall went to check the wards for breaks or dark magic. Snape to seal the entrances, and Flitwick and Sprout to triple check and block all fireplaces that might have a floo connection.
Harry sighed again, looking down at his hands."Which one do you want? The one my relatives use, or the one on my bank statements?" He asked. He wouldn't look at Draco.
The dragon raged, spewing fire around itself as it flew up, up into the sky. Heat cascaded upon the stands, making Harry and most of the others flinch in its proximity. Suddenly a light blue shimmer surrounded the dragon, and it collided sharply with something unseen. It roared, flapping useless wings and falling back into the arena where it flailed and shrieked its rage. Aurors and teachers flooded the arena, hitting the already disabled dragon with many brightly-colored spells. Harry spotted Dumbledore and Hagrid among the bunch, and let out a sigh of relief. It had been okay. His small act of rebellion allowed him a small smile.
Hermione gave Neville a stare that Harry had learned meant
Harry fell back in the clutter, his heart pounding in his chest, weariness in his bones. But he couldn't rest now. He had to tell Snape.
"Very well, then. We will figure this out, rest assured." Dumbledore clapped his hands together, giving the rest of the room a small smile. "Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Potter, would you like a house elf to take you to your rooms?"
He wasn't sure if it was his spells, his luck, or some god that had blessed his journey, but he reached Harry and the snake never moved once. He crouched, brushing hair away from Harry's forehead gently. Draco almost gasped.
A young Hufflepuff girl with long hair poked her head in. Walking into the classroom, she extended her hand out to Professor Vector. "Excuse me, Professor, this is for you."
look for interrupting him, but nodded.
"Fine," she said, rolling her eyes at Harry's laugh. The two walked out together, leaving behind a nondescript, old leather-bound book on the table they had been sitting at.
"About Hogsmead. You wouldn't have brought it up if it wasn't bothering you." Harry gave him a blank stare. Draco looked affronted. He opened his mouth but Harry cut him off. "No, don't look at me like that. You always complain about what's bothering you, you've just never been indirect about it. What's going on?" Draco ignored him, moving his queen. He'd have Harry's king soon, but Harry didn't care about that right now. He stared at Draco, waiting for an answer.
She huffed through her nose, sounding almost as if her breath had been forcefully knocked out of her. A small poof of turquoise air left her nostrils, before Hermione's hair grew out significantly, she shortened around an inch and her face rounded out just a bit. The class clapped and she curtsied.
Draco smiled. "Be right back."
She popped up immediately next to Dumbledore with a bright smile. Draco stood, holding Harry against his chest tightly. He thought Harry might push him away, but he seemed fine curled up against Draco, his little arms wrapped around his neck.
Harry watched him go. The teacher asked Dudley a question. Dudley paused and looked at Harry, who shook his head. Dudley continued to hold his nose and the teacher took him to the nurse, never glancing Harry's way.
Harry realized the gems matched their eyes, and whether or not he had done that on purpose he had no idea, but it made his stomach burst into butterflies, so he didn't say anything.
Harry walked out of the library, slowly moving to the great hall. What did it mean that he could speak Parseltongue? It was a hereditary trait, the book had said, but...that didn't make much sense. Harry looked up at the high ceiling of the corridor.
Harry had decided to ignore almost everyone in the room when Malfoy knocked into his shoulder.
Draco was thinking similarly to Harry. Something must've been wrong with him, if he was even contemplating the fact the Potter looked 'cute'. At any age, Potter was disgusting.
"Maybe," Draco said, trying to remember what question he was asking. "Right, what house are you in?" Draco had thought this question was going to be pointless, but Harry seemed confused for a second. Draco watched him closely.
He wrapped his arms around him, the flimsy blanket he had around him serving very little purpose. He glared at Dudley, who was asleep on the couch. A small puddle of drool formed as he slept, repulsing Harry. He moved, and sat next to the unlit fireplace. He stared at the single log, hoping, wishing,
Draco shrugged, not meeting Harry's eye as he moved his knight and settled back into his seat with his arms crossed. "Blaise has been talking about approaching one of the Beauxbatons or Durmstrang girls to go with him, was wondering if you were too."
"Professor Snape," Draco said, moving to the side to allow the man in. He saw Harry glare a little, but a pointed look from Draco made him drop it with a mumbled apology.
A long, tense moment passed. He hardly breathed. Eventually he opened his eyes, seeing nothing but black hair. Only moving his eyes, he looked around, seeing the outline of Harry's body under the blanket, pressed against his.
"Fine, Professor, thank you. Sorry for the confusion, but why am I here, exactly?" Draco did Not Look at Harry who was most certainly Looking at him.
"Death Eaters came into the room while we were sleeping and they took Harry and he's gone now and I only just woke up because they stunned me and cast the Cruciatus on me and I don't know how long they've been gone but they took Harry and I don't know how to find him and if he's alive or safe or close or anything and-" Draco choked, catching his breath and pressing his palms over his hands.
Harry walked in front of Dinky and Draco, who had stopped a few feet from the portrait. "Hi Sir Mercy. You never told me you were an entrance portrait."
"This is...troubling."
"His plan. What is even the point of sabotaging the tasks? None of them are large light supporters, the most he's doing is inconveniencing Dumbledore." Draco said, stabbing a piece of toast with his fork. Harry poked Draco's thigh to signal that he should calm down. Draco sighed, and dropped his fork.
, and he wouldn't change it for the world.
Harry lowered to a whisper-yell, leaning close to Draco. The blond shook his head angrily, giving Harry a
"I've been told you are the reason behind Dolores Umbridge's recent death in St. Mungo's." He spoke quietly. Harry's back straightened. Snape had told him, one way or another, and now the entire inner circle, including Draco knew.
The person threw back their hood, revealing a woman who was cackling. "I was making sure your son didn't interrupt,
"No, Madam Pomfrey sent it with a note and a few other potions," Severus looked at him with raised eyebrows, "a few for pain and injuries, and nourishment potions he needs to take before breakfast every day." Severus nodded.
"Harry, will you come with me to my office?" Professor Dumbledore looked at him kindly, a reassuring smile on his face. Harry nodded, sliding off the bed and hitting the floor with a slight thud
Maybe it was knowing that Quirrell was dead now. Maybe it was knowing that Voldemort wasn't going to stop. Harry clenched his hands into fists so they wouldn't shake.
Harry swatted Draco on the side of the head. "Hey! You come into my room, wake me up in the middle of the night, and then have the
already! He could be
Hand shaking a little, Draco pulled the cork off and handed it to Harry. He sniffed it delicately, grimacing. Draco didn't realize he had been holding his breath until Harry swallowed the potion and burped with a cry of disgust.
"You'll get it Harry. Maybe we can continue next year. Professor Dumbledore said I'm going to be working here again next year, as long as my health holds." Professor Lupin watched him. Harry gave him a tired smile. "Harry, this is a spell seventh years are taught. Be nice to yourself, you've been working extremely hard."
"Hey Har," Draco said, holding his arms out. In a flash Harry was there, almost knocking Draco over with the force of it. Draco smiled so wide his face felt tight, eyes watering as Harry snuggled into him, holding tightly to his shirt. He clenched his eyes closed. He didn't need to cry right now. Everything was okay.
Some hours had passed and Draco's hand was cramping from holding his quill for so long -McGonagall wouldn't take the situation as an excuse to slack on his essays- when he heard a clang from downstairs.
Draco set Harry down among the pillows, pushing the hair out of his face. He pulled clean pajamas out of a drawer -all Harry's, shrunken when they first moved in- to change Harry into. Draco looked for new bruises and scrapes while he did, thankfully finding nothing. He tucked Harry in, smiling when Harry reached out, grabbing a stuffed dog and holding it tight to his chest.
"A spoiled eleven year-old. Just go, Malfoy. Do you really want to fight me? We both know I'm more powerful than you." Harry held his breath, hoping his bluff would pay off. People knew his name, and it had to be for a better reason than his family being dunces or something. And he didn't want to fight just yet. Having an enemy before he even got to school wouldn't do well, though he wasn't so sure that Malfoy would be so great of a friend to have now.
Harry almost crashed into a tree.
"He-he gasped and clutched his stomach and then just went limp and wouldn't wake up. It seemed like he was in pain." Madam Pomfrey nodded, casting spells Draco didn't know.
"I'm... Harry, I knew your father, in school. We were really close friends. I-I was supposed to take care of you after he died, but I was framed for murder. I didn't-I'm innocent, Harry. I'm your godfather."
"Ask Madam Pomfrey for some sickness potions. Ones for fevers and the like."
Harry nodded dumbly.
Harry shrugged. "Hedwig was the first pet I've ever had, and I named her after something I found in one of our first year textbooks. I'm no better at naming things than you are, and you're pretty awful at it."
He fell into the chair in front of the Headmasters desk, sobs shaking him though he made no noise.
He heard it. The slightest hissing from above his head, still on the second floor. Draco almost didn't hear it over his own heartbeat.
Draco paused. He hadn't been expecting that, and he still didn't really believe it but Harry already looked extremely uncomfortable. He didn't want to make the situation worse and have him clam up. That would make everything Dumbledore asked him to do more difficult.
Harry nodded, looking better. Draco kissed the top of his head, feeling like the most natural thing in the world. Harry gave him a shy smile as he walked away.
Snape barely looked up. "I don't tutor students, Potter."
Harry was afraid he had broken the man. "That's-that's not possible. That isn't possible," Lupin whispered, standing up shakily.
Draco had been doing homework in the kitchen when he heard a knock on the door to their rooms. Harry paused on his broom, hanging upside down and looking at Draco curiously. "Who's that?"
"Harry..."
Harry gesticulated wildly as he spoke. Finally, he pulled his knees to his chest, buried his face in his knees and screamed.
"Potter." Voldemort hissed. Harry rose from his crouched position to stand, but kept his eyes downcast. He hadn't expected this so close to returning from school.
"Tempus." 3:46 a.m. Pleasant.
Harry punched him. Malfoy fell to the ground, clutching his nose. "Blaise, get him!" Malfoy cried out. Harry looked at Blaise, the dark skinned boy from the train, who took a small step back from him, raising his hands. "What the hell, Blaise?" Malfoy yelled, standing up. His nose was bleeding, the rug and his robes now dotted with red.
"So...Can you fix me now?" Harry looked at the two. Dumbledore's smile faltered a bit.
Draco sighed. Of course, why not?
"And Hermione, you called her a Mudblood. Why?" Harry leaned back in his chair, his hand dancing over his wand. He didn't know many spells, but maybe he could take Malfoy off guard.
A table, with different potions. A wall of black flames behind it, and a scroll. Just as had been described.
He knew she didn't believe him, but either she knew him well enough not to pry or felt like she couldn't after the friendship had tapered off somewhat. Harry heard a bark nearby. He turned to see Sirius galloping towards them with his tongue lolling out of his mouth. Harry smiled, tears pricking his eyes.
Again, a shake.
"On the train to Hogwar- wait, no, we met when we were getting our robes fixed, in Diagonally. In...Madam Malkin's, right?"
He took the first two stairs gingerly. When no sound met his eats, he walked quickly up, pausing at the top. There was a single hallway with three doors. Two of them were open; the last one was closed, at the end of the hallway.
A faint blue shimmer covered the tree, though Draco could see no particular effect. Still, he took a small step closer to the tunnel. The tree didn't move.
Hermione grabbed the meat, holding it out to the dog. She let go with a squeak when he got close to her hand, scared he would bite her, but he picked the meet up gently off the ground. Hermione gave him the next piece of her hand, which he again took gently.
Harry smiled at him, a little embarrassed. "Yeah, I am. Completely fine."
Harry frowned. "Kinda funny, it's weir-" Harry gasped, clutching his stomach and falling limp
"And I'm a Halfblood, you said."
"Get on, quick. Quickly!"
The pain stopped, and Draco's chest heaved. He rolled, seeing Harry staring at him with tears streaming down his face. He reached out to Harry with a trembling arm, unable to move further. The one holding Harry vanished through the floo, the other following. The final one shook his head, before a red light was shot at him and his world went black.
As Harry's wand clattered to the floor, falling out of his shrunken pocket, a sudden cry was heard from Lavender Brown in the back of the classroom. "He's so adorable! Look how tiny he is!"
"What is a snitch?"
Harry visibly struggled, a crease forming on his forehead. "I... I'm not sure, Sir." Snape nodded, as though he had never expected anything different.
He launched himself at the one holding Harry, a green light entering his vision. The last thing he heard was Harry's crying before his own screams interrupted the sound. Distantly, he heard laughing and crying, but Draco was distracted by the pain that was consuming him. He clawed at his throat, writhing on the floor. The crying became louder.
Harry's hands were numb. Everything felt numb. The wind was unforgiving at the breakneck speed they had been flying at, it was all Harry could do not to slip off his broom. His robes and scarf did very little to help. Lucius' warming charm had worn off a long time ago.
noise before he abandoned their chess game and slammed the door to their dormitory.
Harry pointed at his stomach. Looking down, Draco saw the large blood stain smeared around the lower half of his shirt. Draco waved the concern away. "Don't worry about it. It's okay, I promise. Just a shirt. Not nearly as important as you being okay."
of it. It was... pleasant in a way he didn't quite understand, but was beginning to grasp.
"Whatever it is, you're going to achieve it. You are so intelligent Harry. Nothing can stop you when you put your mind to it," Draco whispered in his ear, rubbing Harry's face with his ring softly. Harry smiled a little at the memory.
as the air left his body. Harry bounced back up quickly.
Draco ran. He threw open the trap door, not caring as it slammed against the floor. Holding Harry tightly, he jumped down the hole, barely keeping his balance enough to reach up.
"Harry, I'm going to try to fix your nose, okay? I don't know if it's broken but I want to make sure. It's going to sting a little bit, but then it'll feel better. Is that okay?" Draco asked quietly, still pulling Harry's hair out of his eyes repetitively since it seemed to be calming him down.
"What can Dinky do fo- is Master Potter okay? What is wrong? What can Dink-"
"I will not fail you, My Lord."
"Where is the Order of the Phoenix?"
Harry thought the dog was asking him the same thing. "It was, uh, the nickname of a friend I had. Just thought it suited him. He reminds me of them." Harry watched the dog carefully, who now sat in front of them.
What does that mean? People can't just turn into rats!"
"He's looking a bit healthier, isn't he?" Hermione knelt next to Snuffles, making them eye level. She was petting him, but then he moved forward until they were hugging. Hermione made a cooing noise that made Harry laugh.
"Do you have a problem, Malfoy?" Harry stood, puffing his chest out just a little bit. Malfoy sneered, and took a step back. Harry got the idea he wasn't expecting Harry to confront him so quickly.
you?" Harry barely heard the last part, the man said it so quietly.
Professor McGonagall arrived first. Shortly after her was Professor Flitwick. Draco realized he had summoned the heads of houses before Professor Snape, and Professor Sprout arrived.
"What is a basilisk? How could it be freezing the students like that?" Harry asked her, but Hermione was already paragraphs ahead of them.
Harry woke up to a tapping on his window. He rubbed his eyes, stumbling over to the little window in his room. He opened it, allowing Hedwig to fly in. She landed on the back of the chair he had against his desk, a letter tied to her leg.
"Did I tell you professor Lupin was going to give me some private lessons to help me with the dementors?"
Draco gave him a soft smile. That was about the same too.
Madam Pomfrey popped into the living room not five feet away from Draco. Poor Dinky looked traumatized. Madam Pomfrey shooed Draco out of the way, taking the towel with him.
Draco wrote down what had happened. He would need to tell this to Professor Dumbledore the next time he saw him. It didn't take him more than ten minutes to write it, though he left out specifics of how Harry calmed down and went back to bed.
charm on Harry, wondering if anyone inside the house would be able to hear his heartbeat past his spells. It trembled and settled on the stairs. He cast a
on himself. He couldn't think of anything else with his heart pounding in his ears.
Draco woke up from the sun attacking his eyes. He tried to turn away from it, but his left arm was asleep. His eyes blinked open rapidly to look at it, finding mini-Potter laying on it. Draco almost reflexively pushed Potter off of him -he hadn't slept with anyone else in the bed since he was six- until last night came flooding back. Draco rolled so he could keep him warm, looking down as he did so. Harry's hair covered most of his face, but Draco could see traces of an angry purple bruise forming around Harry's chin.
Draco started. He had been staring into space. "Yeah, what's up?" He banished the plates and leftovers into the kitchen where the house-elves would take care of it.
"No, I haven't tried to practice much, but I've been doing accidental magic for a long time. What kind of spells have you learned?"
"Do try and keep your head up. You'll get spinal and neck injuries later on in life," Draco spoke suddenly. Startled, Harry snapped his head up, before registering Draco's words. He fixed his askew glasses and brushed a piece of hair behind his ear, before his eyes returned to the ground again.
"Yeah, it's funny. He is really well-behaved," Harry paused for a moment, looking at Hermione sideways. "Think there are charms that could let me keep him without anyone else knowing?"
Harry walked into a giant mansion, Draco on his left and Malfoy Senior on his right. He didn't like the feeling of being herded. The giant double doors opened automatically. House elves (as Draco had taught him about) scurried across the house, making sure to stay very far from the footpath of the three. Mr. Malfoy gripped Harry's shoulder tightly, guiding him.
"I'm not sure what you mean."
- Draco paused for a moment, and then fake gasped. Harry looked alarmed.
"Yes Professor!" Voices rang out. Mcgonagall nodded slightly, and said nothing else on the matter. Soon, the class was busy writing notes, and the only whispers were complaints of hurt wrists and 'what did she just say?'
Maybe his
"But Hermione, you love research. And think of all the spells we'd learn! And we'd be able to feed Snuffles during meals and he could sleep in a comfy bed! And he'd be clean and everything!"
Draco took a breath to make sure his voice was steady. "Professor Dumbledore told me I should ask him some questions, since he seemed to be having some-some memory issues, or something." Draco hovered over Madam Pomfrey's shoulder, before her scathing glare sent him back. "It was normal, though I'm starting to think that his family wasn't so nice to him-"
"I have it." He spoke. He wasn't exactly sure how Voldemort communicated with him, if he could see him, hear what he said, or his thoughts, but regardless he knew.
Harry looked very uncomfortable. "Uhm, thank you? I'm sorry if this is terribly rude, but...what...are you?" Harry asked, looking down at the creature that wasn't much shorter than himself right now.
"Blasted subject. I never liked potions, pointless practice! Always caused too many lost limbs and dead animals! You couldn't even eat them after because they were too ruined by the stupid things!" Sir Mercy exclaimed, "I do hope you fix yourself soon, Hadrian. Stay away from potions, they never did anyone any good!" Sir Mercy crossed his arms, nose in the air. Harry was reminded a bit of Draco at the pose.
than a
He fell back, considering the night. He hated himself for letting this happen. Harry was in trouble, and Draco couldn't do anything.
He walked slowly across the room, hardly daring to breathe. The ten or so feet between him and the door felt like dozens. Eventually he neared the door, not daring to take his eyes off Nagini. He was almost out when her tongue flickered out, head moving just a bit. Draco froze.
"She knows something about the injuries, doesn't she?" Draco asked after a moment of silence. Severus looked at him carefully.
The walk seemed to go on forever. Though he couldn't tell if it was the actual distance, his anxiety, or the cramps in his back and neck that were telling him that. None of it mattered, anyways. Harry still needed his help.
to go. Where no one would question strange sounds and screams.
Harry gently pushed Snuffles off him. He looked at Hermione, who had a frown on her face. "I don't think they're anyway we can get him in. What about the dementors?"
They landed in a wide corridor covered in portraits from various centuries. Dinky lead them down the corridor. "Misters will be staying in a room guarded by a portrait of a very old vampire that was friends with Mr. Slytherin's Grandson! It's a very nice room, Dinky made sure it was perfect for Misters!"
Thank you to everyone who has reviewed! I'm so glad you're excited for this story. Enjoy!
, so Draco had high hopes for the next potion. Hadn't Madam Pomfrey said she could fix Harry's teeth without magic? Maybe Snape didn't need to account for the venom at all anymore. They could have another potion in two weeks, and Harry would be okay and back to normal and-
"This is moronic," Draco whispered. Harry lifted his head slightly. The Great Hall didn't allow for much privacy, but the clutter and noise kept them from being heard fairly well.
"Can I ask you something?" Harry's voice was quiet, but confident. Draco nodded, watching his thumb stroke Harry's jaw. "When you said you could do anything for me... did you mean it?"
"Dinky!"
The wardrobe rattled on its feet, then stopped. Harry grasped the handle, arm shaking as much as the wardrobe had been. He took a breath, closing his eyes. He needed this to work. The term was almost over, and he was running out of time.
"The Dark Lord has great plans for the next task." Moody said, eyes feverish. Understanding dawning like the flick of a switch, Harry steeled himself. He looked Moody -who seemed to be waiting for something- in the eye, and made his voice curious despite the disgust in his stomach.
"Who sent it, Harry dear?" Narcissa asked. Harry looked around for a note, but there was none.
"Yeah. And don't even mention that I was part of this, okay? I don't want to get the limelight cause I'm the Boy-Who-Lived. You guys deserve this, alright? I'll see you two at lunch," Harry smiled encouragingly at them, "now go, you have students to save."
Harry nodded. Draco pulled out his wand, all with Harry watching it carefully. Part of him wished Harry trusted him a little bit more, but the other part realized that was inappropriate for the situation. "Episkey!"
Murmurs of unfairness flitted throughout the room. "She's already got top marks! Why pick her?"
Harry walked up to the board, readying his wand.
"The potion is called Fes-Festina Tempus, and it reverts the drinker to a younger age," Fay Dunbar said quickly, a tall girl with long brown hair.
Harry stirred, and before Draco could decide if he should leave or not, big green eyes
He didn't know what time it was when he woke up again. The alarms went off loudly in his ears, and Draco almost face planted rushing to get out of his tangled sheets. He dismissed the alarms once more and stumbled into Harry's room.
With a slight grinding of stone, the statue shifted. Feeling elated, Draco bounded up the steps two at a time, banging loudly on the door to his office. Draco wanted to shout and scream to be let in, but part of him -the part that had grown up under his mother and father's grueling etiquette lessons- kept him from doing so. Another minute passed, feeling like an hour. Draco was ready to forgo his upbringing when he heard the Headmaster's voice.
Harry smiled softly at Draco, who stared at him for a moment before dropping his hand. "Well, happy birthday then, Scar-Head."
He grabbed the ladder with both hands, pausing. He swallowed painfully.
Harry grimaced, not sure if he wanted to be sharing a dorm with Malfoy for the next seven years, but what could be done? To the sound of staggered clapping, he sauntered over to the table, seating himself next to someone introduced himself as Theo. They shook hands, then went back to the sorting.
Draco wiped away tears that occurred at the thought of Harry getting tortured. When he focused back on it, he noticed two parallel lines that connected the Shrieking Shack to the Whomping Willow. Dracco stared at it for a moment, wondering what that meant. Pipes? A watering system?
"I am too," Draco admitted, "but you are going to be okay. I trust Madam Pomfrey and Professor Snape with my life and yours. I promise you'll be okay."
"I don't want to be a part of this. I did everything you asked. I'll stay out of your way, I just want to be left alone," Harry pleaded. Voldemort's smile grew wider.
"Yes, Madam Pomfrey," Draco shuffled his feet a little bit, feeling like he should be doing something, "do you really think he should sleep that much? It's not even dinner time."
The hall cheered, Harry politely clapped.
Their biggest milestone had happened over a week after Harry had taken the potion. Harry had proudly declared that Professor McGonagall could turn into a cat; Draco thought that was a small detail, and was extremely happy Harry had recalled it.
"Go get Madam Pomfrey, quickly!" Draco barked at her. She was gone within a moment. Draco cast an
"You... were freaking out, and I didn't-" Draco paused, unsure, "I didn't know what to do, but I needed to calm you down and this worked."
Harry moved along the bookshelves, until he finally got to the enormous P section. For some reason, these shelves were sorted by title, not author, but that was convenient enough for him.
Harry smiled, laughing at Snuffles, who had stumbled away from him to stare at him, face down by his paws, butt in the air and tail wagging furiously.
times, it activates a portkey. To me," he smiled triumphantly, then paused, "Well, to my ring. Then if you're in a pinch, you can escape to wherever I am."
Harry hadn't moved or spoken. Draco frowned at him. "Why don't you sit down? I'm going to need you to take a potion for me."
"As you both know, this is...a delicate matter we are dealing with at the moment. I need you both to be exceptionally cooperative for the time being. Madam Pomfrey has informed me that while the concoction Mr. Potter ingested is not physically harming, it is not good for him.
A heavy knock came from the door. "Come in."
While Harry sulked and Draco ignored him, an uncomfortable silence shrouded them, only interrupted by Harry's quick paces trying to keep up with Draco's long strides. Harry struggled with his feet and Draco studiously not-looking. By the time Harry had gotten the rhythm of his own legs, he was grateful that classes were still in session. He couldn't imagine the amount of ridicule people would put him through seeing himself in his mini-Hogwarts uniform and his stupid-looking tiny body.
"When we began this potion I thought I could be reassured that even your idiotic self could count ingredients, excuse me if I believed I was working with someone who wasn't a complete imbecile!" Draco snarled at Harry, whose ears were beginning to redden in frustration.
Draco wouldn't change it for the world. He buried his face in Harry's hair, wrapping his own arms around the little body. Harry was crying into his neck, though Draco paid no mind to it. Harry was okay, and was in his arms, and Draco didn't give a damn if the Headmaster and his godfather were watching him.
Over at Neville's desk, a large pot with a nauseating green glow illuminated his face, along with the face of a very irritated Pansy Parkinson. Professor Slughorn didn't seem to have any advice for the pair, completely astonished by their ruined potion.
Draco stood motionless for several moments, Harry feeling like lead in his arms. He wouldn't risk trying to stun or harm the snake, but he had to get past it to get to the door.
Harry woke up with a bright light in his eyes. Flinching, he groaned. His head pounded something
"How'd you get your letter?"
"No." His voice shook just a little bit.
He saw the tears in Harry's eyes, and decided that who they were didn't matter. He pulled Harry close to himself, who clung to him. He rocked him back and forth, not saying anything as Harry cried into his shoulder.
Dumbledore had come by yesterday with Weasley and Granger, but Harry hadn't known who any of them were and had hid behind the couch and refused to come out.
He rolled over and got up as quick as he could, but he was only seven, and not very strong.
One thing he knew was how cruel Voldemort could be, and there wasn't a doubt in his mind that this was his fault.
Draco turned. Harry looked absolutely lost and unsure of himself. It made Draco's heart go out to him, for all that would embarrass him later. But that didn't matter; this wasn't the Potter that refused his hand, this was a scared, maybe abused seven year old.
Tears slipped silently from Harry's face onto Draco's shirt. Draco held him tighter as Harry's body trembled.
he had watched them from a distance, excited to see them get whacked by the tree. To his dismay, they had vanished somewhere by the roots.
"And now I don't know what to believe. Did you kill thirteen people including Pettigrew? Well, I know part of that is
The man had been surprisingly quiet while they had rode over the ocean. It wasn't until they had started to see land again that he began to speak. When he did, Harry purposefully let himself gradually drift to the back of the group.
"Well
"You need to take this, Harry," Draco said, taking the stopper off. Harry scrunched his nose at it.
"You should be finishing up now. Please bottle up a sample of your potion and write your name on the bottle before turning it in! Neatly, mind you! And don't empty your cauldrons yet!" Professor Slughorn announced. Soon the sounds of quills scratching and clinking bottles filled the room. A murmur of voices penetrated the humidity, of people groaning and complaining and wondering just what they had done to make the universe hate them.
He was carried up a shaky staircase that he thought would crash at any moment. The wood was rotten and peeled, dust raining down on them as they climbed.
Harry leaned forward to kiss him again. Draco met him this time, letting the soft kiss sooth his frazzled nerves.
Harry smacked him, which Draco ignored. "She's smart, helps me a lot with my schoolwork. And she is actually a decent person. And, oh yeah, I enjoy her company, unlike some," Harry drawled, raising his eyebrows at Draco as a challenge.
He stood and circled the tree several times, each minute feeling like torture as it passed. Harry was in
He couldn't get enough. Harry pulled away and Draco followed him, kissing his cheeks and nose and jaw and anything else he could reach, muttering all the while and listening to Harry giggle.
He gave Harry his clothes, who changed in the living room. Draco decorated their mugs with marshmallows and whipped cream, and brought them into the living room to see Harry already sitting on the couch and snuggling Snuffles.
"Take your time eating, I'm going to shower, okay?"
The door shook, before it was ripped off its hinges. A large figure stood in the doorway, walking in to the thumping pattern Harry had heard. The man placed the door back where it had been, more jamming it in place than really fixing it. Harry heard Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia walk down the stairs, and heard Dudley wake up. As Uncle Vernon cocked his shotgun, The man smiled.
on the rag, getting in damp before brushing Harry's fringe out of his eyes.
Professor Lupin smiled. "Chocolate?" He asked, reaching into his pocket. Harry laughed, accepting some.
"I-I could be wrong, Professor. That's just something I overheard Lucius say. And even he could be wrong, he was talking about stuff from, like, a decade ago." Harry knew he was absolutely right about Pettigrew being a Death Eater. And he knew Sirius wasn't one, he didn't have the Mark. But he had to convince Lupin about that without giving it away.
Draco waited an extra few minutes to be sure. He needed to write Professor Snape, but... but Harry was fine. The potion had done
He seemed too. His shoulders sagged a bit, and Harry felt him relax, before they tensed up again once more. "You didn't choose to work with them? You're not...did they
"Is it going to hurt?" Harry whispered.
Draco paced in front of the statue, a distant part of him glad that it and Dumbledore would be the only witnesses to his puffy eyes and wrinkled clothes.
His eyes were puffy, his cheeks bright red. Silence had descended while Draco worked -there was a lot of blood- but when Draco was done Harry spoke softly. "M'sorry, Dray."
Harry's frustration reached it's point. "She crucio'd me and who knows how many other students. I just need a
"Wh-what?" Draco sat up, rubbing sleep out of his eyes. "What are you doing here?"
Even that Harry didn't think he could talk about. So he said nothing and let the tears fall. Draco brushed some of them away with the hand that wasn't wrapped around Harry.
Draco placed a few alarms around Harry's bed, and went into his own room to take a shower. Perhaps the potion fumes had gotten to him. He wasn't acting like he should, around Potter.
"Sorry," Harry murmured. Malfoy snapped his head back to look at the mini-Harry, surprised by his words. "I think I'm kinda acting like I had when I was...whatever age. Five or somethin'..." Harry trailed off as he shifted his shoulder, a small wince contorting his face. Harry desperately hoped that he wouldn't have to stay like this for very long. He could feel numerous bruises on his arms and legs, and what he distinctly remembered to be a burn from a fire poker that had turned into a scar. He couldn't remember exactly what made Vernon believe that was necessary, but he remembered it happened soon after Petunia made him start helping with the flower garden in the backyard.
It was their second visit, and they had found Snuffles rather quickly, to their surprise.
"Almost dinner time, 'Mione," Harry murmured, gently blowing on his essay to dry the ink. He was almost done, he'd spend another half hour or so on it and it'd be ready by Thursday's class.
"Dinky will be back with supper for Misters Potter and Malfoy," Dinky said, before popping away.
Harry passed the Hufflepuff banner, looking behind him to see it flapping furiously behind him. He shot upwards, almost going to the clouds before he let himself fall backwards.
which would get the dog wet, but he didn't remember a drying spell that he could say was safe for animals.
Professor Slughorn gave a small frown as he noticed large, hand-print shaped bruises littering Harry's forearms where his sleeves had been rolled up.
Afraid to frighten Harry further, Draco continued his breakfast with slow movements, watching Harry out of the corner of his eye. Right before his hand made it back to his plate, Draco jerked.
Draco felt his lip tremble.
"Festina Tempus. Madam Pomfrey, may I go now? I'll be late to transfiguration," Draco cut. Harry shot him a slightly hurt look which Draco again, pointedly ignored, glancing meaningfully to the clock.
It was a long moment before he remembered that Harry's legs didn't reach his. He froze, afraid to open his eyes. Was he dreaming? Was he dead?
The mutt nipped at her. "I think he disagrees with you," Harry said, laughing. Hermione rolled her eyes.
"Well, Mr. Potter, you are welcome to leave anytime. I promise you, your destination will be death," Voldemort turned away from him, instead moving his eyes back to his wand, "now, the task I have planned for you is simple."
"'Ello there little 'Arry!"
Draco noticed a piece of parchment on his trunk, folded and addressed to him. Harry wasn't with him anymore, so he opened it.
"Can I sit with you on the ride? I don't really know anyone," she asked, looking up at Harry. Though she seemed confident, Harry could tell she was a bit nervous.
"Yes, My Lord."
Harry could hear the smile in Sirius' voice when he spoke. "A nickname my old schoolmates gave me," he said, gripping Harry's shoulder for a moment. Harry was about to shrug off his hand, Sirius
"No, I'll keep smacking you every time you say that word."
Harry's lips were soft and delicate. Draco was afraid he would crush them. Harry didn't seem to share his fear. Harry pulled him impossibly closer, making Draco's head spin and his heart race.
Draco opened the door a little further. The snake didn't move. Wondering what god was on his side that day that allowed his luck, he looked around the room, not daring to step inside.
"Woah,
Dumbledore be able to find him? Get past whatever protective charms they had placed? What would Draco do if Dumbledore couldn't?
He fell onto the floor, something tangling his legs and his head knocking off the side of the table. Forehead throbbing, Draco stood up and stumbled, taking in the blurry scene and reaching for his wand. Three cloaked figures were a meter away from him. One stood by the floo, another next to them and their wand pointed at Draco. The final one was retreating away, holding a screaming and flailing Harry.
he could at the tree and leaped out of its range. It didn't completely immobilize it, but it did slow it down enough for Draco to make it out with only a scratch on his cheek from a small branch.
"I fell off the bed... I had a nightmare, and then-then the sheets were getting all tangled and I wanted to get away and-and I fell off."
Draco changed his own clothes next, feeling almost like a new man with a freshening charm to get the grime from the tunnel off. Madam Pomfrey had cast one on Harry at some point, though Draco wasn't sure when. This day already felt too long.
. Dumbledore said it was between Hogsmead and the forest. He moved further away from the castle.
"Yes. Today." They stood in the middle of the hallway, Harry swaying gently on his feet and Draco still holding him tightly.
"And a
"Yeah, that'd be great. I don't really know anyone either," Harry smiled, "why don't we get your trunk in here so it isn't blocking the doorway?"
Draco's head popped up. Harry stood in the doorway, still holding the stuffed dog, curling his toes.
"Rowle, Crouch, Lestrange's."
"Potter, I can't-"
...Don't be mad? Or if you are, tell me about it! I get satisfaction from causing you anguish, I'll be honest. Have a wonderful quarantine guys! See you next week!
It was during dinner about ten days after the potion that Draco caught Harry tapping on his canines. "Harry?" He asked. Harry dropped his hand immediately, giving Draco an innocent smile before shoveling potatoes in his mouth.
Harry slowed his broom at Lucius's signal. They surrounded the building, Harry following closely behind Pettigrew. Soon they were in position, the highest level of the back of the building. The person Harry assumed was Dolohov went around the front. Seconds after he left Harry's sight, a loud
Now that he was ten and had been able to get his basic necessities out of the way, he was beginning to buy some other stuff that he needed. A new toothbrush made him feel better all over, and a hairbrush calmed his hair down so he wouldn't stand out so much.
Draco shifted, a hand reaching towards Harry. Harry caught it with his own softly. Draco tugged him, muttering a "come 'ere." Harry went, tucking himself underneath Draco's chin and feeling utterly
Harry stood, wand in hand. "
behind it. Dudley went sprawling, his nose bleeding heavily. Pierce backed up slowly, before running away. Dudley cried, holding his nose.
"That's the word... He... uses."
Harry had never said Snape was mean.
"He's teaching me a spell that seventh years get taught, and even most of them aren't successful. It's a patronus charm, or something. It draws on happy memories to create this thing that makes the dementors go away, but it doesn't really help with anything else."
He was about two meters from the entrance when Draco saw a branch twitch. He froze, not wanting to move while also wanting to dive for the entrance. He took a small step closer, and then the tree was
but Professor Snape was the most talented potions master there was. Draco trusted him. Draco doubted there was another option Snape didn't know about.
Draco glared at him. "You think I'm stupid? It's warded against everyone except Mother, Father, and you. What's a locked door going to do against a wizard, you muggle-lover?"
He conjured a mirror, carefully applying the cream to the cut on his cheek. He hadn't even felt it, mostly. It felt so small in comparison to everything else. It started to scab immediately. Draco suspected it would be gone in a few hours.
Hermione ran up next to him, before slowly approaching the dog. When he happily put his head into Hermione's outstretched hand, she giggled.
"SLYTHERIN!"
"Will you stay with me?" Harry whispered. Draco's lip quivered, then he smiled.
"They're going to think I brainwashed you," Draco said after a moment.
Hermione brought the soft turquoise liquid to her lips, almost sloshing some onto her uniform as she shook her hair out of the way. She drained the liquid quickly, and set the potion down before a look of slight pain came over her face. Harry would never tell her it looked like she was constipated.
The map only covered the edges of Hogsmead. Draco almost ripped the map in half when he realized. Still, he diligently searched the names and houses, skipping by
It  feels like they're everywhere, seeping into Hogwarts or something. You remember what happened on the train, right?
"I can make them believe me," Harry said with confidence, leaning back to look at Draco with shining eyes. "They'll have to adjust."
Fifth year had probably been the calmest in awhile. Voldemort has needed Moody -or Barty Crouch Jr, or whatever- for other tasks Harry wasn't allowed to know about, so Professor Dolores Umbridge had taken his place. While her class wasn't riveting, it was easy, which Harry appreciated. Until she had given Harry detention for discussing other, more advanced defense spells with Draco during work time. It had started an argument on whether or not the advanced spells were even usable -of course they were- and she said waved them off with a sweet smile and syrupy giggle.
Harry felt shame in his participation. He and Draco had been weakening the chain throughout the last two champions events, and all it had taken was a good tug by the time it had been blasted. He hoped sincerely that professor Lupin had passed his concerns on to Dumbledore, that there needed to be some extra security around the students, something to make
Dumbledore looked at Draco for a long second. "I can't tell any closer, I'm afraid. I will contact the Ministry tonight, and hopefully Aurors will be searching by morning. You should rest, Mr. Malfoy." Dumbledore told him gently.
, he had to
on it, but magical snakes were too different to regular snakes. The chance his spell would bounce off its scales was too great. Even if it did land, there was no guarantee it would do anything besides wake it up.
Harry flung the door open. The necklace was gone.
But they had developed a nice routine. Harry took his nourishment potion easily, and over breakfast they would talk about Harry's life. Draco would try to ask questions, but this morning Harry barely remembered what Hogwarts was.
"Be a good boy Snuffles, we'll see you around." Harry said. Hermione gave the dog a hug, and Snuffles licked the side of her face. He licked Harry's hand, and then trotted off in the direction of the whomping willow.
A single projection hovered above the maze: a camera into the center, where the shiny golden cup rested. Harry hoped that whatever happened, it wasn't as bloody and crude as Voldemort had been in the past.
As the last of the students left the classroom, Harry watched Professor Quirrell straighten his back. With a flick of his wand, Harry heard the door click shut. He backed away from the Professor who stared at him. In a moment, his demeanor had changed dramatically from what Harry had known the past six months.
Madam Pomfrey had left a little while ago, ordering him to 'stay put less I glue you to that bed, Mr. Potter' and had then bustled off out the room. He looked down at his feet, chuckling at the fact that they finally fit him. And to think, all it had taken was being shrunk to...whatever age he was to have proper fitting shoes for once.
He heard Harry flying between rooms and hallways, wondering if there were other things his body remembered but his mind didn't. Maybe he could cast some first year spells, or knew how to play exploding snap.
There was a pause. Dumbledore gave him a long look, and then a reassuring smile. Draco didn't feel much better from it. "The fireplace is completely blocked," he started quietly, "but I'm sure some extra precaution would help everyone's piece of mind. I will go with you, and ward it myself to the best of my abilities."
"Oh yes, I do tend to keep it dim, Fawks gets moody if he isn't one of the brighter objects in the room. Why don't you cast a lumos so you can see better, I'm sure Fawks wouldn't mind." Dumbledore smiled at Harry reassuringly.
," he whispered, his reverence clear. "But nothing he would trust you two for. Your plans will focus on the third, yes." Moody stomped his wooden leg excitedly. "But this task...did you know the Mer-people have wanted to eat the children who come into the Black Lake?" He asked them.
Harry dipped down, hoping under the cover of darkness the rest of the group wouldn't notice him. "Good luck. Try and stay safe," Harry told him, quickly letting him off the broom. Sirius's smile was almost blinding, despite the yellow teeth.
During breakfast the third day after Harry took the potion, Draco started the same way he always had the last few weeks.
Harry bit his lip, before he dug into his bag. He handed Hermione a few gallons. "Go to the three broomsticks and see if you can find anything that we can feed it. Chicken or fish or something, and no cooked bones, they splinter and could choke him." Hermione smiled at him warmly, then darted away.
"Why are you mixed up with this bunch, Harry? What happened?" He spoke quietly into Harry's ear, startling him.
Draco discarded it.
He turned back. "Harry Potter. See you at Hogwarts." Harry quickly walked away, catching the startled expression of both Draco and Madam Malkin as he checked out, not quite understanding why.
His wand felt better in his hand. It hadn't felt right before, like it was wrong and didn't like him. This was like the first time touching it in Ollivanders.
"And what did Petunia tell you about Hogwarts?"
Draco peaked into Harry's room, which was identical to his own, except his had a color scheme of blues and purples. Draco was a little surprised by that, he expected Gryffindor colors, but perhaps Dinky decided to do something else.
With a soft smile, she added two to his bag. "Only one in a twenty-four hour period," she backed away, hands folding behind her.
Weasley's nickname for him- but accepted the gift with his nose in the air. Harry sat back easily and watched him open it. Thanks to this, he was able to see Draco's hands stutter when he saw it.
Draco's throat felt like it had closed. Would that be better? Worse? If Harry forgot all that he had done, the way he had acted, rescued him, and went on not having any idea of Draco's feelings? Maybe he could start over, try and win Harry's affections anyways.
He had to take that chance, and move fast. That was all he could do. The door opened without a problem. Draco was met with dust clouds and rotten wooden boards that made up the entirety of the floor, likely the house. Grimacing a little, Draco crawled out on his hands and knees, coming to a defensive stance with his hand in his hand immediately. There was no one.
Harry knew which bedroom Pettigrew slept in. He'd been watching, waiting. And tonight would be his opportunity.
The change was miraculous. He seemed like a whole different dog, almost. His hair was trimmed, his fur clean, matted hair gone, teeth almost sparkling white, gunk cleaned out from around it's eyes, minor scratches healed. A few now-dead bugs fell out of his fur, though Harry almost vomited when the dog shook and more flew off.
now that he was...normal? He looked down at himself to check. Normal feet, normal hands, normal legs. He looked back at Draco. "Is he..."
"I need to tell Snape."
Dudley was pulled from school early. When Harry got home he was greeted by Uncle Vernon  ranting about how the floors of the playground were too uneven, and
"I don't know, but this is amazing! Can we go flying after Christmas dinner?" Harry asked, Narcissa's smile giving him the answer he wanted. Lucius nodded after a moment.
He walked down the next corridor, hearing the fluttering sounds before he saw them. He stepped into a cavern full of flying keys. A door he hadn't realized was there snapped shut behind him. Harry took a breath.
"The Dark Lord has
Harry stared up at him for a moment, confusion furrowing his eyebrows. "Dragons aren't real," Harry said, though he sounded fairly unsure of himself.
"Yes it is. Use the power wisely," Draco warned. Harry laughed a little, but then he was too busy drinking.
That was the fourth boy on Harry's boat to the castle, an Irish lad who seemed decent, if not a little chaotic.
Draco let out a small noise of frustration. He walked up the spiral staircase, intending to take a hot shower to help his nerves, but he swerved into Harry's room instead. Draco walked quietly into the room, getting an odd twinge in his chest when he realized how small Harry looked in the four-poster bed.
Malfoy ran out of brooms first. Harry handed out the last of his, but a few yelling people were still calling for his attention. Draco had a skinny, dark haired man on the back of his broom, while somebody else had taken a stocky, short woman on the back of theirs. Harry flew to an inmate who wasn't calling, but was transfixed on Harry. His eyes glinted.
Draco only nodded, watching her retreating back for a moment. He put a hand to Harry's forehead, brushing back his hair lightly. "I'm so sorry Harry," he whispered, choking up. Harry shifted a bit, leaning into Draco's touch. A single sob escaped him, but he refused to cry. Harry needed someone strong right now, and Draco would be
"No Master has ever wanted to shake Dinky's hand! Oh thank you Sir, so kind! Dobby is true what he says about Sir Potter!" She cried out.
Harry smiled a little bit. "I think Mr. Lordly is going to be very angry."
"Yes, My Lord."
"Mr. Malfoy, here," Madam Pomfrey interrupted, handing Draco a few potions. "These are for you. Take them, and try to get some rest. Both of you," she ordered, looking between them. Harry nodded quickly, though Draco was confused.
He gave her a small treat, stroking her behind her ear as he gently untied the letter. He sat back down as he unrolled the parchment.
Pettigrew was known to leave at random hours on missions for Voldemort. What they were, no one knew. Harry didn't care, really. But Pettigrew hadn't been sent away in awhile. Voldemort no longer used Lucius' house as his home.
Harry sat on the floor of the little cabin. Wind pounded against the walls, making Harry think the whole hut would blow over any second. He drew a cake on the floor using dust, giving it eleven candles. As the watch on his wrist beeped, he blew his drawing away. "Happy birthday, Harry," He murmured to himself.
"Yes Sirs!" She called, gently taking Draco's hand. She left as soon as she dropped him off. Draco couldn't stand to look at the living room. He went to Harry's room, eyes watering. He might never get to hold Harry in here again. He sat on the bed, head in his hands.
"You need to watch him closely, Draco. If anything seems unusual, take him to Madam Pomfrey immediately. Have a house-elf bring you. She knows exactly what's going on."
Draco thought for a moment.
"That's good," Draco nodded, "do you hurt anywhere at all?" Harry shook his head. "Okay, will you come with me to the couch then so I can put this on you?" This time Harry followed, and allowed Draco to gently apply the paste. It probably needed to be rubbed in rather than just layered on top as Draco had done, but he didn't want to cause Harry more pain than Draco thought he might be in.
Harry watched, enchanted as the statue rotated, revealing a staircase. They entered, Harry smiled gleefully at sparkling, whirling, twirling trinkets around the room. He spotted Fawks, proud and prime and preening. Harry petted him gently, giggling as he was nudged back.
Draco pushed the thought of Potter's hurt eyes out of his head. It wasn't his problem anymore.
- looked at him, his head bowed.
"Come along, Mr. Potter." Madam Pomfrey led him to an empty bed, ordered him to sit and stay. Lights flickered and flared as she cast diagnostic spells on him. "Which potion?"
He followed Professor Dumbledore through the empty hallways, wondering if Dumbledore had purposefully waited until they would be empty to fetch him.
Snape nodded curtly, holding out a thin bottle with a wide base, a turquoise liquid sloshing inside. "I believe if Mr. Potter takes this tonight, he should wake up tomorrow normal."
"The basilisk is a type of serpent, known as the King of Serpents, that can grow on average fifty feet in length. It's ability to kill victims by staring at them had lead to it's deep affiliation with the Dark Arts,"
He felt stupid saying the password to a statue. He checked his surroundings quickly, only speaking once he was sure no one was around to hear him. "Blood pops."
Harry rolled his eyes. "Is that necessary? How would you even know if I was telling the truth?"
Wait...what?
Harry left without a second glance.
"It's fair when I warn you-"
Hate was clear in his eyes as Draco corked the bottle and shoved it at Harry. Reflexively, Harry took it, lest it crash and break on the floor. Who knew what this monstrosity would do to the floor...who knew what it would do to him.
When was the last time he had visited his owl? When was the last time Harry had?
Harry grabbed Draco by his shirt collar -when had he gotten so
Harry's eye twitched. He didn't like the voice. He didn't understand how it was happening, but it wasn't a new sensation by now. Voldemort had decided in the last month that he needed to prepare more, practice more, strategize more, learn more...
Draco sat on the couch for a moment, head in his hands. He noticed the broken tea cup, and absentmindedly fixed the cup and dried the stain. He'd been with Potter for less than an hour and he was already convinced this would be the death of him.
She had to know something more was going on to Harry than just clumsiness, Draco was sure. Draco returned to his meal, setting aside the balm and a green bottle. He was almost done by the time Harry stepped quietly around the corner, pausing at the entryway. Draco wouldn't have heard him if his back had been facing him.
Hermione sighed. "We can go to the library Sunday, but you have to know it's not a good idea, Harry."
He had been summoned only an hour ago. The Dark Lord knew something had happened to Potter, though he didn't know what. Severus had been punished harshly for his inability to give information on what had happened. His body was still trembling from the Cruciatus curse.
He walked out, closing to the door to the sounds of groans behind him. Cracking open the scroll once more, he found his eyebrows raising.
Harry cast every destructive spell he knew. The chess pieces blew into pieces, exploded, were cut in half, knocked over, anything he could do to get past them. Harry ran and jumped over the rumble, blasting the door open and slamming it closed behind him.
At first, Draco had had to smother his laughter, but as Harry's trembling turned to convulsions he began to worry. He sat up in his chair, leaning over the cursed cauldron as he and the rest of the class wondered if they were about to see the end of the Boy-Who-Lived.
He called Dinky again. "To Professor Snape, please." She popped away as he noticed Harry lingering in the doorway. He seemed a little less pale, perhaps, but the bruise still stood out on his skin. Draco realized he had forgotten about the healing balm after what happened at breakfast.
Harry played with his fork, watching Draco nervously. After a moment, he shook his head, shrugging. Draco stifled his disappointment.
"Harry! We have no way of knowing if he'll follow us! He could walk right off with the cloak and you'd lose something of your fathers! And that thing is priceless, and who knows if he'd even keep it on! I've never seen a dog willingly keep something on."
"Draco, sit down and calm yourself," Severus watched him until he did so, shame coloring his face red. "I think he'll remember everything up until the age he is now. Some extremely prominent memories will likely leave an impression for longer. There's no telling if they'll come back when the potion gets out of his system..." Severus trailed off, looking in the direction Harry had gone. "If it changes him back at all," he murmured.
He really hoped they would fade, but he didn't think they would...Harry hung his head again, feeling the ache and trying to ignore it. It was so much more pronounced now...Harry had built up what he thought was an impressive pain tolerance the last few years, and now he suspected that tolerance did not stick with him. He wasn't sure if it was a psychological thing or because of calluses or whatever, but now...he was feeling the pain so vividly, and it was disconcerting and uncomfortable for him.
"Do you think Professor Sprout knows that?" Harry asked.
Harry and Draco shared a glance. "You will also be battered relentlessly with learning new offensive spells, and I expect you both to work tirelessly in both areas. To your rooms, now."
Harry zipped off into the  night, quickly catching back up to the pack. He watched them carefully, though no one seemed to notice his sudden rejoin.
Looking around himself, Draco tried to remember the last time he had it. The living room, wasn't it? Swallowing roughly, Draco walked into the living room.
Harry cheered as Hermione got off the stool, smiling wide. She sat close to where he was in the line, and gave him a thumbs up. He smiled back at her, glad that she was happy with her house.
- and yanked him close. He crushed Draco's lips with his own, or at least tried to. It was only a moment before Draco was kissing him as feverishly as Harry was. When Harry pulled back, he was breathing heavy and his heart was racing faster than when he'd killed Voldemort.
"Thank you Hermione! This is much better."
He could... manipulate Potter a bit, couldn't he? Get him to think more like a Slytherin. Why not? It would be fun, seeing Harry act weirdly towards his Gryffindor friends while getting along just fine with Draco...
Still, it sickened him, watching Harry lay there like he was dead. It was some time later when Draco had collapsed in an armchair with his head in his hands that she spoke to him.
"Perhaps only telling him Mr. Potter was involved in potions would be enough."
"I just- I just need to tell him, and then I think so." Harry swayed again, dangerously close to falling. Draco caught him and held him tightly.
A cruel smile came to the man's thin lips. "Don't be stupid, Potter. I doubt you can handle a
And Draco might lose him. His hand stalled.
"Are you done eating?" He asked. Harry shook his head, no longer crying but still looking teary.
"All the better! This time you'll learn from the best Quidditch player there is." Draco declared, making Harry giggle.
"How does breakfast in bed sound?"
"One more thing, Mr. Potter," she said, going to her desk. "Here is your wand - I had it brought here from your rooms after Mr. Malfoy brought you. If you would please cast a
Most of the Death Eaters had died. Some had fled. Harry was banged up, but he was sure he'd be fine. He knew he was safe now. A lot of it had been luck; no one had suspected Harry to attack them, even after finding Voldemort's body.
Harry felt as if he had missed something as he looked between the two.
"Couple sleepless nights, I've found that I can do really anything when I put my mind to it." Harry shrugged, enjoying the incredulous look Draco was giving him.
Harry clapped again, giving Neville a wide smile. The boy smiled back, even as his legs shook a little as he walked over. He sat close to a pair of twins who wasted no time in vigorously shaking his hand. Neville seemed to feel a bit better after that.
"No, and I doubt Professor Slughorn does either. Even making it a priority, it will take over a week to produce, likely closer to two. Maybe discussing things related to his life will keep his memory longer." Severus said quietly. His eyes moved to the bruise balm.
she appeared, curtsying deeply. "What can Dinky be doing for Master Malfoy Sirs?"
Dumbledore sat at his desk, still in his phoenix pajamas. His elbows on the desk, his head resting on his hands. He watched Severus pace in front of him.
"Everything is ready for masters!" Dinky said, her shrill voice making the boys flinch.
Harry followed him, hovering by his head. How he had broken the safety enchantments on that thing, Draco wasn't sure, but he knew Harry was more than capable on it. He wasn't worried about it anymore.
"Well done Ms. Granger!" Professor Slughorn praised, and Hermione had a small hop to her step as she went back to her desk next to Blaise Zabini.
to be there. There was no other way. Draco threw the map into the trunk, putting his shoes and cloak on faster than he ever had in his life.
Draco paused, floundering for a moment. "Harry, we could die-"
He laid Harry down gently. He pulled the sheets up to Harry's neck, covering his arms and the werewolf stuffed animal he held.
Harry felt like he was about to collapse. He'd spent weeks working on this stupid wardrobe. He knew his schoolwork had tanked, that his teachers were disappointed of him because of it. He couldn't care less.
, Draco thought, determination flooding him. He would find Harry, and Harry would be perfectly fine and healthy and not a hair on his head would be out of place.
Harry hadn't left Draco's room until this morning. He seemed recovered, but Draco still thought the whole incident should have been avoided. This morning had been full of questions about Weasley and Granger. It had yielded few results.
Hermione's eyes began to water. She roughly pushed past the two, nearly knocking Draco over.
The sun set behind the Forbidden forest, dusk falling upon the Quidditch pitch. Harry paid it no mind as he pushed his broom to it's limits. Hermione had been very happy for him, though the fact that she couldn't figure out who had given him the broom frustrated her.
"I'm not sure," Harry looked away from him, back at the mirror. He almost laughed when he heard a frustrated little huff to the side, barely audible over the noise of the shop. The boy didn't seem to appreciate being ignored. Harry felt all the better about his choice.
Now with a full stomach, Snuffles trotted happily between Harry and Hermione. The blue light between them was Harry's only indication that Snuffles was actually there. They got to the entrance to the Quidditch pitch, where Harry removed the cloak and the spell from the happy dog.
"Looks happier too. Think we can sneak him into the kitchens, get him some food?" At Harry's words, Snuffled yipped at him, jumping on Harry and putting his paws on his shoulders. Harry laughed as Snuffles licked his cheek, leaving it slobbery. "Eugh, gross!"
"No, Blaise! That's Harry Potter, who I told you about!" Draco said, stepping in front of him. "Harry, good to see you again. I'm sure you remember me. And you are?" He looked at Hermione, who looked a lot more uncomfortable than she had been a moment ago.
For not
Professor Snape paced in his quarters. Moonlight shone through the enchanted window -he didn't get any real light in the dungeon- casting a glow on the bubbling potion that he still had on a stasis charm.
at the door. He opened it slowly, peering inside. He almost gasped. Through the crack he could see Nagini, a
"It's okay, you're okay. You didn't do anything wrong, that was my fault," Draco said quietly. He had been too harsh, pushed Harry too much. Usually they went about it much slower, taking time to think about it and explain. He had stressed Harry out. He felt horrible about it. They stayed like that for a moment, before he pulled Harry away and bent down to look at him evenly. He wiped the tears from his face with his thumbs.
"He'd hardly admonish me for it. I don't care at this point. Are you going to help me or not?"
"How long until his memory is gone, do you think?" Draco wrung his hands in his lap until Severus shot a pointed look at his hands. His white-knuckle grip loosened. Severus was right, there was no need for that right now, it wouldn't help.
It was difficult to run crouched while carrying Harry, but he couldn't allow himself to slow, or for fatigue to catch him. Harry still hadn't woken up, hadn't moved or made a sound. Draco was terrified.
Harry frowned. "You mean the inquisitorial squad?"
Snape looked at him for a long moment. Harry held eye contact. "What potion do you need?"
Lucius had taught him the Fiendfyre curse two years ago. Harry had never used it until this day. It lashed out of his wand, straight at Nagini who was midair with her fangs out. She was too slow, unlike all the other times Harry had seen her strike with deadly precision.
On the very edge lay
What's her name?" She asked excitedly. Harry laughed a little bit, he'd never met someone so enthusiastic and...nice.
She wiggled a blackened nail at him, cooing and shaking her hair. Harry winced as a greasy curl fell in his face. "Aren't you so cute and stupid?" She cackled, pinching his cheek hard enough to break the skin. Harry sobbed quietly, any hope he had fleeing him.
coming to where the map ended. Draco wanted to cry. He searched again.
"I like it," Hermione said slowly. She smiled then, petting Snuffles around the ears. "Okay, then. Snuffles," Hermione declared proudly. Harry smiled, before he frowned a bit at seeing students starting to trudge back to Hogwarts.
"I was so hungry! That's not fair!" Harry draped himself across Draco's lap, looking at the ceiling. Draco wondered if he was the reason Harry was acting dramatic. The thought made him smile.
"Drop me here, behind that building."
As he was counting the hours in his head, the soft padding of feet met his ears. "Dray?" A small voice asked.
He waited.
he? Draco was stupid to have thought he wouldn't notice. But he didn't think Harry wouldn't
"I asked him about You-Know-Who and as soon as I said his name he freaked out. He grabbed his head and looked like he was in a lot of pain, and then he just-he fainted!"
froze. Harry covered his face with his hands and let out a muffled groan.
Harry almost snapped his head up in shock. Minister Crouch? Last Harry had heard, the man had been denying any claim of Death Eater presence at any of the sites of ransacking that had happened lately. These ransackings tended to end in death, specifically of those that had claimed to be under imperius during the trials years before. The most recent had been the Avery household.
"Try and rest, Mr. Malfoy," Madam Pomfrey said quietly, drawing the curtains around his and Harry's bed to connect so other students wouldn't see. Draco watched her leave before looking back at Harry. His breathing was even and peaceful.
He heaved a breath in relief before the sent hit him.
"I can't... some of it is blurry. I could be mistaken about my charms. It all... happened so fast... and I was so concerned about Harry..." Draco stammered, struggling to explain. His emotions had been surging the entire time.
"Can I take it now?"
Harry lunged to crab a corner of the desk, catching himself as his foot got tangled in his pant leg. He looked up at the professor with a frown, face flaming as half the class cooed and the other half laughed. "Oh dear, those are a little big now, aren't they? Yes, yes..." Slughorn gave a forced chuckle at his attempt to lighten the mood, before quickly dropping the amused expression and murmuring a few words to readjust Harry's clothes
"They're not mine." Harry glared at him, walking out of his room and shutting the door sharply. He walked down the staircase, Draco behind him.
He circled the tree again. He had no idea how close it would let him go until it attacked, but he kept a wide berth. It's swaying seemed to pick up; Draco had the distinct feeling it knew what he was trying to do.
Harry didn't move. Draco wasn't going to give him the potion until he said something, wanting to wait as long as he could.
Harry told Draco he'd meet him in the Great Hall soon. He waited until the rest of the potions class filtered out, then walked up to Snape. "I need your help."
"Headmaster?" Draco asked. Dumbledore's eyes flicked to him for a moment before returning to the sphere.
The man smiled wider than Harry thought anyone else had. "I'm Sirius Black. Please Harry, you know me. Let me on your broom, please. I can tell you so much you don't know. Please, Harry!"
"What are you saying?"
With a small
"Who're you?" Harry called out. The man stared at him harder.
The memory clanged around his head like a bullet. It was fuzzy, like looking through frosted glass. "He stayed up almost the whole night, worrying about you I assume. I almost forced a dreamless sleep down his throat. Can you please face me?"
"Alright... Harry. Erm, how old were you when you got your letter?"
Harry fell to the ground, face throbbing. Dudley had just hit him, and not a kid on the playground or a teacher did anything. Harry almost cried, but he didn't want Dudley to laugh at him more. Dudley's friend, Pierce, kicked him in the ribs, and Harry let out a choked gasp.
Hermione wilted away from Madam Pince's voice, but the excited glint in her eyes never went away.
"Wow,
stood. He followed her dot to the Hogwarts grounds, finding
Harry didn't sleep. His large bed was very comfy, yes, but tonight it provided no comfort. The moon shined bright in the window, illuminating the large room. Harry waited.
"Draco Malfoy, Sir." Draco took a step back, worried about the portrait to his room hating him. He'd known him for two minutes and already knew not to put it past him to let Draco spend the night outside because of who he was. Well... that was fine, he supposed. He'd go and sleep in the Slytherin dorms. Without his clothes, or toiletries, and come back to a scolding from Dumbledore.
"I thought you were just having nightmares again, and that's why you were so tired," Draco was whispering now, which Harry thought was a little silly.
Eventually, lunch had appeared in the kitchen, and Harry came down immediately once Draco told him too. Draco was surprised and a little worried at how quickly Harry complied. He watched Harry sit and neatly eat his sandwich.
Dinky was back within minutes. Draco took the small parcel from her and set it on his desk. She popped away, and Draco sat on his own bed. The green sheets and oak wood made him smile, feeling a little bit more at home in the small space.
"Mr. Potter is already experiencing memory issues. Just moments ago, he did not believe that dragons existed, nor did he know what a Golden Snitch was." Dumbledore looked at them both gravely.
"Thank you," Harry said to her.
Harry woke up with a shudder, almost screaming when he saw Draco so close. Draco winced, but tried to ignore it, and held him while circling his ear. Harry relaxed in his arms slowly, his breathing leveling out as Draco smoothed out his hair.
He waited until the moon was high in the sky, and then got out of bed, and left his room.
Madam Pomfrey looked at him for a moment when he didn't say anything. "Are you sure you feel alright, Mr. Potter?"
whizzing by Harry's head and smashing into the wall behind him. He cast a cutting curse at them, hearing her scream as it hit her jugular. Harry realized it was Bellatrix, and didn't mourn the death.
what he would do.
"Madam Pomfrey!" He shouted, bursting in the doors. She bustled out of her office, wand in hand.
"Do you know why you're here?" Voldemort questioned, moving his wand slowly between his hands.
Harry glanced at the brooms laying against the wall. He wasn't that bad at flying, he knew.
"Hm. Well, perhaps you'd also like to explain to me why you were absolutely covered in bruises and burns before I ordered you to take that potion?" She said next, staring at him.
After a moment of regaining his composure, momentarily disrupted by the 'foul mouthed' Slytherin, Professor Slughorn continued his walking around the room, eventually gliding over to his prized students desk. That desk also happened to belong to Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter.
"Now, Mr. Potter, I have some questions. My diagnostics say you're about seven years old right now. Would you like to explain to me why you are so horribly malnourished?" Her stern look made Harry wilt where he was sitting.
His mother had cleaned it up for him, much in the same way Draco was doing now. He hoped Harry woke up soon.
"And what happened when he took the potion two weeks ago?"
"Yes. Though your father came from an ancient Pureblood line, he decided to marry a Mudblood for some reason. Making you a Halfblood," Draco finished, rolling his eyes as though this were stuff Harry should've known coming out of the womb.
Harry's arms trembled as he placed an old necklace on the floor of the wardrobe. He took a step back, and bumped into the makeshift mattress he'd been sleeping on most weekends. Draco was getting increasingly worried about him, and as much as it hurt to know that he was causing Draco pain, Harry couldn't tell him. He couldn't stop.
"Special, My Lord?"
"You don't keep it on hand, do you?"
"We can put a minor tracking spell on him. I'll know where he is, and then once we get him some food, and get him out, I can take it off."
Harry snorted at his own thoughts.
any better than you could before," he paused, stroking his wand like a beloved pet. Red eyes flickered back to Harry, pinning him down. "Would you like to test?"
"Did you already find it?"
They walked down a corridor that seemed to go on forever, taking so many twists and branching off in so many places that Harry knew he was lost within the first two minutes. It finally opened up into a large alcove. Within the alcove sat a throne, tall and made out of what Harry thought was obsidian. It was all rough edges and hard cut, except for the top of the backrest which ended in a curling, looping design.
"I'm not making enemies with Harry Potter, Draco. C'mon, let's get you cleaned up, my mom taught me some healing spells." Blaise grabbed Malfoy's arm and led him into the bathroom. Harry changed into his bed clothes and waited, wand in hand and ears open.
Harry scowled, but did so. He realized how close they were to the Hospital Wing, and quickened his pace. He pushed against the large, swinging double doors with effort. One began to creak open, before it flew open easily and Harry stumbled. He looked back, confused, and glared at a smirking Draco, who had one hand on the door.
Dinky brought them to where the corridor branched off into a large alcove, scarce of paintings except for one. It held an older gentlemen, with a strong posture, hard eyes and an unwelcoming face. Sharp canine teeth poked out of his mouth, his black hair starkly contrasting his pale skin.
. It was unnatural. Harry sat up, rubbing the sleep from his eyes as he stared at the trembling door.
"It tastes like farts," he complained, snuggling tighter into Draco and handing him the bottle. Draco set it on the nightstand, wanting to laugh but feeling like he would vomit if he did.
down his breakfast. Crumbs would've been everywhere if not for magic. But Harry had looked so happy eating while tucked under his arm that he wouldn't have cared anyways.
Draco swallowed the uncomfortable lump in his throat. He fell into a fitful rest in the early hours of the morning, unable to fall asleep until complete exhaustion took him.
Harry didn't sit, he backed up until he hit the counter. "I'm sorry," he whispered.
had been the barnacle.
"I need my Death Eaters in Hogwarts during your next school year. We are ready to attack, and what better place than Hogwarts, hm?"
"Erm, yeah, that's me. And sure, I guess." Harry pulled up his bangs, leaning back as she suddenly leaned closer to them than he expected.
The projection cut off, but not before the audience saw Krum in pieces, the spider picking a large hunk of the ground and eating it with its pincers.
Madam Pomfrey spoke to him then, and Harry wondered at why her voice softer than he had ever heard it. "Mr. Potter, I had Professor Slughorn give me a vial of the potion you drank, and it is malfunctioning. You've been asleep for nearly an hour and a half, which is well over the time the effects were supposed to have lasted. There is no telling how long this will last, but I do believe we must let the potion work itself out of your system."
"He's attacking the moral, Draco."
"Yeah, c'mon. We can finish our essays after dinner if you'd like, but I'm almost done. Figure we can finish tomorrow, yeah?" Harry looked up from where he was putting his text books in his bag.
Draco wasn't sure how long the nurse had been casting, eventually her wand stilled in her hand. She turned to Draco. "The potion is doing what it must. It seems that he is going to be sleeping for a while, I'm going to be keeping a very close eye on him."
Harry let himself smile a little bit as he leaped back through the black flames.
"SHHHHHHH!"
. Draco seemed like a completely different person, Harry didn't know how to handle it. He had been so... sweet and gentle and caring and... so utterly
Draco tugged at his hair harshly, not feeling the pain. Dumbledore always used candy names, didn't he?
Harry Potter? You're in a few of the books I bought, I've read a bit about you. Can I see your scar? Do you actually have it?" A gleam came to her eyes. Harry wondered if that happened every time she learned something new.
Finally,
Light, comforting, fun, happy magic.
The great hall buzzed with joy for the rest of dinnertime. Almost everyone was laughing with happiness, with relief that they themselves wouldn't be harmed. Almost everyone.
He felt like he was going to hyperventilate until the moment he could see slivers of light from the exit. He cast the strongest
Draco sat, relentlessly picking at his nails as he chewed on some chicken. "What's gonna happen when He finds out?"
Professor Slughorn wandered around the classroom, peering into pots of students as he passed, remarking to each of how they could aide their potion into being a little less runny, a little thicker, to make the color duller or brighter.
He didn't know, and that realization shook him to the core. He didn't
A lone tear slipped down his face. He had been so...
"Draco," he started, his name sounding like heaven from Harry's lips. "Would you like to go to Hogsmead with me?"
"Why?"
"Mr. Malfoy, I would like to make it clear that you are not to blame," Dumbledore said quietly. Draco started a bit, not expecting the Headmasters voice. "You did everything in your power, which wasn't much. It is extremely important that you came to us as soon as you did. It will greatly impact Mr. Potter's chance of survival, I'm sure."
"What better place indeed, My Lord."
Grabbing the bag of potions, he downed the ones Madam Pomfrey had given him, leaving the dreamless sleep. After a moment his body relaxed, his mind somewhat soothed. It felt more like he had taken a calming potion than anything else.
"What if he gets his memory back but not his body? Or his body but not his memory? Or if-"
After what felt like hours -but really couldn't have been- Draco saw small slivers of light in the distance. Without realizing, he had moved to a run. He slowed upon approaching, aware of how loud his pounding feet and heavy breathing may be, especially to a magical snake. He cast a quick
"I solemnly swear I am up to no good," he whispered. Seeing the dots and lines and names pop up had to be the most beautiful sight he could've imagined.
on himself, pulling out the map.
"Please, please," Harry choked out, throat hurting. A sharp pain on his head made him wince and cry out again quietly. His chest heaved, his head felt heavy. "Can't...bre-"
"The Ministry sure seems to think so, with all those dementors they have everywhere." Harry stood, wiping the snow off his pants. He gave Snuffles a pet goodbye, cast another heating charm on the dog, and dragged Hermione sadly beside him.
If they were here, Harry and Nagini weren't visible, likely on the other side of the house. But Draco's dot was there. He put the map away. It couldn't do him any good now. A small, wooden ladder led up to a trap door, likely on the base level of the house.
Dumbledore had sent him a short letter the next day, giving his hopes for Harry's recovery and reminding him to keep up their memory questions. Dumbledore had sent the note around noon, but they normally did their questions during breakfast. Draco didn't want to disrupt their routine, even if it was an unnecessary worry.
Harry sat the stone solidly on Quirrell's desk.
Harry gasped awake, blinking around the room with squinted eyes. It only took a moment for him to find Draco. As soon as he did, Harry launched from the bed to Draco's chair, wrapping his tiny arms around Draco's neck hard enough to make him choke.
Madam Pomfrey waved her hand in dismissal, and Draco briskly walked out. Professor Mcgonagall was going to kill him for being late. It wasn't even his fault!
As long as he bought his clothes from the gently used store, they would never be new enough for them to notice, and cheap enough that he usually had something left over for a candy bar or his next purchase.
"Have you learned any spells yet? I've read through all my textbooks, and I've managed to practice a few simple ones, though they aren't much," Hermione asked, pulling her wand out of a pocket in her robes.
"Though, as all three of us just witnessed, once you walked into the room, Mr. Malfoy, Harry remembered not only that dragons exist, but the type of dragon he fought during the Triwizard Tournament," Dumbledore paused, giving them both a moment to digest that information and the implications of it.
Harry stared at him for a moment, hearing the yells of the others growing increasingly distant. They were flying away without him. Harry flew next to the man, Sirius.
As if understanding her, the mutt swallowed the last of it's meal and sat up straight, looking at them happily, but perfectly still.
Severus shook his head harshly. "He is...
Harry sighed, and nodded. "You're right. Thank you, Professor Lupin. I should get going, I want to study a bit before bed," Harry announced, picking up his bag from the floor.
"How close are you to being done?"
Sir Mercy growled. "Of course, you blasted purebloods. Never did any of my kind any good, and I doubt that's changed at all. I'll let you know, you say one blasted word of my blood and you'll never see the light of day again!"
Professor Lupin smiled at him. "Tea?"
"Just w-w-wait a moment, please," he said, grabbing a glove of garlic out of his desk and placing it on a nearby shelf. Harry sighed lightly, stomach grumbling. He hadn't really talked to Professor Quirrell much this year, he made sure to avoid him after he fainted on Halloween.
Harry sat very still, thumbs twiddling softly in his lap. Draco wasn't sure if he'd seen first years hold that still before. "They're my friends," Harry started, sounding a little unsure. "I've never had any friends before, but they're nice to me."
Voldemort hissed. Quirrell walked backwards, bringing the head closer to Harry.
"Professor Severus Snape, he was the potions teacher at Hogwarts for awhile until Professor Slughorn took over this year. But he's still the best at potions."
"This is your fault," Draco muttered disdainfully, sneer firmly set as he mixed their potion seven times clockwise, and then three times counterclockwise, just as they were supposed to. Only, it didn't fix the color of this stupid, pointless, redundant, infuriating, useless, ludicrous, imbecilic, pointle-
He leaned against a bed post, a small smile on his face. Harry was tucked under the covers, laying on his side and holding tightly to a stuffed animal of a large black dog.
"Don't look so sullen, Mr. Potter. Arrangements will be made to deal with the situation. Our students particular habit to gossip has already been dealt with, as I've heard."
Dark figures circled the building, they were- floating? Harry wasn't sure, he had never seen anything like them before. Dark, hooded anthropomorphic figures that seemed to hover just a little too high, and be just a little too tall.
Draco nodded, frowning. "Take care."
"And this is that thing you can't tell me about?" Draco asked. They were almost to the dungeons now, Harry hadn't noticed most of the trip. He shook his head, but stopped when it made him dizzy.
"Dinky," Dumbledore called out. Dinky the house elf popped into the room suddenly. Though Draco's eyelid was twitching steadily, he suppressed a laugh at how high Potter jumped out of his chair at the sight of the House-Elf. "Prepare a suitable room for these two lads in the Northern Tower. As quickly as you can, dear," Dumbledore addressed the happily tearing House-Elf with a smile.
"I'm just clumsy, I told Madam Pomfrey that yesterday."
The floo flared to life, causing Harry to leap off and behind the couch and for Draco to stop speaking. Professor Snape walked out, his robes billowing in a way Draco had tried to replicate for years.
He made it to the great hall faster than he thought he could. He took a moment outside the doors to catch his breath.
"Another Triwizard Tournament is to be held at Durmstrang in a decade or so, did you know?" Dumbledore smiled down at him. Harry nodded slowly. "Do you think they'll use the dragons once more? I thought they were a delightful touch, gave the Forbidden Forest a nice trim too." Dumbledore chuckled merrily, as if the destruction of the forest was a delightful thing.
A trail of blood moved from his nose and smeared across his face, and Draco's shirt. Harry cried, not looking at him. Picking him up -Harry had been letting him do that for two days now- Draco brought him to the bathroom and sat him on the counter. He flinched as he turned the light on, but now Draco could see.
"Thank you Dinky," Harry spoke, "is the portrait of Sir Abraham Mercy?"
Draco smiled softly -which no one else would ever, ever see, god forbid- and ruffled Harry's hair.
Feeling like he could breathe again, Draco ran back to Harry's room. He put his wand to the parchment, pausing.
"Yes, at Madam Malkin's. I remember Malkin herself almost fainting when she found out who you were," Draco said, laughing bit when Harry groaned.
"And your name was?" Harry asked, maintaining eye contact with the boy once again. He seemed pleased by this, and Harry was extremely tempted to look away just because of that.
"I mean... we could try. He'll be able to see through it, and he's a really smart dog, you know that 'Mione. Besides, you'd rather let him go hungry than risk a little detention?"
Draco laughed despite his nerves. "Yeah, probably. I think Professor Snape makes them all taste bad on purpose."
Lupin seemed to sink in his chair. "I need to talk to Dumbledore," Lupin murmured, rubbing his temples once more. Harry felt like he needed to steer Lupin away from this subject before he blew it all.
"Like how Professor McGonagall can turn into a cat?" Harry interrupted. Lupin gave him a
Overall, Harry had become better friends with Draco over the course of the last school year than Harry could have imagined.
"Don't hurt my mom, okay?"
Harry had to do this himself. "He's never said anything like that, sir. He never talks about when he was a Death Eater under the
The screams were deafening. All around, all Harry could see were the smoky outlines of wizards attempting to put out the raging fires. Harry hadn't been responsible for much of this, thankfully. Lucius had made him and Draco stay in the tent for the beginning, but when it came time to set their own quarters (a decoy, Lucius didn't want to burn the real thing) he sent them to burn tents, regardless of the families inside.
Harry looked at him sleepily. His pupils were no longer slits. He frowned at Draco. "Why'd you wake me up?" he asked.
"Uh..."
Harry shook his head, and returned to Fawks who was nipping at his finger. Harry was reminded of Hedwig, and smiled. He needed to visit her.
Dumbledore rubbed his beard, leaning back in his chair. "Then tell him that he is confined for his own health. As little as you can while making sure you get out alive." Dumbledore's voice was grim, Severus' face even more so.
But Draco had cast
He slept like a disgusting, deformed baby atop his bed, which was shabbier than Harry's own. He was partially illuminated by the light gently filtering in through the only window in the room.
"You can't talk about Him like that Harry! You know what He'll do to you!" Draco whispered, sounding so urgent and panicked it made Harry laugh a small bit.
Hermione smacked his arm, interrupting him. "Harry, look!"
"What?"
Draco's eyebrows went into his hairline, a smile across his face. "Well well, Potter's finally got himself into some trouble, has he?" Draco laughed a little bit. "Oh, this is going to be fun. We'll practice tonight in the common room after curfew. Have you ever heard of the spell Depulso?"
, nothing could really hurt him. Draco smiled faintly, remembering how pissed off he had been watching Harry win his first Quidditch match back in first year. Harry never failed to amaze, even as a first year.
"Come along, Potter," Draco said, his voice unusually soft as he led the way to the hospital wing. Harry quickly followed behind, wincing slightly as he tripped every few paces. He thought he heard Draco laughing at him from time to time, but every time he looked up at the man his face was a neutral as it always was.
Harry dived after it.
But Harry
Harry needed to find Draco.
He couldn't see any other doors or windows, couldn't see anything except a broken couch and the deep scratch marks that marred the entire room. Giant ones, as big as Harry's arm. He whimpered quietly, staring at a jagged one near his feet.
Draco looked up. Harry didn't call him that very often. When had he become this nice? "What do you mean?"
"Dinky! Accio rag!" A small rag flew into Draco's hand as Dinky popped into existence next to him. Draco Took Harry's glasses off and set them haphazardly on the table.
"Uhm..." Harry trailed off. He'd gotten better at the Quidditch ones, but again, that could be because Draco always answered his own questions if Harry couldn't. He hoped to spark something, but it never did. "That golden ball-thing in that flying game," he said with confidence.
"And just who do you think you're talking to?" Malfoy asked, glaring at Harry. He was a little taller than Harry, and perhaps he thought that was an advantage, but if it came down to it, this would be almost a field advantage for Harry in fighting.
Harry took a deep breath, and wiped away a few tears. He spoke into Draco's shoulder, muffling his words. "There was a man, and he-his face was weird. And-there was this girl, with really long red hair. There was a lot of green, and she fell..." Harry sobbed a little, "he k-killed her, Dray, he killed her. I don't know how but he di-" Harry cried into his shoulder, and Draco held him closer than he realized he could.
"Mr. Potter, stay please." Harry stopped in his tracks. He had barely finished his third -and final- detention since he had gotten them three weeks ago.
"Teachers pet."
"Lemon drops," Draco spoke, voice cracking. When the statue didn't move, the dread in his stomach grew. "Bertie Botts. Licorice wands. Sugar quills. Blood pops. Sherb-"
Draco didn't look away from Harry as he spoke. Even now, the events felt far away. Unimportant. Draco told them he suspected Nagini bit Harry, and that was the cause for the mutations; instead of necessarily harming or killing him, it had perhaps mixed with the potion and changed him even further.
The thought made him realize he desperately didn't want that to happen. He didn't want to go back to trading glares and insults with Harry. He didn't want to go back to being
He also had no reason to believe Sirius was a Death Eater. He hadn't done anything to show sympathy, but regardless he'd been put in Azkaban, so he was guilty of something.
"Maybe Malfoy will get you it for the holidays. You two are good friends now, aren't you?" Hermione stood next to him, where he stared longingly at the shiny broom in the store window.
"Yeah, he does stuff like that sometimes."
In the corner of the room farthest from the snake, Draco could see the top of Harry's face, dried tears visible on his cheeks. Draco felt his heart lurch in rage and relief, almost running to Harry the moment he saw him.
Draco was woken up by Harry rustling. Harry mumbled something and reached one of his little hands out. Holding shock still, Draco watched Harry as he rolled and slotted himself further into Draco's arms, grabbing Draco's bicep. Feeling possessed, Draco gently ran his fingers through Harry's hair, a sweet smile adorning his face to match Harry's contented one.
"Mr. Malfoy?" Madam Pomfrey looked at him closely, "are you alright?"
The statue slowly rotated, spinning on its axis to reveal a staircase Draco gracefully stepped on before ascending to a heavy wooden door with a large griffin knocker.
He wasn't about to squander it. He held Harry's jaw carefully, leaning forward slowly and watching for any sign Harry changed his mind. Harry met him halfway, grabbing his shirt and pulling him forward.
faster than he had a moment ago.
He ignored the mutations he could see, as much as it pained him. He didn't have the time to worry about it here. Snape or Dumbledore would fix it, but he needed to get Harry back to Hogwarts first, back to safety. He picked Harry up into his arms, carrying him like a toddler with Harry's head on his shoulder. Harry didn't move as Draco placed him, but his breathing was steady. He figured they must have put sleeping charms on him.
Harry swallowed, determined not to let his voice shake. "No, Lord."
As the slender blond took her own potion, the same procedure happened. Her hair shortened, her face rounded out, she wasn't as tall, her shoes were slightly clunky on her feet, and her arm was bent at an awkward angle.
Someone hissed. Harry looked up, finding a man that had blended into the shadows so much Harry hadn't seen him in his panic. He stepped into the moonlight from the window, red eyes glowing like fire.
. Harry perked up to listen.
Draco woke up feeling much better than he had when he went to sleep. He was warm, and Harry's hair was in his nose, their feet tangled together. Draco buried his face into the black hair, feeling like a hole in his chest had been filled.
Harry shook his head sharply. He was sitting on Draco's bed in the sixth year dorms. The moon was high in the sky and a silencing charm kept them from waking up their dorm mates. Harry leaned his head on Draco's shoulder, taking comfort in the arm that was wrapped around his waist.
Harry screamed before he reined it in. Voldemort had done this plenty of times, he could keep himself quiet. He counted to ten before it relented.
Harry pulled out his wand, making a messy upside down 'V'. "Lumos!" He cried out. His wand flickered, a shaky light sputtering before giving out. Harry frowned. "That's...weird." He looked at Dumbledore, who watched him thoughtfully.
Harry knelt on the cold stone floor. Draco was on his left, while Lucius was on his right. Several others formed a broken circle around Voldemort's throne. The gaps were significant. Voldemort looked angry, staring at them, but there was another glint in his eye, one Harry couldn't place.
Draco nodded. "I've sent so many kids to get lines cut into their hands."
"I thought-I was-" he stopped himself. Draco nodded at him to continue. "You weren't... you were gone. And I was-I was hungry, I'm sorry, I won't do it again," he mumbled, almost to the point where Draco couldn't understand him.
It was dark when they arrived. The manor cast huge shadows upon the grown, swallowing the nature within reach. "You'll both be going to your rooms immediately. There are brooms in there. You've been instructed to practice broom-riding relentlessly this summer. The Dark Lord has plans, and this time you'll both be involved. I trust you won't disappoint him," Lucius told them.
"We're going to Snape, and then you're going to bed." Draco commanded. Harry nodded, looking into Draco's eyes.
"I take it you remember the events of the last several weeks?"
They landed in the sitting room. It felt like days since he had last been here, but it couldn't have been more than... two hours? Three? The fireplace was completely empty of wood, and seemed darker than it had ever been, even while unlit. The room had been cleaned by some house elf; the table was no longer overturned, the couch and chair were in place. The mugs and spoons had gone, no visible stain left, the blanket was draped neatly over the back of the couch. His book was gone, in his room or somewhere else.
Harry looked at Snuffles, who was sitting very still. His tongue hung out of the right side of his mouth, it looked like he was smiling.
"Draco, stop whining and finish opening your gifts. You're not even halfway through them."
"Look, Harry, it's Snuffles!" Hermione left his side, running to the shade of a tree where the dog lay. Harry followed at a more gradual pace, staring at the old wooden shack that was a few hundred feet from them.
"Are you hungry?"
"What does Mudblood mean?" Harry asked. Part of him wanted to defend his new friend, but the word stuck him. Draco's eyebrows almost went to his hairline. Harry saw Blaise wince a little out of the corner of his eye.
"Wingardium Leviosa!" The dogs paw gently lifted off of the trap door. Harry guided it off to the side, just enough so he could slip through. He almost bolted out the door when the beast started to growl, but the harp continued and the beast stayed asleep.
Dread filled his stomach.
Dumbledore nodded. "And the mutations?"
"Harry! Something happened to him," Draco said, panting and only then realizing how hard he'd been running. "He needs-I don't know- there was a snake and-"
"Harry, my boy. How are you feeling?" Dumbledore asked, giving Harry a comforting smile.
on Harry -who knew how much he would need that spell- and crept forward, eyes never leaving Nagini.
"Harry? Harry?" Draco called, shaking him. Harry didn't wake up. Heart racing, Draco watched him closely.
"Just answer the question, Potter. Sooner this is over, the better."
Harry dried off, redressing. He was midway through pulling his shirt on when he heard it again.
He made it to the hallway, wondering if he should shut the door and put charms on it to hinder her. He stood for a moment, deliberating, but then Harry shuffled in his arms and Draco realized he had to get out,
He had to check. He started to pull away, Harry's hand fell off of his shirt. Harry shifted, and suddenly big green eyes were blinking up at him.
"Did you do it?" He whispered, looking around himself to make sure no one else was listening. Harry gave him a humorless smile and nodded. Draco sucked in a breath, slumping heavily as he exhaled. "How're you gonna know someone took it?"
Lupin looked at him, a pitying look on his face.
"Professor Snape will be here some time today, I think," Draco said as he set the balm down. Harry's eyebrows scrunched.
"A large, black dog, typically seen as an omen of death. I remember thinking all those years how fitting that was, considering..."
"You can't do anything," Harry said, aghast. Madam Pomfrey shook her head.
His wand wasn't in his pocket. Panic overtook him so much he choked. Harry's screams pierced his ears. "LET ME GO! DRACO! DRAC-"
Draco had no idea what he meant, but he nodded anyways. "What does that mean for Harry, though?" He looked at the potion in his hand. The color did look very similar, if he was remembering correctly.
His scar was an angry red, and bleeding quicker than Draco would’ve anticipated. He patted it with the rag, trying to stop more blood from getting into Harry's eye. It dripped down the side of his face, a few drops managing to stain his robes before Draco could staunch the flow.
An hour later, they were both sound asleep.
Harry let his head hit his wall. Three days. He didn't think Voldemort would want him again so soon. He let out a small grunt of frustration. Would he even be able to go back to school? He didn't want to get mixed up in this. Harry crumpled up the letter and threw it on the other side of the room. He'd deal with it in the morning.
Draco was heaving by the time he made it to the Headmasters gargoyle. He froze in his tracks.
couldn't keep this beast still?
," Voldemort snarled, lashing out a smell that blew up part of the wall, "has been hunting my horcruxes. But there is one he'll never be able to get to..." Voldemort trailed off.
After examining his forehead for a moment, she cast several spells. The air in front of her lit up with different colors and characters, vanishing before Draco could read them
Snuffles laid in the sun, his snout raising towards the sky. Harry opened his mouth, but closed it again. He could be wrong. It could just be a dog that was... really smart... and understood what he said... fuck.
"It's hard to get away when you're living in his home by force. Listen, who
Dumbledore asked a few questions, some of which Draco struggled to answer. Eventually they circled to Harry's...changes. Which brought up the worrying question of Harry turning back to normal. "I would have to make changes to my current potion to accommodate for the snake venom. It could take weeks, maybe months of experimenting," Snape said quietly.
"Honestly," Draco murmured, "you look like a fawn, trying to stay upright and stumbling around, looking at the world through those stupid big eyes." Shaking his head, Draco murmured to himself. Harry thought Draco had consumed to many potion fumes.
"That is the best location charm I am aware of. It should track Mr. Potter, but depending on the wards around where he is, it may only come up with a very broad area," Dumbledore paused, waiting for Draco to speak. Draco only nodded curtly. "It is better than nothing, Mr. Malfoy. We will find him."
After a moment, he saw her nod out of the corner of his eye. He let go of the breath he had been holding. "Thank you." He didn't think he would have left even if she argued, but his nerves were so shot he was glad he didn't have to fight.
He closed the door behind him, veering into the dungeons where he went to the kitchens.
Harry walked a little closer, surprised when the dog didn't run away. He got on his knees next to him, his legs instantly chilling in the snow. Harry brought out his wand and cast a warming charm on himself. He looked up at the dog, who had started to whine just a little.
Harry smiled maniacally.
He walked to his table, sitting down across from Draco.
"That's all... for me?" Harry asked slowly. Draco nodded, and pushed the plate closer. Harry grabbed a fork so slow Draco thought Harry was trying to tease him or something, with the way Harry's eyes kept darting back and forth between Draco, the plate, and the fork.
"What is Hogwarts?"
"Shut it!" The man yelled in his ear. Harry flinched away, gasping. "I told you I wasn't going to be the one that grabbed him," the man snapped to someone on the left. Harry looked over, maybe if he pleaded, maybe if he begged-
"Should we give him a name, do you think?" The large dog had his head resting in Harry's lap, ears perked in interest.
Harry gave him a sideways glance as he took a bite of a sandwich. "'Mione and I are going back to the 'ibrary after 'unch," Harry said through a mouthful of food, "If it's gone, it's gone, and I don't have to worry about it anymore. Not my problem."
"You gave me too many Eyes of Bat. The instructions clearly read half a dozen, and you shoved an entire handful of the tiny things into my palm!"
A small poof was heard, accompanied by a small cloud of green smoke that enveloped Harry. The cloud dispersed quickly. Standing in Harry's place...a boy.
I'm going to be in Slytherin. All the best wizards go there, and my entire family has been in that house for centuries," the boy said pompously, sharp nose high.
took it away.
Voldemort nearly cackle with glee when they returned, and Harry was sent to his bed with a very full stomach. They had done good, Voldemort had said.
, though it shook and rained dust as he went down. Draco hurried his movements, able to see the trap door. He was
Harry raised his eyebrow before he could stop himself. Her smile turned sour. "Okay, Professor. What would you like me to do?"
Harry smiled, and shook his hand.
Draco crouched a little lower and tilted Harry's head up with his hand. His nose didn't
The two walked out of the classroom. No one but Hermione noticed how Harry hurriedly rolled his sleeves down and pulled his collar up. He shot a look to his friends before he left, and gave Hermione a wide-eyed look when he saw her starring. He left quickly, following Draco's path.
Draco was motionless at this point. Then he launched himself at Harry, and though Harry was having some trouble breathing, he wouldn't tell Draco that. They didn't hug very often, and it was... really nice.
Harry looked up from his eyes, surprised. "A school," he said after a moment. That was his usual response, Draco had probably said it enough for him to remember it.
Draco sat down on the couch to read, spending over an hour simply relaxing. He had almost forgotten about the Flying Fiend until Harry suddenly raced to his side, bouncing on the couch and elbowing Draco in the ribs in his haste. Harry snuggled into his side and fell asleep, likely exhausted from his flying. Draco smiled at him tenderly, one hand stroking his hair and the other flicking a few spells so that the book would float and turn its own pages.
He laid down, trying to fall asleep now that he was warmer. He drifted off, letting the sound of rain pounding the walls lulling him to sleep. But then, a new voice joined the symphony of a rainstorm, a
Harry sighed, letting his head fall back and his eyes close. He was so
He read the scroll, repeating it aloud.
"Hagrid brought it to me."
The stairs stayed quiet under his
Harry looked back at Draco, flexing his toes. He needed to think for a bit, and was glad Draco was asleep. He wrapped his arms around himself as he thought. Harry had... adored Draco, had wanted to be around him constantly. Now he felt...
"Did you think there weren't already, my boy?"
"Are you hurt? What happened? Are you okay? Harry?" Soft sobs were muffled by his chest, and Draco could feel his shirt getting wet. Heart yearning but panic constricting him, he pulled Harry away so he could look at him.
"What if we do, though? This is our first trip to Hogsmead, and I'd rather have something to look forward to than staring sadly at the Firebolt display every time we come," Harry said, twisting around to look at said display, "and what's the harm, anyways?
"Has Lucius ever mentioned something about Pettigrew being alive?"
His brows furrowed in confusion. He looked at the couch, seeing it empty and the blanket tangled around his legs.
Harry froze.
Harry sniffed, wiping his nose on his sleeve. Draco almost wrinkled his nose in disgust, but controlled it so Harry wouldn't see. Finally Harry was sitting, and took the potion Draco offered him. His worry lessened, Draco picked up the bowl Harry had been holding.
"Hungry?" Draco pointed to the still hot -he loved house elf magic- breakfast on the counter. Harry slowly approached it, taking the seat opposite him but not making himself a plate.
Harry didn't say anything, but he didn't move away from Draco either so he supposed this was okay.
The horn sounded. Cedric rushed into the maze, followed by Krum a second later. Harry couldn't see the majority of what was happening, the fog covered nearly everything. Vague shapes that could have been anything moved in the hazy light, some so ominously tall Harry shivered. Those were the dementors, he was sure of it.
"Mr. Malfoy, if you could stop wearing a hole in the rug, that would be appreciated. Why don't you put yourself to use and tell me what happened here?" Madam Pomfrey spoke sharply, otherwise ignoring his presence.
"He only went unconscious that time, no pain or anything like that. Then this... weird shimmer covered his body and it then sunk in and went away. He woke up fine," Draco cleared his throat, feeling like he was going to start croaking.
Harry flew with a pit in his stomach, that seemed to grow heavier with each mile.
A small rustling of sheets met his ears before a puffy-faced, red-eyed Daphne walked out, head hung low and cradling her arm.
Barty Crouch had, of course, scoffed at the comment of war and told Dumbledore to leave. Voldemort had been cackling for days. That made the house a little easier to live in until school started.
Fleur dropped out of the contest, and left the same day. Now, it was just Krum and Cedric.
"Why did you hesitate on that last name?"
Dumbledore smiled at a weary Draco. "How are you today, Mr. Malfoy?"
Harry was in front of Pettigrew's room. His door wasn't even locked. The man was pathetic at using magic as he was at using common sense.
Harry ran out of the classroom.
"Boys, I trust you've been practicing as you've been instructed. This will be your first mission for me, I do hope it is not your last. Distribute the brooms, share your own if you have to. I am under the belief that some of my followers have died during their imprisonment, but that may not be the case.
"I know, but this is a different one. Please Har?"
"Indeed, I imagine that would be frightening for someone as young as you were." Dumbledore chuckled.
"No no no no no no no," Draco muttered, lurching to his feet and falling, hitting the ground hard. Sobs shook his body, making him tremble as he used the couch to help him stand. Tears clouded his vision as he stumbled for the exit to his -
Draco shook his head roughly. So what? Potter was a little kid, he liked kids.
Cold sweat ran down his back. His breathing was shallow, like he had flown around the kitchen and rooms for hours. Smile dropping, the man pointing the wand at him. "I don't know anything!" Harry cried out, holding his arms in front of his face for protection.
"Are you ready to go back now?"
Thank you guys SO MUCH for reading!!!! This has been an absolute blast!!! If any of you have read the original, I hope I lived up to my promise of improvement! Tell me your thoughts and have a wonderful day!
"Yes, Mr. Malfoy. And when you are not there, other arrangements will be made to ensure Mr. Potter's safety."
He was young. Draco thought he looked about four. The Hogwarts uniform pooled around him. His shirt barely clinging on a shoulder, while the other sleeve exposed a thin, pale elbow. His shirt was hanging down to his ankles and the pants he had been wearing had dropped to the floor. His hair was long, wrapping around his ears and neck with a curliness that surprised the classroom. Large green eyes stood out behind glasses that were slipping off his nose, before a tiny hand angrily pushed them back up his face.
Draco moved into the living room, finding Dumbledore looking at Harry's toy broom that was propped in the corner. "I'm sorry Headmaster, I didn't realize you were waiting."
Draco stretched from his spot on the couch. A quick spell told him the time; a few minutes to eleven. Groaning, Draco pushed his schoolwork away. The elves would take what he'd completed and leave the rest. He was putting his quill and ink away when he heard a thump from the other room.
"You may leave now, Mr. Potter. I trust this to stay between us, less your education comes in danger." Harry was seething. He didn't look at her as he left, though he noted she did sound disappointed.
"It's so dark in here," Harry said, frowning as he looked at the book shelves. He could hardly make out the titles on the spines.
Harry scooped Sirius into a hug and cried into his fur. He felt Hermione lay a hand on his shoulder and squeeze, and that felt reassuring too.
Another man Harry couldn't see made a dismissive noise. The woman didn't seem to care.
"Potter, Harry!"
"Lucius Malfoy called Pettigrew the Secret Keeper? That can't be right, Lily and James made Sirius the secret... unless they had changed it without any of us knowing, and when Sirius blew up the street he could've-what if he lived, maybe turned into a rat and-" Lupin stopped himself.
The snake launched at him as he grabbed the handle. Draco slammed the door shut, catching it's snout. It's hissing seemed to be the loudest thing Draco had ever heard as he cast locking charm after sticking charm on the door to keep it shut. He ran down the hall, unable to hear anything besides his own breathing and Nagini beating against the trapdoor.
"Can you at least change so I can talk to you? Get some answers?"
Draco wrapped him tighter in the blankets and went into his own room. "Dinky!"
"My original potion that would've had some effect on Potter before should be done sometime today. I will send that one to you once it is. Have Potter take it, and tell me what happens. I'll start on a new one immediately," Snape said quickly. Draco nodded, still rubbing Harry's back.
"You have had a very emotional and possibly traumatizing experience, Mr. Malfoy. Those will help your mind and muscles recover from what you have gone through. And use some of that cream I gave you to heal the cut on your cheek, as well," she said briskly, though she had a small smile on her face. Draco nodded, looking towards Dumbledore.
