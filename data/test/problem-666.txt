He coughed. "Seeing as this is the second time it happened, I believe I'm finally due for an explanation?"
“You’re a werewolf, aren’t you?” Harry asked him one night after the full moon when Remus had lain in bed, still too weak to continue their lesson on subtraction.
"Sulking," Remus replied, chuckling. "A grown man whining about why it had to be Severus and not him under the Great Lake. I keep telling him he's a wanted fugitive in hiding for the past decade, but I suppose I'll have to try harder."
Draco's mouth formed an 'o'. A few seconds passed, and he quickly shut his mouth, because it was unbecoming of a Malfoy to be seen with such an expression. However, when he composed himself, he was looking at Potter in a new light. "Very impressive. I don't know if I can call that very brave or very suicidal."
to be and Ron was pretty much announcing to the world that he was incapable of discretion. Draco really had gotten so thin since the school year started. Well, the boy was already thin enough to begin with, and Harry didn't really expect anything less because of the war and Lucius being sent to Azkaban for life and Narcissa and Draco being held on probation.
The Dursleys never let him use Dudley’s pencils. He was allowed to touch them only if he was going to put them away after Dudley made a mess of them but he was never to use them. He’d seen Dudley write with it or even draw, but Dudley’s drawings were never pretty. Mostly, they were drawings of Harry getting hurt by a badly drawn fire or a knife or a rabid dog.
Harry was still reeling from the pain. Behind him, he could hear someone moving, footsteps on the ground, something stirring, and stone clanking against stone. Cedric's body was twenty feet away. He was dead. Harry couldn't believe it.
isn’t allowed to talk big.” He shoves the tart towards Draco’s mouth, fully expecting him to turn away. To his surprise, Draco takes the fork, cleans it free of tart, and gives it back to Harry.
Remus was thoughtful like that. Sirius, on the other hand, only kept up his banter with Snape as an old habit, but Harry really wasn't sure what Severus thought about them. It was a touchy subject, and Harry knew that Severus only refrained from speaking about it because he knew about how much Harry loved them.
He turned around abruptly, intent on rounding on the next corner instead, and ended up colliding with a passer-by.
The Head Auror in Harry had agreed then, but right now, lounging on his couch in his flat during his day off, the Head Auror in him was nowhere to be found and all that was present was moping and restless Harry who had been distracted during that meeting with the shock of Draco having another partner other than him after two years. It didn't even matter that the arrangement was just for that single mission or that the 'other partner' was his best mate, because
She turned back to Draco. "When Mr. Potter bit you, it was his first taste of human blood. Vampires usually only start to crave human blood when they reach the peak of puberty at the age of 18, but even then, it can be repressed. The thirst only becomes uncontrollable once they taste it and their body starts to seek it."
The sound of wings flapping snapped him out of his stupor and he realized belatedly that Errol had just left his flat after markedly decreasing the contents of his container of owl treats.
“Malfoy, we don’t…” He paused, frowning. He waited for Malfoy to look at him, before starting again. “We don’t know exactly if it’ll work. And we don’t know what’ll happen if you…”
Malfoy was close, looking at him with his eyebrows furrowed in concern. His blue eyes searched Harry’s face, and Harry couldn’t look away, couldn’t stop the words from slipping past his lips, “Malfoy, I don’t know if this will work. I… Again, you don’t have to—”
So it was on the afternoon of the 17th that Harry Potter, covered with a Glamour charm, and his cat travelled to Diagon Alley in search for the perfect gift for Draco Malfoy.
His imagination had actually played with the possibility of everyone screaming and running away from him, because that’s what the normal people in Muggle stories did, didn’t they?
He hoped that Draco didn't find this too weird, Harry actually trying to start a decent conversation that wasn't out of necessity or obligation to schoolwork.
How much of their memories were returned?). They know she’s purposefully keeping it from them, because they’re all going through something, and the last thing she wants to do is to add to that.
“Don’t scratch,” he warned, but it was either the cat didn’t take very well to being carried or being warned because the cat leapt from his arms, nearly knocking over the table that held the books for the window display. The table, thankfully, kept upright, but one of the books, however, fell from its stand.
Draco looked at him incredulously, as if unbelieving that anyone could be so clueless. "To get you in my debt,
Harry jumped as he realized for the first time that there were two more boys standing by the door. They were both big and burly, as if they could break Harry in half like a stick if he got on their bad side. But right now, they shuffled inside the compartment and took their seat across from him and Draco, nodding at him in greeting.
Deep inside, Harry knew that everything would be okay once they returned to dry land. But seeing Severus like that… Harry felt another chill rack his body.
He really was too emotional. Wore his heart on his sleeve. In that sense, on a good day, Draco could admit that Ronald Weasley really was the better choice for Head Auror.
Harry does as told. “No, I came for the pancakes.” He transfers two pancakes on his plate (After three weeks of eating in the Manor, he’s managed to divest himself of his bashfulness with the food.), scoops as much slices of banana as he can with his fork, and sprinkles that on top along with the crushed cashews. He unstops the bottle of maple syrup.
it sucks how much he’d missed that smile. His head still hurts, but he finds himself smiling back anyway.
And it seemed that Potter had pretty much thrown all caution into the wind and made himself comfortable, sleeping peacefully beside him.
It has been three months since they last saw her, and it’s like something’s missing when she’s not here. They both want to see her, but Harry knows that Ron wants that in a way that’s different.
the whole of Beauxbatons already knew that Pansy had a crush on Draco Malfoy. The Durmstrang students seemed either rather thick in the head or rather too obsessed with their Viktor Krum to care about other things. Hell, Harry was sure that
The heaviness of his eyes won over then and he let himself relax, thoughts of introducing his cat to Draco tomorrow drifting him off to sleep.
Draco sat on the edge of the bed, his back straight and stiff. Once in a while he'd shift, always with a wince.
His blood turned cold. Suddenly, it was like he was 11 years old again and this was the Forbidden Forest with all its dark trees and vines, and on the ground, dirty with roots and soil, was a young boy with white blond hair and bright, red blood shining in the moonlight–
Dumbledore was watching all this with an amused smile. “Then it’s rather convenient that his guardian is a teacher, is it not?”
Harry almost stopped, but he noticed that these silhouettes weren't moving like the other ones he had seen. They were just… floating. Four dark figures in the distance, floating in equal distances from each other.
Remus thought he was doing a fine job teaching the boy things about the Wizarding World. He had told him about Hogwarts and the wonder of the place and how Harry was going to study there when he turned eleven, just like his mom and dad, just like Sirius and Remus, just like Severus.
It looks hideous, and he has to close his eyes and look away from the scene, from the image of Draco Malfoy falling into pieces.
By the time that Draco left for the evening after bidding him a sweet farewell (“Remember to bring that red wine! Don’t tell anyone! I don’t want their grabby hands on my wine.”), Harry felt like a fifteen-year-old lovesick teenager again.
Draco spoke before Potter could do something stupid like apologize. “Don’t give me that look, Potter,” he sighed. He rubbed at his temple, trying to get his mood back into something more neutral. “We were young and stupid.”
He closes his eyes, has to look away for a while. When he opens them, Narcissa is watching him carefully, and Harry speaks, just as careful, “May I stay until then?”
Draco turned back to his leaves. "What about you, Potter? Thinking of using the fame you've gotten from the Tournament to sweep a damsel off her feet?"
"But do not fear," Dumbledore continued. "I was told that you've healed quite well. Poppy has a salve so that wound on your neck won't scar." His eyes twinkled. "But I hear scars are quite popular with the ladies."
He was annoyed. Very annoyed. With Potter. But it was weird kind of annoyance. He wasn't annoyed about the blood. He had thought about it long and hard the past three days, and he realized that he didn't really mind what happened in Potter's room. He realized that he was annoyed that Potter was avoiding him. Again.
He had dreamed of buying the kid’s first broomstick and of James and Lily admonishing him for spoiling their son rotten.
Harry opened his mouth to say hi then remembered right, shite, he couldn't. He settled for looking at the bottle suspiciously instead.
Potter, at first, looked surprised at Draco's reaction, but then slowly allowed himself to grin back. "I was thinking if it would help if I testified what I saw there, but…"
“He’s –“ Petunia started but her voice cracked. Snape’s eyes snapped up to meet hers or, at least, the one that was peering through the now even narrower opening of the door. It hadn’t been bloodshot when he last saw it. Petunia swallowed audibly and tried again. “He’s all yours,” she whispered.
, Potter. It just so happens that they’re the ones of nearest vicinity at this moment, unless you’d rather that I complain about what a horrid mess you look like right now with your swollen eyes and your red nose.” He looked at Harry pointedly.
Later, when Snape was back in his Manor and on his way to checking on the boy, he’d realize how he had been played.
Draco floats then, from one state of consciousness to another. One minute he’s there, staring at the wooden floor of the bridge, knowing that he’s doing it, his body’s doing it, his own eyes are doing it, and the next he’s in some haze, like
He saw Viktor Krum swim to the farthest one on the left. Harry willed his webbed feet and hands to bring him nearer as fast as they could. He recognized the silhouettes one by one.
Draco returned to the Hospital Wing now, and as he expected, the Hospital Wing remained empty. Even Madame Pomfrey was nowhere to be found.
With a sniff and haughtily raised eyebrow, Draco walked over to him and gracefully sat himself down on the chair beside him.
Before leaving the flat, he opened a can of tuna and left it on the kitchen floor, telling the cat, “I’ll be out a bit to look for Draco’s Christmas gift. Help yourself.”
That’s what friends do. They borrow each other’s things and they don’t return it, and they’re not supposed to be… friends. Or whatever this is. Whatever Potter wants this to be.
Draco laughed shortly. “Oh, I will,” he promised, as he raised the Snitch, specifically the part where the text was inscribed, to his lips. He watched, amazed, as the text dissolved, only for another sentence to take its place.
Harry flushed hotly, suddenly feeling insecure. He’d spent last night after Ron and the cat left wallowing in his misery like a kicked puppy before he decided to fix his things for the party and saw the Christmas gifts that he had prepared for Draco a few days ago. And just like that, kicked puppy became reckless dog as his inner Gryffindor gave him daring ideas (in the name of throwing all caution into the wind to get what you want) that his inner Slytherin ineffectively warned him not to follow (in the name of self-preservation to survive another day).
The two of them are both quieter now, more introspective. It’s more obvious in Ron, who’s usually the first to blow up or give in to his more explosive emotions. They’ve fought over so many things during the war, that any of their remaining differences now just aren’t important enough to fight over anymore.
And Draco, now at ease, nodded and returned to his book. Harry stayed where he was, content with the sound of Draco's soft breathing beside him, the quiet turning of pages, and the morning sun shining on the two of them.
A sharp intake of breath. And then an accusatory “…You don’t say that and expect me to wait a moment.”
Voldemort stopped him with a raise of his hand. "Oh, consider me appeased. Very much appeased. It is my first day in this new body, and I have not had a drink in such a long time."
Harry stopped his journey towards his bed and shifted his gaze towards where he knew Theodore's was. He squinted his eyes to see the other boy better through the dark.
It took Potter two more days to emerge from his room behind the tapestry, and Draco guessed it was only because it was the day they were supposed to go to wherever this Unplottable place of Severus was.
The cavern exploded into shards of rock and screams of the dead. Harry wasn’t prepared for the explosion—too big, too wide, too strong that it blew him bodily away, hauling him from the middle of the floor to crash into what felt like a stone pillar.
To his surprise, she doesn’t look annoyed at Draco’s rudeness like he had expected her to be. In fact, she looks worried, and he is relieved and grateful all at the same time.
The Dark Lord is in hiding. Trying to recuperate and gather back his followers. Cornelius Fudge still turned a blind, denying eye. Lucius and Narcissa were both fine, and Dumbledore had an unhealthy, disgusting obsession with lemon tarts.
“Don’t you have enough pancakes with those weasels? I’m sure the Weaslette would love to fall all over your feet and hand feed you.”
"I didn't ask for the gillyweed either, you git," Potter muttered, but said, "Only if you teach me the Wronski Feint."
As the arena came into view, he was embarrassed to see that they had erected a wide projection in the air of him and the dragon so that the audience could see the events of the tournament unfold, even if they occurred outside the arena. Harry tried to keep the flush on his face down. Maybe he could pass it off as windburn and not as currently dying from embarrassment please kill me now.
Twenty feet in the air, Draco let out a very frustrated growl. He let the cold wind whip at his hair, before running his hands through it and gripping it with a sigh.
he needed to talk to Kingsley. The Ministry definitely needed to give more budget to St. Mungo’s, preferably for some lavender fabric soap.
"You're really admirable, Harry," Ginny said with a smile. "Now if you'd just direct that charm to certain blond wizards…"
What greeted him was the sight of Harry Potter in the living room with a blanket around his shoulders and his own mug of chocolate in hand.
Severus was silent for a moment. He regarded Draco with those hard eyes of his, as if mulling over what he was about to say first. "Harry will be staying with us. But worry not, Draco. I assure you you won't see him for the remainder of your summer vacation, if you wish it."
Harry looks at that small frame—those sharp elbows digging into his knees and his thin wrists hiding little of the stream of tears on his face crumpled in despair and agony. The line of his back hunched over on the wheelchair, with his shoulder blades jutting so sharply out, Harry’s almost scared that it’ll tear his skin.
And then, like a lit candle, all conversation returned at once, the hall bursting with excited chatter as they wondered which of the first years was the famous Harry Potter.
And then, with dread sneaking its long tendrils around his throat, Harry figured it out. He should have guessed it, expected it—
Lavender Brown, who was sitting on the love seat beside the food table with Terry Boot, glanced over curiously.
He had been away for a week—too long, and while he is used to long missions, he isn’t used to leaving Draco alone on Christmas Eve. It is their fifth Christmas, but it’s the first one that he’s had to be away.
“Your face makes me regurgitate,” Ron muttered as he wiped his mouth with a table napkin. He cringed. “This is about Malfoy, isn’t it?”
Harry had long since changed his wards to allow Draco in at all times, ever since he fell victim to a flu that he denied was a flu and that therefore evolved into a fever. He had spent one whole day asleep like a log in bed when he should have been slaving over papers in his office, a fact that was drilled into his head that evening when a very furious Draco Malfoy very bodily shook his shoulders and woke him up.
Draco snapped out of his stupor, at the same time Potter swerved in front of him and smacked a bludger away with his arm guard.
Or maybe it was because Harry was sitting too close and smelling too much of soap and Quidditch and grass and mornings, and it makes Draco think unclearly.
They reached Potter’s office, which was really just a small room with a desk and two chairs in front of the window, a long bench pushed to one side, and a tall, potted plant in the corner of the other side. All possible surfaces were littered with piles and piles of parchment, except for the bench which had a pillow and haphazardly folded blanket.
But those are the moments that Harry looks forward to the most, humbled by the trust he’s being given.
Right now, Draco’s arms are around him, his mouth is full of Draco’s taste, and his nose is filled with Draco’s fresh scent.
“I’m up,” Harry says, voice cracking. He swallows the dryness down his throat, and then tries again. “I’m up.”
Draco looks up from his textbook, and tilts his head at the sudden topic. He is lying down on his bed, his chest on the mattress, in only his regular uniform after having thrown his robes over the chair. His hair is tousled from rolling over on the bed so much, and Harry’s been trying not to look (or
Which was just another way of saying that Draco wasn't supposed to know about the important stuff. Or any other stuff. Which was fine. Draco didn't want to know. All this talk about the Dark Lord going after him or his parents or his godfather,
Severus had cursed loudly, yelled at him to levitate Potter to the bed, Disapparated, and Apparated with Madame Pomfrey in a few, excruciating heartbeats. Madame Pomfrey had shooed him outside after that. He had retreated to his room and hadn't come out since, even when Kreacher called him for dinner.
This time, it didn’t take long. The snake moved immediately, slowly at first, as if coming from a nap, and then gradually quickening until finally it stopped, its head peeking out from one of the skull’s eye socket, its tongue slipping out as it hissed,
Potter was the first to be Apparated by Severus with Side-Along Apparition. Severus came back for him five minutes later.
Harry Potter woke up from his dream with a start and a throbbing headache. He never could remember that part properly. It was still no less haunting though and he took a moment to clear all the blinding, red colour from behind his eyelids.
The dragon fell to the Lake in a roar and Harry couldn't escape from the rain that her splash made. He ran a hand through his hair, pushing his wet bangs away from his face. He knew the dragon would be back though – and back she came, blowing angry streams of fire from her nostrils as she emerged from the dark waters of the Lake, dripping with water that quickly turned into steam.
Amazingly, Hermione looked apologetic. "I'm sorry, Harry. I've tried. But surely, if a counter-spell exists, then someone must have already found it. If no one's found it yet, then I don't see how
Harry stopped, looking at him in question. With him standing and Draco sitting down, the latter actually looked… small like that, eyebrows knitted in confusion and insecurity marring his features.
that Draco had to give his blood, yes, but after having gone through it twice, Draco realized that most of his worries about it had just been from preconceived notions about vampirism, mostly gotten from his mother. Madame Pomfrey was right: It didn't hurt.
Malfoy cleared his throat nervously behind him. “I suppose I’m to take care of them simultaneously then?”
One of the hooded figures broke free of the circle that they had formed around Voldemort. He threw himself on the ground, on Voldemort's feet, sobbing, worshipping, "Forgive us, master!"
He didn't know if Malfoy understood what he said, so he was surprised when an amused smile stole over the other boy's features.
“You don’t belong here,” Draco replies, rolling his eyes. “You’re too nice. We have a reputation to uphold.”
didn't sound right. Malfoy definitely wasn't someone who was running to be a saint. He cut off Draco's tirade. "Why did you help me, anyway?"
Severus was updating Draco on what had transpired while he was asleep while Lucius and Dumbledore talked quietly a few feet away from them, when Narcissa burst into the room in a flurry of blond hair and white robes.
He shifted his position on the bed to face the ceiling. He didn’t know if his insomnia was a blessing or a curse, but it gave him extra time to pore over books and ancient texts—anything he could find about horcruxes.
Harry flushed. He knew that Draco wasn't asking whether he would go to Ginny and beg for mercy. (Not that it'd work, anyway.) He shook his head.
They made their way towards the Slytherin Common Room, with Harry itching to get out of his uniform and figure out what the hell was supposed to do with the golden egg in the pocket of his robes. But peace and quiet, Harry thought with a mental whimper as he got sight of the Common Room, was too much to ask for.
At that, Harry’s tense shoulders relaxed. “Well, you were laughing at me, so I thought…” he grumbled back, cheeks still red as well. He peered up at Draco through his fringe. “No one’s ever worried about you?” he asked awkwardly.
He sighed loudly into the silence of his flat. The couch underneath him shook as the cat jumped off it in surprise at the sudden noise.
“Nonsense, Draco!” Pansy, who was sitting across from them, scoffed. She grinned at Harry. “Harry’s a Slytherin through and through. He might even suck all our blood by tomorrow.” She winked and Blaise beside her snickered.
into the fireplace. He had no doubt that the argument would continue even after they have arrived at their destination.
The castle halls are quiet when they pass through them. Gone are the students, and the only noise that echo are their footsteps and heavy breathing. Draco spends the trip trying to focus on keeping himself awake so much that it takes a while for him to notice that they’re already in front of a very familiar stone wall.
There were so many things about this mission that they weren’t sure of, so to have both Hermione and Malfoy thinking on the same team…
It’s been three months since the end of the war, since whatever happened between Ron and Hermione happened, but it’s the first time Harry has asked, mainly because it didn’t seem the right time then to talk about such things when Fred’s dead and Remus’ dead and they had to arrange all those funerals.
"Don't look like that, Potter," huffed Draco. "I was only asking," he muttered, turning back to his book.
He had planned on showering him with all kinds of toys, taking him for daredevil broomstick rides around London behind his parents’ backs, and teaching him how to be a mean Chaser. He had dreamed of the child as a toddler, chubby and goofy smiles, to squeal in joy whenever Sirius would transform into a dog and back.
Potter stood up and rolled his eyes, but the smile remained on his face. "Apology accepted, Malfoy. Now get up and let's eat dinner. Kreacher's sick with worry about his beloved
When he finally mustered the courage, he looked up at Draco and he had already stepped one step forward to make sure if the other was okay – but Draco was looking at him with wide eyes and a set jaw and he looked… torn?
Draco grit his teeth. It wasn't Potter he was angry at. Right now, it was Severus. He needed to talk to Severus.
Even if it was an utter lack of decorum and social grace, it was what Draco preferred. Then again, it wasn't very hard pleasing him nowadays, especially since the one doing so was Harry and that sort of set the whole standard.
to him, and Draco was very good company that Harry actually wanted to keep, and if Harry had to suffer a few more days without the ability of speech because Ginny was being a twat, then so be it. One cannot have everything.
The students hurriedly made a wider circle around the Goblet, until finally – another piece of paper floated into the air.
The knife was raised and the hooded figure raised a hand along with it. Harry watched in horror at the sight of the hand with its pinky missing, and knew what the figure was about to do. He closed his eyes as a piercing scream sliced through the air, and Harry knew that there was no hand left there now.
this. This apparently newfound friendship that he had with Malfoy. Even if, he thought with grim amusement, that friendship was founded on shared trauma.
Harry remembers Draco and what he was like when he first came out of Azkaban. He had only spent three months there. Three months too long. He doesn’t know what will happen to Gregory Goyle and Theodore Nott after those 6 months. “I don’t think so.”
He swallows thickly, and looks up to comment that they’re a bit tight, but Draco is staring at him, stunned and speechless.
–" He stopped when Harry removed something from his bag and moved to throw it over Draco's head. On impulse, Draco ducked his head and yelped. "
"You look like shite, Potter," he commented airily, placing the book on the table in front of him, opened somewhere in the middle so that it didn't look like he'd been stuck on page one for the past half hour. He turned to Harry and made a show of raking his eyes disapprovingly down Harry's form. "Not that it surprises me anymore, really, because you've always looked like –"
However, an hour into Diagon Alley, he found that the outside world wasn’t quite bad. In fact, it was
But it’s during one night that he opens a letter with a hidden Stinging Hex, and the pain from the welt on his wrist makes him wonder,
“The wizarding world wants me dead, Potter. And I’m trying to fight and claw my way up for the right to live until I can’t fucking walk anymore. And you—Harry fucking
didn'twant to write it at all. He had spent the last hour being generally quiet (which was easy, really) and even attempting to retreat to the sanctity of the Boys' Dorms, but his friends were having none of that.
"So," he started conversationally, slowly cutting his roast beef. He looked at Severus at the other side of the table, five chairs away. They were the only ones present. "Where's Potter?"
And just like that, it was like a switch was flipped. "Ah, yes, you're welcome with that mermaid part, by the way. Tell me
As they emerged from the entryway, Draco saw the room that they had just entered. It was square and spacious, but sparsely decorated. The walls were white, so were the messy covers on the bed in the middle of the room. There was a small bedside table where a tray of food was left untouched.
Theodore coughed. When he spoke, his voice was shaky. "Huh, well. Guess I shouldn't be going around opening up golden dragon eggs, huh."
"I'd say that counts as saving my life," Potter said amicably. "So maybe you can get out of your room now and stop moping?"
He had no idea what Dumbledore was thinking sending him to get Potter five years before the boy was sent for Hogwarts. There were just so many things wrong with that thought.
He opened his trunk and got out his Nimbus 2001, a gift that Sirius had given him for his birthday that year.
Suddenly, Harry found himself clearing his throat and spilling out his thoughts. “That was where we camped. Hiding from Death Eaters. We took turns holding the locket, but the enchantments were too strong. If you kept it on for too long, it started to do things to you. And it—” He clamped his mouth shut. He swallowed thickly, blinking, suddenly ashamed at being so open like this.
speak, consists of three-word utterances at best! I’m lucky that the child even knows how to count to
Potter rolls his eyes. There’s a smile on his lips and a twinkle in his eyes, like a promise of something fun. “No, Malfoy.”
Sirius laughed so much that tears sprang to his eyes and he hugged Harry in pretty much the same way he did during the first time they met in Snape Manor.
Now, Draco was almost a quarter done with his homework, and he worried what he was going to have to occupy himself with once he had finished it all.
Draco kept quiet. He didn't know what to say. That's nice? Well and good? He took a deep, shuddery breath to calm his thundering heart. "I don't suppose I have a choice?"
Draco was used to this. He had been shipped like cargo from one set of relatives to the next all throughout his childhood and he liked to think that, from the experience, he had learned a great deal how to butter pompous adults up. He was very good at
In a flash, they were both off the balcony and back up in the air, their laughter and light taunts echoing in the wind.
Spending the summer in Grimmauld Place instead. Explaining to Severus that he wanted to spend the last few months before Hogwarts with Sirius and Remus, since he'd be with Severus during the whole school year anyway. Learning the corkscrew dive from Sirius. Tending to Remus on the days after the full moon. Improving his human drawings. Going to Hogsmeade. Riding the Hogwarts Express. Sharing a compartment with a boy named Ronald Weasley. Choosing Slytherin again. Meeting Draco Malfoy for the first time but avoiding his offers of friendship with projected indifference until he gave up. Not being friends with Draco Malfoy. Not being friends with Pansy Parkinson or Blaise Zabini or Crabbe or Goyle. Not counting Professor Quirrel's ticks. Not getting detention. Not going into the Forbidden Forest.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Come on,” he said, twisting his wrist to get out of Draco’s grasp only for his fingers to wrap around Draco’s wrist instead. He tugged him along. “Let’s get you to Severus.”
Laughter rang through the halls and made Harry's ears itch. It came from just around the corner and he almost didn't want to step forward in fear that what he might see will trigger his magic to run wild and uncontrollable again but
This time, Harry closes his eyes, and lets Malfoy’s trembling shoulders appear behind his eyelids. “Yeah.”
It was eerie, the quiet inside the Maze. Everything was surrounded by a thick fog, so that you wouldn't be able to see that far off in the distance even with Lumos. From time to time, Harry would hear sounds – slithering, crickets, a shuffle… but nothing would come out of the shadows to attack him. He wasn't sure if that made him relieved or even more terrified.
Dumbledore was calm when he looked at Snape in the eye. A small, sad smile had been on his lips. “I take it that your rightly guided anger towards me means that you will take care of the child?”
Harry looks away, unable to look at Draco’s sneer anymore, not when he’s gotten so used to his face without it. “Yes, Malfoy, I do want to be friends with you,” he mutters. He takes a deep breath to ease the tightness in his chest. “I… thought we already were.”
And then one day, Draco wakes up, and the room is empty, like how it’s been empty for the past three months, until he realizes it’s not empty after all, and there’s Potter suddenly in the middle of the room, all pink cheeks and sheepish smile and everything that Draco’s not supposed to have.
from slipping past his lips. He thinks the shock of the pain at knowing that Draco likes somebody else helped. He doesn’t even know why it still hurts, because up until a minute ago, he had thought that that somebody else was Astoria—
Draco didn't skip a beat in his counting even as he replied, "Is this about snogging? Because I can tell you now, Potter, that you're not the first one to tell me that." He finished counting and wrote the number down on his parchment with a satisfied nod.
"I do not think that Voldemort will occupy himself with young Draco here," Dumbledore mused, his calm and light voice cutting through the tension. He looked at Draco from above his glasses. "I ask that you not worry about that, my boy, but we must still exercise utmost caution. Also," he continued. "I believe it's best if we settle this argument elsewhere. Draco must be tired."
Despite his downtrodden mood, the edges of Harry’s lips twitched up slightly at the name. The childish feud between Severus and Sirius amused him more than it made him concerned. “He’s working on some last minute lesson plans.”
He looked pointedly at the two short paragraphs on Harry’s parchment. Professor McGonagall had required three feet.
His name was murmured tearily against his hair, and Draco awkwardly hugged back. Despite Narcissa being away most of the time in whatever romantic country stroke her fancy, Draco knew that she was actually fiercely protective of him.
It’s… People are obviously going to talk, you know. This isn’t going to be the last time, and there’s really nothing else that they can say about me that hasn’t already been said, but you—you’re going to get the worst of it. Harry Potter being friends with an ex-Death Eater, someone who’s a little insane—“
was one name that always came up. “Goyle hasn’t been contacted by anyone in years. Nott, as I’m sure you’re aware, is a wanted wizard all across the United Kingdom for numerous, petty crimes.”
He had been prepared to see her again. But even though she was a lot thinner and a lot older-looking than Snape remembered or even imagined her to be, it was like being transported back in time, when they were younger and life was brighter, when he and Lily were still the best of friends, when Petunia sent him cross looks every time he picked Lily up for their mandatory Saturday afternoon walk by the lake…
Before Harry could contemplate this anymore, the sound of water rushing from behind him made him turn his head right in time to see a huge shark zoom by him. This huge shark had a human body. A rather buff human body.
He had been lying when he said that they had been looking at alternative methods, because of course Kingsley would never consent to working with other Death Eaters. It had too many risks involved, much like what Draco said.
During the night, exhausted and eyes swollen after crying so much, he had somehow fallen asleep, and for this, he is grateful. He doesn’t know how he could have survived that whole night awake.
and sometimes they’re nice stories about his childhood, his family, his friends, and sometimes they’re not so nice, and more than once, Draco had ended up disappearing on him for a few minutes.
turned to look at him, with an incredulous look that quickly turned into a glare. "Are you serious, Malfoy?
Draco Malfoy inside, leaning back on his seat with one arm propped on the window sill, eyes gazing out into the bright scenery on the other side of the glass. He’s present, Harry knows this immediately. He sees this in the alertness in Draco’s eyes and in the tension in his shoulders.
As he walked through the corridors of Hogwarts, he realized that it was already night time. He cast a quick
Lupin took both suitcases and put them in the pocket of his trousers. “Thank you,” he whispered earnestly and glanced down at Harry, who still had Black all over him but was now looking at the two of them in confusion. Lupin wore his best smile and directed it at Harry, even as he spoke his words for Snape. “And for Harry.”
. Being so near to the dragon's fire was excruciating, Harry almost whimpered at the pain of the heat on his skin. When the flames died down, Harry's eyes were painfully dry and his throat was parched. He closed his eyes tight to lessen the pain and forcefully swallowed. Then, he took out his wand and yelled, "
Harry watched, dizzy, as his blood was collected in a glass phial, and then poured inside the cauldron. He watched like he had been separated from his body, like he was watching all these unfold like an outsider, as the cauldron sizzled, then spluttered, until it was sending hot streams of viscous liquid everywhere, and then –
And all at once, Harry can see it, the weight on her shoulders: Her husband forever lost in Azkaban, leaving her with a multitude of sins, a ruined name, and a tainted home that once hosted a madman. Her son, the only remaining love of her life, lost within his own mind.
There is a pause, one that lasts long enough for the tears to prick his eyes, before Potter murmurs, “That’s for me to decide.”
and magical plants and owls and House Elves and creatures big and small that Muggles believed only existed in fairytales.
He felt as if weight was added on to his shoulders, but he had lived through his whole life with heavy shoulders. What was a little more?
“How am I supposed to eat them when you shove them in your mouth the first chance you get? Fucking manners, Potter.”
No matter the amount of pain that Draco may endure during the exact moment of spellcasting, there didn’t seem to be any lasting effects on his body and while there was a
Harry didn’t mind. The cat had become a welcome presence in his flat that he’d even started considering the cat as his. (Old lady’s or not.)
More and more hooded figures appeared in the night, until there were about ten, twenty of them, all gathered around the Dark Lord, Harry still tied to the tombstone, and Cedric Diggory's body.
of you," he finished harshly, eyes narrowing particularly at Lavender Brown, who had also snapped out of her own stupor and had started to turn a very dark shade of red.
“It’s alright, Harry,” he comforted, reaching out to ruffle the boy’s hair. “It must have surprised you to see a pencil in this old house.”
Harry hesitated, holding a treacle tart in one hand. He took out the Marauders' Map, held up the treacle tart, pointed to the dot that said 'Draco Malfoy', and smiled sheepishly.
He blinked those memories away and turned his head. Potter was looking at him strangely, eyebrows knitted together with guilt.
Just then, another loud hiss echoed in the Great Hall. The voices dimmed down and all heads turned towards the center where the Goblet of Fire stood, its flames as high and as wild as ever. The flames should have died down by now.
He’s not supposed to be meeting Potter in the library after classes, doing homework, smirking at Potter’s dismay at having to witness Weasley and Granger’s snogging sessions all the time.
Thankfully, they weren't joined at the hip and went through their careers independently. Hermione established herself a respectable position in society as a renowned and distinguished Acquitor for House Elves and Other Creatures, and Ron became the youngest Auror to also become an Animagi Instructor ever.
space. The bed was a double-sized one, although it only had one pillow. Draco kept it for himself, because he didn’t think Potter would appreciate a pillow with three days’ worth of sweat.
Pansy rolled his eyes. "Hush now, Harry, don't you worry your pretty little head over it. Some girls love dark and broody boys."
“No, nothing, but…” Potter paused, frowning. He chewed on his lower lip whenever he’s worried and Draco tried not to stare at that, too. “Repeated stress on the body is dangerous, is what she said. And well, we don’t really want to put you in danger.” He coughed nervously, and then added, “Well, any more than we already have, I mean.”
Harry immediately looks up, searching, even though everything’s blurred. He looks for where one person is pointing and where other people are looking, and he squints, willing his vision to focus, and realizes that they’re looking at
who absolutely had no idea. Still, he didn't want Draco to return to his book, so he urged the conversation forward.
Then, still feeling like how Ron must have felt when he vomited slugs in second year, he marched towards the library.
.” Her wide eyes stared into his wildly. “Give me a moment,” she muttered before closing the door in his face.
It was weird, having the whole Common Room to himself. Draco always went home during holidays, so he didn't know how quiet it was without all the students. He wondered if Pansy and Blaise worried about him, because with no one around, Draco could admit that he worried about them.
The next day, Harry was already rethinking his decision. If he thought that his eight year subjects were hell, it was nothing compared to the experience of going through them when you couldn't
“Eating well-rounded meals in regular intervals in a day isn’t going to make you fat. But I do hope that the childhood stories are working.”
And he wasn’t sure if their friendship was ready for those kinds of questions. He swallowed those words down, and said instead, “We’re heading for the lake. That’s where the locket was destroyed.”
The Dark Lord was vanquished, dead, never seen again ever since he had Turned Harry Potter and got himself poisoned by Potter's blood. So he didn't really think much of it when his father told him to help Potter with the gillyweed, make sure Potter stayed in the Tournament, come with him on the evening of the Third Task,
Potter tilted his head at him, probably bewildered that Draco was adamant about this. But there was nothing weird about it at all. If Potter didn’t want to entrust this… whatever this was to
When he closes his eyes, he can still remember the heat of the flames of Fiendfyre licking his clothes. Draco screaming
Draco also found it amusing that Potter, Saint Potter, felt like he was obligated to ask that every time.
He strained against the ropes, felt its burn as it chafed his skin, but could only grit his teeth and clench his jaw when the knife pierced the skin of his arm. The blood dripping down his hand felt hot.
Ron slowly turned green. He quickly decided to forget and purge from his memory that his girlfriend had ever mentioned him being (Merlin help all of us!) infatuated with Malfoy. In fact, he may just Obliviate himself later.
Potter is arranging his robes as neatly as he can, before he takes out his wand again, taps the Map, and says, “Mischief managed.”
His stiff shoulders and red-rimmed, sunken eyes fool no one in the room, though Harry suspects that Draco isn’t really trying to deceive anyone.
He covered his ears with his hands, and yet he still heard everything. The shuffling of feet, the sound of cinder being crushed, and Narcissa’s parting words:
He just felt defeated somewhat, like all his fight had been for nothing. No – it wasn't for nothing. After all, Voldemort was dead and his soul had been thrown away to burn for all eternity but – did it really make a difference?
And it’s this conversation again and Harry’s tense, wondering if what happened before will repeat itself. Narcissa isn’t here to help him anymore and Harry wouldn’t know what to do.
His chest that held his things was already at the foot of his bed, and he could already see some of his robes through the glass window of the dresser.
"You realize that I can't do much for you," Madame Pomfrey continued. "The Lip-Lock Jinx can only be removed by the caster, or if you fulfill the requirements expected of you." Here, her lips curled up slightly in amusement.
Draco's eyebrows shot up in surprise. "The Weaslette? Is it some kind of revenge for breaking up with her?"
"Ah," Draco said in understanding, glancing at the books about Jinxes behind Harry. He paused again, before thinking better of it and returning back to his book, forcing himself to read.
But Lily didn’t burn in the open sun, didn’t have sharp teeth or night vision or healing powers, and even when she had been down with the flu, had never been that pale.
Draco was sitting under that tall window again, the light from outside casting a glow around him. Harry found himself pausing just to
Sitting in front the fireplace, alone in the common room with his blanket and the quiet to envelop him, the gravity of his situation slowly but surely started to sink in.
Harry nodded, used to Remus making things sound better than they really were because he didn't want others to worry. "Have you told Severus that it's been getting worse lately?"
Draco racked his brain for all that was told to him as a child and all that he read as a young, curious student. "They suck blood, of course. That's what they're best known for. They heal faster than the normal Wizard, and have better vision, especially at night. Others reported increased strength. Can't go out under the sun, but there are Potions for that now. Oh, and they only start to need human blood after puberty, at 18 years old… but we also have blood banks for that."
The thing was, how was he supposed to get the blasted Jinx off him? Ginny was still back in the Great Hall and Harry really didn't want to entertain the thought of begging her. Kissing Malfoy was, of course, not a choice. There
“Alright, then,” Malfoy said, flexing his fingers around his wand. He looked at Harry. “What do I do, O Great Potter?”
The next few months passed by in an excruciatingly slow pace. Harry supposed it was easy to feel restless knowing the number of days left that you're scheduled to probably die.
Harry turned beet red and tried to hide the few drawings that he could reach using his small hands. “Uhm, Remus gave me some pencils and…”
It’s making sense now, then, the amount of time that she and Draco have been spending together. There’s a part of him that’s hurt, somehow, that Narcissa hadn’t asked him, which he desperately tries to squash down, because of course he wouldn’t have been able to help even if Narcissa had. Even though he and Draco are in the same year, they are still in different houses with different class schedules, and it’s not like they can very well eat together or spend time after curfew together.
He wasn't sure if it was because of the sudden loss of blood or the accumulated stress of everything that he had seen in the bathroom. Nevertheless, his feet led him to Potter's bed just in time for his knees to buckle under him and for him to lose consciousness.
Or, well, he isn’t really supposed to be taking care of Draco Malfoy. He’s just really here to keep him company, avoid the media while he’s at it, and eat the breakfast that Malfoy doesn’t eat.
no relative in Venice to begin with. His mother just wanted a two-week vacation from the ever tedious task of a trophy wife and the more tedious task of a mother.
Draco's shoulders shook, and Harry almost panicked at the thought that he did something wrong – Draco probably thought he was a creep – until Harry turned to look at him, and he realized with amazement that Draco was
Harry sighed heavily. Knowing Draco (and he knew him really, really well), he wasn't going to stop this anytime soon. "Do you really believe I would have put my name in that stupid cup?"
Severus nodded. "The venom eventually loses its potency after a few weeks. But by then, your muscles would have started to atrophy, and your internal organs would stop to function. Enough time for Voldemort to… acquire what he wanted at his own leisurely pace."
The look that Draco gives him tells him that no, it is not enough. Draco still looks like he wants to ask another question, but in the end, he just takes the napkin from his plate and unfolds it on his lap.
Draco quickly learned the Corkscrew Dive and Potter did the same with the Wronski Feint. So they moved on to another maneuvers to exchange.
It really shouldn't have surprised him that the whole Hogwarts population now knew that Harry Potter was under the infamous Lip-Lock Jinx, but the outburst that greeted him still made him freeze. There were a lot of whistles and catcalls, and a lot of "Kiss
Satisfied, Snape nodded at the two boys. “Harry, show Draco around. I have work to do. Be ready for dinner at six o’clock sharp.”
And all at once—a burst of blinding light, a hundred thousand agonized screams filling the forest, screams of dying men and women, hisses, pained hisses, like snakes burning in a fire pit, the rush of blood in Harry’s ears, deep and deafening, and painful, until the screams thinned into a single piercing sound that made his head want to explode, until the sound slowly transformed itself back into the agonized screams of a single person, strangely muted at first, as if in the distance, and gradually getting louder and louder and louder—
They’re on the bridge, and the cold November wind slaps at their robes and bites their cheeks. Draco doesn’t stop, but Harry hadn’t really expected him to, and so he leaps forward and grabs Draco’s wrist.
Potter's hands lowered. So did his shoulders. He flashed a small, rueful smile in Draco's direction. "Yeah, it's… It's a bit hard coming to terms that I'm what everyone says."
Harry covered his ears with his hand, face cringing in pain. Crabbe suddenly jumped out of his bed and dropped onto the floor with a panicked shout.
, Draco felt the same waves of guilt crash down on him. He cleared his throat loudly. "Quite alright, Potter," he said. "I was only teasing."
Harry already knows what they’re going to talk about. They walk out towards the entrance courtyard, but there are still students milling around, killing time before their first class, and so they walk towards the boathouse instead.
“No,” Harry responds quickly. He shakes his head, tries to calm himself. Right. He’s supposed to be the calm one here. “You’re out. You’re in the Manor.”
The boy looked miserable at that but Snape was proud of his effort to put on a brave face afterwards. “Are they nice?” Harry whispered.
How was he to say that the ticket to getting the Jinx of him was actually sitting in front of him? And that it didn't
… to do it.” Potter put his fork down suddenly and pinched the bridge of his nose. He took a deep breath, and Draco watched as Potter visibly collected himself. When he was done, he was sitting straight once again and when he turned to Draco, he looked so serious that Draco was reminded once again that, for this mission, Harry was his superior
Harry collected enough of himself to close his opened mouth and to look at Draco indignantly. “Well, if you’re so happy, then I don’t think I should worry at all anymore.”
Draco grit his teeth, willing himself back to the present. He swallowed down the bile that had threated to claw up his throat, and looked at Potter. “I know.”
"Tough," Draco said merely, shrugging. He paused, as if wanting to say something more. His eyes flickered back to his book, contemplating on ending the conversation there. Either way, Harry still would have forced the conversation to continue, but it made him grin when Draco looked back up at him again, struggling to hide the curiosity in his voice.
Harry shrugs nervously. He feels like he’s just been caught doing something he wasn’t supposed to be doing. He supposes that it
Draco shakes his head in disbelief. He’s still staring at Harry and the tart like they’re going to jump at him. “You and your sweet tooth will one day be the death of you, Potter.”
He felt the bile crawl up his throat at the memory. He closed his eyes tightly to shut out the image, and also because his vision was starting to swim again.
Platform 9 ¾ is full and close to bursting by the time Harry pushes his cart through the wall. It is as Kingsley warned him: Common folk and paparazzi alike are going to be fighting tooth and nail to get a glimpse of him.
He wondered for the umpteenth time what life would be like if Severus hadn't taken him from the Dursleys. Eight years away from his days in Privet Drive, it was still his bad habit. He wondered what life would be like without Severus.
A whimper below him had him looking down abruptly, and he stared – with wide eyes and a sick feeling unfurling in his stomach – at the child who was standing, tensed, with his arms above his head for protection.
With a sigh, Dumbledore leaned forward in his desk and looked at Snape from above his crescent-shaped spectacles. “Would you like some help? I could owl Minerva or Professor Sprout. Hmm, Pomona seems to be more suited in teaching that young a child, no?”
So now, they both stood in front of the Cup, each with one hand hovering over each handle. They looked at each other and nodded, ready to give glory to Hogwarts.
"You're…" Draco started, swallowing nervously as Harry sat down on the chair across him. "You're really giving it to me?" he said, once again in that quiet and unsure voice of his that Harry had come to hate.
But then Severus sighed, and his face relaxed just a tiny bit, as he started to collect the papers scattered on his desk and arrange them into a neat pile. "I had complete faith that you would see the Second Task through."
owe you anything. You still owe me for that gillyweed and that detention." Draco huffed, conveniently omitting the fact that it was his father that told him to give Potter the gillyweed in compliance with some Dark plan that Draco had yet to ask about.
Despite what Sirius and Remus said, he found himself a bit nervous and shy to check each compartment on the train for Draco. Instead, he found himself an empty one and hoped that he’d see his friend in Hogwarts instead.
Voldemort ignored him and turned his chilling smile to Lucius. "Is that why you have brought me your son, Lucius? To appease me?"
you wanker. I'm starting to realize now that it's really just genetic, and not… well, something violent." Then he realized that he probably said something nice, so he added, "Thanks to your spineless way of avoiding things."
No one was present in the Paved Courtyard for everyone was busily scurrying off towards the Great Hall for dinner. Harry wondered if now was a good time as any to hex Ginny's hair into snakes.
scribbled there in pencil, there really was no practical reason at the moment for the Ministry to go off making inauspicious deals with (other) ex-Death Eaters.
He crosses the room, conscious of Draco’s piercing gaze on him the whole time. As he nears, he glances at the table. “Eggs?”
Severus had told him to call him Professor Snape when he was in Hogwarts and no matter how many times Harry tried it in his head, it still sounded weird. What was Severus like as a professor? Harry imagined he’d probably be strict, just like he was at home.
Snape was a professional when it came to hiding his emotions. He had done it as a child when the relationship of his parents catapulted into disaster. He had done it as a student when James Potter and his posse teased and taunted him. He had done it when Lily told him that she was going to marry James Potter.
Draco colored, unused to being praised like that. He was used to being praised for his grades, flying skills, even his charm, but not for his character. He knew he had a horrible personality. This made him feel awkward.
Draco peers at him and then his book, trying to make sense of what he’s seeing. He tilts his head. Swallows. It takes a while before he talks. “What are you doing in my house again?”
Harry winced, but that still didn't lessen the shock at having Draco so close, and if Harry just moved a little bit, then their lips would touch again and they'd kiss and –
Harry wrote on the parchment, pushing it towards Draco. He looked at the words sadly, wishing that the world thought the same.
“No. No, I…” Potter looked away, a far-off look on his face, before he shook his head. “I still have work to do.”
Draco snorted. "As far as I know, once a Death Eater, always a Death Eater," he muttered bitterly. "There's no quit option."
Draco swallowed it without preamble. Even without Severus telling him what it was, he trusted and revered Severus enough as a Potioneer that he would drink whatever the man gave him.
Cheers erupted from the crowd as the broom flew its way to Harry's waiting hand. A few boos cut through the air, and Harry was dizzy enough that he wasn't sure if they came from other schools or from the other houses of Hogwarts. They were easily drowned out by the cheers, however, as Harry flipped a leg over the Nimbus and kicked towards the sky.
It had been four days since the jinx first hit him. You'd think that people would have gotten tired of it by now, but a lot of girls still called to him whenever he'd pass by and ambushed him whenever they'd catch him alone. There were a few guys who tried to plant big, wet ones on him, but Harry always immediately Accio-ed whatever near object there was to hit them. (Alright, so he did feel a bit sorry for the one who was stupid enough to ambush Harry in the greenhouse, of all places. Harry didn't think that getting hit by a
Theodore waved a hand in greeting as Draco neared them but didn’t pause in his conversation with Harry. “—Viktor Krum probably for Durmstrang. Any bets for Hogwarts?”
Right. They were on a mission. And Malfoy would probably be the one doing most of the work in these missions.
Potter pulls him close, too close, and throws the Cloak around both of their shoulders. It’s a tight fit around two grown men, but Potter keeps him close and Draco doesn’t move away.
Unsurprisingly, Potter avoided eye-contact with him all throughout dinner. Which was fine. Draco pointedly ignored him as well. He still wasn't sure what to feel after having to give his blood to a vampire.
Harry rolled his eyes. For the past few days he’d known Draco, he never could get past the first syllable of the word
“Bollocks,” Ron says. “You better start using it on Astoria Greengrass, too. They’re getting awfully touchy.”
"I still don't get why the Weaslette jinxed you," Draco said the next day, peering curiously at his pudding.
As he nibbled on a treacle tart, Harry thought about Snape and how the man must be laughing in his grave right about now at how Harry was suffering at the hands of Advanced Potions. Slughorn was a good teacher, but there were moments that Harry just… had no fucking idea what he was talking about.
Draco ready for that? No, he wasn’t. But he damn well knew that he wouldn’t be able to stomach turning tail when his body still had use.
Harry knew that the Lavender and her girls wouldn't follow McGonagall's orders and stay quiet for very long, but that didn't stop him from hoping.
Quickly, Draco's eyes skirted over Harry behind Madame Pomfrey before they returned to looking at the floor. He shrugged, before wincing as he realized that the motion was not very wise. "Stinging Hex," he muttered lowly, but in the empty infirmary, Harry heard it all the same.
he wrote, not really meaning the capital letters but it was just that his hand deemed it appropriate.
Third, he was surprised to find that he was… disappointed. This was the most exciting thing that has happened in his life ever since the Time Turner, and the thrill of flying, being chased by a dragon, swimming under the Great Lake… Less conspiratorial whispers behind his back, other students in Hogwarts actually saying hi to him, slowly getting more friends…
"Alright, alright, come over, you little wormballs," Mad Eye Moody gruffed out, shuffling into the middle of the room with a small black bag at hand. "Get one."
“Oh?” Draco rolled the Snitch around until he found the text between its wings. Harry held his breath as Draco read it, taking note of the sudden raise of both of Draco’s eyebrows as he finished. Harry almost didn’t want to hear what Draco had to say when the other opened his mouth to speak, but thankfully, Seamus chose that time to whistle boisterously.
He is looking fuller now, more alive. His cheeks have filled and the colour is coming back to his skin. Inexplicably, Harry is suddenly very, very relieved that Draco isn’t indisposed enough that he can’t eat. Narcissa has told him, through the letters that they have started to exchange, that Draco’s spending more and more time present with her lately.
He let the implications of his words dawn on Lupin and was satisfied when the werewolf’s eyes widened and his breath hitched. He rummaged into one of the front pockets of his robes and pulled out two miniature suitcases.
Draco opened his eyes, but Severus was already marching inside the bathroom, a vial of blood in his hand. He must have already had the empty vial ready.
Draco cringed. That was true. He glanced back and forth between his father and Dumbledore. "Are you…"
“Of course,” he said, before narrowing his eyes towards Harry’s kitchen. “You’re going to have to bring that red wine from the Inquisition Era though, because I will not allow myself to drown in commoner’s beer during that commoner’s party.”
Draco wakes up to the scent of sweat, treacle tart, and fresh soap. He’s being carried on someone’s back, and he knows immediately who it is. His nose is buried in Potter’s hair and he’s not sure if
Malfoy’s raised eyebrow told him that he didn’t believe that something as simple as Finite Incantatem would do the trick, but Malfoy dutifully kept his mouth shut about it. Instead, he said, “So should I use my left hand…? You must know I’m right-handed, Potter, so using my left hand might not go as well as expected, but that’s where the Mark is.”
Dumbledore nodded in understanding. "The charms on the Age Line that I have put around the Goblet were still in place at the very last moment Harry's name was chosen."
Perhaps Malfoy was looking at the Slytherin table, recalling his younger self, surrounded by friends, during easier times.
He had walked back to his room, but was surprised to find that the rooms he had seen to be dusty just a few minutes before were now squeaky clean. Kreacher must have cleaned them.
The boy was still looking at him dubiously and Snape knew then, without a doubt, that lying would only reverse all of his efforts for the past two months to earn the boy’s trust.
Draco disappears in the middle of conversations, sometimes, but they pick it up as soon as he comes back. Sometimes, it takes a while for him to remember, but Harry waits patiently, every time.
A tug at his pants had him looking down and he exhaled in relief at the sight of his cat looking up at him petulantly, as if irked by the fact that Harry did not follow it.
His stomach growled in complaint, but he was scared to go out of the room. Scared that if he went out now, he would face the reality that Potter got his head hit by a bludger and it was all because Draco was being immature and venting out his anger on him and now Potter may not even be –
The boy dipped the quill in the well and went back to scribbling, but Snape most definitely noticed the trembling of his fingers that hadn’t been there before.
Dumbledore's voice, amplified by a Sonorus Charm, echoed around the Hall. Voices of the students grew in excitement, before settling into a hushed murmur.
Pansy beamed. "Lovely! See you, Harry!" And then she was off, sauntering back to where Draco and Blaise were playing Exploding Snap.
Mister Ollivander was a really friendly man who knew who Harry was even as Harry flattened his hair over his forehead, but he was really nice about it and shook Harry’s hands about seven times before he was off between his shelves muttering about phoenix feathers.
“The one that Professor Dumbledore destroyed in his office was Marvolo Gaunt’s Ring,” Harry said while thoughtfully chewing on his beefsteak. He knew full well that these were
“Harry,” comes Ron’s voice from the other side of the door, and it’s soft and careful, and Harry knows at once that Ron knows something.
"We're done for," came that uninterested drawl that Harry would recognize in any crowd. "10 galleons Durmstrang wins the Triwizard Tournament."
Snape scowled at him, failing to see what he could be finding amusing in all of this. “He doesn’t know
Draco did his best to comfort him or tell him otherwise, but all the low mutterings and suspicious stares that he got in the halls only fuelled his belief of Narcissa Malfoy’s words:
Weasley, Granger, and Kingsley were surprised to see him walk through the doors of the briefing room, and it was understandable. Draco knew the gravity of having somebody else hold knowledge about horcruxes, and he knew why they didn’t want
“The locations were too close,” Potter explained, seeing his confusion. “The magic in both areas were too close that they both reacted with your spell at the same time.”
Draco nods mutely, because he’s not about to do something stupid like ask Potter to stay. The throbbing in his head had lessened to a dull throb, and so he tries to sit back up again.
He scans the Great Hall, but sees nothing out of the ordinary. It’s already late in the morning, and so the Great Hall is not as crowded as it usually is during meals. Students mill around and groups of friends cluster together in chitchat and laughter. He turns back to his own friends. “I don’t see it.”
, but he likes this, eating pancakes like this. By the time he’s finished eating the fourth, Draco has managed to swallow three pieces. There’s syrup on his lap and the front of his nightgown, and there’s also some dripping down his arm, but Harry respectfully looks away from that, too.
Draco accepts the chocolate frogs every time, and even tries some of Ginny’s Beans. He looks at Hermione’s task list, and never fails to make totally unnecessary comments. “You haven’t done your Potions essay yet? Potter, I’ve finished that
Malfoy was confused at the vague request, but he quickly realized what Harry had planned to do. With a sigh, he rolled up his sleeve and offered his arm. “You might as well stop asking for permission, Potter, if we’ll be doing this at least five more times.”
“I forgive you,” he said loudly. Draco’s head shot up to look at him in surprise and confusion as to why his voice was so loud. Harry swallowed and continued. “And I took my potion already, so if you’re still up for that broomstick race…” he trailed off and was relieved when Draco finally smiled.
It seemed very dramatic, the way that the glass shards rained down on them like sparkling snow, but it wasn't like that at all, at least, not how Harry saw it because what he saw was the seventh-year's head turn as if in slow motion and the look of horror and fear slowly spread across his face the moment he laid eyes on Harry Potter through the rain of glass.
He swerved his broom, intent on going away as far as possible and possibly Incendio-ing the whole stupid Black house, ignoring Potter's frantic calls of "Malfoy! Malfoy, stop!
“I didn’t mean it like that, you pillock,” Draco said with a sigh, but a smirk was on his face. He raised the Golden Snitch up to present it to Harry. “Thank you for this,” he said earnestly.
The sight of Potter looking so unguarded made Draco uncomfortable enough for him to do something unexpected as well—he scooted over to the side of the bed, slowly because every moment still made something in his head throb, and waved a hand at the empty space.
“When Harry comes, he’ll probably avoid Malfoy like Quidditch players avoid bludgers,” Ron hissed out, purposefully using a Quidditch analogy to quickly send the point home to Ginny.
Potter was shaking his head furiously now, still trying to press himself deeper into the corner futilely. He sounded like he was… gagging. "
That was why when his father came to him and told him that his mother had finally agreed with Draco's living arrangements for the holidays, he had no more complaints to give.
– but Harry supposed that that was what made his small acts of thoughtfulness seem like grand gestures.
And by 'their', Harry meant Ron and Hermione's because ever since they got married last May, Harry's thought of all their possessions by the collective term as 'theirs'. After they got together during the war, Harry started to regard them as this inseparable unit. He had even come to the point where he would privately describe their little friendship as ‘him and them’ although he'd outgrown that childish bitterness of his and started to regard their strong relationship with awe and just a little bit of envy, the kind that was due to the yearning to have that kind of relationship one day.
But no, he’s just getting worse, and Potter’s angry, and he misses the Manor, and the garden, and breakfast, and Potter.
With a few swishes and flicks, Draco felt his head clear up, but the nausea was still there. He also felt himself floating in mid-air, back towards his bed. The blanket tucked itself around him. His body sagged on the bed, relaxed. Madame Pomfrey must have given him a Relaxing Charm.
Well, of course it would be strange, wouldn’t it? Your male workmate offering his bed to you. But Draco could use the excuse that he was medically incapacitated and Potter could use the excuse that he was dangerously sleep-deprived, and so Draco didn’t comment further and just raised an arm to block out the room’s yellow lights from his eyes.
He isn’t even sure anymore if he is angry because the old wizards in the Wizengamot hadn't listened to him (
Harry allowed himself another deep breath. He patted his front pocket, where a spoon quietly lay. “Yes.”
Potter doesn’t look assured, but he nods back and walks towards the door. He holds the cloak open. And then he sighs. He turns back to Draco, opens his mouth as if to say something, but decides against it. He closes his mouth again. Instead, he says with a small smile, “See you tomorrow, then.”
Draco sagged against his bed, suddenly remembering that he was actually very tired right now. "I still think he needs detention for this."
Harry was panicking. He didn't want those memories of Draco gone, he wanted to remember each and every one of them,
He’s definitely happy. Damn Potter. “Worried that poor little Draco went bonkers and wandered off into the Lake?”
Ginny tried to look offended. "Harry," she exclaimed, scandalized. "Do you know how hard it is for me, knowing that you're unhappy?"
“I can’t believe you talked to Ron,” Potter muttered, scouring through Headmistress McGonagall’s desk for anything that looked amiss.
Ron stretched out a hand to clamp on his shoulder and squeeze it firmly. His eyes were grave as he looked straight into Hartsman’s eyes and imparted on his wisdom. “If you want to keep your job, Hartsman, you’ll speak none of this to anyone. Now excuse me while I go look for Malfoy…”
"Dragons!" Sirius' head exclaimed excitedly from the fireplace three days later. "The First Task includes dragons!" His head was practically jumping up and down, oblivious to all the colour slowly draining from Harry's face. Then again, it probably would have been hard to notice since Floo calls usually coloured your face green.
When the tingling feeling of magic left his skin, he opened his eyes. There was a spot on the underside of his arm that was a little pink, and there was a vial filled with a dark, red liquid in Madame Pomfrey's hand.
"We already have three Champions, one from each school," Karkaroff agreed. He tapped his cane impatiently on the floor. "We have no need for a fourth one. No offense intended, my boy." He added the last part as an afterthought.
to see that avoiding the problem doesn’t really fix it, kind of makes it bigger and more daunting, and that yes, the war’s over, but that doesn’t mean that everything’s okay.
Draco tried to stifle a smile. “And I suppose you’ve already reported to Kingsley about our mission?”
It would explain why the Dark Marks did not disappear even after his death, and why Malfoy occasionally still suffered sharp pains from it.
Slowly but surely, Harry's shoulders started to relax, until he was slumped against the chair in his usual careless manner.
But this time was different though because they were leaving him with Uncle Severus, his godfather, and Uncle Severus wasn’t a man easily buttered – which was precisely why Draco enjoyed being with him so much and why Draco had looked forward to his stay in the man’s Manor more than he had ever looked forward to Christmases.
But seeing the boy again… It opened up that dam of guilt that he had desperately tried, for six years, to hold back.
Pansy immediately stepped forward, right next to Hagrid, the Gamekeeper.  Her face was a pale white when she screeched out, “You are
Harry found himself grinning despite the insults to his intelligence (and his father's). "Thanks, guys. I think I can take it from here."
Pansy blinked at him innocently with her fake eyelashes. "Oh, come on, Harry, don't tell me you've never thought about snogging before!"
If this keeps up, they were going to have a long night. "Malfoy, leave the scrubbing to me and just do the inventory, would you?"
Draco slammed his fist on the table, sighing heavily. He pushed the images of Little Hangleton at the back of his mind. Tombstones everywhere, figures in black, a tall, madman with gray, wrinkled skin and a flat face, something that wasn't human…
He rolls his sleeves up, moves towards the sink, and can’t wait for morning to come, for Draco to wake him up, kiss him, fuss over him and his scratches, and greet him good morning and a happy Christmas.
It was on the seventh day, a week after the Jinx first hit him, when Lavender Brown decided she couldn't take it anymore.
Draco huffs in reply. He shakes his head, still incredulous, but that movement reminds him that he still has a headache and so he lies back down on the mattress. It’s ludicrous, that’s what this whole thing is.
Auror reflexes had Harry running after it before he could even think about what he was doing. He thought about calling after the cat but realized he hadn't even named it.
"Small detail," Draco agreed, rolling his finished parchment and settling it on Severus' desk. "But if you want me to compliment you that much, then you did a pretty good job, too. One might even think you're used to this kind of work."
He’s figured it out, somewhat. The things that make Draco disappear. But although Draco doesn’t seem to like talking about the things that he did or the things he thinks that happened because of it, Harry thinks that maybe, Draco
