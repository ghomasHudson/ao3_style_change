As Arlene and Luna left the Ravenclaw common room they ran into Hermione Granger. She ran up to Luna and asked, “I need your help with S.P.E.W.”
Krum got a Norwegian Ridgeback. Harry had seen a baby of this breed back in his first year when Hagrid tried to keep one as a pet.
“Yours, the ghosts below, the owls on the roof. I read them all at the same time.” She was still recovering from it. “It was so sudden. I didn’t think I could do it. Much less that it would be that easy.” She had to take a shaky breath. “You were thinking of lunch.”
The thirtieth of October was when the visiting schools were scheduled to arrive. Arlene had slightly larger concerns as she placed her homework in front of Professor Barnes.
He nodded again and said, “I’ll open up to them. I should’ve known better than to think Harry and the others would’ve judged me. Especially Luna, I don’t think she’s capable of judging anyone harshly for something they can’t help.”
As soon as he was gone she heard someone coming down the stairs. She looked around to see Mrs. Weasley coming down the stairs. She also had bags under her eyes. Almost in a daze she went to the stove and began conjuring food into pans. She didn’t even notice Arlene was there until she turned around.
Joan held up a finger and said, “I have a suggestion.” She took one of Arlene’s hands and said, “each tournament eliminates one champion from each school. Just flunk the first tournament and you don’t have to do anymore.” She sighed and added, “that’s only if we don’t find a way to get you out of this another way. I’m going to get a hold of this rule book and comb it page to page to find a way to get you out of it.” She rubbed her hands in a motherly way. She smiled at her, “I know you don’t like this. We’ll help you.”
The doors were closed but unlocked. None of the beds had curtains around them. Some of the patients were awake and talking to each other. She walked up to Bastion’s bed first. He lay fast asleep. It made sense if what Madam Pomfrey said had been true. After being awake most of the night then he would need rest.
They reached a staircase that ended in a picture of a singing woman. Arlene asked, “where’s your knocker?”
She was massive and angry. Her whole body was shivering with rage at the idea of her eggs being threatened. She roared and Ron fell back against the doorway into the stadium with hands over his ears.
She turned to him. Her lip had been healed with magic already. She smiled at him and asked, “what could you have to offer me?”
Adrian left and returned to Hogwarts not long after. He went to his room. He pulled a bottle of firewhiskey out. He drank from it. It was then that he noticed that he wasn’t alone. “Hey Joan.”
The invisibility spell wore off but they were nearly a kilometer in the air according to Adrian. No one would see something as small as them from the ground. The spells on them protected them from the wind chill and any particles that came near them. The charmed seat made the ride more comfortable than a normal broom by far. His new broom was the latest model of Firebolt so speed wasn’t a problem. The charms on the broom even allowed them to hear each other talk.
Arlene woke up from an odd dream with a stiff back. In her dream she had been on a boat in the ocean. She had reached out over the water and touched an island that appeared from nothing. The only detail about the island she remembered was the dragons circling it in the sky.
It was quite the dilemma. Ginny had gained back enough confidence to say that if it was her then she would take whoever she wanted and not care what anyone thought. Luna and Arlene were different. Luna was already ostracized for her quirks and beliefs. Arlene fell into the same boat because they spent so much time together. Being found as gay on top of that would unleash the assholes on Hogwarts on them. There was only so much she could do to fight them off.
Everyone supported Ron because he came from a poor family and had no claim to fame. They wanted him to rise up and shine. Even the Slytherins were warming up to him as champion.
Luna smiled and said, “I agree. It would be nice to have a normal year for once.” A loud bang sounded off in the distance. “They really are enjoying those fireworks.”
Harry said, “if it is a group effort then Arlene could do something to distract while Ron and I use as many stunning spells on it that we can.” He looked to all of them for their thoughts.
I'm dropping this one a day early because I won't be able to do it tomorrow. Next week's schedule should be better than this week's.
They stepped out into the sun. Arlene already had her sunglasses on so it didn’t bother her as much. The light house was at the end of a jut of land that formed a bay with the mainland. A stone shed sat next to the cliff edge that led down to the water. The sign above the door had writing that looked familiar. It was all in Arabic but she checked it against the scrap of paper that Adrian had given her last night.
Professor McGonagall insisted, “this is all well and sweet but she must get her rest. This has been a trying day for her.”
“All of his notes are covered in black ink. Entire paragraphs had been blanked out.” She had to breathe deeply to keep calm.
Adrian sat at the table with them and explained, “we do the ritual in a cage. When big bad comes out of the cauldron he’ll be in the cage. The cage will be enchanted to prevent disapparition. We force him to drink truth potion before answering any questions. Then we get the answers we need.” He pulled a glossy brown block from his pocket and explained, “no risks, I’ll be placing this bomb under the cauldron. Buried in the dirt. If he tries to get out then we blow him back to Hell. I’m not letting the worst magical terrorist ever back out unless we prove his innocence.”
“Freak!?” Arlene screamed. She moved towards him but Hagrid placed a massive hand to stop her. She took several deep breaths and backed up.
Joan ordered, “Watch the kids, I’m going down to help Adrian out.” She ran down the hill without another word. Arlene could only watch helplessly as she ran into the chaos to try and find Adrian.
Ginny responded without looking up from her book, “that sounds right.” She then looked up at Arlene and asked, “are you mad?”
He was almost to the common room when a voice called out to him from the shadows. “Mr. Malfoy, what are you doing out so late?” He tensed up for a second until Professor Snape glided from the shadows and into his wand light. He wore an emotionless expression.
A snake the size of the basilisk that was made entirely of fire slithered by. One death eater was crushed in its jaws while another was trapped between it and a mausoleum. Both were dead quickly.
She tried to protest but the twins were stronger than they looked. “Hey! I’m trying to get to the library!”
They spent seven hours narrowing down the books. They took five breaks and ate once. For all their searching they turned up three books out of what felt like over a hundred.
He smiled at her as he said, “your guardian, Adrian, was a big help with rounding up the death eaters.” A jolt ran through her heart and it must’ve shown. He raised a hand and reassured her, “He’s fine. He should be on his way here soon.”
Harry, handsome as ever, sat in his chair. His eyes lifted to him when Draco arrived. “Hey,” Harry told him, “how was your day?”
Adrian pointed down the row and said, “the signs up top say those pertain to the Irish families. Or at least the ones from the United Kingdom area.”
It was still early but in her state of mind sleep would not return to her. She quietly left the room and went downstairs. There she found a tired and disheveled Author Weasley sitting at the dining room table. A cup of coffee sat in front of him. He looked at her over the bags under his eyes. “Hey, get any rest?”
He would protect Harry, despite the fact that he hated him and his father. He only would protect him for Lily, that was the only reason. That didn’t mean he had to be nice or even fair to him. As long as Potter lived then it mattered little to him if he was happy or not.
In the nicer one the tent was split up into various rooms. In one room, in separate sleeping bags, slept Arlene Connery and Luna Lovegood. The thing was that these two sleeping bags had found their way next to each other during the night. The two residents remained deep in sleep as the sun rose over the world.
They turned to him and said together, “you already made us dirty.” He screamed as he saw the adult faces of Lily and James with blood pouring down their faces.
Harry looked around as if the answer lay around them. “I don’t know. We can’t go public about us,” his frown deepened, “as much as I want to.” He scratched at his head and answered, “We’ll discuss it later. We’ll have to find somewhere. Somewhere secret.”
The next day at breakfast Hermione came over to them holding an opened purple envelope. She told them, “this is a letter from the ministry.”
A fist connected with Skeeter’s jaw. She crumpled to the ground like a rag doll as Joan screamed, “I’VE NEVER KILLED A CHILD YOU FUCKING BITCH! FUCK YOU!” McGonagall and Bagman held her back. She didn’t escape them even though she could’ve easily.
The event will be held June 17th in the Great Hall between 8 A.M. and 11 A.M. There will be a second chance to donate between 1 P.M. and 3 P.M. on the same day.
Adrian explained, “the door can only be opened by magical peoples. It is a public library so security isn’t that big of an issue that I can see.”
The dragon immediately grabbed the gold egg in her jaws and flung it at Arlene. It landed in front of her. She picked it up. The dragon told her, “your blood smells like Sarah’s. I never met her but Gathron, our king, did. He showed us her scent to know a human ally. My name is Thera. Gathron is hidden from the world. He is in the safe place. I do not know how to describe how to get there to a human. Only dragons know it naturally.”
“But the house elves!” Hermione begged as Professor Barnes came down. She turned to him and asked, “Professor do you support the enslavement of house elves?”
She dropped the spoon and ran a hand over her face. Luna finished her story and she told her, “I wish I had an answer but I don’t. I wish you could just go to the ball with her and have nothing bad happen. That’s the way it should be but people want to be stupid.” She sighed heavily and stood up for a bit. She looked at Luna and told her, “if you two go together then I’ll support you two. That means I’ll fight with whoever talks bad about you.”
She found Luna waiting for her in their dormitories. Arlene told her first, “I’m sorry. Are you okay?”
Double doors set into the side of the Great Hall led into it. All through the day decorations were being added to the hall. The doors to the ballroom remained closed.
This thought intruded upon an otherwise boring history of magic lesson. History of magic was supposed to be one of the most interesting subjects. Learning the history of the thing that pulled her from poverty and abuse should’ve been super interesting. Especially to her since her family was doused in mysterious history. The thing was that history of magic was taught by the only thing in the entire universe that could possibly make it boring. The entire history of all things magical and beautiful was taught by someone who had quite literally bored himself to death. Who was so plain and boring that he died and didn’t even realize it. He seemed determined to do the same to literally every other creature in the universe.
Arlene relented, “alright. I’m looking forward to it Hagrid.” They made small talk for another hour or so. Arlene drank three more butterbeers. After some time Hagrid got up and told them he was going to stretch his legs for a while.
The three of them left two hours before the ball was supposed to start to get ready. She put on her blue dress. Luna helped her put her hair in a thick braid down her back. Luna put on a frilly, yellow dress and had her hair done in a half up half down style. She had a bun on the back of her head but with half her hair still coming down her back. Luna also put two small sunflowers in her hair.
“Which is good for us,” Adrian told them. “The eyes of the magical world will be on a school event instead of on you. We do this in secret and we do it right.” He pointed to the ground to emphasize his point, “one detail goes wrong and we lose.”
Ginny went on, “you didn’t even want to enter a few days ago and now you’re all excited about it? You were supposed to flop out of the first trial and then not die in it.” She spread her hands and shook in indignation.
She knocked on Professor Flitwick’s office. He opened the door and looked up at her. “Miss Connery, how can I help you today?”
The boy from earlier yelled out, “Professor we need some new water. This one has loony in it now.” He along with his some of the other students laughed at Luna. Arlene scowled and helped Luna from the water trough.
Draco shoved his hands in his pockets to keep them out of sight. He had to swallow before asking, “um, Harry, there’s something I wanted to ask you. Can we speak alone for a minute?”
In the end the game had a surprising twist. Victor Krum, Bulgaria’s seeker, caught the snitch but the Irish had scored so much they had over a hundred and fifty point lead. The game ended on Bulgaria’s terms but the Irish won.
With that out of the way Arlene asked, “so what is it that she doesn’t like?” There was an air of conspiracy about them and she wasn’t sure what to make of it.
Luna dried the ink with a spell and rolled up the parchment. They went up to the owlery. She sent off the rolls with a letter explaining what they wanted. They would have to wait a few days to get a response from Luna’s dad.
Before she could ask what was going on Hermione blurted out, “I just want to say that I don’t like this but I think it’s for a good cause.” She crossed her arms and didn’t say anything else.
Ron made a point, “by ‘left’ he means threw it at his desk and called it words even I don’t feel like repeating. That’s closer to what really happened.”
Luna returned the smile and said, “hey, I like your clothes.” She shrugged and admitted, “then again, I like anything you wear.”
“Uh,” she was at a loss for words. Their more memorable meeting had been awkward at best. They had met when a crazed madman had kidnapped her. Adrian had caught up to him and broke his broom midair. By the combination of their magics they survived the fall and landed right in front of the Three Broomsticks. She had come out just in time for the madman to show back up. Adrian and him fought. It was close but Adrian won with the help of Arlene. She didn’t want to relive the whole experience right now so she decided to tell the abridged version.
It was the same writing. Adrian began saying, “I don’t see it. Are we in the right place?” She pulled on his sleeve and pointed to it. He followed her finger and saw it. “Oh, good job. Let’s go.”
They combed through books looking for anything pertaining to her specific family. It was a long search. True to Arlene’s prediction, Ireland had many families with the last name of Connery. It took some sorting to find the books that pertained to her specifically. They spent hours pouring over the books. Almost all of them were in English.
As the last rays of light disappeared behind the mountains they returned to the castle. Under the cover of darkness they kept holding hands. When they entered the torchlight they were reluctantly forced to separate. The social repercussions of being openly gay in this time would not be pleasant. They would have to hide it for now.
He could only nod and faced the entrance to the stadium. Professor Dumbledore put a comforting hand on his shoulder and said, “good luck Harry. Head on out.”
Joan nodded and knocked on the door to the hut. She ignored Grubbly-Plank’s complaints and yelled, “Hagrid, McGonagall said help us or I’m allowed to break down the door and make you help us.”
Sirius interrupted him, “alright, that I see a correlation with. He did look more snake-like.” He shook his head. “I don’t see how this helps us try to get answers out of him.”
A week before the final task Ginny brought a flyer to them in the corridor after class. Arlene and Luna had been heading to the library but Ginny stopped them with the flyer she had brought. She handed it to Arlene while telling her, “are you interested?”
He had the information he needed. “Thank you. See you soon. I have to get back to work now. They’ll get mad if I’m gone for too long.”
“Knocker?” Ginny was confused as the picture asked her for a password. She told it, “Fortuna major.” The picture swung open to reveal most of Gryffindor house surrounding Ron and Harry in a wild party. Ginny sighed and told them, “I’ll see you two tomorrow.” Then she started fighting her way through the crowd to get to her bed. The picture closed on that scene.
The fire stopped as he hands shook. Sweat formed on her forehead. She tried to swallow but her mouth was dry. She gritted her teeth and gathered her magic. With a scream she threw a fist of wind at the spider. It slammed into a front leg with enough force to break the exoskeleton. It screeched and limped backwards.
He smirked as he said, “well, none of Slytherin house arrived crashing into a tree which is monumental to the school’s history.”
They reached a new portkey that the Weasleys were all touching. Author waved them over and screamed, “Hurry! Only a few seconds left!” The three of them grabbed on to the old guitar case that served as the portkey. Mere seconds later they were whisked away.
She opened the door and found Professor Snape straightening his office with magic. He sneered at her, “what do you want?”
She didn’t fuss over them anymore but Krum came over and asked, “are you two in a relationship?” Victor Krum was an imposingly tall, buff man. Not to mention a professional athlete. His accent only added to this.
Arlene fell into the grass of the Quidditch pitch. For a second there was silence. Then horrible cheering filled the air around her. Tears of confusion and shock had begun to fall from her face. The cheering stopped when a heart broken scream rent the air, “NO!”
She was so frustrated she couldn’t think. This was the fifth hard riddle the knocker had given her that day. She rubbed at her head trying to think through her headache.
By the time the next morning came around word had gone through the entire school. Harry was claiming that Voldemort had returned. Ron Weasley was dead. Who believed what was still up for debate. The ministry had yet to release a statement on the matter. Professor Moody had left to go set up the fight against the death eaters.
They joined the Weasley family in the race for the portkey. It soon became obvious it wasn’t a party anymore as panic spread. The smell of smoke followed after it causing Arlene to choke as she ran. They kept well ahead of the fire even with all the commotion going around.
Joan took a seat. Arlene had taken a seat shortly after starting her explanation. Joan leaned forward and put her hands to her face in a thinking manner. She put her hands down. “I don’t know. I can’t believe they are going to let thirteen year old students fight dragons.”
Adrian yelled at him, “get back to the cup and get out of here!” He fired two spells at the attackers. Arlene and Ron had followed him over too. He grabbed Arlene by the shoulders and told her, “I need you out of here. Things are about to become dangerous. This isn’t part of the trial. Something has gone horribly wrong.”
He looked to Arlene and told her, “two of the books are just fifty Galleons to copy each. The third is a restricted book but we can keep it at the beach house without trouble. It costs five thousand to copy though. He didn’t know why it was so expensive.”
It twitched a hand in a gesture to come closer. He kept his wand raised but stepped towards it. He asked it, “are you Voldemort?” The thing nodded then weakly waved it’s arms in a pleading gesture of mercy. “I have no plans to kill you yet. I want answers. I want to know if those I care for are in danger.”
Loud pops sounded as the lobster-like creatures soared around the corner. They were flying in the air and landed in front of her. Screeches flew at her.
The Connery family might be the sole reason that life still exists on this little rock near this little star in this unimpressive galaxy. Others are afraid to write on the events of the war but not I! Thousands of years ago, before the written word, before wands. A lone wizard with a heart of evil and mind of intent came upon a dark being. An ancient evil that not even I, after decades of research, know the origins of. He opened himself to this darkness and allowed it to permeate him. He became god-like and an icon of evil.
Ginny wanted her friends to be happy and not have to hide who they were. She thought anyone who hated gays were full of it and should be shunned away. Not the other way around. Her spoon tapping wasn’t to fill the silence, it was out of restless anger.
Professor Snape sneered and responded while biting each word, “don’t lie to me.” He leaned in and went on, “I saw you run off with that Potter during dinner and you only return now? What were you up to?” His demeanor calmed as he raised an eyebrow. “Perhaps something to embarrass him?”
His blood ran cold. The thinking and logical part of his brain knew instantly they had been set up and duped. The emotional part of his brain became worried about the students and his daughter being here. He swiped his arm at them and ordered, “get out of here! Go now!” He knew the cup was a portkey but it was supposed to take them back to the entrance of the maze. Not to a graveyard. Someone had tampered with it. Someone who must’ve know what was going to happen here.
Dumbledore actually smiled and responded, “well, then, I guess I shouldn’t let anyone die then.” He actually chuckled and then added, “our new Defense against the dark arts teacher will be Alastor Moody, former auror. He’s not here right now because he is still in the process of separating from the ministry. He says there’s more paperwork then a dragon could burn.”
Arlene could tell he meant the hedges. “Hagrid what’s with the hedges? Why are they growing all over the field?” As soon as the question left her lips she figured it out.
All classes were cancelled. Ginny was hiding in her dorms. As were Harry and Hermione. Draco was out and about but it was like talking to a zombie. He was so numb that no one could have a conversation with him. Adrian and Joan were trying to help Arlene cope with what she saw. Luna was of course supportive of her.
The last three hours had been focused on mass producing sleeping potion. The standard cauldron was half a gallon. She needed two gallons. She had to make the potion four times and get it right every time.
She left her compartment of the tent and zipped it back up behind her. The common area had a small kitchen and dining area. Most of it was rustic as her guardians didn’t bring too many modern amenities when camping. The most modern thing was a cooler that had been enchanted to keep cool without ice in it. There was a table set up as a countertop and a basin for washing food next to it. All the food was to be cooked on a fire outside.
Bastion was still in reach of the beast as it lunged towards him. He ran as fast as he could but he just wasn’t fast enough. He turned to cast a spell at the dragon but didn’t get the chance. The dragon’s jaws closed on his leg.
She leaned forward in her chair. “Your average adult with a job in the wizarding world is given a uniform, pay, and benefits for a job. House elves can’t even wear clothes. Wizards and witches riot if their pay per hour goes slightly below what they like. House elves have to work longer hours with no pay at all. It is common and expected for house elves to be beaten for inadequate work. They are treated as inferiors while they work harder than the rest of us.”
He told her, “I decided to sleep in for one day. It’s good for the mental health.” He ate his lunch. He was in a good mood until he saw the Goblet of Fire. He knew that something was unnatural about it. It wasn’t just a goblet with some spells cast on it. There was something wrong about it. He had a suspicion on what it was.
He opened his mouth to speak but nothing came out. He managed to say, “I just asked Hermione to the ball but she said no. She said she had someone to go with already. I understand that but it is a little upsetting.”
He rolled his shoulders and let out a deep sigh. Barty Crouch knew nothing of spirit demons so he couldn’t understand that Dumbledore had just consumed the one that had been residing in the Goblet of Fire. A rather weak one but it still held power enough to help Dumbledore.
Ron shook his head and told her, “Hermione, we haven’t even started sleeping charms yet. Besides the first loud noise the crowd makes and it’ll wake right back up.”
He winced and ran away. They all noted that he did not have a partner. The Slytherin girl Malfoy was partnered with gave an impressed nod as to how he had handled the situation. They turned and headed back towards the dance floor. She couldn't help, but notice him glance at Harry.
Luna responded, “I think it’s a nice way to celebrate Christmas. I just wish that there wasn’t so much trouble with it. People always complicate nice things. I just want to be with my friends.” She looked at the ground with a sad expression.
Harry had to stand there for a minute with an angry dragon staring at him. Then he heard a swooshing. He glanced in the direction of it and saw his Firebolt coming towards him. He smiled, glad his spell had worked. It flew right into his hand and he took off instantly.
She told him, “I apologize, only those living locally can check out books. For a price you can receive a copy of the books you would like. Unless they are on the banned list.”
Ron tried to get them to tell him if he was okay but they didn’t stop. Which was a good thing he supposed. Better to get him to some medical care than worry about what his friend thought.
She knew that the Weasley’s were barely getting by even with their dad working a government job. She felt truly selfish now. She had enough money that ten thousand seemed like nothing to her. Yet to have all that and give none of it to her friend was the epitome of selfishness. She nodded, “okay, I’ll help you. I’ll help you win.” She knew it was about more than the money. She could give them ten thousand, hell, she could gift them twenty thousand and not even notice it. Getting Ron famous, getting him to be the next Triwizard champion would continue a steady influx of cash. Not to mention bring glory to the Weasley name. She nodded again and said louder, “I’ll help you win.”
Give back to the muggle communities and donate blood. Each donation will earn ten points to the student’s house and ten Galleons. Do some good and donate today.
Hagrid escorted the wining boy back to the castle as he called back, “get to your next class and don’t be late.”
She walked out into the sunlight with her boar. The massive black dragon looked at her. She expected a roar but it did not come. Instead the beast cocked it’s head at her and sniffed the air.
After Arlen and Luna finished their food Joan said to them, “we have to leave soon. Luna your father really wants to see you. We’ve reassured him that you’re fine but I’m sure he wants to see you.”
Author gave a fake smile and responded, “Lucius, always a joy to see you. No need to sell my house since I don’t spend all my money on hair products.”
He asked, “you know a spell that can stop a bullet?” Then he began walking in the direction of the bangs. More screams followed as he walked off to investigate.
She commented, “not what I was expecting.” This was less grandeur and more modern than she had seen coming. A simple shed that led to an elevator that anyone could get into didn’t seem like the way into the largest library in the world.
It dawned on Arlene what she did mean: sex. She flinched and explained with a fake giggle, “ah, I’m not quite ready for that. I mean I don’t even know how to do that with a girl.” Her face burned with embarrassment. She could feel it glowing red with her blush. “uh, maybe we should just go back to the dorms. I don’t feel like going to the room of requirement now.” She took Luna’s hands in her own. “Not that I’m upset at you.”
Luna cheerfully tried to lighten his mood with, “we are Neville. You don’t have to be sad anymore.” They sat down and she added, “why are you sad?”
Her heart beat picked up again. She had a strong feeling about what was going to happen. She closed her eyes and waited. A second later two soft hands took hers. Then two lips pressed against hers.
“Professor, I was curious, do you know of any magical libraries outside of the school’s?” Arlene didn’t know where he would lead her but he had never lead her wrong.
small, light sex scene, literally three paragraphs, it is marked with PAGE BREAK at beginning and end for those not interested. You will not miss any plot by skipping it.
The glow faded. She felt almost the same as she did before she performed the magic. Last year she wouldn’t even be able to perform that. Now she had done it easy with little preparation. She clenched her hands into fists with satisfaction. She was getting stronger with magic.
She hid her surprise and fear. She told her, “I think you need to find a way to fight a dragon.” She didn’t tell Arlene what she was thinking: that this was a horrible idea.
He saw her run ahead of him and pick up the jar. He tried to reach for his wand but couldn’t find his pocket or think of a spell humane enough to use on her. Unable to think of anything else to say he yelled, “two hundred points from Gryffindor!”
He slapped his desk and spat, “I didn’t push her away.” He realized he was talking to an empty room.
He responded with a wave, “you’re welcome. Meet me in the entrance hall.” He walked away as the door swung shut.
He opened the door holding a box. “What a coincidence, I have a gift for my daughter.” He handed Arlene the box. She reached into her pockets and pulled out a slim box. He took it so she could open her box. Adrian got another protection amulet. Arlene pulled a pair of gloves from hers. “Dragonhide gloves, can stop a knife blade so you can wear them during potions or herbology. They’re also resistant to most forms of magic.”
Barty smiled in a not-fully-sane manner. He nodded and the two of them left out the front door to search for Tom Riddle. Not to return him to Dumbledore’s control but to begin the war against the old madman. Both sides were right in saying that a war was coming but no one knew the truth of why yet.
The goblet flared one last time and Dumbledore grabbed it with ease and read out, “last but not least is the third champion from Hogwarts. Arlene Connery.”
“I mean have you noticed we swear like ten times more than all the others combined? I heard McGonagall do it the other day and I thought I was having a nightmare.” She felt his lips brush the top of her head and he went on, “I know what you mean. We’ve had hard lives. Most of our youth was spent learning to solve our problems with extreme violence. I think I’m still trying to unlearn that.”
Joan couldn’t describe why but that put a warm feeling in her heart. She had never wanted a family or to get married. She had accepted Adrian’s job offer because of the money and then decided she liked the kids. She didn’t say anything but they both got dressed and went back out into the wilds of Hogwarts on a Saturday.
The book went on to cover more history that she knew. She read on through things that she knew already. Then she came on something new:
He sprinted to Bastion. He lay on the ground awake and screaming in pain. Adrian pointed his wand at the leg to stop the bleeding. His stomach turned when he saw the leg was severed at the knee.
She got under her covers and closed her eyes. Sleep came fast. Even in this new city and under a strange roof she felt safe just a few feet from her father figure.
Joan told them, “Thank you. This is a relief to both of us.” Everyone in the family knew about Adrian’s past and didn’t want to put him through the stress of watching another child being in danger.
Dumbledore shook his head and said, “This is exactly what we need. Last year we had a dark year. This year we will bring up everyone’s spirits and bring the light back onto Hogwarts.”
That got him out. He opened the door and walked out. He had his crossbow and his pink umbrella. “Dragons?” He seemed ready but he asked them anyway.
That was the first time anyone had ever used the word ‘perchance’ on her. She shrugged it off. “My name is Arlene Connery and I have a favor to ask.”
He fell to the ground and the jar rolled away. He wasn’t paralyzed but he felt extremely confused. Almost like he was drunk. His vision was fuzzy around the edges. He asked, “did you just discombobulate me?” he couldn’t remember the charm that she might’ve used on him.
Madame Maxine blurted out, “for goodness sake, why is this stupid girl trying to pass up the chance of a lifetime?”
Arlene began pacing in the spot Draco had told her about. Three times she did this then a door appeared in the wall. She reached for the handle but hesitated before opening it. Luna asked another question, “how did you know this was here?”
Enraged, it charged at them. Ron, who was understandably afraid of normal sized spiders, flinched and screamed in absolute terror. Even Harry backed up with his eyes wide.
Arlene had little time to be amazed by her transformation. Professor McGonagall rushed over and asked, “oh, where is your date?” Arlene pointed to Luna. After a few seconds of confusion an understanding look crossed her face. “Oh, how very bold of you two.” She smiled. “I’m proud to see you two ladies leading the charge in change.”
He told her, “yeah, all the students are after Potter. The only ones who seem to be intent on keeping the peace are the two of us, McGonagall, Flitwick, and Moody. We’re fighting a losing battle with limited resources. Outnumbered and underpowered.” He rubbed her shoulder.
He asked Hagrid, “so how’s the inside of your hut? You’ve been in there for a while you must know it well.” He remained silent. Adrian wasn’t going to give that easy. “you know my daughter, Arlene, and her friends have been asking to see you again. They say they miss you. No matter how much they knock on your door you seem to ignore them.”
She nodded. What he had said was true but it didn’t kill her motivation. “I’ll find out sooner or later. There has to be something out there.”
For the next several minutes Author and Adrian cooked breakfast for their respective groups. Their meals were similar in almost every regard. Eggs, sausage, bacon, and warmed up muffins.
The magical community had no need for blood donations due to potions that could magically help injured people regrow blood faster. Muggles weren’t so lucky. Of all the things she had expected to see at this school this was the last.
What she was asking her to do didn’t make any sense. The mind couldn’t extend or enter another. It was a construct within the brain. Then again most magic didn’t make sense. She closed her eyes and focused on herself. She let out a breath and her mind exploded out.
She reached out with her mind like the time in the astronomy tower. She touched on the dragon’s mind instantly. She was calling out to her, “human friend? Human friend? Are you friendly human?”
Draco began the long walk outside. Out the Great Hall and into the entrance hall. Every step of the way he was reciting and questioning the words he had chosen. It was too hot in his robes. Every step down the hall sounded louder than it ever had before.
He sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose. Joan walked up to him and whispered in his ear, “let’s go to my room for a bit.” She didn’t need to inflect any tone or do anything physical to add to it. He knew what it meant. He stared at his fingers in thought then nodded and followed her.
Then he overheard that prophecy. The first thing he did was run and tell the Dark Lord like the good little servant he was. Only to find out later that it was Lily’s child it had been referring to. He begged the Dark Lord to spare Lily. His response was to laugh and say, “sure, I’ll do what I can.”
Adrian did it for him, “record of being an insane assassin? Wasn’t easy. The ten years of being in the monastery did help surprisingly. Especially when I started talking about spirit energy and stuff they didn’t understand.” He shrugged, “you talk about things they don’t understand and they seem to like it. I basically spent three weeks, every day for ten hours, convincing them that I was mentally incapable of harming a child.” He began walking out, “I’ve got to get back. I can only be gone for a few hours at a time. Professor McGonagall will get mad at me.”
Three of them searched through almost every book on dragons. They were joined halfway through the month by Hermione, Harry, and Ron. They had worked out their scepters as well and now worked on ways for Harry and Ron to get past dragons.
He was still confused. “Lily, I don’t understand. Please talk normally. Please tell me you love me.”
Screams of terror and pain came from the death eaters. The survivors fled towards the manor. Those not as lucky moaned and screamed as they were burned or blown apart.
They walked down to Hagrid’s hut. Grubbly-Plank was waiting outside the hut. When she saw them walking up she commented, “I only wanted you, Winters. We shouldn’t need Barnes.”
Her face betrayed her confusion for a second before she composed herself. Her Photographer wasn’t as smart. He actually began, “but we did-oof!” Skeeter elbowed him in the ribs.
Luna had wanted to see it last night so she had dug it out from deep within her trunk. Luckily it was still in there. Just for fun she began to tap it against the pile of wood for the fire. Nothing happened with it of course. She was still a squib as far as the rest of the world was concerned. No one except her closest friends knew she was any different.
They went back to the castle and to the common room. Luna had to ask to let them in. The knocker had been giving Arlene hard riddles all year so far and she didn’t feel like thinking too hard on it now. It was still early in the day. Most of the second and first years were on the grounds outside or in the library studying. They enjoyed the little time alone they could before going to bed early. Just sitting and talking with each other. They were both happy and content. Their lives were good.
“oh,” Arlene had forgotten to tell Ginny what she realized. Luna was distracted by the Weasley twins. “I’m in love with Luna.”
He blushed and responded, “oh, I was my pleasure. Thank you for asking me. If you hadn’t then I don’t think I would’ve come.” They went to bed shortly afterwards.
Adrian’s heart beat rapidly. Not out of fear for himself but out of fear for the students who had to face those monsters. Especially his daughter. “Adrian,” Joan breathed next to him. They looked at each other. He knew she was thinking the same thing as him.
Harry had neat yet modest dress robes. Krum was wearing dress robes that resembled a uniform. It fit him well and every detail had been paid attention to. Ron’s robes were…old fashioned. Hermione had undergone a massive change. She wore well applied make up, a beautiful dress, and had even put in fancy earrings.
He squeezed on the beetle until Skeeter burst out by turning back into human. She fell to the ground. Adrian pointed his wand at her and said, “that’ll be really interesting for the ministry to find out. That explains so much.” He smirked.
Rita Skeeter had been a low level journalist that no one knew about back when Joan and the others escaped the camp. Somehow she was one of the first to interview them. That was how the public came to distrust them and hate them for the first few years. Why they had to be assassins. Skeeter portrayed them as monstrous killers without conscious or honor. Not as children who had been robbed of their childhood and forced into a life they didn’t want.
“It’s the Death Eaters!” someone screamed loud enough for her to hear. Arlene looked back and got a glimpse of figures in robes and skull masks marching between the burning tents. She urged her legs to move despite the burning in her muscles. Luna tripped over and fell in a fit of coughing.
She was down with the crowd now waiting for Luna to show up. She ended up wearing jeans and a bright blue shirt with a thin, dark jacket over it. A chill had entered the air in the last week. A sign of the coming of fall.
Madam Pince showed up at that moment and scolded them in a whisper, “get out, you are being way too loud.” Ginny huffed but they got up and had to leave. It was almost dinner time they made their way to the Great Hall.
They were at breakfast when a letter was dropped in front of Arlene. There was no sender labeled on it. She picked it up and looked it over. She didn’t want to open it, something about the letter gave her a bad feeling.
Arlene realized the how monumental the task ahead was. “There’s going to be a ton of families named Connery from Ireland.” Knowing that staving it off would get them nowhere, she and Adrian got started.
Bastion used the distraction to grab the real golden egg. He wasted no time in running away from the chaos. Then something flashed and hit the dragon. It screamed in pain as the copies faded. Only Bastion was left as the dragon raged. Something from the outside had enraged it.
Professor Moody arrived and glared at the students. He said, “I know you’ve got a lot of detention already. You want me to take these two?”
Ginny was just happy to see that her friend wasn’t going to get ridiculed for something she couldn’t control. Also that this had just blown up in Skeeter’s face.
Arlene didn’t respond. She didn’t like just how devoted to the glory the girl behind her was. The headmaster and the two men from the ministry finished talking and Dumbledore announced, “there has been a major change in the rules after much deliberation. A review of the schools’ curriculums have found that some age groups may be more appropriate now than before.” He took a breath then let drop, “the minimum age to participate is now thirteen.”
Alaric snapped back, “yes, you can!” Bits of his headstone flew away as spells hit his cover. He blindly threw some spells at the death eaters. “This is no place for you two! Get back to the cup!”
The hall went silent as everyone waited to hear her answer. She shrugged and answered, “magic.” The hall roared in laughter.
Not sure of what to say she waved back to them and left the room in the most awkward way possible. She started walking backwards then to turn and walk out the right way. She then went to the library as she had planned.
There was a knock at the door. She looked up to see Luna standing there. Arlene asked, “you live here, why did you knock?”
Since they were in their dorm alone they did something they would normally never risk. Luna crawled into Arlene’s bed with her and they kissed while holding hands. The curtains were closed on her poster bed so no one could see them. They were still fully dressed. But lying next to each other and kissing over and over was soothing to her. They took a break and Luna whispered, “are you feeling better?” She nodded. They kissed a few more times. “You need sleep. Others will be here soon.”
That was why he was glaring at the goblet. He knew something possibly evil and definitely selfish was lurking in that thing.
Dumbledore nodded. “Yes but we will be taking precautions to ensure the safety of all students. The minister himself will be involved. Only students of legal age will be able to participate. That will negate the need for parental consent.”
They took their times undressing each other and kissing over each other. Joan pulled Adrian on top of her and let him satisfy their needs. It was several minutes of passion as their attractive bodies pressed and ground against each other. Low moans and whispers of pleasure filled the air. Adrian started slow until she came once. He started thrusting faster. After she came again she told him she had taken a potion of protection. It was a potion to protect against pregnancy. She demanded he finish in her. Ten seconds later he did.
The night of the third task arrived. First they had to do their finals. Arlene was exempt from them. She was waiting for Luna and Ginny to get out so they could talk before the last trial.
“Yes,” Lucius answered. “He told Barnes something then turned on us. I did not hear their conversation.” His breath was bated. His body stiff. Lucius was nervous.
Sirius and Remus were returning fire from behind headstones as the figures came towards them. Adrian took cover behind the tall headstone. Harry called out, “Sirius, what are you doing here?”
She asked him, “has this week been a nightmare for you too?” She made circles on his chest with her finger.
Ron slapped his hands to the desk and said, “Hagrid, he wants to raise one he has to know how to calm it or something.” He looked at their expressions of doubt. They all knew Hagrid wanted a dragon but they didn’t think he would know how to calm one. It was better than anything they had found yet. He tried to explain, “I think we should at least try it. Rather than do nothing.”
He didn’t stop brushing his teeth. He had already thought on this over the summer and knew his answer. He spat out some foam and said, “it’s been thirteen years almost and I finally realized I need to grow up and move on. My family would want me to be happy.” He brushed some more and spat into the sink. “I guess part of that is getting into a relationship. I’m still young enough to date.” He rinsed his mouth out and put down his brush. “Are you asking because you want to be in a relationship with me?”
The song went on for several minutes with Luna humming it under her breath as they danced. When the song ended they moved to the buffet tables. She had enjoyed the dance but being out in front of so many people, lesbian or not, had made her nervous.
He nodded. “Not my best idea by far.” He slowly approached Arlene and sat next to her on a chair. “Arlene, I want you to understand why I got so upset about you being in this tournament.” He swallowed as he searched for words.
She received various forms of positive assurance that the house elves were fine. A large boar was wheeled out. Dobby was there to explain, “the boar has a charm that will keep it fresh until the night after the second trial.” Arlene proceeded to pour all her sleeping potions in the mouth. As the house elves sew it shut she realized just how big it was. The hog was bigger than she was. Would it be too big for the dragon? She brushed the idea away. She had no time left to worry. The trial was tomorrow. This was the only plan she had. It was this or nothing.
Ginny danced with Neville several more times than she had planned. To everyone’s surprise he was actually an excellent dancer. This was surprising for many reasons. Neville had always been considered one of the clumsiest students at Hogwarts. He had no balance, no proper posture and no coordination. Ever since his first day at Hogwarts he had been the embarrassing one or the brunt of most jokes.
The Ravenclaw boy who had pushed Ginny into the bicorns water trough at the beginning of the year rudely walked up and said, “hey, any of you girls need a real man to take you to the Yule ball?”
Arlene told him everything she had found out. That dragons were involved in the next trial. That despite all the research she had done she had found nothing to help her. About ten minutes went by as she talked. Joan walked in just as she had finished. The two of them gave her the rundown of it.
Luna suggested, “maybe you should lay low until you can talk to them.” Arlene liked that idea. She nodded in agreement as Luna told her, “if the ministry wants to get involved then you’ll have to play by their rules for a while.”
Dumbledore had started talking again. “With this will come the greatest prize of all. Eternal glory, forever being renowned as the winner of the tournament that restored the name of the Triwizard tournament to its full glory.” He spread his arms as students clapped and cheered. “Now off to bed all of you. It will be an exciting day tomorrow.”
They sat next to them and Harry said, “Ginny, Draco and I need to tell you something.” He looked at Luna and said, “you too, Luna.” He leaned in towards them and whispered, “Draco and I are in a relationship.”
They went to the nearest empty classroom. Once they closed the door Ginny told them, “this is hard to swallow so I’ll explain it as best as I can.” She told them about the agreement between her family and Dumbledore. When she had gotten deathly sick but her family couldn’t afford the treatment. Dumbledore had offered to cover it if they agreed to enter Ginny into a marriage contract with Harry Potter. Then Ginny told them that she didn’t love Harry. It was all an act.
Professor McGonagall was yelling across the hall, “get in line, be orderly!” The assembly was already moving outside. They stood outside and got lined up. Then the waiting began. The weather outside was nice at least. They had to stand outside for a while.
“I get that.” He pulled a lighter from his pocket. “This is much more efficient though.” He flipped it open and lit it. “Completely muggle and an improvement over matches.”
Harry left to go find Draco. Ginny couldn’t exactly cheer about her sudden revelation. Luna wasn’t in the mood for that. She was still trying to figure out what to do about the ball. Ginny wanted to help her and blow off some of her newfound energy. She suggested, “Luna, do you want to take a walk around the lake with me?”
So it was settled. The next day after working for hours on their homework they ate lunch and gave blood. The line was shorter than expected. They all had to fill out questionnaires before donating. Chairs were brought out and several of the staff were drawing blood. They put their wands to a vein, whispered a spell, blood flowed into a tube that led to a bag. No actual incision was necessary and the process was clean.
Arlene threw her arms out in disbelief and said, “all the Gryffindors have to do is remember a password? They don’t need to figure out a riddle just to get to bed?” She set her arms down and shook her head. “Why Rowena? Why do you hate your students?”
The tent was silent. Everyone was too nervous to make small talk. Even the champions who had been cocky before were now silent with nerves. Soon the moment of truth would be on them. Arlene sat on a bench and held her useless wand with no idea what she was going to do.
Ludo Bagman and Mr. Crouch came forward. Mr. Bagman exclaimed, “I never expected anyone to get past the trolls that way.”
George held out a box of badges. She took a close look at them and saw the ones for her actually read, “Connery is the queen!” The ones for Harry were the same but the ones for Ron read, “Weasley is sleezy!”
Surprised, Adrian told them, “that’s more information than I was expecting. I have a real name to work with. I can track that.”
Arlene cocked her head to the side and said, “of course. You’re one of my best friends. Why is this a question?” She couldn’t understand why Luna would think they wouldn’t hang out there. It seemed ridiculous to her that she wouldn’t be with Luna.
Dumbledore straightened up and he held in his hands an ornate goblet. He set it on the podium and stared at it. Every eye in the room was fixated on it. Arlene still felt nervous about it for some reason. Then fire burst into existence.
Arlene felt her eyes on her but she just kept looking at her food. After lunch she had two free periods so she went to the hospital wing. She didn’t know why. For some reason she felt like it was important for her to go see what had happened. It might have something to do with her being in the tournament that led to so much pain. It might’ve been guilt at coming out unscathed when others had been gravely injured.
Mr. Bagman told the room, “there is nothing to sort out. She will participate just like any other student. How her name got in the goblet is not an issue. It was likely a small prank gone wrong.” He turned to the champions and went on, “you will receive information on where the first tournament will take place with the rest of the schools. Be prepared for anything. You won’t know the details of the first tournament until the day of. Good luck.” He gave them all two thumbs up them walked out. The rest of the champions followed suit.
The game commenced. It soon became obvious that Ireland’s seekers outclassed Bulgaria’s. The game was fast and vicious. The players were blurs they were so fast. The announcer could only say the player’s name as they passed the Quaffle around.
The sun rose over a field of tents. Warmth flooded the grass and removed the dew from the grass. A massive stadium rose in the background. It was taller than any other stadium in the world. The early risers were up in front of their tents. Using magic fires to cook breakfast or simply conjuring it. Two tents contradicted one another. One was shabby and heavily used. It had been poorly set up. Several patch jobs had been done on it. The other was new and had been set up well. It had zippers and a rain cover.
He felt his face burn and put his quill away. “Yup, let’s go.” He got up from his desk. On his way out the door he felt something hit his rear. “Ah!” He whirled to see Joan giving him a cheeky grin. She blew him a kiss and led the way down the corridor.
Dumbledore announced, “ah, our new Defense against the dart arts teacher has arrived. Please welcome Professor Moody to our school.” There was some clapping but most of the hall was silent. Professor Moody reached the table and sat down. He took a swig from a flask. Judging from his reaction it was something gross in the flask. Dumbledore repeated, “Everyone off to bed now.”
Arlene glanced at her and said, “Luna, I don’t think you could judge someone negatively if you wanted to.” She leaned against the fence and trusted Luna with her secret. “I think I would prefer a girlfriend. I’ve just never been attracted to boys. Some girls or women I like.” It felt good to say. She hadn’t been entirely sure until recently. Letting it out for the person she loved was good to say. Luna still didn’t know who Arlene loved but at least she knew that Arlene wasn’t straight.
There was a different spirit demon in that goblet. He had a feeling it was a weaker kind. He couldn’t know for sure. He had purged Abaddon from his mind in the monastery so he couldn’t ask for his advice. Not that he wanted to. He had only ever used that power on fighting Michael but the demon remained with him for years. Until the monks of the monastery helped him purge it from his body and mind. It was his secret that he had only ever told the monks. Not even the others at the camp knew. He didn’t want to go around telling people that he had made a deal with a demon.
Arlene wasted no time and made the next two jumps. Then she made her last jump and reached for the wall. She poured extra strength into her fingers and latched on with a solid grip. Her feet skidded but found purchase in under a second. “Connery is the second to reach the wall! Followed by Krum and Weasley!”
Thirty of them had descended on the graveyard. There were three who were for sure against them, one who was being confusing, and three students who shouldn’t have been there at all. Adrian threw himself into beating back the death eaters. He let go of his inhibitions against killing. His mind went back to the way of the fighter.
He threw out some smoke bombs and stink bombs. Then he threw out several chattering teeth that had been enchanted to run from anyone chasing them.
After the meeting they left the conference room and met up in the room at the top of the astronomy tower. The two of them sat on the tiers leading up to the window. He was considering all the horrible things that might happen to him this year. He had even been confident enough to leave his muggle firearms at home. Now he had learned that there was going to be a potentially deadly tournament happening involving the students. He wondered if any learning would ever happen at Hogwarts.
She nodded. “After the last two years I was expecting something quiet this year. It shouldn’t effect either of us at all. Neither of us are even old enough to get in.” She grabbed Luna’s hand under the table. “I’ve got my treasure already. Not to mention more money than I could ever spend.”
Mrs. Weasley removed the letters and began handing them out to everyone. Even Arlene, Luna, Harry, and Hermione got their Hogwarts letters. Dumbledore seemed to be excellent at tracking people. Arlene didn’t like that fact.
They reached Professor Sprout’s office, the boy was in Hufflepuff, and she told him, “I don’t know and I honestly don’t care. You’re smart enough to know you can’t throw curses down the hallway.” They found Professor Sprout trimming a plant on her desk. Joan explained, “he got into a fight with Potter. I’ve already got my plate full of detention. Can you talk to him or something, please?”
After a length of time passed that cannot be measured the two of them composed themselves and returned to the castle.
He answered, “be better if I hadn’t spent the last few days wrangling wild dragons. Especially nesting mothers.” He drew his wand and stood in front of them.
He held up a bag and said, “now, each one of you will pull a card from this bag to figure out which dragon you will be facing. It also determines the order of you going.” He held out the bag to Ron. He reached in a pulled out a card with a green dragon on it. “The Welsh Green,” Mr. Bagman told him.
What Barty did understand was that he had just seen something intimidating. As a Dumbledore who looked fifty years younger now stood before him. He didn’t even think it was possible to literally drink from the Goblet of Fire. He hid his surprise well. He had hidden many things from people over the years.
Arlene and Luna were roaming the halls with no real destination. There they saw a bob of red hair coming towards them. Arlene felt a shot of happiness fire through her. Before Ginny could speak she pulled her into a tight hug. Ginny hugged her back but gasped, “I love you too Arlene but you’re crushing me.”
Adrian nodded and they went inside. They both sat at a circular dining table. He pulled out a large book. It was old and damaged. Adrian explained, “This book details the history of the dark wizard who claims to have invented the Horcrux.” He opened it to a set tab and read, “When we lay the killing curse on Gregory his body became as dust. The apparition of a face fled, screaming, from the scene.” He looked to Sirius and asked, “No one ever found Voldemort’s body? Almost as if it turned to dust?”
She told him, “she’s doing great. Her confidence is making a comeback. She’s very protective of me and Luna.” She put a finger on her chin and added, “she loves the bat bogey hex.”
Hermione suggested, “We could try a sleeping charm on it? It’ll take a while to work on a dragon but it is something.”
They had to change into their robes then. Arlene was just finishing when the train screeched to a halt. Grabbing their luggage they headed to the carriages. They ran through the rain to find one. The three of them clambered in one and it drove them towards the castle. The rain was so thick it was hard to tell but she thought she saw something in front of the carriage. She had been in such a rush to get in it she didn’t acknowledge it.
Ginny put her head in her hands. Such a simple thing had become stressful due to the intolerance of people who couldn’t stand to see the truth. If only people would open their minds then none of this would even be an issue.
“Yeah, today feels like a rest day but maybe save the drinking for later. I’d like to have a clear head for the first half of the day at least.” He stood up and stretched.
Adrian said, “I’m glad you two were brave enough to come out like this. It is cool.” He pointed to the open doors and added, “there’s decorations outside too if you want to see them.”
They walked up to the desk while Arlene gawked at everything. Adrian spoke in Arabic to the librarian. She heard her surname in the conversation so he was likely asking about information for her. Which is why they went there.
He flicked his wand at the quidditch field and said, “accio broom.” Then he answered her, “a mix of apparation and flying. I’ll apparate us to Giza then we will fly to Alexandria.” He pointed his wand at her suitcase and asked, “mind if I shrink it so it’s easier to carry?” She nodded and he tapped her suitcase with his wand. It shrank to pocket size and she put it away.
She had a point. Arlene packed for five days and hugged Luna. She hugged her back and told her, “I’ll come down and ask how long you’ll be gone.” The two of them went down to the entrance hall and found Adrian there. Luna spoke to him first, “hello Professor, I was wondering how long the two of you will be gone.”
Adrian laughed and got serious, “there’s my blood. As of right now I’m an enemy of Voldemort and I will remain so until he convinces me to not be one.”
A monstrous spider was crawling along the top of the hedges. All eight of its eyes were locked on her. It began moving down the wall at her. Her hands flew up and gold fire shot from them. She focused it enough so it didn’t set the hedges ablaze. The fire struck the spider but it dissipated away. The exterior shell was too strong to be lit on fire. The monster hit the ground and loomed over her.
He jumped the rail by the front row as the dragon tamers rained stunning spells on the dragon. The dragon jerked and squirmed. Bastion was lifted in the air and sent flying. The dragon’s tail rose to the front row as its head fell. He heard more screams as the tail raked across the front row.
He rubbed at his chin and said, “not really. We need to get back tomorrow. I’m also really tired for today.” He gestured for her to follow and walked towards the exit elevator.
Arlene didn’t want the ten thousand Galleons. She had no need for money. She knew that would motivate many of the students. There were many wizarding families who could use the money. There were a lot of students who would do risky things for that money.
Arlene was trying to think of elements that she could use that would hurt a dragon but not the audience. Not much sprang to mind. Not much that she could use easily. Most of it was the fact that she could only carry a pocket full of it. Not even that much phosphorus would blind a dragon for long. Especially if she was alone.
He sighed and said, “I don’t know. I can’t think right now.” His voice wavered. “Joan, a student died when I was supposed to protect them. Ron Weasley died right in front of me.” He shook his head. “All because I thought I was good enough to save the world.”
They did leave to go outside and see the outside decorations. On their way out the door they almost ran into Rita Skeeter but she was intercepted by Adrian. He zoomed past them and got into her face while saying, “no, turn your lying ass around and get off my school grounds.” The photographer tried to take a picture of him but he snatched the camera away and slammed it to the ground. It shattered into pieces and he spat at the creepy man, “bill me.” Rita turned around and ran from him.
Ginny had to appreciate her boldness but Luna and her followed Arlene to the Great Hall. She watched as Arlene walked up to the doorway and stood there with her arms crossed.
Harry’s tear filled eyes stared at him in confusion. Joan pushed him off Harry and ran over to Arlene. She gently lifted her to her feet and escorted her out of the area. Joan asked her, “Arlene, if you can tell me what happened then I might be able to help. I’ll understand if you can’t talk about it.”
True to her word something was spotted moving over the forbidden forest. Students began pointing it out. Ginny said, “finally, about time.”
This part need more than speed or brawn. Some of the champions were throwing spells at the trolls but their thick skin made them useless. In thought she glanced at a rock. In the back of her mind she noted it seemed loaded with a specific element. She moved closer and rubbed her hands on it. It was grey but with streaks of silvery white. It had a slight hexagonal shape to it. She had a strong suspicion that she was looking at a big deposit of magnesium. Or at least it in its natural version. If she purified it and set fire to it then it would blind the trolls easily.
Adrian said in a deadly quiet voice, “over my dead body she will” He heard Joan trying to calm him but he vaulted the table and walked over to the headmaster. “Well? How devoted are you to your rules? Will you murder a man for your precious little game?”
Not wanting her to be upset, Ginny put a reassuring hand on her shoulder and told her, “It’s okay, we’ll have a good time no matter what happens.” She didn’t know how. “I’ll make sure of it.” She wasn’t sure if she could actually make that happen.
“This leads into my next point that the ownership of slaves and widespread use of them is an economic choice. The ministry would rather use slave labor than admit the rights of beings they see as lesser than them are important. This means the ministry places financial gain over living beings.”
Arlene pushed her cart through the barrier to platform nine and three quarters. She emerged onto the platform to see the beautiful, shining, red steam engine warming up for departure. She loved the sight of it. She rolled her cart towards the crowd as Remus Lupin and the other kids from the beach house entered the platform.
It spanned his whole desk. It showed the color of the land and the ocean. The whole image showed incredible realism. Even the clouds were shown in real time. At least if appeared so. The clouds over the northern half of the United Kingdom were smaller versions of what she was seeing out the window.
Barty left the room faster than he normally would have. He went over to the fireplace and used it to Floo his way back home.
Dumbledore waved a wand at the ceiling and made thunder crack. “The rules are final. Arlene Connery will participate in this trial.”
She let go of Ginny only for Luna to pull her into another rib breaking hug. Ginny gasped but hugged her back. When Ginny was released she sucked in some air then told them, “I have something important to talk to you guys about. We need somewhere private.”
She had gone pale and her breathing increased. After what they had just witnessed neither Bastion nor Arlene blamed her for being scared. Still she put on a brave face and went out.
Harry extended a hand and said, “take a seat.” Arlene sat down. “Would you agree that you and I are well off financially?” She nodded. “Good. Ron and his family aren’t as we all know. We have a plan to fix that.” Harry extended his hand at Hermione, who squirmed uncomfortably. “Hermione managed to convince Professor McGonagall to let her read up on previous years’ Triwizard tournaments which were hidden away in the restricted section but we fixed that.” Hermione had turned beet red and hid her face. Harry went on, “we now know the details of the coming tournament. Unfortunately the trials differ every year so we can’t predict those.”
The school left the room. Luna whispered to Arlene, “Professor Moody used to be an Auror, wizard cop. He was really famous for catching most of the death eaters out there. Also my father says he can use his fake eye to see wrackspurts.”
She took one from the tin. “Thank you again Professor.” She left the office and was left to ponder her decision.
Joan pulled her into a hug and gripped her tightly. They were standing by the doors to the entrance hall. For a long time they stood there. Joan let Arlene cry on her shoulder.
Luna sighed and answered, “to be honest I don’t feel like teaching right now. Besides it’s more of a thing between my dad and me. If you want to do the dance we did before then I’m willing.” She shook her head and they stayed by the snack table.
Arlene wore a smile on her face as she left the classroom. Luna caught up to her and they gripped hands quickly. The two of them went downstairs and met Ginny when they reached the entrance hall. They didn’t even get a chance to talk before Hermione charged at them with a box of buttons saying, “Did you know that all our food is being cooked by slave labor? Under paid and abused house elves are being used by Hogwarts.”
She held up a copy of the Quibbler. “I want your dad’s magazine to feature an article on the oppression of House Elves.” She made a face at it. “I don’t quite agree with most of the articles he does.” Her gaze focused back to Luna. “You’re my last resort though. No other newspaper or magazine will take me seriously.”
A pair of hands slid around her ears. She looked to see that Luna had covered her ears. She smiled at her. The dance finished and Luna let Arlene hear again.
He didn’t answer for a minute. The only sound was the crunch of the snow. He told her, “the things I want can’t be found in a book.” He was silent for a few moments before saying, “I just want to protect my kids and my students. I want my life to be relaxed. Eventually, I want to retire and sit on my beach all day without a care. Just happy that I’ve done everything I can to make the people I love and care about happy and safe.” He looked at her and apologized, “sorry, the wants and fears of adults are usually more concepts than physical things. The result of things getting more complicated.” She stopped in her tracks. He stopped almost immediately and asked, “what’s wrong?”
Arlene didn’t even attempt to hide her amazement. “That’s amazing.” She looked up to see Adrian smiling at her.
Mr. Bagman told them, “Welcome everyone, welcome. We are almost ready to begin. We just need one more thing to make the event a little more interesting.” Arlene’s already high nerves took a spike as random jets of fire spurted from the field. They went away then more jets of fire spurted from different areas. Mr. Bagman actually laughed as he said, “these flames aren’t hot enough to deal real damage but they will be hot and keep the champions on their toes. Now let the trial begin!”
She had an entire tray of potions next to his table. She was making him drink every single one. He would need all of them.
He didn’t take off the cloak until he was right by the exit to the stadium. Most of the creations had stopped or been crushed by now. The dragon roared with rage.
Luna giggled. Arlene opened her eyes slowly to look on her love. The girl she loved. The girl who loved her back.
Madam Rosmerta came by then. Before she started taking their orders she asked Arlene, “how are you doing? Staying out of trouble?”
The smile sprung to her face without control. She was free. There was no way to fulfill her end of the contract that her family had made with Dumbledore. The contract that she had no part in. She was free from it now. Harry was gay and nothing she did could change that. The idea of rubbing that in the old fucker’s face made her even happier.
Two minutes later Professor Dumbledore approached them and said, “I have full faith in you three.” His eyes were firmly on Harry. “Good luck. Make us all proud.” He walked away. Mr. Bagman came up and let Harry in first. Ron was next. A minute after Ron went in Arlene was allowed to enter the maze.
They stopped in the entrance hall and he told her, “anywhere. Professor Winters is going to start at the astronomy tower and work her way to the Ravenclaw common room. I’m going down to the dungeons and working my way up. I suggest all the girl’s bathrooms in between. I can’t go in those.”
He moved around a tall gravestone to see the last thing he expected: Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Arlene Connery sitting around the Triwizard cup.
Luna looked up and put a finger to her chin. She looked cute when she was thinking like that. “Maybe but I’d like to think not. He’ll be nervous but I don’t think that will slow him down for long. The first few lessons might be slow. Soon he will get his confidence back.” She smiled at Arlene.
All eleven Bastions ran forward. The dragon roared at all of them but didn’t attack. Adrian kept his eyes on the real Bastion. Even for him it wasn’t easy. He was being smart about it. He let the copies rush the dragon as he moved to the side in an attempt to get the egg. He cast the spell again and copies of the eggs fell from the nest and rolled across the arena.
She had no idea if they were trying to be funny or not. She simply did what most people would do and stared at them with wide eyes in surprise.
“Good.” Dumbledore sat down. “I did so much here to make sure the right people were at the graveyard tonight. I had to put the imperius curse on Victor Krum and have him attack Miss Delacour. I tried to get the last of the Connery line out of the way but she managed to survive somehow.” He stroked his beard. “You are excused. Good work. Without you getting someone to spy on Mr. Barnes I would’ve never been able to crash his party. I did lose Mr. Weasley in the process. It will fuel Harry more so I can use it to my advantage.” Lucius nodded and left the room. Dumbledore motioned to him and said, “you can come out now.”
His glare wasn’t the one he wore when planning murder. This was a much toned down version. He seemed to just be mildly angry over it. She tried to explain but Joan interrupted with, “Arlene, that was pure genius. I can’t even do alchemy that cool!” Then her face went to a mild glare and she asked, “so care to explain the coming in first thing?”
When Dumbledore stood up Luna grabbed Arlene’s hand under the table. The headmaster spoke to the hall, “Today is a sorrowful day. We have lost far too much this year. Ron Weasley’s death was a tragedy. A tragedy I feel you should all know the truth of. The ministry is saying that Mr. Weasley’s death was an accident. That is a lie. Ron Weasley was murdered by Lord Voldemort.” Murmurs that died quickly flowed through the room. “We must all prepare ourselves for the coming months. They will be challenging times. Times where we must support our friends and family.”
She smiled back and said, “well, if they’re dead already and it’s just the father’s name then I guess it can’t hurt.” She went back for a few seconds. She came back and told him, “we only had one Tom Riddle with a muggle father by the name of the same name. Tom Riddle sr.”
“Excited for the new year?” Joan shocked him from his reverie. He looked to see her looking at him. She had a familiar look in her eye.
He looked out the small window and said, “do you want to know what happened last night?” She nodded. He must’ve seen it out the corner of his eye. “the followers of He-who-must-not-be-named attacked last night. Just because we hired muggles to work with us.” He took a sip of coffee. “Most of them were arrested or…killed. The chaos is over. The ministry is in a panic.” He finally looked at her and said, “it’ll calm down though. People are just scared because they haven’t seen anything like this in years. I have to go back to work in a few minutes because of it. It’ll blow over by the end of the week.”
Arlene rolled her eyes and pulled out the scepter from the first trial. It was different now. She showed it to Ginny. At the top was no longer an orb but a mini statue of a dragon guarding an egg. She explained, “the judges said the scepter is the clue to the second trial. There’s a dragon at the top of the scepter. What do you think Ginny?”
Now there was only one person who she was trying to impress and that was Luna Lovegood. The main problem was that Luna was the least likely person to judge anyone on what they wore. It was a good thing but it also meant that she was nearly impossible to impress with dressing up. It was impossible to know what she would like. In the back her mind her rational self was telling her to just grab something and stop worrying. Listening to rational and sense is not something that people in love do often.
The house elves finished with the boar. She held her wand but used her own magic to lift the boar. She levitated it to her dormitories and put a sheet over it. She had already talked about it to her dorm members and they didn’t mind. They were smart enough to know that it wouldn’t smell. Bugs also couldn’t get into the dorms or common rooms of Hogwarts.
Adrian wasn’t so sure about that. “Maybe but there are ways to get rid of him without him ever seeing me.” He explained, “he can be eliminated with a muggle sniper rifle from a quarter a mile away and die before he even hears the shot fired. Wouldn’t trust poison. I think I would prefer sniping him. One shot for my last assassination.”
That made Arlene feel better but she was still ready to go. They went back behind the stone building and he turned them invisible. They got on his broom. Adrian had the common sense to charm a seat for both of them so they would be comfortable. He took off and rose high in the air.
For the whole month of January Arlene and her friends spent every moment not in class, on homework, sleeping or eating on finding ways for Arlene to defeat a dragon. Yet despite all their efforts nothing was coming up. Arlene’s inability to use a wand was hindering her greatly as most methods involved using a wand.
He began telling them how to approach them. They could charge if easily startled. The fence was strong enough to hold them back so there was no danger to the students. A slow, quiet approach while in full visual view was enough to keep them calm. Hagrid got them some hay to feed to them and showed them how to change the water in their troughs.
She turned and grabbed the scepter she had been after. Other champions smart enough to capitalize on the situation began to grab their scepters. Harry and Ron got one each. Fleur and Krum each grabbed one. Jules Bastion of Beauxbatons was the last to grab a scepter.
She reached the room and tried to open the door. It was locked she waved her wand at it and opened it. She opened it to find Arlene and the rest of the champions standing in an unused classroom. An odd looking man with a camera walked up to her and began to raise his camera. She set her wand on it and gave him a deadly glare.
She pulled her hand away and started walking towards the backroom. She felt every eye in the room on her. Part of her wished Adrian had fought harder against this. At the same time she knew he shouldn’t make outbursts like that. She passed by Professor Karkaroff who didn’t even acknowledge her.
Magnificent, mahogany desks filled with finely dressed librarians behind them were among the first things she saw. Behind them were pillars of marble the supported multiple floors. The area they had stepped off in rose though multiple levels to end with a massive chandelier hanging from the ceiling. Gold railing gave protection in between the marble columns.
It was only then that he noticed Arlene had something levitating next to her. It was long and hidden under a tarp. She was levitating it by magic though. He asked her, “how are you levitating it without magic?”
Yeah Ginny, really? She wasn’t sure what made her say that. She had no intention of saying that. There was no turning back now. She had been planning on going anyway and why not go with someone instead of by herself? “Yes, really. Now tell me.”
She watched Adrian walk out of the hall. Feeling defeated she walked forward and took the slip of paper from Dumbledore. Her name was on there. She pointed out, “this isn’t my handwriting.”
He aimed his wand at the snake who retreated to the other side of the room in a carefree manner. He walked to see if anything was in the chair then inhaled sharply when he did see what was in it.
Arlene couldn’t respond at first. After a few seconds she was able to say, “it worked. It really worked.”
It did help that neither Ginny nor Luna thought any different of her. Ginny had been getting in trouble for starting fights to protect her name. She always told Ginny it wasn’t necessary but Ginny couldn’t stand people being mean to her friends.
George got enough control to say, “classic, going in the Weasley hall of fame that is.” They high fived and left.
He turned to them as the crowd cheered. His voice returned to normal as he spoke, “Alright, Krum and Delacour will enter first since their schools are at a disadvantage. Next you three will be staggered in. Good luck everyone. We will be watching so if you get into trouble then someone will be along to help you soon.” Ludo Bagman left them. Madam Maxine and Professor Karkaroff were talking to their champions. With pats on the backs and quiet words of encouragement they sent them into the maze.
I just need to say that I mean no offense to anyone by writing this chapter. If I did something wrong or offensive by accident please let me know so I can fix it. As always I am open to feedback and constructive criticism.
McGonagall asked an important question, “Professor, haven’t students died in the past from that tournament? Which is why it was cancelled?”
“Ever since that day I saw you in that robe shop. I felt something. Like you were important to me.” He fumbled around trying to find the right words. “I’ve never wanted to be with a girl. I’ve always preferred boys. I can’t come out to the public like that. If my dad ever found out…” He had to stop. The idea of how his father would react scared him. His father was so old fashioned and carried a deep sense of hatred for anything that didn’t fit into his idea of a perfect life. Before Harry could stop him he blurted out, “I love you Harry. I didn’t know how to show it back then. I was young and scared. I’ll understand if you don’t feel the same. I needed to let you know. I couldn’t hold it in any longer.”
After Herbology Arlene couldn’t stay with Luna. Before she departed for the Astronomy tower she asked her, “will you be okay?”
Instead he mulled over his life decisions. Anytime someone got close to Lily he hated them. Her sister, Potter, her school friends. Why did he hate them? He knew the answer: he saw them all as competition for him. Which wasn’t a good reason in all honesty.
Arlene began weighing the pros and cons of each potion in front of her. She also included her ability to brew them. Over half of them she hadn’t even heard of. She had always been good at potions. Not as good as she was at alchemy but still well above average.
Arlene put the final stir in her potion. It turned the right shade and she set her spoon aside with relief. Five hours she had been working. The first potion, Felix Felicis had been complex but she had managed it. To say that Professor Snape was impressed was an understatement. It was more like he was shocked into silence.
Ginny reeled back slightly. She didn’t know what to say. Then all the pieces came together and it actually made sense. “I can see that. I guess you two want to go to the ball together but don’t want to piss off all the assholes here?”
Ginny responded, “yeah, I want to do this too.” She looked to Arlene. Arlene smiled as she agreed to it.
Severus was confused. He blinked as he sputtered, “What-I don’t understand. I protect-I do protect him. Lily, what matters is that we’re here together. Please tell me you’ve changed your mind.”
She pulled out her potions. She drank half of both and then handed the rest to Jules Bastion. He looked at her funny until she said, “fire protection and Felix Felicis. I figure both of us should come out of this alive. I’m not too worried about who wins. I’m more concerned about our safety.”
With that settled Adrian left again and apparated to the Ministry of Magic. He popped into the atrium and checked in at the desk. This time he didn’t get a funny look from the clerk. He took that as a good sign. It was a fifty/fifty chance on getting an odd look or not when his name came up. If someone recognized that they were talking to an ex-professional murderer.
He waved her away and said, “never mind.” He got up and went to his cupboard. Arlene left his office still in good mood. She was planning something that would put down a dragon for sure. They would wake up just fine. After she had accomplished her goal.
Joan began putting him on it as he did the more gruesome of the tasks: retrieving the leg. He walked up to the stunned dragon’s mouth. The jaws hung half open so he pushed them open and reached in. The breath was foul but he had to push past it. He conjured a sheet and wrapped up the limb in that before pulling it all the way out. He set it on the stretcher next to him.
In the sixties the ministry and the Connery family began a new age of rivalry. The ministry is still pushing for restrictions against magical beasts and some even desire more slaves like the house elves. The Connery family stands against this of course. The two continue to argue back and forth with each other even to this year of 1979. The Connery family continues to hold their ground but the sinister aspects of the ministry continues to press their selfish agenda against them.
He explained, “I’m checking for hidden spells and stuff. I don’t know what the former tenants might’ve left.” He checked for more things then shut the door and added some protection spells to it.
Joan input, “When dragons are angry they act dumb. You can use that to your advantage. They’re easily distracted. A loud, annoying object will distract it easily.” She crossed her arms and said, “Adrian that might give her time to do alchemy.”
She looked back to see him drawing an alchemy circle in the air. She couldn’t make out the symbols but less than a second after he activated it the largest explosion yet detonated in front of it. He was protected by a conjured shield. The Death Eaters on the other side were not.
Professor McGonagall told her, “you get to bed and we’ll let you know anything we find out.” She gave a caring smile.
He smiled in a way that Arlene didn’t like. “Hogwarts and the ministry have been working to together to bring back a timeless tradition to Hogwarts. The Triwizard tournament.” Murmurs echoed throughout the room as students began speaking to each other. Dumbledore went on, “this year we will host the tournament in which Durmstrang and Beauxbatons will participate. They will be arriving in October and shortly afterward we will begin selections for participants.” He let this information sink in before saying, “due to the unfortunate events of past tournaments the ministry has seen fit to set an age minimum of seventeen on participants.”
She looked out the window hoping some scenery would calm her. The grassy fields and the forest beyond did some for her nerves. Not as much as she would’ve liked.
The snow was falling outside again. The stars shone brightly against the night sky. Ginny looked at Neville and told him, “I had a really great time Neville. Thank you for coming with me.”
She focused and, with no signs, used her magic to increase the strength in her legs. She began running faster with ease. She leaped over a mud pit that stretched nearly seven feet with ease.
Two sets of feet came down the stairs as Fred and George came down the stairs. They sat next to Arlene and chorused, “hello Arlene.”
Not only did he show off this incredible talent of his but he was humble about it as well. Almost every dance at the ball ended with him asking her if he did well. She always told him that he did. Always in an amazed voice. Neville Longbottom was the last person anyone expected to be great at dancing.
They passed by the forbidden forest. They all flinched when the first roar sounded through the trees. McGonagall urged them on, “come on, we have to keep moving.” At the top of a hill was a stadium that had been built over the last few weeks. Next to it was the same tent that had been at the first trial. They entered in a door that was on the far side of the stadium. On the inside they could see a tunnel that led to the stadium. There was a curtain blocking the view into it though.
That night at the end of year feast the air was solemn. The banners that were normally the colors of the house with the most points had been changed to black. Conversation was quiet and reserved. Arlene ate what she could but her appetite wasn’t what it was usually.
Joan patted him on the shoulder and backed him up, “we’re concerned for everyone’s safety. If you want the money he can help with that. What he said is true. The tournament was previously cancelled because of the death toll.” She patted him again. He seemed genuinely worried about it.
George looked at her and told her, “there’s a staircase that leads down from the Great Hall. Looking into the hall it is to the left.”
Every nerve in her body had been on edge and now joy spread to every corner of her being. A smile of joy and shock grew on her face uncontrollably. In an instant everything about the world seemed so much more beautiful. She responded, joy on every word, “Luna, I love you too! You don’t know how happy you just made me!”
She shrugged and answered, “I’m just good like that. Now, I’m sorry but I have to get my stuff ready for the ball tonight. Adrian better be doing the same. I want him to look good.” She looked at their confused looks and explained, “we’re dancing together tonight. Arlene, I didn’t tell you that we’re romantic now?”
He nodded. “Come in,” he said as he opened the door all the way. He invited her, “sit down, please. I’ll show you the finest library in all the magical world.” He waved his wand and summoned a map of the world.
He left the tent and they followed him. Arlene left the tent and was instantly blinded by the sun. She held a hand over her eyes until they adjusted. They had entered the quidditch field. The seats were filled with students who were screaming and cheering for them. They were too far away to spot any faces. She focused on what was in front of her.
He left her then. She wasn’t sure what to make of that. There was nothing that Luna and her particularly needed a room alone for. It would be nice to kiss her without someone watching. Even if it gave them nothing but privacy that would be nice.
Fleur was nearby but heading away from Arlene. She was moving away from a large spider in the maze. Harry was letting Ron get ahead of him. Ron was following his wand as he used it like a compass. He figured he was South of the center so he was heading North. Krum was moving towards Fleur but something seemed off about his mind. It was as if he had two trains of thought at once. She pulled away from him and decided to move closer to Ron.
She was following him with her head. He came up with a plan. He heavily feigned to one side then dove to the other. The dragon fell for it. She went to one side then had to change direction mid-attack. Harry was lighter and faster. He swooped around her back. She followed him leaving her eggs exposed for a second. He finished his circle and dived at the eggs. He snatched up the golden one without stopping and sped away as fast as he could.
He hovered on top of her panting with his eyes closed. Joan stroked his body. He rolled off her and to cuddle with her. They pulled each other close and she kissed his chest. He started stroking her hair.
Adrian was still partially in shock. Sirius’s words rocked him from it. He was able to answer, “someone set us up. The Triwizard cup is a portkey that was supposed to take the winner back to the entrance to the maze. Someone tampered with it so it would take them to us. That same someone told the death eaters where to find us and when to show up.”
Arlene was enraptured by the pyramids. They had appeared behind a stone hut so no muggles would see them come in. Stepping out from behind it revealed that they were right next to them. It reached high in the air. The sheer scale of them was more than impressive. The people next to them appeared to be nothing more than ants.
All that set up just for that? Arlene told him, “well, good news for you, I plan on flopping the first trial.”
Joan asked, “can Snape make a sleeping potion strong enough to put down a dragon for a few minutes?”
Fred commented, “seems like those sleeping potions really got to your head.” They laughed while Adrian repeated Fred’s words in a mocking voice.
He didn’t hesitate. He began working to stop the bleeding with magic. Joan slipped in next to him and began working to dull the pain. His screaming subsided to moans as the pain dulled. For what had just happened he seemed to be holding up well but they had to keep him calm. He stopped the bleeding and conjured a stretcher.
His enemy’s grip relaxed and he fell off of him. Adrian took the chance to catch his breath. He was behind a mausoleum so he was covered. He looked over to see Ron sending spells at the death eaters. He opened his mouth to say something until a flash of green stopped the words.
“Wow! An incredible jump from Connery! No one expected that one!” There’s a lot you won’t see coming from me! She leaped at a rock outcrop just avoiding a jet of fire. The rock was horizontal enough for her to run along it and use it to jump from. She launched herself at another rock and landed on it. A gasp ran through the crowd.
She still wasn’t sure if she should fail on purpose or try to pass. Then again she might not be able to pass even if she wanted to. She had her own magic. There were some spells she could do subtly but most of the stronger ones would be obvious. She could try to pass it off to her wand but someone with a good eye might see it not come from the tip.
I just need to say that I mean no offense to anyone by writing this chapter. If I did something wrong or offensive by accident please let me know so I can fix it. As always I am open to feedback and constructive criticism.
The librarian took the check and the books away for a few minutes. Then he came back with three books in fresh binding. She knew the copying would be done with magic but she was still impressed with the short amount of time it took. The librarian handed her the books and she thanked him. He nodded in answer.
Arlene clapped her hands together and said, “it was bound to happen sooner or later. I knew that the school would find out eventually. I guess this is the best time for it. Everyone is distracted by the tournament and still feeling good from the ball last night.”
She understood why everyone seemed to hate Harry. He was already famous and didn’t need the money. So no one really wanted him to win. At this point it seemed like a grab for more glory.
With no control over his actions he set about the destruction of the world. Cities burned, farms were erased, generations of families were lost. He showed no mercy to the young or the weak. Wizard kind rallied to stop the evil but no magic did any permanent damage. Even the Connery family were pushed back by him. But by their full power and the assistance of their dragon allies were they able to subdue the evil. No magic they knew at the time or even known now could kill it. They trapped it somewhere that I have not been able to find.
Humanity quickly forgot their saviors but the beasts of magical blood have long memories. They remembered. The Connery family stuck by their side and the two formed an unbreakable alliance that resulted in the most powerful dynasty within the magical community.
The three girls grabbed their things. Ginny said bye to her mom. Luna had already said bye to her father. They boarded the train and found a compartment fast since they had boarded early compared most of the students.
Something hit her back hard enough to make her stumble. In the loose dirt she lost her footing and slipped. She slid down the slope towards a pit of mud. It looked deep and easy to get stuck in. If she got trapped in that then she wouldn’t get out in time to win.
Severus got up and walked around. Trying to get more blood flowing to his brain. He still didn’t put a log into the fire.
He killed two. One popped out from behind a grave behind him. Adrian grabbed his hand and broke his arm at the elbow with a heavy strike. Adrian snatched the wand from his hand and used it to Reducto the death eater’s head.
Arlene felt most of her frustration dissipate with those words. It was good to know that someone was looking out for her. That someone had her back. Her adoptive parents and Professors McGonagall and Flitwick were on her side. She felt good about this. If any team of people could find a loophole in the rules then it was them.
Even through that they managed. With the combined efforts of Mrs. Weasley and Adrian lunch was prepared. Meanwhile, Joan helped cheer everyone up by telling them what happened to her and Adrian at St. Mungo’s. She started out with what happened when she found Adrian. “So, I found him laying around as usual.”
Arlene’s mouth worked but no words came out. After a minute she said, “the cup took us away. It took us to a graveyard. Adrian was there. So were Mr. Lupin and Mr. Black. Some kind of ritual was going on. There was a man who looked like the person who came out of the diary in my first year. He was older.” Realization hit her of who she had seen. “It was Voldemort.” She turned to Joan and whispered, “he’s back. Voldemort’s back.” Her voice shook. “Ron’s dead. A death eater killed him.” The tears came back.
Luna pointed to her book and said, “the dragon will recover too fast for two wizards to overcome it. No matter how many stunning spells you throw at it. It would take at least five or six to bring it down.” She gave Harry a nod of the head. “Nice idea though.”
Heat and wind rushed by her. Even through her closed eyelids the light still hurt her eyes. The sound was nearly unbearable. It left her ears ringing and only barely able to hear. That didn’t stop them from running from the danger.
Instead Harry talked to him. “When my parents died I was forced to live with my aunt and uncle. Some of the worst people to ever exist. I spent most of my young life being ignored in favor of my cousin. I lived under a staircase in a cupboard. He got two bedrooms. As soon as I was old enough I was cooking most of the food. He was eating most of it. They hated me and for eleven years I didn’t even know why. For so long I was afraid to just be alive in the house I lived in. Then Hagrid came to my house and brought me to Hogwarts. I thought the nightmare was finally over.” Harry’s fists clenched with anger. “Then that…fucking Dumbledore made me go back. After everything I did for him. He just sent me back to be starved, beaten and hurt more. He spouted some bullshit about blood protection.”
Hagrid turned to the boy who had pushed her in and said, “that was very rude of you. Let’s go have a chat with Professor Flitwick.”
“Ha!” Adrian clapped his hands together and cheered, “I figured this one out! It’s a picture! She shot a picture of him, held it underwater in a dark room and hung it up. Then they had dinner.” He crossed his arms with a smug look on his face. “Normally I suck at riddles. I figured this one out easily though.”
Soon the horizon was filled with blue. Next the farmland was replaced by buildings. He called back to her, “I’m going to go over the ocean and lower altitude. I’ll need to save the invisibility spell for when we’re approaching.” He did just this. He passed over a narrow outcrop of land that formed a bay. He went several kilometers over the ocean then dropped speed and altitude.
He found and killed the werewolf. He could not go back truly empty handed though. He would live but only to be beaten and tormented in the name of making him stronger. Adrian came up with a terrible idea. Michael believed in Death as an entity. Adrian was a talented alchemist even now. So he did the unthinkable. In an alchemic circle he put the head of the wolf, an egg, and a dying flower. Life in its full cycle. Then he activated the circle with the idea of summoning death itself.
For probably the first time she had ever seen, Fred and George acted serious about something. Fred said, “Let’s keep moving.” George didn’t say anything. Just helped them along.
Ollivander was there and went through an inspection of every wand. Even Arlene’s and luckily for his health and Joan’s job security he didn’t say anything about her not being able to use it. The process finished and after some pictures they prepared to leave.
His wrinkles faded down to mere crow’s feet at his eyes. His hair and beard shrunk down to a manageable size as they both turned brown. Muscle returned to his hands. His bony hands regained their youth.
An older man with grey hairs met with Dumbledore and again they couldn’t hear what was said. The students with the furs walked in and they followed them in. As they walked whispers sprang up. Mostly about Victor Krum who some claimed to have seen in the Durmstrang students. Arlene didn’t see him so she didn’t believe the rumors.
As they approached the home a shrill, shriek rent the night’s silence. Mrs. Weasley ran over to them and did the best she could to hug them all at once multiple times. The whole time going on about what she had heard. “I’m so glad to see you all alive. It’s just terrible what I heard.” She even hugged Arlene and Luna. “You all need to get inside. I’ve made tea for everyone.”
Sirius and Remus were fighting back against the death eaters while they advanced to Harry. They called out to him several times but he was tool involved in his attack on Voldemort.
“We’ll get there,” Harry reassured her. He leaned back in his chair. “every trial removes three champions from the game. Except the last which only removes two and leaves the final challenger.” He pointed between the two of them, “the great man who helped us out of our hell holes for homes, Professor Barnes, left a rule book on his desk a few days after the choosing of the champions.”
McGonagall leaned in and told him, “yes, it was awful. She called you many horrible things. Blamed you for it.”
She nodded but wanted to look at the pyramids more. They were just so massive and majestic. Muggles had built these without any magic. Arlene didn’t believe in aliens either. It was all hard work and sweat. Hard work from a people that never got any credit for it. She then remembered that these were built by slave labor.
Dumbledore tapped his wand against the Goblet of Fire three times. Barty told him, “I will find him. I will not fail you.”
Arlene snarled and swiped her wand hand at her but used her own magic to disturb the dirt under her. She fell and slid down the slope further than Arlene had. She crawled up the slope and was able to stand up. As she left she yelled back, “clumsy yourself!”
Then two arms wrapped around him. He felt someone holding him. A whisper in his ear told him, “I’ve felt the same way for a long time. I didn’t know you felt so strongly towards me. Let’s go sit by the lake.”
Luna had a fierce smile on her face. “I like this. You’ve always been a person Ginny. Now it’s time to show the world.”
Three days later she got a letter saying that their article would be in the next print of the Quibbler.
Arlene wasn’t able to focus on it well. She had to think for a minute before the answer came to her. “An echo.” The knocker growled but let her in.
“Tom Riddle sr.” Adrian kept acting tired as if he had been busy over the last few days. He would never be good enough for the films but he could convince the average person.
“Good job,” Luna commented. They walked in to find most of the house still up. As soon as she walked in they got up and began moving towards her. Luna got in front of her and announced, “any questions for Arlene come with a free copy of the Quibbler!” The entire house backed off. She smirked and whispered, “I am aware of the effect I have on the closed minded.” They went to bed without any further complications.
Adrian went in and came out five minutes later. He told her, “get some rest. We’re going to the library tomorrow and we’ll get you the information that you need.” He laid down and got under his covers.
They took a seat by the lake. The view over the water was picturesque. The most beautiful thing though was that Harry Potter didn’t hate him for his feelings. He hadn’t laughed him off or worse started screaming homosexual related slurs at him. The insult to his heart in a moment of openness would’ve been far too hurtful for him.
She gently slapped his abs and told him, “no, I want to ask if those monks ever taught you some stuff about meditation or some shit.”
Arlene noted that and sat down across from her. She slide a box to Ginny and said, “this is a real gift.” She opened it and found another amulet like the one Luna had received. Arlene informed her of the protective charm on it.
As the day went on more and more people got up and began showing their support for one team or another. The game was Bulgaria versus Ireland. The majority were for Ireland but many also loved Bulgaria’s seeker, Victor Krum. Ron was especially infatuated with him.
Luna said, “I’ll take one as well please.” She nodded and left to go get their drinks. When she left Luna said, “she remembered you. I like her.” It was such a simple statement but having the approval of Luna Lovegood would mean a great amount to those who knew her.
They learned in depth about the fungus, Dittany, that was integral to the potion of the same name. It was excellent for healing shallow wounds. It could be used in the plant form but was better as a potion.
Adrian, Sirius, and Remus stood at Tom Riddle Sr.’s grave. They had just finished performing the final checks on the cage and the ritual. Sirius said, “we’re ready to do it. The moon is full. It’s now or never.”
Someone popped into the clearing and warned them, “get back. They’re bringing the cages in soon.” The red haired man jogged over to Hagrid and Adrian. The three of them retreated away from the center of the clearing.
Arlene nodded. “That was shocking.” A thought came to her. “Do you think that the ability to read minds is part of my family’s legacy? I read that my family was well known as an ally of magical beasts during the early years of the ministry. Allies of goblins and others as well. The book even claimed that the ancient members of my family could communicate with dragons. I think I just figured out how.” In the moment that she had read the minds of the owls she had known exactly what they desired and felt. Would it be that way with any creature?
Joan pulled her into a hug which she accepted and returned. “I think you just recovered a big piece of your family’s heritage. You should be proud. I know I am and your parents would be.”
She reeled back from the response. She then scowled at them. Upset that she wasn’t getting the response she wanted, she waved them away and yelled, “get out of here!”
In his last two years of school Potter seemed to change. He stopped bullying him. He urged his friends to stop bullying him. He even began to stick up for Severus. There was one time where he might’ve been trying to apologize but he pushed him away and tried to curse him. Instead of defending himself Potter just ran from him. He could’ve easily beaten him but he didn’t. Potter still didn’t mess with him after that.
The two students who had attacked Potter shook their heads in a desperate plea. They would rather write an essay than be stuck with Professor Moody for a night. Adrian smiled and said, “thank you. That would be fantastic.” He handed him the wands he had confiscated. “They’re all yours.” Moody hauled the two students away.
He chuckled and answered, “I don’t know if that’s a good thing or a bad thing. Some great adventures come from that sometimes. Other times not.” He took a drink from his mug. “It can’t hurt I guess.”
He left the hospital wing while reciting a mantra in his head. Don’t murder. Don’t murder. Don’t murder.
Adrian’s heart rate was still coming down and he told her, “I think good is an understatement.” She laughed and nodded against his chest. “I might pass out for an hour or so.”
Arlene nodded. She already knew what it was. She joined them on the floor. It was very clean since it was cleaned daily but never used. Ginny did note that Arlene hadn’t been crying. She wasn’t sure if that was from inner strength or bottling up her emotions. Maybe the article hadn’t affected her that much. She asked, “what are you thinking?”
“No,” she told them. “Whatever you want to ask him you can ask me. I’m a more competent teacher anyway.”
Then another stretcher went by. This one had a ministry worker on it. The right side of his body was covered in second and third degree burns. Most of his face had been saved but a little of his cheek was red. He wasn’t moving but they could hear his breathing. One of the ministry workers levitating him was saying, “I thought they stunned that thing! It got up and got Jeff.” Then they were gone.
The professor made an unprofessional noise and responded, “more than passing from what I hear.” He sighed. “I do wish you could perform wand magic. I would love to see what you could with charms. I know you would be a truly talented witch.” He seemed genuinely sad over it.
They made small talk with Hagrid before having to leave due to his work. They walked back to the castle. Arlene decided she wanted to try out what Draco had told her. Ginny headed off to dinner while Luna and she went to the seventh floor.
Several minutes later he left the room to find Hermione Granger walking by. She stopped to say, “Professor, I have something strange to ask.” He stopped to listen and she asked, “is there a way we can prove if Rita Skeeter is an animagus?”
Her face paled and she stuttered. “W-w-well, simple, r-really. Uh…” No actual response came from her. She waved off the question and responded, “why do you need to know?”
He actually blushed and answered, “o-oh, I just did a lot of practicing in my spare time. I’ve always had a rhythm for music. It helps plants grow.” His blush went away as his voice grew in confidence at the idea of plants. Everyone knew that Herbology was Neville’s favorite subject. It was also his best subject.
“You don’t want to know,” she breathed out. As they approached the podium her strength returned. She was able to walk on her own by the time they reached it. Arlene told Ron, “there it is, take it. We got you here so you could.”
She scowled at the knocker and responded, “I’d love to but the knocker won’t let me in.” She turned to him and asked, “are you taking me to that library?”
Arlene tried to explain, “no, I can pay for it. I have enough money. I have more than enough.” I could probably buy the company that made them. She didn’t want to say that and brag too much.
When Luna and she walked into the Great Hall they found the other champions waiting. Professor McGonagall was there fussing over all the details. Krum was with Hermione as his partner. Harry stood next to Parvati and Ron had Padma but he kept looking at Hermione. The two champions from Beauxbatons had yet to arrive.
“Agreed,” Adrian said. He looked her in the eye and said, “go on to bed, let us worry about this for now.”
“I’m not going to die,” Arlene insisted. “I’ve lived through danger before. I’m still here aren’t I?”
She didn’t want something like that happening to Luna. She could go with a boy but just as a friend. That wasn’t what she wanted. She wanted to be with the girl she loved. To dance with her and kiss her. To do all those things and not worry that the wrong person might go crazy and try to hurt Luna or her.
The landscape was similar to his home’s. After all they were only separated by a small boat ride. The house here was smaller than his but had all the same enchantments and alchemy done to it. Sirius lay on a hammock enjoying the sun. He peered over sunglasses at Adrian and asked, “time to get to work?”
They reentered the castle. Far too soon they had to separate to return to their own common rooms. Alone in the corridor they risked a quick hug. They separated and Draco asked, “when can we meet again?”
Professor Flitwick entered the room and said, “Miss Connery, are you alright? Let’s get this sorted out.”
Adrian ran back towards the clearing while yelling at the students, “get back to the cup! That’s an order!” He cleared a tall gravestone just in time to be blinded. He squinted and shielded his eyes. A massive beam of light had shot from the cauldron. It faded as soon as it had appeared. His breath caught as he saw the cage had been broken by the beam of light. Smoke hid the inside of the cage so he didn’t know what was happening in it.
“Connery takes the lead but is followed closely by Delacour. All of the champions have reached the wall. Ah! Krum has reached the top!”
The thing was that it would be strange to confront her over it. They both had done something illegal. He gained enough focus to stand up. He grumbled and decided that it wasn’t worth it. Even if Rita got out and tried to press charges he could just tell everyone that she was an illegal animagus. All he had done was turn her into a beetle and put her in the jar. She had enraged a dragon to tear someone’s leg off. He wouldn’t go to Azkaban for one reason: they still didn’t know where his house was. The ministry is terrible at finding people who go on the run most of the time too.
He didn’t know what else to say. So he told her the truth. All of it, from what Sirius told him to what he did. All the planning. He hid no details. She didn’t interrupt him, she just let him explain himself. Eventually he stopped talking.
Things went on like this until Monday. On Monday right before Joan was about to go to sleep early she was set upon by a third year Gryffindor named Colin Creevey. “Professor. I have to tell you something. Your adoptee is getting interviewed by Rita Skeeter!”
Adrian sighed before going on, “I’ll need one of his father’s bones. Did Dumbledore ever give any clues to his origins?”
The next day at breakfast they got their first schedules for the semester. First was care of magical creatures. Their second class was herbology. The rest of the day was wand based lessons. Arlene of course had her own magic lessons during that time.
Then another one was dropped in her eggs. This one rose up on its own. A bang made her jump as it exploded leaving one screaming word ringing out, “bitch!”
The tent flap popped open, making everyone jump. Ludo Bagman followed by Rita Skeeter, Madame Maxine, Professor Karkaroff, and Professor Dumbledore.
As if to emphasize his thought another roar sounded through the air. After a few minutes of stiff silence Ludo Bagman, Professors Dumbledore and Karkaroff with Madame Maxine walked in the tent. Mr. Bagman said, “good day champions now by now it’s obvious that you’re going up against dragons.” He made motions to gather them around. He went on, “Now all you have to do is get past the dragon, grab the golden egg, and get away from it.” He raised his hands in a carefree gesture and said, “simple no?”
Adrian raised an eyebrow as he drew his wand. He introduced himself, “Adrian Barnes, alchemy master of Hogwarts.”
There was a man in a uniform waiting for them. He extended a hand and said something in a language she didn’t understand. Adrian said some words to him in the same language and the uniformed man led them to a door on the roof. He opened the door for them and it opened to the ground floor lobby. She could tell it was the ground floor from the windows on the other side that gave a view of the street.
She opened her eyes to see Luna looking at her with concern. She patted Luna on the shoulder and said, “I’m fine. Little shocking is all.” The girl behind her giggled at her but she ignored it.
