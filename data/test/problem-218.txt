Tom took a step back to give Harry space "Harry I-"
**********************************************************************************
Harry's tears soaked Draco's shirt. "He was the dad never I got to have. My family... You aunt took that away from me"
Hermione was angry now " I know a real memory when I see one Harry! They don't call be the brightest which of my age for nothing!"
Tom repeated that he knew what he was doing and all would be well.
Harry could tell by Tom's face he had figured it out, after all he had worked with Wormtail for some time. Tom smiled.
“Have you made your decision then?” Voldemort spoke quietly it was almost like a whisper but it still made Harry jump.
"WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY SON YOU BASTARD" Molly screamed
"Regardless Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs" Pansy gushed "They were brilliant"
Sweat dripped down Harry's face slowly, leaving dirty trails behind, his rapid breathing and beating heart were the only signs that he was distressed. His legs aching with each step as hewalked through the darkness, each step he took was as if he was wandering into a black hole. Harry wanted nothing more than for this to end, he after all wasn't living he was just surviving and to Harry that was meaningless. He stopped for a second to check on his wound, blood running down his cheats in a heavy stream. Harry cursed he knew he didn't have long.
"So Harry did you like copy a prank they did or something" Blaise asked
Tom nodded at Harry " I know to which you refer, those views were due to a moment of insanity my views have changed let me prove them to you.. Hermione has joined my ranks; she is currently in my inner circle... You would be to"
Draco's silver grey eyes widened. “Why you?"
Neville nodded
Draco shook his head "Nuts, she's completely nuts!"
Draco gave Harry a quick kiss “Tom told me what you said last night Harry but I would like to hear you say it.”
Draco was the only patient there when, Harry arrived, and he looked really pale in the moonlight. Harry walked toward him quietly, he sat in the arm chair and held the other boys hand.
Voldemort glared at Harry, which dint effect the teen in the slightest "Tom Marvolo Riddle."
**********************************************************************************
Madam Pomfrey looked shocked.
Harry returned Hermione's embrace after a while, and cried into her shoulder. He was glad that he had Hermione as a best friend, she just knew him so well. They stayed like this for what felt like an eternity; Harry clung to Hermione like a life line.
Draco's eyes widened "James was Prongs, you’re the son of a Marauder"
Harry let out a nervous laugh. "And maybe we can end the war before anyone else has to die."
Harry put his arms up in surrender “Okay, okay sorry" He gave her a smile to reassure her “so what are you doing here then."
Harry gave the other a sheepish look, “Sorry I’m just glad that Draco is going to be okay, I’m relieved that he doesn’t hate me.”
Harry smiled “Mr Weasley here is you official notice... You see the ministry doesn't hire thieves, you'll find that you all have a black mark against your name thanks to me of course"
Tom scowled at Draco "You forget you place Draco, I will not be spoken to that way!"
**********************************************************************************
Harry frowned “Surely there is someone better suited to the job, I’m not refusing, but they are likely not to listen to me because of the bad blood between us, and I am just a teen myself surely you have someone among your ranks who has more skills than me.”
Harry smiled “ We have always been close, they looked out for me and have always been on my side, I have helped them with a prank or two and when I gave them the funding they need for their store they begged me to blood adopt them, apparently I was the only one who believed in them. I accepted"
Draco moved so he was looking directly into Harry's eyes. “You have me now, and Hermione, I know that we can’t replace him in your heart and I don’t want to just remember blood doesn't make family...you have us now... Just treasure the time you had with him"
Harry thought about it "How about I go on probation, I'll join for a month and if I still don't agree I'll go neutral" Tom nodded at Harry “if that is what it takes then I agree... Now sleep"
Tom nodded "I hope you’re packed, and ready to learn...you have already missed five days."
When the three had arrived at the Room of Requirement they were met with two very angry adults.
“What the hell is going on?” He said with a moan as he felt Tom brush against him.
“I don’t know about you but I need a shower.” Tom smirked at the other two.
Draco's mouth was once again agape "Flies, Draco flies". Draco closed his mouth only to open it again. “You seem to make the impossible happen Harry; you would have to be of all the founders blood to have done that."
"Well, well, well... Welcome little lioness to the snakes den." She smirked at Hermione as this was officially Hermione’s first visit to the Slytherin’s dorms.
“It wasn't him Harry, it was Dumbledore, I have seen the memory with my own eyes."
"As a matter of fact I do, and one day I may let you see it."
Draco had a panicked looked on his face. "You can’t just say that kind of stuff in front of the Dark Lord."
Voldemort rolled his eyes. "Not everything needed has to be so drastic."
Harry looked up at him "Oh yeah what's that?"
**********************************************************************************
Hermione nodded but that was the end of that conversation at least for now... Harry just hoped they didn't talk to Dumbledore or his lie would be exposed, he could always take credit for the idea and say he used Dumbledore as an excuse for his friends not to worry.
"Everyone leaves eventually."
Harry pulled out a chair in between Hermione and Draco. “Yup I believe you one hundred percent" Harry's voice was laced with sarcasm causing Tom to scowl at the laughing teens before returning to his paperwork. Harry leaned closer to Draco “Why didn't you wake me"
Draco gave him a worried look “You keep thinking about that night don't you"
Harry gave her a pained look "I'm sorry Mione I just have a lot on my plate right now."
True to his word Draco helped Harry every time he was about to make a mistake, Slughorn couldn't find anything wrong with his potion by the end. Harry turned around to once again poke his tongue out at Tom. Tom rose an eyebrow and mouthed 'childish' Harry's shook his head a grinned when he was awarded twenty points to Gryffindor for his perfect potion. Hermione also gained twenty points, she sat there with a huge smile in her face.
Tom looked thoughtful for a bit before "I'll try and break it down for you, okay?"
Harry’s eyes were wide. “Tom spoke to you in your sleep?”
Hermione grinned "Thanks Pans."
The blonde gently reached for Harry’s hand placing it on his own chest. "Copy my breaths, one, and two..." He continued to count his breaths as Harry tried to do what was asked. His breathing was still uneven but was slowly slowing down.
Harry turned to face the other teen "Yes?"
Neville smirked "Never said you were mate, just have a threesome and get it over with will you, it's driving everyone crazy!"
“How many am I teaching exactly?” Harry asked
There evil plotting turned out I be just enjoying Harry's cooking once again. Harry smiled at his friends, Harry already had a plan.
“We get to go flying" Draco gestured to the two brooms lying next to the blanket... "Your mum hated flying."
this. The sheets of his bed were cool on his heated skin and he let out a gasp as Tom practically ripped off his pants.
Over the next couple of days Draco came over, the three teenagers were practically inseparable; Draco had decorated Harry's room with black leather couches, a king size bed with silky sliver sheets, a fancy chandler, posters of the England Quidditch team. He charmed the walls a sapphire blue which surprised Harry at first but when he asked Draco he said "My rooms green they can't be identical"
Hermione squeezed him in a tight hug. "I'm so happy you’re going to continue your education Harry!"
Hermione rolled her eyes "Yeah right, people get hooked on your food after the first bite just look at me and Draco."
"Harry I know he loved you very much, mum said when you were born, it was all he talked about, it was if you were his son"
"No offence my lord but I don't give a shit right now, I want to know what’s wrong with him!"
“Nah you need my Potter luck, if you want to win this war after all.”
"Merlin Harry, I want you to cook for me for the rest of my life!" Draco gave Harry a genuine smile, Harry couldn't help but think about the saying a way to a man’s heart is through his stomach. It seemed Harry had won Draco's friendship with one simple meal.
"What if that gets everyone killed? Sirius died, it was luck that he was able to come back, Cedric is gone, my parents are dead and Ron was my best friend and he now wants me dead not to mention all of Gryffindor wants my head on a spike, these were people who a few months ago I trusted with my life."
“Oh lets agree never to kiss again, I’m glad it annoyed your old family but you guys are now related to me by blood and it’s too weird.”
"Well that’s good then" Blaise stated.
Draco and Tom positioned Harry so that, Tom was behind him and Draco in front, Draco was on all fours in front of Harry. Harry had no idea what he was doing as Draco reached behind him to insert Harry slowly inside him. Harry let out another loud moan as he felt Draco surrounding him, Draco mimicking him as he felt Harry enter him. Once Harry was all the way, he didn’t move straight away, copying Tom and letting the other get used to the feeling. Tom had used this time to insert himself slowly into Harry. Who now was overwhelmed with sensations and his eyes rolled to the back oh his head.
"It's impossible to forget you and the trouble you cause, it’s been a long while but yes." Draco smirked fixing his hair.
Neville shook his head and sighed "Revenge is a sweet thing Harry but don't let it consume you or else you will become a shell of who you are and the people who love and care about you will lose you... You will cause them pain, letting the people you hate win."
Sweat dripped down Harry's face slowly, leaving dirty trails behind, his rapid breathing and beating heart were the only signs that he was distressed. His legs aching with each step as hewalked through the darkness, each step he took was as if he was wandering into a black hole. Harry wanted nothing more than for this to end, he after all wasn't living he was just surviving and to Harry that was meaningless. He stopped for a second to check on his wound, blood running down his cheats in a heavy stream. Harry cursed he knew he didn't have long.
Hermione smiled wickedly before walking over to Draco and shoving a fork into his mouth.
Draco chuckled "Ah no not really, I do however want to know how excellent my tutoring skills are!"
Harry rolled his eyes but walked and sat in the students chair, a complete opposite of last time as well. He hadn’t made eye contact instead he looked past the man in front of him.
"Ron looked at Harry Dumbfounded. "Harry just a few months ago Malfoy vowed to make you pay for his father's trip to Azkaban, he is the son of a Death Eater he cannot be trusted."
"Harry never did, he stood up for me when no one else would and the others may have treated me badly but they have made up for it, you always treated me like someone lower then you... You saw me as a nobody someone who always needed help...Harry believed in me... He's a better man then you ever will."
Harry shrugged "They don't seem so bad, maybe this can work."
Harry turned to his group of friends and winked. Dumbledore stood and placed the hat on Harry's head, everyone was watching in silence, no one moved or made a sound as they watched and waited..
Harry glared at Voldemort. “I don't know what she told you Voldemort but she clearly gave you the wrong impression."
"Glory hog" Blaise muttered
"We have called a Truce." Harry explained.
Harry rolled his eyes at his blonde friend. "The sorting hat tried to sort me in Slytherin"
**********************************************************************************
Draco soon joined in the laughter.
“Miss me?” He mouthed over Pomfrey’s shoulder.
"Maybe I can change their minds sir, maybe war doesnt have to happen... maybe they wont be any more deaths like Cedric and Sirius."
"Bye cub" Sirius and Remus called to him as he left.
Dumbledore smiled his fake grandfatherly smile "We don't need to he will come to us, he loves this place... He will be back."
"Me either" Harry laughed
Hermione grabbed a napkin and wiped the chocolate away "He heard my Ideals from Draco and approved so he chose me, told me it was an honour I'm the only muggle born he will tolerate... Plus it helps I'm best friends with you."
"Hmm let me think, there is no way it's you Harry." Harry removed his hand and smiled at Draco. “Stealing my food again Draco?"
Harry just laughed "Awkward...”
"Pomfrey says that he is healing fine, and that he will wake up when he is ready."
Harry slowly made his way to the room of requirement, his mind going back to the day in Tom's study, to the kiss, how soft Tom's lips were against his, the overpower of sensations that flooded through his body, how his legs had grown weak, how guilty he had felt when he thought of Draco, how confused he was about his feelings for both. Harry shook his head, he didn't need this right now... He was going to get his revenge on his fellow students, who had tormented him the last five years at Hogwarts, the people who couldn't make up their mind whether they loved or hated him, the people who were still tormenting him because he wouldn't fight for them, because they didn't want to fight themselves. It was another reason why Harry had left the war, why fight and die for people who wouldn’t do the same sacrifice.
Harry let go of the breath he was holding Tom didn't know about the kiss thank god, he really didn't want Tom to kill Draco.
Harry groaned
Hermione found Harry reading in the corner of the library. "I'm never going to get used to you reading."
“Still doesn’t make the horrid though.. even the wrackspurts don’t like her.” Luna pouted.
"A poison created by mixing several other poisons together, cannot simply be created by finding the antidotes to each separate poison in the blended whole and mixing them together. Instead, you must find that single ingredient which, when added to the blended antidotes, transforms them near-alchemically into a combined whole which will counteract the entire blended poison." Tom recited, reminding Harry a little of Hermione.
The confused look never left Harry’s face so Draco explained. “Tom has always had a gift with playing with the mind. While I was recovering, Tom visited my mind every day. He would give me updates on what was going on and how everyone was doing and just keep me company, hell he even told me the stuff I was I missing in classes..”
Harry was dreading tonight; it would be his first meeting as death eater.
Harry rolled his eyes. “I’m not something to be owned Tom.”
He was screwed.
Voldemort leaned back in the chair. “ Yes I suppose you have point, but they have a spell to make people forget things they had no place on knowing.”
Voldemort arched an eyebrow; he truly hadn’t known where the boy lived. "Why are you so reckless with your own life?" He couldn’t stop himself from asking.
Harry sighed “You see sir I haven't been getting on with the people in my house, they all hate me, I don't really have friends there besides Hermione and Neville... I want to be resorted sir; I don't think I belong in Gryffindor anymore, I have changed and think that another house might be better suited for me."
“Since they know, does that mean we can officially change our name?”
"Can’t have you falling asleep in the middle of class can we?"
"Thank you." Harry said softly.
They were then interrupted by a small first year who looked like he wanted to be anywhere else but talking to Harry.
They spent the next hour or so, talking about what Harry's involvement would be, where the line began and where it would end. Harry would not have to torture but if Voldemort required him to bring him someone he would. Harry had the right to refuse certain orders from Voldemort but would have to have reasoning as to why, and if he objected to anything Voldemort does or says, he was to only voice his opinion in private and never in front of any of his followers to do so would result in punishment.
Harry snorted "Like being in your presence?"
“WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?” Remus yelled at the same time.
Draco turned toward Tom with a confused look "What do you mean?"
Harry gave Luna a hug in greeting when he found her among the crowd of people in the small pub.
Hermione wouldn’t look Harry in the eye.
By now the group had reached the teachers table, everyone was staring at only Harry as Harry walked straight in front of Dumbledore and smiled his innocent smile. "Harry m'boy what can I do for you?"
Hermione smiled "I'm glad."
Hermione looked at Harry “I better get some" Harry was about to reply when he was interrupted.
Dumbledore raised his hands "Let’s not fight boys, to answer your question Tom. It has been foreseen that Harry is the only one with the power to defeat Voldemort, he is a beacon for hope for many people that is what I meant... Harry possess power lord Voldemort himself can never even dream of, Harry can love immensely, and Voldemort couldn't love anyone if he tried."
Draco and Harry's breath were mixing together, their lips almost touching. They were both looking into each other’s eyes when Draco leaned even closer to Harry and kissed Harry, it was different to the kiss he had with Tom. This one was soft and sweet and so full of emotion, Harry could clearly feel the way that Draco felt about him in the kiss. It was slow and made Harry melt, his worries just disappeared within Draco's kisses so when Draco licked Harry's lip Harry gave him entrance and sighed into the kiss as Draco tasted ever bit if Harry's mouth. Harry felt like he was in heaven until the kissed stopped and Harry was brought back into reality.
Harry was sitting on one of the black armchairs by the fire in the common room doing his potions essay when Tom came and sat next to him. Harry looked up briefly before going back to his work.
Madam Pomfrey stared at them in disbelief.
They sat there in silence, Harry and Draco could do this without it being awkward. Harry had a stronger bond that Harry and Ron were never close to getting. "Drake I'm sorry for not accepting your friendship back at Hogwarts"
“That’s true” Harry agreed.
Harry stared Dumbledore down. "Sirius did."
"It's a date then." Tom smiled brightly.
"But Mione, you know I hate shopping."
Draco sneered "He is the boy who lived, they properly didn't want to hurt his little feelings."
Harry shrugged "It's the five class ones you have to watch out for."
Voldemort smirked. “I also need you to warn me of any raids the order  has planned when you hear of them, I am sure you won’t hear of any Severus wouldn’t have told me, it's just a precautionary measure.
Neville smiled "So Harry, how were holidays"?
Harry had listened to Tom's advice about not avoiding him or Draco anymore so had gone to their rooms to talk to Draco. "It was a last minute thing Drake."
The day was long and Harry was exhausted he spent lunch and his free period, doing all of his homework, so he could visit Draco without consequences. This time Madam Pomfrey put up a charm to alert her if Harry returned after he was sent back to the common room.
Harry let out a deep breath. "If and I mean if, I chose to either go neutral or join you can we make a deal that you will leave my friends alone if I can get them to either go neutral or join."
“What are friends for, plus you already bothered me, so too late."
Harry smiled brightly as it disappeared.
Harry stared at the notes he had made for the lessons with the Slytherin's, they were old ones he had used for Dumbledore's Army the year before. The lesson itself had been successful with the others but he wasn't sure that this was something the Slytherin's would accept. Did he have to teach them the Dark Arts? He was lacking in that department, was it just simple dueling? Or defense in all areas? Damn he wished he had asked Voldemort while he had the chance, he had an hour before he was supposed to meet up with the Slytherins for their first lesson. Snape had sent word and now he was wishing he had refused this particular mission because right now he was very nervous as to what the outcome would be. Maybe he should just use the first lesson to discuss what it was that everyone had hoped to get out of the lessons and then go from there?
Hermione and Ron cornered Harry on their way back to the Gryffindor common room, demanding what the hell was going on, why he was hanging out with the Slytherins.
"Remus will be here soon as well, soon as he heard of your safety he declared he would break away as soon as possible." Tom informed the group.
"Don't worry the order weren't the ones to save you" Harry smiled and let out a breath he didn't know he had been holding.
Harry on the other hand had no idea what a wizard oath was, he didn’t want to seem idiotic by asking what one was and also was unsure whether he could trust whatever the other man said one was, but he knew veritaserum, had seen it used and trusted it a lot more than the oath, he just had one problem. How could he be sure that it would really be the serum he took and not some other potion and then continue to lie?
"Cya Siri, Remy... I better get going before the others get worried"
Harry nodded, he handed her some money. “My treat then.”
Harry sighed "They are not that bad sir, we have called a truce."
Harry looked sheepish and tried to hide behind his lovers but they wouldn’t let him.
Harry smiled back. “So since where you to close?”
It was true that without Tom Draco would have been left with nothing but the memories of what had happened to be replayed in his mind over and over again. Yes he would have moments where he could hear Harry and his friends talking to him while he slept and would be forever in their debt for giving him some peace within his torture. However Tom was constantly sending him visions on what was going on so he could see and not just hear and at night would talk to him for a while. Draco would always be thankful towards Tom, even if Tom was doing it more for Harry’s sake then his own.
Harry began working on demonstrating the different types of shield charms and explained when it was best to use them. The group all listened and a few would send an eye roll his way on occasion but all in all the first lesson had gone off without incident, Harry was hoping each lesson would be as successful. He gave them a little reading and suggested they practice before the next meeting.
Hermione nodded.
It had been three weeks since Draco’s attack and the boy was fully healed, the only problem was that he hadn’t woken up yet. Madam Pomfrey said it was because his mind wasn’t ready to face the reality yet.  Every day that Draco didn’t wake up, Harry felt worse and worse. If it hadn’t been for his friends he probably would have been expelled for not showing up to classes or for being all doom and gloom. Harry rarely spoke to anyone and always had a lost look on his face, without Draco a light seemed to dim inside of Harry. The Twins had even visited on a Hogsmeade weekend and tried to get Harry in another prank but Harry had turned them down and left them without saying a word.
Despite still having the small voice in the back of his mind still telling him this was his fault, he nodded sadly to his best friend.
Harry didn't question the order and downed the potions quickly, he figured at least if they were poisoned this nightmare would finally be over. The others looked at the young teen in shock, they had expected Harry to throw the vials across the room father then drink something the dungeon bat had given him. It made them all ask themselves if the other had a death wish after all.
Harry didn't want to leave Draco but he knew Hermione was right; a year ago Dumbledore would have given him all the time off he wanted but now? Dumbledore would probably have him thrown out of the school.
She shook him lightly "I'm your best friend and have known you for years, I would be a pretty bad friend if I didn't know you...so spill!"
"Is there any improvement?"
Harry tried to remember how he got here but the last thing he remembered was running from the Dursley's after Vernon attacked him. Who had saved him? He didn't recognise anything around him so he couldn't be at the headquarters of the order of the Phoenix then Harry soon started to panic what of someone from the order had found him and were going to force him to fight for them. Harry scoffed there would no way he would fight he thought it was ridiculous that they put the fate of the war in a child's hands, he only just finished Hogwarts and they expected him to be able to defeat the freaking dark lord, one of the most powerful wizards since the founders of Hogwarts themselves...yeah right.
Harry rolled his eyes at her “It was the tiniest bit ever. “And turned back to Tom, “What did you want"
Draco bowed his head “We have become close and he has wormed his way into my life in such as short time despite that we used to be rivals a month ago...once again I'm sorry about before I don't know what I was thinking."
“Merlin that is embarrassing” Harry groaned thinking that wouldn’t have been the only thing he would have heard while he was unconscious.
What was even Harry's life right now?
Harry smirked. This was going to be way too much fun.
The easier of the two is the magic around them that was the sense of danger Harry and some of the others had acted on, it was pretty basic, hence why Snape was so irritated at the class. Harry would have expected being in tune with your own magic would have been the easier of the two, but apparently because so many people reject things about themselves, pretend to be something they are not they lose themselves to fit in and therefore become less Intune with their own magic. according to even the textbook if one was to focus hard enough, you should be able to feel you magic flowing within your body, feel it connecting to the magic around you, train it to warn you of any dangers lurking, it was another reason why wandlss magic was so rare, you had to feel the magic and then conduct it, wands were simply a training tool but over time had become a necessity as witches and wizards lost contact with their magic throughout the generations, so now only the select and more powerful few were able to amazing feats of magic without a wand.
Harry scoffed at her “The man cheated on you Mione! He has cheated on you so much we have all lost count! As your brother it is my duty to defend you honour...it beyond me why you still defend him."
“So it shall be, my Dark Prince.”
However for this moment Harry was allowing himself to enjoy the company of his friends and made a mental note to see Sirius and Remus soon, they would have been worried and he didn’t want them to do anything reckless, not that he could talk.
Tom walked over to Harry and place his hand on his shoulder sending a shiver down Harry's spine. Tom chuckled.
"Like that's ever going to happen." Pansy poked her tongue about at the boys.
Harry ruffled Draco's hair "I'll think about it, I have homework to do."
"Yup!" said Harry and Draco in harmony.
Harry nodded "Yeah sure, it will have to be on the Sunday, I have Quidditch practice on Saturday."
Hermione now had troubled look on her face, a battle was raging inside of her she was obviously scared of telling Harry." okay Harry promise not to lose your temper and that you will stay in bed" her eyes pleaded with Harry.
The walk to Tom's meeting point was a long one drawn out by silence. When they arrived Hermione and Draco went and joined there spot in the meeting and Harry stood next to Tom like he was told he had to do. He had the eyes of a hundred death eaters giving him daggers as he stood there with his head held high like Draco taught him. He acted as if the people in front of him were nothing. When he found Hermione and Draco he focused on them. He didn't really hear the meeting, just kept himself focused on his two friends, trying not to show how scared he was to be there.
As they were coming out of the dorm and into the common room they ran into Pansy who spotted Hermione first.
Before Harry could say anything, Hermione had him in a bone crushing hug. "Oh Harry, thank Merlin you’re okay". Before Harry could complain she spoke “Harry what are you doing out of bed, you shouldn’t be walking around, in your condition”
Draco chuckled “Some of your chocolate fudge."
“Oh he isn't the only one dear Ronikins".
"Maybe sometime you could join us by the lake, we tend to get a lot of work done and you can see for yourself?"
Tom nodded at Harry " I know to which you refer, those views were due to a moment of insanity my views have changed let me prove them to you.. Hermione has joined my ranks; she is currently in my inner circle... You would be to"
Neville smiled. “Anything for Harry right?”
"Hey Tom can you help me with this last question?"
Harry shuddered 'This is too weird.' He thought back hoping that the other would hear.
On the way down Harry wished with all his might that Draco was going to be okay that he was going to wake up. He forced a tear as he thought about losing Draco, he shook his head, he had to think positive!
Harry, Draco and Tom all left breakfast together, needing to go see Sirius and Remus. Of course Tom was questioned about going there the second time this morning but he had simply shrugged it off as wanting to walk Harry to classes after.
He walked toward Gryffindor tower, with a skip in his step... For once in his life he felt happy, truly happy and he didn't think anything could take this happiness away from him. Not even when Ron called him names as he entered the common room and into the boys dormitories with a huge smile on his face as he fell into a peaceful sleep… He was so glad he his family again.
Voldemort frowned at Harry's words not because Harry was in total denial but he thought saving someone life would lead them towards Harry using his real name. “It’s Tom Harry, I want you to call me Tom from now on" Harry thought about it for a few minutes but seemed to come to the conclusion that he owed the man his life. “Okay T-Tom" Harry nodded to himself.
Tom stared wide eyed at Draco in disbelief as said blondes face turned bright red, Tom never thought that the two teenagers had been spending that much time together to even develop such feelings, he glared at Draco, he had a rival for Harry's heart it seemed. He quickly composed himself once he noticed he was being watched by Hermione.
"Nonsense m'boy it will blow over, remember once a Gryffindor always a Gryffindor!"
“I can't wait to see him again, last time I saw him was Sirius's funeral"
Tom just shrugged. “I went to see Sirius before I came here, he had something to discuss with me.”
Draco and Hermione caught on and joined him in laughter, getting odd looks from the Slytherin's around him.
Harry hugged his best friend "I know he isn't, Fred and George trust him and Bill as well, they are on our side."
“We had Tom giving us daily reports about your downward spiral and I must say we are very disappointed that you dint come to us for help.” Remus added.
"You would suck too if you had Snape breathing down you neck, waiting for you to stuff up just so he can deduct points." Harry scowled.
"I will thank you." Harry spoke as he took of the hat and re-joined his friends.
He then looked at Ron square in the eyes glaring "Don't forget about your time in my dungeon back at the manor, I believed Draco and Tom had the most fun but I wouldn't think twice about sending you back, be thankful I let you go...they wanted you dead for what you did."
"Oh Harry this isn't your fault, none of this is! we all love you and I swear none of us are going anywhere, you’re stuck with us so that’s that!"
Draco smiled at Harry
Draco pouted "But Harry you love me and I need your fudge."
"Looks like Pansy will actually get worked done this year." Blaise chuckled
Harry was still confused and turned back to face Draco. “I still don’t understand.”
"Sure let me just schedule that in to when hell freezes over.” Harry snarked.
Draco put his arm around Harry "Don't worry Harry, I'll help you...anything to keep you cooking."
Hermione smiled "You both have feelings for him don't you."
So that was how Harry and Sirius spent the next five hours teaching Remus how to play various muggle board and card games they played Cluedo which Harry always won, Sirius beat everyone at Uno, each won a turn at snakes and ladders and Remus won Monopoly. Harry and Remus boy refused to play twister much to Sirius's dismay. They played battleship which Remus and Harry beat Sirius at because he always put his ships in the same spot in the hope they thought it would be to obvious and stupid for him to do it again. Sirius also demanded that they play snap no matter how many times Harry refused to play, once he did convince Harry to play, he didn't take it seriously unlike Sirius who should use magic to project his voice around the room as he yelled snap.
Harry nodded and took a bit of some chocolate slice.
Tom shook his head "that isn't necessary Harry."
"Harry Potter you better have a good excuse for being late." Hermione raised an eyebrow waiting for a response.
Harry looked shocked “Why would that help?"
Hermione chuckled "Have you told Tom yet?"
Harry smiled "You’re the only sixth year without a roommate, so I'm moving in!"
Everyone had stared at Tom when he made his presence clear, he looked like the Tom Riddle from the diary. Harry couldn’t help but think that this couldn’t possibly work, Both Dumbledore and Hagrid knew what Tom looked like back in the day.
"Why do I get the feeling you’re not surprised." Harry looked up at Hermione with curious eyes. He got no answer at first it seemed like Hermione was debating whether or not to tell him.
Voldemort smirked and before he could even speak, Harry scoffed. "You can forget My Lord, I can just call you your chosen name Voldemort but apparently it’s a taboo to say the name because everyone around here fears it.”
Draco faked being hurt "After all we have done together, you still hate me?"
Harry was looking at the other three with a nervous look; he hoped they liked what he cooked. He had cooked spaghetti and meatballs, with a secret sauce he had invented himself. He ate some off his own plate as he nervously waited. Everyone stayed quite as they ate, Harry didn't know if it was a good thing they were too busy stuffing their faces to talk or a bad thing that they hadn't said anything. He served desert and still not a word was said until the table had been cleared. He stood up and was about to leave when Draco grabbed his arm.
Harry nodded as tears of joy began streaming down his face and there was nothing he could do to stop them, they just kept falling.
Harry looked down to his feet “I wish to go back to Hogwarts with Draco and Hermione and be resorted"
"Sure we not... Expecto Patronum" A huge silvery white stag shot out of Harry's wand, he heard the class clapping as Draco reached out a pet the stag "Its beautiful Harry"
Remus apparated them back to Hogsmeade and left them alone with a promise to see them later.
Hermione smiled lightly she could never stay mad at Harry for very long “I’ll forgive you this time"
“Well he wrote to me after your confrontation with the others, he wanted you to know that he had nothing to with what they had done, at first I didn’t trust him and we just talked, he wanted to prove that he was a good guy.” She smiled “He seemed to prove it to me, but until now I was worried that it might have been a trick to get close to you but if the twins trust him then it must be true.”
"What's the matter Harry, do I make you feel uncomfortable" Harry tried to speak but all that came out were rasping breaths as Tom once again nibbled Harry ear. "Tell me to stop and I will" he started to place kisses down Harry's neck, despite the fact that Harry's mind was screaming stop, his body reacted by tilting his neck to the side to give the man better access. A groan escaped as Tom sucked on the sensitive part of his neck lightly. The next thing Harry knew he was pulled from the chair and pushed against the wall and Tom claimed Harry's lips with his own. Harry gasped which Tom talk as an invitation as Tom's tongue explored Harry's mouth. He groaned Harry tasted faintly of cinnamon, Tom guessed Harry had been cooking once again. He pulled Harry closer and Harry's hands made their way into Tom's hair messing the usually neat hair. Tom smiled into the kiss and was shocked when Harry all of a sudden pushed Tom away. "Stop" was all he said.
Harry hugged Sirius again "We can finally be a family again."
Draco nodded. "I have seen him interact with the Dark Lord, he has no regard for his own safety, it's almost like he is afraid of nothing."
Remus nodded “Not that we said anything, it’s been too funny watching them guess.”
"So the precious Potter has finally graced us with his presence." Parkinson sneered.
"You never mentioned how you look so normal and non-snake faced the last time."
Harry continued to stare at the bracelet, he thought it would seem a bit girly but it didn't, the links were thick, with closer inspection he realised that there was writing engraved into the links. He squinted his eyes and read out loud. "My little Raven."
"Fine" Harry threw his book to the floor and left Hermione by herself. He was sick of her getting back with that jerk, he knew it was her life and he had no place in how she lived it, but it wasn't the first time Victor had broken her heart and Harry always was the one to pick up the pieces just to watch her make the same mistakes over and over again. It pained him.
"I won’t say anything Potter." Draco smirked. "We might be on the same side soon after all, that and I would have to admit I spent the evening in your presence."
Harry thought about it "How about I go on probation, I'll join for a month and if I still don't agree I'll go neutral" Tom nodded at Harry “if that is what it takes then I agree... Now sleep"
Madam Pomfrey nodded. "He is healing fine, he should wake up when he is ready."
Hermione realised that Harry was serious; she gave Harry another worried look. "Voldemort, this is Riddle manor." Seeing Harry's eyes widened and his face go red she explained. " Harry he really is a nice guy, he isn't insane as Dumbledore mad us believe, he thought you were his destruction, once he learned that the prophecy was just Dumbledore manipulations, he put his soul back together and become saner then most people these days".
"No can do Drake" Harry smiled returning the hug. As soon as the embrace between Harry and Draco was over he was pulled into one with Hermione. "Jeez you guys are acting like I died and came back to life."
Tom nodded still confused. “Yeah? What about it?”
"Let me guess you have no idea how to talk to the Dark Lord via the link." He had sneered at Harry, Harry had just simply nodded and without hesitation Snape began an explanation.
"Can I leave now or is this the night that you finally kill me?"
Draco shook his head “I know those two a wicked pranksters but I never thought them evil."
“Suck!” he commanded.
'He thinks your trying ti convert them to the cause?'
"Glad that's not me anymore." Harry laughed getting up and following his friends to potions.
He looked up to find Hermione standing there, she too had tears.
"I still think he is an ass but no I was confused about the kiss anyway continue on with your story." He made a hand gesture to emphasis he wanted the rest of the tale.
Voldemort noticed that Harry wasn’t rejecting the idea completely and was for once not being disrespectful and was just distrustful and rightfully so, the anger dispersed from his body, the thickened air becoming normal once again. "If I must I can perform a wizard oath or use veritaserum, if that makes you trust my word. Secretly hoping he that Harry would use the wizard’s oath, he didn’t want to degrade himself by using the potion but it was one of the easiest ways to gain the raven haired teens trust.
"Naturally Dumbledork will recognise me in my teenage form, but he will have no proof however that I am indeed me as the wizarding world it's self does not believe in Lord Voldemort's return."
"Why w-would you do that t-to us" Molly stammered slightly.
"I'm glad you agreed to this date Harry... I thought you were going to decline" Draco said squeezing Harry’s hand.
"Congrats Neville, I always hoped you would come around to my side."
Harry and Hermione thought it was hilarious. When the three weren't pulling pranks and having fun they were in the library studying and learning new things about anything and everything. However no matter how much they asked Harry would not tell them how he had been injured; even Tom could not get it out of them, who joined them for dinner each night.
"Harry no one is going to leave you...we are all sticking with you to the end!"
"Sirius!" Hermione squealed in delight, the man hugging Harry turned his head and looked at them, "The one and only. “He chuckled
"Hey I resent that!" Draco frowned.
"Good to see you my boy" Dumbledore smiled his fake bright smile as Harry entered his office. "You wanted to see me sir?" Harry asked. Harry had been shocked after his talk with Tom when a third year Ravenclaw came up to him with a note from Dumbledore asking for his presence. At first he wasn't going to come but he wanted to know what the old coot wanted, he may be in Slytherin now but he would always be a Gryffindor at heart.
Harry yelped as he ran to meet Tom, he didn't want to be late and he would be if he didn't hurry up.
"You guys always treated us like we were stupid, you never care about us and we hate what this family has become, you are all greedy and you stole from Harry's bank... Haven't you noticed how dad hasn't been getting paid, it goes straight to Harry because he pressed charges."
Harry blushed “So you could hear me?”
He had been surprised however when Harry had mentioned his interest in instinctual magic. He had told Harry that while he had planned to go further into the subject during class, extra reading wouldn't hurt and had given Harry a list of books that he could find. One was in the restricted section and he had given Harry written permission to check it out much to the teens suprise.Snape had just sneered that it was about time that the raven haired teen had taken an interest in his studies and to leave the office before he took points from Gryffindor. Before Harry had left the room he told the teen he would inform the Dark Lord how the meeting with the Slytherins had gone before turning his back dismissing the teen.
Harry let out a grin. "So tell me Tommy are you and Snape like a thing? Or do you have a thing for death eaters? If so it’s a hard pass for me."
"I don't hate you Drake, thank you for earlier by the way... What you said it made me so happy, I'm glad I have people like you and Nev in my life." Harry gave the blonde a bright smile.
Harry nodded but the anger never left his face. "What about my friends, what happens to them?"
He took a sip of the tea Remus gave him. "Oh and Draco has been weirdly nice to Hermione they haven't had an argument in days plus he bought her this really expensive book on ancient runes that's she has been trying to get her hands on and don't get me started about Tom hiring Neville to keep an eye on me so he can use things he knows to his advantage!"
Tom nodded "She was quite obsessed with the formula so I've heard."
"Oh" silence was all there was for a few minutes
Harry shook his head. “Not at all but remember what we found out yesterday? About the bet they have about my sex life?”
Harry blushed "We’re friends Hermione."
"I have only recently learned that you are one of my horcruxes, I believe you remember out encounter at the ministry that was when I learned of your status as a horcrux, I  believe it happened that night fifteen years ago, when the curse rebounded I had no intention of making you one of them."
"I don't have time Harry, I came looking for you to tell you, Ron's awake and yelling off the castle again...why is he here?"
He positioned Harry so that he had access to Harry’s ass, this left Draco to watch as Harry was prepared by Tom. He slowly inserted the first finger, letting Harry get used to the feeling before moving it. He made sure to twirl and bend his finger stretching Harry as he moved his finger in and out, in slow movements at first before getting faster; he repeated this until he had all three fingers inside Harry. With each movement now Harry moaned.
"No? Well I spent the whole night worried that what happened to Draco happened to you! I spent half the night looking for you, until I saw you leaving the Astronomy Tower, I followed you all the way to the hospital wing."
Tom nodded.
Harry pouted at Draco causing him to laugh and Harry soon joined in.
Classes were uneventful and boring in Harry’s opinion, he wished that he had been able to convince Tom to letting him have they day off after all. It had been about halfway through the day when Harry tried to seduce him into letting him have the rest of the day off, his wish however wasn’t granted Tom had laughed and said. “Tempting though as your offer is, you can’t afford to have the day off with Dumbledore watching our every move.” Harry realizing that Tom was right had pouted for the rest of the day, but his mind was never on classes it was on a plan to get rid of Dumbledore and then getting his lovers back into the same bed.
"Oh thank god" Pansy sighed in relief.
“Im yours” Harry moaned.
"So Harry, do you have the map?" Draco asked nudging Harry
Harry smirked “Maybe you should make the requirements higher to join the ranks."
He began to put clothes on so he could leave the room when Harry had an idea. “Wait! Use the invisibility cloak to leave so the others don’t see you leave!”
When they pulled apart they both smirked at the look of lust on Harry’s face. During their talk earlier they had agrees to give the threesome a try after all, Draco and Tom used to get along before Harry and their love for Harry was the thing pulling them together.
*********************************************************************************************************************
Harry looked at the ceiling "I have no idea what you’re talking about Tom." Still trying to figure away to get out of this situation.
Hermione pulled Harry away so she could look at him in the face.
Harry pointed at the other two. “Their idea, I couldn’t resist.” He said with a huge smirk. “Besides like you can talk, I couldn’t separate you to after you came back from the dead.” Causing everyone to laugh.
Harry let a small smile grace his features, he had already been tired before his attack but now he felt ready to slip blissfully into a coma.
Tom rose an eyebrow "You won't get any help from me, if you choose to do this again, I will personally help plan your death."
That was when George leaned down and kissed Harry passionately for a few moments before he let Fred do the same.
Harry couldn’t wipe the smile off his face as the other boy turned to give him a smile.
"They both fancy him obviously!" Remus snorted. "Tea Harry?" He asked
Draco and Hermione couldn't control their laughter "Shut up you guys, it wasn't funny it was horrible...imagine walking in on your parents going at it! “Soon enough Harry was smirking at the disgusted look on their faces as both his friends minds were filled with unwanted images. "Who's laughing now" Hermione glared at Harry before returning to her work at Draco's desk. “So tell me why Hermione is working in your room Drake instead of the library"
Hermione sighed in relief as the tension between the two seemed to lower.
Fred and George burst out in laughter so much they were literally rolling on the floor clutching their sides. Before Molly could say anything Harry raised his hands. “It okay Molly, I have something to clarify with you, and you might want to sit back down."
Neville shook his head “I didn't need to, Ron was trying to stop me from talking to you... He has gone insane, don't know why you have been friends with for so long."
Harry wished he had never left his dorm that next morning. He had woken Happy in Tom’s arms they had shared a quick kiss before getting ready for their classes. However their friends had noticed Tom leaving Harry’s dorm in the clothes from the night before.
Voldemort wouldn't admit that he held his breath as he waited for the teen in front of him to finish his sentence. He wouldn't admit that he had been pacing around the manor all week, thinking about the fact that Harry was considering changing his stance in the war, trying to not even think about how he might have to destroy a part of his soul if Harry chose to fight against him after all or that the wizarding Britain would be handed to him on a silver platter if the boy chose to side with him. He knew deep in his bones that Harry would not go neutral, only for the sake of his friends, he would change sides for his friends safety or he would fight with them. However the few seconds Harry took in pausing his sentence made Voldemort regret not just taking the boy and locking him up in the highest tower, only with zero chances of anyone finding him unlike the muggle story with the girl with the long hair.
"I don’t know the full prophecy but the reason I can’t kill you is because I would be destroying a part of myself."
“It wasn't him Harry, it was Dumbledore, I have seen the memory with my own eyes."
“And they created this map that they used to get through the castle undetected." Theo announced
'Its not my fault they kept coming up to me with questions, when I said they could I didnt think they would come in a group.' Harry snapped.
"You really are becoming the next dark lord!" Arthur said in disgust
Tom smirked "It seems Potter has stolen one of my followers from me."
Draco's mouth was once again agape "Flies, Draco flies". Draco closed his mouth only to open it again. “You seem to make the impossible happen Harry; you would have to be of all the founders blood to have done that."
Tom raised his hand “I understand you’re worried about Harry. I will let it slide this time, be sure it doesn't happen again, next time even Harry will not get in the way of my wrath."
Harry had tried to bandage up the wound but nothing could stop the blood flow, his only mission right now was to get as far away from the Dursley's as he could because there was no way he was going to be at peace with them anywhere near him when he died. Harry's head had begun to spin, he knew he had only minutes to live; he was losing too much blood to survive more than an hour. Harry only had one regret was that he hadn't done more with his life and that he wouldn't be able to say any words of comfort to Hermione about his death. Hermione was the only one he was sad to be leaving behind, she had always been there for him when he needed it, she hadn't cared when Harry had chosen not to fight for the light, and she had understood and sided with Harry. Dumbledore had manipulated Harry's every move and they had both decided that they weren't going to be puppets anymore. The light had disowned them, the Weasley’s labelled them traitors.. Even Ron hated them now.
He had done this for many days but today was the day it worked.
**********************************************************************************
Harry grinned up at Draco "It’s okay Dray, your secret obsession with the Gryffindor golden boy is our little secret."
Dumbledore gave Harry a look that said he didn't quite believe him but quickly smiled. "Harry I would like you to reconsider your involvement in the war."
"What no sacrifice ritual like the one that got your body back? Now I’m disappointed."
Thanos hissed as of laughing "If you say so young one, now go enjoy the rest of the day."
Harry nodded “It almost feels like home"
The man laughed at Harry but didn't say anything. “Who are you?" Harry blurted out uncaring if he came across rude, it annoyed him that he couldn't remember where he had met this man before.
"Your idea." Harry pointed out
**********************************************************************************
Harry raised an eyebrow, "It’s hardly the worst thing this table has had on it."
**********************************************************************************
They spent the rest of the evening the usual Gryffindor way on a Friday, loud music and fun. Of course this ended at curfew due to Prefect Hermione demanding it was time for bed, usually they would ignore her but tonight Hermione had threatened everyone with a weeks detention if they didn't go to their dorms, apparently she wanted to do some studying and the noise was disruptive.
Harry nodded "I decided I wanted to pay you back for Sirius.”
"Your good friends with Draco now". Harry nodded
Harry blushed but didn't say a word, this caused Tom to push Harry closer into the wall pinning Harry there by his wrists. "You are mine Harry and I don't like sharing" he then pushed his lips into Harry's in a hard and hot kiss that once again made his knees week and his blood flow down to his groin. When Tom pulled away he let go of one of Harry's wrists, his hand traveling down toward his erection. "See I told you enjoyed it."
"Oh and your sodding rival crush you have on Potter had nothing to with it." Pansy teased.
Draco just smiled. “Whatever you say Harry.”
"I have gained the ministry's approval to take you to London's magical creatures zoo, of course with both of us being students-" he winked at Harry "we needed an escort and Remus here offered to escort us there and back again."
It was only then that the two seemed to realize that both Snape and Malfoy were still in the room. Harry had no idea why the blonde teen was even here, he hadn’t really done anything besides give Snape the excuse to have this little meeting. Harry could see Snape staring at him thoughtful, as if he had never seen him before, it unnerved him. Draco was looking between Harry and Voldemort with a please look, I guess he was considering this as a win for the dark side if Harry chose to join them.
Draco smiled "Sirius told me."
"Shit" Draco pushed aside all ill feelings for Harry for the moment and rushed to the other teens side he kneeled in front of Harry so they were face to face but gave the other plenty of space so he didn't freak the other out even more.
Hermione realised that Harry was serious; she gave Harry another worried look. "Voldemort, this is Riddle manor." Seeing Harry's eyes widened and his face go red she explained. " Harry he really is a nice guy, he isn't insane as Dumbledore mad us believe, he thought you were his destruction, once he learned that the prophecy was just Dumbledore manipulations, he put his soul back together and become saner then most people these days".
Remus walked behind the two to Hogsmeade before apparating the two to the front gates before letting them know he would be back to collect them later.
Harry put his arms up in surrender “Okay, okay sorry" He gave her a smile to reassure her “so what are you doing here then."
"Show some respect to our elders for once in your life Potter." Snape snarled.
"Write a quick summary of Golpalott's Third Law, the problem is I don't understand it to begin with." Harry gave a nervous chuckle.
Harry lay on the bed doing his latest charms homework when Draco walked into their room.
Harry finally reached the room of the requirement where Sirius and Remus welcomed him straight away. The room he entered look just like the Gryffindor common room but had no stairway just another door on the far side of the room. Harry sat by the fire with the other two and told them all about his day and they laughed and joked with each other, ordering food from Dobby when they got hungry. When Harry looked at his watch he realised he had missed the first five minutes of charms decided he would just missed the rest and claim he wasn't feeling well and went to lie down, everyone would believe it because that was the reason they had given to why he arrived at Hogwarts late. Harry, Sirius and Remus planned on how Harry could get revenge on his peers and of course it was all with a series if pranks... He was sitting with two of the marauder’s after all.
He sat on the bed sitting up refusing to lie down. "Who saved me? I have a right to know, I now owe them a life debt"
It was finally Sunday and Hermione was helping him get ready while telling him every detail of her date with Charlie, Harry was happy for his friend, he thought it was about time she found her happiness.
Voldemort raised an eyebrow slowly. "You will truly join me?"
Draco shook his head. “I don’t think so, it was like my magic was warning me about something...”
Harry laughed "You mean in your dreams you make it to the snitch before in do?"
Harry was now beyond exhausted, he didn’t even care that he was sticky as he cuddled up to the other two. This was such an unexpected development and he knew tomorrow when his brain began to work again, he would begin to over think things. But for the moment Harry was happy and content as he lay between the two, even if things didn’t work out Harry knew this moment would be one that he would always cherish and never forget.
Harry leaned his forehead onto Draco’s; Draco was still cupping Harry's cheek. “I don't know how I ever made it without you, you seem to always make me sense when I have these moments."
Pulling back breathless, the younger boy slipped his hand down Tom’s chest teasingly before it reached his naval. Harry wasted no time removing Tom from his pants and underwear and the favor was returned with hastiness. Tom gave Harry a feral grin, while pulling Draco to him and reliving the blonde from his clothes as well. Giving Harry a show he took Draco’s shirt off one button at a time, them his trousers were painfully slow to be removed. Draco’s boxers were soon removed leaving Harry in view of his most desired object.
Tom rose an eyebrow "How do you know when the attended?"
Harry opened his eyes “How did you know?" he knew that voice from somewhere but because of there being no light in the room he couldn't see the face of which it belonged to. Harry sat up and put his glasses back on.
Neville nodded "Revenge seems to be your thing lately."
Tom bent down next to Harry's ear and whispered “This is your home Harry". Causing Harry to shiver once again. Harry could tell that Tom was enjoying this.
Sirius ruffled Draco's hair “Hey cousin remember me?"
Harry was screaming profanity's at everyone at the room despite the spell being in full effect, he didn't like when people used magic to take away any of his freedom, be it by keeping him in place or taking away his ability to talk. His silent ranting soon became to much and turned into a silent panic attack, the others in the room quickly noticed the difference in the boys behaviour and removed the spell from both of the teens.
Tom scowled "Don't make me say it again, you will not speak to me that way."
Ron was the one to break the silence as he shouted "I knew it you’re not just a traitor you’re a slimy snake... And to think I let you in my house, I slept in the same room as you!"
"Harry then" Pansy giggled. "I must try this chocolate fudge Drakey poo won't shut up about."
Harry gestured to Draco and as afterthought Pansy and Blaise even though the other hadn’t said a word yet.
Harry gave Draco a small smile "Funny I don't hear anything?"
Harry looked at his best friend, who had a shit eating grin on his face as the Dean hit him upside the head and said something that Harry could not hear but it had the red head teen laughing.
Voldemort and studied the boy in front of him, he could tell the boy was telling the truth and was serious about his decision. He let out a wicked grin, and held out his hand to Harry. "Welcome to the right side of the war Potter."
Harry, Tom and Draco all walked to breakfast separately, despite the want to be as close as possible. They did however sit
"Harry what the hell did you do?" Pansy shrieked
Tom nodded agreeing with Draco. “The same applies with us Harry, I may not feel the same with Draco as I do with you but he isn’t unattractive and we have respect for each other after talking all this time, it might develop into more but it might not but we are willing to do this for you.”
"They may have been Gryffindor’s but they were legends, they should have been in Slytherin with the way they acted" Blaise stated.
Harry nodded "I don't know what is, he's just always there" Hermione nudged him "Does someone have a thing for a certain blonde?"
'That will teach them for messing with me' Harry thought.
Draco kissed Harry's temple "That brilliant Harry, soon you will be top of all your classes!"
"Boys don't talk to your mother like that!" Arthur gave the boys a stern look.
Hermione nodded "Well after Tom said that you had a misunderstanding Draco went nuts at him, he told Tom to pretty much shove it that he followed you and not him and Tom yelled at Draco and let's just say testosterone was filling the room that night was clear they were fighting over your affection!"
**********************************************************************************
Snape actually looked impressed. "This is called instinctual magic; we all have it and most fail to use it. Following ones instincts could be the very thing that saves you from a battle, people confuse themselves easily be trying to think too much during a battle but hesitate to act and it could lead to your death." Snape sneered "Everyone here should have sensed the intent to attack, that something was not right, maybe you did and ignore it, either way it doesn’t make you any less of a dunderhead, if Mr Potter of all people can do it i expect you all will."
“Harry, how is this going to work, people are not going to read the same article twice?”
Draco nodded "And so will I as long as he does."
Tom was more than mad he was furious. Hermione had told him about what Harry had left to do. Yes he would have let him do what he wished with his revenge but he wished that he had told him before he left, he could have helped make sure he was safe, that teen was too reckless for his own good.
The great hall was silent, as Harry and his friends walked in, they had arrived later than usual and all at once.. Tom had a huge smirk on his face; he couldn't wait to see Dumbledore's face. This was it they day that Harry joined Slytherin. Harry turned to Draco "This is it; I hope you have your room ready."
Harry laughed "Wouldn't miss it for the world."
“I can smell it on you! I’m a dog animagus remember?” Sirius raised an eyebrow.
The next few weeks were very weird for Harry, the Slytherins were being odd. Not once had they gone after Harry or his friends, no rude comments, no hexes, no one even interfered with his potion to cause an explosion. More than once multiple Slytherins had come up to Harry shocking everyone around him  and would quietly ask Harry questions about the spells Harry had asked them. His only guess was that they were taking their orders from their Lord seriously.
They had assumed that they had more than slept together and now wouldn’t let it drop.
Draco smirked "Didn't you just ask me to feed you?"
Draco was released allowed to return to the Slytherin Common room that afternoon but was excused from classes for the next two days to be sure of his health. Tom and Draco had disappeared the moment he returned, the others claimed they were off to have a fight to death over Harry. Harry however knew that they were talking about the little rumour that had spread about Harry and Tom. They were simply clearing the air. (Or at least to Harry’s knowledge.)
"Do you know what I did last night?" He paused waiting for Harry to answer,
Voldemort smirked at Harry "Do not insult my intelligence Harry, I know when people are checking me out, plus me and Hermione have been talking I know everything."
Harry was stuck answering questions all afternoon.
Harry closed his eyes in frustration and let out a sigh, he knew his chances were slim but he had hoped. The two men had yet to face Harry, there attention appeared to be on Draco, since it looked like Harry wasn't getting out of this weird situation anytime soon he walked around the room, until reached the Professors chair he muttered cleaning spells on the chair and desk before sitting down and leaning back and closing his eyes, despite the fact that he knew he was in a very dangerous situation with the dark lord not a two meters away from him he couldn't help but let all the tension drain from his body as he sunk into the chair, the last few days of training taking a toll on his body, the lack of sleep hadn't helped either.
Soon enough Hermione had decided on a simple black jeans and a white button up shirt. She tossed them over with his black converse.
Tom smiled “I need to see you in my study sometime today."
"I'm sorry the old coot had me blinded."
Harry then kicked them out so he could start.
"Only five?" Harry said outraged.
Tom turned toward Draco. “And here I thought we bonded while you were asleep but here you are with my little Raven.” This caused the Blonde to look at Tom instead of Harry.
"Ha you were being paid with my own money I trusted you and you threw it in my face now I'll take pleasure in watching you burn."
"He knows his stuff as well, the wat=y duels is amazing." Blaise added.
Tom messed up Harry's hair as he pulled away. "Come let’s go get breakfast."
"This was your big secret?" Draco asked
"Madam as beautiful Hermione is and that any guy is lucky to have her, she is my best friend and I would never date her, she is my sister in everything but blood."
"Uh well it's Charlie Weasley."
The man chuckled "No person sleeps that stiff now take these, it will help you heal faster." He handed Harry three vials, which Harry downed quickly having promised Hermione he would do as he was told earlier. Harry coughed the last one tasted like charcoal; he almost spit it back up... Having had much experience with horrible tasting potions from his time in the hospital wing, he didn't.
"I mean it Draco, I'm sorry for not accepting your friendship all those years ago. It is one of the biggest regrets I have in my life... You make me feel alive again when I thought it better to be dead...when I thought Sirius was dead, I wanted to die but then you came in and showed me that it was okay to be alive... I really am glad I have you in my life!"
Harry was seeing black spots, he tripped and hit his head on the pavement and there was nothing but black.
Hermione rolled her eyes “Yeah right, as if, you two have been holding in sexual tension for years!" Harry stared at her in shock “We have not! I don't have a thing for Draco... If you must know he comforted me, I was upset...he read to me until I fell asleep." Harry's face was tomato red by the time he finished the sentence "Okay I believe you, however I still think you have a thing for each other."
He smirked at Harry. “He yelled at me a few days ago for taking up all your attention by not waking up, he told me that if I hadn’t woken up within the week he would torment me until I did.”
There evil plotting turned out I be just enjoying Harry's cooking once again. Harry smiled at his friends, Harry already had a plan.
The Matron still didn't look like she believed that Harry and Hermione were innocent. So Harry said the one thing that would convince her.
Luna shook her head. “I think I’ll have some giggle water before I get a start on writing.”
Tom smirked "My name is Tom, pleasure to meet you."
Harry nodded "Can we not talk about my love life, can we have fun instead?"
"Touche"
Hermione smirked "I know you spent the other night in his bedroom"
Ginny was taking Harry's job of smashing things in the Headmasters Office. "Calm yourself, Hogwarts will welcome you"
At first Harry thought Draco was been a prat by asking the question but the look on his face showed he really want to know the answer. “Is treacle tart is your favourite dessert?" Draco nodded “How about this ill cook you dinner and treacle tart and you can answer that question."
Draco nodded "So have you been on a date with him then?"
Hermione and Harry spent the rest of the morning riding the horses and had a picnic outside in a Field filled with different types of flowers that held every colour of the rainbow it was simply breathtaking. Hermione had dragged Harry to one of the library's to Harry's dismay however they had lots of funny learning new spells by three o'clock, Harry had mastered ten new spells. Harry then dragged Hermione to the kitchen where he cooked her favourite chocolate sponge cake. Hermione adored Harry's cooking; whenever she asked how he could cook he simply would say it was something he loved to do. Hermione would have eaten the whole cake if she could if it hadn't been so filling and her not wanting her to get fat. Harry had laughed at her as he took a bite of his own slice of cake, he had complete forgot about who's house he was currently in and was lost in the moment of having fun with Hermione when a teenage blond walked in.
Hermione smiled wickedly before walking over to Draco and shoving a fork into his mouth.
Blaise chuckled. "That true, its going to be fun watching all of this unravel."
"Since Mr Potter seems to know so much, why don't you give a demonstration?"
"Ugh Harry, you really have to go and buy new clothes, these really are horrible."
Ron nodded and turned his attention back to Dean, he started dealing out cards as Harry looked away and began leaving the common room once again
Harry nodded “I believe I just told you so…twice, I love you Tom.”
"Drake" Harry hesitated
"Because I have made it clear that I clearly want something more with you and yes Harry I know you enjoyed that moment in my study just as much as I did."
Harry nodded “I swear on my magic."
Harry rolled his eyes and Hermione scowled at him as he whined. "Aww Mione, I don't want to!"
"Mr Potter come up to the front." Snape motioned without any room to argue. Harry followed the order; he stood next to the professor and looked at him questionably. "You were the first to act but were the one paying the least attention. Why?"
Harry shook his head "Since this whole fighting thing happened they can't be in the same room as each other for more than five minutes, so people are going to lose their money... And what the hell does nobody have a life, why does everyone have to be so interested in mine?"
'It's about time' He heard Voldemorts voice in his head.
Harry then hugged his best friend with a laugh “I’m here if you need me Drake" Draco leaned into the hug “I’m fine, just didn't get much sleep.”
Harry smiled sadly at Draco “I know nothing about him, we never spoke about him, I was selfish and wanted to know about my dad."
"Not really but this will teach them for turning on me every time something bad happens"
Draco raised a finger pointing it at Harry's godfather "Your dead."
Harry had laughed. Draco had also taken Harry and Hermione shopping and brought them proper wizard attire as he put it. Harry had even managed to convince him to let them buy a few pairs of muggle clothes as well; even Draco had brought some for himself.
Tom nodded. “Don’t mention it… It’s like Harry said I have a big bad reputation to uphold.”
"Well I got a laugh out of it." Harry smirked "You will to watching the others still suffer."
Harry lay awake for what seemed like hours, and he couldn't find the will to sleep. He rolled himself out of the sheets and walked up to Draco's room, where he knew Hermione and Draco would be discussing a report. He knocked on the door and was answered by a sleepy looking Draco who was just in silky silver boxers.
Harry smiled "More like you bribed him."
This time Remus joined on the laughter "Harry don't you think you should just pick one?"
"Not to mention Draco sucking up to Potter's arse, what was that all about? Blaise asked the blonde.
Hermione stared at him for a while before deciding it was okay to continue. “Voldemort thought it would be easier for me to be here when you woke up so you wouldn't go crazy."
All he could focus on was the weight of Tom on top of him, while his cock was hitting the back of Draco’s throat. He was sure that he had forgotten his name at this point.
Remus nodded. “Even if he couldn’t I would have told him.”
“Merlin Harry, you look so beautiful like this.” Tom whispered seductively in his ear. Harry shivered at Tom’s words. He couldn’t help but think what he must look like, his legs wide open and moaning after only small touches. He arched his back and let out another moan as he felt Tom’s lips on his nipples.
"Thank you so much Tom, this has been one of the best days ever."
Harry was painfully hard as were the other two but he was still confused and wanted answers. His mind was a little foggy but was determined not to give in despite Tom’s wandering hands.
Then the both walked to the library were they started studying for their new year in Hogwarts. Harry would no longer be at the bottom.
"Damn, he really joined to keep them safe didn't he?" Blaise muttered. "Damn hero complex."
The memories of Ron and Ginny had been examined and the reason they had been able to overpower Draco was because Ron had ran up to him screaming spells, and while he was concentrated on Ron, Ginny had stupefied him from behind and then began the torture. McGonagall had been disgusted and expelled them and banished them from the grounds, despite Dumbledore’s argument they had nowhere to go.. Rumour had it that Dumbledore had payed for their stay at three broomsticks. It had been lucky that McGonagall had been in charge of punishment being their head of house and as they nearly killed a student, there was no question of them being thrown out of the grounds, no matter how much Dumbledore didn't like it.
He had taken to reading and training in the room of requirement, he was getting better at wandless magic and had actually researched instinctual magic, he hoped to one day master it, intrigued by how useful it would be if he did in fact master it.
The snake hissed happily, "Oh yes I get fed and a nice warm dark place to live, if it weren't for the ugly faces every day I would be just fine."
Harry ran off before Lucius could reply. He stood their shocked for a bit before he whispered to himself "I found something."
**********************************************************************************
“Don’t hide from us Harry, your Beautiful.” Draco spoke as he licked his lips.
Once finished, he made his way back to the common room to find an angry looking Tom.
Remus had come to pick the two up with a grin on his face. "Harry when you’re done with Tom Hermione said to tell you she demands to see you."
"Well of course he has survived the Dark Lord hunting him, that's gotta take some skill, he is the only one to survive after all." Pansy replied.
Startled, she sat between her husband and Ginny who was looking at Harry as if she was daydreaming of their wedding day. Harry smirked "First of all you can cut the shit… I know"
"Um sir shouldn't you sort Tom into his house now so we can all go to our dorms, we do have classes tomorrow and it is getting rather late?" Hermione spoke while Draco nodded beside her. Dumbledore looked shocked as if he forgot they were there. "Certainly, Tom m'boy here you go." Dumbledore placed the sorting hat on his head, it immediately yelled "SLYTHERIN" Tom smiled, and some things never change.
"Draco is going to be fine Harry, he would never forgive himself if he died at the wand of Ron, and he will fight this"
Harry had only seen people use small pieces of wandless magic, summoning a small object across the room or lighting a candle, but it made sense that everyone should be able to do it, look at all the 'accidental magic' witches and wizards do before they turn eleven. Harry himself had blown up his aunt like a balloon. Maybe it was accidental magic but it was because that witch or wizard was more Intune with their emotions at that moment, focusing on whatever was making them happy or angry maybe even scared and their magic was reacting to their will. If one could learn to control that power all the time, it wouldn’t matter if you lost your wand in battle you could still fight, hell you mightn’t need your wand at all if you could perform spells without one. Harry vowed to actually pay attention when doing the essay, this subject seemed fascinating to him, which was funny because usually Snape’s lessons were dull, that hadn’t changed over the years.
The walked around the gardens, Harry admired the flowers. "Magic really is amazing" Draco chuckled but didn't say anything. The continued to walk in a comfortable silence for a while, just enjoying each other's company. Harry was the one to break the silence. "Drake did you know Sirius"
"Okay what the hell happened today...where the hell is Harry?" Draco inquired.
Tom pulled Harry into a kiss but this one wasn’t like the other kisses they had shared, this one was soft and full of emotion, meant to comfort not pleasure. Tom soon pulled away though leaving Harry with an aching feeling in his chest.
Hermione smiled “Ok since you were doing your work, but come on you have to help me it's my fist date since Victor!"
"I'm screwed!"
“But they did this because of me...” Harry argued.
Harry sighed "Not that it’s any of your business, its complicated at the moment."
"How did you know?"
Harry replied and soon laughed at the look Draco was giving him. “You talked the hat out of a sorting? That’s impossible it's never been done."
**********************************************************************************
Draco nodded "Harry gave us all a second chance even when we treated him like hell, we will stand by him no matter what, and we are his true friends!"
He ran a hand through Draco's hair absentmindedly. His hair was soft as silk and ran through his fingers like water. He smiled as Draco smiled in his sleep; it was like his small gesture of comfort drifted into his friends sleep.
After a few moments of silence Harry spoke. “Tom, why did you save me?"
Harry was glad to hear that the journals that he had given Tom had given him an insight to magic and during lunch Tom had managed to steal yet another breath stealing kiss from Harry.
"Yes, wizards deemed them more worthy of the power of magic and didn't like that goblins could do things we can't even dream of...hell most wizards are still like this and it's because they are scared."
Harry indicated that he was ready for the questions to begin. Voldemort sat in the chair opposite harry despite that the fact it was supposed to be where the student sits. "What is your full name? “Voldemort asked
Harry looked at him in confusion. “What do you mean?”
Voldemort raised an eyebrow. "You want me to kill you?"
Tom nodded, “Severus is usually the one I would give such a task to, but he is currently busy with another mission. He told me you had been the leader of a defense group last year among your peers and were highly successful, everyone in your club passed their owls and even I can admit that your friends were not the worst fighters I have seen at the ministry.”
Harry blushed as Draco frowned, this was the first time Tom and Harry had spoken of their relationship in front of him. Usually Draco and Tom were never in the same room together for more than a minute if Harry was in the room. It got Draco thinking about something that he and Tom had been talking about the last couple of times he visited his mind. Draco looked at Harry, could they pull it off?
*********************************************************************************************************************
Harry chuckled for himself as he remembered all the times these people had turned on him, they thought he was the heir of Slytherin, they though he put his name in the goblet for the fame and glory he already had despite not wanting it, they thought he killed Cedric so he would be the overall winner of the tournament then they thought he lied about Voldemort returning, mind you they still don't fully believe in his return only because Fudge had sworn his return was lie when Fudge had finally seen the truth his words had been changed all of a sudden people thought Harry or Dumbledore might have bewitched him. Then there was now because Harry had refused to fight in the war for people who wouldn't fight for their own lives. Harry chuckled again 'jokes on them' Harry thought 'I have now joined the other side'.
Tom chuckled “I would but I have idiots working for me."
Draco felt Harry's head "Are sick, you don't know what time it is? It's lunch time Harry"
Harry was looking at the other three with a nervous look; he hoped they liked what he cooked. He had cooked spaghetti and meatballs, with a secret sauce he had invented himself. He ate some off his own plate as he nervously waited. Everyone stayed quite as they ate, Harry didn't know if it was a good thing they were too busy stuffing their faces to talk or a bad thing that they hadn't said anything. He served desert and still not a word was said until the table had been cleared. He stood up and was about to leave when Draco grabbed his arm.
If it were possible Harry would have said the snake looked quite stunned. "Hello young speaker, who is your companion?"
Voldemort nodded his head. "A week from now you will give me choice and we shall discuss this deal of yours then, it would be best if you joined we could do great things."
Hermione beamed at Harry "Delicious as always Harry, you know I love your cooking since the first meal you cooked for me for my birthday, remember?" Harry laughed at her and nodded.
"Well as long as all his lessons go like today, we will ace our exams." Pansy let out a giggle.
Draco turned to Hermione "Wait you know them to?"
Harry sighed "I'm still going to get you back for telling everyone you know."
The Slytherin's overall skills were not so bad, none had been able to beat Harry but Blaise Zabini had come very close to disarming Harry in their duel, but he was the only one who had come that close to beating the Gryffindor, still
Tom waisted no time, he placed three fingers in front of Harry’s face.
Harry knew that Tom spoke the truth he didn't know how, he just knew. “I don't agree with all your views Tom".
Harry turned to glare at the Dark Lord. "The reason that I should listen to you is?"
Voldemort scowled “I should have you killed for the way you speak of me however that would waste my efforts of saving you.” The older man was silent for a moment before he smirked as he noticed Harry staring. “Like what you see Harry?”
The hat chuckled "Of course I am, and it's about time too... Took you long enough to realise it, I have been waiting for years to say this to you."
“We were just so worried.” Remus gave the young teen a smile.
Draco tightened his grip around Harry.
Harry smiled "It has nothing to do with the fact you know I have a sweet tooth?"
"Yes, I no longer wish for your death."
Harry laughed. “Aww Tom we all know that your just a big soft teddy bear!”
Before Harry had even had the chance to take a breath, let alone to tell them that was enough, that it was Voldemort’s turn now. The older man spoke again. "What do you mean by your life’s miserable?"
"But you still think your better than them."
Pansy scoffed "fun, its the chance of a lifetime i want in on the action."
“So who won the bet?” Remus asked.
"That's why I wish Tom and Draco would stop all of this, I don't have time to have a love life, I have to make them pay for hurting me."
Molly laughed "Of course!"
Draco hadn't seen Harry in days, in fact no one but Remus and Sirius had. Everyone had left the three alone so they can catch up and get up to mischief. They had even sent letters to Dumbledork to explain why they would be arriving at Hogwarts a week late. Tom thought it would be nice to give Harry time before he would have to part ways.
Harry nodded. "So I get to stay alive because it keeps you immortal"
Tom smiled at Harry " I have no reason to want you dead anymore Harry, actually I was hoping you would join me... I heard you will no longer fight for the light."
Harry leaned his head on Hermione's shoulder and sighed.
Harry entered the room to find all the Slytherin's already inside, They were standing around in various groups, the room looked very similar to the Slytherin Common room but with an empty space for said training to take place.
The Slytherins had made great progress which showed in each of their meetings Harry wad quite impressed both with them and himself for being able to yet again help a group of people learn.
Hermione smiled "Are you to a couple now Nev?" Neville nodded turning bright red.
Later on in the afternoon Harry was sitting in the Gryffindor common room talking to Hermione when Neville came up to them. "Um Harry?"
Theo raised his hand "Me too Potter, I’m willing to give you a chance." Blaise and Pansy nodded.
Tom pulled Harry away to look at him “You’re not a pawn to me Harry I'm not the old coot!"
"There are far worse things he can do to you other than death Potter."
Harry grabbed the paper from Hermione and ran off laughing, she screamed after him but it was too late he was gone. He ran to the kitchen where of course where Draco was. Harry covered Draco's eyes from behind and put on the most girly voice he could. “Guess who Drakey poo?" he heard Draco laugh and it wasn't a forced laugh either.
The others nodded. “What’s going on?” Pansy asked.
I am soooooo sorry that it has taken over a year for me to update, even though I said I would have this up in just a few days. ALOT has happened within that year. Some things good some things were bad and it got in the way of me writing. But here is chapter 2 it might not be long but something is better then keeping you waiting and I hope you enjoy :)
"You need to do something Dumbledore, the boy has gone completely out of control" Molly screeched through clench teeth. She had long since stop crying.
Harry opened his eyes expecting to be welcomed by his parents to be finally reunited with the people he had longed for most, but he wasn't he was in dim lit room, he clenched his fist into the sheets they were defiantly real this wasn't a dream. Harry looked around the room taking in his surroundings the only thing that was in the room was a cupboard a bedside table and a chair that was placed near the bed as if someone had been watching him as he slept.
Harry knew that Tom spoke the truth he didn't know how, he just knew. “I don't agree with all your views Tom".
Harry was looking at the stars from the Astronomy tower, thinking about the events that had taken place. He had finally set into place his revenge against the Dursley's, his only regret was that he would not be there to see their faces. Harry had recently found that they had known about his money all along and been taking money out of his account for years. Harry had not only been neglected and abused but he had been stolen from the people he hated the most in this world. He had contacted Gringotts and they had started the process of getting the money back, the best part was that a goblin would personally stopping by to inform them of their debt and if they couldn't pay it all back they would become Harry's personal slaves.
Voldemort continued to glare at the teen. "Call me Tommy again, and horcrux or no I will destroy you, in the most painful way possible."
Apparently he was right  when he had tried to focus on the link between him and Voldemort but just thinking about the link and actually touching the link were different, he had to will the Dark Lord to enter the connection. He had to want their minds to merge, to let the connection open. Harry had wanted to snark at the Professor that this was easier said than done, but he had kept his mouth shut and listened to his greasy haired elder.
Harry stared wide eyed at the man as he made his way to the chair opposite the dark lord "You mean, your actually coming with us... How?"
Harry grinned at Draco and Tom. “Why not see how long it takes them to notice anything?”
Draco chuckled " Longbottom said more than me, I just back him up."
Harry's eyebrow rose "Jealous are we?" Hermione shook his head "Of that prat? Never." she sighed "It's just I don't see much of you anymore."
Harry didn’t hesitate in answering the potion willing him to. "Harry James Potter."
Harry was beyond ready at this pointed and couldn’t speak coherently, so he nodded frantically with a moan.
Harry held his index finger out and smirked as he wiped it down Ron's arm, he chuckled when Ron jumped back. "Oops sorry did I get my faggot germs on you, here let me wipe it off"
Voldemort’s face went red with anger; his hair seemed to stand on end, he didn’t know whether to be more insulted by the nickname or the question. "That is none of your concern, and you are but a child, people may call me a monster but I am not that kind of monster."
"Wear that it's the only thing that looks decent and will fit you properly."
Hermione frowned "Your planning something, what are you planning?"
Harry shrugged "Not particularly, I just want this torment over with so either kill me or let me go to bed."
Harry sighed "This is so bloody confusing, I'm just going to put down what you said, I really don't get it."
Draco pulled Harry away so he could look at him and cupped his face, Draco had an angry but concerned face as he spoke to Harry.. "Now you listen to me Harry James Potter and you better darn well listen good, Ron and the rest of the Gryffindorks can screw themselves they are nothing but back stabbers and you have your true friends now, I will never leave you because I couldn't imagine my life without you either, a part of me always wanted to be your friend since first year and now I have you I'm not letting go for anything!"
Tom glared over at Harry. “I am not a teddy bear.”
"Even if the decide they are on our side I'm afraid that wont stop Voldemort Harry." He gave a a sorrowful look. "I doubt they will turn on their families, they might know their parents are wrong but for them family is everything."
Hermione scowled "Can we just get this over with, classes start soon?"
Quickly changing to a black shirt and tracksuit pants, he went to the dining room to find the others. He found everyone sitting around the table chatting among themselves. Tom was the first to look up, Tom gave him a worried look. "Are you okay Harry? Draco said he tried to wake you this morning but you were unwell, I almost went to your rooms to check on you, but Draco said you were cranky when woken and I don't want to be on the receiving end of your temper."
The group laughed, it was going to be a fun day.
Draco threw his things onto his own bed, and tackled Harry "I'm out of fudge you have to make me more!"
Harry raised an eyebrow “You’re the dark lord, have someone do it for you"
Harry returned the embrace tightly, enjoying the feeling of Tom's arms around him.
"We had a misunderstanding." They both spoke in harmony once more, causing them to look at each other in confusion.
Ron shot a curse at a Fred who dodged just in time. Harry pointed his wand at Ron and fired back. The spell hit him and slowly he vanished.
"Dumbledore, fudge, Umbridge, Mad Eye, Rita Skeeter, the Dursley’s, if you let me Bellatrix...and well the whole wizarding world."
Blaise rolled his eyes. "You have to be nice to Potter then, he might curse you before then, if you make comments like you did at the start of today's meeting."
Draco smiled at Harry
Professor McGonagall was soon behind Harry and Hermione handing them there schedules "Mr Potter, my I inquire why you are sitting here and not at the Gryffindor table."
Harry looked for the creature and smiled once he found it, it was a pale grey serpent with glowing red eyes.
"Harry and Draco, sitting in a tree-" Neville began to sing.
"What the devil are you two doing here, female and male students have separate dormitories for a reason, I will not have you defiling my wing as a secret rendezvous, this is a hospital not a sleazy motel!"
Tom frowned "So you’re raising him like a pig for slaughter, wanting him to defeat the dark lord who possess powers Harry here has never dreamed of?"
When they arrived at the twins joke shop they were in full laughter mode.
"Potter unfortunately for your plans, I did not come here to kill you but I cannot let you go, we need to talk.”
**********************************************************************************
**********************************************************************************
"Remember that we are all here for you Harry, we wouldn't be standing next to you side by side, if we didn't want to be there, you mean the world to us, you were my first friend, I'm sticking with you until the very end and even longer."
Harry took a deep breath and nodded to himself. "I choose to join you, I will not kill or torture anyone, I want to reserve the right to refuse to do a task with a valid reason. I also want to be able change my mind if I wish and go neutral and I want the people I care about safe, other than that I think we can come to an agreement."
"Harry are you listening to me?" Hermione asked as Harry continued to stare into empty space and of course she didn't get an answer because Harry Potter was not paying attention what so ever, he wasn't even aware of her presence, he was deep in thought and was lost to everyone in the outside world. Hermione scowled at her best friend he had been like this for the past two weeks and she still had no answer as to why, she could only guess it had something to do with Tom and Draco as he had been avoiding the two but as to why there was still no answer. He didn't even eat meals with them anymore, if he was hungry he would sneak into the kitchens, he went to bed early to avoid Draco and studied in the room of requirement to avoid Tom and Draco. He also had started flying more instead of hanging out with his friends, it happened to be one of the rare moments she was able to catch him the only thing was it was like he was auto pilot and didn't seem to engage in anything but staring into empty spaces.
Draco gave a smirk "You leave it and I'll eat it". To prove his point he shoved chocolate slice in his face in a very unMalfoy like manor. Once he finished he looked at Harry in all seriousness. "You going to bother the Weasley's tomorrow?"
Hermione was staring at the three of the intently. “Tom usually waits for Harry as well. But today he arrived after Draco.”
Harry nodded allowing Tom to continue.
Draco shook his head "You really are an idiot you know that, I was a prat when we were younger, I should be the one apologising not you, but thank you... I'm always here for you Harry Potter."
Draco nodded "Okay but about the kiss the other day, it clear by the way you have been avoiding me that you don't feel the same so let's go back to just friends."
Before anyone could say or do anything, he Fred and George apperated, not before they set fire to the house of course, where would the fun be if they didn’t?
Harry smiled "Really?”
Draco's eyes widened as he swallowed the cake he looked between the cake and Harry. “Merlin that was amazing, I have never had better... Potter, can you cook treacle tart or is it only cakes that you can cook?"
Tom nodded. “Had to torment you somehow I am a dark lord.”
Harry shook his head at the Tom Riddle looking Voldemort. "It's just your appearance came as a shock, you’re not a snake mutant anymore"
“Yeah to stay away from me.”
Harry sighed. "Does this information change anything else, am I free to live my life as I see fit."
”you’re keyed into the wards".
Tom face palmed "Of course I should have known that with your reputation you would have already come across a class three magical creature."
The two parents were shocked. “FRED AND GEORGE WEASLEY I GAVE BIRTH TO YOU I AM YOUR MOTHER AND YOU WILL SHOW YOUR FATHER AND I SOME RESPECT"
"It's a good one I promise." Harry smiled.
**********************************************************************************
He was still consumed in his thoughts when he ran into someone. He looked up to see a disgruntled Lucius. "Sorry Lucius" he was about to walk away when Lucius spoke.
This continued for a few moments before Tom pulled his fingers from Harry’s mouth.
Voldemort nodded. "They are under orders not to harm you anymore, while I can not vouch that all of them will listen to this demand, any who stray will be punished."
Tom glared. “If you weren’t Harry’s friends I would curse you in a minute.”
Harry nodded “And a godson and pretty much a nephew for another."
Harry sighed "The memory you choose has to fill you up with happiness to the point you can channel it through your wand."
Harry chuckled "You sure about that?"
"They need to be controlled they are a danger to the statute of secrecy but I don’t want them dead like Dumbledore would let you believe."
Harry then embraced Draco in a tight embrace.
Draco nodded "True she is a super human; however you have always been better at Defence against the dark arts and cooking!"
Harry made his way to the Room of Requirement, feeling like it was kind of a betrayal to have the meeting in the Dumbledore's Army old training grounds but with a lack of a better option, he really didn't have a choice in the matter, not to mention he had swapped sides in the upcoming war nothing could be a bigger betrayal.
"Veritaserum but I want to test it first so i know it is really what you say it is."
Harry looked at the parchment with shock for a second before smiling up at Tom.
The twins agreed. Despite them initiating the kiss, it was a spur of the moment thing to annoy the Weasley’s, they hadn’t considered that there were kissing Harry until after.
Rita frowned. “The truth about what, dear boy?”
After a few moments of silence Harry spoke. “Tom, why did you save me?"
After Tom left the three went to Harry's room and got more acquainted. Harry learned Draco wasn't such a prat, he and Hermione still argued but it seemed more as fun then an actual argument. Draco learned about why Harry left the light and Draco told Harry about his home life. Soon Draco went home promising to return soon with decorations for Harry's boring room. Hermione and Harry talked about how weird it was to be in the dark lords home and friends with Draco Malfoy their school rival.
Luna smiled. “Let that stop them from giving you one.”
Harry laughed as she vanished from their site. Harry turned to Draco and his hysterical laughter started again. “We need to clean up now, before anyone else see us like this." Draco nodded smiling wiping one last piece of icing right down Harry's shirt. “Now we are even" he poked his tongue out before heading out for a shower.
Harry nodded "I won’t."
The elder rolled his eyes. "I couldn’t care less about your so called friends, if they were to stop fighting against my reign there would be no need to kill them."
Harry nodded for Hermione to continue. "Well Draco was really worried when you didn't come down to dinner when he voiced his concerns Tom told him something happened between you-"
"Where do you live? And this time try to lie."
Draco rolled his eyes "You’re hardly the golden boy."
"You’re siding with him?  The filthy snakes that made your life hell?" Ron snarled
Harry looked at his watch and swore loudly, "Shit, I'm late I promised to help Hermione pick out an outfit for her date, I'll talk to you later."
Hermione nodded as that was all she could do she was in hysterics
"Th-anks" Harry's voice was croaky from the screaming plus the panic attack. Draco moved away from Harry.
Harry shivered “Don’t call me that, I can take care of myself. I faced you on multiple occasions and survived didn't I?"
Harry shook his head, grinning "Nope the two remaining maurders helped me plane it."
"How can I believe you, you have done nothing but try and kill me since I was nothing but a baby? How do I know you speak the truth and not trying just trying to get me to lower my guard?" He didn’t snark, or have any venom behind his words, he was merely being cautious not really believing the words he had just heard.
"Accio sorting hat!" Dumbledore yelled.
Beside Tom stood Remus and Harry was really confused but continued to walk over to Tom. Tom wrapped his arm around Harry's waist.
"Hello Tom."
Harry laughed but raised his hands up in surrender. "Okay no more Tommy gotcha, what do I call you?"
"I choose...” Harry repeated again.
"Draco shook his head. "I'm not allowed to go into detail what happened, but Potter seemed intrigued by the idea of a peaceful end rather than a war, keeping the people he cares about safe is part of it, but I get the feeling there is more to it then that."
He sat there reading for hours, he could see other blokes being uncomfortable but he had told Draco that he was gay weeks ago, when he told him he was scared he was going to lose his new friend but Draco had laughed and said he could tell because he was too. This had made Harry nervous was he really that obvious that he was gay. Tom and Draco had known come to think of it when he outed himself to Hermione she had said the same thing. He told Draco that he had told the dark lord he wasn't gay and Draco laughed “I bet he saw right through you".
Harry rolled his eyes at his blonde friend. "The sorting hat tried to sort me in Slytherin"
"Don't give me that bullshit, Harry would never miss our reactions to the food he made, in fact he loves it...so let me ask again what the fuck happened?"
Hermione nudged Draco "Honestly do you have a death wish, since when do you act like a Gryffindor and acting before you think?"
Harry and Luna were soon approached by a very excited Rita Skeeter. “Harry how happy I am too see you again.” Rita had come gliding over and sat down next to the two friends.
"Hermione what happens when someone else gets hurt or worse killed because of me, I have lost too much already, I can’t lose anyone else! I couldn't bare it if I did!"
Harry rolled his eyes, "She wants details of our date"
'I was called into Dumbledore office, this morning.'
Harry hissed his greetings. "Hello there, my names Harry."
"He isn't m-my mate!" Harry stuttered.
Harry reddened "What makes you say that?" Harry skilfully managed to look everywhere but at Hermione.
Harry shook his head "Draco, if this is too much... Just say the word."
Sirius was in hysterics "Hahaha holy hell they still do that, I remember James trying to get Lilly's attention he did the same thing after he read about it in a magazine!"
"It is so simple it will work, this way I can make sure, you dear one, are safe of the man’s clutches"
"Why would I avoid you because of that?"
Harry nodded “No nicknames, Tom or Voldemort only, got it.”
Harry sat up slowly every part of his body ached as if he had been hit by a train and brought back to life. He pulled up his shirt to check his wound, to find he now had a fresh scar. Harry sighed that's just what he needed another freaking scar. He swung his legs around to the side of the bed, slowing standing, and placing one foot in front of the other in a sloth like motion. Finally reaching the door he twisted the handle. In front of him was a long hallway filled with rooms. As he was about to step out from the room he was in the one opposite him opened in a rushed movement. He braced himself to be attacked as much as he could without his wand. However the person who appeared in front of him had long bushy brown hair.
Harry's face was a bright red, Tom grabbed Harry around the waist and squeezed.
Tom pulled Harry into a tight embrace.
It had scared Harry how close the two girls had gotten over the last couple of weeks, he was glad of course but between Pansy and Hermione they could bring down anyone.
Hermione smiled wickedly "Basically the same thing Harry, either way it makes you look hot, so who cares?"
Harry eyes widened he had just learnt about Voldemort’s making a horcrux or seven from Dumbledore, the night before. "Why would you make me a horcrux of all things that seems pretty stupid?" He didn’t realise that with that statement he had just told Voldemort that he knew what a horcrux was and there was only one way that he would have learned such information.
Harry shook his head as he untangled himself from the two as he sat up. “It’s not that at all, I quite enjoyed last night.” The two smirked at Harry and Harry continued. “I’m just not sure how this is supposed to work? I mean you and Draco were both fighting over me a few weeks ago and I have so much to worry about.”
Harry did last minute touch ups to his homework before going to bed.
Tom kept close to Harry for the rest of the night, he helped him study and when Harry announced he was going to bed, Tom followed stating he wanted to talk to the raven haired teen alone. The others made kissing faces as the two left causing Harry to give them the finger and the dark lord to smirk. He wouldn’t mind a kiss from Harry.
“Everyone knows your my friend, I need her to back up the story otherwise people might believe that what we are telling isn’t the truth, Rita has a lot of sway with the readers, we unfortunately need her.. It worked well enough in fifth year.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Happy for a front page story, you mean?”
"Where's Tom?" Harry couldn't see the Dark Lord anywhere.
He offered the strawberry to Harry but when Harry tried to grab it he pulled away. Harry laughed "You are so not feeding me."
Draco slapped Harry playfully "Sometimes I wonder why I put up with you."
Harry, Fred and George were standing outside of the Burrow. Harry had no idea how he had ever felt comfortable here the whole place practically screamed to his magic that it was unwelcome but being Harry he ignored it. Fred and George opened the door leading Harry through the door he had walked through many time before as if he never had.
"Oh Merlin, two speakers in one day! I'm so lucky, it's I who has the pleasure of meeting you Tom and Harry, my name is Thanos."
Draco blushed "Excuse me I was not"
Tom shook his head, "No, it's just that with your reputation I thought you would want to see a Hippogriff or something."
Dumbledore nodded "yes Harry indeed, I merely wanted to know how life in Slytherin is treating you... I was growing worried I haven't seen you on the great hall fir sometime, you seem to be avoiding your housemates and I must say I assume the worst."
Hermione laughed “Your telling me"
Harry woke and he felt much better, he thought he could run a marathon if he was a faster runner. Hermione came to visit, when she was satisfied that he was well enough she gave Harry the tour of the manor. It was huge! There were over a thousand rooms, there were bedrooms, studies, libraries, some were empty some had random things placed inside them. Harry was mesmerised he had never been in a house this big before. Outside he had a Quidditch pitch, lake and a stables. The land could fit three of manors inside and still have plenty room for everything else. Harry wandered where Tom got all the money to afford this place but then he thought about how Tom was the dark lord and could do anything he wanted.
"Get away from my son Potter." Arthur snarled
Harry nodded and looked down at his hands. “I don’t know how this will turn out but I will do it.”
Harry was soon wandering around Hogsmeade with Tom and Draco by his side, they had nagged him for a while, both wanting to know what the other was up to but Harry insisted it was a surprise and that they would find out with the rest of Wizarding World. They had an enjoyable afternoon, now that Draco and Tom had joined forces instead of fighting over Harry, Harry had found it pleasing to be around the both of them again, very pleasing indeed.
Harry held his head high "I can't help it if no else can cook better than me."
Harry nodded "Okay…"
"Don't make me take them back." Snape growled and shut Harry up.
No one said anything but continued to watch the three in confusion not once did anyone look away, they all seemed to be waiting for the secret to be found out but not one of the trio said anything regarding their actions. Harry complained about having to go to classes while Draco got the day off, Hermione made sure that Draco would be doing work so that made Harry feel a little better.
Harry stared at the map for a few moments, before grinning "Can we go see the Ashwinder."
"Because that's when the trouble started and finished, rumour has it that they taught peeves most of his tricks."
Harry smirked. “Only you to know, we have made things clear that something is going on but no one has yet to realize or if they did no one said anything, which is unlikely considering that there is money involved.”
"So you can bring him back?" Tom asked
Harry smiled widely “Remus"
They smirked, it was starting already. “Actually technically, she is not our mother, so we can talk to her however we want to... Arthur"
Harry grinned. “Make sure that you do, I want to ruin Albus Dumbledore, but you must leave that out, make it seem like, I was unsure to tell you but I have broken free from his strings and becoming my own person.”
Harry was storming down the steps when he was me by none other than Ron Weasley and his mother and father.
"Enough, Potter this is important, once we get this conversation over and done with you can be on your merry way I assure you." Voldemort spoke before the argument could escalate.
They all then one by one floo to the headmaster’s office. "Harry m'boy... I'm glad you’re feeling better now." They had told the old coot that Harry had become seriously injured and Hermione helped him, it wasn't a whole lie, it just happened a long time ago. "Me too sir...” Harry gestured toward Tom. “This is the person who save my life Tom Gaunt" Dumbledore frowned at the sight of Tom but didn't say anything “Well thank goodness you saved our young mister Potter, mister Gaunt...he plays a vital role in the upcoming war."
"This is going to take some used to... Seeing you every time I go to bed."
The man laughed at Harry but didn't say anything. “Who are you?" Harry blurted out uncaring if he came across rude, it annoyed him that he couldn't remember where he had met this man before.
Harry smiled brightly clearly the excitement had caused him to forget about earlier.
It wasn't hard to say that Harry didn't sleep well; restless sleep was what he was given after a very tiring day.
The lesson passed surprisingly quickly, Harry had been so focused on their topic that he hadn’t even thought if his dilemma, or goof off with Ron, who had done nothing all lesson as a sign of protest against the professor and was annoyed that Harry had actually seemed interested in the dungeon bats lesson. After defence they had charms, this time Harry didn’t pay too much attention, his focus was touch and go between the lesson and playing hang man with Ron. Lunch he was to focused on his thoughts again to really eat, he ate half his ham and cheese sandwich before calling it quits. He noticed Hermione eyeing him from across the table, but avoided eye contact, he knew she would ask what was wrong eventually but he didn’t want to make it any sooner.
"You seek my presence Harry." Tom smiled
Draco nodded "Oh I see a misunderstanding...what the fuck a misunderstanding would not mean he would lock himself in his room now tell me right now what bloody happened!"
Harry stormed out of the room leaving behind a very shocked but pissed off Dumbledore.
He sat there until the others were ready to acknowledge him, which didn't take long, only the few minutes it took for Draco to wake up. The blonde had looked around the room confused and when his brain began working again he spoke "Oh My Merlin, please tell me I fainted and imagined what I thought I just saw."
Neville then left Harry on that note, to think about what it was exactly he was doing.
Harry nodded. “Sure, why not? It’s time to show the world that we are a family.”
Draco Malfoy stayed behind to ask Harry a few questions about the shield charms, He was one of the few who had taken the lesson seriously and had paid attention, Harry wasn't surprised, given how close the blonde was  with Voldemort and his inner circle, he was avoiding punishment. After answering, Harry offered to help him or any of the Slytherins with any other questions or pointers they had in between meetings, informing the Blonde that he usually spent an hour down by the lake by himself before curfew most days.
Harry smiled and tears appeared in his eyes, he had no idea how Draco had found out about the first date that James had taken Lilly on but it was the sweetest thing anyone had ever done.
He knocked on the door, when the reply for him to come in Harry could swear he stopped breathing all together, despite his nerves he still opened and entered the room, with his head help up high, heart in his chest.
So she did the only going she could think of and kicked him in the shin. He jumped back in pain causing him to fall and bump his head on the ground. Hermione couldn't help but giggle, he had deserved it after all. "OW Hermione! What the bloody hell was that for?" Harry got up rubbing his shin and the back of his head. "You are being a git! I hardly see you for the last two weeks and when I do you completely ignore me!"
He sat on the bed sitting up refusing to lie down. "Who saved me? I have a right to know, I now owe them a life debt"
"In your dreams potter!"
"Tell me that it isn't delicious."
Harry nodded sadly he had been hoping Draco could tell him something after all Harry had always spoke about James with Sirius, it had never been about him... Harry regretted that a lot.
Harry the proceeded to act as if he was brushing off something of Ron's arm the same one he wiped his finger on. "Your just a bunch of homophobes that need to grow up, it's not like it's hurting you in anyway so grow up!"
Hermione eyes widened "Merlin it was that long ago and you didn't tell me... Shame on you Harry Potter and to think I thought it was my fault you didn't show because of our fight about Victor!"
Harry sent an affirmitve down the link, ot continued like that for a few minutes before Hermione started to look at Harry funny when he laughed at a comment Voldemort had made.
Draco smirked "Finally he admits it!"
Harry shook his head “I couldn't sleep, I was hoping that you guys would still be to keep me company."
"Really, hey maybe next time you feel sad I can get mother to tell you stories about Sirius, show you photos, I would get her know but she is in Paris."
He met Tom at the entrance hall; Tom had been standing around waiting for him, with all these girls standing around giggling from afar as they watched him. Harry had wondered why they didn't just meet at the common room and he now knew why.
Hermione frowned "I'm sure not everything I know is correct."
Tom smiled "You’re very welcome, it will protect you from nearly every curse, it will warn you if any of your food is dosed, plus it is an emergency portkey, say portkey in parsletongue and it will transport you to where ever it is you think of first."
Harry laughed; he just couldn't help it, soon enough Hermione joined in.
Tom smiled "I would love to, what's the Question?"
Harry nodded and Tom held his hand, "Come let's take you to Honeydukes, I know all about you and your sweet tooth."
"You save the people you care about, that doesn't make you the prince of Gryffindor."
Voldemort stood. "Speak to me with our mind link, with enough practice you should master it easily enough, if you have trouble just speak to Severus or one of the Slytherin's to pass along a message."
Tom rolled his eyes "Says the boy who can hardly survive a stabbing wound from a muggle."
"Nothing” Was his quick response.
"Wh-what's w-wrong Harry" Draco yawned “Hermione left about an hour ago if you’re looking for her."
Harry woke with a start, the door to his room opened, he pretended to sleep but peaked through slightly, it wasn't Hermione, and the person came closer to Harry. Harry's eyes immediately shut hoping the person would leave thinking he was asleep; his whole body was tense as he waited. The person sat in the chair, he seemed to be waiting for something, and Harry didn't dare to move a muscle. "Relax Harry it is simply just time for your potions."
Harry laughed. "Why not, what's he going to do? Kill me? News flash he wants me dead already."
Rita now had a devilish gleam in her eyes as she smiled wickedly at Harry. “Well Harry, let’s start at the beginning.”
Draco sat up confused. “I’m more than willing to help you with anything Harry. I have grown to love you Harry Potter, you should know that by our feelings that feelings can change quickly we became quick friends within days when we used to be enemies.”
Tom smiled at Harry " I have no reason to want you dead anymore Harry, actually I was hoping you would join me... I heard you will no longer fight for the light."
Harry continued to stare at the bracelet, completely forgetting that Tom still hadn't let go of his hand, until Tom began rubbing circles on the back of Harry's hand over the scar that the blood quill had left him. Harry then began focusing on the heat that Tom's hand was bringing to his, he began to blush which caused Tom to smirk at him, which didn't help at all it just made Harry turn an even darker shade of red.
Harry stared at Draco, he had never thought about that, until now. “I can apparate on Hogwarts grounds"
"Out of the question, Harry Voldemort is as gay as they come; he admitted it when I questioned him". Harry was too shocked to say anything, Voldemort was gay? That sounded weirder then him courting Hermione.
"How was I to know that he would have a wand shoved up his arse tonight?"
Draco scoffed. “You just kept telling me to wake up already.”
Tom raised his eyebrows "The serpent?"
Everyone laughed, including Tom.
Harry gave Ron an apologetic look. "Sorry mate, gotta go, I am running late for a meeting." He gave Ron the look as if to say he had a meeting with Dumbledore, knowing that his friend would not question it, he hated lying to his friend but it was not like he could tell him that he was actually about to spend the next couple of hours with a group of Slytherin's.
Voldemort eyebrows rose as he stared at Harry, his former enemy was laying I front of him, he saved his life and all he had to say was that he had hair. “Really that's all you have to say."
Ron glared at Harry "Wow everyone look the second dark lord has come back, sorry if I'm not leaping for joy mum"
Harry nodded and stood up; as he reached the exit he turned back to the three in the room. "I won’t talk about what happened, but I’m not going to hear the stuff I said while under the serums influences in the rumour mill will I?" He looked between the three nervous
Tom returned the hug "I would do anything for you Harry and more, anything that makes you happy."
**********************************************************************************
Harry shook his head "No I'm not going to die in some stupid war Professor, this war started before I was born...you deal with it!"
Harry and Draco were sitting by themselves by the lake, the others were currently trying to explain to an angry Hermione why they hadn't done their potions essay.
Once they were in Harry’s and Draco’s room, the door was locked and charms placed upon it so no one would enter or hear what activities were happening inside.
Draco had his turn to roll his eyes "Please shut up, I think I'll throw up otherwise."
Harry walked to the great hall with his friends with a new spring in his step, the colour seemed to return to his cheeks and a permanent smile was glued to his face. He was also walking hand in hand with Tom, who wouldn’t let go since they left the hospital wing. Harry didn’t mind though, despite being in his funk for the past couple of weeks and being too worried about Draco, he had missed the big bad dark lord. Who he sat next to at dinner, as he laughed with his friends, a weight had been lifted off his shoulders the moment Draco had awoken. He would get revenge on those who hurt his friend. Being expelled simply wasn’t enough; he would be contacting Lucius before the week was up. They had planning to do after all. They would not be allowed to get away with this.
Harry smirked "Been there done that." he whispered to Draco who chuckled
Hermione laughed "Merlin you guys are thick."
Harry rose his eyebrow at Draco "Oh, so what does that make me then?"
Harry woke with a start, the door to his room opened, he pretended to sleep but peaked through slightly, it wasn't Hermione, and the person came closer to Harry. Harry's eyes immediately shut hoping the person would leave thinking he was asleep; his whole body was tense as he waited. The person sat in the chair, he seemed to be waiting for something, and Harry didn't dare to move a muscle. "Relax Harry it is simply just time for your potions."
"I saw you by the lake, you were asleep in his lap, he was running fingers through your hair, I just assumed you were together."
"Yes I better be included in this to Harry." Harry turned to see Draco bowing at Tom. Harry rolled his eyes “Looks like I'm cooking for four".
“I am so sorry Draco, this is my entire fault, I didn't mean for you to get hurt! You were there for me when I needed it, so I'm going to stay here all night by your side"
Harry smirked "Oh he's in Voldemort's dungeon now, chained up I believe if the spell worked fine, hope he doesn’t annoy anyone, or get blood everywhere... You see Molly I won't stand harm to come of my family... Oh and I'm evicting you from this property, as of a week ago I own this disastrous excuse of a house".
Hermione shook her head "I know, no matter what I say he won't listen."
"Harry why have we got Tom and Draco asking our permission to court you?"
Draco nodded. “Im only just finding out about this bet but count me in.”
Draco picked up a book from his night stand Harry groaned as he showed him the cover.
“I’ll have you know all of Gryffindor adored Harry's cooking, he has a talent for it."
"Don't mention it. Like at all." Draco smirked.
"Sometimes I think you will be the death of me, Harry."
When Pomfrey was happy with Draco’s condition she left them alone. Draco had then opened his arms for Harry who rushed over to Draco allowing the other to tightly embrace him. He hid his face in the boy’s neck as he sobbed onto the other boy. “Harry, shhh its okay, I’m here now.” He repeated as he rubbed circles down the boys back in an attempt to comfort him.
“So beautiful.” Tom muttered.
Draco walked over to his bed patting the spot next to him. “Come I'll read you to sleep"
They spent the night feeding each other the chocolate dipped goodies. After a fly around Hogwarts and a seekers game in which Harry beat Draco to which Draco blamed Harry for being a distraction. They lay on the pitch watching the stars taking about anything that came to mind. They talked about the past, they picked on Ron, came up with pranks and everything else they could think of. It was midnight before they decided to call it a night and head back to their room.
“Don’t act daft mum he knows how you guys are all treacherous bastards." The twins intervened
Harry leaned into Draco once he finished eating pushing the rest of his pancakes away; his head rested on the others shoulder, none of the others seemed fazed by this action, as Harry and Draco had done this kind of thing all the time. “I think I ate too much.” He had said with a groan. That was Tom’s cue to lean over and wipe Harry’s lips with his thumb, removing left over maple syrup from the, before placing the finger into his mouth with a hum. He gave Harry a smirk. “Sorry, Couldn’t help myself.”
Tom's hand forced Harry to look at him emerald eyes met brown and they seemed to be piercing a hole into his head.
Harry's grin widened. "No! This is wonderful! I did go to a muggle zoo once but I didn't really get to enjoy it. And I've never been to magical zoo."
"I thought perhaps, living with muggles growing up, that you had likely never been to a magical zoo and that you might like the chance to see one. Was I mistaken?” Tom asked as he paid the attendant for their entrance.
"We should probably get ready for class, Dumbledore won’t let us have the day off after yesterday."
"I said I didn't want talk about it Harry, It’s complicated and none of your business.”
"Oh come on Harry they both really fancy you, there are bets out there that their feeling as so strong that they would put aside everything for you."
Harry chuckled "Hey to you to."
**********************************************************************************
Sirius said as soon as he walked into the room of requirement.
Molly had shrieked that he was a disgrace to wizard kind and how he had gone too far by discrediting Dumbledore. Dumbledore had nodded with Molly but not commenting, knowing it wouldn't be wise with witnesses. Basically Molly had made a fool of herself. Harry had sat there completely calm, ignoring the hag and the old coot. He just continued as they were not there, talking and laughing with his friends. When he insulted Ron and Ginny, Molly really lost it, spit went flying as she screamed, but Harry still ignored her however she still continued until she was blue in the face. Everyone was looking at her and Dumbledore, from the moment they walked, and that was how everyone found out that Harry was breaking away from Dumbledore because, he had left Harry with abusive Muggles.
"Hey! Don't look at me, I wonder the same thing." Harry grinned as he laid his head on Draco's lap "You’re the one who was obsessed with me after I refused to be your friend"
He also mentioned to the Goblins that he wanted to be emancipated, and have Dumbledore's right over him stripped. The goblins gave the kick the Ministry needed to get that started. When Dumbledore had been informed it hadn't been a pretty sight, he had come bursting into the hall, with Molly trailing not far behind, and both were red in the face and looking like they would murder anyone who got in their way.
**********************************************************************************
Harry was seeing black spots, he tripped and hit his head on the pavement and there was nothing but black.
Hermione turned to the Slytherin’s "How do you know so much about them?"
Harry began to fist his own erection unable to whilst moving to bite and nip at Draco’s back as the blond pleasured Tom. Soon Harry joined Draco in licking Tom, leaving the other so stimulated with pure pleasure. He moved so that he lying on the bed and motioned for Harry to join. Harry lay on top of Tom, who quickly inserted himself inside of Harry. Harry’s back was pressed up against Tom’s chest when he started to move. True to his word from last time, Tom didn’t hold back as he pounded into Harry’s arse, while Harry was sucking off Draco. It didn’t take long before Tom came inside Harry. This caused Draco to smirk…it was his turn. The two quickly positioned themselves so that Harry was straddling Draco, the blonde moaned as he entered Harry, he was still wet from Tom’s cum. Soon Harry was riding Draco faster with each move, Draco was thrusting in time with Harry’s movements causing him to go deeper inside him. The moans were so loud it was a good thing they had put the charms up in case of anyone hearing them. Tom came and kissed Harry as he rode Draco, it wasn’t long until they both came together loudly. Harry couldn’t help but laugh to himself after and when he was asked what was funny he answered with.
Harry hadn't exactly been welcomed back the night before as the left over Weasley’s had been spreading rumours since school started. Harry gestured for Hermione to follow and walked across the hall and sat next to Draco at the Slytherin table, Hermione sat on the other side of Harry, making her next to Pansy, who most to everyone's shock gave Hermione a sweet smile. "Drakey poo has told us everything, nice to have you with us Granger, you too Potter."
The two pounced on Harry. Harry let out a shuddering breath, trying to calm his rapid beating heart. Harry pulled Tom into a deep kiss, he could feel Draco kissing and nipping on his neck as he kissed Tom. He wasn’t sure what was going to happen but he knew that Tom and Draco would guide him with what to do. The next few moments would forever be imprinted in Harry’s memory.
Tom got up and walk behind Harry, placing his arms on each of Harry's shoulders he bent down and nibbled on Harry's ear, causing him to shiver. “You never stand a chance against me." Harry felt Tom's breath against his ear and shivered once again, it took all his might to cover the groan that was trying to fight his way out.
"Harry tends to suffer nightmares, I spared us both the lack of sleep by sleeping next to him."
Harry nodded but didn’t say anything.
"So who's your mystery date anyway?"
None of them would stop their teasing, not even when Tom death glared them. When Hermione and Neville had joined them for breakfast Pansy had blurted out that Tom and Harry had sex the night before.
"Hey Harry, come and kick Dean's ass in a game of exploding snap with me!"
Tears returned to Harry's eyes and this time he couldn't stop. He fell to the ground, his legs unable to hold him anymore. Draco crouched down and pulled Harry into a tight embrace, rubbing soothing circles around his back. "Shhh Harry it's okay, you have people who love you here with you"
Harry missed any other comments as they turned toward the Slytherin Common room and he continued on to Snape's office.
Tom, Draco and Hermione had dinner together, all three were well aware of the brunette missing presence. Draco was confused he could see the look of guilt on both Tom and Hermione’s faces both thought it their fault that Harry hadn’t shown up for dinner, leaving a house elf to serve his creations.
"No! You and your mate are very pretty faces, you be making very attractive hatchlings."
Draco smirked and leaned closer to Pansy and whispered "Oh I think there will be." Pansy giggled quietly.
“Why do I suddenly think you joining me is a bad idea?” Voldemort groaned.
Harry spoke to Rita and Luna for over two hours, both asking questions, which Harry answered freely, Rita was ecstatic. “Oh Harry, I have so much here that I can’t possibly write only one edition, I have them weekly, leaving the readers itching for the next one each time!”
Harry laughed “I did, since we are friends now" Draco looked shocked at first then smiled.
“I am capable of walking down to the great hall by myself.” Draco scowled.
The other three commended Harry on his caution but also couldn’t help but think he was an idiot, what if the poisoned the potion they were to give him, not that they had any intention of doing so. Snape left to grab some from his storage. While the others stayed in awkward silence, Draco still standing in the background wondering why he was still here but didn’t dare make a move like harry had done only moments before.
Harry smiled at Voldemort’s confused face. "Despite having your own reasons behind it and the consequences of the choice I make being life or death for not just me but the people I care about , you gave me the choice to decide, for once in my life I got to call the shots on what happens in my life, I want that more than anything, freedom to be myself." He paused. "And who knows maybe if we worked together we could make the wizarding world a better place for everyone, not have it one sided anymore, pureblood, half-blood or muggle borns maybe we can make everyone feel welcome."
"That’s stupid."
Draco turned back to Harry “Who said you could call me that huh?"
"I'm glad to share this experience with you, then," Tom said, pleased at Harry's response. "Where would you like to go first?" Tom asked as he handed Harry the map.
“Harry if that was so, I wouldn’t have woken up with you reading to me.”
Harry nodded. “That’s true but they were friends well at the very least most of them were and the Slytherin’s hate me.”
Harry grabbed her hand "Come on; let's go get you ready for date with your Prince Charming."
Harry yawned so Hermione left him to sleep, with strict orders not to leave the bed before kissing him on the forehead and promising to visit him tomorrow. Harry let his head rest on the pillow and slowly drift to sleep.
"I'm not something to be won Draco."
Draco sneered "He is the boy who lived, they properly didn't want to hurt his little feelings."
Pansy smirked "Nothing because I know just how much you love it!"
"I'm guessing the second part of your plan is complete?"
The rest of the lesson was the other practicing finding a happy memory and trying to perform the patronus, Harry sat and watch Tom actually succeed in performing his own patronus in the form of a snake Harry watched as he it came and wrapped around his shoulders, it felt warm and made Harry feel really happy all of a sudden. He chuckled at Tom "I'm surprised you’re able to perform this charm Tom, what's your happiest memory?"
Harry raised an eyebrow "You want to talk school?"
He had one more step left before he was free but Snape being Snape had been aware of his every move spoke before he could take it. "Not so fast Potter...”
"I just think he will be a big part of making history, changing things for the better, with him and the Dark Lord as allies the world is the limit."
Draco began to slowly open his eyes with a groan, Harry had stopped mid-sentence to look at the blond with shock. When it was clear the other was waking up, Harry’s face had lit up.
"I have Severus among my ranks, he is a great potions master, and he simply created a potion to return my looks to me." Voldemort as if it was the most obvious answer.
Now everyone was staring at the trio mouth agape, never had Tom and Draco been like this especially when it involved Harry, they were usually rather hostile when it came to Harry’s attention. What was weirder was that beside the giant blush creeping onto Harry’s cheeks, Harry had shown no reaction. Usually if either Tom or Draco had done something like this in front of the other Harry would scold them but for them both to do it and for Harry not to care was just creeping the others out.
She shook her head at him, her wild hair swishing side to side. “Don’t be so childish Harry."
Harry walked up and wiped some on her nose "It is now"
"You've been avoiding me Harry!"
Harry laughed Hermione joined in, Tom just smirked.
"As long as you're careful Harry." Hermione looked uncertain.
"Harry snuck down here last night because he was worried about Draco, I knew he would come back so I waited, he refused to leave his side so I compromised and made him sleep here, I didn't want to leave him so I stayed with him."
The others laughed and Tom returned the smile. “True but who says it should be done in public.”
"You’re lucky I'm not Hermione she would have slapped you for thinking that."
"Nothing" both Tom and Hermione said in harmony.
Voldemort turned to look at Severus "Do they always bicker like five year olds?"
Harry smiled at the memory he felt Draco stir as he lifted his head from Harry's lap he had sleep lines down his face. Harry laughed at Draco who tried to glare but failed. "Thanks harry I needed that"
Draco squeezed Harry before kissing the top of his head "There is just one small change"
Tom nodded. “I understand completely and I’m trying to keep my emotions in check, I’m just not that great with sharing.”
She gave him a warm smile. “Of course but is it really necessary to meet with that horrid woman?”
Draco sighed "You two must be rubbing off on me, forgive me my lord I'm just worried about Harry...I wasn't thinking clearly although I meant I will follow Harry."
Harry and Hermione thought it was hilarious. When the three weren't pulling pranks and having fun they were in the library studying and learning new things about anything and everything. However no matter how much they asked Harry would not tell them how he had been injured; even Tom could not get it out of them, who joined them for dinner each night.
Harry sighed and stood up, stretching out all the kinks from sitting for so long he began to make his way to the entrance to the common room, when Ron called out to him from across the room.
Harry flinched at the reminder of the Ministry, the flash of Sirius dissapearing behind the veil appeared in the forefront of his mind. He was not ready to explain the whole situation with his best friends so even though it made him feel guilty the next words that came out of his mouth was a lie.
"Oh shut up Ron, you’re the traitor, Harry always risked his life for you and your family and this is how you repay him!" Neville yelled.
Harry nodded “I’m lord Potter Black, I accepted the Potter one to adopt them and I signed the Black after Sirius, you know….." Harry gave Draco a sad look.
"Keep telling yourself that." Hermione laughed.
Hermione now had troubled look on her face, a battle was raging inside of her she was obviously scared of telling Harry." okay Harry promise not to lose your temper and that you will stay in bed" her eyes pleaded with Harry.
Harry was put off by the fact that Voldemort would offer his hand to shake to anyone but took it and gave it a quick shake before letting go.
Harry pretended to think about it. “I guess you could say it started from when my parents died and I was placed in the care of my muggle Aunt and Uncle, these people hated magic and anything and everything to do with magic, including me, which of course was going against my parents will.
Harry continued to glare "I hate you!"
He sat there reading for hours, he could see other blokes being uncomfortable but he had told Draco that he was gay weeks ago, when he told him he was scared he was going to lose his new friend but Draco had laughed and said he could tell because he was too. This had made Harry nervous was he really that obvious that he was gay. Tom and Draco had known come to think of it when he outed himself to Hermione she had said the same thing. He told Draco that he had told the dark lord he wasn't gay and Draco laughed “I bet he saw right through you".
Draco nodded "Oh I know that Harry believe me, I didn't mean it like that at all, but I'm not going down without a fight Harry...what a Malfoy wants a Malfoy gets"
Voldemort smirked at Harry "Do not insult my intelligence Harry, I know when people are checking me out, plus me and Hermione have been talking I know everything."
Harry took a deep breath as he took in the familiar seen, the smell of freshly cooked bacon hung in air, the clatter of mess in an organised manner. He stepped into the kitchen and the chatter instantly stopped. Ron looked like he wanted to blow something up, Mr and Mrs Weasley had a light of hope in their eyes which Harry couldn't wait to squish and Ginny looked as if she were the normal crazy obsessive teen she always had been. Mrs Weasley smiled up at Harry "Oh Harry dear it's great that you finally came home." Harry gesture for her to stop what she was doing as she had started to grab him in a hug. She looked startled but however she didn't show it for long. Harry was yet to say a word.
She moved Harry away and began examining Draco despite the blonde’s protests.
Draco nodded before wincing slightly before Harry could ask anything Draco raised his hand. “I’m fine it's the Dark Lord he is summoning me... It always burns when he does it so you can tell the difference."
Harry was falling for Draco and Tom and one thing was for sure.
Draco and Harry met for a messy kiss but it was a pleasant sensation as tongues met and teeth clashed. Tom’s hands began roaming Harry’s body, Harry moaned he wanted this, he
The two adults watched as the blonde was successfully calming his rival down, a few minutes passed when Harry's breathing returned to normal, he became conscious of the fact that his hand was still on Draco's chest, he pulled it away gently, his arm feeling to heavy to belong to his body.
Tom nodded his agreement squeezing Harry's hand, causing Harry to realise that he had never let go, there was a new addition, around his wrist was a silver charm bracelet. It had a total of four charms, one was a serpent with emerald eyes, another was a lion with ruby eyes, the third was a badger with amber eyes and last was an eagle with sapphire eyes. Harry looked at the bracelet with amazement, it represented all four houses. He looked up at Tom and smiled.
"Did you?" Hermione had an odd look on her face. “Hermione where are we?"
Harry looked down at the floor his face as red as a tomato. "They kissed me…"
"So you want me to obey your orders or you will kill me anyway?" Harry glared at Voldemort "As for locking me up you can forget it, I have had enough of that in my life."
“I know Harry… Tom told me.”
Harry pretended to think about it “Well..." Draco gave Harry a hopeful look and Harry chuckled "Maybe I could take a photo of it for you?"
Harry bit his lip actually considering the offer "Can I think about it and get back to you."
"Potions with Harry here." Draco reached over and ruffled Harry's hair "Be warned though, Harry sucks at potions."
"Don't worry the order weren't the ones to save you" Harry smiled and let out a breath he didn't know he had been holding.
Snape handed Harry the antidote, Voldemort looked displeased, whether it was because he had to take the potion or because he wanted to ask Harry more questions no one could tell. Harry watched as the man reluctantly took the potion, Harry smirked it had been his idea after all, he shouldn’t have suggested it if he was so against it.
Harry smirked "maybe I am or maybe he has just rubbed off on me, either way you say it like it’s a bad thing… being bad has its perks after all."
Harry got up and left a thoughtful Tom behind.
“It’s just a rumour, no one knows if it exists.” Blaise said to Theo
Harry blushed a deep red "I may have seen them in an uncomfortable position yesterday, and didn't feel like seeing that ever again... Hey Hermione maybe you can obliviate me, so I no longer have the picture in my head"
Voldemort hesitated before answering; it didn’t look like he was resisting merely thinking of what his answer was. "As long as you don’t put yourself in danger I can’t see why you can’t live your life, although locking you in a tower does seem like it would have its perks." He gave Harry a smirk. "It would be also best if you either joined me or removed yourself from the fray altogether, I would rather not have to destroy you because you were working to destroy me, I do have other horcruxes to fall back on if you leave me no other choice."
Draco grabbed Harry's hand as they walked. "It's not, not yet anyway... I promise to let you know if it becomes too much."
They were too busy laughing and talking when they made their way through the common room to their rooms that they didn't notice the person watching by the fire.
"It’s not like I’m asking much, just don’t fight against me, I don’t expect you to be a death eater or anything I won’t be giving you missions or the like."
Harry was laughing hysterically, everyone had come down to breakfast screaming and some even came half dressed, they covered their ears. The professors had no idea what to do. Harry had purposely came down looking like he came down in a rush just so he didn't look like the odd one out. He saw Ron run past screaming something about his underwear turning into spiders. Harry was still laughing until he was met by an angry group of Slytherin's and one Gryffindor.
"Hey if Remus apparated us wouldn't that blow his cover?"
"You'll find out in good time.”
Harry smiled "It's my goal to put everyone through the hell I went through, except the people that stood by me of course."
Harry pointed in the direction he wished to go. "Already seen one of them, Sirius has a one as a pet, why waste time there?"
Voldemort scowled “I should have you killed for the way you speak of me however that would waste my efforts of saving you.” The older man was silent for a moment before he smirked as he noticed Harry staring. “Like what you see Harry?”
Making his way down to the great hall, he couldn't help but think how different this year was going to be, he would be hanging out with Draco and not Ron, he would be attending school with his parents murderer and not be bothered. His parents best friends, the closest thing had to family besides Hermione and the twins would be secretly hidden in the castle helping him cause trouble and having fun. It was going to be one hell of a year that was for sure... Harry potter was going to take Hogwarts School of witchcraft and wizardry by storm
Tom’s forehead now rested on Harry’s. “While Draco and I were talking, we both agreed that you should allowed to be selfish after everything that has happened to you.”
Harry grabbed a strawberry and dipped it in the chocolate "Fine but I get to feed you"
Soon they had found a rhythm; Draco pushing himself on Harry’s cock as Tom pushed forward, filling Harry. Harry could barley breath and his vision was hazy, his whole body felt like it was one fire. It was like nothing Harry had ever felt before. He closed his eyes as he was pleasure by these two men. He knew he wasn’t going to last much longer. “I’m gonna-!” He gasped as he came inside Draco who moaned at the feeling. Draco’s hand was fiercely fisting his own cock before crying out as well as he came all over himself. Tom continued to rock against Harry until he reached his own completion not much after the other two.
Pansy hugged Hermione, "Is our little Harrykins ready for his date with big bad dark lord."
Draco turned back to Harry “Who said you could call me that huh?"
He ran a hand through Draco's hair absentmindedly. His hair was soft as silk and ran through his fingers like water. He smiled as Draco smiled in his sleep; it was like his small gesture of comfort drifted into his friends sleep.
Harry raised his hands in defense. "It was a joke jeez, I didn’t think you would actually come onto me, besides even if you did that would be super gross me having a part of your soul and all."
Hermione nodded "Oh I'm in, see you later Harry, I have to pay our old friend a visit and finish a report"
Neville smirked "So you and Draco huh?"
Harry had excused himself to go to bed when Tom and Draco hadn’t returned. Harry was falling asleep when he felt the bed shift as someone lay next to him. His senses told him it was Draco, he curled into Draco as the other as the other teen had placed a kiss to the top of his head. What he wasn’t expecting was for someone to curl up on the other side of his. Sandwiching him in the middle of them both but he soon recognised the other person to be Tom. Harry made a confused sound as the two cuddled him from both sides. Tom placed a kiss to the back of his head, Harry turned around to face him. His confusion clear on his face.
Soon the Medi Witch came rushing in and shouted with glee when she saw Draco was clearly awake.
Tom nodded "I'll consider it."
He thought of a million things he could say to Dumbedore to justify the things going on with the Slytherins, he cursed that they hadnt been more descreet but with the soze of the groups coming to meet him at the lake that idea had gone out the window in the first week.
Harry snorted "You just don't want to admit my seeker skills are superior to yours."
Voldemort was sitting in Snape’s chair, while the Professor was nowhere to be seen, it was so much different than the last time he had entered this room with Voldemort presence. “You know this could have gone bad if it hadn’t been me knocking?”
Harry promised to visit the two soon and went off to Defense with Tom while Draco went back to the common room to study on his own. The blonde had tried to convince the other two to have the day off with him but Tom wouldn’t let Harry. Claiming that Harry needed to learn something this week considering he had been on auto pilot since Draco had been in the hospital.
Harry nodded that he understood.
"I was doing my potions work and Tom was helping me with the last question."
Harry rolled his eyes "I passed of course not quite an Outstanding but I'm getting there."
Draco nodded "As you know we are second cousins, there are photos of us together when I was little but that was before Azkaban, mums told be story's about when they were kids apart from that I don't know much."
Harry hesitated for a spit second before entering the headmasters office, Dumbeldore and his twinkling eyes sat as his desk, looking at Harry knowingly as if he had seen Harrys hesitation before opening the door, Harry wouldnt have even put it past him if he did.
Harry had the perfect plan in place, he had contacted Lucius and had formed a plan to get the two Weasley’s a one way ticket to Azkaban by the end of the of the month, this would only hurt Dumbledore later when he stood up for them when he finds out about the trial.
Voldemort didn't speak but simply turned away, dismissing Harry. Harry left the room without saying anything more, he made his way back to his dorm slowly. Thoughts swam through his brain. How was he going to train a group of Slytherins, ones that hated him for years, but hey if he can survive a basilisk, he can teach a bunch of his peers, even ones that hate him... right?
“Jeez Hermione, the man has only been a wake for a few hours don’t bore him back to sleep.” Pansy complained.
Harry looked at his watch, deciding that it was late enough he headed down to the hospital wing, where he could be there when Draco woke up.
Harry was dreading tonight; it would be his first meeting as death eater.
Pansy looked from Harry to Hermione "Is she really always this bossy?"
Harry laughed “I did, since we are friends now" Draco looked shocked at first then smiled.
Draco scoffed "why because I'm not Harry and you’re not trying to get into my pants? well guess what I'm loyal to Harry and Harry alone." Draco looked shocked at himself as he said the last past as if only just realising that it was true.
