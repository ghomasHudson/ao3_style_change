“You’re getting much better with your mouth, you know,” Draco noted, with no small amount of cheekiness as they made their way out of the tent, and then out of the library.
Unfortunately, just as before, the extensive queue had drawn Dementors—six at least, floating ominous along the edges of a snaking line of people, sampling the misery on offer. The sight of them alone stopped Harry in his tracks, but it only took one wraith to sense their presence for all six to turn in their direction, bearing a biting edge of iciness as they approached.
Harry had been meaning to owl Hermione anyway regarding his plans, as much as he could put into writing without incriminating himself. At the end of his summary, he worked in a request for all of the information she could give him on how she had used the Protean Charm, and anything else she could tell him about it.
If Draco was right about how much work was left—and if Harry wasn’t so completely dead-on-his-feet tired that he could find the coordination to cast the required spells—then they were very close
“You’re really into silk, aren’t you?” Harry teased quietly, clumsy fingers pushing at the hem of them, rolling them down Draco’s hips.
But Draco wouldn’t want to hear any of that, and Harry at least knew when to bite his tongue this time.
“Right, no. Not the naughtiness in school bit. I meant, does he expect you to do the same? Get married and…carry on the family name, or whatever.”
He’d taken to stashing Malfoy’s letters in the attic, locked securely in the hidden pocket of his old school trunk, and for now it was where he kept the key as well.
But when Harry closed his eyes in his tensest moments, what came to him was not red hair and soft freckled skin but blond and hard and breathlessly moaning Harry’s name. He thought Ginny undeniably beautiful too, he had for years, and she only grew more so every year that moved them further away from the darkest moments of their lives.
“Maybe not,” Harry acknowledged with a small smirk. They were sharing the umbrella, so they were rather close, and he blamed that too for his distraction.
With a lower cry, Harry pushed into each tightening convulsion inside him and Draco rode him relentlessly, soft hands sliding splayed over his chest in appreciative strokes, spreading the mess he’d made, until Harry jolted beneath him, hotly slicking him inside.
Harry chewed his lip a moment, as Draco went on unbothered, and preoccupied considering the length of his arm.
“Tomorrow morning I’ll start with the window illusions first thing, then we’ll do the curtains together. I doubt we’ll get them all done before we’re meant to be meeting with Cassie, but then we
After sorting his most pressing concerns, Harry summoned some slightly wrinkled pyjama bottoms from the large pile of clean laundry that always accumulated in front of his wardrobe.
He inhaled unsteadily when Draco whispered a spell to fully unfasten his trousers, allowing long fingers in past his pants to tug out his prick, right there in the alley.
Eventually he healed his lips, and had to do his cock too, but then he was eager to go all over again. He’d offered to heal Draco’s arse, even just a little, but Draco waved him off once more.
It was a several minute walk to the kitchen, and they bantered the rest of the way, but when they arrived Draco charmed together some tea and a proper lunch for them. He insisted they eat quickly again, but Harry would’ve done anyway, having worked up quite an appetite that morning.
A week later, Harry finally owled him, though he maintained to himself it was solely to address the next phases of the project.
He wasn’t sure how he would explain to Ginny where he had been if she’d woken up while he was gone, but probably, going home smelling of Draco and come wasn’t the best idea—so he accepted the offer.
Before he got around to fucking him, Harry dragged him firmly over his lap. Draco’s cock prodded stiffly into his thigh, twitching enticingly when Harry forcefully smacked his arse.
The way Draco kissed him then was the softest Harry thought they ever had. There was one, two, and a third, each leaving behind their own explosive sort of promise—before their lips finally parted for their tongues to roll together, hot and wet and pliant. Harry felt a little dizzy.
Following him through into the ballroom, Harry laughed darkly, echoing a bit off the mirror-ceiling. “Sounds dangerous.”
“I can’t go anywhere until you move off,” Harry pointed out a touch smugly. “Should we try one of yours tonight?”
Harry dropped a quiet laugh, biting indulgently at one hard peak before he went on following the trail of honey wherever it led. It
Harry didn’t need to be told twice. Rising up to kiss Draco insatiably, he worked himself between pale thighs as Draco arched for him, helping Harry to inch his cock inside.
When they eventually managed to stop kissing, Harry slouched back in his chair as Draco shifted down to kneel between his legs, and slowly trace his lips along Harry’s cock through his jeans. He moaned softly every now and then, his fingers aching to brush through Draco’s hair, but he was resisting the temptation.
“We’ll also need your discretion regarding everything we’re about to tell you. Part of our strategy will involve using magic to help, and it’s a delicate process,” Draco added.
Obviously, things would never be the same for George after losing Fred, but in the time since Harry had seen the joke shop, and Ron, pull him from a very real darkness.
“Essentially,” Draco drawled wryly. “If we manage to finish them before midnight, I might even crack open the good firewhisky.”
One thing Harry had to make time for was stopping by to see Cassie, checking if she had come up with any suggestions for locations—and she had a few. She’d lined out a small area on a paper map for him, small pushpins stuck into the places they might consider.
Malfoy gestured to the empty end of the chaise he lounged upon, pulling his legs up just enough to clear a small space, though even through the dim light Harry could see him scowling.
Harry’s glare was half-hearted at best. He did his utmost to tamp down any embarrassment and instead took a proper drink.
Despite the grim turn of his thoughts, Harry had to admit the overall ambiance did come off a great deal more cheerful this year.
Harry was a touch unsteady on his feet, and he was still taking most of Draco’s weight, but when Draco tipped his head back Harry nipped his way into kissing Draco’s soft and still-moaning lips as he pulled out.
“We need to be sure we’re both proficient at setting the outer enchantments—protective, illusions, the Taboo, all of it. In case anything goes wrong on either end there needs to be more than one person who knows how to do this.”
Harry shrugged, not terribly fussed about the day’s schedule when the option of fucking was on the table.
According to Malfoy, their tryst under the potion was meant to be a one-time exception. Yet Harry thought the rather visceral image of Draco with his arse up moaning for Harry to fuck him harder could potentially make it tricky to continue on working together as normal.
Perching on the very edge of a low table at the room’s centre, there was no hesitation in the way Harry pulled him back against his chest.
“Don’t mention it, Potter. I’ve had the time to spare,” he cut him off abruptly, sounding a bit bristled before immediately changing the subject. “What’ve you brought to practice on?”
An idea was tumbling about somewhere inside his barely-sober brain that Harry was trying to catch hold of, something of his dreams, just out of reach. He wouldn’t manage to catch it that night but it would come in time, and with it bring a sea of change crashing right to Harry’s doorstep.
. Harry had the time to wonder how he was expected to go about this before Draco lifted his hips and wordlessly guided his hand down between them, finally pressing far smoother lips more firmly to the well-bitten swell of Harry’s.
He was saved from thinking of something more stimulating to say when someone walked up to speak with Lawrence. Harry had wished him congratulations again, before making his way out of the drinks area.
It was a bit of a shock. Harry had forgotten all about his dreams, but at the mention some of it filtered back in bits and pieces. Had Malfoy been there in the dream? Or was his mind confusing now with what had happened inside his head?
It occurred to him he ought to brush his teeth then, and he took off up the stairs to the bathroom as Draco’s careful scrawl went on beneath his first message.
“I wasn’t asking you to come,” Harry pointed out frankly. “I’m not trying to make this any harder on myself than necessary.”
They each attempted the spell a few more times. Harry tried expanding the shoebox even more than Malfoy already had, and succeeded, though he also significantly bowed the outside of the box. Momentarily it looked like it might burst as well, but at least it hadn’t got quite as large as the tent. He cancelled his own charm on the tent and let Malfoy have a go—who managed to expand it to the size of a large room, but not quite to the size of a proper house big enough to live in. They’d cancelled it again, and on Harry’s next try he managed to expand it to about the size of a large circus tent.
On the day he was meant to meet Malfoy, as the hour approached Harry fought off a nervous anticipation and did his best to keep his focus on the notes he had been taking on the casting of Extension Charms. In the last minutes he gathered up the few objects he intended to take and prepared himself for the inevitable pull behind his navel—bringing with it a familiar discomfort, always taking him back to the end horror of his last Triwizard task.
He waved for Savage when a dark hulk drifted out from a nearby alley—followed shortly by another, and another after. They both slipped their wands from their pockets as they crept nearer, as quietly as they could—unfortunately, the small crowd of wraiths all seemed to sense their presence the moment they got within range.
Draco’s cock had crossed Harry’s mind and his dreams, a few times. On length alone it was nearly impossible for Harry not to consider the thought of it being somewhere other than his mouth. It seemed almost a waste otherwise.
Ginny appeared momentarily at a loss for words, but he braced himself for whatever question he could see brewing behind her eyes.
Malfoy held the concoction up to the floating lights suspended above them before taking a sip himself.
He watched Malfoy’s eyes fall closed, and the clear focus it took for him to continue taking him in smoothly. Almost too smoothly. Experimentally, he tugged firmly at his hair, and the resulting glare was worth throwing him off enough to feel an edge of teeth against over-sensitised skin, and now Harry was proper moaning too.
They practised spells in the library for nearly three hours, and without all that distracting tension humming between them, Harry found it a lot easier to retain the elaborate wand patterns he would need to learn for their spells to work. It was still very hard, and Harry huffed crossly more than once when he fucked it up—but when he did get it right, it was also incredibly satisfying.
Draco was quiet a few moments, staring out across the bedroom. Harry assumed he was thinking over what all they would need to do to prepare. When he finally broke his silence that wasn’t what he was thinking at all.
He went to bed very early that night, he was so worn out—and for the first several hours he had a nice dreamless sleep—but the nightmares hit rather hard later in the evening.
As always, work also included a lot of paperwork and reports, and his training classes and theory studies were ever-ongoing. It was quite a lot to juggle.
Draco rolled over to face the other side of the bed. “Go to sleep, Potter. It’s late, and tomorrow will be very long.”
“Erm, right. Good. That’s—thanks.” Harry took a drink, wincing around the pleasantly distracting burn that followed. “Good to know.”
“I had thought maybe if you’ve got some space in your desk… I was hoping to test it in one of the drawers, then when I wrote anything I could turn the light on.”
Malfoy took out his wand then, casting a privacy ward around the clearing. Likely a good idea—as Harry couldn’t think of a single person he would have wanted finding him tripping on potions with Draco Malfoy at such a somber event.
Inevitably after the prolonged emission of magic, as soon as he lowered his wand, he wavered backward unsteadily.
Darkened grey eyes darted imperceptibly at him, and Harry heard quite clearly the nervous shift in Malfoy’s breathing.
He pushed the stack of books at Harry, as if bequeathing ownership of the problem to him again—but Harry hadn’t missed the number of times Malfoy just said ‘we’ like this was a project he intended on seeing through.
They went over again some of what they had covered in their last meeting, and Draco caught him up on what might be relevant in the books he had already leant him.
That woke him up somewhat. He had, in fact, left the house at almost one in the morning, while Ginny slept upstairs, having no idea he’d even left.
At a minimum of four lamps per tent it was a lot of Transfigurations, but as with the curtains they got into a pretty good rhythm and made fast work of them.
They got so distracted kissing once or twice, they forgot to move their hips entirely, but eventually the pressure of pleasure and tension was too much to take, and he found himself thrusting up steadily harder.
Harry had no real hope of swallowing it all, not with Draco’s shaft still shuddering in his throat, but he gave it his best effort.
His curiosity piqued, Harry had a small taste himself before rendering any sort of judgement. Initially it burned like any other firewhisky tended to, but undeniably it went down far smoother. There was a rich depth to its flavour, a complexity which played intriguing on his tastebuds.
Having recently resigned himself to the reality that he actually quite liked when Draco was being an arsehole sometimes, Harry couldn’t fully hide his smile as he rushed to catch up. Although he missed his trainers again, doing his best not to fall flat on his face trying to run through the rain in smart shoes.
He wanted to drive Draco closer to the edge with him, but as they were Harry couldn’t get a good angle on the needy cock rubbing against his stomach.
Harry fucked him into the mattress chasing his own. The bed shook precariously under them and Draco whimpered, the still-rosy cheeks of his arse taking the brunt of the impact as he pushed up into the deep unrelenting force of Harry’s cock. With a few final rolling thrusts, Harry was groaning and spilling inside under a haze of intense bliss.
“Or is it me you love getting fucked by Draco, and my—exquisite—cock?” He punctuated his last two words with pointedly hard, pressing thrusts into the sweetest of Draco’s spots.
Draco stared at him obstinately for a long moment, but Harry won their staring contest and he sighed in surrender, slowly inclining against Harry’s side. His head found Harry’s shoulder and his eyes fell closed. Harry’s cheek settled atop his head.
He groaned tightly, pushing his lips into Draco’s even harder, and trying to shut out the betrayal of his thoughts.
Ginny was leaving the next day—the start of a four-week stretch of pre-season training with the Harpies.
“I never hated you, I didn’t trust you. You were an annoying hateful little twat, and you didn’t make it easy to—”
Harry was only trying to be encouraging. Unfortunately, something about his optimism seemed to set Malfoy off.
For a time their full concentration was invested in the casting of the Extension Charms, and all their many amendments. At nearly a half-hour per tent to start with, it would likely take them the better part of two days to get through them all—unless their casting time improved significantly in the interim. Needless to say, they didn’t have much time for teasing, or even talking.
Moaning and dazed, Draco panted into Harry’s neck as they both descended from pleasurable heights—but he did not give Harry or himself very long to recover.
“You don’t want another cuddle?” Harry pestered. Given how emphatically Draco had rejected the idea yesterday, he couldn’t really help poking fun.
“I’m engaged, and I can’t stop cheating. When I do feel guilty it’s not enough to stop. I don’t know what’s wrong with me.”
He groaned a warning, which only caused Draco’s cock to twitch harder into his next thrust. Harry had to grip at rather forceful hips to get him to ease off, just a for a second—then he willingly forced him just as deep, moaning.
He got a rather unimpressed look for cheek. “Yes, that. Go and shower, I’ll need time to dress you as well.”
They needed to be up very early, yet there was little urgency in the roll of Draco’s hips nor the exploring strokes and lingering touch of Harry’s roaming hands.
“Not sure I’d be very good at designing cards.” Harry was trying to make a joke, but it clearly did not translate.
Sitting on either end of the settee Draco had been napping on earlier, Harry yawned, and Draco mirrored him only seconds later, and glared immediately afterward, as if it were all Harry’s fault—because it was.
“Things were a bit shit for a while—sorry—there were all sorts of arbitrary restrictions on who we could help and how. The government here in London, central and local, have thrown a lot of money at attempted solutions. They’ve only recently started replacing some of the more harmful policies from the eighties, and we’ve only just begun to create a social services network equipped to help people out of the desperate situations they’re in.”
“If you tell absolutely anyone about the cuddling there will be very severe consequences,” Draco murmured without bothering to open his eyes.
If Malfoy was trying to reassure him that this wasn’t a terrible mistake, he was doing a dreadful job of it. It was also possible Harry was sobering up a bit, so close to the scene of what he still considered one of the worst decisions he had ever made.
Draco finally pressed down to kiss him, hard and very slowly—swiftly fanning the flames of tension between them. The wet humid sound of it, the hot press of Draco’s tongue and the taste of him was irresistible—and they both drew it out, unable to fight the draw of lips and dance of tongues—
“I could always be fashionably late,” Draco suggested hoarsely, long fingers threading through Harry’s hair and holding his mouth exactly where it was on his throat. “
Expelling Harry’s name among a sea of curses, Draco broke off groaning as Harry pushed his cock over the swell of his pleasure centre, thrusting a smoothly continuous pressure.
As he entered through the iron arch he heard the rattle of a doorknob, Draco’s bedroom door opened, and he glanced up to the landing, obviously expecting to see Draco emerge. He was instead stunned to see none other than Blaise Zabini, in a bath towel, shouting across to the open door of Draco’s potions lab on the other side.
“This top middle bit here, it’s too long.” Draco made the adjustment with a flick of his wand tip. “There.”
It was all too much, was the problem. It was hard for him to see the whole occasion as anything other than a painful revisiting of his least favorite nightmares, and Harry felt a prevailing desire to be anywhere else.
Draco quirked an expectant eyebrow. “Alright, Potter. Lesson one, don’t slouch. Take your elbow off the table and sit up straight.”
“Sure, probably. But it’s not up to us to meddle in these sorts of Muggle affairs. We’ve got our job, and they’ve got theirs; right?”
“I won’t make you wear a tie, but I’ll have to insist on trousers, also a proper shirt and a belt at the very least—you can borrow mine. Oh, and obviously you won’t be wearing your filthy trainers.”
Draco had left him perched on the arch of a spindle-backed chair in the tent’s kitchen, and he hopped about, hooting brightly as Harry approached to get on with unfastening the letter.
“Consider what you might like someone to do to you… only watch your teeth. Not everyone likes quite so much as you.”
“—but you’ve pressing matters elsewhere,” Malfoy finished for him, seemingly more resigned than disappointed.
Probably he ought to have objected further, but he couldn’t bring himself to—not as Draco slowly surrounded him in searingly sinful slickness, suckling hot on his cock and rubbing at the swell of his bollocks still trapped in his pants.
Knowing he would always be an easy handful of Floo powder away, Harry wasn’t sure if he had the fortitude to stop—but he knew he would need to find it if he wanted to keep his life with Ginny from burning to the ground. He would have to go back to normal, as if none of it had ever happened.
He whispered prep spells, doing his best to untangle their lower halves from come-sticky sheets so that Draco might spread his legs enough he could get his cock up between them. When the angle wasn’t right, Harry huffed his frustration and rolled them over, getting his knees under him to pull Draco’s hips up, close enough to push the tip of his prick past the slicked-tight circle he wanted into so badly.
She could also be seen on a number of occasions laughing in entertained exasperation as Harry went off for another round of drinks.
people first, and that should matter—” She flushed. “Oh, sorry—this job is just very important to me, I do go on. And actually, I’ve got to speak to someone just now—if you don’t mind waiting here…”
“Hello? Sorry to interrupt—I was told out front that you might be able to help me with some information.” He poked his head through the crack in the door a bit awkwardly. “I’m Harry, by the way.”
They could’ve each stayed in their own if they’d wanted, but Draco hadn’t suggested splitting up, so he didn’t either. As this one was Harry’s creation, there were a lot more warm colours to it—browns, reds and ambers—than Draco’s, which were usually shades of grey, black and white, with only the occasional pops of bright colour.
“You’re still hard,” Harry gasped, pressing his hips up to meet with as much force as he could when Malfoy had him pinned as he did.
“You’ll see when we get there, ‘bit of a mess if you ask me, Potter; but I hear you’ve got a wicked Patronus in your arsenal. ‘Ought to prepare your happy thoughts now, you’ll be needing them today.”
Some part of him, he knew, was looking for any way to avoid thinking about all of the people and all of the pain he had left behind him.
Harry had encountered a fair deal of depravity in his life, yet the thought of Dementors ‘tasting’ anything gave him the creeps.
Really, the last thing he wanted to talk to her about was Draco, who was at the heart of all Harry’s worst secrets from her. Knowing he needed to have the conversation didn’t make him any more inclined to start it.
When he did eventually look up Malfoy was long gone. He took a while longer finishing his own drink, but eventually he shrunk the books down to fit into his pockets and gathered their glasses up from the table.
He bobbed for a bit, which took more coordination than Harry was expecting, and then got himself distracted teasing his tongue down the underside. He tried not to be overly nervous when he discovered Draco was watching him, his eyes a darkened grey with arousal.
When he arrived in the Manor’s library, the room was all dark save for the low glow of the fire, and Harry had to light his wand to find the door.
“Sorry for your luck mate, but I wouldn’t volunteer to work with a toff like Malfoy if you paid me a whole dragon’s hoard of galleons for it,” Ron dismissed. “How’re things at the Ministry then?”
On the other hand, Harry reasoned, after everything he had ever been through—perhaps it couldn’t hurt to give himself what he actually wanted while he had the chance. No one suspected a thing, and why would they? Draco was pretty meticulously discreet about all of it. So long as no one knew, what could it hurt to indulge a little longer?
“Yeah, until you get caught out alone in London with a death cloud of Dementors after you,” Harry pointed out. “I mean, maybe I could—”
Harry spent his Monday at the Ministry as he always did, catching up on his paperwork, but as usual he was finding it difficult to keep his mind on the task. It kept wandering off, replaying conversations and moments he didn’t want to remember.
But then again Harry had also been there with him that night in the tower, when Draco couldn’t do what they were asking of him, even when it meant defying, as Draco had put it, one of the most powerful wizards in living memory. Even when it meant disobeying his own family.
Naked together in the library again, Draco caught Harry by the shoulders and pushed him down to his knees.
His cock throbbed in Harry’s grip, shooting several slow splashes up his own front, and Draco choked off a cry when Harry’s thrusts sped up, drawing out a maddening high of ecstasy—until Harry finally joined him, tensing as he painted Draco inside with a few more hot spurts of come.
“No, we’re not. Showers first. Separately. I’ll be using the one next-door, there’s far less chance of any distractions that way.”
Not an easy task, when Draco was a bit taller than him, not to mention his mouth was teasing at Harry’s ear all the way. He nearly dropped him halfway up. A Feather-Light Charm might’ve helped, but the weight of him rubbing against Harry's cock was purely sinful, and Draco was doing it on purpose.
Harry was watching him now—and once he’d started, he couldn’t seem to stop. He watched the way Malfoy’s robes slid off sharp shoulders, watched him charming them to hang neatly from a low branch, and watched him sink down to stretch out languidly on the grass at their feet.
But then Ginny Disapparated to Holyhead, and Harry stood in his sitting room a while longer, alone with too many of his thoughts and worries once again.
“From the stars?” Harry slurred a bit, and when he tried to tip back to look, the world went slightly sideways, and only the very real danger of falling into Malfoy’s lap kept him upright.
He wanted Draco, but he shouldn’t want Draco. He wanted to kiss Draco, but he shouldn’t want to kiss him. He wanted to fuck Draco until dawn, and he shouldn’t’ve wanted that either.
Harry plopped down, but rather than read the cover, he looked up at Draco with questioning green eyes.  “Any thoughts on Cassie?”
“Sorry, yeah.” Shrugging easily, Harry didn’t press at the obvious sore spot he’d just accidentally hit. If Ron wanted to talk about it, he surely would—at the moment it seemed he wanted to fly off his frustration.
They were hardly the most comfortable clothes he’d ever worn, but they certainly fit well, and inarguably they looked good.
As a throng of wedding guests milled about in their gowns and dress robes, droning with the sound of so many quiet conversations happening at once, a quartet of stringed instruments tucked into the far corner of the room bowed themselves. Wandering closer, Harry thought it was a clever bit of magic, but the sleepy melodies the spells produced were doing naught to liven the mood of the room. He watched them play for a while, until a crowd of people began to gather and whisper not too far away. Harry was certain he’d heard his own name, and decided it was time to move on.
“Harry! Sorry mate, people’ve been asking me that since we got here. She’s back at the flat—and well into a stack of books nearly hitting the rafters last I checked.” Ron shook his head hopelessly.
Harry watched his every movement, listening to every word. Not for the reasons he might normally, but knowing he would need to replicate them as closely as possible when he tried the spell for himself.
He moaned low around Draco’s cock, and Draco moaned back, more distraughtly. Harry only noticed then that he was still gently working his vibrating wand, as Draco’s spent cock twitched overwhelmed on Harry’s tongue.
Malfoy didn't seem in any real hurry to pull his arm away, despite watching the path of Harry’s fingers quite closely.
Harry snickered and sucked a little harder at his tip, and Draco actually whined—but then Harry finally let up, sitting back on his knees to arch a faintly hopeful eyebrow at the former Slytherin.
However, as they passed through the shelter’s main doors, its front room remained humming with activity, packed full with tables of people all eating and chatting over the continuous clink of silverware and the squawk of metal chair legs on a hard parquet floor. Though far from it, nevertheless Harry was immediately reminded of the Great Hall—which was all well and good, until he shortly thereafter started recalling what many hells had transpired under its vaulted ceiling in the end.
When he rolled his hips, shifting the impact of his cock a bit, Draco let out something like a sob of pleasure and Harry only fucked him harder, and more relentlessly.
Malfoy’s second attempt went much better. The shoebox dropped down several meters by the looks of it—or at least, from the right angle. With the top on it looked perfectly normal, which was the desired effect.
Draco began at the center of the spiral and Harry went out to the edge and they worked their way through them all, unshrinking then charming each to erect itself.
Harry had walked right into that trap, and completely unwilling to make that argument, he muttered a quiet ‘arsehole’ and shuffled off to the bathroom, Draco’s self-satisfied laugh following him down the tiny corridor.
He caught a betraying snicker from the man beneath him and Harry smirked tiredly, his cheek squashed into the sweat-damp fabric of Draco’s shirt where it rode up on his back.
It came to him in a flash of inspiration, reading through one of the books Draco had left him on passive magic. He’d come across a few sections regarding the Protean Charm—what Hermione had used on the D.A.’s coins—and it occurred to him then that something similar would work perfectly as a way to keep in touch with her magically, without her needing to be able to use the magic herself.
Malfoy’s forearm may have once carried the mark of Voldemort, but Harry did not believe it was ever really what he wanted, if his testimony was to be believed.
, it is highly advanced potions craft,” he equivocated. “Furthermore, I resent the implication my home is unclean."
A stately eagle owl woke Harry one Saturday morning in mid-January with a series of abruptly loud pecks to his bedroom window.
They made it once to dinner at the same time, and Harry and Ginny had sat with them at the end of the table, but there were so many conversations happening at once, they’d barely spoken to each other at all.
Harry shifted even closer, for leverage, and was surprised when Malfoy arched back against his chest, writhing a little impatiently as Harry pulled him fully free from his pants, and properly sped his stroking. He squeezed like he was pumping himself, and felt his own cock give a sympathy twitch in his trousers.
After several weeks uninterrupted, it was easy to forget how precarious everything they were doing truly was—but then, Harry’s short time with Ron the day before brought a rather more painful clarity to the reality of it all.
Draco caught hold of his forearm to tug him a little closer, and Harry didn’t think, he just kissed him, quick and slightly urgent. Taunting lips quirked faint amusement at him, and he was fighting off the draw to do it again when, jarring as it ever was, he popped out of being under the push of Draco’s magic.
“You’re fucking incredible at kissing. I’ve hardly slept this week,” Harry admitted. “I’m barely conscious, honestly.”
Through somewhat fuzzy vision, Harry looked across the bedroom to a wooden-framed window, through which he could see the back end of a neighbouring tent and, more fuzzily, a bit of the ballroom’s mirrored wall reflecting the entire spiral.
Taken aback at the seriousness of the question, Harry hesitated. “I don’t…er, I think so? Don’t you think I should?”
It was the smell of chocolate and cinnamon that woke Harry about twenty minutes later, and Draco had been kind enough to make two this time. A mug was sitting on the bedside table beside his glasses and his wand when he pushed himself up to sitting.
When Draco freed his wrists, he went right back to exploring with touch, something claiming in the trace of his hands down the path of Draco’s spine, straight to his arse, which he proceeded to smack quite hard.
With his glasses on, Harry could see most of the light in the room was coming from the wall facing the atrium, which was not solid as the others were, but inset with varying-sized circles of opaque glass—red, blue and green. It cast an unusual plethora of colours over the bed and the walls and the floors, it was quite beautiful, and only drove home the fact he hadn’t ever been in there in the proper light of day before.
“Hermione was always better at the Undetectables but I could give it a shot,” he considered. “Unless you think you—”
He missed his friends—though he couldn’t help being a bit nervous about what cryptic thing they needed to speak with him about. He'd tried pressing Ginny for details before she left, but she’d pretended not to know what he was talking about—even if he remembered the fact Hermione had clearly said it had something to with something Ginny had told them.
They met in the middle as everything set up all around them, a flurry of clinking and clicking and rustling fabric.
“Harry? Please wake up, I’ve been looking for you everywhere! It’s so late, I’ve got a match tomorrow afternoon; we should really Floo home.”
Harry let Draco enchant the sheets to change themselves, and only stopped kissing him when all was fitted crisply into place and the bed was fresh and clean for them. His lips throbbed exquisitely in the aftermath, yet contrarily they missed the hard press of Draco’s.
At half-past midnight, Draco was rechecking the kitchen sink in their final extension of the evening.
Harry was about to set off up the hill when something glinted bright and blond under the sun across the narrow end of the lake, catching his eye.
And he wasn’t exactly afraid; the thought of what Draco might feel like inside of him turned Harry on a rather ridiculous amount—but he wasn’t yet certain about it either, and it felt like something he really
It helped that some of the Field Training Harry was allowed to participate in was growing more complex—and riskier.
Ginny sounded a touch tipsy. She got babbly when she’d been drinking, and Harry found it very endearing. Only at the moment he couldn’t silence the alarm bells ringing angrily in head long enough to appreciate it.
A replying tight cry from Draco was all the warning either of them had before he was shooting wickedly hot jets over Harry’s arse, nudging his spilling tip ever so gently harder to the tight twist, lost in a pleasure haze.
A few of the portraits did try to chat him up, one of them was even quite flirty. There were also a fair number of scandalised looks as Harry passed through the corridor—but he supposed that might have something to do with his fashion choices.
“It’s been splendid chatting and all, but we’ve quite a lot of work left to do. I’m sure you understand.”
There were all sorts of things about Malfoy that Aberforth might’ve been referring to, given how rumours tended to spread in such a small community—and also how much time Aberforth had spent talking to Dobby—but he felt a bit flustered at the warning anyway.
Then Draco would pull up until Harry very nearly slipped out of him, gasping as Harry squirmed beneath him.
Here's the next bit! Later than I'd like, but it took some additional refining. As always, thanks so much for reading and all your awesome feedback! It's been really lovely.
to help, I won’t turn you down.” Harry eyed Draco suspiciously for a long moment before he could not help but ask— “What’s in it for you?”
With an abrupt snap up, Harry drove his cock in hard, and well-aimed. Draco cried out, loud, and forgot all about being a snarky prick.
Harry thrust in hard, put his weight into it, and Draco pressed back, forcing his arse flush to Harry’s hips, rocking on his cock as they both held firm, until Draco whined a beautifully broken sound—and Harry did it all over again, drawing out to fuck back in.
Draco punctuated his question with a taunting writhe of hips and then he was pressing Harry’s cock into his prostate again with his own tight groan.
It was not doing him any favours that so many small moments of his erstwhile evening with Malfoy would return to him, at the most inconvenient times, bringing with them a plethora of shame and unquestionably—desire. Harry tried his best to ignore that last bit, with varying degrees of success. If he threw himself into his other endeavours, he could mostly manage to shut it all out, for a time.
He decided he needed a drink, something to supplement the pain potion, and also perhaps bolster some of his confidence, but he barely managed to (very gently) sit and order before Hermione was dragging him away again.
Harry wasn’t sure he believed Malfoy, but found he was instinctively swaying a bit in his direction anyway. That seemed dangerous.
Harry’d meant it just to tease him more—only now that he’d said it aloud, it was kind of a compelling idea.
Harry was more the jump around and spin type, than the careful steps required for parlour music of the sort they were being treated to, and he usually preferred there be no audience of strangers to watch him when he inevitably mucked it up.
He wanted to throttle him for his attitude, but ultimately Malfoy’s point had sticking power. Helping Muggles with magical solutions would generate an enormous amount of red-tape and headaches for him at best, at worst he could wind up jobless, or even arrested himself.
In heels, Ginny nearly had to lean down a bit to press a short kiss to Harry’s cheek, shooting one last look of confusion in Malfoy’s direction.
“Er. Yes. You see, there are these Muggles, and the Dementors keep er, haunting them, sort of—well it’s just been a problem in parts of London recently that they’ve been asking us to deal with them as part of my Field Training, and I thought, why not try to improve the conditions some, and then possibly stop the Dementors propagating so much, and save everyone a lot of trouble.”
“Next week then?” he teased lightly, far less artfully fastening Draco’s trousers as he’d done for him.
“That’s transparently false, Potter. Unless we miraculously obtain a Time Turner in the next few hours.”
“I think it’s adequate. A decent option...and the only one at the moment.” Draco paused to look over the map Cassie gave them. “There is the one more place to look at if you’d like to—”
Harry really couldn’t let that stand. “Misery? You're the richest, possibly luckiest prick I know. What d’you have to be miserable about?”
“To start with… a single location—wherein we secure all the premises. Under the proper spells we could disguise it however we like—that’s not important, but this way you could control how far the magic goes, and wrap the whole lot up in wards. It will protect them from being targets for the Dementors, and it stops the Ministry detecting any of our less than legal enchantments. If our first attempt is effective, then we could probably consider expanding the idea to include more locations.”
After a time Harry's eyes were drawn down to Malfoy’s rolled sleeves, and the pale stretch of one exposed forearm in particular. The otherwise unmarked skin was cut through the center with a scar that jagged at the middle as Harry’s did, though was much longer, its ends pointing one down to his wrist and the other up toward the crook of his elbow.
At some point, Draco had summoned tea and sandwiches from the kitchen, and they’d both eaten as Draco went over a number of spells that they could practice individually that might eventually be worked into the whole enchantment. It was also becoming clear that it would likely take Draco several months at least before he was closer to being able to test it all together, and would likely need more time yet to revise the mix after.
Once they had properly showered, they dressed relatively quickly, then parted ways. Draco went off to the library to look into window and curtain modifications, and Harry stayed behind in the ballroom, getting on with as many extensions as he could in the meanwhile.
Harry must’ve looked a bit sulky, because Draco sighed at him in a long-suffering sort of way and waved at the stairs.
Tuesday was uneventful, in so much as he spent most of his time sorting the paperwork he didn’t want to bother with when he got back. He wasn’t sure he’d get through it all before the end of the day, especially as his mind kept wandering over what all he needed to do that night to be ready to leave for Malfoy Manor the next morning—it was quite a lot to keep in his head.
Draco hummed a sort of agreement, staring emotionlessly at his water glass before he seemed to snap himself out of it with a faint sneer. “Far less sadistic. …Anyway, beyond the occasional public event I haven’t seen her in ages—the last time we were here was just before third year. I distinctly remember them discussing Black’s escape.”
Harry moaned again, louder, as Draco had started biting down his chest, paying particular attention and sharpness to his nipple, catching it between his teeth and biting until Harry properly whined for him. Caught between Draco’s mouth and the ladder, Harry squirmed, his cock already aching for release, and throbbing at him each time Draco’s teeth pinched at his skin.
Draco pursed his lips thoughtfully. “Ideally not. That is—if I can sort out a way to insert them all at once, then it might not take too long at all, but I’ll need to head back to the library to do some reading.”
As stiff as his tone was, it occurred to Harry that he might actually be a bit nervous. “Don’t worry so much. It’s only Cassie.”
Harry wished the panicky feeling suddenly slamming in his chest would abate enough he could respond like a normal person who had just been asked to tea. Why was he so
"It’s just completely mad to me that no one’s even considered what magic could do for the least fortunate living without it."
“S’fine, Gin. We were only talking, promise.” Harry held up his hands, illustrating his wand remained tucked safely away in his robes.
He moaned swallowing it, as Harry started sucking impatiently over his Adam’s apple, and lower to bite at the base of his throat. Harry liked knowing he was causing that unsteady hitch in Draco’s breathing, groaning himself at the familiar feel of demanding fingers tangling in his hair. He liked knowing Draco wanted him to bite harder, and very much liked the noises he made when Harry did.
“Harry…we were speaking with Ginny earlier and—Ron and I would like to speak to you soon. Not tonight obviously, he’s completely cabbaged. But soon.”
Somewhat later, Ginny and the other young women present were called out to the front courtyard with Renna and her bridesmaids, to participate in a bouquet tossing.
When they weren’t fucking or talking they were sleeping, and it felt so devilishly good to sleep without worry, not to mention how badly he needed it, that Harry cherished every moment.
Harry was starting to think he might’ve got turned around, or perhaps that he only imagined seeing Malfoy in the first place. He was seeing him so often in his dreams now, perhaps it stood to reason he might start seeing him whilst he was awake too.
“I’d really rather not hang around for another round of mind-numbing bureaucratic babble; any chance you’d be interested in giving me an official Ministry tour?”
As his breathing evened, Draco blinked at him uncomprehendingly before seeming to put together what had just happened.
It was hard to know where things had gone so wildly off track with him and Ginny—nevertheless, Harry knew beyond a doubt that fucking Draco Malfoy on the side was probably not the best way to repair his floundering relationship.
there, that was hard to argue. Not that he really wanted to argue in the first place, he'd only gone out there for some fresh air, and to be alone. What was he meant to do about an irritable Draco Malfoy?
The whole idea was overwhelming on a number of levels, including that he wasn’t sure what might happen spending so many days in a row together—but it was also what they had been working toward for months, and Harry very much wanted it to be successful.
“I—well obviously I don’t want to interfere with your work Mr. Potter. I’m sorry—of course, if it’s that serious, I can keep this to myself. I won’t tell my sister or anyone else that I’ve seen you, er—not that I know anyone else who would
It took several bleary seconds for him to note a number of truths—he was obviously not at home in his slightly lumpy bed, he also somehow managed to sleep through the night completely, and if he’d had any dreams or nightmares he couldn’t remember them.
“Congratulations, Lawrence,” Harry greeted with relief when he finally recalled. He hoped it was the right one, the groom didn’t look offended in any case.
“…Probably not.” Harry might’ve been grinning, if he hadn’t quickly pressed his lips flat together to reign it in.
A quick time spell revealed he had missed lunch, the afternoon ceremonies, tea, and nearly two hours of the ensuing merriment. He needed to find his friends, before someone sent out a search party.
As he spoke, he worked out a neat outline on the lined page. “Here we are, then. There are three main areas we’ll need to discuss. Security, comfort, and the secrecy.”
“By the way, sorry about all the commotion earlier,” he offered from nowhere. “I probably should’ve mentioned Dementors might happen.”
When they reached the great front door, Draco performed a similar ritual and the door opened for them just as the gate had. As they stepped into the long front hall, Draco charmed the door shut again behind them and Harry caught the edge of an enchantment glimmering over the closed door.
Harry woke with a start, and found himself staring up at the worn wooden beams crossing his bedroom ceiling.
He had a fleeting hope Malfoy was not about to tie him to a headstone and try to resurrect Voldemort or anything of the sort, before the Portkey pulled him out of his sitting room and into the middle of a grassy meadow in Wiltshire.
It was somewhat frustrating that despite waving the majority of the entrance testing and school requirements Harry would’ve needed to qualify as an Auror in the first place, the Ministry still made him wait through the customary first year of classes and theory before they would allow him to participate in any field work. Ironically one of the only things all of the theory he was studying agreed upon was there being no real substitute for experience in the field. Many of the skills an Auror would need could only properly be learned by doing, and obviously Harry had done plenty of doing already.
Harry fucked him with mounting abandon, reaching an apex of heat and spilling inside Draco—riding a badly needed spike of bliss with two final artless pumps of his hips.
“You’ve done this before,” he managed to say breathlessly. If he were one to believe in the concept of sin, he could only have called the inside of Malfoy’s mouth sinful—a perfectly surrounding wet heat, swallowing around him every time Harry thrust slowly in.
Hovering partway between the kitchen and the sitting room, Draco watched the exchange curiously. “Who is it?”
Draco let out a whining moan, and Harry chased it relentlessly against the impact of a pale arse shoving back with as much force as Draco could whilst being fucked into the settee cushions. Harry fucked him stubbornly hard, until the swollen length of Draco’s cock, rubbing against the rough upholstery under them, covered it in sticky spurts of seed.
“Why do you think it’s taken me so many months to get this right, Potter? I’ve accounted for all that. The wards should be able to tell the difference—that’s what all the trouble was for.”
“Not yet,” he teased sardonically, rolling over to start nipping small marks along Harry’s collarbone. “I’ll be certain to let you know when you have.”
But despite its problems, in Harry’s opinion it was a decent starter home. Purchased not very long after the start of the new year, it was a part of his evolving grand plan to become the adult he assumed everyone thought he should be. The second part of that plan had involved a somewhat hastily-devised proposal to Ginny on Valentine’s night, just a month or so after he’d got the house.
Savage cut him off with a look that seemed to indicate he ought to reign in his Thestrals a fair bit, and Harry took a deep breath. He forgot, sometimes, that he was not meant to be taking control of his own training sessions. It was only a bit force of habit for him to want to get to the bottom of a problem.
When Harry felt like he could move again without bursting, he pinned Draco flush to the ladder, and Draco’s cock twitched between them as Harry thrust into him deep again, seeking out a pleasure centre to overwhelm.
With a tight groan, Malfoy bit into the curve of his shoulder through his shirt, narrow hips picking up a quicker pace. Harry was fighting so hard not to—but that small bit of knowledge and—
Despite his wry tone, Harry glanced up to consider him earnestly. Draco only arched an expectant eyebrow, so he got on with skimming the letter. In no time at all he was smiling a little soppily at the parchment.
He thought he saw an imperceptible flinch cross Malfoy’s face then, but he couldn’t really be sure—and had been trying not to stare overly long at him for most of the afternoon anyway.
Ron’s throwing force had grown more powerful in recent years, but then Harry’s had as well, both of them filling out some from the awkward teenagers they had been.
Harry hesitated, but decided to be honest. “I’ve got the house to myself tonight…I was planning to attempt properly repainting the attic.”
“You gave me so much shit about my parents being dead, but maybe you might’ve been happier without yours.”
“Have you spoken with Cassie about possible locations?” Draco queried, breaking Harry out of his reflection.
“There wasn’t the time to make any. Honestly, I hadn’t expected you’d want to do this so soon, or I might’ve been more prepared.”
The Portkey was, to Harry’s surprise, an actual key. Tarnished and worn at the edges, the skeleton key felt heavy in his hand when he unwound it from the parchment scroll. He could already hear Ginny in his head telling him he ought to check it for curses—and he’d had too horrible an experience with Portkeys in the past not to be absolutely
Harry liked Draco’s soup much better than he expected, and said as much, though Draco dismissed the praise.
It would be his last stop for the day, but he popped in to the rowdy pub just down the road for a pint before he headed home. Cassie had given him quite a lot to think about, but it sounded as though what he had uncovered was only just the tip of the iceberg. He was sure he didn’t have all of the answers he needed, but he thought it was enough that he could give Malfoy a starting point—he only needed to make his letter vague enough to provide them plausible deniability.
Friday morning found him frowning into his tea in the kitchen, his mind warring with itself over whether or not it was reasonable for him to even
Partway through the first pile, it only took an unthinking glance to be struck by the increasingly frequent inclination to snog Draco silly, while he had the chance—but then he really didn’t want to be Transfiguring draperies all day.
Draco tipped his head back to expose even more of his throat before he shared his thoughts. “The good news is I think I’ve finally got the figures right—enough I can start weaving them all together again.”
“We’ve been making good progress. A few more hours tonight and we could probably finish by late tomorrow, couldn’t we?”
“We’ll both need to get this right before we go introducing any of the modification enchantments—rooms, locks, decor—that sort of thing.”
“Luna, I think. It’s her owl. Yes, alright—hello Gordon. Sorry, I haven’t got any treats on me.” Harry scritched at his head to stop him nipping at his fingers.
As the lust-daze faded and his breathing steadied out, rather than drifting right to sleep, Harry found himself lazily recounting some of the day’s events in his head, and one in particular.
“I might be a little out of practice,” Harry confessed. “I haven’t been up here since Ginny was preparing for the League Cup, and that was in April.”
Adjusting the chair, Harry gave it a wandless shove and sent it sliding to a stop in front of one mirrored wall. He raised his eyebrows questioningly, waiting for a connection, or an approval.
As they parted breathless again, much of Draco’s smugness had faded behind the deepening desire in his eyes. “Tell me.”
“You said it yourself, Malfoy. We need to get back, we don’t have time to explore every mystery in this place.”
Harry wasn’t sure if the ticking from the previous room was haunting him or if he could actually hear the moment slipping away from him. Malfoy’s voice was still playing havoc on his nerves, tickling across the shell of his ear now, and he felt his body responding far faster than he was strictly accustomed to.
Draco needed a moment to collect himself, and he carefully tucked his important bits back into his pants before he got around to addressing the question.
“They require more maintenance—haven’t got the sticking power of heating or cooling. We’d need to patch them up regularly, on a bi-monthly basis at the very least.”
There had been many times in his life Harry had wished the Dursleys would’ve kicked him out, but he knew in truth—as horrid as they were—he had been lucky to have even his small cupboard, and later the second bedroom, warm and dry, and not forced to sleep alone on the streets of London.
“C’mon, Malfoy. I’ve helped plenty of other people learn it, and you’ve helped me a fucking lot recently. Let me return the favour for once.”
Filling a small bag with a few things he’d been meaning to work on, Harry took the Floo to Draco’s library after work on Wednesday as if he’d been invited, though he hadn’t actually been. If Draco didn’t want him popping by unexpectedly, he could’ve easily closed his Floo after Harry’s surprise birthday visit—but he hadn’t.
As morning dawned on that bright and cool October day, it was actually quite a big day for him, as it marked the one-year anniversary of the start of his Auror training, and as such, the first day he would be allowed to do more than purely theoretical Auror work. He only hoped the lack of a good night’s rest would not catch up to him.
Listening to those same steps pace restlessly nearby, Harry waved his wand in careful motion for the last interlinked lines of Latin.
Thankfully today, finally, he could move on from purely theorising and start doing something that actually made a difference in the world again. Hermione had been out there for almost a year now, already pushing boundaries in her new Ministry role. In some respects, he felt he’d fallen quite far behind.
When Harry stepped out of the hearth, he didn’t bother to say hello or undress first. He cast a quick spell to clear the soot and crossed the room to settle himself flush to Draco’s backside.
There was a pause wherein Harry let out all the air he had been holding in, and promptly felt his heart stop when Ginny spoke again.
Harry wouldn’t argue. There was a lot more work to do before the night was over, and he would be worthless if he were too knackered to keep up—not to mention he doubted he’d make it to any sort of celebrating either.
He was a bit fear-shocked, and a little bewildered, but Harry had to shelve his questions to assure they were both alright.
“Someone’s decorator went overboard,” Harry announced, joining her at the edge of the room and nodding towards the chandelier hovering above them all, its crystals tinselled with glowing pixies.
Harry had not been back in the three years since he had lost Sirius, though he had seen the Veil so many times in his dreams, whispering to him. Would it call to him again if he went to it?
“Not nearly, no,” Draco admitted immediately. “There’s lots to do, but it will have to wait until I’ve had a chance to look over some things back at the Manor and—I think I might need to meet this Cassie woman. I have some questions, and I’d like to make my own assessment whether we can trust her not to go spouting off things that might get us both arrested for breaking International Wizarding Law. If we’re
Writhing under him, Draco murmured his next in deliciously lust-low tones, with no small amount of smugness. “You know exactly how to fuck me now, don’t you?”
When Harry appeared in his sitting room that evening, in a cloud of soot, Ginny was already home from the Burrow.
understand, Mr. Potter. I don’t want to get into any trouble with the Ministry. I can keep your visits to myself, and whatever else we discuss.”
“It was guilt, really,” Draco said bluntly, frowning. “I quite liked Dobby, and she—well. It’s over now.”
“I told him it was over, and with any luck he’ll be smart enough to keep the secret to blackmail me with later. Also, I have my doubts anyone would believe him.”
They awaited the arrival of their breakfast out in the tent’s cosy kitchen. When it had all arrived, Draco charmed their bottles frosty with two sharp taps of his wand, and they sat down at the round wooden table to eat. It didn’t take them very long, after several years at Hogwarts they were both more than capable of eating quickly when they needed to.
He shrugged awkwardly while Draco stared at him with narrowed silver eyes, suspicious despite their bleariness.
In a flash, he felt back to their school days, when she could always see right through his less than well-thought plans.
He was only in jeans and a t-shirt—what he always wore to hunt down Dementors these days—but Harry swallowed tightly watching the corner of Draco’s lower lip catch between his teeth for the briefest of seconds.
Almost as an afterthought, he snatched Harry’s wand from the desk and cast a swift cleaning charm over them both. It was never a perfect kind of clean, but it would work until either of them could find the time to shower.
Draco panted heavily over his lips, speeding a rhythm to ride him properly, hard, until Harry came for him—right when he asked. He kept up the roll of his hips as Harry stroked him more roughly, until he was shooting hot between them—moaning louder as he tensed all around Harry’s spent cock.
Harry drank his drink and tried not to think about what all he would be recovering from. In the morning, he was meant to be out with Savage looking into some reports of a few more-dangerous-than-usual Dark Magic artifacts being trafficked out of Borgin and Burkes.
Harry pushed himself properly upright again when he’d found his senses, groping around for his glasses somewhere on the desk.
It was Harry’s turn to moan loudly, his cock twitching dangerously close—but he didn’t stop. Panting with effort, he bumped his lips into the soft edge of Draco’s ear, speeding up as much as he could without losing the hard hit of his cock.
His voice carried, weighted with deadly seriousness. He was so focused on Draco that he didn’t spare a thought for the fact Zabini was there to hear everything they said. Draco’s lips flattened to a tight line, and Harry wished he didn’t want so badly to bite them swollen-red.
Even forcing the words out raised an annoying twist of anxiety in him. He shouldn’t be nervous—it wasn’t a fucking date, it was a practical suggestion, or so he went on insisting to himself.
Purring a lusty vibration, Draco started squeezing with practised pressure all around his balls, and Harry quickly fell into an aggressively pleasurable apex, arching off the wall to throb generous spurts into his waiting mouth.
He supposed he might’ve been angrier at Malfoy’s disrespect to the dead, to the War, and to everyone’s grief but—as Harry’s eyes dilated faintly—he didn’t entirely disagree. He’d never really wanted to be there in the first place.
When his break hour arrived, he waved off Savage’s offer to buy him lunch at his new favorite chip shop—claiming he was popping over to the Leaky for a nap in one of their rooms. But Harry didn’t go to the Leaky Cauldron, he went to see Cassie.
As he had been directed, he kept on until he’d found the third office down on the left side of the hall. The door was already cracked, so he knocked lightly on its open doorway instead.
Draco’s breathless cursing cut into a throaty moan, shuddering stiff against Harry, and coming hard as he spattered their stomachs with each hot spasm of his cock.
For the last few hours of the evening, they were busy Transfiguring lamps out of a large number of vases Draco had summoned from the manor’s cellar. He’d promised they weren’t cursed or enchanted in any way, but Harry still cast several scanning spells over the pile of them when he wasn’t looking, just in case.
Harry had also done some of his own research on what Draco had outlined in his notes, so that he might have a slightly better idea of the work involved in what was being proposed.
“Just look for clocks,” he repeated. “Hall of Prophecy will be through there—if there’s anything left of it.”
“Not yet then.” Draco shifted up to press into a kiss, his tongue teasing distractingly where Harry was just biting.
It was fairly easy to spot Ginny again amongst the other attendees, given how she stood out. Harry also couldn’t help but notice she was looking particularly lovely that evening. Her copper curls were drawn up in a high bun, though a few fly-away strands still escaped to brush against the shoulders of a rose-coloured gown.
“I have no idea. We might need to try them all—but we’re looking for the one with all the clocks, and… trying to avoid the big stone room with the great murderous arch in.”
He was also slightly sore yet, what with all his activity over the weekend. The longer they stayed in the air he could feel his thighs threatening to cramp where they hugged to his broom.
He'd told Ginny he was going out shopping, and planned a time to meet with Draco when he knew Ginny had plans to be at the Burrow for tea—so that she wouldn’t be around to hear his destination.
“That would be brilliant,” Harry admitted with some obvious relief. “But really, any help you’re willing to offer would be. Thanks Cassie.”
“All I have to say on the matter,” he said, examining his nails. “Is that Slytherin House had a number of interesting parties.”
“Not like we’ve never done it before,” Harry pointed out, chewing at his lip. “Only I guess normally we’re naked at the time.”
Letting him down to find his feet again as the ecstasy abated, Harry’s cock slipped out rather lewdly. He felt somewhat pleasure-delirious pulling Draco flushly closer to kiss him, exploring fingers sliding down between the curves of his arse to trail the soft of his middle finger around the wet contracting circle of Draco’s hole, teasing through some of his own escaping come.
“Through the gate there, just up the street. If we’re fast we might avoid getting completely sodden.”
“Right yeah, but it’s definitely the right thing to do. People really need the help, and the Dementors are only getting worse.”
Harry kissed him quite hard as he pulled out, and was surprised at how much Draco’s moan then turned him on, despite what they had just finished doing. But Harry somehow found the self-control to do what any reasonable person should, and started looking about for his pants.
