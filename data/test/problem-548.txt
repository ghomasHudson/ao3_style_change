Moments later, Harry, Aviary and Draco landed in front of Number 12, Grimmauld Place. Or, as what the muggles, Draco and Aviary saw, an empty alley between Number 11 and Number 13 Grimmauld Place.
Seb looked up as Harry entered, “Back to watch me, I suppose? I knew I would be getting a babysitter today.”
“Ida, Padma and Brayan did the interviewing. So Remmins wasn’t present during the actual interrogation. But, as you know, Savant lets Aurors watch the interrogation via his pensieve,” Harry nodded again. Savant believed that having every Auror watch interrogations for big cases like this allowed the entire group to have a stronger idea of the case.
“He’s Head of Games and Sports, Ron,” Ginny pointed out rather fiercely, “I think his opinions are something to pay attention to.”
“Next,” Seb said conversationally as if nothing had happened, “We are planning on organizing a LGBTQ wizarding rights protest. It’s out of my technical career bonds as an activist, since I deal primarily with non-human rights, but I have many dimensions and it needs to be done. Well, done more often. There’s been protests before.”
“Astoria, you know I think nothing of the sorts. I was only saying it would be hard for Scorpius to give up the obligatory hour it would take to explain his knowledge of hippogriffs to Potter,” Malfoy smiled down at his son, something Harry realized he did with ease.
“Of course,” Draco murmured, taking his head out of his hands to glance at Harry, “I’ll always be there for you.”
“Thank goodness,” Darius breathed a sigh of relief, “I can’t believe you, and so many others, won’t be able to have any more children. And it’s all because of my own father. My whole life, I’ve never known my father, but I always imagined him as someone who was like me. Who worked hard for a greater good. I thought I couldn’t know him because my mom didn’t want to involve him in a life with a witch. But I was wrong, I couldn’t know him because he was the exact opposite of the man I have become. He is someone who wanted the destruction of others and went to great lengths to find a way to do just that. It’s just so… devastating.”
“Ron!” called a voice from across the room. Harry spotted Padma rushing out of her office. She spotted Harry and Remmins and stopped, “Harry! Ida is in Auror Savant’s office. She’s expecting you.”
Harry was fully prepared to say yes when he remembered taking food from a stranger at a time like this was anything but a good idea. The security measures at the match were the best the Ministry could provide; Harry had never seen so many Ministry officials at a match in his life, and he had been to a quidditch world cup. Harry also knew that Blaise, Seamus and the entire Games and Sports Department had worked hard to do background checks on anyone serving food or doing any other service at the match. So, before answering his daughter, Harry stole a glance at Blaise. To his relief, Blaise was beaming as he ordered two large pretzels from the trolley wizard. Taking this as a sign of safety- Blaise would know if these vendors weren’t approved- Harry told his kids they could get whatever they wanted. All of them wanted pretzels, so Harry asked the wizard for four pretzels. After paying for them, he passed them out and watched as the kids gave signs of contentedness upon biting into the pretzel. He had to admit: the pretzel hit the spot. As the trolley wizard moved down the row, Harry continued to watch the match. He turned to Luna to strike up a conversation, suddenly in a much better mood, when Luna grasped his arm and shouted, “Look!”
Harry slowly opened his eyes, bright lights obstructing his vision as he tried to place his surroundings. Ron materialized in front of him, all red hair and freckles. Harry then saw Ron’s dark Auror robes and everything that happened came rushing back to him. He shot up quickly and frantically looked around.
“Shh!” Bill said, faking a worried expression as looked over at Ron, who was now arriving with Rose and Hermione, “Ron’ll hear!”
Harry grabbed his coat and apparated to the chorus of “byes” and “love yous” and “right hand greens!” coming from the room.
Harry stood up abruptly as Malfoy moved to walk out of the cafe, “You bloody well will not! I may not be an Auror anymore, but I care what happens to wizarding society! I'm not going to sit back and let you do this on your own when I can help!” Harry finished, breathless, and refused to look away from Malfoy as the man stood stunned in front of him.
“Yes,” Draco answered, “Multiple large boxes were sent there. My guess is that they were disguised as quidditch equipment.”
“Draco’s bug,” Ron explained from over Harry’s shoulder, “After the fighting ended, we realized you and Draco were missing. Padma went to her office to trace you. It took some time, but we were eventually able to pick up a signal.”
Almost immediately, Harry came into contact with a masked figure after leaving his spot on the ground. The two battled; the figure didn’t seem like they were aiming to kill, just to stop Harry from going near Draco. He eventually ended him with a strong Petrificus Totalus and wove his way around chairs, still struggling to see despite all the light from wands. Then he saw Draco, illuminated by the wand light of his duel with another masked figure. As if in slow motion, Harry spotted another figure behind Draco, wand pointed directly at his back…
Harry was busy counting the number of postcards from Cambodia (he had always wanted to go there), when a loud “fucking shit!” tore his eyes away from the walls and drew them to Draco. He had walked into the room, dressed in a soft white t-shirt and, no joke, fucking sweatpants. His hair was wet from what Harry guessed had been a shower, and it hung in strings across his face. Harry realized Draco was most likely looking for an explanation, so he said simply, “I was wondering if I could come through?”
“Of course!” Harry replied, finally glad to know Malfoy trusted him to help. He didn't agree to do something this dangerous for nothing.
Blaise swatted him on the arm, “I’m not, you wanker! I’m just surprised! I’ve known Blaise for awhile now, and I had no idea he and Ginny were involved at all,” he made a face as if he were considering it, “Although, I suppose it makes sense. He did spend an awful lot of time at Cannons practice when I told him they had been monitored enough.”
Harry sat in the canteen, trying to enjoy the moment of peace before he started another round of practice demonstrations. On demonstration days, Brayan had each trainee attempt a task in front of all the trainees for the duration of the day. As a result, the day had been monotonous and tiring, and all Harry wanted to do was go home and starfish on his bed. Harry took another bite of his ham and cheese sandwich and let out a long sigh. His brain began to drift to the night before, when he came home as the sun began to set to find Ginny sitting in their living room, reading a book to James, Al and Lily. Harry had been expecting another long conversation and desperate apology from himself after the kids went to bed, but Ginny barely spoke to him. She briefly asked him if everything had gone well at the hospital, to which Harry said yes. He almost threw in a fake story about his supposed time at the hospital, but decided that was a step too far. Now he had no idea where he and Ginny stood and whether or not they planned on talking, like really talking, anytime soon.
James looked as though he was about to protest, but one glance at the look on Molly’s face sent him into the other room with Lily and Albus in tow.
“You tried to save my life,” Draco said, barely loud enough for Harry to hear, but it echoed in his head and drowned out all his thoughts.
Harry nodded, “Of course, Aviary,” he turned to look at Draco, “Draco and I have been working together for months on the Imperius attack case.”
Harry had never heard her voice sound like this. He was used to Aviary’s voice always having a hint of optimism, a tone that told Harry that she believed everything would always work out. But Harry heard none of that in her voice at the moment. Although he knew her boyfriend that she cared about deeply had just died out of suspicious circumstances, he had a dark feeling what she was about to say was somehow much worse than that.
“She didn’t have time to figure it out,” Ron explained, “She left immediately after hearing this in the hopes of getting help from the other Aurors. We all rushed to help as soon as she told us, but we were too late. Remmins was already dead by the time we got there.”
“What?!” Harry exclaimed, “No, that can’t be right! Brayan is a good man, a hard worker. Is he even a pureblood?”
Reimmins shook his head, “It’s too dangerous. The Ministry is on a complete lockdown from visitors today. This is the only entrance that will admit the few visitors are still allowed.”
Harry laughed, “I agree. All the articles on me are pointless now. My life has become quite mundane,” he paused to look at Malfoy, “I understand where your frustration is coming from, and I don’t blame you for being upset.”
“Fleur said the first time she accidentally used magic was when she changed her aunt’s outfit by thinking about how ugly she thought it to be. And, of course, Victore’s was when she saved the cat from falling out the window. It was only likely that Louie’s first time would be just as dramatic,” Bill said conversationally to his father.
Harry waited until she called his name, then took the piece of paper from her. He almost doubled over in shock; he knew the two patients on his list! Written in thick black ink was ‘Blaise Zabini and Aries Reyes: Quidditch Accidents. Room 06 and 07’. He wondered what had landed Blaise and Aries in the hospital. Neither of them were quidditch players and they were unlikely to be found together if they could help it. Ginny had told him stories of how almost all of the Games and Sports Department couldn’t stand Aries. Maybe the accident wasn’t related, but Harry doubted the two coincidentally had quidditch accidents on the same morning. Harry desperately wished for a new assignment, as he didn’t want to see Blaise or Aries. Aries was a prat who would be miserable to deal with, and Blaise seemed like an awkward situation because he was so close with Draco. Harry didn’t need any more questions about his friendship with Draco, he was still barely processing it himself. But complaining was pointless; exceptions were only ever made if the trainees had too close of a relationship with the patients, and Harry hardly knew Blaise or Aries. Harry began to make his way to room 06, mentally preparing for a day of anger and awkwardness.
Ida didn’t answer. She began grabbing papers and shuffling through until she found one with an official looking one with the Ministry logo on it.
“Harry…” Padma said hesitantly, “If you are talking about that group Karich, or Keach, or whatever, those are all ridiculous rumors probably started by paranoid witches and wizards fearing the return of Voldemort’s influence. None of it’s true.”
“Expelliarmus!'' The spell caught Harry off guard as it hit him from the side. He turned around quickly to see Ida. She held his wand in her hand, a smile forming across her face. His anger drowned out the rest of the noise around him. Thinking of nothing but revenge, he lunged at Ida.
“We are going to need your statement, too, Harry,” Ida said. Her arm was now wrapped around Padma, who was sniffling silently. Aviary and Ron had begun to bag evidence again.
“No, I didn’t,” He said shortly, not daring to look at Draco. He didn’t know what was happening to him, but he knew looking at Draco would only make matters worse.
Harry couldn’t see if the spell hit Ida, as the room divulged into chaos. The protego charm splintered apart as Auror after Auror sent spells at Kareach members. Harry broke his own charm and looked widely around him. He was almost immediately confronted by a large figure in the same black mask he had witnessed weeks ago at the hospital attack. He quickly dodged a spell shot his way. Thankful he had years of Auror training, he impulsively cast an expelliarmus. The wand flew from the man’s hand and towards Harry, who caught it and dove behind another Kareach member.
“If this is true, then we have you to thank for finding out before it’s too late,” she began collecting papers, “I need to talk to Aviary and Savant straight away! And if my guess is correct, they are both still at the office.”
Harry choked on his own drink as she said this, “Why do I have to choose? What do I know about blokes?”
“Harry, what’re you…” he broke off as he spotted Malfoy, “Oh. What is he doing here? Did you have another interview with him?”
“Draco,” Harry began again, softly but as firmly as he could manage, “I know it seems absurd. I swear to you I didn’t want to…”
“Of course I’m here to talk about that!” Harry nearly shouted. He steadied himself and looked at Draco. He opened his mouth to continue, but found he didn’t really know how to talk about it.
“And as much as I would like to pet this little bugger for the rest of the day, I suppose we need to talk about whatever this emergency is about.”
Caser shrugged, “Probably not. She’s barely stopped working ever since she took the job in Paris. I doubt she remembers she has a son.”
“Oh, Draco! A Black! I thought this day would never come. I know your parents would never have raised you to join that awful Potter and his friends! You are certainly here to take back the house, aren’t you, my dear?” she gushed.
As he made his way back to the canteen, his mind was spinning rapidly. He figured Draco would be up in the conference rooms, and the idea made him both excited and anxious. He needed to see Draco again, make sure for himself that he was alright. But he also didn’t know how to face him. Not after he had acknowledged actual feelings for him. Harry was suddenly bursting with a need to get his sexuality off his chest. He wasn’t straight. He never was. He wished he could have figured this out years ago, when almost all his fellow Gryffindors were announcing their own sexualities. Dating and marrying Ginny is what had made sense to him at the time. She was an incredible woman and was from a family he knew and loved. The two of them being together had seemed non-negotiable in his mind for years. So he had ignored, for so long, any implications that he was anything but attracted to women, anything but attracted to Ginny. His sudden bouts of anger with Draco, his uncontrollable desires towards him, all began to make sense. Harry felt dizzy as he made his way off the lift and to the conference rooms. Remmins was waiting outside the door of conference room C, and waved Harry over when he saw him. Harry began to look frantically for Draco as he walked towards the door, but he was nowhere to be found. He told himself to snap out of it. What mattered now was the statement, and he was sure Draco would agree.
Without thinking, he told Luna he was heading to the loo and made his way through the legs of his family towards the side entrance. Harry looked through the swarm of people milling around the entrance, looking for the all too familiar blond head. After a few moments of searching, he spotted Draco alone, leaning against the bleachers with a notepad in his hand. Harry would have almost given a laugh at the sight of Draco scribbling furiously in the small notebook with his full size quill (which Harry assumed he just carried around with him) if it wasn’t for the look of panic on Draco’s face. Harry made his way through the crowd to him.
Harry smiled as he watched the Twister game begin and tried to ignore the disappointment he felt at leaving his kids for far less fun ventures.
“That’s why I was calling you earlier, before you grabbed me and took me to the dirty house of my ancestors,” Draco explained, “I found out something more about the case!”
“I’m here to get you in. But before we do anything, you all need to know the plan,” Ron’s words tumbled over one another as he spoke.
“Auror Savant,” Harry interrupted wearily before this got out of hand. The Aurors around them were watching with silent interest, “I am going to remain a trainee for the time being. It’s the job I need to do right now.”
“How is Zabini as the department head? He always seemed like an entitled prat to me, but Kingsley appears to be rather fond of him.”
He had told Ginny he had been meeting regularly with a group of trainees to prepare for the finals of their first year of healer training. The tests were notoriously near impossible, so it made perfect sense that a group of trainees would take to preparing together. He thought Ginny believed him, as she showed no signs of doubting him as she had before. It could be because she was immersed in training for the Cannons as she prepared for the last few matches and ultimately the match against Puddlemere. The two teams still held the highest total scores in the region, so it was now looking certain that they would be playing each other (although it had seemed certain for a while, talk of who would be in the championship had been mainly assumptions until now). Last year the Cannons had lost to Puddlemere in the championship, so Harry knew how determined Ginny was to win, especially with Aries Reyes as a coach. The prick had already sent an owl to their house with an apology letter stating ‘Sorry for the humiliation the Cannons will have to endure in the upcoming match’. Ginny, obviously, had not taken the letter well and had retaliated with a note of her own that Harry would never wish to repeat himself. All in all, Ginny didn’t really seem to acknowledge that he was gone most of the time. Harry had been taking the kids to Molly’s frequently when Ginny was too busy to come home for the evenings. He felt bad about all of this: he knew he shouldn’t be lying to both Ginny and Molly about where he was during weeknights and the afternoons of weekends (Molly also thought he was in a trainee study group), but Harry didn’t know how they would respond. Although Ginny was apparently friendly with Blaise, who was still a good friend of Malfoy’s, he knew she still didn’t think highly of Malfoy. Only last week she had called their rude neighbor a ‘Malfoy type’, to which Harry had almost choked on the soup he was eating. He also knew Ginny would want to know all about the investigation, and Harry didn’t want to have to explain the potential danger he was putting himself in aiding Malfoy. The more he learned about Malfoy’s investigation, the more he began to think Kareach was real. The risk could be impending, and he didn’t want Ginny to think he was risking his family or herself to help someone she still thought of as an enemy. To add to all of this, Harry hadn’t told Ginny he had stopped therapy (he was pretending some of his meetings with Malfoy were therapy sessions). He had planned to tell her, but then thought it would mean so much to her to know he was finding a way to work through his issues. He thought it best for Ginny right now if she thought his own life was turning around.
“Mum wanted me to tell you that she left for work early. Apparently Brent Buckley injured his arm and Mum doesn’t know whether or not he can play for the remainder of the season. Albus said that’s bloody good luck because Buckley is a prick and I agree, but Mum was upset,” James reported.
Draco stopped in front of Harry suddenly. Then he picked up the chair in front of him and threw it violently across the room at the wall. Thankfully, the chair was metal and did not break, but it did make a rather large clunking sound that echoed around the room, only disturbed by Draco’s equally large yelp of frustration.
Malfoy met his gaze and then suddenly looked down, “And I shouldn't have agreed,” he murmured. He began to align his papers back into his binder, “I'm taking you off the case,” he said bitterly.
“I thought we would be more comfortable up here, farther away from the main hall,” Harry stated. This room was the one they had spent the most time redecorating when they were renovating the house after the war. It was completely modernized, any trace of Black memorabilia gone.
Draco pursed his lips together, “Okay, then. Tell me why you are here tonight. Tell me why you are so hesitant to say something that’s clearly important, as you showed up at my house at four in the morning.”
Harry crossed the room now, feeling the need to comfort her he has felt for years. He reached down for her hands and looked at her until she met his eyes.
Harry sent her a side glare and watched as the room broke into confused questions. He reexplained to everyone how Draco was a decent bloke with good intentions and that they were just friends.
Harry woke up and slowly opened his eyes. He could tell by the light streaming in through the window he needed to get up. He ran his hand along his side table until he found his glasses and placed them over his eyes. Harry blinked slowly as he adjusted to the room around him, half alight in the morning glow of the sun. He instinctively rolled over on his side to greet Ginny, hopefully to ease some of the memories that were quickly resurfacing form last night by talking to her before she had to leave for work. To his dismay but not necessarily surprise, Ginny’s side of the bed was empty and her pajamas were tossed carelessly on top of her pillow, suggesting she had gotten dressed and left the room. The absence of Ginny when he woke up was becoming a regular occurrence. When they first moved in together, both Ginny and Harry made it a habit to wait in bed for the other person to wake up. Ginny had started the tradition; she had once told Harry “nothing was better to wake up to than the person you love.” Harry had grown to love the tradition. It was reassuring to wake up with Ginny’s face peering at him or vice versa. Even on days when one of them needed to wake up early, the other was up with them. If he and Ginny were still following this unspoken rule, Ginny would have woken Harry up around 7:00 when she started getting ready for today’s practice. Harry slept like a rock; any alarm he had set in the past ten years of marriage didn’t come close to waking him, and he had tried everything (I mean, he had magic at his disposal. His unsuccessful attempts at an effective alarm weren’t without merit). But the fact that Ginny hadn’t woken up next to him in well over a week’s time made Harry feel unsettled. He knew she had her team and the kids to attend to, but Harry wanted to be a part of those things desperately. He had never wanted Ginny to feel as though the kids were anything but a joint responsibility. He knew Ginny knew this. Harry had been at her side for early morning chaos for longer than he could remember. However, lately, it was if Ginny took no qualms in handling it all by herself. She wanted to wake up by herself, take care of the kids by herself. It made Harry feel lost as a husband and as a father. He wanted to be there for Ginny and to feel she wanted him to be there for her. And more than anything, he wanted, no needed, their once crucial early morning talks. Harry felt like his brain was exploding with the instability of the past weekend, and Ginny was the one he usually talked to when he felt this way.
Harry knew this was the best way to describe the situation, but he could tell the room wasn’t taking to it. James was silently fuming and Rose had begun to cry, causing Albus to put an arm around her shoulder. Ron was shaking his head furiously in disbelief.
Harry’s mood shifted as he took in this news. Healer Patrick was the head Healer of the Second floor, which dealt with magical ailments and diseases. Although Harry had yet to decide what department he wanted to work in after he completed training, working on the second floor was definitely on the table.
Ida shook her head, “Harry, Kareach is just a fantasy. Brayan confessed that he forced young purebloods to work for him. That’s how he managed to make these attacks as widespread as they were.”
“We’re not denying it,” Blaise said matter-of-factly, “Our plan is that she becomes best friends with Lacey and they keep each other busy whenever they are together.”
“Aviary?” he asked, suddenly highly alert. He tried to read her expression to see what news she had for him, “What is it? Did you investigate Blaise?”
Harry stared at Caser. There was a lingering sadness in his eyes that Harry hadn’t noticed before. So maybe Caser did have his mother to look up to while he was growing up. But he also dealt with an unspoken difficulty while his mother paid more attention to her profession than him. Harry, on the other hand, had endless love and support from friends and family. Harry had to remind himself that people’s lives can’t be based on who their family consisted of, but what their family consisted of.
“No,” Harry snapped, suddenly angry, “It’s all true! All of it! You should be doing more to stop it instead of sitting around in muggle towns!”
“I don’t think he’s as much of a prick as he was at school,” Dean claimed, “Blaise says he’s a “reformed spirit”, whatever that means.”
“Seb! The guy you’ve been going to tea with? You kept telling me how fun and easy-going he is. I knew there was something more going on when you wouldn’t shut up about him.”
“Harry!” shrieked Ginny, running the length of the hallway towards him, “What in the actual fuck did you do?”
“Go Puddlemere!” Roxy shouted, appearing behind George with a Puddlemere flag in hand. Harry noticed that both her and Fred were dressed head to toe in blue and gold.
“Hermione!” he shouted, running toward her. To Harry’s surprise, Hermione was not asleep. Draco’s spells must have worked wonders. She was sitting up in bed, still orange as a carrot, but awake and seemingly alert.
“Harry,” Ginny grabbed his chin and pointed it up towards her, “Long story short, Blaise has given me an outlet to talk and address things about myself that I didn’t know I needed. Just don’t be afraid of real help. We both are still learning how to do that.”
Freezing, Harry let loose a string of curses in his head as he turned to face Ginny. He knew full well he did not look like he had been at the hospital working for the past several hours. He was still in the t-shirt and worn out jeans he had been wearing before he left the house and he reeked of a smell that completely suggested he had been at a bar. He slowly turned to look at his wife, guilt building up like a brick lodged in his chest.
At first Harry thought Malfoy was going to tell him he didn’t actually want Harry to help him with the investigation. Although he had said Harry could help, he had a hard time believing Malfoy meant it. But Malfoy’s since of justice and good reporting must of won over his hesitancy towards involving Harry, because the two soon fell into a regular pattern of meeting to talk about the investigation, everything from what Malfoy had found from trailing people he thought could be members (something that made Harry very nervous) and Harry telling Malfoy anything that went on in the hospital. They had taken to meeting two to three times a week, each meeting decided by Malfoy, who was perhaps the most organized person Harry had ever met. While Harry took messy and inconsistent notes, Malfoy wrote everything neat and tidy and kept binders upon binders of organized notes. The weekly meetings were quickly becoming a part of Harry’s life, as normal as going to training or the Burrow on Sunday.
Suddenly, Harry could feel himself moving upwards to a standing position. Relief surged through him, believing he had done this himself. But as his back came into contact with another hard surface, he realized someone had merely moved him into a standing position. He was finally able to make out more of the room than the blinding overhead lights. The room was barren, painted completely white. The only other thing in the room Harry could see was a long black board, propped up across from him. It was beginning to resonate in Harry how royally fucked he truly was.
“I meant they didn’t have any today. And I went up before you,” Harry remembered the only options being peach and cherry.
“Fred, there really is no need to scream,” turning to Harry, Angelina exclaimed, “Really, Harry, I am so sorry!” over the sounds of the shouts coming from the other side of the room as Harry’s kids greeted their cousins.
“Well, that’s hardly any, Ms. Patrick,” the patient flattered, “You look not a day older than twenty-five.”
Harry wanted to protest, but he found himself at a loss for words. It reminded him of his reason for fighting as hard as he did, all those years ago. He needed to avenge the ones he had loss and fight for a better life for the ones he still had.
“Don’t worry,” Hermione reassured, “The poison can’t affect a pregnancy that is already underway. There should be no complications from the poison if I stay careful for the next couple of months.”
“Do you two want me to take you home?” Harry asked, “Or you can stay. Either way. Just don’t feel pressured to.”
But it wasn’t until one o’clock that he heard Ginny arrive via the Floo. A few moments later, Ginny walked into the room, dressed in a sweatshirt and a pair of jeans.
“Madam Pomfrey let you help her?” Harry asked, amazed. Madam Pomfrey was the most self-sufficient witch he had ever met. She could cure any quidditch injury without batting an eye.
“Harry,” Draco looked nervous, which Harry hadn’t ever seen, “That’s how I feel. About you. Sitting in the hallway all day gave me time to think. You’re right. Not about everything, but about most of the ridiculous things we’ve fought about. I… I don’t know how to handle feelings. Mainly because I’ve never had real ones,” he paused for  a second, then looked slowly into Harry’s eyes, “I don’t want to be a quick fuck or any shit like that. I want to be your boyfriend. For once in my life, you make being in a relationship seem like a fantastic idea. The truth is, I’ve spent so much of my life counting on myself. It’s taken me a long time to learn to trust. So, when I started falling for you, it seemed like a terrible idea. You were married, for fuck’s sake, and you had an entire life that wouldn’t make much sense with me in it. But later, after you and Ginny broke up, it suddenly became a possibility. And that somehow scared me more. The idea of you wanting to be with me seemed insane. I kept telling myself that you didn’t know what you wanted, that I was just someone to experiment with while you figured out how to get your life back on track.”
“Rachel,” Harry hesitated. He felt bad telling this girl, who was looking at him with a passion that reminded him of himself at her age, that she couldn’t stay and fight because she was Brayan’s assistant, not an actual Auror. He wasn’t either, so it felt rather pointless to stay.
“Actually, Molly…” he hesitated, not wanting to say he was leaving the Burrow before eating lunch, “I have to go. Healer emergency.”
Before Harry could stop himself, he blurted, “Surely that isn’t true? I mean, Malfoy can’t be gay, or bisexual, or whatever?”
“Sorry about that,” Malfoy said, placing a hand on his son’s shoulders, “You been bothering my son, Potter?”
“Harry, not to be rude, but I’m not taking in anything you’re saying,” Draco gave a small grin as he stared not so subtly at Harry’s lips
Aviary nodded. Something flashed in her eyes: determination, resilience, injustice. She was ready to fight.
Draco nodded and stared back at Harry. Then he suddenly jumped off and walked out of the room. Harry looked at the empty doorway, trying to understand what had just happened. Did Draco know? Had looking directly at him been a mistake? But that was ridiculous in itself. He couldn’t go the rest of his life without looking at Draco.
“We do have to remember he wasn’t always this deceptively good,” Harry added, “At Hogwarts, he was bigoted and pretentious.”
Malfoy raised his eyebrows, “Now I’m starting to think you do hate Weasley. Should I write a story on that?”
“Oh, okay,” Savant looked away from the notes and yelled in the booming voice Harry had been expecting, “Dover! I know you aren’t asleep! Come to my office!”
Ida looked at him skeptically, “Like what group, Harry? The Ministry hasn’t dealt with groups of Death Eaters in years!”
“Not as good as he was as an Auror,” Servant countered confidently, “His natural instinct to be calm and productive in a moment of threat is all Auror.”
Grinning, Angelina hurried over and enveloped the group in her arms, piercing the room with her laughter as Lily shouted, “Auntie Liiiiiiiiinnnna!”
The words felt cold in his mouth as he stared at Ron for conformation. Ron looked taken aback at Harry’s sudden conscious demands. Harry was about to ask again when Ron enveloped him in a hug.
“Of course, of course!” Savant covered, “I don’t believe that! I’m just saying that many people who work in the Ministry once held terrible views and now they don’t.”
Before his restless and anxious thoughts could go any farther, Draco reappeared in the doorway, a large stack of papers and books in hand.
He stared at his friend for a second. This was someone who had stuck by him for almost nine years. She had seen him at his worst and at his best. She knew him better than almost anyone. He had an unexplainable urge that caused him to move through the doorway and announce without warning, “I’m not straight.”
Harry groaned inwardly. He had been hoping to be assigned to the Second Floor for the week with the hopes of spending more time under the tutelage of Healer Patrick. The Ground Floor dealt with artifact accidents, which covered injuries of things like broomsticks, wands, cauldrons and any other magical objects. Most of the time, the injuries sustained by Ground Floor patients were not magical in nature, including things like broken bones to head trauma. Harry liked the second and third floor better because the patients were recovering from injuries that would only be dealt with in the magical world. Seb’s dragon pox was a prime example.
As Harry lowered himself into the empty chair beside Dean and said hello to the other Healers at the table, he looked over at Dean and noticed the exhaustion in his eyes and face. Despite his cheery attitude, Harry could easily see Dean was beyond tired and stressed. But Dean had never been one to complain. He adored his job and always told Harry he “considered himself beyond lucky to have such a miraculous family and job.” Harry admired Dean’s complete satisfaction in his life and wished he could say the same with the level of confidence Dean had.
“Oh, you all,” she shook her head, refusing to let herself cry, “Gan, Hector will be fine. I know it.”
“He had probably helped with the attacks, that’s why he was so friendly,” Ron countered, “We do have actual proof he had a hatred for muggle-borns.”
Harry had never looked at the mark in the past couple months in which they had been friends. Draco wasn’t that man now; it wasn’t fair to search for the old parts of a boy long-forgotten. By now Draco was looking at it, his eyes dead set. Suddenly, he looked up at Harry, eyes slightly and unexpectedly red.
“Oh yeah!” Al said angrily, “Brickston couldn’t find the snitch if it was the size of a blimp and had sirens attached to it!”
Harry watched, mouth hanging open, as he tried to unpack all of this information. Draco Malfoy was using a muggle phone and his son, a virtual smaller version of Malfoy, was jealous. Not to mention Malfoy was writing for muggle newspapers as well as the Prophet. Trying to come up with any solution to what was going on, Harry smiled at Scorpius, “That’s too bad, I find them quite useful too,” Harry continued, hoping to find out about Malfoy’s elusive wife, “So, your mother. Is she a healer?”
“Exactly,” Harry said, “We didn’t know who was involved or who information could be spread to unwittingly.”
She glared at Harry, “But you. You saved him! That’s when I knew… I had to take down both of you. I tried to prevent it, Harry. I really did. Despite all the lies, I counted you as a true friend. But I should have known I couldn’t trust you. The bloody Chosen One. You’ll have to die, just like the man you love. But don’t worry. I’ll kill him first, just to give you some time to reflect.”
“Seamus!” Harry responded, “It’s not like that! Ginny and I decided to get a divorce a couple weeks ago. And, not that it matters, but she cheated on me.”
“How could she?!” Ron shouted, “She was my colleague! I’ve trusted her with so much! And she repays me by putting my wife in danger? I can’t…” he stopped and angrily kicked another chair.
“Mate, that’s fantastic,” Ron said, standing up and going to sit at Harry’s side, “And I mean that.”
Feeling slighted at her accusatory tone, Harry answered definitely, “I guess I’ve made a good impression. Patrick is the head of the second floor, so I am happy to take the opportunity.”
Ida pursed her lips and looked away, “Ron agrees with me, you know. He feels you are crazy to think you have an actual friendship with him.”
“Hesser couldn’t score a goal if someone put him a foot in front of it and put the keeper on the other side of the field!” Rose yelled. Hesser was one of the Cannon’s chasers.
“I know what I said,” Aviary snapped, “But there was no possible way for me to tell you! Not with Ida in the office!”
Harry bristled slightly at this. He happened to believe he had a fucking great reason. But with that said, he really did feel sorry.
Harry looked up at the sign of the small cafe. It read “Smith and Walton’s Cafe’ in cursive next giant wooden cinnamon roll, which the sign in the window below the sign said was the cafe’s specialty. He silently thanked Malfoy for his selection of the meeting place. They had been meeting in various muggle locations to avoid being overheard by other witches and wizards. Last time they had gone to a bar in Watford that had been loud, smelly and generally impossible to concentrate in. Malfoy had agreed, and had clearly gone with the opposite approach in choosing this small and wonderfully smelling cafe. Not to mention the fact Harry was starving and was already planning on ordering multiple cinnamon rolls along with some type of tea. Harry walked towards the small wooden door of the cafe and pushed it open.
Malfoy grimaced slightly at this and Harry immediately felt a twinge of regret. Realistically, if Molly and Narcissa Malfoy got together, they would talk about anything but something as colloquial as their love for a famous witch.
“That’s great, Harry,” Ginny said as she shoved half a piece of toast into her mouth and reached over to pull Lily away from Al, as she had been about to swat him with her own piece of toast.
“At least I know now I’m on my own if I’m ever in real trouble,” Malfoy gave a soft smirk as he watched his friend leave. He then looked at Harry, the amused expression growing, “Is this drunk Potter or useful information Potter because I’m not quite sure how I should be taking your sudden reappearance.”
“Harry, dear, food is almost ready!” Molly said over the sound of the loud argument between Ron and Ginny, “Ron, Ginny, you are adults!” she snapped. Turning back to Harry, she smiled, “Would you mind setting the table?”
He tried now to scream to no avail. His voice, like his body, was out of his control. His mind began racing with the possibilities of what could be happening to the Aurors fighting at the Ministry. If he was left like this, abandoned on an unidentified floor unable to move, he didn’t want to know the fate of anyone else who had been fighting.
But before Harry could say anything, Malfoy glanced over his shoulder and dropped his grin moments later. Taking his hand off of Harry’s arm, he gave a brisk “thanks” and stood up to leave. Harry came to his senses enough to grab Malfoy’s elbow and question, “Where are you going? I need some kind of an explanation for whatever the ruddy hell that was.”
“Draco?” Ginny finished, “You seemed really off after James brought up Draco. That could have just been because your own son was accusing you of cheating on your wife and because your best friend pushed you to the ground, but I got this feeling,” she turned to look directly at Harry, “Did you two start something?”
Where the lift had once been was a thick cloud of grey smoke. It began to fill the room, darkening Harry’s vision and making it hard for him to see what was going on. He struggled to move forward, but soon he could hardly see two feet ahead of him. Panic seized him as he thought of what could be happening to those around him as shrieks filled the air. Harry was about to fall to the floor in an attempt to protect himself and get to the lift when Draco shouted from nearby:
“And what, did she dare you to smile at me oddly and then leave? If so, I have to say it was a pretty subpar dare,” Harry commented, looking over at Malfoy.
“Good morning!” James said brightly, walking over to Harry and sitting on the edge of the bed near his feet.
“She’ll find a way, Av,” Harry reassured, “Padma won’t let her fear of human contact stop her from taking down someone who wronged her.”
“Right here!” an out of breath Dean made his way towards Harry, “She saw you and Draco and took off.”
“Great, Scorpius,” Harry didn’t see either of Scorpius’s parents anywhere, “Is your mum or dad here?”
As Ron threw himself around her, she melted into his embrace. Both of them began to cry, but Ron’s wails had no hint of relief. Harry was frozen in the doorway. He could never imagine being in their situation. He knew Ron and Hermione had talked about having another kid. Whether or not that was true, it was nothing short of a tragedy that they would never even have the chance to make that a reality.
“First of all,” Draco held out his wand. Harry watched as he began pointing it around the room, getting rid of the grime that covered every surface until the room shone.
“Have you really been to all these places?” Harry turned around to get a full look, “This room is amazing.”
“Yes. He wouldn’t leave until he knew you were alright,” James added, “Just do us a favor and wait until we are out of the room to snog him, alright?”
“Harry, I just care about you! So does Ron! We were partners for almost nine years. I’m not going to let you put yourself into danger.”
She looked at Dean and Seamus hugging and crying and then Harry and Draco holding hands while Draco cried and turned back to go into the house.
“Blaise?!” Seamus’s eyes grew impossibly large, “No fucking way! My boss, Blaise fucking Zabini!? Since when?!”
“No,” he muttered, kicking at the coffee table with his foot in frustration, “But we can still trust her!”
“You as well,” Harry said, shaking her hand, “Your son was telling me you work in the hospital as a magical creatures expert. That must be an exciting job!”
“Ron…” Harry said softly, “There were about a hundred things happening in the canteen at once. You were paying attention, and you were doing your job. Do not blame yourself.”
Draco sneered, “Yeah, right. I’m going to fuck around with the most famous wizard of our time behind his wife’s back as he figures out his sexuality only to decide he’s straight and move on. Brilliant idea, Potter.”
Harry saw a ghost of a smile appear on Malfoy’s face before he looked back determinedly at the menu and said, “So, pot pie or no?”
Draco paused, letting the name ring in the small room, “Harry, this poison has effects I had never heard of. It wasn’t intended to kill the victim. In fact, with proper spells, all of their victims were typically good as new after the ingestion. No, the poison was meant to do much more than punish just the one person. This community believed that if someone committed an offense, it was likely their offspring would cause the same problems. See, they believed criminal acts were hereditary.”
Rachel stammered a goodbye and made her way back to the lift, determinately not looking at Harry. He signed, knowing Rachel meant well but becoming agitated at the thought of how many of these conversations he would have to have overtime. But Harry knew what he was getting himself into when he resigned from his job as an Auror to enter into St. Mungo’s healing program. The idea even seemed crazy to him still, although he already felt more alive in healer’s training than he had ever felt as an Auror. It had taken him a while to realize that there were other ways to satisfy what Ron and Hermione referred to as his “hero complex” without having to constantly relive an entire childhood full of Dark Arts every day. With that in mind, he determinedly set off to Head Auror Savant’s office, where the man in question would discuss options for his replacement.
Draco walked through the door. Harry’s heart jumped into his throat. Was he going to be this taken aback every fucking time Draco walked in the room? Although he still looked as though he hadn’t slept in days (most likely because he hadn’t), he looked stunning with his hair freshly combed back and with a soft blue jumper and black jeans.
Harry held up his hand to silence both of them, “Aviary,” he began, “We know the poison, but it is irrelevant right now. We can talk about it more after I catch Draco up. Draco,” he turned to Draco, looking in the piercing grey eyes, “I have a lot to explain.”
She nodded, “Harry, he’s innocent. He volunteered to take truth serum and everything. Blaise wasn’t involved with any of the attacks and he worked diligently to try to prevent the one at the quidditch match.”
“Potter, Reyes!” Savant cried. He was a large man with a personality to match. Well over six feet with an imposing figure, he was a forceful man to have as the head Auror. Harry knew better than to be intimidated, however; if you were on Brutus Savant’s good side, he wouldn’t raise a finger towards you. Unless, of course, he was offering you one of his signature bear hugs.
“What is it, Harry?” she asked, her eyes wide with concern, “You can tell me anything. I will always be your person to tell big and confusing things to,” she gave a half smile at this and waited for Harry to respond.
“Hopefully the Prophet will let me trash Reyes,” Draco said tartly, “The last time I had an article about him they refused to publish it because he donates so much to the Games and Sports Department.”
Harry opened the door wide to let him in. A moment later, something happened that Harry couldn’t have predicted in a million years; Ron moved swiftly across the room and threw his arms around Draco.
“So I’m Malfoy now?” Draco snapped, “What the fuck is the matter with you? You are the one who wanted to be part of this! So I thought, naturally, that you’d want to help me tonight with an important stakeout,” he said this last part in an angry whisper, as people around them were trying to listen in on the argument, “But I can see you have plenty more important things to do, far more important than my lousy job, so I won’t stand in your way.”
Harry moved to reach for Aviary to apparate when he felt his cell phone vibrate in his pocket. He jolted with surprise; there is only one person who would be calling him at this time of day.
“Harry, we are so relieved it was only a stunning spell,” Aviary addressed him first. Although the two didn’t know each other well, Harry could tell she had been as worried as the rest of them by the clear relief in her face, “It’s a miracle, frankly. The attackers were aiming to kill.”
“Zabini’s great!” Seamus said enthusiastically, “He’s a fantastic department head! And he really is nothing like what he seemed at Hogwarts. He’s funny, hardworking and well, bloody brilliant.” Seamus paused, then looked around the room to make sure he had everyone’s attention. Dean rolled his eyes and said with exasperation,
Harry was, for about the hundredth time that night, shocked at Malfoy’s change in attitude. Before he knew what was happening, Malfoy had began to speak again,
Harry was awoken some time later with a sharp stinging in his side. He sprang off the couch and looked around blurrily for his wand.
“Thanks, Padma,” he reached for her arm again. Making sure she was okay was more important at the moment than getting to Draco, “How are you doing?”
“I still don’t want to place any bets,” Seamus glanced wearily over at Angelina, who was now talking with Bill and Lavender, “But I do think the Cannons will win. Don’t tell Angie. Blaise thinks so too,” he added as an afterthought, as if that confirmed the merit of his statement.
“Well, first of all, I never made a move!” Harry exclaimed angrily, “And second of all, my feelings are for a bloke!”
Ida sighed, “Harry, clearly I’m trying to set you up. I’m not good with relationship advice or advice in general, but Simon is a good bloke who you might be perfect for. Although, if you’re still into Seb or Steven or whatever his name was, you can tell me.”
“This seems like a very roundabout way to tell me something,” Harry said softly, a grin forming curling up the edge of his mouth.
“You’re right Ron,” Hermione said softly, “I do see stuff like this. Wizards and witches being killed for what they are, not who they are. And I’m not going to lie, that’s terrifying for me. As a muggleborn, it’s always going to be scary to think there are people out there who hate me just for being who I am. Yesterday, I almost lost my mind thinking about what would happen to my family if something like this happened again. I did already lose my ability to reproduce,” she placed her hand on her stomach. Her voice shaking, she continued, “But we can’t live our lives in fear. We didn’t back then, and we can’t now. Yes, my career can be scary, having to face all the issues in the world on a daily basis. But it’s also shown me the inherent goodness that is still present. I spent all day yesterday answering owls from concerned ministers, asking what they could do to help and make sure nothing like this happens anywhere ever again. There are many great wizards and witches out there that have been entrusted to help run the wizarding society, and they want nothing more than to see societies like Kareach wiped clean from history. There is hope. I see that everyday. That has to be enough for us to move forward.”
“I don’t know how she did it,” Ron said, clearly in awe, “Before I knew what was happening, Padma came out of the lift with basically all of our friends and family. Everyone was willing to fight.”
“You have no right to know anything right now,” Ginny snapped, “Not after your little outburst. Harry and I are no longer together romantically, it is our choice as to who we begin a relationship with.”
“I’ll talk to all of them straight away,” he assured, “And I promise you, Ginny, I won’t sneak off to any more pubs without you knowing.”
“Aviary,” Harry said softly, sitting down beside her, “We can’t promise that no one else will die from these attacks. But we can promise to put our everything into this. This is so much bigger than all of us. Draco and I…” he looked up at Draco as he spoke, “Both of us are terrified of this type of risk. I mean, we have kids, friends and families to go back to. But so do all the victims who have passed or had their reproduction stunted. They deserve to have as much support as possible.”
“Mr. Haffer,” Patrick spoke as she gestured to a large bottle behind her that Harry recognized as Gunhilda de Gorsemoor’s cure, the treatment for Dragon Pox, “I am highly certain you are the happiest patient I have ever seen with Dragon Pox in all my years at St. Mungos.”
Sure enough, it was Draco. Why he was calling Harry was beyond him, but he assumed it must be urgent if he wanted to willingly talk to Harry.
Harry could feel his level of anger quickly rising. However, he was at work, and he couldn’t start a fight with one of his patients. He knew Aries knew that and would be trying to provoke him to get Harry into trouble. So Harry began to take Aries temperature and check his heart rate without another word while Aries sat with a smirk on his face. At least Aries wasn’t his cousin. He felt a pang of sympathy for Ida.
“Oh, we plan to,” a voice said from behind him. Harry glanced back to see Draco, who must have just finished evacuating a group of Ministry officials.
“Harry, how are you?” Luna inquired, leaning towards Harry. He watched as her large earrings, shaped as hummingbirds, dangled wildly around her head.
“As good as I can be, I suppose,” Padma looked at Harry, a determination behind her sadness, “I have a job to do, justice to bring upon my cousin. He would want me to keep working strong.”
“Right there!” he pointed, “Four attacks are practically forming a circle around him! Ida,” his continued, his voice urgent, “Did you see Blaise during the attacks? Did anyone? Was he helping, or seen fleeing?”
Too soon, Draco pulled away, a small moan escaping from him that sent waves of desire through Harry’s body once again. Lust consumed Draco’s eyes and made them dark with desire. Harry placed a hand on the side of Draco’s face and went to move in once again when Draco jumped up from his spot on the beam, dropping Harry’s arm to his side.
Hermione nodded at this; she couldn’t refute the fact the Spanish minister, that had once accused the Department of International Magical Cooperation of being a whole department of “pelagatos” (which essentially is a fun way to say the department was useless and got nothing done) now sent weekly updates to Hermione on both the Spanish Ministry and his own family (Hermione even helped pick out baby names for his daughter). Hermione was a force of nature and Harry had no doubts in his mind that she would have foreign assistance and cooperation for the attacks within days.
“Your kid is named ‘Scorpius’! So don’t be going all high and mighty on me. You probably just looked at an astronomical chart and picked the first name that you saw!” Harry retorted.
Harry pulled a face that transformed into a smile seconds later as Ida retreated to the kitchen to get glasses, one hand still maneuvering through her hair. This is exactly what Harry needed; the easy banter that came with a good friend. A good friend who didn’t ask many questions and didn’t expect many answers. She might not even bring up Harry’s whole coming out after a near death situation that occurred two weeks prior. He certainly wouldn’t mind. Harry needed a night where he didn’t have to think about his future or his messy and uncontrollable feelings.
Ginny nodded. He could see her anger leaving, “You do, don’t you? I trust you enough to believe that.”
“And I called you my brother!” Ron accused. Harry wondered how much of his angry look at Bill was actually for show. Ron legitimately had a passion for Cannons that extended beyond brotherly love.
“She said I had potential,” Caser said proudly, “And that she was willing to give me the experience, as I always knew I wanted to be a Healer.”
Harry snorted, thinking of how much of an understatement that was. As a matter of fact, he had felt particularly out of it since the interview yesterday, but he didn’t really want to unpack any of that. He had spent so much of his childhood trying to understand Draco Malfoy, the last thing he needed to let himself dwell on was the complicated man he had encountered again yesterday.
Harry plastered a smile and said, “Everything looks fine, Mr. Reyes. I hope to see you at the quidditch match after party. I’m sure Ginny will appreciate you coming to congratulate her after the Cannon’s win. The press eats that stuff up.”
“Sorry!” Seb called, “I forgot to tell you my guest room was designed by a person with either no taste or no eyes!”
“I gave my children names to honor people I’ve lost! Surely that trumps my lack of originality,” Harry said indignantly.
“And you and Ginny aren’t on the best of terms?” Ida asked, concern written suddenly in her face. She turned abruptly as a chip thrown by the five-shots-of-vodka-man hit her on the back of the head.
Harry held back a laugh as next to him, Neville gave a soft snort. Healer Brayan was about the least likely person to be part of a secret anything.
As the conversation went on, Harry realized how fun his current assignment was. Seb was funny, smart and selfless, making Harry immediately like him. ‘If only everyone was this easy to talk to’ he thought as he and Seb dove into what was sure to be a lengthy topic of who would win the upcoming tournament, Puddlemere United or the Cannons.
Harry felt the cold of his dread be replaced by a warm feeling of comfort. Draco was fine. Harry had been willing to risk his life to ensure that. Harry remembered the events of the attack as if through a bad dream. He had seen the spell being fired at Draco and he had acted without thinking. He cared about Draco in a way he had suspected for a long time. There had been so many signs throughout the years… he had pushed back any sense of attraction to males for so long that he didn’t know how to deal with it now. But now he felt exposed, open; he liked Draco. He was falling for Draco. He was the most confusing and complicated man Harry had ever met, but he loved that. Harry loved his passion, his bravery, his graciousness, even his stubbornness. Harry liked blokes. Well, he liked one bloke. One that happened to be Draco fucking Malfoy.
Harry looked sheepishly down at the floor, mind racing as he tried to think of what to say. He couldn’t tell her about Malfoy, about the investigation. In fact, while he abhorred lying straight to her face, he didn’t fancy the idea of her knowing about the investigation at all. It was more than she thinking it was dangerous; Harry knew the investigation belonged to him and Malfoy and their weird new friendship.
“Yep,” Aviary said, almost cheerily, “The kids are at Ron’s parents’ house for the rest of the night. And Draco sent Blaise and Pansy over to your house to stay with Ginny. Not that she can’t handle herself, but it’s better to have numbers if things get ugly.”
“Well, I just thought maybe your interview yesterday went poorly,” Molly said, “You and Mr. Malfoy have a...well… complicated history.”
Tears welled up in Harry’s eyes as he looked back at his friend, “Thank you, Seamus. I can’t begin to tell you how much that means to me.”
“”Yes, Potter. I fall into the far “gay” side of the spectrum, unlike my friend Pansy who will shag anything with a pulse,” Malfoy said nonchalantly.
Draco at the moment; what he needed to focus on was his friends. When Draco finished speaking, Dean was sobbing into Seamus’s shoulder while Seamus held onto his husband like a lifeline.
“I wasn’t drunk, you were,” Harry muttered. He regained his nerve and looked Malfoy in the eye, “I meant to say I have direct access to St. Mungos, where every single patient from the Imperius attacks goes. I also have resources you could never get to without my help. So,” he hesitated, trying to read Malfoy’s intentionally blank face, “I could help you. With your investigation.”
Dean nodded and made his way with Seamus back into the house. Harry watched them go silently, then turned to Draco, who had his head in his hands.
“There’s nothing more to talk about,” Ron said angrily, grabbing onto Rose’s hand, “I don’t want to talk to either of you for awhile.”
“I need to tell you something,” Harry stated, looking directly into Malfoy’s eyes and hating himself for how much he liked how blue they were. Maybe he wasn’t really over his recent selection of Mafloy out of the room full of blokes as the one who would provide the best shag.
“Agreed,” James said, lowering Lily to his feet. She immediately took off in a mad dash towards the door.
“It’s obvious, Harry,” she whispered back, “And he likes you too. He would deny it, but he spent the entirety of the time you were in the fire staring at your arse.”
Harry nodded and turned to look into the flames. The three of them had spent the past twenty minutes speedily coming up with a plan to figure out Kareach’s next action. It began with Harry calling Brayan’s office.
“Well, as much as I would love to hear you two talk about magical creatures for the next couple hours,” Malfoy said, turning to his wife and child, “I need to start this interview sometime today.”
Remmins shook his head. He was clearly trying to fight back tears as he nearly whispered, “I’m not sure my partner is going to make it. His name is Hector Youll. You would have liked him, Harry. He was a great guy.”
Harry looked up to see Molly walk into the living area. Harry realized she must have been watching them for the day, as this was usually Harry’s day off in which he was at home with the kids. Her eyes expanded as she saw Harry hunched over, crying on the floor.
Harry was surprised at the humility in Brayan’s words. Despite how much he had always admired Brayan, the man had never been known for his humbleness.
“I thought you were dead, Harry,” he murmured into Harry’s shoulder, “When Ida told me you were hit by a spell, I thought the worst until she confirmed it was only a stunning spell.”
Ida and Harry watched idly as some man downed five consecutive shots of vodka and let out a loud chant that was echoed by his mates. Harry could see the obvious disgust in Ida’s face.
“James,” Ginny touched his arm gently and looked at him, “You have nothing to be sorry for. You actually took this much better than I thought you would,” she looked at Al and Lily, “You all did. Your father and I are beyond lucky to have children as wonderful as you three.”
Draco sat up beside him, “We need to help!” he said urgently. Harry grabbed the wand from his hand instantly. Draco bristled but Harry put a quick shield between them before he could grab his wand back.
“We’ll stay,” Seamus whispered, looking past Dean to Harry, “It’s Christmas Eve. We don’t want to be alone.”
“Listen,” Draco said rather fiercely, “I work better with you than I do Patil and Granger- Weasley. Let’s be professional and meet at Smith and Walton’s tonight. Say eight o’clock?”
“He’s always been like this,” Ida explained, leaning back in her chair, “He grew up here in England with all the money a boy could want. His mother and father managed to leave the Philippines before Reega’s regime. So while I was growing up poor and afraid of being a witch, he was enjoying himself as a pureblood in England. Even during the second wizarding war, he was never living in fear, with his status. A real punyeta he has turned out to be because of this privilege.”
“I would have been here sooner,” she said frantically, “But no one notified the team. Ron only called minutes ago!”
Ron accepted his hug and cried into his shoulder, “Harry, he was like a son to me. I know that sounds a bit ridiculous, but the last couple years he’s looked up to me. He admired me! The kid even told me that, point blank. No one’s ever admired me like that. He was an extraordinary person.”
The next two weeks passed in a blur of unwanted conversations and desperate attempts to find normalcy before the holidays. Draco and Harry had gone to the Ministry together to talk to Ron and Padma. The two immediately recognized that the effects of Chann matched up perfectly with the observed effects of the attacks from the past year. With such a strong lead on what the poison from the attacks could be, Padma and Ron were readily willing to work with Harry and Draco. They understood how dangerous sharing their knowledge of Chann with the Ministry could be and agreed to keep the information between them until they could find out more about the potential culprits. Padma and Ron still refused to agree with the fact this was the work of Kareach, but that hardly mattered anymore. What mattered was they all searched for any signs of Chann being brought into the country. Which was substantially more difficult than it sounded (and it already sounded extremely difficult) because hardly anyone in England had ever even heard of the poison, let alone had heard of it being brought into the country. Draco believed that there had already been a stash in the country for many years, potentially brought in by someone the Ministry couldn't patrol. This left their investigation wide open and with too many loose ends to make much progress. Despite all these negatives, Harry found it was easier to be around Draco if they were all constantly in investigating mode. There wasn’t time to contemplate his complex and pesky feelings when he had a reproductive destroying poison to worry about.
Ginny let out a small cry and launched herself into her brother’s arms, shaking as she hugged him fiercely. Harry couldn’t help it; he began to cry himself.
“Exactly!” Ida turned to Harry, anger flashing in her eyes, “He lied. He has been lying for years! After some digging last night, I found out the real identity of his father. Brayan had told everyone that his real father was a muggle named Horacio, a man that was his stepfather for years before he died a couple years ago of an unidentified reason. Hours of digging lead me to his actual father, a man named Gert Foget. Harry,” she said, her voice taking on a tone of enthusiasm he recognized from whenever she solved a case, “Foget was a death eater. He died serving Voldemort. The inscription on his grave is, get this ‘Death for the right cause is the only pure way to die’,” she then reached for a small newspaper article, “Look at this! It says right here that ‘Foget’s son, Darius Foget, choose his dad’s inscription’. This was during the second wizarding war. Brayan would have been in his late twenties at the time!”
Malfoy looked alarmed at his sudden tone of urgency, as they had been standing in silence, “What is it, Potter?”
“No! My family deserves the truth! I can’t lie and sneak off with you all the time!” Harry was unsure why he was becoming so mad, but he felt out of control and extremely on edge.
“This morning, Healer Darius Brayan confessed to the Imperius attacks,” Ida cut straight to the point.
Ron shook his head, his face falling, “Don’t smile at me like that. I don’t deserve it. I wasn’t supportive when you and Ginny first told me. I wasn’t there when both of you needed me most. I’m not upset that you and Ginny aren’t together. I mean, I am, but I’m more happy that you two are happy. Ginny seems to really like Blaise. And you seem to really like Draco. That’s what matters. I support you in whatever makes you happy, mate.”
“Well, it seems like you and Draco are the best of mates,” Ron said loudly, “If you’re on a bloody first name basis!”
“Yes, and speaking of people who are alight, where is Dean?” Ginny said from Harry’s side. She placed a hand on Harry’s arm.
Then suddenly, she began to cry in a way Harry hadn’t seen in years. She was shaking uncontrollably as Harry reached for and gave her a hug, He assumed she was just as worried about telling their children as he was. He couldn’t believe she was telling him all the things he had been thinking for the past couple months. Somehow, the person who understood his need to get out of his marriage most was his wife.
“There was a letter left at one of the places we’ve visited frequently where we think Kareach activity is possible, the one near Yorkshire, you know?” Harry nodded and Draco continued, “It had been burned, but I was still able to use magic to piece together what it had said. It clearly mentioned the next ‘meeting’ was at a Russian pub on the outskirts of town. I jumped at the chance of it being real evidence, which was foolish.”
The inside of the cafe felt like walking into the Burrow. It was chaotic, filled with countless signs and framed posters of everything from the Beatles to famous British football teams. From one look around, Harry spotted a watering can suspended from the ceiling painted in red, blue and white, a wall covered with framed records, a bright red couch that seemed to have signatures covering every available spot and a light fixture shaped as England itself. Harry, who could have looked at the walls of this cafe all day without finding everything they had to offer, told himself to try and find Malfoy. It wasn’t hard; the cafe was so small that he easily recognized Malfoy’s bright blond hair at a table at the back of the cafe, directly next to a giant poster of David Beckham.
Ginny sat down on the bed. Then, without warning, she burst into tears. When Ginny cries, like really cries,  it isn’t a small scene. She wails and gasps for air as if the world is crumbling around her. Harry bent down to comfort her.
There was no doubt in Harry’s mind this kite would put any other kite in the tri-state area to shame. Harry took the kids to a park that was within walking distance of his house. The park usually consisted of primarily muggles, as Harry and Ginny didn’t live in a wizarding community, but a neighborhood with muggles and wizarding families alike. For example, Terry Boot and his family lived only two kilometers away. However, most of the families were muggles, which meant Harry’s kids had grown up with muggle traditions alongside wizarding ones. Lately, his kids, especially Al, had taken a liking to kite flying. It was only a matter of time before Rose and Al constructed the biggest and greatest kite they could create. Their style was to always go above and beyond on anything that involved creativity.
“It’s already much better than training!” Aviary bubbled, smiling over at Ida, “I mean, I’ve only been working with Ida for one day and I already feel like I’m part of the team.”
“No,” Malfoy said, slightly confused, “I thought you knew I got a divorce? Wasn’t it obvious before the interview?”
Brayan beamed, “I wish I could stay and talk, but I have my own friend to get back to,” Harry watched as he waved at a woman a couple rows behind them.
Her hair was now half in braids and half hanging around her face. As she moved to weave her fingers through another strand, Harry spoke, “Who else would it be? And if you say Aviary, I understand but I will be severely disappointed.”
Harry rolled his eyes, “We are. But still, you thought instead of asking about that, it was a great idea to attempt to set me up with someone else?”
“Well, I can guarantee Hermione is just as grateful for you. She’s been passionate about the rights of all magical non-humans, especially house elves, ever since I’ve known her,” Harry said.
The alarm began to blare a Celestina Warbeck song (Ginny says her hatred of the artist motivates her to get out of bed and shut the bloody thing off. They had a muggle alarm clock that Ginny spelled so that it only can be shut off by hand, not magic. It’s the only way she can get up). Ginny’s head shot up a second later, as she is anything but a heavy sleeper. She sprang out of bed, red hair flying wildly behind her, and slammed her fist down on the clock.
“Of course,” Harry assured, turning back to the football game as a screaming Angelina scored a goal. He tried to replace the nagging feeling that he should just talk to Molly with the observation of the rather insane football game that had now reached a new level of competitiveness as Dom told her father to “guard the goal, not just stand like a tree in the center of it!” Leaning back into his chair, Harry let himself laugh and forget about anything that could possibly ruin this lovely afternoon.
When neither of her parents answered, Rose narrowed her eyes, “I’m not a baby. You can trust me with whatever you’re worried about.”
With that, he apparated into the air, leaving Harry alone and somehow upset with both himself and Malfoy at the same time.
The room stiffened immediately at the mention of the attacks. Harry could see Ida look down at her lap, no doubt feeling the same sense of shame he felt at letting the attack at the hospital harm so many innocent people. Molly stood up and began to make her way towards Seamus when he held up his hand.
Draco hit the table hard with his fist, “It’s positively evil. And it all makes sense. Instead of simply killing muggles and muggleborns, Kareach is stopping bloodlines in their tracks. It’s also spreading farther and quicker than it would if they were simply slaughtering hoards of muggles and muggleborns.”
“There’s no way that’s true!” Harry laughed, slamming his beer down in front of him, “It’s just too perfect, I refuse to believe it.”
“Harry, if I am being honest, I don’t want you and Ginny to break up. I love both of you and the relationship our families have. But more than that, I want you and Ginny to be happy. And if you aren’t happy, that will never be okay. I know that you can find a truer, more pure life, where you and Ginny are in each other's lives and mine and Ron’s lives without being together. If that’s what you need. Because it would never be fair to any one, not even your kids, if you stayed in a marriage where real love was absent.”
He fought back tears as he looked wildly around the living room. He needed to talk to Ginny. Now. He was done with lying. Having Draco basically tell him that they would never be together had made more upset than he would like to admit. But as he stood in the home that no longer felt like his and yelled for his wife that he no longer wanted to call his own, he felt stupid. Stupid that he had placed his infatuation with Draco and his coming out together. He had, without meaning to, dedicated this discovery about his identity to Draco. That was wrong. Yes, Draco had made him realize he wasn’t straight. But he was a bloody fool to think that just because he liked Draco things would work out. And Harry did think that. As much as he had doubted the fact Draco would ever like him, a part of him had simultaneously imagined them ending up together. Raising their children together. Buying a house together.
“What do you think he was doing?” Harry asked, slightly upset that Malfoy did not ask him to help when he was right outside of the place Harry worked.
Despite the fact that Harry and Ginny decided to get a divorce the night before, Christmas was actually a lovely affair. The two had decided not to tell anyone until after the quidditch tournament the following week, giving time to let their kids enjoy the holidays and tournament without thinking about the end of their parents’ marriage. They spent Christmas day, as usual, at the Burrow with the entire family. Harry could never have envisioned the talk going the way it had. For weeks he had been dreading talking to Ginny, only to have her say the exact same thing he had been thinking to him first. He felt liberated. But as much as he wanted to pretend it was only because he was relieved he hadn’t broken Ginny’s heart (as it hadn’t been his to break for awhile), a part of him knew his cheerfulness stemmed largely from the discovery that Draco and Blaise weren’t a couple. Dwelling on this, however, made him feel a bit crazy. Just because Draco wasn’t with Blaise didn’t mean anything; he could still be with someone else. Or he could just not like Harry, which was infinitely worse for Harry to consider. Opting to ignore these feelings, he focused on Christmas and Boxing day, followed closely by “Ida and Harry” day. Otherwise known as the twenty seventh of December, this was the day Ida and Harry had set aside every year, as per tradition, to talk and relax while still on holiday. As he hadn’t talked to Ida much since he had come out to her after the hospital attack, he felt it was long overdue for them to have a long and good conversation.
“That’s fucking fantastic,” Harry shot, “I’m glad you are both judging my life decisions behind my back.”
Harry turned away, feeling ashamed, when Malfoy responded, “Potter, that might be just what I need,” he voice was soft and unsure, but there nonetheless, “But I can’t have you help me. I can’t put anyone else’s life at risk. You have a family, kids. It’s too much for me to ask of you.”
“I’m always sure,” Harry said simply, starting as he realized Lily had fallen and scraped her knee on a sidewalk. As Harry rushed to her and used magic to carefully repair her wound, he realized that he meant it.
At some point, Padma would be a good person to entrust with the information of Kareach. Once they had solid proof, of course. He knew her; she would never stop fighting until she avenged her cousin’s death. That might make her more open to exploring the possibility of Kareach.
“It means you need to learn to put yourself first,” Ida answered simply, “Wow, I really cannot stand talking about this,” she muttered this last part under her breath.
“It wasn’t a good fit and I wasn’t happy,” he said bluntly. As a matter of fact, he still wasn’t, but at least his job was no longer the culprit.
Ron didn’t answer. The lift had reached the third floor and he was out as soon as the doors opened. A healer was walking quickly down the hall right outside of the lift doors. Ron stopped him.
Aviary collapsed on the floor as the words left her. She buried her head in her hands as sobs rolled through her body.
“Albus Severus Potter!” Harry yelled from the bottom of the stairs, “If you and Rose don’t get down here now, you’re not going!”
“Ginny,” he whispered, “Thank you for saying that. I’ve been meaning to say the same thing, but I didn’t know how.”
Ron nodded, “Then it’s just a matter of figuring out what the hell happened today. As of right now, we are going to hold Brayan in custody until we figure everything out.”
Sure enough, after a long painful couple minutes, in which Seb screamed almost continuously in agony as he finished his cure, Harry was re-introduced to the normal Seb as he laid back against his pillow and let his smile break out across his face.
“With who?” Seamus exclaimed, “I’m really trying to be a good person to talk to here, but I feel like I’m missing a few crucial components to this story!”
“Harry!” Molly cut in, looking relieved to have a reason to stop Fleur’s tangent. Molly and Fleur got along well, much better than they did when Fleur was first engaged to Bill, but Harry knew Fleur’s ability to talk without end could get to Molly.
“Wait…” James looked at his mom accusingly, “Are you cheating on dad too? Is that why you use the floo to talk all of the time now?”
Suddenly, as if they remembered the day that had brought them to Harry’s living room floor, the two stopped laughing abruptly.
“I’d like two more glasses of your Superior Red,” Harry said, pulling a galleon out of his pocket and placing it on the counter in front of him.
Harry walked into his empty house and collapsed down on the living room couch. Healer Patrick had asked to work with him once again this week. This was, of course, an amazing thing that Harry was thrilled about. But it also meant Harry had spent the day trailing the fast-paced healer, barely stopping to breath before Patrick whisked him off to her next patient. Harry knew he would never work quite like her when he became a full-fledged healer. Yes, he would be quick and hopefully good at problem solving, but he would take more time with each of his patients. He couldn’t form bonds like Healer Patrick did: effortlessly and at a breakneck speed. But, Harry chided himself, there would be little opportunity for him to be a healer if the world was taken over by Kareach. With that gloomy image in mind, Harry rose and made his way over to his fireplace, nerves unexpectedly claiming his stomach.
“Ron,” Padma snapped, “That’s circumstantial evidence. You know we have no proof he was involved. People can change, you know. Just take Nott.”
Despite how upset Harry was, he couldn’t help feel a surge of pride for Draco. They had been on to Kareach in more ways that Ida was aware.
“You don’t know that!” Remmins moved out of Harry’s embrace to shout at Aviary, “Av, you just don’t! I know you want to make me feel better, but you can’t. My partner and friend could die, and that’s something I have to deal with”
“It sounds as if a service for her is being held this Friday,” Darius said, “I hope you will all be there.”
Draco was looking around as well, his wand still gripped tightly in hand. When he noticed Harry, his eyes seemed to darken and he turned away and rushed to help a healer. Harry stared at him until he heard a familiar, and very frantic, voice coming from behind him.
“You’re right,” Harry took a large breath and turned away from his friends to face the fireplace once again, “Ministry of Magic, Brutus Savant’s office!”
Harry strode back into the Burrow through the kitchen door. Ginny, Ron, Hermione, Al, Rose and Fred were all helping put the finishing touches on lunch.
“Weeks?” Draco said, as much of the table broke out in surprised chatter, “And you didn’t think to tell your best friend?”
“None of this matters, anyway,” Angelina responded, “Because Oliver is the one actually making the plays. And, as I am sure George and Harry would corroborate, Oliver is a fantastic captain.”
Draco and Aviary followed Harry down the stairs to the large living room right off of the kitchen. The room, like everywhere else in the house, was covered in a nice coating of dust. Despite the multiple renovations they had done in the house, this room still had peeling walls and floors as well as furniture that hadn’t been considered in style since long before they were born. It was hauntingly like being back in Malfoy manor all those years ago. Harry could tell Draco was majorly uncomfortable with being in this room.
“What?” Harry snapped, “My personal life? Did you read the article that no doubt came out today, telling all of England that I’m getting a divorce and that I’m gay? Thank you, but I don’t need advice from a naive, over enthusiastic child who knows nothing about what’s really going on in my life.”
Harry sighed and sat down in the vacated armchair, “You shouldn’t be comforting me, Aviary. It should be the other way around.”
If this were a couple weeks ago, Padma would have aired her doubts with Harry over a theory without any Auror found evidence to back it. But she didn't even bat an eye as she said, “Okay. What do I do?”
Harry looked up through the flashes of light to see an Auror waving his empty hands at him. Assuming he had lost his own wand, Harry tossed the wand through the air. The Auror reached out to grab it, but was intercepted by another Kareach member, who grabbed it and whipped around to cast a crucio on the Auror.
The room quieted down as they all turned to face Seamus, who was gesturing for Dean to join him. Dean eased himself out of the chair to Seamus’s side, who slung an arm around his husband’s shoulder immediately. Harry envied their easy comfort in each other and wondered when he and Ginny had lost that. Seamus looked briefly at Dean, who gave a small nod. That seemed to be Seamus’s cue, as he turned back to the room and began speaking.
“Well, I ought to be off,” Harry said, nodding at the two of them, “I can’t avoid the interview forever.”
“Murr? That’s adorable!” Harry chuckled, “And the name “Roger” for a corgi puts our pet naming abilities to shame. Our lab’s name is ‘Padfoot’.”
Silence followed Harry’s words. It took all that was left of his nerve to turn and look at Draco, who chose that exact moment to look back at him. Draco’s eyes were wide with an expression Harry didn’t quite recognize, one that made his stomach do cartwheels after one glance. Not knowing what to do, he opted for what he did best in awkward situations: talk.
“I’m not about to be your gay rebound, Potter,” he held the door open, wider, “You and I would never work out. Like I said, I shouldn’t have kissed you. Consider it the mistake it was and move on.”
Aries Reyes was propped up on a bed in the center of the room. He looked nothing like a patient, except for his sling holding up his right arm. His shoulder length black hair was slicked back without a single hair out of place (it reminded Harry absently of Draco’s hair in first year) and he was wearing smart green robes. He was jotting notes on a clipboard with an outline of a quidditch pitch on it. Harry was surprised to see this level of commitment as the man laid on a hospital bed. From all Angelina had said about Reyes, Harry had assumed Oliver made most of the plans while Aries reaped the benefits of technically being the coach of a good quidditch team. Aries seemed focused and determined, something Harry thought impossible.
“And all this time I thought it was a joke!” Harry teased, getting off the bench in order to bend down and greet the ferret. To his delight, Murr nuzzled into his touch.
“Okay,” Harry conceded, “We weren’t on bad terms until yesterday. Like we told you all, we came to the mutual decision to get a divorce. We both love you very much, but we can’t have you live in a house where the two of us aren’t happy anymore.”
“I suspect that Darren’s not overly fond of kite Darren, though,” Albus admitted, “He seemed to be glaring at us while we were making it.”
“Kareach? Harry, we talked about this. The Aurors all agree the attacks have nothing to do with Kareach,” Ida reminded him firmly.
As she raised her eyebrows in anticipation, Harry told her about how he hadn’t been going to the therapy sessions they had talked about months ago.
Harry fell back into her arms, crying so hard he could hardly catch his breath. Molly let him, not wavering until Harry finally pulled away, wiping water from his face.
“Yes, he did,” she whispered, her voice taking on a dangerous tone Harry had only heard her use with criminals, “I have never felt so… violated in my entire life! I trusted her! She was one of my closest friends! I can’t even imagine how Aviary is feeling right now.”
Ginny nodded, “I know that, Harry. Blaise is going to be okay, just so you know. He has his job back and everything. He won’t be head of security, but maybe that’s for the best. It was never his true passion anyway,” she looked up at Harry, “And I’m sorry to. For making a scene at St. Mungos. And, you know, outing you to the world. That wasn’t cool.”
“How are you?” she whispered softly into his ear. Harry hadn’t talked to her since his confession a few weeks before. He had been secretly dreading seeing her again. Harry had put his crush on Draco and his unhappiness in his marriage so far from his mind for the weeks leading up to Christmas that he was starting to think the idea of leaving Ginny was anything but realistic. He had a family; that was something he was beyond lucky to have, what with all the families that would be nonexistent because of Chann. He shouldn’t trade that for Draco.
“No, he’s bi,” Ginny answered quickly. Harry gave her a look that clearly questioned how she knew that, and she continued, “He’s head of Games and Sports. He’s been at many of the Cannons events. You get to know a guy at those things.”
“She’ll think you're grieving,” Harry insisted, “And even if she doesn’t, we will hide you in a place she will never be able to find. Aviary, you are a muggleborn. If Ida,” Harry cringed as her name left his mouth, “Finds out you know, she won’t hesitate to kill you.”
Dean noticed him as Harry made his way over, “Oi, Potter!” he said, gesturing to a seat next to him, “Come sit down!”
Harry stared at Malfoy. So he only wanted someone to talk to? Why hadn’t he said so? Anger began to form a pit in his stomach. He had left Sunday lunch and ticked off his wife for what? A chat session in the park?
Ginny nodded and said nothing. Harry tried to read her face, but it was blank, impenetrable. What was she thinking?
Harry hesitated. He thought about lying and saying nothing happened, but then he felt tears begin to stream for his eyes.
Harry stared at Draco then, trying to read in his pale blue eyes if this was true, “Why?” he asked softly, not knowing what else to say.
Harry sat on a park bench upon arrival, planning to wait next to the fountain until Malfoy showed. He didn’t have to wait long. In less than two minutes Malfoy materialized in front of him. They were unseen by anyone due to the protective charms the two had placed around the fountain weeks ago when they started using the park as a meeting place. It was perfect due to the usual absence of wizards and wide open spaces. Even if a wizard or witch did show at the park, it was easy for them to prevent being overheard.
Despite his best efforts, the tears began to flow more; hard and fast down his face. He crumbled to the floor and pulled his face into his knees. Then he began to cry like he hadn’t allowed himself to in years. The nightmare of the day had begun to flash through his mind. Draco rejecting him after their kiss. Hermione’s piercing scream setting his world on fire. Fleeing the quidditch stadium. Working side-by-side with the man who had just rejected him to save dozens of patients while he internally panicked. Finding out about Hermione’s pregnancy. Draco telling him their kiss was just a mistake. Harry’s life hadn’t been this out of control since his time at Hogwarts. He felt like the fourteen year old who was forced to complete a maze riddled with challenges, watch a seventeen year old be killed and then fight the darkest wizard of all time all in one afternoon.
Harry whipped around. Ginny was fuming with anger, “If you even think about leaving this party, I will curse you until you can’t stand straight! You can’t blow up everytime you become frustrated! Whatever it is that you are still hiding from me that is causing you to lose your mind whenever we have friends over we will talk about later. Right now I need you to go back inside and enjoy Christmas Eve with your friends and family before you freak them out any further. Understand?”
“Okay…” Malfoy sounded concerned, “I thought we could meet today? In the park? I was planning to bring Murr, if that seals the deal. I really need to talk to you.”
“Poke fun all you want,” Draco said, “But if Vella was old enough, you two would have sent her to play tag by now.”
At first he thought it was Ginny, but then he remembered Ginny still had no idea he had shown up back in their house. Harry made his way curiously to the other room, wondering who wanted to talk to him at ten o’clock at night. A part of him hoped it was Draco, coming to talk to him about Brayan. Secretly, Harry had been hoping Draco would contact him about it all day. A part of their investigation was coming to a close, and it stung that neither of them had contacted each other.
“How could you possibly accuse me of that?” Harry raged, “I would never put someone I think to be innocent in this position! Especially at your expense, Draco. I’m in love with you, don’t you know that by now?”
“Mione, he hid his convicted son for years when he was supposed to be in Azkaban!” Harry said, shaking his head in amazement at his friend, “And anyway, because I know that doesn’t change how you feel, I’ve heard he was actually quite bad at French. That is one of the languages you said was easiest to learn. If he’s bad at it, who’s to say how well he could speak many of the other languages Percy claimed he knew?”
Ignoring an urge to run his fingers through said hair, Harry shook his head, “As much as I appreciate that, you needed sleep.”
“Cheers to that, mate,” George said, Accio-ing a beer and raising it up to Dean’s glass, “My daughter is going to be making good choices.”
Harry silently approved Ida of her choice. Sure, Aviary was a lot more outwardly enthusiastic than Ida would ever be, but she was clearly up for the job and not afraid after what was surely a crazy first day of work. Glancing at Ida, he noticed the look of determination on her face. He knew her well enough to know this meant she was excited to work with Aviary as well.
“I know. But… I don’t think I can avoid it. I’ve tried all week to avoid it, to forget about this person. But I can’t. And if I can’t last one week, I can’t last a lifetime.”
When Ron pulled back from Hermione, Harry moved further into the room so that Hermione could see him. She smiled widely when she spotted him. Harry began to make his way towards the bed to embrace her as Ron had, when Ron let out a wail. He stopped and turned to look at his friend and then fell to his knees with his face in his hands. Ron had never been much of a crier, due to years of fearing torment from his older brothers, so this loud and obvious show of emotion cast an immediate tension over the room.
Just as Remmins had been waiting mere hours before, Ron was standing in front of the phone booth. When he saw the three of them approaching, he rushed towards them.
Harry stared at him in confused shock (something he felt he was doing too often lately) and said, “He?”
“You know I love kids,” Dean said, placing an arm around his husband, “But I can’t act like a plastered fool around them. Especially Roxy. At that one Christmas Eve party she took away my wand and said I wasn’t allowed to use it until the morning. She was five at the time!”
Harry and Ginny said their goodbyes to the room full of kids and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley (who was looking as if she was not soon going to forget Arthur’s fib) and hurried out the door towards where George, Angelina, Bill and Fleur were standing.
“Lily, you can’t play if you don’t know the rules!” James insisted, “Fred, Roxy and Al understand the game. You’re also too small to stretch across the mat.”
“She’s miserable, but she is one of the strongest people I have ever met, so she is holding it together enough to help out in any way she can,” Harry told her.
“I read in training about how stupefy can wear off quickly on people if they grow accustomed to it overtime! That’s something I wouldn’t be surprised if Aries was trained to do from a young age!” Harry exclaimed.
Harry huffed, “For your information, Draco has done more for wizarding society than anyone has in a long time!”
Harry didn’t even try to conceal his shock. He turned to Scorpius and asked, “Your dad has a phone? A muggle phone?”
“Fine,” Ron sounded exasperated as he sat sulkily into his chair. Harry had a feeling he wouldn’t be cheering for Puddlemere anytime soon. Harry almost laughed at his friend when he remembered his anger with him and stifled it.
By the way he asked, Harry knew Ron already guessed how. Harry felt his face heat up slightly as he ran his hand over the back of his neck.
Malfoy looked as if he was trying to hold back a laugh. Harry couldn’t help but respect him in the moment.
“It’s the perfect poison,” Harry said, appalled, “Are you sure it’s the one they are using? It logically makes sense, especially because so few people have died from the poison, but how do you know? If it’s so rare?”
Harry began to feel angry as he left Daisy’s room. Yes, Draco had a right to be mad that Harry had gone behind his back to the Aurors and accused Blaise. But didn’t Harry have a right to be angry with Draco for being emotionally distant? For being the one who kissed him and then acting as if it was Harry’s fault he felt anything in the first place? For saying he couldn’t trust Harry to be in a relationship, or that Harry’s coming out was nothing but a phase attributed to a mid-life crisis? That was all cruel and misguided, while Harry had simply been doing what Draco had wanted in the first place. Trying to solve the mystery. Although he didn’t want to believe, he did think Blaise was the one to blame. And when that was revealed today, Draco would be needing to apologize to him.
“What? I’ve gone my whole life feeling excluded when you two talked about relationship things. Harry’s in my territory now,” Hermione countered.
“Aviary, if anyone deserves to cry, it’s you. That bullshit they teach us in Auror training about hiding our feelings until a case is completely solved? It’s ridiculous. The only way to process this is head on,” Harry told her.
“Well said, Molly,” Fleur said, “Did I tell you all about how Louie received full marks on his last spelling exam?”
Dean rolled his eyes, “I should’ve guessed,” With that, he turned back to Hermione as if nothing had happened.
“Compliments. Saying what I mean. Feelings,” Draco answered bluntly, “I’ve never been good at any of it.”
As Draco gave him a small smile, Harry wanted nothing more than to crawl over and kiss him senseless. But, his desperate feelings aside, he didn’t think now was the time.
She whipped around now to face Harry, her eyes darker than Harry had ever seen them, “Yes, Potter, I know. I know you’ve been in love with Draco. You two created a little investigative team you thought I and my cousin didn’t know anything about. But while you were working hard to contaminate a descendant of one of the only respectable wizarding families left in the world, I was watching your every move. You and Draco are no longer a threat to us.”
Ginny nodded in agreement. While Harry couldn’t deny taking on this job was a brave risk for anyone, something about the situation felt off. Blaise had been in Games and Sports the entire time he was at the ministry. Why would he suddenly want a position so vastly different from the job he loved? As Ginny and Hermione continued to talk, their voices faded around him as he continued to think about Blaise Zabini.
“The spell didn’t hit him, Harry,” Ginny explained, “Seamus noticed Ida was going back for her wand…”
“Well, we don’t really have time to argue, now do we?” Harry, slightly more bitterly than he had planned, “Let’s go help clear Level One.”
“Savant was hard at work when I left at midnight. There’s no way he’s left yet. Unless of course he’s fallen asleep. And Aviary hasn’t left the office in the past week,” Ida told him.
“Who knows?” Aviary looked away from the window she had been staring out for about twenty minutes, “Ida could have gone with another Auror. It could have taken her awhile to be able to speak alone with Aries alone. And the Ministry is a hell hole right now. Padma could just not have time to go to her office and send us a message.”
“I will,” he lied. He watched as Padma went into the room and greeted Ida, who also gave her another big hug. He then walked out of eyesight and apparated straight into Draco’s apartment, banking on the wards being open to him.
Ginny sighed and grabbed Harry’s arm, “Ron,” she said, “This isn’t how we wanted you to find out… but Harry and I have decided to get a divorce.”
Harry rolled his eyes, “No, I was planning on talking to you about how hard it was to realize I was straight.”
“Harry, I don’t really have another husband-wife ‘let’s not lie to one another’ talk in me right now,” she said matter of factly, “I’m not mad at you. I don’t care if you're friends with Draco Malfoy, and I understand why you didn’t want to tell me about it. Just don’t fucking lie anymore, and we’ll be fine. And also, if there is anything more to this story that Seamus didn’t blurt out last night, I’d love to know about it.”
Harry collapsed against the wall, regret flooding him. He had sent an innocent and kind man to the Ministry for an interrogation?
Harry nodded in agreement. Parvati and Lavender were having their first dance. Lavender had chosen a floor length white gown with plenty of lace, while Parvati was wearing a shorter fitted white dress. As they held close to each other, Harry could see the clear love and adoration in their faces. They really cared about each other.
Thankfully, Malfoy moved to slide his binder towards Harry and began to talk about a man he had been trailing the last couple days. Harry leaned in and listened raptly; the man Marcus Olio, sounded like a legitimate suspect. Malfoy had seen him lurking outside of multiple muggle pubs and shops.
Scorpius beamed, “I know a lot about tawny owls. Well, owls in general. But tawneys are my favorite.”
Harry was about to ask about a rather stunning necklace sitting on a pillow, when Draco said, “So, where’s the rest of my apology?”
Draco nodded, “Yes. The person who takes the poison can never produce their own child. They also infect anyone they have intercourse with throughout their life.”
“Actually, you are exactly who I have been wanting to see,” Molly walked towards him, “Harry, I am not upset at you.”
“You know, it’s funny,” Harry said after he and Malfoy finished laughing over the time Molly dragged Arthur to an album signing after finding him hiding in the broom shed, “I bet if you got Molly and your mother together, they could talk about Celestina for hours.”
She rolled her eyes, “I’ve told you once, I’ve told you a million times. I don’t want to get married.”
Harry reached out and placed his hand on Draco’s shoulder before his brain could tell him this was a bad idea, “Draco, it wasn’t about that. Ron and Padma trust you.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes, “Isn’t it obvious, Potter? I needed an out from a particularly clingy bar-goer. He was starting to think we were going to be going home together and I was anything but interested.”
To Harry’s immediate amusement, Malfoy was leading a long, slender creature on a bright yellow leash towards him. As he neared, Harry recognized the animal as none other than the famous and previously unacquainted Murr, which Harry could confirm by the small collar along the ferret’s neck spelling out his name in bright, golden letters.
Harry ordered a drink, hoping to ease some of his tension. He was now becoming mad at himself for acting the way he did towards his friends, but this anger at himself did not erase the anger he still felt towards them. They had basically shoved aside everything he and Malfoy had been doing for the past month in a matter of seconds. But as much as Harry wanted to go back and tell them all the evidence they had found themselves, he knew he wouldn’t. This investigation was Malfoy’s. As much as Harry trusted the Aurors, he didn’t trust that his newfound friendship with Malfoy would survive Harry giving away all their information. And, despite himself, Harry was rather starting to like the time he spent with his once schoolboy enemy. He was funny, clever and surprisingly caring, and well, Harry didn’t know. Something he couldn’t quite explain.
“Ron?” Hermione’s voice sounded from over his shoulder. This caught Ron’s attention. He jumped up and out of Harry’s grasp and rushed to Hermione’s side.
She took one look at Ginny and Harry’s expressions before she ran over to the bed and wrapped them in a hug.
Ida rolled her eyes and momentarily dropped her hair to reach for the mead still in Harry’s arms, “I’m going to need this if I’m going to get through this night alive.”
“Are you ready for the match of the year?” Harry said loudly over the screams of Roxy and Fred (boy did Angelina and George have loud children).
“Oh…” Harry said softly. He pictured her rushing through the hallways, doing her job with an urgency and precision most people could only dream of.
Draco snorted and began to move hesitantly towards him. He stopped about a foot away, and Harry couldn’t breathe. His whole body feels like it’s made of sand. Was Draco going to kiss him? But before he can internally panic about this thought, Draco wrapped him in a hug.
Harry recognized a list of assignments on the door of room 06. Under the words ‘Aries Reyes’ were instructions on what to do to check up on the patient. As a trainee, Harry wasn’t in charge of healing the patient in any way. He could only help with that under the supervision of a Healer. For this rotation, he was in charge of checking up on patients after they had been healed but weren’t yet cleared to leave.
No answer. Harry pulled out his wand and muttered “lumos” to get his bearings. There were four different doors at the end of the hallway. He made his way towards the first one. He tapped loudly. When there was no answer, he opened the door to reveal a bathroom. He continued to the next room, did the same thing, and discovered a spare bedroom. He made his way to the third door and opened it without knocking. He gasped when the light of his wand reflected off of something shiny. He found the light switch on the wall beside him and flipped it, illuminating the entire room. He was immediately bombarded with dozens and dozens of reflecting objects. Harry moved closer to inspect the mysterious objects, and found he was looking at rows and rows of vases, plates, cups, bowls and more. He forgot about all he had come here for, he forgot about his search for Draco. The pottery was beautiful, intricate, breathtaking. He moved down the first row, realizing that each piece had its own design, painted on with painstaking detail. Harry’s breath caught when he spotted one that looked all too familiar. It was him. On a plate. Sitting at Smith and Walton’s, a large black mug of tea in front of him. He was in mid-laugh, clearly enjoying something Draco had said. Harry marveled at how Draco had viewed these meetings at Smith and Walton’s. Or in the park, Harry thought as he noticed a bowl with him, Draco and Murr painted in the center. Draco has painted them both smiling down at Murr, who was jumping up onto Harry. Draco had seen their interactions as Harry had; as so much more than a partnership, but a friendship. Two people finding they had much more in common then they could have ever anticipated. Draco felt something for him. And Harry knew that by the two attempted kisses Harry had gotten from him, they were certainly feelings of more than just friendship.
“No!” Aviary argued, “I’m sure the Aurors can handle it. Draco, Harry was just talking about how you two believe Kareach has been targeting you the past couple attacks! You can’t just willingly go into that!”
“We all managed to get off early tonight,” Ron said, “Although we’ll be facing mountains of paperwork and meetings tomorrow,” then, as if something had just occurred to him, he gestured to his fellow Aurors and said to Dean and Seamus, “I hope it’s not a problem I invited some extra Aurors. We could all use a break, and Sunday’s at your flat is the perfect way to do just that.”
The four fell silent, not knowing what to say anymore. Harry decided to do his best to alleviate their heartache.
“But you weren’t… you…” Draco sighed, “You knew you… liked me. You could tell me straight to my face. I hid behind secret kisses and anger. You, on the other hand, were telling your kids we are dating.”
After reaching down to pick up his daughter and give her a kiss on the cheek, Harry smiled down at Roxanne. She definitely had her dad’s spirit; she loved anything that had to do with messing with her older brother.
Seb shrugged, “I mean, I would still listen. I wouldn’t know, but I heard the lives of straight people are pretty tragic.”
With that, Savant flung open the door with his wand and made his way to the seat behind his desk. Ida and Harry walked in after him and took their seats opposite at the big mahogany desk.
By the smell that immediately fell over him as soon as Ginny walked in, he could tell she had had a large amount to drink. However, Ginny looked just as composed as ever as she flopped on top of her side of the bed. She could hold her liquor better than anyone he had ever met.
As Harry made his way into the room. Aries head snapped up. He glared instantly, “You’re Ginerva’s husband,” his eyes narrowed threateningly.
“It seems you’re already focused,” Harry joked softly, noting the softening of Draco’s eyes as Harry spoke.
Harry watched as Brayan raised his eyebrows at this, no doubt feeling that Savant was trying to get Harry back as an Auror.
She looked back at him with determination, “I know his family. Harry, my own family is one of the oldest pureblood families in the world, one of the only few virtually untouched by muggle blood. The Malfoys and the Blacks are also two of those families. Unlike us, they are beyond determined to keep this status. My father used to talk about how far they would go to insure their blood is pure and that muggleborns are eradicated. Not just lessened, eradicated. Their families are evil, Harry.”
“I didn’t know what the spell did,” Harry supplied unnecessarily, “And I should never have begun to fight you straight away. And I should’ve helped better. I’m sorry.”
“I’m not yet an old witch, Potter. I shall not be referred to as ‘mam’ until I feel it is right,” Patrick said swiftly, stopping abruptly in front of a door and walking in.
Ron rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly, “I needed more support! This whole family is becoming bloody Puddlemere fanatics.”
“Fine,” he resigned, reaching out for his new glass of wine and taking a long sip, “But I want it to be noted I’d much rather talk about my pet ferret than the shambles of my career.”
“Are you and Draco…” he trailed off and looked at Hermione, who shot him a look that clearly told him she was not helping in this.
Harry realized this must be the reason Malfoy was here; why else would he be waiting near a conference room?
“Harry?” Seb appeared in the doorway, his brow furrowed in concern. His eyes momentarily expanded as he caught sight of Harry. He probably was a sight to see; shirtless, seething with rage and standing over a pile of phone shards.
“I’m recovered!” Seb exclaimed, holding his arms out wide to show off his dragon pox free complexion.
“Because!” Harry sputtered, “They act like a couple! With how much time they spend together and how well they know each other, I thought it was obvious! And then there was that bloody rumor Seamus told us! I can’t believe it isn’t true!”
“Yeah, would you?” Albus piped in, “We want to see if someone can get it to do three back flips in a row!”
“I am Healer Didodella Patrick, but you can refer to me exclusively as Healer Patrick. My first name is dreadful, do not use if if you want to continue to be my assistant,” she said this all without giving any indication she was moving at an above average pace, “I obviously wanted to work with you because I admired your talent and drive while attending to the muggle patients this past week. I also noticed you can work quickly with little error, which is crucial to the high stress environment of the hospital. So, you will do what I say, when I say it and without complaint. Do you understand?”
“That’s not a question,” Malfoy pointed out, but continued, “I still adore Astoria as a person. I’ll always love her, but just not in the way I need to in order to be her husband.”
“Harry!” Ida said, concern etching her face, “We were so worried! One moment you were talking to us and the next you were gone!”
She stared at the wall, perfectly silent. Harry stood watching them in the tense silence. For the first time during one of their battle scene aftermaths, he felt out of place, like he was intruding. But he knew leaving the room wasn’t an option. He just wished there was any way, any possible way, to make this situation better.
“She has a point there,” Harry agreed, thinking of Theodore Nott, who was also working as an Auror for the Ministry. He was nothing like the vindictive and judgemental boy Harry had known at Hogwarts; he was a hardworking and kind man Harry had admired as a fellow Auror.
“Oh, Ron,” Harry said softly. He couldn’t begin to imagine how scary Ron’s position must be, “I’m so sorry. But you are getting closer. You already caught one of them. I have full faith that you will get to the bottom of this. And I’ll be here to help, anyway you need me.”
“Choose the table with a view, eh?” Harry joked, glancing up at the mid-action shot of Beckham kicking a football.
“We do think that…” Ida paused and looked at Padma and Aviary to see if they would say anything against her telling Harry any more information. Neither said anything, so Ida plowed on, “We think that the attacks are a solo operation.”
Savant treating him like he was rejoining the Auror team made Harry realize something. He wasn’t doing this because he wanted to be an Auror. He was doing this because of Draco. Because Draco asked and he couldn’t resist any chance to make a difference, to help using his own insight at the hospital. But here he was, acting as if he was Ida’s partner again, when his own partner was home asleep, none the wiser to the plans they were making behind his back.
Brayan shook his head, sending a little flare streaking past Harry’s chair, “No. I would be one of the first to know, so there is a slim chance anything new has been uncovered. Now Harry,” he continued, giving Harry a slightly belittling look that caught him off guard; this was the look Brayan usually reserved for the less talented trainees, “I know you want to do everything you can to help out. But we have the most clever and well-accomplished staff of Healers at St. Mungos that are doing much more than looking through history books. While I admire your attempts, I would recommend you use your time more wisely and prep for your upcoming exam. You haven’t always been as accomplished at test taking than as you are at the practical parts of healing.”
“Harry?...” the words sounded far away, distant, as if they were being said through water. But Harry knew that voice. It was Ron. But why was Ron there? Wasn’t Harry at work?
“I know that now,” Draco sat down on the edge of the bed, “Harry, when I saw Ida fire that curse at you last night… I felt like I was the one dying. The only thing I could think of us dying to save you. And then this morning… waiting to see if everything was okay… I’ve never felt so worried and restless in my life. You make me feel grounded, Harry. You make me feel like my life is worth so much more.”
Without hesitation, Harry answered, “Of course. I trust almost all of the Aurors completely. I worked with Padma for years. She is a good person who works harder than any other Auror I’ve met. Not only can we trust her, I think she’d also be an essential resource. She’s brilliant and always notices things no one else does. Ron, on the other hand, is able to put together big picture things much better. That’s why they make the perfect team. They would be perfect to work with us.”
He apparated into the living room without warning, hoping that Hermione would forgive him for his rudeness. Listening for the tell-tale sound of frantic quill against parchment, he quickly found Hermione at the dining room table, papers spread in an array around her as she wrote fiercely on her nearly completely black parchment.
As tradition, Harry and Ginny hosted a Christmas Eve celebration at their house. They invited all their friends and family every year to have dinner and drinks. As Harry was rushing through the house finishing up last minute food preparations and decorations, he heard his kids voices chime with excitement. Setting down the quiche he had in his arms, he walked into the living area to see Ron, Hermione and Rose still covered in Floo powder, an hour early as usual.
Ron said nothing but slowly let the death grip he had on Hermione’s arms go. As Dean and Hermione disappeared into nothingness, Ron let out a wail that set Harry’s hair on edge. The last thing Harry wanted to do was turn away from his closest friend at his lowest moment, but he knew what he needed to do next. He turned around to make sure his kids had gotten away safely. To his relief, the only people in his family remaining were Bill, George, Luna, Neville, Hannah and Seamus, who were now all casting spells against Kareach members. Harry didn’t spot any green beams of light. The Kareach members were not aiming to kill innocent pure bloods or half bloods. Harry knew it would only be a matter of time until this changed. Sure enough, one of the masked figures spotted Draco and shouted. Without waiting to see what would come of this, Harry grabbed Draco and apparated to St. Mungos.
“So?” Harry asked anxiously. Draco had arrived in the living room of Grimmauld place moments ago holding an empty grocery bag.
Harry’s entire stomach dropped to his feet. He felt his pulse raising, the wall’s closing in around him. This couldn’t be happening. Them wanting a baby was a complete uncertainty, something they had been doubtful about for years. This was the worst possible time for them to make the decision. As the room broke into shouts of congratulations and hugs as Seamus and Dean explained further their decision, Harry sat in stunned silence, not knowing what to do or say. He barely registered Louis reaching for his hand.
“That’s incredible!” Harry smiled at him, “Did you come back for your check-up?” Dragon pox patients had to come back for a check-up a month after full recovery to make sure the disease was truly gone.
Harry was trying not to look at her. He couldn’t confess why he was so upset so he didn’t want Luna to see he had been crying. But Luna wasn’t looking at him anyway. She was staring out across the lawn. The silence comforted Harry in a way he couldn’t explain. He needed someone to just let him feel sad without an explanation.
Harry tried to not worry that Draco hadn’t been back to see him in hours. He was sure that he was getting some well deserved rest, that was all. There was no reason for Harry, absolutely none at all, for him to worry about Draco being gone for several hours without contacting him. Just because Harry wanted to spend every waking minute with Draco now that he knew Draco liked him back didn’t mean that’s what Draco wanted.
“And I like Draco. He’s fucking awesome. I don’t know where any of us would be without him,” Ron stated.
“You have to,” Harry said, “I can’t believe I’m saying it, but I do think it was him. What Ida was saying made a good amount of sense.”
Harry felt a blaze of rage as hot as the flames build up inside him. Ida was sitting across from Savant, talking urgently with her boss. Harry had known that Ida being in the office was a strong possibility, but he still wasn’t prepared to see her sitting there, so at ease, acting as if she was legitimately concerned about saving the lives of innocent muggleborns. He couldn’t hear what they were saying; a charm was put on the fireplace that prevented any caller from hearing what they were saying until a person in the room lifted the charm. Everything in Harry was telling him not to break the charm. He wanted to back away and never see Ida ever again. Her betrayal felt like a fresh wound. He couldn’t believe that this kind and fiercely determined woman, who wove her hair in elaborate braids and liked to go to the pub with Harry as a post-Christmas tradition, was the same person who killed dozens of innocent people. For a moment, Harry considered the possibility that Aviary was mistaken. But then he remembered the steely sureness of her voice, the pure hatred and disappointment Aviary now held for someone she considered a great friend. Ida was guilty. Harry would have to deal with his anger and damaged emotional stability later.
Harry was surprised by Caser’s statement until he remembered Caser’s mother had died in the war at the hands of one of the Death Eaters. Feeling empathetic, Harry nodded and whispered back, “Thanks, Caser. I’m glad you’ve found as much joy in healing so far as I have.”
Harry looked at the paper as Draco placed it down in front of him. He now realized the picture depicted a human that seemed to be unaffected with Chann. Harry’s stomach dropped as he began to read the side effects, which were both drawn on the person and described on the sides. The entire person was shaded a bright orange, indicating the tint of orange Harry had witnessed on every poisoned patient he had encountered. The eyes were labeled with the words ``glassy and distant looking before the seizure”, driving home the fact that this was exactly what Harry had feared. Chann was the poison Kareach had been using.
“They prove many things!” Al said, “I asked Scorp about them and he said they didn’t exist. He said they were “the things the Quibbler made up” and that I shouldn’t believe the tall tales of many magical creatures outside of the Care of Magical Creatures book.”
Maybe Mary sent him a haughty look, but Dean was agreeing with him earnestly. Harry and Dean began talking about how Seamus had taken to staying up all night trying to predict what team would win the UK tournament (Harry was learning Seamus had quite the brain for statistics) when Harry spotted a familiar head of blonde hair across the canteen. Sue enough, as the man sporting the blonde hair turned to his side, Harry saw the unmistakable profile of Draco Malfoy standing near conference room B and looking up at the menu options flashing magically across the front of the food line in midair.
“Harry?” Dean asked softly, lowering himself down besides Harry, “Luna says you want to talk to us?”
“I don’t know, let’s think,” Draco answered angrily, “Every time I talk to you, it’s something new. What are you going to do this time? Yell at me? Start ignoring me for a week for no apparent reason? Because you seem to be doing that a lot lately.”
Even the match, which is one of the closest and most intriguing he has ever watched, couldn’t distract him. As his family cheered heartedly as Angelina scored her first goal, he remained silent, watching Draco out of the corner of his eye. Draco, the constant master of normalcy, seems to be enjoying himself fully as he talked avidly to his son and Blaise, who were sitting on either side of him. It made Harry feel almost as if he had imagined the kiss. Clearly, that wasn’t the case, but it would have made much more sense. The last thing Harry had expected when he pulled Draco under those bleachers was for him to kiss Harry. To fulfill the longing Harry had felt for weeks. Had it been a moment of weakness? Draco had been the most emotionally vulnerable Harry had ever seen him. Harry’s kind words probably made him feel good in the moment and he lost his cool and kissed Harry. How else could the look of panic and regret in Draco’s eyes be explained? Was Harry nothing more than a panicked kiss in the face of loneliness?
“Let’s just get his statement done,” Remmins gestured towards the door, “We promise to keep it professional.”
“Oi, Potter!” a voice behind him caught Harry’s attention. He turned to see Healer Brayan, walking down the stands towards him, “I knew I would be seeing you here.”
Harry looked Ginny in the eyes. He chose this moment to trust her, to stop lying. He told her everything, from the first time Harry and Draco really talked at the Leaky to the awful conversation they had in Conference Room B after Draco found out about Chann. He told her how he was involved every step of the way.
With this new outlook in mind, Harry apparated into the ground floor of the hospital Monday morning feeling positive about the day and excited about the opportunities Healer Patrick could open up for him. He took the lift to the fifth floor and walked across the canteen to the conference room the trainees met in. The meeting went better than usual. Caser and another trainee named Hedra who he had been getting along with sat on each side of Harry and swapped stories of their craziest experiences in the last week while they waited for Healer Brayan to begin. The only bad part was when Brayan gave instructions for the day and numerous trainees glowered at him for getting the week with Patrick. This was quickly made up for by the icey retort Caser made when a particularly unpleasant bloke called him a “pretentious suck-up” in which Caser told him to “stop putting Harry down, you’re only jealous of how much better he is at healing”. All in all, the day was looking brighter and brighter as he made his way to the second floor and walked down a hallway to Healer Patrick’s office. He gave the door a sharp rapt with his knuckles and waited for an answer (Dean had told Harry that Patrick moved at a quick pace and appreciated efficiency in interactions).
“Well,” Draco stood up and faced away from Harry as he took out his wand, “I need to get back home to Scorp. I have him this Christmas.”
“Harry,” Ginny snapped, holding up her wand threateningly, “I will sting you again. I don’t want you to think of some ruddy excuse to tell me. I want the truth. For once!”
“No, not exactly. She was on the phone for a while with someone she said is a “bloody wanker”, which I can only assume is that coach of Angelina’s team,” James replied.
Harry looked down at his daughter as she turned in Angelina’s grasp to get a good look at her older brother. “I want to play, not spin!” she retorted, eyes narrowed. She was a little Ginny through and through, from her bright red hair to her refusal to put up with anything her brothers threw at her (literally or figuratively).
“Oh no!” Ida exclaimed, “Is she alright? We have a couple lower-level Aurors searching for her but they hadn’t found anything!”
“Hey,” Aviary moved so she was standing right beside Harry, “He’s going to be okay. He’s just releasing bug bombs. It’s not like much will happen to him if he’s caught.”
Harry shot him a hurt look, trying desperately to ignore how blue Draco’s eyes were. And they were so fucking blue.
Harry watched as the entire group stopped what they were doing and came over to see him. He was first embraced by Ida and Padma, followed by a rib-crushing hug from Aviary.
“Yep,” Seb confirmed, tapping his hand against the table without seeming to notice, “And I’m all clear! Mighty glad I got through that mess, it was something just short of hell.”
Harry shuddered at the thought. The idea of losing any other innocent people made his body stiff with anger and fear.
Harry snorted but said nothing. He continued to answer Aviary and Remmins’ questions, nervously tapping his foot the whole time. When they finally finished, he left quickly without a goodbye. He was walking down the hallway towards the canteen when he spotted Ida alone in conference room A.
Harry looked at Draco directly now for the first time. He looked exhausted, weary, beaten down. But he also looked fierce and determined. Harry believed him, believed in him.
Harry laughed and pointed at the glass, “I’m saved from answering by the three-drink rule. It’s time for you to tell me what made my interview with you a living hell.”
Harry shushed him gently and continued to seal up the large cuts across his face as Seamus held him steady. Once he had healed the gashes the best he could, Harry began to clean the blood from Draco’s head and face. He then did a routine check on Draco. When he was sure Draco would be fine, he pulled back, his heart hammering as he fell into something behind him.
“I’m sorry, Draco,” Harry said, forcing himself to look directly at Draco, “I was in a weird mood last Friday and I acted like a wanker when you came to Mungos. “
Draco nodded, “I wasn’t about to let her die from this terrible poison. And I couldn’t have done it without Harry.”
“At least I didn’t pull a Seamus-Dean and pretend I wasn’t in love with my best friend for years,” Harry shot back.
Ginny gave a sudden stiff laugh that caught Harry off guard, “I don’t think this is how these conversations are supposed to go,” she said feebly.
“No, I would be foolish to tarnish it with my magic and fingerprints when the culprit’s could have been all over it!” Draco exclaimed, “I should have recognized it as a decoy and preserved it immediately. Now it’s barely traceable.”
“Yeah mate,” Seamus said as he said down next to Dean and put an arm around him, “Are you alright? What’s been going on?”
Ida and Savant stopped talking and turned their heads to look at the fireplace. Savant’s eyes widened in surprise as he waved his wand to remove the charm.
“Lumos,” Draco murmured from beneath him. Harry knew this was a bad idea as soon as it happened; there was no doubt in his mind that the killing curses were meant for Draco.
“Is Chann the poison?” Aviary asked. Harry could tell that despite how terrible she was feeling about everything, her Auror reflexes were taking over. She needed to know the truth.
The rest of the interview dragged on in a series of jaded questions and short answers. Harry didn’t need to make the interview his own; he hadn’t even been eager to go through with it in the first place. All in all, Harry was more than happy when Malfoy announced he had asked his last question and Harry was free to go. Harry was about to stand up when a breathless Healer Brayan ran into the room. Darius Brayan was the head of the Healer Training department; he oversaw the courses Harry took and had guided Harry through multiple hands-on practices with actual patients. Harry liked Healer Brayan, but he could be a bit overbearing at times. Brayan thought quite highly of himself, and it wasn’t hard to see why; Brayan had irrefutable good looks. With his curly dark hair, deep brown eyes and dark skin, he was the definition of a good-looking bloke and he knew it. He played into any attention he could get. Despite this, Harry still couldn’t help but like the guy; he was a brilliant teacher, being patient, kind and incredibly intelligent. However, Harry had a sinking suspicion Brayan’s sudden burst into the room had nothing to do with Harry’s training and a whole lot to do with the interview that was about to be published in the most popular wizarding newspaper in London.
Harry dropped the glass he was holding; it landed with a loud crash against the floor before anyone could stop it with their wands. Hermione reflexively cleaned up his mess with her wand as the people around the room expressed shock at the new information, although not as much as Harry had.
“She will be fine, thankfully,” Harry said, trying desperately to sound reassuring, “But she is extremely knackered. She must have gone to a pub after the news about Remmins began too much and drank until herself away. I don’t even know how she managed to get to my house.”
“Plant the bug Draco gave you on her. We have a plan to get her to Aries, where they will hopefully talk about their next plan. All we need is a way to listen in on the conversation without her realizing.”
Harry’s head whips to the direction Al is pointing in. Sure enough, a few rows down, Scorpius is sitting there with not only his father, but Blaise and Pansy. The worst possible group Harry could talk to at the moment.
“The case I was given wasn’t a typical article. I had to convince my boss the importance of it, although I’m sure he still believes what I’m investigating is all rumors,” Malfoy paused, as a brief anger passed over his face, “He doesn’t realize the dangers that could be involved if no one acts. Not even the Aurors are taking it seriously, not with the recent attacks to focus on. This is the reason I started working as a reporter. I want to make an actual difference in people’s lives through the power of printed words. But I’ve had too little results for too long. The Prophet has told me to stop working on the important case and has resorted to only giving me fluff pieces, like the one about your career change and the history of the wolfsbane article I started yesterday at St. Mungos. That’s the reason I was so irritable during the interview. It was unprofessional on my part, but I was at my breaking point with the rubbish the Prophet was leaving me with.”
Harry shook his head. Honestly, if he told the story of Hermione’s pregnancy to Seamus, he would have to understand why Harry had taken a while to get back to his home. Harry opened his mouth to tell Seamus all of this, but something made him stop. He straightened himself and turned to face his friend.
Seamus worked in the Department of Magical Games and Sports, and was, as a result, very informed on every quidditch event that happened in the United Kingdom. The Cannons and Puddlemere were currently the top teams in the league; it was looking as though they would play each other in the annual UK/Ireland quidditch championship.
“Harry, my dear boy! What brings you to my fireplace in this time of crisis?” Savant addressed him heartily.
The five of them stood in silence at Ida’s words. Harry wondered how long the Healers in the canteen were forced to fight before someone notified the Aurors. He wondered if Kareach did anything to the rest of the building that prevented them from contacting the Ministry, like altering the apparation wards or the floo network. Whatever it was, twenty casualties was a lot. And that was in a hospital. Who knew what Kareach was capable of if an attack in a hospital led to the death of twenty people.
Harry did just that, going through the fire and standing in Draco’s living area seconds later. The effect of Draco’s apartment was amplified as he stood within it.
Malfoy snorted, “Well, she’s pan, so I wouldn’t say “gay” is the correct label. But if you had any conversation with her in the last ten years, it would’ve been blindingly clear she is anything but straight.”
Malfoy kept his face blank as he stared at Harry. Harry began to feel he made a dreadful mistake. There was no way Malfoy would want his help, he didn’t even want Harry to know about the investigation in the first place.
“He did look outside today, right?” Harry questioned, looking through the window at the large raindrops accompanying the grey sky.
“I’m doing something important,” Draco huffed, “I thought we both were. But clearly I’ve been much more dedicated.”
Soon both Albus and James were at his sides, throwing their arms around him just as their sister did. Ginny joined in a moment later, wrapping her arms around all the kids to complete the group hug. Harry lost himself in the warmth of their love, the feeling that he was once again whole.
“Harry, you don't have to do this,” he said softly. The intensity in his voice sent shivers down Harry’s spine, “This is my job, my decision. I just got excited that someone else believed me. That doesn't make it right for me to use you.”
Realizing he had not been listening to the conversation in the slightest, Harry said, “What do I think about what?”
“Draco!” Harry shouted, a searing pain burning in his stomach as the events of last night resurfaced. Ida screaming, the flash of green light, Draco diving in front of him.
Harry knew in this moment there was no more denying that Ida did it. Despite the fact everything about the truth felt wrong to him, he trusted Aviary. The seriousness and pure anger enforced in her words left little doubt in Harry’s mind that she could have been imagining Ida being the murderer.
Malfoy looked utterly confused. He stared at Harry for a moment, as if he was a puzzle he could never solve, and let out a loud laugh.
“Oh, Harry!” she suddenly exclaimed, “How long have you known? How long have you felt like you can’t talk to me! I’ve noticed you've been oddly distant from all of us for a while. Was this why? I hope you know how much we love you!”
“Second of all,” she said forcibly, “We don’t know what wand is being used. Whoever is casting the curse is doing a great job of concealing their own magic. We were only able to detect that one wand is being used during all of the attacks, not multiple.”
He rubbed slow circles on her back until she had calmed down enough to take normal size breaths. Finally, when she had stopped crying enough to speak, she said,
“So, the injury,” Blaise began as he gained his composure, “Reyes and I were on the same bloody team. I was a chaser and he was a beater. I quickly became fed up with him not protecting Ginny from the bludgers and I told him so. He was frustrated with me and decided to take out his frustration by nailing me directly in the arm with a bludger.”
“That’s where I came in,” Padma explained, “I managed to escape through the lift and go down and bring in reinforcements.”
Harry reached for his fork and thanked Dean. He looked up to tell Dean his ranking of the canteen pie flavors, when he noticed Dean was staring at him absently, his eyes glazed over.
“There’s not really anything to tell,” Draco admitted bitterly, “It was all a dead end. I waited outside some Russian pub for hours and absolutely nothing happened. And I had the inside bugged so I would’ve heard if someone apparated in.”
“I knew it was you,” Draco barely mumbled. The statement made little sense in context of their lives now, but Harry in his gut knew Draco was talking about the day at Malfoy Manor when Draco had been “unable” to identify Harry.
“I know what you are thinking,” Padma supplied, “But it’s not Zabini. It sure does look like him though. And although I hate to admit it, Zabini is a fine bloke. My ruddy sister was right,” She shuddered at this and took a swing of her butterbeer. Padma wasn’t much of a drinker.
Minutes later, the two stood outside of Savant’s office. It was in harsh contrast to the last time they had stood here together. Then, they had both been clean and wearing robes. Harry became aware that he hadn’t showered in a day or two and that his hair was highly tousled from trying desperately to sleep for hours at no avail. Ida’s hair in the light of the hallway looked like she hadn’t changed the braids looped into buns for days. They hung limply at the sides of her head while strands of her dark hair stuck out every which way.
Harry laughed and tossed his stuff onto the bed. He was about to wander back out into the living room when he remembered he was still in his scrubs. As that was not proper pub attire, Harry reached for his favorite pair of jeans that were so worn even Ginny didn’t like him to wear them (and she wore her pajamas to a quidditch match once just to spite some wanker of a reporter who criticized her clothing choice at a Ministry function). He pulled off his top and reached for another one of his favorite pieces of clothing (an extremely soft blue t-shirt) when his phone rang. Harry groaned internally and considered not even checking who was calling. There weren’t many people he felt like talking to at the moment. Then it occurred to him that, in a time where two of his closest friends had almost died from attacks, he couldn’t ignore his phone.
“But this is crucial,” Draco insisted, “She would have found a way to let us know straight away, so we can get there as soon as possible.”
Hermione nodded, “I do. For what it’s worth, I think Blaise is pretty great. I mean, anyone who makes it their mission to personally scout out new security forces is good in my book.”
“Ginny…” Harry was desperate now. He was barely aware of the crowd that had gathered around the three of them. He needed Ginny to understand that none of this was personal.
“Are you fucking kidding me, Draco?” Harry whispered so Seb wouldn’t hear him, “That’s not how this works. You said some really hurtful things to me, after you came onto me. We can’t just keep breezing past the hard things and pretending nothing is wrong.”
Hermione rolled her eyes, “Yes, because Angelina is on the team! Ron, we should all lend support to both teams. Ginny and Angelina have both worked hard.”
“How do we know he wasn’t bloody well close to becoming one?” Padma asked, “But now we both like and trust him!”
Trying to control his frustration, Harry said, “I don’t believe every article is on me, believe or not. And I only agreed to your article because I thought it would be better for me to give my own story before the Prophet came out with some wild version of me leaving the Ministry. They would have said I hate Ron or some insane rubbish like that.”
“It’s one of the newspapers written for Voldemort supporters we discovered during the Blackwell case. I remembered the name Foget and went through the articles with Savant until I found it,” she gestured at the floor, which Harry now realized was covered in articles just like the one in his hand.
“Oh, there’s more. You also wouldn’t eat anything on the menu at any place we went besides blueberry scones. Not to mention the hour I spent listening to you rant about the lack of food you like in the canteen. It sounds as though you’ll eat about two meals out of the approximately forty they serve and you’ll only eat the blueberry crumble for dessert. That’s picky, my dear friend.”
“I hate this fucking clock,” she mumbled fiercely, pulling her red hair into a messy pony tail and stalking to the bathroom.
“No, not at all,” Malfoy shook his head and waved a bartender over to order a glass of Superior Red wine. Harry desperately tried to work out what was going on in his head as he waited for Malfoy to continue.
“I have an interview to get to. A rather pointless one, at that, but I couldn’t let Healer Brayan get another day in the sun so I said I would do it,” she leaned in and muttered, “Harry, between you and me, Healer Brayan should not be in the position he is in here at St. Mungos. Do be careful,” as fast as she had said this, she pulled back and continued, “You will need to keep an eye on Mr. Haffer for the next hour or so. I will come and fetch you when I think it is safe for you to leave. Yesterday he had a near fatal episode from a negative reaction to the cure. It is not a full-proof cure. It’s rather poor, to be exact, but it’s all we got at the moment and it works almost all of the time. All I need you to do is watch over him and call for aid if he appears to have another attack. Now, I must go tell a reporter all I know on wolfsbane, a complete and good use of a Healer’s time,” she began to walk away at the end of this sentence, walking at her advanced speed towards the lift at the end of the hallway.
Aviary’s head snapped up. Her hands fell to her sides as she turned to face Harry directly, “No. I will not have you believe anything but the truth, not even for a moment,” Ginny moved to pat her back, but she brushed it off, “Gani Remmins was murdered by Ida, not two hours ago, in his own house! I heard her, telling him that he needed to take back what he said about Brayan being Imperius-ed or she would kill him! And Gani, Gani refused! Of course he did. He believed in justice and truth above all else, because he was a good man with strong morals. I thought Ida was the same way, but I was wrong. We all were wrong.”
Realistically, though, he wasn’t going to get assigned to the second floor for every rotation. Part of training was exploring the five different floors and the opportunities that came with each of them. So Harry silenced his inner disappointments and made his way to the lift with Caser in tow.
As Molly pulled back and gave Harry a small smile, Harry felt his heart give a tug. Through all of this mess, Harry couldn’t help think about the other thing in his life causing him extreme pain. He could hardly look Molly in the eye. He couldn’t break her daughter’s heart. Or the hearts of his entire family, from his in laws to his own children. Draco wasn’t that important to him. But a part of him nagged, what if happiness was?
Surprised, Harry’s stomach did an odd turn. Molly had a sixth sense for sadness left undetected by anyone else. Yet, Harry couldn’t bring himself to admit that he was feeling anything more than content on this lazy Sunday afternoon.
Ida had initially invited Harry out to the Leaky in order to catch up, but told Harry she ran into Padma and Aviary as she was leaving the office and couldn’t resist inviting them along. Harry had no complaints. He had been missing Padma severely over the past month or so, and although he didn’t know Aviary well, he was liking her more and more every time he talked to her.
“But I would try for you,” Harry promised as he moved down the line, realizing that his fellow Healers were not eager to wait for Harry to chat with Lacey while they were hungry and on a time crunch.
Hermione stared at him for a moment. He tried to read her expression. She looked sad, worried. Not what he was necessarily expecting.
“And the other day,” Malfoy continued, eyes bright, “He walked around the entrance to St. Mungos for a couple hours. I can guarantee there's a fat chance he was just window shopping in a rundown part of a muggle area just outside Mungos.”
“Are you kidding me?” Harry shouted, “How is that relevant! I never cheated, and I’ve been dealing with tons more than you!”
Harry froze. The words divorce and unhappiness seemed so harsh paired together. The situation was becoming real, tangent. What else could Ginny have been hiding, despite the fact that she had clearly been contemplating these things for months?
Harry rushed out into the front yard, relieved to see most of the kids had congregated to the back of the house. He quickly clicked the answer bottom.
“Nothing, Luna,” Harry responded, harsher than he had anticipated. Even Lily gave him a worried look. Luna peered at him for a moment and then turned to talk to Neville, who was on the other side of her. Harry sighed and forced himself to watch the match. That was what he was here for, anyway.
Harry hadn’t been in Grimmauld Place for years, and it showed. As the three of them walked into the ancient Black house, they encountered coatings of dust and a thick musty smell that consumed the surrounding air. After the war, Harry had taken care of the house for years. He and Ginny agreed they did not want to live there under any circumstances, but they did consider turning it into a place to stay or hold parties. It did have an ideal location, being in the city of London itself. But after a couple years of routine cleaning, both Harry and Ginny had gotten so busy that they had slowly neglected the house. This was now in Harry’s favor, as the remaining members of the Order of the Phoenix, as well as all the Weasley kids and himself, were the only ones who could access the house as secret keepers.
“Get. The fuck. Out,” Draco’s voice rang out through the room, sending chills down Harry’s spine as he apparated to his home.
Harry nodded, “Yes, okay. I should have started with that. Ginny and I talked on Christmas Eve and decided that we both were unhappy. She also told me that she had cheated on me with Blaise.”
To his surprise, Remmins was standing by the street in front of the old and abandoned phone booth, a secret Ministry entrance.
Lily was now wailing. Harry watched as Albus reached out to comfort her, even though tears were in his own eyes. Harry couldn’t believe any of this was happening. How did James know anything about Draco?
Ron shook his head, his eyes locked on Hermione. Harry looked around desperately and spotted Dean, who was arguing with Seamus.
“As in he didn’t actually take any?” Harry asked, “And he was forced to say whatever the caster wanted him to?”
He then turned back to Draco, where two new victims had arrived, being supported by Padma and Aviary.
The inside of Seb’s apartment was, well, exactly how one would picture it to be. The colors were bright and brought a cheerfulness that Harry needed. It was almost able to distract Harry from the gnawing anger and sadness inside him. He felt terrible about Blaise, and how upset it had made Ginny, but he also felt angry at her for kicking him out and taking him away from his kids. Harry knew she wouldn’t keep him away from them for long, and he knew it was much too soon to demand to see them, but he felt terrible thinking about what they must be thinking. They were already so upset about the divorce; how would they react when their dad didn’t come home tonight? Ginny had also left him with little options, as now his whole family and friends had heard about the fight he and Ginny had held in front of many witnesses at the hospital. The Prophet had covered it mere hours later. Even though it wouldn’t be out until tomorrow’s issue, everyone already knew that Harry and Ginny Potter- Weasley were getting a divorce. And that Harry was potentially gay. And that he was friends with Draco Malfoy.
“Weasley clan and company,” Healer Patrick commands the room with her voice, “I know you all want to give Hermione your love, but she is not fit to have this many visitors at this time. I thought Dean told you?”
“Draco…” Harry started, half wondering how Draco carried all these books into the room. Only half of the lot was crushing his lap. He tried not to think of the implications that came with this strength.
Harry reached over to give Remmins a hug. Remmins stiffened; Harry wasn’t sure they had ever been close enough to hug in their time together as Aurors. But then Remmins fell into the hug, sobbing loudly into his shoulder. Harry let him. When he was an Auror, sometimes all he wanted was for someone to hold him close and remind him there was still some good in the world.
“No,” Aviary said firmly, holding onto Harry’s arm, “We can’t think like that. Not now. Draco knows what he is doing. I have the feeling he always does. He will be fine.”
“Calm down, Seamus,” Harry looked at him in surprise, “I’m beginning to think you actually have a crush on Blaise. If you’re having an affair with him as well, now’s the time to say.”
Harry began to look around for either Astoria or Malfoy, wondering who had taken Scorpius to the park.
“Well, I hope that works out. It’s an important thing, preventing prats like him from skating by,” Harry directed his words to Draco, trying to convey he felt this could be more than a fluff piece.
“Fuck that, Harry,” Aviary said, sitting down beside him. Harry looked at her in surprise. He had never heard her talk like that, “Be upset all you want. The man you like is continually putting himself in danger. I can relate.”
“Definitely,” Draco insisted, “Harry, the Ministry is huge. Not everyone there has dropped the wizard first mentality just because Voldemort is gone. Honestly, it would be a perfect cover for someone in Kareach. Make the public believe you are working for a government that values muggle wizard equality while secretary harbor bigoted views.”
Angelina rolled her eyes, “George, I’m going to say this once. Drink as much as you like, but I am not accountable for whatever happens at the store tomorrow when you are hungover and bloody exhausted.”
Draco released his arm as soon as they were inside and began to look around. Aviary held on tightly, her eyes closed as she breathed tightly.
Harry nodded, trying to suppress his surprise at this statement. The young woman Ida and Savant had agreed upon as her new partner seemed to be nothing like the imposing and commanding woman standing next to him. Her name was Aviary Jackmason, and she was a small and petite woman who, while being beyond passionate with her love for her new job, lacked a certain grit Harry associated with every Auror he had ever met.
To break the silence, Harry asked, “Do you think they choose the hospital because of you? Because you were there?”
He looked at Malfoy expectantly and anxiously, waiting for him to reveal what could be good or bad news about their investigation. Malfoy, however, looked a little confused as he pulled his jacket a little tighter against the cold early winter day.
“And you act as if she will be all alone,” Arthur cut in, feigning mock offense, “I am capable of helping, you know.”
“I’m not worried,” Al snapped, glaring at his brother, “I just don’t think he should threaten me and then get our little sister on board.”
“Fuck you, Malfoy,” Harry hung up the phone and threw it at the wall. He watched as the phone collided with the bright yellow walls and exploded, the pieces scattering across the floor.
“Yes, yes, I’ve heard all of that,” James said, “What I really need to hear is why you would accuse her new boyfriend of killing a bunch of people if you aren’t upset with her.”
“Well, you have to admire the courage,” Harry quipped, “Not many people are able to call their own grandmother a naked mole rat. He was probably trying to get that off his chest for years.”
“Harry,” Padma admonished softly as she pulled away, “Don’t you dare blame yourself. I know what you’re thinking, but you did all you could when fifty killing curses were being fired at you. Both you and Draco performed courageously. There’s nothing any of us could have done.”
So when Harry walked back into the living room, where Ginny was sitting silently on the couch, he decided he would not tell her. Not now, maybe not ever. Their family deserved that.
“I was at Sunday lunch at the Burrow, for goodness’s sake! I had to make up some excuse and leave my entire family! I can’t just drop everything whenever you need to talk!” Harry spat at Malfoy, ignoring the growing anger present in the pale face he was screaming at.
Harry looked up at Draco and ignored the prickly sensation forming in his stomach, “It’s just us, then.”
“I did not tell them that,” Harry emphasized, “James may have overheard Ginny on the phone with Blaise once talking about how things had… sort of happened between us and he jumped to conclusions.”
Harry looked around. There was no use fighting it, his friends weren’t going to let him get out of this one. He began to scour the room for subjectively attractive blokes. Multiple times he thought he saw a winner, but then he would notice someone more appealing only a second later. Harry anxiously noticed the girls were stealing strange glances. Was he taking too long to pick? What were they thinking? He quickly pointed at the back of a bloke wearing a stylish gray jumper and a beanie. From the back he looked young, and well, fit, so Harry assumed he would be a good choice.
“Because I heard you,” James explained, his voice much quieter than before. Harry knew he hadn’t expected Ron to get physical, “When you were floo calling the other day. You were saying that Harry was in love with Mr. Malfoy.”
Draco let out a small snort, “I didn’t really need the rundown of their whole professional relationship, but I’m sold. We can tell Padma and Ron.”
“Hullo, everybody,” Harry smiled as he crossed the room to give Molly a hug. After she released him and he listened to a  round of her usual anxious reminders of how thin he looked, Harry went to grab a knife by a large pile of carrots clearly waiting for him. He handed a second knife to James, who himself had just left a hug from Molly and began to cut using his wand as Fleur veered into a new tangent about Dominique's new ambition to be a quidditch player when she grew up. Louis, who was cutting potatoes next to James and Harry, leaned over to whisper, “She’s already told this story more times then I can count. Dom’s never even been on a broom for more than twenty seconds!”
“I work in the same building as Seamus Finnigan,” Ida responded simply, “It was only a matter of time.”
“Might as well tell them everything, don’t you think?,” she smirked, putting a hand on his shoulder, “It’s only fair to let them know everything, before we kill them? Makes the pain even worse to know the fate of their friends and family, am I right, my dear pinsan?”
Ida nodded, “Yes. And he’s not the man you think he is. After refusing veritaserum, we found a significant reason for him to take it and discovered that he has orchestrated every attack.”
She turned now towards Draco again. The entire top of his shirt was drenched in blood. Strands of his blond hair were soaked in blood, plastered to his face. Harry was looking at him, alive for the last time. It occurred to him that Draco’s son would never see his father again. He would never see Draco with the smile he reserves for people he really cares about, where his whole face lit up. And Harry’s kids. They would never get another hug from their father. They would never get to hear him say again how much he loves them, how he would do anything for them. Harry would never get to watch them grow up, find love of their own. He would never hear James’s bright laugh, see Albus’s focused expression whenever he worked on something difficult or see Lily’s smile light up a room. But above everything, he would never get to make a new family. One where Draco, Lily, James, Scorpius and Albus all belonged to him. Where they all belonged to each other. It wasn’t until this moment that he realized how badly he wanted that. A future where everything felt right. Instead, he was in a barren room, watching all of that disappear before his eyes.
