he reasoned with himself. But he didn't need to think about Americans' use of trunks or not, because he. was. not. going!
He half expected Potter to push him away. Hex him or curse him out until he was far too upset to even attempt to comfort the wizard, but that was far from the truth. Instead, Harry had tapped the spot next to him and moved over a bit, as if welcoming Draco into the makeshift fort of shadows.
"Well, it's just... The marauders. My parents, Sirius, Lupin. Bloody Peter Pettigrew. Even, even Snape. They were like, the original six, you know?
It was a horrid thought really, but one that had recently taken to impeding upon his mind. Much to his disapproval, of course. But what could he do, he didn’t understand the brain. That was Hermione’s thing.
Why couldn't the pale boy just say "Yes," or "No?"
"What were you implying then, Parkinson?"
Unfortunately though, upon reaching the tower of the eighth year common room, he heard shouts of “Huffles call first room for the boys!” before seeing twelve or so wizards start to sprint for the door. The “door” of the Eighth year common room wasn’t really a door at all, it was a solid wall that, upon being touched by the right hand of an Eighth year, became a portal to the other side. IWith a bit of embarrassment, Draco could say that it was easily one of the coolest things about Hogwarts.
On the upside, his dorm room was closer to the exit, he’d be able to make a quick and easy getaway if need be. That in itself was quite reassuring. He was almost to the staircase when he locked eyes with Ava Winsbury, the only other Slytherin in the common room. His heart sank into his stomach when she smiled and gave him a small wave, she had
He was so emotionally distraught that he looked sick, and God knows he mental state was far from healthy. "But I'd have to go with
“I’m happy you think so. I hope you’ll be happy to hear that I’ve gotten my hands on a large amount of cameras. My mum sent them to me you see,” Professor Wilson took what Draco could only assume was a camera out of one of his many desk drawers and handed it to him. “Not today, but I plan on showing the lot of you to use them.”
"Oh I know, I know," Molly said, batting her daughter with a newspaper.
Draco stared at the source of the voice angrily, but he couldn’t do a thing about it, it’d draw too much unwanted attention. “I’ve spoken to McGonagall,” This boy seemed familiar, but he didn’t remember who he was. Perhaps a Hufflepuff, but it was possible he was a Ravenclaw.
Draco was very strict in the way he did things, everything he did must be perfect.
"It might give us a chance at redemption." He answered shortly.
He sat on the white couch and looked around, waiting for Narcissa to give him the okay to speak.
at legimens.
He stood at the Eighth year common room entrance, heaved over in an attempt to catch his breath. He found himself wishing that apparation was allowed, it would be ever so much easier to maneuver around the castle without feeling like you were about to bust a lung open that way. It took him way too long to fully return to his normal self, but when he did, he heard a sharp “
“I-” He tried again, but Harry seemed to have a habit of interrupting.
“Sorry mate, didn’t mean to run into you! Haven’t got my glasses on is all!” And just like that, Potter was walking down the stairs, away from Draco without even a sneer in his direction. He heard a faint yelp, and assumed the boy  had tripped.
“How do you know what a Muggle classroom looks like?” Draco asked after a bit of an awkward silence. The professor smiled.
Harry Potter didn’t cry, but November 3rd, 1998, he sobbed for the parents he had never gotten to know, the godfather who had barely lived before he passed, the uncle that never got to see his son’s first steps, and all of the children that had died because Harry Potter was the chosen one.
P.S. Omg I almost forgot! As a Christmas present (and again, if you don't celebrate, a normal gift instead) I bestow upon you, the very small and very short Draco Malfoy playlist designed to help me work on this fic. I do hope you like that too, and if you have any ideas on songs I can ask, you can comment or message me on either Tumblr (@drarryismyshit07) or Discord (DrarryIsMyShit#6083)
Did that mean the room he’d found had more secret doors he hadn’t noticed? Did it mean that everyone would be going in and out of the first room, just to make it to the others? Had choosing the first room been a good choice? He hadn’t known there were more rooms when he’d first chosen of course, but after finding the second one, wouldn’t it have made sense to move farther back?
and now, knowing that there were more like Pride and Prejudice only made him happier to read them. The muggles were good at one thing, that was for sure. Telling a good story. No gruesome deaths and horribly ugly goblins. Just stories of family and love and fun. That was what he wanted to read, probably what he needed as well. “Little Women, Tom Sawyer, Three Musketeers. Stories of adventure and becoming. Truly wonderful.
Luna nodded her head in agreement while Ginny just shook her head. "Are you no longer close with him, Weasley?" Draco asked in a half-hearted attempt at conversation.
Draco began to dive into his meal, leaving Harry with nothing to do and no one to talk to. Harry had a half a mind to comment on his seemingly excessive eating habits, what with him shoveling mountains of breakfast food into his mouth at one time. Occasionally, he'd stop, but only to take a swig of pumpkin juice before going back to stuffing his face.
“I’m not,” he whispered out after a few moments of silence, in which his thoughts had mixed themselves with the quiet murmur of the Eighth year common room. “I’m
“I’m so tired of everything, and I wish-”
She stood from her place and smiled down on Harry before walking towards the stairs. "Even if it's every night for dinner."
“Well, we were fine yesterday.” Harry offered, as if that would help. Draco thought that someone as privileged as Harry, someone as unburdened by the war as the Golden Gryffindor, would surely notice the idiocy in his words, seeing as there couldn’t possibly be anything else to worry about, but apparently not. “And now,
*hands more tissues*
-----
However, things had changed that Friday, because Harry had taken the extra mile to ask Draco for Potions work help, and begrudgingly as well as cautiously, as if Potter would spontaneously decide to hex him into oblivion, Draco agreed to explain how to apply the ingredients to the potion Potter needed help brewing.
"Just-" he took in a deep breath. "Just don't question me. It's rather annoying."
eighth years returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and of those eighty-eight, quite a few were males.
Before he could stop himself, he was in his bedroom and grabbing a small, unnecessary coin and transfiguring it into a beautiful ring box. Yes, one you'd give to a significant other during a proposal.
"Draco. Draco. Draco."
"Oh yeah, she took me Nargle hunting a few months ago. She's been helping me... reconnect with friends from school. Non-slytherin friends."
He couldn’t bother to actually work on the tasks he’d been assigned by his professors, but he felt obligated to at least have them with him, as if their presence would encourage him to finish them up. Of course, that mindset didn’t actually work, but the sentiment was nice.
He choked in the eggs in his mouth and slammed his back against the chair. "Luna!" He quickly quieted himself down again, because everyone was staring at him. Slowly, their conversations started back up again.
“What do you reckon is wrong with Harry?” Neville asked. There was a silence amongst the table and Draco focused on the gradual sound of the Great Hall returning to its usual noise level, the buzz of conversation sounding more quiet than silence itself.
Hermione was the first to speak.
Another sip, another breath. "And I was thinking, maybe I've extended my stay here." Narcissa smiled at that, shaking her head slightly but allowing Harry to continue his anxiety-filled explanation.
"Well, first off," Harry began, "my name is
It seemed Draco was on the right track, having taken the class without persuasion from the outside pressure. But he was also probably an idiot, because he shouldn’t be going

indeed make him happy, happier than anyone ever had before.
“And he died around that time two years later,” Draco added, rather unhelpfully, seeing as everyone knew when Sirius Black died by then. What was once a topic people insisted on being a ministry secret was now a known fact, as was everything surrounding Harry Potter’s life. And why would it not, when the boy was the most important wizard in the entire magical world?
Of course, he didn’t listen to the sign. It was merely his nature.
Draco rose to his feet with all of the others, wincing at the loudness of it all.
"May I come in, Draco?" He was wrong. Harry Potter's voice wasn't strong and steady. It was timid and shaky and afraid. For what, he did not know. He was just grateful for the opportunity to not further embarrass himself in front of the Potter boy.
You idiotic fool! His mouth couldn't salivate. No matter how many times he licked his lips, swallowed what little spit resided inside. Maybe I should stop, it only makes it leave faster.
“How are you
“I was planning on assigning some for the semester as well, though it seems you’ve already begun.” Draco,
"That makes sense. Is that all though? Where does Draco come in." She asked, "Malfoy." She added after looking at Ron's annoyed face.
"So you just threw water on him?" Harry flinched at the screams coming from the girl in front of him. The woman, we're all adults now.
"So, Mrs. Weasley?" Harry started in a subtle, desperate attempt to make small talk and distract himself from the looming feeling of disregard from one of the people he felt he needed attention from the most. "How is, uh. How's George?"
Pulling into the driveway, Harry tried his best to calm himself down. It was quite difficult, seeing as he’d gone nearly a year without having to do so without assistance.
"No! I don't wanna hear mine." Hermione gave him another fierce look and he was silenced.
Draco thought back to  Sunday of that week, when he and Harry had left the dorms to get the seats near the fire before the students came back from the Halloween feast. They’d shared what seemed like two tons of Muggle Halloween candy, gorging on the sweets until they were so utterly stuffed it felt as though their stomachs would burst open at any moment.
“This year is a new leaf for the Wizarding World, not just our students. This year, we can

say that Hogwarts, as well as the Wizarding World, is a safe place once again. This is thanks to the lives of nearly
"Right, sorry." Harry said, his attention reluctantly going back to his tea and his book.
A cold sensation poured over him, drenching every part of him. He shook his head and his eyes popped open. The man in front of him held a glass in front of his face. His eyes stared into his, and his hand held his.
Right?
"Harry, dear!"
"What were you doing all night?" Surely he wasn't just laying there, right?
book give anyone? But, it was still a nice feeling,
The wands of Harry Potter, Ginevra Weasley, Luna Lovegood, Hannah Abbott, Neville Longbottom, Hermione Granger, and Ronald Weasley were clutched in his hands soon after his command.
He nodded, a tear falling from his cheek. He wiped it away slyly, but Luna had seen his arm rise and fall. "She knows, you know." Her hand stroked his hair, she was probably the only person in human history that was allowed to do so. "She knows."
Over time, Draco had come to realize that Harry Potter had a sort of “hero syndrome” as he enjoyed calling it. Something that told him, even without the face of immediate danger, he had to save someone. He had to be the bigger man and risk his life, his peace, or his health for someone else. Someone, anyone. It didn’t matter if they were undeserving or the sweetest person on earth. Harry Potter’s hero complex - which he’d later realized was the true name for such feelings, and had been quickly overjoyed that he hadn’t made up some random mentality scheme on the spot as a way to excuse Potter’s actions towards him - overtook the wizards body. Controlled it, even.
"So much, Mother."
"No father, no. I promise. I wouldn't go against you. I swear! I haven't wronged you yet, Father!"
“Honestly mate, Harry’ll do.”
His evenings were filled with long winded talks with the Bloody Baron, who seemed to know a great deal about the goings-on of young Salazar Slytherin, although Draco soon realized that the time lines didn’t quite add up. Nevertheless, listening to something other than his own thoughts seemed like a major step in the correct direction, and he didn’t mind the tall tales as they distracted him from his own painful lies.
“Apparently, I watched her die. “ Harry paused, letting that fact sink in. He had watched his mum die, and he hadn’t been able to do anything about it. Granted, he was a baby, but the idea that his mother was dying right in front of him hurt more than he had anticipated.
"I'm failing to see your point," Luna said calmly, although Draco was standing up tall and frantic.
Minerva nodded and flicked her wand, a quill and parchment flew up next to the table. The quill began to scribble and she faced Draco once again. “We have a wonderful new
, as unrelated and unimportant as the topic was, was enough to make his head twist in turn in painful directions.
Harry’s voice was rather calm, though
His hand rested on the door knob. He looked around his room praying that it was clean enough for a guest to come in. A guest that wasn't his mother or adopted brother. A guest that wasn't Pansy through floo powder or Blaise through a quick apparation meet up.
"I had a theory. I dunno. I just think I should go off it."
Harry didn’t understand.
Stupid, arrogant boy! His eyes began to water as his back hit a wall. Teddy's seat floated towards him and he was grateful. Grateful that he wouldn't have to reach out for him, grateful that his father couldn't hurt him.
He followed the crowd, stumbling into the Dining Hall. He was pushed every which way, and he had half a mind to defend himself, but he quickly saw that everyone else was sharing the experience. People were laughing and smiling, waving to friends and saying their “goodbyes” to family. There was no point in causing a scene, when his only focus was not being noticed.
Draco started pacing again, twiddling his hands, but Harry noticed he had not touched his wand or brought it out at all.
"We have to figure it out! Father absolutely cannot know," Malfoy said urgently, moving for the first time as he took a step towards Harry. Harry felt stress and anxiety flare up inside of him again as Malfoy worriedly chewed on his lip and began quickly cracking his knuckles.
“Oh, all right,” Pansy said squinting at him but packing up her things. Vince and Greg whistled at them and Draco rolled his eyes.
Draco was making his way  across the grounds to his seat with Pansy and Theo on either side of him. He, Harry, and Hermione had been up until two in the morning practicing Summoning Spells in the abandoned classroom. It was the only way Harry would be able to get his broom to the task. Harry had finally seemed to get the hang of it before they called it, but Draco was still terrified something would go wrong. The only thing helping him from completely losing it was the evidence that Harry did extraordinary feats of magic when he was stressed out or running on adrenaline, which he no doubt would be when faced with a mother dragon.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You are dismissed,” Severus intoned, and Draco got to his feet, packing up as slowly as possible. His plan worked as Harry left the room flanked by the rest of the Trio, ahead of him. Draco waited until they were out in the corridor before pointing his wand at Harry’s bag and casting his spell.
Draco looked back to Harry, cracking his neck and fingers of his left hand as he did. Harry was staring up at the ceiling through his glasses, his emotions contemplative.
“No promises,” Harry laughed before following Sirius from the Shack.
“What is going on? Where are you going?”
Okay guys, I am deeply sorry for the late update. Technically it's still Thursday for me, but only barely. I was going through the chapter and was just not pleased with it. I ended up reworking the entire thing, but at least I'm pleased with it now. This is my longest update yet, so take that as an apology gift. This chapter was really really tough for me, I hope it still came out okay.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Fucking Longbottom!” Draco hissed realizing that this was exactly what he had needed.
Draco closed his eyes to the soothing feeling of Harry lightly tracing his mark.
“Oh you two are absolutely unbearable. Merlin Draco I’m glad to see you happy but this is just downright sickening,” Pansy complained and Draco stuck his tongue out at her.
"Thank you," Harry forced a smile and Draco kissed his forehead again. Most of the blood had washed away from his scar, but Draco veered slightly to the right to avoid getting blood on his lips.
“May I have a word?” He asked and Draco hesitantly got to his feet.
“You know I’m always a sucker for some sweets,” Ginny grinned, adding some chocolate frogs to her basket. “Ron’s stash was empty last I checked.”
Harry couldn’t believe his luck, now all he had to do was sneak his way out of the Common Room. He carefully left his room and crept back down the steps. He tiptoed past Ron and Hermione, who were arguing about something or other, and made his way to the portrait hole. It only took a few minutes before a 5th year pushed their way through and Harry was able to sneak out.
Love,
“How is Mother?” Draco asked as their drinks were set down in front of them. His Father had ordered a dark whiskey for himself and a Butterbeer for Draco.
“Draco is very bright. He and Hermione were at the top of every class. He knows you’re either with Harry or against him in this war.”
"You have me there," Draco agreed.
“Draco and I have practically always been able to feel each other’s emotions and pain.”
I know everyone seems to be taking Draco and Harry's bond pretty easily right now, but there isn't really another alternative. They barely know what to do with Harry let alone Draco, also Hermione's approval is another massive part of things. We will see more aftermath of that the following chapter.
“Hey, let’s give them something else to talk about.” Draco whispered in his ear. Harry glanced at him quizzically. “Something bigger than this,” Draco swung their joined hands a bit.
“I know what you mean,” Draco agreed, his mind briefly wandering to the pile of letters slowly amassing in his trunk. Draco forced himself to not become preoccupied by them and refocused on the green eyes staring down at him at that moment. “But in my completely unbiased opinion, Weasley wasn’t exactly the best of mates to you this year either. He deserves to be ignored for a bit.”
A few moments later the fire changed colour again, Dumbledore caught the slip of fancy paper, “The Beauxbatons’ champion is Fleur Delacour!” An absolutely gorgeous girl got up from the sea of powder blue uniforms and practically floated from the hall. Draco had the distinct impression she was part Veela.
Theo snorted, “Oh mate, I’ve known about your obsession with Potter since first year.”
“What?”
“Yeah, imagine,” Harry agreed, the anxiety coming through the bond significantly lessened.
“I hardly think that is the answer, the people would never agree to something -” Fudge fumbled.
He cleansed the goblet and dagger of his blood and the hairs and stowed them in the bag he had brought with him. They were his now. Draco glanced around the study, but decided it was better if Lucius wasn’t aware of what had happened today. He quickly duplicated the artefacts and left the decoy where the original had once been. If Lucius thought to check he would instantly know it was a decoy, but Draco was confident. He wouldn’t think to check on the artefact, he barely paid attention to any of his Head of House duties. Once upon a time he may have felt the loss of status, but Lucius was not in tune with the lines at all. Draco threw the Cloak over himself and exited the study, reapplying the wards as he went. Next, he made his way to the dungeons. He had sworn to fix the balance and he intended to start at that moment. He continued down the flights of stairs and corridors until he got to the very base of the Manor. Draco reached out to the lines again and saw them rise up around him, bright as day. The lines all overlapped on the stone in front of him.
“Lovely!” Luna said, a bright smile crossing her face, almost seeming like it twinkled to Harry. Luna reached forward and gently took Ginny’s hand, looking straight into Ginny’s eyes as she did. Ginny gasped loudly and Harry watched as colour blossomed across the back of Ginny’s hand and presumably continued up her arm which was covered in her sweater.
“I don’t even know what spell I cast; I just knew what I had to do and knew I had to do it quickly. I felt how scared you were, I had to fix it. I didn’t use my wand,” Harry shrugged. “I just grabbed your shirt, threw the Cloak on, and hoped for the best.”
Draco sighed, like he didn’t have enough to worry about.
When their breathing had finally gone back to normal and they lay on the floor of the classroom in a puddle of transfigured blankets and pillows, Draco grasped Harry’s hand in his.
“I wonder what he did,” Harry forced out.
“It’s theorized that the larger a mark the more powerful the bond between the two people is. The more it is capable of. For instance, the marks my husband and I have are on the smaller side. It took quite awhile for us to be able to sense one another’s emotions, and even now we can only send very simple messages to each other when we’re apart. The marks the two of you have are quite large, I imagine you share your emotions quite easily. However, this is all theory. Just because a mark is small does not mean it is inconsequential, there are exceptions to every rule.”
“Yes, my soul-mate, Harry Potter. I heard you saying things that I believe my barrister would definitely consider as defamation of character. I must have misheard though; an upstanding wizard such as yourself would never stoop so low.”
If Harry could have screamed he would. His whole body felt like it was on fire, like every nerve ending was being bathed in acid. Harry had thought that the pain he felt the night Draco suffered from the rejection sickness had been bad, that was a walk in the park compared to this.  Even feeling it second-hand did not compare at all to the real thing. For a moment, Harry was filled with rage towards Lucius. How could he knowingly cause this pain on his only child? Just as quickly as it started, it ended and Harry was brought out of his thoughts. Harry felt his cheek collide with the ground as he was dropped. Harry dimly noticed thuds and the sound of footsteps receding when warm hands flipped him over.
Harry bit his lip, looking conflicted. Draco couldn't hold in a laugh, endeared by the fact that Harry knew how much he hated looking sloppy.
Harry let out a breath, “It’s fine. It’s just a rough subject. Anyways, we have to get you back to your Common Room. We’ll both fit under the cloak, but you’ll have to stick close to me. And be silent, the cloak doesn’t cover any noise.”
“Welsh Green, Chinese Fireball, Swedish Short-Snout, and a Hungarian Horntail,” Draco said immediately, ignoring Harry’s jab.
Draco suspected he was commenting on the overwhelming urge to grab onto Harry and never let go. It was like every fibre of his being was screaming at him to never ever get further than three inches from the wizard. Draco couldn’t wrap his mind around the fact that he had gone from absolutely loathing the sight of Potter to being wrapped up in his arms and loving every second; although if Draco was truthful with himself he had never truly loathed Harry, not really.
“Oh Luna! Yes of course! Everyone this is Luna Lovegood, she’s in my year and obviously Ravenclaw,” Ginny said squeezing closer to Harry to make room for Luna to sit on her other side.
“I’d lose them all for him! My real friends already know, and for those that don’t – if they turn against me for this, then I cannot trust them! As for my family, I hope Mother will at the very least understand my choice. I do not care what Lucius thinks. I am tired of being told to lead by a man who grovels at a Master’s boots. Harry is one of the first people to show me a life without pain or constant performance. I can be myself with him. That is worth it. Voldemort will lose and I do not pick losing sides,” Draco declared fiercely.
“I obviously cannot tell you what to do, but I would deeply appreciate it if you did not.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Please tell me you picked a fight with a Gryffindor yesterday.”
Harry grinned, quickly buttoning his shirt again and picking his tie up of the floor, slinging it around his shoulders.
“Shut it you, you have no room to talk,” Harry hissed at her. She stuck her tongue out at him.
“You like girls?” Ron burst and Harry couldn’t keep himself from snorting into his pumpkin juice.
Harry decided Hermione really was a quite amazing person, and she didn’t get nearly enough credit for it.
Draco says "I speak French" and then "You like that?" at least that's what Google says. Sorry if I'm butchering things I don't speak a lick of French.
“What is it you’re looking for?”
Harry refrained from commenting on the other injury he hadn’t known about. Harry felt like every nerve in his body was on fire. He wasn’t sure if those were his feelings or Malfoy’s.
Harry tried to relax as much as he could; there was no use worrying over it. He wouldn’t see Malfoy again until September 1st. He might as well enjoy the last few days of summer hols. He just wished he could talk this out with Ron and Hermione, but there was absolutely no way he could do that before figuring out where he stood with Malfoy.
Harry whipped around; he had taken to facing away from the Slytherin table, temptation and all that. Parkinson was practically in Draco’s lap, giggling loudly, and his arm was around her as they ate their breakfast. Harry immediately felt a stab of pain in his chest, had Draco been that ashamed about what they did? Draco’s eyes cut across the Hall to focus on him, narrowing slightly; his hand drifted slowly up to press against the junction between his shoulder and neck, and then brushed his chest. Even through the fabric, Harry could feel the warmth as it blossomed on his chest; he had also felt the ache in his shoulder as Draco had pressed on the bruises.  Their bond was getting much stronger.
The halls were relatively empty with it being so close to curfew, Harry made his way from Gryffindor Tower to the dungeons, checking the map along the way to make sure he didn’t run into anyone and that Malfoy hadn’t returned to his Common Room.
“Word’s out that Harry Potter can resist the Imperius Curse,” Draco commented, finally looking up from his work station. Harry had hopped up to sit on a vacant work table and was staring over at him, he shrugged.
“Hey you,” Harry called as he entered and was rewarded with one of Draco’s relaxed smiles.
“Yes, but our souls weren’t quite ready yet. I had hoped they would be by my birthday and sure enough they were! I’m so glad,” Luna gripped her hand tightly and turned towards the table, fixing herself breakfast.
The Ball started to wind down and Pansy loudly called for Draco to escort her back to the Common Room, Draco was thankful for the out and bid his goodbyes to everyone before escorting Pansy from the Hall.
Draco felt what he had determined to be jealousy floating through the bond and he couldn’t help but smirk. Harry did seem to get considerably jealous over his relationship with Pansy, which was extra hilarious to Draco since he had been friends with Pansy since they were in nappies and the last thing he wanted to do was be in a relationship with her. There was also the small bit where his soul-mate was a man, but that apparently wasn’t glaring enough for Harry to comprehend. Draco was beginning to understand that he pretty much had to slap the plain facts across Harry’s face before he would grasp it. Merlin his soul-mate was so brilliant and also so fucking thick.
“I think it was positively barbaric what Moody did in class,” Hermione said gently.
Anyways, they said 'I love you'! I hope I did the moment justice. Lemme know what ya think!
That was painful to write. Poor Harry. We also get a look into Theo's mind which was actually super fun to write. Next chapter is one of my favorites so far. We get to see Draco again, it has been far too long for my tastes since we've been in Draco's head. We're skipping time a little, which means we're getting quite close to the end *gasp*
“Morning Draco, how was –” Theo blanched as his eyes landed on Draco’s face.
Pansy glanced around once more and began to spell cosier decorations. “How have you not transfigured a fucking couch? Do you enjoy rolling around on the floor?”
“Oi, Weasleys,” Draco called and their gazes whipped upward, faces darkening when they realized who called for them.
“I wasn’t sure if you were expecting it to be more of a platonic bond,” Harry shrugged, eyes fixed to the floor.
Wow, back to a last name basis, well not on my watch.
(12:03am)
Harry grabs onto the sleeve of Draco’s black coat. He lets go suddenly, hoping he didn’t scare Draco off.
“Potter there is something I want to tell you,” he says softly.”
Draco and I, man.. we were together, we really were for at least two years. Until, we had a huge fight and I can barely remember what it’s about now, but for some reason it drove us apart. We called each-other cruel names and said rude remarks and he just packed his bags and left. For the first few days I was happy as hell he was gone but now, five months later, I feel like I can’t live anymore. A piece of my soul is with him. A piece that I can’t live without. I need him, so much. What if I say something, and he doesn’t want me back? What if he’s moved on? What if he’s waiting for me?? What if he’s not? I ask myself these questions EVERYDAY. It’s to the point where I feel like I’m going insane. I barely eat, and all I do is drink. Ron and Hermione have tried to talk and help me, but I’ve blown them off so much that I haven’t seen them in about a month? I feel so isolated and it’s all my fault..
Draco wasn’t sure who this was since he couldn’t see him.
I receive Draco's last text and smile to myself. Yes, I'll admit I have or had a crush on Draco or maybe I just thought he was good-looking who knows. I mean he is pretty but we were "enemies" but I liked him. I don't know, I'm just confusing myself now.
“That is true, very true. Guess we’ll have to see about that then?”
I can feel myself getting flustered due to the awkward tension amongst us.
“Then tell me Draco,” Harry says with a smile.
After late night texting Draco, the nerves still settled in my stomach. Today I’d be sitting down with Draco, for who knows how long, to try and get to know him better. I never really hated him, but I don’t think he knows that or maybe he does?
He groans out loud. “Yes don’t remind me. I was a downright git in school as everyone knows, but if you want me to call you by your name then you’re gonna have to make the first move.”
“Oh my god, Draco I’m sorry if I made things worse, shit I’m a terrible pers–“
“Harry, have I ever told you how much I love you?”
His lips softly touch Draco’s and slowly mumbles,” I was just about to tell you the same thing Draco..”
“Uh, what a surprise. What are you doing here H-Potter.”
Soon he was yanked above water.
“It’s been quite nice. Haven’t been called a Death Eater in a while. Mother wants me to go back to the Manor since she’s lonely, but I can’t go back. It’s like..”
Draco walks towards Harry and sits in the seat right across from him. taking a bite of his tart, he eyes Harry suspiciously.
“Yes, I do. Here, i’ll give you my number then.” Draco grabs Harry’s phone and types in his number.
Draco turns around and faces him
Looking back at myself in May and my alcohol problem, I realize I’ve made the right choice going back to the man I love.
I’ve never felt better.
HATRED
We both stare at each other wondering who’s going to say it first. Of course it’s me. Rivalry never dies between us I suppose.
Hell Draco was glad the man couldn’t see him because if he did he’d probably hex him right then and there.
Draco shuffled around a bit, scared of what he might say, how he might react.
Harry goes in for a kiss… A glass shatters onto the floor, Molly.
“Let’s take this elsewhere shall we,” the man whispered into Draco’s ear causing him to shudder.
Instantly, he knew who he’s been kissing all night.
“Yes Draco, that you will.”
Harry was extremely bothered by the fact that people still considered Draco a Death Eater. Draco was FORCED into become one. He had no other choice, and Harry understood.
The man pulled Draco to the side near a wall in the club. He pushed Draco up against the wall and began kissing him ever so softly. Draco enjoyed the soft kisses, but he wanted more.
It was love.
so they apparated into a house.. a quite familiar house so it seemed.
. (12:04am)
“No, Draco wait.”
“So uh, how have you been? Do you like it here?”
“Potter I can practically hear you thinking,” he says.
Tonight he was trying to go 1:30.
Draco makes the first move and slowly pushes his lips into Harry’s. The kiss is soft and slow like they had all the time in the world.
Molly heads to the Floo and goes home.
My heart starts to beat a mile a minute. Why is it I feel like I can’t breathe whenever I’m around him, oh that’s right.. I’m in LOVE with him. I’ve never told him I loved him, and he’s never told me he loved me out of the 2 years we were together. I think it’s time..
Until, Draco couldn’t take it anymore.
“So, I cough nervously, what do you do now? Do you work around here? I’d ask where you live but I don’t want to seem we-“
“I suppose so,” he says while taking a sip from his steaming cup of coffee.
“Yea, it is weird, but we’ve grown up Malfoy. Like I’ve said before, I never hated you. Were you annoying at Hogwarts occasionally? Yes, one hundred percent. One of these times we’re going to have to call each other by our first names you know.”
“Erm, Malfoy, Hey” trying not to embarrass myself.
Draco’s eyeing Harry with amusement.
I hesitantly move closer and kiss him.
Draco slowly made his way over to Harry.
Enjoy!!
The wind ruffles slightly in the background with the sound of owls hooting in the distance.
“Fine, M-Draco. How is that? Better for you?” I laugh.
I walked in as Draco slowly shut the door.
Harry clears his throat and stares straight into Draco’s eyes. He gives him the erotic kiss, in front of EVERYONE.
“Yes Harry, a lot better.” Looking at his watch he gets up rather quickly.
As he slowed tracked the males fit, yet slender frame he stopped half way up his face.
He glanced up at me and threw a nod my way.
“Put a sock in it Malfoy, i’m here now aren’t I,” I awkwardly chuckle.
“Harry, I love you.. I love you too. God that took us forever to say didn’t it? And I could never move on, you know. You mean to much to me.”
(THIS STORY SUCKS GUYS IM SO SO SORRY, I love Molly, buuttt this was fun to write)
Was it the way he was built? Maybe, but a lot of guys are built this way.
Leaning towards the gentlemen he murmured, “are you here to show me a good time?”
He was aroused to the max and couldn’t stand the wait.
“Slow down, It’s fine really. To answer the numerous questions you threw at me, yes I do live around here, about 15 minutes away. Occasionally, I’ll help out at this bakery every couple weeks, but other than that, no job either.”
“Sorry for all the questions. Haven’t really talked to anyone lately. I live about 10 minutes away from here, so we’re somewhat close.” I live at Grimmauld place.”
“Why would I follow you after everything. I’ve lived here for the past couple months, I haven’t seen any wizards around either, so it’s weird to see you here too you know.”
, he thinks. Wanting to be friends with H-Potter all these years. Who knew it would be this easy. Draco has, yes he admits, HAD a crush on Harry throughout school, but he grew out of his meaningless crush towards Harry.
Just one night at the pool can change your life completely..
Draco’s breath was sounding more and more distant with every swayed movement they made towards one another.
Now here I am in muggle London. it’s quite nice that I can actually take a stroll or head to a coffee shop without being idolized. I don’t really work either since I have so much money in my vault it’s not like I need anymore.
Getting a closer look at him, he still looks thin as if he hasn’t eaten in weeks, his silver blonde hair drops mid neck, and he’s in all black. Typical.
Once all the eyes are on Molly, her face turns red. She is absolutely embarrassed.
“–you know they aren’t true. I never ever thought of you that way. I was just mad. It was pointless, and I hope you forgive me.”
“Listen, Draco. I have some things I want to tell you. First off, I’m sorry, so so sorry, for everything I did that night. For all the things I said to you–“
“Harry shut up. Just give me a couple minutes. I’m just shocked is all. In a good way.”
Harry was sitting in the common room staring up at the window.. Everyone else was finally asleep, so Harry was able to finally have some relaxation time all by himself. Harry really wanted to go to the pool tonight since he knows that barely anyone goes there especially at 12 in the morning. Harry quickly puts his dress-robes over his swim trunks. Harry tosses the invisibility cloak over himself and accidentally knocks down one of the frames on the wall. “shit,” he mumbles. He carefully looks around to make sure no one is out of bed. He soon sighs with relief and opens the door. It is his 8th year at hogwarts and it’s been a couple months since the war. Harry has lost so much, but still manages to get through the day. He barely sleeps much though with all the nightmares. Harry quietly goes outside of the school and creeps down to the pool area. “finally,” he sighs and walks towards the pool. Today has been a stressful day for Harry since Ginny keeps giving Harry hurtful glances. Harry and Ginny broke up 5 weeks ago, yet Ginny still can’t seem to get over Harry. He isn’t even sure that they were even in an official relationship anyways. It’s not like he didn’t like Ginny, but he never loved her not even once. Harry wasn’t even sure if he liked girls or anyone in that matter. As Harry was deep in his thoughts he slipped into the pool. He soon felt relief. As the warm water hit his cold body he sighed. As he was about to do some laps around the pool he soon heard someone cough. It was a tad bit foggy outside so he couldn’t see who was with him. “Hello, who else in here?,” he says in a demanding tone. He hears a chuckle and feel like he knows who it is. “It’s me Potter.” Harrys body suddenly goes rigid. He hasn’t seen malfoy since the war. Yeah, school just started but it was weird to finally see him again. As Draco moved towards Harry, Harry noticed how different Draco looked. It was a good different. His hair was still pale blond, but grew 2 inches and had a slight wave to it. Draco was thin, yet toned.
That made much more sense than the story the Ministry had settled on. “I’m sorry Harry,” Draco whispered, feeling the pain radiating off his soul-mate.
“Let’s do this then,” Harry grasped harder onto Draco’s hand. Intertwining their fingers tightly, with his other hand Harry anxiously messed up his hair before smushing it down over his forehead.
“Yup,” Harry popped the last letter, slightly pleased by the sheer irritation on Malfoy’s face. Malfoy sighed before glancing around and sitting down next to Harry. His fingers tracing paths in the mix of soil and sand, he was silent for awhile, waiting for Harry to speak.
“Should he survive the night, you should work on that. Can you estimate how far away he is?”
Harry rolled his eyes at him, and pulled Draco roughly against his chest. “Of course, you fucking can. I’m not furious with you, really, I’m just furius in general. I also don’t like it when people yell at me, I get sort of defensive.”
“Was being a hero that fucking important to you?” He sneered.
“Call even more attention to yourself, Weasley, why don’t you?” A sneering voice came from their right. Harry turned to see Malfoy leaning casually against a tree. He was glaring at the group of them.
(See the end of the chapter for
Find out on Thursday (or whenever you happen to read the next chapter once it's updated) Thank you once again for the amazing feedback. Yall are the bright spots of my days!
“I’ve been trained my whole life to always be perfectly put together, always say the perfect thing, be the perfect gentlemen. In just a few months you’ve completely undone me, Harry.”
"Why did I give Potter my number. He's going to blow my phone up every chance he can, I guarantee it"
“Why am I always running late to my own plans” I cursed out loud. I slammed the door behind me and headed towards Ivory’s bakery, a ten minute walk.
“Grimmauld place? I’ve heard my mother talk about that place before when I was younger. Is it alright if I visit there? Maybe there’s some things I can give to mother?”
I nod and sit by Draco.
Harry’s jaw drops.
The eyes.
Draco grabbed the mans hand and took him out to the dark lit alley.
He holds my hand, and I hold his.
He nods slowly and sits down on the couch. I motion towards the one across from his, but he stops me.
Draco glares at his phone and groans.
The room fell utterly quiet and no one knew what to say.
I begin to breathe heavily and I start to gain up the courage.
“No, Potter it’s fine stay. I’ll just try and stay out of your way. I was just trying to help you out,” he mumbles softly.
Harry and Draco invited the Weasley clan and a couple of friends over for an early Christmas dinner. Christmas was still a few days away, but since they wanted to spend time alone on Christmas, they decided to have the dinner early. Once everyone arrived, the conversations were flowing through the room effortlessly. The room smelt of pot roast, herbs, and a hint of cranberry. Everyone was smiling and laughing, but Draco felt this pang in his stomach. He knew that he had to be top notch since Molly was around. He felt as though his every move, touch, and glance was being watched. Draco has told Harry how he feels about Molly and how she hates him, yet Harry believes that everything is fine now. Draco still feels as though her eyes are daggers pushing through his insides. Draco was being overly polite to everyone. Right before Draco decides to head to the bathroom to freshen up and take a minute to breathe, Harry calls for a toast.
“I’ve had enough, I’m tired of this Harry. It has been months! Are you brainwashed or just delusional? Did you put a spell on Harry? Did you Draco?!” she was at her breaking point.
I throw on the quickest outfit while casting a tempus charm: 10:50am
“Draco, love, come on over here.”
“Hi Draco, this was a last minute plan. May I come in? I’d like to talk to you if you wouldn’t mind.”
Harry can feel Draco getting uncomfortable.
Hell, Draco didn’t even know who the person was but damn did he know how to move, and DAMN was he making Draco hard.
“I never thought you’d ask,” he laughed.
I silently smiled to myself because okay yes, Draco was coming to my place. We are both weirdly having a civil conversation with each other, but I feel like there’s some sort of topic we’re stepping over.
Molly’s mouth drops. Draco looks towards Ron and Hermione, and Ron’s face is filled with disgust towards his mother. Even Ron accepted Draco’s apology and learned to love them together. Hell, Draco and Ron laugh with one another constantly.
Draco briskly walks off and my heart has never pounded this fast.
I apparate in front of Draco’s house.
I laugh nervously.
“ I appreciate the apology Draco. Thank you. Now last thing I have to tell you. It’s pretty important and I’m not sure how you’re going to react. We were together for 2 years. The best years of my life. There was never a dull moment with you. Yeah, we’d bicker but I loved it and I know you did to. The times we’d cuddle, kiss, and spend every single moment together. I miss it. I miss it so much that I can’t stop thinking about it. Deep down inside, something I’ve realized over the past few months we’ve been apart is that I love you Draco. I truly love you. I can’t like without you and I’m sorry I couldn’t tell you that sooner. You mean to world to me and more. I’m not sure if you even feel the same, or if you’ve moved on already. I just had to let you know.”
“I- what, no? I swear no Ministry nothing of that.”
“Harry, how could you pick Draco?! He is a terrible person, a Death Eater?”
Groaning loudly, I roll out of bed and head in the shower.
A tear streams down his face while he smiles softly to himself.
“Erm well I’ve just been stressed with coming back here and other things. I don’t know why it would concern you though malfoy.”
He feels like the “butterflies” in his stomach are erupting.
His kitchen lights on. Maybe he’s baking or reading the newspaper which he tends to do a lot. Wow, just being here fills me with so many memories.
Draco’s upper lip quirks upward.
“What Harry,” he softly mumbles.
“Thank you P-Harry. It means a lot coming from you, you know. I would like to apologize as well. All the remarks I said to you weren’t true and I feel incredibly sorry for all the things that happened that night.” I smile back at Draco and continue on with the second, and most important thing I have to tell him.
“Well, I better get going P-Harry. I’ll see you around, yeah?”
“It’s fine.. Why are you out here this late anyways?”
“Now, let’s head back to your place Harry.”
He smiles, specifically at Molly.
“Just sit by me, I won’t bite.”
As he sits in the bottom he feels calm as all the air starts to leave his lungs. He wishes he could sit down here all day, but knows he can’t or else he’d drown. His record for sitting at the bottom of the pool was 1:00.
I’ve missed him so much.
“Hold on,” he whispered.
I begin to tear up, as I continue on.
I stumble out of the bathroom and walk outside towards and alley. I take a couple deep breaths and apparate back home.
So far so good guys! Chapters are short, so I'm sorry for that!
The vibrant green eyes that make you feel mesmerized.
“Listen this is weird, so I’m just going to leave..” Draco scratches his lower neck as he’s about to walk away, until Harry grabs his lower wrist.
As Draco moved along to the music a body was firmly pressed against his grinding, and he felt head over heels.
“Molly, you know I love and adore you right? Well, if you’re going to keep treating Draco as if he’s some sort of plague then leave. WE are absolutely tired of your indecency! How?! After all these years of knowing me and being accepting? You can’t seem to accept, understand, and love both me and Draco together? If you have anything more to say then you can write a letter and give it to your owl.”
Draco smiled, his brightest smile, and headed over towards Harry.
Harry couldn’t stop himself from staring at Draco as he slowly bit his lip.
I chuckle.
“Yeah, sure you can stop by. There’s a lot of rooms I haven’t looked through or cleaned since it’s just me there. Could be a lot of Black family heirlooms there.”
the lights dimmed..
Having to look at the slowly faded death mark on his arm made him shudder, but he couldn’t think about that.. not now.
“...it’s like he’s still there lingering the halls,” Draco whispers.
“Er, uh hi Draco? Long time no see..” Harry  said awkwardly while trying not to stare back at Draco’s face.
“Yes, I would assume so,” Draco murmurs while taking a bite from his chocolate scone.
“Are you going to keep staring at me or what?” He drawls, yet his tone isn’t as harsh as it used to be. “Sorry,” he mumbles
As the Floo goes out, snow starts to fall and music begins to fill the room. Draco can finally relax.
I take a deep breath. This is hard for me because what if he doesn’t feel the same?
“Uh sorry, but do you happen to have a phone? If so I can just uh message you and stuff?” Harry scratches the side of his neck, a way to hide his sudden discomfort.
Draco's heart is pounding out of his chest.
“Well, you haven’t done anything to piss me off yet have you,” Draco smirks.
The man smirked, so he thought.
Hopefully I didn’t startle Draco.
The door slowly opens, and Draco stares back at me with disbelief.
I begin to breathe quickly as I look at his face. Draco’s shocked, shit, did I do something wrong??!
Was it the way he tasted? No, that couldn’t be it since I’ve never kissed this man in my life..
Draco laughs out loud, which surprises me. I stare at him wide-eyed.
He’s never felt this way with anyone not even with Ginny.
Harry swallowed the bite of food in his mouth and cleared his throat; his cheeks blushing a small bit, although he certainly didn't authorize them to do so. "I suppose not, Mrs. Weasley. He hadn't really mentioned it, and I didn't see him this morning."
"And you'll be apparating to the port?" Molly asked, frantic much like she was on the mornings of September 1st when she was almost always rushing at least five kids to pack up and get ready to board the Hogwarts Express.
Third year, the year he was punched in the face by one of Harry's best friends.
"And Ginny with Luna, Neville with Hannah?" Harry added, having caught his breath.
Harry loved Draco so much that it created aches in his chest. Harry loved Draco so much that a simple fond memory of the boy was enough to make him well up in tears from the overflowing abundance of joy Draco made Harry feel. Harry loved Draco so much, that he reminded the blond of that fact every day. Multiple times.
And then there was their third chaser, August Rowle. He was the only member that Draco didn’t get along with. He avoided Draco like the plague and Draco was all too happy to do the same. Miles Bletchley, their keeper, talked to Draco a bit and instructed him on the signal that he would send to him to catch the snitch. The two of them got along well enough. He was friendly. But Draco couldn’t help but side eye him from time to time because he was one of the few people close to Diggory. The last were two brothers, Hakim and Hamid Shafiq, who were brothers and their beaters. They had plenty of muscle and their constant back and forth reminded him of the Weasley twins he met on the train. They were oddly fun to be around.
Greyback dodged the fireball headed his way but it was just enough for Draco to bark out orders. “Nott, Blaise, protect Brown!”
“Oh, erm, excuse me! Malfoy, was it?”
“Nott,” He whispered. “Thanks for the save.”
Draco stopped and turned towards the sound of the voice that called his name. And at that very moment, his heart stuttered at the sight of a boy. He wasn’t all that much older than Draco, probably a second or third year, but he was still very handsome. His brown hair looked like it had been recently windswept; his Hufflepuff yellow tie was loosened just a bit as it rested outside of his uniform instead of tucked inside. “You walk quickly, you know.” He said with a teasing smile.
As November began, whispers spread throughout Hogwarts about the Hallowe’en Werewolf Incident. Only the five Slytherins (and one Lavender Brown) knew what happened that night but they promised to never tell. The answer as to how Greyback got into the castle was not known but he had been arrested and was awaiting trial to be sent to Azkaban.
“Slytherin scores with a perfect tactic from Flint! Ohoho, but Madam Hooch is giving him a serious stink eye…”
“Never better…”
“Will you two shut it about your primes? This is serious!” Daphne glared at the two of them, immediately shutting them up.
“Oh, we went to the third-floor corridor by accident and almost mauled by a giant three-headed dog guarding a trapdoor. Happens to everyone, I imagine.” Greg explained quickly before he focused back on his poster. The two boys looked at the three of them in shock. Daphne ducked her head, hiding a laugh, while Draco just focused back on his book.
“You are getting so many dates after this. Save some for the rest of us, eh?” And that couldn’t be anyone else but Blaise.
“No promises.” Greg snickered.
Draco wordlessly nodded his head before he continued his journey to the Quidditch pitch, this time with the handsome Hufflepuff right by his side. Diggory talked on and on about how much he liked Quidditch but was quite nervous when he first started playing. Draco also learned that he was a third year and had plans on becoming a professional player for whichever team took him. Diggory apparently loved the Chudley Cannons and, surprisingly, that wasn’t something that threw Draco off immediately.
Black looked at her, having not noticed her before, as his posture relaxed a bit. Draco had to hold in the sound of disgust that threatened to tumble out of his mouth. Of course, Black would get soft around a Gryffindor but would accuse Draco of murdering a beast that almost killed them as if it were a bad thing. “Brown, your house was worried about you. Get out of here.”
As Draco ate, his eyes fell over to the Gryffindor table. There was no sign of Lavender Brown. She must have still been crying her eyes out. Wherever she is. If she went back to the Gryffindor common room, surely her friends would have forced her to come to the feast?
“Ask the sorting hat,” Draco jerked his arm away before he grabbed Nott by the hand. The boy’s eyes widened as Draco’s hold tightened. “You’re coming with me. This is somehow your fault, you know.”
After practice, Draco had a good idea of who his teammates were. There was Marcus Flint, of course, who was the captain and very aggressive chaser. Flint liked to cheat. A lot. Flint boasted that he was Hooch’s least favorite captain because she knew he was cheating at times but couldn’t bust him for it. Could she really be upset that he was just showing off his Slytherin traits? There was also Adrian Pucey, who was their second chaser. He liked to cheat just as much as Flint which is why there were best friends. He was an older brother which was why he liked to check in on Draco from time to time during their practice to make sure he was feeling alright.
“Oh, Hagrid, we know about that dog in the third-floor corridor.” He said innocently. “Can you tell us what that’s about it?”
All of a sudden, his broom came to a sudden stop nearly sending Draco off of it. The entire crowd gasped and held their breath. Draco held his breath too, his eyes shut tight before he slowed opened them. And that is when he saw the fluttering golden ball that held his team’s victory. The Golden Snitch.
Draco thought to himself. Draco did his best to get control of his broom but it wouldn’t move in any direction that he wanted. It almost seemed like it wanted to buck him off of it. He was sent zooming past Cedric and then Rowle who he could hear snarl at him despite the wind whipping past him. Bloody hell, he was going to die by a rogue broom. What a way to go.
“Why would the school hide money, though?” Greg threw in. “I mean, really, this is Hogwarts. This school probably has just about as much or even
The Great Hall was decorated with pumpkins filled with candy for the Hallowe’en feast. Greg didn’t waste any time digging his hands into the pumpkins to stuff his pockets with sweets. He very nearly began eating them too but got a slap on the wrist by Daphne. “Honestly, Gregory, you’ll ruin your appetite!”
And just like that, Draco’s fears were confirmed when Professor Pettigrew came running into the Great Hall screaming and crying. “Somebody help! Somebody let a bloody werewolf in the building!”
“Blimey, you’re lucky,” Diggory lets out a chuckle that goes straight to Draco’s heart. He couldn’t help but slick back his hair a bit just to make sure he still looked as immaculate as he used to feel exactly one minute ago. “You’re the youngest seeker of this century, you know. It’ll be an honor to play against you in this upcoming match. But just because you’re young doesn’t mean that I’ll be going easy on you.”
“You got it.” Draco nodded.
!” Daphne shouted, sending Greyback flying into one of the sinks which sprayed out water once his heavy body broke it. The wolf shook it off and began running towards Daphne. Greg quickly pushed her out of the way, the two of them landing on the ground. Greyback saw this as an opportunity to try and bite them but Draco wouldn’t allow it.
“Dog thing?” Theo asked.
Draco tipped his broom down and raced towards it, his hand outstretched and ready to take it into his hand.
On Hallowe’en, Draco received a very short letter from Regulus along with a package of chocolates.
Once Lee Jordan was in the announcer stands, the atmosphere on the pitch exploded with excitement. Chants from all different houses were heard. Of course, Gryffindor was the loudest. Why wouldn’t they be? But it wasn’t hard to spot Greg and his silly sign in the crowd, waving at Draco like a flag. Daphne was by his side, clapping her hands along with Blaise. Theo was only sitting there, his head in a book. Typical Theo, really.
Draco swallowed and nodded, pushing down the urge to vomit all over the handsome boy who didn’t seem to hate him at all. “That’s true. I was on my way to practice now, actually.”
“I don’t know why she did that. Can I please just regret it in peace?”
“I knew my sign worked! Did you see it?” Oh, Greg.
He shared the chocolates at breakfast with Greg, Daphne, and Blaise. Nott was welcome to have some too but the boy seemed to be determined to separate himself from Draco. The day proceeded without much fanfare, the occasional student jumping out to scare a couple of first years to get into the Hallowe’en spirit. Charms class proved to be as awful as Draco expected. Draco hated Wingardium Leviosa. He was so close to completing it but it seemed, no matter what, he could not lift the feather all the way up off the ground. Was it his wand? Was it him?
“Come on, please?” Daphne pouted. “We’ll keep it a secret.”
“Alrigh’, Alrigh’! Move out the way!” And...Hagrid. Draco watched as the large man came towards him, scooping him up in his arms. “Good show, good show! Fang’ll want to celebrate with yeh!”
“So, what are your plans for Hallowe’en?” Pucey asked him as they landed on the ground. Oh, right. Hallowe’en was coming up.
“Maybe if we leave now, he’ll bleed out.” Nott sneered at the body.
Draco looked up and saw Celeste descending onto their table, carrying a very large package. She dropped in unceremoniously onto the table, leaving just as quickly as she appeared. Greg let out an annoyed groan at his spilled over cornflakes. While Daphne assisted Greg in cleaning up his spilled cereal, Draco focused on unwrapping the random gift he received. From the shape of it, he could easily see what it was. Once the brown wrapping paper was off, he was met with the sight of a brand new Firebolt 2000.
“Ahh, to be in love…”
“This is bad. Brown isn’t with the Gryffindors. I think she might be in trouble.”
“You lot,” Black grunted. “Fifty points from Slytherin for separating from the group during an emergency. Now get out of here before I deduct more.”
“I was enjoying the tea. Thanks a lot, you three.” Theo huffed. But they ignored him as one question filled their minds.
Who the heck was Perenelle Flamel?
Oohs echoed with the rest of the team as Bletchley came back to this, red in the face. Diggory seemed amused. He waved goodbye to Bletchley and then Draco before he took his leave. “C’mon, you little house traitor. We need you in your best shape. The goals can’t Keep themselves.” Flint said, throwing his arm around Bletchley.
“But what is he doing here?” Daphne wondered. “Who could have let a known Death Eater in the school?”
Draco and his friends celebrated in their own way at Hagrid’s Hut with tea and crackers. An odd combination but he didn’t care much. Especially since the atmosphere was warm and welcoming, filled with the laughter of his friends and praise for Draco’s success. As things began winding down, Greg looked up from his current cuddle session with Fang at Hagrid.
“Oh hell,” He heard Flint nearby. “I think the poor boy’s got a concussion.”
“Bletchley’s got a little thing for our Hufflepuff visitor. We like to tease him about it.” Flint patted Draco on the back. “A Slytherin and a Hufflepuff. I can’t even imagine it but nothing’s impossible. I think I’ll officially have seen it all when a Slytherin and Gryffindor get together though.” The team fake gagged at just the mention of it. Draco stifled a chuckle. These guys didn’t seem so bad. A lot more welcoming than all the other Slytherins. Maybe there was just something about Quidditch that transcended the boundaries of hatred.”
Back at it again with a new chapter. Thank you so much for the positive comments on the last chapter!
“Slytherin is playing Hufflepuff soon?” For some reason, this news was a shock to him.
“Don’t mention it, Malfoy. I just thought it would be a shame if you died. You do owe me a life debt for this, you know,” And then, Nott smiled. Nott actually smiled. He never thought he’d see the day that Nott smiled at him. “And, by the way, you can call me Theo. If you want.”
“House traitor?” Draco spoke up.
(See the end of the chapter for
They all eventually come to a stop in front of the girls’ bathroom. Draco took a deep breath and pushed open the door, all five of them coming face to face with the towering figure of a creature that seemed oddly familiar to him.
Cedric held out his hand for Draco which Draco accepted, getting up on his feet before being bombarded by his friends.
“Can we talk about how unfair it was that we got points deducted for saving a Gryffindor? Black is completely out of line for that!” Greg bemoaned, reaching into his pockets to unwrap some candy as if he didn’t just bash a werewolf’s head in.
“I’m being serious.” Draco seethed. That wiped the smirk off of Zabini’s face and even got the attention of his other friends. “Something isn’t right. Something bad is going to―”
This was stupid, wasn’t it? What could he possibly do against a werewolf?
A bad feeling filled Draco’s stomach like stones. “Has anyone seen Lavender Brown?”
“I know, I know. Sheesh, you’re embarrassin’...” Bletchley mumbled.
“Hey, let’s focus!” Daphne snapped her fingers in front of Draco’s face, drawing his attention back to the group. “You’re the one who wanted to speculate about what was under that trapdoor. So let’s speculate!”
Diggory held out his hand to him. Draco shook it. “You too, Diggory.”
“Complete and utter accident, we promise,” Draco spoke up before Daphne could expose their late night duel attempt. “Sorry to spring this on you, Hagrid, but we really want to have answers. It’s important.”
“Alright, Draco, are you a Quidditch fan?” Flint asked bluntly.
“You’d be cute together!”
“Be safe, Draco. Keep an eye out for jinxes,” Daphne hugged him tightly, strands of her dirty blonde hair tickling his cheek. When she pulled back and Greg got closer, she shot the lumbering boy a glare. “Oh, no you don’t. We aren’t going with him.
Draco quickly followed after him, imagining the feeling of how nice it must feel to fly in a Quidditch uniform.
When everyone was gathered in the Great Hall for breakfast, Draco sat with Greg and Daphne away from the other Slytherins as they discussed last night’s events. The three of them occasionally shot glares at Potter from their spot away from him but he didn’t seem to be aware of them looking at him. It was taking everything in Draco’s willpower not to go over there and throttle him.
The wolf growled, turning away from his previous prey. He heard a whimper from a girl behind him. Looking past him, it seemed that Lavender Brown was very much about to be puppy chow. In a sudden rush of Gryffindor-ish bravery, Draco whipped out his wand and called out the first spell that came to mind. “
