"What about the Headmaster himself?" Neville accused. If all these teachers were capable, surely the man who runs the school was twice as capable. The other three stared at him, and he shrugged. "I don't know any other teachers who could know that kind of charm work."
While the two first years who had grown up with muggle games taught the others, Professor Quirrell was out looking for Ugoki. He and Ugoki had been friends for years, so he had an idea about where the troll may have been.
"Hey, Harry," Draco replied in an amused tone, and looked over at Hermione, who was beside Harry. A look of disdain crossed his features for a brief moment when his eyes landed on her, but it disappeared just as quick.
They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast, coconut, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn't touch, which turned out to be pepper.
"Oi, Ugoki," he said, which successfully garnered the attention of the smartly troll. "You're time to shine. Or have you forgotten?" he teased. Ugoki bopped him on the head with the newspaper before he stood up.
The group of four students and one teacher walked quickly through the school. They were behind Professor Snape so they had no idea what he looked like, but every student they came across in the hall practically flew out of the way when they saw him. The reactions from those around them made the four think they were in massive trouble, but they were moving too fast to get enough breath to ask anything.
Consider this a "new story" boon of two chapters back to back, because that's unlikely to happen again. We do, somehow, have lives. We prefer quality over quantity, so the time between new chapters will vary, and we can't say by how much.
Draco used the new knowledge about Parvati to slip in next to Padma during his classes with Ravenclaws, and hung out with his housemates only during classes with Hufflepuffs, because he wasn't brave enough to try and talk to someone in the badger house. When he was with his housemates during class, Pansy and Blaise stuck around him, so the nitpicking his house did was dropped to a safe minimum. The only time he truly had to deal with his housemates dislike was when he was in his common room, and that only happened at curfew, because Hermione had offered to have him in the Gryffindor common room for studying. Which quickly became for fun, but hey, it was the thought that counted.
"You did something without consulting a book first?" Harry asked. Hermione looked over at him, and then she laughed.
“This one is from Neville,” Ron said, and pointed at a square shaped gift to divert the attention from the cauldron.
“So... Halloween night?” Harry asked, and it clicked in Professor Snape’s head that that night was probably what started their hunt for it all.
When the hat finally called out "GRYFFINDOR!", Neville went running off with the hat on his head, and had to bring it back.
Harry looked over at Draco, and then turned his head to him. He made direct eye contact with him. Draco looked up to the stars in exasperation.
“Quirrell?” The four asked at different times. That had been the last name they expected to hear out of Professor Snape’s mouth. Quirrell was skittish and terrified of his own shadow. It seemed like he was afraid to utter any of the things he spoke of, and was even more afraid to look anyone in the eye. In fact, he was too afraid to do anything. Why would he be that afraid and skittish and still be willing to pursue the Philosopher’s Stone?
Draco left promptly and without another look back. Professor McGonagall turned to the rest of the first years.
"You won't be. There's loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough." Ron assured Harry. While they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London. Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep.
At that moment, the sound of footsteps reverberated off the stone walls, which let the quartet know ahead of time that someone was walking their way. They looked at one another, and Draco nodded his head towards the statues of armor that was in the hallway. They all got the idea and scrambled to hide behind the armor in their alcoves, and tucked their cloaks and robes in close. Someone turned the corner into the corridor and slowly made their way to the door at the end of the hall, where the cerberus was kept. Once the person swept past the alcoves, each student knew who it was: Professor Snape.
"...What are we like?" Neville asked. The pair continued upstairs towards where they hoped was the class. Harry hesitated for a few moments as he remembered what the hat said: That'll make your friendships very hard.
"Asphodel and wormwood make the Draught of Living Death." Draco blurted out after the silence had gone on for a minute. Professor Snape froze in breath, and Harry thought he would die on the spot if looks could kill. Hermione's arm dropped.
The door clicked silently, and the three rushed into the room. Harry closed the door and Hermione locked it not a second too soon as Filch finally came around the bend. They heard him huff and curse, but he didn't try the only door in the hallway.
He stared up at the two who watched him with heartfelt smiles. He’d never seen these people before in his life, but it seemed like they knew him. The woman was beautiful, with long red hair and green eyes much like his own; while the man was tall, his black hair was untidy around his hazel eyes, which bore glasses not too different from Harry’s. He watched them as the pieces fell into place, and he could see them grow sad. He knew who they were.
The odd duo headed their separate ways afterwards as they went to different classes, and each house was visibly relieved to be free of one another. The last class of the day for the Gryffindor first years was Charms, shared with Ravenclaws. Professor Flitwick was a tiny wizard, and he put Professor Sprout to shame with his enthusiasm with the class. Harry worried that he'd fall off the stack of books he used to see over his desk with how much energy he displayed, and was proven correct as Professor Flitwick did indeed fall off the stack of books when he called out Harry's name while taking roll.
"What about Professor Flitwick? He's versed in charms." Harry asked as he considered how dangerous the little man could actually be.
He then made the mistake of opening the Chocolate Frogs and a frog got loose. Harry spent a few minutes trying to catch it, and when he finally sat back down -with a mouth full of frog-, Ron was finished and looked over Harry’s packages.
"I thought I would have to choose. Between you and my home. It's all my housemates ever said." Draco said quietly. It was then that they realized that Draco had been facing this the last two months of school, and not just the last two weeks he'd been avoiding them at all costs.
"Well, write that down." Professor Snape ordered. The entire class moved hastily to follow his orders, and the sound of quills and parchment being removed from bags was the only sound for a few minutes.
Harry happily scribbled a note to Hagrid that said he would be be there, and that he would be bringing some friends along. He handed the note back to Hedwig, and she flew off.
"What are these?" Harry asked Ron. He forewent the brought upon emotions in favor of still talking to him for now, and held up a pack of Chocolate Frogs. "They're not really frogs, are they?"
"I'm Harry." He said, and he thrusted his hand forward to be shaken. Hermione looked at the hand and then back at his face with trepidation.
-, which surprised the group because those hadn't been there the night before. As they were nearing the final level of the castle they learned why though: the stairs
"I haven't eaten food in 400 years," The ghost answered. Harry didn't know what to say to that. "I don't need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don't think I've introduced myself, I'm Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower."
It was the smell that hit them first; a mix of old socks and a toilet that was never cleaned. It made them reach for their noses. Next was the sound; a steady grunt noise, followed with unsteady footfalls of giant feet and the sound of something being dragged. The sound stopped entirely for a good few seconds, and then the bathroom door flew open, and in walked the troll.
Harry left with the Weasley’s near the end of dinner. Fred and George hovered over each other in a fake attempt of being drunk, while Percy half carried a sleepy Ron to the dorms. Harry thought they looked like a happy family with their equally terrible but loving sweaters. He saw off Fred and George to their room and helped Percy put Ron to bed. When Percy was gone Harry went to his bed. He remembered what he got that morning as he slipped into bed and felt a watery textured fabric. That’s right, he had an invisibility cloak. From his father.
"Where?" Hermione asked once more. Blaise shrugged, even though he knew where. It was a Slytherin House problem, he wasn't going to include the Gryffindor's until he had too.
"Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?" Seamus asked. Sir Nick seemed very miffed by the sudden turn of the conversation.
By that rule, no matter what Neville had done, if he had gotten on the broom, Draco would have helped him. It was one of those things that would have happened no matter what, because it had been Draco's choice. It was like Harry's ability: definite.
Something niggled in the back of Harry's brain then. He'd completely forgotten about it because it had been so brief and he'd felt nauseous from the ride. When Hagrid had taken him to Gringotts back in August, he'd fetched a tiny little package from inside a large vault. Hagrid had said Gringotts was the safest place for anything, except maybe Hogwarts. Maybe that's where the little package had gone.
"To get you on the field," Hermione said matter of factly. Draco knew instantly where the thought had come from, and on one hand he wanted to smack himself for telling them that Professor Snape was a family friend, and on the other hand he wanted to smack Hermione, Harry, and Neville for thinking Professor Snape would choose one student over the rest.
There was an indescribable flood of feelings from whoever brushed him at that moment. They were grand and permeated his head with determined contact, persistent trust, and consistent honesty. In flickers, like a swipe of a flame, would be brief moments of things like disbelief, comfort, home, danger, fear, and joy. The emotions were so extreme Harry whipped around to find who caused those. Who was so colorful a person that-
"So we need to turn around?" Neville asked. Hermione nodded her head enthusiastically, which caused her wild hair to bob around her. The three worked their way through the train the rest of the ride, and despite their best efforts, were never able to find the toad.
"Oh, are you a Prefect, Percy?" Asked one of the twins, genuinely surprised. "You should have said something, we had no idea."
The entire day was filled with baked goods and sweets and fun treats. It was the best Christmas Harry had ever seen or been a part of, and it kept going and going. The Weasley’s made him a part of the clan for the day, and he played games and went about the castle with them as they pranked what few were there. He gained more gifts throughout the day, from a wizarding chess set to a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and the dinner was a spectacle. Professor Dumbledore traded out his pointy hat for a flower bonnet, and was laughing heartily at something Professor Flitwick said. Hagrid was red-cheeked and spent a good long while plucking up his courage before he leaned over and kissed Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who flat out giggled at Hagrid. He stared at the three teachers with some guilt over suspecting them to be after the stone when Professor Quirrell was so obvious, only now that he knew about it. He, like Professor Snape, kept an eye on Professor Quirrell that evening to make sure he didn't go after the stone. It was clear this was a good night to do it if he was going to try anything.
A short time later Percy led the Gryffindor First Years through a series of corridors Harry would need a while to learn. There were stairs and long halls, and they just kept going up, until near the top of a staircase they came upon a great portrait of a fat lady in a pink dress.
"We're changing her," Neville whispered conspiratorially. The other two nodded, and Hermione rolled her eyes.
"Neville!" A feminine, albeit breathless sounding voice came from down the hall from Harry and Neville. Harry got a look at a girl with brown eyes and equally brown hair bushy like a squirrel, teeth a bit large for her mouth, and an air of know-it-allness surrounding her concerned expression.
Harry looked forwards to flying, but learned Neville and Hermione definitely were not. Neville's grandmother had kept Neville away from all forms of flying that could get him hurt, and Hermione couldn't
"Oh, Mum, can I go on the train and see him, please." A girl's voice begged. Harry slipped a little farther down.
Harry, thankfully, knew who that teacher was because some of his classmates had already had the experience to meet him. Most of them came out alive, but the few that didn't did not like Professor Snape or Slytherin's thereafter.
"Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor and Slytherin five points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go." Professor McGonagall told them. Like their coats were on fire they took off down the hall in the direction Draco would have gone. Once around the bend they found Draco, who had gone only far enough to hide from the teachers.
At eight feet from the ground Professor McGonagall and Madam Hooch were able to jump up and grab Neville's broomstick. As soon as Neville was off the broom Draco jumped from his, and then immediately placed his broom on the ground and stepped back from it. It was like he knew Professor McGonagall would round on him, as she did exactly that not a few seconds later once she knew Neville was safe.
"Can't stay long, Mother," He said. "I'm up front, the Prefects have got two compartments to themselves."
"What if it actually was Professor Snape? We're accusing the Heads of Ravenclaw and Gryffindor because they have the ability to, but so does Professor Snape. Everyone knows he wants Professor Quirrell's spot." Neville pointed out. They were back to the beginning, with no sure fire end in sight.
“My, you’re a funny sight,” The Headmaster tottled, and then smiled over his half-moon spectacles. Harry smiled back, though it felt more like a grimace. “Let’s get you back to your common room.”
As if on cue the Grand Hall doors opened and Draco walked in with an airy smile. Professor Snape walked behind him like a dark cloud, but that didn't seem to affect the Slytherin blond. He swaggered his way down the aisles with Professor Snape until he got with his classmates and was sat down. Like a pack of hounds they surrounded Draco with questions. In no time, the entire table made noises of celebration. It wasn't long before everyone knew what had happened.
Dinner that night was much more subdued than the night before, and the extravagant dishes in the welcoming feast did not reappear. The first years conversed about their first day of classes, and Hermione made herself well known as a know-it-all.
The air was so silent that you could hear a quill drop. Harry didn't dare to look away from Professor Snape in that moment, though he wished he could.
Harry shook his head, but he could feel a tug in his head; something about what the boy said felt weird. The boy closed the door behind him and plopped himself down on the seat. He glanced at Harry for a moment before he looked out the window.
Draco tossed the ball up in the air, higher and higher, and that told Neville what he was planning on doing. Neville began to sweat from worry that Draco would actually throw it. Draco continued to stare at Neville and toss the ball, but he never quite went through with throwing it. The minutes stretched as Draco continued to tease, until Madam Hooch approached.
The sorting carried on after Harry. There were Thomas, Turpin, Weasley, and Zabini. Two went to Gryffindor, one went to Ravenclaw, and one went to Slytherin. Thus the sorting was done. Professor McGonagall took the hat away, and the man Harry could correctly identify as Albus Dumbledore stood up.
Dinner wound down to a close shortly after. Harry spent most of that time glancing at the teacher's table, from Professor Quirrell to whoever the other professor was, but neither looked at him again. Professor Dumbledore stood up to end the feast.
"It'll be ok." Harry said. He had found that to be true, no matter what. If something was bound to happen, things would be ok afterwards, even if it took a while.
Harry was sure he was in a nightmare then. In the room they now hid in was a massive beast; a black monster with three dog heads, and each one was focused on them. It got worse once the dog rose, and now he filled the whole room. It took one look at the three heads growling for Harry to decide he would choose Filch over death.
The idea made him settle down, and he followed his friends out quietly. They walked to the Gryffindor Common Room, now concerned that Professor Quirrell could hear them. If he was as smart as Professor Snape seemed to think he was, then if he heard Draco say Professor Snape hummed in the Grand Hall it wouldn’t take long for Professor Quirrell to figure it out.
“And in doing so almost got yourself and three other students hurt. Be thankful it’s two weeks and not longer.” Professor Snape answered airily. He saw Harry move to speak again, but Hermione clapped her hand over his mouth.
The countryside that was flying past the window became wilder. The neat fields had gone; now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills.
The rest of the group looked up at Ron's grumble; some grimaced with him, like Seamus and Lavender, while others shrugged, like Parvati and Dean. Neville didn't seem too worried over such a thing, and Hermione just smiled softly to herself. The Slytherin's weren't as bad as she'd initially thought; Blaise Zabini had complimented her intelligence in Herbology on Wednesday, and that was more than she could say about a lot of her old classmates in school. Harry perked up at the idea of sharing a double class with all his new friends, and then perked up even more when he realized this was the first potions class they had.
"Harry Potter," Harry said as he took Draco's hand. A second bout of the same emotions from the night before happened, but this time Harry was more prepared for it.
"I'm just a kid. I didn't even do anything." He said. Ron looked insulted for Harry, even though it had been Harry who said it.
"Just don't pair us with the rest of our house. We don't care who you're friends with, because you don't care who we're friends with." Pansy said.
The dialogue of the professors are very book heavy, as we are still setting up the story. And of course, we own nothing.
"Neville and I could go," Hermione said. Harry looked at the muggleborn with a beaming smile, which she returned with half as much teeth.
The raven-haired Gryffindor accepted this as his death in that moment, and then he heard the shaky humming of a familiar tune. He didn't know why he did, but he believed it as maybe his mum's voice as he died.
The first few seconds of the emotions to come over him were off set, like he realized she was there but his back saw her more than his front. That shifted immediately into a wide range of peace and joy and something he could only say was trust. The same syrupy mix of acceptance and excitement he had felt moments ago with Neville came back with Hermione, and he let go of her hand with a brighter smile than when he'd started. For her part, his grin was obviously not what she had expected, if her glance at Neville said anything.
"My housemates wanted me to tease you by destroying your Remembrall. I didn't want too." Draco explained in a rush as the two houses got closer together by orders of Madam Hooch.
What Blaise hadn't planned for was Harry and Neville following them, or to find Pansy already in the hallway outside of the bathroom. Pansy looked to be talking herself into going into the boys bathroom when Blaise, Harry, Neville, and Hermione rushed in. When she saw Hermione go in, she went in as well.
"N-no," He said quietly, then with a bit more air in him, "But I did find someone else who was willing to help."
It happened quite suddenly. The sallow skinned teacher tapped lightly on Professor Quirrell and said something to him. Almost like clockwork Professor Quirrell looked at his table partner, and pointed in Harry's general direction. As one the two turned to look at him. A white hot, sharp pain seared through Harry's scar in that moment.
From hail high above the owls came swooping in to deliver the mail. Hedwig dropped a note into Harry's lap, which was the first piece of mail Harry had received that year. It made him jump, and it made Neville spill his drink because Harry knocked his elbow. Harry stared at the letter in his lap for a few moments, because
The train slowed down and finally stopped at the nearest train station to Hogwarts. As soon as the doors were opened people pushed their way out onto the dark train platform. Harry was one of the first to exit the train, and was greeted by the cold night air to his face, and sharp, quick zaps of future emotions with people he touched. A lamp flipped on as more students flooded the area, and over the ruckus of students Harry heard a familiar voice:
He made his way down the train slowly as he checked compartment after compartment for an empty one, and it was only near the end of the train Harry came across exactly what he was looking for. He lifted Hedwig through the window before going to a train door to get his suitcase in. It was heavy, and he couldn't get it past the first two steps before he was stuck.
Harry carefully set the cauldron down so as to not dent it and picked up the present. It was smaller than the other two, but about as heavy as Hermione’s. It had a shiny red wrapping paper on it, a much less formal bow on top, and another insignia Harry figured was the Longbottom crest. It was blue, red, and gold, and had grey hawks of some kind. He worried it’d be something extravagant as well.
Ron picked up a green jelly bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner. "Blaaargh - see? Sprouts."
There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on platform Nine and Three Quarters came in. He looked tearful.
"You didn't have to do that." Harry whispered to Draco in the quiet room. Draco handed him some Snake Fangs with orders to crush them. He didn't respond to Harry for a bit, dutifully focused on his own task. Harry decided not to push it, and stored the information away for a later conversation.
"I was focused on Professor Snape." Hermione said shyly. They stared at her for a moment, and then Draco continued the conversation.
Harry stared at the professor who had so sharply asked him to answer a question that seemed impossible to answer. Was that supposed to be obvious? Was it common knowledge? Was it something in the book he had yet to read?
That wasn’t the password, but Professor Dumbledore could go anywhere he wanted. It swung open, and thankfully the Pink Lady didn’t ask questions.
“What did you see?” Professor Dumbledore asked. Harry was tempted to keep quiet, but the old wizard walked forwards and stood beside Harry, in front of the mirror. He didn’t say or do anything else for a long time, and Harry finally showed his head.
"I shall return when we're ready for you. Please wait quietly." Professor McGonagall said. She left with nare a sound, and the group of first years were left to their own devices.
She pulled the great doors apart father to reveal the entrance hall, so large that the entire Dursley house would fit inside. The old stone walls were lined with torches that gave the room a warm glow, and the ceiling was too high up to see. A grandiose marble staircase faced them, which led to to what Harry assumed were the upper floors.
"Please, Professor McGonagall, they were looking for me." Draco said. Professor Snape's eyes locked in on Draco, and he glared at the blond Slytherin.
What he’d initially thought was that Draco was in the group to get to Harry Potter, something he’d mentioned over the last year outside of school, but it was clear to him now that they were a group that thought together and worked together. On one hand, it eased his mind to know Draco was there and with friends, on the other, he worried that the Gryffindor's would make him one as well.
“Goodnight Headmaster,” Harry answered as he stepped through the portrait. He turned around and shook hands with the old professor.
The second present Harry received was from his family. The note wasn’t all too mean, and the gift seemed nice enough. It was a fifty pence, which Ron seemed to moon over.
Transfiguration was taught by Professor McGonagall, the one with the emerald green robes that sorted them. Her personality matched her exterior: stern and clever. Precisely when class was supposed to begin, she told them exactly what she expected from her students.
“What do you see?” Harry asked. Professor Dumbledore didn’t answer for a long time. He tilted his head and aahed at the mirror for a good time.
“It is! Look down! You have an Invisibility Cloak.” Ron exclaimed. Harry looked down as told, and found he had no body. He stuck his arm out from the cloak and saw it float in mid-air.
, he helped him start floating down. It was a slow process with what appeared to be a lot of talking between the two boys, though the rest of the class below couldn't hear any of it. At fifteen feet from the ground Professor McGonagall came out. She marched right over to Madam Hooch and asked with the witch hadn't gotten on her own broom to bring Neville down.
"So he attacked his own house?" The Slytherin continued. "Why not Gryffindor, who he might actually hate?"
“Unless you think it’s a student?” Professor Snape asked dully. The idea struck the four. A student going after it? There are so many of them, there’s no way to figure out which one. Professor Snape continued before they could get too lost in that idea. “Then yes. Every other teacher here has been working for Professor Dumbledore for too long to try something like this.”
"We'd been meaning to find you for the last week, we actually almost got caught last night." Hermione explained. Draco looked over at Harry, and then behind at Blaise and Pansy.
Ten minutes early became fifteen minutes late for the teacher himself, and the class became rowdy. The door burst open, which let in a cold breeze as Professor Snape stepped into the classroom. He swept past the students quickly until he reached his desk, at which point he stopped and turned to face his class with a callous gaze. He began to take roll, and like Professor Flitwick he paused when he got to Harry's name. Unlike Professor Flitwick though, he didn't fall off of a pile of books.
"No more'n four to a boat!" Hagrid ordered, and called the attention to the small fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry, Neville, and Hermione were followed into their boat by Ron.
"Quidditch will probably make it worse than." Harry introduced the topic casually. Draco shrugged, because that was the least of his worries with Quidditch.
The four hid once more as Professor Snape came back out. They waited until they were sure the coast was clear before they dared to leave their spots. They stood in front of the door that was twice their height, and the only thing protecting them from the dog behind it.
They stood on the outside of the door and waited for Filch to catch them. No one was there though, they were safe. Filch had left because no student was supposed to be behind that door. Because of the
When they finally stopped it was in the potions room. Professor Snape rushed them in and closed the door solidly behind them. None of them were sure what he muttered at the door, but it was quite a few spells that took some time to make. While Professor Snape did that, the four caught their breaths and got their thoughts together.
They snuck back to their common room, thoroughly off put by the giant dog that had almost eaten them. There they sat, alone in the common room because it was a lot later than they'd expected, and stared in silence for a long while.
“It is the Mirror of Erised. Or, the Mirror of Desire. It shows what you truly want, and for many, they’ll die to see it.” Professor Dumbledore answered. Harry’s lips parted subtly in surprise, and he saw his parents once more, in a different light. They smiled and waved, and he wanted to be there, but now he didn’t trust it. He had no idea how long he’d stood there before Dumbledore showed up. What if it had been most of the night?
Along the way towards one of the larger staircases, the two boys tried to slip by a group of Slytherins. By try, it means Harry bumped shoulders rather painfully with one of them, and was suddenly face to face with stone. He heard some thumps behind him as he propped himself up. Once he was in a sitting position, he rubbed his nose which had scrunched against a step.
He got off the floor and continued his way to the front of the room. The classroom was full of muffled laughter.
Their time with Hagrid was interesting. They arrived on the dot at 3 pm, and Hagrid had a shifty time getting them into his home because of his dog, Fang. He lived in a one room hut where everything was displayed for them to see; from the kitchen to the living room (what little there was of one), to his bedroom. Still, he chatted with them happily, even though he and Draco had been hesitant of each other in the beginning, and fed them rock cakes - which were about as edible as they sounded.
The only time this pattern broke was Friday. They had a double period of Potions in the morning, and the afternoon free. It was the first time that week they had a free afternoon.
Sir Nicholas reached out on reaction and shook Harry's hand. Harry, to his astonishment, didn't feel anything when he touched the ghost, as he was so familiar with his entire life, but did get a dunked in cold sensation from Sir Nicholas. Sir Nicholas' hand went straight through Harry's hand, but Harry got the distinct feeling the ghost was happy that he'd at least tried to shake hands with him.
No one answered, too dumbstruck at the sight of what could only be ghosts, before them. Harry was in a mix of surprise and horror at the sight of the ghosts, and could only stare as the failed jester tottered to them.
"Being friends with us is making all your other friends leave?" Neville asked. Draco nodded solemnly, and sniffled for a good long moment.
“Or put it on each of the things put up by teachers? That way you know when someone goes through them?” Neville offered immediately after. Professor Snape watched them answer to make sure they weren’t about to try this out for themselves. None of them looked ready to jump out and practice what they preached, so he sat back. The first years, to his great humor, all breathed in as one when he did.
The second part of the identical duo appeared, and he was the spitting image of the first twin, right down to the last strand of hair. Together they helped Harry with his luggage and carried it for him to his chosen compartment. Once it was nestled away in a place it couldn't hurt anyone, Harry turned to the twins and grinned.
Along the way towards one of the larger staircases the two boys tried to slip by a group of Slytherins. By try, it means Harry and Draco actively avoided one another. The two walked past one another and then turned around to continue the scene like they were supposed to.
A pale hand flashed in front of Neville, and his new Remembrall was gone from his grasp. They turned to see who had taken it, and found Draco held it carefully in his own hands. The ball of smoke turned back to white as he looked it over. Draco looked between the ball and Neville with a confused expression.
A few minutes before class started Draco broke from the Slytherin group and walked towards the Gryffindors. In his hand, which he tossed carelessly now, was Neville's remembrall. He swaggered to the Gryffindors, and at the front of the group was Neville, who had walked forwards to take the remembrall back. Draco didn't give it back though, he continued to toss it in midair.
"I don't think that counts," Neville said, and he left it at that. "I mean things like... seeing the future, or seeing the past further back than you were alive, seeing the end result of a decision, making a prophecy, etc."
"I'll guard the door." Neville said in reply. Harry grinned at his friend, and removed his hands from Hermione and Draco's wrist. He ignored their strange looks at whatever had transpired between him and Neville and chose to be the one that unlocked the door this time.
"It cost your house points," Harry said. Draco looked over at Professor Snape, who was at his table and staring at the first years like a hawk. He seemed very hesitant to speak.
"Harry," Draco said slowly. He turned and looked at Neville as well. "And Neville. I should let you know something about Professor Snape."
Two days later Harry saw off his best friends, as well as most of the school. Only a few students stayed behind; a Ravenclaw, a few Hufflepuffs, and a few Gryffindors- him, and all of the Weasleys. Without anything to do, and his Christmas homework done thanks to Hermione, Harry found most of his days wandering the halls at a pace he’d never had the luxury of before. He began to move curtains and pictures to see what was behind them, and found a few hidden corridors that he swore were far too short for the distance they took him. He began to talk to random statues and armor sets, and some would talk back. He would walk to the highest tower, and the lowest dungeon, and even went out on the grounds as far as he dared. One day near Christmas eve he swore he saw something large move in the black lake.
"In order for him to know the counter spell he had to of heard the actual spell, so it had to be a teacher near him that is also versed in curses." Neville said imploringly. They pondered that information for a good long moment.
"I don't think he has a bad bone in his body," Draco answered. He remembered a steely gaze of one of their teachers that had made him shiver a few times."Professor McGonagall? She seems like she could be evil if she wanted too."
With those parting, strange words, the old man sat down and tucked his beard into his lap. Harry didn't know whether to laugh or not, and he turned to Percy, the only one in his vicinity who could possibly know.
"Congratulations." Hermione said, and the other two nodded as if to back her up. Draco smiled and preened under the comment.
“Well... that’s in the past, and Draco isn’t his father,” Harry responded. Ron looked over at Harry, and then at what he held. His eyes widened at the cauldron, which was enough for Harry to know he didn’t want to know the price.
It wasn't that, though. It was Hermione, who remembered that Professor Snape had hummed while he opened the door. There had been a loud thunk afterwards, which she knew now was the dog falling asleep. She gambled for her friend's life, and considering the dog went from murderous intent to sleepy intent, it appeared she guessed right.
"Why would he do that?" Harry asked. He felt like he knew Draco had at one point, because he'd been too eager to be friends in the beginning, but that had to of changed. Draco didn't need to be nice to Hermione or help Neville to be friends with Harry.
On the cue, the door burst open, which let in a cold breeze as Professor Snape stepped into the classroom. He swept past the students quickly until he reached his desk, at which point he stopped and turned to face his class with a callous gaze. He began to take roll, and like Professor Flitwick he paused when he got to Harry's name. Unlike Professor Flitwick, he didn't fall off a pile of books.
It was like deja vu for Harry and Neville. Draco came out of the last bathroom stall with a puffy nose and red eyes, and gave them a watery smirk. It didn't fool Neville, who did exactly what he did for Hermione. He tripped on his way over though, and wrapped his arms a bit to low for Draco to successfully hug back if he wanted too.
Silence bit at the air like poison. Harry was deathly aware of Hermione waving her hand in the air, that Draco was uncomfortable, that Neville was even more terrified, and that the rest of the room was still. It was just him, and the professor who glared at him.
Harry and Neville skipped lunch to find Hermione then, because their friend never skipped a class. They went to the common room first, and then went their way down the halls. Eventually Lavender and Parvati was able to point them in a direction- the girl's bathroom. After knocking on the door for a few minutes, because neither wanted to go into the
Harry, Hermione, and Neville walked over to the Slytherin table to congratulate Draco before they left with their house. Draco smiled when he saw them coming his way, but wasn't able to fully turn around because his housemates were bunched together. That didn't stop the four of them though.
Harry could guess who they meant and leaned back so they couldn't see him looking. He stared at the wall across from him, and felt his heart pound for no reason other than being noticed.
"You said You-Know-Who's name!" Ron said, both shocked and impressed. "I'd have thought you, of all people-"
"And maybe start sitting with the Gryffindor's at meals. We can side with you in house, but outside of it we can't touch anyone. House pride and sanctuary and all that." Blaise said. He waved his hand in the air like that meant something. Draco nodded once to each of them, and then looked at the three Gryffindors.
As he passed one of the pasties to Ron, he got his first brush with Ron's hand. A sense of distrust rose in the back of Harry's mind, which he latched onto. It warped around itself into betrayal and estrangement, and pressed down on his brain heavily enough that it felt like it would physically push him to the ground, even though he knew it was all in his mind. A few soft wisps of childhood happiness laced the emotions, but it was so vague he almost didn't notice it.
He slipped back to his housemates, who clapped him on the back for what he'd done. It took Madam Hooch a while before she got the first years under control and back to practicing. Minus Neville, who was effectively banned from riding them. Not that he minded.
“What’s going on?” Harry asked as another bout of loud voices came, and Professor Dumbledore made another detour. This one put them closer to the tower at least, and was a path Harry had seen before.
After the almost incident with Neville, Madam Hooch was more vigilant with the class. No more rogue brooms, and no one needed a trip to the medic ward. Dinner followed the flying lesson. Draco wasn't with them when they walked in because Professor McGonagall had him leave with her at the end of class, and that left a few of the first years worried. Had he actually gotten in trouble? Would he be expelled?
"I doubt she could do something like that... But we can keep an eye on her." Harry replied, and then added on to because he remembered how she could change objects into living things. No doubt she could turn living things into objects too.
He looked down once the line stopped, and they watched as Professor McGonagall set down a stool with a hat- the one Neville had likely meant- on top. The hat looked old, patched, and frayed, and was definitely something Harry's Aunt Petunia would have never allowed in the house.
Professor Snape "tossed" away the thing he was gnawing on, brought out his pocket watch, which he twirled in his hands. He whisper-mimed some words that some could decipher as "My precious." but none were the wiser to what on Earth he could be charading.
Despite what Ron had said about Draco, after the incident with Neville, Draco's already disappearing form completely disappeared. Besides classes where Draco sat beside Harry because that was their seating now, Draco never strayed from his table, and was nowhere to be found between classes. It seemed Draco wasn't after Harry's fame at all, or to be anywhere near him honestly. Now though, he couldn't figure out what Draco wanted at all. Whenever he tried to ask, Draco said everything was fine. He was just busy.
and heard a louder riot for them than he had for the Slytherins. It was a moment where he could realize how unliked his House might be, and he wondered if that would affect the game.
"I can get them back, and double them, easily." Draco said. He sat up proper then, and raised his head up in an aristocratic manner. Harry stared at the eleven-year-old and wondered if that was Draco, or if he was imitating someone.
Harry tried to hide his grin and skip in step all the way back to the common rooms. He already had his letters written out in his head of what he was going to send to his friends, but first, he needed to be safe away from the Headmaster.
Neville didn't say anything after that, and Harry was left wondering if something was wrong. The air didn't feel clean between them, and Harry didn't want to leave it hanging.
to fly by reading books and was very out of her element in this setting. She lectured all of them about the etiquette to Quidditch and flying from "Quidditch Through the Ages", which Neville clung to like it would save his life. Considering how many times Harry, Hermione, and Draco had had to catch him thus far in and out of class, it was a valid concern.
Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore's face had disappeared.
A few of the students, those familiar with ghosts, nodded to the haunts. The Fat Friar grinned at the group.
Terror struck the faces of all the first years, and Draco and Harry removed themselves from the hug in favor of their wands.
"Anyone else sitting here?" He asked, and pointed at the empty seat across from Harry. "Everywhere else is full."
For those who read and for those who commented. Thank you, sincerely. These two chapters are for you.
"I hope not." Neville whispered, mostly to himself. The five Gryffindor's looked about themselves for a bit, and then dropped the topic, because they couldn't figure it out without asking someone. Which could raise questions. Best to leave it silent.
Hermione's face pinched, but she nodded to what Draco said. She didn't know how to fix it, she loved school and loved to answer questions, doing anything else would be less than herself.
Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn't keep his eyes off of them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.
The present was a shiny silver that seemed to move, and probably did. The top of it sat a bow, and what held the box together was a wax seal of a very important looking insignia. It was green and black with a large ‘M’ on the banner, and around it all were dragons and snakes. It read words in Latin he had no hope of figuring out.
"It's not a bad thing," Neville said as soon as he saw the dread on Harry's face. "It's just not... common."
Harry tested the cloak while he walked around. He said hello to pictures and statues and watched as each of them freaked out at the voice without a body, and explored things he hadn’t been able to before. Empty rooms with cobwebs and tunnels he didn’t know if even Mr. Filch went down. He scoured the castle for every door, and eventually found one in a narrow corridor he’d never been down.
“What do you think it is?” Harry asked as he began to carefully unwrap the large present. Ron shrugged, but looked curious.
A few minutes before class started Draco broke from the Slytherin group and walked towards the Gryffindors. In his hand, which he tossed carelessly now, was Neville's remembrall. He swaggered to the Gryffindors, and at the front of the group was Neville, who had walked forwards to take the remembrall back. Draco didn't give it back though, he continued to toss it in midair.
“Don’t tell me you fell for his trick, Draco.” Professor Snape drawled teasingly. Draco flushed as all the pieces clicked into place. All the teachers were suspicious in their own ways, because all of them had things going for them that proved they were the ones after it. Quirrell had been so under the radar none of them had questioned it. He had been
Harry got into line behind a boy with platinum blond hair, with Neville and Hermione behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.
"It was standing on a trap door. It's guarding something." Hermione explained. Neville and Harry stared at her for a few moments.
"Or he's guarding whatever is behind it and checking to make sure it's safe." Draco was quick to retort. The three looked at him, and they frowned severely.
Professor Snape thought about that for a moment. The teacher body knew that someone was after it, they’d put up blocks of their own for that very reason. They hadn’t thought to be alerted when someone touched or got through the blocks though because, well, they didn’t expect anyone to get through.
"If not Professor Snape, than who?" Hermione asked accusingly. "Because I saw his lips moving, and he was staring at the person that fell off the broom."
"Yes. He was the one who took me to get my stuff back in August." Harry explained. Draco's face twisted into a weird expression Harry had learned was distaste.
When the arrived, they found that the entire cast and crew were all shouting out answers to whatever Professor Snape was doing. Said professor was crouched low to the ground, scrunched in on himself, hands "holding" something that he was gnawing on. Someone shouted "Caveman!", but Professor Snape continued.
. After You-Know-Who came for you." Ron explained. They climbed through the portrait and into the common room. Neville closed the door behind them.
Draco's face did a weird mix of surprise and joy. Professor McGonagall's face never slighted in her stern expression, but her words were enough.
"I won't choose him... Over you I mean. I just felt the future emotions with him and didn't want to lose the opportunity." Harry explained. Neville's head jerked around at his admittance, and Harry nodded, as if that would back up what he said.
"I won't ask it of you to choose us over your house. You should do what makes you happy," Harry explained a bit more. Maybe Draco hadn't understood what he meant. "That's not to say we don't want to be your friends, we do, but if it causes you strife we don't want to-"
"It's only been two weeks." Hermione scoffed, affronted by Draco's blase reaction. Neville and Harry saw through the act though, because they weren't as adamant about edumacation.
"Maybe. I wouldn't go alone." Harry responded. Draco pursed his lips at that, and he narrowed his eyes at Harry. It felt like a ploy to get him to visit the giant, but Harry seemed too genuine for that to be the case.
"Right then. FORWARD!" Hagrid hoed and pointed to the castle. The fleet of little boats moved off all at once, and glided across the lake, which was as smooth as glass, betraying the enchantments placed upon its surface. Everyone was silent as they stared up at the great castle. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.
“Oh, it’s a children’s story for wizards,” Ron said, bored once he knew what it was. Harry opened the book and read a page, and was at once thoroughly confused by whatever the story was about. A children story for adults to read maybe, he didn’t know some of these words. Like degenerate. Harry saw the meaning behind the book though. A piece of the childhood Harry never got to live. It was a bittersweet gift that he loved.
“You are free to leave,” Professor Snape said, and they all rose to the occasion. “And, two weeks detention with me for even thinking of trying to face a teacher on your own.”
“Sit,” He ordered them. “No, Mr. Longbottom, he is much too smart to let something like a vampire stop him.”
“Just a squirrel and a dog,” Professor Dumbledore answered to a little tune. “Best avoid that mess.”
“We know about Fluffy.” Neville was the first to say boldly, which broke the reign of silence, and therefore the fear of speaking.
didn't want to be friends with them. The first year Slytherins had seemed very tight knit, and always seemed to welcome Draco. None of them had considered that it had been a face to the rest of the school. It was something unheard of for them.
Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep. He continued. "His name's Scabbers and he's useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a Prefect, but they couldn't aff- I mean, I got Scabbers instead."
"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting." Professor McGonagall finished. The first year body stared at her a little dazed at the information for a few short moments. Her eyes pinned down Neville's cloak, which was clasped under his left ear, and then at the smudge on Ron's nose.
"Our entrance is in the middle of a busy staircase, there's no way we could remain hidden if that was the case." Hermione said.
Well Harry didn't think he was anything. He wasn't brave or daring, or ready minded and well learnt, or cunning or patient. He liked to think himself loyal, but had never needed a reason to put that to the test, and while he wanted to find real friends, he remembered everything Hagrid had said about Slytherin. Every bad witch and wizard that ever came out of Hogwarts was a Slytherin.
He turned his body so that it faced more towards the Gryffindor table, but his head swiveled to look at the Slytherin one. He made direct eye contact with Draco, who was clearly startled by his skill in being subtle.
"What did you find, Sweet?" Filch asked his cat. They couldn't hear the cat, but they heard Filch take off after them.
"Yeah," Harry answered. Draco stared at him a little while longer, and then looked over his shoulder at Neville.
The hall was pinched with quiet laughter from the students, and he could hear a distinct ruffle noise behind him where Professor McGonagall stood as though she was trying to desperately hold in a laugh, and failing even worse than the first time.
"You've already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn't something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?" The mother asked, and suddenly Harry was happy she was their mother.
"I'm Hermione." She said, a bit calmer than he. She reached forward and grabbed his hand, and shook it once dutifully.
“Mum makes these for us every year. She always makes mine maroon. I hate maroon.” He explained. He made to set it down.
"Ye' all get yer firs' sight of Hogwarts in a sec," Hagrid called over his shoulder, "jus' round the bend here."
A few of the Slytherins sniggered behind their hands. Draco wasn't one of them, though Professor Snape didn't seem to take notice. He finished taking roll without pausing on any other student.
"Yes. I'll see you in class. Save a seat for me." Draco said. Harry felt relief that Draco was instigating the next meeting already, it meant he didn't have to flounder for an excuse to talk to him. Did friends need excuses to talk to each other?
On the day of the match, Draco had nerves biting his insides, and butterflies in his legs that made things seem surreal. The weight of knowing he'd be on the reserves instead of the stands was on him the entire day. As he got dressed his teammates gave him advice that went through one ear and out the other, because he'd heard it all before from Hermione. He thanked the genius for her advice ahead of time, because it meant he knew things the rest of the team didn't. Like a broom was always balanced, no matter where you sat on it, as long as you had one hand on it.
The Slytherins and Gryffindors went to lunch as a group, but split and went to their appropriate tables. At the end of lunch though, before the trio of Gryffindor's left, Draco joined them once more to go to Hagrid's hut.
"Now, you two, this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me you've- you've blown up a toilet or-"
"Or check to make sure the dog is still alive!" Harry whisper shouted. He didn't care what the thing was; if Professor Snape was actually the villain in this scenario, and the object was important enough to hide behind a three-headed dog, he wanted to stop Snape first.
"Mister Malfoy!" Professor McGonagall exclaimed, as if he'd been the last one she expected to speak.
"Is he your friend?" Draco asked. Harry tottered his head on his shoulders for a few seconds, and finally decided to shrug. When he'd shook hands with Hagrid the night they met, he discovered that Hagrid was a trustworthy relationship, but there was a
"Thank you." Draco replied. He turned back to the table and silently dismissed the three. They stood there a bit longer, and then they walked out of the hall to go to their common room and start on their homework.
"Trevor!" Neville cried blissfully, and held out his hands to be gifted by the giant sir. The toad fell into his hands non-gracefully, but Neville didn't seem to care. He coveted the toad as he returned to Hermione and Harry. They then scrambled up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid's lamp, and came out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle. They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak front door.
"Neville... You're not dumb. You lack some bravery to be smart, but you're not dumb." Hermione told him. Harry smiled between the two.
"You don't have to," Harry replied rather quickly. Hermione waved her hand in the air as if to bat that reply away from herself.
“Yeah. One of them at least. You can keep it if you want.” Harry offered. Ron looked gleeful over the idea, and took the muggle money with a beaming smile. In return, Ron gave Harry some of the fudge his mum made, which was very tasty.
"Something to do with a hat." Neville responded just as quietly. Trevor the toad croaked melodiously in his arms, as though confirming what Neville said.
Silence bit at the air like poison. Harry was deathly aware of Hermione waving her hand in the air, that Draco was uncomfortable, that Neville was even more terrified, and that the rest of the room was still. It was just him, and the professor who glared at him.
“Dark?” Harry asked as he uncovered a small (for what it was), shiny, gold cauldron. It looked expensive, and Harry didn’t want to imagine how much it cost. The sentiment was understood though. Harry loved potions, even if Professor Snape was a bit mean to him, and potions homework was the thing he and Draco really bonded over in the beginning. The meaning was large, even if Ron didn’t understand it.
Draco rushed through the changing room, and no one stopped him. He figured his actions made them think he was scared of the field after three of their team members went down, but that wasn't why he wanted to get in and out as quickly as possibly; he wanted to ask Hermione why in the world she set Professor Snape's robes on fire, and why Harry and Neville let her.
"It's the first chance I've had to escape my house and actually talk to any of you. Besides, we have you. I bet you could take a troll down wandlessly." Draco said to her. Hermione looked extremely surprised by what Draco said, and then she blushed furiously.
Ten minutes early became fifteen minutes late for the teacher himself, and the class became rowdy. The door burst open, which let in a cold breeze as Professor Snape stepped into the classroom. He swept past the students quickly until he reached his desk, at which point he stepped on his cloak and tripped.
"I went looking for the troll because I... Someone said I wasn't brave or smart enough to... If they hadn't found me, I'd be dead now." Draco explained quietly. "The troll came, and Harry and Neville distracted it while the other three knocked it out. They didn't have time to come and fetch anyone. If they hadn't shown up, I'd surely be dead right now.
Of course, it also woke the dog because it creaked loudly when he opened it. Not that Harry knew because he was staring down the long tunnel that was under the door. Hermione and Draco did though, and they tried to catch his attention without making too much noise.
"Can you eat it?" Harry asked. He offered the food to the ghost. The man in a ruff shook his head, and Harry set his plate back down.
"Thank you." Harry finished. Draco paused mid movement while turning the fire off. He continued the rest of the move and turned off the fire, and then he waved to Harry to put the porcupine quills into the concoction. Harry did it without a question. Draco hadn't led him astray thus far.
"He's a family friend," Draco answered nonchalantly. The Gryffindor's felt like there was more to that, but it was clear to them that this made Draco uncomfortable to say.
"Ron said no one could stand me. I thought that meant the two of you as well," Hermione explained after a bit. "I thought I had friends here, and I couldn't stand the idea that you two might just be being nice to me."
“Happy Christmas, Ron.” Harry breathed back. He reached a shaky hand for the one on top, a brown package from Hagrid. It was a whittled wooden flute, which Harry was sure Hagrid made himself. He gave it a toot. It sounded a bit like an owl.
." He heard Hermione whisper from behind him to another student. Harry found such a thing hard to believe, but there it was, right before him on the ceiling.
It brought the boys back into a safe state of mind where they didn't think of the wildest of things. Like Professor Dumbledore did it to save Professor Snape because Professor Snape made a pact he couldn't get out of unless he killed his house.
"On three." Harry whispered. The troll seemed confused by the amount of them that were there in at the moment, which they could use.
"Oh, well I thought you were another one of Fred and George's jokes," he paused. "So do you really have the, you know..." He pointed at Harry's forehead.
"Oh no, we'll be caught!" Neville bemoaned quietly as he jerked the door uselessly. Hermione took a moment to roll her eyes and then placed a hand on Neville's should to pull him away.
Professor Snape was leaning over the troll and expecting it. Professor Quirrell was against a wall and stared at the troll with a faint heart. Professor McGonagall was staring at the six students with a look so furious they were sure steam should be coming out of her ears.
Draco watched the three Gryffindors grin like idiots to each other, and he felt... Wanton. He wanted to be a part of that. It was a strange feeling to feel, because there was nothing to gain from this.
"Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?" Hagrid asked, and Neville flushed pink. He raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.
There was a loud "Oooooh!" as they rounded the bend, and the narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great Black Lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, with its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many towers.
“No,” Professor Snape answered. They looked back at him, confused. “You four are to remain out of the way.”
He picked up the item, no longer sleepy, and looked over it. His father's... this had been his father's. He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air.
They arrived to the quidditch pitch where the Slytherin's already waited. The house of green stood off to one side while the house of red stood off to the other. The green house whispered to itself, and that concerned the house of red.
As soon as Professor Snape was gone the four came out. They looked at each other, and then at the door once more.
Draco never sat at the table with them after that Friday. In fact, if anything, he seemed more distant than before. In classes he was great, and he still boasted whenever he got points or gifts, but he didn't seem too enthusiastic to hang out with the three Gryffindor's. Hermione mentioned it was probably because he lost a house point for a Gryffindor, and that put him on the Slytherin hit list for a while. It made Harry sad to think Draco was punished for helping him, so he never pushed it when Draco didn't hang out with them outside of class.
Hermione and Harry watched them go until they could no longer see them, and then they turned back to their breakfast. They talked about Herbology and the newest lesson, the fundamentals of fire making spells. A dangerous spell in Harry's opinion, but an absolutely fascinating one in Hermione's. They got into the wonders of how such a spell could work in a cold situation when Neville came back alone. Neither child questioned where Draco was, but they did notice how solemn Neville was once he had returned.
"I'll go," Draco said quietly. The three Gryffindors looked at him when he spoke, all of their smiles gone. They weren't gone for long though, and soon he was in on the idiotic smiling phase with them. It felt good to Draco to do that, but he wasn't sure why. He would do it more often though.
"Correct Mr. Malfoy," Professor Snape said. He stood back, and the entire room inhaled as one. "One point from Slytherin for speaking out of turn."
“This was my father’s...” Harry whispered. He took the cloak off and held it before him. Could it really have once been his father’s? Who sent it?
"The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rule-breaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.
"J-just now... My gran sent it." Neville answered. Draco tilted his head and looked at the ball again.
Ron's ears went pink. He seemed to think he'd said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window. Harry didn't think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, he'd never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so; all about having to wear Dudley's old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up.
Professor Dumbledore placed his hand on Harry’s back and led him out sternly. Harry could tell with just that hand that Professor Dumbledore, while he might have seemed carefree, had an urgency behind his force.
"Yeah. Just some pain when I looked at the teacher's table." Harry answered honestly. Neville looked concerned, but since Harry didn't have lasting effects from whatever had happened, he couldn't do anything.
“'Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well. A Very Happy Christmas to you', is all it says.” Ron said. Harry took the note and read the curvy scripture.
Thankfully, Professor Snape's humming had drowned out any gasps from the hidden first years. They watched as he opened the door, and within a few moments there was a loud thump behind in, which they all knew could only mean the Cerberus fell over. Professor Snape crept in after that, and closed the door behind him.
"I never learned. I never wanted to until now, but it's not like it's easy to talk to him during school." Draco responded.
The crowd of an ever shortening number of students moved, and Harry was hit with a new set of emotions. He had been zapped with numerous different emotions over the course of the evening since he'd gotten off the train, but he had learned to tune those out over the years. Whoever touched him at that moment was a different spectrum, one he couldn't ignore or turn away.
“Does this mean we’re in trouble?” Hermione asked shyly. Professor Snape stopped with his spell work, and turned around and bared down at them like a great bat.
Draco looked at Neville for a long moment, and then looked around him. He hummed and aahed for a few seconds and then he smirked triumphantly.
"I-is everything alright, Harry?" Neville asked. Harry rubbed at his scar, but what he was sure had been actual pain was gone just as soon as it had happened.
The rest of class was exceptionally tense while they made boil cure potions. It seemed like Professor Snape was looking for anything to say to deduct points from Gryffindor, but never successfully found one. Harry was sure if Draco hadn't purposely worked with him Professor Snape would have been hounding him as much as possible.
know he hates them?" Hermione asked. Draco's ears tinted pink, and he picked up a muffin just to do something with his hands.
Professor Snape did it, he just didn’t like that they were given detention for trying to help. You reward behavior like this, not punish. Though maybe Professor Snape
"I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-" the ghost began stiffly, but another boy, Seamus Finnigan, interrupted.
The class sat in silence, the students' eyes wide. "Ah, yes. Harry Potter," Professor Snape said from under his cloak. He flipped it back and set his sights on the offending person, and pushed himself off of the floor. "Our new celebrity."
"He's coming now." One of the twins said. There were several moments of silence Harry took to mean they waited for Percy.
On the way out of class Harry and Neville overheard Ron insult Hermione. It was quick, almost an off comment, but it was enough that by the time they made it to Transfiguration Hermione was gone.
Following DADA was Herbology with Ravenclaws. Professor Sprout had a name and style that screamed "plants", and was spirited enough that Harry questioned why the word spirited meant energetic if the spirits of Hogwarts tended to be apathetic. She gave attention to each student, helped them in the practical tasks of caring for plants, but also challenged them with questions. Neville perked up noticeably in this class, more confident and at ease. He seemed to know what he was doing, and Harry had a feeling that he'd end up asking Neville for help in the future.
He suddenly wished very much that he could feel his mother’s touch. She still grabbed his shoulder, and yet he felt nothing. He watched them avidly, unwilling to look away for fear he’d never see them again. He took in all he could of them before he had to leave, which came too soon at the sound of quick feet.
The first years followed Professor McGonagall down the abate stone path. The buzz of what could easily be over a hundred voices sounded from a door to the right, where the school body must already be, but Professor McGonagall led them into a small desolate chamber off the hall. They all huddled into the room, closely packed together, much closer than they would have liked. Harry felt more of the familiar zaps of future emotions, and he tried to seclude himself behind Hermione and Neville. Someone he'd touched was going to have a sour future with him very soon, and he didn't want that feeling riding in his head. Professor McGonagall turned towards the group of first years and stared at them all intently, commanding their attention.
"Hmm," said a small voice in his head. "Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There's talent, oh my goodness, yes- and a nice thirst to prove yourself... Now that's interesting... You can see the future of yourself with others, that'll make your friendships very hard... So where shall I put you?"
"Where is he?" Hermione asked, confused as to why the troll was missing of all things. He'd always told them to be punctual.
"Future emotions?" Neville asked loudly. He didn't blush, as past experiences would have led Harry to believe. He seemed too startled to think to do such a thing.
"You forgot your cloak!" Draco told them. Hermione and Harry looked at Neville's clothes and found- yes, he was missing them. They hadn't noticed because his uniform was also black.
One evening, Harry, Hermione, and Neville were out trying to find the opening to the Slytherin's room to ask Draco what was wrong one last time. With what mediocre knowledge they had of Hogwarts, they wandered the corridors. They didn't know whether they should go up or down to find the room, but figured it had to be behind a painting like theirs. They started near their common room, and then began to branch out.
to go up and help. He didn't have to, he could have stayed on the ground and remained with his house. It had been Draco's choice to help Neville, not Neville's choice for Draco to help him.
A few minutes before class started Draco broke from the Slytherin group and walked towards the Gryffindors. In his hand, which he tossed carelessly now, was Neville's remembrall. He swaggered to the Gryffindors, and at the front of the group was Neville, who had walked forwards to take the remembrall back. Draco didn't give it back though, he continued to toss it in midair.
"Wow." Ron said, and sat back with an awed expression. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again.
“I see socks,” He said finally. Harry wondered if he was lying, because it sounded like a funny want. “Long wool socks of all colors and shapes. You can never have too many of them.”
"We'll see you at the Gryffindor table in the morning?" Harry asked hopefully. Draco looked over at Pansy and Blaise, who didn't make any moves to say yes or no.
Along the way they came across Hermione Granger and Parvati Patil, who were also on their way out of the common room. Hermione greeted Harry with a smile he didn't think he deserved yet, and happily showed the three boys where to go. Surprisingly, though if Hermione was as smart Harry thought, not at all surprisingly, Hermione knew every turn and hallway to get back to the hall. It was a long walk, and one that required many grabs to save each other -some of the stairs were missing
An hour later Gryffindor found the snitch and the game ended, with 120-200. The teams flew to the floor and unmounted their brooms as quickly as their sore hinnies could. Draco had the odd experience of high fiving the Gryffindor's and knowing a few of them enough that they could congratulate him personally. For example, the Weasley Twins, who high fived him and grabbed his hand like they were holding hands. They proceeded not to let go until Draco said the magic word, which happened to be Merlin.
Draco flinched at those words, and he looked down at the table. The Slytherins on his side of the room grumbled at him, but it was too quiet for Harry to hear.
"I'm Harry Potter." Harry responded and thrusted his hand out. He then mentally slapped himself, because the ghost probably knew who he was.
The next morning Harry woke up bright and early alongside with a few other members of his dorm. Neville Longbottom, who was too anxiety ridden to not wake up before six; and Dean Thomas, who was used to getting up early naturally. Seamus Finnigan and Ron Weasley slept in until Harry was done in the shower. Neither of the boys asked for them to wait, so Harry walked off with Neville and Dean in a blatant, sad attempt to find the Grand Hall from the night before.
Here's the first chapter to a story my sis and I have been working on for a few years. Hope you enjoyed it. R&R if you please, and kudos give us life.
"I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don't you dare. As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school." She said. Harry paused for a moment, and he wondered if he did remember the night. If he did, he had no idea.
Squirrel? Dog? Mess? Quirrell! Professor Quirrell had tried to go after the Philosopher’s Stone that evening. It was exactly like they expected. Except Professor Snape had put alerts up. They’d caught the DADA teacher in the act. The stone was safe.
"GRYFFINDOR!" The hat shouted not too long after. Hermione jumped up and off to the table of Red and Gold with a beaming smile, where Percy Weasley was there to greet her.
"Oy, you there! Is this your toad?" Hagrid asked, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them.
?" Draco asked. Some of the people from his group finally noticed he'd disappeared, and two bulky looking kids came back their way. Harry wondered if his time was limited with Draco then.
Draco found that Dean was interesting to talk to, if Seamus had his wand out to duck and cover, Parvati had a twin in Ravenclaw named Padma, Lavender was a bit of a gossiper, Hermione was a lecturer, Ron was big into Quidditch and eating, Neville was a blushing mess through most of eating, and Harry was far more quiet than he'd expected.
Harry, now alone with people he didn't know, counted down until it was his name that was called. "MacDougal, Morag!"
“Are we in trouble?” Draco asked. Professor Snape looked between the four for a long moment. He seemed very put upon that they knew so much, and they were sure had Draco not been there he would have chewed them into the next school year. As it was, Draco was a part of their group, and he was to protect Draco.
"Come along now," said a sharp voice, which startled students and ghosts alike. "The Sorting Ceremony is about to start."
A whistle sounded. Harry looked up at the ceiling like that was where the sound came from. He felt a flood of relief fill him, and a sense of reality appeared. This was actually happening. He was actually on a train, to a school he knew nothing about besides it was a magic school. This was happening.
