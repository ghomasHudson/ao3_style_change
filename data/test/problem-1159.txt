go well!
But now the lesson was over and Draco let Feykir walk through the hall on yielded reins. To Harry's right and left, the four others resumed their everyday conversations. Instead of participating, Harry got up from the bench and leaned over the fence to watch Draco riding.
Nervousness dominated Harry's steps but he kept walking until he dropped to his knees before Draco. He kept his distance, he wasn't foolish enough to impose his closeness now. He could hear his own breath rattle, too loud for the silence of the forest. Draco clenched his jaw, wrapped his arms more firmly around his legs, but didn't retreat. Harry almost sighed with relief.
Harry's mind is reeling and he has to scramble to get a proper sentence together. "But ... what does that mean?"
His powers would fade… what powers? The power to charm others? Or the power to force people to move. Harry already had his theory about how Draco did it. After all, he was able to control water on a small scale without a wand, including the water in a human body. So when Draco commanded the water in Harry’s left leg to come in his direction and Harry didn’t comply with that request, it hurt. The perfect way to get Harry to come. Yes, Harry was proud of that theory, but it was yet to be confirmed by Draco.
like him. Sometimes, Harry worried for no reason at all.

. "Isn't that kind of degrading to Hermione?" And Draco, but he was sure Ron wouldn't be particularly interested in Draco's dignity.
than he had been a few minutes ago. It still didn't look healthy. Ron held on quite tight to his saddle and reins as he was thrown up and down on the back of the pony. The abstruse image was surpassed by Ron's beaming smile. Harry bit his tongue hard to keep from laughing at him.
“Next time we’ll go to a wine tasting, maybe that will meet your standards!” With this, Harry clinked his glass against Draco’s and emptied the glass at one swallow. The liquid burned Harry’s mouth and throat and made him cough up in a frenzy while he felt his stomach already rebelling. Draco’s facial expression resembled Harry’s very much, which made him laugh throatily.
Draco's quick breath close to his ear and the blond hair tickled Harry at the tip of his nose. He felt a hand on his shoulder, Seamus congratulating their victory, then the hand was gone again and Harry remembered to let go.
It was already evening. Harry lay stretched out on his bed, nibbling on an apple and studying the Marauder’s Map, as he did every evening these days. Meanwhile, Ron paced up and down near his bed, put on his pyjamas, collected the school supplies for the next morning and cursed quietly.
"Morning," Harry greeted Blaise and Draco, to whose table he had dragged Ron. They nodded and Blaise even moved aside a bit to make room for Ron. Harry sat down next to Draco and looked at the blond briefly.
"I – We ..." Harry falters, throwing an uncertain look at Jimar, who is staring intently at one of the walls, and finally pulls himself together. "We are sorry to inform you that your mother has passed away."

," Harry groaned instantly in disbelief, slapping his palm against his forehead. "They're going to
Draco lay on his side, turned away from Harry, his legs wrapped around the blanket, which he thus claimed completely for himself, his blond braided hair falling over his shoulder. Harry's gaze travelled down on Draco, his sleeping shirt had ridden up a little and exposed a strip of pale skin just above his waistband. Harry's breath faltered, his hand automatically moved to Draco's waist and he turned to his side to press his upper body against Draco's back.
Harry approaches Malfoy and kneels in front of him. It seems too intimate for him to sit next to him and if he has learnt anything about Malfoy, it is that he has yet to earn his trust.
Harry grins. "You're wrong to be sceptical. Muggles are heavily into it."
He had grown. Had discovered that being brave wasn't shameful and, after a bit of getting used to it, he even enjoyed it. It had been nerve-wracking at first, but in the end, his newfound courage had opened more doors for him than his cowardice had done in seventeen years.
I swallowed. "Ten weeks."
The least and everything Harry had.
Harry leans back slightly in his chair, nods in agreement and looks at the short wizard. The only question that comes to his mind is why he was not told right away. Perhaps the Healers objected. Still, he would have agreed to help significantly quicker had he known he could do the Aurors a favour.
Thoughtfully, Luna spins her wand on the tabletop in front of her.  "Of course, it's just memories, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?"
to label people 'worthless' or 'slut'. You can't expect me to cut capers when he treats Hermione like that!"
Oh, what an absolute disaster!
Option number 4: There
Before Harry could even ask or do anything at all, Draco's face cleared, he whispered another spell, then dropped his wand on the sheet, shifted closer to Harry again and kissed him tenderly on the corner of his mouth. The whole thing had certainly happened too fast for Harry, which only added to his mental overload.
"We will talk about this, Harry James Potter, even if I have to force every word out of your confounded mouth!"
"I can't –"
, at best impressed, and third, I told you about the nicknames in
Harry turned the pages, drawings of Feykir followed, of his ears, his mane, his legs, Harry smiled. Draco truly adored this pony. Then there were sketches of people. Some of them were incomplete, sometimes Draco had only worked out one feature in particular. Harry recognized Draco's friends, Pansy, Blaise, Theo, but also unknown faces, Harry assumed that they were other friends. At wild curls, Harry paused in surprise. Hermione? Harry flipped the page and his chest suddenly became tight. Viktor.
"I seem to have expressed myself in a misleading way last time," Malfoy's cool voice rose just inches behind me. "Or you're just daft."
"Okay. We'll just... continue this later. I just need –" Harry faltered. He could hardly solve this problem like he usually would, that’d be a bit too much. But with half an erection between his legs, he didn't want to have lunch. Harry sat up, Draco retreated willingly and watched Harry with deep creases between his brows.
I did not know why I placed my hope in Malfoy's humanity and compassion. But perhaps he did possess the faintest shred of moral courage and would be persuaded by my words. Miracles happened every day, and I lacked better ideas.
"No," Draco replies with fiery determination in his voice. "Not anymore."
“For Mother, it was all the same, she just wanted to save me from my fate. In her last letter, she assured me that father now shares her view. It’s fairly late for me to be accepted by my father.” Draco laughed dryly. It sounded more like a dismal gasp.
Harry missed Draco with such intensity that he sometimes became afraid of it. Everything in him longed for him and every look at the Slytherin table made it just harder to resist the desire and to be patient. He had forced himself to think. About everything that had happened, about everything that might come and one thing was certain. He wanted Draco to be part of his future. Even weeks after their adventure, Harry’s heart still belonged to the Slytherin. The feelings hadn’t just come from the curse, they hadn’t stopped, and he was ready to tell him so. Only when? Draco needed time as much as Harry did, so how was he supposed to know if the time had come to do something?
Harry frowned. “A tata – What?”
Despite the fact that they didn’t talk about the curse, Draco didn’t seem so bleak anymore. Harry’s presence alone seemed to really help him, to have a little hope that out of nowhere they could come up with something useful after all. And that was enough incentive for Harry to give up enough sleep and spend his nights on the fifth floor with Draco. Not that he needed this incentive, he probably would have gone to him even without Draco’s approval.
"I'm listening."
"Your pony has to carry you up a mountain at walk. You could certainly relieve her a little!"
So instead of running after Draco, Harry took Neville to the nearby bathroom, sat him down in front of the loo and leaned against the door frame, blocking out the sound of Neville emptying his stomach as best as he could. Harry was angry with himself; he hadn’t minded at all when Draco had looked after Neville, but that Viktor bloke... Harry clenched his hands into fists and concentrated on slow and steady breaths.
With a relieved sigh, Draco stepped under the jet of water and flinched back at once. "Fuck, you want to go into cold shock?" He hurriedly reached for the tap and set the temperature to
“If you don't tell me, then I'll have to go ba–” Harry began. He meant it honestly, didn't want to threaten Draco, just wanted to know what was going on.
A deep groan echoed at Harry's ear, Draco's body tensed for a split second and relaxed again. "Right there," he gasped, and before Harry could make up his mind, Draco pressed his lips pleadingly against Harry's, thrusting his tongue into his mouth and moving his hips against Harry's.
That is a lie. Anja has another theory, but it is not one she dares to voice.
Harry knows what Robards is getting at and finally raises the question that has been on the tip of his tongue since his first conversation with Filly. "How would Malfoy know all these names and cases? His father certainly knew more than enough about them, if he wasn't even involved – But Malfoy? He was just a child at the time, wasn't he?"
the fuck would –"
What ensued was a horrified uproar from the magical population of Britain.
Draco didn't hesitate, let go of Harry's hair and accepted the invitation without question. Harry scooted aside as far as he could, the beds were narrow and Draco's body radiated an alluring coolness. The blond turned to Harry, nudged Harry's nose with his own and let his hand slide back into Harry's hair. Slowly, Harry reached for Draco's waist, stroking gently over the cool fabric. Draco reacted immediately, pushing his body closer to Harry's and sighed comfortably.
“If you ask me, the guy is totally in love with you, or I’ll eat my broom,” Ron said. Harry let himself fall back onto his pillow with a frustrated sigh. That didn’t help. Ron didn’t help. Hermione didn’t help. Talking didn’t help. The burning in his chest just didn’t go away and the queasy feeling in his stomach area even less.
"I know he can be
"Let it happen," Ron muttered. Harry raised his head to look at his best friend and frowned. "No one likes to be vulnerable, Harry. But if you want to save this thing between you two, you have no choice but to be honest."
Oh. my. god. freaking FINALLY! Took them long enough! I screamed at them cause they're so SLOW! (This is a falling hard and fast story, not a bloooody slow burn) but we got there EVENTUALLY! XD
I nodded and felt myself shaking my head in confusion the next moment. "Yes, I know that, but what do they have to do with each other?"
“And how does the curse work? Every time you touch water, you turn into a ‘waterspirit-like being'?” Harry asked, interrupting Draco.
"Her name is Katla," Draco began to explain, while he put a halter on a maroon-coloured mare. "She’s Nott's pony, but she lost a horseshoe yesterday. Hence the farrier."
Looking at the spot where Draco’s wound must be, Harry sighed. Winning the argument would cost a lot, maybe he should just drop it. “You act like I have nothing to do with this, but ever since we found out I’m your bloody saviour, I’m more involved than you might like me to be.”
In his short breaks, which he takes in spite of everything, Harry spends time playing with George and Angelina's son Fred. At the age of three, he already enjoys charming everything and everyone around him. And in the most literal way. Harry spends most of his time with Fred trying to undo his magic. Although he leaves the bright pink fingernails untouched, which delights the little boy. The spell lasts for three days.
"Fingers?" Harry asked without thinking and immediately regretted not being able to keep his mouth shut. But Seamus had once told him about fingers and it hadn't sounded too unrealistic.
He could feel the throbbing between his legs, was only seconds away from whimpering for release, but he bit his tongue. He listened to the sound of a tube being opened, Draco bent Harry's knee, certainly but gently, and then there was something cool and slippery on Harry's cock that made him gasp.
"It's actually you!" Jimar states as he comes to a halt in front of Harry, his grin growing bigger. "You want me to comment first on you disappearing into thin air for two months, or compliment your new hairstyle?"
Ron and Hermione each knew Sirius already and quickly started a conversation with the sociable man as they strolled with him to the guesthouse. Harry unintentionally let himself fall back a bit, watched Hedwig, who curiously explored the new surroundings, and smiled contentedly. He felt Draco's presence at his side, warmly reminding him that the world could be a bloody good place.
Poising his fingers, Harry kissed gently along Draco’s cock to give his jaw a break for a few seconds. He felt his cheeks burn with excitement and the painful stirring in his groin.
wanted to re-insure. “So there is a way out for Draco? And you guarantee to tell me if I bring you the ring for one night?”
, he's –"
Harry hesitated, remembering vaguely that Daphne had a younger sister, but for the life of him, he couldn't remember her name. “Davis?”
"I hope you’re aware that you're mental," was all Harry said, he tightened the grip around Draco's wrist and pulled him forward with a firm step. Draco whimpered, but then he let himself be dragged along. Harry was sure Draco was suffering from delusions. How could anyone
Surprised by Draco’s admonitory tone, Harry perplexedly let himself be pushed away by Draco and also let his hand slide out of the blond’s hair. Oh, he’d grabbed it a little too tight. But Draco looked so wonderfully hot, with his flushed cheeks and swollen lips, there was no holding back.
"Don't tell him I'm the one who enters the book," Harry replies eventually and looks at the Healer, feeling fatigued. He feels like he ran a marathon. It’s probably the many, new experiences that are taking their effect on him. "We don't share a particularly pleasant past."
Harry was quicker on his feet than ever before and grabbed Draco’s wrist. “You can’t just leave now! Let’s talk about it again, I’m sure we can find a compromise!”
Draco's breath on his skin and he lost all ability to think logically. "Next time, tell that to
Ron hurriedly shoved his toast in his mouth and pretended that none of this had anything to do with him. Hermione turned pale and shot a panicked look at Harry, who was glaring daggers at Ron.
You know I'm right, Zabini. This man deserves it."
“I'll put us all up for a night of your choosing, but you have to tell me the goddamn password!” Ron would never refuse, not when it came to a night with Hermione.
The thing about guilt is more complicated than you might imagine. Sometimes guilt is easy to understand. It's easy to blame someone for your mistakes. It's easy to feel guilty when you see the heart of a loved one broken over something you ruined. It's easy to admit guilt when you possess a hint of self-reflection and the tendencies of a moral compass.
“Then why wasn’t Harry under the spell? If it, as you say, could’ve happened to anyone?” Ron had a point, so far Hermione hadn’t come up with a good answer for that, so she kept eating her lunch. There was no point in worrying about it, as long as Draco was being stubborn, they wouldn’t know anything about it anyway.
“Oh, don't worry, I already regret my selfless decision every passing second!” Draco growled, glaring at Harry.
As so often, it was Draco who relieved me of the burden I was placing on myself and began to speak. "At least you got rid of the mess on your head. It took on such drastic proportions that the term 'bird's nest' couldn't do it justice any longer."
A quiet smile settles on Draco's lips, it appears nearly
In the end, Draco's ambition triumphed. Five more minutes passed, Harry almost dozed off again, then Draco rolled off him all of a sudden. Puzzled by the lack of heat, Harry sat up. Someone put his glasses on and before Harry could react, Draco slipped out of Harry's bed and walked towards his own.
They both had to wait long enough for this embrace.
"Pardon?" Draco asked with as much composure as he could gather.
we started, Weasley!"
Harry was breathless, staring wide-eyed at long, pale fingers with carefully filed fingernails which worked their way down the button facing of his shirt in a steady rhythm, gradually revealing more naked skin. Harry peered up and into Draco's eyes, which were watching him closely. Draco licked his lips, smiled lightly and heated, and drew Harry closer again. Kissing was safe territory, so Harry instantly engaged in it.
to turn Draco into a normally functioning human being again. And the quickest way to do that was to break the curse. Finally, his mind was in agreement with his
Harry didn't dare to open his eyes but he could feel Draco's body heat, the hair tickling his cheek as soon as Draco was at eye level with him. Harry's lips found Draco's, he desperately sucked on his tongue, felt his legs tremble with anticipation. Draco's free hand found Harry's cheek, he caressed it soothingly and then Draco pressed a finger against Harry's hole and sank into the depth.
Draco had even warned him; this had been their first official meeting in the bathroom and Harry still remembered exactly that he had assumed Draco was joking. But that hadn’t been a joke, Draco had of course known the first lines of his curse and had been taken aback by Harry’s lack of reaction. Why he had left it with a shrug, Harry didn’t know. Perhaps he had never met anyone outside the healing context except Harry, and he didn’t know how extreme his mer-creature charm was to others. After this morning, though – no wonder Draco was so upset. He had now also realised it.
Harry nods, overwhelmed.
“Then who?”
"You would have withdrawn the special authorisation," he surmises, and as Robards remains deliberately silent, he feels confirmed in his theory. He does not even start to assess the feelings this fact evokes inside him and instead continues to speak. "Actually, I came here because I don't know how to gain the information. Malfoy ... isn't particularly compliant."
"I think I got a cramp in my thigh," Draco whispered suddenly, almost reproachfully. Harry laughed, felt for Draco's thigh with his free hand and pulled the hollow of his knee closer to him so he could massage him unhindered. Draco sighed contentedly and pressed his nose against Harry's neck. "You smell of sex," he noted mumbling, shoving his hand into dark hair and imitated Harry's massage movement there.
Nothing seemed to give her more pleasure than pestering Harry and making fun of him. Draco,
Uncertain whether to push Draco against the cool sheet again or how to proceed at all, Harry stayed in place, his hands resting on Draco's sides left and right, his thumbs slowly circling and he concentrated solely on the wet tongue huddling against his own. Unimpressed by Harry's stiffness, Draco shifted closer on his knees to urge their bodies against each other, shoving a bent leg between Harry's, successfully stirring the blood in Harry's crotch once more.
Harry's gaze fell on Draco's lips. They looked at least as soft as they felt. "Maybe you two have a spiritual bond. If you hurt yourself, he hurts himself too."
was really embarrassing. But then Harry changed his mind and avoided Draco’s eyes. One way or the other, he had achieved what he had wanted to achieve, the rest shouldn’t matter.
“Aren’t you worried about your aloof image? Mr Ice-block himself is whispering sweet nothings! That too with his former nemesis! Where does this change of heart come from?” Harry scoffed, with a slight, somewhat reserved smile on his lips.
that it’s not that simple. I was born with this curse, all my life I’ve been able to prepare for this day, what you’re about to do is a mere displacement act. You’d be risking
Draco gave Harry another doubtful look, then he returned the smile tentatively and walked through the door with more or less firm steps. Harry followed him at a reasonable distance.
"And if I do?" Harry asks, glaring angrily at Hermione. He does not understand why she thinks she has the right to illustrate his world to him.
Viktor, whom Draco had met through his passion for horses and who had spent a summer with Draco on Weeping Willow Farmstead two years ago. It wasn't too unrealistic, was it? Not when considering how Draco reacted as soon as he was mentioned and the confidence with which he handled
Draco looked at Harry in disbelief. He seemed to regard Harry's announcement as a threat, whereas it was only supposed to be a request, wrapped in a threat. “You owe me a life debt,” Draco said, the fingers clenching his upper arm due to his restrained anger.
my arse! I rather think you seduced me with your Slytherin games and
That is as far as Filly gets, Harry is already jumping to his feet and grabbing the short wizard by the shoulders. "Tell me where he is, now!"
The tingling sensation on Harry's skin sank into his blood and made it boil with Draco's touch. He sank further back, stretched his legs under Draco's, made room for him to lie completely on top of him and between his legs. A sigh escaped Draco's lips, Harry caught it greedily, barely stopped himself from moaning.
"Please," Harry pleads against Draco's neck, the heat clouding his mind. "Let me be close to you."
"Come and visit me sometime if you get the chance," Jimar bids Harry farewell, patting him on the back amicably. "I'm only a Portkey trip away."
Clenching his hands firmly around the handles of the wheelchair, he pushes Draco onwards and only seconds later finds himself in front of the dilapidated department store 'Purge and Dowse Ltd', not far from where the cab he called for is already waiting. Harry throws a sceptical glance behind him, but there is only the mannequin looking at him almost questioningly. In the end, it is Draco's soft murmur, rather reminiscent of a shiver, that causes Harry to hurry down the street, lit only by lanterns, towards the cab.
Draco sighed, running his fingers through his blond hair and after what felt like an eternity, let go of Harry's aching wrist. “All right, play along now, Potter! What would you call the shape that I embody in the water?”
," Harry mumbles, realising that Ron does not seem to understand the crux of his problem. Obviously, he wants to be able to help and his helpfulness, as well as his effectiveness, would dwindle all the more with the termination of the diary project, but that is not all. He does not want to lose
I rotated so that I could keep an eye on him.
Thank you for reading it. It means a lot!
As if struck by lightning, Draco suddenly got up. “Oh, bloody fuck! We’re missing breakfast! Get cracking, I’m not one to let my lovers starve!”
On the second Saturday, Harry visits Teddy at his home and they play hairdresser. Teddy displays amazing talent, so he promptly throws his doll aside and continues to practise on Harry's hair. Andromeda lets out a horrified scream when she enters the room, but Harry is unruffled. The long hair has been bothering him for a while anyway and a minor physical alteration never hurt anyone. Nevertheless, he stops by an actual hair salon after his visit to have Teddy's masterpiece slightly tweaked.
Harry wasn't sure what to think. That Draco had always been a beauty, he was happy to believe, but the rest was much more likely to bother him. Had Hermione and Viktor been in a relationship? Had Viktor cheated on Hermione with Draco? And Draco had only done it because he had been jealous of Hermione?
Harry couldn’t quite hide his grin, so he bit his lips. Draco’s eyes flitted to Harry’s lips for a split second, then he took a step back. Harry just followed him. Before, he had always run away, now he wouldn’t let Draco follow in his footsteps. “Yeah, going out. You know, a date, which is what people our age do.”
“Do I need to define the term homosexuality for you, or can you do it on your own?” Draco sounded mocking, but also a bit rushed as if he himself couldn't believe that he had just told Harry about it. He also continued to write, but Harry was very sure that Draco had just written “sosialey asseptabel worms of konvlict resulotiunc” instead of “socially acceptable forms of conflict resolutions”, which he noticed just at that moment and crossed it out, quietly cursing.
The surprise activity turned out to be paint. More precisely finger paint. Even more precisely finger paint, which was suitable for horse coat. ("And was produced purely plant-based, everything completely biodegradable. You could theoretically eat it and it would do no harm!", why one would want to eat finger paint, Hermione forgot to mention in her enthusiasm). Their task was to paint one of their team ponies as beautiful or crazy as possible. The pony that was chosen as the most beautiful in the end won a whole 30 horseshoe points.
She pauses for a bit and Harry climbs off his stepladder to lean against the façade to look at Nellie.
Harry bit back a comment and eyed the Slytherin instead. He wasn’t wearing pyjamas, but black, slim-fit cloth trousers and a thin black turtleneck sweater. Why Draco was in full gear in the middle of the night, Harry honestly didn't want to know. Nevertheless, Draco's disparaging look at his pyjamas made Harry pull his robe tighter around him.
Like a bolt of lightning, Harry is struck by the memory of how he wrote down this note to himself. Of how he returned the Elder Wand to Dumbledore's Tomb and how he told those he could not trust and asked about it that he had destroyed it. Of how his paranoia and panic attacks were fuelled by the fear of accidentally revealing its location and thus being responsible for a dark wizard taking the wand. Of how he met Nellie, learnt her history with Dumbledore and gave her his trust. Of how he chose her, for an infinite number of reasons, and made her a Secret-Keeper without her knowledge. Of how he subsequently obscured his memories of the Elder Wand's whereabouts, leaving only the lemon tartlets as a clue.
Harry has not a clue what Robards is talking about, therefore he returns the handshake and then makes a hasty exit. An ordinary day's work awaits him, which should keep him somewhat occupied for the time being.
Draco moaned, his hands clasped the nape of Harry's neck and he wrapped his legs around Harry's hips. The blood in Harry's veins was boiling, he let go of the blond hair, instead grabbed Draco's thighs with both hands, positioned them under Draco's bottom so that he was lifted a little bit out of the water and Harry had to crane his neck to keep kissing Draco. He felt cool, wet fingers on his cheek, the quick breath of Draco on his lips and the adrenaline shooting through his body.
imposed on him?"
He thought about the fact that he was going back to London. Alone. He had been aware of this before the disaster, but he had pushed the thought so far into the distance that he had almost forgotten it. It was terrifying because even if Draco would consider forgiving Harry, it didn't mean that he would do it before Harry was forced to leave.
He would not admit defeat so easily. He would not fall between the clutches of this monster without fighting back.
Harry was his
A slight twitch of Draco's eyes indicates that he has to fight to continue to hold Harry's gaze. It is not hard to realise that Draco has made sense of Harry's feelings. He is clever enough and, above all, he knows himself. He was once the one Harry met. The only part missing from his picture of the past few months is how Harry fits in there.
He would love to scratch Pup between the ears right now and have one last cup of tea before bed.
already told you today that you're terrible?"
“Heyyy,” Harry said slowly, wanting to slap himself in the face for acting so insecure.
"– It’s me," Hermione finishes Ron's sentence and neatly places her fork next to her not yet finished plate filled with Lancashire Hotpot. "Harry, feelings like that aren't a minor issue that you should sweep under the carpet."
Harry didn’t want to sound like he was defending himself, even if he was. Draco hadn’t yet agreed, which put Harry under enormous pressure. A simple yes couldn’t be that hard to get across. With his hands buried in his jeans pockets, Harry wondered if his mind was right after all and Draco had nothing more than a pejorative look for him.
obvious when the two of them even spoke to him about it. How does one tell one’s best friends that one was absolutely unwilling to talk about one’s first time, which would also save one’s partner from an eternal curse, an eternal curse that one had put on oneself and from which one had to be saved as well? “Okay, thank you.”
Harry feels the need to scream, to force Draco to finally listen to him properly and make him see reason, but he does nothing of the sort. Instead, he wraps his arms around Draco, pulls him close, buries his nose in his neck and memorises the warmth in its entirety. As Draco tentatively wraps his arms around Harry as well, he realises that Draco was not only asking this question for himself. He was asking it just as much for Harry.
While Draco was still shoving his wand under a pillow again, Harry drew himself closer to him, then nestled against his chest uninvited, wrapped one arm around his stomach and closed his eyes contentedly. Draco made a small surprised sound, but then wound one arm around Harry, the other hand finding Harry's on his stomach. He interweaved their fingers, sighed softly and placed a small kiss on his head.
Malfoy has already agreed after Healer Isaksen had a long talk with him, but it feels wrong not to ask Malfoy's permission one more time. He has made too many mistakes in the past when dealing with Malfoy, he wants to avoid putting his foot in his mouth once again.
, of course, Harry was no less of a virgin than Draco.

“You have no idea what the consequences would be. I can’t accept that,” Draco continued. He sounded as if he had rehearsed the sentence in order not to ungratefully snub Harry, but at the same time to make it clear to him that he had just been rejected.
Harry slowly became nervous as well, though he made a noticeable effort to wait patiently. This seemed rather serious. Was this about them? Was this about the
Draco rolled his eyes and shook his head, but a soft smile tugged at the corners of his mouth. "I
years, get the hell over it!"
"I thought the only advantage of living with a man who doesn't care about personal hygiene is that the bathroom isn't occupied all the time," Draco complained, his voice sounding much friendlier when filtered through the wooden door and the water noise.
A breeze swept a few flower petals across the lake, causing them to swirl and dance before it vanished again into nothingness. Looking like tiny ships, the petals floated on the surface of the water towards the middle of the lake. Another breeze took hold of them and carried them towards the shore. There the game started all over again.
"Mr Waters was arrested and escorted away by Aurors at the beginning of his shift yesterday morning," she begins without mincing words, as soon as she has sat down opposite Harry.
Malfoy straightened his legs, dangling them from his rock, and casually leaned backwards, resting his weight on his palms. "Interest. I've found that the answer can reveal quite a lot about a person."
With his heart pounding fiercely, Harry realises that there is nothing between them anymore.
But Seamus and Dean already burst out laughing, the others joined no less enthusiastically. Harry bit his tongue hard so as not to laugh along. The containing apparently didn't work perfectly, Draco glared at him angrily with red cheeks. Harry grinned innocently and continued to pet Draco's hair.
Harry and Draco took their time on the way to Hogsmeade. It wasn’t dark yet, thanks to the long evenings of the summer, so it didn’t feel as if curfew was about to begin. Draco didn’t say much, neither did Harry. The silence was a bit strange but surprisingly pleasant in spite of everything. Draco’s cool hand in Harry’s made the situation even more bearable than it already was.

"I've had as many as three reporters ask me about my hair care routine and as many as five – let me repeat that explicitly:
"We don’t have any riding lessons on weekends, so partying has become kind of a tradition. It started with beer and champagne –"
mum was bad."
was without question the understatement of the century.
“No, I thought I'd take advantage of the benefits of a pool and swim a lap,” Harry explained as he stepped closer to the pool.
Draco raised an eyebrow as if he didn't quite trust Harry, then something warm twinkled in his eyes and he kissed Harry again. Tenderly and lovingly and just the way Harry wanted to be kissed forever. There was no doubt, the relationship would work out. He couldn't imagine ever letting go of the blond, his heart had long been lost.
Harry first stared at the spot where the net had been visible a moment ago, then he looked into Draco's eyes. "Would it be rude to say I'd rather see you with your clothes off?"
But then Draco rose, his eyes looking everywhere but at Harry, and walked past him without another word. For a moment, Harry was so perplexed that he just stood there as if rooted to the spot, but then he hurried, half stumbling after Draco to the entrance. Shit, he hadn’t asked him out yet, but Draco would at least talk to him. Even if now the vicious gossip about the two of them would never stop.
And suddenly Harry saw it more clearly than ever before. It wasn't about Draco forgiving him. It was more about Draco knowing the truth so he could come clean with himself.
Harry stiffened instantly. That was impossible, there was no way he could see him! The invisibility cloak had
"All right, whatever," Harry agreed, even though the unpleasant feeling of making a mistake with this didn’t leave him.
A joke. It had only been a joke.
Now even Ron puts his peeler aside and turns to the action with interest.
"Most Icelandic horses, in addition to the three standard gaits of walk, trot and canter, are also proficient in tölt and flying pace. Hetja usually has a very clear tölt, you’ll like it. Feels like riding a rocking horse," explained Draco and even spared any comment about Harry's lack of knowledge.
That was it? Didn’t the Malfoys have any remaining hope that Draco could break the curse after all? At Malfoy Manor, the chance of that was much smaller than here at Hogwarts. Harry understood why Draco hadn’t followed the will of his parents. It was like waiting for one’s own death, whose date was predetermined.
Harry honestly didn't know what possessed him to say
He tightly clutches the letter from the Ministry, signed by Gawain Robards himself, and approaches the offices of Auror Headquarters. Just last Friday, as soon as Harry entered his flat, he sat down to write a letter to the head of the Auror Office requesting an appointment. He is only too aware of the fact that he does not have enough experience to convince Malfoy to cooperate without help. If he is to assist the Aurors, he needs more clues. And that is why he is here now.
was all right. I had opened my mind to something that turned out to be nothing but a figment of my imagination. How was I to know that I was not simply fantasising all this? If the book was a Horcrux, it had the power to deceive me. I felt my grip on Malfoy's collar tighten.
Harry shakes his head.
Draco's gaze, sweeping serenely through the shop, catches Harry's and a smile lights up the wizard's face.
When Harry once more thrust his tongue particularly deep in Draco, he moaned and pushed Harry away using his foot. "Fucking hell, if you don't put your dick inside me in the next ten seconds, I’ll –"
Draco looks intently at his face and places his hand in Harry's. "The spell created a stronger bond whenever I cast it together with my mother. Although, for our purposes, that may not be necessary."
Harry watched as three light-blond strands of hair came loose from Draco's ponytail in slow motion and fell into his face. Draco ignored the first two. The third he tucked behind his ear, then he lifted his head and returned Harry's gaze.
"You never came."
Draco's breath faltered, his eyes flared, but he didn't move away anymore. Instead, he pressed his upper body closer to Harry's and moved towards him until the tips of their noses almost met. Harry's gaze fell on Draco's lips,
THERE'S EVEN MORE ART GUYS! The second commission piece is from Chapter 4, can be found on
, but something inside him made it hard not to throw himself between Draco and his father. The tension was already palpable in the air, whether he was the target of Mr Malfoy's piercing gaze or Draco didn’t make a difference. Ron looked at Harry across the table with wide eyes, what Blaise and Draco thought, Harry preferred not to know at all.
Draco sighed and laid his head on his left forearm. “They want me to come home to spend my last days as a human with them.”
"You won't leave me alone just yet, right?"
Sure, he was approaching his thirties, which some would call "
“What is it, then?” Harry asked, who wanted to believe Draco but couldn’t. What was bad enough that one would prefer a life in damp darkness? In damp and lonely darkness, mind you.
Malfoy's smirk broadened into a grin. "You've gotten old."
Draco's jaw clenched in an instant, but instead of looking at Hermione, he looked at Harry. "How much do you care about winning, Potter?"
And then Draco kissed Harry. He tasted of toothpaste, a touch of alcohol, and overall just perfect. The sensation of goosebumps ran through Harry's body, he drew Draco closer to the kiss. His other hand found soft hair. He could feel the shape of the braid, felt the loose strands and buried his hand in it.
“Something’s happened,” Harry admitted sheepishly. His head hurt, he had been lying awake half the night after the incident and had been racking his brain over it.
Some sort of synapse blew in Harry's brain. He couldn't even explain why, but the mere sight of Draco in a
"No, the spell only works in one direction," Jimar explains helpfully. "His room is right next to this one, so we can see and hear him, but he can't do either the other way around unless we let him.”
For a split second, I was tempted to protest and insist on viewing the memory, but then I gave in. If Draco managed not to push me, then I would not either.
"Potter, don't go back to sssleep... You need to feed..." Draco mumbled and sounded as if he were half asleep, but Harry's stomach reacted instantly. This didn't sound as if Draco was ignoring him.
"Your condition is that I have to be nice to you?" Draco tilted his head and studied Harry's face. The corner of his mouth twitched with an amused smile. "You see, I
Before Harry knew what was happening to him, he heard himself speak. "Draco, I –"
Harry's breath faltered. That meant that Draco's behaviour had changed after all! Harry didn’t imagine this undertone, which was definitely reassuring. And also a little nerve-wracking. Harry licked his dry lips, continued to look at McGonagall, whose words he hadn’t been listening to for a long time, and finally breathed out haltingly. “You… proposition yourself… to
The blond eyed him suspiciously for a moment, then shrugged his shoulders, “Apparently not.”
They are ancient, but incredibly rare beings who possess magical powers that have not yet been researched completely. In “
Harry finished his sentence in his mind. He didn’t know why he deserved it or why Draco felt that way about him, but the little selfish part of him was happy about it.
The latter put on an almost identically composed expression and nodded politely. "Father."
"It's just a theory, but it's a lot more plausible than you sharing a magical signature with Malfoy," she explains, then taps a page in the book in her hand. "It's an exceedingly rare phenomenon and as of yet I'm not entirely sure how it came about, but all the signs suggest that you’re sharing wands."
Please don't hate me because this took so long to update!! But here's another BAMF Pansy chapter, and mostly from Draco's POV to boot!
“Yeah,” Harry said. “That’s a word – a really mean word – for a girl who likes other girls.”
Then Draco was taking his shirt off slowly. Harry’s whole body was heating uncontrollably, his heart racing.
Harry gave her a shrug. It wasn’t as though there was much in particular that he could say. It was strange, really, having so many people flock to protect him after a life spent in the Days Before being treated like an adult for so long before he was even near to being one.
“Still angry, then?” he asked, despite his better judgement telling him to be quiet and just do what she said. Handling an angry Ginny was much like handling an angry Pansy – nod, agree, and do whatever she asks of you.
Harry felt Draco nudge him. The other boy raised his eyebrows when Harry looked over, as if to say
The world felt bright and warm as they drifted into sleep. A thought chased its way through Harry’s mind.
Michael gave him a strange look. “What happened?”
Harry wasn’t really sure where to go from here. How did one start a possible insurrection in a week? There was only one good answer. Pansy Parkinson.
I learned plenty during the two months (and the rest of the summer) other than chemistry, of course. I have read – so much, more than I ever thought I would – muggle literature until it felt like my eyes would bleed. Everything Minerva could get for me. And we spoke for hours, some days – about how I was raised, how I was horrid, how I cannot change that but perhaps I can change my future. Muggles start wars over race, religion, any number of idiotic things just as wizards do. And it turns these small differences in people into life-or-death variances. I understand this now. I understand that I contributed to this culture of oppression and violence and I will not participate anymore.
Teddy giggled and grabbed at his glasses with his pudgy hands. Huffing, Harry shifted the boy so he couldn’t reach his face. He had just started laughing at almost 5 months old – Andromeda said he was a late bloomer, but Harry had other suspicions. Maybe Teddy spending all his time around adults who had lost so much, who hardly ever laughed, was affecting him.
“No,” Draco sighed back. “But on we go.”
“I’ll go with him,” Draco said, almost too quickly. “None of us should be going anywhere alone,” he added.
He was broken from his reverie by a sharp elbow to his ribs, and he looked around wildly, breath coming in gasps. Draco on his other side was engrossed in a whispered conversation with Pansy and didn’t seem to notice his near-breakdown.
“They said nothing was wrong with me,” Harry said, finally. “That it was all in my head.”
Harry let out a strangled groan as Draco removed his fingers and replaced them with something much larger. The rhythm was perfect, Draco pressed Harry hard against the wall of the shower with his body, his hand stroking Harry’s cock in time with his thrusts.
That was, perhaps, an understatement. But Harry kept that thought to himself, at least. “Did something happen?” He asked instead.
“I haven’t-” Harry had to pause again, take a deep, shuddering breath. He focussed on his breathing for a moment; slowly in and slowly out, knotting his hands in the bedsheets on either side of him. “The last time I had a dream that bad was after Cedric – after the tournament,” he said. “They were horrible, that summer – the next year, too. Because Voldemort was in my head. And now he’s gone, but…”
“Yes, it’s all very exciting,” McGonagall said with an almost-Draco-like drawl. It was Harry’s turn to laugh. “Moving along, the Defence position will be filled by Professor Cleomenes, who will also be acting as Head of Gryffindor house in my stead.”
“Everyone is fine,” McGonagall said gently. “It was an…internal reaction, so to speak. You were the only person harmed.”
and then you two come in from your stupid vacation with your stupid prejudices and have to ruin it. You should have said from the beginning that you’d rather spend time with Smith and his cronies than here, would have saved us all the energy of bothering to even try.”
It was Draco, of course, with a plate of breakfast and a concerned look on his face. “Blaise told us what happened,” he said, and it took a moment for the memories to come rushing back in. His nightmare, Lupin’s pale face, Tonks’ haunted eyes, Sirius’ anger and Colin’s despair – Bellatrix holding his friends hostage. His stomach heaved despite himself.
He hadn’t told the Slytherins about the map yet, had wanted to wait until Ron and Hermione were here and had met them. He mostly was hoping that showing them after Ron and Hermione had gotten used to them would make them feel less betrayed that someone else knew the secret of the Map and his Cloak. Now, though, he wasn’t so sure they’d all ever get used to each other.
His flashbacks were less, now that he had been here for a week. He less often walked through the corridors shaking and gasping for breath, less often had memories rise to the surface. When they did, he could push them down. He wondered if it would have been the same if he had been back in Gryffindor, with Neville and Dean and Seamus.
yet, all the eighth years who were able were arriving the week before to help finalize castle preparation and restoration for the following year.
“Grindlewald,” the boy said in a near whisper.
“It is when you’re annoying me,” Draco said without malice. He took the offered shirt, too, and pulled it on over his head. Harry slid back into bed beside Draco, nestling his head on the other boy’s chest; a silent request for Draco to stay the night in his bed.
He was going to say something cheeky about being the Chosen One or maybe about how Draco was really the one with the big head, or something embarrassing, like
“My punishment, if you could call it that,” he said. They sank down against the wall in unison, sitting next to each other on the stone under the stars. “I’m here until the end of eighth year. Can’t leave school grounds, can’t use magic outside of classes, can’t drink, can’t share rooms with other students. You get the idea, I’m sure.” He cast Harry a peircing gaze. “Why aren’t you back inside with all the others?”
Neville looked like he was going to be sick, but was the first to speak up. “No problems, Headmistress. I was just going.”
“Very well,” she sighed. “Come along, then.”
If Andy was here, Teddy must be somewhere – and Harry was torn between desperately wanting to see the boy but not wanting him to see Harry in a hospital bed, even if he was too young to understand what it meant.
“I daresay that woman needs a break,” said Minerva. Harry nodded his agreement as he took a sip of tea. British habits may die hard, but sometimes he really, really wished Minerva was a coffee drinker.
Harry bit his collar bone, none too gently. “Nothing, particularly, except for all the Gryffindor’s getting pissed off some shit rum and this being the closest place to be sick from it.”
When he came to, he was wrapped in Draco’s arms, feeling more peaceful than he had since, probably, the Days Before.
I'M SO SORRY THIS TOOK SO LONG TO UPLOAD!!!!
. It took a moment and then they were moving fast, colliding with force, kissing hard enough to bruise.
Harry whirled fast, his cigarette falling from his fingers. He didn’t bother stomping it out, the castle was all stone, anyways. His heart was pounding in his chest, his vision blurring around the edges.
Harry reached toward Draco and hauled him up by his hand, then turned to do the same for Blaise. Pansy got to her feet on her own, giving a dignified sort of sniff as she did. Draco saw Harry roll his eyes at her good-naturedly.
“Alright,” Harry said, bringing his hand up caress Draco’s arm. He reached his arm, cast a cleaning spell over both of them.
“Maybe she should,” he groused. “This is different, though.” He paused for a moment, searching for the words to explain
“Hey,” Harry said. He reached over to grab Draco’s right hand and hold it, feeling a little bit guilty as he did so. “There’s nothing there,” he said. “There hasn’t been anything there in over a year.”
“That’s bollocks and you know it,” Harry hissed. He opened his mouth to say more but was interrupted by a squeal.
I am not writing this to make excuses to explain away my past. I was a stupid boy who made others feel small to make myself feel better. I was a horrible teenager who hurt and tortured people, who kept prisoners in my basement and played house with a madman.
Just because it’s happening in your head doesn’t mean it isn’t real.
“We thought you might like to find…Weasley and Granger this morning,” Draco said. Harry could tell it took him effort to keep his tone level.
“Draco has him,” Andromeda said gently. “How are you feeling?”
out of his element watching it all unfold.
Harry slapped himself mentally for not realizing sooner – for not realizing last night, even. Draco was expressly forbidden from sharing sleeping quarters with other students; and while there was probably nothing technically wrong with him staying the night in Blaise and Harry’s room, there were also too many people itching to see him expelled.
“Thanks,” he rolled his eyes. Tucking the parchment and quill into his pocket, he allowed her to lead him into the Common Room and into the corridor, the entryway grinding closed behind them.
“Good morning, Minerva,” he responded. Her name did not roll smoothly off his tongue, and he had to fight the urge to call her
“That’s what you’ve been thinking?” Harry asked.
I will not give you details about what I experienced in the war. It was horrendous, it was wrong. I cannot compare it to your experiences – you put yourself under great duress for the good of everyone. I put myself under great duress for the good of nobody except the Dark Lord. Sometimes, in my mind, I am irredeemable, but I try not to give into that. My choices do not define my worth, but they do decide my consequences.
“Would you believe he didn’t say a word to me the entire time? Frankly I’m not quite sure he’s smart enough to speak,” Draco smiled at Harry, but it didn’t reach his eyes.
“Shut
The Healer looked harried. “His core is depleted, yes. What I am saying is that there is no physical reason for this. It’s simply in his head. Perhaps he is afraid of magic or no longer wants it and it is reacting in his body, thereby depleting his core. What I am telling you is that there is no fix for it - no potion or spell. He will simply have to decide how he feels about his magic and fix it. There’s no real problem.”
“Okay,” Marlene said. “I understand that. Like when Draco tells you to be quiet at breakfast?”
And then it was nearing dinner, Pansy and Blaise had gone for a walk, and it was just him and Draco and the overwhelming cloud of sadness that had followed Harry all day.
“They don’t,” Draco said quietly. Then he was pulling Harry – or Harry was pulling him, maybe – by the hand in the direction of his room.
“On the first if all goes well,” Harry responded. “The memory charm is reversed, but she wants to take her parents to St Mungo’s to make sure everything is fine.”
“Maybe you’ll get to help Potter catch up,” Draco drawled from beside him.
“I’d like to try again,” Draco said, “With your friends.”
Harry hung back as Madame Pomfrey asked for directions from a tall, grumpy looking mediwizard. Harry made eye contact with the man accidentally, but his eyes only widened and then he looked away from Harry with a grimace and an eye-roll. Harry couldn’t help but smirk - it would have irked him in the Days Before, no doubt, to be looked at as if he were a piece of dirt on someone’s shoe, but now he found it preferable. A side effect of death, perhaps? Or a side effect of spending eighteen years of his life constantly in the newspapers, feeling like he had to fight for people’s favour.
Pomfrey insisted on giving Harry one finally check up, which he sat through with an air of annoyance. He really just wanted to leave the Hospital Wing, knew Draco and Blaise and Pansy were waiting for him.
“You should let Pansy style your hair,” Draco said suddenly. “She’s quite good with hair trimming spells.”
“No,” Draco ground out again, supressing a shudder. He had been hurt in exchange for his refusal, been punished while he was at the Manor for Christmas, and then again for Easter.
Harry raised an eyebrow at her, but was cut off by Professor Stone before he could say anything.
“But-” someone protested, maybe Dean or Seamus, it was hard to tell.
“Well you were the ones who got to spend all your time shut up in the Slytherin common room while other kids were tortured. We’ve heard the stories, you know – we’re not daft.” Draco saw Weasley’s blue eyes flash with anger and looked at him, almost incredulously, though he tried to hide it. He could almost feel the anger pouring from Pansy across from him.
Harry made it through a whole two seconds of trying not to look at Pansy before she cracked first.
Reluctantly, Harry flipped himself off of Draco’s waist and stood slowly. His whole body was burning to touch and be touched.
“It’s alright,” she said, standing from her place on the chair. “Give him here, I’ll let you two catch up.” She took Teddy from Harry, giving him a long hug when she bent down. She gave Draco a quick kiss on the forehead, to which he blushed. “I’ll see you boys in the morning.”
Harry grinned somewhat ruefully at him. The other boy wasn’t wrong at all. In fact, he was quite right. It wasn’t something Harry would have suggested in the first place, had he known how it was going to end up from the start.
The eighth years followed McGonagall out of her office and down the spiralling staircase into the main body of the castle. It had been rebuilt well, a far cry from the castle’s appearance when they had all gathered for the two month anniversary of the battle. Paintings had been restored, walls rebuilt. But everywhere Harry looked, he saw flashes from the past in his mind eye; crumbling walls, curses flying, Fred falling, Colin Creevy still on the ground, Lavender Brown’s body broken on the corridor floor.
“Did you enjoy killing muggles?” Draco winced, visibly. He didn’t talk about that, ever. Not the raids he had been sent on with Death Eaters, not how he had been threatened and tortured by his wicked Aunt for not having the stomach to kill.
“Harry?” he looked up, startled, realizing he had been lost in thought for a few minutes and merely pushing his food around on his plate. Andromeda looked concerned, and Draco looked as though he was avoiding eye contact. “You’ll be alright, you know,” she said softly to him.
“You saved everyone,” Draco responded. “All I did is hurt people.”
“Yes, Headmistress,” he responded, giving McGonagall a small smile. Between the amount of time he had spent here rebuilding over the summer and his near-daily meetings with McGonagall this year, he felt he knew her quite better than any other student did.
“Two, and neither of them defence professors? You continue to surprise me, Potter.” He saw her glance at him out of the corner of her eye. “Binns could very well be horrid. Don’t come complaining to me when you regret your choice.”
“You’re teaching us history, right?” Mar’s voice came from behind him as soon as he sat down. Plenty of the others seemed to find her annoying or weird, but Harry quite enjoyed her presence. Pansy, too, seemed to have taken a liking to her.
The buzzing in his body slowly cooled. He was able to eat a couple bites of toast, and Draco poured him coffee that warmed him from the inside. He wasn’t feeling calm by any means, but he was present. And in the Days After that was often the best he could hope for.
It took him a moment to locate her. She was the smallest of the bunch, tucked in near the back of the huddle. She looked less nervous than the others, though – more self-assured. She stood up from the bench, too, as he neared, and flipped long, black hair out of her face. In a way, she reminded him of a young Hermione.
After some quick goodbyes with Andromeda and handing off Teddy, Harry wove his way though the remaining students with Draco’s hand in his. His nerves had begun to mount. It wasn’t so much that he was frightened of
“Not always,” Hermione said.
“Pansy is going to be angry,” Harry said with a sigh as they got out of the shower.
The first day of term was tomorrow. Ron and Hermione would be arriving in the morning, which Harry was uncharactersitically nervous about, given the dynamic between the eighth years right now. The rest of the school would be arriving in the evening for the Welcome Feast and Sorting, and Andromeda would be visiting with Teddy as well. They had visted already this week – Teddy had already stolen Pansy’s heart.
Harry rubbed his face in frustration. “Why don’t they go to muggle schools, then?”
“What is it?” Harry asked. He took it and swallowed, dimly aware of Madame Pomfrey saying something before fell back into sleep.
“I think there are more than just us two who feel like this,” Harry said carefully. “We just have to find the rest.”
“Alright,” Harry said, giving his friend a small smile. “Don’t see much of him, really. McGonagall is much more interesting.”
like the moon
Harry felt a smile blooming on his face. “Like it long, hm?” he asked, and began giggling in a quite un-Harry like way. There was no reason, really, except that he was happy to be out of the Hospital Wing and grateful to be here with Draco, quiet and close.
The rest of the week passed in a blur of much too much homework for a school year that had yet to even start. Harry met with McGonagall four times, directly after breakfast. He had chosen her to shadow to do his best to learn what running a school was like. So far, it was simply a mess of boring paperwork. He had met with Binns four times, too. The ghost had about as much personality as his teaching skills implied, but Harry was determined to do something about History of Magic at Hogwarts. After all, perhaps if they focussed on the
“Can I?” he wasn’t even sure his voice was loud enough to be heard, but Draco nodded. Slowly, his hands went to the button, popping it open, and unzipping the fly. He pulled down Draco’s jeans, his pants coming with them, dropped to his knees and helped Draco to step out of them.
Of course, the Slytherin common room wasn’t at all peaceful when they walked in. It rarely was, but especially now. There were some second and third years playing a loud game of gobstones near the fire, the first years were running around led by Mar (who paused to give them all a wave as they came in). Some seventh years were crowded around a couple tables pushed together, though. They made their way toward them, the boys trailing behind Pansy.
“He was never in my head,” Blaise said, “so I know it’s not the same. But sometimes, it helps me to focus on things I know are true.” He looked up at Harry in the darkness, the whites of his eyes shining. Were they just bright, or were those tears? There were tears in his own eyes, Harry realized – he hadn’t noticed until now.
“Really?” Hermione asked suddenly. “Only, I imagine there’s a lot of work that goes into her job. What do you help with?” She looked uncomfortable again – about speaking so eagerly to him? Or something else? Harry wasn’t sure.
Last year, though, I watched people killed in front of me. I had Lovegood and Ollivander in my cellar. No, my dungeons. What kind of person grows up in a house with dungeons? I hadn’t known they were there, not until I came home and was given the task of bringing them food and water – when the Dark Lord felt like feeding the prisoners.
“Hermione-” he tried.
He tugged on her hair, not hard, but not gently either. “Are you saying I didn’t think before?”
“I’m supposed to bring you straight to Pansy and Blaise,” Draco said.
“She’s a muggle, I met her over the summer. Didn’t realize she’d be teaching though.” Harry couldn’t see him, but imagined he was looking very smug right now.
“Zacharias Smith is
Maybe, in deciding to open a school, become a teacher, he had made a great career choice. Or maybe this would all fall apart around him. But for the first time in the Days After, Harry was feeling hopeful.
Harry just swatted at his hand. “Do any of you pay attention to the Daily Prophet?” he asked suddenly. The question had been burning since Ron and Hermione had confronted him on Saturday, but by the time he had gotten out of the hospital wing he had lost the nerve to bring it up.
“And you died,” she said for him, finally. “In the Final Battle.”
“No arguments,” said the Headmistress firmly. “You are here at my request, and if necessary I will see you leave at my request, too.”
Currently, Harry was in the garden with said child, doing push-ups while Teddy giggled in the grass. Andromeda had banned cigarettes from her house as soon as she had found Harry with them and had given him a good stripping down that included phrases like “ghastly muggle inventions” and “horrible for the child’s lungs”. Maybe in the Days Before, Harry would have rebelled and snuck them in anyways. He knew he hadn’t cared much for authority. In the Days After, though, Andromeda was right. It was horrible for Teddy to be around.
“I like water,” Mar said. “Can you see the water from the common room?”
Mar scrunched up her face. “That’s like when someone says something they don’t mean, right?”
“I’ll try to make sure we learn about everything you write down,” he said once he had turned around, “As long as it’s appropriate for this class. Take all the time you need, and once we’re all done we’ll do something fun, okay?”
“Why don’t we call you Mar?” he asked. “I think it suits you.”
“Draco has him right now,” Andromeda said gently. “How are you feeling?”
. The toast tasted like sawdust in his mouth.
“You smell like the Hospital Wing,” Draco said finally, shakily. “You need a shower.”
“Well Potter seems to have forgiven you, why can’t they? It’s not as though they were never cruel to you, either,” Blaise said, after a moment’s silence.
Harry dropped back on his pillows. Sunday evening. He had missed so much – his meetings with Binns and McGonagall, cutting Mar’s hair, lesson plans – everything. “When can I leave?” he asked sullenly.
Harry couldn’t help it, he let out a small groan. In the bustle of getting up to start heading to the dungeons, no one seemed to hear him except Draco, who just cast him a slightly exasperated look. Maybe he was being..dramatic, but it was for good reason. He could already think of a host of reasons why he
“I was sleeping,” he said. “Haven’t been sleeping well.”
Harry glanced over – Draco was smiling down at the first years, looking as gentle as Harry had ever seen him, like was around Teddy, maybe, but with less of the discomfort of being around a baby. The first year students seemed enraptured by Draco’s words, they were all gazing up at him almost adoringly. Harry was fairly confident that if anyone was going to be getting any hero-worship from the Slytherins it was going to be Draco, not him.
“Your magic, though,” Andromeda said, only a smile to acknowledge his words. “I do believe the healers are correct, but so are you.”
“Pansy is going to be
“I’ll be teaching you this year, but you don’t need to call me Professor or anything because I’m still a student, just like you. You can just call me Harry.”
“Me and Harry, Professor,” said the voice – Harry now recognized it as Ginny’s. “And Luna and Mal- Draco.”
Pansy snorted. “It was. But they’re your friends.”
How had it happened that he had been taken under the wing of a group of Slytherins that everyone hated? Why was it that everyone hated them so much? Hating Draco, he understood, maybe. Harry hadn’t been at Hogwarts the previous year – hadn’t seen what had happened, although he had heard stories about Hogwarts under the Carrows rule. Students had been forced to hurt and punish other students – until eventually some had taken up residence in the Room of Requirement.
“You’re just jealous you don’t have hair as nice as mine,” Draco said, reaching up to tug a strand of Harry’s hair – rather harder than necessary.
“Probably,” he said, finally. He buried his face in Teddy’s hair and closed his eyes, focusing on the babbling of the boy in his hands.
“How do you mean?” Harry stepped away to pick Teddy up as he began to fuss. As usual, the familiar weight of Teddy on his hip was a comfort - a small piece of stability in a shifting world.
“No arguments,” said the Headmistress firmly. “You are here at my request, and if necessary I will see you leave at my request, too.”
“I know,” Draco gave him an odd sort of smile. “I would have hurt you if you hadn’t. Not all these scars are from you, anyways.”
“No,” Draco sighed back. “But on we go.”
As if reading his mind, Minerva sighed. “You have experienced more vitriol than most in the press at such a young age. You have seen first hand how public opinion can change easily and turn you into the villain. This could very well villainize you again.” She paused for a moment and Harry felt himself almost subconsciously run a hand through his hair as he waited for her to continue.
I hope you understand me some more now, not that there is much to understand. Your ideas of me are quite likely accurate.
Hermione snorted. “I knew it wasn’t all rivalry.”
He stopped to kiss Teddy, who was now happily in his bouncer in the sitting room, before following Draco to the kitchen. Teddy’s high chair had been moved over to make a seat for Draco around the small kitchen table.
cried leaving in a flood of tears had done more to shake his confidence than anything had since the war itself. He sat down heavily on Harry’s bed, and it seemed to shake everyone out of their surprised stupor.
Harry couldn’t help it, he let out a small groan. In the bustle of getting up to start heading to the dungeons, no one seemed to hear him except Draco, who just cast him a slightly exasperated look. Maybe he was being..dramatic, but it was for good reason. He could already think of a host of reasons why he
“Probably,” he said, finally. He buried his face in Teddy’s hair and closed his eyes, focusing on the babbling of the boy in his hands.
“How about this,” he began. “There’s no one in the Great Hall right now and there won’t be until dinner. Why don’t you take the second years with you? I’ll write you a note that gives you permission.”
“Let’s get you up,” he muttered to the boy, brushing the last of his tears from his eyes before leaning into the crib and scooping Teddy up by his armpits. He moved the boy to the change table to change his nappy quickly - no matter what he said about equality and muggles, some things were just better with magic. This was one of those things.
Hermione sat up and scrubbed at her face. For a strange moment, Harry thought she was just going to get up and walk out of the kitchen - away from him. But instead she leaned into his side and let him wrap his arm around her. It reminded him startlingly of camping in the Forest of Dean, just the two of them against the world.
“You are so goddamn beautiful, Draco Malfoy,” he whispered in the other boy’s ears. He felt the moment Draco’s breath stopped, the moment he started breathing again. Then he saw stars as Draco shifted his hips against Harry’s.
“I have to sneak back up to the table,” Andromeda said as she turned to engulf Draco in a similar hug. “I thought you might like to mind Teddy for the meal, though.”
He did his best not to laugh, but really – it was hard. “Okay, do you have a nickname or a different name I can call you?”
By the time Professor Stone had finished speaking and Harry had gathered the ingredients, and Ginny had divvied up the steps to the potion, he had hoped she would have forgotten her question. One pointed look from her after a moment of silence, though, told him she hadn’t at all. He felt panic gripping the edges of his mind, tried to push it away.
Harry smiled at her and she smiled tentatively back. “How about this,” he said. “Tonight I can come by the common room with Pansy and she can cut your hair. How does that sound?”
Madame Pomfrey clucked in distaste from somewhere behind him. “Camped outside of the Hospital Wing all day – along with half of Slytherin house no less. Whatever you’ve been doing, Mr Potter, you have a group of very loyal students at your back.”
“That has got to be the least subtle way to enter or exit anywhere, ever,” Pansy sighed. Harry smirked at her, but didn’t say anything. His mind was still reeling.
Neville sighed. “Look, I just wanted to say that I’ll do my best to keep Smith off you in the common room, but I can’t promise anything. He’s angry.”
Pansy was pacing. Harry thought she looked shocked from her own outburst, was sure she had planned to say something more eloquently. But she looked the Headmistress in the eye and didn’t back down.
have. So I don’t see how that makes you or I any worse than them,” she sniffed.
“I know,” Draco gave him an odd sort of smile. “I would have hurt you if you hadn’t. Not all these scars are from you, anyways.”
“Your trunks have been sent ahead to your rooms, as I am sure you are all aware,” she began. “Since you are all here, I will show you to the eighth year common rooms.” A mumble of surprise went up from the group, but she quelled it with a look. “Hogwarts will not be a pleasant place for most returning this year, you all are expected to be supporting the younger years in their transition back into the castle. We have made the decision to keep the eighth years from having ties to any particular houses.”
He couldn’t have, not really. Not when the world needed him to defeat Voldemort, and especially not now that Tededy needed him. But it was his one selfish wish.
“I don’t know the other’s well enough to say. I suppose that could be it. I’m sure Hermione knows who will be back, though,” he shifted Teddy on his arm, putting the empty bottle down. “I’ll go put him to bed now, I think,” he said to Andromeda.
“Sorry to disappoint,” he said, wryly, sitting down on the bed next to her. She wasn’t crying, now, but obviously had been. She was sitting on the bed against the headboard instead, holding a pillow to her chest.
“But Dumbledore-” she began, but Harry cut her off surprising even himself with the sound of his laugh.
“Can you disillusion yourself?” Blaise asked suddenly. “If you walk sort of – in-between us, I don’t think anyone will notice if you’re a bit fuzzy at the edges.”
“Secondly, you’ll be choosing your partners for the rest of the year today before you enter the classroom. You will do all your potions work with them, from your brewing to your assignments. Potions is not a solitary field and I do not believe it should be solitary in the classroom either. You will be able to enter today once you have chosen your partner and have seen me to have your names written down. Your partner cannot be someone in your own year. Eighth years, please partner with seventh years. If anyone is left over at the end we will go from there.”
“Stop,” it was Draco’s voice, quiet but commanding, clearly directed at Harry and Blaise. He glanced at Zabini, who dropped his wand, gaze remaining on the four in front of them. Harry followed suit, turned his eyes to Draco as the other boy wiped the spit off his face, rolled up his sleeves to display his Mark – faded, but there.
“Everything hurts,” Harry said, sighing again. Perhaps in the Days Before he would have said he was fine, just so he could get back to his friends and his dormitory; would have protested having to stay in the hospital wing. But in the Days After he was simply tired – too tired to protest, too tired to heal, too tired to lie.
And then it was nearing dinner, Pansy and Blaise had gone for a walk, and it was just him and Draco and the overwhelming cloud of sadness that had followed Harry all day.
“Sorry,” he chose to say, instead. “I’m listening now.”
“You put him there,” Ron said finally. “He would never be working on that if it hadn’t been for you.”
Pansy relayed the plan quickly and efficiently – Harry’s only role was “Look friendly but don’t talk, for Merlin’s sake, or you’ll scare them away, Potter,” which he couldn’t really argue with. He spent the rest of the feast trying not to agonize about how the Slytherins would probably hate him and it would ruin his desire to open a school before he could even
Minerva says the best way to spit in the face of the Dark Lord is to oppose his ideals – not just on the surface, per formatively, but wholeheartedly. She is right. At my trial I did not necessarily believe that muggles were as good as wizards, I did not believe they were worth as much or as important or worthy of life in the same way.
“Pansy asked me to meet her for an early dinner.”
“All right,” Harry called out. “Where are you?”
Draco took a sip of wine. “Okay. Because I talked about, um, you so much in school, they thought I fancied you.”
Draco smiled at Harry and, for the first time, received one in return.
Harry smiled at her near slip. He knew she counted him as one of her closest friends, just as he did her. It didn't stop her from trying to hide it. “And?”
Draco laughed and Disapparated them both.
, he suddenly thought in disgust,
“Here because we, too, have trouble getting along,” Harry said, with a nod to Grumpy and Frumpy.
Under her watchful eye, he stood up and walked slowly back to where Dean and Seamus were sitting. He moved slowly, but his shoulders were straight, and he didn’t look back.
“The rest of them don’t have an excuse,” said Ginny, with what Harry could only describe as a sarcastic laugh. “They’re just pricks.” She had raised her voice at the end of what she was saying as Seamus walked past them. He shot a nasty look in her direction, but didn’t comment further – probably because Professor Stone had just walked by to collect their sample.
and then you two come in from your stupid vacation with your stupid prejudices and have to ruin it. You should have said from the beginning that you’d rather spend time with Smith and his cronies than here, would have saved us all the energy of bothering to even try.”
“Lesson plans,” he responded, doing his best to look in her eyes.
Pansy snorted. “It was. But they’re your friends.”
“You are,” Harry pushed, hoping his tone came off teasing. He looked over when Draco didn’t respond, to see the other man stubbornly looking at the wall instead of Harry. His right hand was back to playing with his left forearm.
“This is not the first time the wizarding world – or even the muggle world has gone through something like this,” she said carefully. “People will want to be careful, now more than ever before, that we prevent the same type of war from happening again.”
“Right. Could you, um, leave while I get ready?”
God, but he wished he had a cigarette.
They didn’t work for very long. Harry could barely keep his eyes open after a couple hours of writing, but with Draco’s help he managed to finish his transfiguration essay and his muggle studies reflection. The rest of the group was planning on working through dinner, but Draco essentially dragged Harry out of the room, demanding they go rest.
This chapter is a little short compared to normal i think - but it was either this or leave it excessively long, so i decided to chop it in two. That means next chapter we'll get to see the sorting feast and Pansy and Harry with the Slytherins, and this chapter is 99.9% angst. Yay!
It was strange, he thought, to be speaking in the History of Magic classroom without anyone speaking over him or dozing off. In Binns classes, both were usually occurring.
She sat for a moment, rocking back and forth while she tapped her collarbone as if considering what Harry was saying. “Can I still get my hair cut?” she finally asked.
“Can anyone think of any Muggles that may have been starting wars around the same time?” Harry asked once he had turned back to the class. Fewer hands went up, and this time it was easy to identify the purebloods by the uncomfortable glances they cast around the room.
Harry let his head rest back on his pillow, giving himself a moment to process. His magic had exploded, so – “Are they alright?” he asked, suddenly full of worry. He felt sick.
“It’s a little bit drafty,” Draco continued. “But we’ll teach you some warming charms. There’s always a fire on in the fireplace, too, and the older students will conjure you flames that you can carry around if you ask.”
“I should have told you,” he said, finally, from the start. “It was just…he was feeling everything I felt, you know. We were sad and afraid in the same way. And-” he broke off with a sigh, looking away from Hermione. “It’s Draco Malfoy. He’s always been..there.”
“I wasn’t really…” Harry started, but trailed off at the look Pansy gave him. “I’m sorry, Pans,” he said with a sigh, finally.
Draco let out a low whistle when Pansy and Harry passed over their timetables for him to look at. “None of you will have any free time, will you?” He smiled a little at Harry, but it didn’t reach his eyes.
“Where were you at lunch?” Draco asked in a voice muffled by the bedsheets.
“I’m going to pretend that made any sense,” Pansy responded. “Blaise has gone off to the kitchens. We’re supposed to meet him there in about…” she trailed off to glance at her wrist, as if she was wearing a watch. She wasn’t. “Now, but you’re bloody hard to wake up.”
Harry kissed him then, softly. “I would have been angry,” Harry said.
, Draco was quite confident he was a small step away from hyperventilating like a stupid twelve-year-old. But then Potter reached out and brushed Draco’s side again, and he could feel the tremor in his hands and – was it wrong that it made Draco feel a little bit better, to know Harry was just as worried?
Harry laughed quietly. Draco stepped forward, and Harry closed his eyes. He felt the other man’s fingers ghost across his face, lips press to the scar on his forehead.
,” he read in a monotone voice. “That’s easy. Medicine, psychology, they’ve been to the moon! All we can do is magic. If it’s a race of who’s superior, wizards lose.”
He stood and stretched, giving Draco a small smile.
“I can feel you watching me,” Draco drawled without looking over. Harry smirked, but didn’t move from where he was leaning.
“What are you waiting for? We need to go.” Pansy spoke as if he were particularly daft. Given the time of morning, he probably was.
Ravenclaw,” Mar said, as if it were the coolest thing in the world. “I told her she was pretty, and she said she’d cut my hair for me, and I really want it shorter.”
“Lesson plans,” he responded, doing his best to look in her eyes.
“I always pegged you for becoming an auror,” Pansy responded evenly.
“Part of what we’re going to do in this class is make sure that your reading and writing abilities are good enough to help you keep up in your other classes. And if they’re not, we’ll figure out how to fix it. Today, to see where we’re all at, I’d like you all to write me six inches on what piece of history you’d like to learn about most this year. It can be something I already mentioned, or something I didn’t, and it can be magical history or muggle history.”
Harry nodded, the cobwebs clearing completely from his mind for the first time all day. He kissed Draco quickly before dragging himself out of bed.
“It was front page,” Harry said. “I only saw the headline. The Wizengamot passed a motion to track former Death Eaters.” He winced, almost, waiting for the exclamation of horror or anger but none came.
and be
“I think it’s different, then,” Blaise said. “You can’t tell me Crabbe or Goyle never killed anyone.”
“Something like that,” he said.
“Thank you for being here,” he said to Andromeda. “I’m sorry I scared you.”
“Good,” she said, giving him a warm smile. “You gave us all a fright.”
Neville sighed. “Look, I just wanted to say that I’ll do my best to keep Smith off you in the common room, but I can’t promise anything. He’s angry.”
“It’s quite interesting, really,” she said to Madame Pomfrey, ignoring Harry almost entirely. “I will have to have the Healer come in and look for himself. I’ve never seen anything quite like this.”
“Didn’t know if you’d want to do this again,” Draco gasped out.
speaking to him. Or trying to. He’s just always around…”
Harry quietly filed away another discovery under his list of Days After traits:
“We weren’t good people, any of us,” she finally said. “Except maybe Nott. And the Greengrasses, they were always wonderful. Tracey Davis was a cow, though. Actually, I probably was, too. Crabbe and Goyle were horrendous. I have it on good authority that Goyle decided not to return because he didn’t want to see what we would do to him after we found out he may have had a little too much fun being the Carrow’s sidekick.”
“Where were you at lunch?” Draco asked in a voice muffled by the bedsheets.
His hair seemed ragged, sticking up in ways Harry knew a young Draco Malfoy never would have let it. There were dark circles under his eyes – the kinds Harry had from nighttime wanderings and shrieking nightmares. He wore lazily unbuttoned black robes. His skin and hair were stark against the night, not like Harry who blended into the dark except for the whites of his eyes.
“What look?” Harry asked, bemused. He let his hands trace the scars on Draco’s abdomen, twine through his hair, tug on it gently.
“This involves you, too, you twat,” she said sharply. “I can’t do this with just Potter, he’s useless!”
“A thinly veiled threat, almost,” Blaise filled in for her. “Unless you all love each other very much,” he said in mimicry of the hat’s voice, “You will all die cold and alone.”
Hermione rolled her eyes, although it looked half-hearted. “Your consequences were winning a war. His were hurting people and probation.”
“We haven’t been anywhere without Pansy or Blaise all week,” Harry said, watching Draco intently. “I’m just saying, we can work on assignments when we’re with them.”
“I had to listen to her prattle on about it all the way here,” Blaise groaned, “And she wouldn’t even tell me what it was.”
“And you think you’re so good, Weasley?” she huffed. “Looking down on purebloods that aren’t like you, acting like school children are really the biggest enemy you’ve faced, like we’re worse than Vold-V – than the Dark Lord himself.”
“I don’t know why she would be mean,” he settled on saying. “People can be mean for a lot of reasons. Maybe she was having a bad day.”
“I know we have a class that’s probably quite mixed in terms of skill,” said Professor Stone. “So we’ll start off with a practical review. Please turn to page 17 in your books. You’ll have this class to brew Dreamless Sleep potion as a review. It won’t be for an official mark, but your grade will allow you and I to see where your skill level is at.”
Harry shrugged. “I thought that’s what I wanted,” he said. And it was, too. In the Days Before, that had been his goal. But now he had lived through a war, and more fighting was the last thing that he had wanted.
“We can,” said Pansy. Together, the three of them led the first years out of the Great Hall and towards the dungeons. It felt good and right and – it felt to Harry like he was truly, completely at home.
Pansy whacked his shoulder. “Instead of the eighth years keeping their prefect status, and because we don’t get the opportunity to be Head Boy or Girl either, the professors decided to do something else with us.”
“She means me,” Draco said after a moment. He disentangled his legs from Harry’s to stretch out. “I’m not supposed to be here, twat,” Draco continued at the confused look Harry shot him.
“She means me,” Draco said after a moment. He disentangled his legs from Harry’s to stretch out. “I’m not supposed to be here, twat,” Draco continued at the confused look Harry shot him.
Harry couldn’t help but doubt that – something in him felt off. Maybe it was just his magic being worn out, it probably was, but sometimes it felt like he couldn’t feel anything magical at all. Like the magic in him had dried up.
So I simply said no, although of course I recognized Harry. I would recognize him anywhere, even then.
Blaise, to his credit, inclined his head slightly in Harry’s direction, although his eyes still hadn’t left the group before him.
“No,” she laughed. “It’s just-” She paused for a moment, looked him up and down, setting Harry’s nerves on edge. “You didn’t
“Is there a problem, here?” Harry looked up to see McGonagall standing over them. Draco removed his knee from Harry’s leg, and he felt the absence like a slap to the face.
“Of course,” Harry said warmly to Andromeda instead. She handed him over and with a small squeeze of Harry’s shoulder she was off to the High Table. The timing was good – just as she left, the sorting hat was sat upon its stool by Professor McGonagall. Harry shifted Teddy in his arms so he could lean against Draco as the hat began its song.
“I wasn’t on school grounds in the first place,” Harry said grumpily, but he felt himself lighten all the same. “Shall I take Teddy through?”
, felt like home to Harry, especially with Teddy wrapped up in his arms.
And maybe, ther was a chance they could chage that, starting now. They were all children in a war, after all. Andromeda had said that to him often.
The buzzing in his body slowly cooled. He was able to eat a couple bites of toast, and Draco poured him coffee that warmed him from the inside. He wasn’t feeling calm by any means, but he was present. And in the Days After that was often the best he could hope for.
“Don’t feel like it,” Harry settled for. “Needed some space.”
“You had a choice,” he said, gently. “You and Ron, from the beginning. Not like me and Draco. And I am so grateful that you chose to be my friend and to follow me even when I didn’t want you to.”
“I did a lot of reading this summer, too. No one viewed Slytherin as an evil house, not until Voldemort, not really. I mean – Dumbledore was in Gryffindor and he almost helped Grindlewald take over the world, and maybe if he had gone through with that, people would act the same way about Gryffindor. Even the way people talk about Salazar Slytherin or the chamber of secrets, that’s changed in the last fifty or so years, since Voldemort. So maybe you all just became what we made you to be, you know?”
Briefly, Harry wanted to argue. In the Days Before he would have, woudln’t have liked the implication that he was weak or afraid. Now, though, he thought about how he posed a danger for Teddy with his outbursts. How he almost hurt Ron and Hermione, but turned the magic inward on himself instead. How he was afraid for Draco because the other boy couldn’t carry a wand.
Harry sighed and motioned to the tea in front of Hermione, watching her take a sip. He held his own mug in his hands, letting it warm him at least a little bit.
“Ron showed me an article,” Harry said with a sigh, “On Saturday.”
“I just needed…space.”
It took him a few minutes to realize Pansy was trying to get his attention.
What Harry wouldn’t have given, in that moment, for someone he loved to be here to make sense of this for him. Sirius, Lupin, even Andromeda.
He leaned out over the edge of the Astronomy Tower, cigarette resting between his lips, and gazed out at the shadowy outline of the Hogwarts grounds. They were all here, of course, to celebrate and to mourn. Everyone had been offered a bed to stay in for the night. Naturally, most Gryffindors Harry’s age were currently seated in the Common Room, getting pissed on Odgen’s firewhisky and cheap muggle rum.
I know what you’re thinking – surely once I was at Hogwarts I should have learned to think differently. You’re right, of course. I should have. But even here, I did not learn about muggles or muggleborns. I was surrounded by others who thought those without pure blood had no place in the school. No, it’s not an excuse. I could have listened – I was too proud, too set in my ways, too determined to please my father. It’s not an excuse, I’m not trying to make excuses.
“You wouldn’t stop screaming,” he said, “Not after you woke up, either.”
When his breathing slowed, he disentangled his hands and pulled Draco, who had also finished, to his feet, kissing him long and hard.
“Okay,” he said, the glum feeling returning as he heard the dismissal for what it was.
“Is someone going to tell me what happened now?” Harry asked with a huff. Andromeda squeezed his hand in warning but McGonagall just looked at him with a soft face. Somehow, that made Harry feel worse.
her office as well.
“Gryffindor idiots,” Draco said before Harry could respond. Michael was back to looking amused at Draco’s response.
,” he moaned.
“Maybe,” she responded with a resigned sigh. “Still, maybe you just need to try again.”
“Please,” she said, leading them to the fireplace and adding a pinch of floo powder to the flames.
“There’s no use,” he said after a moment. “In being angry or…whatever. It doens’t help, does it?”
It was Andromeda who sighed this time. “You can’t lose your magic, Harry. If you lose your magic you lose your life.”
After a quick shower they headed towards the Great Hall together. With the whole school now back, it seemed much safer to eat in the Great Hall again. It was harder for the other eighth years to follow them, and even then their interest seemed to have gone from something that felt genuinely dangerous to whispered comments and threats.
“Sure,” he said, turning back to Ron and Hermione. “Maybe we can go for a walk.”
,” he choked out finally. He heard Draco whisper spells, wondered dimly if this counted as magic outside of classes, before Draco was back on top of him.
“How’s Hogwarts, Draco?” asked Andromeda as she began to serve them up.
Draco launched into an explanation about the work he was doing with the restoration, under the watchful eye of Professor – or rather, Headmisstress McGonagall. Harry only half listened.
He was exceptionally grateful, then, to find tea and toast waiting for him in the spare classroom he and the Headmistress met in. She held a deep hatred for the portraits of the ex-headmasters and their constant need to give opinions, so they hardly ever met in her actual office. Harry wasn’t even certain if she ever used it.
“How are you feeling?” Draco murmured in Harry’s ear. He didn’t have to specify, he knew what Draco meant. He could tell his nerves for the upcoming day were coming off him in waves. He was anxious – anxious about classes, trying to learn again as if everything were normal, helping Binns, tea with McGonagall that afternoon – just anxious.
He glanced around furtively before reaching into his jeans pocket and pulling out a cigarette and a lighter. There were charms for this, of course, but his magic had been unstable to say the least in the Days After; once he had set fire to Andromeda’s back garden, so for now he stuck to lighters.
Harry felt his skin prickle - anger, again. Frustration, maybe? Not emotions he felt often enough anymore. “Well clearly it meant something, Hermione,” he said, finally, “or you wouldn’t have said it.”
Then of course, we heard about Gringotts (well done on the dragon) and we were off to Hogwarts shortly after. Our only instructions were “do not kill Harry Potter.” It did not matter to me, really, provided that if I was alive by the end of everything there was a damn good reason for it.
Harry nodded absently to Draco and instead turned his head to Andromeda. “Would you like help with the washing up?”
“Worried you won’t have enough time for me?” Draco asked, then. He sounded confident, but Harry could feel the tremble in his body that gave him away. He rolled over and propped himself on top of Draco. They were hardly clothed, he could feel every touch of Draco’s skin to his like fire.
“It’s not a hard assignment,” Draco said, giving Blaise a look as he packed up his stuff. He paused to read from the piece of parchment in front of him. “
Harry sighed. He was leaving for Hogwars the next day, flooing in. Draco would be staying with Andromeda and flooing in with them. It wasn’t September 1
“Then why is it a mean word?” she asked.
“Didn’t McGonagall say the new potions professor was willing to unofficially take you on?” Blaise asked, grabbing Draco’s timetable out of his hands. “That’s not even on your timetable yet, I’m sure some of those slots will fill.”
He caught a startled look from Draco as Andromeda wrapped him into a hug. She hadn’t been brought up to particularly warm, Harry knew, and Draco may have expected the traditional Black aloofness in her. But she couldn’t have raised a daughter like Tonks without learning how to be warm.
“You will have to be careful,” McGonagall said. “Exceptionally careful with the amount of energy you are expending over the next couple weeks.”
He only partially noticed Blaise disappear from his side and shoulder his way into the crowd; then reappear almost as quickly. Harry jumped when a hand landed on his shoulder. “Looks like it’s you and me, mate,” said Zabini into his ear.
Draco was flushed bright red, and Harry guessed it was more from the question he had asked than their previous activities. Suddenly, something clicked and he couldn’t help but grin at Draco.
“Sort of friends?” Draco asked. There was amusement tinging his voice, now. Part of Harry wanted to make fun of him for being jealous, but the other part of Harry knew that would, more likely than not, end in disaster.
grow up in the middle of a war,” Pansy sniffed. “Honestly, Draco, not even she blames you.”
!” Draco sat up suddenly, blocking Harry’s view of the door. But of course, he didn’t need to see who it was to know.
“Twice?” Zabini asked, almost gleefully. Harry shot him a dark look.
“Harry!” Was the first thing he heard when he stepped out of the fireplace into Andromeda’s living room. “What on earth are you doing?”
“I don’t know why she would be mean,” he settled on saying. “People can be mean for a lot of reasons. Maybe she was having a bad day.”
Bumping the door open with his hip, Harry stepped into the cottage. Andromeda was bustling around the kitchen, preparing dinner, most likely.
For some reason Microsoft Word deleted over half the chapter so i had to rewrite it, which was not my faovurite thing in the world to do espeically since it's an actually pivotal chapter in terms of plot and the direction of this story. sigh.
This summer I underwent what
history, the Voldemorts and the Grindlewalds of the world, rather than the Goblin Rebellions of the tenth century, mistakes that were made in the past would not continue to occur.
“I’d imagine,” Draco put in. “Now please be quiet.”
Harry smiled at her and she smiled tentatively back. “How about this,” he said. “Tonight I can come by the common room with Pansy and she can cut your hair. How does that sound?”
I was wrong. I am sure there are still things I am wrong about, but I would like to continue learning. I am doing my best to have an open mind. This is what I had wanted to convey to you the first time we spoke. I was unable to, perhaps because some wounds are still too fresh, perhaps because your friends are not as willing as I to put down their arms and recognize their wrongs.
Zacharias Smith, Harry was pleased to notice, looked slightly nauseous at the sight.
“I thought you liked my hair,” Harry said, pouting but not really. Draco flicked his nose in response.
(See the end of the chapter for
There I go, dithering again. Anyways, that was the first time I perhaps was able to realize that what I believed and how I experienced the world was wrong. I am sorry that you had to be the person to prove that to me in such a gruesome way.
“I didn’t want to,” Harry responded, sliding into the chair next to him. “Not until I knew I could make it happen.” He began to serve himself some food – if there was one thing he had missed about the castle, it had to have been Hogwarts food. “What professor did you request?” he added, directing his question at Pansy.
“That isn’t how it works,” Andromeda said, almost immediately. It wasn’t the response Harry had been expecting, but she went on before he could say anything. “You’re right that Life and Death weren’t balanced when you died. But you’re forgetting the piece of Voldemort that died with you. Something did die and it did restore the balance, Harry. Horcruxes are old magic - I don’t know much about them, but old magic always comes with a price. It is too wild to use lightly.” She took a sip from her tea and gave him a gentle look. “Life and Death always require balance, and it was you who restored that balance after Voldemort disrupted it. I daresay Death owes you a favour.”
“Don’t worry,” Harry said with a sigh in Blaise’s direction. “I’m dedicating tomorrow morning for arithmancy. Just you and me until lunch.” He gave Blaise a cheeky look, but the other boy just rolled his eyes.
“You should do Potter’s hair, Pans,” Draco said when a moment of silence got too long to be comfortable. “He wants to grow it.”
“Better than what, Potter?” Draco growled. “Better than getting to go places? Or see your friends? Better than being the world’s saviour?”
“To brood,” Harry confirmed solemnly.
Not that he minded, really. He struggled with the isolation. It wasn’t so bad now that the castle was full of people, although without Blaise, Pansy, and Potter it would have undoubtedly have been worse – but the summer had been horrible. Even with Potter visiting, the letters and floo calls exchanged with his friends, it had been horribly lonely.
“It’s alright, you daft idiot,” Pansy said from his side. Her voice sounded far away – it was the feeling that was becoming familiar to Harry, since coming back to Hogwarts. As if everyone was on the other side of a long tunnel, and no matter how hard he tried he couldn’t quite get back.
“This is exhausting,” Pansy groaned from beside Harry. Their first week of classes at Hogwarts was complete, but instead of the weekend being the respite from work they all needed already, Harry was burying himself in lesson plans while Pansy was wading her way through a thick and unfriendly looking Dark Arts book.
He locked his door behind them, casting a discreet
“Your room,” Harry groaned, mustering every ounce of self control to let go of Draco’s wrists and prop himself up slightly. “Let’s go there.”
. Draco Malfoy was bloody beautiful.
“What do you want, then?” Pansy asked, no longer hiding her curiosity. They had reached the kitchens, and he paused to tickle the pear on the portrait before responding.
“I don’t think she can hold a grudge,” Ginny said with a sigh. It was obvious she was talking about Luna. “Now are you going to tell me why you aren’t speaking to my brother?”
Harry paused, realizing he was definitely rambling. Ron was looking at him in a sort of bemused way, but Hermione seemed fascinated.
“Mr Zabini, you’ll be meeting with Professor Vector in an hour. Don’t be late.” At Blaise’s nod of understanding, she swept away from them.
Maybe some wizards are simply fearful of muggles. After all, we still spend much time dedicated to learning about witch burnings – as if they were even a cause for fear. Did you know most killed “witches” were actually muggles? Their fear of us caused them to attack their own, which perhaps caused us to fear them.
“She’s a muggle, I met her over the summer. Didn’t realize she’d be teaching though.” Harry couldn’t see him, but imagined he was looking very smug right now.
“Oh, it was dandy,” he responded, unable to help himself. “Spending my time with only ghosts and thrice daily tea with McGonagall.”
“How about this,” he began. “There’s no one in the Great Hall right now and there won’t be until dinner. Why don’t you take the second years with you? I’ll write you a note that gives you permission.”
Last year, though, I watched people killed in front of me. I had Lovegood and Ollivander in my cellar. No, my dungeons. What kind of person grows up in a house with dungeons? I hadn’t known they were there, not until I came home and was given the task of bringing them food and water – when the Dark Lord felt like feeding the prisoners.
. You see, despite being raised my whole life to despise muggles, I had never met a single one. Not until the war, at any rate. And even then, although you may think I am lying, I’ve never hurt one. Not because I’m particularly noble, but because I believed that muggles are so pathetic that it would be like kicking a puppy. I learned about guns this summer, and nuclear weapons.
Harry glanced over – Draco was smiling down at the first years, looking as gentle as Harry had ever seen him, like was around Teddy, maybe, but with less of the discomfort of being around a baby. The first year students seemed enraptured by Draco’s words, they were all gazing up at him almost adoringly. Harry was fairly confident that if anyone was going to be getting any hero-worship from the Slytherins it was going to be Draco, not him.
Something simple was scribbled beside the title in Ron’s handwriting.
“What’s the story with Nott, anyways?” Harry broke the silence to ask Pansy curiously.
“You are a bit of a prat,” Hermione said, looking at him from the side of her eye. With that, Harry knew he was forgiven. But he wasn’t done speaking.
Pansy was not smug. She was, in fact, not at all impressed. Harry felt her eyes on him almost as soon as he and Draco stepped into the Great Hall. Draco must have felt it, too – or maybe it was the stares of all the students trickling in, because he dropped Harry’s hand almost immediately. When Harry cast a sharp look at him, he was staring straight ahead.
“Yes, it’s all very exciting,” McGonagall said with an almost-Draco-like drawl. It was Harry’s turn to laugh. “Moving along, the Defence position will be filled by Professor Cleomenes, who will also be acting as Head of Gryffindor house in my stead.”
“Lastly, I would like to introduce everyone to our new staff this year. Professor Slughorn has unfortunately decided to retire, so we will be welcoming a new potions professor – Professor Stone has been hired to fill his post.” A friendly looking woman in earth-green robes stood to wave to the students. She seemed fairly young, although looking across the high table it seemed as though there were quite a few young professors this year.
“I’ve been known to have them,” Draco drawled. If Harry’s eyes were open, he would have rolled them, but he was already drifting off into sleep.
Deciding he’d try the kitchens first, since it was on his way to the Slytherin common room anyway, he spun on his heel and headed towards the corridor that would take him to the painting of the fruit. The castle halls were quiet although it was a Sunday - the younger students were likely outside enjoying the last of the good weather and the older students studying.
Harry cast a look around him – most of the gathered students just looked confused. Hermione looked appreciative, of course. So did Pansy.
“I am teaching it,” he said finally. “But try not to tell anyone, okay? It’s just after once, so you won’t have to keep it secret for long.”
Harry rolled his eyes, Draco saw it in his peripheral vision, but he refused to acknowledge it. Pansy was also rolling her eyes. All his friends were traitors.
Harry let his head rest back on his pillow, giving himself a moment to process. His magic had exploded, so – “Are they alright?” he asked, suddenly full of worry. He felt sick.
“Yeah,” Harry said. “But I grieved. And I came around. So did Ginny. Draco grieved and practically relearned how to exist in society. Why is it taking them so long?”
It was strange, he thought, to be speaking in the History of Magic classroom without anyone speaking over him or dozing off. In Binns classes, both were usually occurring.
As if reading his mind, Minerva sighed. “You have experienced more vitriol than most in the press at such a young age. You have seen first hand how public opinion can change easily and turn you into the villain. This could very well villainize you again.” She paused for a moment and Harry felt himself almost subconsciously run a hand through his hair as he waited for her to continue.
He missed her more than he had thought he would, for someone who had only been in his life for a short time. He felt his eyes glisten slightly and winced to himself. In the Days before, he would have been angry. In the Days After, he was apparently just a sap.
Mar squealed and gave them a jerky wave before dashing off to the Slytherin table. At almost the same moment, McGonagall appeared beside the group with their timetables.
“Is there a problem, here?” Harry looked up to see McGonagall standing over them. Draco removed his knee from Harry’s leg, and he felt the absence like a slap to the face.
Harry groaned. “I don’t need marks, Hermione. I just need to know things.”
He just looked at her, not sure what to say. His opinion was right, was reasonable – why wouldn’t people listen to him? He was the Saviour of the Wizarding World!
“You mean he’s not, now?” Harry snorted. Pansy smirked back at him, but her expression was slightly vacant.
“Did you enjoy killing muggles?” Draco winced, visibly. He didn’t talk about that, ever. Not the raids he had been sent on with Death Eaters, not how he had been threatened and tortured by his wicked Aunt for not having the stomach to kill.
,” McGonagall said in a clear voice. Draco stiffened beside him at her words and Zabini shifted on his other side. Harry had no idea what he meant, but
How had it happened that he had been taken under the wing of a group of Slytherins that everyone hated? Why was it that everyone hated them so much? Hating Draco, he understood, maybe. Harry hadn’t been at Hogwarts the previous year – hadn’t seen what had happened, although he had heard stories about Hogwarts under the Carrow’s rule. Students had been forced to hurt and punish other students – until eventually some had taken up residence in the Room of Requirement.
Draco pushed him up against the door impatiently as soon as they entered the room. “I was so scared,” he said between kisses. It was a small thing to say, but significant nonetheless for a man who rarely talked about his feelings.
“She’s not,” Draco said suddenly. It seemed like the whole eighth year table had leaned towards him to hear what he had to say around the buzz of the dining hall. They were all avoiding looking at the four of them, though. Harry couldn’t help but smirk when Draco lowered his voice so only he, Pansy, and Blaise could hear him talking.
“There are mean words for a lot of things, and a lot of people that there’s really nothing wrong with,” Harry tried. Mar looked confused. He tried again. “A lot of people say mean things, and that’s why there are mean words.”
Harry only partially paid attention as Andromeda spoke with McGonagall about his magic. He floated through the conversation, eager to find Draco and see what he thought about everything, only coming back into himself long enough to give Teddy a kiss on the head and hand him back to Andromeda. He waited patiently, heeding McGonagall’s warning that he needed to check in with her every other day to discuss the progress of his magic before taking off out her office and down the hall.
“It’s okay if it bothers you, though,” he continued. “Sometimes mean things hurt.”
Harry nodded, thoughtfully. “Were your parents Death Eaters?”
“I should have been a better friend,” he said after a moment. “I’m sorry.”
But at Hermione’s expectant look, he caved. “Muggle studies will be mandatory for everyone from first year to seventh year, starting next year. We’ve something planned for this year, too, but I’m not allowed to say yet.”
“They’re probably your Gryffindor’s, anyway,” Blaise said when Harry turned a pleading look on him. Since it was clear that no one else was going to help him, Harry hauled himself up with a sigh, careful not to touch any of his papers strewn over the bed.
“It’s not dark,” Draco added. “The lake makes it seem sort of green. Sometimes you can see the Giant Squid through the windows. There’s always lots of fish that you can see, and your dorms have enchanted windows so it looks like you’re looking outside.”
Instead of looking gratified, Harry noticed Draco looked significantly sick. “She should hate me,” he said. “It’s my fault her – and Teddy -”
It wasn’t gentle, but nothing between them ever had been.
“You want to study?” Hermione asked, gasping mockingly. “Who are you and what have you done with Harry?”
The fist in his chest, the spinning, the crushing, was receding, now. He felt as though he could breathe, but
“That’s our cue,” Pansy sighed. “Remember to try not to make an idiot of yourself.” She cast a look at Harry specifically. He just rolled his eyes, He had learned, in the past week, that she got like this when she was nervous – angry and abrasive. Or rather, more angry and abrasive than usual.
Draco snorted, and soon the four of them were all laughing, much to the horror of those seated around them. They probably looked mad, Harry thought, snickering on like idiots after such a dark warning.
Harry’s breathing began to slow, his brain catching up to his surroundings. He was in Howarts, he was perfectly safe, and he recognized that voice.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Harry asked. He tried not to sound angry, not to sound threatening. He was so tired, so exhausted already – the world was greying around the edges of his vision.
“Come on,” Draco finally said after a moment of uncomfortable silence. “Let’s just go to the Dining Hall, we need to be there soon regardless.”
Later that evening, Harry found himself curled up in Draco’s bed, relating the conversation to him. When Pansy had calmed down, they had gone to the Great Hall for dinner. She had refused to tell the other two what happened – hadn’t wanted to talk about it. Draco was clearly upset by this, so after dinner Blaise had waved him away with Draco, said he’d stay the night with Pansy and Harry should stay with Draco, if only to calm everyone’s nerves before the school was filled the next day.
And then they were in the shower and Draco was lathering soap along Harry’s body and it was so simple and so domestic but Harry thought he would very well go out of his head with desire from it all.
It was Andromeda who sighed this time. “You can’t lose your magic, Harry. If you lose your magic you lose your life.”
“And Flitwick, and Sprout, and Slughorn…” Draco sighed. “It was a lot of tea.”
He turned to write his instructions on the chalk board. He could have done it by magic, sure, and it would have been faster, but there was always the chance he’d make the chalkboard explode instead. He should really, probably tell McGonagall about how unstable his magic was being.
“What do you need?” he felt Draco ask against his ear.
Andromeda just sipped her tea. Harry stifled a sigh. She never made it easy - she’d never ask questions or push him to talk. It was nice, most of the time. But sometimes some things were hard to say.
And Draco Malfoy, that night on the Astronomy Tower. Things could never go back to how they were, and somehow, despite everything, Harry was infinitely grateful.
He and Andromeda had spoken at length about it over the summer before he had sent an owl to McGonagall with his requests for classes. After deliberation and much conversation with Andromeda, McGonagall, Ron, and Hermione, he had decided to take Charms, Transfiguration, History of Magic, Care of Magical Creatures, Herbology, Potions, and work outside of class with some professors to take his OWLs in Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, and Muggle Studies, which had shocked Ron.
He followed the crowd inside, sticking close to Draco, Parkinson, and Zabini. He felt a kinship with them; it was definitely strange, seeing as how Pansy had all but offered him to Voldemort during the Battle. But they were subdued; he could feel the anxiety from all of them, mirroring his own. He no longer had it in him to be boisterous, not in the Days After. Maybe he truly had belonged in Slytherin all along. Or maybe, as Andromeda had said, grief had changed him.
“Kind of, yeah,” Harry agreed. He wanted to touch her hand, hold it still, but was fairly certain that was the wrong thing to do. “Mary was being sarcastic. She was trying to be mean to you.”
“Okay,” Harry replied cautiously. “Who’s going to cut it, then?”
“Arithmancy,” he said dully, “although I don’t really care.” He took a sip of what must have been coffee – hadn’t touched a bite of breakfast, Harry noticed.
Draco turned to look at him, grey eyes crinkling at the corners. “No,” he admitted, “but I can see your shadow.”
Harry shook his head. Unsure if Draco could see it in the dark, he added, “No. It was unnecessary. It all was. You can’t survive a war, can’t watch people die and not be changed by it. The rest of it was…I don’t know, Draco. Beyond horrible.”
“Just sad,” she said, giving him the kind of look out of the corner of her eye that made him feel as though she could see right through him.
He was gratified to hear Zabini snort in resopnse, although the other man didn’t look at him or acknowledge him in any other way. Harry didn’t exactly know why he was trying to make friends with them, even Draco had given him a bemused, although not ungrateful, look.
“You saved everyone,” Draco responded. “All I did is hurt people.”
Pansy muttered something under her breath that definitely included the phrases
Teddy giggled and grabbed at his glasses with his pudgy hands. Huffing, Harry shifted the boy so he couldn’t reach his face. He had just started laughing at almost 5 months old – Andromeda said he was a late bloomer, but Harry had other suspicions. Maybe Teddy spending all his time around adults who had lost so much, who hardly ever laughed, was affecting him.
“Come on,” Draco finally said after a moment of uncomfortable silence. “Let’s just go to the Dining Hall, we need to be there soon regardless.”
“I probably should,” Harry sighed in agreement. He hadn’t spoken to them since the previous day’s catastrophe.
“Then why is it a mean word?” she asked.
to become a parent to her grandson. And with Harry gone…he tried not to feel guilty, because of course he should have come back to Hogwarts, but he did. If only he could have delayed a couple years, waited until Teddy was older, and then come back; it would be easier on Andy to care for an older child. It could have been possible, too, if he were anyone other than, well, the
Of course, you got away, Harry with my wand. The danger that put me in – suffice to say I was punished and badly. Did you know it is much harder to practice occlumency without a wand? I do, now. But it was irrelevant at that point, I had the seeds of doubt placed and I looked only to survive from then on. Make little noise, do as I was told, don’t argue. I was not allowed to go back to Hogwarts. They wanted to keep an eye on me.
“I’ll go with him,” Draco said, almost too quickly. “None of us should be going anywhere alone,” he added.
were tortured, Weasley?” she asked, almost deathly quiet. Weasley, at least, had the sense to look abashed. Granger looked panicked. “Has the thought that Slytherins were tortured, too, never entered that thick skull of yours? You think they cared about anyone’s blood status and not just-” she cut off with a sob, Draco realized, horrified.
Stunned into silence, Harry could only gape at Blaise. After a moment of silence in the room, he seemed to deflate with a sigh. “Sorry,” Blaise said finally. “It’s not good, though. Those bastards will abuse their power, people are going to get hurt.”
Under her watchful eye, he stood up and walked slowly back to where Dean and Seamus were sitting. He moved slowly, but his shoulders were straight, and he didn’t look back.
“Very Slytherin of you, Potter,” she said, coming back around to sit on the bed again. “Very sneaky.”
as he did so. He turned to see Draco standing uncomfortably in the middle of the room. “Yours is across the hall,” Harry said, by way of explanation. “Andy said we could keep it for you, for Christmas and the like, if you want to come here instead of stay at Hogwarts.”
last night!” The voice came from behind him – loud enough to make him jump and spill coffee down the front of his robes. Blaise gave him an exasperated look from his other side and waved his wand, cleaning up the mess.
By the end of the day, he was so tired he was ready to drop – but he still had at least three essays to work on, not to mention the amount of reading and lesson planning he needed to get done,
Uncomfortable with the way she was looking at him, Harry slid out of his chair. Perhaps in the Days Before, Harry would have shouted or thrown a tantrum to avoid the emotions he was feeling now. But in the Days After, he just didn’t have the energy.
“Oh, it’s you,” Pansy sighed when he stepped in.
“Good,” she said, giving him a warm smile. “You gave us all a fright.”
The appointment, thankfully, was fast. They were led into a quiet room - no doubt only afforded to them because Harry was the Boy Who Lived. A much friendlier looking witch assessed him, waving her wand around him in complicated movements to check his vitals while he tried not to flinch.
“I should have told you,” he said, finally, from the start. “It was just…he was feeling everything I felt, you know. We were sad and afraid in the same way. And-” he broke off with a sigh, looking away from Hermione. “It’s Draco Malfoy. He’s always been..there.”
After a quick shower they headed towards the Great Hall together. With the whole school now back, it seemed much safer to eat in the Great Hall again. It was harder for the other eighth years to follow them, and even then their interest seemed to have gone from something that felt genuinely dangerous to whispered comments and threats.
He headed into the sitting room, picking up Teddy, who was dozing, and depositing himself on the couch. Harry nuzzled the bottle between the boy’s lips until he latched, holding him close.
By the time class was due to start and all the students were settled, Professor Binns was still nowhere in sight. Feeling nervous, but deciding he may as well give it a shot, he cleared his throat to start class.
The air carried a slight chill, as if it knew it was the first day of term. He struck off in the direction of the forest, opting to take a path beside the lake. It was peaceful here, the most peaceful place he had been in days.
people, those who deserved it – still made him feel weak.
“And what if we cause in-fighting, or accidentally dismantle the whole government in the process?” Minerva asked levelly.
“Aw, Pans,” Blaise said, “Not everyone is as blasée about sex as you are.”
He didn’t have to ask twice. Draco was on him in a heartbeat, their lips crashing together as they did in the garden earlier that night. Harry pushed the other boy back until he was lying on his back on the couch, Harry bracing his body over top. He bit Draco’s lip, his neck, his collarbone with bruising force.
Pansy laughed softly. “It’s from an old Latin song. It translates to
“More for us to keep in line of course,” Pansy grumbled. Harry shook his head slightly at her – despite her words, she seemed gratified that they had so many students. He was…possibly a little bit excited at the prospect as well. After all, the first step to opening a proper school would be learning how to interact with children.
Deciding he’d try the kitchens first, since it was on his way to the Slytherin common room anyway, he spun on his heel and headed towards the corridor that would take him to the painting of the fruit. The castle halls were quiet although it was a Sunday - the younger students were likely outside enjoying the last of the good weather and the older students studying.
Harry didn’t bother to comment. It wasn’t as if he had never been an exception to the norm before. And it wasn’t as though he had never escaped certain injury – or even certain death – before.
“Why would she be mean?” Mar asked, looking confused. Harry did his best to keep his cool. He would tell Pansy about this as soon as he could. They would figure out what to do.
“Maribel,” she responded, “but I hate it.”
Do not misunderstand me, I am not upset by this. It was quite cunning of her, really. She understood that I was, in part, willing to learn – I just didn’t want it to seem like my idea.
Harry shrugged. Honestly, he only knew from Ron’s complaints about how Hermione was while they were staying with her parents in Australia, but he was not about to say so. He felt suddenly very weary.
Pansy whacked his shoulder. “Instead of the eighth years keeping their prefect status, and because we don’t get the opportunity to be Head Boy or Girl either, the professors decided to do something else with us.”
“Nothing,” Harry said emphatically. Maybe too emphatically – the small girl startled. “There’s nothing wrong with anyone liking girls or anyone liking boys.”
“Right,” Harry managed, reaching for the piece of toast Draco offered him. He didn’t really feel like eating, but he also wanted everyone to stop looking so
Harry was promply sick all over the floor.
She paused a moment, as if to consider. She was tapping her fingers rapidly against her leg as she thought, and it made Harry’s chest feel tight – as though he should be running or moving or doing
Then I was home for Easter. When I was a child we would have a big dinner. Spring vegetables, the best lamb I’ve ever tasted. We would dress nicely, host other families. Pansy often came, as did Vince and Greg. Those were the best times of my life.
“You – how did you convince them to do that?” she asked in shock.
“I think it’s that we’re the same, honestly,” Harry said. “Not completely,” he added at Hermione’s raised eyebrows. “It’s just…I never had a choice. Voldemort made the choice for me when I was a baby. And then Dumbledore, The Order…they made the rest of the choices. But Voldemort made Draco’s choices too. Voldemort, his dad, you know? And Draco understands what it’s like, to be forced into situations you had no control of and have to deal with the consequences.”
Dear Ron and Hermione,
, probably something rude about Weasley’s, but Pansy beat him to it.
“Its good to see you taking your House Guardian duties so seriously,” she said with a bemused sort of smile at the four of them.
Harry worried the cigarette between his fingers before taking another drag. It wasn’t as if he didn’t want the company, didn’t enjoy seeing his friends. Ron and Hermione were departing the next day for Australia, to work on restoring her parent’s memories. Harry ought to be sitting downstairs with them – but when the room got too crowded and it became hard to breath it was easier to just escape. Most of them could escape without leaving – drinking their thoughts away until their eyes shone and they fell into easy sleep. He couldn’t, though. It was nothing against the alcohol, he understood why it was how they coped. But for Harry in the Days After, it made it worse. He’d drink and the room would shrink, and the shadows would lurk around the corners until he fell into nightmares.
After some quick goodbyes with Andromeda and handing off Teddy, Harry wove his way though the remaining students with Draco’s hand in his. His nerves had begun to mount. It wasn’t so much that he was frightened of
Harry couldn’t help it – through the panic, he snorted. “Yes, and instead I went to him willingly,” he countered. “We were all doing our best to survive, we
He was too shaken from existing, in the Days After, to handle a crowd of that size, if he were being honest. Instead, he left the castle, Invisibility Cloak tucked into his pocket. Draco, Pansy, and Blaise had each other, the others were distracted in the Common Room; it finally felt relatively safe to go for a walk by himself.
As far as Harry knew, he hadn’t visited his mother yet. Harry wasn’t sure if it was because he didn’t want to see her, didn’t want to visit the Manor where she was under house arrest, or was wary about the Aurors they had posted at the Manor every hour of the day to ensure she was complying. He hand’t asked, and Draco hadn’t volunteered any information.
lost people, Smith. I don’t blame her; neither should anyone else.” He turned his voice, then, to the crowd that had gathered around them. Most of them looked slightly incredulous. Hannah Abbott was looking rapidly between Harry and Zacharias. Neville and Dean were standing to the side, speaking with each other in rapid whispers. Nott looked distinctly uncomfortable, but was standing resolutely near Neville and Dean.
about fish, but Mar was looking at him so expectantly that he felt like he needed to say something. It was the right decision – as soon as he said it, her whole face lit up with excitement.
“It’s to your shoulders when it’s wet,” he said instead. “You should keep growing it.”
She lunged forward and flung her arms around him. “Thank you,” she said into his shoulder. Then she jumped back almost as abruptly as she had leapt forward. With one last, wary look at Ron and Hermione, she ran off. Hopefully, Harry thought, to do homework and not stir up anymore trouble.
“Easier to think, actually,” Harry added. He pretended to ignore Hermione rolling her eyes. “I don’t have as many reasons to be angry anymore.”
history, the Voldemorts and the Grindlewalds of the world, rather than the Goblin Rebellions of the tenth century, mistakes that were made in the past would not continue to occur.
“We’re late for breakfast,” he said, by way of greeting. Harry sat up quickly at that, shock coursing through his system.
“Malfoy?” Harry croaked, almost incredulously. As the name passed his lips, the blonde man materialized in front of him.
“Probably throwing a temper tantrum because he can’t see you,” Andromeda responded, smiling softly.
“Stop,” he heard Draco gasp through his haze, and he paused to look up. Draco’s gaze on him was heated, Harry felt himself blush.
speaking to him. Or trying to. He’s just always around…”
Harry filled him in quickly on what they had spoken of during the class. He even added, for good measure, how well their potion came out. He wasn’t sure when, but at some point while he was talking, he drifted into sleep.
“Is someone going to tell me what happened now?” Harry asked with a huff. Andromeda squeezed his hand in warning but McGonagall just looked at him with a soft face. Somehow, that made Harry feel worse.
!” and the screaming was his not his friends, and he was in his bed, but not
He stayed in the forest a long while, longer than he should have. No one said anything, though, when he missed lunch. Hermione had shot him a worried look as he passed by her, trailing after the Slytherins, but he didn’t stop to think about it, to talk. Instead, he followed the gentle pull of Draco’s hand in his, the small smile on Pansy’s face, Blaise’s enouraging arm around his shoulders.
“Why don’t we call you Mar?” he asked. “I think it suits you.”
outside of your stupid club with them?”
Harry sighed and motioned to the tea in front of Hermione, watching her take a sip. He held his own mug in his hands, letting it warm him at least a little bit.
“A letter,” Draco said simply. He was running a hand through Harry’s hair, now. “They can choose to open it or choose not to, and once they read it they can choose to speak to me or choose to burn it or whatever they’d like. It seems better than forcing my company on them.”
“Look,” Blaise sighed from his other side. “There are people who are beyond forgiving, mate. Your father, for one. People like Vince and Greg, probably,” Draco felt a dull pang at their names, and Pansy’s hand stilled for a moment before continuing its motions in his hair. It wasn’t Blaise’s fault for bringing them up, really. Blaise hadn’t been friends with them, nor Draco, for the most part. He had always considered wizarding politics beneath him, had never been shy about his hatred for the Dark Lord
“I guess I never realized that there were children coming to Hogwarts without any sort of school before that,” Harry said. “It must be hard.”
And was interrupted by a shriek. “
Food had appeared on their plates as the sorting finished. Harry picked at it, more focussed on Teddy than anything. He let the conversation of the Slytehrins ebb around him, content to just sit and not think for a moment.
silk nightgown.”
“Breakfast?” he asked. “We were only supposed to nap.”
“No,” Draco said simply. He sighed again at Harry’s expectant look. “No, I don’t want to be tracked. But it’s not as though I’m doing anything illegal, there’s nothing they’ll find. And honestly, most of those bastards deserve to be tracked anyway.”
“Wow,” Ron snorted. “You really are one of them, aren’t you?”
“To fill the Muggle Studies post, we have Professor Strickland.” A lady in muggle clothes stood up and waved to the crowd. A rush of mutters went around the room, including from Pansy, who nudged him.
“I’m sure it’s the lesson plans,” she said, and anyone who didn’t know her as well as he did might not have heard the sarcasm or seen the twinkle in her eye.
“I don’t know,” he said. He paused to watch her as she poured some of their potion into a vial to submit to Professor Stone. It was supposed to be dark purple upon completion; theirs was a little bit too light, he thought, but not horrid. “Some things are just…broken.”
“Bloody hell Potter,
“Now would you like to tell me why you’re here instead of at school? Does anyone know where you are?” Harry avoided meeting her eyes, not wanting to see the worry that was likely playing out in them.
I believe the first thing I learned about was chemistry. I think she knew I would like it, given my affinity for potions. Did you know muggles can do with ordinary ingredients and no magic what we do with potions? She taught me about muggle universities after that, when I expressed interest. Did you know the ministry has a branch that prepares wizards for muggle universities from Hogwarts? I will never get to go that route, I know the ministry would not help me in that endeavour. But it is something I consider. Professor Strickland has been helpful.
“Just the five Slytherin’s then, including you?” Andy pressed. Draco seemed to Harry to relax a little bit.
In fact, the more he looked, the more he realized that most of Slytherin had not vacated the Great Hall, especially the younger students. They seemed to all be waiting to speak with Pansy or Draco. There were even a couple young Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs waiting, although the absence of any Gryffindor students was notable. Harry felt a little bit out of his element – no,
Harry felt queasy all over again.
“Yeah,” Harry said. “That’s a word – a really mean word – for a girl who likes other girls.”
“Must I always clean up your messes, Potter?” he sighed. There was no malice behind it, though, and Harry was able to roll his eyes back before turning around to see Mar grinning ear-to-ear at him. She was bouncing on the balls of her feet, too, but she wasn’t tapping her fingers today.
“Give that to me,” Malfoy said suddenly. He took the lighter and cigarette from Harry’s hands, suprisingly gently. With one hand, he delicately placed the end in Harry’s mouth. With the other, he flicked the lighter to light it.
who to save, and I couldn’t, and…I went through the veil instead.”
“Your trunks have been sent ahead to your rooms, as I am sure you are all aware,” she began. “Since you are all here, I will show you to the eighth year common rooms.” A mumble of surprise went up from the group, but she quelled it with a look. “Hogwarts will not be a pleasant place for most returning this year, you all are expected to be supporting the younger years in their transition back into the castle. We have made the decision to keep the eighth years from having ties to any particular houses.”
“Don’t feel like it,” Harry settled for. “Needed some space.”
his bed, or his bed at Hogwarts at any rate, and the person shaking him awake definitely wasn’t Andromeda. It was Pansy.
Draco sighed inwardly. “I don’t know,” he answered honestly. “I don’t think so.”
She looked at him through swollen eyes. “You really are thick, you know that?”
Harry saw Zabini raise an eyebrow and exchange a look with Pansy, but he nodded. “Guess that leaves me and Pans. To the grounds it is.” He winked at Draco, and Harry tried to pretend he hadn’t seen.
“It’s always alright,” she said warmly. A warm Minerva was something Harry was still getting used to. Not that she had ever been cold, per se – just removed, as teachers often were.
“Maybe she should,” he groused. “This is different, though.” He paused for a moment, searching for the words to explain
He just looked at her, not sure what to say. His opinion was right, was reasonable – why wouldn’t people listen to him? He was the Saviour of the Wizarding World!
“Then what?” Harry asked. “I can’t see them wanting to speak to you, either way,” he said honestly. Draco reached out to tug on Harry’s arm, pulling him back down to the bed.
“It looks like almost everyone is here,” said Professor Stone cheerfully after a moment. The chatter in the hallway quieted. “Before I let you in, I’d like to go over some ground rules.”
“You don’t think she’s a Squib, do you?” she asked. She didn’t seem upset, Harry made sure to note, but she did seem confused. He shrugged in response, but tried to puzzle it out himself. There were other squibs on the staff, of course, like Filch, so it wouldn’t be surprising.
Harry accepted the offered change of subject. “Yeah,” he said simply. “I had trouble leaving Andromeda’s for Hogwarts, this year. Didn’t want to go. I think it will be nice to have them back. But I’m worried…” he trailed off.
“And what if we cause in-fighting, or accidentally dismantle the whole government in the process?” Minerva asked levelly.
I was resistant. McGonagall told me that she would not sign off on my parole unless I took tea with her daily. At first we took tea in the Headmistress’ office – the portraits are quite distracting, so then we took tea in the kitchens. It was a small start and I felt like I was held positively captive, more than I was physically, with the threat of my parole looming above my head. If I refused to speak, answer questions, be cooperative, she would remind me of her next meeting with my parole officer.
“I’m the Saviour of the Wizarding World,” Harry said, letting his amusement tinge his voice. “I can do what I want.”
“The Carrows didn’t care,” Draco said quietly. “They didn’t care about blood status, they were crazy. Do you know who stood up to them, when your lot left? Pansy did.” Weasley had gone pale, and Granger had slouched back in her chair. “Hate me all you want,” Draco continued, ignoring Blaise’s sharp look in his direction. “I’m the Death Eater, and I will own that.”
Harry grinned. “Wingardium Leviosa,” he said. “My first day in Charms. And then Ron used it to defeat the mountain troll.”
Then, to my surprise, you lot appeared at the manor in the hands of Snatchers. I do not know what I was thinking when I refused to identify you. I don not know that I was thinking at all, except that if you were killed then all hope was lost and this madman would never leave my house. My life would never go back to normal. And I thought, perhaps, that they knew it was you anyway. That if I refused to identify you I would finally be killed. I wanted death so badly in those times – I couldn’t stoop so low, of course. Not really. If I had harmed myself, he would have killed my parents as punishment. There is no escape from being a Death Eater, you see. Not even in death. Not unless you die for the cause.
Thanks to Draco’s insistence that they begin eating in the kitchens again, at least until Harry was feeling better, Harry was able to avoid any questioning by other students until Monday evening. He, Draco, Pansy, and Blaise had made their way to the Slytherin common room after dinner intent on getting some work done without being distracted by the rowdy eighth years. Professor McGonagall had announced that the sixth through eighth years were to meet in the Great Hall at eight o’clock that night. Harry and Draco knew why, but no one else did – not even Blaise and Pansy.
“Dare I ask where you discovered this information?” she gave them each a piercing look, but Pansy merely shrugged.
“You can,” came a voice from behind him – Pansy’s voice. Draco had come with her, and he pressed the back of his hand against the back of Harry’s hand when they approached.
It took him a few minutes to realize Pansy was trying to get his attention.
teaching first year history – two double periods per week, each a mixture of all the houses that had students – but he had wanted to keep it quiet until classes were underway.
“And when are you planning on doing the rest of your work?” he asked. “Between old McGonagall today and meeting with Binns tomorrow it’s not as though you’ll have time.”
“Before you exploded?” Pansy asked with a small smirk.
“Bins and McGonagall, if she approves,” Harry said after a moment’s pause.
But at Hermione’s expectant look, he caved. “Muggle studies will be mandatory for everyone from first year to seventh year, starting next year. We’ve something planned for this year, too, but I’m not allowed to say yet.”
He would miss this. He would miss Andromeda and Teddy, the peace of the cottage. He’d miss visiting Hogwarts and Draco quietly, having tea with McGonagall. He’d miss flying with Charlie, who was going back to Romania, anyways.
Harry rolled his eyes. “I’m not mad. Honestly!” He added at her disbelieving look. “I did think…maybe it wasn’t as fun as you were letting on. But Andy told me I had to let you heal in your own way. I guess she was right.”
Hermione said something, maybe, Harry wasn’t sure. He was dimly aware of them getting up and leaving – or were they backing away from him? He couldn’t see anymore, couldn’t feel. The world had gone from grey to white, he was angry like he had never been, not even in the Days Before, not when he had hated the world. The newspaper crunched in his hand and then felt hot, as if it had burst into flames.
“Alright,” Harry began once his last first year had trickled into the classroom, “Today we’re going to talk a little bit about some similarities in some well known evil Muggles and well known evil Wizards.” The class tittered excitedly, as if learning about evil was the best news they’d received all week. Harry laughed to himself as he turned toward the chalk board.
I know what you’re thinking – surely once I was at Hogwarts I should have learned to think differently. You’re right, of course. I should have. But even here, I did not learn about muggles or muggleborns. I was surrounded by others who thought those without pure blood had no place in the school. No, it’s not an excuse. I could have listened – I was too proud, too set in my ways, too determined to please my father. It’s not an excuse, I’m not trying to make excuses.
As far as Harry knew, he hadn’t visited his mother yet. Harry wasn’t sure if it was because he didn’t want to see her, didn’t want to visit the Manor where she was under house arrest, or was wary about the Aurors they had posted at the Manor every hour of the day to ensure she was complying. He hadn’t asked, and Draco hadn’t volunteered any information.
The only eighth years who wouldn’t be there, as far as Harry knew, were Ron and Hermione. They had been given permission to arrive the 1
“But when you have bad dreams, it feels like he’s still here, yeah?” Blaise finished for him. Harry nodded, to which Blaise sighed.
Harry did his best to give her a smile as he pulled out his potions book. He glanced back at Luna and Draco again. The two were deep in conversation, now, but Draco was still scratching at his arm.
with them. Especially small Slytherins who had no reason to trust him.
“Does it count as abuse of power if I don’t have any power to begin with?” Harry asked tiredly. Harry sat down at the table next to Draco, leaning into the other boy’s warmth. He was just too tired for this.
“Just going to make Teddy’s bottle,” he said, shooting a fleeting glance to Andromeda. He warmed the boy’s bottle as quickly as he could – on the stove; his magic was still prone to powerful fits that tended to set things on fire.
The next thing Harry knew, sun was shining through the false window in his dormitory. He woke slowly, conscious of the voices flowing around him, but too groggy to make them out. His bed dipped, and someone placed his glasses in his hands.
Opening his eyes, Harry reached forward and traced the newer scars on Draco’s chest, caressed the Mark on his arm. “It was war, Draco. We all have blood on our hands.”
“Draco…” Blaise breathed, but he ignored the other boy.
In hindsight, perhaps inviting Draco Malfoy to Andromeda’s house had been Harry’s second particularly stupid decision after the war. The first being that night on the astronomy tower, of course.
You three had to continue to save me, of course. I had accepted it, with the Fiendfyre. What a stupid decision, but it was alright. If we were going to kill Harry Potter at least I would be dead, too, and the result would not matter.
to him.
“Looking for-” he thought better of it. Paused. Tried again. “Why are you here?”
Soon they were in the corridor outside the potions room again. The air was cooler, here, and Harry felt himself breathing more easily, although he hadn’t recognized how stifling the potions room had been until he exited. Draco followed him out, flanked by Blaise and Pansy.
“The Death Eater legislation the Wizengamot is pushing through,” he began. “Do you think I’d be able to speak against it at the vote?”
“Awesome,” Jason breathed. They took off towards the exit to the common room, only Jessamine remembering to go tap some of the second years on the shoulders. After the roar of noise as they exited, the common room became strangely quiet. Harry felt more tired than he had been before.
“It’s just,” Draco tries to explain, voice muffled as he presses his face into Harry’s chest, in dire need of hugs, “he’s growing up so fast.”
“I’d like to make a toast,” Harry proposes as he rises to face the table. All five occupants turn towards him, regarding him with varying expressions.
They finish the bottle of wine within forty minutes. The storm shows no signs of abating any time soon but Harry is too comfortable to worry about it. By mutual agreement they decide to just set up their beds in the living room, the heat from the fire more tempting than the bed. They pile up all the blankets and cushions they can find in front of the sofa, opting to create one big bundle of comfort because, “Sharing body heat will keep us warmer,” Malfoy says and Harry opts not to point out that the fire is doing a pretty swell job of that already.
Draco huffs and leans against the door; it is tradition. They’ve been going out together every Friday since Blaise’s twenty first birthday. He’s just so tired, having worked four twenty hour days this week to catch up with the backlog that had been piling up since he’d skipped work due a cold last month. Blaise seems to have caught up with Draco’s line of thought as he steps closer with a smirk, “Draco, I’m sure they won’t fire you for being only five days ahead of schedule rather than the ten days ahead of schedule you usually are.”
There’s less hesitancy now but Harry can almost see Malfoy calculating the pros and cons.
Even as he listens to Bronan share stories of old cases, Draco’s gaze keeps drifting to the door. Each time he catches himself doing it, he frowns, making himself pay attention to the conversation and yet, a few minutes later, he’s doing it again.
There’s sweat pooled above the swell of his arse, I watch with bated breath as another drop rolls down his perfectly arched back.
Draco surveys the debris spread around him. The congealed mess in the pan, the half chopped veggies on the cutting boards, the almost empty tin of cookies across from him. He finds himself getting annoyed, he had
“The fates have a cruel sense of humour.”
Based on the photo in the chapter.
It’s not a conscious decision but after hours of going over the theory there’s only so much they can do. They’re aware of their roles, Malfoy will perform the counter curse to end the Fiendfyre while Harry will provide the magical support to boost his.
Only 1 more day! :(
"What about it?"
“Yes.”
As they’re waiting for their drinks, Malfoy speaks up. He’s looking straight at Harry when he says, “I didn’t need your help.”
Draco can’t help it, he ducks down to steal a kiss.

“Besides,” Blaise says, nudging Draco with his shoulder as they wait in the lift and Draco takes the time to check his reflection in the mirror, “if the Ministry would do anything to you they would have to answer to your boyfriend.”
, I care,” he exclaimed, “I can’t believe you would even say that.”
They jerk apart at Teddy’s shriek. Harry takes in his half-finished snowman, who definitely had the upper part of his body the last time Harry had checked, with a sigh.
“Doing a bit of re-decorating?” Harry asked, as he leaned against the wall.
“Uh, it’s okay?” Draco adds on hesitantly, “Harry?”
“Oh for the love of . . . Malfoy, get a grip -”
“Oh. Don’t sulk.”
He straightens with a jerk, eyes widening in surprise as he takes in the sight of Narcissa Malfoy standing in front of him. She’s looking at Harry with a faintly amused expression, an elegant eyebrow arched as she waits.
would be more likely to turn into a planning demon, staying up all night fretting over the seating plan, or the flower arrangements.
“Finally, and this is perhaps the most integral,” Draco says gravely, waiting for Harry to lean towards him a little. “Teddy’s toys and Milly and Zeb and the peacock are here.”
Despite his nervousness about dinner, (
Harry leans back, smirking as Draco's eyes track the hard-earned muscles tensing in his arm. He pulls up one side of the covers, biting back the fond laugh as Draco first carefully moves the camera to the side, barely glancing at the photo that emerges.
He wants to say he’s okay, he wants to take the time to gather his thoughts and build a plan and

“But we always bake cookies together on Sunday,” Draco looks so dejected, Harry can’t resist giving him a hug.
Ignorance sounds like Father’s voice.
Malfoy blinks, his expression stunned as he stares at Harry. Harry, for his part, tries not to smile in glee at how he managed to surprise Malfoy.
For Day#22 of the 25 Days of Harry and Draco Challenge at Slythindor100.
“How are you holding up?”
“Just.” Draco let out a breath, gathering his third favourite blanket from the floor and dumping it onto Potter. “Don’t tell anyone about it. Okay?”
It's the date!!
Everyone laughs, some, like Ron, shout “
Blaise and Pansy have caught up with him by then; Draco shoots them a warning glance, he’s here to have fun.
It’s difficult to take my time, to slow down enough that I don’t make a hurried move and disturb him. I want him to rest but I also want
“I mean no, I don’t want to travel all the way to Paris for some fancy dress robes that we’ll end up wearing only once.”
to make him look less vulnerable.
Draco rolls his eyes, offering Harry a glass of wine. “I’m not sure Emma would have ever forgiven me if I hadn’t.”
Malfoy goes on, running a hand through his hair, “It was in Vienna that everything changed. I don’t know why I chose that city but I did, and one night brought my life of self destruction crashing down on me.” He breathes in, taps the table with his fingers, his brow is furrowed as he recalls those memories, the downwards turn of his mouth reminding Harry too much of sixth year.
Harry and Draco chat! Harry wonders if alternate universes do really exist.

Harry stills. “What do you mean?”
is his chance. He should tell Ron about Malfoy, let him know who his neighbour is.
“No,” Draco hums, tapping his chin with a finger as he tries to remember. “That was a few months down the line. I’m positive had you taken me to somewhere as boring as a dinner at the Minister’s house I would have stopped returning your owls.”

Where they live happily ever after.
He tries staying awake, to keep watch for more nightmares but Malfoy’s soft puffs of breath against his neck and the feel of his heart beating under his palm pulls Harry under too.
why these tags were added now and not at the start of the fic.
Harry nods distractedly, eyes fixed on Draco who is looking at him calmly but Harry can spot the tension in his posture. Harry reaches across the table to hold Draco’s hand and squeezes it, giving him a soft smile as he watches Draco look him over.
“I have a very nice cauldron already, Potter.”
Not happy with this at all, I had a ridiculously exhausting day. I feel bad for sharing such a sucky chapter, hopefully tomorrow's is better!
Harry rolls his eyes.
I spend the night sitting on my hands because the temptation to reach out, to touch and confirm is overwhelming. If he notices, he says nothing.
Potter frowned. “At this time?”
“What are you—”
“Oh, is today mock Draco’s childhood day? I thought we did that every alternate Monday?”
I plot as I write, I don't plan ahead. I have no idea how this fic will end, what other twists and turns Harry and Draco will have to navigate through to reach their happy ending.
“Well, that’s unfortunate because I know for a fact that Teddy really likes you.”
Based on the photo in the chapter.
“I know,” Harry agrees.
“Exciting plans?” Draco points to the watch at Harry’s confused look.
“I travelled, the Malfoy cofers still deep and filled enough to let me live a life of luxury without having to lift a finger. So I left my mother and all my demons behind; the Manor was, and still is, no longer a home for me. It’s tainted by the touch of darkness in every corner, and in the sole portion free from that shadow linger my father’s memories. He might not have been a good man, but he was a good father to me and it saddens me that Scorpius will never get to feel to his love.”
Harry frowns.
“They’re pretty.”
He’s cut off by Ron slamming his hand on the table, loud enough that people down the table stop their conversations to look at them.
“Why is this happening to me?”
“Anyway,” Ron says cheerfully as they walk out the shop, having finally found something worthy of using a bribe to aid in begging for Hermione’s forgiveness, “how are you doing these days? Settling in alright? Hermione wanted me to ask if you had unpacked everything yet and for your sake I’m hoping you have, you do not want her to get on your case about that. She’ll make you work throughout the day till everything’s done.”
“This is crazy,” Harry said, running a hand through his hair. “I wasn’t even
“Right, okay.” Draco wondered if Potter was slightly delirious. He’d heard a lack of sleep could do that. “Anyway,” he continued on before Potter could ramble some more, “did you sleep well here?”
“It’s always something, isn’t it?” Draco cut him off, he leaned tiredly against the door. He hadn’t felt like going any closer.
Frowning at the lack of response, he peeks into the kitchen at the family clock that was a wedding gift from the Weasleys. The glossy black clock hand with Harry’s name on it is pointing firmly at
“Harry?”
Draco is halfway through the prep for a fairly simple stew, frowning at the directions on the cookbook propped open against the sugar jar. There are knives chopping the vegetables, while a rag darts around sweeping up every few minutes.
“To a night of mind blowing sex,” Pansy toasts before downing her shot. “All right, gents, I’m off.”
Thankfully the sidewalk is considerably less crowded, making it easy for him to sprint to the end of the street and into the park. Even though it’s still too bright out for the holiday decorations to be on, there are people strolling along the paths, the sound of children playing can be heard from all the way across the park.
