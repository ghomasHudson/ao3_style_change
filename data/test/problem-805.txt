I move closer to you, try to say that you’re perfect, but your eyes widen and your whole torso leans back and my words die in my throat.
For the first time since Malfoy started touching him, Harry hesitates, staring at the exposed bottom right in front of him. This is Malfoy, he thinks, only now fully realizing.
I wake up to a world of pain, a nightmare-like world of pain and a dark, dark space, I touch the wall, it’s so small in here, I can barely stand upright. I touch some more, my throat is now much tighter, mirroring the small room, maybe even closet. I feel bumps in the ceiling, square bumps, someone walks in the floor above and their steps make dust fall onto my face, I can’t see but, oh no, there are stairs above me, stairs, and I can’t move.
“It’s okay!”
You look at me while I hold your bruised, bloody hands and put the ice bag on your knee.
It’s okay, you whisper, thankfully in a steady voice, and I cling to the words as if my life depends on them.
“What have I done,” I think I hear you say to yourself.
He had improved. He had improved so much that Draco let Potter drag him behind some curtains and kiss him afterwards.
The note is still there. Harry doesn’t think much of it.
You’re lying to make me feel better, you’re blaming yourself to relieve my pain, but it’s only making it worse.
Those eyes.
“It’s okay,” I say quickly, automatically.
“Oh, Draco, it’s not your fault, love.”
He laughed again. It was warmer this time.
Harry pushes forwards some more, letting Malfoy adjust comfortably. He knows he’s far from small, and although Malfoy hasn’t seemed to have had any problems thus far, he doesn’t want to hurt him if he can help it.
The glass. The shattering of it. The little sharp shards everywhere, spraying out into the room, the loud sound as it shatters followed by the sound of it hitting the cold stone floor. I’m in Hogwarts, there is fire and screaming and blood and so much glass. The sounds are so bad, deafening, and all I want is to go somewhere quiet, where there is no war, no fighting, no destruction, no death.
I dare a kiss, a small one to your cheek, then your mouth. You don’t tense up, you don’t tilt your head away.
Harry does his best to ignore the gnawing feeling that arises in his stomach after he leaves Grimmauld place. He doesn’t know if it is lust, regret or pity, or perhaps a mixture of the three, but he plainly refuses to acknowledge how much he drinks the following days to calm the feeling. He also refuses to recognize that he wanks himself raw every night to the thought of a sickly thin body and messy, blond locks. He feels disgusted with himself after taking the shorter route home five days later. He doesn’t find an offering Malfoy, nor anyone else offering. Perhaps it’s for the best; Harry has no faith left in himself to be sure that he wouldn’t take them up on the offer, if only to see if they feel as good or if it’s just Malfoy that has the effect on him.
He furrows his brows at him, squints slightly, and Harry wonders if he’s trying to scowl.
I think you’re already asleep when I say I love you too.
I look around, my wand is gone, there are people everywhere, a stark contrast to the scene just a moment ago, I think I spot your hair somewhere in the crowd.
It would be so easy to shove him away and simply apparate back home to leave him here, with a house and some food and a bed. He knows he wouldn’t even feel guilty for it; it would be more than nice already. But as much as Harry wants to want to do that, he doesn’t want to do that, and he doesn’t move a muscle as Malfoy pulls his pants down and drops to his knees.
And there were seven bar stools. Brilliant.
He looked at the man for some time. He walked over to a group of people, presumably his friends, and Draco wondered for a moment just how easy life could have been had things been different.
No. No. It wasn’t going to happen again. It wasn’t going to, damn it, it’s always never going to happen again. But it always does.
“I’ll get the medicine bag.” I know you prefer the muggle bandages, so that’s what I fix you with. You stay quiet while I bondage you up, wipe the blood away and add the liquid that will kill sickness. Or something. You stay quiet while I close the cupboards, get away the broken glass, lift the table back up. You stay quiet until I give you a glass of water and tell you to drink.
Finally, Harry is all the way inside, and after gripping Malfoy’s hips, he finally starts thrusting. He loses control quickly, completely losing himself in the feeling. And fuck, it feels good, to have a warm, pliant body against is own again, and it feels almost illegal when he remembers who said body belongs to, which only makes it better.
“Follow me,” he says and turns, promptly shoving all his thoughts away. He could take him to a hotel, or a motel, or even a homeless shelter; though, come to think of it, he only knows of magical ones, and he can’t imagine they would do anything for Malfoy. He just knows that he won’t bring slut Malfoy home, though, so that’s not an option either. A thought strikes him then, and as much as the dreads the upcoming apparition, he is set on the decision.
You’re okay.
“People can get fixed, you know,” you say close to my ear. “Like living rooms can.”
Pain in my fist. Pain in my throat after screaming. But most of all pain in my mind.
I’ll be better, you continue. No, Draco, you’re wrong, you’re fucking wrong, this has never been your fault. You can’t be better, you’re absolutely perfect, can’t you see? Have I made you think you’re not perfect?
Every time I’ve shouted at you, it’s felt like this.
You shake your head, stand up on your wobbly knee, suddenly triple in height.
“I’ll get you some food and then you can-” he begins but stops at the feeling of cold skin to his own. He stares dumbly at Malfoy as the hand around his neck curls up into his hair, and then he’s leaning in to brush his lips against Harry’s neck.
But I’m not, you’re the one who always patches me up, you’ll stand there bleeding from four different places with bruises all over and a leg so pained you can barely stand upright and you’ll bondage my thumb because I broke my nail giving you pain.
It takes a concerned Hermione and a confused Ron to snap him out of it two weeks after what he’s started referring to as the incident. He takes them up on the offer to join him in a pub that night to let himself go for a while.
Potter pulled him in for a hug just before he left. Draco didn’t think he noticed when he slid a small slip of paper into his pocket.
I turn, find a small streak of light, try opening the door but it’s shut, of course, oh no, it’s locked, no.
They were looking at him. He could feel it. Every few minutes, he would catch a glimpse of green, and then his skin started burning.
Harry stops once they are away from any potential observers, careful even in a street with several magical shops, and grabs Malfoy’s wrist. He doesn’t miss the flinch it earns him but wills himself not to dwell on it.
I almost miss it; it’s barely a whisper. The winds outside are louder, and it’s not even windy.
“Draco… I’m so sorry, so, so sorry. I…”
It’s okay, darling, I hear, and I almost think it’s him again but I know your voice, I’ll always know your voice. It’s you and thank fuck it’s you, you hold me and hold me and hold me.
You moan, quietly, but that’s not new, you’ve always been quiet in bed, suddenly shy, it’s endearing and it drives me crazy.
We’re okay.
Harry rushes over, but his heart falls as he realizes it’s simply his own address. He throws it away, but the paper simply spins around in the air a few times, then slowly descends into Harry’s lap.
It was very nice. He’d been afraid Potter just wanted some action, but they ended up talking for hours, about nothing and everything all at once. They fell asleep on his bed after Potter had said he’d always thought it was too large for just himself.
The door opens, and he’s greeted with a deep red shirt and grey eyes. He is almost certain that the cheeks aren’t as sunken anymore.
Potter laughed, and of course it was a pleasant laugh.
He leaned in to the touch before he could stop to think about it.
He lifts his wand, and in less than a millisecond, Malfoy has spun around, away from him, with his hands up to protect his face.
You’re a tornado and an earthquake mother Earth herself, you’re so loud, Harry, I want to calm you down but I’m too scared, I can only stare at the wall, through my fingers, I’m sorry I can’t help you more.
Fuck, this is where I belong. Over you, but really below you. All I want is to make you happy, Draco. I know you’d call bullshit on that any day, and you’re right to do so, but it’s true, even as fucked as I am. My place is with you, giving you whatever you crave of me, I’ll give you everything, Draco, please let me try and make it okay for once.
“It’s okay, it- it’s my fault, I’m sorry. It’s okay,” I insist, stepping back and raising my hands, and I swear, I’m not as scared as I sound, Harry.
It’s my fault, you say in a rush, and it makes every thought I have vanish.
The light of the streetlamp over the figure gives away blond hair and a distinctly male body of hard lines.
Your fault? How could you ever think that any of this is your fault?
I should leave, Harry thinks, tries convincing himself. But a sharp clatter that can’t be anything else than Malfoy’s teeth rattling makes all reason go away.
He doesn’t feel whole, won’t for a while, but he feels free, and that is enough.
He continues in a brisk pace, starts feeling confident that he’ll manage to pass him unapproached.
He snaps out of it once Malfoy sways his hips back and forth, getting his attention. He reaches out, teases by circling his finger around, but never breaching, the rim. It earns him a small whine, and he watches, fascinated, as the hole clenches and relaxes. He pushes his hand forwards, lets his index finger slip inside. It feels unnaturally sticky, and Harry pauses before remembering it’s the effect of the spell.
Then he goes, gaze fixed in front of him, mind wandering past current paths.
“Were you scared?” You say. I can hear the words cost a lot.
He forgot to count the seconds before he answered. He found he didn’t really care.
The red shirt sits on the table, neatly folded and with the piece of metal resting upon it. He doesn’t bother counting, but less than a third of the original pile is gone, and the note with his address is where he left it.
You still get angry sometimes. When that happens, you swear under your breath, ball your fists, you might slam a door, but then you go for a walk, and when you get back, you’re okay. You don’t shout anymore. You don’t hit me anymore. I don’t keep the medicine bag next to the sink anymore.
I cry into you, you cry into me, we stand there for an eternity and a little more.
I shouted at you.
Nevertheless. He looked at his shoes for as long as one does before shoes get boring. Then he looked at the shoes of other people. That was much more interesting. He had always thought that the shoes someone wears tell you as much as you need to know about them.
“Would you care to explain why you fought with Hermione and Ron?” Lupin asked, he had an eyebrow raised and his tone of voice was that of a father scolding a young child. Harry would have frowned at him, but it seemed he had a black eye forming and he found the motion to be rather painful.
“Change back, Lord Potter-Black.” The Headmistress said coldly, her own disgust at the man’s Animagus form plain on her face. Harry shifted back, straightening out himself and his clothes before turning to look at the two witches proceeding over him.
Harry sighed and then closed his eyes. Then he started to change. He fell to all fours, his limbs elongating and his skin turned black and he sprouted large, leathery wings. The class finally stood still, some in fear and disgust, others in confusion when his transformation was complete. Draco blinked, trying to understand what he was seeing.
,” she huffed. “But you are a student here, and thus will be treated as such. All the other students are called
“Thank you.” Draco said softly. “Do you mind if I nap here until my next class? DADA was harder than I expected, and I would like to be able to concentrate for Arithmancy.” Snape nodded, and Draco smiled before stretching out on the couch – quickly falling into a light slumber.
inconsiderate and unprofessional of you to insinuate he
Potter-Black. Please accept my apologies for my rude comments.” Harry stared at the witch, as if trying to decide if accepting her apology was worth it or not. The tension in the room was nearly unbearable, as everyone waited with baited breath for his reply. Even McGonagall knew better than to interrupt. A formal apology in the wizarding world was a
“Lord Harry James Potter-Black, Headmistress.” Harry replied, his eyes meeting hers. But once again, his eyes had returned to their normal vacantness, and the slight grin he had held in his lips was long gone. She purses her lips at him.
completed, and took it up to Snape. The potions master looked disdainfully at the flask.
“Very well. Come up here then, everyone else move the desks back.” They all did as they were told, and now everyone was waiting with anticipation, staring at Harry. Some with more awe than others, but all equally suspicious.  “Any time now.” The Headmistress snapped at him.
. I post when I update any chapters for my fics, and I plan to use it in the future for more interaction if it gets any activity on it. I've considered going back to Tumblr, but it has been years and isn't worth my mental health - I left for a reason. But I still love all the comments you guys leave behind here, its honestly feels like heaven when I read them.
But what if they hadn’t? If they didn’t teach him to read properly, what else did they not do for Harry?
“How poetic.” Bill commented once Harry was healed and Draco’s incantation had stopped. Draco turned his head to look at the professor. “That you would be the one to heal the man who had cast the very same curse on you.” Again, there were gasps around the class. Draco stood, anger boiling through his veins.
But he didn’t even make it to the greenhouse before he was stopped. By Neville Longbottom, no less.
“I can’t let you in the greenhouses. Professor Sprout’s orders.” The Gryffindor explained.
Draco stood proud on the platform of 9 ¾, his Head Boy badge glinting brightly in the sun where is sat pinned on his school robes. It had been over a year since his trial as a Death Eater, and by the grace of Merlin (and one Gryffindor), he found himself acquitted of all charges – as were his parents. The road after the war hadn’t been easy by any means, but the Malfoys worked hard to raise their status again – but with new goals in mind. They donated time and money to the rebuilding of Hogwarts and the Ministry, offering assistance wherever assistance was needed. This had not gone unnoticed, and most of the wizarding world was now well aware that without the Malfoy family, the return to normalcy and peace would have taken a lot longer than a year.
“Where the hell has he been this whole time?”
“He is more like me than I realized.” Again, Draco gave him an incredulous look. Severus sighed and leaned back onto his desk. “I know you father told you about my childhood.” Draco grew serious and nodded.
“What are you doing, Mister Malfoy?” Harry asked, keeping his eyes glued to step twenty-one of the instructions.
Pansy was next. “Oh yes, they are quite fetching. They will match nicely with our robes.”
. He had to sacrifice his own safety, well-being and even his own morals to keep his family
He barely ate any food before opening the potion vial and downing it in one gulp.
Hey everyone! Posting this on 09/16/20 to let you all know that I am planning on continuing this fic. I know it has been since... well... fucking forever. I am sorry its taken me so long to get myself back together to try and find the motivation to write again. Its slow going with everything going on, but I really am trying. I've been dealing with COVID-19 induced isolation (I literally leave my house once a week to go grocery shopping) and dealing with a new, but not life threatening, long term medical diagnosis that I got at the beginning of the summer. Plus, my mental health has always been a bit... well... shitty. Heh.
“Of course, Master. But if she harms you, it will be
“Shortly after the war.” The class let out a collective gasp. The wizard standing in front of them, the very man who
Teak glared at Draco, then at Harry. “No, of course not. My apologies, Mister Potter-Black.”
No, the coward, he left and secluded himself in a house full of dark artifacts and knowledge. Never to be seen again, until now. At Hogwarts. And even she knows something is wrong. Even the Sorting Hat has rejected him.
Teak went on and on in a lengthy lecture about why it was important for Animagi to be registered. She even went so far as to use Sirius Black’s escape from Azkaban as an example of the danger and unregistered Animagus could be. The witch didn’t seem to notice how Harry’s usually unnervingly empty gaze flashed with rage, not how he grinded his teeth and his muscles. Draco was waiting for someone to point out that Black had been proven innocent, posthumously, and that his escape from hell-hole in the ocean gave the poor man a few years of freedom to live (and love Harry) before his untimely death.
“So much for being her most frequent patient.” He muttered to himself, turning towards the dungeons. He would still make it to Potions, even if he was slower than usual. Since he would get no medical help from Pomfrey, he focused on trying to analyze his injuries while making his way down to Snape’s classroom.
dead that night.
“What is there to know,
Both Snape and Draco watched silently as Harry closed the door and sat down. Snape eyed him critically. The boy was taller, stronger too, than he had been before. But he was pale, and clearly had more scars – judging by the way his lightening bolt one had grown and the new addition on his cheek. If Severus had to make an educated guess, Harry was probably hiding any number of scars beneath those full length, long-sleeved robes and trousers. The air around him was different as well – both Snape and Draco shivered with the sudden drop in temperature. But it was more than that. Severus could feel the magic that thrummed around Harry – as if he just had too much of it and could not keep it contained.
is what happened to me.” With that, Harry turned and returned to his slow trek towards the hospital wing – once again using the wall for support. Bill snarled and went the other way, stomping his way through the castle. Lupin’s eyes hardened as he watched Harry leave.
“Hogwarts does not need you, anymore. And you do not need Hogwarts, truthfully. We do not know why you are here. Yet here you are, so we must do something with you.
“What do I do now, Kreacher?” Again, his master had barked out a bitter laugh.
“Good morning, class.” McGonagall said primly as she stepped into the classroom. “I am pleased to see so many of you return for your final term. It takes strength to return to normalcy after such events that have taken place over the last several years.” Her heels clicked on the stone floor until she stopped at the head of the calls and turned around. “Even though I am now headmistress, I felt it would be best if I continues to instruct both the seventh and eighth year students, as it is your final term and I do not wish to interrupt your success by introduction a new teacher to you at such a crucial time.”
To prevent any of his magic from leaking out. To prevent himself from blowing up. Because Kreacher knew, just as his Master Harry James Potter-Black knew.
Harry did hear Lupin’s words, and they carved holes into him. Holes he ignored as he filled them with ice. War did not excuse him, no. But what about death? Did death excuse him?
“I didn’t mean for this to happen, Harry.” Harry screamed at the old man, unintelligible curses and insults flying from his lips. Then, Harry jolted awake.
“Well, Lord Potter-Black, we meet again.” The Sorting Hat said, out loud this time – unlike Harry’s first sorting. It seemed this was going to be a public one. Not even the Sorting Hat would give him privacy anymore.
Kreacher was at his bedside, adeptly dodging wayward magic and flying limbs. “I’m sorry Master Harry, I’m sorry. But the dreamless sleep isn’t working very well anymore.” Harry clenched his teeth and turned to the house-elf, finally quieting his own screams even though his body still spasmed with magic and pain. The room was growing icy, frost seeping in through the wall.
“I…uhm. I’m Penelope. Penelope Edgewater.” She said, nervously. Hagrid grinned.
“-you!”
that this curse exists, and how to handle it.” When no one else argued, he nodded and wrote the spell down on the board, along with a short illustration of its wand movement.
So, it went to Harry, by right of conquest. Because Harry had fought Lord Voldemort, had won, and had killed Tom Riddle – the last heir of Slytherin.
He stumbles out of the fireplace, almost losing his glasses, and crashes into a lamp that topples over and breaks, the glass from the light bulb shattering all over the floor.
You step forward, look me in the eyes, say my name again, that you’ve been thinking, and that can only mean one thing, you’re leaving, you know it’s my fault, why did I tell you, you’re going to leave, no, I can’t live without you, Harry, what am I going to do?
“Sorry, I’m seeing someone.”
“Draco…” You sound so broken, look so broken, and I want to cry again, but I have to stay strong for you. I need to.
Harry is taking the shorter way home, even though it’s a slightly dodgier route. He’s seen fights and people that couldn’t be anything other than prostitutes several times, but he’s bloody tired and wants to go home.
You nod, cry a bit more. Stand up, lift a hand, hesitate. Let it fall. Walk over to the bedroom door, open it, turn around. Your eyes pause at my hair, I can tell it’s red, but before you can say anything, I tell you to go sleep, Harry.
You died, I tell you, devastated, you died, Draco, because of me, they took you and I didn’t help you.
Harry wakes up before the birds, before the sun, to buy food and two shirts for Malfoy. He gets one in the same pale green as Malfoy’s old one, as well as a deep maroon red one because he likes it and feels generous. He doesn’t pause to think why before he buys a silver bracelet from a jewellery shop nearby as well.
I kiss you back.
He all but sprints out of the door to find the hotel.
That wasn’t just a reaction of fear, but one of habit and instinct. I’ve taught you to fear my touch.
Harry freezes, tries not to stop, but he knows that voice, and he doesn’t believe it.
I don’t fucking know why I did it.
I flinch backwards.
I have that weekend alone, and it’s horrible. I miss you the second we’ve kissed goodbye, but it’s good for you. To get some time to think. Some time away from me, some time to be free. Some time for your injuries to heal properly. Some time for you to finally realise that you need to get the hell away from me.
Not trusting himself to sleep with Malfoy, he leaves to find refuge in a bedroom downstairs after casting another warming charm and a cushioning charm and spreading the covers over the pale body.
Once he notices the faint marks left from his bite, he can’t stop staring, until he pulls out and flips Malfoy over, not baring the reminder for much longer.
His name again, louder, raspy, husky, sexy.
A hand, now only slightly cool against his skin, guides Harry’s already hard prick to a pair of lips.
I move back, give you some space, not knowing what else to do, manoeuvre the duvet over you, swallow heavily as I hear your quiet crying.
Harry directs his gaze away, swallowing. There are limits to his empathy, and it simply doesn’t lie with whores.
You stir eventually, make a soft sound, and I quickly put my glasses back and pretend to be asleep so you can get your morning to yourself.
Why, Harry?
“You dolt. I’m almost out of money,” Malfoy mumbles as he turns and heads towards the bed.
When I wake up, you’re there next to me, your soft breathing the only sound in our room. I blink at you, you’re very blurry, and it takes me a little while to realise that you took off my glasses again. You always do that, even though I always just use reparo if they break, but in this one case you don’t have faith in magic. I always keep them on. Old habits die hard.
Shh, someone says, softly, close to me, right beside me, and it’s you, isn’t it?
Malfoy doesn’t move, and Harry briefly wonders whether it’s also a whore thing not to stay the night. I’ll find out in the morning, he thinks before he feels the come between them vanish and a careful, bony hand wrapping around his back, and then he promptly falls asleep.
“He’s right. I am lucky, don’t you think?”
There were eight numbers on it. It was a good number of numbers.
“But Draco.”
The foreplay is brief, almost non-existent, and consists of a lick up his entire length and a hard, deliberate suck on the head before Malfoy takes him into his mouth. He bobs his head, once, twice, then moves forward until Harry is as far in as he can go. Harry is almost impressed before remembering that this is what Malfoy does.
I use spells to tidy the room but leave the dishes for you to do tomorrow. It’s one weird thing you fuzz about doing the muggle way, but there’s no way I’ll touch those plates, so you have to do it. I know it makes you feel a little better, and you’re helping me, too.
“Harry, love,” he whispers, then lets himself go.
You’re angry, your fist is everywhere, there is pain, your voice is everywhere, I’m trapped in the corner and you’re everywhere, Harry, there’s no room left. I turn away, I hope you won’t get even more angry, I’m not turning away from you, I promise, please don’t think that, but my face hurts too much and I don’t want you to see me cry.
“You look sick. You’re not well.” Harry expects something akin to ‘well observed, Potter’ in response.
You do.
Five was perhaps his favourite number. It was stable and safe and reliable. Balanced, unlike four, which he felt like had a large gap between the two twos.
“I’m sorry.”
He said yes, of course. How could he not?
The familiar bliss of tiredness that hits once he is ashore, he slumps against the trunk behind him, whispers an affectionate pet name.
You turn to the corner with the small study, if you can even call it that, and I panic. No, Harry, that’s my notes - important notes, good notes, two months’ worth of research, please don’t-
He could see why Potter liked it. The colours were warm and cosy, the lights comfortably dimmed, and people were not too loud.
Malfoy looks astounded at the motion, pauses once his eyes fall upon Harry’s cheeks. It only makes Harry angrier, and he grabs slender thighs in a bruising grip, forces them apart.
“Stay. Don’t leave me in morning,” Harry begs, meeting Draco’s pale grey eyes, then looks away in shame.
We find a faculty – magical, of course, you’re still scared of the washing machine – and they tell us they can fix it, mend the bit that fell off back with magic. The procedure requires a small fortune on our part, and five massive ones to keep their mouths shut, but it’s worth it. You’re even more paranoid about the prophet getting a word of our lives than I am. But they fix you, your beautiful rare smile is back and there isn’t a word about it in the papers.
I shouted.
“I- I was going home, Malfoy. Don’t be delusional.”
It happens again. It always does, were I really stupid enough to forget that?
His love stays mute, he can’t hear his heartbeats nor his name anymore. Hands twitching, embarrassedly shoved into pockets in silent surrender.
It’s okay.
Eyes fall, from green to red, then they close in a last, gentle farewell touch, heart in his throat as hands cup his cheek, grip his shoulder one last time, thumb caressing absentmindedly. Stubble gone, features sober, it feels different.
You tend to me again, care for the few scratches I’ve gotten myself this time, and the relief from me not seeing any blood on you is quickly killed by how you keep touching your ear uncomfortably and how utterly crushed you look.
“Wandless magic, huh?” The blond mutters, then moves back to resume his assault on Harry’s neck. Harry tilts his head back until it touches the wall and tries not to think. He should stop it right now, but he doesn’t want to, and he does, for some unbeknownst reason, not know why.
And suddenly the room is shrinking, the walls moving towards me, pressing in, you’re going deeper, you’re panting, are you angry? You’re growling, are you going to hit me again? The walls are squeezing me between them, like you are pressing at me from everywhere, you are everywhere Harry and I can’t move can’t breathe Harry are you angry is it my fault?
“What do you want from me, then?” He says smoothly with a step forward. Harry fights the urge to step back.
You’re so good, Harry, you say between moans and little gasps. It’s the best thing I’ve ever fucking heard.
One last meeting of lips, then they part, with gentle farewells.
I can’t risk reaching out to you, so all I do is watch, sob with you. You stop crying after an eternity, finally remove your hand, your forearm is soaked red by now, and there is a tiny sound as something hits the ground. I freeze, try finding whatever dropped amidst the million pieces of shattered porcelain, but your gasp when you find it before me brings my eyes back up.
But whenever they met his, he was forced to look away. He knew his own eyes were expressive, too expressive, and he knew that whatever it was he felt, the green eyes would not reflect it. It was the shame, too, of course. Those eyes knew close to everything he had ever done wrong in his life, the only one except himself that knew of it all. He looked away, he simply couldn’t bear seeing hate in those eyes too. Because if he saw hate in the green eyes it would be justified. The others hated him from what they had heard about him. Hated his name, his family, his background. But they didn’t know what he had done – unlike those green eyes.
You’re happy, Draco, and we managed to get through it. I managed not to fuck you up completely, and I’ll never be able to make up for it, but hell, I’m going to try until the day I die.
“Would you like to dance?”
The moment you kiss me back I believe my own words.
You’re on top of me, you’re in me, you’re over me, you’re beside me, you’re everywhere. You thrust and you thrust, it feels good, you’re so good, we haven’t done this in a while but you’re so good. I tell you, and you moan my name, thrust harder. It feels even better, and you pant, and it’s good, you’re sweating all over, I find it hot, so good.
It looks like you’re right. I don’t quite manage to hold back the tears that form from looking at how badly you’re shaking.
If he saw hate in them, too, what was left to live for?
You shout, throw a chair at me. There’s a ringing in my left ear, I can’t hear what you’re saying, I don’t want to hear. The chair hits my thigh and knee, I try to ignore the pain.
He starts sleeping at Grimmauld place, desperate to see the blond again, but they never meet.
The world shifts, you’re there, but in sixth year in your sleek, black suit, I just know you broke the windows, and all I want is quiet.
You’re doing it now, I realise. Something always comes up, and it’s been far too long since we did this, but you’re giving me a chance.
“It’s not your fault. It’s my fault. It’s me, Draco, I know it’s me. I’m sorry.”
You haven’t called me that in ages.
You’re balling your eyes out, too, and I don’t want to interrupt you. I know you’re thinking about those who are not anymore, those who could have been here today, those you claim died because of you.
I put a hand on your shoulder.
I don’t move closer, afraid I’ll push you too far away this time, I merely stand still and cry.
They still had the same effect on him. He just couldn’t stop staring. Can you blame him, really? They really were phenomenal. Greener than the grass on the other side of the fence, brighter than Sirius at night.
Draco? My voice is hoarse, as if I really did scream.
“Come to arrest me?” That voice he knows far too well says, but Harry’s stomach turns at how weak it sounds.
A pair of lips against his own, hesitant, yet zealous, tasting, exploring.
And fuck, it’s so good, to see you finally close your eyes around me, to finally see your hands relax above your head, no longer twitchy and alert.
“No problem,” he muttered to the shoes next to him. They were boots; well worn, but far from falling apart. Comfortable, warm, strong and good in battle. Polished, yet a bit of dirt on them. Much like Potter himself, then. He’d been right again.
“It’s okay,” I repeat.
After several swigs, he throws the empty bottle away and floos back.
“It’s not, though, is it?”
After a moment he realizes he’s not in danger, and pulls his hands away, but doesn’t move closer, wary of the wand still.
Draco was worried about how the fourth time would go. He didn’t live in fours; the number simply didn’t work for him.
The doorbell ringing wakes him up, and he warily checks the judas before opening.
The feeling is back, eating him up from within, and not even a night out with Ron and Hermione makes it go away.
Mind set, he doesn’t hesitate in his steps, doesn’t wait for last attempts at reconciliation, doesn’t pay heed to his name anymore.
“Oh, really? I think every other person alive would say I’m the lucky one. Me included.”
“Sorry,” Harry breathes, following him into the soft cushions, then grabs the collar of his shirt and pulls him into a kiss.
Malfoy is louder now than he was during the blowjob downstairs, and that is saying something, because he was loud. The sounds are only bringing Harry closer to orgasm, and he completely gives up on controlling his own volume.
Malfoy moves to suck him off again, and Harry doesn’t object, addicted to the heavenly deep throating, and finds himself unable to push him off before he comes hard.
The world is spinning, always spinning, changing and shifting and I don’t know where I am anymore.
It’s as good as he remembers, but he can’t get enough, and he tugs on his hair, forces him to go faster. It doesn’t take long before he’s fucking into his mouth, and he’s never been this rough with anyone before, but Malfoy takes it all and doesn’t even gag.
“I know a place, unless you had somewhere in mind?”
Things move quickly. Our clothes are vanished, your suitcase moved inside, our giggling moving into the bedroom and turning into moans, I can’t tell who does what, all I know is that we’re in bed, naked, you under me, me in you.
Next thing I know is that someone tells me to speak, the voice hauntingly familiar but I can’t make him out behind his horrid mask.
“Don’t worry, I have.”
Next time. As if there will be one. I love you. Sorry.
I shouted.
He lets Malfoy fuck him twice until they’re both close to passing out, and then they simply cuddle up in silence. Harry feels like a teenager all over again, with thousands of butterflies in his stomach, and he finally realizes what the feeling in his stomach is. His heart feels close to breaking as Malfoy lifts a hand to absent-mindedly push a stray lock of hair out of Harry’s forehead, lingering in his hair for far too long.
“Suck,” Harry slurs, and the mouth is on him before he can finish.
You growl-
What have I done?
I gently shift to stroke your cheek, pet your hair, kiss you on the cheek. I savour the moment.
You know how important those notes were. You know they can’t be brought back after the incendio. Is it me, am I the problem? Harry, tell me, please – is it my fault?
Growl-
It’s okay. It wasn’t a full tooth, only the bottom half or so, you tell me a while later in a careful voice. We don’t talk about my episodes. I understand why you’re so hesitant. I also understand that you’re trying to make me feel better about the whole thing, but it doesn’t fucking work. Yeah, alright, it wasn’t a whole tooth, just a bit of one. How does that help?
No no no, I fumble some more, want to cry, scream, kick, but I can’t, then I’ll be in here for even longer.
Your voice is heartbroken and it’s breaking my own. I want to tell you that you don’t have to change anything, it was fine like this, great, even, but I know you won’t believe me because I reacted like this. I love when you make love to me like that, hard, hot, intense, I don’t want anything else. I’m sorry, I want to say, I’m sorry I messed up, I’m sorry that you feel sorry because I messed up, not you, but there’s a big fat lump in my throat and I can’t speak. I squeeze your hand back instead.
Shredding the rest of his clothes, Harry walks over to the bed, where Malfoy waits, pantless and fumbling with the remaining few buttons of his shirt with shaky hands. Harry gently slaps his hands away to take over. He isn’t more successful and ends up tearing it apart in frustration, and then tosses it aside. Malfoy anxiously follows the clothing with his eyes, and Harry understands.
“Here. Take the ingredients I’ve already gathered. No one will know.” He handed Harry all the ingredients for the potion and then ushered him out of the store room before anyone saw. Harry looked like he was about to say thank you when Hermione and Terry Boot entered. Draco turned away from the entrance and quickly re-gathered the required ingredients. The tricky part about Severus’ store room for his NEWT-Level class was that it
He went and gathered his ingredients, noting that Harry seemed to understand which potion it was as well.
“Now, as far as have a teacher-supervisor, we decided it would be best to allow you all options. You may choose from any of the heads of house, or myself, as your teacher supervisor. As such, we will be the ones in charge of your discipline and mentoring. Understood? Good. Now, we’ll go around and see who wants who, shall we?”
“He kept reading and re-reading the instructions and ingredients list. And I saw a couple pages of notes about the potion and the steps to brew it. He took so long because he can’t read properly, Severus. Not because he doesn’t know how to brew. He follows the letters with his finger and has to sound out the words on his breath.” Draco explained. Severus sucked in a breath.
Harry started screaming again, letting his body do what it wanted. The pain felt… right in a way. Like it was his just punishment for deciding to live when he should have died. Punishment for being greedy and having the magic of three men when he was barely a man himself. It tore him apart, until he could not longer separate his body from the freezing hell that was his room. Until his magic attempted to pull him back together, but the pieces kept getting more and more disjointed each time.
, he repeated to himself. He wanted to laugh at this ridiculous situation, but found that he couldn’t. Instead he closed his eyes and held back a sigh.
getting my claws into
. He thought as he half-stumbled, half-dragged himself out of the Great Hall.
Harry had left the Great Hall as soon as he saw the title on the front page of the paper. Of course, it was Rita Skeeter. And as he skimmed the article, he sighed. Closing his eyes once more as his heart threatened to pull him under with pain. He shoved the feeling down, until he felt the safe, welcoming emptiness that ate at his soul. Kreacher popped into the room, carrying a small tray of food.
“Nothing, Professor Snape. Just wandering.” He answered honestly, earning him a raised brow from Snape.
“Well,
a freak. Unnatural. He was supposed to have died, but instead he lived. And now that he
the ability to cast a Patronus, a man so evil he abandoned his pregnant girlfriend, killing his own child by causing her to miscarry. How do we know he not the next He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?
“Stop, Mr. Malfoy.” Said a soft, yet commanding voice from the very wizard he had just healed. Draco turned to look at him, tears pooling in his eyes.
“We are not arguing about titles and names right now. We are discussing how you just
. For your entire life. I will not accept that it
That wasn’t the worst of it, though. No. That night, that entire day, had been hell. For Harry. For Kreacher, who was desperate to keep his master’s temperature down and to keep him from dying. Because Harry James Potter, now Potter-Black, had been the person who killed the
?” Draco flushed, and Severus smirked.
“I… I know I haven’t treated him fairly in the past. I let my own hatred and anger towards his father blind me to the boy in front of me. I promise I won’t do that again. I will give Harry a fair chance, and I will treat him with the respect and consideration he
“First you know up my sister and leave her, and then you fucking defend death-eater scum, then you fucking disappear into that mangy, dirty house Sirius gave you – practicing who knows what magic! The you dare to come back here and act like you are better than us? FUCK YOU HARRY!” Ron bellowed, and finally someone got the red-head away from him. Harry was sprawled on the floor, on his back, he hadn’t even bothered to try and curl up and defend any part of his body.
It was Blaise who spoke first. “Of course, you great, insufferable prick! Of course, we will wear them.”
“Please,” Draco said, holding up a hand to stop her. “Call me Draco. We are all Prefects and Head Boy or Girl in here, I see no reason to call each other by surname. It is an old-fashioned tool to look down on others, and I don’t know about all of you, but I am quite finished with that nonsense.” All the prefects nodded, agreeing with Draco. Only Hermione and Ron seemed reluctant.
“Harry James Potter!” She trilled. “You have no right to bind her indefinitely like that! You will undo it!” McGonagall’s face had turned a bit red as she tried to make Harry yield to her.
But terrified because of the look in his eyes. He knew that look. Draco had the same eyes back in his sixth-year. Dull eyes, empty. Lost. Void of anything but despair because there was no hope.
Not even a whisper of light.
“Oh, nothing. Neville Longbottom stopped me before I got to the greenhouses, said I am ‘too cold’ to go in, that I’d kill the plants. Which, is true. But – “
“I’m not going to help. I’m merely going to
“How do you know?” he whispered.
“What about Divination and Care of Magical Creatures?” Snape asked, a little confused. It was well known that lazy students took Divination for an easy class, and Care of Magical Creatures for the same reason or because they liked Hagrid.
, even in the name of education and teaching how to counter it.” Draco argued, not seeing Harry – who was learning back in his chair, his face resigned and eyes closed as if forcing away a horrible memory.
He had seen Kreacher around the castle the last couple of days, as it seemed Kreacher was making sure Harry was fed and taken cared of. Even the castle house-elves no longer adored Harry, and he had overheard that they were refusing to send food up to him at the table Minerva had conjured for the Houseless boy. Kreacher was the reason the boy was eating his meals and had his potions. Severus shuddered at the thought of what would happen to Harry if Kreacher died or otherwise couldn’t (or wouldn’t) serve him properly.
“It broke.”
“No, it seems you have already settled my belongings and placed the usual wards. That will be all, for now.” Harry said, and Kreacher bowed before disappearing again.
“It’s…. L’rd H’rry P’tt’r-Bl’ck.” He slurred, barely recognizing the shock of blond hair in front of him. He slumped to the side, only to caught by another pair of hands.
Draco finally lost his patience and wandered over.
He repeated it over and over. His ultimate wish, his ultimate goal. Death. Silence. Maybe not peace, but at least there would be no more
“Divination is worthless to me, and I honestly don’t feel like going near another prophecy again if I can help it. I am quite done with those. I took Care of Magical Creatures because I liked Hagrid and he was my friend and I wanted to support him. That doesn’t apply anymore.”
either.
, all of its ingredients and why they work together to make this particular potion at this particular strength next Friday. Understood?” Snape asked in his harsh, mocking tone.
Draco stared at him, and then stared at the pin. The pins had held a certain warmth to them before, and felt light in his palm. But now they were cold and heavy, as if Harry’s magic weighed them down. He knew then, that these pins would never fade or dull, the magic would never weaken. Whatever Harry’s magic touched would forever change, that was certain.
“I have decided to introduce you eighth-year students to a particularly advanced subject of Transfiguration, in order to provide you the knowledge and opportunity to try and become Animagi. It will be the primary focus of this year, as mastery of this shows mastery in all of Transfiguration. We will, of course, still go over many other subjects as well.” The class erupted into excited chatter on the announcement, all of the students wondering what kind of animal they would become. The Headmistress allowed it for a minute before calling their attention again. “Today, a Ministry official is here to go over Animagus laws and regulations, as well as the registration process.” She waved her wand at the door and it opened, revealing a short, thin, middle-aged woman with brown hair and hazel eyes. She walked in with a smile on her face as McGonagall introduced her. “Everyone, please welcome Mrs. Teak.”
“Its not… your fault. Was… bound to… happen.” He said between breaths. “But your… wards are… holding… well.” Kreacher nodded, and knowing his Master could not be solaced when in this condition, and that there was nothing he could do, even with his elvish magic, he disapparated. Leaving Harry to suffer the aftermath of his nightmares alone.
how his godfather liked to organize his supplies, and said godfather had made sure Draco could identify most ingredients by the end of his fourth year.
It was his mantra, his solace, his purpose to live. He lived to find a way to die. Because so far, he hadn’t been successful.
“Potter-Black.” Harry cracked open one eye, and was greeted with the stern face of Severus Snape.
But Harry woke and got ready for the day, finding that the hot shower did nothing to warm him up, and that he was indeed as pale as he thought he was when he looked in the mirror. Luckily, he was able to shower and get ready without anyone else coming into the bathroom this time. He would take that one small victory, knowing what the day would become due to the article that was printed yesterday.
Harry closed his eyes, and did not open them before he started replying. “It does not matter what you think, or what Mister Malfoy thinks, or what the world thinks. Even
. Even a simple walk to the library was a marathon for his master, who no doubt was accosted by the constant memories the castle served him.
“I doubt anyone would mourn me for anything, Professor.” Harry sighed and sat up, struggling with trembling arms and cold, sore muscles.
“It’s not his fault, Severus.” Draco chided, as if he could read his mind. Severus paused to check his Occlumency shields. No holes. Draco just knew him, as annoying as it was.
“Lord?”
“Yes, six courses.” Harry confirmed, blandly. For whatever reason, Snape had a sinking feeling in his gut about Harry taking the Curses class. But there was nothing he could do about an unfounded hunch.
too fast,” the potions master mumbled to himself before sitting back down and losing himself to his thoughts.
Harry glared at the portrait before entering. He hated that man, and probably would for a long time. Perhaps forever. No one would ever understand
“The world is a cruel place, and it can’t be fixed overnight. Not even one year is enough, and there are people here who will provoke you on purpose. Who will try and hurt you – and a lot of that is my own fault for my behavior before the war.” He looked up finally, meeting eyes with his fellow Slytherins. “I just want to keep you all safe, as much as I can. So please, will you wear them?”
“Potter-Black – “ Snape stood, trying to stop the young wizard, but Harry had already left – disappearing into the dungeons. “He moved
. For the first few blows, no one moved – other than Ron punching Harry, of course. Then Hermione started pulling on Ron.
“With all due respect, Ma’am.” Draco interjected before she could start screaming again. “What he did was perfectly legal, and should have been expected by Mrs. Teak when she started insulting his godfather and then issued a formal apology. It is not his fault she did not take consideration for her actions. He simply acted as the head of his household, a lord, and a proper wizard. You cannot make him undo the bind.” Minerva shot a glare towards him, then looked at Mrs. Teak. The smaller woman nodded, confirming that what Draco said was indeed true.
“What do we do?” Draco asked, wrapping his arms around himself.
Harry could not cast it. The rest of the world would see this as confirmation that Harry
He came into the Black’s as well. With that, came a change in his status – and a requirement to change his name to Potter-Black in order to maintain
The Gryffindors had Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, and Fay Dunbar. Hufflepuff only had Hannah Abbott and Ernie MacMillan. Ravenclaw brought in Terry Boot, Michael Corner, and Padma Patil. Slytherin had Millicent Bulstrode, Tracey Davis, Daphne Greengrass, Pansy Parkinson, Draco Malfoy, Blaise Zabini, Theodore Nott, and even Gregory Goyle. Then, there was Harry Potter-Black. As usual, they sat in pairs. Hermione and Ron, up front and center as usual. Fay sat with Hannah, Ernie with Michael. Terry and Padma paired up. Slytherin divided into their usual pairs, Millicent and Pansy, Tracey and Daphne, Greg and Theo, Draco and Blaise. Only Harry was alone, taking the table at the very back, in the corner.
Snape eyed him, before notating on the parchment. “Very well. So only six courses?”
“Thank you, Kreacher. But you best get out of here before she gets her claws into you.” Kreacher bowed.
Draco’s jaw dropped. The Golden Boy, the Boy-Who-Lived, Champion of the Light, Defeater of Voldemort, War Hero… could no longer cast a patronus. Could no longer cast a charm that was heralded as light magic, that no dark wizard could cast.
, as his master did not tell anyone. Did not correct anyone when they assumed he deflected the curse – just as he had done as a baby.
“Not yet, Headmistress.” Said the hat. “We have one more who needs to be placed tonight. A person who must be re-sorted.”
“If a conjure a stretcher, can you two get him down to my quarters in the dungeon?” Snape asked his Slytherins, and they nodded. “Good. Pansy, I need you to go with Kreacher to Potter-Black’s quarters. I need to see
“Is that a good or a bad thing?”
“No, I won’t make you say it out loud.” He confirmed. “But I though Professor Sprout was above rumors, above judging students based on what others said of them. It appears that I was wrong.” Neville grimaced, and took a step back. As if he

. Something a concerning, actually.”
It was laugh of someone resigned to their fate.
the potion, what he had done was done correctly – almost perfectly.”
“My dear boy – “ Dumbledore.
“I though he was committed to St. Mungo’s?”
“Thank you for your benevolence.” She recited the formal words required to prevent any magical backlash against her for the insult to Harry. “I must ask, though. Why did you reply in parseltongue first?” Harry’s eyes flashed with something akin to wickedness, and the corner of his mouth tilted ever so slightly into a smirk.
“Yes, he will be teaching about curses, their counter curses, and how to break them. Are you interested in it?” Snape raised an eyebrow. Draco was practically as bad as Granger when it came to consuming knowledge.
If you have a twitter, I have one for this account. It is
work together. Today, you will identify and brew the correct potion based on the list of ingredients. You have the full four hours of class to brew the correct potion.” With that, he sat at his desk at the front of the room. Draco smirked. This was too easy.
Teak swallowed thickly, composing herself from the verbal whipping the Malfoy heir had given her. “My apologies, Mister Malfoy. I did not – I did not mean any disrespect to you.”
Snape had only managed to send Harry his Hogwarts Letter for this year because he saw Kreacher in Knockturn Alley buying potions (specifically Dreamless Sleep) and had asked the elf to deliver the letter. Even then, there had been no response as to whether or not he would attend, and no one knew he had return to Hogwarts until the Sorting Ceremony two days ago.
“No.” Harry declined again, sitting firm and upright in his seat, arms crossed over his chest.
“I will, Kreacher. But you need your rest as well. Now go on, I’ll be fine.” Kreacher eyed his master once more, but nodded and popped away. Harry winced at the noise – it felt like the loud crack was ricocheting around in his skull.
“Ah, good morning Professor Snape.” Harry greeted, unmoving from the floor.
"Don't worry about it. I simply did what I wanted."
Harry couldn’t help himself; the pins were well made, but they could be
From third year and above, the professors met their students in pairs. It would have taken too long to meet them all individually, but more than two would have meant that each student would not receive the individual consideration they deserved. Additionally, the pairs helped those students who may be shyer speak up about themselves due to the comfort a classmate, and friend, could provide.
“I call one Lord Harry James Potter-Black to come up to be resorted.”
“Nice ta meet you, Penelope. Names Hagrid. How ‘bout we get you in that boat over there with them nice girls, I’m sure you all will get along alright.” She nodded and he stood up, offering his hand. She took it, and allowed him to lead her over to the boat where he introduced her to two equally nervous looking girls. Satisfied of a job well-done, he jogged to the carriages where he caught the last one. The scene was eerily similar, as everyone from his train compartment (including the mysterious stranger, who was once again hidden under his cloak) was there.
Minerva called the feast to an end, asking all to leave except the heads of house and the returning eighth-years. When they assembled, she briefed them on how they had their own tower, with their own common room separate from their respective houses but they were allowed to return to the common rooms of their houses ay any time. The

that the wards be air-tight, not allowing even a
“What do you mean it doesn’t matter?!” Draco yelled. “This isn’t a cock-measuring contest, this is life. It was
“I know.” He sighed. “But it is concerning that he can no longer cast a patronus. Everyone knows that dark wizards can’t cast a patronus.”
“And where are you going with this? How does this relate to his reading?”
“I accept your apology.” He said in English this time, his voice low, quiet, but powerful. Teak gulped.
. As mister is not my title, and Harry is reserved for close friends and family – and since I have none of those, you are not included.”
“Well, Mister Potter?” The Headmistress trilled. Harry leveled her with a
control over the ancient magic of the House of Black.
. Harry wondered, and let out a small sigh.
Definitely not a stag.
He did indeed find his friends in one of the last compartments, Blaise, Greg, Theodore, Millicent, and Pansy were all sitting and having a quiet conversation, ignoring the sixth occupant of the carriage. Draco noticed the man immediately, and pointed to him, mouthing
As always, I love you guys for all of your support and everything. It truly helps to know that you guys are out there and waiting to read this thing. Thank you for sticking with me. <3
“Your wand, please. You will need it to cast the charm.”
“Wait.” Severus commanded and Draco stopped moving towards the door. “Sorry, Draco. I was lost in thought.” Draco gave him a look, much like Lucius would have given him had he been there. “I made a realization about Potter-Black that I hadn’t considered before.”
heir of Slytherin. But magic that belonged to Slytherin himself will not simply die, will not simply vanish from the world. No. It must go
“Potter-Black, what are you doing down here?” Drawled one intimidating Potions Master as Harry rounded a corner and nearly ran into the older man. Harry lifted his gaze from the floor to meet the professor’s onyx eyes.
But he didn’t think the rumors – even if true – warranted the hatred coming from the Gryffindors. Although, they were Gryffindors. Not always the thinking, rational type.
Draco stared ahead, masking his curiosity. But he was really curious about it now. What kind of animal would Harry’s Animagus be?
“I cannot believe you,” the Headmistress turned back to Harry, bearing down on him with disappointed, angry eyes. “That the son of two of my favorite students would do such a thing so easily, so readily. I once thought you could have been one of the strongest, most pure wizards the world would have ever known. Clearly I was wrong.” She was turning away to stalk her way back to the front of the class when Harry spoke, his voice barely a whisper.
Draco jumped slightly. He knew it wasn’t a gay bar, yet the voice was unmistakably male. Perhaps it wasn’t a big issue in the Muggle world, then – no one around them seemed to mind. He tried smiling back, but he knew it wasn’t a particularly good attempt. He wasn’t good at smiling. He wasn’t good at looking people in the eye, either. The man must think he was a total git.
“Yes,” Malfoy agrees, moves the hand on his cock faster. “Yes, oh, fuck, Harry,” he whines, then comes all over himself. Harry pulls out, follows him, painting his chest with more spunk, then collapses on top of him.
Goodnight, Draco. I’m really sorry, I’ll... I’ll try something different next time.
I’ve been thinking, you know, I say instead, as gently as I possibly can after screaming at you and the world for what feels like hours.
He had counted twenty-eight people – fifty-six shoes – before he was interrupted. He would have preferred thirty-five, but twenty-eight was not a bad number, either.
He continues to drink, albeit somewhat less than he did during the weeks prior.
I’ve broken you. I’ve taken away my Draco and replaced him with someone very, very broken.
I fall apart in front of you.
You get out of it quickly, but you’re so angry with yourself that you don’t calm down, you just hit furniture instead of me, shout, I thank merlin for silencing charms.
“That’s what they all say when they haven’t made up their minds yet,” Malfoy drawls boldly with another step forward. The sparse lighting of the dodgy alleyway shifts over his body, enough for Harry to see lips bordering blue and too pale skin.
Harry wakes in the middle of the night sweating and panting. Malfoy is eyeing him warily with his arms still around him, and he realizes he’s had a nightmare, though he can’t remember what about.
A hand sliding around his waist brought his attention back to Earth. He knew who it belonged to before the owner spoke.
“The spell is imbuo,” Malfoy says, catching on.
I can’t hold the tears back anymore, I’m so sorry, Draco, please believe me, please understand even though I’m too big of a coward to say it.
He doesn’t change his walking speed, hoping and expecting that his Auror robes will deter any such approach. These people know as well as him that selling sex is illegal, and he could very well get them arrested if they try anything.
“Drink. It’s okay. And then get some sleep, you need to rest.”
It’s okay. It is. You don’t mean it. It’s my fault. It is okay, I’ll be better. It’s okay.
His head hurts, his stomach aches with that strange feeling again, and the world is spinning around him. It hurts, everything hurts, and he feels pathetic when he starts crying into Malfoy’s neck.
The first time he saw him was at a ministry ball. Well, the first time since school anyway.
He briefly considers apparating but decides against it; he’d be nauseous for the rest of the evening, and he’d rather just relax.
Your voice breaks at the end.
Was I?
His eyes freeze at the elegant scrawl that, on the backside of the note, writes out five words and a three-digit number.
You kiss me. Your lips taste of salt.
Draco! I call out, you don’t hear me, but they do, they laugh at me, charge after you, and I scream and scream after you, but it’s not enough, I’m not enough, fuck, they’ve got you now, they’re forcing you to the ground, no, the laughter is so painful and they have me in a body bind and there is a flash of green and the laughter and the faces all melt together into the man I hate the most-
And it was five words that changed his life forever. It was only fitting, Draco thought, even if one of the words was his name and kind of didn’t count.
“Fuck, I’m close,” he eventually pants, and when Malfoy doesn’t budge but rather seems to double his efforts, he pulls his head off by tugging at his hair. The motion is harsher than he intended, but he doesn’t care.
My instincts tell me to back off like I always do, wait until you get the medicine bag and hide your injuries because that’s what we always do.
It’s okay, I almost say, but my voice is too hoarse, and you’re too quiet. I pat your hair instead. Your lovely curls. Massage your head. You close your eyes, a few more tears fall out.
I heal your wounds again, but I don’t say anything. You don’t either, but I can see your regret clear as day in your eyes. Your whole face. You’re so expressive, Harry, and I love that about you, it makes you so beautiful when you’re happy, but it’s excruciating to see you like this.
“Shame. Well, they’re lucky, whoever it is. Have a nice day.”
I don’t shout at you. I’ve never shouted at you. But I shouted at you.
Is it my fault?
The first blow is always relieving. It’s right, it’s familiar, it makes me safer when I fight back, when I resist. I didn’t for a long time. I can now. It feels good. The second is always in frustration, because the world is still cruel, there isn’t quiet yet. And after the second, all I feel is pain.
You talk to a muggle with a strange title who makes you draw, go on walks and take white muggle pills, and some coloured ones, too, every single day. You make treacle tarts on Tuesdays. You find fancy charms to enlarge my little study. You even light candles and buy flowers on special evenings to surprise me.
“Make me feel better, then,” Malfoy whispers instead, a mere foot away from Harry now. He can’t move.
The bright sun, winking at him from above. A careful wind, tickling, teasing, sending a shiver down his spine. Carefree skies, drifting past, for ever moving with an impossible determination. A tranquil quiet, letting him breathe.
I shift, give you my best, we’re both close, I can tell, but suddenly and as if I’ve flipped a switch, you change. Your moans stop and give to a desperate whimper, your hands clutch the bedding and then come up in front of your face to protect yourself, you tighten around me and squirm around frantically until I slip out, then you stop moving and freeze in a foetal position below me. I don’t need to look to see that you’re soft.
One Wednesday night, Kreacher shows up in the living room, and he gives Harry one sour look before dropping the little note he’d been holding to the floor.
Shutting down his thoughts again, he unlocks the door, retreats to his bedroom.
But all you say to this is a quiet it’s okay, Harry, I’m here now, and then you kiss my nose and hug me tight. It’s hard to have more nightmares when you sleep in the arms of an angel.
Draco didn’t get lunch breaks, so he took the day off instead. It was worth every second.
“I’ll get fixed. I promise.”
It was a miracle they hadn’t seen each other before, he thought. Perhaps they just hadn’t been looking.
You pant harder, grunt, growl-
The blond simply gives him a ‘hm’, then lets his gaze fall, raking down his body and back up to his eyes.
You’re usually up before me, so I don’t waste the time I get to look at you. You’re so beautiful like this, unguarded, relaxed, unbothered by any of my horrid outbreaks.
He is hard again quicker than he thought possible, and almost forgets the spells before sinking into Malfoy. It, too, is as good as he remembers, and he can’t stop thrusting harshly into him.
You’re quiet for a very long time.
You look so incredibly sad, and I know it’s me, it’s always me, why did I think I could make you happy?
Things were different.
Was I bothering you? Did I do something?
If the desperate whines and high-pitched moans are anything to go by, Malfoy is getting closer too, and in a sudden desperate need to hear him come through his own sounds, Harry sinks his teeth into the flesh of his shoulder to quiet himself, somehow finding pleasure in Malfoy’s moan of half-pain, half-arousal.
You finally meet my eyes when I speak again, you pick up your reading and I finally hear that free, heartwarming laugh I thought I’d just made up in my head again. You found it out, the wolfsbane thing, even without your notes, and you’ve found a way to brew it safely and without any side-effects.
And, sometimes, I even do the dishes.
You were. Probably still are. It kills me.
When I get angry again in the living room is when I fully understand what the hell it is I’ve done to you.
Once he gets back, he neatly arranges the items out by the kitchen table in a way he hopes Malfoy will like. He vanishes the food in the fridge and cupboards without even bothering to check what is worth saving and piles the bags worth of food inside.
“It’s okay.”
By the time Draco left, Potter had become Harry, somehow.
It takes him half an hour of waiting before he gets his answer, and it’s whispered so quietly he almost misses it.
The second time he saw him - since school, that is - was at the Ministry. Potter and his team of aurors were in a hurry, it seemed, but he still managed to grab Draco’s arm and pull him aside.
“What are you…” Malfoy mumbles, words muffled by the pillow, then he turns his head to look back at Harry.
You hold out your bloody hand. There is glass stuck inside the palm. Your hand is shaking, and you look at me with such big eyes, they’re so full of sadness, I can’t…
It’s okay, you whisper, high-pitched and shaky and too quick.
Hard bodies moving in sync, long nails scraping desperately, stubble scratching neck, lewd, wet sounds making them blush.
You don’t say it back. This time I don’t expect you to. I’ve never hated myself more than I do in this moment.
His name, whispered softly close to his ear, hands moving to his hair, tugging and pulling and hauling, the mild pain mixing with that of the roughness digging into his bare back.
People can get fixed, Draco love, and living rooms can, too. We’ll fix them both. I’ll get fixed, I promise.
It makes me flinch.
“No, I’m going to fuck you,” Harry says, apparently more surprised by the words than Malfoy, who immediately moves over to the bed.
Were you afraid?
We’re okay.
You’re never more vulnerable than this, I think. We both know that even as good as your charms are, I’m stronger, your wand is too far away, and I could easily pin you down and kick and hit and punch and elbow and choke you. And we both know that, for whatever reason, you wouldn’t move a muscle if I did.
They didn’t kiss the last time, and perhaps it’s a whore thing not to, but Harry doesn’t care. He locks lips with Malfoy, who tries to turn his head but is too slow. Harry doesn’t care, and when Malfoy returns the kiss a moment later, the weak protest is long forgotten.
And so, when he spots a figure leaning against a wall in a seductive way, he isn’t surprised in the slightest.
He grabs Malfoy again and apparates, this time to what he thinks he remembers is the nicest bedroom. It’s still dusty, and smells strange, but Malfoy doesn’t seem to care, because he’s already at his knees again.
He didn’t usually drink at all, but he let Potter buy him two drinks that evening. If he was honest with himself, it was mainly because he would have to pay back, which of course meant they had to meet again.
This is how it used to be. Before. When we’d just moved in here together and could fuck as much as we wanted. When I could lose myself like this, get rougher, without me being afraid of hurting you, without you being afraid of me hurting you.
A lamentable, inexplicable desire to stay, then it disappears as they break apart, cheeks wet, tongues silent.
“At this hour? Don’t you think that’s unlikely,” he replies, trying to give little away and keep the upper hand.
Harry is so unprepared for the sight of Malfoy in the green shirt that he immediately floos to Grimmauld place.
He wanted to look at them. He really did. But it was too much, too painful, too scary, so he didn’t. Instead, he found his own shoes to look at. He had polished them himself, for three hours exactly. Never four, four was a bad number, but sometimes two if he was busy.
The hands, minutely warmer now, trail down his body to rest at his waist. As the lips move up his face, getting dangerously close to his lips, the hands reach his belt, and undo it quickly, as if they’ve done it a hundred times before. Which, Harry thinks sourly, they very well might have.
Your hand snakes out to touch me.
And I ruined everything. Again.
Remembering the bottle of firewhisky he bought, he rummages the cupboards until he finds it. It’s half empty, and the discovery thrills Harry.
“I’ll get the medicine bag,” I say instead. My voice wobbles so much that it is barely recognizable, but I know you understand me.
“Hi there, you’re quite something. Can I get you a drink?”
I make my own blood go away with my wand, heal myself with my wand, still not feeling too sure about the muggle stuff.
And you think it’s your fault.
Your head sinks into your hands. Your shoulders shake. I watch you fall apart, sink into yourself, begin to hate yourself. I convince myself I believe you; you sound so sincere. It’s true this time, I can tell.
My mouth goes dry when I catch the gap in your otherwise flawless row of teeth, and I stare dumbly at the wall as you move to clean up the mess on the floor and bandage my hand.
“Find the floor interesting, Malfoy?”
When Draco woke up, he found two bright green emeralds looking at him fondly, offering him breakfast.
“You’re a fucking slut, Malfoy,” he says harshly to remind himself, hates how his voice wobbles.
I’m walking through diagon ally, I can’t remember why but I know it’s important, and it’s eerily empty wherever I look. Quiet, too, but the wrong kind. Too quiet.
But it’s cute. I like it when you do things like that, things that you don’t realise you don’t have to do but that you do because you want to help.
“Sorry for what, Mister Longbottom?” He asked, his voice smooth and low. Neville sighed.
He just wanted to be Harry. But he knew he would only ever find that in death. So that is what he sought. Death.
Hey everyone! Sorry I have been AWOL! But here is a new chapter! Thank you for your patience!
“Thank you, Professor. I’ve had an excellent instructor.” Snape shooed him away with a wave of his hand and Draco knew better than to push his luck. He waltzed back to his desk, taking the time to check in on Harry. It looked like he was
“The world would mourn your absence from my class.”
died for you.” Harry turned to see his parents and Sirius standing there. “At least if you had died in the forest, we wouldn’t have to watch what you have become. A disgrace. You are no son of ours.” It was his father speaking, his mother just standing with heartbreak in her eyes. Sirius just turned away from him, ignoring, refusing to
Snape stared at Harry, and let out a long-suffering sigh. “Has it not occurred to you that you did not lose loved ones in the war because
“The bloody fucking hell is this?” That was Weasley.
“HARRY JAMES POTTER, LOOK AT ME WHEN I SPEAK TO YOU!” She screeched at him.
“Do you remember the effects of Dreamless Sleep addiction, and the effects on the body once the potion become ineffective?”
“There is precedent, Headmistress. It is not common, for it is not often needed. But it is needed now. May I proceed?” The hat asked, his voice dripping with sassiness. Draco quite liked the Sorting Hat.
to cook for us and serve us? What, are you too good to eat the same food as us now?” Harry narrowed his eyes.
“I apologize for my tardiness, Professor Snape, Mister Malfoy. I also couldn’t help but overhear - and I am glad to see that the ending of the war has done good things to both of you. Of everyone, you two deserve the peace and freedom you’ve earned.”
“Yes.
“Draco, Blaise, hold him.” Severus said without preamble as he knelt next to Draco. “Open his mouth, Pansy.” She did as her professor instructed and Harry started trying to resist. “Stop it, Potter-Black. We’re here to help. It won’t be pleasant but it must be done.” He then poured a bright yellow potion into the wizard’s mouth, holding his hand over his mouth afterward, making sure he swallowed it down. Harry suddenly stopped struggling and went limp in Draco and Blaise’s arms.
“Very good, Draco. Who do we know that matches this?” Draco closed his eyes, suddenly overwhelmed with emotion. His heart broke in two and tears started streaming down his eyes. Severus silently embraced him.
Draco saw Minerva whispering with Mrs. Teak, probably encouraging her to leave if she wanted to, but the woman stayed. The Headmistress cleared her throat. “Now, if any of you are Animagi already, or think you might be close, please speak up now.” Draco turned to look at Harry, waiting with baited breath. He was not disappointed. Harry stood and cleared his throat.
It turns out the rumor is true, but there is much, much more to this story than what meets the eye. First of all, it seems our ex-savior was ousted from Gryffindor House by the Sorting Hat, who decreed the boy to be Houseless – worthless and unworthy to any of the houses.
“It is what it is, Professor.” Harry finally said. “I don’t blame him, or anyone else for what they think of me. I’ve changed, and they can tell.” He then set his now empty tea cup back onto the tray. “I didn’t come back to Hogwarts for friendship or acceptance, or anything silly like that. So, it doesn’t really matter. Not anymore.”
Harry hated the deceased headmaster, but no one had done what he did. No one had Albus Dumbledore dictating his life like he was a marionette, a tool useful to win the war. Nothing more, nothing less.
Harry speaks with Snape and Draco, and attends his first class of the year – DADA with Professor Lupin.
“Master Draco.” The house elf greeted with a bow. “It is nice to see you again, but please tell me what has happened to Master Harry.”
Draco stared at the creature in front of him, finally understanding what he was seeing. Harry was an Animagus. And it was also clear why some of the students couldn’t see him, and why some could.
“Just… lemme go…” Harry mumbled. He attempted to sit up but his arms wouldn’t move. “I’ll… be fine. Always fine. Just fine.”
they do
Just as it should be and would continue to be.
It was then that Draco stepped forward, a bag in hand.
“Paleness of the skin, shakiness, a feeling of unending cold, weakness of the limbs, nausea, dizziness, and loss of appetite.”
Snape strode into the classroom, closing the door and walking to the front of the classroom – his robes billowing menacingly behind him. “I will not tolerate and pranks, tears, or incompetence in this class. If you think I will allow
. But the magic within Harry had stopped every attempt. Hanging. Drowning. Falling. Cutting. Muggle Drugs. Suffocation. Muggle Weaponry. None of it worked. His magic cut the rope, filled his lungs with air, stopped him before he hit the ground, sealed his wounds before they bled, flushed the toxins from his system, blew the plastic bag to shreds, stopped the bullet.
“Very well,
, but I cannot prevent that. I do what I can for him, what he will allow. But he a proud house-elf, and a keeper of old traditions.”
Harry felt like puking, or falling asleep for eternity. Perhaps both. It was pure will-power that kept him upright on his feet and kept his breakfast in his belly. He had one hand on the wall as he stumbled towards the hospital wing, steadying himself against the castle walls. He noted that each stone thrummed with ancient magic, but it all tried to run away from his touch – leaving him with an acute sense of abandonment and isolation he had never felt during his previous stays within Hogwarts. He stopped to close his eyes and sigh.
emblazoned in silver. Inside, he found a windowless room with a black four-poster bed with black bedding and curtains. A black dresser and desk, a black carpet, and the walls were a dull, dark grey. The room was deathly cold, and there was no fireplace.
If Severus had to make an educated guess, Harry had already tried. At least once, if not multiple times. And the only reason the man was still here, still living, was because his own magic would not let him die.
“What do you mean you have no want?” Lupin asked, frowning.
“Aren’t you supposed to be in Herbology with the other eighth years?”
He had those eyes, once. During sixth year, all the way until the Battle of Hogwarts. Those are the eyes of someone who was lost. Of someone who knows there is no escape, and there is no hope.
“Now, what you need to know about this curse is that one, you have to
the kitchen to cook. But the elderly house-elf had to take it upon himself to find the ingredients and put together every meal for his master while trying to navigate around hundreds of other house-elves.
Lord Voldemort and ended the war, hadn’t had a wand for over a year.
“I hope so. I will be speaking to the Headmistress about it. If not, it will become a new Slytherin House… function.” Severus smiled ruefully. The Slytherins would benefit from meetings like this – no matter what the Headmistress decided. Draco smiled back.
Kreacher had watched, alone, when his master finally received the full brunt of his wizarding inheritance at nineteen. Some received it at seventeen, like they did in the old days. But now, it was more popular to let a witch or wizard become an adult with free reign over their magic for two years before burdening them with
“I wonder how much of cow Hermione will have when she realizes that I not only willing have a house-elf, but that house-elf is Kreacher, and that Kreacher adores me almost as much as he adored Regulus.” He mused out loud. He almost grinned, but even in private he stopped any kind of emotion from spreading, from showing.
Therefore, I decree you to be Houseless.”
“No.” Kreacher said. “I am unable to apparate Master Harry
Wandless, wordless magic.
“It is very concerning, this form of yours.” Minerva said as Harry was about to turn away. “And clearly, you do not need instruction on how to control it.” She paused and glared at him. “You may sit for the NEWTs, but you do not need to come to this class anymore. There is nothing for me to teach
It turns out that Miss Weasley, the poor girl, had been infatuated with the boy but he was always so distant and cruel to her. She though she could save him, and did what any woman would do in her positions – she seduced him. But apparently things did not go as planned, as she fell pregnant with his child shortly after the war ended. When she told him, understandably scared but hopeful that the orphaned boy would be excited to have his own family, he turned away from her. He abandoned her, pregnant and scared.
He walked into the Great Hall and took his seat at the small table in the corner by Slytherin that had been conjured for him. Unlike the other house tables – his remained empty – void of food and drink. He had figured out that the house-elves in the castle sided with the ideology that Harry was a dark wizard, and did not deserve their efforts. They would not send food to him. They refused to even let Kreacher grab food from the kitchens for him. No, the only thing they would allow was for Kreacher to
“Temperature difference. You run too cold and it affects the area around you. You’ll kill the plants.” Neville explained, not quite meeting Harry’s eyes.
“Very well, we can add it on. I doubt you will have any issues with the class or with him – he is one of the more level-headed Weasleys.” Snape made a few annotations to the parchment before addressing Harry.
Draco stared at teak, narrowed his eyes, and raised his hand.
Snape wanted to hit the boy upside the head, but he knew that no matter what he said, Harry would not listen. Just as Draco did not listen in his sixth-year. He had thought he was done with young people having the eyes of dead men, but apparently not.
“Formal wizarding apologies are binding magic at the basest of levels. Parseltongue provides the strongest binding – it will never break.” Harry informed her, and again Teak looked pale. Draco sniggered to himself.
I may also go back an perform updates on what is already posted. I have no beta, and I am the only one who reads this before it gets posted. I've noticed some errors and things that bother me, and I want to fix them. I will add notes to the bottom of the chapters to let you all know when they get edited.
“Eat your breakfast and take those potions.” He commanded. “I will see you in class, Potter-Black.” Then he whisked away, robes billowing behind him.
“Are you able to take Harry to the dorms?” Draco asked, knowing the elf could apparate within the walls of the castle, unlike themselves.
“It doesn’t matter.” Harry said, offering no further explanation. Draco wasn’t having it.
Harry turned back to his meal, forcing himself to eat a good portion – lest he wanted Kreacher to come and berate him as well. It was difficult, since his lip was starting to swell where it had been split open. Kreacher did return to clear the table, and he eyed Harry with a somber look.
That was all he had ever wanted, to just be Harry. He had been Freak for a long time. Then, The-Boy-Who-Lived. Then Slytherin’s heir. The Sirius Black’s godson. The Tri-Wizard Champion. Then he was The-Boy-Who-Lied. Then he was Undesirable Number One. Then, he was The Golden Boy. Now, he was The Next Dark Lord.
“You may.” She replied dryly.
“Severus?” Draco asked, concerned at his godfather’s sudden paleness and silent, far-away look. Severus snapped back into himself.
“Yes, Severus?”
The class (minus Harry), warmly welcomed the witch, some even asking about her work at the Ministry as she passed by. Harry remained silent, but was clearly paying attention. “It is a pleasure to meet all of you.” She said, her eyes exuding nothing but warmth – until they passed over Harry. Those hazel eyes hardened, but she said nothing and her gaze moved on. “I will be going over the law regarding Animagi, the reason for registration, and the process on becoming a registered Animagus. Now, on the slight chance any of you are already Animagi – you will not be punished for registering late. The Ministry acknowledges why many would have secretly become Animagi during the war.” Harry shifted slightly in his seat, the only movement the boy had made since sitting down at his desk, but otherwise kept his attention on Mrs. Teak.
“Of course, I sacrificed things. I sacrificed my seventh year at Hogwarts. I lived in a tent for nearly a year, scrounging the country for dangerous, dark artifacts. I risked my life. But when I compare my sacrifices to other people’s, they pale in the comparison. Such as you, sir – who literally spent your life being a double spy. You sacrificed your youth and prime for the war – think of all the missed opportunities. You lost the only person you loved. Mister Malfoy here had to
“We help him the best we can. Offer our assistance, but we can’t push him. He’ll just run away if we do.” Draco nodded. “One more thing before you go, Draco.”
Harry was
Had Albus known?
“First of all, no sharing work. You may share a table, but you will
“No, you are not fine!” Draco said, gently brushing Harry’s hair out of his face. “I know what
“Perhaps, but then I would miss potions class.”
“What happened to Master Harry?” croaked the elderly house-elf, almost causing Blaise and Draco to drop Harry.
We don’t know.
“Lord Potter-Black.”
He thought to himself, but was forced to dismiss it in favor of correcting her.
Transfiguration class takes place, and the owls deliver the Prophet.
Harry opened his eyes to find that the werewolf was not alone. Bill Weasley was with him.
“Snape.” Pansy said. “Go get Professor Snape. Explain to him what state Harry is in and that he was hit, and healed, several time with Sectumsempra. He will know what is needed.” The elf nodded and disappeared with another crack. She turned to where the boys were struggling to keep Harry upright. “How about we lay him on the ground?” She suggested, conjuring a pillow for his head. Draco and Blaise gently laid him down.
The class ended, and Harry bottled up what he
“I think it has less to do with being dark, and more with the fact that the Patronus Charm requires happy thoughts and memories, and in order to feel those kinds of thoughts and memories, you need to be able to feel happiness.” Harry retorted as he met Lupin’s brown eyes with his own green voids, but the professor did not yield.
, causing all of them to shudder.
Sectumsempra feels like. You’ve had more than a dozen. Be quiet and let us help you.”
It was the weekend, and if Harry didn’t have an essay to write and a potion to brew, he would have chosen to stay in bed for as long as possible. But his assignments, and Kreacher, would not permit such a thing. Kreacher, however, did allow his master to wait until a little later in the morning to rise – which allowed most of the eighth-year students to disperse. Many to Hogsmeade, others to various parts of the castle. He did, eventually, get up and meander his way to the showers and then to the Great Hall. Kreacher served him his coffee, not tea, and a light breakfast.
“When?”
He found himself wandering the dungeons, of all places. He never liked exploring down here before, it had been too cold. But now, it didn’t matter how cold something was – it couldn’t be colder than how he already felt. He took a certain solace in the dark, damp corridors. Much like his room in the eighth-year tower, the dungeons were lined with windowless, grey walls.
“it’s okay, Kreacher. It’ll heal on it own, in time.” Harry said before rising unsteadily to his feet. The potions
Nothing happened.

matter, whether you think so or not. You were still part of the war, and a lot of stress was placed on you before, during, and after it. Even now there are lasting effects. You cannot fool me into thinking you are not more damaged than you appear.”
,” he grinded out. “I don’t understand why your refuse a demonstration. I taught you this charm myself back in your third year. Now come up here and show the class your patronus.” Hermione and Ron sneered at Harry, as did most of the other Gryffindors – minus Neville. Neville never sneered at anyone, but even he looked less than pleased by Harry’s mere presence.
“You treat him as a slave!” She accused. “Making him serve you when there are freed elves in the kitchens who get
“You cannot run from everything, Lord Potter-Black.” He called. “And war does not excuse you from everything.” The werewolf waited a moment, but finally turned and left when Harry kept his slow and steady pace – giving no indication that he had heard the man’s words.
“-fucking-“
“Well, since you’re clearly busy in your own brain, I’m going to leave.” Draco said, pouting again.
“At least you are still capable of
“What the fuck are you doing here?” Ron spat, taking a step forward. Harry looked over his ex-best mate, taking in how the red-head had finally grown into his height. He was no longer lanky and awkward, but had filled out and looked like a man – no longer a boy. Harry also noted that Ron hadn’t acquired any new scars since the war. That was good. Meant he was staying out of trouble. He again felt that irritating pain in his chest, but he clamped down on it and threw it away.
deserves, not what I previous thought he did.”
“How-“ Draco started to ask but was cut off with his own choking sob.
Harry shrugged, but kept to his work. Draco did as he had promised, he simply watched Harry work. Watched as the man returned to the textbook for each step, laboring over each step for minutes as if he was reading paragraphs instead of one sentence. He saw as Harry traces the words slowly with his finger, guiding himself through the sentence under his breath.
Draco finally realized.
of the potions he has taken since arriving at Hogwarts. Bring me the empty bottles and anything else noteworthy. I trust your judgement.” She nodded and with another pop, her and Kreacher disappeared.
“I wanted to make sure there were no stragglers on the platform. Especially the littler ones.  They aren’t fast enough or strong enough to catch up to the train if it starts moving before they are on it. I am, and I wanted to make sure everyone made it. That’s all.” It was a half-truth, really. But if he really thought about it, Harry Potter could be considered one of the “littler ones” with how small he had been throughout their school years. Hermione glared again, unable to find an adequate retort to his reasoning without coming off as a complete bitch.
“As the muggles say, it takes one to know one. But it is because of his behavior. His secretiveness. The fact that he never indicated to anyone, not even Granger and Weasley, that he struggles with his reading. He is hiding his abuse, much like I did. He doesn’t want anyone to know, is terrified for them to know even though he is now grown and doesn’t have to see his abusers again.” Severus paused. “I knew his aunt, Petunia, when we were children. She was bitter and jealous of Lily, and she was cruel to the two of us. I thought as an adult she would be better, seeing as she was a mother of her own child. I was wrong.”
“That it had less to do about being dark, and more about being able to feel happiness.” Draco paused, taking a deep breath. “He might as well have said he can’t cast a patronus because he can’t feel happiness, therefor he doesn’t have any happy thoughts or memories to power the charm.”
Professor Sprout’s reasoning to oust you from her classes?”
Harry thought.
. Harry was searching, constantly, for a way to end it. For a way to wipe himself off the face of the earth and take all that dangerous, magical power with him.
. Care to explain why you were so late to the first meeting of the year?” Again, Hermione glared at him, raising an eyebrow in challenge. Draco simply waived his hand.
The witch balked at the hissing sounds, and Draco wanted to laugh. Of course, no one in the classroom could understand Harry, so the snake-words only increased the tension. Teak looked a little pale, as if she was worried that Harry had declined her apology – and what that would mean. Harry broke the tension shortly after, though.
“Draco, language.” Snape chided before turning back to the oddly silent Harry Potter-Black. “But I agree with Draco on this one. It
“He didn’t finish his potion, Draco. I did what I would do to any other student.” Snape replied, gathering his papers and floating the students’ various potions to a shelf to be tested and graded more thoroughly later. Draco sighed, but didn’t have a retort for his godfather. “Anyways,” Snape said as he turned back around to face Draco. “You spent quite a bit of time observing him. Notice anything
“He looks fine to me.” Madam Pomfrey said, rushing by. “I have no need for brawling riff-raff in my hospital, anyways.” Severus scowled at her retreating frame. It was unlike Poppy to refuse patients like that. But he supposed there was nothing he could do about it. He turned back to Harry, who was now standing – and swaying – on his feet.
“Well done, Draco. Fifteen points to Slytherin for brewing the correct potion. Another fifteen for being the first one done.” Draco grinned.
known Sirius Black. Not even Minerva McGonagall. Draco looked to Harry, but the man had his eyes closed, and was taking deep, calming breaths.
That being said, should you find yourself in a position where you need help or advice, do not be so stubborn as to not seek it help. Take advantage of those who can aide you. My office is always open, and your Prefects and Head Boy are here for you as well. Do not hesitate to come to us if you need to. You are not alone, remember that.” Snape ended his speech, evaluating his charges with a warm yet analyzing stare.

“Mister- I mean
“Yes. I expected you to figure it out right away, but all Harry did was read the list once and he knew it. That confirmed it for me. That he knew the potion well enough to identify it by its ingredients.” Draco felt like he was free-falling. Harry was so hurt. So broken.
“I would agree, Master Harry.” Kreacher said as he swept up the ashen remains of his master’s wand.
Draco and Harry were the last students that Snape had to meet with. Snape had assigned his meeting pairs – not wanting to deal with any potential tomfoolery between the students choosing their own partners and any antics it would result in during the actual meetings. Plus, there was the issue that was called Lord Harry Potter-Black. Not just anyone could be paired with him. Luckily, there was Draco. Who was oddly eager to be sitting with Potter-Black for their meeting… well maybe not so odd, now that Severus thought about it. Draco had always been obsessed with the black-haired boy, and his godson had confessed to him that he was gay this past summer. Severus would not dwell on Draco’s true motivations; his godson would come and explain himself eventually – he always did.
in pain, was his unfocused eyes and labored breathing… and the blood pooling around his knees.
“It is a hard habit to break – concealing everything. I had to – in order to survive as a spy. Now that it is safe to be… myself… I still struggle with allowing it.”
Harry missed the way Snape was watching him as the feast progressed, missed how the potions master’s eyebrows furrowed in a mixture of concern and annoyance. The boy had survived a war he should have died in, then he ran away from the world. Only to return, looking like a younger, more powerful Sirius Black with Lily’s eyes. With more scars, both inside and out. Snape had seen his eyes, seen that brilliant shade of green that reminded everyone of Lily. But they now lacked the spark, the
“No, not a question, Ma’am.” He said, the epitome of polite socialite schoolboy. “But I am a little disconcerted that you are using my cousin, Sirius Black, as an example for this… as if he was nothing but a criminal. Considering he was found to have been wrongly imprisoned due to lack of a proper trial and due process by the Ministry.” He dropped his grin, as his voice turned into a slick venom, ensnaring his victim slowly. Teak had tried to interrupt him, but he did not allow her to. “I would also consider it
It was just his luck that Draco Malfoy entered as he was brushing his teeth. Harry gave him a side glance, then turned back to the mirror. He might not be able to see Malfoy, but he could feel his magic
“I suppose you must learn wandless magic in its entirety, Master Harry.” Harry continued to laugh as he walked towards the Black Family Library. It sent chills down the elderly house-elf’s spine. It was not the laugh of a man who thought it would be difficult to do. That it would be a well-fought challenge.
“Lets just get on with it.” And they did. The Gryffindors took turns cursing him, while the Slytherins healed him. The Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs who had initially stayed had slipped out of the classroom – unable to continue in such a blood-soaked and vicious environment. Harry never once fell completely to the floor – only to his knees. But his eyes were glassed over, as if he wasn’t really there anymore.
“I do not have a wand.” Harry said simply, as if it was no surprise or shock that he was a full-grown wizard walking around without a wand.

Kreacher knew that if only one person knew of his master’s nightmares, his struggles, then maybe he could be saved from the downward spiral he had been on since the end of the war. But Harry would not let anyone in. After things ended with Ginerva Weasley, the Boy-Who-Lived shuttered himself away into Grimmauld Place, changing the wards so that no one could get in. No Floo. No owls. Nothing. No one.
She miscarried due to the emotional trauma. Then, he fled. Hiding away from those who had supported him all those years, loved him and helped him win the war. He fled, leaving their broken hearts laying like shattered porcelain, never turning back. Not once did he apologize, or try to beg for forgiveness.
it. Like any curse that intends violent, bodily harm – you cannot cast it half-heartedly. You have to be motivated; you have to be hateful. You have to
“Now,” Professor Snape began, “the first thing I will tell all of you – especially our new first years – is congratulations on being members of the proud house of Slytherin. All of you are here because you should be – minus you, Potter-Black. You’re here because for whatever deranged reason you chose
“Absolutely not!” McGonagall shrieked, her face the epitome of disgust and disbelief. “Not you, no. Anyone but you, right now.” Harry shook his head sadly.
, still hid away his sexuality out of fear of what his parents would say and do. Though Snape was confident Narcissa – and even Lucius – would accept this aspect of their son, Draco had a lifetime of prejudice and typical pureblood bigotry burned into him. Even if being gay wouldn’t necessarily stop him from siring an heir, the poor boy was terrified that he would lose his family over it. So, he hid it, and had made Severus swear to keep it secret. Severus would never betray Draco’s trust like that. He loved Draco like a son, and all he wanted now was to see him safe and happy. He just hoped Draco would be able to face his parents and tell them the truth someday.
“Very well, then. Let us move on to the purpose of this meeting, shall we?” Professor Snape changed the subject, pulling out the files he needed on their previous classes and grades. “Now, Draco. Are you intending to keep the Newt-level core classes – Herbology, Charms, Transfiguration, Potions, and Defense Against the Dark Arts – as well as your electives of Arithmancy and Alchemy on top of your Head Boy Duties?”
“I had hoped for an explanation.” Lupin said, resigned. “But it is clear that you will not give us one. I merely wish to understand why you’ve changed so much. The boy that I knew wouldn’t have done all those things. He would not have abandoned Ginny like that. I wanted to know what happened to you.” Harry gave Lupin a long, hard look – ignoring Bill completely.
“Do you know what potion it is?” Draco asked Harry, taking the time to look the raven-haired man over for injuries. He noted his pale skin, shakiness, as well as his blooming black eye and split lip.
I also have a discord if you prefer that. Can’t promise I will reply to every message, but I will try! Discord username: Hobo_ing#8261
“It is.”
They started with the youngest first years in the morning, working their way up to the eighth-years in the evening. Snape was, as usual, methodical and precise with his students. But he also made sure they all knew he was there to guide and protect them, and that they could always turn to him for advice or assistance.
“Lupin kicked Harry out of Defense Against the Dark Arts.” Draco said as he unceremoniously sank into the couch in Severus’ private quarters. His godfather had made sure Draco knew he was welcome anytime he needed to speak with Severus, or even if he just needed a quiet place to escape to.
The first day of class, was actually not filled with classes. Instead, the heads of each house were holding meetings with their students to ascertain their interests and goals, and to set up their time tables. The first years were split by their age groups, and the two groups would then meet with their head of house in their group. This was because the first years all took the same classes, but meeting with their head of house would help them understand the expectations they would be held to while in the school.
“Then that concludes our meeting, gentlemen. Unless you have any questions?” Draco shook his head, and Harry just stood up to leave. “Have a good night.” He watched as Harry left, silent and stoic. He noticed that Draco was also watching Harry, but with a very concerned look on his face. “Let him go, Draco.” Severus said, quietly.
“Well said, for a dark wizard, Lord Potter-Black.” Harry ignored the taunt.
“Sectumsempra.” Blaise said, since Draco was struggling with words. “Professor Weasley use Lord Potter-Black as a mannequin.” The house elf’s face turned dark and enraged.
“Shhh.” Draco shushed him, carding his hand through raven locks. “I know. Like I told Professor Weasley, we were children. And Severus explained later, where the curse came from, and why you didn’t know what it would do. It’s okay. I’ve long forgiven you.”
the boy could cast the charm successfully – hell his patronus had been one of the most impressive he had ever seen. Harry lowered his hand with yet another sigh.
Snape walked the his eighth-year charges to their own tower, going over the special set of rules for them. No more curfew, but no spending the night in the other dorms. No underage guests in the tower, and no sleep-overs from those under eighth-year. They did not have to wear their school robes, but casual muggle clothes were not to be worn in class and no distracting or unseemly clothing was allowed either. They would each have their own bedrooms, but bathrooms were to be shared, but housed showers as well as a large bathing area – similar to the Prefects’ bath just not as big. The common room was also to be a shared space, but they had a small kitchen area to store snacks and make coffee or tea. It was a tower, so the rooms were assigned accordingly. Slytherins toward the bottom where it would be more dungeon like, Gryffindors and Ravenclaws towards the top. Hufflepuffs in the middle. The entry way was the portrait of Albus Dumbledore, password was “Lemon Drops”.
“Did any one tell you what Harry said about that?”
“Alright, Harry if– “ Lupin started before he was interrupted
Just what is Harry Potter-Black planning? And how do we know we are safe from him? A wizard so dark he
“Watching. For entertainment. Like I said.” The blonde replied.
to be your baby-sitter over the other professors.” Snape threw a sneer at the boy, who in turn provided no reaction to the way Snape talked to him. Internally Snape quirked an eyebrow. It appears the boy was no longer quick to anger - not like he use to be.
“May I ask why?”
“You are disgusting representation of Wizarding-kind!” She informed him. He turned his gaze slowly upward, his empty emeralds meeting passionate brown eyes.
“Sectumsempra!” The red head yelled, slashing his wand from shoulder to hip. The class watched – half in awe, half in horror – as Harry’s robes split from his right shoulder to left hip, followed by copious amount of blood pouring from the deep gash. Ron grinned triumphantly as Harry fell to his knees. The raven-haired man didn’t cry out, no tears fell from his eyes, he didn’t even try to grasp at the wound with his hands. The only sign he
He sighed and closed his eyes, burying and snuffing out the sadness like he had done many times before.
Draco though, and knew he wasn’t wrong when he saw the greedy glint in the Headmistress’ eyes – especially when looking at Hermione. Unlike Lupin, Minerva did not glare at Harry. She simply passed over him as if he did not exist. Draco wished the world would stop doing that, yoyo-ing between insane idolization, complete loathing, and indifference when it came to Harry.
“I suggest you not talk about things you know nothing of.” He warned. “I also suggest you turn around and go back to your table, and to your Mister Weasley. He looks quite angry, from what I can see from here.”
“Whether it is because they had too much magic, or too little.”
“What do you mean you have changed?” The professor prodded. “Beside coming out of the war alive and killing the Dark Lord?” He watched as Harry smiled bitterly, those emerald eyes dimming with pain and grief and
important thing, as was the acceptance or denial of it. Harry closed his eyes briefly, before opening them again and speaking parseltongue.
He sighed. Albus was dead, there was no point in contemplating what-ifs. What he needed to do was figure out what was going on with Harry, and what had happened to him since the war ended. Everyone knew he broke up with Ginny Weasley only a few months after the Battle of Hogwarts, and then he attended the trials of the death eaters – notably defending Lucius, Narcissa, and Draco and preventing their convictions and imprisonments in Azkaban. Then he had simply disappeared. Those who had been in the Order of the Phoenix, himself included, knew Harry had taken up residence the 12 Grimmauld Place, but the stubborn idiot had changed the wards. No one could get into the house, not even any owls could get through, and the Floo had been shut off.
“Mr. Malfoy,” Bill turned to look at the blond Slytherin. “I understand your hesitation, as I have been told you have previously been on the receiving end of this curse – inside this very castle.” Draco swallowed dryly, but nodded. The Slytherins all gasped, as did some of the Gryffindors. “I have been given permission by the Ministry, the School Governing Board, and Headmistress McGonagall to teach this curse – how to cast it, how to block it, how to counter it, how to heal the wounds it inflects. Professor Snape, begrudgingly, provided me the details on all of this, since he is the creator of the spell. But even he recognized the importance of more people being
Kreacher knew that Harry had a rough night – now that the Dreamless Sleep potions were no longer working. It seems that over a year of abuse of the potion had finally caught up with his master. Regardless, Kreacher dutifully checked in on Harry through out the night, making sure that the wards on his room were perfect.
“I’m afraid this isn’t up for debate. Now, please come to the front of the class, draw your wand, and cast your patronus.” Harry closed his eyes, as if containing something particularly painful. But he stood up and walked up to the front of the class, staring straight at Professor Lupin the whole time. Once there, he turned to face the class, but did not draw his wand.
“Ahh.” Harry had said, understanding. “I suppose in my case, it is too much magic.”
“You cannot risk to align yourself with him, right now.” Blaise murmured under his breath. “There is to much at stake, for both you and the rest of Slytherin.” Draco slumped into his seat, silently acquiescing. Blaise let him go, but patted him on the arm. “Be patient, Draco.” Draco snorted. Patience was certainly a virtue, just not one of his.
. No more lives lost because of him. No more unhappiness left in his wake. He would be neither hero nor villain in death. Maybe, just maybe, for once… He would just be Harry.
. He stepped forward with his right hand held out. “May I, Mister Malfoy?” He asked, looking at the pin. “There is something I wish to try that you all might find advantageous to yourselves.” Draco turned to Snape - eyebrow raised in questioning. Snape nodded his permission. The room was silent as Draco handed Harry the pin.
Draco wondered what it was that Harry was burying deeper inside himself with every sigh and every time he closed his eyes. He watched as Harry left the class, only stopping to pick up his bags.
“I am your head of house, not your mother or your nanny.” He continued on. “But you are not alone here. Self-preservation is important, yes. But so is the preservation of your family, of your friends. In Slytherin, we watch each other’s backs, despite what everyone else thinks. We just use cunning and manipulation instead of grand gestures and speeches. Our house needs to show the world what we are made of, we need to rebuild our reputation after the war. We cannot do that if we act like buffoons or throw hexes at those who annoy us. No. We must act with the dignity and pride that Salazar Slytherin himself would expect of us.
, Professor Weasley! What is your excuse for this?” He waved toward Harry, who was still very much awake as he remained kneeling on the floor. Bill opened his mouth to reply, but didn’t get the chance.
“How-“
Potter-Black,” McGonagall said as she approached him. She looked unhappy, though Harry felt it wasn’t because he was hurt. Harry turned his attention to the headmistress, trying to ignore all the pain that was now blossoming in his head, shoulders, and stomach. She cleared her throat. “I am legally required to ask if you wish to press charges against Ronald Weasley for assaulting you.” She said, staring down at him with those ever-disappointed eyes.
Not an actual chapter, just an update!
They had to figure out what had happened with Harry.
So far, the loyal elf had not failed Harry. Not since the end of the war, really. Kreacher single-handedly kept Lord Harry James Potter-Black alive, and regardless of how Harry felt about his own life, he was still thankful to Kreacher. It was a testament to elf’s dedication to his master when the elf popped into the Great Hall, carrying a coffee pot, mug, and breakfast – alongside several potions. Harry was thanking Kreacher for his service and thoughtfulness – he had brought Harry a warming draught, anti-nausea draught, and a calming draught – when he heard a loud, shrill shriek from across the hall.
“-dare-“
Harry took a hot shower, probably too hot by most people's standard, but he wasn't most people. A boiling hot shower was one of the only ways he could feel even a whisper of warmth now. He dried himself in the shower stall and snatched his robe from where it hung just outside the door, donning it and tying it around himself before exiting. Whether or not someone had entered the bath or not didn't matter to him. He was taking no chances.
In Hufflepuff, Kindness is second only to Loyalty, which walks side-by-side with Dedication.
“What happened this time?” Snape asked, turning to walk toward his office. Harry followed him without prompting.
“Do you need to go to the infirmary, Potter-Black?” Severus asked, noting how Harry was now struggling to pull himself to his feet. He also recognized the three potions the house-elf had brought the boy. They still stood untouched, as did most of Harry’s breakfast.
“Not even the nargles and wrackspurts want to mess with you, anymore.” She said in her ever-dreamy voice.
“No helping, Draco.” Severus chided from the front of the class, everyone turned to watch the blonde.
. For entertainment purposes.” Severus rolled his eyes but grunted his permission anyways. Everyone slowly turned back to their own potions, not willing to risk Snape’s wrath to watch Draco Malfoy watch Harry Potter-Black.
Sorry it took so long to get chapter two up! I’m working on fixing my schedule to get regular updates for this fic, and my other fic (Prince Omega). I also have a Twitter for my AO3 account, my handle is @Hobo_ing. I will post there when I have updates, or if I have anything else to tell you guys.
“I told you in the beginning that you would have done well in Slytherin, but you insisted on Gryffindor. Hmm, I wonder how you feel about that now? It may have won you the war, boy, but what did it cost you?” The hat grew silent and the hall stared, enraptured, waiting, clinging onto every word. Harry didn’t say a word, he simply closed his eyes.
“You are keeping that house-elf! Making him serve you! After everything with Dobby, you are treating Kreacher as a servant!” Harry set his coffee down at the table and pressed his hands together, eerily reminiscent of Severus Snape before he gave a good scolding.
“Are you intending to lay there all day?”
Kreacher knew this, and it pained him because they all cursed and tormented his master – unknowing what his master was hiding. What his master was doing to try and keep them all safe.
Even Greg managed to grin and grunt his agreement.
to lose at the time?
The owls flew in that evening, dropping the latest issue of the Prophet. Draco watched as, surprisingly, and owl dropped one of to Harry where he sat isolated at his own table in the corner of the Great Hall. Draco turned to his own paper as the noise level rose, figuring it was probably because of whatever was in the paper.
. It was something they all knew, something their parents had told them.
“The war is over, Draco. No one is going to kill him now.” He tried to reassure the blonde, but he knew Draco wasn’t talking about other people trying to kill Potter-Black. He was talking about those hopeless pits of nothingness that were Harry’s eyes.
“Why didn’t you replace it, then?” Lupin asked, outraged at the boy’s ignorance and defiance. Harry turned to him, his eyes growing slightly dark himself.
was unspoken, but implied. Still, he did not react.
Severus found himself sighing again.
Potter-Black. Now, please enlighten who you have chosen to be your teacher-supervisor.”
“Harry. Its Harry.”
“What do you mean concerning?” Snape asked and crossed his arms.
Harry surveyed the room, watching as all the Slytherins started to relax. He could sense the way the room shifted from cold and apprehensive, to warm and welcoming. He felt the way the sense of
The great hall erupted immediately afterwards.
But he is even more of a demon than we all realized. I managed to speak with Ginny Weasley, the ex-girl friend of our subject, in order to get to the bottom of their break up.
old textbook, not because of the boy’s own talent.
A concerned reader recently reached out to me, saying that their child had reported to them that Harry Potter – now known as Lord Harry James Potter-Black – had returned to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for his final and eighth year of schooling. Of course, I had to investigate this.
“That was Mr. Longbottom’s reason, not Professor Sprout’s.” Snape finished for him as he opened his office door. “Take a seat, Potter-Black. Would you like some tea?” Harry snorted but sat in a chair near the hearth.
“I’m sorry, Harry.” He said, his voice still soft, but now firm and confident. Harry didn’t even bother to correct him on his title. He just obediently stopped and looked at the other man.
“No, no one
“The world taught me to leave no holes in my defenses, especially with the Ministry. Excuse me if I must do things you would not think of or condone in order to protect what I have left of myself.” Minerva pretended not to hear him, as did most of the class. Draco on the other hand, and the rest of the Slytherins, shivered with recognition of those words.
,” he practically growled, “have not come into their lordships and ladyships because their
“Master did not eat his dinner in the hall, so I brought it up for him.” The elderly house-elf said. “I also brought the dreamless sleep potion for tonight. Do you require anything else, Master Harry?” Harry shook his head.
He looked around, noticing that most of the other students were murmuring in agreement with the Headmistress’ assessment. Except for his own Slytherin’s, who wore subdued faces – masks hiding their own anger at the blatant mistreatment of a wizard based on assumptions of his character, rather than his own merit. Blaise met his look, and they shared an understanding.
?” She sneered. He looked at her, sadness attempting to strangle him as he realized that this was Hermione Granger. Brightest Witch of their Age. Hunter of Horcruxes. Part of the Golden Trio. Girlfriend to Ronald Weasley. His ex-best friend. He had confided in her, loved her like a sister. And here she was, berating him, accusing him, demeaning him. Where once he had found understanding, patience, and unconditional love, now stood loathing and disgust.
, it only got worse. Instead of one potion, Harry would take two or three in attempt to knock himself out until morning. To avoid the nightmares that triggered his magical explosions. But they weren’t effective all the time.
how that spell worked.
“And why is that, if I may ask?” He replied evenly. She scoffed.
The world was shattering around him, like a thousand million broken crystals. In each refraction of the light, he saw the faces of those who he had loved, those he had lost, all of which who hated him now. Even his deceased mother and father probably looked down at him in disgust now. Sirius too. Even the dead would scorn him, because he
. His magic prevents it. But I can go get someone and bring them here.”
Of course, all the Ravenclaws stuck with Flitwick, the Hufflepuffs with Sprout, and the Gryffindors split in half between McGonagall and Lupin (Hermione chose McGonagall and Ron chose Lupin), except for Neville who chose Sprout. Then came Harry.
a criminal, or to speak ill of the deceased. Especially since Black gave up his ancestral home to the Order of the Phoenix to use as headquarters, and helped to fight in
I am damaged, it does not matter. Not anymore. I don’t have to explain myself to either of you. I am here for an education, not therapy.” He opened his eyes at last, his emerald voids bearing down on Snape with an oppressive weight.
“And that is?” Draco asked, a little snottily. Severus huffed in annoyance.
Harry Potter did not board the Hogwarts Express.
“Expecto Patronum!” He yelled, not moving his hand from its position where he had held the light.
“My name, Miss Granger, is Lord Harry James Potter-Black. But Lord Harry Potter-Black or Lord Potter-Black will do as well.” He said, his voice smooth, calm, and void of emotion. He continued to pay more attention to his coffee than to the Head-Girl standing in front of him.
“You always were invested in your house – despite outward appearances.” Draco teased. “But I am happy to see you being more open with your intentions and feelings.”
You are all. Yet you are none, Harry James Potter-Black.
Petunia had always been cruel, to him. To Lily. He had heard from Albus how her and her husband weren’t the best of muggles, and their son was utterly disgusting. Even Hagrid had agreed with that. But they were keeping Harry
His magic was out of control, flashing around the room in a mixture of green, silver, and black lightning. It cracked against the walls and singed the door. And Harry was still screaming, feeling his magic ripping out of him, trying to tear him apart and put him back together.
His master had told him all of this the night he broke his wand. It was shortly after the incident with the Weasley girl, and Harry was trying to cast a simple Lumos spell. Harry was still only seventeen, hadn’t even come into his magical inheritance, but he already had too much magic.
Did Albus lie about anything else?
“Thank you for passing on the message, Mister Longbottom. I’ll take my leave.” With that, Harry turned to leave – not as efficiently as usual due to the beating he took on Friday – but he still managed to get his robes to billow behind himself. Neville watched, tense and uncertain as the man he once knew as
“Did anyone know he was coming?”
. Harry should have had another witch or wizard with him when his came. Someone who could have supported him, helped him understand, helped him come to grips with the pure amount of magical power he was saddled with. Because Harry didn’t just come into the Potter’s magical inheritance.
Harry reminded himself, taking a deep breath and shelving his anger away with the rest of his emotions.
“Maybe I could convince him to let me help him?” Draco pondered out loud. Severus half listened to his god-son while making his own mental speculation about Harry.
“Minerva,” it was Mrs. Teak speaking now. “We must let him show us, after all we would prefer to have him registered than not.” The older witch nodded, but scowled at Harry.
“What about you, Potter-Black? Still insisting on Newt-Level Potions?” He sneered. Potter-Black had never been a good brewer – except under Slughorn. But
“I won’t ever get angry again. Never. I promise, I’ll never be like this again. I’m so sorry.”
He turns, gaze rising from asphalt to greenery to far-away hills and up to heaven. The sun, shyly hiding between a pale cloud, though gentle and warm against his skin still.
I almost sleep on the coach, because I need some time to calm my own nerves, but I end up in our room. Like always. Because if you wake up without me, you think I’ve left, and you’ll hurt yourself or get angry. I know you’ve calmed down, I know you’re not angry. I know you’re asleep. But I still hold my breath just a little, don’t pull at the blankets even though you’ve got almost all of them.
Then, he apparates.
No war.
I’ve still never slept on the couch, and neither have you.
You didn’t do anything. I know you didn’t. I know you didn’t mean to do it, I know you would never intentionally trigger bad memories. But when you smile at me so brilliantly, as if I’ve never hit you in my life, and then drop your plate to the floor without even moving a muscle, I can’t help but react.
The angle is different, and it takes him a while to find Malfoy’s prostate again. When he does, he is rewarded with more of those sweet, loud moans. Harry cares about his own pleasure, he doesn’t care about Malfoy’s. He doesn’t. The git is a slut.
I love you.
“Night. Love you, Draco. I’ll… try something different next time. Sorry.”
You leave to visit your mother on her birthday, and thankfully you agree that you should spend a few more days with her. She doesn’t get many visitors.
“As long as you have improved since our fourth year. You really were terrible.”
I won’t hurt you tonight, Draco, you have my word, whatever that’s worth at this point.
He almost falls asleep on Ron’s shoulder, and his best friends take him back to his flat.
Harry pulls him off, and once again, Malfoy immediately moves to the bed, only this time with a hoarse cough.
“Oh, fuck, Malfoy,” Harry moans, snapping his hips faster, tightening his grip around the other man’s hips. He shifts, lets Malfoy knees slide down until he lies flat on the mattress. Harry lowers himself over him, holds his wrists down, and keeps going, grinding his hips down.
“Where does it hurt?”
You just take it. Every single time. You simply stand there, right there in front of me, with your head slightly bowed and your hand covering your mouth. I think it is to stop the crying until I see your red arm.
I hope that you’ll let me hug you, but you squirm away and flinch backwards as hard as if you’ve been slapped.
Potter didn’t have a place in mind, apparently, so he agreed to meet at the bakery nearby.
The sky above Harry is lit with twinkling stars, winking curiously at him. He sighs, tired, and watches the cold air transforming his puff of air into a white cloud, disrupting his vision of the sky.
When you’re silent, I hold my breath until I start crying, and once I’ve started, I can’t stop. I turn around, you’re kneeling in the middle of our living room, ours, we bought it together, arranged the furniture together, decorated it together, and now it’s all in a million pieces. I can’t even see which pieces of wood belonged to the bookshelves or the table anymore.
Malfoy relaxes completely around his finger, and Merlin, it shouldn’t be so hot, but it is. He lines himself up and experimentally pushes a little inside, then stops to just feel. Even after the spell, Malfoy’s arse hugs his prick tightly, and he remembers just why he prefers men in bed. The spelled lube feels like regular lube, except it’s a little runnier, and as he applied a rather generous amount, it has already started running down Malfoy’s thighs. It turns Harry on more than he cares to admit, perhaps because he imagines how it would look if it was his come instead.
But that’s what’s turned you into this scared, insecure thing.
Harry swallows, and to distract himself starts searching for some lube.
You’re not inside me anymore, you’re next to me, behind me, curled around me, with my hand in yours and my hair in your nose. We’re not touching anywhere else, I don’t know if you’re still excited, but it doesn’t matter, because I’m not. You know I’m not.
You hug me, tight, and how is it that you always manage to be everywhere at once?
How much does a night cost? How much does half the prize of a night cost? He has no idea how much money he should leave, so he empties his pockets as well as the old wallet by the mantelpiece and piles it up next to the shirts and bracelet. It adds up to just over a hundred galleons, which he hopes is good enough.
Heavy droplets pouring down over them, steam hugging their bodies loosely, overt lust radiating from them both. His grey eyes searching green, asking for permission, for affection, for love.
And then, suddenly, finally, it is quiet. There is only one sound, a quiet lonely sound. You’re crying. You’re standing in front of me, right there in front of me, and I don’t for the love of Merlin understand why you never try to get away from me.
He forces Malfoy down on his knees again, grabs his hair and shoves his face into his groin. The hands are quick, polished nails shining with the sun’s reflection as he pulls the pants down and grabs Harry.
When you get back, it’s as if everything is okay, as if I’m okay. I open the door, and the way you look at me, as if you actually love and deserve me, how you instantly move close and smile into my shoulder makes me believe that I can treat you right, if only for tonight.
But your notes were just your notes. Or, not just your notes, but some of the best notes you’ve ever made. You’ve been talking about it for the better part of five weeks, now, this thing you’re figuring out.
Your notes twisted, turned into something vague, an evil object, I don’t know what, but I knew I needed to get rid of it, light it on fire.
“It’s okay,” I say. Because it is.
“Look at me,” he grits out, enthralled by Malfoy’s shiny eyes opening to meet his. After one blink, the tears fall hastily down his cheeks in flowing rivers, and Harry finds it grotesquely beautiful.
A sinful sound not belonging to him, a foreign body taking his place. Feminine sounds, the name of his love. Frozen thoughts, followed by tacit understanding, unhidden grief.
I climb back onto the bed after slipping my boxers back on. I can’t ask if you’re alright, hate that I can’t ask, afraid of the words sounding cruel or mocking, so I simply shut my mouth and snuggle up behind you, give you what little comfort I can.
He looked up briefly. The man simply smiled back.
It’s not all gone, and I still catch you flinching if you don’t expect my movement, your breath hitching if I raise my voice. I still get angry. But I know what to do, and when I’ve calmed down, you’re there, with a hand on my shoulder, suggesting a long bath or take away or a movie night.
“Malfoy.”
I hear the steps go down again, there is a voice, I’m dragged out of the closet and the world is suddenly bright, then the only thing I’m aware of is pain.
I mean it reassuringly, as an I understand now sort of thing, but you make a little panicked sound I don’t even think you’re aware of and I’m fucking it again. No, I didn’t mean that in a bad way, in a threatening way, I meant it in a good way. I need you to understand, I love you, Draco, please let me hold you close like I used to and make you happy again.
When you sleep, you look as carefree as you used to.
His heart, bursting with happiness and desire, aching and begging for the man in front of him, around him, in him.
When he arrives at Grimmauld place, he immediately notices the red shirt gone, but is somewhat saddened by the bracelet sitting lonely on the table. More of the money is gone, and Harry could swear that the fridge is less full now than it was.
“Draco, it’s not your fault.”
His voice had dropped significantly since school. Oh, but of course it had.
Harry is completely out of breath when he reaches the door on the third floor, can feel his heart thunder in his ears. He knocks twice, then waits, hoping he’s not too late.
“I can’t say I expected to see you here,” Potter continued, “it was quite the shock when I spotted your hair. No one does have hair quite like yours, you know.”
“Where did he go?” He heard one girl ask, and heard a few others murmuring the same thing.
“Just… Don’t be cruel to him.” Draco whispered from the couch. Severus started and stared at his godson. “Don’t look at me like that. You know what I mean. You’ve never like him, and it showed. But… he doesn’t need that on top of everything else… on top of everyone else and the way they treat him. You know better now. You are also allowed to show compassion now that the war is over.” Draco turned his face away, his pale cheeks tinted pink with embarrassment.
helped, but after Ron’s beating, the world was no longer just tilting. It was spinning. “But I will go see Madam Pomfrey, if that makes you feel better.” The elderly elf nodded.
“I apologize for the lack of coffee, but the tea is my own blend. Quite strong, if I do say so myself.” Severus set the tray down, pouring them both a cup before sitting in the chair across from Harry. “So, what
Once the train stopped at Hogwarts, Draco helped herd first years towards the boats, as there were twice as many this year and even Hagrid would struggle to get all of their attention.
“Why?” Harry said, closing his eyes and leaning into the warmth that was Draco’s hand. It was the warmest thing he had felt in a long, long time. “I don’t deserve forgiveness.” Before Draco could argue with him about that, Kreacher popped back into existence with Severus on his arm.
he was unstable. Kreacher knew it too. But Kreacher couldn’t kill his master. Even his master couldn’t kill himself. And his master had
.” Hermione called, her voice venom. “You are down at the bottom. Enjoy.” Harry didn’t acknowledge her, but he climbed down three flights of stairs, noting a set of bathrooms on the floor below the common room. But at the bottom, there was only one door. A menacing black door with his last name
“Of course. I also heard that Bill Weasley was hired to teach a Curses class? Is that true?”
“Dunno.” Greg said. “Bloke’s been sittin’ there since before we got on, and he’s been asleep the whole time. Doesn’t even have a trunk or nothin’.” Draco sighed. He did prefer knowing who he was sitting with, you know, because it was
Harry cast the Lumos spell, and his phoenix-feathered wand (repaired by the Elder Wand before Harry destroyed it), disintegrated into ash. His master didn’t cry that night. He laughed. A cold, bitter laugh.
And one loud Weasel proclaiming, “At least his being resorted! Thank Merlin that fucker won’t be in our house anymore!” A cheer resounded from the Gryffindor table. Draco frowned. He had heard rumors about Potter… about
“He did. And that made me a very secretive, private, bitter person. Potter-Black has probably been abused as well, now that I am looking at him more closely and with an objective light.” Draco closed his eyes and took in a sharp breath.
He searched the crowd, looking for a small, thin boy with unruly black hair, round spectacles, and green gems for eyes. He looked and he looked, and soon he was the last one on the platform.
“Yes, Mister Malfoy?” Teak asked, surprised at the sudden interruption in her monologue. “Do you have a question?” Draco repressed his sneer, and instead channeled his inner “pureblooded Malfoy” and flashed her a blinding smile.
“Is this all you can do, Potter-Black? I expect a fully completed Dreamless Sleep potion and an essay describing,
“Re-sorted?” The elderly witch asked. “I’ve never heard of such a thing!”
“Get out of my class, Lord Potter-Black. You are not welcome here. You may sit for the exams at the end of the year, but I do not allow dark wizards in my classroom.” Harry didn’t argue, he just closed his eyes once more and let out a sigh.
He couldn’t help his feelings.
protective. Hermione stomped up to his table and slammed her hands down. Harry thought his morning coffee was more interesting.
– and he proclaims his efforts were nothing, his sacrifices were nothing? What the hell? Was Harry so… disconnected… from the world that he genuinely thought that everyone else sacrificed more than him, simply because they had
nervous.
“I will register your Animagus form, Lord Potter-Black. Confirmed as a thestral.” Teak said, and now those who had not been able to see Harry let out gasps of understanding.
The librarian turned him away, refusing to let him borrow books or to study within her sanctuary. Kreacher watched as Harry merely sighed, accepting his fate, and then turn and walk away. He watched as his master bottled away all emotion, shelving them to the dark crevices of his soul to prevent them leaking out.
”We were
“Thank you, Master Harry. Please call me should you need anything.”
Thank you for everyone who has commented or given Kudos! I love you all and you are the reason I am able to write this in the first place! Keep in mind I run a twitter, @hobo_ing. I use it to post when I release new chapters on my works, for those of you who don’t check your emails. 😉
“I’m glad, then. Do you think it will continue beyond this year?”
In Slytherin, Fraternity is second only to Ambition, which walks side-by-side with Cunning.

“No, Mr. Malfoy.” Harry said, stumbling to his feet. “I agreed to this, I intend to see it though. The more people who gain practice learning how to heal this curse, the better.” Draco closed his mouth, unable to argue. Bill grinned viciously.
could kill him now, I reckon.” Draco mumbled. “And with his magic… I wonder if it will let him do it himself. I wonder if he has already tried.” Severus grimaced. He hadn’t wanted to think about Lily’s son trying to kill himself, but now the images wouldn’t stop.
that night. Truly died. And then he had chosen to come back – at least that is what he told Kreacher. Said that he couldn’t leave the task undone, unsure if his fellow warriors of the light would be able to defeat Lord Voldemort without him. But his master said this with regret, and Kreacher knew that Harry James Potter-Black constantly wished he had chosen to
“Professor, I don’t – I don’t think it wise to teach that curse to
Harry merely sighed before opening his eyes. “I assume everyone in Gryffindor hates me enough for this to work. And most of the Slytherins and the remaining Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs.” He said, standing and walking towards Bill. “Very well. I’ll be your dummy.” Bill grinned and positioned Harry front and center of the class.
“No, Kreacher. Thank you. I will call for you if I think of anything.” The elf bowed and then popped out of existence again. Harry picked at his food as he read the article more thoroughly this time.
“I can’t.” Draco said, just as quiet. “Not after seeing his eyes. You know I can’t.” Severus closed his eyes, temporarily wishing that he hadn’t been Draco’s confidant over the last several years. The pieces finally slotted themselves together in his head. Harry was Draco’s Lily.

and you don’t see them throwing snits about it.”
Draco was… interesting. To say the least. He had decided to grow his hair out like Lucius, but then turned around and was extremely adamant that he was not – in any way, shape, or form – his father. Draco was simply Draco. The rest of the world would just have to accept it. Yet Draco, so fierce and so unapologetically
Minerva was the first to recover, waving her want to bring the feast to fruition. She looked at Harry, disdainfully. Even his old head of house no longer liked him, no longer even tolerated his existence. Harry ignored her, walking to the back of the room to lean against a wall until the feast was finished. He knew it wasn’t worth trying to sit with any of the houses in hopes of enjoying the food himself. He closed his eyes, battling his emotions and beating them down until he could feel them no more. He was getting better at that, he almost never felt anything anymore.

“It’s his reading, Severus. You know as well as I do that while he didn’t

still hold them. Mine are dead, as is my godfather, whom I inherited my second lordship from. You are called Headmistress McGonagall because you are the headmistress. The professors are called professors because that is what they are. I demand and deserve the same respect. I am a Lord, and therefor should be addressed as one. Are we clear?”
Harry nodded, and without comment he retrieved his bag and left the classroom. Draco wanted to scream!
"Thank you, for... You know." Malfoy said with a wave of his hand, motioning towards his snake pin that was pinned to his pajamas at the moment. The blonde look anxious, and a little uncomfortable, but Harry didn't care that much. Harry spit out his toothpaste and rinsed his mouth before replying.
“Hullo, Hagrid.” Draco greeted as he approached with a scared, brunet girl.
“Now, Miss Granger. How about you demonstrate for us instead?” Like the stuck-up, brown-nosing, teacher’s pet she was, Granger jumped at the change to show off in front of her peers.
“Everyone here hates me. But its all fresh. You’ve always hated me, therefor it isn’t at the forefront of your mind. You hate me because you always have, not because of something new. So, you will treat me as you always have. Even if you have not always been kind or fair to me, it is better treatment than what I can expect from the others. Does that answer your question, Professor Snape?” Harry did not drop the honorific for Snape, though he had done so often before. The man had his respect now, and would probably always will – whether the potions master wanted it or not.
Potter-Black.” Draco corrected, noting that Harry smirked at that.
“Bad. Very Bad.” She said, and frowned deeper. “I don’t know who you are anymore, and I don’t think I want to.” With that, she stood up and walked to the Gryffindor table, where she went and sat next to Ginny Weasley. Harry closed his eyes.
“Hello, Severus.” Draco returned with a smile. “How have the meetings been?”
“Vulnera Sanentur, Vulnera Sanentur, Vulnera Sanentur.” He sang the incantation, like Severus had done for him back in sixth year. His voice was low and melodic, drawing in his classmates as Harry’s blood flowed back into him and the gash started to knit back together. “Vulnera Sanentur, Vulnera Sanentur, Vulnera Sanentur.”
“How DARE you make that poor elf serve you!” It was Hermione. Of
“Depends, Master Harry.” Kreacher had replied.
of magic or noise past their barriers. Kreacher understood, truly, but he was also concerned. Wizards who isolated themselves like his master did often ended up insane… or worse. Just look at the history of the Black family. One only needed to look at that absolutely crazy bunch of wizards and witches to understand that isolating one self from the world does not result in good things. Even Kreacher, as loyal to Walburga and Regulus as he was, understood this.
binded someone to you via parseltongue. Undo it. Now.” Draco stared at the older witch, a little flabbergasted that the Headmistress seemed unaware of the laws that did, and did not, apply here.
“You should have stopped him from killing me, Harry.”
“Again, not up for debate. Now, if you would cast the spell out loud, for those unfamiliar with it, please.” Lupin’s voice was cold, hard, and filled with barely contained anger. Harry just sighed, as if resigned with his task – even though it was a spell he was well known for.
“Good morning, class!” Lupin said, joyfully enough. It seemed the werewolf was a morning person. Well, he practically had to be as a parent with a young child. The class murmured their greetings less brightly, and less coherent as at least half of them were still half asleep. This didn’t seem to bother Lupin, as he plowed on. “I tend to take a more… practical approach, as many of you might remember from your third year. Now, I know many of you are more advanced than your age suggests – due to the war. But we have to start somewhere, and not all of you were given equal opportunity to learn some of these spells.” He once again looked over at the Slytherins, no doubt meaning that none of them were members of Dumblerdore’s Army in their fifth-year.
Speaking of the devil, Draco arrived first, sitting neatly into one of the black, leather arm chairs facing his desk in his office. “Good evening, Draco.” Snape said, his voice low and calm.
“No.” This time, it was Pansy. “You saw how Pomfrey treated him after Weasel attacked him. She won’t treat him at all.” The three Slytherins paused in the hall, trying to decide what to do when they heard the loud crack of apparition.
Harry made it to the hospital wing, but Madam Pomfrey met him at the doors. “I thought I told you that I will have no riff-raff in my hospital?” She said sternly. “Plus, you are fine. Get to class.” She slammed the doors in his face and he heard the locks click into place.
He reminded himself before opening his eyes once more.
His master had already been abusing the use of Dreamless Sleep potions
“I do.” Harry replied quietly as he went to reach for an ingredient. He hissed in pain as shot of pain ran through his shoulder. Draco rushed over to him.
Draco noted.
Snape lifted and eyebrow, curious. “Why me, Potter-Black?” Harry sneered at him, but allowed him to go without the honorific. The man had at least earned the right to do that with how much he did in the war.
“But, back to the first point. Because you must
Additionally, it seems he can no longer cast a Patronus charm – providing us all the proof we need that he had truly become a dark wizard. I’ve received several letters from students that Potter-Black is exceedingly moody, and constantly exudes a dark aura. It appears many of them fear to be alone with him, scared he might hurt them.
“Why, ‘ello there Malfoy. Who do we have ‘ere?” Hagrid greeting back, without any sarcasm or bitterness. The half giant squatted down so he was eye-level with the first-year.
“He’s not worth it! He isn’t Harry anymore, Ron!” She pleaded with the red-head. But he kept swinging.
A few people turned pale at that, but no one left. Bill grinned. “Good! Well then. To start, we are going to learn Sectumsempra and its counter curse.” Draco looked aghast at that statement, remembering
He saw Ron coming, face flushed red and angry, a snarl on his face. “You fucking bastard!” The red-head yelled before he swung the first punch. Harry didn’t defend himself, didn’t stand up from the table. He just… let it happen. If this is what they needed, they could take it.
Harry.
“Very good, Ron.” Bill praised before turning to the Slytherins. “Draco, the counter incantation to heal – if you would.” Draco felt the world spinning around him, his focused narrowed down to the bleeding man in front of him. He didn’t remember kneeling down next to Harry, nor pulling out his wand.
The hall remained in silent shock as Harry stood, taking off the hat and setting it on the chair. Even Professor Lupin, back to teach DADA, had a look of shock mixed in with blatant loathing. Loathing he held for Harry. Harry could feel the werewolf’s stare, could feel the animosity rolling off of him. But he had felt it before, coming from those closer to his heart than even the only man alive who had been close to his own father.
“It isn’t worth telling you, or anyone, Professor Snape.” The younger man said firmly. “Come June, it won’t matter at all.” He stood up and dusted off his robes. “Thank you for the tea, sir. But it is best I leave.”
“My apologies, Headmistress McGonagall, but that is neither my name nor title. You may call me Lord Harry Potter-Black, or Lord Potter-Black. But I will not respond to either
“What can we do to help him?”
So, I forgot about Herbology last chapter! I have since gone back and edited it! But, just know both boys are taking Herbology on top of the other classes.

“Master Harry…” he started and then stopped when Harry sighed. Kreacher had learned to stop pressing his master when he sighed like that.
tempting. But Ron had always been hot-headed, and even if everyone hated him, he didn’t hate them in return. “I don’t think it would result in anything productive or reasonable.” He watched her shoulders relax a little – a sign that she was relieved with his answer.
“But-“
They made it to the castle in one piece, and watched as the first years got sorted. Looks like Penelope Edgewater was Hufflepuff. Good, the house was warm and friendly and would help her become her own person outside of her nervousness in no time. Headmistress Minerva McGonagall was about to put the Sorting Hat away when he started speaking again.
“Hello, Miss Lovegood.” He greeted from the floor, mouth still full of blood, his body cold and sore. She frowned.
to go see Madam Pomfrey, as I suspect I may have a concussion. I’m not pressing charges, nor am I going to seek revenge against him.” He paused and finally let out the sigh he had been holding in. “So, what do you want from me?” Bill continued to glare at him, while Lupin looked at him with a gaze mixed with anger, sadness, and regret.
“Nice of you to finally join us, Malfoy.” Hermione sneered, causing Weasel to snigger.
“War, Professor. Fucking
“Yessir,” Harry said before falling back into his seat. He quickly chugged the three potions and then picked at his food. He was well-aware of the eyes that were on him, from every direction. But he paid them no mind.
. They were his family. Surely… surely they would have taken him to school and taught him to read?
Harry?
So Kreacher watched, and listened, and anguished. Because the people sensed the change in his master before his master had even come into his inheritance. They sensed his change from the war. Then Ginerva happened. And then it got worse. The wizarding world had a bad habit of pointing fingers and shifting blame and ostracizing anyone potentially scary, or out of the norm.
The Houses are all different, yet the same. All have a degree of loyalty, some kind of signature wit, skill or intelligence in their own right, bravery in the strangest of places. You have all of those, yet none of what they desire.
– staring at him with open hatred and contempt. He chose to not react, keeping his face as blank and empty as his eyes. A quick scan of the room told him that none of the professors had stuck around for this little reunion, leaving him to the wolves. No surprise there. They all hated him now, too.
“He said your father, Tobias, abused you and your mother. Beat you and treated you poorly.” Severus nodded in confirmation.
The tall, broad stranger dressed in black with hair that rivaled Sirius Black’s, was none other that Harry Potter. Correction, Harry Potter-Black. Lord Harry James Potter-Black. His glasses were gone, but his eyes were as green as ever. His lightening bolt scar was now silvery instead of red, but seemed longer and larger than before, and it continued down through his eyebrow, eyelid, and cheek. He had another scar on the opposite side, near his lip. Almost looked like a knife cut. Draco stared, awed and also terrified. Awed before the boy that had truly become a man, and he had changed drastically in the process.
