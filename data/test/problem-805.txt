"Who gives a shit," Draco groaned, "About my hair," and buried his face in Luna's shoulder, so he wouldn't have to see the fear on her cute little face grow.
Going home for break had been a mistake. Draco knew it as soon as he set foot in the Manor, where he had spent less time in truth almost than in Grimmauld over winter break, and found Father right at the door waiting for him. "Father," Draco said, drawing back dismayed, and Father looked darkly amused to see Draco had put the nearest open door between them and shoved his hand into his pocket.
," Granger said crossly, "I know all about it, my uncle is also like that, he's got a partner who comes round, and I've read about it, it doesn't matter. You might have just
"Alert your little friends," Severus advised, "And your Ravenclaw dormmates that there may be reprisal against you, but do not name names. Mr. Nott will not question that precaution after yet another confrontation. Unless Miss Bulstrode is willing to come forward to me officially, or there is anything else more concrete, I can do no more. Draco, just- at the risk of sounding like Moody-
And then the Dementor was a moon, Lupin's voice calling out a calm and clear Riddikulus, and the Boggart had been put away, the lights coming back on as if they had never faltered.
he could see in Potter's eyes, the command clearer still once his free hand knotted in Draco's Slytherin tie and yanked it, pulling him up so his neck was pushed against Potter's jabbing wand.
Poor old Flitwick, as perfectly ordinary and competent a professor as anyone could imagine, had to suffer her constant pointless interruptions throughout, with her little cough of
with the first wielder. This may be either by blood ties, or membership of the same magical family or "house". I incline to think a blood connection
He could have asked Severus, if he had let him into his confidence yet. But he had set his back getting fully better as the time of disclosure, and the wounds had not yet healed.
It was a strikingly handsome young man in a Slytherin Hogwarts uniform, wand in hand, wearing an air of arrogance like armor and threat, beside the statue of Slytherin wearing its shadow over his angular face with those striking eyes. It was Tom Riddle for the briefest moment, as Draco rounded the corner and raced inside.
! And even then, we met the others at the Three Broomsticks after!" It was like he had to negotiate for Draco's time.
"I'm going to force him to show himself," said Lupin. "If he really is a rat, it won't hurt him." Ron nodded, stepping aside, back to Hermione and Luna, while Potter kept his wand trained on Black the same. Lupin gestured Draco forward, and the moment came to reveal the man who would bring the Dark Lord back to life-
. It's all in your face now, you-" He reached up and felt, and gave Draco a puzzled look when he saw that he was wearing the golden rose clasp and still had hair in his eyes. "Is the enchantment on the clasp I gave you not working anymore?"
"Of course not," Draco said brightly, "Ssh," and his heart leaped so strongly to his throat when he made out Harry's voice clearly, it was like he had just caught sight of Bellatrix Lestrange. But this was not terror but hope that filled up his chest and lungs, the full expectation of good news after a test they had all been treating as ceremonial. And now the moment had come- and if it
"I do not need to be told," Shacklebolt said warmly, "How talented a wizard Draco is. As are you, Harry. You both take after your godfathers. And if I needed a reminder, Draco, Filius and Minerva have both been eloquent about your extraordinary capabilities in practical magic. Did you know that Minerva McGonagall is of the opinion that you both would make fine Aurors?"
have stolen it, that was more of a question. But at any rate, the Mirror was his, and he hoped more such mirrors would join it.
"Draco," Severus said in a tone that would brook no interruption. "I will only say this once, and I would prefer not to say it at all. So do not make me say it again. I have never been prouder to call myself your godfather."
"Kindly find a point eventually," Severus drawled, throwing back the rest of his tea and staring balefully at the dregs. His face looked singularly ghostly in the green firelight, his limp, thin strands of dark hair hanging in the way of it and casting shadows. "And none of your puerile attempts at manipulation or finesse-"
"No need to be jealous, Striker, I can teach you the spell whenever you like," Draco teased, and she began to work up one of her most disapproving looks, only for it to fall away when Kreacher brushed past, going down the stairs grumbling.
that!" Millie crowed, and Draco felt his heart sink slightly, thinking them very much capable of that, until she added, "NO WEASLEY TWINS! THEY DID A RUNNER! There goes the defense! And with that Weasley they've got
"No, if it's my birthday then it's your birthday too," he said stubbornly, and held up the bottle higher. "I made this for you. Happy birthday, Maman!"
"Maybe he could have played professional Quidditch," Draco offered weakly, and Sirius let out a shaky gasp and hugged Draco, stepping forward and enveloping him in his arms tightly. It was a new experience, when not greeting or parting, and it lasted longer. It felt like Sirius needed him to hold onto, the presence of someone who understood the guilt of abandoning your family, to insulate himself from that abandoned one's ghost.
Potter must have had a death wish. He stepped right over the last few bags and pulled one up against the wall, to sit on beside Draco. At least it was hard to smell that distinctive Amortentia-tinted scent of him with all the sawdust-like murkiness in the air, the sear of raw dark magic that smelled of over-burned charcoal. But when Potter turned to face him, leaning forward with his thick, soft-looking dark hair full of sand, Draco could smell it anyway. "Is that why you still call me Potter and no one else? Because you're scared if you don't keep me at arm's length, I'll start pitying you?" He ran his fingers through Draco's hair, smoothing over Draco's forehead.
Aragog seemed to be tired of talking. He was backing slowly into his domed web, but his fellow spiders continued to inch slowly towards them. "We'll just go, then," Potter called desperately to Aragog, and Draco's hand became alert around his wand again.
"Oh, that is hardly true," Dumbledore commented, and began to suck unperturbed on a lemon drop of his own. Draco might just have been imagining it on his end, but the tension in the air had his nerves flaring like Dumbledore had visibly reached for his wand instead. "Though rest assured I am most honored to hear that sentiment, from a young wizard of such unique talents."
When Draco tilted his head Dobby's way, he thought he could at least make out the long straight shape of a tower rising from a solid base of grounds at the bottom, if not the individual turrets and even windows that Dobby's webbed fingers meticulously pointed out. The tower was directly pointing in Draco's direction.
"Cast Reducto! Everywhere! We're taking this place apart!" Harry yelled, and as one, in unison, the eight members of Dumbledore's army fell into a circle against the sound of breaking glass and the furious howls of Death Eaters, and screamed, "REDUCTO!"
?" she squealed at the sight of Krum. "Did that awful bushy-haired girl break your heart, big boy? If you're ever lonely..."
cutting off every time he was about to make a useful point. And when they were told to practice the Color Change charm individually on their berets, she seemed to hone in immediately on the two least likely to succeed: Vince and Greg.
"They can't fix everything for you, Draco, magic and money and Malfoys," Potter whispered. Then they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower, and Potter panted out, "Nearly there!" The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not until they'd stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to breathe properly again. Granger breathed a sigh of relief and threw her head back to the night sky, clearly on edge after all of Draco's talk of expulsion. But then Potter and Draco sniped at each other so much, breaking her brief respite of peace, and she threatened to hex them both if they didn't just shut up.
"He said so once," Luna said softly, voice cracking, and Draco wanted to burn the courtroom to the ground.
"You are more well-informed than you have any right to be." Aberforth looked pleased by that. "She was glad to have me there out of the blue, reminiscing over old times. A doddering old bird, she is. And if I call someone old, you know it's true. But she was kind enough to let me look through old papers and rooms for memorabilia, of times gone by. I turned up something for you, boy. Something of use."
Hello all! In answer to some questions, first, as to how much better Harry was at the duel- Draco is correct that Harry did some research first this time, thinking he might duel Draco. But moreover, I see Harry's power as very raw and emotion-driven, drawing the pure power he has from the remnants of Voldemort in him, which can explode semi-uncontrolled. And unlike a more distant rival, this Draco brings out a very, very large number of conflicting, complex, powerful emotions in Harry. I won't say exactly what's going on in Harry's head about Draco, except that it's a mess.
"You say rob Aunt Bella like it's a bad thing," Draco interrupted, voice tight. His body felt numb from head to toe in his pajamas, like it was only yet half his own again. "But she's in Azkaban for life.
he could get dragged to the Headmaster's office in the middle of the night, just for having kissed the Boy Who Lived. But it was a possibility to consider.
"I told you so," Hermione said, and Sirius gave her a look while massaging his throat, like he regretted that blanket permission to stay over. She and Draco intended to make use of it until Harry hopefully passed his test and came to stay permanently. Weekly dinners over with the Grangers were the one night Sirius and Remus had to themselves. "I told you it wouldn't be so easy to keep beating him if you let him use dark-"
It was cruel enough that the universe had fated Draco to be defeated at every turn. The least it could have done was also make that ever-victorious adversary competent.
He got a book on Occlumency he had checked out from the library, lying back down and casting a dictation charm on Imoogi that he had learned in that month of purgatory at the Manor. The sound emitting from her stuffed body made it like she was reading it to him, and in retrospect, he might be in the process of growing at least slightly unhinged. But he did know it wasn't actually his dragon talking to him.
"Gilderoy, what are you…" Severus said, voice coming out embarrassingly husky. It must have been the first time he had been kissed in any number of years.
"Sectilis procella!" Theo yelled. Draco could have reflected back the tiny deadly shots of dark magic that flew through the air at him like small arrowheads, but he absorbed them instead. He couldn't have Theo's arm sliced up. Not before he
"It's alright," said Luna. But along with her neck and hair, the muddied suit jacket Draco had given her was dripped over in drying blood. Draco had to shake off Harry and Hermione, where he leaned down and began to hum, casting Vulnera satentur.
It made Draco annoyed they had to go to the Grangers, now that they were getting somewhere, and more annoyed it would be months on months before the papers would start publishing
"Because of those murders he committed?" she breathed, looking fascinated despite herself, at magical history so different than the droning sanitized lessons from Binns at Hogwarts.
"Reducto," she ordered, and he blew the log to bits, casting Ebublio to keep both him and her from being hit by the fragments. Then he elegantly flicked his wand, and made the fragments reassemble, the words
On the walk back, though, hand in hand, Harry asked the question Draco had been dreading. "What did it? What did you do to make the magical exhaustion that bad? It couldn't have
Draco's resolutions towards the passive approach were going up in smoke, for the most selfish reason in the world: if Black was no longer a wanted fugitive, there would no longer be Dementors at Hogwarts. "What do you mean, sir? Listen, I don't really think Black did those things, or that he actually wants to kill Potter-"
Draco felt his lower lip curl up unpleasantly. His head didn't even ache. He didn't know how long he'd been out, but between Severus and Pomfrey, they seemed to have done an exemplary job fixing him. He had been more sore after the centaur hoof. "It only made sense, sir. The three of them, they matter. But it's not like anyone would care if
"'My grandfather would always tell the story the same'," Theo read. "'He had worked at the Cathedral Reserve, at the foot of the Cathedral Peaks, for only a few months before he was called back to Sydney in 1891 for his mother's funeral. When he returned in a fortnight, the reserve was rubble, and every dragon and dragontamer was dead or disappeared."
"Do not speak of murder, though." Frederick bowed his head humbly. "Remember the times you went to church with us. Remember the verses of the Bible. The golden rule. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. And the Old Testament, Dantanian. An eye for an eye. Just that."
It was impossible to tell what it was for some time, uselessly wiping at it with his hands and sleeves, only getting it filthier and bloodier. Then he realized how he could see what it was, and plunged his arm with it elbow-deep into the snow. When he pulled his arm out, finally, he was shivering as well as sobbing, and the object he had taken from inside the torn chest of Grindelwald's he had cut open was showing him back his own reflection. It was a mirror.
He wished he had given Harry some piece of jewelry to kiss for luck, some inane gesture that would mean a great deal to Harry. He dwelt gloomily on the memory of the golden rose ring he'd made to track Harry in fourth year, and what had become of it. Remembering it on his father's hand and how he'd burned it right into the seared flesh turned his stomach. And it sent his mind rattling down the road of inventorying so many other mistakes, so many things he'd done which put him at disadvantage. It made him hate to remember himself in that position acting as he had, a stranger, whether tainted or vindictive fool.
He and Harry had missed out on one dueling session, but Harry was insistent they skip the review the next week and go on to Baubillious anyway. Harry proved the most inept at that, perhaps because Draco had a sneaking suspicion it was dark magic. But the week after, in their very last session, he caught on quickly to Lacarnum inflamari. It was embittering, teaching Harry that favorite spell of his, after using it to impress him at the World Cup at the start of the year. He was giving away the last of his tricks to Harry, and once he handed them over, he had nothing left for Harry to stick around for.
... he says you're not only the smartest witch of your generation, but the smartest of the wizards as well, and-"
"But how's the Basilisk been getting around the place?" said Ron. "A dirty great snake... Someone would've seen..."
"I... I think she's really cool," Neville said, and looked like he wished he had some sort of weapon like the sword of Gryffindor to place between himself and the fearsome Draco Malfoy.
"We get it, Draco," Hermione said, looking very pale, and looked out at Hagrid as if hoping he would somehow intuit what was being discussed and save them all from it. "I'm not disputing that you may have to take lethal measures against such a cruel and dangerous individual. What I'm worried about is the odds of your
A second later, Harry had taken Draco's face and cupped it, as if desperate for the privilege to be the one to comfort Draco. "I don't care about Quidditch," Harry said heatedly. "Not compared to- Draco, what's
"I don't associate with other Slytherins as much as you think. I'd like to believe it isn't any of my dormmates sneaking around under my nose, but I can't be sure. I'm not close to any of them."
"I tried to ask Severus about getting Dumbledore and the Order to intervene for him. But he laughed me out of his office. I wrote to Remus and Sirius, but they haven't written back yet..."
"Such a long time," Umbridge simpered. "My, what a lovely bracelet that is on your wrist. So intricate and arcane. So...
"Stop being a baby about it," Draco complained. "You have no idea how much that would hurt you, if I was actually
After such a declaration, there was really no help for it but to flee as well, though naturally in a different direction than Pansy.
"You tried to get Snape put in Azkaban, telling the world he'd been a Death Eater," Hermione observed. "I guess it's not shocking for someone to wish one of their failures reversed."
Still. He could have done without the gleeful spree of laughter it sent through the class's Slytherins.
Potter took out his wand, murmured, "Lumos!" and just enough light appeared to let them watch the path for signs of spiders. Ron followed suit, as did Draco, although Draco's attempt flared up as bright as a Lumos maxima before he could concentrate and make it shrink.
Perhaps that was a good call on her part, as the Longbottoms looked overwhelmed already by the time they made it to the living room. Granted, Neville looked the most worried of the four, but still, it was such a bizarre, unprecedented situation that poor family found themselves in. They'd had their miracle, and now in the wake of it, they had to figure out how to live in a world that had raced on and left them behind. Frank and Alice Longbottom were like time travelers, their old minds cast into their bodies years and years later. Instead of thrown to the past like Draco with his privileged knowledge, they were cast out into an unforgiving future, unprepared and ignorant.
," Draco said as coldly as he could. The syllables still came out heated as Fiendfyre, dragged out between his teeth grudging and seething. "It's my fault. Let
Harry seemed good enough at Incarcerous already. He said he thought he had done it before once or twice, though he couldn't remember when. But he also said he remembered it seeming different when Sirius and Remus did it, more powerful somehow. "It involves the neck the way they do that," Draco said warily. Three different times of Harry casting Incarcerous on his arms and legs, experimenting with moving the rope, had left Draco already longing to be accidentally knocked out or something. "Release me first and I'll tell you, alright?"
The difference was that it hadn't been Ron's bright red head to be hauled up from under the water by Harry, whose hands finally finished turning from webbed to human fingers again. It was Draco, blinking lake water out of his eyes, treading water, and struggling to process everything. All he could think was that Harry Potter was doubly an idiot: once for saving someone else's hostage, and ignoring everything Draco had told him about competitiveness. And twice an idiot, for loving Draco Malfoy.
Slowly, Draco nodded, they were called over to the textbook, and he put his hand on it with the rest, where they were whirled away, into the face of a very bright sunrise. Then Sirius was grinning down at where their large group of teenagers had fallen, looking more handsome and brilliant than the dawn, with great dark broken towers silhouetted behind him in the glare, telling them, "Welcome to Citadelle Xaphan."
Once they had taken a fork in the path, and he and Longbottom took the dog the other way from the others, Longbottom seized on his arm with a whimper. "Longbottom," Draco said firmly, "I said I would protect you, but if you insist on clinging to me like Pansy Parkinson drunk at a ball, I will not hesitate to take the dog and leave you behind."
"I have to get you-know-what," Harry hissed to Luna, "From you-know-who." Draco knew he meant the memory from Slughorn for Dumbledore, but Luna was left blinking, and then hurrying after her departing cousin for an explanation.
The picture that broke a thousand hearts- perhaps more? The Boy Who Lived has been acclaimed once more as the hero of the wizarding world after his battle with dark forces at the Ministry of Magic, and yet he has been harboring a dark secret, writes Malcolm Billock. Sixteen-year-old Harry Potter has recently been named the new Quidditch captain for Gryffindor, and yet it seems he may play for another team. The Boy Who Lived has bestowed his much-coveted affections on another boy, a boy whose father now resides in Azkaban, exposed to the world as a Death Eater in the Battle of the Ministry.
Other than Draco, only the girls were interested in this extracurricular bit of study. The Weasleys, save Ginny, seemed inclined to take it as a Christmas miracle and leave it at that. And Draco had shooed Ginny away harshly enough that she seemed disinclined to intrude on the Rat Thieves again. He could only imagine her response to Luna's oblivious enthusiasm, given the face Hermione made, before mastering herself and looking back down at her book. Hermione had always been so uncharacteristically gentle to Luna, among a hundred other things he adored about her. It made him feel even worse to burden her with something this foreign to her nature.
"Blackmail, Severus," Draco reminded him, frustrated that everyone seemed so far behind his train of thought=, when he was the one who'd discovered himself totally in the dark, about
Draco went back to Severus's chambers and sat there in his makeshift bed, gloomily reading and rereading
Which was good, given the mission incumbent upon him for the rest of March. March might very well might be his last month ever at Hogwarts, because his actions over spring break were liable to get him expelled. If they even left a person
intimacy with Harry, to start, and the theft of the Mirror of Erised not long before that. There was the story about Nott trying to kill Sirius, which Draco's questioning of Remus might have prompted them to look into and somehow find was now a lie.
Dantanian awoke to a voice he had only ever heard from a distance. He had seemed to avoid the man, with presumed success, all through his years at Hogwarts. Until now, laid out in a hospital bed blinking back sleep, after he had done something no headmaster on the planet could possibly ignore from their student.
"A letter that told us you'd been abducted and taken to Godric's Hollow," Luna called miserably, "So we all went there, and we searched for you so long, and then when we finally realized no one was there..."
know you couldn't be the Heir of Slytherin, but Harry- Harry says he thinks- I don't know, and Ron says he isn't sure, and he and Harry are so close..."
Can't you do this one thing for me, after everything I've done for you? I've risked so much to help you, Gilderoy. I've been your friend, your only friend. I've trusted you so much. Please don't betray my trust now."
"Maybe!" Draco shouted, focusing intently on that potent figure behind a wall of spreading red light. "Fumos!" He took himself and his shield out of the reach of Harry's spell, only for Harry to shout Meteleojinx recanto and aim another Expelliarmus at the same place. Of course, Draco was no longer there.
Eros went mad, and followed the words of the third daughter. She went and dug up her husband. But he did not laugh or smile or dance with her.
"You found the map where Harry left it," Hermione gasped, "And you switched it out." The twins nodded proudly. "You set a trap for Draco?"
Ginny brought them out fresh-squeezed lemonade, which she had made with her mother. They lay out in the basking sunlight, Ginny scurrying away after and leaving them as Striker, Cannon, and Frankenstein, weapons and weaponmakers with nothing to fight yet.
"I'm so sorry." She took a deep breath, the pink in the sunset casting a lovely glow from the crystals in her bracelet onto the wooden edge of the stands. "Draco, although we have not yet known each other a month, I have come to respect your cleverness and thoughtfulness. I am so grateful for your generosity, not just with this beautiful bracelet but of your time studying with me. Whatever anyone says of your family, I hope you know I see many good qualities in you- and although you say we aren't friends, I would feel privileged to someday call myself your friend. Just...
"I am not whipped," Harry whined, and his hands fell on Draco's waist. Draco moaned and dragged him in for another kiss, telling himself only one more.
"Well, he's practically Uncle Sirius's husband. I know it's not legal, but I think it would be nice if they got married, don't you?"
Party!" Potter hissed. "All- I don't know, cobwebs and shadows and freaky dead stuff! Nothing romantic, alright?"
"Don't joke about that," she said, and he made his most repentant face until she was calm enough to interrogate him about less choice topics. His answers there hardly made her any happier. "Oh, don't get me wrong, the snow globe sounds nice. Although I don't think his Muggle family will appreciate the sight of Quidditch players zooming around inside it. But that music box, Draco?"
The other four Slytherins turned as one, looking baffled not so much by his words as the friendly tone he asked them in. "Ah... yes?" Theo said after a long moment, dark blue eyes narrowing, looking unsure of the answer Draco wanted. That was one of the things that had drawn Draco most to Theo, though it had taken some time to understand it about a childhood friend. In those keen, calm eyes of Theo's was a depth capable of taking in and holding any secret.
Blood, the same healthy dark red as Gilderoy's, spilled from the stones, and over Draco's fingertips before he could remove them. He took that as perhaps necessary cross-contamination, but shifted backwards still, sliding as quickly as he dared over the assembled millunas like unlaid cobblestones. Draco looked up, and even from across the room, Draco could see Grindelwald mouthing, 'Lord of hell?' incredulously over at him, with a jerk of his head towards Gilderoy. Draco gave him a warning look, though thankfully he'd remained silent. Harry, for his part, was watching with more than enough healthy reverence, standing beside Grindelwald as a silent guard to keep him in line.
"How about you tell me first," Draco said levelly, "How you knew it was my mother at the citadel, and not Bellatrix Lestrange?" He took Harry's hand, his other hand gripped on the talon wand in his pocket. Theo had to know it would be suicide to take them both on at once. But if he thought he could get the jump on them- or if he was able to call someone else to his side...
of a dark lord. He could comfort Hermione in one sense, telling her Black wouldn't actually curse or hurt Potter, but he'd have to somehow make her believe him.
Dantanian's pockets were full of moonstones, like the ones in the room with the Mirror of Erised, and his secret hoard. He cast Locomotor mortis on each Black male in turn, and then lay the stones in a circle around young Phineas's kneeling body, eight in total. Phineas the elder raged and pleaded and threatened all the while. Finally, Dantanian finished, and stood over the boy, raising his wand with an unchangeable resolution in his beautiful dark eyes.
Draco skimmed over the letter from Percy on that rainy Monday afternoon, an owl that had come unceremoniously to a window in Gryffindor Tower the previous night. It was a letter longer even than the oversized missives Draco and Sirius tended to send each other. Between incoherent complaints about the embarrassment the Scabbers story had caused their family, Percy's overall message came through loud and clear: stay away from Harry Potter, and sever ties with the Order of the Phoenix entirely.
"I didn't actually mean- are you mad?" Dorian sputtered. "I just- Daniel, I couldn't wait any longer to talk to you alone. I don't know if you got my letters-"
Draco laughed breathlessly as Harry's face fell onto the pillow. "You did tell me," Draco panted, "That you... mmm... that you were only allowed to visit- for a little while..."
Harry couldn't have looked more confused, and then more ashamed. "What? Me- hate you? Draco, you were the one under the Imperius curse, not me. You didn't have a choice. I- I did, and I thought... God, I'm the one who took advantage of you-"
"For telling Hagrid it was just a mistake," Longbottom whispered. "Not that I did it because I was scared of a tree." Draco thought Longbottom getting scared had been implicit in his phrasing, but he supposed Gryffindors needed things spelled out for them. He shrugged, more uncomfortable with a grateful Longbottom than a betrayed one. "I hate getting scared so much," Longbottom whispered. "I don't know why I got sorted into Gryffindor. I'm never any good at being brave."
"Oh, I suppose it's nice, but I like mine better," she said, and showed off the Sleeping Beauty turquoise pendant he had made her.
"Or," Hermione whispered back, "It's just that someone's inside." She used her wand to melt the snow beside her feet, and found one of the large uneven gray stones that lined the buried path. Draco smiled at her, taking a step back with Luna, and she carefully levitated the stone, wordless, before floating it to the front door. Against the icicle-laden bronze, she twice let it hit.
Luna left with her father before midnight, along with all the other guests but Tonks. With Tonks, there, though, the party was only beginning, as she, Bill, Sirius, and Remus sat by the fire drinking. The Weasleys and Hermione were in the near vicinity, playing a prediction game for the year called 108 Sins, based off the Japanese tradition. Tonks had bought it for everyone, but seemed more interested in drinking, so the students had inherited all 108 of the small enchanted bells.
to get in when no one was there." Though that didn't accord with his working theory of Black trying to have a sentimental family reunion with godson Potter. It did set his mind wondering, though, almost regretting Severus's grudge, for having held him and Severus back from his initial thought- trying to find Black and talk to him themselves...
They all stood there paralyzed, still unseen, watching Harry writhe in pain, as he suffered what Draco had so many, many times in that one nightmare summer of 1996, the summer that was about to start. His summer with the distant figure of his Aunt Bella, unmistakable now, gaunt skeletal face behind a wild whip of dark hair like the tattered robes of a Dementor. She did not look like her Boggart. Her Boggart had not captured the energy that seemed to seethe off her dark frame like barely constrained bloodthirst.
"Harry, I thought you weren't allowed to come to the extra flying sessions," Hermione said awkwardly, with an apologetic look to Draco that Harry had to notice.
"Grimmauld," Draco said, and she looked as if a surprise test had been announced. And not one of her good subjects like Arithmancy or Charms. A last-minute exam in
Apparently Severus had not appreciated having his chambers invaded by two of his old schoolboy nemeses the past night, with a Langlocked Harry in tow, whom they demanded Severus fix. Severus had, with the antidote potion he now seemed to keep on hand solely for Draco-related Langlock occurrences. But Severus clearly considered it a singularly demeaning act to help them. And blamed Draco for subjecting him to it.
"You see!" Father exclaimed, ecstasy filling his eyes, as if he believed his own lies, as if his son had finally turned out to be everything he was expected to be. "Draco, you have brought pride... great pride to the name of Malfoy... my clever, clever son..."
Draco could see a version of himself that raced forward and silenced those words on Harry's lips, dove into Harry's kiss like going underwater and walked him back into the wall, over all the many versions of Harry's face that Draco had cracked, walked him back until they were stumbling over the cushions and Draco could pull Harry down and tell him,
But the qualifications of that boyfriend to punish interlopers did not stop girls from gathering under mistletoe when Harry passed. One would have thought those girls valued their tongues and noses more vitally. But Hermione explained they didn't think they could be faulted, if it was 'the mistletoe's fault'. Harry didn't seem to take it seriously, laughing and protesting his Quidditch-given ability to dodge antagonistic obstacles.
Draco expected a boring Gryffindor dare. But when Potter turned to Draco with steeliness in his green eyes, Draco could see a flash of Slytherin in him. "If we're right, then Draco has to show us what's really written in all those notebooks in invisible ink."
Harry didn't let his hand go that quickly. Draco's attempt at menace seemed to have had an opposite effect, as if he'd just been shockingly sweet. "Don't worry. I won't," he said quietly, and shot Draco a smile like a kiss before he let him go.
for it," and the Gryffindors nearby got faces like they couldn't tell whether or not Draco was joking.
Millie looked liable to slap him. "This is just a joke to you, isn't it? Whether you live or die? Do
"They breath fire," Draco blurted. "So if the Dementor couldn't feed- if it was a- mad homunculus already- it
Draco could put up with a few more false accusations this year, however unjust. If he was to be the scapegoat for everything in this castle now, from petrifications to unwanted romantic gestures, so be it. But he feared a worse reaction from the Gryffindors once Father's reply arrived.
"Don't freak out," Draco said, rolling his eyes. "It's not like he wallops me within an inch of my life or something. It's just stinging hexes and sometimes his walking stick, it's fine. Mostly just my back. It's nothing compared to Crucio-"
Only two people seemed to have taken this false romance as a net positive: Dobby and Luna. When he snuck down to try and get a late-night snack, he discovered the
Draco met his gaze, took a deep breath, and gathered his courage as he was reminded of what he had come to say. "Professor Lupin, I know I'm just a student, and I know it's not my place, but- Uncle Sirius and I, we've talked a lot these past months, and I do know him some, and- you do know he loves you, don't you?" Lupin's face flushed, biting his lip and looking down with a boyish, almost sweet look on his face.
Draco squirmed beneath Harry like a snake. He kicked off his trousers and trunks in one smooth motion, with Harry still clothed from head to toe, trainers even on. Harry sat back, jaw dropping as he stared at Draco, naked below him for the very first time. Draco fought his own sense of vulnerability. "Give me my wand," he ordered, and Harry didn't hesitate, fishing in the pockets of Draco's discarded slacks.
He cares about you, and worries about you, and he wants to know you, so badly. He wants to adopt you, to take you from those purple-faced Muggles and give you a life, a family. A real family. He says you seem just like your father."
of the former owner. By all reports, Grindelwald has been imprisoned in the castle of Nurmengard for decades, very much alive-"
Draco had expected more of the cringing and whining about Potter in a Slytherin uniform at the end of first year, but instead, he'd made Potter look pleased with himself. "Oh, so you're saying you'd want me around?"
Perhaps Potter would survive his visit to Malfoy Manor yet. Whether Draco himself would survive his time here now felt a slightly less promising prospect, but all seemed likely to be well, if he could only keep from giving the game away by laughing.
Lockhart's dazed glance slid to notice Draco's presence for the first time, and clouded further with confusion. "Who are you?"
Theo didn't react, just turned on his heel and made to walk away. But Harry pursued him, springing forward with the same alacrity as in the Department of Mysteries. "Where are you going? Why are you following Draco? Nott!"
"Baubillious!" Draco screamed, and he would never know if it was his own mercy, or just a combination of Black's dodging skills and his own poor aim, that kept the lightning bolt from hitting directly at Black. It impacted instead into the ceiling, driving a hole clean through, sending floors worth of ancient wood and stone crumbling down. Draco was thrown by the avalanche of rubble, as he assumed Black would be. He hoped it had knocked Black out as he sprinted the last few meters towards the doorway, already mentally charting the angle he would have to run to have that safe split second to Apparate, once he was back out on the street where he knew it would work-
Draco gave him as long as he needed, until he claimed he was successfully imagining his mind as a knife. "You have to be imagining it's a knife from inside the knife, though," Draco advised, "Not outside looking at a knife. You know what the knife looks like, yes, but you're at a location on it, or just comprising all of it. A knife looking out at the fire," he said, turning it to show off the green reflections in his hand. The moonstones seemed to pulse into white opals in the light. "If you have a consciousness separate from your visualization, that's still a presence that can be cut into..."
had committed, Verniculpa upsized. "Not rare in minors, to be sure. Even if they are... sixteen is it, Mr. Potter? Well, from a wizard of your power..."
Mr. Granger laughed at that, as did Mrs. Granger and Hermione, who were seated on the other side of the living room playing a card game. It was strange to see the family remain together after a meal, rather than removing to their own rooms after, but perhaps they were dawdling in fear the intrusive and untrustworthy wizard might abscond with some of the furnishings. "May I ask you, Mr. Granger," Draco asked as politely as he could, "What I did to displease you?"
made his heart calm down. He didn't remember exactly when she'd been petrified the first time around, but it couldn't happen around this many people. She was safe.
The Order had come to the decision that there was no point in trying to hide what half of Hogwarts had suspected by the time the pair graduated. So Remus looked her pleasantly in the eye, as if he was discussing the Defense curriculum with his impending successor, not proclaiming his entanglement with a convicted mass murderer, and answered, "We are partners. We are in love."
wish you had not. You will wish you had listened to your godfather, for once in your life, vain- oh, please, Draco, don't look in it. Please
"Oh, really?" Draco said distractedly, yawning and wishing they could go back to the blood magic books. "I shouldn't be surprised. I guess it's because the talon wand didn't want competition. Funny it considers the other core ones the same. He's lucky all the wands in his shop didn't disintegrate."
"Hagrid would never do something like that on purpose," Potter said, but that was different from how Hermione had said it.
Black, Malfoy, Grindelwald, whatever you won't curse people's tongues for calling you now, you'll be in the Forbidden Forest at midnight if you know what's good for you. And given your lack of self-preservation- if you know what's good for your soppy pet Gryffindors too. Just go in the front on the way past Hagrid's hut and follow the light. If you're late, I'll spare your useful friends, but the world will be definitively relieved of the burden of 1 (one) Weasley.
"Nothing bad, really," Blaise said quickly, glancing around rapidly. "Just that- that it's true that you are queer, whatever your father tells ours, because you fancy Theo!"
"You know this is about to be the worst day of your life, right?" Draco said softly, giving Fleet a heavy-lidded stare through his eyelashes, much like Aunt Bella had used to give her prey. Fleet looked like if he didn't piss himself right then and there, it would be a near thing.
"I know to be careful," Draco said defensively. "I wouldn't let it. I'd take myself out of the equation before that ever happened. You can keep the Grindelwald book, if that's what-"
He saw Harry at breakfast that morning, but couldn't bring himself to leave Luna and go over to sit at Gryffindor. Harry showed none of his distress, not the way Ron and even Ginny seemed to near him- Draco wondered if a certain ex-Kingsnake also had a vested rooting interest for Gryffindor as well- but Draco knew Harry too well to think his nerves would not be absolute murder right now.
Black scowled at him, looking about as likely to believe that as anyone would under the circumstances. He shook his hand, with pain visibly riddling through his body from it. Then he pointed to his mouth instead, like if he couldn't get his hand fixed, at least he wanted to yell at Draco about it. That, Draco could address. And his natural inclination was to be contrary, but not against a murderous madman. "That I can fix with just a counterspell, but it has to be by me. And I can't do it without a wand." Draco tried to look innocent and helpless. "I've never been any good at wandless magic."
As it was, Ginny's arrival only had Millie looking down and squinting dubiously. "I didn't just spot red robes, did I?" she asked warily. "And is that red
Once he had gotten his fill of hugging, he tried to thank Hagrid properly. "Thank you so much, Hagrid. If you hadn't given me private lessons..." Draco began. But Hagrid shook his head merrily as he tapped the bricks to open the way to Diagon Alley, which turned out to be much changed.
He sounded almost sure about that point. One could not tell if Karkaroff's visible performance of nausea was for the proximity with Gilderoy, or that slight doubt.
Hey guys! If there's some confusion about the Langlock, Draco's tongue does not prevent him from sharing information from the future. Where it has locked has been when he directly tries to say he is from the future. He can't say, for instance, "An enchanted mirror sent me back in time," but he could say, "Voldemort is going to rise again" or "Lupin is going to die" or something like that. And the "are you 25" thing was not an intentional reference- that's cool that was in Scott Pilgrim lol
Draco wanted to part from Harry with a kiss, but didn't even manage a kiss to the cheek once he'd taken a step inside the ordained threshold to Ravenclaw. There must have been something uniquely urgent to Dumbledore's orders, because he only got a tight grin from Harry before he nodded to him and sprinted away.
But that was the thing. Father couldn't make everything right anymore. Most of the time, all he did was make things worse.
"Oh," Harry said, chewing on his lip, "Yeah," and looked still inexplicably nervous, gazing around restlessly. Maybe he was wondering now how he would keep from drowning Draco's second-favorite Weasley.
Between Pomfrey and Severus, the concussion did not linger long, nor even the bruising under Draco's hair, after the level of whining Draco subjected Severus to on the subject. But the aftermath was felt long after, cutting into their concentration for exams, in Potter's new certainty that Severus was lying in wait to steal the stone for Voldemort. Granger, though, maintained that they were safe with Dumbledore around.
When the hubbub subsided, Professor McGonagall said, "Professor Sprout has informed me that the Mandrakes are ready for cutting at last. Tonight, we will be able to revive those people who have been Petrified. I need hardly remind you all that one of them may well be able to tell us who, or what, attacked them. I am hopeful that this dreadful year will end with our catching the culprit."
"I just need to sit down," Draco repeated, and when he slumped onto on the castle steps, Harry went into his bag and went for the draught of peace. He was thankfully too hurried to take notice of the book inside, his long-missing book that might to this day be attracting furious missives from Madam Pince or at least some heinous library fines.
"Hello?" Alice Longbottom asked tentatively. "Where... where am I?" She pulled her hand back and turned to her husband, hands going to his aged face, then his whitened hair. "Frank? Oh, Frank, look at you, what have they
"Gellert," Albus Dumbledore breathed, in a stunned wondering voice somewhere nearby. Then he strode quickly towards them, eyes all calm competence behind his spectacles. "Gellert Grindelwald," he identified more neutrally, false face already in place as if it had never fallen. "This is Gellert Grindelwald. Poppy!" Poppy was Madam Pomfrey's first name, it seemed, and she was standing near where Harry had been, previously seeing to that head wound. "Poppy, you must see if he is-"
Draco hugged her from behind, nuzzling her shoulder with a surge of affection so strong it almost hurt, knowing neither of them were totally safe at any time anymore.
when it came to the physical. But that had not prevented the free application of hands, nor of Draco's mouth a few surreptitious times, nor affected the frequency of contact. Just because they were going slow, didn't mean they couldn't go slow
Draco sat himself beside the site of experimentation without fear. He could only wish Hermione was there as he did what she likely would: experiment. Whatever heat the flame bore, even great compressed gusts of lethal blue-white, seemed to intensify from the mirror, sliding off its smooth surface like blood over an unblunted sword. Whether the fire was large or small in quantity- and Draco tested this at length- or the side of the mirror up, or Draco's personal distance, always the same answer to the question of fire, without any spells involved to prejudice it. Just blue color, and more heat.
"Your father," Severus said with a grimace, "Has not been shy spreading tales of your prowess with the curses of my invention: Langlock and Sectumsempra. Demonstrate Langlock." The mouth of the dummy had its fake tongue locked up. "Now Sectumsempra." Though it was not sand, an invisible sword cleanly slashed through all the limbs of that dummy, reducing it to a pile of doll parts on the unsanded wood floor.
"Fine," Theo said, but stayed until Draco used Harry's grip to lead him off to the nearest staircase and out of sight. Harry stared back as the staircase moved agonizingly slowly, watching Theo watching them.
I won't keep you in what I hope is suspense for much longer. I don't know if wherever you two are shacked up, you've gotten word about the World Cup final. Potter might have told you, by the mirror I sacrificed to him, on the altar of a godfather-godson relationship I expect to advance substantially in quality and quantity in light of my noble relinquishment. Before the attack on the tent city by Death Eaters, I had thought the most noteworthy incident would be a small victory of my own. You might be pleased to know that the odious Minister Fudge, who would have had the Dementor's Kiss administered to you should Severus and I not have flown up in the nick of time, has suffered yet another humiliation at the hands of Slytherins. I bet that Ireland would win but Krum would catch the Snitch, and what had we bet on? Our watches. If you would like me to make you a present of the Minister's omnipresent pocket watch, by all means, I will send it. I hope you could appreciate the humor in that, fugitive-from-the-Ministry uncle of mine.
Out exploded the cactus, expelling a dark green liquid out over every inch of the compartment. Draco would have used Ron as a human shield if he had been present, but as it was, he got caught in the face by it, as did Luna, from up closer. The moment Luna gave Neville a little praise, his quill set off an explosion. There was a metaphor there, if one looked closely enough.
Harry got himself another week of detentions from Umbridge, but no Black Quill appeared for those either. So either Draco's curse had done as he hoped, and scared Umbridge off the things for a while, or she just couldn't afford another yet.
But they had beaten them in the cup, and as professors and students alike abandoned their dignity in a mad collective ecstasy that Draco had never known for himself, he could see Potter hoisted on the shoulders of his adoring fans, Ginny Weasley staring up from right beneath him, while Ron let off red and gold fireworks with the twins.
"They live," Severus intoned. "I merely have something to impart you must know, before you begin your purchasing of supplies at Diagon Alley for the year." Draco opened his mouth to ask if he had been expelled-
"By telling me you were," Grindelwald said neatly. "You said information wasn't free, and you wouldn't even tell me your name, but you volunteer that you're Muggleborn. Therefore, you aren't. The question is why you would conceal that."
Luna smiled at Draco, and he squeezed her hand for a second under the bar, able to read her thoughts: she was proud that their little joke Valentine songs had the side effect of helping Harry's publicity, as much as they had been torture for Harry at the time.
Draco was in the middle of his impression of Mr. Granger's devastated reaction to Coventry's third, all four Gryffindors listening raptly, when a shadow fell over their table that caused Hermione to turn and shriek, "Harry!" She jumped up and embraced Potter, who returned the hug while looking over her shoulder at Draco.
"You are going to come back to Hogwarts with me." Draco felt a numbing calm wash over him. "I presume that's where you keep it. You're going to give it to me. For good-"
be one for the history books. But we're all tired and hungry, which is why..." On cue, the gold grid disappeared, to be replaced by a bright, cheery pink light from below. "I'll let Dobby do the talking!"
"This is a spell of my own creation. I invented it as a shield against Dementors. A Patronus of fire. But it should shield against humans too- some humans, that is. It will allow most to pass through, unharmed. Every Dementor is my enemy. But not every person. The only person the flames will hurt is someone who is my enemy."
Draco had taken the Tube before with Hermione, and thought it slimy and horrifying at first, calling it the death tunnel. He had gotten somewhat more used to it since. He put on a brave face now for Harry's sake.
Draco took that moment of zen to establish a weekly Sunday morning check-in. And Severus did not try to argue very hard against it, which from him was as enthusiastic agreement as you could get.
"Well, that's right out, then," Draco interrupted. "A Malfoy in the Hog's Head? It's against the laws of nature- the skin would crawl off my bones of its own volition-"
He'd been too pessimistic. Whatever their differences, he still looked back and saw them playing before he had gotten back inside the castle.
"You want to help?" Draco yawned. "Make yourself useful and set me a hot bath running. I'm due one of my infusions." Theo obeyed, and followed him to the bathroom. He poured the offered potion into the water, casting a handy spell to stir it quickly while Draco leaned against the wall waiting. "What?" he asked blearily, once Theo was done and lingered. "Planning to watch?"
never seeing the light of day, but that's neither here nor there... so our deal is all set to work splendidly- that is, um, as long as Mr. Malfoy is in agreement..."
Draco shrugged, though he knew he might be implicating Dobby in awful things by being honest. "Why not? It's not like I have any other friends left."
"It's like ancient Greek myths, in a way." Draco was feeling an insidious comfort in Grindelwald's company beginning, now that he had told the man his real name. "Arachne and Athena, you know that story? Arachne is those brothers and sisters. They dared to live in defiance of the powerful nobles of the land and the natural social order. The force of nature too. And their audacity- of
Instead of bantering, Harry looked sheepish. "You have to tell me if that makes you think I'm too dumb for you. I know it's a joke, but..."
to go home, but just to know whether it was an option. Or at least to hear something from his parents after that Howler as the months stretched on, rather than leaving him in limbo. In the end, he didn't send the letter, and got a wry look from Severus for once again covering half of Slytherin's holiday sign-up sheet with the block letters of DRACO MALFOY.
McGonagall was dabbing her eyes, Mrs. Weasley was holding onto Bill's shoulder and sobbing, and Hermione soon buried her face in Draco's shoulder as well. Luna was practically bouncing where she sat in excitement, while Ron looked shocked, Neville was watching the proposal with an admiring wistful look, and Harry was just smiling. He was looking over at Sirius and Remus with untainted adoration in his green eyes, like after witnessing something so beautiful, all of the anger and jealousy clogging up his heart had been washed away.
No magic was almost more of a gall than the latter, with what he had found himself in possession of, a mirror he kept perpetually on his person sleeping and waking. He wished he could go to Xaphan to bring it near the Mirror of Erised and see the results, not even to mention how much he wanted to check on Gilderoy after the scene witnessed between him and Severus. But Xaphan was flatly forbidden him, and the lack of wand made Remus's decision final. No secret Apparition away from this bedroom, for once.
"Stille Nacht... heilige Nacht. Alles schläft... einsam wacht," a warbling voice sang, footsteps sounding as inebriated as Draco's. "Nur das traute hochheilige- hochheilige Paar," the man sang in accented German, stumbling over the words. He wandered in, carrying a near-emptied bottle of whisky. From the look of the man, it hadn't been his first, spectacles dirty and his gray hair even filthier. His right hand held his wand, but even an intruder and a great tall mirror threatening the paint on his ceiling did not make him brandish it. Incredibly, he put his wand
If this was an attempt to extract information, he would have expected his fellow Slytherins to do a better job at it. Instead, they were just acting like weirdos. He was distracted enough as he approached the entrance to the Slytherin dungeons that the password dropped out of his mind. "Theo, what's the password?"
, in full view of her brothers, and stampeded to Dumbledore's office to regale him and McGonagall with lies so obvious, they did not even fool the Lilliputian intellect of one Mr. Potter?"
"What's that?" Harry asked, peering with interest at the news that Vernon found such an abomination. The television read:
"I think the mystery behind my wand might be tied up in all this," Draco explained, "Since the symbols that appeared on the Mirror of Erised did for my wand, but not for Ron's."
, without even the excuse of an important murder to commit there- but he had the reassurance of Potter ahead and Ron behind him, with Ron making a rather more awkward thumping way through by the sound of it.
Draco closed his eyes, feeling the tingling warmth go down his arm, with the wand feeling only an extension, like it was becoming part of his body, with a great set of warm marionette strings extended over the spider. "Aragog," Draco said, "Tell your children to carry us back to the edge of the Forbidden Forest closest to Hogwarts. Now."
the heir to this house. The last ever heir to House Black. You will watch me burn this house to the last of the embers before I am merciful enough to let you die."
painting sullying their portrait hall, with those oversized feet stood on the smooth chamber floor- between which, face-down, lay a small, black and blue-robed figure, with brilliant white-blond hair-
"Oh, and did you concur in this assessment, Theo? Did you find yourself at pains last year to resist my unwelcome advances?" Theo withered at his sarcasm. "Vince and Greg, did you have any part in these discussions?" They had never shaken their heads so quickly.
The offending dragon lay on his unmade bed beside his pillow, on top of sheets that were no longer plain green but silver with golden snitches. Imoogi had not a speck of dust on her, and had not yet lost her little baby dragon tooth necklace. Her long green body with its red spikes coiled over the snitches, with a stiffness to the red horns, and a plushness to the red underbelly that Draco could hardly believe she had used to have. If a toy could look young, she looked young.
It had been difficult since the World Cup to get up the energy to eat properly. Draco had ignored Severus's complaints that morning at breakfast, that Draco's energy issue wasn't been helped by Draco not forcing himself to eat more. But when at lunch, Severus had hinted that Draco's eating habits were making him look rather angular and unattractive, Draco had began to eat with gusto. He did so now as well, stuffing his face with roast, which did have the pleasant side effect of making it less expected for him to say things to his fellow Slytherins.
"Tomorrow morning, then," Harry said expressionlessly. "The Great Lake, at sunrise, alright? We can talk as much as you want, but I have to go, I don't want to keep the money a second longer than I have to, I don't need it, I don't deserve it..."
Bloody ingrate couldn't even be arsed to pay attention. Draco was missing his favorite cousin's very first Hogsmeade weekend for this? She stepped up to be his second in a duel, no questions asked, and this was how he repaid her? By ditching her for an uncommunicative Potter in a
"That's good," Mr. Granger said, and thumped Draco on the back, but in a rather friendly manner. "Good on you, lad. Don't let them give you any guff. You be who you are. And we're glad Hermione has a friend as brave as you."
have attended Hogwarts with him present, unless you are truly as old as Dantanian Noir or in that range. How well do you know Albus? Do you believe he has plans with this Potter boy? Do you disapprove?"
still belong to him..." He glanced at Mother, who nodded grimly, "And may have the means to connect to any other Black lodgings or possessions."
"I think it's a Black Dagger," Millie said nervously. "It's some old pureblood thing- look, it's real obsidian, I think- it's a demand, or a declaration of blood feud, or blood feud if you don't meet the demand- it's called
considered actively sabotaging Diggory, but to save his life, not that the ingrate would ever understand that. "Sounds like you'd better watch your back then, huh?"
"Yes, you," Severus said dryly, "The lover of Harry Potter. You, who defied the Dark Lord twice to his face, cast the spell to destroy the prophecy he had dedicated a year to attaining, led the mission to foil his plot at the Ministry, and got eleven of his followers put into Azkaban. You, who wields the talon wand... who cast Protego Diabolica, a spell invented and only known to be publicly executed before in such fashion by one Gellert Grindelwald, whom he has heard your Slytherin yearmates have nicknamed you after... You, to whom he
What was really astonishing this time was that Dobby wasn't alone in popping in hauling a table and chairs for them. One elf was Apparating in furniture with him, while a smaller elf was snapping her fingers and over and over, making the large pomegranates they ate for the antioxidants appear in their glorious powdered sugar-covered forms on the waiting plates.
"Who told you this?" Severus asked, and Draco stayed tight-lipped. "One must admire your Hufflepuff-esque loyalty, Draco, but if you distrust me enough that you fear I will repeat the name, or cause trouble for the one who told you, then it seems useless for you to confide in me at all-"
And there was nothing in his tone or words to mark that as fake, as much as Draco would have liked to have found something to quarrel with. "Then what- Harry, I don't understand..."
would fight for you like that, if you needed me. I would try and break down the gates of hell for you."
Severus wasted only a few more seconds staring at him searchingly with that hawk-like face before turning his attention to Draco's wand. The sight of it in the hand of almost anyone else would have sent Draco alight with panic, even if it was Father or Mother, but not Severus. "Did you believe," Severus intoned, expressiveness now flattened in each word to form a tunnel-like incision of curt superiority, "That your new proclivity for unsupervised magical experimentation would have passed unknown to me,
"Umbridge," Draco said impatiently. "Has she found out about us, Dobby?" Dobby nodded, and tried to kick himself. Draco got to his knees, grabbing his feet, and stared into those massive marble eyes resolutely. "Stop it. You don't have to punish yourself. You're no one's property to punish, do you hear me, Dobby?"
Luna looked down at her dirt and leaf-strewn legs, and shrugged. "I'm sure my favorite cousin will buy me new ones."
"I have heard you say you wish to be an Unspeakable, and I would naturally recommend Divination for that. But Professor McGonagall and Professor Snape expressed to me the belief that your ambitions have changed."
Ron and Hermione reacted predictably, Ron feeling he had a right to it instead as the actual Weasley, and Hermione expecting Potter to turn it in to McGonagall, as if she'd never met not just him but any actual thirteen-year-old boy before. At the very least, this was Potter's permission slip, so to speak, for Hogsmeade for the rest of the year. It looked as though it would have taken a pack of wolves to part Potter from it. Even though Hermione's fear that Black could be using one of the secret passages on the map to get into Hogwarts sounded reasonable. If you didn't already hold Draco's suspicions about Lupin.
"Is there a reason we're still discussing this?" Draco sighed, and took Potter's hand, not quite knowing why. He was surprised to find it cold and clammy, and for Potter to let him draw it to him, taking it and turning it upside down to trace the heart line.
Tears began to fall from Potter's eyes, the liquid green of them dissolving before him. Ron brought up a hand to clasp Potter's shoulder. "This
very long after. This was uncharted territory for him as well. He tried resolutely not to think of how Severus had died, and whether it had been ever-bleeding wounds from venom to do him in, rather than something direct and instantaneous like...
Draco was left to reflect on the incidental cruelty of that choice of Hermione's, Petrificus Totalus over Stupefy. It would be leaving Periander fully aware and helpless but to wait, as he had to watch Luna give priority to the conjured snakes first. One doubted he would be in superlative spirits once they let him speak again.
"It was my fault," Draco heard Harry say, and slowly, as respectfully blocking from view as he could, he lifted the top of the drapes from the face of the body.
Draco bit off a frustrated sigh. "I made this for you. Do you want it or not?" Luna shrugged, and Draco considered, then cast Pyritaverum to turn the vines around the snowdrops golden. "Aurulaquerum," Draco cast after, making the gold on them shimmer in the falling light, and Luna stared at it more admiringly. "Listen, Luna, do you really think he can say no with this on your head? You're royalty now," he declared, and lay it on her lovely braided crown of light hair. She adjusted it shyly, and then the Sleeping Beauty pendant around her neck, staring up at him with a fragile sort of courage growing on her face.
, period, but he gave you just a clue. A series of hoops to jump through. Really not the fair play he would probably claim it to be, the sod-"
"Why Pansy?" Draco was baffled. "She's not any closer to me than the rest of you lot. They were on the Kingsnakes together... but so were you, Astoria, Vince, Greg- Blaise was practically assistant manager too- what could he possibly want with her-"
It took someone who grew up with Millie to see the slight embarrassment there, in her stiffening shoulders and exaggerated nonchalance. "I meant that you run your mouth too much, Weasley. I don't have any opinions on the quality of your lips."
Eventually, the meeting broke up, with the most controversial disclosure the one that Michael Corner and his friends had come because he was dating Ginny Weasley. Ron took this like an announcement Corner had kidnapped Ginny and meant to sacrifice her in some blood ritual to the demon goddess Hecate, maybe the one on page 55 or 205.
Draco had very little idea how he ended up in Ravenclaw Tower, nor how he ended up in the shower there, trying to wash off some of the guilt. Nor did he think very much about it, save for the thought that kept resonating through his head, echoing and inexorable: at least I know now, who out of Orpheus and Eurydice should be the one to climb back out of hell.
He should have known they wouldn't let him off so easily. Remus came to visit before bed, easing his way in with hot cocoa and affection, before squarely asking what incident had precipitated this exhaustion. Draco fed him the narrative Harry must have, about finding Periander's grave empty on Valentine's Day and fearing for Severus, and then used as much of the truth as he could: finding out Severus was at Xaphan from McGonagall, exhausting himself getting there alone, and then throwing an embarrassing tantrum at Severus for worrying him, which had ended in imaginary "regrettable structural damage to Xaphan".
Draco took a deep breath. "Yes," he said, with every fiber in his body full of conviction, just as much conviction as he held that Harry Potter was about to die. "Yes, I do."
"How can you be certain?" she hissed, no more pacified after receiving his rough outline of the family structure and succession.
He looked more like the Dark Lord that Draco remembered from Malfoy Manor in the blue loop, no longer so starved and skeletal. A year back to life had done him good, filling out those albino bones and making him cut a more menacing figure in his flowing black robes. He was still gaunt, though, and his eyes were a terrible red. He looked nothing like the man Luna must be remembering so well. Draco cast a nervous glance at her, worried she would break down at the very sight of her Boggart upgraded to an even crueler monster. But she was standing just where she had been before, face as white as Voldemort's. Harry had already taken a step forward, putting himself between them and the grotesque snakelike monster, always and forever the hero, no matter how much he suffered.
"I'm fine," Draco said, able to tell what Harry was saying by watching his mouth more than anything. But slowly, the ringing in his ears faded too. Harry grabbed Draco's face, then wrapped his arms around him tightly. It was ostensibly to offer Draco comfort, but Draco had the awful feeling Harry was in the one in need of it. "I'm fine. You're just- your mind is just strong, Harry, it really is. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you remember things like that..."
"It would be likely. But if they do not, or delay overlong..." Severus's gaze swept over Draco, but again, he felt no attempts at Legilimency pushing at his shields, and that made him feel he had one ally left in this castle. "Would one expect the hypothetical caster of such a curse, bearing the power of its immediate reversal, to deliver clemency within any reasonable interval, and reverse his handiwork, however... justified?"
, with Potter's responding already a second sooner, and then Longbottom pushing off by himself for no good reason and rocketing up comically high. Draco was still having trouble connecting this Longbottom with the slayer of giant snakes. If he was a different person, he might have felt bad watching Longbottom crash back to the ground spectacularly and break his wrist, knowing he had foreknowledge to prevent it. But he had only saved Longbottom from that first accident in Potions as an experiment, and perhaps a grudging thank you for the snake-slaying. And because he did grow up to be really fit.
"Harry? Draco?" Hermione's voice called from below. "Will you come down here? Sirius was asking for the two of you."
Harry shrugged. "Didn't really feel like it," he muttered, and Draco had to poke him in the scar to get his gaze back on him again. "That's been hurting a lot recently," he admitted. "I haven't been sleeping." But Harry hadn't been coming to see him if he had nightmares, not since the trial. "I mean, what do you want me to say, Draco? I know I should just be happy to be away from the Dursleys, that the year's starting soon and I still get to go- that Sirius is free, that everyone's happy- that I'm still
Viktor had his teeth newly restored and a jubilant air with them, double-fisting what passed for beer steins in France. That name, though, made it fall away, and Draco wave a tipsy fist at him. "Come on, I know she's your ex-girlfriend, but she was your friend too, wasn't she? She listened on radio with her family! Come on, let them congratulate you- her parents too, they're Muggles! They love football!"
Draco stopped smiling when he saw Potter watching the two of them, and all the green in his eyes looked to be from the envy simmering on his face.
"Oh, I know, just-" Hermione bit her lip. "You might have told him you were going to the Ball after all, you know. Instead of letting it be a surprise."
"Hey!" Girl Weasley protested, drawing the attention of her brothers nearby, and Potter too, Draco realized with a stab of fear. He hadn't seen Potter sitting with them. "What are you doing?"
. She'll be spitting mad if I don't have it to tell her later." He regretted the expression when Neville turned out to have been listening. He'd been at the front of the class, Sprout's prize student helping with a demonstration, but he'd come back to his own Snargaluff. News of his ex-girlfriend seemed to make even good honest Neville Longbottom's ears perk up.
"I think I've got an idea," Hermione said cautiously, "About how to get you into Nurmengard. But I'm not so sure if it wouldn't be better if I hadn't."
Harry shot a sharp look at Draco. Draco hoped that look didn't give anything anyway. They hadn't actually discussed whether they would tell their friends what had happened. Draco had just assumed they wouldn't.
"Vat?" Krum looked baffled yet again by him. "But you said all your skill is as Seeker. I vant to see you play, Malfoy. Ve must have das Gedränge, ja?"
"Can we visit the hospital wing?" Draco asked anxiously, and ignored the looks of annoyance and disgust he'd earned. It wasn't like they hadn't already seen his tear-swollen face.
"I saw her!" Draco screamed, shaking with impotent rage. "I saw her, and I'm going to kill her! You can't save her! Tell me where she is!"
"Do you want to tell me," Draco asked softly, feeling his secret guilt swell up, "Exactly what you saw? It might... I don't know if you told Hermione." She shook her head. "It might help."
After the four-way session of incoherent sniping they descended into, Draco could hardly blame Madam Pince from ejecting them. He was sourer at Potter and Ron for refusing to go somewhere after, to discuss the matter in a civilized manner. The accusations that flew around then about Crookshanks and Scabbers showed part of why things had already been so strained between Hermione and the boys. Draco hardly won credibility back with Ron by blurting out that he was sure Scabbers had richly deserved it.
The Triwizard Cup fell from their hands as they hit the ground. Harry fell onto Draco, hands grasping at the silk of his shirt, slipping. "What- what was that?"
"Let's do this," Draco said, and she nodded. "We can set it all up before midnight. It's just the blood and the incantation that need to be exactly then. The cooled potion first. It says in the shape of the wheel's central star... do you want me to pour it?"
No matter how much you wanted to touch something, it was hard not to hesitate at it, if you thought touching it would wreck it. Draco could empathize with that feeling.
"Dragon egg!" Dantanian exclaimed excitedly, seeming to recall their mission then. His French sounded native like his mother's, as his English had too. He bounced a bit, waving his arms in the air, before a sharp glance and a finger to Astarte's lips hushed him. "You've gotten a dragon egg to sell," he whispered in English. "Maman, can we buy it? I want it. I want to raise a dragon!"
Draco tried to listen only as much as he had to, in order to avoid the appearance of not listening. Remus was certainly thorough, one could give him that. It mainly consisted of a litany of the advantages that Draco had over others. The power he wielded, not merely superficially- through finances, blood, connections- nor merely through personal appeal and friendship, but also through the twin pillars of debt and manipulation. Draco, Remus calmly stressed, needed not to misuse these powers of his, not to merely suit his own fantasies of power, because he was so capable, when it came to undermining the Order of the Phoenix and the work it was meant to do. Leading overall to the impression that if the wizarding world fell, it could very well be Draco's fault.
Severus's nod had Draco getting excited, lashing out at the remaining dummies to show off. He had been going back to old lessons from the blue loop this summer, and practicing on his own. He had some things to show off.
He made his first appearance at the Halloween Feast in the red line, and was amused to watch all of the Slytherin table seem to relax, seeing him take a seat there. Memories of him loosing the Malfoy family troll in the dungeons two years ago had not faded quickly. "No need for a public service announcement this year, then?" Blaise quipped.
They went back up to the Great Hall, for Potter to take a last wistful look at all of the decorations he would not be enjoying. They found Ron and Hermione with Hagrid, admiring one of the pumpkins he'd just finished bringing in, larger almost than Hagrid himself. "Guess again," he was saying to Ron and Hermione eagerly. "What do yeh think it is, then?"
Draco barely resisted the urge to hug her. Then she extended her own arms for a hug, and he let himself oblige. Any lingering unease about the Room of Requirement seemed to melt in the presence of her gentle, otherworldly calm. "Thank you, Luna, thank you. I knew I could count on you." He snorted after a moment. "I'm not in danger, though. The duel's against Ron."
Draco began to cry and dropped his wand, letting it clatter on the floor between them. She tilted her head inquisitively at the sight, as if she had nothing at all to do with its cause, and pouted down at him. "Oh, poppet. Are you going to beg for mercy? I do love when you beg
"I don't want to, please," Gilderoy gasped, and this was not exactly calculated to entice Grindelwald to cooperate.
"You know," Draco drawled, propping his chin on his hand to smirk at Theo properly, "I rather like the sound of that. If nothing else, though, you've given me a name for it. It will certainly, no pun intended, help me with my
"He did?" Hermione asked, in a disbelief tinged over with despair, and then sank to the ground against the shelf, rubbing at her eyes like whatever awful dream this was, she wanted out of it.
There was no signature, which Harry seemed to find menacing. He went ashen as he read the note. Meanwhile, as Draco pulled them aside into an empty classroom, it was all he could do to hold back his giggles. "Could this be your aunt?" Harry asked breathlessly. "Or Nott? Someone's trying to lure you into a trap again-"
"Well," Draco groaned, trying to turn his head away from something simply too good, earlobe so sensitive he didn't even want it touched. Harry's mouth fell beneath instead, sucking at a patch of skin below. Draco's lower body pulsed so much at the feeling, he was afraid he was going to get off without meaning to, just at the friction through their clothes and the way Harry kissed his skin. "It was meant to show us that... that we have no... no chemistry, that it wouldn't feel good if we ever... tried anything, so we'd know there was, ah, nothing but friendship between us- mmm..."
"So do you," Harry said, and Draco turned his head in silent invitation. He heard Harry take a sharp breath in, but eventually, he obeyed, pulling the grass from Draco's hair with a far more perfunctory yanking motion. Draco sighed and yawned, relaxing down into the couch once Harry was done. "God, you really are drunk, aren't you?"
"Temperament changes," Shacklebolt said evenly, "As we mature, and as our circumstances change." As if Draco's circumstances had been extraordinarily difficult, and mitigated any reproaches Draco could cast on himself. Draco could not get out of this conversation fast enough. "But from what I have observed, you do have a considerable instinct to protect others. That lies at the heart of the Auror's mission. And it can't be taught."
Dantanian considered. "No," he said. "Well, not entirely." Lamia laughed at that, tears escaping her eyes as she huffed out a bit of amusement despite herself. "I'm curious. Your family sounds interesting. Is the curse just in your blood? And the menagerie- is it entirely of Maledictus-is-ay- I don't know the plural. Is it all your kin?"
Draco gave an apologetic smile. When bid to cast, he raised his wand and strained for a wordless Impedimenta. It came out, albeit feeling weaker than usual. With no shield worth the name mustered by Harry, it still sent him lurching. They had to wait for Harry to recover, and then Severus urged them on again.
"Professor Snape and I heard noises, Professor," said Filch. "Peeves the poltergeist, throwing things around as usual- and then Professor Snape discovered that someone had broken into his off-"
They'd set off a chain reaction, with their explosions leading to more crashes and ghostly voices determined to speak of the future that had passed them by. Shards of glass fell and cut at them, and Draco saw one slice a cut across Luna's face. At her shriek, he tried to lunge for her, but then he couldn't see her, as an entire shelf crashed between them. Then he was just running, as he knew they all were, sprinting in the direction of the door without able to see it or much of anything anymore. He ran for his life, unable to hear anyone doing the same or anyone pursuing him, and ran through the door without daring to lock it shut behind him, not knowing who else might have escaped.
Severus frowned before waving a hand at him dismissively. "Out!" he barked, which was a sign Severus might have gotten an idea.
"Don't panic, Harry, it's just his omniscient act he likes to try and pull off," Draco said impatiently. "One of his parlor tricks. Easier in an improved parlor." Grindelwald lifted the gold goblet in archly grateful acknowledgment. "Grindelwald can't read your mind. He can just use observation well. Sherlock bloody Holmes here..." Another twitch of those sly lips as Grindelwald put the goblet aside. "Last time, I told him you were in my year at Hogwarts, so looking at us he could have guessed. That is, if he didn't overhear you bellowing about our shared Defense class." He gave Grindelwald his best lofty, unimpressed look. "Or he could just be looking at, I don't know, your lightning bolt scar."
," Potter cut in violently, looking more outraged than Weasley and Granger put together. Weasley didn't even have time to get grossed out, with Potter's overreaction to distract him. "He's way too old for you. You shouldn't talk like that, Draco. You're eleven, for God's sake-"
Draco felt a sharp pang in his chest, reminded of the last conversation they'd had as anything but enemies. "Well, I more than like you," Draco said, lowering his voice. "You know that, don't you? So if there's anything you need to ask me, baby, just ask it."
"Harry and I see different things in it," Weasley said, walking before it as if to confirm his hair really was that red. "When I look, I'm older- I'm Head Boy and Quidditch captain, and we won the House Cup and Quidditch Cup," he said, and looked fond as he narrated his vision. "So I thought it could be the future," he went on, not seeming to see Draco's reflection jerking physically in surprise. "But what Harry saw was more like the past. And it's really affected him. He's barely been eating since he found it, and he's looked far away all the time, like nothing interests him but the mirror. He didn't want to play chess or see Hagrid or do anything. It's like he doesn't care about real life anymore. Do you think this could be dark magic?"
"Harry!" Draco cried out, grabbing his arm, but just like when Harry got too wound up at Draco to see the Snitch beside him, he didn't look up, just at Draco.
"Whose side are you on?" Luna called out wildly, once again trying to draw the children behind her. The Slytherins, though, had no eyes for the first-years, nor did they almost seem to have noticed their presence. Draco's was enough for them. "Are you with the Death Eaters? Did one of you cast that mark?"
"Maybe. Or just... I don't know. Maybe he thought Severus was the real thing, you know? What he'd been pretending to be. Someone with all the strength and toughness and experience with darkness that Lockhart pretended to have. Just without all the glamour and gold and show of it. Severus is the
A more feminine wave of titters swept through at the awkwardness of Neville's manner, but Luna just stared up at Neville happily. "Alright," she said mildly, and leaned up on her tiptoes, closing her eyes and pursing her lips to be kissed.
No, the fluctuating, beautiful light came from a crystal bell jar at the far end of the room, which entranced Ron as they passed, though Ginny dragged him unceremoniously away by the arm, with the sound of birds chirping added to the endless unsynchronized mass of foreboding ticking.
Draco looked up from his snake fangs with the other first-years still on nettle-weighing, and forced some semblance of an expression onto his face.
I feel- you're the most incredible person I've ever met. You- you told me once, that you could climb down into hell and come out unscathed, and it's true. I know you've
Draco had a trump card, and he played it without flinching. "Don't you want to give Frank and Alice Longbottom back their wands?"
"Fine," Draco said, and conjured himself a great number of pillows. Grindelwald admired them, Draco's sumptuous aristocratic default of black and gold and bronze of silk and velvet with fringed edges. Or perhaps he was more admiring the figure Draco cut lounging back on top of them.
this thing. Yet here he was, carefully levitating it up staircases, unable to use the cloak or the map. He was repeating history with this transport, not to succeed at the same project, but to destroy any chance of its recurrence. It would have gone smoothly, if Draco had managed not to drop the cabinet halfway up a moving staircase.
It took entirely too long for either of the men to do anything then, just staring at each other like one or both was bound not to make it out of this hut alive. But then Hagrid's voice sounded, from not very far away. "Draco, are yeh still there waitin'? I'm sorry, little dragon... turns out yer Head o' House weren't needin' any eggs after all, funny that..."
She didn't know he had seven years and change of calling her Granger if she was lucky, Mudblood if she wasn't, instead of a half-year and so of the name Granger to erase. She was still Granger when she came to him excited one day and announced they had found the answer to their Nicholas Flamel question, showing him an Albus Dumbledore chocolate frog card of all things, before repeating the story of Hagrid's slip about the package from Gringotts being business between Dumbledore and Flamel. She insisted he come out of the library with her and her boys to see something next. He was left waiting awkwardly in the Gryffindor common room for her to come down from the girls' dorm with a book. Potter and Weasley's presence kept anyone from trying to eject him, but he stood out like a green sore thumb in this tacky eyesore of a common room. At least soon enough she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.
"And what makes you think," Draco whispered, willing Potter to go ahead and hit him if he was going to stay this close, "What could ever make you think you know anything about me either?"
"Come back here, Frankenstein, you're scaring them," Hermione hissed, and dragged Draco back to his cauldron next to hers.
Draco wrote a letter to his mother before sign-ups for Easter break, asking if she wanted him to come home for Easter. He had every year except sixth. It wasn't exactly that he
Their surprisingly short trip over what had once been swamp and broken stone, now turned to grass and cobblestone, ended at a familiar place. Gilderoy proved able to carry the mirror with his own magic, and only brought it down when he saw Draco not following. "Is something wrong?" Gilderoy peered up at the looming shape of the library tower, unsuspecting. "This is the most intact tower. Your kind guardians have allowed me to live here."
Draco spent an inordinate amount of time at the mirror with his new Ravenclaw uniform on, ignoring the mirror's commentary as he assessed his reflection. Where someone else might have been having an identity crisis, he had more mundane motives. It was like Severus called him.
"What? Hey! What's that supposed to mean?" Draco yelped indignantly, but she and Ron and Luna just laughed at Draco all the way back home.
"Stop calling me that," Draco said in a small voice. "I preferred 'burdensome'. Anyway, I just need to know one thing. What you did at Nurmengard, protecting me and Harry and all, you can't excuse that away as keeping up your cover, can you?" Severus shook his head curtly. "So you've been exposed to the Death Eaters."
Draco cried out, rearing backwards as a rush of wind pushed his heavy armchair back several inches, breaking the eye contact and forcing him out of Harry's mind. "Oh, God," Harry said, grasping at his head. "Oh,
Draco dropped Thomas's West Ham football in a muddy snowbank, prompting great Gryffindor jeering at his failure in juggling. He made half-hearted excuses before following her behind a pillar in the courtyard. "I want to meet him," she repeated, "So I can judge his story for myself, it's the only way I can think of to figure out any better whether it's true. All the research I've been doing, it just proves they were all friends, and all members of the Order of the Phoenix. It doesn't prove whether it was him or Pettigrew to have really been the Secret Keeper, so..." Draco pulled out the mirror and she swatted him. "Draco, now is not the time to fix your
Potter used his hand to tug Draco half across the desk, leaning down to stare him right in the eye again, faces close, along with Potter's breath, his scent, his nearness, all palpable threats to the pretense Draco always had to keep up of not caring, not wanting. And he must have done a damn good job at it, because otherwise this was cruel by Potter, too damned cruel.
Draco would have if he could, but there was nothing to mock. There was not a part of Harry he thought he could mention without betraying himself. He'd long resented Harry for being essentially perfect, but it was too much for him to be perfect-
"Did Harry tell you what the Dark Lord said about Azkaban?" Draco asked anxiously. "About how he said the Lestranges will get out, and the Dementors will join his side-"
"Hey, listen," Draco said cautiously, not quite sure how to approach it, but forced himself to once the tea was done. "Hagrid, you went to school at Hogwarts a long time ago, didn't you? Did you know a student with the initials T.M. Riddle? I think you two were at school at the same time."
"A stress ball?" Severus asked once he opened it, reading its description with astonishment. "Charmed to give stress to the owner?"
rather interesting, though, what she explained about the corresponding Mexican Day of the Dead and its calacas, often in the form of masks of skulls and the dead, suggesting that the origin of the mumming was to mimic and fit in with the night's otherworldly visitors. Even if Ron and Harry seemed to fall half-asleep by the time she was done.
When Harry spun her again, her long loose straight red hair swung in a wave of fire, brilliant in the dimming light. It must remind Harry of his mother's.
By the time Draco finished, Ron was holding onto his stomach, trying not to laugh right from his diaphragm. "Bloody hell," Ron gasped. "This is the best thing I've ever heard."
when it came to these things. She might as well have rented one of those neon Muggle signs to hang flashing over her head reading FASCISM FOR FUN AND PROFIT.
Remus looked ready to die of embarrassment, but pressed his ear to the door regardless as Draco sprinted up the stairs. He looked dubious once Draco returned from his room with two sets of Extendable Ears. "What are those? Those are from Weasley's Wizard Wheezes, aren't they?"
"Do something," Draco whispered to his father as Harry screamed. "Stop this, or untie my wrists- let me use my wand, let me fight with him-"
"For chimeras, a chimera egg," Severus intoned, "Very difficult if not impossible, to procure any other ingredient from them. For a snake, the egg was-"
Draco clasped Lockhart's right hand in the air. Severus drew his wand and stood above them, while Lockhart shot one last furtive look up at Severus, whom he seemed to find particularly arresting at this angle. Then Severus heaved one of his infinitely burdened sighs, and pushed his wand against their hands, a spark of readied magic fizzing at their skin.
"Just like that," Draco agreed, and Ron seemed to be visibly suppressing his skepticism. "I forgave you lot for thinking I was the Heir of Slytherin, didn't I? And Ron, he... Severus... well, no, I..." Draco supposed that from the outside it had to seem incredible, how Severus's decision to save Sirius could have made up for the betrayal that
Grindelwald's lip curled, looking caught between disdain and alarm. "My dear Kaktusblüte, do you travel
"You don't need my permission, if that's what you're asking," Draco said, surprised to hear such a mundane question. Even if he knew that after her first year, romance could never be a simple, mundane, completely safe thing for Luna again.
"I'm sure they'll clear you, Harry. There's definitely something in the International Statute of Secrecy about being allowed to use magic to save your own life-"
"You just don't understand these things, Hermione," Draco groaned, watching her get more and more frustrated, as her attempts to speak to the elves about the prospect of their emancipation were met with more and more frightened avoidance. "To them, the idea of being freed is the worst punishment imaginable. Worse probably than death. It's like you're threatening them with the guillotine. They'll all be relieved once you're gone, and whisper tales to frighten each other about the Muggleborn girl who mercilessly threatened them."
Strangers. Draco had wanted to stay that way until he could ask Severus what to do, had rearranged their schedule to that end, and yet all his interference had done was ensure he met Harry Potter on the same fateful day. Except today he was pathetic. And you never got another chance to make a first impression.
past, personally, but he still took out his sixth notebook and recorded them faithfully, imploring for Harry to recall in the most detail he could. "I don't think this is in the spirit of how Dumbledore intends them," Hermione said disapprovingly.
Harry sounded both reluctant and relieved as he told him, "I really have been thinking. And we'll talk, but Dumbledore really did want me back quickly, like it's urgent." His ears were very red.
"Just touch me the way you'd touch yourself. Here, put your fingers in my mouth," Draco ordered, and Harry obeyed. He could taste the saltiness of his own arousal as he sucked Harry's index and middle finger in, hollowing his cheeks before letting them out with a wet pop. By the time Draco was done getting Harry's hand wet, he could see Harry straining at his jeans.
"Not all," Remus said slowly. "Draco, I'm going to ask you something... personal, but as your guardian, I do feel it is my place, as uncomfortable as it may be. Please, don't go into any detail, but- have you and Harry been intimate yet?"
It was exactly what Draco had wanted. One of the goals for the year, even. Unless it meant he had broken something irreparably that had once led to the Order's victory. Draco's eyes went in confusion to Dumbledore's departing back as he wondered,
Potter carried on as if he hadn't heard him. "But you- you'd think it was cool, wouldn't you, if he got chosen? And if he did all those dangerous tasks- if he won- you'd be really impressed with him, wouldn't you? Would you want to snog him and all that even more then?"
"Can we at least see?" Hermione asked tentatively. "Maybe it's not so bad... you're probably being too hard on yourself..."
Flint and the others were staring at the fallen body of Higgs instead, who they had not been fast enough to keep from hitting the ground. Draco offered Flint the Snitch with a level face, before crouching down over Higgs. "Enervate," Draco said, and Higgs's eyes flickered dazedly open. Draco could see his nose was broken at a minimum, with more perhaps in his body cracked by the fall. There was no telling whether this would keep Higgs out of Quidditch even in the short-term, with the miracles of magical medicine. But Draco thought he had made his point nonetheless. And he felt a shameful rush when he stole a glance up at the stands, and Potter was still there.
actually the first person he had ever told, in either timeline. 'Telling' Theo with a drunken blow job didn't really count.
Draco chose to take 'everything' in the narrowest sense of logistics for hanging out together. "Well, maybe," Draco said defiantly. "Maybe I wish you were in Slytherin, what about that?"
"Draco!" Hermione's voice was the first to call as he hurried down the stairs he knew went the quickest to the dungeons, but Potter's touch was the first to impact. Draco couldn't stop him from pushing him against the stone wall on the landing, but he did keep the old leather clenched firmly in his hand. "Draco, what are you
," Draco gasped, linking his palms again, even as the press of Harry's chest against his, the embrace sinking in with their weight going lax against each other, reminded Draco that Harry was the best, and that was the problem too. "Why would you do that? I would- would have- would have
The werewolf laughed and stalked forward, making the first-years shriek in terror and break into a sprint towards the upperclassmen they clearly saw as their saviors. Draco almost thought they had managed it before he realized that of the first-years arriving to virtually fall at their feet in relief, one of the boys seizing at Luna's sleeve like she was an angel of salvation, there were only two.
Pansy let out a small, heartbroken sound of dismay, and it all might have turned even uglier then, but for the arrival of someone crying out Millicent Bulstrode's name. "Millie!" called Ginny Weasley, and came running around the corner, only to stop dismayed at the sight of all five Slytherins, lined up facing Draco like the enemy. "Draco," she gasped. "Draco, what's going on? Millie?"
Ron turned towards the portrait hole, arm around Harry's shoulders consolingly. Draco grabbed Hermione's arm to pull her away in turn. At least he managed to get her down the first moving staircase before she broke down into tears of her own.
Imagine being that awkward, where you had someone you liked that much, that you would just hang around them that pathetically, not
He spoke in an unusually firm and deep tone. "You don't have magical exhaustion, do you?" Draco snorted noncommittally. "You told your uncles you threw some magical tantrum at Xaphan that day. You didn't. And that you tired yourself Apparating back and forth from Hogwarts to Xaphan- Draco, you did that
Harry managed to help him get his draught down, drop by drop. Then he wrapped his arms around Draco, and held him as he cried and tried to breathe in front of the two graves.
blood was the more pertinent question. Draco had almost never met a person better at being underestimated than Remus Lupin.
Perhaps all the Death Eaters were thinking that too as they exchanged glances. More likely Crouch, though. And there was poor Father, with Wormtail on one side and empty space on the other. Father, as any rational person would, chose to look in the direction of the empty space.
from turning their women to magical creature slaves. "And that he was going to start making me my own, too."
When he came back, Sirius and Remus had left, and the Gryffindors had worked out that as the girl, Ginny got her own bed, then Fred and George had one, and then Ron and Harry. But Draco caught Harry looking up longingly towards Draco's taller bed. "Come up and sit up here for a minute," Draco said. Harry's eyes focused meaningfully, only to go distant once he realized Draco was beckoning literally everyone.
It was perhaps good that Harry slept in later than Draco that morning. Draco snuck down the stairs without him, planning to put Harry's present at the front of the pile, but then robes billowed before him. Robes only ever strictly in black.
Dorian seemed unable to form words, even as Dantanian waited. His silver-blue eyes were saucers on his cute young face, lips fallen half-parted, every feature written with astonishment. If not, perhaps, the kind of repulsed, bone-chilled terror that Dantanian must have intended. "You will draw no further attention to me in that manner," Dantanian finally went on, "Because I am not, in fact, interesting." Dorian's eyes registered their confusion, but only slightly, behind mesmerized fascination. "I am the least interesting student at Hogwarts, and you will
"What?" Neville cried, panicked, and seemed instinctively to look down at his clothes. Poor Neville had yet another stressor added, as he was going to have to go through that whole
"What?" Grindelwald looked thrown, until Draco explained the story of Flamel's resolution to die and Voldemort's pursuit of the stone. Grindelwald had known of Voldemort, Dumbledore's opposition to him, and the circumstances of Voldemort's defeat and the Boy Who Lived, though his knowledge seemed to have been cut off well before he could get much further than that, to, say, Voldemort's return. He looked more animated than ever, at the chronicle of Dumbledore's ownership of the Mirror of Erised, his unorthodox use of it, and the way it had worked in his favor with the pure heart of the Boy Who Lived.
, you see." He pulled his hair out of his clasp, deliberately fluffing it, before pulling off his coat and posing ostentatiously. "Beauty is a powerful force against evil, you know- ow!" Ron had begun to pelt him with pillows, and Draco waved his wand to merrily retaliate, until Peter's voice sounded above them.
been an awful choice of memory, if he was going for untainted happiness. He began to circle through a Rolodex of less tainted-seeming memories, like a handful of Polaroids off his wall.
The memory ended and Draco pulled himself out of the Pensieve. Severus pushed him out of the way impatiently, submerging his own face.
She played with the Ironbelly crossly. "I'm not wearing this, then, Frankenstein," she groused. "Not if the price is
"And me? What will happen to me?" Draco heard the selfishness in his voice, and made the effort to amend it, weak as he was beginning to feel. "I want you to know, Headmaster, that everything was my idea, and any punishment to come, it shouldn't be on the others. It should all fall on my head. Not
Dorian stepped forward anyway, and took Dantanian's shoulders with a surprising lack of fear for the 'black swan'. "You can lead, if you like," Dorian said, charming as the rising moon, and by the time the cellos were striking up their slowest, most dreamy melody of the night, Dantanian was letting Dorian lead him into a dance. A ghost's soprano began a languishing melody in Latin, as if lamenting a tragedy yet to happen.
"That knowledge will add to the Order's peace of mind," Severus commented mildly, "And I suspect they will understand your desire to protect your mother. I have omitted the information that you tortured her for the information on the attack."
Krum leaped back and hit his elbows hard against some school brooms. He didn't seem to feel the blow at all, in the wake of Draco's verbal one. "Vat- but- how did you know?"
"Um," Draco considered. "Yeah, pretty much. You wanted to be part of this, Ginevra Weasley, well, welcome to the show."
He was not sure if it was entirely acceptable for a professor to throw such a large book in his student's direction on his way out.
"See you return to your dormitories before you are seen," Severus said without an expression, and turned on his heel and left the hospital wing.
Draco didn't know what to say to that. "Yes, it is. I've seen how much you can handle yourself by now. More than me, probably." Hermione harrumphed but looked secretly pleased.
"Haven't you guessed yet, Harry Potter?" said Riddle softly. "Luna Lovegood opened the Chamber of Secrets. She strangled the school roosters and daubed threatening messages on the walls. She set the serpent of Slytherin on four Mudbloods, and the Squib's cat."
"I'm not hoarding the books. There just isn't much on it, I checked. And I'm working on other research right now anyway. Soon, if we make the breakthrough I think we will, I
With a wordless yell, the tall dark shadow raised his wand over his head and slashed it through the air like slitting a throat. It was like all the air left the room at once. The ring of blue flames died in an instant. Protego Diabolica- the most powerful spell Draco knew, his trump card, the only ace he had left- it had been dismantled by the Dark Lord without that hideous noseless face having to utter a single word.
"He doesn't have the Dark Mark. I saw his left sleeve rolled up when- when he got it wet in Potions. I don't think it was a glamour hiding it either."
I would really like for us to play Quidditch together again sometime if you wanted. You're really good at it.
Theo's head whirled, only to turn to a statue at the sight of the boy he had recently told they were
As begrudgingly as Draco admitted it, increased proximity to Potter had proved that he did not, perhaps, enjoy fame and adulation as much Draco had used to think, the way Draco would have in his position. That whole world-saving bit had likewise come to seem less attention-seeking, and more like genuine attempts at heroism, of which publicity was a
Potter didn't flee. Either Draco wasn't intimidating after all, or Gryffindor foolishness was keeping him there regardless, staring him in the eye until Draco was the one to flee, not caring about Potter hearing the Slytherin password. "Snakewood!" Draco barked, charging without a look back, and sprinted through the common room not caring what any of them thought of his flight. He pushed past Vince and Greg, who saw his face and hurried out of the dorms at once, and flung himself into bed, spelled the curtains closed and quiet, and grabbed Imoogi before he began to shake, not crying but panting, with all the panic dry and scraping, breathless and beyond control. He threw his wand beside his pillow where it stayed when he slept, which gave off the illusion it was trembling too.
Potter went on until the point where he could not go any longer without implicating Luna. Draco wondered why Potter was looking at him of all people, until he remembered he had claimed he was her cousin. Well, they hadn't expelled Ginny Weasley...
Hermione also seemed to like Luna's present, a volume of Greek Muggle mythology. She seemed tempted to dive into it rather than dance, but her partygoers dragged her to the dance floor. Except then a slow song was first. She and Ron jumped back from each other like they both had the plague, sidling back to their seats. "Come on, Cannon, go dance with the birthday girl, someone's got to," Draco hissed in his ear, and Ron shuddered.
"Is everything alright with my parents?" Hermione asked, with an edge in her voice that showed the unspoken motive for living elsewhere: fear they would fall victim to the other side. Quaint, having parents one feared would get hurt, rather than hurt
That brief grim answer gave Draco a possible additional motive for Harry's avoidance, apart from the events after the Third Task. He'd promised Harry he would give him a godfather, gift him a real home and family. Now it must feel like Draco had stolen them for himself, as if the brand of thief  had been taken off Draco's palm somewhat precipitously. Draco would understand that resentment very well.
Then Draco's eyes focused and it was who it obviously was, who he should have known from every dream would be waiting here, only here, to bring matters to their natural close:
going to seek vengeance against Neville for his plant. As you can see, my hair is as glorious as ever-"
All the other girls laughed, none too nicely. "Luna, we've heard about Malfoy. He's famous at Hogwarts. He's a great wizard already. He's friends with Harry Potter. He's got a
"Of course," Severus said, pinching the bridge of his nose anew. "Of course my godson, in his infinite wisdom, has chosen to trust the most important information he has ever had the misfortune to learn, to Hermione Granger
Bill snorted, glancing between Draco and Sirius's still-smoking hand. "Yeah, don't know how anyone could have gotten that idea..."
That pulled Gilderoy back on task, somehow. "Alright, Miss Granger, where are these poor parents of yours? I promise, my dear, if there is one charm I'm qualified to perform, it's this. It will all be fine."
"You know what I want," Harry said miserably, staring at Draco's mouth, and the heat inside Draco was almost stifling, sensitivity already rising over his skin without even being touched. He could feel how hard his nipples were in the night air, could see Harry's eyes keep going to them like he wanted to put his fingers or his teeth on them, even with all of Draco cast into alabaster pallor by the pale blue wreath of light over their heads. "You've known, haven't you? You have, you just like to torment me... and last night, Draco..."
"But you're planning to use this to get an unfair advantage," she hissed, "Something to give Slytherin an edge over Gryffindor." She said that like it was a
Crouch was an unpleasant, blustering sort, and he looked even more taken aback than Bagman to find a green-haired Malfoy at the Weasley fire, let alone the green-haired girl Draco introduced as his cousin. He only had the small amusing merit of referring to Peter as 'Weatherby'. He alluded to the Triwizard Tournament, but refused to give anything away, nor did Mr. Weasley or Peter, who called it classified information that Crouch had been 'quite right not to disclose'.
"Why are you laughing?" Ginny asked suspiciously, and took the sheet from Hermione, only to gasp and grab onto Luna. "He's been having us on! He got all Os! All of them!"
there, to survive for much longer. And if he does, Hogwarts will need a place to flee to. You've been rebuilding the citadel as
The shine of Seguinus Sade must have distinctly faded. Although from incidental detail in Lockhart's stories, Draco could glean that the man's residence had continued to be
Harry's detentions did impact him, though, by putting him immediately behind on all his homework. The pre-OWL load seemed too much for him already. Draco offered the unthinkable, and wrote his Potions essay on moonstones for him. He took great effort with Harry's ugly handwriting, finding the Falsifingus spell to transform his writing to it, and he made sure to copy Harry's tone and intellectual deficiencies as best he could. He thought it could fool even Severus. And if Severus detected the cheating, he never called them out on it.
Luna's blue eyes focused on him. "My favorite cousin. He's clever," she said unhesitatingly, "And brave and strong and true. And sweet and lovely and wonderful-"
"Professor McGonagall!" Draco exclaimed. "Professor McGonagall, come here! Professor McGonagall helped me! I kept it a secret, but I had to ask her help. She helped me with the transfiguration, a lot, with the research and the spells. I couldn't have managed it at all without her."
Hermione was right. They'd already been high in the castle, and it wasn't hard to convince a tipsy Draco and Luna they should swing by the seventh floor. They'd be leaving tomorrow, and the thought of finding the Mirror of Erised would obsess Draco's sober self, if he had to wait until the end of winter break to look. So they followed, Luna singing Expecting your Patronum in a lovely soprano- not the stealthiest of enterprises- and Hermione paced before the entrance. When the door opened, they came out into that cavernous room of forgotten things where Draco had destroyed the vanishing cabinet. The Mirror of Erised loomed near the entrance, under a ceiling that made even this massive mirror look small.
did. I know you'd invented loads and loads by the time you were my age, but I'm going to make more-"
she would need to be dragged out of, that Neville seemed to become more civic-minded. "I should, um, Vanish all these flowers, or move them," he said sheepishly, and raised his voice. "Erm, Ravenclaw, I'm sorry, I'll go and get rid of the flowers now-"
"What was behind him?" Draco was staring at the talon wand in his own lap, fixed on the bend as if that was the precise location Dantanian lived. As if Dantanian could tell him differently than what Grindelwald was surely about to tell him. As if Dantanian could shield Draco from what he should have known already.
"What Ron means to say," Draco said with forceful clarity, "Is that he'd love to go to the Christmas party with you. Isn't that right, Ron?"
! In that stupid article!" Draco would have tried to be moved by this show of loyalty, now that he and Ginny were technically friends. If it wasn't coming at the most inconvenient time.
"I was planning to take those, Herbology, Astronomy, Arithmancy, and Ancient Runes. That should cover most career bases, right?"
Draco felt very good about life, the plight of the three cursed slanderers far from his mind, as he cleaned up afterwards in the broomshed, having sent Harry on. Ostensibly, he wanted to clean his broomstick, though an objective party might note that Harry had already done that for him. Unofficially, after what they'd done, he needed to fix his hair.
that, right?" Harry breathed. "Fred, George, you shouldn't have done that, though, his hand- and you don't know how long it will last-"
Blaise sat down on Draco's bed, Vince and Greg hovering behind with expressions like they might have to try and defend Blaise soon, while not particularly wanting to. "I haven't said a word to anyone, even my mother, but it hasn't
"Booklists have arrived," said Ron, coming in and throwing them their envelopes, with the twins following. They began to gossip with Harry about the Defense textbooks listed, meaning there would be a new Defense professor. Draco wished he could tell them they wouldn't be so happy when they found out who it was. He opened his envelope wider to look for his prefect badge. It had come with this letter in the blue loop, though Father had found out and told him weeks sooner.
"I'm not sure anymore, though," Draco blurted, and felt tears threaten at the mere idea, the impotent frustration of
They walked into the Three Broomsticks together at noon sharp in high spirits, Neville finally talked into some semblance of confidence by Draco's insistence they repeat the mantra,
They came upon the Gryffindors straining to see the announcement as well, and Ron seemed smug upon hearing Luna's prediction. "You see," he said with a sneer at Hermione, "If Cedric Diggory does get chosen, he'll put Hogwarts in the crapper, you'll see. Just because he's
Dobby confined himself to describing Luna's swollen eyes, and the moderate but worrying description of, "Luna Lovegood was not her usual self."
"Yes, Granger, you have successfully demonstrated your ability to read," Draco interrupted with a groan. "Congratulations."
Remus had said he would move another bed to Draco's spacious room to share it if he wanted, though there would be enough rooms anyway. Draco lost interest in the idea, though, when he found out they wouldn't let him have Hermione up there. No matter how many times he tried to argue that he was gay, Remus remained adamant that she shouldn't have to share a room with a boy for her sake. So both she and Ron would be getting their own rooms downstairs.
?" But the hook of being on the air on the actual Hogwarts Quidditch pitch again, for the first time since she had called herself one of the Kingsnakes, proved enough to keep her hovering beside him.
He put the talon wand in his side pocket, stroking its bent shape, remembering Crouch staring at it and telling him,
After hours perfecting the curse for Finnigan, the rest couldn't have been easier. Draco hid behind one of the pillars in the Transfiguration courtyard, a concealment the size of his 11-year-old body made effortless. Eventually, the Gryffindors emerged from, ironically enough, the temporary classroom for Defense Against the Dark Arts, letting the odor of garlic out into the courtyard. Draco's eyes fastened on Potter, flanked by Weasley and Granger, and felt a flash of temptation, but then his original plan came up behind Potter. Dean Thomas was consoling Draco's target with an arm around his shoulder, but not entwined enough to fear hitting the wrong boy.
"I don't know," Draco said, wiping his nose, "I've been working on it since June," and Severus's eyes hardened, all the more when Draco added, "I'm sorry, I know it's stupid- it's just that her birthday is
, but he pushed that aside. "You all shouldn't either! Yeah, all those people out there at the bus, they think you're losers. Maybe the pundits and prognosticators all think you're losers. Maybe your own supporters think you're losers!"
"I overheard Mr. and Mrs. Weasley talking," Potter said, scooting closer once Draco sat up. "Apparently everyone in the Ministry knows- is that how you know? Did your father hear too?"
"Correct," McGonagall said, "And yet not. You say yourself that the past for this hero is the same up to 22. So why are they different colors? Is not the past for the red line blue?" She tapped her wand, and the red line tilted to affix its end to blue at 22. "What you make of this?"
Draco's twelve-year-old throwing arm could use some work. Drills tossing Quaffles back and forth left him with sore biceps, and a sore ego at how much shorter he could throw than anyone else. Being twelve had its advantages, though, when it came to the Beater portion of the tryouts, when he and Higgs along with all the Chasers but Flint served as targets for them to show off throwing prowess, with a side bonus the proof of agility the rest of them could give. Flint watched above with a critical eye Draco could feel heavy on him. It was even odds whether that eye would be more critical for Draco, or too terrified to treat him as a normal tryout at all.
"They're tied to the Hallows," Draco interrupted, "To the Resurrection Stone. Have you ever heard anything like that, sir?"
Neville shrugged. "Dean was bummed you won't be there to talk about football with, and you'll still be banned from our common room." Harry's eyes widened as if he hadn't yet registered that further injury. "But I do think he's happy you won't be hanging up any Arsenal posters next to his West Ham ones."
"Keeping us from being interrupted," Draco said, and stared at the dirty blond hair over Potter's forehead, falling over his pillow. He'd had Theo in his bed more than a few times in the Slytherin dorms, but in later years. And it was disturbingly easy to picture this familiar sandy hair now as unrulier and darker. "We can't have that, can we?"
Potter wasn't dead, but you wouldn't have known it from the chaos that erupted on that patch of grass, in the midst of the wailings and lamentations of those who genuinely seemed to believe Potter was fallen for good.
He didn't know the words for Dantanian Noir. He had thought those anomalous words just a designation for mysterious castle-builder Dantanian Black, or else a code for a person possessed by pure and unadulterated evil. The man whose memories Severus had gone to so much trouble to hide from Draco, he seemed to be something else entirely. Which was in its own way more frightening. But Draco would be damned if he would show it hurt him. Whether or not Severus had been in any way right to keep this from him, Draco would
The other boys exchanged glances. None of them put their wands back, which left Draco the only one with his still in his pocket. It put him on edge, but he kept it that way. Merlin, it was hard to play the diplomat. "It's not that," Theo said slowly, taking the lead when it seemed no one else had the nerve. "I don't think they'd be upset.
"Crouch told me to use any means necessary to get Harry Potter to meet me alone with the Triwizard Cup, activate the Portkey, and send him to the graveyard. Crouch said to obey anything he or the Dark Lord or any Death Eaters told me," Draco recited blankly.
"The Heir of Slytherin," said McGonagall, who was very white, "Left another message. Right underneath the first one. 'Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever.'"
"You're in for a rough night," Madam Pomfrey had told him, pouring out a steaming beakerful and handing it to him. "Regrowing bones is a nasty business."
Draco leaned back with false insouciance, while the sound of fireworks went on and on, like the voice of an outside world that could not be appeased. "Go on telling yourself that," he drawled. "Though it might help with the begging that you ought to have already launched upon for my help, to acknowledge that if it weren't for your status as an Animagus-
"The wand I use was my aunt's," Draco admitted, "Bellatrix Lestrange," and then he could see Neville understood from the way he jerked back. Not necessarily from Draco, but the wand itself, as if something dark and horrible had suddenly hissed into the room, a malevolent ghost that
Draco inclined his broom low, whipping through the trees fast enough that the leaves slapped his face, and kept yelling in panic for Sirius to hold on. He nearly dropped Sirius when he had to flip in the air, executing a barrel roll at the last second to avoid a hanging branch as the air seemed to go wet and freeze closer and closer behind them. "You fly just like James," Sirius said, voice hazy as if in a dream, and then there was a slamming sound behind them, and an agonized cry.
Yes, definitely one well-trained in the ceremony of blood rituals, that one, unfortunately for his sake. But this one was at least to demand no more of his blood, only the vial of water that he had carefully upended into the pool of blood.
Under other circumstances, Draco would have had to laugh seeing Father so flabbergasted. That was a face like one of their house elves had just stolen his wand and started breezily attempting the Cruciatus curse against him.
He remembered Harry's face that past New Year's Eve, watching Neville with the Longbottoms after Draco restored them. Harry hadn't argued, when Draco had said, this is what you saw in the Mirror of Erised, your heart's deepest desire, just for someone else. But this- if this still wasn't James and Lily Potter themselves, it was as close as you could get. "You're going to be such amazing parents," Draco said, voice thick and catching, eyes still shut. "You're going to take him from the Dursleys-" Draco remembered that nightmare of the cupboard, inside Harry's head, truly just a nightmare now. "You're going to love him the way he deserves."
"I only gave that bloody interview to try and look like I was totally against you. To keep up my cover after I
be. You used Lockhart as a cautionary tale, and let him slip away once he'd served his purpose. Fine. Machiavellian, but fine. Except now, I think he can be
year, when he was so alone and Myrtle was still the only one who could talk to- Theo had just wanted to stick his prick in him and run-
Hermione turned to Potter with a severe gaze. "Harry," she said, sounding as if she was reciting from a textbook she had consulted on the subject, "I don't think Draco is
"Honestly, Harry, I didn't need to go into your mind for that," Draco said, wincing, "You're just not a good liar. I could read your face. It's easier with two options only, though. Let's try something harder, okay?" He slid off the arm of Harry's chair, taking the pebble with him.
"This is not a game." Dorian glowered as Lamia. "And I don't hear a denial there. I think I've got it, haven't I! You gave yourself away last year, mentioning the Department of Mysteries, and experiments!"
The red light of Expelliarmus flew at him. Draco dropped to the floor beside his father just in time, face hitting his shaking arm stripped of its hand.
"It's only fair, Harry," Draco laughed, tilting his head and giving him a teasing smirk as he smoothed the tie down. "You're always putting me in mine."
Once he was fully back in the water, thankfully not too long for the sake of Draco's sanity, Myrtle told them, "Go on, then... open it under the water!"
But all too soon Ron and Potter had to go away in a knot of Gryffindors, and Draco in a knot of Slytherins. For a few bizarre moments, Draco actually found himself wishing he'd asked the hat to sort him Gryffindor. If that had ever really been a possibility.
! We had a duel, fair and square! And I didn't do too bad! I held my own for a while! I'm not some helpless child, I can defend myself-"
They were together again in the next memory, sitting down together at a nearly-full Ravenclaw table. Most of the children were milling around excitedly, catching up on their summers apart and running around, while a new crop of first-years waited up front nervously for another Sorting. But a second-year Dantanian and Lamia sat at the most distance available from any other students, and the students in turn gave them a wide berth, though all their stares of hostility seemed towards Lamia. Dantanian seemed unnoticed, beside a girl they clearly seemed to regard as a dangerous freak by now. That dangerous freak was currently doing the nefarious dark work of giving her friend a present, a large parcel of old newspapers.
Blaise and Theo exchanged looks. "We didn't feel like it, Draco. But, uh, Crabbe and Goyle are still going out to play," Blaise mumbled, which sent up red flags in Draco's head for countless reasons, chiefly among which were A. Blaise usually called them Vince and Greg, B. Blaise had been the one to propose the game, and C. Vince and Greg weren't exactly capable of carrying out a Quidditch match on their lonesome.
"I don't have time to explain," Weasley hissed, and looked around furtively. "Listen, can you meet me here in half an hour? It's easier if I just show you." Draco nodded, picked up his book, and tore his way down to the Slytherin dungeons. Even while he knew he was being ridiculous, he cast an expanding charm on his bag and began to pack.
skilled into getting into places you wouldn't think he'd belong. Or fit. "Oh, no, have I displeased the great dread prefect of Slytherin House? Look, Dobby, Theo is impatient for me to
"Oh, that's awful, they shouldn't have these gross things on the telly. Don't look at this, Dudders," Petunia said, coming over to pull Dudley's face away, but he was transfixed.
So Draco had officially fucked up by giving Neville the green light to ask out Luna. He didn't think Neville would have been at all aggressive or nasty at taking the rejection. So he had to assume it was something else about the asking, or the Yule Ball, or something he didn't know about. But it was maddening not to know. Ever since he'd found Luna alabaster-white and cold in the Chamber of Secrets thanks to his alterations of the blue line, he had felt responsible for her, in a way that made his skin crawl when he didn't have any idea where she was.
Lupin watched him for a long moment, and Draco thought uncomfortably how he'd perhaps proved without a doubt that Lupin was right. But he could not be defenseless before Dementors, never again, so he held his stare as if he had no compunctions at all about blackmailing one of his professors.
Maybe Pomfrey had given him something to make it hurt worse, growing back the bones for this infamous Slytherin, or maybe there was something in the come-down from the Draught of Peace, or the aftermath of the explosion he had caused in Severus's chambers, or else some combination. But mentally listing options in his head had none of its usual comforting effect. He could make himself feel no more in control when his very
"You missed a lot when you left me at the gala," Lamia told Dantanian, as she came up behind him in the Owlery. Their faces were flushed enough, and their bodies covered in enough layers, it was definitely still cold. And the Owlery at Hogwarts could get very cold indeed, in the heart of winter. "I bet you'd be curious about some of the things I saw and you didn't."
"Okay," Luna said. "Expelliarmus!" Draco's wand flew neatly towards her, and she stopped it in the air rather than touch it. As Draco had suspected, she was already beyond the magical level of this club, at least at the start. Draco was as well, and the hardest thing for either of them was just making sure Luna remembered not to touch Draco's wand.
"Lucius," Dumbledore said calmly, "If you will not be wanting the diary back, I believe you have no further business at Hogwarts. A pleasure seeing you as always."
The good thing about having established himself in past years as an antisocial pillock was that no one expected him to chat or do anything but spell his curtains shut and silent, upon which no one could see how speedily he drifted to sleep.
The rest of that Saturday was no less of a test of Draco's patience. Hagrid was beside himself when they visited him after tryouts, only for them to find out it was over Aragog dying. They had to feign concern and sympathy, though Draco felt more like throwing a private festivity at the news.
"Always so eager to show off your knowledge, Draco," Severus sighed. "Becoming a know-it-all like your Gryffindor sweetheart? One hopes you do not behave as such in your other classes." Hardly. Draco still spoke as little as possible, both to avoid drawing attention to himself, and because he found it added to his mystique with the other students. "Yes, Draco, shields. I have already begun the preparation of a multi-layered shield bubble around the fireplace, with a rune to verbally activate it, once the flame is infused with liquid Fiendfyre." A flick of Severus's wand and a low muttering, and Draco found his face surrounded by a sort of envelope in the air. "A bubble-head charm. We will both use them, in case of poisonous fumes escaping the shields. Now, Draco, I am allowing you to witness this as a privilege, for the action you took in bringing the diary initially to our attention. But if you feel yourself at all unready to witness such a dangerous procedure..."
Just the thought of the Room of Requirement, even if the dueling room shouldn't be so bad, was enough to make Draco almost instinctively say no. Not to mention the need not to be in small closed spaces alone with Harry, and the fact that dueling was dangerous-
"Yes," Hermione said intently, conviction shining from her pretty brown eyes. She smiled when she saw Dumbledore reach under the defense's stand and produce Mr. Wilberforth's case.
"Brave indeed, Mr. Black," Dumbledore said with that glimmer of irony. "And not over-keen on self-preservation. Not so much the Ravenclaw as the Gryffindor." It was hard not to think back then to the Hat telling Draco he would never belong in Gryffindor.
Please inform Father that whatever he may have been told of the Quidditch incident with Harry Potter, he has been misinformed if he was not also told that Potter was the instigator of it all, due to the prompting of his friend the blood traitor Ronald Weasley, who hates our family, speaks ill of Father personally, and seeks our disgrace along with his entire family, perhaps to the point of spreading some of these false rumors. I can assure you I am most well-respected in Slytherin, and my classmates often look to me as an example.
those?" Harry hissed, grabbing onto Draco's arm rather than getting into a stagecoach with the others. He'd already seemed disconcerted by the absence of Hagrid guiding the first-years, though Draco had assured him he'd be back soon enough in, oh, maybe November or so...
Neither Dantanian nor Taylor blinked at that statement, despite Dantanian's visible youth. The midday air had a pleasant, almost gilded haze around them. The sounds of dragontamers nearby, all in leather that matched theirs, was one of uncomplicated happiness. The Opaleyes, some dozens or even a hundred of them, all seemed well-cared for, and docile as could be.
Grindelwald's tired lips creased up into a smile, and his hand fell from his side. The cut into his side extended all the way up, and into his chest.
When Severus tried to send Draco off right away, to clear out dust from the remnants of the castle's great hall, Gilderoy protested, claiming there was no point to putting a wizard of Draco's talents to brute busywork. "Can the
Palmer didn't seem to dare go closer. "You aren't dressed like a guard. And you don't look like one."
"Of course, you aren't just a charitable man, are you, Minister Fudge?" Draco simpered, and waited for Mother and Father to get distracted chatting with the Bulgarian Minister before launching his real offensive. "I've heard you're quite the sporting man as well. You must have a uniquely prescient take on events to come."
"He's not even good-looking!" Hermione said once, making Draco wince from knowing how differently Viktor thought about her. "They only like him because he's famous! They wouldn't look twice at him if he couldn't do that Wonky Faint thing-"
Both of Draco's arms wrapped around Potter desperately to hold on as the broom hurtled forward, the marked arm clinging as tight as the unmarked one.
Their wands were vibrating. Draco had known nothing of this, had no idea what was happening, only knew it was something other than Harry's death. He jerked his bound body from his father's and threw him off, crawling only to slip and fall face-first into the corpse of Wormtail...
"Forgive me," Ollivander said with that pinched look on his face Draco remembered from last time. "But I remember that wand quite well. The most logical explanation, outlandish as it might sound, is that your wand is jealous, and is acting to keep you from entering the place where it could be replaced in your affections. Perhaps if you tried letting your mother hold your wand..."
. It made Draco's skin crawl, thinking something could have gone wrong, maybe with one of their friends. "Potter, what are you doing here?" Draco asked, trying to keep his cool. "I have detention with Moody."
"It's seven am," Luna said, and opened the shed, staring out at the sun nearly up, the pink glow turning to a fuller gold over the towering green hedges. "Twelve hours, Severus said?"
you. Just be careful," Theo said finally, getting up. His frame blocked the chill of the wind, for that moment. "Be careful, Draco. That's all I ask. Just- just remember that there will always be things you don't know."
"Don't you?" Grindelwald's eyes went keen, searching. "Is that your decision? How personally disappointing."
An unnecessary sacrifice, just because you weren't willing to let the piece know all the ways it was capable of moving."
"You don't use a second, though," Ron said, and Draco just smirked. "What? Who are you gonna ask? Harry? Hermione? Nott?" Draco kept smirking mysteriously, and Ron's eyes widened in horror. "
Severus seemed to see. "Draco, you're becoming hysterical. You don't even know what you're saying anymore."
Harry looked a mess, dark hair indeed in its most post-Quidditch-like state of disarray, and his beautiful green eyes distant and almost unseeing upon the charges beside him. Some of the children waved and called out to Harry, clearly taking heart in both the protection by and the safety of the Boy Who Lived, and anyone who knew Harry well could see how mechanically he returned the gestures of the Creeveys of the world.
"Apologies, sir," Draco said, widening his grey eyes cutely at him, before turning his young cute face all around the courtroom to show his undaunted conviction in his own innocence. "I was just trying to answer Miss Umbridge's question whether I was the Heir of Slytherin. And whether the Ministry thought I was. I should think not, given that another man was arrested and falsely imprisoned without trial in Azkaban for it, but I suppose that's not uncommon..."
"The Dark Lord has placed you in command here?" Severus asked tersely, and Bellatrix gave a smug nod. "As you wish," he hissed, and stalked towards Harry and Draco.
"It's fine, sir," Draco said, mortified to be caught fraternizing with a boy Severus disliked so much, and rushed to flee the scene of the crime, only to see the stare Potter was giving Severus. It was one that didn't belong to this young Potter, and one far more resentful than just interrupting his conversation warranted. Draco was reminded of the suspicions Granger had voiced about Severus, and could tell their probable source from that look.
"An interesting riddle, Mr. Malfoy. Let us say the blue thread is the original, until the point that time traveler's mind departs that timeline, and the red timeline is the new timeline that begins in the moment the traveler's mind reenters its body at an earlier age." McGonagall tapped her wand and an eraser reformed into a small, cute pink figure of a person. "Do you understand?"
He was one of the most important followers of the Dark Lord. They were called Death Eaters." She recited merciless facts like nothing but trivia from a book. To her, they still were. "I don't know why."
"I'm sorry, Draco," Harry said earnestly, and looked very handsome and noble, and yet his face had never looked more punchable. "I'm glad you want me to win the cup so much. But some things are more important than winning."
The years had passed, with Lockhart the one human ever alive for long at Castell de L'Infern. In this rather high-octane study abroad experience, Lockhart had learned decent amounts of Catalan, Spanish, French, and a number of spells related to castle-building, as well as closing wounds. This repertoire of necessity was narrow but potent. It included powerful-sounding animation spells. The most interesting was a variant on Piertotum Locomotor called Piertotum Corporestitur, which for rebuilding a castle allowed the caster to direct the armor and statues- or, say, perhaps,
falling. A shield sprang up around Draco, without his wand even having to make it out of his pocket. The opal pendant floated before him in the soot-blackened air, glowing a mottled green, and held back the fall of the rubble, while Harry was battered underneath it.
"Hermione!" Draco yelled across the road, drawing stares. "Don't leave me here!" He clutched his suitcase to him, fearful the stream of ambulatory Muggles behind him would not make a path to let him through either, even if he tried to get back to the Leaky Cauldron and flee to the Wizarding world where he belonged, only reasonably so in face of this cacophonous juggernaut.
Draco's brow creased. "I don't know. Pretty well? I keep waiting for the guilt to kick in, and it just hasn't. I'm guiltier I didn't do it
Draco had expected some form of remonstration from the headmaster, when the Portkey took him into his office. Especially after his eyes went instinctually to where Phineas Black's portrait had been. The painting was not yet removed, but it was just an empty landscape now. Even then, Dumbledore just told him mildly, "It is good to see you well again, Mr. Black."
"I know," was all Draco said instead, voice coming out small and weak. The foreknowledge of everything she would be to Potter went through him and left him pathetically bleak.
Draco tried to avoid Potter before the match as much as possible, using the guise that he was angry on Hermione's behalf for their childish behavior over the cat and rat. But he did still get questioned as to whether he would be watching the match, like Potter always seemed to get around to asking him. Draco played it off with his usual coolness. "I don't know, Potter," he drawled. "Depends on what else is going on. Come off it, don't make that face, you know full well from the lessons how useless I'd be to protect you, should Dementors come for you again."
It seemed to be the answer Luna had wanted, scared as she was. She peeked up at him with trepidation but a growing nerve in her pretty blue eyes. "Promise me?"
There was an eruption of consternation and disgust from the Death Eaters. But Draco didn't let their gazes part. And finally, Harry nodded. If he wouldn't have been convinced already, he had to feel the wand that had gone into his pocket. "Alright, Draco. For you."
The rest was as the newspapers told, with Lockhart's habit of self-aggrandizing a distant memory. Maybe the results of bragging about castle-building skills had helped beat out some of his taste for it. If anything, Lockhart made himself sound
Draco let out a muffled cry, a grunt and then groan as his body dropped fully to the bed, feeling in his legs gone almost numb. Even once his body was his own, he felt aftershocks at every nerve, most of all at the tip, where Harry's fingers were touching.
Except she hadn't touched his wand. Just a quill he'd cursed. Unless there had been something more in that ritual he'd done from the Hecate book to get into her office... but it had been easy, and he hadn't felt drained after it at all, energized if anything...
"When we arrived in the castle," Maria Alba explains, "They told Gilderoy to look after us until they needed our blood. They hit him when he asked why they brought children. He had fang marks on his arms, and he seemed terrified, so I didn't think he could help us. But he found a way."
"You can do whatever you want with your hair," Harry said, an objectively laudable statement, and just about the last thing Draco wanted to hear out of those lips.
"I would tell you anything," Draco blurted, tears threatening to come despite the warning, if not of panic yet. Almost worse than embarrassing respiratory problems would have been, though, was the awareness that he might be
The Antipodean Opaleye sprung out of Draco's wand fully-formed and ready, sweeping out instantly to soar at the Dementors that were circling around Harry. Draco watched Astaroth fly with the feeling of a nightmare, unable to believe something so terrible had really happened, before he moved his leaden feet again, breath short but still moving. He raced towards Harry, ready to get him to safety away from the Dementors if it was the last thing he did.
That smile didn't last long once he was back amongst the children of Hogwarts, who talked of nothing but the attack on this person apparently called Creevey. Given how Draco had been seen snapping at Creevey, while he took pictures over his injured body, the pitch of suspicion against Draco seemed to have increased. Nor did it help that Draco had not been in his second-year dorm, but alone in the hospital wing, since it wasn't like Draco could have Dobby march out to tell them he'd been in attendance. It was bad timing for him to have to reappear at meals, but at least that gave him the appearance of less to hide.
After a minute, most of Ravenclaw joined tepidly. Then most of the DA members did, though Draco could only imagine Harry's consternation. Draco might have been upset too, if it had seemed Gryffindor was ever a possibility for the blasted hat.
in the construction of Xaphan, with the almost suspicious speed of Gilderoy's rebuilding perhaps aided by architectural and structural similarities with
mad," he said for the hundredth time, almost sounding as if he meant it. But that didn't seem enough of an impediment to keep him from leaning in and stealing a kiss anyway, a shock of reassuring warmth that had Draco gripping onto Harry's shoulders. He tried to ground himself in the increasingly familiar feeling of those addictive lips, the brush of Harry's nose and his glasses' round frames, the tug of his hands in his hair...
After Draco got his instructions, he walked back to the castle in dazed contentment, something like the Felix Felicis but without its edge.
The Firebolt apparently also constituted Draco's birthday present from Sirius and Remus, so nothing new there. And Hermione got Draco a Muggle book called
But that did not change the fact that everyone knew Draco was unequivocally the killer of at least one Death Eater now, probably assuming Pettigrew too in retrospect. And anyone who had looked at reports of Father's maiming might also have suspicions there, though Father had refused to speak of who had done it, before being taken unceremoniously off to Azkaban...
Severus looked to mistake Gilderoy's reluctance as from a darker source, given whatever he knew of the history there. "Gilderoy," he said more softly, corner of his mouth turning up ruefully. He slid to his feet, voice of an unfathomable gentleness. "A jest. I have no intention of frightening you." He told Gilderoy, "You should know that I would never hurt you."
"Someday," Draco said with a helpless grin, "I'm going to tell him you call him that, and that will be the end of you, Luna Lovegood."
"The secrets of Xaphan, clearly," Grindelwald scoffed, but seemed rapidly less hysterical. "How long until it returns? Whether or not I can use it at the moment, the feeling of its absence- you can't know-"
"Send him all the poems you want!" Draco exclaimed, and this was why Hermione should have been the one consulted. "If he's ungrateful, I'll castrate the whiny bitch!"
Dobby nodded, and then looked around shiftily. "Dobby thinks he is fine. Dobby has to finish with something in the kitchen quickly. Dobby will just be a second."
first got to Hogwarts, he couldn't stand being around people, but he made friends with one brainy girl- Hermione- who was one outcast Ravenclaw, from a strange pureblood family,
"Do I seem like I could do that now, much less as an infant? Let alone kill a skilled pyromancer. The prophecy didn't specify who the flames would come
"Um, Luna, I have to tell you something," Draco said, halting in the middle of the corridor and helping brace her against one of the handholds. The sound of rain outside was picking up. "Before we get to the Gryffindors. Listen, I should have told you before..." She tilted her face up at him with that placidity that was not quite trust, and he steeled himself before admitting, "We're not really cousins. I just made that up when you were the one in the Chamber of Secrets, to make everyone try harder to help you. I'm sorry I lied to you."
"Fine. Let's make a bet," Weasley said. "If we're right, and Snape really is after the Stone, then what should we ask for, Harry?"
sign from her boyfriend's hands, and kiss the handsome cheering face behind it, falling off her broom into his lap. The knot of the other Slytherins flew a victory lap as Jordan called out the final score, 240-20 to Slytherin.
But the tackiness was hardly the main problem. Mainly, it was the fact that every one of those baubles had a picture of Harry's face on them, like the worst kind of spoiled potion-fueled Yule nightmare, with the words HAVE A VERY HARRY CHRISTMAS! written below every face.
father never hurt me," Theo said more quietly, the pain in his eyes threatening to brim over, before calculation returned to them. "And you... what are you doing with that dagger, Draco Malfoy? I know you get off on blood magic. Whose blood was left on that dagger? Are you targeting Bellatrix Lestrange? Your father?
They waited at the Pensieve, a silent stand-off, until Draco's impatience got the best of him. "Fine!" He made a show of casting, "Evanesca Catenata!" He had a brief flash of ruefulness, as he felt the invisible links to himself dissipate, wondering how stupid he had been to destroy them for real. But he wanted the vial too badly, and he was afraid that if he tried to fake it, Severus would know, and then he never would-
The only ill effect of the telly was drawing the attention of Nymphadora Tonks as well, whose father was a Muggleborn. She was often about, as a member of the Order and one of the many on rotation guarding Harry. But Draco avoided her as much as possible, confining himself to polite distantness, in the face of her careless bits of friendliness. Let her think him a normal snobbish Malfoy, spurning his slightly more disgraced kin. As far as he had been told, neither she nor any of the Order save Sirius, Remus, and Severus had connected Draco to the mysterious hooded figure that had fought against the Aurors using Dark Magic outside Grimmauld. Draco wanted to keep it that way, joint television watching notwithstanding.
Harry relaxed at Draco's lack of horror, like back in third-year, whenever Draco told him it was normal to feel as he did about Dementors. Merlin, Harry had far too many awful things happen to him to also be this hard on himself. "I... you think so?"
. Do what you want to me, but don't hurt Dantanian. Let him live, he doesn't know who we are, he doesn't know about our blood. He just thinks his name is Dante. Dantanian, Dantanian..." Memory seemed not as gratifying to him as it might have been, for a more enthusiastic killer. "So eventually I gave in, and promised her I'd let you live."
Twenty-five points was generous. Draco would have given her zero. In real life, there was no in-between. Either you saved someone or you didn't.
"No harm, no harm. I want him to know, I did let Death Eaters in. The Chamber happened to have a secret escape route out of Hogwarts. Your aunt Bellatrix has been through here already. So have all of her compatriots. So has Dark Lord himself. He walks the floors of Hogwarts above you as we speak, the halls where your friends wait for him." Theo's lips finally crooked up into a smile. "See, I told you I would say where your cousin was. She's up there in Hogwarts, for the Dark Lord to kill."
"Draco," Remus said, putting their breakfast trays aside with his voice choked in agitation, "Is that how you are used to having your guardians punish you? With beatings?"
"Okay, fine. You'd better hold still." Harry took pains to do so with the least actual blood liberated possible. When Harry cut him, it hurt less than a paper cut.
"But they did," Draco said, a bile coming to his throat different from that for Severus, however personal that betrayal. "He lived a long life, didn't he? There's a painting of him in Dumbledore's office."
But Slughorn had to come sidling up in the Great Hall, inviting them to some ghastly Slug Club dinner instead. Draco had wanted so badly to get into that deranged little personal cult in the blue loop, and now he wanted little more than to get out of it. But he'd committed to this ruddy dinner. He hadn't had a choice but to humor Slughorn to get what he needed: a note for the Restricted Section, which, he knew from Severus, the other teachers at Hogwarts had long since been advised not to give Draco. After that implicit deal earlier in the week, Draco already had ten, count them, ten books on Grindelwald and related topics back in his trunk in Ravenclaw. The trade had been sleazily transparent when he spoke to Slughorn for permission. If he ever wanted the same privilege from Slughorn again, he had to play ball with the Slug Club.
-preserved in comparison to the area immediately outside the observatory, as if some spells had kept everything preserved but for the natural floating of dust. "It looks barren, I know. But I think this is what Xaphan was built
" Flint was calling, and then had grabbed the Snitch from Draco's unmoving hand. "Look, Madam Hooch! Malfoy caught the Snitch! It's over! We won!"
But the Dementor seemed to be too much for him initially, and Lupin was pushing him forward. "Draco, think of the happiest memory you can and attempt the incantation."
. Except then Sirius shied back from him, and Draco had to call outside. "Severus, you have to take off the enchantment!"
Before the shattering gave way to nothing, he heard the sound of the cracking glass, louder than it should have been for the charm, turn to a lilting melody, like a lullaby. Something, perhaps, a bit like the incantation Severus had hummed to heal Draco after Potter cut him open on the floor.
So he had accomplished his goal, with no one the wiser. Harry never even asked him what he'd needed the invisibility cloak for. When he returned it, he was more interested in grilling Draco on the new Slytherin line-up. Bizarrely enough, he claimed to have followed Draco's orders this time not to spy on his Quidditch practices, which almost hurt Draco's feelings. Didn't Harry fancy him at
"Well... that's the plan, anyway," said Hermione. "If you want to join us, we need to decide how we're going to-"
And that was a comfort, that even if Draco had somehow led the savior and his best friend to death like lambs to the slaughter, at least somewhere above them soon, Hermione would be waking up.
He held up his left wrist, sleeve slipping to expose the Dark Mark, and looked at it displayed on his own skin with dispassionate contempt.
"Yes it is!" Harry protested, grabbing Draco's hand, and Draco wished that Grimmauld had some special debilitating House Black gaping maw curse, which would cause the old house elf heads to sneak down chomping to swallow up residents down into the floorboards beneath.
- that confirms every theory I have had, so thank you for that. Within the threshold of a portal, I'd imagine..."
"You're welcome!" Luna exclaimed. "Here, Draco, here's yours from me! I saw this and thought of you." Draco opened the metallic navy package and found a thick copy of
"Alright," Astarte laughed, "But make a wish too," and together, they blew out the candles, and blew the memory away.
The nature of the association of Lockhart with these so-called Socis de Seguinus has yet to be unveiled. He was taken for top-secret treatment at St. Mungo's before he could be interrogated by the Ministry of Magic.
He wondered why Mother had sent him these clothes, rather than normal sets of dress robes. Was it Father's order, continuing his streak of utterly dismal attempts at punishment? Was it a nod to Luna's eclectic tastes? Or had she genuinely thought these outfits would suit Draco and his date best, and put on the greatest show of Malfoy wealth and success, on a boy who was doing his best to disgrace the Malfoy name?
He'd accidentally betrayed Luna's confidence. But it was a conclusion Neville should have reached just by logic, let alone by spending as much time with Luna as he had. "If you still have to ask that question, Neville, then you don't get Luna at all."
But Luna was happy to hand it over to Hermione, claiming she was the best speaker. "Future Minister of Magic here," Draco drawled, and Hermione looked embarrassed but pleased. He put away his own issue and reclined to cuddle with Luna as they listened.
?" Draco nodded, telling himself he would not let Harry make him lose his composure, especially since he wasn't even trying. "No, I just- I guess I just assumed I'd be practicing getting out of it. I never thought that
"I know everything you do about what Astaroth did," Draco said defensively. "And Grindelwald's part in making the talon wand. What did you think was so weak about me that I couldn't handle the knowledge of my- connection or something to someone so-"
They walked into the Burrow as invited guests. Mrs. Weasley embraced him with such vehement excitement, his panicked mind remembered that within her matronly appearance hid Aunt Bella's future killer. But she seemed to have nothing more brutal on her mind right now than regaling them with stories about their family trip to Egypt.
- with instructions for the anti-Animagus charm, she wavered. After all, Gryffindor-Ravenclaw was that Saturday, and they wouldn't get a chance for Gryffindor to be this empty again until
When Draco saw the castle coming closer, looming above them like a mixed figure of sanctuary and judgment, he stopped walking. "Wait. Listen. Listen to me, Ron, Potter, you can't tell anyone what I did out there, alright? Even Hermione when she wakes up. The curse I used- did you hear?" Even if they hadn't heard the incantation, they'd learn about the Unforgivable Curses from Moody and figure it out eventually. "It was the Imperius curse, alright? It's one of the Unforgivables.
assignation." He ran a hand over Harry's chest to forestall further grumbling, looking up at him through his pale eyelashes and watching the effect he had on that gorgeous face. He'd never get tired of that helpless sweetness, melting for him, as guileless as anything under the sun. "Which it isn't. Don't you know that..."
"Don't say that, Draco," Luna said serenely. "You're the person most qualified to do blood magic that I know."
"No," Harry muttered, "I don't," and Draco began to poke lightly at his back. Wow, Harry's shoulder blades really had gotten taut. It was like concrete under his fingertip. You could jam your finger on them.
three. And if you did not survive the war, the wizarding world as well as your friends would be much the worse for it. Draco, how would your cousin Luna, for one, feel to hear you speak this way about yourself-"
There was no moat, but with the place itself an island, there was water to protect them. Draco had the time to take a bit of a stroll around the walls and then the castle itself, feeling permitted by Sirius's gratitude to inspect the ancestral holdings. The sun rose higher above them, and made more of the ancient ivy curling around the jagged stone obvious, its green sheen almost swamplike in places. The stone itself was not faded nearly as light a gray as one would have thought, as if there was some magic in it, and also perhaps because a great deal of the stone, unusually, seemed to be obsidian.
"You look just like James," Alice blurted. "Oh, I'm sorry, my dear, I don't mean to be insensitive... it's just so good to see you..." Draco knew the loss of Lily and James had been very, very fresh for them before they had 'gone under', so to speak.
Draco took his wand out of his pocket and began to swirl it between his index and middle fingers, like a toy and not a time bomb. "What was your Boggart?" Potter asked nervously.
Draco would have made a show of standing up to Father. Or at least, he told himself he would have. But a red-faced Mr. Weasley did so before he could. "We have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy."
"Minerva," Severus said, face relaxing, and pocketed his wand without a word, but a slightly mortified air that was more apology than anyone usually got from him. "I take it the headmaster received my message regarding the situation."
"I'm not with Theo, you psychotic stalker!" Draco shrieked. "You're the one everyone wants, not me! You caught the Snitch! You always do! You always win, you always win at everything-"
