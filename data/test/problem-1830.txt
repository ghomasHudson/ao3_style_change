Because anyone he
“Yes,” he agrees, lips to Potter's brow moving to kiss that famous scar. “Yours, you fucking arsehole. Always
“And you're selfish, too. We all are, regardless of what House we sort into. You still want this bloke, no matter his situation, right?”
For if Potter is spying on him, it's likely he still only thinks the worst of Draco, and Draco then doesn't know if he's better off cutting these needs entirely out of him or if he's only making things worse by using the stupid secret room to enable the desire.
match worthy of years of stunted expectations.
You ask too many questions, Potter, you always fucking have.
There's a silence, a different one from before when they were just sitting without their souls bared to one another over the bottle of Firewhiskey. It's a nervous silence now, but a longing one all the same.
Harry outright laughs. “At her own wedding, even. That was great.”
Cursing to himself, Harry ducks between halls and quickly yanks the Map out with a fast muttering of its opening phrase. His eyes instantly pin down Malfoy's feet a few halls away from him now, and as he debates risking it, going past that group talking at the end of where he'd lost sight of his prey, Malfoy's feet disappear again.
He even throws an old, familiar smirk Potter's way once upon passing the Gryffindor into the Great Hall for dinner, shoving Potter away from him and getting an open mouth with the little glare thrown back.
Each glance between the pair of them while they eat, each time they walk
“What do you mean?”
He eyes Draco's breathless form as he enters the room with a swagger in the low light, clothes entirely mussed and hair sticking several directions. There's a large mark on his neck right at his collar, and it's nearly as red as his clearly kissed lips are.
“Shove off,” Draco growls back, legs crossing awkwardly at the ankles beneath the desk as he wills his stupid body to cool
Unnerved entirely by that, Draco sneers over the Gryffindor lot and steps down to Trelawney's location, turning just enough away from her to make a rude hand gesture towards Zabini and hearing an amused scoff as a result.
Blaise crosses his arms, grins awfully, and mutters only for him to hear, “I think you two should just get a fucking
“You know what I think?” Blaise begins, dark eyes slyly glancing out their corners to Draco.
Harry laughs softly. “You're right.”
His fucking brain is paranoid. His ridiculous heart is hopeful. And his eager young body is already curious and excited, stirring again and making him desperately uncomfortable at the very thoughts.
where it used to upon the parchment.
“Fuck,” Blaise grunts and rubs his face.
and not just him with his bloody scar, Potter winks at him and murmurs, striding away, “Oh, and Malfoy? Next time you want to stare at my bum, just do it. I'd rather not have to constantly repair my glasses from you tripping me each time.”
He almost laughs. How

like Blaise being in the way in the Great Hall, and he clearly detests Blaise in the halls or library, too, when he does venture in to sit by Draco and drive Potter insane with his additional presence.
Blaise brings Draco back to the dorms and shuts the door with a sigh.

He stares Draco down until his mate sighs and stands to go back to the library.
“Harry,” Draco whines, holding Harry's head closer instinctively as he teases his thumb about the head of Harry's cock.
“Oh. Okay.”
He comes with a moan to the visual in his head of Potter on his knees with that often scowling mouth soft and warm around his cock, and Draco's stomach clenches harder. But even as he sighs in relief of tension from Potter's ridiculous staring contest in Charms today, he feels a bit empty, too.

Draco barely hears a Hufflepuff shush the Ravenclaw. It's as if he can't move. He certainly can't put the cup down, and he absolutely cannot tear his eyes away from its contents.
At first he's quite determined to wait out the magic and flee the area in case Blaise is watching for his exit. But then he thinks back to what Zabini had said—that the space is timed, yes, but he'll only be let out when he's performed the intended action the magic is covering from others.

Of course Malfoy would have simply gone around Harry's awareness by waiting until late at night to do whatever it is.
Blaise hears the door creak when Draco returns.
“Who?”
Harry manages to untangle himself from some of the people and strides after Malfoy a bit, hoping to seem as if bored and going to speak to Slughorn for some advice in the dungeons.
Draco's chin quivers as he bites his lip. His emotions are welling inside of him, demanding to be spilled past the brim he's kept them bound inside, a bottle much like the one on Harry's lap carefully cradled, and the very tie-in of that visual image to his thoughts gives him courage.
Each day Harry grits his teeth when Zabini's tall body shields most of Malfoy from his vision across the Great Hall at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and each night Harry opens the Map in bed with his wand softly out for light, staring at Draco Malfoy's name in the Slytherin dorms and waiting.
“Bloody hell, it must really be something,” someone catcalls from the Ravenclaw section.
“Mind letting me in on just
“Yes, well, perhaps Lucius Malfoy was kept out of its secrecy in case he tried to dominate the shared space,” Blaise explains, knowing damn well that's what his own uncle has told him.

, too.”
But his heart is pounding, and his mind is running with the possibilities all on its own. Images of Potter shoving him into a wall for a kiss, of himself grabbing Harry's bum quickly while smacking into him during quidditch on brooms, and of them snogging in the Slytherin team room rock through his brain, and Draco's eyes grow large as he feels something else on his body swell, too.
And when Potter eventually gives up, leaving after a half an hour when Draco doesn't even glance his way once, Draco sighs out a shaky breath and imagines what might have happened had Blaise not interrupted today...he silently thanks Zabini, no matter his friend's personal reasons, for saving his stupid arse.
Draco's mouth goes dry as Potter looks him over once with some sort of knowledge in his eyes. He stammers back together with a roughly thrown out, “What are
I do?”
His fingers still rest against Potter's brow, but he can't stop the shaking in them. His heart pounds through his veins, his pants and trousers feel even more uncomfortable tilted this way on his side with his desire coursing through him, and Harry leans closer, green eyes more open in that moment than they've ever been to Draco Malfoy in his life.
He begins the change by sitting next to Draco two days later, on a Thursday morning, at breakfast.

with this fucking snake that's driven him mad for years. His free fingers roam under Malfoy's trousers over his stomach and about his hips, cup his sac and get a shout of pleasure for his efforts when the timing combines with a tiny accidental grazing of his teeth, and then he feels Draco reaching desperately for him and takes the hand grasping over his forearm in the dark.
By a month and a half, they're already tied up.
And though you'll never see it, like you never have before,
you interrupted...my...scheduled time?” Draco asks behind him, unnerved and annoyed.
Blaise is well aware of Potter's jealousy, and while it has made him feel less guilty about manipulating Malfoy around him and all, it makes him worry even more to himself. He's not sure if Potter is jealous simply because Blaise is throwing off their personal space they've always shared by butting his way in occasionally now.
wanting to figure out what you do in here...how you were vanishing away. You've always come alone, right?”
“Be selfish with me,
staring at you,” Blaise teases, looking over Draco's head as Draco refuses to turn his face to follow.
Harry laughed, “She’s a bright kid.”
Harry grinned, “So that’s what you thought of them, then? Kind of fantastic?”
Theodore shook his head, “No, this is my first time here.” Harry noticed for the first time that there was a framed photo of the staff behind the welcome desk. Standing beside Priti in the second row was Draco, waving and beaming. One of those expressions Harry had never seen before. Harry averted his eyes, as if the real Draco might come round the corner and catch him looking.
Notably, they watched both the Pride and Prejudice miniseries and the newer film, and their debate regarding the merits of the respective Darcies grew so heated, that they were obliged to call on Hermione to be their tie-breaker. Hermione did not seem at all surprised to find them in their pyjamas together but as she only said that Colin Firth was better looking but Matthew McFayden was more pleasingly awkward, she was not much help.
“Yes, okay. I think you should, too.”
“Even among muggleborn magic users, there’s this idea that. Instead of seeing magical power as a fluke that could happen to anyone, it’s some sort of divine blessing.You’ve broken a long chain of nonmagical people because you’re the first in however many generations to deserve it. A very particular sort of magic, mind. Wizards aren’t the only ones who use magic, but we still get to make the rules about its place in the world and who’s entitled to use it and how.
Harry let go of Ginny and cast a Drying Charm over them, “How are the chickens?”
“So you’ll know me? Once you’re transformed?”
Harry shot a guilty glance at Draco to find Draco was looking at him as well.
Draco smirked, “I mean of course the very particular Potter magic that--let’s see how did you put it again?--helps us see into hearts and lives that are not our own. Something like that?”
Harry tended to plan rather more domestic dates. Lots of home cooked meals and ambles in the park. Draco made a habit of accepting all of Harry’s invitations to spend the full moon at Grimmauld Place, and they would watch films together while Draco rested up after his transformation.
“Twinkle will be fine to go in ahead of you,” Draco said smoothly. “But if you like, I can take her ahead and show you. You can follow just behind.”
“A prophylactic measure,” Harry told him.
Draco was still asleep when Harry came back in, so he cooked some pasta for supper and went to check again when he’d finished with his own helping.
Harry flushed, “I. I know it won’t do, and I’ve spoken to her, and I’ll keep speaking to her.”
“Oooh, yes please,” Luna got up and followed Ginny out of the garden.
“Only to be sure it is quite saved,” said Harry, not as embarrassed to be caught eavesdropping as he knew he should be.
“So are you,” Draco kissed him. “I’m not sleepy, I only wanted to be close to you.”
Draco smiled, “I know you aren’t.” There was a rough, trembling quality to his voice on his last words. “You mustn’t touch me, while I do it,” Draco continued in a husk that made the hair stand up on the back of Harry’s neck. “I won’t hurt you or anything, but it won’t help. I know you’ll want to, but-” Draco trailed off, clenching his jaw.
“There is one last little thing to remove, and with your godfather’s permission, I’ve saved it to last so that you can see it done. If you like.”
“Not all that horrible Chosen One rubbish you went through, of course. That child soldier shit felt torturously interminable on my end, and you had to cope with so much more of it than I did. I meant. You didn’t come back to Hogwarts. You weren’t in the papers anymore, til. Well the Weasley girl business, but even that was all gossip. You were just. Gone.”
Theodore nodded, but then in a rather small voice, “But won’t everyone know about me, then?”
Harry raised his eyebrows, “I really feel like I was the one being jostled, and you were doing the jostling.
Theo made to follow him, but Harry held him back, “Let’s not be underfoot, Theo.” Theodore obeyed, but he was exuding nervous eagerness and kept glancing at Harry as if they were both expecting some wonderful treat.
“Wow!” said Theodore. “Will you do that through the whole house?”
, “All right then, let’s talk about the book.”
Harry pressed his lips together, “Okay, that’s adorable. I can’t look at you doing that too long; it’ll do something to my inside. Right, I’m going to go and hide. No peeking!”
Draco laughed, “I was going to. I assure you. Lubricus,” he added and glided slippery fingers over Harry’s cock. He raised his hips and positioned Harry against him, “I know I’m bossy, but you might do some of the work?”
“Need anything for the night?”
“Well, you’re getting along great,” Ginny gave him an encouraging wallop on the back, determined not to lose any more ground in mateyness, apparently. “You’ll make a fabulous queer, Harry.”
“Maybe we could play a game or something?”
Whatever it was, Harry had to put it aside to prepare for Theodore’s arrival. There was a tremendous amount to be done. Several of the rooms he had simply sealed up by magic, as there was no use for them and plenty that needed seeing to in the rooms they were to actually live in. He’d selected a guest room for Theodore and practically gutted it. The grimy, faded wallpaper and ancient carpet had been torn out and replaced, along with the furniture. Harry gave the room a fresh coat of paint, but apart from laying a thick rug on the floor, a twinkly star patterned duvet on the new bed and hanging a poster of the solar system on the wall as a nod to Theodore’s current space obsession, Harry had decided to leave most of the decorating to the room’s new occupant. He did rehang an old tapestry, as he felt it looked nice with the poster.
"Let's see this miracle potion then," he nodded towards the now light green liquid, the same colour as the Quidditch Pitch after it had rained.
“I can feel Luna’s emotions,” Ginny said quietly.
“This might seem overly simplified, but why don’t you invite Gran- Hermione?” Draco pointed out.
Harry burst out laughing, “You never cease to amaze me, Draco.”
“It’s just the timing, it makes sense. The first time I met with Harry when I came back he was in this massive hurry to get back to the village. He was acting oddly too, agitated and anxious.”
“Obviously you do not agree with his and Harry's relationship, but it happened. I have never seen Harry act the way he does when he is around Draco, and that was after only just a few minutes of observation I am sorry you are feeling the way that you are but if you want to keep Harry in our lives then you may as well get over those feelings. Draco is here to stay. A lot of terrible things happened today and our world is changing. One thing that isn't is the bond Harry and Draco have. It's evident Hermione knew about their relationship and seems to be fine with Draco. If she can forgive him, so can all of you."
I can't believe we finished the Third Task! This next chapter is my absolute favorite. I am literally so excited for you all to read it. I may not be able to wait until Thursday to post it... We shall see.
“Want to skip the train?” Harry asked passing the cold metal from hand to hand, pressing his thumb into the ridges.
“I hardly see how it matters about his testimony; the man was obviously delusional!” Fudge shouted, exasperated.
“What is she saying, Draco?” Theo asked, although Pansy could have also answered the question.
“Shh, it’s okay, I’m right here. You’re waking up from an extra strength Dreamless Sleep. It’s going to take a few minutes. You are safe. Take your time, I’m not going anywhere,” Draco’s voice was so soothing and Harry instantly relaxed. He had taken Dreamless Sleep before, it usually made him extra groggy but this was on another level. He trusted Draco though, so he would let himself slowly wake up.
Harry carefully folded his hand, matching his fingers up to the cuts, clarifying to himself how Draco had procured the injuries. Harry’s eyes came up to Draco’s, emotions that Draco couldn’t decipher swirling in his eyes and through the bond. Harry carefully cradled Draco’s hands in his own, his eyes not leaving Draco’s, and a light tingle settled over his hands where the cuts were. Draco felt the cloying feel of healing magic, and he knew without looking that his hands were healed. Just some more uncontrolled wandless magic from his soul-mate like it was nothing.
Draco’s lips were pulling into a thinner and thinner line as Harry told his story; he finally let out a breath and forced a smile, “I owe Theo a great deal then. You did the right thing; he would not want it publicised that he helped you. I will make sure he is aware how thankful you and I are. I would be worried about the Beauxbatons students identifying him, but my guess is they won’t be on campus long enough to say anything. How many were there?”
“Regrettably, yes. Potter brought his body back.”
“It’s not worth repeating, it was homophobic. He should know better than to talk like that around me. Obviously, I’ve never come out officially to any of them, but it’s one of those unspoken things. I could have gotten back at him publicly and no one would have questioned it. He’s been away from high society too long; he’s forgetting his manners. His mother would curse his tongue if she knew what he said. I just didn’t feel like dealing with him being pouty towards me.”
“Wormtail is Pettigrew. He betrayed my parents to Voldemort. He’s the reason they’re dead. He pinned it on Sirius and made him rot in Azkaban for 12 years. Sirius was angry, but Wormtail is the one that blew up the street.”
“I’m good,” Harry finally responded. Ignoring the look Sirius and Remus shared at his answer.
Love, Alexis
Draco looked up at Pomfrey as he said the words and she pursed her lips again tightly before nodding her head slightly and leaving the curtained area. He waited until she had retreated a few steps before promptly allowing himself to have the break down he had barely been keeping at bay. Harry was in Dreamless Sleep and wouldn’t be able to feel his emotions and be affected by them.
Fucking odd. Draco cracks one eye open, arches a brow, and nods against his chair's pillow. “Yes, Potter. Really.”
Harry knows what Draco Malfoy has been disappearing to do, yes, but....
While he isn't really one for weddings and all, Draco could admit that even a Weasley can have taste. The hall rented from some old society witch is gorgeously decked with streams of red and gold, and Ginny Weasley stands across from a grinning Dean Thomas with a smirk that makes Draco smile to see.
Draco hears the words hissed from a few of the Gryffindors that make the rest cackle, and Finnigan and Weasley laugh over a drawing Finnigan holds up that displays a crudely drawn critter of some type. Something possibly ferret for some reason.
Draco keeps to himself at his usual table with his work out before him, and Potter breaks expectation again by coming to sit in the chair opposite him.
And Harry swallows, fingers gripping the book tightly in his hands as he continues to hide and stare and ignore the rush through his body when Malfoy runs a tired hand through his gorgeous hair.
Malfoy frowns at him. “Father's never mentioned it before.”
Harry silently rises as Malfoy starts striding away with those long, warm legs of his, and Harry smiles just the slightest bit when Malfoy pauses at the center aisle and looks over his tall shoulder, waiting on Harry to come on, then.
His trousers are straining against his erection, and his hands roam Potter's shoulders the way Potter's do up his legs and stomach.
He stops trailing them as Zabini drags his person of interest towards the dorms, not stopping despite the arguing echoing down the halls behind them. Zabini's never interfered with the routine that Harry knows of, and he's watched it fucking closely enough the past couple months to know.
Still, now he's doubly fucked with both Potter sneaking after him and Blaise acting all odd about changing his time in the alcove.

Green eyes brighten. The responding smirk bares itself.

Everyone grows quiet, even Crabbe and Goyle with their bickering over a small cake they'd sneaked out of the Great Hall, and Draco watches, body burning with nerves, as Potter's strong, handsome throat swallows down the tea.
Draco isn't having any of it. “I hate you. Get down there and drink your

“Fuck off,” Draco whispers back harshly.
“Fascinating! Mr. Potter has a dragon. Such a rare symbol, you know, but it is one of raw power focused by the dragon's control and cleverness. You've a handful here, Mr. Potter, and my advice to you is to be respectful of the dragon by seeing all the little parts of it—the magnificent fire, the scales, the wings and the hidden, protected heart. Dragons are such misunderstood creatures with their temperaments. Don't fret if your love is a bit covetous of you; it is a protective trait too often mistaken for selfishness.”
“I'll stop if you don't start talking.”
managing to sneak little glares since?
Draco's eyes almost roll back into his skull. “Potter, I...
Long, slender fingers he's admired for months in the library weave through his, tighten them together, and Harry finds a strange sense of peace and comfort as Malfoy bucks beneath him, thrusts awkwardly upward with his hips over the stone bench, and clenches his fingers in Harry's hair so tightly Harry actually feels pain. Thankfully it's pain that crosses with pleasure, and his own demanding need is pulsing and ready and wanting, too.
“Sure, Potter. I know.”
And when the world keeps going, sentencing me to my deserved fate,
Draco can barely breathe when Potter leans up to kiss him in the dark of the alcove.
A nervous feeling, something like the pain of his own broken heart watching and wanting and waiting all these years in silence, wraps about him, and quietly Draco grumbles, “Please tell me this isn't about them getting married. I thought you two were long past?”
He's a bit thrown off by Blaise's sudden change of place again, but Draco has honestly stopped caring about it. There's bigger things to think about, like how Potter didn't look away from him much at all during breakfast, and how Potter didn't even try to
“I know.”
would have felt in his fucking life if he hadn't actually grown to give a real shit about Draco as a friend the last few months of needing to band together and survive the hatred of the rest of Hogwarts.
Harry shudders against him, against that firm body he's dreamed about for a while now. Something in him urges to dominate like it does then in those sexy moments of prowess he hasn't felt much otherwise, and Harry gives into the feeling, takes claim of the next kiss and rubs the pad of his thumb under the head of Draco's cock after his latest sliding squeeze.
And as Trelawney's voice swells, signaling he should pay attention, Draco takes two more seconds to look Potter's way. His mouth drops open slightly when he catches Potter staring at him oddly; the idiot blinks when their eyes meet, and then he immediately turns away, rosier through the cheeks for some reason.
Draco pulled his cloak tighter around his shoulders, ducking his chin against the cold wind. They were making their way inside after finishing Care of Magical Creatures class. Not for the first time Draco wished he was walking next to Harry who was a couple paces ahead of him, leaning into Hermione. This time it was solely for the reason that Hermione had conjured some of her trademark blue flames and was holding it in a jar, keeping the trio warm. Draco wished he could do the same, but Hermione was known for the flames. Maybe if he could manage to make them green...
“Harry I can step out,” Hermione said, frowning.
“It used to be navy.”
“Come on, he’s better than that!” Ron complained, throwing his arms up in frustration.
“Je parle français,” Draco commented and smirked as Harry’s pupils dilated. “Tu aimes ça?”
“I just wish it was someone you could be with,” Pansy said quietly.
For the first time Draco felt real hatred for the Dark Lord. How could anyone do that to a baby? What kind of person would stand behind someone who would?
Draco blanched, “Magic?” He repeated, dazed.
Finally, they were instructed to rise as the Champions entered the room.
Love,
Draco shrugged, “It depends how long it takes for him to get away.” Draco peeked at the journal and saw Harry had scrawled his small moon character, but nothing more. “He should be here soon.”
“Gabrielle!” Fleur cried over and over as she was healed, tears running down her face.
“You need the post-Cruciatus potion,” Hermione said.
Harry’s face scrunched in confusion, “Okay. Is he all right?”
“Let’s think about this logically though, say it is a person, which we don’t know for sure. What would be gained by Dumbledore outing the two of you? No, he knows keeping your relationship secret is important. I doubt your father would be okay with you being stuck at the bottom of the lake against your will regardless of what that meant in conjunction to your relationship with Harry. Dumbledore isn’t trying to get sacked. No, if it is a person they’d choose someone whose family wouldn’t raise a fuss.”
Harry froze, his eyes darting downward to glance at his chest, making sure his mark was covered.
Harry frowned, “I don’t think so, it doesn’t feel like your emotions anyway. Besides, you haven’t been mad, you’ve been sad. And anxious.”
Harry smirked at him, “Oh, well then that’s all right.”
Draco didn’t like the feeling coming through the bond, it was like he could barely feel Harry at all. It was making the anxiety in his chest tighten more so with each step he got closer to Harry without any emotions coming through. Draco hadn’t realized how much of a comfort feeling Harry’s undercurrent of emotions flowing through him had been until he couldn’t feel it anymore. He understood why Harry had gotten so upset about him cutting off his emotions all of those weeks ago. He would definitely think twice before he cut them off again.
“You’re a life saver.”
Malfoy stiffened and returned to looking at his cauldron. "I'm fine. You can go."
“Draco Malfoy friends with a Muggleborn, who would have seen that coming?” Harry asked.
Draco winced and smiled for real this time, “Apologies, I forget sometimes. I’m just so livid. Three of-age wizards attacking a 4th year, it’s preposterous. Absolute fucking cowards.”
“Put down he was sick, whatever, just please leave our marks out of it. Please Madam Pomfrey. The danger he’d be in...” Harry trailed off. “Imagine what Lucius Malfoy could do with the information. Please.” Harry pulled out every option he could think of.
“Er, okay?” She said.
She followed the path turning the direction the blood trailed and gasped, Draco was laying in a heap in the snow, his face covered in blood. She sprinted the rest of the way up to him, braced for the worst.
“How would they even know about you, anyways,” Harry said, grasping his hand, having returned from his experiment with the window.
“It’s massive,” Remus remarked and Sirius smirked and nodded, waggling his eyebrows. Remus rolled his eyes.  “I wonder why he hasn’t said anything.”
“Thanks for the cloak, Draco,” Theo commented and Draco grinned at his friend. Theo hated to admit it, but he was often quite cold in the cool temperatures of the dungeons. The cloak was enchanted to keep the wearer warm, but the charm was concealed so that no one would take the piss for Theo needing a charmed cloak. It was uncommon for men’s cloaks to be charmed, but gold could buy you pretty much anything. Draco was happy his friend had liked the gift and not been offended; it was a testament to their friendship that he had received it well.
“Sure, swot,” Harry teased and Draco stuck his tongue out at him.
“You-Know-Who returned?! You cannot be serious!” Fudge burst and Draco tilted his head.
Draco winced at his slip up, refusing to look at the now silent Matron. He knew he would see pity if he did.
“Wass’ goin on?” Ron asked blearily from the other bunk.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry sighed, Draco didn’t blame him, she had made him repeat the words twice already.
He seemed to get what he wished for because then that feeling of adrenaline and excitement from the First Task filtered through. Draco hoped whatever he was facing wasn’t too challenging. A little while later he felt small scratches at his right leg, but they weren’t overly painful. Then a few moments later red sparks went up, but Harry was still feeling that focused determination. Draco figured it must have been one of the other three. Harry didn’t seem to be running into any other obstacles as the minutes passed by. Finally, there was a change as confusion and annoyance came through. Draco was utterly flummoxed as to why Harry would be feeling that way. Harry sometimes felt that way while in Potions or Transfiguration, but in the middle of a giant maze didn’t quite make sense. Relief and excitement washed through and Draco figured whatever had been perplexing him was no longer a problem. Harry’s excitement increased and Draco hoped he was close to being done. He just wanted this was all to be over, once and for all.
“You’re here,” Harry whispered.
“Pans,” Theo commented as he sat down, still holding himself oddly.
Dumbledore had just announced to the school how three Beauxbatons’ students were caught the night before after assaulting a Triwizard Champion. He had openly stated how one of the students was already on the way to Azkaban after use of an Unforgiveable was proven by his wand. The other two students who aided him had been expelled from Beauxbatons, had their wands snapped, and were already back in France where they were now forced to stay.
Thank you so much for the fantastic reception! Here's chapter 2 as a treat! We get some drama at the Cup, and some interaction between Draco and Harry. Hope you like it, I think the writing gets less choppy from here. I do have an issue with passive voice. It's a work in progress.

“Harry, I don’t curse Muggleborns anymore, okay? I don’t call them names I’m supposed to. I don’t make Greg and Vince beat the shit out of them. I don’t run the Slytherin Common Room like I’m supposed to. I spend barely any time with my House. I let a girl who I am not betrothed to or bonded to cover me in love bites, and I don’t heal them. I’m supposed to have more decorum than this. I’m supposed to be the perfect Pureblood gentleman. I am breaking almost every one of my father’s expectations.”
“She’s actually really brilliant when you get to know her,” Harry defended. “She sacrificed a lot to cover for Draco and I this year.”
“A prank.”
Draco slid his chair back further from the mayhem, calmly chomping on his own sandwich.
"No one deserved that.” Harry said fiercely. “Besides, I know you weren't going to curse one of us."
Draco pulled the note from Father, shoving it in his pocket before securing the new note to Hecules’ leg. “Thanks, I’ll have plenty of treats tomorrow morning at breakfast. Make sure to come,” He instructed. Hercules gave him an affectionate nip to ear before spreading his massive wings and soaring from the Owlery.
Soul-mate bonds were some of the weirdest magic that Harry had encountered since finding out he was a wizard. There was no precursor to two people becoming soul-mates. Sometimes it was between friends, but sometimes it was between two complete strangers. Or two nemeses, Harry added as an afterthought, his mind straying to his apparent bond mate.
“Thanks petal.” Ginny turned to Harry, shaking her head, “Come on, Harry. I thought you were past this. Can’t we just try and get along?”
“Oh goodness,” Draco sat down beside Harry. “Lord and lady, Harry. You came out right in the middle of a quidditch match?”
“Well. Er. I suppose the rude answer is. Because I didn’t want to write about my experiences. They’re mine, and other people already feel entitled enough to them as it is. If I hadn’t written fiction, I wouldn’t have written at all. I hate talking about myself.”
Malfoy began to blush, “Yes, I suppose it would get messy if we went any further back.”
Harry squeezed Draco’s hand, “Exactly. Yes. Getting to know each other. That’s what I want, too. I want to know you better.”
Draco swung his hair in a fragrant wave over his shoulder, “I hope you’re not telling me it’s over.”
“Something like that.”
Ginny finished, “'
Harry didn’t scowl, and he knew he didn’t because he was specifically trying not to, “Like what? My face isn’t like anything.”
Harry put a hand on Theo’s shoulder, “Are they dangerous?”
“Why?”
“Well you didn’t have to ambush me, if you wanted to hear from me. You could have done something. Normal.” The kettle whistled, and Harry turned his attention back to the tea, “Do you mind teabags? I fucking hate loose leaf.”
Theodore held up a new copy of the book Draco had sent him, then got up from the bench. There were tiny boats moored to the near side of the shore so that visitors could send gifts across to the patient side. Theodore caught hold of one of these and sailed the book across the moat to Andromeda.
Harry thought Draco would spring past and run for home base, and he pushed himself up, ready to give chase. But Draco only gamboled about triumphantly, bumping heavily against Harry’s knees, and several times nearly treading on Shadowfax, who was insistently underfoot.
“Weren’t no chickens fed, and you know it,” Hagrid muttered, going over to the fireplace to warm himself.
“No problem. That her in the basket?”
“No,” Harry smiled. “Well, we’ll try not to make a habit of it and get ourselves in trouble, but I don’t see the harm tonight. Go on, then. I’ll be in with the food in a bit. Best have a wash before you get settled. Your face and hands are filthy from the Floo. Know where the bathroom is?” Theodore nodded. “Good. Mind you be really careful in the corridors so you don’t wake up the portraits. I did it last time I was here, and it scared the pants off me when they all started shouting suddenly.”
“Well before it’s edited, mind. And just a bit.”
“Give it a wave,” Draco said, speaking for the first time.
“Are you offering to lay down newspaper? I’m not going to have a wee on your sitting room floor!”
“There was something else I wanted to speak to you about,” Draco said importantly.
“You’ve been seeing Malfoy regularly-”
It took Malfoy a long time to complete the assessment. With Harry in tow, he made a very slow tour of the house with his Dark Detector, pausing frequently to make notes in a large black leather notebook. He cast a cunning Muffliato on Mrs Black’s portrait in order to inspect its join to the wall with a little cluck of his tongue. He shined his wand into every cupboard and cabinet, down every ventilation shaft, and when Theo had finished with practise, into the piano. He peeled back the carpet in seemingly random corners. He got out what looked like a golden stethoscope and listened to places in the walls. He prodded rugs and tapestries and shook out cloaks.
Harry smiled, “No. But I do think I need a chat, if you don’t mind.”
“You said I could use the video,” Theodore reminded him.
Harry laughed again, “Oh you meant just for today.”
“But you’re so nice now,” Theodore objected as if he suspected again that they were teasing him somehow. “You got the ghoul out of my room.”
“Right,” Harry dragged in a deep breath through his nose and let it out slowly. “Relaxing.”
“Rowan, unicorn hair core, eleven inches and nicely springy. I made this one myself,” Dean announced cheerfully, as he rung them up. “Bit of a nursemaid it is. It’ll certainly look after you. Unicorn hair cores tend to be dead loyal to their first owner, too.”
“You’re right, Theodore,” Draco agreed. “Grimmauld Place does sound dreadful. And I expect you’ve got an idea or two on what might be better.”
“You really do this all on your own every single month?” Harry asked, offering the Strengthening Solution again.
“You were saying, Hazzer?” Dudley prompted. Hermione was looking a little miffed, but she didn’t draw back her chair and rather leaned in closer when Harry lowered his voice to briefly tell Dudley what exactly had been in Theo’s cupboard and what it had turned into.
“I think so.” Theo thought a bit more, then asked, “Being gay, it’s just about boys having boyfriends and girls having girlfriends, right? Like sometimes boys and girls like to go out with each other but sometimes boys want to go out with boys and girls want to go out with girls?”
“That’s what I thought myself!”
“Hello,” he said expectantly, tossing his bag down as he stepped out of the Floo.
“Why do you ask that?” Harry said quickly, startled.
“I thought I was a bad influence? Or have you changed your mind so quickly? Maybe you’ve decided that there’s more to being a decent person than having decent parents and more to being a bad person than having bad parents? There’s more to moral development than having been born on the right side.” Malfoy said over the last of his scone.
“Oh,” said Theodore.
Then he put on Fellowship of the Rings and came back to the bed, “Mind if I join you?”
Draco sproinged a little harder, “I know I’m not Prince Hamlet.”
Theodore beamed, “Thanks Harry!”
Harry didn’t know what to say, “Well. The sun couldn’t fit in your bed.”
Draco’s eyes went very wide in a way that was even higher praise than his quite lavish compliments, “Right now? I could read a bit of your new book well before it’s come out?”
Harry nodded, “Sirius Black.”
“Is it?” Harry was rather surprised at that response.
“Mmno,” Draco caught Shadowfax in time to prevent her from stealing half a fried egg off Harry’s plate and kissed her on the top of the head. “Finish here, if you like. The smell of breakfast food is terribly relaxing.” He shut his eyes, his breathing already deepening.
“This is it here, is it?” Draco nodded to the neat stack of manuscript pages on Harry’s otherwise quite untidy desk.
“You said she’s attentive on your transformation days?”
Theo’s eyes were huge, “And that’s why people don’t want to know you?”
“Heavens. Very supportive.”
“Right, well. Not everyone is as good at confronting uncomfortable truths as you are.”
“Obsessed is a strong word,” Harry objected.
Harry cleared his throat, “I’m really enjoying being seduced. Thanks for asking. Have at it.”
“You don’t mind me eating in the sitting room? Granny never lets me.”
“Malfoy…”
Harry cocked his head thoughtfully, “We’ll invent a hand signal.”
Draco nodded jerkily.
“Good,” Malfoy smiled. “First you need to relax.”
“I do understand the importance of having a decent homelife, actually! And I’d never have sent him to the Black family looking for one! Being raised as the heir to the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black is the last thing in the world either of his parents would have wanted for him! And no wonder, since it was full of blood supremacists and murderers!”
“Harry,” Theo said hesitantly, though in a tone that Harry thought suggested he’d meant to speak up for some time. “Erm. Is Draco coming home with us? Does he live at Grimmauld Place now?”
“Off you go and have your tea like you promised while I sort that out with Draco,” said Harry firmly. “And I want to hear piano practise within the hour as well.”
He looked up when Harry came in, “I can’t decide what to watch.”
Harry rose as well and folded Draco into his arms, kissed his cheek, “Let’s get some air.”
Andromeda was dabbing her eyes with her handkerchief again. “That’s lovely, dear,” she said weakly. “I’ll give it a good read.”
“Then why would we need to decontaminate the house? All that cursed stuff is so old, so why doesn’t it stop like the pictures do?”
“Both. People have to actually choose how to behave.”
Ginny let out a nervous laugh, “Well that’s good. I’d hate to have to hex you. Still reserving the right, mind you.”
“No one,” Harry glared at Ron. “It’s nothing. Go back to your fool.”
“Well,” Theo plucked at a loose thread in the knee of his robes. “Quite a lot of his letters have been coming with Godric now, so I wondered.”
“Well I didn’t mean leap out of bed and get thee to a typewriter this moment, Harry.”
” the branch grew as the voice spoke, already it had wrapped itself around Malfoy’s hand and began to creep up his wrist. “
They landed staggering in the sitting room of Draco’s flat.
“So you reckon this Malfoy bloke wanted to see his cousin, because they’re both werewolves and he’s in a group that helps kid werewolves?” Dudley asked.
“Not very long. But I erm. I did have a dream about you that I’ve just woken up from.” Draco nuzzled back into Harry’s chest and dragged light kisses across it. Despite the warmth of the blankets and the sweat on the back of his neck, Harry’s skin prickled into gooseflesh at the touch.
“I’m not upset,” Draco insisted. “Well. That’s not the main thing.”
“Well I never met another one before,” said Theo stoutly. Then added apologetically, “Sorry. I think my granny thinks they-we’re not very nice.”
“Oh good.” Harry paused, “I suppose this means you’ll be. Erm.”
Ginny snorted, “It’s almost like you don’t even remember what the two of you were like together at school. But you managed to be around each other again because you both wanted to look after Teddy, didn’t you?”
“I haven’t told Granny yet,” Theodore said rather fretfully. “I don’t think she would like it. I think she really likes me being Teddy.”
Malfoy jumped, “What?”
Harry raised his eyebrows, “You read Tolkien?”
Theodore considered for a moment, “Yes, that’s all right.”
“Well, I like attending to you,” Draco said. “You’re always attending to me. Anyway Tergeo isn’t good for this. It leaves you sticky.”
“Well, yeah, but actually that’s the other thing that’s bothering me. We cleaned the house ages ago. And then I went over it again before we moved in. But there was still some monster lurking in it, ready to jump out and get my godson!”
Harry’s brain--soggy little hormone soup that it was--found this very funny.
Presently, he heard the tapping of Draco’s toenails in the corridor, and as the footsteps came closer, a heavy snuffling that led right to the threshold of the room.
Theodore bowed his head over his dish of ice cream as if he were being scolded, and when he looked up again, Harry realised with dismay that he wasn’t so much serious or abashed as frightened, his amber eyes were wide and tears were starting to rise in them, “Harry, is Granny going to die?”
“Hmm,” Harry said playfully. “You don’t mind getting distracted with sex now? Time for you to be beguiled in the fogs of lust? You know me well enough?”
Harry frowned, “Is that what you’d say if there were a boggart in Rosie’s cupboard, and she woke up screaming in the middle of the night because it attacked her? Oh I’m not a bad father; it’s just one of those things. Can’t be helped. Go easy on yourself.”
Draco’s silvery eyes glittered with mischief, “These papers are cursed, Potter. It’s tragic, really. Going to have to Incendio them.”
He poured himself a drink, and held up the bottle, “I suppose you don’t want any? I think you said wolfsbane makes the hangover a lot worse?”
“Of course not,” Draco crossed his heart.
“No, that’s really what it is.”
“I know, I know,” Harry yawned. “You’ll turn me into a great big juicy toad and feed me to a raccoon.”
“Well,” Harry said slowly. “Erm, there are people in the world who don’t like gay people and try to make things difficult for them and even hurt them. And that makes a lot of gay people want to be very careful about who knows they’re gay. Oh, so as well as not asking people if they’re gay, if someone tells you that they are, you shouldn’t tell other people without permission, all right? That’s very important.”
Ginny nodded, her tears welling over, “Basically, yeah. At first.”
“That’s very true,” agreed Draco. “But you fit perfectly.” And he kissed him.
Theodore shyly accepted a little badge with the silver silhouette of a howling wolf on a dark purple field. He pinned it to his jumper, then seemed to get self conscious and tucked it carefully in his pocket. Harry aimed a quick Securing Charm at Theo’s jeans pocket to make sure the badge didn’t fall out on the bus.
“I’m really glad to hear you say that. Relieved like. Because. I hope I’m not being presumptuous, I just think I’ve felt things like. Like we’re sort of. Finding our way back to the beginning that. Maybe we should have had? If things had been different when we met? Know what I mean? Like. Things are sort of shifting about. Like we are, ourselves?”
“Bit humiliating to do it in front of her, don’t you think?” Harry said through his teeth.
Draco nodded, “I think we are. Your granny and my mum are sisters.”
“Mm,” said Dudley sympathetically. “But do you get on?”
“Mmmmm,” Draco set his mug down. “Thank you so much.” And he shifted slightly to drop his head back onto his pillow, even though the tray was still half propped against his lap.
“Well, I apologise,” said Draco a bit stiffly.
“Doesn’t she?” Harry frowned. “Why not?”
“That feels lovely,” Harry bowed his head a bit to give Draco easier access.
“No,” said Theo. Then hesitantly, “What if I transform while I’m there?”
Theo nodded and took another great bite of his sandwich before reaching out with his free hand to touch the old biscuit tin that they were using for a Portkey. With the old familiar jerk behind the navel and a swirling of their surroundings, Harry and Theodore were pulled through the Portkey and landed staggering in a field. Theodore nearly dropped his bacon sandwich into a cow pat, but managed to save it. Harry congratulated him on his quick reflexes, and they walked on to the school in companionable quiet.
“We construct it together? Have you got to teach me what to do?”
? That’s allowed?”
Harry opened his mouth furiously, but realised he was indeed worked up, so shut it with a click, and tried to calm himself with first a long swig of gillywater and then counting down from ten and then twenty and then thirty.
“You’re not bad at it!” Ginny said rather fiercely, as if she were annoyed at having her previous judgment impugned. “You’ve already helped Theodore so much!”
“No,” said Harry firmly. “It’s all right that you were scared of the boggart. That’s the whole point of boggarts. But you’re not allowed because you’re a kid, and I’m a grownup, and it’s my job to see that you’re safe. Okay?”
Harry was rather preoccupied when he turned away from the school gates after depositing his godson beyond them, so it took him a few moments to notice he was being called out to.
“Yeah, that’s it.”
Theodore looked hesitant, then nodded, and Harry hugged him tightly and patted his shoulder, “You’re safe, okay? I’m not going to let anything hurt you.”
“Yeah, well. I reckon it’s easier to make good choices when you have good influences. The er. Right side can help with that a bit. And for your information,” Harry snapped. “The people who raised me were rubbish also. My parents definitely weren’t the beginning and end of my er. Moral development.”
At a quarter to eleven on September first, Harry and Theodore hurried through King’s Cross station toward the departure platform. Theodore had Twinkle’s basket clutched in his arms, and Harry was dragging Theo’s trunk, bewitched to hover the tiniest bit off the ground and glide smoothly along as if it were wheeled. Draco was waiting for them at Platform 9, with a steaming paper takeaway cup in each hand. He was dressed in neat muggle clothes, save for the black dragon leather jacket that matched his boots.
Luna pointed her wand at Ginny, “Anapneo.”
Draco turned back to Theo, “Now Theodore, I don’t suppose you could give us a big shout?”
“Exactly. Absolutely nothing Dark or dangerous in this room at all.”
“Yes, we’re practically neighbours,” Draco followed Harry down the stairs to the pavement. “It’s this way.”
"Don't get out much?" Draco smirked, “Yes, I’d gathered that.”
“Take some home,” Harry offered. “Me and Theo won’t be able to finish them before they go off.”
“Sorry to dredge all this up,” Harry said. “I really should’ve thought that question through.”
“Oh. Yes, of course. The library. Time flies when you’re having fun.” Draco rose and Vanished the settee, then followed Harry out of the room.
Draco snorted, blowing warm breath down Harry’s thigh.
“That’s it? That’s the curse?”
“Well you might carry on with the assessment, then.”
Theodore sighed, “But you set it so that it would be while I was at school. Why can’t I see it?”
“Not only for me, though. You didn’t only save me. Everyone was.” He let out a heavy breath through his nose. “And you stopped it.”
Harry laughed, “Over my dead body.”
“But,” Harry added hastily. “I. I don’t mean that I don’t want to see you, because I do. I’m just trying to say. Be patient with me? I might be quite slow. Is that okay?”
Draco nodded again. “I’m going to come all over you,” he announced with relish. "Very soon."
Draco shrugged, “I wouldn’t’ve wanted anything to do with them if they hadn’t. Well. I got there eventually anyway.”
“I’m not afraid,” Harry said quickly.
“Cleaner services?”
Draco quieted them all with an impressive Silencing Charm, “Very well done, Theodore, thank you. Now I don’t know if you’re aware, but this portrait is hung to the wall with a Permanent Sticking Charm. Do you know how to tell?”
Malfoy nodded, “I think I should. If you’ll have me.”
“Fun, yeah! Fun is important. I think our self-seriousness is behind a lot of our social ills, actually.”
“Oh,” Theodore considered. “How about
“Do you know what pizza is?”
Draco stood up, Vanishing the glass as he got to his feet, “I think that’d help, thanks.”
“Do people really call them familiars? Not pets?” Harry said to Draco when they were alone.
Malfoy had another sip of his coffee, “You don’t by any chance have any more of those marvellous scones?”
Dean offered Theo a handshake, “Dean Thomas. It’s a real pleasure. Your dad was a good man. Best teacher Hogwarts has ever seen.”
“Sorry,” Theo mumbled, dropping his eyes to the wood shavings under their feet.
“Have I?” Harry frowned, “How so?”
“Feel this,” Malfoy held the Dark Detector out to Harry and guided Harry’s hand to the handle.
“I don’t need to butter you up. I’m sure you’ll be interested because of your ego--er I mean because of your well founded confidence in your ability to improve people’s lives.”
“Huge help,” Harry assured him.
Hagrid got up to give Harry one of his bone-cracking hugs, lifting him completely off his feet as easily as when he’d been eleven years old, “Harry, you never said you were coming. I’d’ve baked! If you’ll be here a good while, I could go next door and-”
Dudley patted Harry on the shoulder, and Hermione made little fluttering motions with her hands like she wanted to give him a hug but wasn’t sure if she’d be allowed.
“Yes, all right. I don’t typically discuss where I like to piss on second dates, so let’s call the subject closed, if you don’t mind.”
“There isn’t anything wrong with being gay. I didn’t mean to imply that. There’s nothing wrong with it, okay?”
“That’s terribly romantic,” Draco said almost dreamily.
Harry coughed quietly, hoping to get her attention without startling her but she still jumped, “Goodness! Hello Harry dear! You gave me a turn. Everything all right?”
Harry hesitated a moment, then admitted, “If I watch something scary before bed, I’ll have terrible nightmares and not be able to sleep again til the sun comes up.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes up at the ceiling, “‘Dear Potter, What sort of person did you grow up to be? Are you still insufferable? Personally, I’m a werewolf now. Hope you’re well. Cordially, Malfoy’”
Draco shrugged, “Feels strange being back. More than I anticipated. I’m different now,” he added. “I don’t want to be mistaken for a person I don’t think much of anymore.”
Ginny and Bill were sat at a nearby table, but their attention was caught anyway. They and Hermione looked round.
“Yes, I’ll know you, Harry. I’m still in my right mind; that’s the point of the wolfsbane. Only er. Certain elements of my personality will be more. Forefront. Nothing dangerous, only a bit annoying if you’re not feeling erm. Snuggly. Don’t mind me, only shove me away if you need the loo or you want to be alone or something. I won’t be offended.”
“Yeah,” Ginny stood up and Harry rose and wrapped her in a hug. It was nice. The flowery perfume he remembered from their relationship was gone. She smelled sweetish, a bit like hay, and she still hugged back as if she were determined to prevail in a contest. It made him want to laugh.
“Thanks,” said Harry.
“Well she needs to get over herself,” Harry muttered. “But I reckon it’s my responsibility now, as I’ll be looking after him. I told him that’s not what werewolves are like straight away.”
Harry snorted, “Thanks, I’m still working on it. Are you hungry? I could fix you a sandwich,” it occurred to Harry that he should not have taken his godson out for ice cream before feeding him something more nutritious for supper.
“I’ll show you,” Harry interrupted firmly. “Theodore, you’ll be hungry. You can have a bit of that pie Aunt Molly sent us for your tea. It’s on the cold shelf in the pantry.”
“Draco got hurt,” Harry said.
“And pretending we’re above them. Trying this hard not to be like them. It makes us so much worse than we could be. Don’t you think?”
“Thanks Molly. Here he comes,” Harry pulled his head out of the fire and stepped back for Theodore. “Aunt Molly’s going to put us up for the night, all right? I’ll have a poke about tomorrow and see that there isn’t anything else in the house that shouldn’t be there while you’re at school. Go on through, and I’ll go back to your room and get your things for school and be with you in a minute. Is your school bag packed or is there something I should look for?”
Malfoy shrugged, “It isn’t something I’d expect you to understand.”
“That’s a different question.”
“You can’t really expect me to believe you didn’t know this was my house? I signed my name to my inquiry letter! Plus there’s the address you had to give to get here. I know you know it!”
“Darling,” Draco came and put his arms around Harry’s neck and bent to kiss his temple, “Everything is fine. I’m meeting the movers at my old place, and it’ll only be a couple of hours there, and then I’ll be back and help you sort out what you want to wear to the premier. Deep breaths. Remember your exercises.”
Malfoy tilted his head, “Erm. Because you call him Theodore.”
“Hi Harry,” Ginny said warily. “Been a while since you’ve been by here.”
“He’s my cousin,” Theodore said importantly.
Harry turned to see what Theodore was aiming for and sickening horror rose in him when he saw. In the mouth of Theodore’s cupboard, a horrible figure slunk out of its shadows, wolf-headed but man-shaped, gangling and hairy, it’s long arms nearly dragging on the ground, its toothy jaws opened in a snarl and frothed with drool.
“It’s all right.” Harry smiled, “Everyone tries to give me writing advice. For all I’m supposedly so inventive, no one seems willing to let me get on with it like I know what I’m doing.”
Malfoy took a long sip of tea, “They’re delectable.”
“Okay,” said Harry. “That sounds good to me.”
“Will you call me Theodore?”
“Oh. Of course.”
“All right, never mind. I’ve gone off that idea. I don’t mind being the only novelist, if I can prevent that.”
“Do they actually talk?” Theodore looked interested. “The ones at St. Mungo’s move, but they’re too snooty to talk.”
Theodore brightened a bit, “Okay.” He pushed away his gloppy dish. “I think I’m finished.”
“What is it?” Harry asked finally.
Theodore introduced them to a trio of coal black rabbits, a dun coloured dove with a black band around its neck, a cage of plump brown rats, a ball python which told Harry adamantly that it wished to remain in the shop and was very frightened to leave, and finally a half grown kitten, very slight with sleek white hair and a black spot on her nose.
“They’re not alive,” Draco corrected gently. “The purpose of the portraits is to preserve wizarding history, so the charm that animates them scrapes a sort of impression from a living person, then after the person dies, their house creates the portrait. The portrait can give some biographical details of the subject and has a semblance of the subject’s personality.
“But I’m still working on my new Belle Brewer story. I can’t just stop; they’ve given me a big advance. I have to finish the book.”
“Of course I would.” After a moment’s thoughtful silence, Draco added, “I think I told you quite a bit ago that you’ve got me wanting something only you can give me. Now I’ve seen a play, I’m dying to see a Harry Potter play. You don’t have to write about lycanthropes, or anything you don’t want to, and you don’t have to write a play at all if you’d rather not. Obviously. You’re already great as it is. I just think. Here’s a historic space, all ready for you to step in and fill. Something we’ve never had before that you could give us. Something huge that isn’t. Tragedy. Or sacrifice. Something beautiful.”
Draco chewed thoughtfully, “I know people eat it? I believe it’s round, unless it’s like those strange little semi representational pictograms the muggles put on the lavs.”
When Harry woke almost too cosy the next morning, he thought that Draco was still asleep. He turned out to be mistaken. Draco was tucked up against Harry’s chest, his hair pooling out over both of them, his skin warm and soft and fragrant with sleep. Harry hugged Draco and kissed the hair that brushed against his lips, and Draco hmm’d sleepily and shifted to look up into Harry’s face.
“Shall I lay a fire?” Harry offered. “I know it’s a bit draughty in here.”
Malfoy looked pleased, “Did he? He didn’t seem to.”
Harry laughed too, “I’m really glad you’re here, Dud.”
Draco opened his eyes, “Maybe you need a new--oh here comes our server!”
“Yes, great. Monday. Morning, if you can. Round ten o’clock?”
“No!” Harry could feel himself blushing. “I mean yes. I mean. That’s not what I meant. Yes, of course I want to get along. I didn’t mean it like. Like before. I’m really sorry about that, by the way.”
Dean nodded seriously, “Your godson, right of course. Remus Lupin’s kid.”
Similar work had been done for the sitting room, the kitchen, and the library which Harry had decided he’d do his writing in. When he considered clearing out Sirius’s old bedroom for his own use, Harry found he felt absolutely ghoulish and couldn’t bring himself to go through with it. He locked the room instead and put his things in another of the guest bedrooms. It was much smaller, but it also felt significantly less haunted.
“He has pink hair,” chipped in Theo. “I should have asked him if he’s a metamorphmagus as well.”
“Oh,” said Harry, feeling very foolish. “Right. Erm, no he doesn’t live with us. I wouldn’t have someone move into our house without asking you.”
“You told me once that. No, I’m getting ahead of myself. Damn! I had it all planned out and you jostled it out of me.”
“Right, Hermione said,” Harry glanced over the leaflet, then pinned it to the notice board hanging on the wall beside the door beside the shopping list. “Thanks.”
Harry laughed, “You are being nice to me.”
Harry knelt on the hearth and put his head into the fire, “The Burrow.”
Harry set his spoon down and smiled, “Oh yeah? Do tell.”
Draco nodded emphatically, “Yes! Well, it doesn’t need to be about lycanthropes specifically, but yes it should be, and I’ll help you!”
“Huh. I suppose I hadn’t really thought about Belle falling in love,” Harry said slowly. “Dnno how I’d do with a romantic story.”
Instantly, the curtains over the portrait burst open, revealing Mrs Black’s painted face, contorted in impotent outrage, “
“I didn’t expect you would. It’s one of Hermione’s favourites, and she lent it to me because it’s so different from the sort of thing I write, and she thought it’d help me clear my head and relax. It’s sort of helping me with the romantical type bits I’m adding into my Belle Brewer story, though. It’s a love story. I’m quite enjoying it.” Harry paused, feeling he was doing more than his share of talking. Though of course, Draco couldn’t speak either way.
“Oi, be careful!”
They both sipped their tea and if either wiped their eyes on their sleeve, the other was too polite to notice.
“Mmm,” Harry said, glowing lazily. “I think I know what it is.”
, then?”
“How terribly flattering,” Draco murmured. “Do go on.”
“Yes, do come along Teddy,” said Molly brightly. “I’ve mixed you a Sweet Dreams potion, and if you wait much longer to drink it, you’ll be all groggy in the morning,” Molly’s voice was shrinking as she pulled back from the fire.
“It’d be quite eccentric of me to ask you out, if I did mind.”
“Er I would be remiss, and Theo would certainly think so, if I didn’t ask you to stay and have it with us. I cook other nice things, not only scones. My bread is nice. I could do you some beans on toast or a bacon butty.”
Malfoy had begun to cast the spell. Harry was too focused on his own task to make out the murmured words of the incantation, but he fancied he could feel a little warmth growing in his hands. Both the palm on the door, and the palm pressed to Malfoy’s. As if they were live circuits. There was a pleasant prickle of gooseflesh rising on the back of his neck.
“There’s a start,” said Ron bracingly. “Want me to speak to Hermione? She could probably find a book or something. Or knows someone you could talk to through the DRCMC.”
“Yeah!”
The more Harry thought about it, the more ideas rose to the surface of his imagination, scrambling against each other for position. “Yeah,” he broke into a slow smile. “Yeah, I think. Maybe I could.”
Ron swept up toward the front to unlock the shop door, “Well, they’re more like cursebreakers. They sniff out Dark objects and curses and hexes and Dark creatures and clear them out of your house. After the Ministry seized all those old Death Eater houses, they started popping up as contractors. Ask Dad; he’ll know all about it.”
“You’ll feel it in your hands. Just let it pass away like running water.”
Harry sprang forward and grabbed the top edge of Malfoy’s glove, just above his elbow and wrenched it down, forming a bag around the branch. To Harry’s relief, the glove and the branch came away with a tug, and though the branch writhed inside the glove and screeched in wordless fury, the glove held. Harry flung the whole thing back at the wooden box and shoved the pieces together. It reformed instantly, and the voice was silenced. Somewhere in the house, Mrs Black had begun screaming about cowards and blood traitors also.
“Inside this little cat-sized basket? No, actually. This is my Great Auntie Ursa. Shadowfax has just popped to Pret for some snacks, and she said she’ll meet us here, so look out for that.”
Harry straightened a cloak on its hanger and plucked a bit of lint off it, “That’s a bit selfish. His transformations can’t be far off at this point, and he doesn’t even know what they look like. He’s gotta be terrified, poor kid. Not knowing what to expect.”
“It wasn’t every night!”
When Harry returned to the room a quarter of an hour later with two plates of bacon and eggs and two cups of tea on a tray, Draco was sitting up properly, leaning back against the headboard. He was wearing the nightshirt and had clearly made some sort of effort to smooth his disheveled hair.
Harry took quite a long time to find Draco, eventually discovering him lying flat on his belly in a bathtub on the third floor. Draco found Harry behind a heavy set of drapes in the portrait gallery somewhat more easily. Harry found Draco in the pantry, and it turned out that he was hungry, so they stopped their game for a snack.
“Don’t be stupid,” Harry said lightly. “Thanks for letting me help.”
Malfoy looked away first, and Harry realised he’d stopped chanting, though he hadn’t dropped Harry’s hand.
Harry woke the next morning to the sound of rain, but realised quickly that it wasn’t the rain that had woken him when something small and light bounced off his forehead again. Harry startled and reached for his glasses. The something small was flitting about his head on little paper wings, and when Harry reached out and caught it, he saw it was a tiny scrap of parchment folded into the shape of an origami crane.
“I believe you’re right.” Draco pressed a damp kiss on him. “But look out, because I think it might be catching.”
Harry let go of Hermione, “Right, okay. So Malfoy’s a werewolf, and Theo, his cousin who he doesn’t really know is as well, and Theo’s boggart is a werewolf, and Malfoy just sort of turns up at my house to help me sort out the monsters and things there. It’s an awfully big coincidence, don’t you think?”
Harry leaned toward Draco across the table so that their knees pressed together under it, “Vapourised?”
“It’s called a Dark Detector,” Malfoy answered, drawing on the gloves. “It helps me find things that shouldn’t be there. Which room is yours?”
Distantly, they could hear Theo begin to play through the scales on the piano in the drawing room.
Malfoy looked up from his notebook, “I meant the trying to kill you bit, Potter.”
“It’s a bit difficult to explain,” Harry paused and tried to think what the best way was to explain a boggart to Dudley. Dudley had come a very long way, but he still didn’t much like hearing about Dark things at all. Harry didn’t blame him, especially since Daisy was only six. It was naturally a bit intimidating, imagining such a young kid coping with all that.
Draco tossed his head, “But at least we can work together, now. So there’s that.”
“So how’ve you all been?” Harry asked when he had clambered back into his seat.
“I’ll show you,” Theo offered.
“We should have breakfast,” Harry announced. “I’ll bring you something.” He stood up and paused, “Erm. Would you like me to bring you some pyjamas?”
“I think maybe a dove wouldn’t quite do,” said Theodore slowly. “Because of being so small. I think I’d want someone a bit more sturdy?”
Malfoy smiled, “Then he takes after you.”
Draco took the instructions to heart. He went back to kissing Harry’s chest, wet, sharp kisses up and down Harry’s torso that made Harry shiver and clutch at Draco. His hands scrabbled at Harry’s borrowed pyjamas, searching for ingress, popping off buttons, yanking down Harry’s pyjama bottoms.
“Blimey,” said Ron quietly.
“Of course,” Draco was gripping his left forearm again. “Well I ought to be off and  let you have your tea in peace.”
“There you are,” Harry said. “I’ll erm. Just leave you to it, shall I? I mean obviously I’m going to get you something to eat as well. Right. See you later.”
Draco laughed, “I’m afraid all the fish in that particular barrel have been shot long ago.”
“Well,” said Harry slowly. “I’ve kind of already fucked it up, actually. But I think I’m sorting it out.”
“All grimace-y and Chosen One-y.”
“I’d like to get you something,” Draco announced as they stepped into the cool darkness of the shop. “A post owl or a familiar. Whatever you like.”
“Mmm, tell me more about what you’ve seen, Potter. I’m all very handsome ears.”
Harry nodded, “Probably not a rat then, either?”
After breakfast, Harry went to his library to write. He got on well enough, but decided to leave it after a couple of hours and went back to the sofa with Pride and Prejudice. One of Draco’s little paper birds found him again just as he’d started to think about lunch.
Malfoy’s expression went rather opaque, “I’m afraid not. I really must be getting on.” He turned to Harry, hefting his notebook, “I’ll write it all up and owl you the order, then see you Monday?”
“Sorry to keep you waiting,” Harry called when he entered the room, trying not to sound stiff and grouchy as he whisked down the Floo wards with his wand. “I’ve been working and I lost track of the time.” The fireplace was already clouded with emerald green smoke, obscuring the figure standing in it. Harry made a mental note to arrange for the chimney to be cleaned.
“No,” said Harry, not laughing.
“There’s no werewolf thing,” Harry tried not to snap. “It was only a boggart.”
“Hi, yes. Very welcome. Should be done in a few minutes. Thanks,” Harry took the pinafore off anyway and tossed it onto the sofa before coming to kiss Draco hello on the cheek, “That okay?”
“I can use the owls at school. They have them, you know,” Theo said patiently, as if he was the one with years of Hogwarts experience already under his belt. “Or Godric.”
“Thank you,” said Theodore politely. “And I need some chalk as well.”
“I’ve decided something,” Harry’s godson announced, grave and bespectacled over ice cream. He was drabber than usual. Among wizards, he liked to match his hair to his clothes, but when he was with Harry in the muggle world, he turned his hair to its natural mousy blond. The matching habit and the natural colour both put Harry in mind of Tonks. It still twinged a bit some days, those little echoes of his friend in her son who had never known her.
“Scary,” Luna agreed, nodding. “But exciting.”
“Hmm, I was afraid you’d say that,” Draco shook his head sorrowfully.
“Yes, I know,” said Harry. “Safely in school and leaving all the cursebreaking to the grownups.”
“Yeah, I think I do,” said Harry. He could certainly feel something.
Theodore thought for a moment and smiled a crafty sort of smile that made Harry want to laugh, “Set fire to it?”
The dinner was delectable from start to finish, and when they stepped out onto the pavement afterward, it seemed perfectly right and natural, though it was thrilling, to take Draco’s hand and lace their fingers together.
Hermione nodded, “Exactly.”
“No, that isn’t what I mean!” Draco considered for a moment, “You said Belle Brewer isn’t you, and you wouldn’t want to write about yourself anyway, but. You also want to help people see into lives that aren’t their own. You should write a play. About us. Not you and me, but about our world, the world that already is. Help people understand that they’re not looking at all of it. Put it right in front of their faces, and make them see!”
Ginny smiled, “Yes, we had a nice chat.”
“Beautifully done,” Draco took the canvas from Theodore when he’d finished, rolled it up tight, and sealed the roll with his wand before tucking it into his bag. “I don’t suppose you’d help me finish with the rest?
Draco was going pink again, belying his nonchalant tone when he answered, “Excellent. I’ll collect you at half seven. Muggle clothes. See you tomorrow night.” He leaned in, and Harry’s heart began to riot in his ribcage, but at the last moment with a glance at the dregs of the crowd, Draco only squeezed Harry’s hand, then stepped back and Disapparated with a pop.
“No, sparkling’s fine. Thanks.”
“Good,” Malfoy had gentled his voice, in aid of Harry’s relaxation apparently. “Now look at me.” Harry obeyed, though it made his ears warm. “Good,” Malfoy murmured again and began to incant.
“Rosie’s five,” Ron began, then changed tack at the look on Harry’s face. “But I see what you mean. You’ll have to have another sweep. Or why don’t you hire one of those cleaner services?”
Ginny snorted, “I didn’t send you that valentine. It was clearly Malfoy, and he was too much of a coward to take credit.”
Draco didn’t respond apart from a slow thump of his tail, so Harry found  the book he’d been reading down the side of his armchair and squeezed onto the sofa next to Draco. Draco rested his lovely head in Harry’s lap, and Harry rested his book on top of Draco’s head and sipped his drink.
“You have such  a poetical mind, Theodore,” Draco said fondly, kissing Harry’s cheek as Theodore was on the other side of the table and not in reach. “I suppose you take after your godfather.”
“Yeah,” Harry agreed. “It’s sort of how I felt about Hogwarts when I found out I’m a wizard. The world seems a lot bigger when you’re allowed to look at all of it.”
“Oh, good,” Theo answered brightly.
“You’re so romantic,” Draco said with the air of one magnanimously forgiving a very great fault. And then he reached for his wand and conjured a handkerchief, with which he began delicately sponging his come off Harry’s chest and stomach.
Draco sat back on his haunches, his tail thumping hard against the kitchen floor, and cocked his head.
“Remember the badges, fourth year?” said Ron.
Harry noticed suddenly that he was starving, “Sorry to keep you waiting all night, Theo. I don’t much fancy cooking tonight. What if we went out for a kebab?”
“Is it really disgusting?” Harry asked, setting Draco’s plate on the table.
Harry grinned, “I’ll try and bear that in mind.”
“Well!” Draco was going pink again, “You must return the favour, then.”
Draco looked surprised, “Do you still want me to do it?”
“And my boggart,” said Theo with a shudder.
Harry got in beside him, “Hello. Ooh, you’re still cold.”
They had such a jolly Christmas that it went by very quickly. Andromeda and Draco and Dudley and Daisy all came to Christmas lunch at the Burrow. Theodore and Victoire were reunited with such exuberant clamour that they seemed to account for several children instead of only two. Ginny and Draco took to each other instantly, and Luna shocked Harry by remarking that it was because they were exactly alike. Daisy demanded that Draco read her the copy of
Harry was saved from having to think of an answer to that remark by Molly Weasley putting her head through the fire, “Everything all right? You’re still coming through?”
“Oooh thanks,” Theodore rested the bag on top of Twinkle’s basket, and she immediately began to rustle it with her claws. She did not seem to be enjoying King’s Cross.
“Thanks, good.” Harry let go of Theodore’s shoulder and sipped his coffee, “I’ll see if I can find my old-”
Harry decided he liked Kal.
“Then you had best come inside. Maybe stand on the mat until I’ve dried you, though,” Luna stepped back from the door to admit him and waved her wand to cast a Drying Charm over him as soon as he was inside.
“Well there’s the rest of the decontamination,” Harry said generously. “You never know.”
“Why does it make people unsafe for other people to find out they’re gay? Or why does it make people feel uncomfortable? If it’s just about liking people, why does it have to be such a big deal?”
“There was one more thing,” Draco said. “I’ve had an idea on how to involve Theo, since he wants to see some decontamination so badly.”
“Not sure I follow,” Harry said. “Hamlet’s already a play. I can’t just do Hamlet over again.”
“You’re ready now? Already?”
Harry glanced at the window, but all he could see was a scrap of dark sky, Venus glinting palely in the distance.
“You’re excused from lessons and homework for the three days following a transformation, but if you need more time than that, let me know and I’ll write to Professor McGonnagall. All right?”
Draco was quiet for a moment, like he was thinking how to answer, “Because I liked having things that no one else was allowed, and I thought he would give them to me if I sucked up to him. And because there were people I hated, and I thought he would hurt them and make them go away. And because my nasty parents expected it of me. And deep down because I knew he was dangerous, and I thought it was much safer to be with him than against him. It wasn’t,” he added. “It never is.”
They ambled along for a bit while Harry thought how to say what wanted saying. It was a remarkably fine evening, and it was very easy to be content in it.
“Good afternoon, Potter. It smells delightful in here. I hope it’s something I’m welcome to eat. By the way, you look cute in that pinafore.”
“I am a werewolf,” the welcome wizard agreed cheerfully. He tapped his own howling wolf badge, which he had pinned to his cap. It read IN THE PACK at the bottom in shimmering silver letters. “I usually call myself a lycanthrope, though. Most of us working here at the Centre are. Have you been in before?”
“You see me every day lately,” said Harry cheerfully.
Theodore was in his last year of primary school at the special school for magical children in Ottery St Catchpole, near the village where he lived with his grandmother. He usually walked to school, but since Number Twelve Grimmauld Place was a good deal farther away than Andromeda’s house, Harry had gotten a Portkey permit to let Theo come to school by Portkey every morning. Theodore had never used a Portkey before, so for his first morning, Harry decided to come along with him. They might have walked to school from The Burrow fairly easily, but Harry thought Theodore should be established in his new routine sooner rather than later.
“No,” Theodore patted Harry on the arm. “It’s all right to be gay, Harry.”
Harry realised he was gaping and wrenched his eyes to the floor, feeling conspicuous. Malfoy had on handsome black dragon leather boots, and Harry rather wanted a pair. They looked very practical. He was in his stocking feet and wished very much that he wasn’t. “I wasn’t expecting you,” he mumbled.
Draco pressed a hand to his heart and pretended to swoon, “Handsome on purpose, am I? Do tell! What am I doing on purpose to make myself so handsome, Potter?”
“Yeah? Do tell,” Harry was already smiling the special adoring smile that he got sometimes when he looked at Theodore so that Draco had to look away for a moment because it was too pretty to bear.
“Is this what you prefer? Do I have to manhandle you, for you to take me seriously?” Malfoy grit out, hands fisted in the front of Harry robes.
Draco looked sideways away from Harry, biting his lip, “You don’t hate him though, and I’m working on my prejudices. Also, I owed him one. Who knows what could have happened to you without him tipping you off about the dragons. It wasn’t that hard, just a few letters, a couple galleons, threats of a lawsuit, all under a pseudonym, don’t worry. There’s a reason that Rita goes after the people she does, she’s counting on them not knowing their rights within the media.”
“Yes, we also face allergic reactions after massive school events,” George teased.
The pair of them crept through the halls, holding in their laughter as they caught a plethora of other students trying to sneak back to their houses. As they got close to the Slytherin Common Room, Severus was patrolling but thankfully caught a 7th year the hallway away from the entrance and was too busy taking points and assigning detention to hear Draco muttering the password.
Severus pulled away and fixed him with a hard stare. “You acted like a true Malfoy man tonight, not like the man Lucius has become, things are only going to get harder from here. I cannot tell you what to do or how to handle yourself, but I implore you to do one thing.”

“I didn’t know what it was, but I definitely felt it. I should have recognized the feeling. I shouldn’t have brushed it aside…”
Draco directed his attention to the front of the maze as Dumbledore announced the champions. Draco cheered for Diggory and feigned boredom for Harry. Harry somehow found his eyes briefly in the crowd, shooting a quick smirk his way. Draco studiously ignored the butterflies that bloomed in his stomach.  Within moments Harry disappeared into the maze and nothing but adrenaline and determination flowed through.
Theo finally breathed a sigh of relief as he fell in step with a crowd of 6th years and made his way into the Common Room. He looked around as quickly as he could without drawing attention and spotted Draco in the corner with the other 4th years. He seemed distracted but not overly worried. He must have felt at least some of Potter’s attack, but it had ended so abruptly that he wasn’t quite worried as of yet. Or it might have been too far away. Of course Potter had been attacked on the exact opposite side of the castle.

Harry rolled his eyes and cast his Patronus. Draco stared at the gorgeous stag, still not comprehending. “My Patronus takes after my dad.”
“Madam Pomfrey?” Draco asked, straightening to his feet, pushing his idle thoughts of Weasley away.
“I’ll see you soon,” Draco promised to the empty room.
“You’re not going home?” Hermione asked.
Harry truly hoped he was right.
“I’ve said before that I’ve known so I was about 9 or 10, but I suspected before that. I just sort of realized that I was around all of these girls at the balls my mother would throw, and on the beaches in France, and I never felt the feelings Blaise and Theo were feeling. Even Vince and Greg would go on and on about girls, and I just never saw it. Instead I was looking at the men in their dress robes, or tanning on the beach. Father took me to a Harpies match and even got us into the locker room and it was just eh. I basically succumbed myself to marrying for duty until I felt your mark sear my chest. I didn’t think I would ever bond with someone romantically.”
Harry thought back to what Charlie had said, memories of the flames and the multiple dragon handlers trying to keep them under control. “No, he didn’t. Now you mention it, he definitely said he thought we had to just get past them. Then he said was that they were nesting mothers, and there was one for each of us. They were all different types.”
Everything had led up to now, Draco nervously pacing in the spare classroom near Gryffindor, utterly beside himself. Harry was mad at him, and he had every right to be. Although mad was sort of an understatement, Harry was absolutely furious with him.
“Yeah, sorry,” He apologized and Draco's smile widened, little crinkles forming next to his eyes. Harry felt the butterflies that normally came with Draco smiling at him, spring to life.
“I swear I’ll be right back,” Harry promised, robes in one hand.
“I wish you didn’t have to go,” Harry sighed.
“Hagrid,” Harry tried to say but realized his words were coming out weird.
“Hey, none of that, I’ve gotten over it. I’m so lucky to have you as my soul-mate. I wouldn’t have it any other way.”
Ginny and Luna were already staring at each other again, “Yeah, no problem, Hermione. Catch up with you later!”
“Oh, because I know the men who created it.”
going back to the Manor. He had a number of properties he could choose from, but there was still the manner of how he got to them. He also would not be going anywhere without Harry, and that meant getting Dumbledore to okay Harry not returning to his Merlin-forsaken relatives. Draco figured there was a better chance that Voldemort started galivanting with muggles than Dumbledore letting Harry not go back to the Dursleys. Draco would have to figure out a backup plan.
“Pans...” Draco warned.
I hope their coming out was okay. I rewrote it about a million times. Seriously my notebook is filled with about 10 different attempts. Let me know your thoughts. See you later this week for the LAST chapter! *eek*
“I’m not up to his standards, so he reminded me of my place. Nothing I’m not used to. It’s fine. You absolutely need to go. I’m well enough to get back to the Castle. Go find Harry. I’ll go to the classroom,” Draco said abruptly, like he didn’t like the words coming out of his mouth. “Please,” He tacked on after a brief pause and Hermione realized how completely miserable Draco sounded. All of his bravado and swagger had completely disappeared. She didn’t want to leave him alone like this, but knew how infrequently Draco said ‘please’ to people. He really needed a moment alone.
Draco was momentarily thrown off before it clicked, and he quickly re-buttoned his shirt. “You know who it is then.”
“Ah, Ron!,” Harry threw his arms out in front of him as he was pushed forward, Ron stumbling into his back. Harry collided with the body in front of him, the air temporarily knocked out of him.
Draco and his father were at a table and Hermione swore she could feel the atmosphere change around them with the rage tumbling off of Lucius. Draco, on the other hand, simply looked bored. The three of them found a table and Hermione went up to the bar to order, giving the happy couple a few moments alone. She also definitely wanted to eavesdrop on Draco’s meeting.
Draco was musing over the possibility when suddenly a beam of yellow light flashed across the grounds. Part of Draco realized who it was aimed at a moment before it made contact with Harry. Draco yelled out but not before he felt like he had been punched as Harry flew through up into the air. Hermione whipped around and shouted something that Draco belatedly realized was a Cushioning Charm as Harry fell back down to the ground about 25 ft away.
“Wait a second, the Second Task is at the end of February. The water is going to be absolutely freezing!” Harry pointed out, his voice going high pitched.
Draco was getting increasingly worried. Harry had faded somewhat, he figured due to how far away he was, but the hour was up and the gillyweed was going to wear off. Draco swore to Merlin if Harry drowned because of Weasley he would never forgive him.
Draco nodded, but Harry looked confused. “What do you mean about the size?”
“He’s all right,” Draco heard Blaise agree.
Draco stayed silent, not wanting to do or say anything that would make Harry stop. After awhile he couldn’t help himself, “Last I checked I have the moon and you have the sun. You’re the Light and I’m the Dark.”
“I wonder how he did it,” Theo said casting a look over his shoulder at Harry. Draco was grateful to be able to look over at the Gryffindor table uninhibited. Harry looked up at him, probably noticing the group of Slytherins staring.
“As we expected, he still insists Harry go back. It’s fine, I’m going with. Dumbledore can keep manipulating him, but I’m not putting up with the bullshit any longer. He said you have to go back. He didn’t say you need to spend 24/7 there. I just need to learn to Apparate and we’re golden. Anyways, I apologize Harry, I spoke over and for you a lot back there, which wasn’t okay.”

Pansy smiled at him, quickly kissing his forehead before heading back to the Common Room. He assumed she was abstaining from the trip simply to avoid his Father. Draco sighed and turned to exit the Castle. He had just made it outside when he felt himself being hauled backward into the shadows next to the front doors. Everyone outside was too excited at the aspect of going into Hogsmeade to notice.
Love, Alexis
(See the end of the chapter for
“Merry Christmas.”
Draco didn’t say anything, just stared at Harry in horror.
Harry felt anxiety rise up inside of him and his head flew up to look across the room again, Harry was beginning to be able to tell the difference between his emotions and Malfoy’s. The latter having a distinct ‘flavour’ that he could recognize as not his own. Malfoy was looking at Pansy, but kept shooting sideways glances at Harry. Harry sighed, as much as Malfoy tried to tell him he had to be more subtle, Malfoy was being as subtle as a flying brick.
“Isn’t the Lake, like, quite deep? I can swim okay, but I’m not brilliant.”
“I was almost sorted into Slytherin, you know,” He called casually before slipping quickly out the door.
Hermione was just glad Ron and Harry would at least complete their potion correctly. She also knew that while Harry looked annoyed on the outside, he absolutely loved the interaction with Draco, even if it were under false pretences. The show seemed to distract Draco for what was bothering him, at any rate. As far as Hermione concerned it was a win-win.
“That’s different. For his dad to have hit him like that, that’s messed up. Mum spanked me once when I was little, but you don’t hit your kids. Especially not once they’re old enough to go to school. That’s bang out of line,” Ron looked at Harry seriously, seeming like he wanted to say more. Harry wondered if Ron’s mind was drifting to the bars they had pulled off his bedroom window, or the letters pleading to send food if possible. He looked down at his eggs, hoping Ron would drop it. Harry was on edge already; he really didn’t want to talk about the Dursleys.
Harry was quiet awhile, “That’s completely awful, Draco, I’m sorry.” He finally whispered.
“We weren’t just going to leave it dusty and barren,” Draco scoffed.
“You threw frog brains at him in Potions yesterday,” Harry informed him and Draco bit his lip to keep from smirking.
“Do not let Dumbledore use you to get closer to the Dark Lord. He may or may not try. No matter what he says, do not follow through. He will make it seem of the utmost importance; he will make it seem as though Potter’s life depends on it. It does not. Do not let yourself be another pawn for Dumbledore to sacrifice.”
“That sounds perfect,” Hermione commented, glad she hadn’t had to make the suggestion herself.
“That is none of your business, now leave, I will not ask again!” Harry had never heard her so furious, but he didn’t move towards the doors. Draco looked even worse up close than he had in the corridor. Harry felt guilt gnawing at his chest. This was his fault.
“Sure, now that Potter is winning, Weasel comes crawling back,” Draco couldn’t keep himself from commenting.
“He really isn’t absolutely dreadful on a broom is he?” Theo commented and Draco did not dare to respond.
“Of course, Mr. Malfoy. Ribs are a tough mend, take a seat here, I’ll see what I can get for you.”
“You have absolutely ruined my robe,” Malfoy finally complained as they came to a still, Harry straddling Malfoy’s hips.
“Draco...” She said eyes fixed to his neck. “Have something you want to tell me?”
So, they were getting straight into it then? Draco hoped Harry’s meeting with Sirius was going better than his meeting, at any rate. Draco was mostly just thankful Harry wouldn’t be anywhere near the Three Broomsticks while Father was present. He had been overjoyed when Harry had told him his godfather had organized a visit for this particular Hogsmeade trip.
Draco would neither confirm nor deny the absolutely amazing feelings hearing his given name come from Harry’s mouth caused him.
Alexis
“Pans,” Theo commented, pursing his lips ever so slightly, hoping she took a hint. Her eyes narrowed infinitesimally and she grinned at him.
It was still relatively early, and a fresh breeze was floating through the front doors of the castle. Harry made a beeline through them, making his way towards the lake, hands shoved in his pockets. He imagined Sirius would not be too pleased with him walking around alone outside, but he couldn’t handle being inside any longer. Harry walked quickly trying to put as much space between him and the castle as he could, he noticed the further he got from Malfoy the less likely he was to experience his emotions. It was one thing for him to know Ron and Hermione were worried about him; it was another to feel that anxiety inside him.
“She is well, she regretted being unable to join us this afternoon,” Father said in a way that made it clear he blamed Draco for this. Like his behaviour had been so deplorable that he had forced his Mother not to come.
“Do you think Pomfrey would set me free?” He asked hopefully.
“You’re cute when you’re embarrassed,” Harry commented, before his eyes grew wide and he himself began blushing.
“They can’t, it’s being dramatic.” He assured Harry, “We just need to do research on spells or potions. I don’t know any potions off the top of my head, but I have this feeling I’m forgetting something. We still have plenty of time though,” Draco added, reaching up and dragging his thumb across Harry’s mark.
“We’ve got another lesson at the Ministry before our test. You could come to that and then set up more practice or your exam,” One of the twins said and Draco nodded in agreement.
“I’ll join you in just a second. Is Theo in the room?” Draco asked glad none of his peers were questioning him on where he was the whole night.
“I’ll be fine,” He attempted to tell her but wasn’t sure how clearly it came out.
“Do you have any idea how you make me feel?” Draco breathed, moving upwards to kiss and nip at Harry’s neck. “How much I want to mark your skin here so that everyone can see that you’re mine? How I wish our marks were somewhere harder to hide so that everyone would know that I am yours, and you are mine? How I want to shoot curses from across the Hall when I see Ginny Weasley touching your arm, entertaining the thought that you could be hers? Every day since we’ve kissed I’ve almost written a letter to my Father telling him to fuck right off. It physically pains me to not be able to proudly escort you to the Ball, even the thought of seeing you there with someone else makes me want to skip the thing entirely. You drive me absolutely insane.” He moved his lips to Harry’s, kissing him until he was gasping again.
“Ow, fuck.” Draco cursed, collapsing down onto the bench beneath him. The pain intensified before he felt a different pain in his ankle.
Draco had no idea how the fuck Voldemort had managed to do what he did, but he figured Fudge was too dumb to contradict him.
“Why?” She cried and Draco slid down the wall beside her.
“Thank you for ruining the moment, Ron,” Ginny groaned and glared at him. “Yes I like girls.”
“No thank you, Vince. I’ll let it heal on its own. If Lucius wants to create marks on my face, then I will oblige him and leave them there.”
“You didn’t truly think I was the one leaving those bruises, did you?” Another voice said and Draco looked up to see Pansy and Theo squeezing in on Draco’s other side. “So that was it? We’re officially broken up?”
Draco didn’t comment on the fact that Harry had just compared his muggle guardians to the actual Dark Lord, but he wasn’t here for a row. “Sure, sure, not all muggles are bad, whatever, hand me that rod would you?”
"Don’t get your knickers in a twist," Harry mocked him, pulling out the map and checking it. "There are some prefects about to pass your house, but other than that your path is clear. Pansy is pacing in your Common Room."
Draco was so incredibly fucked.
“Oh, thanks for the warning,” Harry said, running his fingers through his hair before patting his fringe down repeatedly.
Draco carried on with his ‘lesson’ and Harry and Ron were forced to silently take the instruction.
Draco stared at the sheets, “That’s because I didn’t want you to know. I blocked you from feeling it.”
“Sorry,” She apologized and Draco felt the onslaught of emotions Harry was feeling.
Why is this always his life? Harry questioned himself, hastily pulling his shirt back down. Thankfully everything was covered by his t-shirt, but he would have to kiss any vests or unbuttoning past the 2nd or 3rd button of his school uniform, goodbye. Once it got cold enough to wear the school sweater, that’d cover it well enough too. He wondered what Malfoy’s mark looked like. Normally the marks were opposites of each other, Seamus and Dean’s being fire and water. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were soul-mates, but their tattoos were more subtle. Mrs. Weasley had roots, and Mr. Weasley had a blossoming tree. Harry had never seen a mark take up as much space as his was. And he worried how much it would grow; he had barely had a growth spurt yet, unlike Ron who was already taller than Percy and quickly gaining on the twins.
“You’d be thick if you didn’t; it’s very obvious. I only want to say it because it’s manners, and I’m so polite.”
Harry insisted on assisting with the cursed object in Regulus’ bedroom.
Theodore peered over his arm obediently.
“Mmm,” Draco was too busy tucking in to be more eloquent, but Harry trusted he’d be very forthright about wanting anything more to eat.
“It’s your book,” Draco seemed to be feeling a little embarrassed as if he thought he might finally have overstepped. He ducked his head for a moment to tie his hair back up, then got up from Harry’s chair and raised his Dark Detector. Harry took Draco’s place at his desk, and smoothed out his outline for the book, pinning the corners to the blotter so that they wouldn’t roll up as he wrote. He scribbled notes and additions on the outline while Draco scanned the room with the Dark Detector.
Draco gasped and gave Harry a little shove, “I am beautiful as the day, and you repay me with slander.”
Harry started to laugh again, “I think I’m going to be sticky either way.”
Draco smirked, “Oh my absolute pleasure. Now do go on. It is very fucking delicious finally being able to impress you, Harry.”
“Whose boggart’s a werewolf?” Ginny asked.
“Let’s not split hairs about leverage,” Draco said loudly, then, “That play last night, Hamlet. That really got under my skin, and I can’t stop thinking about how you should do that. Not only for me I mean, for everyone.”
“Maybe we sh-”
Draco poured himself a little more tea, “I did know you. I should have said hello to you; I’m sorry.”
Hermione frowned a little, “Well, yes we did know, Harry. Malfoy’s part of this werewolf rights group, and he comes to liaise with the department sometimes. I see him around the Ministry, and they send him to offer testimony at depositions. He’s really well spoken, actually.”
Harry raised an eyebrow, “Have you?”
The most comfortable, cheerful room in the house was still the kitchen, and it was there that Harry and Theodore arrived by Floo after they left the ice cream parlour. Theodore looked round approvingly, taking in the braided rugs Luna’d given Harry to cover the unforgiving stone floor, the burnished copper cookware on the rack above the stove, the cheery yellow bowl of apples on the broad wooden table, the pothos already beginning to creep out of its dangling basket.
“You’re a cheat is what you are. I’ll bet you glamoured these scones.”
Theodore nodded, and Harry held in a sigh.
“I’m all right,” Draco said. Then, “Don’t laugh.”
Harry swigged again, “Well he’s only eleven. His ideas about adult relationships are limited.”
Hermione drew her chair in closer and leaned toward Harry, “You might try and-”
The faint spots of colour on Malfoy’s face brightened into a vivid pink and his silvery eyes sparkled with anger. But instead of shouting back or pulling out his wand, he drew a long breath through his nose and blew it out slowly, “We’re not sixteen anymore, so
Harry’s ears were getting hot, “Those two things happened like sixteen years apart! And it wasn’t a nice valentine! He was making fun of me.”
“Theodore,” Draco said seriously. “This is going to be a lot to cope with. I don’t pretend it won’t be. You will feel ill and tired at inconvenient times. And there may be some people who treat you differently or even who don’t like you. If someone is cruel to you, you should speak to your head of house. Or write to Harry. You don’t have to put up with it all on your own, and there are grownups who can help you. But you will also meet people who are going to like you and love you and not mind that you’re a bit different. You’re a wonderful person, and the lycanthropy is part of that, because it’s part of what makes you who you are.”
Ron shrugged, “She’s not getting any gayer.”
“It seems like a stupid thing to get cross with people for, though. Being gay.”
“Your dad taught me,” Harry said quietly. “Boggarts can’t actually hurt you; they’re just a bit territorial and like to scare you off, if they can. They’re telepaths, and they look into your imagination and turn into whatever they think’ll frighten you most. I’m really sorry. I didn’t know that one was still here. It was a new cupboard and everything. I must’ve missed it when I was cleaning.”
“Harry bloody Potter!” Dean came out from behind the counter to wring Harry’s hand and give him a friendly slap on the back. “It’s been ages. I nearly didn’t know you under all that hair! You’re not cutting it yourself, are you? One word for you: lineup.”
“Ah excellent,” said Draco in a stage whisper when Theodore met them where indicated a few minutes later. He walked a little ways down the corridor til he came to a portrait with dark, heavy curtains hung over it, Harry and Theodore just behind him.
“Don’t you think it’d be a bit ungrateful of me to let you risk your life over it and then tell you you’re not good enough to see it through to the end?”
“We didn’t catch any monsters, but we did find a curse and get rid of it. That’s how I got hurt, actually.”
Harry laughed, “Well, I don’t think it’s going to come to that.”
“Yes, and it isn’t at all dangerous, though it’ll probably be a bit loud.”
“Of course.”
Draco wanted to go to bed straight away. Harry followed him to the bedroom and got into a borrowed pair of pyjamas while Draco washed and cleaned his teeth. Harry went into the bathroom next, and when he returned to the bedroom, Draco was already chin deep in his big white bed with Shadowfax purring loudly on his knees.
“You don’t consider yourself integrationist for instance?”
Hermione joined in, “‘
“Yeah, I just wish they’d let me have a broomstick,” Theo glanced at Harry. “I already know how to fly.”
Harry stared at him.
“I just. Something ha--er it occurred to me recently that you might have thought I was upset that you’re gay, but that wasn’t. I’m not. I wasn’t.”
Draco handed Twinkle’s basket back to Theodore when they were all through to Platform 9 ¾. Theodore took it absently, but his eyes were fixed on the scarlet steam engine.
Theodore smiled almost carelessly, “Okay. I know. Me too.” His genuine casual assurance made Harry feel so bursting with affection that he thought he might well up. He gave Theo a hug instead and didn’t even mind a quick swipe of claws through the basket from Twinkle.
Malfoy licked jam off his finger and after a moment’s thought, took another scone, “Milk, please. Milk first please. You don’t sound sorry.”
Harry was so flooded with affection for his godson that it brought tears to his eyes. He reached out and squeezed Theo’s shoulder,  “I’ll be fine, darling. I’ll have a Living Peace, if I have to.”
“I suppose he couldn’t manage a Ridikulus without even his own wand,” Draco remarked thoughtfully.
“Very true,” Malfoy said quietly. “To think it slipped my mind that I’ve been looking for an opportunity to thank you.”
“Yes, you’re fearless and smart and funny and talented and. Really handsome. I noticed that ages ago. Obviously. And then I saw your face on that fucking Witch Weekly cover that fucking Astoria showed me, and I about fucking vapourised.”
“Do what?”
Draco laughed and put his mug of tea down in front of him on the table, “Relax. Everything is fine.”
“Harry! Oi! Harry!”
Theo narrowed his eyes at Harry suspiciously, “I feel like you’re teasing me.”
Harry nodded, “You said something about a leaflet?”
“Excellent!” Draco squeezed Harry’s forearm emphatically. “I was hoping you would.
“Of course!” Harry reached across the table and patted Theodore’s shoulder. “Is it all right if I sometimes call you Theo?”
“How do you mean? What sort of social ills?”
Harry turned to look at Malfoy. His face had gone very white, and he was gripping his left arm, where the branch had caught at him. His Dark Mark was an angry red under the pitting of the bite scar, as if it had been burned.
“What’s that?” asked Theo eagerly.
“And now when I get scared, my poor old brain is too clever for its own good and thinks something really bad is going to happen. So it puts me through my paces in my dreams to make sure I’m ready to cope with whatever the bad thing is that’s going to happen. My healer calls it a trigger. It’s like a little thing or a not very bad thing that makes your brain afraid of the really bad thing so you get nightmares or you feel panicky.”
Harry laughed, “I’m trying to say that I can’t just be all helter skelter this time, even though I’d really like to. Er.”
. Do you know it?”
“I expect you’d be doing all the work, actually,” said Harry, feeling guilty again for reasons he could not fathom.
Harry’s ears warmed, “You’re the one who brought up letters.”
Harry burst out laughing. Ginny laughed, too, and Luna slipped off her chair to hug and kiss them both, and then Hagrid swept them all into a crushing hug and Fang woke up and started barking. In the middle of the scrum, hugged and kissed and still laughing, Harry was beginning to think maybe he could at least try.
Draco rummaged in his bag and pulled out a corked flask, “You have no idea. Erm, Potter I really ought to take my last dose of wolfsbane. Could I borrow a good sized cup?”
Kal lit up, “Draco? Do you know Draco Malfoy?”
Theodore looked at Harry, his face full of concern, “Will it give you bad dreams, Harry? Talking about it?”
“Behave yourself,” he told him. “Don’t sleep through breakfast, and don’t make yourself look like professors and cancel lessons.”
“Oh,” Harry said. “Okay.” And he kissed Draco’s cold mouth to show that he wasn’t making that particular mistake at all.
“It’s when you ch-”
“Teddy, darling you’ve grown! You’ll be taller than I am when I come out of here. And with your hair aubergine like that, you remind me so much of your mother,” Andromeda Conjured a handkerchief and dabbed her eyes. “She favoured purple at your age as well. You do look very like her. And off to Hogwarts next week! I can hardly believe it! Where did my little Teddy go?”
“It’s okay. I didn’t mean to be rude either.”
Harry hesitated, then added, “It turned into a werewolf.” Ron let out a low whistle. “I know. It wasn’t even a real werewolf, it was like. This horrible. Half man half wolf thing. A monster. It was awful.”
“Imagine that,” said Ron almost under his breath.
“You know what I mean. Do you want me to talk nicely to you?”
Theodore shrugged, “Yeah, you’ve said.”
“That’s good.”
“No?” Malfoy consulted his watch. “We did say four? Or perhaps you thought Mr Flyspring meant the other four o’clock? I do try and get him to use 24 hour clock in correspondence, but he’s a bit set in his ways.”
“Fine what?”
“You’re looking happier,” Luna sat down as well. “Have you sorted things out?”
Hermione shook her head emphatically, “We talk about you sometimes because we love you, Harry!”
Behind them, the Floo hummed, and they stepped out of the way in time to avoid Theodore jumping out of the fireplace.
“I gave it back,” Harry murmured.
“Just thought I should know what you’d prefer in advance.”
“They’re nice there,” Theo said. “We’ll probably go back.”
“Sure, of course. Erm Theo. If you have any questions or you want to talk about anything. Just. Just tell me. We can talk about anything, okay?”
“No!” said Draco furiously. “If you steal my thunder, Harry Potter-”
Draco was in bed when Harry went back to the room, his hair more disheveled than ever, but he smelled minty as if he’d just cleaned his teeth.
“No! I was just. Curious.”
“Helter my skelter?” Draco suggested.
“You could write me a note,” Theo wheedled. “My teacher’s had the copy of Witch Weekly with you on the cover sticking out of her bag for a week.”
“We’re nearly there,” said Draco. “Do you know Shore?”
Harry could feel his ears warming again, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Harry noticed that music had struck up somewhere in the near distance, though he couldn’t see who was playing it. A sweet flute over the thrumming of a harp. “This place is incredible,” he said again.
Harry’s grin stretched so much that he thought the corners of his mouth might meet round the back, “You’re not being serious.”
“Yeah?”
“Well, I wouldn’t have lived through it all if Harry hadn’t rescued me, actually. And I’d realised beforehand that the life I was living wasn’t getting me any of the things I wanted and that if I did survive, I’d have to figure out another way to live. And. After being around so much suffering, I just didn’t want to be a part of it anymore. I was very, very lucky because I got another chance. Most people who did what I did died doing it.”
Theodore considered, “Well it should be something sort of simple, because they usually are. And something that’s to do with all of us together. I’m not sure the Den works for that. You’re not really a wolf, Harry. Sorry.”
“Mm,” said Ginny in a too polite to be doubtful tone, her eyebrows raised.
“Harry took loads of pamphlets,” Theo remarked in an indulgent sort of tone, as if it had been well beside the point but harmless enough not to begrudge Harry his collection.
“If I give you permission to take them away, can you get them out of here?”
“It’s okay,” said Harry. “Thanks.” He gave Hermione a hug and she buried her face in his shoulder, “It’s okay, Hermione. Don’t cry. I’m sorry.” Ron patted them both.
Malfoy frowned, “Well. It’s been all right so far. But no, no I think you’d be better off with a ward. It’d be irresponsible of me to go away without warding it.” Malfoy took off his bag and set it down on the floor,  “Are you familiar with partner wards?”
“Yes,” Harry said, nearly before Draco had finished speaking. “Kiss me.”
“Nobody’s teasing you; that’s what happened. Pick your things up, please and put them away.”
Draco huffed irritably, and it was such a deeply Dracoish sound that Harry laughed again.
“And that er. That arrogance really serves us because it lets us think we’re justified in doing whatever we like to anyone who can’t stop us. So inasmuch as I’ve never seen anything that would convince me that wizarding society could rise above that very useful arrogance enough to overturn the Statute of Secrecy at any point in my lifetime, I’m not an integrationist. But I’d be very pleased to be wrong, so I suppose you could say that’s quite integrationist of me. I didn’t invent Belle’s world in an attempt to change ours into hers by sheer force of will. I invented it because I thought it would make for an interesting story.”
Harry made a sort of squawk that he refused to be embarrassed of, “Yes, you’re incredibly vicious, and I’ve definitely learnt my lesson. Please do it again!”
“Oh?”
“Fine,” said Draco.
The hostess showed them to a table that looked as if it had been cut from the stone of the islet, “Your server will be with you shortly.” And then she was gone. Harry didn’t see where she disappeared to.
Harry laughed again, “I’m starting to suspect you don’t have the slightest interest in avoiding my chaffing.”
“No, actually it solves some of my problems. Love is erm. It’s a powerful motivating force for that type of lasting fixation. And platonic love doesn’t typically arise from so little information, so an infatuation or attraction is a good catalyst. And also if they’re a couple at the end of this book, it gives them an automatic reason to work together in the next book. The story makes more sense if Belle is falling in love with Diana.”
Harry laughed, “That’s literally exactly what a pet is, Malfoy.”
“It’s all right,” Draco said. “I know you didn’t. No, I wasn’t bitten by the brooch. That’s a werewolf bite. Though I did get it for essentially the same reason. Cowardice. Treachery.”
“Just a bit of residue here and there. The room’s been well cleared already.”
“No,” said Harry, quite surprised. “Are you actually sorry?”
“She’s definitely not my Ginny anybody.” Harry laughed, “Am I the only one who you still call by their surname?”
“Good,” said Theodore, an expression of beatific satisfaction falling over his face. “I bet it helps you loads.”
“Good,” Malfoy holstered his Dark Detector and got out his notebook. His falcon feather quill flashed across the page, “I don’t suppose you know anything about the former occupant?”
Malfoy smiled rather sardonically, “Not by name. It was ever so subtle. She called you Little Teddy’s Godfather like you were the Minister of Magic or something. No name needed.”
“Yes!” Harry gasped. “Yes, where do you want me?”
“Rabbits can be a bit delicate as well,” Draco advised. “I had to keep Scorpius in my dormitory mainly, which is likely why you didn’t know anything about him, Potter.”
For some reason, the melting jelly feeling seemed to be coming back, “You’re ridiculous.”
Theodore lit up, “Are you a werewolf? I’m a werewolf!”
“I’m not helpless! I can throw things,” Theodore said staunchly. “And shout. Harry said that’s the thing to do if I see a monster. Yell my head off, and he’ll run and help me.”
“Well there’s plenty of everything. Want some wine?”
“Thanks, Dud. I know. But I’ve engaged a service that comes to your house and finds all the curses and monsters and gets rid of them, but you’ll never guess who turned up.”
“I’m really sorry. I hate that I was that way to you.”
“Yes,” Draco nodded fervently. “Yes.”
Harry and Theodore escorted Malfoy to Theo’s bedroom. Malfoy set his bag down and prowled about the room with the Dark Detector held out in front of him.
“Yes, but it was meant to be a surprise, so mind you don’t tell anyone!”
“I think I’m too cynical to be a proper integrationist. Too much of our culture is built on the idea that we’re important because we have magic and maybe that we’ve been chosen to have magic because we’re important or because we’re already special. We’re special because we have magic, and we have magic because we’re special.
Harry waited for her to say more, but she didn’t. “Well. That’s good. Rest is important.”
“I turned up and surprised you,” Malfoy said, ticking off on his fingers. “But I did get the chameleon ghoul out of Theodore’s room. No charge. And you shouted at me and asked me invasive questions, but then you gave me these extremely nice scones. So I can’t take any with me, or you’ll be ahead.”
“The valentine was Ginny!” Harry said loudly.
The sound of it made Harry wince, and he clenched his fists against the urge to extend a comforting but useless hand.
“I had both,” Draco offered. “Scorpius my rabbit and my owl Achilles. Achilles was more like a colleague, though. Bit of a dick at times, really. ‘Scuse my language, cousin.”
Harry was wondering idly if offering cake would be showing off, when Theo put down the last bite and a half of his sandwich and looked at Draco.
Ginny looked round, “What have I done this time?”
“The basic idea is that we construct the ward together, and it requires our mutual presence and consent to take it down, so leakage is nearly impossible. It’s extremely secure, and it should make sure no harm comes to you or to my cousin until I have the chance to remove or destroy whatever that nasty thing is in there.”
Harry grinned, “I think I can manage snuggling.” He leaned over and kissed Draco on the temple, since he had gravy on his lip, and Harry reckoned he might like to keep it for himself. “What if you need the loo? While you’re transformed?”
“It’s nothing to do with romance. She’s almost like my mum; she basically raised me. She was actually the first witch I ever met. So obviously I can’t let her down, even if I’d rather be writing than written about. Can’t disappoint Molly.”
“Scientists are calling it pasta.”
Harry let out a harsh sort of laugh. He didn’t know what to say. Malfoy pushed his sleeve up again and gripped his forearm as if it itched but he couldn’t scratch it. Harry reckoned he must be thinking of his Dark Mark and tried not to stare.
Harry smiled looking up into Draco’s flushed, happy face framed in sweaty tangles of silvery golden hair and was so overcome with affection that he couldn’t speak. He took Draco’s hips between his hands and rocked his own hips up, pushing slowly into Draco’s body. Draco sank down, his eyes shut, and they sighed in unison.
“Everyone is at first,” Draco said gently. “It isn’t the sort of thing you just know intuitively if you’re a decent person. You have to research. I wasn’t impugning your. Dadship.”
“The book really helps,” Theo repeated bracingly. “I expect it’s still a bit scary to you. It was to me. I was really scared. But Harry and Draco have been helping me understand it better, and now I know what’s going to happen to me and I’m not scared anymore. And I know how to look after myself. That helps too.”
“Liar. You couldn’t look more delighted if you tried with both hands and a Lumos. How’s the third one coming on?”
“So touchy,” Draco sighed. “Actually I didn’t buy the magazine because of your face. I was dying to read what you had to say about the books, of course.”
“Excellent,” Harry knocked his ice cream dish against Theodore’s like a little toast.
Draco cocked his head to the other side, and Harry decided to take it as an affirmative.
“Out with it, then,” Ron prompted presently. “What’s the problem?”
“He could do worse.”
“Yeah?”
“I’ve an. Awkward request. Burning with desire as you obviously are, every time I utter your name. Do you think we could er. I tend to find sex quite erm distracting, so if we could keep that side of things rather tame for a bit?”
“I’ll get them for you,” Harry offered. “Where are they?”
“Well you can read a bit of it, if you like,” Harry said nonchalantly.
“Then I need advice,” Theodore said rather dramatically, pushing up his spectacles. “Everyone here is too cute. You’ve got to help me work out which I like best.”
“Certainly I can have a look,” Malfoy said to Theo. He set his satchel down on a table and opened it to withdraw a pair of black dragon leather gloves and a golden instrument that looked like a television aerial.
“Nah, well still in London, but I’m over on Grimmauld Place now. I needed the extra room. How’s Seamus?”
Draco shunted Shadowfax gently to the floor, and stood, shrugging off his dressing gown. He was panting hard, a soft whine coming up in the back of his throat. Harry noticed suddenly that there was dense, silver fur rising on Draco’s limbs. Draco doubled over with a deep groan, and Harry could hear painful cracks as his bones stretched and shifted.
“I’ve had an idea,” Theodore told them presently.
Harry offered his arm, “Are you ready to go?”
“I’m not hungry,” Harry said hastily, catching eyes with Ginny. “Thanks, though.” He took the seat Luna’d brought him after she regained her own.
Draco had the grace to look embarrassed at that and the manners to apologise, “I’m sorry. Of course not. I only meant. I’m not here to contaminate your godson with the evils of our forebearers. I know what you're afraid of, and I promise I don't want to be a bad influence on him.”
Theodore looked at the red marks seriously, “How could it do that if you weren’t a follower?”
“It really isn’t decent to have a kip at eight o’clock in the morning, Harry,” Draco said when Harry woke again.
Harry grinned, “I baked them.”
“Are you really all right, darling?” Harry stroked Draco’s hair back from his face. “You don’t have to say yes. We can talk about it.”
“Oh good,” said Theodore.
Harry was in the kitchen checking on his steak and kidney pie when he heard the hum of the Floo in the sitting room.
“I’m rude, but it doesn’t mean Theo should be.”
They found Shadowfax waiting for them when they returned to the sitting room. Draco seemed ready to relax for the time being. He clambered onto the sofa, and Shadowfax followed him and sat on the armrest near his legs. Harry decided to relax as well.
“Nah, just a little. You’re cute when you sleep.”
“It’s Malfoy, isn’t it?” She asked and Harry nodded dumbly. He knew she had already figured it out. “When did this happen?”
Malfoy snorted, and Harry was worried he really was going to puke, when Malfoy brushed his hair out of his face Harry saw he had been laughing. “How can you even look at me? Comfort me? You should curse me, I fucking deserve it,” Malfoy spit venomously.
“Come on, Hercules,” Draco called, putting out his arm. His Eagle Owl was high in the rafters and soared down to them, clutching a note in his talons. “He must have just gotten back.”
“I don’t like when people try to heal me,” Harry shrugged. “Look is this how it’s going to be? You sneaking up on me in bathrooms? Worrying about me?”
“Hi,” Harry coughed, his throat feeling like sandpaper.
“Thanks, Ron, but I’m fine, I swear.”
The Canary explosion the following morning pretty much washed all talk of Draco or Lucius from the school. Everyone was instead marvelling over the magical brilliance of the Weasley twins. Blaise Zabini had returned to his normal self at dinner time. Harry was still wondering what Zabini had done to piss them twins off so badly, but wasn’t too bothered about the Slytherin’s misfortune.
“You’re not mad at me, right?” Harry finally asked, his voice hesitant. Draco whipped around to face him fully, brow furrowed.
Once again I will thank you all for the out-of-this-world response. It's absolutely insane that we broke 500 kudos. I never in a million years thought I'd get this kind of reaction. It really makes my day. I worked from 7am until 730pm today and I actually looked forward to getting home and posting this chapter. Yall are the best.
“I would thank you to not do that without my permission, Professor,” He said underneath his breath, knowing Dumbledore would hear him.
“The Durmstrang champion is Viktor Krum!” Dumbledore’s voice rang out and Draco clapped, Blaise elbowed him, cheering as well.
“Harry, I’ve known I was gay since I was, like, 9 or 10. Why do you think I was so adamant my Father not know you were my soul-mate?”
“How are you?” Harry asked. When he had met Sirius in the cave over a month ago, he had been almost skin and bone. Now after a month of steady meals and being back around people. He was practically a brand-new man. He looked much more like the pictures from Harry’s parent’s wedding.
“The Tournament as a whole has not been the most fun on the pain scale. It’s one thing to worry about a person, it is a whole different world when you share their pain.”
“Okay, I’ll give you that one,” Ron muttered.
Harry nodded, “The magic is getting easier, I don’t have to concentrate as hard.”
Harry frowned, “What does that mean?”
“Sorry, merpeople,” Harry corrected himself. He looked up at his wand, pressing one of his hands to Draco’s mark and reached his other out towards his wand, trying to summon it again. His wand obediently soared across the room and into his hand. “Are you kidding me?!”
Draco appraised the Mark on her forearm, his mind drifting to the others.
Please give me your thoughts on this final chapter, I will dearly miss you all and will be reading and rereading each and every comment you write. Seriously thank you for such an amazing ride. See you again soon.
Draco did as he was told, anxiety flaring inside of him.
Draco had gotten him a journal, one of which he had a matching twin for. They would be able to write to each other through the journals, and there were charms on them so that no one would be able to read the contents except himself and Harry. After what had happened in second year, Draco knew Harry was most likely going to have a little trouble writing in a journal that wrote back to him. When he had pitched the idea to Hermione she had given him the full history of what had happened previously, but he was hopeful his note and Hermione would be more than enough. Draco was also quite excited at the aspect of being able to communicate to Harry outside of their sparse meetings.
With everything going on, Draco tried not to feel too badly. With Crouch Sr showing up raving mad on the grounds last week, and then the dream that Harry had had in Divination earlier this week, Draco was ready for this school year to be over now. Especially with his plan having worked.
“Put your hand on his chest, quickly now,” Pomfrey ordered, making elaborate moves with her wand, some potions flew from across the room and settled onto the table next to her. She thrust one at Harry, “Drink and brace yourself.” Harry did as he was told and then immediately cried out as Draco gasped beside him. His hand felt as though he had set it onto Aunt Petunia’s stove while making breakfast where he held it to Draco’s mark.
“It’s a muggle ice pack, it’s all I could think of,” Harry apologized, carefully settling it against Draco’s face.
Draco leapt at the chance, turning around and raising his eyebrows, “I’m cute?”
Dumbledore inclined his head and then left the Ward without a second glance. Draco set his head back against the pillow, grasping harder at his Mark, desperate to feel anything at this point. Harry was only a pace or two away, but Draco had never felt further. Draco was shocked to feel tears pricking at the corners of his eyes. He quickly blinked them away, he could not afford to break down right now. Harry was okay. Pomfrey had been in her office for quite a bit of time, she wouldn’t have left him alone if he weren’t stable. Dumbledore wouldn’t have left.
“I think I can last a few minutes without you,” Harry teased and Draco nodded before following Severus from the room.
Harry suddenly understood why Draco had reacted the way he did. Harry couldn’t accurately describe what he was feeling, but knew he had never felt this good before in his life. Draco continued for a few more moments before letting up, Harry collapsed back against the ground, breathing heavily.
“Magic is weird,” Harry commented, chancing a quick glance over at Draco. Draco and the other fourth year Slytherins were still staring over at them, as were many eyes in the Hall. Public bondings always gathered attention. The skin around Draco's eyes softened minutely as Harry looked at him. Harry couldn’t shake the image of Ginny and Luna leaving the Hall, hand in hand. He desperately wished his bonding would have been as easy and carefree as Ginny’s.
“Is that the bottle cap I gave you at the Cup?” Draco asked, surprise in his voice.
Draco demolished another desk and took a deep breath. Now was not the time for that. He had to steady himself. His soul-mate needed him. Draco repaired the two desks and sat down on top of one; he took deep breaths and cleared his mind like Severus had taught him. He tried to send soothing and calming feelings through the bond, and then he waited. He distracted himself by banishing the dust from the room and practiced summoning pillows for lack of anything else productive to do.
“Thanks. I was coming back from training and then out of nowhere some of the boys from Beauxbatons grabbed me. They took my wand and put me in a body bind. Of course, my wandless magic was fucking useless without you there. At that point I figured the only way I was getting out of it was if you felt it somehow. Then they beat me up a little bit and said some bullshit about me not deserving to be a champion, like I even wanted to in the first fucking place, and then they used Crucio,” He took a deep breath, remembering the sheer agony he had been in.
Harry’s mind wasn’t quite working the way it should, he felt ... sluggish. Slugs... Wait, Hagrid. Hagrid could help them. Harry didn’t know what had happened to the Beauxbatons students who had hurt him, but he knew they wouldn’t mess with Hagrid.
“I only know them vaguely, but I think they were both hoping it would happen. It’s Imogen’s birthday today,” Ginny clarified.
“I’m sorry I took so long, I had to make appearances in Hogsmeade, and then Hagrid had to speak to me.” Harry gasped, throwing his Cloak off.
“I doubt the two of us will ever be best mates but we have to at least be able to tolerate each other. I understand anyone’s apprehension about my relationship with Harry, but he’s my soul-mate and I’d do anything for him, full stop. I hope to prove to you my worthiness of Harry now that you are all aware of our relationship.” Draco said the final words of his declaration with his eyes fixed on those of the black dog taking up the foot of Harry’s bed. Sirius licked his hand and Draco wasn’t sure how he should feel about that. He was sure he would hear more from Sirius once he wasn’t bound to his Animagus form.
Draco smirks, a hand smoothing his black suit leg. “Because I've known you forever, and I'm your friend, Potter. I know you more than most do.”
Harry trembles under his own shaking fingers, the liquid in the bottle sloshing to confirm it.

He can't see Malfoy staring at him, but he feels the face near his, their noses brushing.
And he wants that Gryffindor heart all for himself, here in his palm that rests upon Harry Potter's chest.
The time for his heart's introduction to the world is coming, though. He feels it rapidly approaching, and when he sneaks out of the dorm to the alcove, desperately needing some relief from the thoughts Potter constantly inspires in him now, Draco knows the tipping point has come.
He has no idea what it is that he's waiting for, but his gut says he will know when the time comes. And in the meantime, Harry's nearly lost his mind with dreams of Malfoy smirking at him around Zabini at dinners, of Malfoy slyly glancing his direction in the library, and of himself finally cornering the fucking snake against a hallway in the dungeons, gripping his fingers in that pale hair and kissing Malfoy's sneer away.

“I...I want...I've thought of...Merlin, Potter, make it so,” he whispers above Harry once. And once is enough.
. Ego aside, Merlin, it sounds like you're sick or something,” Draco teases and reaches up, taking advantage of the joke to press his fingers to Harry's warm brow. “Should...have you checked, Potter.”
“Point stands, Potter. Put out or shut up.” Brows arch his way, and Draco, entirely embarrassed for the bit of

Harry sits on the window ledge next to his bed in the Gryffindor dormitory, staring outside and feeling frustrated. Because not only are they both up to something, but now Harry feels...weird.
Potter stares at him a little longer, the green eyes warm and searching him for something Draco doesn't quite know, and then the Chosen One shifts slightly to look back at the setting sky. He watches Potter blink a few times, curiously, before Harry states, “Honestly, I suppose that's true.”
He tries to sniff again, gets a little more air through his nose this time, and sighs long and low. “Because, Harry. I'd only be in their way.”
, it still means more than he imagined it might. He doesn't feel so alone, ironically, despite the one he's wanted wanting another.
I hope you quit chasing ghosts and stop living for narrative's sake.
Harry briefly checks his watch, waits for the ticking arms to cross at two-thirty in the afternoon, and when they do he looks quickly to the magicked Map upon his lap, green eyes roaming for that name that's haunted his sleep so heavily for months, if not secretly for years before that.
He glares in the dark, smacking his brow with a small

Draco rolls his eyes, elbowing Zabini next to him as the bastard starts to drift off. If
While the need to know Malfoy's secret is burning hotly within him, Harry feels strangely jealous of Zabini's sudden behavior and equally, bizarrely, protective of Draco Malfoy, too.
Draco instantly stands, fighting the looks and gushing around him, and he pauses at the base of the small steps when he hears a single voice speak above the rest.
Draco hangs his hand between them, sighing as the bottle is passed back. He drinks from it, keeps the bit of cough down as his nose clears for a slightly longer passage of time, and he blows air into his fringe. “Well, it's a thing with the Purebloods and all. We don't

“No. Lovegood is lovely and all, but no.”
“Besides Lovegood, I doubt it. It seems the two of us are more...sensitive to your moods, for whatever reasons.”
“Gotta get him out of your system, hm?” Blaise teases, but genuinely feels a little bad as his friend flinches.
Harry hisses under his breath and invisibility cloak as he follows Malfoy towards the strange magicked spot, only to be stopped by Blaise Zabini grabbing Malfoy's arm and taking him elsewhere determinedly.

that bum of Potter's really is.
Even he follows Draco a bit after Charms, laughing to himself when Malfoy veers straight for the library and not the alcove, and Potter stares after his friend, completely confused.
“I know, believe me. I guess what I'm saying is that after years of thinking on it, I think part of me was...attracted...to Cedric, you know? A little, anyway.”
Green eyes flare in surprise when Malfoy's little feet start to move suddenly, leaving the Slytherin dorms at almost two in the morning. Harry watches them go, his heart racing and spirit excited, feeling back in the

“Done, mate.”
Even if he waits for Malfoy to reappear, he hears a crowd coming up from the dorms' way for class change, and they
And then he opens his eyes as he swallows the last bit of tea and sits the cup down.
Harry's nervous ego is entirely soothed, petted, and encouraged like the big cat form it often decides to take into action. He closes his eyes despite the utter darkness and opens his mouth, brushing his tongue right against the cock so close to his nose. When Malfoy gasps and clenches his thigh muscles around Harry, fingers flexing in his hair in reflex, Harry smiles to himself and does it again and again, losing himself to the strange taste and scent of experience he's never had before.
“Ugh, you arsehole. Fine,” Draco almost stutters. He stares down at the liquid and the glass on his lap, terrified despite the inebriation.
Sorry I just absolutely love that line and I laugh every time. We're getting closer to the Second Task. Draco pulls some strings for Hagrid. Malfoys always pay their debts essentially. Draco doesn't like owing people things, so this is his way of paying back Hagrid, even though Hagrid will never know and obviously would have always helped Harry. We're gonna have another bonding (this time of characters we know and love) coming up before the 2nd task. Any guesses? Also had to call Cedric out here. It always bugged me that he makes Harry figure it out when Harry actually told him. Anyone else bothered by that in the books?
“Now I am sorry to separate the two of you so quickly, but Sirius, I need you to alert the old crowd and then stay with Remus for a while.”
“Sorry, Hermione,” Ginny frowned. Harry thought Ron looked pleased, but was trying to transform his expression into something more neutral.
“Really? Can you fucking guarantee that?” Harry spit back.
Harry huffed in annoyance, but did as Draco had asked.
Malfoy rolled his eyes.“Of course not, do you know what would happen to me if my Father found out I was suddenly friends with the Boy Who Lived? Based on your friends’ reactions, you haven’t told them about our new bond?”
Harry tuned out the two of them now that their voices had lowered, his eyes drifting to the group of Slytherins entering the Hall. Pansy was clinging to Draco’s arm as per usual, but the lovebites Harry had left on Draco were still on proud display. Pansy actually had the audacity to look over at Harry and wink subtly. Harry choked on his orange juice and went back to staring at his plate.
“Dad wants us to go grab some water,” Ron said following quickly after Hermione. Harry noticed a light pink tinge already settling onto Ron’s nose and cheeks from the time they had spent in the sun.
To Severus’ credit he only stared a second before grasping his shoulder and dragging him towards Dumbledore. Draco should have been more worried about people seeing his Mark, but he was too full of terror for Harry to think about it too much.
“Are you all right?” Harry asked and Ron shrugged.
“Voldemort fucking touched me!” Harry burst, a new wave of tears washing down his face.
Hermione had gone running for Madam Pomfrey, she had quickly found them and levitated Draco off to the Hospital Wing. Which now left Harry trying to figure out how to break in without drawing attention to himself. Pomfrey had sent Parkinson and Nott back to their Common Room before they could even make it the entire way into the ward. Harry was terrified about what was going on with Draco and also worried that Pomfrey would contact Draco’s parents. Finally, throwing all caution to the wind, Harry pushed into the Hospital Wing.
Harry climbed the steps to the room they had been training in, grinning at the sight of Sirius and Remus.
