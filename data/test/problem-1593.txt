Not that he knew why he wanted to face him. Or talk to him. But Harry felt that he was not going to be able to go through the day and think of something different than a shaking Malfoy without confronting him first. Plus, there was a
"Yes, okay. But it's a bit too much, isn't it? Forcing precisely Harry and Malfoy to
"I needed fresh air."
"Our help? Since when do you give a shit about Draco?"
And he pinched his arm not to fall asleep.
"Thanks, Ron."
, dear."
"She does?" asked Harry surprised.
Hermione nodded.
was mental. He had had Potter's lips on his own. Wow. Nice.
"I'm not like you, okay? I'm no sissy. Last night was a dare. I couldn't care less about you, you fucking snake!"
They were not thinking when they took their shirts off. It was hard too think when the only thing their bodies could do was feel. The amount of sensory inputs had them dizzy and fucked. Everything was hot and hard and fast and. Merlin. Their skins were touching. There was not even a little bit of space between them. Just skin and sweat. And Potter kept kissing his neck. In fact, kissing is not accurate. Potter was eating his neck, sucking and biting and licking. Insatiable. And Draco was lost, and at some point the fast breathing started sounding harder. He whined miserably. He could come. He could come from Potter's tongue in his neck.
The room was perfectly divided into a green and silver half, and its symmetrical red and golden one. Identical yet opposite. Maybe too obvious for a metaphor.
"Well, you have a huge one in the neck," and Draco realised that his loosen shirt had moved to reveal the still very visible spot that stupid Potter had put there. "So you are clearly playing dumb, which must mean that you do have the Mark. And how is it possible that Potter didn't see it? If he had, you definitely wouldn't be in Hogwarts anymore."
Hermione seemed too concentrated on the current state of events to answer, but then she smiled suddenly. It was her
Potter dropped his arm as if he finally had noticed that it burned. But they were both on fire already. Draco smiled. He liked it when Potter forgot to act brave and stupid.
way. Not that Harry felt attracted by it, of course. More like others. If Malfoy did something, people looked. That's just how it was and it was nerve-wrenching.
"You are totally twisting it all!" he shouted, his face getting red. And Draco loved that even more.
"There is a book in the drawer. You can read that."
"How many times do I have to tell you to clEAN AFTER YOURSELF?!"
"You coward." Harry hissed and it was completely contrary to reaction that he had expected from Harry that he just stared. "You bloody coward. How dare you do this to me? You did not trust me at all, did you? It's all good for you to say that I should move on, that I should forget you. Do you even realize the effect these words have on me Draco. You were so close to dying today and I almost lost my mind when I realized this. How dare you decide on my behalf?"
"Who did this?" It's oddly comforting and also very astonishing, "Are you putting him to sleep Dudley? We have to talk to someone about this, someone who is not Albus Dumbledore. But first things first. Take him in his bedroom. I will bring warm water and a towel and my first aid kit. Vernon is trying to contact Dumbledore and Snape and Black too. I will try to heal his wounds. You-"
"Hold onto me Draco." He murmured and Draco held his hand tightly.
In a blur of motion, Draco stood up and wrapped his hand around his throat to shut him up. For a very long time, he had wanted to do this and would have but this man never came again back.
"Aunt Petunia hated me for being Lily's child and for having magic. Vernon hated magic altogether and Dudley was too bull-headed to think anything by himself."
"Mr. Potter-Malfoy, you are way out of the line." Lucius spoke, looking into his eyes, his eyes still blank and unreadable.
"I love you." Draco murmurs when the song comes to an end and they simply stand in each others embrace.
Draco looked at him in alarm and placed the knife on the kitchen slap "Harry. I can explain."
." Weasley snapped at him. Draco jumped in surprise although Potter didn't as much as blink an eye. Black only shook his head.
Harry took a deep breath before speaking "You can take as much time you need Draco. I do wish certain things though."
Harry's blood was boiling and he wanted to burn everything.
"No, I was not raped. I was never raped. It was consensual." Draco spoke and Harry's knees felt week.
"Bring her to my office in an hour. The attack might have left internal injuries. How old was she at that time?" Draco asked blankly. He would not punish a child for her father's mistakes.
"I wasn't going to seek anyone else professor. I understand that you are obsessed with protecting me." The girl mutters with gleaming green eyed, her lips upturned in a smirk.
"BITCH. Always monopolising you. Always snatching you away from me." Draco whispered in a low and dangerous voice. In the matter of seconds, Draco had come in front him with crossed arms. He was glaring at Hermione and Harry found that he was speechless. When had Hermione snatched him away from Draco? What was he saying?
So he takes a deep breath and looks at the girl. The door is closed and she's standing very still.
Mom's and uncle Severus's head snapped towards her. Aunt Sierra wasn't there at the moment. Nor was uncle Remus. She walked in and closed the door behind her before placing her wand and sword back. Mom was crying. Her hands were covering her face and her shoulders were quivering.
"Why?" Harry asked "Why would I be angry? I had just thought that it would be good for the advancement of your potions career too. You would be able to increase your customer base this way but its ok."
Harry was currently having his tenth cup of coffee in the past five hours and was waiting for the lunch break when he would return to Draco and eat lunch peacefully. He was tired because he had slept late and he wondered how Draco was faring.
"Sorry but I can't." Draco's voice was quiet and soft and Harry closed his eyes and tried to get rid of his erection. But Draco was in his arms and he was as hard as Harry. Their erections rubbed against each other and Harry threw his head back, sweat trickling down his cheeks.
"Please, Draco. Don't leave." Harry pled and his chest and nose ached but merlin, it was good to have Draco back and he did not want him gone. "Please."
" Yes Master." The elf was trembling and he asked "Where is Draco?", having reached the topmost stair.
"You- You animal. You utter bastard. You knife fucked him. You twisted swine. I will sue you. I will take you to the aurors and get you thrown in prison. HOW DARE YOU HARRY? You are sorely mistaken if you think that I will let you go unpunished Harry. I will- I will- how could you, you bastard." She screamed and he grimaced.
Potter turns around and faces her. He doesn't touch her. He only looks at her. Only when he is sure that she would not flinch away, does he hold her left hand. He places her right hand fingers on the bracelet and murmurs, "Go now. It's over. Take rest."
"Draco. Call me Draco." Draco replied and shook Dudley's extended hands, nudging Harry's shoulders. Harry cleared his throat abruptly, "Um, hello Dudley."
"I just- I just don't want us to fight and get separated again. I am your husband and should be able to satisfy your needs Harry." Draco spoke desperately and backed off. He sat up and pulled his hair and Harry stared, his heart beating wildly.
"Very convenient for you, eh? Marry a pureblood woman, birth a child and throw him away in the care of your elfs. Shower him with most expensive toys and prepare him for the day he is to be given over to Voldemort. And then get yourselves imprisoned and leave him alone in this world and one more thing. Do not teach him anything about surviving in the muggle world so that his fate is worse than yours. When you come back, behave like a retired man and do not meet your traumatised son at any cost. Oh no, that would be so inconvenient for you, eh? I have never seen a selfish father like you."
He nods and places his index finger on his lips before pushing his chair gently. He takes his slippers off and tip toes towards the door and leans against the wall, trying to listen.
The silence ensued and Draco buried his nose in Harry's neck, breathing long and hard several times. Harry just held Draco's shoulder softly and stayed quiet. When Draco finally pulled back, his eyes were less tortured and his breath was normal. He looked embarrassed and Harry spoke "I might need your help in bathing me after all."
He knelt down weakly and hugged Draco from behind. "I am so sorry Draco. I am sorry for being late."
"What's wrong with you?" he said. He hadn't called her 'mom' yet and that didn't escape her notice. She breathed slowly. Something was wrong. She had such a strong feeling.
"Please. Only this once Draco. I want you so much." He begged and left a trail of kisses from Draco's neck to shoulder.
"We are looking for a suitable place for the academy tomorrow, that is if you still want to make a lab for yourself in the same building and teach the art of potions to the willing students." Harry asked sharply and he heard Draco sigh.
He muttered "Give two doses each of Veritaserum to Neville, Fred and George first." Draco nodded and his ex-friends did not argue. Harry noticed that Draco did not avert his eyes from them. He looked steadily in their eyes.
Suddenly, Harry is standing right next to Draco. Draco jumps in surprise. One minute he wasn't there and the other minute he was.
"I am taking Malfoy out. It's been a long while since we met." He answers, going by his instincts and looks at the said woman.
"I'm going home." Draco muttered and whirled around.
"He suffered more than me. I didn't want him to pity me and he was never comfortable talking about his past. I didn't want to push him. He-"
"Just sleep. Goodnight." Draco murmured sleepily and Harry stroked his hair for a long time, just looking at Draco's face. It was completely dark but moonlight shone through the window and fell on Draco's face. Harry kissed his head and Draco burrowed in Harry's chest and yawned, muttering "Sleep, will you. We have a long day tomorrow, packing, meeting and stuff. Not to mention you had just set your academy. You will have to shift it to Britain now. Sell the place and -" Draco yawned again and Harry spoke "A witch had approached me day before yesterday to purchase it for setting a small playschool in it. I will sell it to her."
His eyes shot wide open when a wand clattered on the floor and the knife almost slipped from his hand, scratching his wrist. It started bleeding though it was nothing life threatening. No. Harry's eyes which were wide open were more threatening then the little cut on his wrist. They were green and furious, actually no, furious was the wrong word, they were absolutely and utterly mad.
"He gave this to me twenty days after we started meeting discreetly. I gave one such ring to him too. After he told me that he was in love with Lily he gave the one I gifted him, back to me and waited for me to return his. I didn't. He didn't ask again."
He shakes his head adamantly.
Harry broke the uncomfortable silence and spoke "Hermione. I am sorry to snap at you and I apologise to ask for your services at such a short notice but I need you to come with me to check Draco up-"
"They might recognise me." Draco continued and Harry repeated, his eyes unreadable "And."
Harry is proud of her for being so brave. She huddles into herself and starts sobbing silently.
Draco's eyes trailed from his neck to his legs and Draco shivered and Harry could read desire and panic in his eyes in equal proportions.
"Harry would never leave him alone. How will I-"
He was so lost in his thoughts that he did not even notice Lucius walking towards the door with her wife. Only when he reached the door did Harry see him and he whispered, "Do you still love my dad?"
"Than- thank you." She whispers, "I loved her too. I miss her."
He doesn't understand so he stares at her, perplexed.
"Okay." Draco replied softly, unable to comprehend the reason for Harry's silence.
" I thought that you meant it." Harry said and then laughed bitterly, "I should have known that you didn't. You would never initiate anything unless it's absolutely necessary. I wonder Draco if I disgust you since you don't even touch me anymore. We are more like room mates Draco."
Dad's entire demeanor changes and Harry knows that dad is on the verge of blurting something out but then dad only breathes and nods.
"Harry, why are you not hugging me properly?" He whined and Harry slipped his hands inside Draco's shirt and rested them on his stomach, hugging him close to his body and Draco sighed in relief.
"Draco. Please. Please be alive." He shouted frantically, his voice breaking and his eyes tearing up.
"You're missing her." Says Vernon, gazing at her as she looks at the sky. It's clear and beautiful today. Maybe they should go out.
‘Did you really think you could get away with this?’ I see her checking the surroundings. Oh, this will get even better. I know her every move, I know what she’s planning. I stand behind her. ‘I will have to do a full body and cavity search now. Just to make sure you’ve got not other stolen goods.’
When the owl arrives, I all but run to the window. Compose yourself, Draco, I think. Only to rush forward and send back a reply. It’s my home, I can rush if I please. No one’s here to see me make a fool of myself anyway.
‘You’re scaring me, Harry. Please, just get it out.’
The man waves his hand before disappearing in the mist. Harry shrugs of his uncomfortable, eerie feeling. It’s just a bloody forest and he’s a magical being himself, for fucks sake! He starts walking and immediately bumps his toe on a rather sturdy rock. ‘Damn!’ he mutters to himself, rubbing his sore foot. Looking down, he suddenly sees the cluster of stones and mushrooms he was looking for.
‘Potter?’
‘You do now? Trust me?’ Harry’s looks at him with a strangely conflicted expression. As if he doesn’t want to pressure him, but want nothing more than to hear he’s earned Draco’s trust.
Harry snorts and throws the mask at him. ‘Cock. I’m not interested in other wizards.’
‘Yes, Yaxley. I know. But please, let me play with my food a bit. Where’s the fun in just aiming a good old Avada Kedavra between the eyes? No, I’ll take my time killing him. Or maybe I’ll kill Harry first. Yes, that’s even better. I’ll restore Draco’s memories and then I’ll make him watch. That way he can see Harry’s death is his fault for making Harry come to rescue him.’ A bone chilling cackle follows. She enters a small cottage, cutting of sound. Making sure she doesn’t go out again, Harry waits until sunset. He tries to puzzle the pieces together. Draco’s memories are altered somehow? Will that mean he won’t recognize him?
‘Fuck, yeah. You’re doing great.’ Draco sucks him in, his cheeks hollowing. He blows like a pro and Harry has to think of Bellatrix to keep from coming. Draco lets out his cock with a pop.
‘You can say that again.’ Harry smiles as they leave the shower.
‘Draco... ah... I’m close. Oh... Draco!’ I can’t keep silent.
‘The first time I-‘ Draco’s voice wavers and he doesn’t know if he’s ready to go on. He falls back on the couch, his body involuntary starts to shake.
My phone untangles itself from my grip, and in slow motion it’s making its way to the ground. I don’t give a fuck. I... have felt my heart break so many times, during the war, after the war and with Harry, that I know I lost some pieces. Making me less flexible, less kind. I swallow. Will I ever get it back? The little Draco that was afraid of hurting a fly? Who caught spiders and even wasps with a cup and paper and put them safely outside?
‘Oh.’ The sad look returns. ‘I’m sorry. It hadn’t occurred to me you might return to the witches once your curiosity was satisfied.’
Harry shakes his head. ‘I’d best go home now.’ He murmurs, as he feels himself getting drowsy.
‘You were wonderful, love.’ He looks so appreciating, so full of love, I feel my throat tightening.
‘Don’t’. A clipped voice comes from his large recliner. Harry freezes. He senses the strangers tone tolerates no contradiction.
‘Harry?’
Harry whimpers as he looks at Malfoy through fluttering eyelids. His erection strains in his jeans.
‘How-?’
I wait a moment, appearing in thought. ‘I’m a straight auror’ I reply.
Harry moves between the Count’s legs, his head close to his cock. It smells wonderful. Musky, male and very arousing. He circles the Count’s cock with his hand, pulling away the foreskin. The shiny, velvet cock in his hand makes his own leak. He licks a little stripe on the cock. The hiss from the Count encourages him. He folds his mouth around it, scraping his teeth against it in the process.
In which Draco, Ginny and Harry visit Disneyland Paris.
‘This potion has been taken without the owners consent. We are searching everyone in close proximity. You do realize I have to search you too for illicit potions?’
‘How did it go?’
Fuck. Fuckerthefuck. This wasn’t what Draco intended. He wanted to make Harry uncomfortable, to call his bluff. But it’s Draco himself who’s turning beet red. He did read too much into this. Now Draco will never live it down. Harry will tease him with the quill-and-crotch-incident forever.
Harry tosses me on the bed and presses his fingers in my mouth, while unzipping his pants. I suckle on his fingers, greedily waiting for their replacement. Harry doesn’t let me down as he presses his cock deep inside my mouth. It’s been a long time since I engaged in any cocksucking activities. I smile at my own phrasing.
‘Yes. I seem to have that effect on people.’
‘I’m sorry for being an utter pillock. I should’ve talked to you like your husband, not as an auror. You were right, okay?’ I nod silently. ‘But I still want to know what I just read and why. Could we talk about it? I promise I’ll try not to lose my temper.’
‘Are you laughing at me?’ Harry mocks me. ‘We can’t have that.’ He tells me as he thrusts his prick even deeper in my mouth.
‘That feels so good, love. It would feel even better for me if I could put some more cock into your perfect mouth.’ Just Harry takes Draco’s hair and guides his mouth onto his prick. Draco opens up obediently and swallows him. Harry keeps pressing his cock deeper, making Draco choke.
‘I’m not getting in that... what’s it called? In that Tower of Terror. Never!’ Draco’s already pale complexion is turning ashen with fear.
‘Harry! So good to see you!’ His warm, deep voice envelops around Harry, making him feel comfortable instantaneous. If only Dean wasn’t as straight as a pencil and one of his best friends, Harry wouldn’t have minded going out with him at all. Dean is calm, efficient and selfsure. And of course quite the sight to look at, his toned, broad body always clad in the best fitting trousers. Harry wonders how his firm arse would feel when he would stroke it through said fitting trousers. He smiles at his wicked thought and realizes Dean is waiting for an answer. He blushes a bit. Damn.
‘I think I’m getting scared, Lu. I’ve never done this. If I go out, it’s always with you guys. Never alone. Never trying to find... to find...’
‘Sure?’ I nod. ‘I’ll be off, then!’ She salutes and enters the ride. Ginny lives for the rush. She likes the feeling of flying and being at an amusement park comes close when you can’t get on a broom, doctors orders. I understand she doesn’t want to wait.
‘Blimey, Draco. He isn’t leaving me.’
‘I know, love.’ He holds out his hands for baby Rose. Hermione hands her over. The baby is quiet immediately.
‘Don’t care.’
‘Ginny, please.’
I feel Draco shake besides me. ‘Har, I’m serious. I’m not going to do that. Those muggles with their contraptions of death. I’m content with my life as it is. I don’t want to die prematurely.’ He is whining now. I sigh and turn around to face him.
‘You were eyeing this piece, right? You can have it, if you’re a good boy. Open that devilish lush mouth of yours’ Harry orders. Draco feels his legs turn to jelly. Why do Harry’s confident orders arouse him this much?
‘Bellatrix showed up here, screaming and telling me what a traitor I was. How she wanted to punish me. And how an avada was too considerate. She wanted me to suffer, Mr. Potter. So she...’ Narcissa’s voice wavers. Taking a moment, she collects herself again. ‘She took him into another realm. I don’t know where, but she told me only true and requited love could set him free. And that his cold heart would never be able to love. I went after him, but the portal wouldn’t open for me. I think it has to be a lovers interest, not a mothers love. I know how he thinks of you, Mr. Potter. And I can only hope you feel the same way. Please, Mr. Potter. Help him.’
‘So strong. So resilient.’ He continues his trail over his collarbone, his throat, his chin, ending at his mouth. He kisses him again. This time it’s an open mouthed, sloppy kiss. ‘You are perfect. Don’t ever doubt that, Draco Malfoy.’ With that, he tosses the towel in the hamper and leaves a very flustered and very aroused Draco in the bathroom.
‘I really want you to play the criminal, on the run for the aurors. The garden is big enough and has more than enough hiding spots. When I find you, I’ll promise I’ll play rough.’ He bares his teeth in a feral grin.
Draco flusters, but Ginny replies: ‘I do know, you big sap. You’ve always had more love to give than any other bloke I ever knew. And you don’t even realize it. It makes you the most bloody beautiful man I know. Sorry Draco’, she adds as an afterthought, ‘no offense’.
‘Ouch! Careful, or I’ll spank you right where you’re still hurting from last night.’ The Count’s eyes cloud over with sudden desire.
I lick her nipple, while stroking the other with my fingers. They are so hard. I tweak them a bit, while my mouth licks a trail down. She whimpers and lets her legs fall open. ‘You might want to search me down there, auror.’
I shake my head. ‘I’m the one giving the orders. Do you know your word?’
‘Don’t you want answers?’ Malfoy looks at him inquiringly, head cocked to the side.
Harry moves the bowl and lies next to Draco on the bed. He snuggles against Draco and wraps his arms around him protectively. He sighs content, resting his head into the crook of Harry’s neck. ‘Sleep, love. You need it.’ He feels a soft kiss on his hair before he sinks into a deep, much needed sleep.
‘We need to keep communicating. Are there things you want me or don’t want me to do?’
Draco gulps. ‘If it gets too much or if I want to stop, will you?’ Draco looks at him nervously, his hand fidgeting with the hem of his sleeve.
Harry tries, and this time it works better. He loves the feeling of cock in his mouth. When he’s bobbed up and down a few times, he’s starting to feel more adventurous. He licks the edge of the crown. The Count groans. ‘Fuck, Po- Precious. You’re a natural.’ Harry resumes his exploring, licking and popping it in and out, smearing precome and spit all over his own face. He experiments with the rhythm, alternating between fast and agonizingly slow blows. He licks his balls, sucking them in, his hand coating the Count’s prick with his saliva. The Count’s sharp intake of breath emboldens him.
Harry gets up too, still panting. ‘That was so fucking amazing, Dray. You coming without a single touch.’ He unties the ropes and rubs my wrists and ankles.
Harry grabs his mask and walks to the door. ‘Thanks, Malfoy.’
‘Fucking hell, don’t even start this. I see this all day.’ Frustrated, Harry runs his hand through his hair. ‘Oh no, auror Potter. I didn’t do this. It must be a mistake.’ He tells me in a high pitched mock voice. ‘And then the waterworks start.’ He adds bitterly.
‘I... You never did ask my why I was here, did you?’
They are shown into a large dining area, with beautifully decked tables, partially secluded by see through screens and dimly lit, just enough to make it comfortable. Their table is a round one, decked for four. Harry pulls out a chair for Draco. He is surprised by the chivalrous gesture. Harry sits next to him, as the waiter removes the two remaining plates.
Harry gets up and casts a quick scourgify on the table, but not themselves. He whispers ‘Let’s get home, I’ll lick you clean.’
‘I don’t want a foursome. I’m afraid it will hurt.’ Draco looks at Just Harry through his lashes, blinking innocently, hoping Harry will get that he’s so ready for this, but wants a bit of coercion.
‘Not long. Maybe tomorrow? Sis can be very convincing.’ She chuckles.
‘You’re not?’
‘I knew it would work.’ Narcissa practically beams, for as far as her uptight nature allows it. Harry steps into the portal, only his head in view for Narcissa.
‘Har, time to pick up some of that Gryffindor bravery the Wizarding world always gives you credit for. Last time I checked Malfoy and you were on speaking terms. Please. Do it for me? What have you got to lose?’
Harry puts her into her bouncy chair. He creates small puffs or colored smoke with his wand, watching as her eyes grow wide at each different pattern and color. She smiles and tries to grab them. When it doesn’t work, she gets annoyed and starts to sniffle again.
Draco's voice was clear and his face was wet and his hands were still trembling but he kept on looking at Harry and Harry stayed silent for as long as he could.
"Oh no. Let me rephrase it. It was a crush, not an obsession." Ron mutters, her eyes knowing and Harry shoots up, his cheeks warm.
Draco was staring speechlessly at him now, his mouth open in shock.
Draco kissing him...
"How are you, Granger? How is everything going?" Draco asked nonchalantly. However, Granger was so busy in her papers that she didn't even notice. Blaise stared at him, his brows raised.
Kreacher came inside, looking a little alarmed, a letter in his hands.
"But we - I don't think that Dumbledore would agree." Remus murmurs. Harry can hear faint voice of sobbing that belongs to Narcissa.
Draco wonders how Severus will react once he knows the complete truth. Draco is scared that where everything else failed to break him, this will definitely do just that. She is terrified for mother too. They never knew what was going on right under their noses.
Harry shakes his head in amusement and follows them under his invisibility cloak.
A choked "Please" escaped Draco's lips and his eyes shot open. This was a very crucial moment because it would decide whether Draco could trust him or not. It would decide whether Draco would take the risk to make love with him again. He had to control himself. He looked at his achingly hard cock which rested on Draco's thighs. His hand was still on Draco's zipper. He removed his hand and zipped Draco's trousers and then buttoned them. He accioed his own trousers and put them on after crawling beside Draco.
"I see, that explains the sixty points Gryffindor lost," sighed Ron humorously. "What happened?"
"Sure."
sorry for the long wait, the school year finished and i had some stuff to wrap up :(( but i hope you like this!! let me know in the comments (also if there is something you don't like). thank you for reading, for the kudos, and for being alive! i very much appreciate you  <3<3<3
"What's up, Parkinson?"
"And yet," intervened McGonagall, "testimonies refer to bidirectional shouting."
"Five points from Gryffindor, Mr. Potter. You might want to start paying attention if you plan on pursuing a career as an auror."
"You wouldn't, Dray! That lady is a blessing for the house, and for my sight too. You know what an excellent cook she is, but she is also an expert eater..."
"Not as long as you clean up when you finish," he answered stiffly.
"You could eat it," suggested Draco, with his best
him too, that he was having fun, and that he would never ask him to stop. Or maybe that's what Harry wanted to see. Anyway, he gave into the rush that vibrated in his skin, and buried his hands in Malfoy's perfect hair, pulling him into the kiss that he'd wanted to give him since that morning in the Great Hall.
The trick worked and Draco's embarrassed cleared. Draco nodded and they returned to their forgotten breakfast.
A couple of minutes later he found himself in front of there door, practically shaking with anger. Tessa was crying now. She was not a loud child. She was sobbing soundlessly and Draco wondered if she had been compelled to be quiet to keep all this shit a bloody secret from her father.
"One of these days, I'm going to steal your cloak and then how will you follow me," Draco muttered warningly and turned her head to look at him. She looked murderous as she answered, "You could certainly try, Malfoy."
It was just that no-one said anything, not even Ronald who was sitting right in front of Potter and Draco hadn't been on talking terms with Potter ever since she got married. Maybe, this was normal. After all, she had been living with the Weasleys ever since she turned fifteen and the elder Potters disappeared. It
"Shhhh. Don't shout." The voice belongs to Weasley. They are in their late thirties and one would think that Weasley would finally bury the hatchet but one would be wrong because Weasley will continue despising Draco even after he dies.
Draco Malfoy is."
He tries to concentrate on her face because she is looking too beautiful and he has wanted her for such a long time.
"You might as well walk with us, Potter," Zabini said a few moments later, "You're not fooling anyone."
"Treacle Tart." Draco murmurs and the gargoyles let him inside. Potter is just so predictable. After all these years, he still loves those tarts.
"Eclairs."
"It wouldn't take much to break him again. An accidental meeting with a couple of his past clients who still want him in their beds and boom, Malfoy will break." Ginny snapped "I did it then and I can do it again. Harry will belong to no one if not me."
Harry was busy brooding about his friends's strange reactions but Draco was not. He noticed that Sirius was still outside the door, listening and Hermione was trying to convey something to him through her eyes. Ron's eyes were not angry. They were just sad though his face was red as he shouted loudly, "Let's leave them Hermione. They are assholes and I do not want to see their faces anymore."
"No!" She snaps at him and glares coldly at nothing in particular.
As soon as they apparated in front of Harry's old home, now their home, he let Harry's hand go, because he couldn't touch anyone just yet, not even Harry. When he looked at Harry, he saw nothing but understanding in his soft eyes. His green eyes did not contain even a bit of pity.
He knew that Harry did not lock his door and he barged inside.
Soft sunlight was streaming through the windows when Petunia woke. It was warm today. Slowly, she opened her eyes and yawned, placing her palm on her mouth. The other side of the bed was empty. It surprised her because it was Saturday and so Vernon should be sleeping right now. He slept in on Saturdays and anyways he woke Petunia up for breakfast. She sat up and rubbed her eyes.
Before Draco knew what he was doing, he cleared his throat. Percy backed off immediately when he saw that it was Draco and Potter's eyes became wide with relief for a very small second. The moment passed though and Potter glared at him before muttering coldly, "What do you need, Malfoy?"
They apparated in front of Harry's home and Draco could finally breathe. He had not been to able to prevent his fear when a large crowd had gathered around him, pushing Harry away somewhere.
"If I didn't love dad and you so much, I would have left this house when I was five. I would have run away and lived Mr Dumbledore or hell, Mr Snape. Please do not remind me of that day," Dudley said and his voice was just so pained that Petunia fell silent.
"He is sedated. Do not worry. We will wait until Draco returns." Dudley stopped at this and looked at Harry expectantly. Harry looked at him flabbergasted.
Harry had warned him about this. Tiredly, he sat up and leaned against the head board of his bed. He did not want to prepare anything. He wondered if Harry had eaten anything because it was his turn to prepare breakfast today.
"I don't see any other way out." He says, "Snape will obliviate me and that will be the end of it. I'll be able to move on with Ginny."
He shifted and lay on Harry's body, placing his chin on his chest and looking into his eyes. He bit Harry's cheeks lovingly and continued "I am afraid that you would do something illegal to avenge me. I know that you won't leave me."
Draco's jaw drops open when the words register in his mind. He keeps on staring the green eyed and enigmatic man in shock, waiting for him to take his words back.
"Do they hurt? " Harry asked and looked at Draco. Of course Draco understood his meaning and nodded " Yes. He had wanted to dominate over a death eater and I was the perfect target. He had paid me for it. I never got over the humiliation. "
Very slowly, Harry smirked and mumbled in a cheerful tone, "Of course, dear godfather. you must be tired. Take rest and we will talk tomorrow."
"Ron, be quiet for a moment." Hermione hisses.
Harry did not grace them with a look, choosing to lie down and close his eyes instead. He did not have enough patience to deal with anyone yet.
"Get out of my room." He murmurs slowly and she snarls viciously, "Don't look at me like that Potter."
"I am turning the tables, Draco. I- I am going because I can not live in this constant fear, the fear that one day I will return and you will be gone, gone somewhere I can not follow you. I am going and then you can follow me if you wish but- but I won't have you LEAVE ME ALONE IN THIS - THIS PATHETIC CRUEL WORLD." Harry shouted at the end and very suddenly, picked the knife that Draco had used and slit his own wrists.
"Firstly Harry is gay and secondly you accused Draco of wanting to hurt his husband. What else did you expect, eh?" Ron snapped at his wife and she muttered "All right then, men. They are lots of men, back in Britain who would want to marry Harry who would behave like decent human beings instead of animals."
He places his hand on Draco's head and she starts sobbing even harder. Maybe he should let her cry for a bit. Maybe that will ease her pain.
"I don't deserve you." His husband whispered and Harry snapped at him "Don't say this again. I love you and I can't live without you. That's that."
"You are like Lily." Aunt said and his eyes focussed and blurred as he looked at her. "I will tell you about her. I have her albums, you know. I hid them years ago so that no one finds them. I will give them to you. I found her journals as well though I never peaked inside until Dudley told me about Vernon. You are like her because she wrote that she forgave me for everything I said and that she loved me even if I was angry with her. Of course she did not use the word jealous. I am sorry Harry because I hurt you just because you were a wizard. I paid for my sins though. Dudley never got to visit Hogwarts. Lily wrote that it is beautiful and Tessa has been living in fear."
Unhurriedly he steps out off the dress. Harry’s breath hitches in his throat. If you would’ve told him yesterday that the sight of Malfoy in a girdle would arouse him beyond words, he would’ve reserved you a bed at the Janus Thickey ward. But now? Now all he can do is stare at Draco’s pale complexion, contrasting sharply against the shiny, dark stockings. All the blood that was in his face from blushing, rushes to his already spent cock, making it half hard again.
Shaking his head with a soft smile, he sits on the recliner in his office and obediently eats his lunch. Not even Jones’ reprimand when he finds Draco sitting and eating instead of sweating on the report can touch his mood.
‘So we thought up a little scene for you.’ Harry picks up the gag and ropes. My eyes widen. His eyes focus on mine. ‘Would you like to hear what it is?’
Checking his reflection for the umpteenth time, Draco opens the third button of his snug fitting shirt. Deciding it is too much, to eager, he closes it again. He has been extra careful to keep his pants clean. Normally he feels over-confident in his slacks of sex, as Pansy named them. Going out in the tailored grey pantaloons meant an assured pull, a quick innuendo in the loo imminent. But now he wonders if they will be satisfactory enough.
As he glances back, he sees the flirting wizard snogging a witch with a similar blue mask. He’s not wasting any time to get over Harry’s rejection, he thinks with a wry smile. The wizard makes short eye contact with Harry, as if to tell him what he’s missing out on, before licking his way back into the witch.
When Harry told me she got us tickets, I was over the moon. Stupid me. Of course he’d rather fuck Her Who Must Not Be Named. Because why would Harry or anyone want to spend their days with an ex-Death Eater? Who also happens to be male? And thus can never physically give you the family you want? I should’ve known good things can never last for a Malfoy.
After a few silent moments, he asks me: ‘You know, we could have an entirely better conversation when you’re not attempting to eat our pillows?’
‘Nah-ah’, he shakes his head. ‘You’re already in too many clothes for my taste.’ He leans in and whispers: ‘I like my men naked and whimpering.’
‘Don’t tell me you’ve never been offered sex before. What’s a bit of sex in exchange of a life? I bet it happens all the time.’
Our laughing starts at the same time. First it’s hesitant, small titters that turn into giggles and chuckles, developing into a full fledged fit of roaring laughter. Tears are steaming down our cheeks, but this time not from sadness. I clutch my belly and have to stop, because my abs are hurting too much. But every time I look at Harry’s broad smile, a new fit of giggles starts.
Next chapter will be smutfilled, so I’ll see you tomorrow!
Harry watches him intently. ‘I’m not sure if I can protect you until the trial.’
‘Let’s order food.’ I tell him, my voice hoarse from the relentless pummeling it just endured. ‘I love it when you sound like that. Maybe you should order. Don’t you think they’ll know exactly what you did when you sound like this?’ Harry grins a lopsided smile. I swat him on the head. ‘Dork. I want Italian this time.’
‘Then come.’
‘Not necessarily. We could also do a traffic light system. I’ll ask you if you’re green , and you reply with green, yellow or red. I’ll know when to go slow or stop. We do need a safe word, and we also need safe signals. For when you can’t talk, because, let’s say, your gagged or restrained.’ Draco wonders if the darkness in Harry’s eyes is mirrored in his own. If the tightness of his trousers is representative for the state of his pupils, he’s sure his eyes are blacker than ink. ‘We’ll discuss the signals later.’ Harry finishes.
‘Such a good little red prey’, Malfoy tells him as he pushes his cock further in. Harry gags, but he swallows deeper and deeper, relaxing his throat as Malfoy continues pressing. His eyes water as Malfoy starts fucking his throat in earnest. He grabs his own cock.
The Count swats Harry’s hand away and grabs both their cocks in his hand. Slow, languid strokes make Harry whimper. He surrenders to the wonderful feeling of another cock against his, while the warm water washes over his hair and back, the soft smell of sandalwood lingering. The Count sucks his neck, marking him. Harry’s moans become louder as the Count’s movements get quicker. They pant in unison as the Count moves faster and faster. Harry comes first, the Count follows directly after, their spunk mingling with the water. Harry leans his forehead onto the Count’s for a few moments, both gathering their breaths and waiting for their heart rates to return to normal.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Harry?’ He asks me, when he’s got his breathing under control.
‘Do you like this, dear prince?’ Draco looks up at him with that smug, challenging smile Harry knows only too well. Only to turn back into an innocently blushing Drapunzel the next moment.
‘Who are you?’ Draco’s eyes are wide with fear. ‘What do you want with me?’
‘Do you like what you see?’ Draco asks as he turns around on the stairs. Expecting a flustered reply, he is shocked by the small smirk that Harry sends his way.
Harry picks me up and walks us over to the bed. I wrap my legs around him. Having an auror partner does have its perks. They’re strong as a herd of Hungarian Horntails.
‘Told you.’ Harry can hear the smile,in Malfoy’s voice.
‘Careful, you’ll get spunk everywhere.’ Ginny had hated spunk. A moment of sadness washes over him. His misses her, even if he just had this mind blowing experience.
This will work out. And if it doesn’t? I’ll hex his balls up his forehead. Or yours, depending on who hurts who.
All I know, all I know
Harry gets up. ‘The shower is all yours, if you want. Make it quick.’ His eyes shine mischievously ‘Come downstairs when you’re finished. If you’re a good boy, I’ll let you have that breakfast from a plate.’
When the first sounds of Labyrinth come from his telly, he finds himself unwinding. How many times has he watched this movie as a kid? Silently crawling from his cupboard when the whole house was asleep, putting the VHS in the recorder. The movie aunt Petunia thought of as sinful and tossed away. Harry rescued it and watched it over and over. He hasn’t watched in a while, but probably still knows it word by word.
‘Wank yourself.’ Malfoy’s voice is sinful and posh. Harry grabs his cock and slowly starts tossing. It feels good. A film of perspiration has formed on Malfoy’s body. Harry’s legs slide down a bit, resting over the arms of Malfoy. Suddenly one of Malfoy’s deep thrusts reaches the spot. The spot that makes Harry see white dots. He remembers why he liked having sex. What irony. Feelings returning when his life will end soon. Because he’s sure, Malfoy will end things. He knows his perseverance, knows how he never does things by half. And... his thoughts get interrupted, because The Spot is hit again and again. Harry moans. He is close already, not wanting it to end yet. He circles the base of his cock and squeezes to prevent himself from coming.
Harry’s eyes darken. ‘What makes you think I safe worded for you? Draco, love, you still have a lot to learn. I’m not willing to finish our play when you’re hurting.’
Fuck.
‘I’m not sure if I can only watch. I might want to... touch myself too.’
Ginny kisses me. I’m still semi-hard from my meeting with Draco. Images of the things he said he’d do to me flash through my head, turning me on even more. But no, wait. If I want this to work, I must focus on Ginny. She deserves that.
‘What the actual fuck, Harry! I’m sodding hungry.’ Draco’s eyes are blazing.
‘For fucks sake...’ Making a decision, Draco quietly starts moving his hand. At first he’s terrified, but when he looks around, he still sees no one noticing his actions. Biting his lip, to refrain from making noises, he sets a slow pace. Harry keeps on eating, seemingly not interested in what’s happening. Does he do it wrong? Should he hold Harry’s prick too? He wants to be good to Harry, but he seems to be doing a bad job at it. His hand becomes motionless.
‘Yes. With you I want to try new things. I didn’t know I could deep-throat. But I liked it. And you encouraged me and made me feel wanted and good at it.’
Harry closes the distance. He rubs his half flaccid cock over Draco’s legs and lower back and presses his body flush to Draco’s. ‘You will have to earn this orgasm. Let’s see how long I can keep you on edge.’ He whispers in Draco’s ear.
‘I know, Draco, because if it would’ve been me, I would’ve created a scene that would shock the whole bloody Wizarding world. I definitely would’ve done some really fucked up things to get even with him, out of betrayal, anger and despair. Why didn’t you?’
He checks himself in front of the mirror. As he turns small circles to wave out his dress, he feels sexy and beautiful. A real treat for prince Harry. He smile a genuine smile. He walks down, pretending to be a princess on a ball, making his grand entry. He waves at the imaginary visitors. He sits on the window sill in the light of the setting sun and starts braiding his hair. Everything will be alright. Mother might force him into loneliness, she can never touch his imagination. He starts singing a soft tune.
‘We know, Harry. We’re not daft. We just don’t give a fuck.’ Draco replies, his posh voice saying rude words does inexplicable things to my southern region.
‘I’ll just push it in a bit further. I promise if it hurts, I’ll pull it out.’ Just Harry’s coaxing is followed by a whisper ‘If you’re uncomfortable in any way, tap one of our hips twice, okay?’ Draco nods.
Draco feels himself slipping away into a fatigued sleep. If they keep this up, he’ll get blisters on his cock, he grins to himself. But it’ll be so fucking worth it, he contemplates before surrendering to his drowsiness.
Harry’s hands slide down the Counts body, finding him in similar state. ‘Not more than you.’ He tells him, as he fondles with the Count’s prick, sliding his foreskin up and down a few times.
Draco wakes up in Harry’s bed. He feels sore and bruised. Just as he likes it. His hair smells fresh and feels fluffy. As if it’s been washed. He blushes a bit. Did Harry wash his whole body? He does smell like Harry’s soap. He looks up and sees Harry sitting next to him on a chair, putting down the book he was reading. ‘Good, you’re awake. How are you feeling?’
So I kiss him. Gently, on his lips. I stroke his hair and tell him sweet words. How I feel for him. How he deserves happiness after all he’s been through. How much I want to see him content. He looks at me again, unable to grasp my reaction.
"I am not lying." Draco started and Harry clenched his hand and slammed his fist on the slap "I SAID SHUT UP." And Merlin, Harry's hands were red and he murmured "You will get hurt. Stop this madness Harry. "
Draco had barely spoken to Harry at all. Two days had passed and Harry had tried to talk to him but he had not found the strength in him to talk. He had not hurt himself and had stayed away from any sharp object. He had cast cleaning charms on him so that he won't subject his body to boiling water.
"You are not dirty Draco." Draco stayed silent. He knew that Harry was trying but he also knew that nothing would help him. Their was nothing Harry could say that would console him. He had sinned and he simply couldn't forgive himself. "I know that you are trying Harry but nothing can change the past."
"I never received any letter. Did you receive any owl from him? Fred , George." Neville spoke softly and the Fred murmured, his hands in his pocket "No I didn't" "Neither did I" George continued.
to know what the man is thinking. His voice is blank. Draco can't know whether he's insulting him or only teasing him.
He was here to reject dad's proposition. He didn't want to get into this industry even if it's intriguing but Harry knows that something is wrong and he makes a split second decision and mutters, "I'll take the lead role dad."
"I presume that you will remain there during the check up, Harry." She asked Harry who was holding his hand tightly. Harry nodded and extended his hand towards his room "This way, towards my room please."
Creevy took a picture and just when Harriet was about to pull back, Fred dropped his head on her shoulder for a second and dropped a little kiss on her throat before she finally shoved him away, laughing, "hey," making it sound playful. Draco saw though. It was anything but playful. She didn't like it. It was written clearly in her eyes.
He looked at Harry's pert hips and strong thighs. He looked at Harry's broad shoulders and toned back and swallowed again.
"Potter." Snape calls him but Harry is not ready speak yet. He doesn't know what to do.
"Daaaad," Albus' whine brought him back. He looked down and Albus continued, "They are about to bolt."
"I fought with Voldemort and lived to tell the tale. Nothing can terrify or surprise me. Please look at me. No-one will judge you for being different if that's what you are scared about." Harry whispers softly, trying to coax her.
But it doesn't reduce the pain. It doesn't destroy the feeling that she was violated.
He looks back into her eyes and murmurs, "Come here Ms. Malfoy."
He said "I want you to find out the latest date and venue of Draco's meeting. Can you please do it for me?"
"Harry, listen to me." Draco started, trying to sooth his anger but Harry continued, his voice barely controlled, "We are seeing Neville and our first session is tomorrow. I will intimate him." Harry spoke and Draco tried to sit up. Harry stayed frozen where he was as Draco sat on his knees, wearing his boxers.
He is right because slowly Potter's lips upturn in a grin so wicked that Draco actually shudders. Since when does Potter smirk. Draco frowns.
"I will if you don't keep your mouth shut," Harry warned. He should have known not to say anything to an eleven year old. Merlin, they romanticised everything.
and you have no reason to be embarrassed." Harry spoke softly and confidently. He had never known the things that Draco had revealed today.
But she is not an object and if she is not enjoying it, then what's the point. He is not Riddle. He is not an animal. He won't use her. He is a better man and he has waited for such a long time. He can wait some more. A involuntary whimper escapes his lips as he forces himself to back off from her warm embrace. He lays down on his back and tries to calm himself down.
"We'll go, then." He asks.
"I'll help them. Thank you, head auror Black." Weasley said curtly.
Mom sighs, "It's okay, Scorpius. Go and sit down in the dining room. Mimsi will serve some lunch and I'll come and heal you in a few minutes."
The silence in the room is awkward. Potter seems deep in thought. Draco wonders what he's thinking, cursing himself only a moment later. He's not the one who's supposed to ask questions. But he really wants to know what Potter is thinking.
It's difficult to concentrate. He is really worried for Draco. A sudden click catches his attention and he looks up.
He did not want anything to do with Harry. Not that that ever stopped Severus, Hermione or Ron from pushing him towards the man. He didn't want to spoil the day anymore than it already had been spoiled so he started jogging again. Of course, fate was watching him from somewhere and laughing at him because right then he heard a familiar voice.
As the days pass by, she becomes even more aloof, staring in the space all the time.
Together, they headed towards the front door. His house wasn't very huge and
They stayed like that for a long period of time.
No-body said anything for a few moments and then Molly stood up, muttering in that exhausted voice of hers, "You are saying that we are trapped here for the indefinite future."
"You coming?" Snape asks when Harry doesn't follow him.
"I was wondering-" Harry started and Draco halted to look at the man "Yes."
Off went the boxers and Draco stood in front him completely naked, avoiding Harry's eyes now.
Nothing of that sort happened. She got up and took a quick shower and opened her wardrobe. It was - everything seemed so old - as if she hadn't bought anything new for the past some years. She took out a green skirt and a light yellow shirt and got dressed. Then, she walked out of the room. The house - it was also different. She was on the ground floor of course and there were no stairs that went to the first floor. There was a dining room and a kitchen and a door that led to a sitting room and another door on the left side of the sitting room that led to another room - probably Dudley's. Her home had had the first floor too.
He didn't reply for a few moments - only looked silently at her before saying, "I'm not much hungry. I'll have a glass of milk."
Her green eyes flared before she spoke coldly, "What do you mean? He's writing my biography and was just taking our family pictures."
Ron enters and settles down beside Hermione, his eyes tired and asks, "So, where is Malfoy? How is she doing?"
Potter." Harry mumbled and heard a chuckle.
"Potter." Draco insists because he is already too late. When Potter doesn't reply, Draco pushes the girl hard enough that her feet stumble and she falls down on her ass, her elbows resting on the floor to prevent her head from hitting.
"On a serious note, I want you to promise me that you won't do anything to end you in Azkaban." Draco spoke and Harry looked into his eyes. Draco almost gasped when he see black fury in the depth of Harry's eyes. He realized that Harry wanted to kill them and this was the exact thing he was worried about.
He summons a glass of water and she drinks it great-fully.
"Where were you? " Draco asked suspiciously and his voice was angry.
Harry looked at his friends and smiled.
"No. I am fine. I need to talk to them. They are my parents." Draco said and moved towards Lucius and Narcissa. Narcissa was knelt on her knees, sobbing her heart out and Lucius was hugging her to calm her down. His own eyes were red rimmed.
Draco breathed, relieved beyond measure that Harry had not lashed at him and took the letter. It was from Dudley Dursley. His eyebrows rose in shock at the surname.
Having been literally kicked out by more than five interviewers, he decided to ask Potter for job as a potions professor. He likes the idea of teaching potions at Hogwarts. It's a peaceful and a satisfying job and maybe Scorpius will hate him but Draco can't take his decisions on the basis of what his arrogant and spoiled son wants. Finding his degrees was very difficult. Pansy gave him an hour to do it. Draco literally turned the entire manor upside down before mother told him that the folder was in the lowermost shelf of his father's wardrobe.
Harry looked at him and rolled his eyes "As if you would let me."
It was weird, he had often thought. They would ask him for his consent and he would nod with utter pain in his eyes. Why did they never notice his helplessness? Is pleasuring yourself so important that you do not even think about the other person's sanity, of his dignity?
A couple of moments pass before Draco realizes that he has company. He blinks a couple of times and turns his head towards the entryway and is utterly shocked to see Severus standing there. Frankly speaking, he is beginning to wonder if he is in some alternate universe.
"Draco." Mother murmurs and Draco looks blankly at her. She wants to be alone right now, not because she is afraid or anything because she isn't. It's over- the war- Voldemort- everything. She wonders if her life is over too.
"Yes, Harry. I want you to be Draco's partner for this case." He sighed and then turned to look at Weasley, "You can help them if you want or you can take an extended leave if that's what you want."
"Yes, Mr. Malfoy-Potter." The girl spoke and hurried to oblige her boss.
Skeeter's smiling widely. The woman's fond of Harry. Actually, everyone is fond of Harry, everyone except Draco Malfoy of course. The small boy loses no opportunity to tease Harry. It's absolutely hilarious, particularly when Lucius brings his son over, stating that Draco interrupted his meeting to rant about Harry.
Snape sighs before heading towards Malfoy's room. Harry wishes he could get the man to give in before settling down on the sofa. He places his feet on the table before switching the television on.
Her heart started racing. How could she have time travelled. What was this?
Draco walked towards the man and they looked at each other. Draco's eyes were calm and Harry's were burning and suddenly Harry pulled him by his hips. Draco gasped, startled by the sudden movement. He relaxed when he found himself in Harry's close embrace. Harry's hands were trailing all over his body, though they had not yet crawled inside his shirt or trousers.
He wondered if he had imagined a soft kiss on his forehead before the music continued.
When, even after knocking twice, no-one answers the door, he just opens it. The sight that greets him freezes his feet. They don't notice him and Narcissa is about to scream again. He closes the door hurriedly and murmurs, his voice alarmed, "What happened?"
He can feel Draco's eyes burn at the back of his skull as if urging him to look at him. However, he doesn't. He doesn't as much as peak at the blonde.
Harry slammed his hand on the table and snarled "That's it. This is where everything gets stuck. You don't bloody trust me."
"I am sorry." Harry repeated and as expected Draco did not reply again. Draco used to sing for him in the early days of their marriage and had stopped when Harry had stopped appreciating him. Harry felt like hearing Draco again and so he requested "Will you please sing for me? I want to sleep and my leg hurts."
Lucius stares at the two five year olds playing in his garden. That the dark lord could come back and destroy this terrifies him. That he could turn Lucius and Narcissa into his puppets and hurt Draco and Harry makes him tremble although he doesn't allow anyone to witness it, anyone except his oldest friend Severus and new friend Sirius of course. Lucius would like to claim that he's allowing Potter's brat inside his manor because it'll eventually help him. He would also like to say that he hates enigmatic little Harry Potter but it would be a white lie.
"Draco, no matter what-" He stopped because tears had gathered in his eyes again. His vision was blurred as he continued, "It does not matter who does it Draco. You have to back off if you don't want to."
Draco knows what's he doing. She had heard rumors but she hadn't experienced anything remotely close to this in her prior auditions.
"And I love you too." Draco replied wondering about the reaction of others to their sudden decision. But then he shook his head.
Black was staring at him and so was Weasley. Potter was staring at the wall now as if it was the most important thing in this entire world.
As usual, he reached Gremmauld completely pissed. He moved towards the stairs, stumbling along the way. He should have known better then trusting himself on the stairs when he was completely drunk.
After a silence of five minutes, Draco turned towards Harry and buried his face in his shoulders because Hermione was right. She was looking at Harry and he whispered, feeling grateful that she was trying to help "She is right. You need to heal. Do not feel sorry." They needed a healer's perspective.
As expected Draco flinched and asked stiffly "Why? Is there something you need to talk about?"
Disclaimer: All rights belong to Rowling and the relevant corporations. I make no money from the publication of this "work."
Their faces wear similar expressions - Weasley is looking very white and Granger's eyes are bright. Black is glaring at father whereas mother's eyes are damp. Severus- he is difficult to read. He is gazing out of the window. One part of my mind wonders if he is even listening but the other part can read signs of rage in his posture, the way his hands are clenched in tight fists, the way his teeth are gritted, the way his eyes are twin pools of simmering rage.
"No," Harriet answered to which Dumbledore murmured, "I see. As it happens, Mr Malfoy is right. We are, in fact, in some other dimension."
fight Lucius to overthrow him."
"NO." They yelled at him and he continued "Bygones are bygones and I have moved on." Of course, his fingers trembled on Severus's shoulder and he averted his gaze.
"We are there. Calm down. I will call Dumbeldore. I will use fireplace to contact him. Dudley is going to pick you up and bring you inside. Soon it will be okay." The fact that uncle Vernon is the one saying these words is a shock.
Lucius stayed quiet, looking into his eyes and Harry turned to look at Narcissa. She averted her eyes in shame.
But right now, he had to speak to Draco and request him to trust Harry. He walked towards Draco's room, the photos and letter clutched in his hand.
"Their are certain things I want to talk to you about." Draco spoke abruptly and very seriously and Harry stilled, already knowing what was coming next "I want to talk to you about your relatives. I think you need closure as well. I want you to talk to Remus and Sirius and I want us to meet my parents and Severus as well."
"I was being stupid. You always added extra raisins and caramel for me. Nobody puts caramel in Treacle Tarts. I loved it and often waited for you to make it again." Harry stopped and waited but Draco did not answer so he continued "I should have told you. I am sorry that I didn't."
"Honestly, Hermione. You should calm down a bit. You are being over obsessive. It won't do you any good and Harry would be irritated by this." He snapped at her and she snapped right back "It won't stop me from advising Harry."
"Good bye Weasley. Have a nice life. You too Pans and Black." Draco sneers at them and Pansy flinches on hear her nick name from his mouth. Black looks at the floor in defeat.
Harriet breathed and was about to remove the cloak when she saw Malfoy head towards the stairs that ended at the seventh floor. She narrowed her eyes and followed him because why would he do that when Dumbledore had forbidden it. Malfoy was upto something and she was sure that he was responsible for all this.
Draco did not reply and started getting ready for the meeting with delegates. When Harry spoke softly "Wake me up when they arrive. I will stay inside the library. It is on the same floor.", he did not reply, but the relief that he felt was priceless. He walked softly towards Harry and noticed that Harry's eyes were closed. He did not know what compelled him to do it but he knelt down and kissed the corner of Harry's lips softly and gently. Harry's eyes remained closed but his lips upturned in a smile.
"Ah! He's in his room. First room on the first floor. You can take your friend with you." Vernon answers on her behalf and Harry runs out of the room. The other child follows him.
Draco was hanging, a rope around his neck, his body trembling and his mouth open in an attempt to breathe. Harry shouted a spell that cut the rope and Draco's body fell on the bed.
"HARRY. IT IS A NIGHTMARE. GET UP." Draco shouted and shook his shoulders and Harry's eyes shot open.
Potter did that although she didn't look happy about it. Bill wasn't there and the rest of the Weasleys were looking at Potter and the twins with idiotic smiles.
" I- I didn't. Draco are you insane?" Ron shouted, blood dribbling from the corner of his mouth and Draco punched his chest "You did. Get out of my house and my life. Let me live in peace with my husband."
"I was in the middle of something, Percy. I need to leave," said Potter. Creevy pleaded, "Please, this is the last one."
His musings and staring at Harry was interrupted by a knock and a sudden opening of the door.
The messy haired man started mock-snoring and hugged Draco close to his chest. Draco shoved the man when the tapping became insistent "Harry. Wake up. Please, the owl is irritating me. It must be a ministry owl. Stupid things, always insistent and annoying."
Severus sighs before nodding, "yes. Yes, I will."
"Why didn't you give proper clothes to her?" He asks. Draco's mouth is opening and closing and her eyes are clenched tightly. Her arms are wrapped around her frame and he is so so sad for her.
"Enter," he muttered a few seconds later and Albus came in, his green eyes wide with something akin to a mixture of horror and pain. The boy had inherited his hair and eyes and the habit of wearing his heart on his sleeves. He had also inherited Harry's tendency to feel others' pain.
"I shouldn't have returned home late. I shouldn't have broken your trust in the first place, But trust me Draco. I never cheated. I loved you and I have always loved you. I never even looked at another man or woman. I was just being rebellious. My relatives did not let me go out. They used to lock me inside the cupboard and later on in my room. I was given food through the cat flap. I was coming late because I could not because I wanted to ignore you." Here Harry stopped and looked at him, his face white and then red. Draco looked at him, completely stunned and realized that Harry had said all that by mistake. Harry was embarrassed and Draco knew that he had to handle the situation carefully because this meant that Harry had just been ignoring his own past demons.
Each scar had its own story and Draco had been fighting internally with every memory for a decade.
"Harry, please-" He moaned and Harry started teasing the other nipple. "Please just-"
A few seconds later Harry answers him or rather puts a question in front of him, "Can you honestly say that you want to sleep with me?"
Harry finally stood up and Draco looked at him "You must talk to them.. They are your friends."
"You can go now." Harry said and they left. He sighed and locked the place. He was about to floo home when he heard an insistent tapping on the window. He frowned and turned to looked at it.
The boy's parents - those filthy blood-traitors were just about to come to pick him up and he had decided to finally kill the boy today when no-one would expect it. When he saw the gate of the Dursley house open just a little, he started walking towards it. He was fortunate that the boy had decided to come outside before his parents had arrived. It would literally be so easy. An Avada Kedavra and that's it. The boy peaked outside, his entire body inside. Only his face was out. Expecting the kid to close the door and wait inside until his parents arrived, he sighed and leaned against the wall of another house, his wand in his right hand, ready to cast.
"I detest Lucius. Can you get on with the tale so that I can kick him out of here." Potter snaps at her and she makes a face, "Okay."
"Let's go inside before something else ridiculous happens," Pansy muttered, her face still very pale and her arms crossed as if she was cold. Draco could imagine how worried she must be. She was a successful interior designer and had worked really hard to reach here.
Sirius watches him astonished and terrified eyes.
"Shall I go?" Harry asks gently. Albus looks at him and shakes his head.
"Do not ask me. Do not talk to me and just fuck off from our lives." Draco snapped and stepped in front of Ron, Hermione and him. He was about to speak but Hermione squeezed his shoulders and so he kept quiet, noticing that Ron's silence was also caused by Hermione.
Stood at the entryway, Albus regards his graceful frame. He is a piece of art. Albus can stare at him for an entire lifetime. He has flawless skin and defined cheekbones. Albus wants to cup his cheeks and caress them and taste his full red lips and card his fingers through his soft blonde hair-
"Nine" Draco replied and Harry nodded before leaving the room.
Harry wondered what Severus meant when he asked Harry to be close to Draco during that ministry party that was about to occur in a couple of days.
Draco stared at Black. When he was informed that the head auror wanted him to help with this case, he hadn't known that the said had auror was Sirius Black. With his usual smirk and dancing eyes, he still looked handsome and he could see why his godfather fell for this man. That he would go from an escapee from Azkaban to the head auror was a considerable feat in itself. But that's not what had stunned him speechless.
Harry has decided to go. Or has he? And whatever will he wear?
"Malfoy? Malfoy, is that you?"
It was none of anyone's business how much it had hurt him to watch the Quidditch match through the window, as short as it had been.
"I have never lost a thing against you. In fact, if I remember correctly, Malfoy, it is you that are always being ridiculed when we play Quidditch, for instance."
. Doesn't even know how to
Two things. First: TW for self-loathing and suicidal thoughts.
"Are you completely insane?" asked Pansy in an icy tone. "This is not a problem of who cares about whom. This is about survival and we are only children playing at a war of grown-ups. You don't understand shit of what's happening, so I ask you again, what is your game? And be very careful, Granger, because this little association ends the moment I walk out of that door."
"I know that you would never ask for my help because I'm Harry Potter and you hate me and blah blah blah. I understand that, so I'm not offering. But if it ever came to a moment where you needed to vent, or to lean on someone, or just a friendly shoulder, you can tell me, okay? I know what you are going to say that it makes no sense and that it's the dumbest shit I've ever said but-. Just-. I just want you to know that I'd be willing to be there if you needed me. No questions asked."
It was Potter's turn not to know what to say. Or maybe he knew, but he was holding it for some reason.
"It's simple, Potter. I have physical needs. Please, don't think that I care about you. You are extremely uninteresting, and you are not particularly hot either," he lied without hesitation. "But you are a guy, and I happen to like guys."
It had gone
"Yes, but we owe him the chance to explain everything, and he has all the rights to do whatever he wants to do, and we have to respect it and support him-," started Ron, in a speech that seemed well prepared.
Harry wanted to check his fever because Malfoy was being delusional and Harry had never expected, not even in his wildest dreams, that he would ever hear that from Draco fucking Malfoy. A too high temperature was the only explanation Harry could come up with, but that implied touching him, and Harry could not just go and touch him. He simply could not, not after his little speech on how cool muggle art was. So he buried himself in the book that he was holding and read. He did not understand a thing of what his mouth pronounced, but he kept reading until his throat hurt and his eyes were dry.
"That would be honestly surprising, I cannot picture you talking about a topic with an ounce of interesting in it."
i'm sorry for the amount of time it took me to post this chapter :(
It was not the first time that he was that close to Malfoy. Fighting in non-magical ways involved a lot of invading the other's personal space. But it was different now. Malfoy's silver eyes, which were always cold, hiding all his emotions, now flickered, transparent and deep. It was fascinating. The grey in his irises stirred like an ocean in the middle of a storm. Wild. Free.
And then he said, "Potter, Malfoy, you are together."
Draco squinted his eyes at him. He hated what it did to him when Potter was his noble sacrificed self. Especially so when the object of his nobility and sacrifice was Draco.
had happened.
Bloody hell.
Hermione could read the distress in Harry's eyes loud and clear, and her heart broke a bit. She couldn't help but feel that Harry identified with the stuff he claimed Malfoy was going through. And she felt powerless.
