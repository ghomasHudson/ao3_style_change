Draco was so distracted by his thoughts, he didn’t hear the knocking on his office door. When Harry entered, Draco hardly even noticed.
Draco nearly commended him for his logic. They were desperate, that much Draco knew from his chat with Robards. Although, it worried him to know just how desperate they really were.
Draco narrowed his eyes at her, “You’re evil, Parkinson. Fine, I’ll take you to get some damned food, just give me a bit to get ready.”
From their previous conversations, his job seemed much more interesting than what Draco did, which was fixing, repairing, and analyzing Dark artifacts. Most of his days resulted in desk work, taking notes, writing reports and assisting the Ministry when they called upon him – only on occasion was he able to actually
The curse-breaker shook his head before looking at Draco, “I told your father he was crazy, trying to fix that
would be used to open such a well-guarded artefact. As it opened, revealing the artefact inside, suddenly everything made sense.
Narcissa finally put down the letter to look at him, hard and unwavering. This look would have intimidated a younger Draco, but he was a man now. He was tired of living up to impossible expectations.
Anthony turned to Draco, with a playful grin on his lips, “You Slytherin lot are crazier than I thought.”
“You know, I was just starting to think you’re alright,” Harry called out to him as Draco exited the room, “But you’re still the same arrogant arsehole you’ve always been!”
“Our family owns a chateau just outside of Paris, but Robards informed me it was already searched.” Draco replied, feeling quite frustrated by the question, “If I knew that answer, do you really think we’d be here in Luxembourg right now?”
Draco nearly laughed at that, but all he could manage was a snicker, “We couldn’t be more different, really.”
Draco glanced at the sealed case, fascinated by the strong locking charm that kept the artefact enclosed inside. This was powerful magic at use. What could possibly be inside?
Draco and Blaise hadn’t always gotten along when they were in school, especially in sixth year, but they always had respect for one another. Pansy, who was very close with both, was usually the one who brought them together during outings. After the war, neither men had felt the need to continue whatever grudge they had back in school. Since then, they were on better terms, but still hadn't kept in contact all that much. Draco, however, noticed that the man had changed quite a bit since the last time he saw him. He was taller, more muscular – in Draco’s opinion, he was pretty fit.
“Pans, if you were a bloke,” Draco slurred, not realizing how loud he was being, “I would let you take me home and fuck me.”
“When are we to depart for Rotterdam?” He asked, though his voice shook in the beginning. It was hard to notice to the untrained ear as he coughed through it, but to Draco, it was clear as day.
“I saw Pansy today. Pansy Parkinson. Do you remember her?” Draco blurted out without really meaning to.
“I know you’re angry with me,” She spoke calmly and evenly, but her eyes stayed fixated on the folded hands in her lap, “but I’ve only ever wanted what’s best for you.”
Draco turned beet red, while Anthony shyly smiled to himself before heading inside. The rest of the party seemed to take notice of Blaise’s words and all of them had begun to tease the pair.
Draco rubbed the back of his neck while his face burned a scarlet red, “Ah, well, you see – the thing is…”
It's been a long time since I felt comfortable enough to share my stories with the world, and your words of encouragement have urged me to keep going. Thank you for taking the time to read my story, and I promise I'll see this one through.
Harry shook his head, “I doubt Robards would say anything to him this early. Once he accepts, however, he won’t have much of a choice but to help us find him.”
His theory was proved correct when he finally reached the terrace to find Potter and his crew leaning against the railing, overlooking the streets with drinks in their hands. They hadn’t spotted him yet, but Draco felt his heartbeat slamming against his chest all the same. Had he not been in such a crowded place teeming with Muggles, he would have cast a disillusionment charm on himself to seem more inconspicuous. Luckily, the place was crowded with enough Muggles that he blended in with the crowd well enough. When he reached the opposite end of the bar in which Potter and his friends stood, he ordered a Guinness, notably facing away from the group. When his beer was finally handed to him, he muttered a single word spell, which muted nearly everything around him except for the voices of Potter and his friends.
There were very few precious moments throughout his life when Draco found himself unable to say anything. He was always quick to the punch – good with his words. This time, however, Draco felt that if he were to say anything, he would surely fumble, so he opted to stay silent, waiting for the moment his mouth could open again.
A moment passed before he recognized his surroundings, getting used to the unpleasantness that came with apparating. He hated doing it but it was awfully efficient. As he stepped over to the front door of his flat, he paused, feeling that something was off. Scanning the door with his wand, his heart hammered in his chest upon realizing his protection charms had been broken. Someone was inside
The pleasant feeling in his stomach dipped at the question. He hadn’t told her yet and now he has to tell her in a Muggle coffee shop? After not seeing her for three years?
Draco was shocked to hear that. Of all the people in the world coming to his defense, he never thought it would ever be Weasley.
The Malfoys were stunned by the revelation. Lucius looked as if he would keel over right then and there, while Narcissa just stared, mouth agape.
A pause ensued. He was relieved it was Blaise. Sadly, it didn’t make him feel much better about the current situation he was in.
Draco found himself drawn to the portrait - De val van Ixion - whatever that meant. It portrayed a man falling to a fiery death, wielding a face of terror as Hell burned all around him.
He turned to the others to find that most of them were slack jawed. Except for Potter, who stared at him was such intensity, he thought he might pass out. Or maybe that was the alcohol. Draco really couldn’t tell.
Blaise was the first to greet the two outsiders while Pansy continued to chatter with Millicent about whatever it was that females chatted about. Draco, looking mildly uncomfortable, sat next to Theodore, who was at least a friendlier face to see.
“Merlin!” Draco exclaims when the male voice coming out of nowhere startles him from his fascinated state, nearly making him drop his journal. He whips out his wand and looks around frantically before noticing the portrait on the wall behind the dining table.
“Potter.” He interrupts him coldly, clenching his teeth at the sinking feeling in his stomach and starts pulling down the fabric bunched around his elbow. “I don’t need your pity.”
Their gaze lock for an agonizing moment before Draco breaks away abruptly, turning to open the door that leads to the Black family library.
“It’s not pity.” The other boy rushes out and grabs Draco’s wrist, gripping hard, colors climbing up his cheeks. “I—”
“Sure — ” Draco stops when the full meaning behind Harry’s words actually occurs to him. “Oh. You can’t come inside. Not yet, anyway.”
“I was hiding under my cloak, watching you. You pointed your wand at him, and I was so certain that you were going to go through with it. But then you didn’t, and only after a long time did it occur to me how wrong I was about you. It never was your choice to become one of them, just like it was never my choice to become the Chosen One. We both did what we had to do to save those we love, so who was I to claim the moral high ground?” Potter stares intently at the crisscrossing scars over the faded Dark Mark, examining, sadness and regret lingering in those piercing emerald eyes, “I still think about it sometimes, that day in the lavatory, instead of throwing
“What did it feel like, lying to your aunt and Voldemort for him?” Merlin asks bemusedly, “Tossing your wand to him when you know it could get you killed?”
Still mostly Drarry because the chapter was getting long, but it leads into some important stuff about Merlin next chapter, promise.
“In your dreams, Malfoy.” He beams warmly at him, radiating hope like the morning sun, and Draco wonders in a daze if this really is some bizarre dream because Harry Potter has never smiled at him like that. Those eyes are glinting playfully, but with a hint of caution and restraint.
Draco tries not to flinch at the mention of what happened that night, but the concerned look Potter gives him makes him want to retreat.
“I’d apologize if I were you.” Lovegood suggests almost casually, “If you don’t want Professor Flitwick to hear about how you collaboratively cheated on your last Charms exam.”
“Mother just sent it to me from Paris. She got you something, too.” He tosses the box to Harry, and he catches it easily.
“I think that’s a good idea.” Potter schools his expression into something relatively neutral, “Could you let Professor McGonagall know, Luna?”
“And to find out where you might be. I thought if I knew ahead of time then maybe I could — ” He starts regretting it then, because lying would’ve been so much easier. “Help.”
“They’re high-end wizarding glasses, Potter.” Draco rolls his eyes. He could be such a Muggle, sometimes. “They magically adjust to your eyesight as well as the lighting. They’re also dust and moisture resistant, so you don’t have to — ”
Before he knows it, he’s reached the end of the corridor and closed his eyes, requiring the room. The familiar humming noise accompanies the door as it emerges, and a feeling of déjà vu washes over Draco as he remembers, two years back, how he would arrive at this door every night with dread weighing on his chest like a rock. He’s never going to admit it out loud, but his decision to fix the room is purely sentimental—He had made all the wrong choices here. He had died and was reborn here. It means too much for him to allow it to be reduced to ashes and forgotten forever.
“Wait, Grimmauld? In London?” Draco raises an eyebrow at him in surprise. “Isn’t that the Black ancestral home?”
He can’t help but gape, and Potter winces slightly at the expression on his face but doesn’t make a move of letting him go. The room’s quiet, too quiet that it makes him panic, wondering whether Potter could hear the rattling thumps of his heart, threatening to burst from the confines of his ribcage.
“Consider it atonement, if you must, but don’t give up.” He murmurs, withdrawing his hand, and looks up to catch Draco’s eyes, his voice gentle and almost pleading, “Have we not lost enough?”
“Didn’t work out that way in the end, of course,” Draco adds weakly, remembering all the nights he spent alone in his room, clutching to the radio he had stolen from his mother and wishing for any traces of
Harry reaches out for the fresh wound this time, and Draco doesn’t have the heart to stop him. He pours a few drops of Dittany onto his chest and gently rubs it over the wound. Draco would worry if he could hear his heart hammering in his ribcage, if he weren’t so busy greedily soaking up all the attention that he’s been craving for years.
“Have you not been listening to me for the past five minutes?” Draco rolls his eyes and huffs, looking appalled by his stupidity. “He wanted to make his private residence into something useful when he left Hogwarts.”
“He said ‘thank you’,” The older Slytherin looks pained at the memory. A sad smile tugs at the corner of his lips and he shuts his eyes, like he’s trying to stop tears from falling. “He told me to never change.”
“I believe I still owe you an apology.” He blurts out before he could regret it, letting the alcohol-induced impulse surging in his bloodstream take over his sensible head for once, “I’m sorry. For all these years.”
Draco barks out a laugh as Potter lands on top of him, surprising even himself. The Hufflepuffs a few feet away are openly gawking now, slack-jawed. They start whispering something surreptitiously amongst themselves, but Draco really can’t care less, because he’s too preoccupied with the feeling of hot breath brushing his cheek. Potter is gazing at him, his green eyes sparkling.
.” He sighs, setting his mug back down on the table with a frustrated thud. The wizard in the portrait doesn’t even bother feigning surprise at his answer.
“Me, of course,” Draco says proudly, but as soon as he says it seems to deflate a little. “Not that I had anything better to do while on house arrest.”
“I’d be happy to guide you in fixing it, if you’d like.” The wizard in the portrait says, and Draco’s eyes widen in surprise.
“Don’t you think I at least deserve to know after suffering through seven years of your hopeless pining?”
Draco could tell from the cautiousness in his voice that Potter probably has a vague idea of what the answer might be. He could lie, of course, but at this point it’s rather useless. Besides, between the two of them, there have been more than enough lies.
Not that there’s much to be seen, but Harry takes him through the foyer into the living area, then up the stairs. He had spent his summer tearing this place apart, removing any spells or objects that could even resemble dark magic despite Kreacher’s very vocal protests. It took so long that he never actually got around to doing any redecorating, and the house still looks as dreary as the day he inherited it.
“Alright, the station’s pretty lousy, I’ll admit.” Potter doesn’t seem to notice his little existential crisis though as he keeps talking, “But there aren’t many to choose from.”
He remembers that incident on the train, how his blood was boiling in his veins at the thought of Potter trying to stop him, Potter
“This is one of those stories obliterated by history.” The young wizard in the portrait smiles wistfully, “Or romanticized, depending on where you stand.”
He’s pouring himself a cup of coffee at the Slytherin table when his owl swoops down and drops a parcel on his lap gracefully. There’s a letter attached to it, and from the looks of the expensive monogrammed parchment envelope, it’s from his mother. He sighs. It’s about time she heard.
Potter’s silent all of a sudden, looking like he’s scrambling for an answer but can seem to find a plausible one. He opens his mouth, hesitates, and closes it again. And as if his heart has just been dropped from high above the clouds, Draco’s suddenly hit with an all too familiar sharp twinge in his chest. He shakes his head in mockery and ill-disguised disappointment, hating himself for his stupid, ridiculous
“You don’t have to, I can manage the walk alone,” Blaise paid the bill this time around, exiting the establishment with Draco following close behind him.
In the midst of twilight, when the silver crest of the moon is just barely visible, the clouds disperse and tiny, bright stars dance to the silent night. That is when Draco is most at peace. He found solace then - clinging to the inevitability of the darkness washing over him like a wave of shadows, covering the land that was once illuminated by the sun and now enveloped by the dusk. When all else failed, he could always look forward to this. People may disappoint him, life may disappoint him, but the moon was constant, forever reminding him that the day was done and another would soon begin. One hopefully better than the last.
Robards was the last to enter, as he moved swiftly into the room just a moment after Draco and Blaise did.
The Head Auror led him through a series of hallways and doors until he reached the heart of the Auror department. This was where numerous desks and offices belonging to all of the Aurors were located as well as the break room, an audience chamber, and the evidence room. As Draco followed him into the center where an enchanted chalkboard, likely donated from Hogwarts or Beauxbatons, wrote new information as several Aurors crowded around it, connecting lines and such to several pictures of faces he’s seen before - all Death Eaters. Some of the faces had a big red X marked upon them. Knowing it could only mean one thing, Draco felt his heart drop to his stomach. His father, Augustus Rookwood and Corban Yaxley were the only faces without an X on them.
“Find a way or make one,” Draco muttered under his breath as he climbed inside the well, “how typical.”
“I didn’t think the Hero of the Wizarding world would get out much. Especially at Muggle pubs.” Draco smirked at the man.
Mittens, pleased from all the positive attention he’s gotten, curled up in Draco’s lap as he nursed the half-filled drink in his hand - a concoction of vodka and something fruity that Justin, playing the bartender, had whipped up in a flash. All the women in the room turned and “aww’ed” at the sight. Irma scooted next to him on his couch, letting Mittens sniff her hand before he rubbed against it.
“Sébastien, could you tell us what Lucius sought you out for?” Blaise asked next, leaning against the other side of the wall, as the room was small enough for the four of them to take up most of the space.
When they arrived, Draco was unsurprised to find the team waiting for him there. Potter had an uncomfortable look on his face, as did Longbottom. It must have been quite a shock for the both of them to be assigned to a team with two Slytherins they went to school with. Irma, a short, pixie-haired vixen, filed her nails as she leaned into her chair. She looked bored and entirely unprofessional, but from Potter’s testimony, she was one of the best. Draco hoped that would be the case - he couldn’t afford any failures.
Harry chuckled to himself as Mittens rubbed his face aggressively against his hand. Standing up, he shook his head at Draco, not in disappointment, but rather something unknown to him, “You continue to surprise me.”
“No, don’t-” Anthony placed a hand on his arm to halt his action, startling Draco with his touch, “You don't have to. This is your home.”
Anthony, already in a besotted state, stumbled over one of Draco’s lounge chairs, and gripped onto the railing to steady himself, “Pansy sure knows how to throw ‘em.”
Robards shuffled in his seat, as if to prepare to stand, “As soon as I get confirmation. In the meantime, I’d suggest the team get acquainted with one another in Draco’s office. You’ll likely be working together for a while. Meeting adjourned.”
Weasley laughed, “Harry might be a prodigy when it comes to being an Auror, but bloody hell, what a shoddy dancer he is!”
“I’m sorry,” Draco pulled away from Harry’s grasp, taking a moment to grasp onto the sink, something solid to ground him to the present day, “I’m sorry you have to see me like this.”
“Now I see why you wanted to get away from all of us,” Pansy came to Draco’s side, slinging an arm over his shoulders, while Millicent and Theodore laughed at his pained expression.
“You should have warned me about it. The very last thing I wanted today was to have to entertain people at my flat,” Draco quieted down as he realized all eyes were on him now. He was angry, of course, but he didn’t want to yell at Pansy for trying to make him happy. Even if it was totally and completely misguided.
He hoped, foolishly, that it would be enough to burn his fears, his desires, and all awful memories of the boy who lived. As he stared into the flames, he almost wanted to believe it would.
Draco ignored his comment. Yes, he was angry, but not for the reasons that Blaise suspected. Mostly, he was angry that Blaise thought it was alright to Floo himself over to Draco’s flat at 4 in the morning, scaring the living daylights out of him.
It seemed that the Curse-Breaker lived beneath the catacombs, from the bed and bookshelves littered behind him. Yet, it didn’t explain why he’d go through such trouble to hide himself underneath a well covered by rocks. Perhaps he really didn’t want the Muggles finding him, or he had reason to hide.
change, there was no doubt about that, but it wasn’t a bad different. She looked beautiful, mature- not at all like the young girl he had once taken to the Yule Ball.
"I don’t know, Draco,” She rolled her eyes at him, “Maybe it has something to do with my parents being locked away in Azkaban, or it could just be my imagination.”
Irma nodded, springing enthusiastically when called upon, “Yes, I inquired to one of my contacts in Azkaban, a former Death-Eater that worked closely with the target, about the Time-Turner. He said it was designed to be untraceable and does not have a limit to when you can stay in the past, nor how far in the past you can go. It is likely that if we find the target, he will have hidden it somewhere near impossible to find.”
“Harry? Harry!” he shouted. Harry’s limp figure on the bed lying pale and still, even as Draco ran to it, his voice becoming more urgent as he went. The doctor, having gone unnoticed up until now, cleared his throat, drawing the blonde’s attention.
“A bad place!?” the raven said, startling the young witch out of her monologue. “Sure. A bad place. I respect Fleur all the more for not telling you, but you have no clue Hermione!”
Harry barely heard the click of the door as someone entered. He didn’t know how long it had been. It could have been minutes, or hours, or even days. The constant darkness wasn’t helping his perception of time. He looked up from where he was seated beside the blonde’s bed, the same place he had been when Mrs. Malfoy left, and saw the small elf. Tibby.
He often traded rooms with Hermione. She was a silent waker, who liked to be left alone to cry into her pillow, and Ron gave her that, but Harry… He woke screaming.
The bar was quieter than Harry had expected. Although he supposed that wasn’t unusual seeing as he had made plans for Sunday evening, and most drinking parties got together on Fridays or Saturdays.
“Well, there is only way to find out,” the impossibly impulsive boy announced before grabbing Draco’s hand, and, giving it a squeeze, opened the doors to the great hall.
“-and cookies,” Harry amended, “and then we can put all of this back together,” he said glancing between the half cleaned up kitchen and new boxes Draco had shrunk to fit on the table.
“Mitsy, I need you to give my cousin a hand please. He isn’t accustomed to magic. Provide him with guest access.”
He didn’t come back for the rest of the week, but he returned the next Wednesday and the Wednesday after that, and most Wednesdays since.
“Good morning, Harry! I wasn’t sure if you’d be awake, so I just thought I’d make some breakfast, but the toaster, didn’t really want to work for me. Or the fridge, or umm…. Sorry…” Dudley mumbled, as Harry’s eyes roamed over the destroyed kitchen. Previously charmed items were apparently resistant to… muggle use. Not surprising, really, but it would seem kitchen repairs was about to take priority on their list of things to do today if they ever wanted to eat again. There went their Saturday… Oh well. It would happen. Eventually.
He could hear his mother calling him, and absently he walked across the grounds to her. It was more lifeless and automatic than anything. He wasn’t really concerned where his body was taking him. It just didn’t matter anymore.
Given that Harry owled him a week later to ask when he wanted to meet up again for dinner, he suspected one of the latter two.
“Biscuits. I think. And yes, you will, and you are going to be a good sport about it.” Draco pouted, but with a soft glare from his husband relented and trailed after him into the dining room, arms laden with bowls and spoons.
By the time the next one turned up, Draco had a visited a series of libraries collecting books on botany. He had searched through the Wizarding Archives but found very little, and instead resorted to looking through the Muggle ones.
, and started reading where he had left off. He had long finished it and read a range of other books, but he liked the stories. He continued on reading the Warlock’s story, pausing every once in a while, to simply watch the blonde, contemplating Narcissa’s words.
“Yep, just let me wrap up this last order-” Harry started to say but was cut off by the sound of Draco’s laugh.
“It’s fine, Dudley. Just- maybe keep a low profile for today, and ask the elves for help next time?”
“Yeah, Harry obviously can’t greet you himself because he has to get ready with his team,” Weasley explained. “By the way, you’re coming with us to our house after Harry’s game. We have some work to do before Harry’s parents arrive.”
Draco’s shoulders visibly relaxed and his breaths came out more naturally. He looked forward and kept his eyes focussed on the lecture, but from time to time, he squeezed Harry’s hand back.
"Yes, I eat pasta," Malfoy clarified, still not looking at Harry, but his voice had lost the sharp edge and his scowl was gone. Before Harry could witness anything else though, Malfoy turned to put his belongings into one of the wardrobes, his back facing Harry.
“You play basketball?” Harry said as though this was the most interesting news ever. “My friend Ron does, too. Did you start playing in high school?”
Harry tries not to see that invitation as anything suggestive. It is near impossible. "Of course I'll stay. For as long as you need me."
Granger hurried to open the door. From his position, Draco was able to see two men walk into the house, both shrugging off their coats while Hermione yelled for Harry.
“I can’t imagine learning anything worthwhile from a beach game,” he retorted, amazed at the fire that burned in Harry’s green eyes in response.
Unable to help himself, Harry took the other wizard’s hand and held it to his chest. “I'm glad you're alright. Don't scare me like this.”
is a science spaceship, equipped to the teeth with advanced technology and scientists but as useless and vulnerable as aluminium foil if under attack. Hence why Harry’s
Draco crossed his legs and clasped his hands on his knee. The game had just started, and it was going to be a long one.
“Thanks. I just felt like telling you.” Draco paused for a moment. "Thank you for this morning. I was nervous about possibly not making it into the lineup. I wouldn't have been able to forgive myself if I had ended up on the bench."
Teddy continues playing with his dragon, turning his hair green to match the stuffed toy’s colouring.
Davies accepted the handshake easily, barely giving Draco a second look. Draco wondered if he had done something wrong.
Draco felt angry with himself. He hated making Potter sad, but he also knew he would be eaten alive if he went to the party. He'd be the only Slytherin, the only one who had been on the opposite side of the war. The only one with a Dark Mark. This conflict within him was like a bundle of thorns, pricking him from the inside. "Your friends hate me, Potter."
“Yes, let’s make more. Together,” Draco says. “If we fold one thousand of them, Uncle Harry will grant you a wish!”
When speech finally failed him, Draco wiped his face with a sleeve. Potter slid closer and engulfed Draco’s thin body in a hug.
Harry chuckled and shook his head. “I saw you at the outdoor basketball court. I was on my way back from work.”
“Don’t you have another tournament match tomorrow?” Draco asked worriedly when they were in the university gym the next morning. “You should be resting.”
“All the more reason I should stand by!” Harry cries. “What if you pass out or get a severe reaction?”
Draco wouldn’t have thought of his plan if Harry hadn’t spoken to him. He suspected Harry possessed a keen strategic sense that he was downplaying. “What did you think of the match?”
Malfoy somehow manages to wrap his arms even tighter around Harry. “Are you leaving?” he demands with a quiver in his voice that Harry attributes to the cold.
When he was in high school, he wore his normal spectacles for all occasions, even during sports activities. It was only after receiving a volleyball to the face and breaking his only pair of glasses that Remus had advised him on having proper eyewear for certain purposes. Now Harry owned at least three pairs of spectacles: for his usual day-to-day use, for motorcycle rides and for volleyball.
When Draco sat in front of Healer Park, he opened his mouth and, as though channelling Potter’s energy, shared his deepest regrets with a stranger with kind eyes.
With a grunt, Malfoy came to stand next to Harry, carrying a briefcase. Malfoy was dressed in a plain white shirt and crisp black trousers. His short platinum-blonde hair was swept to the side, fair strands falling into his face and curling at his nape. His eyelashes were as pale as his skin. His grey eyes were eyeing the Portkey suspiciously, his lips pressed into a frown.
The next day, Harry watched nervously as Malfoy took the first bite of a pancake. “Well? How is it?”
Now it was Draco’s turn to blush. “Yes, so I’d rather just continue with my existence on my own, thank you very much.”
“Thank Merlin. You’re as healthy as a peach now. I believe the potion is also out of your system. Now if you excuse me, I have three students in the infirmary needing Pepper-up. Good evening, gentlemen.” She heads towards the door, casting an adieu over her shoulder.
"What's happening?" Harry straightened up when Draco was called to the bench and replaced by Anthony Goldstein.
The events of each nightmare differed every night, but sometimes they repeated themselves. The most frequent version was the one where Harry really did kill Malfoy. Malfoy had bled to death in the bathroom because Harry didn’t know the countercurse to the very spell he himself had cast.
Suddenly his vision blurred and he found himself looking through a layer of translucent fabric. Potter had spread the Invisibility Cloak over them.
” Draco purrs his name hotly, that sneaky Slytherin, “but I don’t hold myself to the same martyr-like standards as you.”
Potter smiled. By the play of moonlight and shadows, Draco was reminded of how handsome the other man had become.
They both had fallen victim to an unfortunate mix of multiple potions, causing Draco to develop severe photophobia and Harry to compulsively lie whenever he spoke. The Healer had tried giving them antidotes but none of them reversed the effects. The Healer then estimated that the effects would last for only 24 hours and advised them to wait for the potion to naturally leave their systems.
Harry pauses. He knows the answer, of course, but is trying to decipher how this information is relevant.
Their session with Healer Kim today was different from before. Ever the cheerful lady, she was uncharacteristically solemn when her bubbled-head emerged from the flames.
When Draco turned back to Harry, the other man was awfully quiet. He was still wearing his helmet and those sporty tinted spectacles, so Draco couldn’t see much of his face or his eyes.
They take several minutes arguing over the best position to eat while hugging. When Harry points out that only Malfoy needs to hug him (and not the other way around), Malfoy’s face crumbles in despair and Harry embraces him for five minutes until he stops crying.
“Security and resources, Auror Weasley,” Robards answered vaguely. “You’ll understand when you become Head Auror.”
Don’t get Harry wrong: he recognises how much Faith Apparatus could help the Federation win The War, but—
This went on for several minutes, Healer Kim listing out symptoms and Harry and Malfoy shaking their heads at each one. When she asked whether they had taken their potions for today, they shook their heads too.
“Hold on to me,” Harry’s voice instructed while he pulled Draco’s hand to wind around his waist. Draco, already feeling off-balance, wrapped both his arms around Harry.
Narcissa returned to the master bedroom and Jumpy retired for the night after helping them settle in. Draco spelled off the lights, put his wand away and joined Harry under the sheets. He immediately found himself surrounded by Harry’s arms, heat and scent as his face was showered by kisses.
Harry knelt behind the players' bench, keeping his head low so that he could hide behind the other players. He noticed a guy with brown hair glancing at him curiously but he only focussed his attention on Draco. He carefully tapped Draco on the back.
The elevator halts and spills them into another hallway. After several minutes, they reach a nondescript door that would have gone by unnoticed if not for the large keypad next to it. Zabini punches in a long sequence of numbers and leans forward to let a panel scan his eyes. He steps through as soon as the doors slide open.
Face still warm, Draco forced himself to focus on the reason he had called in the first place. “I want to thank you for yesterday. Your advice really helped us.”
After receiving an undeserved scolding from Snape, Harry scurried up the bleachers, back to where he sat beside a bushy-haired girl.
“What’s this?” Seamus asks, a little out of line but instead of chastising him, Harry looks at Draco expectantly.
Harry usually sleeps in during the weekend, so when he wakes up that Sunday, he is confused why the sun isn't beaming on his face. It takes him a minute to recall that he has slept in Malfoy's quarters in the dungeons. Speaking of Malfoy…
Draco, usually very attuned to his surroundings, yelped in surprise and dropped the vial he was holding. It crashed into its cousins in the display. Harry heard Draco’s panicked inhale before quickly yanking him back, but the action caused Draco to fall back against Harry’s body, sending them both crashing into another cabinet.
“Well, apparently we did!” Malfoy exclaimed. “Back then, there was a virulent strain of the spattergroit that caused confusion and memory loss. It infected the entire stadium during Great Britain’s first match with Greece. Everyone there had no recollection of what had transpired. The global secretariat disqualified Britain on public health grounds. To save face, the Ministry doctored the history books a bit.”
Malfoy’s cheeks are rosy pink. "I’m sorry. Just— You said I'm hot. And then asked me to go to bed. Are you trying to court me, sweetheart?"
Rom smiled. “Sure, mate. I’ll owl you the cookbook. Glad you’re doing okay. So…” he paused, face turning concerned, “no nightmares?”
Harry feels annoyed when an officer comes to announce that the Captain is ready to see him now. Zabini, who has remained silent throughout Draco’s entire spiel, stalks out without bothering to check whether Harry’s following him. Harry signals for Seamus and Dean to head out first before turning his full attention to Draco.
“Sir, why can’t they be monitored here? At St Mungo’s?” asked Weasley. A really good question, Draco admitted.
“Something edible, I hope,” said Malfoy, his curious gaze indicating that he hadn’t missed the way Harry evaded the question.
“Can’t help it.” Harry made sure his hand was obscured by the tray before skimming the edge of Draco’s sharp jaw with a finger. “You’re beautiful.”
a new strain, though. I suspect the man you captured yesterday has been modifying them, both magically and genetically. That could be why you are not exhibiting the common symptoms. You might get them later. You might not get them at all. It is really difficult to be certain.”
It is so intimate and comfortably domestic. As he eats, Harry has to remind himself that they aren’t boyfriends or lovers. Even though he suspects Malfoy may have feelings for him, neither has confessed yet so it is still up in the air, and Harry shouldn’t jump to conclusions about—
Shrugging on Sirius’ old jacket, Harry walked to where his motorcycle, another gift from his godfather, was parked. He switched his round-rimmed spectacles with a pair of prescription motorcycle glasses before putting on his helmet.
Snape made everyone introduce themselves. Aside from his friends and the captain, Draco didn’t know anyone else. He did, however, look twice at Ron Weasley, because he remembered seeing him with Harry that morning. Unlike his bespectacled friend, there was nothing particularly special about the redhead. He was taller than Draco, skinnier with too many freckles.
Draco appeared unperturbed by the sudden change in climate. The wind was still strong here, though, so Harry obediently followed Draco as the latter trekked up a small hill.
Harry leaned in again as Draco met him halfway. He cupped Draco's jaw as their kiss grew deeper, both mouths parting. Draco grabbed his T-shirt, shivering when he felt Harry's other hand slide down the curve of his bare spine. He leaned back until his head rested on a pillow, pulling Harry with him, all this without ever leaving his lips.
The notion of being forced to stop doing something he enjoyed made Draco go cold all over, as though he was dunked in a well of iced water.
“Don’t be. I feel less tired now, hearing your voice.” There was a rustling noise from Harry’s end, as though he was adjusting himself on his seat to get more comfortable. “I was wondering when you’d call again.”
"I'm sorry I did this to you," he whispered. They somehow had gotten closer and Draco could feel his exhalations on his skin.
Malfoy makes a distressed sound in his throat. He has his back to Harry, so Harry doesn't know what Malfoy is trying to say (or stop himself from saying). He is still holding the plate for Harry, who suddenly isn’t hungry anymore.
“Do you want to know what I was doing at the apothecary when you bumped into me yesterday?” Draco asked the following afternoon after the potions’ effects finally wore off, hands around a steaming cup of tea.
Malfoy peers into the cauldron and studies the bubbling pink solution. Then he takes a ladle-full of the potion and pours it into a small cup.
Draco gritted his teeth, furious. He felt somebody grab his arm. Blaise gave him a loaded look, which Draco did
Draco quickly sized him up, a habit his father had ingrained in him. Harry’s black hair was unkempt, and his clothes were mediocre and cheap, but somehow he still looked presentable.
He had to pick up and decipher the social cues from multiple people and think of appropriate responses using his own wits with no previous interaction to work on. He managed in small doses, but after a while, he desperately needed a rest.
Harry himself had brought success to his volleyball team. Draco still found the rules confusing and maintained his policy of only watching Harry instead of the actual game. But he had learned enough common terms to contribute his ideas whenever Harry started a deep strategic discussion.
Sirius and Remus took their leave at around 5 o’clock, excusing themselves to a hotel to spend the night. They promised to come to Harry’s next tournament match on Monday before departing on Sirius’ motorcycle.
So he had no choice but to wait until after dinner, once Pansy had retreated to her room on the third floor. Draco stayed in his room on the second floor for another half an hour before trotting downstairs to the telephone, which was beside the three-seater couch in the sitting room.
Malfoy cursed under his breath as he slipped his wand back into his sleeve and walked further into the room. While he summoned his briefcase and started unpacking his clothes on the bed, Harry continued surveying. The bed was directly in front of the door. There were small bedside tables on each side of the bed, two wardrobes side by side against a wall to the right and a large window to the left. Just adjacent to where the wardrobes were was a door that led to an en suite bathroom.
The young man in the portrait nods, and Draco’s disbelief only deepens as he takes a closer look at him. The man’s sitting in a plain wooden chair, dressed in medieval peasant clothing that all seems quite ragged and worn. His faded blue tunic looks like it’s been washed too many times.
Draco flips through his journal and finds the note he had jot down and underlined weeks ago. He had feared that said “original form” would constitute an empty hallway or a broom closet half burned down, which would make his attempt at restoring the room to its full capacity rather difficult, but nothing could’ve prepared him for
“Huh.” That gives Draco pause. That would certainly fit, given that the room was constructed with medieval magic. “That sounds possible. I’ve looked all through the restricted section, though. Found nothing of it. Not sure where else I could look at this point.” And for some reason, Merlin just wouldn't tell him more about it, though he asks almost every time he visits.
“You’re either messing with me or you’re really drunk, Potter.” He shakes his head, and tries to dissuade his heart from leaping at whatever the other boy might be insinuating.
When Draco wakes up the sun is in his eyes. Light streams in from the gap between the curtains, too warm and almost blinding. He blinks rapidly to adjust before sitting up, still disoriented, his head aching like it might explode. He startles a little when he sees the dark-haired boy sleeping soundly next to him, his head oriented toward the wrong end of the bed. But before Draco can try to remember how he ended up falling asleep in Potter’s bed, he notices the time displayed on the clock on the opposite wall, and promptly panics.
So that's how he ends up sitting cross-legged on Harry Potter’s bed at midnight, fiddling with the buttons on his radio, while Potter sits next to him chewing a licorice stick, his feet dangling off the bed.
?” Pansy eyes him with suspicion, though she seems hesitant to determine whether he's lying. “So you’re friends, then.”
“No, Kreacher, thank you.” The elf looks a little put out at that but dutifully takes his leave. Draco turns back to Harry then. “Are you going to give me a tour?”
“He’s using you, Harry!” One of the girls shouts suddenly. “Can’t you see what’s going on? Surely you don’t want to associate yourself with the wrong sort. ”
The light in those deep blue eyes dims at Draco’s words, and although Draco’s slightly too buzzed to really think about what he might’ve said wrong, it doesn’t prevent his shock at what Merlin tells him next.
“Mhmm.” The other boy stirs awake and grumbles, before blinking open one eye to peer at Draco. “It’s Saturday, Draco.”
He knows that whatever this is, it’s probably going to end in disaster. But what can he do? He’s never had any semblance of self-control when it came to Harry Potter, after all.
Harry following him everywhere, it would be a hard one to dispel. Harry doesn’t seem to mind, however, which is bizarre since he normally hates all the lies Skeeter likes to spew about him. Surprisingly, Granger and Weasley have said nothing of it, either.
Draco blinks, twice, then stares at the outstretched hand in front of him. The memory from their first encounter at Hogwarts seven years ago flashes in front of his eyes, leaving him lightheaded and dazed, not quite able to believe that this is all real.
Salazar, Draco, if that’s not pining I don’t know what is. Don’t even get me started on how you sulked every time you saw him with Ginevra Weasley in sixth year.”
“He’s gone.” Draco breathes to him, confusion and anxiety evident in his shaky voice, “Merlin’s gone from his portrait.”
Archive’s email notification is still being weird, so sorry I’ve not be replying to comments, but I’ve read all of them now. Thank you all for reading and leaving your thoughts!
Harry doesn’t realize that he’s staring until Draco coughs lightly, a suspicious blush on his cheeks. He quickly backs up a bit to let the other boy close his door, and they walk down the narrow spiral staircase side by side.
Draco rolls his eyes in resignation and reaches into his robe pocket for his wand. Then he waves it at the mug and watches the still-warm tea swirl and turn into rum.
gossip around the Great Hall first thing Monday morning. He grossly underestimates how observant Potter can be, however. Before he could move much at all, Potter turns back to him and grabs him by the elbow.
“Then you should also recall that we were never on the best of terms with each other, ever since the day we met.”
. It’s built into the Room’s structure, so it’s on a much larger scale in terms of complexity and durability, and powerful enough to — withstand a Fiendfyre.”
Draco whispers those words to him before lifting his end of the cloak to duck out from under. He cracks open the door and quietly slips inside the room.
“Hey, I have great taste in music.” Potter elbows him in the ribs jokingly, in a movement so natural that if Draco doesn’t know better, he’d think that they’ve been doing this for ages. He realizes in a daze that two years ago, something like this could launch them into incessant taunts and perhaps even a full-on fight.
“It felt like — ” He pauses. Suddenly he’s back in that moment, to that flash of emerald green when Potter turned back and looked right at him, straight into his soul. His eyes were the same color as the killing curse, but they made Draco feel so
Draco must admit he’s a little stunned at that. Those young Ravenclaws seem to cower a little, too. After all, no one thought Lovegood could sound genuinely furious with that soft, dreamy voice.
It does remind him, as he heads down the hall to his own room, to owl Hermione about that whole Muggle Arthurian legend business.
“What a coincidence.” The other boy smiles after a flicker of surprise flashes across his eyes, “I’m sorry, too.”
He stands still in the middle of the empty hallway and listens. Soon enough, he picks up on the familiar heavy breathing, coming from maybe only a few feet away from him.
“I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself,” Potter replies caustically before turning his attention back to Draco.
In the common room, there’s a lone figure sitting in an armchair by the fireplace, reading a heavy tome. Harry pauses. It’s not typical of her to stay up this late by herself these days.
“Then I think I would know if I was dating him.” Draco sighs, exasperated. “How many times do I have to tell you not to believe everything in the gossip mill?”
“Thought I would be able to catch you here, Harry. Ron and Ginny and I leave for the Burrow tomorrow.” She pauses and turns to look at Draco hopefully. “I’ll see you two on Christmas, yeah?”
“Are you alright, Draco?” Potter reaches out, and Draco instinctively flinches. He looks a little hurt by that, but withdraws his hand in understanding nonetheless.
Potter laughs. At the sound, whatever feeble excuse Draco had been attempting to make is gone from the tip of his tongue. Harry Potter has never laughed like that in front of him. Not bitter, not mocking, not filled with disdain. Genuine laughter. It might just be the best sound he’s ever heard.
There’s a long, swollen red gash, stretching from near his right collarbone down to his sternum. It is a little worse than usual, but not terribly out of the ordinary — the hex did hit him square on the chest.
one of them, Potter.” Draco drops his gaze to the now blurred mark on his forearm, “What I’ve done cannot ever be undone.”
“During the war. I—” Draco stills his hand, sighing as the memory comes back to him, “I had to make sure they didn’t know what I was listening to.”
“Oi, get up. My clothes are getting wet.” Draco mumbles, despite not being quite ready to let go of the very warm savior in his arms.
“Oh. Right.” Harry rubs the back of his head a little awkwardly, realizing that he’s unlikely to be of any help for that. “I’ll leave you to it, then. Uh, just, holler if you need anything.”
It occurs to Draco then that he may have just found the Gryffindor equivalent of the Chamber of Secrets, and he hopes to Merlin that there’s not a thousand-year-old dragon or lion hidden in here somewhere. He glances down at the journal in his hand. This isn’t exactly what he had in mind when he set out to repair this room.
“But you had broom polish delivered three days ago.” Draco blurts out without thinking, then promptly snaps his mouth shut. He needs some coffee, and perhaps a hangover potion.
“I don't.” Staring straight into his eyes, Potter steps even closer and holds his gaze with newfound resolve, looking all too earnest and sincere now it makes Draco angry and hopeful all at once.
Silence looms over the space between them, the ticking of the clock on the wall is amplified thousandfold, echoing in the empty room.
“Who says that it has to be a one-time deal?” Merlin gets up to add a few logs into the fireplace and puts on a kettle, then leans against the wall with his arms crossed.
He slips out of bed and pulls on a jumper and some trousers. There’re great things about having individual bedrooms this year, except it also feels disorienting at times. He’s reluctant to admit that he actually misses how Blaise’s small snores and Theo’s incoherent muttering used to ground him in reality when he startles from a nightmare. Now he’s left with himself, alone in the silent darkness.
“Huh.” Pansy looked at him for another second, as if searching for something. “I believe you,” she concludes eventually.
Yet it is, somehow. Across from him, Potter’s hair is still a hopeless mess. A few unruly strands fall on his forehead, casting a shadow over the famous scar. They’re sitting ridiculously close to each other, their knees almost touching, and the heat radiating off of Potter’s body is just about the realest thing Draco has ever felt. On the radio, the man’s still singing, desperate yet hopeful, and it sounds like redemption.
They arrive in London the day before Christmas Eve. The trip is surprisingly pleasant, as many things with Draco these days tend to be. They get lunch at a nondescript Muggle Italian restaurant near King’s Cross before apparating to Grimmauld Place. Draco seems completely unfazed as the building pulls apart to reveal Number Twelve, and follows Harry up the narrow stairway with practiced ease. However, as soon as Harry opens the door, Draco’s startled by a loud screech coming from the foyer.
“Who said anything about Gryffindor?” Merlin looks almost confused for a moment, before suddenly laughing out loud, “Oh,
“It was on the front page of the bloody Prophet, for Merlin’s sake. Everyone was talking about it at breakfast.”
.” Potter spits out, irritated. “The war is over. What’s the point of winning if we’re just going to keep fighting?”
“You die at the Manor in mine.” He admits softly in return, surprising even himself. “It doesn’t help to dwell on hypotheticals, Harry.”
picked these. Inadvertently, anyway. A few years back they had been in Paris on holiday, his mother had caught him staring at these glasses while she was shopping for jewellery. She had cast a curious glance at him, and innocently asked whether he was having problems with his (perfect) eyesight. Draco had shaken his head and quickly stepped away from the display case.
Curiously, Hermione doesn’t ask where they’re headed, nor does she tell them off for breaking (the not really enforced) curfew, just casts Draco an amused look before closing her book and heading upstairs. Harry wonders what she’s seeing but isn’t telling him.
“Mother wanted to patch things up when they got to France. They’ve just been writing to each other. Anyway, she says hello. Open the package.”
“And I think both of us can use someone to talk to, don’t you?” Merlin blinks and gives him a kind smile, and the baby dragon made of flames curls up in his hand and starts snoring softly. “Now, time to say goodnight, Mr. Malfoy.”
“I’m talking about this, you prat.” Potter turns to him then and their eyes lock, the fog in those the deep pools of green parts to reveal unwavering resolve. He straightens his back and holds out his hand.
Draco sees out of the corner of his eye a group of Hufflepuff fifth-years walking by them just as he’s shoving some snow down the back of Potter's cloak. He sobers a bit at the alarmed expressions on their faces. Potter, however, clearly not having noticed the attention, lets out what could only be described as a loud squawk before whipping around and tackling Draco onto the snow-covered ground.
“Your upper limbs are attractive as well,” Draco added. “So is your face. And the rest of you. Anyway! Thank you for the ride home.”
Harry was distracted while preparing breakfast. He burnt the toasts, spilled sugar all over the kitchen counter and overcooked his eggs. The day didn't start off very well for him.
Potter had cut his hair short, though still untamed and unruly. He was clean-shaven and sported a new pair of round-rimmed spectacles. He had also grown since sixth year. Perhaps now that the Dark Lord was dead, he finally had time to eat properly.
“If I stay,” Harry said softly, giving Draco a look that was so open and earnest, it made the blond blush, “can I kiss you again?”
Closing the door with a scoff, Malfoy walks past Harry towards the sofa, sniffling along the way. He is wearing at least three layers of jumpers and a pair of thick cotton joggers, which look really odd yet really good around his slender legs. He flops down onto the sofa and grabs a small hand towel that he wipes his nose with.
'Iso', Harry quickly learned, was short for 'isolation room'. His was a small room with an even smaller ensuite bathroom. There was a single lonely bed and a small cabinet to store his belongings, which was useless right now because Harry had brought nothing with him from the safe house. Thankfully, he had his wand, and he used a Patronus to send a message to Ron.
“I suppose,” Draco replied, uncertain. “Maybe it’s pissed at me for taking it apart, and wants to make sure no one in the physical world can use it to rescue me.”
Pansy shot him a look that was a mixture of exasperation and pity. "Whatever. I have a shoot out of town tonight. I won't be back until tomorrow. Please remember to lock the door before you leave." When Draco nearly choked on his food, she smirked. "I know you go out every night, darling. Don't act so surprised. One day you'll tell me what you're up to."
he made — fuck Merlin and Godric. Harry considered himself extremely blessed to be the only one hearing those delicious sounds from Draco’s throat.
of Ron Disapparating, but he kept his eyes on Draco, whose cheeks were flushed. He was wearing a dark blue shirt underneath a crisp black jacket and matching black trousers. The blond cleared his throat and shoved a large white box into his arms, mumbling, “Happy Birthday.”
Harry’s eyes followed Draco’s fan as it spun around the room and nicked the necks of the perpetrators while simultaneously introducing a quick-acting poison that caused them to lose consciousness instantly.
Annoying Lucius had indeed been Draco’s intention, and he had gotten as far as getting Pansy to accompany him to the store, but he had chickened out after the first piercing. Repeating the process with his right ear hadn’t been necessary, because wearing only one earring was enough to make Lucius give him the silent treatment for weeks. The peace and quiet, while it lasted, had been worth the pain.
Harry laughed and was about to say that he could just bake more for Malfoy tomorrow, but his grin vanished when he saw the concerned look on Malfoy’s face. He froze when Malfoy leaned towards him and grabbed the sides of his head. His long fingers brushed Harry’s bangs aside and Harry could feel his hand against his skin and everything suddenly felt hot.
“Currently, there is no definite treatment for spattergroit,” Healer Kim continued. “We have potions to control the symptoms but the spores themselves will be excreted from the body naturally in ten days. Transmissibility reduces to practically zero after two weeks. I have just discussed with Head Auror Robards that I recommend both of you to be isolated and quarantined for that duration.”
It is just a simple brushing of lips. When they separate, they gaze into each other’s eyes for a moment before Harry brings up a hand to caress Draco’s cheek. In return, Draco cards his fingers through Harry’s black hair.
“You two have been unconscious since yesterday,” Weasley explained. “It's great that you found the perp behind the illegal potions ring, but you really should have waited for back-up to arrive before charging in.”
It was a short walk, and they were both healthy athletes, but as soon as the bedroom door closed behind Draco, they were both breathless with anticipation.
"Draco? Draco!" Harry shook his shoulders. When he didn't respond, he placed a hand on his chest, which barely moved.
As he was being introduced to Neville Longbottom and Dean Thomas, Draco started to feel uneasy. When Harry had to leave Draco in favour of salvaging the fruit salad (apparently Granger had tried to sprinkle crushed vitamins tablets on it), Longbottom pulled Draco to the window and started bragging about his garden. Then Thomas excitedly asked him extensive questions about Daphne, after having found out that she and Draco were old friends. Even Granger started conversations with him, mostly about studies.
Draco walked to the registration desk, which was manned by a thin woman with greying hair. There were two white doors beside her, each labelled with the name of a Healer.
Harry hissed but otherwise remained still when Malfoy applied several drops of potion onto the pustule. The potion stung, and there was a faint smell of burning flesh, but it was gone within seconds.
Back in his bedroom, Draco placed the trophy and certificate on his dresser, grinning proudly at his accomplishment.
Harry breathed heavily. The wind was picking up and he figured they should get moving, but he couldn’t move, not when Draco was gazing at him curiously. “They couldn’t locate your soul. They needed me to find you.”
Healer Kim smiled widely. "Certainly. But they would need to come to St Mungo's, enter this decontamination chamber with me and follow all the necessary precautions before I can allow them to make a Floo call to you. There have been rare cases of spattergroit being transmitted during Floo calls, so I am not taking any chances.
Harry crossed his arms, vexed. “Ron and I have the highest percentage of solved cases, I’ll have you know.”
Harry grumbled. "Thanks for your input, Hermione, but I don't think that's useful in my situation now."
Draco told Harry about his father’s impromptu visit to Snape’s house at the end of the summer and his first basketball meeting on Monday, including the newspaper smack. “Basically I have to practise harder if I want to be crowned the MVP," he sighed.
“Is this your first time watching Harry play?” Granger asked Draco, eyes shining with glee when he nodded. “Then you’re in for a treat!”
“I happen to remember you said there’s nothing you can learn from a beach game,” he teased, delighted when Draco abruptly pulled back and pouted in indignation. “That’s a tall order. You think you can handle it?”
“Good job, Potter,” Draco said sarcastically, grimacing. “Please remember next time you destroy my projects, that I’m the one who has to write the paperwork.”
Harry takes the plate from Malfoy and sends it together with the fork back to the coffee table. "Let's go back to bed?"
Blaise must have detected the sadness in his response, because he didn’t say anything more. Instead, he sat quietly with Draco for a few more minutes before returning to his department.
The chamber mimics a cockpit, but a much less sophisticated one. There is a smaller version of a Captain’s Chair in the centre of the cockpit, overlooking the large viewing screens that display the vast space beyond. Beneath the screens were two seats for navigators, and another off to the side for communications. There is nobody sitting there, and the stations are turned off.
Potter tugged back his right sleeve and dropped his forearm on the table for Draco to see. Right at the centre of his forearm were multiple black dots which Draco recognized immediately.
unleashes her missiles onto the enemy ship. Harry watches the explosion while behind him, Draco’s crew frantically works to do… something.
“We might, but only in the beginning,” Blaise said, saving Draco the trouble of explaining himself. “We just need a couple of trial runs to sync our tempo, then we’ll be good to go.”
On the bedside table was an old tennis shoe, which was the Portkey that would bring them to the safe house where they would spend the next two weeks together.
“Assuming your victim was poisoned with only one dose, from the size of your broken vial, I estimate maximum three millilitres,” Draco began as he moved quickly around the room, grabbing utensils and dropping them next to an empty cauldron. “Not many potions can knock a person out with that small volume, even fewer cause magic depletion.”
It was still the bedroom in his shared house with Pansy, but Harry now was practically his part-time roommate. Harry had a small section in Draco’s wardrobe for his clothes. Harry’s extra toothbrush and shaving cream had their own dedicated spots by the sink, but he used Draco’s soap and shampoo whenever he stayed over because he liked them better. In a corner of the room, a volleyball and a basketball could be seen side by side.
Being the centre of Potter’s attention was like standing on the surface of the sun. Draco’s skin burned at every contact with Potter’s hard body, but with the heat came pleasure.
“Stop, stop, stop!” Harry yelled, rushing to unfasten his helmet while still astride his motorcycle. “Come here. I want to kiss you.”
The bastard did not bother answering his question. Instead, from his own bed, Potter leaned towards Draco’s, eyes attractively green behind his round-rimmed spectacles. “Malfoy, are you alright? How are you feeling?” he asked seriously.
“But I doubt she has to tamper with her radio to listen to those, so where did you learn to do this?”
“Oh, it is. The room is capable of physical self-repair, but the transfiguration magic is damaged nonetheless.”
“Wow. These are nice.” He immediately takes off his glasses and puts the new ones on, blinking a few times to adjust. “And they fit perfectly. How does your mum know which ones to get?”
“Alright then.” Draco swallows whatever snarky comment he was going to make, and gestures at the cloak in Harry’s hand. Wordlessly, Harry unfolds it and drapes it over them both as Draco reaches for the common room door.
Harry has to choke back a laugh at Draco's thinly veiled annoyance. Then with a loud pop, Kreacher appears in front of them, looking more delighted than Harry has ever seen him.
“Mr. Malfoy,” Draco looks up to find those blue eyes glinting mischievously at him, “You’re standing in what used to be my residence at Hogwarts.”
“I do, although I had expected it to be severely damaged. That doesn’t seem to be the case anymore.” Draco looks down at his feet, trying to find traces of the fire on the impeccably clean stone floor.
Pansy bursts into his room the next morning. Draco groans and pulls the covers over his face. He probably should have seen this coming.
Alright, so they never actually attempted to clear up the whole dating rumor, though he supposes that with
He knocks on Draco’s door promptly at midnight with his cloak clutched in his hand, and Draco opens the door with a look of (delighted?) surprise in his eyes. He’s changed out of his school robes into a soft-looking grey jumper and black jeans —
! What a beautiful confession that was,” he snapped, venom dripping with every word. He turned from Harry then, and moved towards the edge of the bed to stand, not bearing to look at the raven anymore.
“It’s… it’s a -hostility thing. Instinctually, I know you have no ill intent towards me and therefore the feathers don’t sharpen around you.”
It was a Wednesday evening, so the Library was quiet - the students usually left their cramming for Thursday or Sunday nights.
The rest of the golden trio never joined them, but occasionally he saw them in the library, at a different table of course, just watching the two of them. Their gazes were filled with pity, and in the Weasley’s case, distrust. But they didn’t ever approach, so his thoughts never strayed to them long.
The war spanned out around him, surrounding him in darkness. Maybe it was a good thing Harry had turned him down. He didn’t want him in this. He didn’t want him in any part of this. He didn’t want him near him.
“His eyes are the most beautiful shade of emerald green you could imagine,” he smiled. There was a pause.
“Low blow Potter,” Draco drawled, “but I am fairly certain I know more than you seeing as you didn’t even know you were a wizard until you eleven.”
Several of the children split off from their group as they walked, usually when they saw their family, or sometimes, when they saw their bodies. Nobody was going to make it out of this war unharmed.
“Right, just… Draco?” the raven asked, his eyes pleading with the blonde to make this as painless as possible. Draco sighed, pulling out a hat.
He didn’t say anything, and Draco didn’t press. He wasn’t certain why the boy was here, but he wouldn’t be the one to initiate conversation. He wasn’t the one that approached the other man, and he didn’t have anything to say. That didn’t seem to be an issue though.
He inched closer, trying to keep his footsteps as soft as possible. The blonde’s complexion only got worse the closer he got to it. There wasn’t even a hint of colour on him. He was almost as white as his wings. He reached the bed an accidently knocked a glass off his bedside table. The raven flinched as it fell to the floor and shattered, but the blonde’s breath didn’t so much as hitch. He wasn’t even certain he was breathing.
Harry slept fitfully. Honestly it may not have been an exaggeration to say he didn’t sleep at all. The hours passed in fits of tossing and turning.
The sun rose early the next morning, shining gently through the curtains onto a sound-asleep Harry. His breath coming out in gentle snores. Blithely unaware and unconcerned with the trials and tribulations he was sure to face in the coming hours. It was Draco’s favourite moment of the day, besides the evening couch time of course. He seemed so at peace, and… that was something that they sometimes lacked.
“When you were dying - I thought you dead already - you called me here. I don’t even remember how I got here, but the bond or your choice or
The Draco’s eyes shone as he plucked the blossoms from their place and spun them betwixt his fingers, humming a very familiar tune among couples.
Regardless of anything else though, the thing he couldn’t get out of his head no matter how hard he tried, the most important thing: Draco was lying to him. Draco was lying to him and he didn’t know why. He didn’t seem to be hurting anyone or anything, so there were no issues there. He didn’t think Draco would do that anymore. Well, not counting the- yeah not even going to go there. No, the problem was he had lied to Harry. And it stung, more than he was willing to admit.
The witch, clad in formal robes - returning from said convention Harry assumed - sat on the edge of his bed. She just sat there for a moment. The familiar sensation of her magic the only sign that she was still in fact alive. Harry wondered if she was going to get up and leave, but she didn’t. a minute or two passed and he felt a hand rest against the tips of his fingers.
“Alright, that’s enough!” the headmistress said one day, having called the offending heads of houses into her office. “I don’t know why I expected you two of all people to have any of the maturity or dignity befitting of your age or position.” She shook her head. “I don’t know who started this-” Harry made to interrupt but she raised her hand to silence him, “and I don’t particularly care. I’m ending it. This will be the end of it, correct?”
They trudged out of her office, tails between their legs, though when Harry had made comment on that fact later Draco had most ardently denied the fact that a Malfoy would ever have done such a thing.  Harry merely smiled knowingly, at which Draco just glared.
The blonde smiled down at the growing piles of jars, glasses and vases scattered around his office ranging from his desk to the windowsill and even his bookcases. Several shelves of which were Muggle botany books about flowers and weeds. Dandelions and the language of flowers. Ultimately he found nothing of use, nothing that he could link to a sender or purpose let alone an identity, but it was a relaxing read when life became hectic.
It took a long time for Harry to go back to being himself. Months passed before Draco even thought about working again. Eventually though, at Harry’s insistence, he did, but Harry never returned to being an Auror.
Finally, there was no one left, not that he could see anyway. Draco crept forward easing his way between the floral arrangements that were laid out several metres out on each side. There had been a lot of people in attendance.
Harry Potter, the one and only, saviour of all, boy who lived, was sitting opposite him; his hair ruffled; eyes red and downcast; clothes looking as though his cupboard had thrown them at him; carrying books that looked like they weighed more than he did. He looked much the same as he always did, terrible, as though he had just walked off the battlefield. In truth, Draco wasn’t really sure any of them had ever left.
“Oh! Umm, thank you, Dudley. You know you didn’t have to. This morning was an accident. We aren’t about to kick you out for burning toast-”
“So, boyfriends then?” Harry smiled, and Draco swore he felt his throat close. Instead of answering he pressed his lips to the green-eyed boy once more. “Is that a ye-” Harry was cut off as Draco enveloped his lips once more, pressing his tongue on Harry’s lower lip, deepening the kiss. Damn he loved this man.
“Shhhh,” a voice hushed, from somewhere to his… left? Harry didn’t know. Directions were confusing. He blinked wearily, finally looking up at the nurse. He was at St Mungos? “Good morning sir. I’m just here to do a quick check-up,” she whispered, and then glanced down to his right, and smiled gently. “Best not to disturb him. He hasn’t been sleeping.”
But… for courtesies sake, of course, he ended carefully pulling apart the satin bow to find a deep midnight blue suit. For merlin’s sake why did the man have such good taste? He wanted to hate it. He really did.
Legends spoke of how the grey eyes were like an illusion. They merely masked the colours of everyone’s eyes. Everybody could see their own eye colour, and that of their soulmate.
“No, you don’t. And last, I checked, you came on your own. So, you’re welcome to leave,” the boy retorted.
Well, if his heart hadn’t stopped before it certainly had now. This was such a stupid idea. It was a terrible, completely idiotic idea, wrought with flaws.
The Chosen One couldn’t be dead. Granted he had almost died every year from the teachers and Voldemort and so on, but that was his thing, almost dying. He couldn’t die.
“Sorry sorry,” Harry said, hurrying to redirect the light as Draco hit his head, again. Harry winced. “Sorry…” Draco glared into the new light. “I’m helping…”
He had been at the school six years, and every year the castle was enchanted to swap the dress ties of the ‘One True Partner’ or their ‘Soulmate’ of each person. He used the terms loosely though because there was no actual evidence that the person who received your tie was anything to you, let alone a destined partner.
He sat there alone, or he may have well as been, for all the talking he had gotten out of Draco lately, lost in his thoughts. He sighed.
No, he definitely hadn’t thought too much about it. But it didn’t matter anyway. No matter how much he overanalysed, or changed his behaviour to suit others, nothing seemed to work. No one stayed. No one cared.
They were sitting in the garden for breakfast for a change. A gentled breeze blew around them, a choir of birds singing softly in the treetops. The roses were blooming, though he could have sworn the whole year round. He thought he recalled though, from one of their morning talks that the colours changed depending on the season.
Out of the blue, two bodies appeared around him, and he moved to try and attack them or slip away or something, before realising… it was Granger and Weasley.
“…I was going to,” Harry replied quietly, his eyes lowering as he spoke. “I really was, but it was never the right time. You were having a hard time at work…” he smiled weakly, mostly at his poor reasoning but also because of the memories of the two of them. The days they would spend together. Happy or sad, Draco was his.
A small pessimistic part of him whispered about how ‘safe’ it had been during his childhood, but he pushed the thought away.
“May I?” the mop-head asked, gesturing towards the tie around his neck. Not confident that he was breathing anymore, Draco just nodded.
Dudley, still grinning clenched the tray of cookies harder and followed after Mitsy as she lead him into the dinner room. As the two left Harry snaked an arm around the blonde’s waist, his chin over his shoulder.
“Wait… you stalked me?” Draco asked Incredulously - quite probably focusing on the wrong point - and burst out laughing. Harry’s face turned beet red.
That’s how Draco knew he was in trouble. He had grey eyes. They were different shade, but they were still grey. There was no striking colour to lure his soulmate to him, like his mother supposedly had. It was just grey, the same grey, unless inspected closer.
He pulled it from the shelf and started to flip through it as he walked back to his place beside the blonde’s bed, settling himself to read aloud.
“Well, I just- Not to be rude or anything - but he is always here so I thought he must have lived here, and you’re awfully close for roommates, and… You know- you can tell, I won’t tell a soul, I swear! But… is he like… a secret lover or something…?”
“What’s Mr. Malfoy, Draco, here for?” Harry waited, tilting his head, to see if there was any elaboration, but none came.
“I, uh yeah. Okay. That’s… sure, Harry,” the boy relented, though he seemed a little opposed to the idea. Harry just watched him a moment longer before going to find his almost certainly pouting husband to take him shopping.
Before long he reached the front double doors of the manor. Tall glass windows lined either side showing what he assumed were drawing rooms or libraries or something.
“I’m afraid there was… an accident. We would like you to come in-” Before the words had left the other man’s mouth, he had hung up, grabbed his coat and was in the Floo headed for St Mungos.
Each of his classmates woke up differently. Some woke soundlessly, silent tears running down their cheeks. Some woke sobbing into their pillows. The worst were the screamers, and not because of the noise, the noise was just a given now. But the screams… The screams gave way to a kind of pain no physical injury could ever hope to incur or understand. Draco was convinced the pure agony in their voices would give him more nightmares. He had never heard anything like it, and he really hoped he never would again. Only one problem. He was one of those people.
“Okay. Truth this time? I know this is going to be… confusing. Hating someone and then not and still being family, and then watching them leave even if not forever, and… you have a lot of stuff to think over. I get it, better than anyone.” Harry sighed.
He ordered a water for himself and sat down to wait, glancing at his watch from time to time. Most wizards didn’t use them and favoured a tempus charm instead, but he liked his watch all the same. It was functional, even without magic. When he was young he’d taught himself how to tell time, and been fascinated with clocks ever since. It had been hard tracking down a watch that could cope within the magical worlds, and he really loved it now.
It had been two years now since Draco had received his first flower. He was kind of sad he had let the first two wither and die, but he found them later and pressed them into bookmarks and kept them with him.
“No worries, Draco. We will inform everyone that you are off limits,” the green-eyed boy replied, seemingly without a second thought. Did the boy ever take a second thought? How was he still alive?
Granger and Weasley were both sporting Gryffindor ties, and if you asked Draco, they were each others’ and frankly that made it rather boring. The Weaslette was wearing a blue tie.
“Dudley, what are you doing scaring us so early in the morning? Trust me, you don’t want to know what it’s like the kind of spells we have to use.”
The ties were also supposedly tied based off how the tie owner tied it (How many times can you say tie in a sentence and still make sense?). Sometimes this caused major panic when a Ravenclaw’s or Slytherin’s - as an example - was not absolutely perfect and pristine. Draco’s was one such example. Six years. Six years and his ‘Soulmate’ still didn’t know how to tie his own tie. In the first years, he had just wanted to strangle them with it, but after a few years he liked having it consistent, that and the fact that watching cheerily - though he would never show it - while everyone around him suffered and acted miserable at the hands of poorly tied ties, was just so much fun. It was kind of hobby of his. The most miserable person changed yearly, though there were one or two Slytherin’s that were always enjoyably infuriated, and it just made Draco’s day.
Turning around to face Harry, Draco melted, and before he knew it his hands were wrapped around the back of the other boy’s head, pressing their lips together.
“Get out of here boy,” a voice ordered from… above him, beside him? Honestly, he had no clue. The entire place was more than he could take.
“Narcissa,” he amended, “why- why does Tibby call me young master? Why did she when I first got here? Why did the estate just let me in…?”
It had been ten years, and still Draco came back twice a year. Once about a week before the anniversary and once more on the date. He tended to stand back on the anniversary though. Occasionally, other people showed up, and he didn’t need the questions, or the hate.
“I’ve had them every morning for months! I need sustenance without treacle! I am seriously considering getting down on my knees to beg one of the elves at this point.”
Dudley’s stunned exclamation from the exterior turned into stunned silence as they toured the house and pointed out the various rooms that he might need. They had made a lot of repairs since the war. From the exterior alone it was unrecognizable, but the inside… it was clad in neat but homely furnishings of silver and gold scattered throughout the various rooms and levels of the house. Dudley would have sworn it was bigger on the inside than the out but it was either his imagination or simply another form of the magic that seemed so prolific around them.
Summoning another glass of water the blonde placed it gently back inside and went back to eating his lunch. He had a potions convention to attend the next week and had to make sure none of the hospital work was left unfinished.
The sky had turned dark, and there was a cold breeze blowing through the Astronomy Tower. It was a comforting darkness though. It was a darkness filled with stars and the occasional cloud, not a darkness of a dungeon or a Dark Lord. It was a soft darkness. Gentle even.
Having said that, Harry’s hair was now bright green. He wasn’t particularly concerned by this, especially given that Draco had just accidentally eaten a special herb amongst his food that would make his voice high-pitched for the rest of the day, as though he’d been breathing helium.
A sound interrupted Draco’s depressing train of thought though, and there he was. He was as messy-haired and as defiantly green-eyed as the day he first met him. Without a second thought - not thinking, brilliant, he was becoming more like the mop-head every day - he called out to Harry and tossed him his wand. He probably should have done some thinking, because now he was wandless, in the middle of a war, surrounded by people that wanted to kill him.
“Hmmm, you heard correctly,” he murmured noncommittally as he went back to retrieving his lunch. He watched out of the corner of his eye as Malfoy picked up a plate and absently started doing the same.
Taking a last look in the mirror he ruffled his hair just enough to either look like he had just had the best sex of his life or had just gotten out of bed.
“With an arse like this? I’m not anyone’s secret anything,” and strutted back out, leaving Harry gripping the table, trying not to fall off his chair from laughter.
“But that was months ago,” he said, and despite the interruption, again, the doctor waited patiently for Draco’s thought process to run its course. Horror finally claimed his features, his hands moving to cover his face. “No… All the sick leave, and quitting… how did I not notice?”
“No. Never mind. I just thought-” Harry’s sentence trailed off as an arm wrapped around his waist, another behind his neck pressing a set of lips to his.
His breath hitched. If Harry noticed, he didn’t comment. Maybe the boy thought - ignorantly - it was a result of the fiendfyre rising around them, almost certainly about to kill them all.
He spun the flower round in his grip before setting it down beside the last one he had preserved in water with a few charms.
It didn’t start as much. Simple sighs or grimaces when they walked away from first dates. The disappointed looks when they said it was over. The same looks that only made his insecurities worse.
“First of all, it was a guess, and can you imagine how ridiculous it would have been if I came up with the romantic idea that my school nemesis was also my Soulmate? If I was wrong, I never would have lived it down. Secondly, tell me honestly, if we hadn’t been through all the terrible stuff we have been through, that you would still be here sitting beside me? We don’t like each other Draco. Sure, I stalked you a bit, but that only serves my point.”
Instead of making his way straight to the blondes side as he had yesterday, mirroring the blondes frozen stated, he opted the look around the room. It was large, as far as bedrooms go, but not uncommonly so for the manor. The large bed in the centre obviously took precedence in the room, but it also housed a series of reading chairs, and a floor to ceiling bookcase. There were no desks present. Harry assumed he probably had a separate study in one of the next rooms. There was on en suite though.
“Now,” the raven said, pulling away to look at his now blushing partner, “come on. We can’t make Dudley wait all day. He looked so excited.”
“Thank you, for saying that. It means a lot, but,” Harry hedged, unsure how to continue, “for the sake of honesty, I can’t tell you I’m okay. A lot of things happened in that place, more than either of us will ever be able to name, and I am not going to pretend it’s suddenly okay.
Draco was one of three returning Slytherins. The other two played a smaller part in the war, and they had younger siblings still in the school, so it made sense. He seemed to be the odd one out even among his own house.
He turned slightly, watching himself in the mirror, in the slim blue silhouette of the suit fit him like a glove.
“What’s wrong, Harry? You can tell me. Come on, please. Isn’t this whole ‘not hexing each other into oblivion’ thing a two-way street here, Potter-” Draco half chuckled, but it was forced.
Harry had heard that Malfoy had become a Veela some time ago. He didn’t read the papers anymore, but Hermione and Ron kept him informed on anything he might want to know that wasn’t purely gossip. He hadn’t given it much thought at the time, but there they were, long and white and gleaming.
For a split second, the other boy’s eyes were burning. The usual emerald alive with a fire not unlike those brought about with floo powder. It was terrifying, but Draco couldn’t bring himself to feel afraid. He didn’t believe there was a single thing that he wouldn’t let the boy standing opposite him do to him.
The soft golden petals glinting in the light morning sun on the kitchen windowsill, its arrival barely making a creak as Draco bustled around making himself a quick breakfast. The blonde was muttering something as he cooked, presumably notes or potion ingredients.
Draco watched, charmed, as the sleepy mop blinked a couple of times, mumbling something about how he’d overslept or some nonsense, and let his head flop back on to the pillow in defeat. With a light chuckle, the blonde brushed the hair out of the raven’s eyes, and gave him a light kiss.
“You’re drunk, Harry.” Tears ran down the edge of her face, a deep hurt somewhere inside her piercing through her heart.
. His head hurt so bad. He felt like someone had just scooped out his brain and sewn him back up. And… what had happened to his leg?
He really wished he believed he could believe his lie, but as he felt his eyes turn black, like a shadow overtaking his life, he knew once again a lie was all it was. Oh, how he hated his miserable life.
He look like a charred snake or something, is what Harry would have liked to say if it wasn’t for the fact that it fit Malfoy so perfectly.
Several minutes passed like that, a silence between them as they each contemplated what it meant for them in future.
Harry turned just as another curse shot towards him. He flinched, closing his eyes, but it never hit. He hesitantly opened his eyes expecting to see another attack, but… there were all he could see was feathers.
“I wanted to, but with everything that’s been happening, with you being judged for your past-” Draco flinched, “-it was just never the right time. I wanted to be there to support you, and I would never want to be a burden-”
“I think I can I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks,” the other boy replied curtly, avoiding his outstretched hand.
But more importantly than any of that, were his eyes. They were the most beautiful shade of green he had ever seen. They sparkled like emeralds but had a softness that could be attributed to more of a grass green. His eyes were so beautiful.
It didn’t take long for the blonde’s eyes to find Harry, who was currently serving himself lunch at the buffet, mourning his future loss of the buffet table, rather distractedly.
