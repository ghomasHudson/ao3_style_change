" I dunno, early? I kind of just let my body wake up whenever and then see if I have time to pamper myself. I know you're the kind to appreciate that sort of thing."
Tony's jaw hung slack from his head, eyes blown wide. " Oh, you're gonna get it!" Tony's fist collided with his palm as his buddies made fighting gestures in the back round. " You're a punk, you know that? A real pain in the arse. Honestly I can't think of one good use of you coming out from that war alive." Tony's words slipped off his tongue as if rehearsed, the venom dripped from every syllable he spat. In the end, Tony grabbed the base of Draco's tie and pulled  him up while his other arm reeled back. Fist clenched and ready for the hit.
How could he miss those? Here eyes almost seemed orange, like a bright pumpkin picked for carving, with a sky blue line dancing between tiny explosions of bright green. It was chaotically beautiful.
The yellow-tinted envelope was only the beginning of their misfortune. As ordered, they came to court the following day, dressing in their finest robes. They received glares and sneers as they navigated through the ministries halls, and Draco found it surprising how many students he recognized, but their eyes told him that they knew he would be here. Almost like they were waiting for him. It wasn't anything crazy, no one he talked to or actively associated with. Just faces passing by that he knew he'd passed before. His nerves didn't flutter until they came closer to their desired location, but it wasn't from the anticipation of the undeniable events ahead. It was from a pair of green eyes framed in a thin black wire of glasses. Draco shook his head as he searched for their own. Surely it wasn't... was it?
" Honestly? I don't remember the little details of this lesson, only the big things." Harry watched as Draco bit on his bottom lip, peeling back a layer or two of the pink flesh.
I wanted to warning all my readers that I will be taking a break from writing this series as I haven’t had any motivation for this so far. I originally had a basic idea of were I wanted this to go, as that is how I pretty much start all my works, but I feel like I’m not portraying the idea as well as I would have liked to.
Harry's had slapped violently over Draco's mouth as he breathed a nervous chuckle, turning to Professor Surly.
Draco abruptly stood and shoved Harry's chair as he walked around to the bookshelf on the opposite side.
A gentle sigh passed his lips as another chilled breeze washed over him. The cold kept coming in waves, like a frozen sea repeatedly crashing over and over on top of him.
Draco burst into the Defense of the Dark Arts room as the sweat from his brows dripped down the side of his face.
Draco's nose scrunched up, obviously displeased with the effort (or lack of) Harry was putting into the notes.
Draco took the time the Professor allowed of explaining the end of his notes from earlier to try an analyze Potter's wand.
Draco stopped running in favor of a calmed walk, still swift but significantly slower than before. He treaded into the short corridor that lead him to the court yard.
Draco frowned at his spiraling thoughts, and turned back to the board. He spent another moment picking at his hair until he felt as if he had done an adequate job.
Draco, deciding he had had enough of this, stood up while rolling his eyes and took a step towards an entrance into the surrounding corridors only to be stopped by Potter’s hand around his wrist. “ Woah there, I was only joking.”
The startled nurse turned towards the bloodied student and his owl tag-a-long before quickly walking over. She'd been talking to someone before, but Draco didn't see who it was. Guessing by the long robe they wore, he guessed a student.
One might think that with all she's been through, Hermione Granger would never be scared again. And you'd be right.
"Looks like animal markings." Draco glared at Madam Pomfrey when she turned her head. "Well, as a matter of fact, it was. I moved an owl nest and the mother-"
After Granger sat down, a couple of other students went. Most were seventh years so Draco would only glance up once in a while.
Draco has another encounter with Tiny, but it lands him in quite an interesting situation with the one and only Golden Boy.
It was a rhythmic sound that gradually got louder. Draco distinguished the noise as someone running.
True worry, true concern was plastered on the raven haired boy's face. And as if that wasn't enough, joining the disturbed expression was a look of
The choir of laugher still echoed in his mind as he turned corners. His feet hit the ground hard enough to send vibrations through his bones.
Surely it was the same wand he has always had, only the color was slightly off. The shock of how Harry Potter repaired his wand going over Draco's head completely.
It’s not long or anything, but I’m happier with how I’m starting out. This version felt really rushed and I wasn’t happy with how it was going. I hope you’ll go in this journey with me!
Harry turned to face Draco as he tugged on a pair of trousers. " In all honesty, I don't either, but from what I've seen of you, not just at school, this new Draco that wants to change and fix what he's done. I just couldn't hold a grudge on you, even after all you've done. And I know it's a lousy explanation, but it- it's hard to explain my feeling towards you and our past."
Draco raised a shaky hand to Professor Surly's room with great disdain building in the pit of his stomach. The sensation made Draco feel as if he were a hollow shell and someone was pouring an intoxicating liquid into his body, making him queasy. Draco gathered his bearings and turned the handle which allowed him to enter the room and to his deviation realized the only seat open was once again the seat next to Harry Potter.
I sincerely apologize for this disappointment, but please know I am investing in other Drarry works that are post-war. I hope you are all good with this and that it doesn’t upset you so.
"Father, I'm sorry. I didn't mean for you to get in trouble!" Draco peeped in a worried whisper. His father's cold, gray eyes soften showing the sparse hints of gentle green in his eyes. However, Draco's worried expression didn't leave his features.
" Well who am I to break a chain? Please remain after class to assist me in the tiding up of my classroom." With a smirk, Professor Surly turned towards the chalkboard as the other student began murmuring and giggling.
She strolled right up to the front of the room as professor Surely reminded the class of the charm to 'disarm' the 'hideous beast'. His smooth voice echo flawlessly as it intertwined with his crisp Scottish accent, " The Riddikulus charm is used to kept this beast at bay. It makes the creature take form of something the caster finds humorous, therefore distracting said person from the creatures frightening form. The wand motions to cast this brilliant spell is one that resembles a smile." He turned to draw a diagram on the chalkboard behind him as Hermione waited patiently by his desk, using her wand to write notes on the parchment paper that was sat on her desk next to Ron. Although the students already went over this exact lesson, Hermione refused to not take notes.
" Oh, my bad." Potter turned around and removed Draco's hand so he could looked down at Draco to inspect his nose, making sure he was alrig-
Ever since Draco had come back to Hogwarts he had noticed the the vegetation around the castle had became quite overgrown. Vines climbed the walls of the building and weeds and wild flowers blossomed in patches along the grassy fields. Once Draco sat down on the stone bench, a string of pearls vine lazily dangled over his shoulder.
After about five minutes, they both cast warming charms and a simple Lumos. However they stayed and talked. Rather about boring things until Potter stood and began to head back to the castle after asking Draco if he was okay for the third time that conversation.
His blue orbs danced on top of the many heads that occupied the large space, finally setting on a some-what familiar looking head of a small Slytherin at the other side of the table. Draco wasn't even watching the rest of the room let alone Tony, but he could already tell that a good percentage of the students were entertaining themselves by watching Tony explode at Draco.
"Oh...I don't know. But I'm glad, I hate when they are always asking for an autograph or pointers." Harry followed Draco as he began walking down the hallway again, their feet walking rhythmically. Draco raised a brow before mocking a laugh.
Inside Hogwarts was practically no different than outside, the chill followed them down the halls and so did the natural view. The only difference is the soft glow of the torches, lanterns, and other lights that lined the hallways and ceiling. Chaos from the classroom mayhem left a rather strange diner schedule. Instead of the designated time to come and feast, it was more of an elongated time slot where you would come and go. it was available a lot later than before, which in some cases proved to be quite convenient.
Draco pursed his lips and formed a bitchy face as he waited. A handful a moments went by accompanied by Potter’s sputtering and the light taping of Draco’s foot against the small stone tile under their feet. “ Please stop Potter. Idiotic isn’t a good look on you.” Potter stopped his stuttering and incoherent murmuring to offer a giddy little smile in response to Draco’s remark. “ Could say the same to you.”
The pair passed a couple of students who just stared at them or pretended what they were seeing wasn't true. Draco couldn't blame them. He could hardly believe it was happening either.
Draco opened his eyes only to have to a sunbeam hit them, making him squint in order to search for the source of the off count beats.
Draco looked back down at his quill and picked it up to continue his unfinished sketch of a Peace Lily on his page all the while frowning. "No. I'm sorry I lashed out. It was unprofessional and I apologize." Draco croaked.
Potter turned around noticing that Draco was still in the room. He gave a curt smile that was accompanied with a calculated nod and went to gather his own things. Finally Draco set off, satchel at his side, headed to his next class.
"Oh, I doubt I'll need to hold his hand." Draco scoffed, giving her better access to his wounds. She shrugged and grabbed his arm, "Well, alright. Now don't squirm too much, this may hurt."
" While I appreciate your willingness and acknowledgement towards your actions, that's not why I asked you here today."
" Hey, hey. You're alright, I'm here. Let me see." Draco tried to sound as soothing as he could, not daring to turn around and face the crowd that was forming behind him. " I- I just want-ted to touch it! B-but it b-broke..."
On his way to the bathroom he saw a few groups of students hanging around the common room which was peculiar to Draco because he purposely woke up earlier than most students so he could avoid conversing with any unwanted rascals (although he seriously doubt anyone wanted to talk to him.)
Draco was forced to take a few steps back until he completely lost his balance and fell on his bottom. A snort could be heard above him.
Draco heard shuffling and assumed people were volunteering, he was relieved. The last thing he wanted was to face the Boggart, at least not today. His head was swam with questions and thoughts, mainly about himself more than lessons, and he just didn't think he could concentrate on something of the degree. He pulled his head down to absentmindedly gaze at his parchment.
" What do you inquire me to do?" Professor Surly merely grunted in response as he cleaned the chalkboard. " Professor?"
Draco quickly stood and almost sprinted over to the elf holding the jug. Draco gently took the vase and gingerly placed it on the dark dining table. Turning around he took out a handkerchief that he dabbled into the water cups already sitting on the table and, as gracefully as he could, dropped to his knees. Draco lightly grabbed the fabric and scrubbed vigorously at the stain. There was a waterfall of protests from the elf, who Draco believes is named Lintflick, but no physical action to stop him. Draco's knees hurt and he could tell they were going to deeply bruise, but at least the stain was significantly reduced compared to how it was when he first laid eyes on it.
Draco's fingers mindless dragged across the imprints on the frame as he inspected the image for the thousandth time. It was funny, really, all the occasions in which he would brag about how perfect his family was. How poised and proper they were. How
Once finding solitude in the Transfiguration room, the boys leaned on the desks as they once more composed themselves.
He had been incredibly late to his first class and as a punishment the Professor made his stay later and help clean up, which lead him to be late to his next class and so on and so forth. It was one huge loop, Draco almost swears the professors planned it.
Just then you could hear one of the benches in the hall make an awful screeching sound, indicating it had been abruptly scooted across the floor. Both Draco and Tony's head snapped in the direction of the noise, as well as plenty of other students. Then it happened again, vibrant green met dulled blue and all went stiff. Draco drew in a breath. It almost seemed to go in slow motion. Potter sprinting towards him, their eyes never leaving each other's.
Draco's leg bounced up and down as he rubbed sweaty hands on his pant legs. He felt his lip quiver from the abuse it previously served, tooth marks were still visible on the pink and swollen flesh to the observative eye.
" I know, but-" Potter raises his hand and reached out for Draco's shoulder to find purchase only to have Draco jerk away as his gaze morphed into a cold stare.
He had also received a letter from his father, albeit a very whiny letter but he was still delightful to hear from him. Apparently the cooks there did not give a rat's ass about the food they prepared. Lucius had written about a particularly undercooked pastry that had him throwing up once. Although his father generally talked about himself, he did ask Draco a few questions. He even wrote that he expected a letter in return. Draco smiled fondly at that, he couldn't recall any other time his father wrote to him first much less asking Draco to write him back. The thick ring his father had gifted him was snuggly wrapped around the ring finger of his right hand.
Draco felt his mouth open only for his throat to clench and mouth to run dry. He felt like someone had stuffed his mouth with cotton wads and toasted his vocal cords. The back of his neck radiated with a burning sensation as his hands began to twitch, teeth nibbling on the insides on his cheeks. His eyes shook which was quite a strange sensation. A gentle tug on his hand was all it took for Draco to remember how legs worked. He followed after his mother, watching as her perfectly arranged hair bounced slightly as she walked, mirroring the way the extra layers of her dress swayed. And the rest was history.
Packing his trunk for Hogwarts was quite a weird feeling. The soft fibers of the leather brushed against his finger pads as he smoothed out the top, still, prioritization neatness in his everyday life was at least one constant they couldn't take from him. Finding out that you've been folding shirts wrong your entire life wasn't something Draco expected to learn but found himself going the extra mile to allow for more storage. The gold buckling showed it's age with a myriad of scratches covering the precious metal. His irises held the reflection of the shining metal in his eyes, making it appear like a golden sunrise above a clear, stormy sea.
" I've researched your records since the war and found them to be quite interesting. Volunteering at community cleaning organizations and St Mungo's rehabilitation program seems to be quite different from what I expected the old Draco Malfoy to choose to do."
Before the boy even opened his mouth, Draco already knew what was coming and promptly settled into his seat and gazed around the hall in pre-boredom mourning.
Draco knew why they were here. They did this every week or so, but like hell was he about to let them get their way. " Evening, gentlemen. What can I do you for?" He could feel the Golden Boy's gaze burning a hole into his head.
Draco can no longer conceal the question that was plaguing him inside, and like most of his interactions with Harry he just couldn't have enough self control to contain his curiosity.
Potter tread about a foot or so in front of Draco, leading the pair to the middle of the stadium. Once reaching the center, Potter abruptly stopped which caused an absentminded Draco to slam into his back.
"I do. After, how many years has it been? Eight? After eight years of bad blood, someone should think you two should sort things out." Luna did have a good point. Bury the hatchet and all that.
" When did you get so big, Potter? Look at you, you're all tall and buff." A sly smile replaced the puzzled expression that had been occupying Draco's features as Potter merely rose a brow in question.
" Well, you know. You're always so conscious of your appearance, disregarding yesterday's incident, and you keep yourself looking nice."
Draco furrowed his brows and glanced down the halls. His eyes seeking out a girl with frizzy hair or a boy with evergreen eyes, but neither were found. He turned back to the man in front of him, the other eyes never leaving Draco's no matter how many times Draco diverted his own. The slight sounds of magic could be heard from surrounding rooms, but none were close. The forests visible from the window seemed to blur into one lump of green at the patter of rain begin to hit on the glass.
Suddenly he realized that Potter was looking into his eyes also and feeling too exposed, Draco jerked his head back to the sunset.
Draco closed his eyes and smelled the fresh air which was saturated with multiple fragrances of many plants. In one way, it was chaos. Senses overwhelmed with hundreds of new plants and their distinct scent. In another, it was simple. All the flora surrounding the air mixed together to make a whole new aroma.
A messily dressed, puffy-eyed, Harry Potter stood there. Wand in grapes as Draco studied him in confusion. His clothes looked wrinkled and mishandled, his tie was thrown around his neck like a scarf and his robe was off one shoulder. His glasses sat askew in his face, but he must've seen clearly because immediately after Harry saw Draco he rushed over.
Potter's eyes twitched open with surprise that quickly formed into determination. As the dementor loomed nearer, Potter readjusted his stance to accommodate his needs. Once the dementor reached Potter, it was situated in front of Draco's desk. As the dementor slowly turned its head toward Draco, it began to change slightly, as if the creature was changing it's target.
"I was just informing the Professor that we would be thrilled to meet with him and Professor Colin durning lunch to discuss this topic again because someone was distracting us."
" Now if you will excuse me, I must be off to prepare for the day. I'd suggest you all start the day, I can smell some of you from here." And with that, Draco stood once again and headed out leaving the crowd with his trademark sass.
" Do you think they're..." Draco asked while Harry's eyebrows met one another. " Could be possible, I just never imagined either of them to be the type. Anyway, I had a really good time with you and I was hoping you could sit next to me again. Possibly not just in Defense?"
Luna turned to look behind her as Draco kept his gaze down, moving his food around his plate. Harry's eyes were narrowed and pointedly staring directly at Draco. There was no frown on his face, but he didn't look content either. Merely neutral.
" Um... if I say yes would you believe me?" Harry gave the Professor a shy smile as he scratched the back of his neck.
" Ah, Harry! I see you've come to comprehend this villain with me. Wonderful!" Tony yelled as he began walking down the hall. Draco's widened eyes fixed on the wand that sat in Potter's hand.
In a flash of light and dark, Draco appeared in the prefects bathroom with a disoriented Potter standing next to him.
A dazzling smile wormed onto Harry's lips as he firmly grasped Draco's hand and shook it once. Twice.
Merlin! Who is that? Their hair looks so familiar. It's a kinda of sandy blond-no, no. More like a honey brown-
" Malfoy!" Potter's voice rang down the hall echoing in Draco's ears accompanied by Potter's heavy footsteps chasing after his own. Draco's breath picked up as he rounded another corner and promptly reached a dead end.
" Boys, were you paying attention?" Draco and Harry looked forward to see Professor Surly standing in front of their desks.
Potter wasn't extremely tall or anything, but to Draco? A guy who spent pretty much his entire life looking at the tops of people's heads? Yeah, he'd say Potter was quite tall. The thought of 'when' and 'how' were plaguing Draco's mind so bad that he wasn't exactly shocked when the questions actually slipped out.
The long grass of the Quidditch field gently brushed along Draco's pant leg as he walked towards the center, his eyes never leaving Potter's shoes which were old and blatantly showed their use.
" Malfoy!" Potter's voice squirmed into Draco's ears as he approached. " Alright Potter, make it quick." Draco tried to keep a cool composure, but couldn't stop the fear that slipped through the cracks in his façade.
Draco rushed over to the small girl and squatted down so he was facing her. " Are you alright?" Draco brushed a strand of the girls wavy, red hair out of her face. " I...I-I. I'm sorry!" She screamed as she grasped Draco, the blood that drizzled from her hands dripped onto Draco's hair. He lifted her up and brought her to the couch as her fiery hair tickled his cheekbones.
" Why don’t you go tell your father? Oh wait." Tony began to chuckle, it formed deep in his gut and erupted into his throat. That monstrous laugh echoed across the empty hall until it was joined by it's friends, the laughs of mockery were vibrating through Draco's ears and rattled around his head. Tony's vice like grip on Draco's shirt released as he shook with laughter, in result Draco stumbled backwards until he was promptly fell on his bottom, which only provided more fuel for the antagonizing laugher that surrounded him.
Luna turned into the Great Hall, her heels clicking as she searched for a secluded spot. Draco wasn't sure if it was for her sake or his own, but he was thankful either way. As they sat at the edge of the Slytherin table, dishing out their plates and lazily poking their food, a few more figures entered the space. Draco only looked up due to the flash of raven hair that caught his eye.
"Draco, what are you doing up? It's late, you should be asleep." His father's manicured hands lifted Draco onto the couch and on top of his stomach.
Don’t fear though, my original idea for this book hasn’t changed. I’ve tweaked some little elements but other than that it should be pretty similar!
Defense was no exception. Actually, Defense was one of Draco's bigger classes. It held almost all the eighths years and a good amount of seventh years. Draco was lucky enough to get Weasley, Granger, and Potter in that class.
The thought lingered in Draco's mind as he recalled his childhood dream of having a pet. The loyal long-haired lurcher's Lucius owned never quite counted, did they? Draco could recall a time which Ryder bit his cheek. The scraggly looking dog growled and growled while a young Draco shifted closer and closer. In retrospect, Draco probably should have taken the dog's growling and barking as a sign to shove off, but he was only a child. How was he supposed to know? His memory was hazy and had major gaps, but Draco distinctly remembers the dog backing away and baring its pearly whites. Ryder was steadily warning young Draco as he approached until the beast decided he had been patient long enough and jumped at Draco's cheek. The stained teeth of the dog broke a few layers of skin on the 4-year-olds cheek before his mother came in and hit the dog on his bum.
Madam Pomfrey helped Draco to a bed where he sat down, the mother owl wrapped her talons around the metal railing by the far side.
"Oh, well I'm sorry if writing two sets of notes makes me a bit rushed."  Harry snapped from next to Draco who looked over at Harry so quickly, one could think he snapped his neck.
Draco turns around to see if Professor Colin was still down the same corridor as Harry and him. And sure enough, he saw the tall Professor leaning against the wall at the opposite end of the hallway. Draco leaned to his left in order to get a better look at what exactly was happened (which made him lean into Harry's arm, but neither boy seemed to notice or care) Harry turned back to find whatever was stealing Draco's attention from him only to discover his companion was staring at the teacher.
I am considering restarting this book so I can fix my mistakes and the things I’m not proud of in it, but it is not set in stone!
" Morgan, you promised me you'd listen." A slight glaze was now visible in Professor Surly's eyes. At the sign of a potential break down, Professor Colin turned his back on Draco and Harry and bent down to put his hands on either side of Professor Surly's head.
"Merlin, Draco! Are you daft? Moving an owl's nest? Even an oaf would know not to do that." Harry came and stood next to Madam Pomfrey before she scurried off again. "What? You think I don't know that?"
So when all he received from Professor Surly was a quick glance and an expecting expression, Draco was slightly off put. " Apologies, Professor." Draco gave a fabricated smile, " It's been a busy morning." Professor Surly merely savored his vexed expression that caressed his features so perfectly and his stone cold eyes that held Draco frozen in his place.
"SHIT!" Draco covered his face with his forearm. Her talons dug like daggers into his flesh, ripping it off like it hadn't even been attached in the first place. Draco dug into his pocket, searching for his wand, and charmed himself a shield. He considered himself decent at the charm in comparison to many others, but he knew he could do better. However, he didn't think he'd practice with an owl. The said creature was coming back in for another hit only to bounce back, the shield wobbled and a ripple of white flowed around the abused area before turning invisible once again. Draco sucked air through his teeth as the sting of his fresh wound finally hit.
The dim light from lanterns around them created an hazy atmosphere, almost dream like, completely ironic to the situation. The amber glow tinted the girls face as Draco grasped her outstretched hand, tracing his thumb of the irritated area around the fresh cut which was still releasing small bursts of blood.
When Draco finally arrived in the room, he immediately spotted the culprit. A first year girl was staring above an expansive looking vase that was in pieces on the floor.
" So, why are you being so nice to me? After all I've done, I would've never expected you to forgive me. Just like that."
So, he looked into Potter's eyes. He looked into his eyes to see his own reflection staring back at him.
The point is he wasn't Snape. Don't get him wrong Draco didn't hate the guy, he just didn't adore him. His face was thin like the rest of his body and he appeared to be in his mid or late twenties. The staff was a lot younger now, but the youngest Professors were Colin and Surly, and they did seem to spend a lot of time together. Come to think of it... Draco does catch Professor Colin and Professor Surly together quite often. Like...
" Is there something I can assist you with?" Draco's left brow rose expectingly, as if it was asking the question all itself. Harry seemed to be caught off guard for he turned a shade lighter, a hazy rose palette coated his cheeks as well as the bridge of his nose. But soon his natural tone came back, the innocent blush gone as soon as it came.
He sat down on the new furniture (different than how Dumbledore kept it, but similar enough to show commemoration) feeling on the verge of a panic attack when her scratchy voice began speaking.
It had been about a week since they all arrived at Hogwarts, the limited attendance wasn't surprising but it had been significantly less than anyone imagined. The pathetically deranged remains of the once magnificent castle were almost embarrassing. A soul-chilling breeze often blew outside and with most walls torn down, it was easy for the chill to make its way into the classrooms and halls. The unfriendly weather must have sparked the interest of the creatures residing in the Black Lake for every day you could hear the cascading choir of the sirens songs and the moans of the giant squid. Granted most where a gurgled mess of noise, but it is known that sound travels fastest underwater. Draco often watched the flocks of birds migrate and pondered what their songs meant. If they were in cages, would they still sing or would they lay down their joyous tunes and turn into the silent ball of feathers Draco passed in rooms and halls. Watching and mocking others with their sparse chirps, flapping for attention but nothing more?
Lavender. The most popular of bath scents, and for good reason. Draco already felt his tensed up muscles relax. He heard the crackle and popping of a few bubbles in front of him and the swishing sound of water (he also felt some drops hit his shoes, but opted to ignore it in favor of discovering who the mystery bather was.) Draco flutter his eyes open to finally reveal the nut job that had woken up early enough to enjoy a soak in the bath only to come face to face with...
The plant life seemed to stun almost any guess the large space hosted and Potter was no exception. His eyes twinkled with something akin to curiosity as he let his surroundings take hold. Draco felt almost as at peace from watching Potter as he did the greenery around him.
The two smiled at each other before Harry pulled Draco down the stairs and took off towards the castle.
I don't even have to do this for you." Harry dragged as he carelessly scribbled down a copy of his notes.
Lucius gently wrapped Draco in his starry blanket as he sat up. They traveled out to the porch with Draco sitting on his father's hipbone. Lucius led them down the stairs of their manor and planted his feet while gazing up at the dark sky. Draco scoped the tall hedges of their front lawn before joining his father's upward look. They stayed outside for another 30 minutes, tracing the sky with their index fingers and sharing imaginative thoughts. Draco remembers his father saying that the Sagittarius was his favorite constellation, after the Draco, of course.
"Well let them differ. it's not like most of them were there anyhow. The stories people tell, they aren't true. Well, most of them anyway. I can't help but overhear them wherever I go and I think to myself 'No they just have that all wrong, don't they?' But I'm told not to speak up about it, so I don't." Her whispy inflections made the normally upsetting information wash over Draco in a form that made him feel calm, despite just being told Luna hears people spread fake news. Fake news involving him and the war.
While the professor droned on, Draco took the time to study his features. He was a handsome bloke, more attractive than Lockhart Draco reckoned. He had a full head a nicely arranged hair that was a wondrous shade of honey brown, and his jaw was strong but soft. He also wore his robes in a dignified manner that made it look more appealing on him than any of the other professors. "- Now then, let us begin our demonstration. Keep in mind that each one of you will have to go against the boggart this week and I am prepared to postpone future lessons to make room for this one. Now, our lovely Miss Granger will be the first student this year to preform this spell for the Defense class, and seeing as she is a wondrous student please don't reframe from taking notes. In fact, I encourage it." He swiftly walked over to a cabinet, which stood at a menacing height. It had dark planked wood that mixed with dashes of blood red. It had sharp features that stuck out at absurd angles, making it look dangerous to just get close to it, and to top it off it was lined with black metal that caressed it's actuated design.
Draco shook the thoughts out of his head and carried himself with dignity over to the seat. Just as Draco sat down, a loud bang sounded from within the aged dresser that shook some tables near said object. The classmates silenced their conversations in shock and waited for the Professor in silence. Said man walked in with Professor Colin next to him. " Well class, as you all know this is Professor Colin. I asked him to sit in for the beginning few minutes of this lesson. Alright, let's carry on! Some of you stopped by my room yesterday asking if I could re-discuss what happened durning class yesterday, and I am more than happy to oblige! You see the fundamental values of a Boggart is-"
Draco felt his face flush as he blinked rapidly, his eyelashes tickled the pale skin that surrounded his eyes.
Professor Snape hid his surprisingly thin form underneath deceiving layers upon layers of black robes while Professor Colin wore a slim fitting all black suit which seemed to exaggerated his incredible lengthy and thin stature.
The library was chilling that evening and brought in a gust of air from time to time. It would blow away the piles of paper Draco had laid out. "Could you at least
"I'm quite fine. He was quite friendly at first, but he suddenly got hungry and I was the closest thing to him. Supposed it's all my fault."
All eyes were then directed to Draco's as they waited for a response. Draco squirmed uncomfortably on the couch beneath him as he grasped for straws.
Oh no no no, this meant more classes which meant more people. More judging eyes, and more sneers (now on the receiving end, Draco discovered that it really wasn't pleasant in the tiniest bit) and more Harry bloody Potter.
Just then, a group of 6 years walked up to him, slightly knocking the table so Draco's mug slipped and spilled over his space. Most of them were Gryffindor, while a few were from Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw. Draco looked over as he yanked on the roll, the pieces he'd already taken off were laying on the table before him, now swimming in pumpkin juice.
" Do you know why?" Harry asked as he got up and stood in front of Draco, who was still sitting on a desk calmly swinging his legs.
“ So, ahem, do you- are you busy right now?” Potter shoved his hands into his front pockets and poked at the ground with his foot.
Draco jolted awake, a burning sensation on his right, the owl on his stomach startled as well. A questioning hoot left her beak as Draco groaned, his eyes looking over to his right. A thin puddle of blood laid around his right arm. Suddenly out of his blurry haze, Draco got out of bed and stumbled to the door, the Eagle owl was flapping her wings in place as she booted repeatedly. Draco swung the door open and clumsily jogged his way out of the Slytherin dormitories in search of Madam Pomfrey. The mother owl must've been worried because Draco could hear her flapping wings behind him as he ran.
Draco shook his head, as if trying to physically shake the thought out of his head. Then, he gazed out upon the other tables, finally settling on the Gryffindor's table. His eyes searched for the Golden Boy, and sure enough. There he was. Raven hair pointing out in every which way as always.
"Reckon we ought to head back now? The sun is quite nearly gone." Luna asked, although she already began standing and strolling over to the castle. Draco quickly trailed behind, sooner or later matching her speed and walking in time next to her. Albeit the cold preserved most of her hair to wet strands, a surprising amount had dried by the cool wind that fluttered passed.
" Actually, I was with Harry. Crazy to believe, I still can't really process it myself, but it's true."
problem, doesn't it." Draco spat through wincing as Pomfrey poured some goopy liquid on his arm. It slithered down at a snail's pace leaving behind a very pigmented trail.
"Suppose I forgive you." A delighted noise emitted from the bird as it walked over to Draco's stomach, climbing on top and hunkering down. The ghost of a chuckled was all Draco gave as he began to pet her head with his pinkie.
The slowly setting sun tried to conceal it's gorgeous appearance by hiding behind the clouds, but this only caused the clouds to glow with hues befitting a Queen. The clouds displayed beautiful pigments of pink, orange and yellow as it faded into the already darkening sky of blue. The favorable colors shone like spotlights from the cracks of clouds which settled onto every object around. Including Potter. Potter was only standing there, he was only looking at Draco. He wasn't doing anything in particular. But boy, oh boy did that sunset make him appear breathtaking.
He sat at the very end of the table with his mother on his left, her eyes every fixed upon the roaring fire with a decorative fork situated limply between her fingers. Her elegant long dress was a deep shade of green that could've easily been mistaken for black, the pin-like-pendant that gathered the layering cloth was a shiny silver that displayed the Malfoy crest. The image once filled a foolhardy Draco with such pride, but now all it brought him was a stinging reminder that life will never be the way it once was. He will never run under tables hiding from his parents, he will never tug on the bottom of his mothers dress and beg for her to play games in the back yard, he will never have music lessons with Lucius as his mother sat on the piano bench watching, he will never sneak out and trace constellations in the night sky as his father told him ridiculous stories of outlandish things. He will never have any of that back.
"Please continue, Professor." Draco nibbled on the inside of Harry's hand and Harry emitted a squeak in response, promptly flicking his hand away to glare at Draco who smirked back.
Draco flushed as he scanned the room for an open seat. His eyes tracked down the only open desk left, it was up front by a dark haired boy.
Draco was cradled in his mother's arms that night as Lucius tied Ryder to a pillar on the back porch. His companion, Preston, stayed next to him all night despite the lack of tether. After his cheek was tended to, his mother thoroughly babied him. Lucius entered the room and scolded Draco for provoking the dogs, accusing him of the whole incident. And after a loud and vicious back and forth with Lucius, Draco very clearly remembers Narcissa announcing that her husband was to sleep on the couch that night.
Draco prayed he was wrong, he prayed it was just some kid who he has never seen before that enrolled sometimes recently.
The two walked on for a while until their legs felt like weights, pulling them to a tired state. Sugary-sweet 'good-bye's' were exchanged as the two parted ways, heading to their rooms.
Draco rolled his eyes as he watched Madam Pomfrey come back, her heels clicking on the cold stone. A thought drifting into Draco's head, "Wait, what the hell do you me you knew something like this would happen?"
Draco slam his hands down on the sink in front of him and glared stony cold at Harry. His bottom lip began to drip blood from his gnawing earlier. " You know what? I don't know what you think you're doing here-" Draco gestured around them, as if that was suppose to explain his unreasonable outrage. "-but you're not fooling me. Okay? So you can stop going around and pretending to like me, because everyone in this God-damn school knows that's you don't." And with that Draco grabbed his bag and headed towards the door, the whole time he heard Har- no. Potter calling after him and Draco cursed himself as he felt and unwelcome tear slid down his cheek.
Draco's eyes glazed over his mothers face, her features ever sharp and pointed. Narcissa was now under house arrest in the manor. It was a treacherous day when Draco had to leave for Hogwarts knowing full well he'd be leaving his mother in that God forsaken house. The halls that once rang with the squeals of a young boy and his parents now permanently replaced with chilling silence that frozen his body at the mere memory.
The mother flapped her wings a few times and hooted twice as if she was trying to communicate with Draco.
Before the boggart could change completely, Potter swooped in to save the day. A quick 'Riddikulus' and the dementor was now wearing a birthday hat and sash. Ballons and confetti appeared around it as festive music began somewhere and a cake smashed into it's face.
what you'd do if you woke up and your wing was ripped up!" Draco yelled back, he stumbled over his words in his haste. The pair passed a couple of students in the halls as they dodged walls, rounded corners, and climbed stairs.
Draco mindless began rubbing the leaf of an elephants ear plant between his finger and his thumb as Potter finally sat down next to him.
Draco rose one eyebrow as an unintentional grin spread across his face. “ Did you just speak to me like a horse?” The hand that was wrapped around Draco’s wrist retreated to scratch at the back of Potter’s neck (something Draco thought to be a nervous habit). “ Possibly.” Potter grinned as he slowly stood next to Draco.
She waved her wand and cast a wordless spell. Immediately a sharp pain came to Draco's arm as he watched his skin tissues slowly mend itself.
" Draco, mate, where've you been? Some six year told me you was off with Harry Potter." Draco talked to his roommates every now and again but they weren't very buddy buddy. Sure, some nights they would all stay up and play snaps or some other game they would have lying around, but they weren't super close. Although Draco would be lying if he said he didn't enjoy the time they spent together. In fact, quite the opposite.
Draco stood up and shook his head rapidly, as if the motion would cause any bad thoughts to fly out of his head. He mechanically tied his tie in the way his father taught him. He quickly glanced down at his tie to insure its perfection before he hauled on his robe and grabbed his satchel to make his way to the bathroom to clean up before he started the day.
" Alright, let us begin the second day." Professor Surly strode over to large cabinet and set about opening it. The tall doors creacked slightly as they opened, releasing a dark fog that spilled out and spread across the floor. Only a moment later, did the creature emerge in it's new form.
Upon bringing that class to a halt and the Professor's displeased look, Draco felt that he was expected to explain further.
?" Spat the 'main' boy, his friends chuckled behind him." I think you ought to leave me be, it is dinner time after all. Which isn't a time I would take for granted if I were you, might wanna consider getting a little meat on your bones. You tooth pick." Draco planted a slip of the roll on his tongue as his eyes danced up towards Tony's. At least Draco thinks that's this kid's name.
When Draco woke up the next morning with a pounding headache, he wasn't surprised. No doubt a result from resisting sleep in favor of trying to reason with the chaotic memories of yesterday. Nothing made sense. Why would Potter save him?
" Well pardon me, you must know all about my life." Potter tried to conceal his angry but he couldn't help the irritation that leaked from his words.
What was that? Draco knew Potter's wand was made from holly wood, but he could see that that wasn't the only color occupying the long shaft. It had a pinkish tint, almost like rosewood. How peculiar.
It was nice to have kids who went through similar things that he did just enjoying each other's company and joke around and laugh. Even if Draco swore he never seen any of them before this year despite them all saying they were here the whole time Draco was.
As Longbottom took his seat next to the Weaslet, professor Surly began cursing the boggart back into the cabinet while talking. " So, as you can see. Not only does this 'experiment' help with defense, but it also helps with self confidence which is a major tool in defense itself. The more confident one is in their decision, the more affective the spell will be. Before I dismiss you all, I want you lot to remember that each and every one of you will be required to face to boggart some time this week. It does count as a grade, but whether or not you are able to disarm the boggart is not how I'm grading. Now for tonight's work I want you to either write about the first boggart encounter or the discovery of the Riddikulus charm in three paragraphs. That will be due at the end of the week. Dismissed! Enjoy the rest of your day!"
Once Draco made it to his room, he realized he hadn't stopped smiling since he had departed from Harry. He glanced at his roommates muggle alarm clock to see it was 10:28 p.m. Only one one of his roommates was in bed so Draco figured the rest were of using the showers or lounging somewhere.
Draco shook his head lightly and scanned the rest of the hall. He saw Parkinson and Blaise chatting with a couple first years at the other end of the table. Oh how Draco missed them. He missed the snarky back handed comments Parkinson would offer and the way Blaise was always there to antagonize her.
" Wish we could get closer, the sunset is stunning." Draco's words must have kicked started the Gryffindor within Potter because he glanced over to see a twinkle in his eyes as he stood up and offered a hand to Draco. " Well lets get a move in before we lose it."
The disapproving stares of the crowd shut Draco up as he decided he'd tell the truth. Surely no harm can come from that, can it?
" Thanks for helping my sister." Carie gave a weak smile and then picked up Maria and carried her out of the common room. On their way to Madame Pomfrey, Draco presumed.
After the majority of Hogwarts was repaired, students once again flooded through the ancient door. Staff of the mighty school unanimously decided that Defense of the Dark Arts was a mandatory class for every year. Most of the students were okay with this, but Draco Malfoy was not.
to complete this assignment. Including you, Mr. Potter. If you would like to consult me privately with complaints, I would suggest doing it after teaching hours so I can give you my full attention. Have a nice day." And with that, the man grabbed his wand and headed to the Great Hall off to steal a few treats from the kitchen no doubt. He has a little pastry almost every class Draco sees him.
Draco quickly tugged in his uniform pants and socks on as he began unfolding his shirt. After everything was in place, Draco realized his tie was still in the trunk. He swiftly opened the top as he bent down to search for his house tie. The object in question was easily spotted as it was wrapped lazily over...
" Ah-" Draco whined as he curled his fingers around his nose until he was promptly interrupted by Potter.
Draco contemplates all the transpired events that have took place since the battle and experiences his first golden trio encounter.
With one swift motion, Draco turned off his alarm and hopped out of bed; ready to start the day. He headed towards his trunk at the end of his bed which had a neat pile of clothes waiting for him on top. Draco hurriedly undressed himself, yanking down his silk sleeping pants and peeling off his long sleeved top. The smooth fabric glided against his skin provided a comfortable feeling that raced through his veins (not too different from the feeling Harry's touch brought him last night.)
His mother was in the kitchen assisting the elves as they prepared dinner. This was quickly becoming a common occurrence in the manor despite it only happening when things got tense between Draco and Narcissa, but that, too, was quickly becoming a common occurrence in the manor. Not only did the previous argument they had aided in Narcissa's evasion of her son, but the lack of entertainment caused by the absence of magic made her interest in muggle cooking spike, even if elves had their magic and didn't necessarily need her assistance. It wasn't as if there were restrictions on their magic, however, both parties found the idea far too terrifying to try for reasons of laissez-faire or entertainment. Draco felt his uneven, bitten nails as he ran them on the soft flesh of his finger pads. A thin scratch was located down the palm of his right hand, the narrow scrape reminded Draco strongly of a cat scratch.
Draco stood up and backed away a little so the sisters, he assumed they were, could have room. After a little time passed, Carie stood and turned so she could stare at Draco.
The one asking was Matthew, Matthew Greenland. A friendly bloke and not a bad looked either. He had some kind of "surfer dude" hair cut that went well with his brown eyes. Not the best looking, but better than many Hogwarts has seen.
When Draco is swapped with random mood swings and a mystery within the cupboard, what else is he to do other than stay quiet?
His dull eyes traced over the tattered edge of the elongated cocobolo table. The black marble that stenciled the middle rim was equally as glossed as the dark wood that surrounded it. The wide hearth of the fireplace was sending wave after wave of warmth into the air that circled Draco, exacerbating his already overheated and perspiring body.
" Morning, Draco!" Harry said in the most chipper voice Draco has ever heard from him. Draco stumbles backwards as he watched Harry begin to climb out. Finally processing what was to come, Draco averted his gaze by turning around and heading back to the mirror he was at previously. Draco cleared his throat as he drew his wand in order to summon a comb for his distressed hair, " Morning indeed, Harry."
It was peaceful as the two boy regained their breath only to waist it all the next moment by breaking into hysterical laughter. Draco grabbed Potter's shoulders and rested his head on his chest as he giggled and Potter's hand rested atop Draco's head.
Weasley had one hand on the table and looked as if he was suppressing himself from getting up. Anger written all over his features.
" Nothing, Mr. Malfoy, please head on to your next subject. I hope to see you at lunch, hopefully without another incident, hmm?" Draco flushed at the knowledge that Professor Surly knew about his issue with Tony from yesterday.
He is sure that half of their decision to send him back to school was anticipation to see him crash and burn in a heap of shit. No ounce of doubt in his mind.
The sound a shattering glass from the common room broke Draco from his trance. He hurriedly got dressed and made his way down the steps to see the commotion.
That must be it. He pitied him. Potter saw him as just another weak, scared boy who need a savior. Well think again Golden Boy because this kid doesn't need your
Just as Draco shifted his hand to pinch himself did Ronald sit down, directly across from him no less. Which was odd. Sure this whole situation was puzzling, but sitting in front of him? Draco wasn't even near the window. He was sitting directly next to the door, finding more calm in the red felt carpet that lined the hall. Draco stole a glance to find blue eyes already watching him, tracking his face like a hunter watching his prey.
Draco stood his ground for a total of 3 minuets more until he was forced to pivot in his seat to meet Potter's eyes once more.
Professor Colin (or " New Snape") wasn't even that similar to Professor Snape (no one was, at least not to Draco). Perhaps he was a little strict...
OMG! I’m super happy about this one!! I actually for real have an editor and they could not be more helpful! This is the first chapter they helped me on and I’m feeling great about it!
Professor Surly mearly gave a tired small and a curt wave as Professor Colin began steaming their way, shouting from down the hall.
" I do care about you." Potter's tone insinuated that it was the most obvious thing in the world. Duh, Draco. " How can you possibly say that?"
More and more people began flooding into the room, some were helping to pick up the broke vase and others were just simply watching. Finally a taller girl, about the same height as Draco, came barreling towards them, her own fiery hair billowing behind her. " Maria! What did you do?" Once the taller girl came to a stop, Draco took her all in. She was very,
Draco gingerly grasped the nest before bringing it into the warmth of his room. Well, the warmer warmth of his room. He placed the nest into a free cubby that was part of his desk, trying to replicate a tree's hollow nook. The two owlets awoke and expectedly started crying. They were waiting for food, after all. The change of scenery must've not only been a disappointment but quite a shock. Draco huffed as he trudged back over to his bed and face-planted into the soft sheets. It was Saturday, after all, and being awoken by snow and crying baby birds wasn't on his list of things to do.
As said man approached, Draco instinctually shifted over making room for Potter on the chilled stone bench. Naturally, Potter is too thick to realize an invitation when he sees one and just stood in front of Draco.
If you could comment your favorite little segment so far that you would like to be the summary for the book, that would be great!
The two boys sat there an hour more after the sun had set and they were left in the dark, cool of night. Well, sort of.
Harry stilled, the only noise came from Madam Pomfrey worried muttering and potion bottles clanking. The air felt stale as Draco searched green eyes for...anything. "I keep having...dreams. About you."
Upon further inspection, Draco was able to confirm that the man across from him was, indeed, Harry Potter.
Draco gingerly placed his hand into Potter's only to be yanked up and dragged about as Potter began running towards Hagrid's hut.
The returning seventh years, or rather eighth years, had been given spacious living quarters. With attendance mainly lacking in the eighth year, they were gifted large spaces and private rooms, or at least the Slytherins were. Draco couldn't say what for what of the other houses, but he could only assume it was the same. Although he heard that some houses that had a bigger population, no doubt the Gryffindors, were still forced to share rooms but with a small group. He reckoned Harry and Ron were most likely roommates. Why wouldn't they be? They had always been inseparable. However, as of late Draco has seen Hermione and Ron together leaving one Harry Potter alone. Well, when his crowds of adorers weren't at his heels, that is.
Some blonde Hufflepuff had Voldemort (not unlike many others) while a small, freckled boy had a terrifying clown.
All of a sudden, Potter jumped on Malfoy making them both crash into the wall behind them, but before Draco could so much as react he felt the nauseating feeling of an Apparation being cast on him.
Draco's breath picked up as his vision blurred. He looked around the hall through a fuzzy gaze while sat on the floor. Naturally, Tony and his fools weren't the only one's getting a kick out of his torment. In fact, many people in the crowded room were chuckling, even a couple of evil spirited Professors were trying (and failing) to suppress their giggles. Draco felt heat creep up his neck as he noticed a burning sensation engulf his face. Once looking around the room, he found the eyes of Maria and Carie on him.
Draco swiftly rose from his spot and rushed over. He hurriedly took his wand and quickly pointed it towards the creature. A white flash emitted from the tip and shot at the Grindylow, a shriek could be heard as a large red and bubbling sting appeared on its the body. It released Luna in a second before sinking into the comfort of the lake.
An innocent smile found it's way to the two boys' faces as they continued walking. It was a strangely calm encounter. They walked for a good few minutes not talking to one another. What was there to say? Oh, so much to say, but
Draco could hear the bite in his words, but they both knew there was no real malice behind them. Draco huffed for the millionth time that morning and laid down next to the bird.
" Yes, goodnight." Draco and Harry ran off to the stairs and stopped on the ledge that divided their directions.
As soon as Draco heard his alarm go off, he sat up in his bed immediately with a gleeful smile plastered on his face. Everyone has had a morning like that, where your body is practically jumping out of its skin to start the day. Most of the time it's for no reason in particular, but Draco knew. Draco knew as clear as day why his mind and body were on the same page.
Naturally with his head start, Harry was the first to make into an open hall way with Draco crashing in behind him. They were both laughing as they leaned on the wall and reached toward one other for support. Once obnoxious laughter turned to giggles they gazed around to see the eyes of many students on them. Most were surrounded with their friend groups, but all were gathering their things and heading to a common rooms or the library.
Draco walked for a good half hour and only saw three other students roaming around. Now with his gaze down, he let his feet take him where they wanted. He would close his eyes, for the most part, only opening them when he felt as if he was going to walk into a wall.
It took no more than a second to detect the source of his discomfort. Eyes like emeralds were on him like a eagle, tracking and processing his every move and motion. The eyes belonging to none other than the famous Harry Potter. In all of Draco's life, his hardships, his struggles, he has never had quite a thrill like the one he receives when Potter's eyes are on him. Whether it be for good or bad, it always managed to rile Draco up.
Draco rolled onto his back and swung his legs forward, urging his body to follow. As he was standing a loud screeching noise came from behind him. A large mother owl was sitting where the owl nest once was, she was flapping her wings and turning her head around, freezing when she saw Draco.
Draco once more gingerly picked up the frame and caressed his mother's face using his right thumb. He turned his right hand around in order to gaze upon his families ring that was situated on his ring finger. A sliver of light reflected off of the silver jewelry and bounced right into Draco's eyes. He smiled as he quickly closed his eyes to shield them from the bright beams.
I’ve decided to take this story up through Al and Scorp’s wedding and then maybe start a sequel if people are up for it.
While this was in the works, Harry took on the assignment of removing all remaining interior fixtures. Shelving, display tables and the odd empty frame. It should be noted that upon the abandonment of the original establishment that all product was removed and either destroyed by the Ministry of Magic or retained for research by the Department of Mysteries. No product remained on the site, quelling years old rumours that the store remained intact behind the boarded up windows and doors.
“Get Bill over to do his curse breaking sweep. I want to do the exterior myself. Wash away the demons as Mother says.”
It’s really cool actually and Decram is a total crackup. Dad has me painting a background for him to visit at Grimmauld.
“I had some conversations yesterday at the dinner. We’ve got help if you want it. All you’ve got to do is say the word.”
I’ve never bought so many clothes at one time ever. We had to keep hiding to shrink the bags. I’m certain more than one person thought we were criminals!
“I know it took quite a while to get done, but now you can have this sanctuary. We know you’ve wanted it forever.”
If you did that would it be alright if I brought Dud down to see the owls? I really don’t think he’d be interested in the painting part but Lucy would be definitely I’m pretty sure?
All recipients of this letter have agreed in writing, in advance of the receipt of this letter, a disclosure concerning the dispensing of information to unauthorized media. You have been advised to not speak of the event or disclose the location. You have signed the agreement. Hermione doesn’t joke, the Ministers consequences are HARSH. I wouldn’t chance it! I mean, recently it was 18 Week Boils and the uncontrolled spewing of Dad Jokes!
Malfoy didn't understand where he went wrong. They were almost having fun, they were insulting each other but it was friendlier than it had ever been. But Potter didn't care do he? All he ever thought about was that filthy little mudblood and that dirty muggle-loving pig!! Malfoy gripped the desk behind him so hard his knuckles were even white against his pale skin, his teeth grinding to not trigger Potter more as his magic was too unstable at the moment to mess with.
That wasn't like the git Harry first met at Madam Malkin's four year ago getting his robes fitted. Even if they hadn't known each other back then, Harry still considered it their first interaction.
"Malfoy, what the hell are you doing?" Harry said with a barely audible gasp as he felt the blonde's hands through his hair and his body right behind him, trespassing in his personal space.
He was sitting cross legged on the ground facing the door, his back half turned to him slumbly. He could see Potter's face, his lips slightly parted and his hair messy as ever as, his glasses sitting slightly lower on the bridge of his nose than they were intended to and his right arm supporting some of his weight. He looked strangely eery in the dimly lit classroom as he muttered the terrifying words to him.
, D-Draco Malfoy, because I think you deserve it, Not that how y-you treated Hermione and Ron was okay o-or acceptable at all, but I think y-you can do better, that's why I'm going to h-help you however you want, I mean, however I can, to do better from now on. Y-Yeah.....Yeah..."
There was something warm in the blonde's eyes, something about how his hair was falling softly on his face, something about how lean and delicate his fingers were wrapped around his wrists, something sweet about how his first name sounded falling from his lips, and Harry wished in some twisted fashion that Malfoy was always like this.
The brunette pulled out his map and started looking for him as the faint echoes of Myrtle's wailing could be heard from the pipes.
Harry rather pitied Malfoy if he was being honest. He had been an asshole to him, Hermione and Ron since they knew each other's name, but he still didn't think Malfoy deserved to end on the streets, or worse, forced into sex by his own family.
Not even five minutes before a Malfoy with out of place hair was late for lunch, so the two of them must have gotten into a fight. The bushy haired girl wanted to smile when she was reminded of the straight-to-the-nose punch she had sent Malfoy's way last year.
Hey, I'm really sorry for not posting much, I'm going through some shit. I'll try to upload more from now on :))
Thank you for reading until the end! I hope it wasn't too bad, even though it ended with almost no smut oof sorry
"Is it true that I can wha--" Harry started before it hit him and he jumped up taking Draco with him as the two boys stood at their feet, the brunette's green eyes shining with epiphany.
Unstable magic was one of the most dangerous kinds of magic, that's why it's supposed to minimize when a wizard gets his wand. But from how angry Potter sounded he could be the next thing to crumble down on the floor snapped in half.
"I, I really have no idea. But I certainly don't hope I'll have to get beat up in the future just to get hard" he half joked. Potter chuckled a bit. Malfoy was desperately trying to breath normally, It wouldn't do him any good to have a panic attack with Potter here.
"Your detention is going to be spending time with each other every day for two whole hours inside the same room. But the real catch of this is that both of you should be safe and sound when you get in and get out of it, that means no fighting"
"We're going to have a bath together silly, we're at a bath" Draco responded as he started to unbutton his shirt slowly, almost as he knew it was torturing to Harry.
He imagined the twigs were Drac- Malf- that git's wand so he wouldn't make more of them. He remembered how furious he looked when Moody had transformed him back into a human, how ruffled his hair was, it didn't look half as bad at him, and that annoyed Harry.
"Show yourself or I'll call Madam Pomfrey back here!" Draco said steadily, his heart pounding with fear and anger at letting his vulnerabilities come to light in front of a possible audience.
Harry told him in an ironic tone, attempting to bring the old Malfoy back up since he couldn't accept that Malfoy hadn't insulted him yet.
Even at a moment of such humiliation and embarrasment, Harry couldn't help but admire him. Still, he had to do something, he had to leave from there before the little self vanity he had disappeared from sight.
Malfoy heard him shifting around and stared at him with blue gray eyes, waiting for what he had to say. Harry looked at him for a moment, his adam's apple bobbing as he swallowed.
"It's okay, I didn'tmind itHarry" the blonde said as he looked at the other boy warmly. It was hard for him to not grin, but he somehow managed.
The young witch looked at him curiously, which only reminded Harry of Malfoy, who happened to be in the Hospital Wing right now because of him.
"Dobby is here to ask Professor Dumbledore if Dobby can work at Hogwarts School of Wizardry! Dobby is happy because he was accepted! Dobby will be close to Harry Potter now all the time!" Dobby said excitement leaping into his voice as Harry backed away a bit to look at the house elf with the shining eyes.
"But enough about who can do this or who can do that, the time is exactly 8:12. You will enter the classroom I will guide you to at exactly 8:15. You will be released at 10:15. I believe you will use this time with each other wisely" she looked at the two of them hopefully, they were so much more alike than they could ever muster.
He just wanted to sit on the grass with him for hours on end and see the sun warm up the Gryffindor's tanned features, and in the night he'd swim in the Great Lake with him and they'd laugh together at Draco's jokes and comments, because he didn't actually mean them it in that dream.
Malfoy's snarky voice ringed inside the brunette's head and the remote corridor he found himself in.
When he was ready to knock on the door after a whole two minutes of calming himself, he yelped and almost jumped back from seeing Malfoy standing next to him on fleek like usual.
hey! before each chapter please look at the tags since they'll be updated in the future, also I wanna say that this fic is gonna be pretty long, my estimations are about 40-50 chapetrs long from how things are turning out, I even had to make a fanfic plan to have the major plot points together so this doesn't turn into an even bigger mess that it already kinda is??? like plot so far has been pretty weak ngl,, but I'm trying!! hopefully the next chapters where we see more direct action and past memories of Draco will be more interesting, but for now, here is some loooong awaited smut for you all, cuz these boys are horny
Harry wanted to talk to him. He wanted to ask him why he was crying. He wanted to know if someone hurt him.B he had no words.
Harry almost giggled from the emotional exhaustion, the previous emotions crashing over him again. Hermione was still furious at him and Ron would rather puke slugs again than care for him.
Harry said, with a concerned look at his face that Draco couldn't see as Harry was looking at his shoes
The blonde shakily raised his arms too and wrapped them softly around the standing boy's waist, only making Harry's attempts to calm himself harder.
Trying to fill the awkward silence that had fallen over the two boys, Harry turned completely to look up at the blonde leaning against a desk with his back, his legs crossed and his hands steading himself to the desk with his gaze looking on the ceiling, his neck exposed. Harry just stared at him.
"I'm-I'm Sorry, I,I don't know what got into me before" Harry apologized immediately as he desperately tried to remember how to conjure a Patronus and what memory to use, but the only thing he could think of was how warm and how nice that hug was.
"Harry Potter! Dobby has not seen Harry Potter in so long" Dobby said with a shrill voice as Harry crouched down a bit to hug the small creature.
His eyes burning and his hand tightening and creasing the soft fabric over his heart, as if that would make his insides hurt less.
As much as he hated to admit it because we're talking about his enemy, Malfoy was quite attractive. Harry touched his hair and he remembered how thin the git's fingers were, tangled in his hair. He felt his face burning as he remembered how close Malfoy was.
"Harry, you really ought to stop fighting with Malfoy that much, don't you remember the ferret incident in September?"
He grabbed Hermione's stuff and walked up to where Ron was sitting, completely aware that the half Great Hall was watching him.
They soon ended up on the floor with a look thud, Malfoy getting the upper hand from his sitting position on Harry's stomach and punching him, throwing his glasses off his face, both panting and flushed.
He remembered all those things, but he realized he didn't know what he felt towards her. Sure, she was attractive, athletic, nice, interesting, but he didn't know what else he felt except from admiration anymore.
Harry finally managed to say,while grabbing Malfoy's wrist. Draco had almost walked out of the room when he looked back at Harry's emerald eyes.
"You Mr. Potter on the other hand, while you get angry at people and shout at them and all that, you never use their true weaknesses against them, even if it's someone you don't go along with that much. While you Mr. Malfoy, if I may add, don't really mind doing so as long as it gets a reaction from them"
"Potter, I swear on every last galleon that's inside the Malfoy vault I will leave you infertile with my boot the next time you try to kick down this door the Muggle way" The blonde boy snapped at The Boy Who Lived.
The caretaker said with a sly but crooked smile, the older man's mouth a mere foot away from his hair and of Malfoy's eyes. Harry hadn't grown much during the summer, unlike Malfoy that now was taller than him by a few inches.
The blonde looked up from his shoes to see the door open, before looking startled to his left to see none other than Potter himself standing there, avoiding to meet his eyes.
"So, lately I have been thinking of a new approach if you may say, about the whole situation, since all those normal detentions don't seem to be working" she added unaware of how malicious her words sounded. Harry could only hope she didn't mean letting Filch deal with them however he pleases.
He didn't understand the reason behind this feeling, maybe it was that no one had ever touched him like that, or maybe it was the Slytherin's odd behavior. He didn't know, and he didn't care that much. He just didn't want it to stop.
" he said with a smile, looking at now Harry's slowly turning redder face. Harry sat down next to him, unable to look at Draco's face, knowing it was too tempting to hug the Slitherin.
"Wait, you're an albino!? But your eyes are blue grey, I thought people with albinism had red eyes, and your skin isn't that pale…" Harry rightly pointed out.
"Let's start again, shall we?" He said and could feel his body on fire, but a rather nice fire he liked.
couldn't figure out what Harry was going through. There couldn't possibly be any other two people more oblivious to each other's feelings for sure.
Draco sat on a nearby chair and tried to calm down as he buttoned up his robes. He was almost painfully hard. As nice as that spontaneous hug was, he was already excited while he held Harry's wrists, and that hug didn't help his situation at all.
"WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU DOING A MINUTE AGO YOU HYPOCRITE!!?? AT LEAST SHE DOESN'T MAKE FUN OF PEOPLE LIKE YOU!! AND RON, Yes He's An Asshole Sometimes, BUT JUST BECAUSE HIS FAMILY ISN'T RICH LIKE YOURS DOESN'T MAKE HIM ANY LESS OF A GOOD FRIEND OR A WORTHY WIZARD!!!"
Catssssss if u read this can you please tell me your thoughts? I'm open to constructive criticism and I would gladly hear your advice :)) thanks for reading!
The brunette snapped out of his trance and lied quickly "W-Well, he was more civil than usual so that confused me because he's an arse but if he wasn't an arse anymore he wouldn't be too bad to hang around with and d-d-do stuff with, you know?"
He pushed the thin sheets off his chest, shuddering under the lack of warmth now that he was exposed to the chilly weather, and let his legs dangle off the bed, not stepping on it yet as his grey blue eyes searched around the room for any signs of another person.
-So-orry for your sleep quality Ma-, Draco, but these beds and their itchy sheets were never really my thing you know...."
He knew that he had fainted and that it took about half an hour after he came back to his senses to be under the Medi-Witch's care from what he had been told, but he wasn't sure about what happened between the moment he came to his senses and the moment he was taken to the hospital wing. His memory was foggy he was too tired to try to remember, hopefully Harry would tell him what happened now that he had no choice but to stay here with him for a while….
He could feel his eyes stinging a bit from how overwhelmed he felt from all the voices he could still hear in his head. Those stupid badges were around for less than a week, but they were already ruining his life more.
Harry woke up drenched in sweat. He saw the usual dream he had been seeing for months. A windowless corridor leading to the black door but, as he had been used to waking up before he could open the door, he looked on his right and saw Malfoy.
"He'll be alright missing for a few hours Pans, he's got his hatred for every living being to keep him warm" Zambini said in a sing-songy way. He really couldn't care less for who Malfoy was probably snogging right now, as long as he didn't hurt Pansy's feelings he could ass-fuck that Hippogriff for his arm all he wanted.
He couldn't sleep much when he wasn't sure if that stupid blonde arse was alright, especially since he wanted to apologise privately to him. He didn't want to risk getting caught going to see his "mortal nemesis", so he didn't use his Invisibility Cloak.
She stared at the brunette as he sat next to Collin facing the Slytherin table. Ronald was too caught up being mad at Harry for no reason to sit close to them.
"See he probably thinks the same this exact moment, not even mentioning that Mr. Malfoy would say it with a more rude way, but the important part of it all is that Mr. Malfoy is collected and controls himself unlike you, which of the above none is a real insult to any of you, just something we can take away from this. His grades are also of the best in your year, something I can't say for you too Mr. Potter"
As Harry reached Griffindor tower, he couldn't fall asleep. All he could think about was Draco and after what felt like hours he managed to fall asleep
Harry rambled nervously, his body begging for more friction as he tried to keep his groin as far away from the blonde he could without alerting him. He didn't want to make it seem like he didn't like the hug, it was just that he liked the hug a bit too
Malfoy didn't miss the implication that Potter was worried for him and tried to make a mental note from his exhausted state.
Potter, instead of telling him he's impressed he was with his vast knowledge on a seemingly random subject -as he should according to the blonde- , just pursued his lips in a frown, his angry gaze at him. It made the blonde's ears burn and his throat dry at how intense it was, which probably wasn't a good sign.
Harry froze on the spot, his eyes widening as he was taken aback by that fact. His brain was so overwhelmed he didn't realise Malfoy had his wand on his neck, his face still flush as he spoke.
And Harry could feel the warmth of Draco's hand fill his body to the brim with an incredible sensation Harry couldn't explain with words. Then Harry took Draco back to the Dungeons glimpsing at the Marauder's map as to not get caught. They said their still awkward goodbyes and Harry took off for his dormitory.
He gave shallow explanations for what he felt, deep down knowing they were lies, and ironically, pretty stupid themselves.
The lake looked thick like soap that 18th of November, but Harry was more concentrated on breaking twigs under the shadow of a tree to care. He would use his wand, but it wouldn't work as good to relieve his nerves.
And, of course, that characteristically messy hair of his was easily recognisable after so many years of observing and teasing him.
"Alright, Alright, Calm down...D-Dracon?" Harry said hesitantly. He didn't want to upset the blonde, it wouldn't do him good to even get off the ground at the moment without medical assistance.
Sorry for being late, I unfortunately was hit by a strong writer's block :( fortunately, I had finished a few chapters so it hopefully won't be a big problem
He felt the panic inside him rise with every moment that passed. He had to get away as fast as he could, he had to run to the other side of the castle, far enough where Draco wouldn't see him in that state.
Hey, I'm the writer of this fic. If you're enjoying it, please leave a comment telling me your thoughts and what I can improve. I'll try to update weekly, but my mental state isn't nowhere near as good so I can't be 100% sure about it
"I accept your apology, but try to not repeat the same things again alright? But, what exactly happened between you two that affected you so much?" She asked cautiously.
Harry would never expect to see Malfoy like that, but together the two of them will form a bond stronger than friendship
"D-D-Dobby wanted to surprise H-Harry Potter" Dobby said weakly, trying to grin reassuringly but it just came off disturbing because of his already exaggerated features.
"And I...I...I don't k-know how to-" Draco started again but was cutted short by a pair of hands hugging him and a head full of untidy raven black head on him
Next thing he knew, he was getting up and gathering his things. He had to leave or he was worried he would curse every single person in that room and especially the maker of these stupid badges, fucking Dr-, Malfoy himself.
He was angry at Malfoy more than anyone else for some reason, just the fact that he was sitting there and eating from his plate was maddening. His stupid hair was a bit ruffled, a bitter reminder that he had detention with him until New Year's.
And when it was too cold to sit on the grass or swim, they'd play wizard's chess in the Great Hall and drink that 'hot cocao?cocoa? cacoa?' he heard muggles drink   -
The teachers were having their weekly update meeting. If he remembered correctly, the meeting should be ending soon, but who knows if Harry will manage to avoid cursing Malfoy until then
"Protter, I mayhave hit my head onthe way down, but I think I'm in, in the right mind to ask this" Malfoy said as he sat up cross legged, inches away from the other boy, the Slytherin's body still aching as Potter moving away a bit to give him space
"Why don't you swim a bit Harry? The water is really nice you know" Draco asked his companion that was just standing still near him.
But Harry was sure Malfoy was anything but peaceful in a situation like this, if he was him he certainly wouldn't be able to keep up an impeccable facade and act like nothing happened to his fellow Slytherins, master actors falling for his lies. Harry was almost impressed by his abilities. Almost.
Harry swallowed dryly from the taller boy's words and stayed silent, all he could think about is how terrified he had sounded the last time he had told him those words. Malfoy seemed to pick up on the sudden change of the atmosphere around them and just looked at the door in front of him.
"I did not expect the Boy Wonder to be so incredibly insecure" he said maliciously "You'd think all those people fanboying over you for killing your parents would have gotten more into your head"
He didn't know what to do, he didn't know how to help Malfoy get back to his snobby self instead of acting like an inoccent but still a bit bratty child.
Draco knew it was stupid to just stare at the doors, hoping Harry Potter, the only survivor of the Killing curse, the Fourth champion of the Triwizard Tournament, the youngest Seeker of the Century, the boy who slipped from the hands of the Dark Lord again and again to look at
This was all his fault, if he hadn't let himself get that angry his magic wouldn't make Malfoy like this. Even if he was right to be mad, losing control was a mistake.
He got up and walked closer to the lake, before throwing a rock as big as his palm in the lake as far as he could. He watched it get eaten by the dark waters and admired the faint waves it created in the water, before it calmed down again. When the stone hit the water he could swear he heard a crack, but it was probably leaves crunching under his feet.
