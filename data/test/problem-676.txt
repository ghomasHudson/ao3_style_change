He quickly wiped at his cheeks before pivoting, trying to shake off the somewhat dark sensation Granger’s revelation had caused within him.
"What are we, really?" Draco repeats, a bit slower, arching an eyebrow. "It seems there's been a misunderstanding here. I was under the impression that we were involved in an actual relationship, but clearly we aren't on the same page. So what are we really? Fuck buddies? Friends with benefits? Am I just one more of your many sex-escapades this year? Didn't think I was easy enough, so you had to buy me over with dinners and dates?"
"Back then, did you know?"
"You don't have to ask." Harry laughs. He sounds so formal. It's endearing, sweet even. "You just have to let me get used to it."
Right, point taken. Now will you get on with it and tell me what’s wrong?
Potter's eyes softened, smile turning rueful, and he shook his head slightly. He made a gesture, a point downward.
Leaning back against the headboard of his bed that night, Draco casted a Lumos, took the notes out from the book and spent hours reading through each one. He only noticed his fingers gripping the parchment tightly when he released them, seeing the dips of them creasing over the parchment.
The sensation of crawling inside his own skin had Draco rolling his neck in discomfort and clenching his fists until the whites of  his knuckles turned blue. He moved over the expansive Hogwarts grounds with hastened strides to the edge of the grounds. The Quidditch pitch towers slowly came into view.
It all came down to the fact that most witches’ and wizards' assumption that portraits were objects, and were not, instead, susceptible to certain spells because of this. Draco, whose whole childhood was spent in the company of watchful portrait eyes, knew that yes, portraits were just as susceptible to a good
“He was beautiful. The best thing I’d ever seen. All the gold and gifts were nothing to me when he was in my eyeline, my dreams, my thoughts. And I wasted it. I scorned him for years, shoving it all down and pretending not to feel, to fit the mould I had cast myself in. I loved him, Mother. I loved him so much and I pretended not to — to him and myself. He is my soul. And now my soul is dead. It’s in a small graveyard in Godric’s Hollow, all alone and cold and—”
It took him a few tries to get it right. It took a lot of his air and energy, left his breaths shallow and his eyes closed, leaning just so into a body that wasn't here. But then it was there, clear through the room; a soft and grainy tune in the tremor of a woman's voice, the way all old songs have, singing,
Draco laughed, the elation of his discovery filling his chest up so much he felt

and a grip of a gossamer hand around his hand, guiding it towards his own chest where the resurrection stone was.
At the end of the page,
They caught eyes and Harry was overtaken with butterflies in his stomach, but then a curious sense of déjà vu, and an awful sadness.
He was
“Why are you still here, when you killed Potter?!”
" I didn't tell you."
This was new. He was sure it hadn’t been there that morning.
Draco looked up to Harry, who smiled with all of his teeth, his head nodding.
he mouthed, his finger pointing at Draco, then at his own chest.
The coloured footsteps led him into the Forbidden Forest. There was the rush of the wind, and in the silence, he could hear the amplified sound of his own steps crunching dried leaves under his shoes.
With a silent whimper, Draco folded his arms on the table and slumped down into them. He sat trying to breathe through it, trying to form a shout to call for help. Neither worked. A hot wetness streamed from Draco’s nose. Instinctually, he wiped at it, only for his hand to come away a deep, dark red before a coppery tang filled his mouth.
Draco mouthed wetly, having no air in his lungs to sound it. Harry’s eyes brimmed, and Draco wished for nothing except to be able to hold that warm-looking hand, closed so tight the knuckles were bone-white.
But then in a blink, Harry was gone and Draco was left alone in hills full of the colour he stained into them.
Granger's eyes were still dull and lifeless when she finally walked away from Draco. He stood in the empty, quiet corridor. Her words, and the silence thereafter, left a howling roar in Draco’s chest.
The book smelled like ash and the spine had scorch marks on it.
"Yes,
"I can see the exact place he stood. When they threw him here? When he jumped out of the way of the chandelier falling over him and his friends? I thought he was going to die here." His gaze tore away from the footprint, onto another one. He licked his lips, dry and cracked. "I thought it would be my fault if they…"
Draco pins him with a disappointed look, and then stretches his arm out to show him the book, shifting closer to him. "I'll revise the first half with you, then. I'll explain it to you and then we'll continue from where I left off."
There had to have been something like forty scraps of parchment folded into the pages of this book. All of them seemed to be thirteen-year-old Potter letting off some steam or boredom. Draco even spied little badly sketched pictures, all of them still charmed to move – something that Draco himself was partial to when riling up the boy.
Granger’s voice had sounded so lifeless around each of these utterances. Then an awful anguish sounded;
"Need I remind you,
“Recently, I’ve treated some of the most bizarre cases of my career. Some might argue the most tragic.” Pomfrey had this faraway look in her eye before she returned to Draco. “You see, war is terrible, death is terrible
In the Great Hall, Draco slowly stirred his porridge. He tried to take a bite before instantly spitting out the cold mush. Looking around to check if anybody saw it, Draco surreptitiously began stirring again, as if nothing had happened.
Draco found himself following down the steps in her wake.
Draco wanted to say.
Things like these, with time, became easy and comfortable with her. She became one of the few people in his life that he'd grown used to the touch of. He isn't sure if she had ever noticed that he never initiated any of it, how he stilled under her hands in the beginning of their relationship, but he also knows she believes most boys don't like that sort of thing as much as they like sex.
He smirks at Harry, and smiles at him, and jokes with him. He leans his grinning face into his own to see him laugh at them, and he always squeezes in beside him on the occasions they gather together with all their friends. Perhaps, at some point, they have all become somewhat friendly with one another; Pansy and Hermione, Blaise and Ron, Harry and Draco.
“I’ve never wanted anything more, you know. I…I suppose I’m hoping I’ll see you, that we will find one another on the other side.”
He fell asleep as Narcissa carded her fingers through his damp hair. She was humming a song Draco thought he might have heard in his dreams.
Draco doesn't say anything. Harry doesn't look up at him.
There were diagrams, ghastly imitations of the Red Cap's appearance. There were thoughts of an active and living mind, curled into letters at corners and bottoms of the page. Draco could imagine him, sitting on his bed or at a desk in the library, idly doodling as he got distracted while studying for a test,  sitting some seats away from Draco in class as he added Professor Lupin's extra information outside of what was in the textbook, writing his personal musings in the spaces around his paragraphs, thinking, contemplating. Breathing.
Draco looked at Luna, frowning. She was smiling, faintly, something else to it. A sort of sad knowing. "He's right."
“It’s okay," Draco murmured. “Jokes on them, hm? They haven’t got the balls to kill me.” He smiled at him, but it felt wrong on his face and sparked a blistering agony down his jaw and neck.
” Draco bellowed, the pain and confusion at his core demanding catharsis.
But that didn’t stop Draco eyeing the door carefully as he nigh-on ran away from its shadowy arc.
“You’re here," Draco breathed. His skin rose with gooseflesh at the careful touch. It was then that the notion of his subconscious having fabricated
“No!” he rasped, “No!”
“Potter," Draco tried, barely any louder, in case it woke up the dark.
The purple of the bruise suddenly looked very dark; a violent violet.
“I think I’ve already gone mad from wishes.” Draco murmured, pressing his mouth against the top of Harry's head. “And I’d happily lose myself to dreams.”
Draco cocks an eyebrow. "It's
"Do you remember..." Draco swallowed, brows creased. He blinked, rapidly, when the room blurred out of focus. He swallowed down hard again, clenched his eyes shut. Breathed. He opened them again, nodded at the rug.  "He was here. Do you remember? When they brought him in here and asked me to identify him?" He found himself walking past her, footsteps slow, gaze fixated and tilting lower as he came closer to the shoe-prints. "I knew it was him, did you know? I knew it from the start."
, they make their way through the empty lounge and up to the boy's dorm, where most are awake besides Neville and Ron. They fixate on Draco walking hand-in-hand beside Harry, leaning close together and murmuring amongst themselves.
“When you do, you should follow a specific set. His last. You’ll find what he’s left behind, although it’s a bit mulchy this time of year, so I’d wear your best walking boots," Luna said conversationally, as if she wasn’t potentially discussing Draco’s real — not — real delusions aloud.
Draco didn’t know then that it would be one of the last times he’d see Harry alive. If he did, he might have moved heaven and earth to touch him then. A simple caress would have sufficed —
Draco was fine for a few weeks, but then he was not.
His birthday
Some of the Gryffindors did not return this year. This included Weasley, out of grief for the man that had saved their world but had to be taken away in order to do so. They could not bear to come to the very place that they'd lost him.
On his bed, he found a letter.
"Do you know why they follow them, Harry?" Draco asked.
Harry grins, shifting around on the bed. "My brave, wonderful and darling boyfriend."
that his life was now.
Granger didn’t say anything at first. Instead she stared at him hard, her mouth forming a straight line.
As he drank in his surroundings, his eye caught on a book which was jutting out slightly on the same shelf. The book was a strange vivid red, and the white-gold embossed on it shone a little too bright for it to be anything but an illusion.
"They were the first
this one was angry, quill lines depressing groves into paper, torn into an irregular line at the end of the last word. Draco couldn't entirely tell what this was for. Perhaps it was for his attempts to get the hippogriff culled?
Lovegood reached for his buttons and opened them with a soft frown. After motioning for him to lean back and splaying a hand on his abdomen, Draco felt the warm breeze indicative of a deep tissue healing spell.
no matter where it was
Not when I’m still…” It was difficult to tether himself, to return to the quiet contentment he’d felt before he started seeing this boy in the shadows once more.
we don’t need to go,
These dreams made him realise how terribly in love Draco had been with Harry James Potter — a boy who had died to save them all. A boy who had died before Draco could be truthful with himself. All that time wasted over petty grievances instead.
“Don’t I? I think I do,” Draco said, before he could reign the words in.
The first few months of Eighth Year, following their break-up, is a bit of a haze of sex and alcohol with Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff boys and girls. Sex is fine with strangers, if it is rough and quick and impersonal. He knows what's expected, and he knows how to give it. Outside of this, it's uncertain and unpredictable.
Draco’s head was a fuzzy white before a crack of hot pain seared through his cheek and jaw. Merlin, he could even feel it in his eyeball.
Draco turned to his mother, whose eyes seemed so deep and sorrowful in that moment that he knew his mother already considered his choice made.
At least, he thought he had outgrown it. But now Draco wasn't so sure.
Cold hands encircled his cheeks, and Draco leaned into the ghostly touch of Harry’s palms. Draco watched that soft mouth move,
in this moment that Draco’s knees felt weak. It felt like Harry was really here, like he had never died, as if the image of his pale, cold body was nothing but a sick nightmare.
Draco stared at him, brow raised. "You do know what blue looks like, don't you?"
Sometime later, Harry tilts Draco's head back by a hand on the back of his hair and puts his lips to his, kissing him first for the first time. He sees Draco's eyes close to it through the half-lidded droop of his own gaze, on the verge of slumber, and there is the smallest quirk of a smile at his lips when Harry draws his head back to look at him, his snowy-blond hair tousled, his face beautiful and blissed out and mellowed with covert joy. Draco lays his head down to his shoulder again, hiding a smile that's growing broader against his skin.
as if he had never really heard of the concept before. The first entries were pretty standard:
times before.
In the moments that followed, silently fixated on each other in the dark, Draco watched his years with the boy in front of him play out in his mind, in Harry's face, older and lovelier. He watched Harry worry at his lower lip, look down at where his thumb was circling into the inside of Draco's wrist, and remembered a little green-eyed boy in a robe shop, drowning in his oversized clothes, a crack in his glasses. Innocent and still yet to live years more. He remembered him at twelve and thirteen and fourteen and fifteen, the two of them fighting, pushing and pulling with words and fists, Draco always trying to rile him up, to get him to just
Draco ran a hand over his stomach and took a deep breath, the first he’d taken in some time which didn’t send spasming pain through him. He muttered his thanks, not because he was ungrateful, but because any louder would announce the tremulous sensation in his throat.
He didn't hear it, his pinprick pupils flicking over every surface.
The content of these dreams might be seen as somewhat boring to the everyday outsider. They were holding hands as they drank their morning tea, laying in bed together until mid-afternoon just talking, their fingertips touching. In others, their friends surrounded them, and there was noise, laughter, and glasses clinking merrily.
He stopped at the sight of thin folded notes wedged into the centre of the book. He pulled them open, straightening them out onto the hardcover.
Harry paused then, his cheeks wet again, and all Draco wanted was to stop making Harry cry.
Draco saw a hand move towards him out of the corner of his eyes. He braced against it, but nothing helped the shudder that seized him when the faint warmth prickled at the hollow of his cheek. And his heart gave a sore, icky thump.
The sun was setting, blazing orange and red, and it was a perfect, sleepy warmth.
his now too-still mind adds.
the tremor of their old song kept on going.
It was Potters bed, he knew that, and yet it didn’t really sink in, like the knowledge was too large a bite to swallow easily.
Colours dominated the floor, in bright paths that seemed to connect the door to a couple of shower cubicles and then back round again to a set of lockers on the far left of the room. The Gryffindor rows. Draco wondered if he had ever seen colours so bright.
Harry couldn’t speak, shaking his head instead.
"Look at me, Harry," Draco whispered.
‘The others worked as they did in the story, I don’t see why it wouldn’t.’
but there was nothing.
Draco broke down crying, only soundlessly able to mouth,
dormitory,” Madam Pomfrey finished with a pinched frown. “
Draco was stuck on the floor, right outside Snape’s old quarters. He’d just finished Potions, and had been wandering –
"I didn't know," Draco says, quietly.
A mist settled. Draco pulled his cloak tighter, his eyes at his feet, shoulders hunched. There was a tickling cough in his throat that wouldn’t budge these days. Draco was so busy keeping his eyes on their target, keeping his breaths even, that he almost missed it.
against the heated softness of it, pulling them closer, as if he could meld with the boy in front of him and never part. He grabbed onto Harry like a man dying, and in that fleeting moment, he was.
Then something wet and wretched rolled down Draco’s cheek.
And there was Harry. Always Harry, sitting beside him with his hand to his back whenever his headache flared, walking alongside him wherever he went. Sometimes Draco looked at him, and Harry smiled at him, a crooked little thing on the faded pink of his lips, and the despair and weariness of being perpetually ill eased just so.
"We'll begin with the ingredients. That is, fluxweed, knotgrass, lacewing flies..."
Harry shook his head glibly, thankful his friend was unknowingly acting as a physical shield between Harry and a pair of all too observant eyes. He clung to Ron’s small talk like a life raft in the middle of stormy seas.
There was Potter, bright and solid, so much so that everything else paled in comparison to him. Just as it always had. It felt like Draco was floating in a dream of his own creation; nothing felt real then. Instead, it felt like he was in those small places where nightmare and fantasy roamed.
“What do you have to say for yourself, young man?!” Slughorn bellowed as his classmates picked themselves up off the floor, all in various states of disarray.
"Granger?" he asked, high-pitched and breathless.
into a clearing.
Then his mind played with the notion that Potter’s voice would never sound again, that those green eyes were lost and buried beneath mounds of soil. Those same green eyes that had stared forwards unseeingly as dust settled; a small, pale body surrounded by rubble and ruin.
“I lost something, Greg, and I won’t ever have it back. There are a great many things to live for, I know that.” Draco paused. “But there are things you can’t live without, and I found mine.”
Then a breakthrough happened, not through his own hard work, but in the form of Luna Lovegood.
She graciously didn't ask him how he was feeling. He supposed it was all there in his face anyway. She then looked down at her own hand, the one not gripping his hand. It was closed around something, a silver of white visible through her fingers. Her throat convulsed.
Harry simply tilted his head. His eyes were full of mirth, as if Draco had said something quietly hilarious, his lips pursing to hide it.
Draco stayed silent.
It was only when he was sat down at a table that he noticed; the faintest imprints on the table, colours so faded they were nearly indecipherable, but Draco scrutinised them closely until he could name them.
would never feel
"It's okay," Harry says, not liking how upset Draco seemed. "I don't really care anymore. I mean, I stopped caring ages ago, really."
Pomfrey hadn’t even finished when Draco stood up, retrieved his wand, clothes and satchel before spelling them on his person.
“Soon, my love, soon," Draco whispers before staring at his bloodied palm.
His fingers brushed over Draco's hands again. Draco wished he could feel him, wished he could feel the life and warmth of him when he was alive again. But he was not alive, and he could not. Harry smiled, and again, like a soundless whisper,
As more blood streamed, too quick for him to wipe it, Draco looked around quickly, trying to get himself to move though in his panic. He’d frozen still.
“Funny. I didn’t know Blaise or Pansy were so tactile.” Narcissa eyed his neck, and Draco cursed inwardly. He had forgotten to glamour the marks there. “People talk Draco.”
unexpected. But he's okay now, isn't he? Even Ron's okay with him now, and that's... something." She tucks a strand of her hair behind her ear, and then looks at him.  "I wasn't going to bring it up with you for the same reason you didn't, but I guess it's not a problem now. There's someone that I like."
with abandon and utter
She paused at that for a brief moment, staring at him. Then, turning away, she strode off briskly.
But Draco's eyes did falter when Harry ran a calloused finger from forearm to wrist.
The dorm, when he entered it, was quiet and still. At first, he took it all in, but then quickly his eyes darted to the red canopy encasing a four poster which was lit up like a match. The bedsheets, the curtains, and the floor around it all was a mass of colour and life. So much so that Draco nearly didn’t see the flowers surrounding the bed, all of them colourless to him.
some unheard of even within my field, even after so many decades.”
Draco slowly took out his own chain, on which the dark stone that had been tied to Harry’s diary hung. The stone on his chest moved against his clavicle. No matter how warm his skin was against it, it was always frozen.
Narcissa's lips were solemnly downturned.
The pain in his chest was worse now.
and hearing his family name from those lips did not fill him with a sense of superiority as it did with others, not when his given name would have sounded so much sweeter.
he’s not here anymore. And –
Looking around frantically, Draco
But the unfortunate part of spending all his time with her was that she began to notice, very closely, his failing health, and how perpetually ill he was. Now she was bringing up the topic of getting him checked every chance she could throughout the first week.
“You all go ahead – I’m just finishing up here," Draco murmured, his lips feeling somewhat numb as he sounded the words out.
And he stays. He always stays.
But now it made sense why Granger looked as if she hadn’t wanted to part with Draco’s wand. At the time, Draco thought she didn’t trust him with it. Now he understood that it was one of the few things left she had that Harry had touched.
, the quill sounded as Draco fidgeted with it.
It's something that makes him grin broadly just upon the sight of him, makes his heart and the blood in his veins sing when he sees him moving towards him to talk to him, pale eyebrows bouncing as he comes to a stop in front of him.
“But perhaps, the real tragedy would be continuing on without
He didn’t look. Not when Harry was this close, warm and breathing and alive, when he was wholly focused on Draco.
He looked up, unbidden, his eyes automatically swinging around to look at Draco’s back. Except, it wasn’t his back, because Draco had turned around to speak to Blaise. So, instead of the small glimpse Harry had been trying to steal, he was now staring right at Draco, who coincidentally was looking at him too.
Harry then pointed up the stairs and levelled Draco a cocked eyebrow that cheekily asked,
Harry startles at the snapping fingers, head jerking back. "What. Yeah. I am."
A moment after, Draco's bare and warm torso is all over his own, his mouth resting on his shoulder. His chest is a cadenced rise and fall against his own, limbs wrapped around him through his underarms. Harry breathes the skin of the hollow of his neck in, the scent of him and his cologne settling something raw and hungry in him. He folds his arms around him and holds him close, and wonders like always if Draco can feel his heart fluttering rapidly through his sternum.
He always knew it was Harry near him in those moments. He knew it in his bones. And his staring, he could never stop. But Draco dismissed both because of his feelings, being over-sensitised and overly obsessed with the object of his reluctant affection.
Draco’s gaze snapped to her, and the prickling sensation that Lovegood often induced rolled over him.
“That does sound tragic, Madam Pomfrey. My condolences to the victims and their loved ones," Draco said carefully. As he did, he also gave his answer to the issue Pomfrey was tiptoeing around.
He couldn’t capture anything, except for the song that was now stuck in his head, looping around and around until Harry held his temples, as if this would stop it.
“Yes. I was wondering if you’ve seen them yet?”
Draco did, holding it close to his chest.
As she turned away from him, Draco saw his mother rub her own chest, and then he knew, and his heart broke again, but not for himself.
Draco found Potter staring right at him. The intensity of it had him transfixed but also suddenly sitting up straight. He’d seen Potter like this before, many times, enough to know he should be nervous. Because, if Potter was looking at you like that, then it meant something bad was underway, and there was little you could do to stop it.
he heard it.
There's the occasional time one might see his ease and comfort with his mother, and sometimes even Blaise Zabini, and especially Pansy Parkinson, the way he'll drop his head into her lap without a thought and let her stroke his hair, but that's about it.
"You could break the bond instead? Why would you die for someone you hated? For no reason?"
Something was welling up in him as he continued to read through them, swelling into an ache in his chest. His breaths were shallow and unsteady in his throat.
Harry pulled him to the side of the bed, grinning at him. Draco couldn’t help but return it, his chest so full and warm.
But going to a Healer could mean losing visions of Harry, his crooked little smile. he feather-light brush of his hands. His eyes. The only thing that kept him grounded, kept him wanting to stay and go all at the same time. Stay to learn about the life he'd lived. Go to see him again, see where he went after it was over.
To somebody watching from the outside, they would see a lone boy dancing with nobody, giving a watery laugh at nothing as he swayed gently to the tremor of an old song.
"Shall we turn it now?" Draco asked.
Harry's first love was Ginny Weasley. Beautiful, funny, caring and fierce Ginny Weasley.
Of course Harry found it." Draco laughed to himself. "Fights off a dragon, a sphinx, a Dark Lord, and becomes the Master of Death.
It's hard to tell with her, isn't it? She can be rather cryptic."
to keep Harry here. And he’d already wasted too much time without Harry.
The day started with him in a particular state of malaise, all the joints in his body feeling sore and attached the wrong way. The weakness pushed him down into the mattress, the weight of his head leaden.
"I didn’t, I don’t..." but he was trying to deny something he could not.
Authors who had used Potter’s name to weave wizarding children's fables did so by making extensive use of their illusory imaginations. The boy had been despised by his blood relatives, starved and neglected – then later chewed and spat out by a wizarding world that supposedly revered him.
Draco swallowed deeply as his eyes fell on the colours surrounding them. "
“Noted," Draco slurred.
torturing yourself because he died. He
Her frown deepened when she gazed at Draco.
Opening it to the first page, Draco began reading it slowly, as if tasting each word and savouring it. Here, between his palms, were the thoughts of a fourteen-year-old Harry.
After days of waiting, Draco realised that Harry might truly be gone for good.
Draco hadn’t taken his injuries to Madame Pomfrey of his own accord. He’d wanted to, but every time he made to walk to the infirmary, he remembered the sheer number of bodies covered in white linen he’d found in there the day after the battle. He’d seen a mother sobbing silently over one of the beds; what laid upon it had looked so small that Draco hadn’t been able to bear it.
"Er." Harry shakes his head. Draco's body, heavy and warm and around him, black trouser-clad legs locked against his sides, feels nice, really nice, but it's not quite in the way Draco might be hoping for. "I'm not… I mean, this is nice, but I'm not particularly in the mood right now…?"
It had been both Granger and Weasley who had returned Draco’s hawthorn wand to him after the trails. The exchange was understandably reluctant on their parts.  Though, they both defended him at trial; they said that Draco hadn't given Harry away to the Dark Lord and had in fact released his wand to Harry. He had nearly crumpled when Weasley had said that Harry had asked them to help Draco if he couldn’t. It mystified them, still did.
Draco bolted awake, in the dark and grey. He had to push his face into the pillow to quiet himself.
Draco takes his face in his hands, thumb stroking under his eyes, and kisses him. Harry closes his eyes, going still, hardly breathing. Draco notices, and he stays right here, putting his forehead to his.
why he was feeling ill and was not impressed by it.
It creaked as the door swung away from them. Sun shone through dust motes and dark wooden rafters. Harry wasn’t breathing, not really. His teeth had sunk into his own lip and his eyes were wet.
Draco sniffs, haughtily. "Take it or leave it."
place.
Harry can't quite explain the aching roil in his chest. He's painfully aware of Draco behind him, so close, and yet so far.
He stilled immediately after he uttered it, releasing the utter truth of the statement he hadn’t meant to voice. Draco looked down at the train carpet, where his left foot was tapping nervously. He could sense Harry's malaise and he wanted to shy away from it or banish it entirely.
Draco still comes looking for him after classes and smiles at him and talks to him just the same. He walks with him back to either the Slytherin Common Rooms in the dungeons or walks him back to the Gryffindor Towers. He laughs at his jokes and makes him laugh, too, with amusing or peculiar anecdotes and witty remarks. Nothing else has changed besides that Draco just doesn't touch him all that much anymore, and Harry is vividly aware of this.
The last of the distance on their walk back to the Gryffindor Commons takes place in silence, Draco's hand tangled with Harry's.
Draco had stood there, stunned with shock and horrible grief, watching the chaos of others' grief unfolding; Granger's mournful cry as her hands shot to her mouth, Weasley's screams, mingling with the screams of his sister, Longbottom wide-eyed and shaking–
But then after a couple of weeks of writing standard phrases, and something about escaping the Dursleys, it became interesting
to know everything about him."
He pulled up the mattress, showing Draco underneath, and there were hundreds of pictures, all of them a riot of colour and movement.
Possessed, Harry reached it and pulled the dusty door handle down. The snib opened with a
touching Harry kindly or having felt his skin under his fingers. This knowledge was unlike any other pain, even if he had Harry’s ghost all to himself now.
"Last May," he said after he searched her features, which revealed nothing except the calmness Lovegood wanted him to see. "It started then."
It had become a habit to make himself scarce on the big dates, and today was the day the Dark Lord led the Burberry Massacre. He had not been a part of it. Draco had been at school, but such facts were waved off in the face of righteous blame and pointing fingers.
“I don’t care anymore, Mum," he said. Any spark for a fight always dwindled very quickly these days. “I want to be alone.”
“Come here often?” Draco piped up, keeping his eyes overhead, and now his memory was veering off course into unknown territory.
The hand that was holding onto his wrist tightened, and another arm reached around him slowly, gently. Malfoy then hummed it, the song that Harry’s mind was stuck on. They swayed together to it, their bodies close, pushing into one another’s embrace, as if they wanted to suffocate with it.
” He breathed excitedly.
Harry takes a breath, his heart pounding fast, his hands growing heavy, but he lifts them anyway. He reaches out a hand and curls it around Draco's bicep. Draco's head raises up from the book to look at him, his voice fading away. Harry tugs at him, Draco follows his hesitant maneuvering, scooting closer, shifting around to lay back against him when Harry pulls him in against himself and folds his arms around him.
Coming to a stop outside the portrait of the Fat Lady, Draco releases his hand, sliding it down his palm, catching on his fingers before letting go, and says, "Good night, Harry." And then he leans in and kisses his cheek, and Harry is left brimming with a familiar, aching longing.
Harry sighs, exasperated. "Her name's Ginny, Draco. And it's not like that. It's just that I'm used to it with her. With all of them."
Draco's chest ache was aggravated by the time the final class of the day rolled around and made it difficult to focus. He was relieved when the bell rang and he was able to go see Madam Pomfrey, Goyle following at his side.
as him or the next person, and yes, Draco was not above Confunding his Great Uncle Tiberius’ portrait when he was trying to keep an eye on one mischievous great nephew.
Draco takes him in against him, one hand on the nape of his neck and the other going around his shoulders carefully. Something has become a little eased and light between them now, enough to let Harry touch his waist tentatively.
He makes polite small talk with Hermione regarding homework, and with Luna on her nargles and her other weirdly named creatures, and he banters with Ron in a way that's amusing rather than angering.
“I will," he promised quickly. “Of course.”
unfit." He yelped as he gulped down air.
Thankfully, the witch took pity and closed the curtains again
They keep walking on, and there's nothing said, and then, "It, er." Draco looked at Goyle. He was eying the sky, brows furrowed, confused. 'It looks blue enough to me."
"…After your partner sets the quartz in place – exactly in the centre of the cauldron – you will stir around it, clockwise for forty-five turns. Oh, look, there is that number again, Mr Potter…"
Potter’s finger halted over a bruise, blooming just below the place where his crisp, ironed cuffs settled. In his peripheral vision, Draco could see that mess of black hair tilt upwards, and he knew that those green eyes were boring into his face.
I can kiss him here, I can feel him kiss
“What you did for me? That’s what I didn’t deserve Harry.” Uttering Potter’s given name made his throat tighten so much that it felt like choking. “Harry.” He said it again, simply because he had never done so before then.
blessedly
“I suspect it will give everyone a good laugh,” Draco said lightly. “The Malfoy heir, a poof.”
Burns threw a brutal fist at his face, and Draco gasped, but it came out in an awful wretch before Burns continued to suffocate him.
‘What is this?’ he asked dumbly.
Potions went well. He got down some of the instructions. He stopped writing half-way through Charms, when his headache built higher and deeper against his skull. His nose bled again, all over his textbook cover this time. He dabbed at his face with a handkerchief.
He lowered himself into an armchair by the fire, turned up his record player and tried to focus on the song to keep his mind off of such thoughts.
Draco's hand is lurching out, then, grabbing ahold of his. "I didn't say we couldn't," he said softly.
He had seen it announced in the Prophet, a lump in his throat when he read the title ‘
Opening his eyes, blinking them as if to clear the black spots in his vision, his gaze caught on the ceiling above him; a boy sitting on the rafters, swinging his legs while looking down at Draco with a fond smile. He knew that face, but not the expression colouring it, the softness of it directed at him.
Draco leans close to him, trying to get him to look at him. "I won't ever stop you."
Draco had gone to ask Madam Pomfrey about the spell Harry had cast. It was the same spell Harry’s own mother had used to save him. She said Harry must have known Draco might die after Harry passed away.
"Really? That's great." Harry smiles.  "Who?"
, Draco secretly thought, looking at his lovely ghost in silence.
Once, he might have been offended by the colour, but now he fell into it with a strange sense of nostalgia welling up in him. The Room then shifted a little before a small, polished wood table appeared beside the armchair. On it was a steaming tea pot and a rather large tea cup.
She reaches into her collar, pulling out an unsightly necklace made of very large, irregular objects repeating on a string.
Ginny, though, is still the kind of person that likes her personal space, which made a lot of sense when she explained what it was like living in a house of nine people. She had loved him and he knows this, but physical affection never came too naturally to her, especially not in public, and who was Harry to complain when he'd never even kissed her first?
Draco blinks his bright grey eyes, bemused. His forehead furrows slightly. "Go out with you, Potter? As in…"
Draco swallowed against the sensation of his knuckles brushing against the soft wool covering Harry's stomach.
When he reached the Potions class door, he took a few moments tobright himself, his hands on his hips as he tried and failed to stop breathing like a mad man.
. His chest burned
"I don't really talk about this with anyone."
Draco dipped his head slightly, breathing him in as if he could inhale Harry and keep him inside. Harry stilled, head lifting to meet Draco’s eyes, now only scant inches between them. Slowly, their hands met.
Harry shrugs, looking down at his hands again when he doesn't know where else to look. He can't bring himself to look Draco in the face right now.
There were a few muttered grumbles of agreement before Draco hightailed it out of the class. His chest was now sore, and he rubbed at it, telling himself to calm down.
"Oh," Harry says. Well, this is awkward. "Er."
Slughorn’s glare returned to Draco. The man had never liked him, but Draco knew that Slughorn’s dislike had turned into something a shade darker since the war.
Draco attempted to straighten his spine out as Narcissa came closer.
“Nothing," Draco rushed out in a dry whisper. “That’s nothing.” He tried for a smile, still unable to meet those eyes.
, Draco read from his lips.
“And with treatment
"They were the first people to ever touch me like that."
“It was Harry’s,” she said softly, still not looking at Draco. “It was the first one he caught, with his mouth – do you remember?”
And Harry was there. As ever. Just as he always was.
Harry lifted Draco’s arm until his forehead rested where the mark lay. Draco could do little except watch, transfixed. The grip on Draco’s arm was tight; he could feel Harry's nails bite into his wrist. Draco found himself accepting the sharpness of it as a comfort.
Draco felt himself pale. His traitorous eyes sought Harry out. Green eyes stared right back at him, burning and red-rimmed.
Draco had to abort the eye-roll quickly if he wanted to keep from whimpering like an infant.
Draco struggled to voice the deep rumble of happiness, fear, wanting, and need that was rolling through him in that moment.
without Moaning Myrtles wailing and a flooded abandoned bathroom to artfully bleed out on. Draco thought Harry looked as helpless then as he did now, but now there was no Severus to save his miserable hide. Draco was full of pain and longing for his Godfather to be with him.
Suddenly, Draco stopped, his mind conjuring imaginary shapes in the shadows.
There were short notes scribbled next to blocks of text in small, scrawly handwriting. Draco had to peer closer in order to make sense of them, his eyes aching with the exertion.
But in the pin-drop silence that followed, he realised he'd only confirmed Greg's words.
Draco's body is soft under his clothes, his belly swelling and sinking against his arm. There's a faint scent of his cologne, mingling with the smell of his hair, something herbal and sweet.
Without taking his eyes off him, Harry brushed a cool, barely there hand against Draco’s hip where his wand rested. Draco pulled it from the holster and held it up to Harry.
“It’s strange
of footprints gleamed in bright little paths over Hogwarts’ rolling hills and dales. It looked as if thousands of fireflies were marching, or as if stars had become earth-bound instead of encrusted in the heavens.
all of this had happened."
Harry cocks an eyebrow, puzzled. "It's ten in the morning."
"Open it," he whispered into Harry’s ear. His neck rose with gooseflesh.
He paused, pulling at Harry's hand until he held it in front of his face. Draco splayed their fingers until they pressed against each other palm to palm, as if in prayer.
"No," Draco said. He breathed, a sharp inhale in time to a spike in his chest.  "I'm fine. It'll go away on its own, I'm sure."
he thought, with a kind of anger directed at himself.
Said librarian was now giving Draco concerned looks over her clipboard as he scoured the shelves of Hogwarts library — the largest in Wizarding Europe. Even Granger, for whom library equalled home, had seemed to note his constant presence and increasingly tense frame over the coming weeks.
Draco was soundlessly overcome with laughter then, the full bellied kind that left you without air to breathe. He glanced up at Granger, whose own face had pinkened and was trying not to laugh, but she was failing miserably.
Draco halted to a stop in the middle of the corridors, shoulders of crowds brushing past him, pushing him back a step. His brows twitched, his breaths shallow, stilled high in his throat. Potter smiled at him, a small one at the corners of his lips, which was surreal alone without the fact that this can't
Not to say she wasn't loving enough when they were together. She was. She just expressed love through other means, like through words, through gifts that reminded her of him, through comfort and reassurance and support, through yelling at the lunatics at school that tried to slip him love potions (she still does this), and sometimes, she held his hand and put her auburn hair to his shoulder and kissed him in front of all their friends.
"No," Draco says, annoyed. "The Boomslang is supposed to be
it, Harry thought as he continued butchering the newt eyes. The din of the classroom heightened as class pairs voiced their stress; the potion was notoriously difficult, and few in Hogwarts had brewed it successfully. Especially under Snape’s tutelage, Harry thought snidely.
Draco thought of himself, aged thirteen and fourteen and fifteen, his head so full of Harry all the time. He would wake up thinking of him, of how he would try to catch his attention, what he would say to get him fired up over him, feel something for him. He would fall asleep dreaming of how things could have been different, if only Harry had taken his hand on that train, if only what he felt for him was something entirely different from hatred. He would go to class with a flutter of excitement in his belly at the thought of seeing him, getting Harry's eyes on him whenever he walked in with his friends, settled onto a seat, caught eyes with him for even a split-second.
“Ah," she voiced with painful clarity.
And in that small moment, and for all the moments after, Harry’s world bloomed with colour.
“He would...he does." The
Now, except for where the footprints laid.
Her hands then went to her neck, to the chain with the snitch attached to it. She clasped it in her palms after she’d taken it off. She held it so carefully, the gesture screaming how precious it was to her.
around them.
“Yes, but not for myself. I would never leave you.”
"I…" Harry's voice has gone hoarse, his focus narrowing down to the heat of Draco's skin against his hands,the way he fits against his fingers, the grip of his legs around him. He's touched him everywhere he could ever, but there is something different about this, here and now. He wants too much, but he has never known how to ask, and nobody has ever asked him like this. Nobody has ever touched him the way Draco does, freely, openly, without limit or restraint.
"Your housemates are probably awake," Draco points out, and he's right. They did call it an early night tonight.
Draco heaves a put-upon sigh. "You may share my textbook," he says, opening his book and flipping to
There was a passage from an old tome.
Harry nods, settling back against the arm of the couch.
“I don’t give one whit what they say about our family, Draco. I do care how these gossipmongers may hurt you, and with something so personal—” Narcissa seemed to cut herself off.
Greg’s dark brown eyes seemed dull to Draco then, almost greyish.
Draco had always known the date. His first year was spent following the boy almost obsessively to find out more about him, overcome by a deep need to be closer to him in the same instance. He had forced himself to grow out of it after he was admonished for it. His grades and reputation had nearly suffered when faced with the new, difficult conundrum called Harry James Potter.
Draco was then oddly thankful for Burns’ murderousness, and he smiled, bright and hopeful.
“That’s where you’ll find me.’ Harry whispered into his neck, kissing it softly.
"Yes," Harry says. He clears his throat. "Yes, I'm alright."
"I'll definitely take it."
“Now off with you, lest you make more mess!”
of them. Some pointed away from Draco, others away
He likes their hands and body on him through the high and the heat, but he never wants them to hold him after and he never wants to hold them either. That's something he'd only wanted with Ginny, when she felt like it and she lined herself up against his body.
The bruises on his throat healed too slowly. Pomfrey said it was because Burns had put some of his magic into throttling Draco. And with the bruises, the stares and the gossipmongering was hard to face too.
I want you
About five days into the holidays, Draco ran a high fever. He was hot and cold, sweating into the sheets, nauseated all the time. His head pounded, the pain of it aggravating his nausea even more.
Pomfrey was fidgeting, tapping her wand off her thigh, and it struck Draco as one of the oddest things he’d ever witnessed. Pomfrey was economic in everything she did; every movement and every breath were exacted purposefully and with the least fuss. So, to see her exhibit such a nervous tick made Draco
And the boy just kept smiling, as if he were the one that needed to apologise.
His stomach dropped when he read the name under the wreath penned in a sharp, jutting script;
He had all but forgotten the crude drawing depicting Potter and his broom being fried by lighting. Looking back to him as if compelled, Draco's arms twitched slightly when he saw how close the other boy was to him now. Then confusion swelled; why was Potter smiling at such a cruel, petty thing?
In the corner, there stood an old gramophone.
He could no longer put it down to a trick of his mind.
Draco's lips thin together. "By what?"
"I'll go out with you, Potter." Draco nods. He clears his throat. The corners of his lips are twitching, but he seems to be trying to keep his face straight. "Well. On the condition that you take me somewhere fancy and expensive, of course."
Draco was startled by the last one. Lovegood’s statements had a prophetic air sometimes. Others just sounded like minced words, and it was hard to wade through it all. Though, after seeing Harry, Draco had to wonder if Lovegood
Draco knew the story of the brothers and the tools of Death, but he tried to tap down the rush of excitement that filled him to the brim then.
A cool sensation brushed against Draco’s arm in a mimicry of Luna’s careful caress.
Draco felt more than he saw his friends preparing to leave the train; Draco’s eyes didn’t leave the space where he could feel Harry was. A jerk of the shoelace told Draco that Harry knew he had been caught.
Harry didn’t even attempt to sneer at the quip. Instead he watched as Ron stood to go and retrieve the ingredients. He looked at the potions recipe list, but it seemed to swim in front of his eyes. His mind was too preoccupied in trying to decipher Draco’s faint whispers to his friend, Theo.
Draco's mind was racing wild with all the things he'd learned from Harry's journal and letter. He kept remembering the words he wrote for him, to him, about him. He'd been going through his life in this haze of despair these days, but never had it quite hit like this, like he could not breathe, or move from the weight of it all.
"Maybe."
For a long moment, Harry can't get his voice out of his throat, Draco's smoke-grey gaze burning into him.
Draco’s Harry-shaped obsession grew arms, legs and a personality around fourth year. In corridors, classrooms, on the Quidditch pitch, in Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade
Draco shrugged. His mother was somewhat like that; Narcissa could become quite wrathful if an ending was revealed to her before she’d had the chance to discover it for herself. His father had taken great delight in ruining a book as soon as she happened to be on the last chapter.
“Too short," Harry continued. “And when it's done, there are far too many important things we find have slipped through our fingers.”
Draco stopped suddenly, the voice snapping him back to reality. He pivoted again, this time back to the carnage he had created. Feathers, scales, powder, and gunk all made up the chaos that was now Professor Slughorn’s potions class.
, throwing a pillow at him feebly.
Now, he was sure that his attentions on Malfoy were completely unlike the distain he’d once felt whenever his eyes had laid on the boy. Because Harry was hoping he wasn’t slowly falling in love with Draco Malfoy – though for what rhyme or reason he couldn’t fathom why he would do such a thing. Because apparently the falling part was painful, awkward, and ultimately,
Malfoy drew away and Harry felt how the other boy’s hands shook.
Draco’s pain was naught in the face of what sat before him – his complaints and grievances folly compared to what Potter had been forced to suffer. He didn’t get to pity himself, and Draco would not let Potter attempt to soothe those wounds. Not when no one had soothed Potter’s.
Draco picks his hands up from his abdomen and puts them to where his waist dips in just so.
Draco's eyes had been too caught up on the corners of Potter’s lips to notice a slight shift between them. He looked down when a strange sensation tickled at his wrist. Like a memory of soft touch, Potter’s finger traced the lifeline of Draco’s palm, then down to his too-thin wrists.
“I left something for you. Look in the diary. Please," Harry rushed, and Draco now had the awful sensation that time was running out.
Narcissa paused, her eyes narrowing.
"Excellent," Draco says. Harry's shirt is fully opened from the front, and he's tugging it off of his arms. "Neither am I."
Speaking in past tense...it made the backs of Draco’s eyes burn.
He ran, all gangly limbs and terror, back into the light of the corridor, back to people, safety. Draco landed rather than ran into the corridor, one that after gasping in a crumpled heap, he realised was blessedly empty. No one saw his embarrassing brush with insanity. He laughed at himself, weakly.
He was hunched over now, his arm now constantly clutching his breathless, aching chest. But it was worth the painful ascent up the Tower, following a river of brightly coloured footsteps in a world of now ever-grey.
“I wouldn’t ever Draco,” Lovegood said slowly, her voice not sounding like her own at all. “Not ever. Not to even those who would deserve it.”
He tried to not think about the fact that he’d just placed it on his wedding finger on instinct. Draco closed his eyes against the sensation of his gut clenching with the images he stomped down on. Things that could never happen, no matter how much his subconsciousness wished for it.
Neville groaned as he opened eyes and looked down at the two bright green shots in front of him. This wasn't supposed to be happening. Yes, he'd agreed to meet Blaise for a drink. But he wasn't supposed to be getting drunk, especially on a Thursday night.
And maybe that was why he kept his distance from Hermione and the other Gryffindors. They weren't his friends and could never be. He wouldn't allow it. They were his ex's friends. They all reminded him of Harry.
"You have to write a feature on why Slytherins are the best and I want you to set me up with a certain someone…" The former Slytherin's eyes sparkled as she gestured with head towards the far end of the bar. She didn't dare to same the name out loud, Ginny knew who she would be talking about.
"Just now. I apparated in." She answered back, not breaking apart from the hug like Ginny had earlier, Hermione buried her face into Harry's neck taking in the familiar scent of him. "I've missed you!"
"No. No. Don't stop!" she cried as she lifted her foot and flexed her toes in his face. They both laughed at this before Harry began to work at her arch again with his thumb. They were quiet for a second longer before Ginny was sitting up on her elbows.
Ginny couldn't help but smirk at the determined look on the other witch's face. "It's at three."
"Nothing," replied Harry after a moment had passed. "You know that Gin." His green eyes stared into her brown ones. "He just came up for a visit. It doesn't mean anything." Yes, they had gotten drunk off of some elderberry wine that Neville had brought with him and slept together. But that was their routine. They both did it more out of comfort than anything else nowadays. Sure it had been hot and heavy the first few months when they'd both been discovering that side of themselves. But then Neville met someone, a wizard from France, and their little thing came to an end. Harry had been happy that Nevile had found someone. And Harry had gone one to find someone for himself a few months later. And when both of those relationships fizzled out a year or so later they reunited like nothing had changed until someone else came along.
He had long ago put stupid schoolhouse rivalries aside. He no longer saw anyone but Slytherins as the enemy. That was all childish crap. He was a grown man now. He accepted that a person was something more than their Hogwarts house or blood status really. Draco before the war would not be caught dead in muggle London, let alone in a muggle cafe. But Draco after the war was a different person entirely.
Blaise continued to smirk as he pulled away from Draco and noticed the hard look in his eyes. Oh how he loved to rattle up his friend, he thought.
She furiously unrolled the scroll and read the text.
"Do you think they'll get back together properly? Or continue this dance around each other?" asked Ginny turning her attention back onto Harry.
Hermione frowned as she continued to look between the two women in front of her for a second longer before letting out a deep breath and reaching for her drink. She knew the truth would come out eventually, it always did with Ginny and Pansy.
"I didn't know there was a party."
"No, it hasn't passed. It's tomorrow. I dunno….I'm not a fan...please don't make a big deal of it…"He begged as Blaise suddenly rose from the table and headed over to the bar.
"All I'm suggesting is that I think that I can get Malfoy and Potter to be in the same room together," explained Blaise slowly.
For a weird moment, Harry was filled with nostalgia as he sat back on the old iron rod porch swing with Ginny's feet on his lap and looked over at where Ron was seated on the steps of the porch with an arm around a very sleepy Hermione. For a second he forgot all about the years that had pasted and was transformed back to a simpler time. Well maybe not a simpler time. It had been the summer after the war. He had Ginny had just decided to get back together again and try. It had been around his birthday too. Ron and Hermione had just started dating. They were all in the blissful honeymoon phase of their relationships and had the whole world at their feet, or so it felt like. That was when Harry's nightmares had been at their worse, fresh, and painful from the war. He barely slept then, still didn't really sleep much to be honest. Coming outside and looking up at the stars was the only real comfort for him at the time. Ginny, who just wanted to be with him, would sneak out and join him on the porch swing. Ron and Hermione shortly after. They had nightmares too.
Blaise let out a chuckle at Ginny's confusion before turning his attention back onto Hermione. "You can count me and Draco into whatever gala you're throwing!"
"So sex? If you get Malfoy into the same room with Harry, you get to sleep with me?" She tried not to sound too hopeful of the prospects. It had been a few months since she'd been with anyone.
Pansy loved playing matchmaker with her friends.
Harry took a swing of his beer and looked away from his two friends. He wanted to give them some sort of privacy. From what? He wasn't sure of. It just felt right though.
Ginny glared at him for a second before tightly her head back and letting out a deep rasp of a chuckle. "Merlin! You sound like Molly Weasley!"
Ginny smiled as she remembered the exploding glitter card. "Why didn't you come?" she pressed.
"It's a deal," he whispered before sticking out his free hand and holding it out for Ginny to shake.
He couldn't sleep.
"Mum. I don't think Harry needs my help with finding his room," commented Ron, his mouth filled with a cookie.
"Yes!"
Okay, I promise there are Harry and Draco in this chapter...just not together.
"No not really," replied Hermione through a mouthful of food. "I mean like I owled him about the gala, but I haven't heard back yet."
"Say, what are you doing next Friday?" asked Blaise as he put down his tea and leaned slightly over the table.
"Lovegood! What took you so fuckin' long? I said 8!" complained a slightly tipsy Pansy, flashing her right wrist at Luna, where her watch was. It was now quarter to nine, Luna was almost an hour later and Pansy was already three drinks in. Ginny was on her second and Herimones was still nursing her first.
Blaise laughed heartily in reply as he began to leaf through the menu.
"I am not some poor idiot who can't afford their own drinks," snapped Draco in annoyance.
Thanks for reading and please review!
, earlier than she'd liked. However, she enjoyed having an injury-free job now writing about the beloved wizarding sport from a considerable safe distance.
"What time is the party?" she asked. Molly may or may not had invited her but she was bloody well going to go anyways.
"We kissed once!" added Ginny as she thought back to New Year's.
The Weasley finished off her article and sent it to the editor via owl before getting ready and she Floo over to Hermione's flat. The two girls had agreed to have a quiet evening in together of take-out (because both of them were terrible at cooking, despite Molly Weasley's numerous attempts at teaching them) and a bottle of wine or two. It was Friday after all.
"And Blaise...maybe!"
"Oh. I swear Mum mentioned that she owled you about it weeks ago."
The two friends then began to chat away about a Quidditch match from a few days ago until there came a soft knock on the door.
At three on the dot, Harry and Ron emerged from the room and headed outside to the back where the main event was going to be happening. Since Harry had arrived the back garden which overlooked the orchid of the Weasley property had been turned into a party area. There were clustered of round tables and chairs spread out along the lawn. There were poles extracted along the edge of the yard where strings of fairy lights and lanterns hung. There was a big banner stretched over two that read HAPPY BIRTHDAY HARRY! Harry was both touched and a little embarrassed about the fuss the Weasley's had made with transforming the yard just over his birthday. It all kinda reminded him of Bill and Fleur's wedding, even though there was no giant tent this time.
"So Neville," began Hermione as she lowered her glass and looked over at the former Gryffindor. "What are you doin' here in London?"
Blaise just smiled and shook his head before taking a sip from his tea. He'd planned on going home with the Weasley girl but then the bet had happened and he restrained himself.
Hermione would already know his answer.
Now, when she looked back at them as a couple, she just saw it as going through the motions of an actual real relationship. Harry had been searching for some sort of normal after the hell he'd gone through with Voldemort and the war. She had wanted to be that normal for him. Her seventeen-year-old self had wanted to make her eleven-year-old self come true by being with Harry Potter. But like most young love that had developed out of the ashes of the war, it eventually came undone. Love that had been passionate and fiery at the start burning out months or a few years after. All the upperclassman of Hogwarts had just been seeking out something that made them feel alive and good after so much death and decay.
"What's going on with that?" she asked, attempting yet again for him to make conversation. Neville and Harry had never really gone out. They had always just had sex. They'd never been proper boyfriend and boyfriend. Ginny thought they would make a cute couple, but Harry always shot down the idea. He didn't see Neville like that. Yes, they enjoyed sleeping together but he still only thought of Neville has a close friend.
"Potter is a big boy! I'm sure he and Draco can handle themselves. Plus all that stuff happened two years ago…" Blaise removed his arm from Ginny and signal to the waitress to bring him another drink. He had a feeling that this was going to be a long conversation.
"Are you seeing anyone? I know you are busy training owls and what not but there must be some good looking wizard or witch off in Wales that has caught your attention!" she teased slightly. She didn't ask because she was jealous. She just thought that Harry was too good looking and nice not to have a special someone in his life.
Ginny took a step back and watched as her mum kissed Harry on the cheek before giving him a crushing hug. It seemed like he was missed by both Weasley women.
"And if you do?" asked Pansy as she leaned her elbows onto the table and studied Blaise, an eyebrow raised.
"Just the usual," replied Pansy with a smile. "Hermione, Luna, and maybe Blaise."
Just then Hermione appeared out of nowhere beside them.
He dried his face roughly with a face cloth before walking out of the bathroom and headed downstairs to the kitchen. Harry's hard-on was gone now as he busied himself with making a cup of tea. He didn't bother to use magic as he took the fire red kettle and filled it was water from the sink. As he set the kettle on the stove to boil, his eyes fell onto the invitation for the gala. He'd read it twice already but he couldn't help but read it over again. Not that there was much to it. It looked like all those other invitations to the numerous charity events he was invited too over the years.
"Nothin'," replied Ginny a little too quickly. She gave Heriomone a tight smile before throwing daggers at Pansy who was innocently sipping her own drink, oblivious or pretending to be of Ginny look. Pansy was the only person who knew about Ginny's said crush on the wizard and she wanted it to stay like that. Not that she didn't trust Hermione, she did. It was just that Hermione might let it slip to her brother, and she didn't want to have to deal with him. Despite everyone else having the sense to grown up and move on from former house rivalries, Ron was a little slow on the matter.
Hermione gave the younger witch a smile before padding into the small kitchenette of her flat. Like Harry, Hermione did most things still the muggle way despite living in the wizarding world over for almost two decades now. She uncorked a bottle of red wine before pouring two glasses generously full.
"Ok," muttered Ginny after a second had passed.
, Looney! How cute you are…" replied Blaise, flashing his best smile at the blonde. "Old Blaise here didn't miss count a thing! You see there is a shot for each of us…"He made of show of placing a shot in front of each of them. "And an extra for the birthday boy!"
Harry had never liked to be the centre of attention, but he never got anxious about it until after the war when he couldn't escape it. Where ever he went, the attention followed him.
"Fuck! That's taste like acid!" he muttered as he slammed the empty glass down and whipped his mouth with the back of his hand.
"Neville mentioned that he went to visit you," explained Ginny slowly not wanting to appear nosey. Neville was a bit of an awkward topic between them He was still both of their friends, but he was kinda the reason they had broken up well not the main reason. But he was the one who had kinda made Harry realize he liked guys as well as girls and wanted to explore that side of himself.
"Harry!" cried out Ginny as she rushed to her ex and old friend. She threw her arms immediately around his neck and buried her face into his neck. She usually tried not to make a big deal of seeing him, especially around her mum who she knew was thinking about what could've been. However, she couldn't help herself now as she allowed herself to get lost in his familiar scent of sweat, cedarwood, and something spicey. Since she could remember, Harry had smelt like this. It was like he never thought to change his brand of body wash sticking with the same one since he was a teenager. Ginny knew this to be true for a fact because she'd pointed that out to him when they first had lived together and asked him about it. She'd once even gone out and bought him a different kind of body wash, which he had used to just please her but in the end, it had felt right. He no longer smelt like Harry, Her Harry.
Harry either didn't notice Ginny come into the room or didn't care as he stripped off his t-shirt and revealed a muscular and tanned torso before beginning to pull things out from his bag. He had used the same enchant spell on the rucksack that Hermione had used all those years ago on her purse during that year they had searched for Horcruxes
Ginny Weasley lived a somewhat normal life for a twenty-nine-year-old witch.
He then busied himself with taking the kettle off of the burner and preparing the french press. Although Harry was accustomed to using wandless magic for pretty much everything, he still found comfort and joy in doing things the old-fashion muggle way, e.g. making coffee. Harry had tried other coffee machines and gadgets over the years, but his favourite way was with a french press. He began to hum to himself as he put two tablespoons worth of coffee into the bottom of the press before filling it with water. He gave it a quick stir making sure all the coffee grinds were mixed in properly before putting the plunger on and waiting another four minutes.
Molly looked over at her daughter at this and sighed before giving her a soft smile. "I guess it's quite a lot." she then worried her bottom lip and looked again around the kitchen. She'd made quite a lot of food. But she always did attend to go overboard with the cooking. She just never wanted her family to starve. And that hadn't changed since they had all moved out. It had seemed to have gotten worse. She was more worried now that they weren't eating enough and that their own real proper meal was here when they came to visit.
Everyone just laughed at the birthday boy before lifting up their own shot glasses now. They all clinked glasses in some sort of toast.
Ginny ignored Hermione glare as she sat back in her seat and let out a content sigh. She knew it was possible that this bet would go terribly wrong and she would be jeopardizing some of her closet friendships just for a date and a job. And maybe it was the alcohol coursing through her body that was making her feel all content with her decision and stupidly optimistic about the odds of the bet? She didn't know and didn't give it too much thought as she closed her eyes and allowed the warmth buzzed feeling take over her body.
bloody years after the war they had tried. But it just wasn't meant to be. It wasn't that they didn't love each other. They just had some point had fallen out of love with each other. They were just much better off as friends than lovers. Not that the sex hadn't been great. That had never been an issue for them either. Let's just say it was complicated their past relationship.
"Don't worry! Harry will love it all!" Ginny smiled at her mum warmly before placing a soft hand on her shoulder. Growing up, she'd hated all her mum's fussing and doting she'd done but now she found it sweet and missed it slightly. She knew she was lucky to have a mum like Molly Weasley.
It was just past eleven as the party came down.
Most of the adults had left or gone off to bed, leaving the kids to themselves. Well, technically they were all adults, but the older ones (Molly, Arthur, Bill, Fleur, Percy, and his wife, Penelope) called it a night. Leaving, Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny left. Seamus and Dean who had come together had left together shortly after George and Phil. Luna had fallen asleep at one of the tables. Neville hadn't stayed long after arriving at around five. Hannah had left with him.
However, Harry had never been good at taking time off work. In over the two years that he'd lived on the farm, he'd been gone more than a day or two. He didn't like to leave his owls for too long. He didn't know how he would survive a week really.
As the two friends made their way over to the refreshment table, they were stopped and greeted by a number of their old classmates; Seamus, Dean, Luna, and Hannah. They spoke to them all briefly before gesturing towards the table, promising to catch up later.
She gave his hand a squeeze before dropping it. "I'm going to go get a piece of cake, do you want anything?" she asked as she suddenly removed herself from him and rose to her feet.
The morning dew on the long grass brushed against the bare skin of his calves and made the rubber of his trainers squeak with each step as he walked towards the barn. The farm used to be a working one with horses, pigs, cattle, and chickens. The muggle who had sold it to him had informed him. However, that had been decades ago. It had fallen into disarray since then. Harry who had purchased the farm two years ago had not bought it to return to its glory working days. He'd simply bought it because he liked the bones of the old farmhouse and it was so different from his previous place in London. In a way, it had reminded him of the Burrow, minus the Weasley family of course.
Something moved in the corner of Draco's eye, and through the hazy fog, he peered at a patch of wall that seemed to shift. He frowned at it, grabbing his wand from the little shelf in front of him before staying very, very still. He found himself moving forward, despite himself, his body burdened with a terrible curiosity.
"Yes. He’s here now."
"For no reason?" Draco hissed, enraged. ‘He’s my soulmate Granger,
Harry tried to keep focused, really, he did. But then whispers sounded from his left; deep, rich consonants and vowels wrapped around sharp, exacting consonants. And, despite himself, Harry found himself wholly drawn to the sound. It felt like a bodily need, as blinking or breathing did.
" Draco mocks. "And you didn't bring your satchel either, did you?"
Potter looked him up and down, a slow smile blooming on his features. He moved closer. Draco was rooted to the floor as he watched Harry’s soundless steps nearing him.
After the fit had calmed, Draco took a sip of water, and in the glass, red spittle diluted into pink. He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and that came away red too.
"Hi," Draco said, very quietly, rasping. His throat was scratchy, dry.
"I won't beg," she said after a small breath, her tone pointedly even. "I will ask you to consider all of your options, but I will not ask you to change your mind."
His mother then pulled him into a fierce hug then. She was trembling along with him, and he felt his hair soak wet.
He didn’t hear Ron’s incredulous exclamations then. Instead Harry slowly turned, his stomach dropping in freefall.
He couldn’t remember
Once inside the Gryffindor Commons, after saying the password,
to stop it.
“I can’t live without him, and it’s killing me.”
He’d had to smother it; the day he got his mark was the day thoughts of the boy with green eyes were thrown away because it was too dangerous, it was not for him. It would
He swallowed around his next words, scared of how far away those green irises seemed.
“Your necklace – it’s – what is it?” Getting a closer look at it now, it was quite obviously a snitch, and now Draco looked like a right moron.
Granger reached out to touch it and flinched at its cold surface. She was silent for a time then, doing little except staring at the dark stone, her eyes stuck on it.
"Or rather straightforward," Harry adds.
“Once,” Potter said tonelessly. “Wasn’t very pleasant the last time I visited.”
He watched as Potter’s eyes continued to flick over everything, like one would an old photo album. There was a strange set of expressions he wore that repeated; what seemed like mischief, sometimes amusement, but then an awful sadness shone through in shuttered movements and tense shoulders.
There was so much that Harry didn't get to have.
"Because living without them would be worse than death could ever be."
But it hurt.
Harry watched him in the dark, a minute pinch between his brows, mellow and rueful. His fingers were still at his wrist, soothing. In the grey of the rest of the world, he was the only thing in colour now. The thing that made him feel the most. The love of his life. His soul.
Looking down at the ground again, he realised that these were prints too. Looking around, he saw that there were
He still was.
Luna gripped his hand all throughout, rubbing circles around the back of his hand.
Silently, he fell down into a fragile state of mind, neither alert nor entirely gone. His head felt as if someone was shaking and spinning him in tandem and he wanted it to stop. He’d give anything for it to stop.
Draco shut the man’s door in his own face, not willing to look at his unnerving eyes again.
might be glowing too.
There was too much inside of him; the sickness, the wayward stares, the hushed voices, the violent shoves, and cruel hexes to his back. He thought to himself,
became laughable. “Really here.”
Weasley's sister pressed a soft, final kiss to his hand and rested her forehead against the back of it, her eyes falling shut, face contorting red. Molly Weasley came next, and then Arthur and George and every other Weasley and Longbottom and Lovegood—
"Draco," she said softly, looking at him. "You're awake."
Until he does.
Draco kicked at a suit of armour, kicked it hard again, crumpling onto the floor.
"I, er… I do like it when you do those things. I think about it all the time. Touching you. Being the first to, I mean. Just holding your hand in class or—It drives me mad sometimes, how much I—" He stops there, trailing off. He shifts his jaw, setting it tight.
Strong arms turned Harry around, but Harry hid his face with his hands. The tears were streaming, and he couldn’t stop them.
Draco fell asleep there on the cold floor, a soft touch tracing his cheek.
that he’d once touched Draco.
"Quicker than falling asleep," he said.
Harry draws out two pairs of pyjamas out of his trunk, one for himself and the other for Draco.
Draco pushed back his sleeve, almost tearing it. There was a patch of bright, pale skin, shining as if lit from within. Draco quickly pocketed his wand and, holding his breath, he ran a finger over the shape on his forearm.
“I’ll be there. Always," Harry croaked.
He nearly dropped the book when several realisations avalanched him.
The spell didn’t work, she told him quietly.
She still looked terribly worried, but relented, standing aside to allow him in with his suitcase, and then closing the door after.
Another drawing made him grin. It was of him being knocked down by a Patronus charm on the stands after he posed as a dementor.
The absence of it made him feel far, far worse. Pain in his chest reared its ugly head, and hiked up a notch, but he ignored it.
Burns was choking him. Burns and Greets were going to kill him.
He sank into the armchair more than he sat, and it felt like it was trying to swallow him. Draco’s aching bones and sore limbs eased slightly. The comfort was so much that Draco felt the buzzing threat of tears in the bridge of his nose. He hadn’t paid attention to how bad the pain was now, or how sick he felt.
As his friends walked away, arm in arm, Draco noted with a fond smile what an odd pair they were, and how perfect they were for one another.
Ron and Hermione hold hands when they sit in front of the fireplace on the couch, her bushy-haired head in a book, Ron dozing off next to her, or playing chess with Harry. Luna curls up against Ginny as she murmurs to her about the articles planned by her father for the Quibbler, or her new discoveries and the creatures she wants to find, and Ginny tugs her girlfriend up against walls in the corridors sometimes and kisses her. Seamus and Dean peck each other on the lips every so often and pull one another against themselves with a comfort and ease that's as natural as breathing.
“We can treat it.” Pomfrey stared at him imploringly. “Otherwise, without magic...no one survives that.”
Harry only just manages to nod, a mild jerk of his head, and he can't speak. His shoulders are rigid and he's so still that the kiss is chaste and quick and he's glad because he thinks it might be awkward if it goes on any longer.
he must have received this as a gift. His fourteenth, when he was full of fire and burned too bright for Draco, who had tried to ignore the squirming in his belly every time Harry was near.. Draco thumbed the pages; it was filled with Harry’s handwriting cover to cover. A journal. Draco’s face bloomed a smile with the knowledge. He held something so precious in his hands, and it had been sitting here this entire time, ever since that awful day, waiting for him to pick it up.
Draco is as funny and charming as expected, all smirks and snark and amusing remarks until they walk to the door of his common room, and then he's quiet, something mellow and hopeful on his face, like he's waiting for Harry to do something in the silence they're standing in.
He lost his voice to the lump in his throat.
you were the one that asked me out. I assumed you were well aware of my history, of who I was, of how people may feel about seeing us together, and you still made that decision despite it. If you'd only realized that you were embarrassed to be seen with me
Her words for Potter were beautiful.
Harry was late for potions, and he was running so fast he thought he might be sick.
The sun is golden as the skies begins to set into nightfall, swathing the whole of the world in golden as well. Harry glances at Draco, the haze of evening lights catching in the grey of his eyes, thinks about kissing him, or asking Draco to kiss him. So he does.
"Granger?" Draco tried again, now even more uneasy.
Draco mouthed, his gasps rasping as tears flowed down to the blood on the desk. His hands then searched for Harry’s form, to touch it, to grasp it. But his fingers met only cooler air and a slight buzzing sensation under his nails.
“Stupefy!”
” Draco swallowed, not able to say it aloud. “That truly sounds like dying.”
Draco bit back a trembling inhale.
"Salazar," Draco said. He looked up, trying to distract himself. The world looked dull and dreary as it had ever since the war ended, since Harry had gone. "It's like everything's been grey ever since that damned war. Look at the sky."
"I can't," he croaked. "You know I can't."
yes. I suppose this is what I wanted," he muttered, his hand gripping Harry’s diary.
"Not like it's a secret, the two of us." Draco nods at the portrait of the sleeping Fat Lady. "Will she allow me in?"
," Ginny exclaims. Harry finally tears his gaze away from where Draco disappeared around the corner and looks at her. "
The top corner of the page had been ripped in haste obviously. The first lines of the text made little sense without context. But then about halfway down the paragraph, the piece began to explain itself.
.’ Draco could envision Potter’s lips forming the words, the sneer that would often shape them, but not the cadence or timber of it. Like listening to something through a soundproof window.
Harry shrugs, distracting himself with the scuff of his shoe against the ground, his hands in his trouser pockets.
"I – no. Ron and I, we have said our goodbyes. You didn’t get to. Not in person." At this Granger looked back at the spot where Harry was still standing, peering as if she could she him too.
"It's not fair," Draco said, a tremor of a thick breath.  He was sick and tired and so, so sad, and all he wanted was to be wherever Harry was, and he didn't think he could ever forgive himself for what he had done. What he had missed out on when he was too busy doing all the wrong things. "It's not fair that I spent all our time hating you when you were mine and I was meant to love you forever."
Those three boys weren’t wrong, and their opinion was not an unpopular one. And if Draco could do it again, and Merlin how he wished he could, he would do anything,
He was fifteen and was sure that he might die of sprinting-induced organ failure.
The classroom was quiet except for the soft rattle and bubble of simmering cauldrons. After the brief memoriam given by Headmistress McGonagall that morning, there was a subdued, hesitant air within Hogwarts now. Gone was the easy conversation and the giggling laughter of careless, easy-going peers. Now there was a strange pensiveness that everyone had adopted, and it followed them all like a bad smell and chilled them bone-deep.
hated him.
"Brilliantly deduced Granger, now can you leave me be? I need to sleep."
These letters, the pictures...it hit Draco exactly how young Potter had been then. How little time had been allowed to pass between the notes and his death. The fact that Draco had helped make Potter’s short time among them miserable in any sense filled him with a deep guilt and remorse that sank into his already sore chest.
Then Draco coughed wetly into his palm. It came away red again.
"Mr Potter," Snape's voice drawled before Harry had even cleared the entrance. The man had clearly been waiting. "What time do you call this?"
Draco thought when he saw them together.
“You are still here with me, Harry. There...it... I can’t tell you how much it
With an audible swallow, he pushed those morbid thoughts away and dived wholeheartedly into the distraction Harry’s diary promised him. It was an easy trade off; ignoring his own petering existence to luxuriate in the burning flash of Harry’s.
For now, he wanted to sleep. He wanted to sleep forever.
He stood up, turned around, sharply. His mother was still staring at him, but now there was an understanding there. She was no longer confused of who he'd been talking about.
His levity returned and Draco climbed the stairs, though slowly. The air seemed thin to his frayed organs now. Draco wasn’t bothered by his ill health, not when it meant he got to keep Harry so close.
muscle in his body
Draco got the fright of his life when he woke up to find Hermione Granger at the foot of his hospital bed.
“Draco, it’s okay!” Goyle shouted, his face awfully pale and sweaty. “The Profs’ are coming. Luna’s sent her
Draco listened to them leave. He thought there were seven this time. They were growing in numbers. Like a virus, he thought bemusedly. Draco couldn’t get up, and his heart was thundering dangerously. There was a strange, creaky noise, crackling each time he tried to lift his head.
The pain had morphed into agony, and it spread down his person. Reaching into even the smallest of places inside him, his strength left, and Draco’s head fell to crack off of the desk.
Draco felt a cool pressure on his cheek, and he startled at how close Harry’ face was to his now.
," Draco mutters in disgust, climbing over towards Harry. "The things I put up with for you, Potter."
And it was addressed to him.
There was one that said,
Draco tore his eyes away from Potter’s grin and looked towards the bed. Potter’s fingers seemed to brush against one of the notes; this sketch looked brighter than the rest, as if the sun had graced it and forsaken the others. Turning his head, Draco realised that the picture was not Potter’s but his.
“Mute.” Draco snorted humourlessly. “Now, when you’ve decided to haunt me? When I actually want you to speak.” He tried for a glare, but his lip was trembling, and he had to bite it before that welling sensation behind his eyes overtook him. “Ah, but of course.”
"You're distracted," Draco points out, fixating him with a flat stare.
“That was yet another late night for you," his mother said pointedly.
He drank in his fill of the boy in question. He tried to imagine being ‘cured’ of this, of being cut off from this wondrous, wonderful thing. He couldn’t. It didn’t bear thinking about. It dawned on him then how deep he’d fallen into the wanting needy thing inside him.
should
“You only do that when you don’t care about how it ends.” Her voice came out sharp.
‘"Did you?" Granger pressed, seemingly uncaring of how angry Draco was.
He tugs at his waist, down towards himself, blind need and half-thought out, but Draco follows his cue, shifting around on his knees until he can drape himself over Harry's torso, stomach to stomach, chest to chest, shoulders to shoulders. His nose presses into the side of Harry's neck, arms worming in through Harry's underarms and under his shoulders and around them.
Draco’s stomach clenched at the thought. He suddenly hoped that this Harry was not real, that he had in actual fact passed on peacefully into the arms of his loved ones. It would be the worst fate; standing, watching the world mourn you, only to move on and forget you entirely.
he wanted to quip, but the horrid sensation in his chest wouldn’t let him. Every word felt precious, and Draco would be damned if he spent one moment of this spewing spite.
The image of his own blood on his pale skin, splattered on white sheets, reminded Draco of how close he was to death, and how strange it was to not be frightened by it.
Draco puts his nimble hands in his hair, winding his fingers around his curls. He kisses him on the mouth softly, and then straightens, fingertips slipping down to rest on his chest. "Whatever you want."
Classes started at half eight, and now it was eight thirty-two and Harry hadn’t even cleared the fourth-floor stairs. Hermione’s warning about casting a weak
of all things rise behind his eyes.
heart-breaking.
He was numb through it all, his heart dull, sluggish. His mind felt like sand slipping through desperate fingers, listening as Granger gave the eulogy, her eyes ringed with scarlet grief. Her face was set and composed. She looked strong, despite the way her body was so rigid—brittle in a way that seemed as if it wanted to crumble in on itself, but she wouldn't let it.
Draco doesn't come back to meld his body into his. "Do you not… Ah, whatever." He scoots away from him on the bed. "Some people aren't into that sort of thing, I suppose."
he thinks of saying in some stupid attempt to laugh it off. He doesn't. He stays still and quiet instead and hopes Draco will just stay right here.
He breathed, his chest swelling with emotion.
Strange misery came back with vengeance, and Draco was once again questioning his sanity.
The hairs on Harry’s arms rose as his eyes became glued to the ground.
"What will go away?" Narcissa asked, shook her head, bemused. She was leaning close, hand on his bicep, trying to see him. "Who will?"
Draco begged himself.
Draco swallowed, his eyes closed.
Today was Harry Potter’s birthday. He would have been eighteen.
Then, another trembling breath, his hands trembling too. Draco stepped back, finding himself shaking his head and whispering as he was turning away quickly, frantically,  “I can’t, I can’t–"
Draco’s vision and the pain
They took him to a shower which he stood in, his hands roaming all over the tiles. They took him out to the pitch where Draco leapt from where one set began and another suddenly vanished
One I never got to have, or to hold. He’s dead, and I can’t get the image of him dying out of my head. I only ever got to hurt him when he was alive. He hated me!" At this Harry shook his head furiously. "And I don’t want him to be dead, I want him here, with me. But no. He was taken from me and now my soul is crumbling to dust without him."
"What?"
"What?"
Draco’s eyes tracked a tear as it travelled down Harry's cheek, his own eyes blurring too.
Just as he is about to melt into him, finally, Draco withdraws. Harry feels the odd, inexplicable pang of the loss of his solidity and heat.
“I’m a dab hand at healing charms — have to be with the Thestrals and Grindylow… let me have a look?”
It started with the nightmares; his body and mind calling out for a spectre that wouldn’t ever appear. He dreamed of Harry, whole, happy, and alive, always just out of reach - scorning him when he got too close. In others, he saw Harry die again — over and over and over. Waking up from those particular nightmares left Draco feeling untethered and like he was sinking down into something awful.
By the next second, Draco is rolling over and onto him, one leg thrown on the other side of his waist, and he's pulling at and unbuttoning his shirt.
All he could think of was what little time he might have left with him.
Slughorn followed it, his expression confused and agitated as he searched for what Draco was looking at.
Harry’s steps led him right to it, distorted at the bed of the tree as if he’d knelt or sat down before walking on
“I don’t have anything else left of him. They took him —
and still being too afraid of somebody pulling away from you."
against his own.
hours were ahead of him in which he’d have to avoid an array of hexes, curses, pranks, and being cornered by brutes who’d rather use a booted foot and a fist instead of their wands.
Draco’s chest still ached as he walked quickly through the maze of Hogwarts Halls, down several flights of stairs, past the kitchens and the Great Hall and then swiftly out the entrance. His breaths are a laboured wheezing in the cool evening air. Each inhale pushed a sharp spike of pain through his torso, so much so that he’d hunched over, holding himself.
“I have earned it. This and more," Draco stated, stoic in the face of Potter’s intense protest. “If we are speaking of what is deserved, and what is not, then look no further than yourself Potter.” Draco swallowed audibly. “You gave everything. You saved everyone – in my case on several occasions. A saviour in the truest sense, and yet none of us deserved to live. Not if the price was your life. Not when it meant someone like you dying.”
Something in his gut told him that he shouldn’t, not if he wanted to keep Harry. All magic had a cost; and Draco suspected that keeping your own personal apparition of the
"Oh? That’s – that is. Wonderful, yes." Granger smiled, but it was sad and watery.
cute, mostly."
Draco was not invited to Harry Potter's funeral. But he dressed up in his best suit and stood in the far distance, far enough to not be seen, close enough to listen just so.
“Lissy?” Draco laughed, but it sounded wet.
Wishes that had been ripped up before they could have ever taken root.
“Oh yes, several books have been donated along with simple instructions,” Pince answered when Draco asked about the book and its lack of card. “Whomever needs it is welcome to keep it.” She beamed, which was a strange sight on her normally pinched face. Even more so knowing that the woman horded books like dragons did gold.
Between the steam vapours and his own listlessness, Draco followed the recipe blindly. He chopped, squeezed, grinded, sprinkled, and stirred as a mannequin would if it were so inclined.
“Oh dear. Definitely something serious. A head injury perhaps? No, hm.” She muttered to herself.
!” Draco yelped.
Potter held his stare – green, so green, before looking away and shrugging his shoulders. Then, with a furrowed brow, he pointed to the middle of his chest, then the willowy arm stretched towards Draco, all the while Potter mouthed the words;
‘Sorry? Harry, what
Harry frowns at those cryptic words, and even more so at the reversion to surnames. He makes a point to ask him later.
"You want me to get Madam Pomfrey?" Goyle asked, very quietly, in the end. He did that these days sometimes, acted like Draco was fragile, about to keel over with just a bit of a push.
Greg exhaled through his nose sharply before pinching his brow. Draco then spied Luna’s pale hand curled around Greg’s forearm in a gentle show of care and comfort, and it lightened the ache in Draco’s chest. And as Greg straightened, Draco knew it helped him too.
“Mr Malfoy.”
"So its real then. It would let me see…"
"Then I suppose it’s only right I deduct forty-five points from Gryffindor for your tardiness then? Also, perhaps it’s kismet that I need exactly forty-five cauldrons scrubbed tonight too? Let’s round it off with detention at eight forty-five tonight then Potter." Snape sounded so smug that it made Harry want to punch the Potions cabinet beside him.
Even Draco as a little boy had mooned over the myth that was Harry Potter, The-Boy-Who-Lived, The Chosen One.
Something impatient and frustrated reared its ugly head then. Something that, until then, Draco hadn’t let himself pay attention to these past weeks. But now, like an untreated wound, it had been festering and infecting him until it all but demanded to be examined.
Draco’s breath shuddered as he took in the words and their meaning.
The first week or two was so silent here that it was almost unbearable, but now there was a chorus of conversation filling up Hogwarts, the world stabilising into itself.  There was the sound of winds, of rustling trees, of laughter, the pitter-patter of water droplets, the smell of fresh plants, of wet mud and rain.
And Harry always looks to Draco, or thinks of him. He thinks of touching him all the time. He thinks of holding his hand, or letting Draco curl up against him, or sidling up himself against him, thinks of pulling him up against walls or against himself and kissing him first, but he doesn't know how to ask. He never has. He's stuck in his own skin that doesn't always know how to feel against somebody else's, his hands that grow too heavy when they lift to reach for another's, his body that can't seem to calm down under the weight of another body.
He sits against Harry's chest, and then draws away seconds after to shift himself back against the couch.
He begins to ease under Draco's hands and his body, even if he still can't bring his hands to lift and reach for his, or kiss him first. It's fine, maybe, at least for now, because Draco continues to hold his hand and sidle up against him and kiss him first. He puts his head in Harry's lap, or draws Harry's head onto his own and gives him head massages or brushes his heavenly fingers through his hair, his nails scratching against his scalp. He holds him after sex and sometimes takes Harry's arm and puts it around him himself.
Draco stilled, but quickly schooled his expression.
There was something about this, the thought of Goyle having his last childhood friend left after him, that hurt.
Draco was equal parts floored and confused when Harry backed away from him, and then vanished completely.
He can't say when it started, these feelings he'd developed for a boy he'd hardly liked two years ago, only that it had started sometime in Eighth Year, after their enmity had died down to something civil, after the change in Draco's behavior towards him and his friends, still all smirks and snark and snide remarks, yes, but he'd also apologized with thorough sincerity to all those he'd wronged—some forgave and some didn't, and that was fair. Harry took it as a testament to his newfound maturity that he accepted their reactions graciously and moved on.
It sung in his head and an awful flush of embarrassment rose in Harry when he felt
“Life is frighteningly short Draco," Harry said, his brows furrowed. He took Draco's arm in both hands, pulling it over his thigh.
Thinking on it, Draco would do
“Why?” Greg asked, low and confused.
Pince nodded with a confused smile. “And?”
“Why did he die, Mum? Why did he need to die?”
He climbed, higher and higher, breathing hard and walking blind. He heard footsteps behind him, following him, just as the tingling awareness of
The tall, dirty blonde haired man couldn't help but blush again at the mention of Harry's name. He downcasted his eyes and nodded his head before drawing his attention to Luna. "Luna, how are you? I don't think I've seen you since New Year's…"
"Luna," replied Ginny.
"Get the fuck out of here then!" he cried in outrage. "Me and Harry are trying to get dressed here!"
The redhead went from disbelief to annoyance in a matter of seconds.
The intense moment of silence was broken as the waitress returned with Blaise's drink. All three girls watched as he flirted with the waitress, giving her a generous tip before disappearing back to the bar.
Chapter 2- The Post
He listened to the creak of the backdoor opening and closing before leaning back on the swing and looking once again up at the stars.
"I've missed you too, Mione!" whispered back Harry as he turned his head slightly and planted a kiss to her cheek. He'd missed the witch terribly. He didn't want to think how long it had been since he'd last seen her. He assumed it had been at Ron's birthday party. Not the one that Molly had thrown for him here at the Burrow but the one that a few Aurors had thrown together at the Leaky the night after.
Harry guessed the thing that really got him was that S.P.E.W was an actual thing like an actual fucking official charity organization and not just something Hermione went on and on about in Fourth Year.
There was a genuine interest in her eyes as she pulled away and met his eye. Neville, who was a herbologist always seemed to be out of town, doing research and studying plants all around Great Britain and Europe.
"Yes!" cried Ginny. Maybe it was the alcohol talking, but she was suddenly feeling very confident that she could win this bet.
The two women held each other eye for a second before sharing a small smile.
The hug lasted for a second longer before Hermione pulled away and smiled softly at Harry before shifting her attention to Ron. She smiled shyly at the redhead. Not really sure if they should hug or not. The last time they'd seen each other had been the morning after said birthday party at the Leaky where they had gotten a room together too drunk and too horny to Floo back to their own flats.
"No. No. Bloody hell. It's not that!" Hermione looked up from her dress and over to Pansy with a genuine look of hurt in her eyes. "It's just that Harry will be there."
"Too late, Longbottom!" spoke Pansy with a grin. "You're getting Birthday shots!"
"What sex?" blurted out Ginny, her eyes blazing as she looked from her shoulder and up at Blaise.
Harry just shook his head. He didn't have a real answer to give her. He'd thought about going to the party. It had sounded like fun. He'd attended a few of Pansy's parties over the years since she'd had started to host them. It had started off as a way of them all to get to know each other after the war. A meeting of truths if you will. That was kinda how the whole thing with Malfoy had started. But in the end, he was afraid. Afraid that Malfoy would be there. And then his anxiety had taken over and it just seemed like a whole lot easier to avoid everyone and decline.
"Aren't you going to ask me?" teased Blaise as he sat back in his seat and dabbed at the corner of his mouth with his napkin. His brown eyes danced with mischief as they locked with Malfoy's grey ones from across the table.
"You don't even know the rules yet," added Pansy a sudden interest in her voice. "What are we exacting betting on...that Draco and Potter will hook up or something?"
Blaise turned his attention away from his tablemate, mid-conversation, and smiled broadly at the petit brunette as she approached the table. "Pans!" was all he said in a quieter but equally cheerfulness as Pansy had.
"Okay...and if you can't?"
"Ask you what?" asked Draco in a bored tone. He too leaned back in his seat and eyes his friend skeptically.
"Your mum has outdone herself once again," replied Harry quietly to Ron.
"What?" asked Ginny drawing her attention to the man beside her.
"It's Granger's house-elf charity or whatnot."
"You're ghastly late, Zabinni," commented Draco as he waved a hand to get the waitresses attention. "I've been waiting here for over half-an-hour like some poor fool who has been stood up by a date."
," huffed Pansy. "Plus I thought you had a crush on him." She gently nudged the Weasley with her shoulder and flash her a shit-eating grin. She loved to tease her friend about her interest in the former Slytherin.
"If you want," whispered Blaise, wagging his eyebrows suggestively at the redhead.
Harry didn't say anything as he continued to look down and focus on massaging Ginny's foot. He knew he had nothing to hide or be embarrassed about in front of Ginny. But he still felt guilty about what had happened all those years ago now.
The smell of straw and woodchippings filled Harry's nose as he made his way further into the barn. Round yellow eyes looked sleepily at him as he passed the rows of perch and made his way to the back of the barn where three stalls stood. The stalls which had once housed horses now were used as a nursery of sorts. Harry currently had a family of five baby barn owls living there. The other two stalls were occupied with food storage and other training items needed.
"Potter isn't my friend," replied Blaise coldly.
Ginny made a face at this. "Are you kidding me? I look like a cow!" complained the redhead as she threw herself down beside Hermione. Ginny hadn't bothered to get properly get ready. She'd just changed from a pair of ratty old sweats to a nicer pair of sweats before coming over her. Her long hair was in a high ponytail and there was no makeup on her face.
Draco knew he shouldn't be surprised by this. Blaise despite his upbringing, tardiness was always an issue for him. Especially, when he had gone out the night previously. Which Draco knew his friend and business partner had. The blond wizard had been invited to join but had turned down the invitation when he heard who they would be having drinks with.
"So you are telling me you didn't go home with anyone?"
"Tomorrow," muttered Hermione to herself. "The 30th. Yes, why didn't I remember that? You're a day older than Harry."
The Weasley family had never quite gotten over that break-up. Even though it had been ten years since then. And it had been mutual. The Weasley's didn't see it like that, especially Molly. She knew her mother was still holding out hope that she and Harry would get back together. Or as Molly puts it-
Chapter 1- Girl's night
"Red or white?"
The sun was up high and hot against the back of Harry's neck as he finished his work for the day. He wiped the sweat from his forehead as he walked back towards the farmhouse. Although he'd been living here for two years, the house was in pretty rough shape still. Not that Harry hadn't tried to repair it. He had. He just wasn't good at that sort of magic. He, of course, could learn. He wasn't completely stupid. He just didn't have the energy to restore the house. Plus, he kinda liked the worn-out look of the place. Even though he had wards on the land, the abandoned falling- apart look of the farmhouse kept people from coming here.
Chapter 3- Harry's Birthday
At that time, he thought he would be married to Ginny by thirty and have two or three kids of his own to take care of. Ron and Hermione too. And he had almost had that life too. But he had gone down an unexpected path instead. He used to feel guilty about it. Thinking he had somehow lead Ginny on, but she'd reassured him that he hadn't. They just weren't meant to be that was all. It still hurt Harry to hear that but he'd long ago expected that the redhead was right.
"That sounds too easy," injected Pansy. "Plus, when is it just about the two of you? I want in! And I will not sleep with any of you." Pansy, who was openly gay had no interest in sleeping with any of her friends. No matter how pretty Ginny looked tonight. Her interest lay elsewhere in the room.
Blaise just laughed at the other man's reaction. Draco looked up at Blaise darkly before pushing back his chair and rising to greet his friend properly. The two friends hugged before pressing their cheeks together.
Harry held her eye for a moment before looking away and shaking his head. "No," he answered in a whispered.
Somehow during various people going to the Loo, Ginny found herself seated beside Blaise. She tried her best to ignore the close proximity to his body as she rested her chin in her hand and tried to pay attention to what Hermione was talking about. Blaise had his arm casually draped over the back of her chair. She could practically feel the heat of his body against the back of her neck, but she ignored it.
