He was still grumpy when he climbed into the shower and for the millionth time that week he found his mind wandering. It was their last night on tour. If he wanted to talk to Malfoy, it would have to be tonight, before they left their odd little Quidditch bubble and returned to real life. But based upon their interactions today, Harry wasn’t sure he could actually get Malfoy to speak to him. Even if he could, he had no idea what he would say.
“Suzhalyavam… Sorry,” he said hurriedly, shutting the door.
“God, no.” He rubbed his hand through his hair. “I mean it was stupid because even then things weren’t great, and I thought somehow proposing would fix it, but I don’t regret being with you for one second.”
“No, I’m not and yes, I do,” he argued, but it was slightly undermined when he swayed again. Fuck, he was dizzy.
Harry’s head snapped up and he glared at the other Seeker. “Oh, you reckon?”
To Harry’s dismay, Ginny immediately snatched the phone out of his hands and began to examine it. Harry winced as she flipped it open. “It’s a mobile phone. I just bought it so please be careful.”
“So,” Draco said, leaning back on his pillows with a wince. “Did I win?”
When Draco told him to slick himself up, he nearly passed out, but managed to gather himself long enough to do as he was told and slide carefully into the unbearable heat and tightness of Draco.
. The map instructed him to hop on one of the free trams for two stops and then “ask nicely” - whatever that meant. When he hopped off at the designated stop, he made his way down a small laneway and found himself face to face with an enormous wall of graffiti. The main piece seemed to be a seven-foot-tall picture of a woman with long dark hair and some kind of musical instrument. As Harry stepped closer, her eyes flicked down to him and her fingers danced over the strings of the instrument.
With a beep, the door clicked open and they fell through it - literally. Harry only narrowly missed falling on his arse because Malfoy still had his arm around his waist.
Harry was still standing frozen in shock when Angelina appeared in front of him, “Get a move on, Potter, we have an inspirational speech to listen to.”
“Yeah, I just mean, maybe we shouldn’t hook up or anything. That way we can focus on playing and not get distracted.”
Draco wasn’t waiting in Harry’s hotel room, and he wasn’t in Harry’s bed either, which Harry collapsed onto as soon as he got in. He was so exhausted that he didn’t even bother to take his shoes off.
“This.” Draco gestured between them. “If we’re not going to talk throughout the World Cup we might as well just end it now. Seems simpler.”
“Erm.” He glanced around to make sure no one was watching. “Can you show me
“His name is Kreacher. He’s probably around here somewhere, actually,” Harry said, resigning himself to the fact that his ravaging was going to be slightly delayed. “But I don’t think he likes me very much and he’s shit at cleaning.”
Harry didn’t see himself as an angry person (though he knew a few people who would probably disagree with him on that) but he knew the way that anger and passion coexisted. He was intimately familiar with the look that Ginny used to give him when they were yelling at each other, like she didn’t know whether she wanted to hex him or fuck him. But what did it mean when a man gave you that look? What did it mean when Malfoy looked like that?
There was another murmur of laughter from the crowd, louder this time, and Draco relaxed back into his seat, relishing the feeling of regaining control of the room.
She studied him doubtfully but luckily for Harry Ron chose that moment to remember that his next batch of pastries were ready to come out of the oven.
“And where do you think you’re going?” He was so close that he didn’t even have to raise his voice for Harry to hear him.
While the first attempt had gone slightly awry - Harry blamed Malfoy for being difficult - he vowed to keep trying once they got to Melbourne.
Harry let that sit for a moment, processing it. “I didn’t think about it like that,” he admitted. “I suppose you must have thick skin by now.”
At the sound of Ron’s voice, Draco leapt away from Harry like he’d be burned, and they both turned in shock to see Hermione and Ron blinking back at them.
“Why?” Harry complained into the pillow.
It couldn’t have lasted more than 10 seconds but Harry felt as though the world had shifted on its axis when he opened his eyes again. Everything was brighter, almost painfully saturated, as they pulled apart. It was as if every drop of blood in his body had rushed directly to his brain. Over the rushing sound in his ears, he heard Filch’s mutterings moving even further away down the corridor. His eyes met Malfoy’s again and they exchanged a look which sent thrills all the way down to his fingertips and toes.
“How’re you feeling?” Harry asked gently, aware that Draco was vehemently opposed to being coddled.
Draco continued as if he hadn’t spoken. “She was the black sheep of the family, but she was my great grandfather's favourite because they shared a total obsession with Quidditch, which is why he gave her this place and basically left her to it.”
“Cheers, Arthur.” Harry ducked his head in embarrassment as guests began to look around, alerted to his presence by Arthur’s voice.
“Fuck,” he said, rubbing a hand through his hair.
They finished their drinks in silence until Krum stood up and shook Harry’s hand. “Have to go speak to my vŭzlyuben, but good luck in Scotland.”
“I just…” Draco made an exasperated noise. “Fuck, fine, let’s talk.”
Now, Harry wasn’t homophobic - at least, he was almost positive he wasn't. He’d always been fairly neutral about all the gay people he knew. Granted, it was mainly women - like O'Flaherty - but that was just because that’s how Quidditch was: there weren’t any openly gay male players in the UK and only one or two in Europe, but the league was practically crawling with lesbians. The only gay man he’d ever spent any actual time with was Charlie, but he hadn’t actually known he was for most of the time he’d known him.
“How’re you feeling?” he asked as he readjusted a strap on Harry’s arm.
Draco was falling and, by the looks of it, completely unconscious, his broom weaving back and forth as he hurtled towards the ground. Harry registered that Draco’s teammates were trying to get to him but they were too far away and play was continuing. He shot Cushioning Charm after Cushioning Charm at the ground where he thought Draco would land but it was no use - he was moving too much. Harry did the only thing he could: he put his head down and flew.
He was gratified to see Malfoy’s face go a little paler at that, but the other boy didn’t respond, he just tucked the note into his pocket and gave Harry a curt nod.
All at once, they were incredibly close. Harry wondered if he had ever been this close to another boy, or girl for that matter. He had given Ron a hug on a few occasions but it was more of a slap on the back, they had certainly never held onto each other in this manner. He was very very aware of how close their faces were, noses almost touching. Malfoy’s hand on his mouth was hot and clammy and Harry pulled back a bit, shaking it off. Harry noticed that Malfoy’s hair wasn’t slicked back like it normally was, it was just damp, as though he had just washed it, and it hung more relaxed around his pointy face.
Harry felt very, very small. “Well, when you put it like that…”
“Well, I’m actually on top of my bed. In my hotel. In Prague.” He wanted to punch himself. Repeatedly.
Lucy — that meant she belonged to the one who had been a prefect when Draco had been at school, Percy. Something about this child who he had never met calling him her uncle made his throat feel rather tight.
“So,” Malfoy repeated back to him, eyebrows raised.
Draco was still laughing but he swam over and wrapped his arms around Harry’s shivering body under the water. To be honest it really didn’t do much to raise Harry’s body temperature but it was such a sweet gesture that Harry allowed himself to be held in the water for much longer than he should have.
Thankfully Harry was spared the post-match press conference as he hadn’t played, but as he was walking into the changing rooms Wood and Malfoy passed him on their way to the press box. He gave Malfoy a courteous nod, but Malfoy simply looked through him. He found that it bothered him far more than it should have.
Harry paused, considering his options.
“Yeah, of course,” Harry replied and was rewarded with an enormous grin from Ron and another bone-rattling slap on the back.
“I’m here to talk about Quidditch. Do you have any questions about that?” He leant forward to try to see her notebook but she snatched it away.
Malfoy snorted. “Merlin, no. Cami’s a friend but she’s not really my type. Keeping tabs on me, are you?”
“I don’t know what you want, Harry.” He sounded exhausted. “And the worst part is I don’t know if you know either.”
It wasn’t, however, something anyone seemed to have mentioned to Malfoy.
Over the next few weeks, he was so busy that he almost forgot about the entire ordeal. They were only a few weeks out from the final of the British and Irish League cup and it was looking as though the Magpies and Puddlemere would both make it. Harry had had little choice about keeping up with Malfoy’s runaway success as the press took any and every opportunity to ask him about it.
“Oh, had you not heard about that?” she asked, smile back in full force.
“Don’t worry, I not tell anyone. Lips locked.”
“Yeah, I’m fine.” He took a swig of beer. “It’s just… have you noticed that Malfoy always pulls but he’s never talking to any women when we go out?”
“Erm, yeah.”
“So,” Ron said after what seemed like an age. “Malfoy, eh?”
“I’ll give you two some space,” Harry said quickly, getting to his feet before being stopped by Draco’s hand on his arm.
“Yes. No. I don’t know.” He felt horribly like he might cry. “We had an argument, I think - I don’t really know what happened. But it was for the best. I need to focus on the World Cup.”
Draco stood on the other side of it, looking at him cautiously. “Hi,” he said softly.
“I heard you won,” Harry said, trying his best not to sound like he was having a heart attack.
Pansy gave him a tired look. “Not intentionally, perhaps, but have you’ve always been more than happy to throw him under the bus when you lost your temper. You’ve never tried to use your position to help him. You know he still can’t walk down Diagon Alley without getting spat at?”
It wasn’t awkward, exactly. Hermione, Ron and Ginny all did their best to ensure things were as natural as possible, but Harry still felt exposed and uneasy as everyone hugged and kissed him and told him how much they had missed him.
Malfoy’s neck still tasted like sweat and tequila and Harry basked in it, becoming more and more aware of Malfoy’s ragged breathing beneath him.
The height difference really wasn’t huge but it was still novel for Harry to have to lean up to kiss someone. He found he liked it, just like he liked the feeling of Malfoy’s strong shoulders under his hands and the way his thumb brushed gently against the light stubble on Harry’s cheek over and over.
“Last night! I got up to get some water and your bed was empty so I figured you’d taken him up on his offer!” Ron bounced from foot to foot impatiently. Now he had his glasses on, Harry could see that his red hair was sticking up in all directions so he must have only just woken up.
“We were!” Harry insisted. “I thought we were at least.”
Lennox Campbell was the Seeker for both the Montrose Magpies and the Scottish National Team and, while he’d let them down a few times in the past, he seemed to be having somewhat of a second wind this season.
“Fucking yes.” Malfoy was babbling, head thrown back, one hand resting passively but possessively on the back of Harry’s head.
“Hang on,” Harry said, stepping towards him but he was already out the door and Harry heard the Floo in the kitchen go.
“Alright, let’s talk about Malfoy,” she began ominously.
He got his next opportunity at lunch. As usual, Ginny, Angelina and Oliver were sitting together with a few of the English players while Malfoy sat alone and slightly apart.
Oddly, it sort of seemed to help. His focus was sharper and he managed to execute a very shaky catch, pushing them over the edge to an unconvincing win.
Benjy chuckled again. “I don’t know if it worked but it certainly helped.”
Harry clenched his jaw. He hadn’t heard those particular ones but it wasn’t as if he hadn’t thought it was a possibility. “I think if the Magpies are desperate enough for that, they shouldn’t be in the league.”
He felt for just a second that aching, bone-deep loneliness he’d felt for the first year after his breakup with Ginny, except this time it wasn’t her he was thinking about because she was right there in his arms. He felt like a bit of a creep watching Krum and Charlie as they obviously didn’t want anyone seeing them but his eyes kept glancing over in their direction.
Harry stared down at his outstretched hand and instinctively reached out to shake it before he could stop himself. “That sounds pretty fucking similar to gloating.”
and almost dropped his mug:
“I’ve missed you,” he said, without really meaning to, and her eyes widened. “Not like that! I just mean… I’ve missed being able to hang out with you.”
“Good morning, Mr Potter!” she purred. Her long fingernails were painted shiny black, clicking alarmingly on the table.
“Oh, fuck off,” Harry groaned, covering his face. “I had no choice. Hermione just doesn’t take no for an answer.”
“So,” Harry began, with precisely no plan.
Harry laughed properly and patted Ron on the shoulder.
Harry had no polite reply to that so he just stomped over to his bed and lay down, glaring at the ceiling.
“It’s just…” Harry paused, trying to think of what to say. “On trips like this I always used to spend the evenings talking to Ginny, so now I’m just used to turning in early instead.”
Harry nodded and hung back until his teammates had disappeared inside.
“It’s more than that, though.” He rubbed a hand over his jaw, trying to take in Krum’s words. “We’re just too different.”
“Bugger off.” Harry put down his book and muttered a quick Nox, leaving the room lit by Malfoy's wand alone. He closed his eyes and tried to look like he was asleep.
Harry watched as he climbed to his feet, kicked his pyjama bottoms off his ankles and sauntered over to the fridge completely naked. Harry had never consciously checked out a bloke’s arse before, but now he watched Malfoy's as he bent to examine the drink options.
“Alright, come here.” Malfoy batted his hand away and pushed Harry back onto his heels so he could take him back into his mouth.
“Great,” Baxter pulled out his headphones, not bothering to hide his annoyance at having his staring off into space-time interrupted. “What kind of phone do you currently have?”
Harry groaned and tugged the pillow over his head. “Oh, god, I’m going to sleep now.”
“It was good.” He paused. “I told Ginny about us.”
“Are you quite alright?” Malfoy cocked his head.
The car slowed and then came to a stop in front of a pair of wooden gates. They were greeted by the most well-dressed house-elf Harry had ever encountered. She stood at the gate in a dress made of some kind of tartan fabric and an apron. She looked about as old as Kreacher, but she’d obviously lived a happier life because her eyes were bright and clear and she stood up straight.
Malfoy made a noise of agreement. “I read a book once that said that it’s because the magic that was practised here for thousands of years is so different from ours, much more ingrained in the earth. It’s almost like it’s seeped into the ground. Can you feel it?”
Malfoy let out a surprised snort of laughter, which made Harry laugh, their shoulders bumping together as they sniggered like schoolboys.
“I don’t think I’ve ever seen a house-elf kid before,” Harry observed, shoving in another spoonful of porridge.
“I suppose. Just one,” Malfoy replied, voice warm and soft in that way it only ever was over the phone with miles and miles between them.
“I was just going to the showers, actually,” he replied, feeling hot and off-kilter under Malfoy’s gaze.
“Did you hear what I said?” he asked impatiently, trying to regain some semblance of control over the situation.
He nodded, giving her what he hoped was a reassuring smile and then motioned for her to accompany him to a quieter part of the bar. With some distance between him and Malfoy he felt like he could breathe a bit better.
“Look, what I was going to say is that I’m sorry about hitting you.” He paused. “Even though you did actually ask me to do it.”
“Yes. I thought it would be a good idea.”
“You know I’m a Seeker, right?” he tried to say but the photographer didn’t seem to be listening.
He hovered for another second before Angelina rolled her eyes and tugged him down onto the seat next to her. He spared another anxious glance towards Ginny but she seemed perfectly comfortable so he turned his focus back to the empty plate in front of him.
He pulled out his phone and typed out a message quickly.
Malfoy looked a little strange then - nervous, perhaps. “If it were to happen again, I mean.”
Harry’s brain, which was quite preoccupied with other matters, took about twice as long as it should to process what that sound meant, which was why when Ron and Hermione stepped through he was still letting Draco grope his arse.
That got Harry’s attention. He rolled out of the bed, his head and stomach protesting vehemently, and began the process of trying to find his things. Luckily for him Malfoy had already packed so he was able to locate his glasses, then his shoes and shirt without too much hassle.
Harry ducked out of the situation and went to find a drink.
“Don’t say that, Harry. This is just a blip - you’ll be back together before you know it. You just have to make an effort.” Hermione patted his arm.
He was even more furious when he realised that the antics had given the Snitch time to vanish again.
Harry folded his arms and sat back in his chair.
“Or not,” Draco turned to look at him finally, and Harry felt a sudden chill. Draco didn’t look angry or upset, just perfectly blank and cold.
For most of the competition, they hardly had time to do more than make eye contact across a pitch or when passing in a corridor, but during the third week both teams somehow ended up with the entire weekend free. The British and Irish players were itching for a night out and Malfoy was recruited to organise one for them, a role he seemed to take great pleasure in.
He grabbed two glasses and made his way back to where Harry was sitting up against the foot of the bed, sprawling back down next to him with a huff.
“I do not,” Harry replied indignantly. “I just like my alone time. Is that a crime?”
“Fucking hell, I’m close - just a tiny bit tighter and…” Malfoy’s body tensed below him and Harry pulled away just in time to see his face and feel the way he shuddered as he came. Harry stroked him through it.
“Oh, stop, George. You’re embarrassing them,” Angelina chastised as she wrapped Harry in a hug. “Hello love.”
“Cheers,” he said, giving her a pained smile. He winced when she whacked him on the shoulder.
“Remember what I say: to win is not most important thing.” Krum gave him one knowing look and stomped off to the changing rooms.
“Not until you admit that you’re jealous of Cami,” Malfoy was fully smirking now and it made Harry furious and turned on all at once so instead of doing the mature thing and walking away he stepped forward and shoved Malfoy with all his might. Unfortunately, Malfoy must have been expecting that because he captured Harry’s wrists and held them tightly. “Just say you were jealous and I’ll let you go,” he teased.
“Yeah,” Harry sighed, dropping his head back onto Draco’s chest. “I just can’t believe that Krum was right.”
He definitely should have left when he walked into the room and found Rita Skeeter smiling broadly back at him.
With his free hand, Malfoy put his index finger under Harry’s chin and pushed it gently until Harry looked him in the eye, and then pulled him into a kiss.
“They’re bloody everywhere these days, it’s disgusting,” She'd muttered. When Harry had asked her who she was talking about she just sniffed, looking pointedly at the men down her long nose, and Harry had put two and two together.
Ron cleared his throat. “Look, mate, you know we just want both of you to be happy. But this just all seems so out of the blue. Is this still about the World Cup?”

About an hour in, Malfoy disappeared and didn’t reappear. Harry wondered vaguely if he should go make sure he hadn’t been kidnapped by a kangaroo or something but he was soon distracted by Wood balancing a shot glass on his forehead.
For his own part, Harry realised that he was still gripping Malfoy’s dick like a moron and decided he’d better reciprocate. He moved his hand tentatively and was rewarded with a moan against his lips. It gave him the confidence to keep going, gripping Malfoy tightly the way he liked it, using Malfoy’s spit like lube.
The whole article was infuriating. Malfoy was clearly trying to charm the pants off the reporter, and annoyingly it seemed to have worked. It didn’t even sound like him, except for that part about Harry - that was pure, vintage Malfoy nastiness. Harry pushed the magazine away from him in disgust.
“I thought you were supposed to get married and pop out 42 little ginger children,” Malfoy said and Harry could tell he was curious, the nosey bastard.
Harry turned and looked at her, feeling a pang in his chest. “Of course not. Maybe easier, but not better.”
Harry nodded. He’d heard that during one of Davies’ more manic team talks. He and Oliver had been fierce competitors during school, but they’d also been friends, which only seemed to make Davies more paranoid about the prospect of playing against him in the World Cup as he knew they were equally matched in their passion for winning.
“Potter, a word?”
“I was hoping you were going to say you hexed the git,” Ron grumbled. “Although it’s probably good you didn’t or you might’ve been banned from playing today!” His face brightened at this, and he gave Harry a hearty slap on the shoulder.
England’s first game took place against Norway on the third day of the competition. Thankfully, Scotland and England were in different brackets so they wouldn’t be playing each other until the final - or at all, if things didn’t go their way.
“Well, yes, but that’s different.”
Malfoy laughed quietly. He hadn’t moved from where his lips were almost pressed up to Harry’s ear. Harry swore he felt him more than heard him. “Please what?”
“Because you’re drunk, and you don’t know what you’re doing.”
Parvati fixed him with a sharp look. “Do you want to be the face of the league or not?”
Ron sent Hermione a look of such raw, unadulterated love that Harry had to look away. “Thanks, mate.” He cleared his throat. “And, erm, we’re very happy for you too, about… you know.” He looked deeply uncomfortable.
“What’s so funny?” he asked.
“Is it always like that? With guys?” Harry asked finally.
“Aw, how sweet,” Malfoy cooed, a muscle in his jaw twitching.
“Merlin, Potter, you look terrible,” Angelina said happily.
The first picture was of an older woman, probably in her sixties, on a broom with a tiny blond child perched in front of her. As he watched, the woman did a loop-the-loop, holding the boy tightly, making his face break into an enormous grin. The brass plate on the bottom of the picture said: Aunty Delila and Draco - first time on a broom.
“It’s just that you’re there all by yourself, and half the rooms are locked off.” She looked at Ron desperately for backup.
“I almost lost my job because of you,” he said quietly, with a laugh, reaching out to brush Draco’s hair from his forehead. Knowing that Draco couldn’t hear him made him brave. “It was worth it, though. I couldn’t watch you fall like that and not do anything.” He watched Draco’s chest rise and fall, tracing over the ridges of his face with his thumb, smoothing his eyebrows. “I think I might have given us away, though. Pansy was looking at me like I’d snogged you in the middle of the field.”
It was a long room with a low, curved stone ceiling - not low enough that Harry had to worry about bumping his head, but it definitely wasn’t designed for human use. Una was leaning over a pot on an enormous wood-burning stove set back in a stone alcove which took up an entire wall, with copper pots and pans hanging above it. At her feet was what looked, at first glance, like a ball of limbs.
They headed back towards the chaos of the house. In the front yard, Bill, Charlie, George and Angelina were entertaining Teddy and Victoire Weasley with a Quaffle while Percy watched. As Harry and Ginny walked past, Charlie called out to them: “Come and show us how it’s done, number seven!”
Malfoy opened his mouth and closed it again. His eyes narrowed. “What is this about, Potter? Why are you being all weird all of a sudden?”
At the mention of Ginny’s name Harry felt a familiar lurch in his stomach but he swallowed it down and flew back and forth across the pitch, halfheartedly practising feints and manoeuvre until Davies called time.
“I’m so sorry we’re late,” she said, looking more than a little flustered.
“Shut up,” Harry laughed, stepping into the room and pushing the door shut behind him.
The team flew down and landed on the grass. Somehow O'Flaherty had got Ritchie Coote in a headlock mid-air and they both fell off their brooms into a heap, laughing uproariously. They made an odd pair: she was a sturdy, good-natured Hufflepuff, and he was a scrawny, quiet Griffindor, but they’d made fast friends and in the year since Coote was recruited had become notorious for their antics. They played well together. She had power, he had accuracy, and together they were responsible for one of the lowest Bludger injury rates in the team’s history.
David didn’t miss his word choice. “What about mentally?”
Now that it was full of people, it finally felt like a real Quidditch school, rather than just the idea of one. Draco had based much of the design on old photos he’d found of the original school, and he had never been more proud of anything in his entire life. Part of him wished desperately that Aunt Delila could have been there to see it and to meet Harry. He felt deep in his bones that she would have loved both.

He clenched his fist under the table.
“I take back what I said about you being less of a git off the pitch,” Harry grumbled.
“What, Charlie Weasley?” Harry asked incredulously.
“There’s no one. You’re insane.” Harry took a sip of tea to disguise his lying. “Did you come here to bully me or teach me how to use it?”
“Mr Malfoy, why should the public trust a former Death Eater to look after their children?”
“Um,” Harry felt very out of his depth. “None?”
“Let me help with that,” Harry said quickly, dashing over and taking some of the weight.
Malfoy walked towards him, making Harry back up nervously until he was pressed against the wall and Malfoy was very much in his personal space.
He didn’t think about Malfoy at all for the next hour, until he went for a slash. As he was walking down the corridor towards the bathroom, he saw Malfoy and a brown-haired man he didn’t recognise talking closely in a little alcove. For a moment he thought that they were having an argument, but then Malfoy said something and the man laughed and leant in a tiny bit closer.
” he called, stepping into the fireplace.
The Portkey delivered them to a small stone building on the mainland, which was good because it was absolutely bucketing down outside. To Harry's astonishment, there was a large dark green vintage-looking car in the little building with them. It looked like the pictures that Mr Weasley had shown him of a Roadster from the 1920s with it’s long bonnet and big, round headlights.
“Of course I can.” She waved off his outrage. “So, what? You’re into blokes, then?”
She stuck her tongue out at him. “She’s just so... powerful,” she said dreamily.
Malfoy must have noticed because after a moment he pulled Harry back up to kiss him. Harry’s pride was saved by the fact that Malfoy was obviously getting close, if the pink on his cheeks and the heaving of his chest was anything to go by.
He found Draco in the recently cleaned sitting room, inspecting a bookshelf that, if Harry was honest, he’d never looked at. Harry glanced self-consciously around the room. It had certainly improved in the past few months but there was still a yellow tinge to the curtains and a musty smell that he was sure wouldn’t go unnoticed.
“I’m not afraid of criticism. I’m just doing my best to focus on the game,” he said through gritted teeth.
She kept smiling but a vein had begun to protrude unattractively on her forehead. “Very amusing, Mr Potter, but you have made no secret of the animosity between you and your old school chum.”
He raised his hand and knocked, a little more forcefully than he had intended, and then almost fell face-first into Malfoy when he opened the door.
Harry was slightly taken aback by the seriousness of the question. He did feel protective of Draco - he would do anything to protect him - but he knew that wasn’t exactly what Ron was asking. “I’m in love with him, if that’s what you mean,” Harry replied, and then swallowed. There it was.
“Can I…” Draco said at the same time as Harry said, “Do you want to…”
“I’m going to actually kill you,” Harry laughed, half angry and half bewildered.
“So we shouldn’t do this again,” Harry reasoned.
“Yes, I can see that. Getting a head start, are we?”
With the key safely in his hand he made his way back to the old room, steeling himself for the inevitable awkward conversation. He pushed the door open gingerly, half hoping that Malfoy would have left, but there he was lying on his bed on top of the covers. At the sound of the door opening his head snapped up and he regarded Harry warily.
“Alright, you two, enough with the domestics. Where do you need us, Harry?” Angelina asked, rubbing her hands together.
Ginny snorted. “Ah, yes, the eternal crisis of the bisexual mind. I know it well.”
“If anyone has any questions about the actual Quidditch School, now would be the time to jump in,” he said, once he’d calmed down a bit, trying to avoid looking at Harry, whose shoulders were still shaking a little, for fear that it would set him off again.
“Actually, you’re the one who’s calling me,” he pointed out, trying not to sound breathless.
“If you say so." From the sounds of it, Malfoy was taking his pants off and Harry had to force himself to keep his eyes shut. “Merlin, you're strange.”
“I guess it just doesn’t seem worth the hassle.” He was shocked by his own honesty. “I’ve sort of got a pact with myself.”
Harry was actually feeling rather charitable. He decided that he would go up to Malfoy first and shake his hand at the start of the match. He would no doubt have some pre-match nerves, coming back to Britain after so many years, and it would be good of Harry to welcome him to the league. Yes, Harry thought with some satisfaction, that would be the mature thing to do.
“You can tell me, I promise it won’t be weird. Unless it’s Luna.” She paused, teacup halfway to her lips. “It’s not Luna, right?”
Harry sighed and leaned back in his chair. “Not particularly,” he grumbled, but she ignored him, pulling a piece of paper out of the stack with a triumphant noise.
. Harry pulled out his own wand, and again they stood there staring at each other daring the other to cast the first spell. Suddenly Malfoy lunged forward, causing Harry to step on the back of his own robe and fall sharply on his bum. He tried to scoot back to get away but his back collided with the sinks and Malfoy advanced on him.
Hermione had instructed him to meet Beth at a little cafe on Diagon Alley at seven, but Harry had spent so much time trying to make his jacket look less rumpled that he arrived at one minute past, feeling extremely frazzled.
“Is that what you want?” Harry asked, holding his breath a tiny bit.
He felt it twitch slightly in his hand.
Because there was no way that he was attracted to Malfoy. He was pointy and mean, and his hair looked stupid and overdone all the time. Not to mention the fact that he was a man, which was a whole other kettle of fish that Harry didn’t want to begin to look into.
Harry sat back down slowly and watched in anxious silence as Draco drank the potion.
Harry sent Ron a silent plea for help, and he grimaced back sympathetically. “Harry, mate, I would love to back you up on this but honestly I think you’ve buggered it up a bit.”
Draco looked back at him blankly. “For what?”
“No, me neither,” he replied.
He didn’t hold it against her but it also didn’t help their already fracturing relationship. He never ended up moving back into their flat, he’d gone straight from Ron and Hermione’s spare room to Grimmauld Place.
Harry felt a lump rise up in his throat but tried to smile back at him. “That’s great. That’s really great, mate. I’m happy for you. Not sure I believe you, but I’m happy for you.”
“Unfortunately.” Harry sat down heavily at the table, dropping his head into his hands.
“Good morning, Pansy. Lovely to see you as always,” Harry said brightly, before hugging Parvati tightly. Draco allowed Parvati to pull him in for a hug with only a tiny bit of resistance once Harry had let her go.
“Yes,” Malfoy said quietly, still not looking at him. “But I still don’t know what you want from me. Do you want an apology or to apologize?”
“Fucking hell!”
“Did you and Malfoy break up?” Hermione asked gently over coffee on the morning of the fourth day.
The truth was, Harry didn’t really know. In the bar, with the help of beer, his logic for coming up and confronting Malfoy had felt foolproof. Now everything felt dreamlike and uncertain.
“Oh...erm...yeah I did go but we heard Filch coming so we didn’t get to have a proper fight,” It wasn’t
It was three weeks before he had a day off and he expected to spend it on the sofa, but when he woke up he found himself filled with the inexplicable urge to go for a walk. Perhaps it was a hangover from spending the past few weeks constantly surrounded by people, but Grimmauld Place felt vast and empty for the first time in years. It felt almost lonely, Harry realised. Shaking off that train of thought, he put some shoes on and headed out into the winter morning.
He could feel Draco’s dick trapped between their bodies, sliding on the lube and precome on their stomachs. It couldn’t be satisfying, though Draco didn’t seem to be complaining, holding Harry to him with his arms and legs.
“My heart breaks for you,” Harry said, rolling his eyes.
“No. I mean, yes, but it’s not important,” he stammered.
Malfoy was really smiling now, and Harry couldn’t help himself. He reached for him again, and this time there was no pause. Malfoy was on him the moment their lips met.
The worst part about losing, though, was that he was inevitably reminded of the 2002 Cup.
Draco seemed to relax a bit but he didn’t let go of Harry’s arm. “I hate being by myself when I’m sick. I used to make my nanny sleep in my room whenever I got a cold.”
“Could you be a little bit louder please?” he mumbled spitefully and was gratified to hear Malfoy jump so hard he dropped his wand with a clatter.
Harry turned his head to see Malfoy lying on his bed with his pants still on but his shirt completely unbuttoned, staring at the ceiling. His brain raced. Did that mean…? Was he saying…?
“Yeah, you too. You had such a good game in Melbourne.” Harry wracked his brain for anything helpful to say, but she was beaming so it didn’t seem to matter.
“I’ll just…” He motioned towards his shirt but didn’t move. They stood there staring at each other. He was very, very aware of the love bite on his shoulder.
Just then Mrs Weasley came out to announce the last call for seconds on the pudding and Benjy leapt to his feet. “Forgive me but one of the greatest perks of retirement is being able to eat as much dessert as I like, so I’ll have to leave you, but Harry? I hope you take on board what I said.” He pulled Harry into another firm hug. “If you need anything at all don’t hesitate to owl,” he said seriously, squeezing Harry’s shoulder, and then he was gone.
“Shut up,” Harry laughed in spite of himself. “I probably won’t be dating another ginger for a while to be honest. Ron said I should try blondes.” Malfoy coughed and when Harry looked over his eyebrows were raised. Harry flushed, realising belatedly what he had said. “I didn’t mean…”
“I think I need to sit down,” he mumbled and all but collapsed onto the sofa. Harry escaped to the kitchen and when he returned with a glass of water, Ron was looking a little bit better, and he accepted the water gratefully.
“Good morning, sunshine,” said a voice that was far too loud. Harry groaned, and then froze.
Almost all Seekers fall into one of two categories, Benjy Williams had told Harry on his first day after being signed with Puddlemere. There are hawks, like Harry and Benjy, powerful players who tend to either stay away from the action or barrel through when they need to. Then you have your falcons - usually smaller, but not always. They’re less powerful but a bit faster and fucking sneaky. They’ll fly rings around the Beaters and they’re usually the ones playing up for the crowd.
“Are you lost?”
Like Bill and Fleur so many years before, Ron and Hermione opted to have their wedding at the Burrow, but theirs was quite a different affair. Harry had been (against his will) roped into a lot of the planning so he had the odd experience of knowing almost everything that was going to happen throughout the day.
Harry felt his neck grow hot. “Of course not.”
. He had no choice he supposed.
“You never know, you might make a new friend,” Wood winked at him and then moved on to mediate a dispute between Angelina and Ginny.
“I wanted to ask… When you said to me at the hospital that Draco’s not as tough as he looks, what did you mean by that?”
Barely a minute passed before another message came through.
“Oh, um, it doesn’t matter really.” She looked a bit red. “You know, it’s been so nice playing with you the past few weeks.”
Harry’s entire body blushed. That word would be so cheesy from anyone else, but it sounded both intimate and filthy in Malfoy’s - Draco’s mouth. Speaking of which - his lips looked red, wet and obscene.
Malfoy laughed again, but it sounded sadder now. “That’s one way of putting it. We can’t all be national treasures.”
It took them about twice as long as it should have to get back because they were both too far gone to Apparate without splinching themselves, and they kept stopping every few feet to feel each other up.
The hallway outside his door was wide with a grey stone floor, he followed it back the way they had come up and found that past the stairs there was a long gallery which stretched the entire length of that side of the keep.
“Alright,” Malfoy started, standing next to Harry so he could follow him exactly. “Usually you would be flying at quite high speed doing this, but we’ll start stationary.”
“Yeah, sorry, mate. The perils of having a four-year-old.” Weasley slapped Harry on the back and then gave Draco a firm handshake. “Good to see you, Malfoy,” he said gruffly.
Harry was drunk. He hadn’t intended to be but the drinks were free and he was miserable, which was always a recipe for disaster.
“Poor guy,” Ron said, looking less concerned. He grinned wickedly. “I’ve heard the Magpies reserve Seeker is bloody awful.”
She gave him a knowing smile. “I’d like to recommend at least two weeks of rest.” She held up a hand at Draco’s protests. “That's the absolute minimum. I would prefer to make it six weeks but I realise that that may not be realistic.”
Harry sat up a little too quickly and got a headrush. The Magpies had a game against the Wimbourne Wasps later that night but Harry hadn’t been expecting a text from him as they’d seen each other just the weekend before. He typed out a quick text back:
Well, he couldn’t very well claim to care about Draco the way he did and still think that, could he?
Draco appeared next to him, a broom in each hand. “If you’ve finished having a moment.” He pushed one of them into Harry’s hand. When Harry looked down at it, he couldn’t help but laugh.
Harry took a deep breath. He wasn’t sure if this was the best way of going about it but he was out of good options. He had to know what was going on.
“I’m so happy for both of you,” Harry said.
Harry pulled her into a side hug to hide the mistiness in his eyes. He had a sudden overwhelming urge to tell her everything about the trip, and about Malfoy. She would know what to say, he was sure of it, but he just couldn’t get the words out.
Once they got inside Malfoy pulled the door shut behind him but didn’t move anywhere, trapping them in the entryway.
The headline was simple: “
Malfoy gestured lazily to the parchment in Harry's hand. “Keep it or don’t - I don’t really care.”
He took a thoughtful sip of coffee and then swore when it scorched his tongue.
Malfoy was standing with his teammates at the other end of the pitch, broom in hand, wearing the new black and dark grey Magpie robes. Harry’s navy blue gear suddenly felt bright and garish. Malfoy was off to the side a little from the rest of the team, tightening the straps on his wrist guards primly and Harry's stomach gave a lurch as he turned and they made eye contact for the first time in six years. He didn't register his feet carrying him over until Malfoy was within arm's reach.
“Harry Potter!” Harry winced, glancing around for a place to hide but before he could he felt a hand on his arm. He plastered on a smile and turned to see Mrs Patil.
Chanel gave them a spiel about Sydney and Australia that Harry barely heard. He kept shooting glances at Ginny who was leaning against the wall opposite him. She looked good, relaxed as always, and well-rested. She still wore her hair long but today it was up in a ponytail, with a few loose strands that had escaped around her ears. She noticed him looking after a second and glanced up to give him a soft smile.
He felt his face flush, and he rubbed his hand through the back of his hair, embarrassed. “For fuck sake, I’m sorry alright? I shouldn’t have made such a big deal out of walking in on you with that guy, it was none of my business. Are you happy?”
“Well, this is nice.”
“That’s not it,” Harry cut him off. If he was honest with himself, that was a decent part of it, but right now he was happy to delay that particular freakout until later.
When his stomach was finally empty, he quickly banished the vomit with a flick of his wand and turned to face her, trying his best not to look like he was about to pass out.
Unable to keep reading, Harry slowly closed the magazine and took a few deep breaths. It was a puff piece, that was for sure. Harry hadn’t expected any less from that publication, but the thing that struck him the most was the casual reference to the war as if it had been a piece of bad publicity. That was just offensive on every level.
He could almost feel Draco rolling his eyes at that.
“If you’re going to ogle me, you could at least close the door.”
Pansy rolled her eyes again. “You’re not listening, Potter. What I’m saying is he’s more fragile than you think and you need to be careful with him.”
“Have you taken your pain potion?” Harry asked gently, choosing to ignore Draco’s sniping.
“You’re not really going to duel him are you Harry?” Hermione sounded a bit panicked as Harry relayed the notes to her and Ron.
“Stop doing that, I just came over to get it back,” Harry snapped, trying to snatch it from Malfoy’s hands.
“It’s your own fault for not bringing your broom. You’ll note how generous I’m being by using a Firebolt 1994.” He pushed off effortlessly and hovered lazily a few meters above Harry’s head.
“Camille? With one of her many suitors, I expect. Why?” Malfoy raised his eyebrows.
“What do you want then?” Malfoy asked, voice low, and it set something off inside Harry.
“No,” Harry had to give him that. However, the idea of it happening again, or turning into something else, seemed less like a recipe for disaster and more like a large sign pointing directly at a cake that read ‘eat for guaranteed catastrophe.’ “It’s a terrible idea.”
At first glance he thought that he was looking at a gallery of landscapes but when he looked again he realised that they were all Quidditch scenes. He stepped closer to inspect the first one and was thrilled to see the Hogwarts Quidditch pitch and the tiny players zipping around in the old-school Ravenclaw and Gryffindor Quidditch uniforms.
There was a short pause, and then he heard Malfoy exhale. “Goodnight, Potter.”
next to the till, featuring cover star Draco Malfoy. At first glance, Harry thought that Malfoy was naked, and he did a double-take. Upon closer inspection, Harry saw it wasn’t completely full frontal but it might as well have been. The only thing protecting his modesty was the silver British and Irish League Cup he held in front of his crotch. As Harry watched, Malfoy pretended to drop the cup but caught it just in time and then winked into the camera.
His thumb only hesitated for a moment over the send button before pressing it.
“Potter drinks for free,” Wood announced, to whoops from the team. “If I see him paying for anything tonight, you’ll all be up at six for drills tomorrow morning.”
“So you’re still together?”
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Malfoy asked, looking a bit miffed.
Without waiting for a response he turned and stalked out of the room, leaving Harry alone to try to work out what had gone so wrong.
Malfoy narrowed his eyes slightly and seemed to pull himself up to his full height. “I came to see you.”
Considering the fact that most of Harry’s life revolved around Quidditch, it would be reasonable to assume that he would be sick of it. Yet, as he watched one of the Cannons Chasers score an uncharacteristically impressive goal, he thought there was possibly no place he’d rather be. The only thing that would improve it was a drink, he mused as he watched Ron practically chug his beer, but he wasn’t willing to risk the wrath of his captain if he was found out. Ron had actually played two seasons as a reserve keeper for the Wimbourne Wasps when they had first left school, but he’d taken a nasty tumble during a game against Tutshill and had left the team soon afterwards to work as a trainer for the English National Team for the World Cup. When the World Cup ended he was hired by Puddlemere and quickly worked his way up to where he was now. In Harry’s, completely unbiased, opinion it was only a matter of time before Ron was coaching the team. His long talks could be a pain in the arse but his vast knowledge of Quidditch made him an incredibly great trainer.
“What if we don’t get back together?”
“Alright what?” Harry’s brow furrowed.
“Thanks,” Malfoy replied dryly.
“Is it that obvious?” he mouthed back to her. She gave him a sympathetic shrug.
“Now this I have to see,” Malfoy sneered.
"Well…” She looked vaguely amused. “For starters, he’s currently feeling up an extremely handsome Australian man.”
“Oh, Harry, aren’t you his roommate?” Angelina asked, not unkindly. She patted him on the back.
“Yes, Potter. Fragile, delicate, whatever you want to call it. You have the capacity to hurt him very deeply because for some reason you are a weak spot for him. Now that you’re aware of it, I trust you will use your Gryffindor honour to prevent that from happening.” Harry was about to say something else but she got to her feet. “I’m afraid that is all the time I have. Please consider what I’ve said carefully.”
“Oh, shut up,” Harry huffed. “If you just called to make fun of me, I’m hanging up.” It was an empty threat but Malfoy didn’t need to know that.
As soon as Harry walked in, Ginny waved at him to join them but he just gave her a smile and walked over to Malfoy, sliding in to sit across from him. Malfoy looked up, not bothering to hide his astonishment.
She threw herself back onto the seat next to him and gave him a wide smile. “How’re you feeling?” Harry shrugged helplessly, and she shook her head at him. “Do you want to go for a walk?”
“Hi,” Harry replied, draping his now free arm around Draco’s shoulders. “What’re you doing?”
He could feel every inch of Draco’s body against his, shivering and straining. His mouth was pressed up against Harry’s ear, whimpering and babbling into it.
Wood gave him a grim smile. “Yes.”
Frustrated, Harry rolled the paper up and tossed it at the already overflowing waste paper basket in the corner.  He didn’t know what to feel. He’d followed Malfoy’s career enough to know that he played for a provincial team in France, but that was about it. After the war Lucius Malfoy had been sent to Azkaban but Mrs Malfoy and Draco had escaped prison, in no small part due to Harry’s testimony on her behalf. They’d been stripped of their house and lands though and so they had left the country and, as far as Harry knew, hadn’t returned.
“Yes, Potter.”
“Oh, erm, cheers.” He swallowed as she rubbed the seam on the inside of his jeans.
“It just seems weird, don’t you think?” Harry wished he could just shut up but the words were spilling out of their own accord.
He stumbled a bit now that his jeans were shackling his legs together, but Malfoy caught him before he could fall and turned them again. This time, Harry didn’t have the strength to object to being held against the wall - he was too busy paying attention to Malfoy’s hands playing with the elastic of his pants.
Harry laughed and shook his head ruefully, moving on to study a large scene from the final moments of the 1974 World Cup.
Harry tried to take a deep breath. “I know I haven’t been very… available recently.”
Harry and Malfoy kept their word: they didn’t see each other again, but that didn’t stopped them calling one another every once in a while. Harry knew it wasn’t a good idea, if anything was going to distract him from playing it would be Malfoy, but when he was all alone in a hotel room in a foreign country it was pretty difficult to resist the call of the little silver phone.
Harry was shaking his head before she even finished. “Sorry, I just don’t think it’s a good idea.” Hermione and Ron shared a concerned look, which annoyed Harry even more. “Don’t look at me like that.”
“I disappear? You practically threw me into the fireplace when Weasley and Granger walked in on us.” Draco gestured between them, a little wildly.
Malfoy looked good, too, controlling his broom effortlessly as he flew, eyes bright and mischievous. Harry loved to just watch as he swooped and looped, entertaining the crowd, winding them up. He was beautiful like this, basking in the attention. Even the boos - of which there were quite a few - seemed to energise him. Harry felt breathless and it took all of his energy not to laugh with him, to maintain the stern, disapproving character he knew he was playing.
Malfoy took a deep breath, and then that voice was back. “Since you asked so nicely.” He cleared his throat. “I’m wearing a pair of black boxer briefs.”
The rest of the interview continued in this fashion: Skeeter asked inappropriate and insensitive questions and Harry refused to answer. By the end of it, he was almost shaking with anger.
Harry came over and looked over his shoulder. “
“I certainly do,” Malfoy laughed, plopping down on his bed.
The launch of the British and Irish Cup 2005 was an extravagant affair. As usual, it was hosted by the Minister of the Department of Magical Games and Sports, Marvin Boulcott and took place in the event hall of the Ministry, a high-ceilinged, marble-floored room with enormous curtains covering every wall. His first year there, Harry had made the mistake of looking behind one of the curtains only to discover that the walls were covered in the most hideous, vocal portraits of what had to be every former Minister of every department since the beginning of time.
“Right.” Harry couldn’t think of anything else to say to that.
“Fuck off,” Harry laughed, shoving him lightly. “Forget it.”
“To answer your question, house-elves are usually very secretive about their offspring. Many pure-blood families aren’t keen to have children running around, as you can imagine. But my aunt had… a different attitude about it.” Draco smiled at him innocently.
Thank you to
“But you’re so much fun to wind up,” Malfoy’s voice was too low for the audience to hear and it made the hair on the back of Harry’s neck stand up. “Besides, it’s not as though you’ve been shy about sharing your opinions either. Lovely picture of you in the
He shrugged noncommittally and then watched in alarm as she reached into a drawer and handed him a glossy magazine.
The morning of the game against the Magpies was overcast and a bit grim - perfect conditions for a great game, in Harry’s opinion. The commentators had projected an easy win for Puddlemere, and while Harry didn’t want to count his chickens, he felt relatively confident in his abilities. Put it this way: he’d never lost to Malfoy before.
Wood, who had been listening intently, gave the team a stern look. “No embarrassing me in front of the Australians, okay?”
He didn’t move, just kept his hand there, gripping Harry and kissing him deeply. Harry felt undone. Desperate for some semblance of control, he scrambled at the front of Malfoy’s pyjama pants. With his free hand, Malfoy grabbed Harry’s and brought it up to his mouth, sucking Harry’s index and middle fingers into his mouth. Harry wondered vaguely if it would be possible to die from pure lust.
Harry wasn’t sure why anyone would want to put him on the cover of a magazine considering he was perhaps the least photogenic person that had ever lived. Surely by now everyone in the wizarding world was aware of that fact?
Malfoy pointed an accusatory fork at Harry. “I don’t know what game you’re playing, but I'm putting a stop to it. I don’t need you to be nice to me to soothe your wounded conscience.”
“You’re hot,” Draco countered, his face so soft and fond that Harry had to forcibly stop himself from touching him.
Just as Harry was about to make a comment about making sure not to mess Draco’s hair up, he spotted it.
Harry liked being a hawk. He thought there was a certain honour in staying out of the fray. He didn’t participate much in the tradition of verbal sparring with the opposing Seeker or try to get too underhanded with his tactics. He preferred to let his play speak for itself. Since the 2002 World Cup, he’d worked a lot on his strength and he wasn’t afraid to take a hit or two, but he tried to play a clean game. That was something Benjy had taught him too.
“It’s a disturbing artifact,” Harry said. “And I thought you said you were going to ruin me?”
Once Harry had selected an outfit and had it approved by Draco, they headed down to the entrance hall, a moderately sized room with a large fireplace at one end for receiving visitors. They were expecting a number of their close friends and family through here for a small morning tea and tour, before the arrival of the press and officials.
“Well that’s good because I also…what I mean to say is, I feel the same way.” Draco managed, still looking dazed.
After crashing into a side table and almost going into the wrong room, they managed to make it to Harry’s door.
“He’s secretive about his feelings?” Hermione asked incredulously, “You’re so secretive about yours you’ve kept them from yourself.”
“Yes, I have,” he insisted.
The front page of the paper read:
“That’s a double negative,” Malfoy replied testily.
“I thought that we could go for a fly up the loch a little, there’s a gorgeous view from the top of the…” Draco trailed off as he entered the room fully and saw Harry’s face. “What’s wrong?”
Taking one glance over his shoulder, he pulled the cloak tighter around his shoulders and pushed the door open slightly, peering inside. The tiled hallway which led to the bathroom was empty so Harry slipped through the door, pulling it closed behind him with a soft
Harry smiled half-heartedly and looked down at the table. The past few weeks had been a nightmare in the press (not that he didn’t deserve it) and he’d been well and truly ripped a new one by Davies. All he wanted to do was crawl into bed and hide from the world but if he pulled out of the tour now, it would look like he was doing it because he lost the League Cup. He would not only look like a sore loser, but Malfoy would know that he had won. Even so, Harry couldn’t imagine being away from home for a month. The idea made his heart race and stomach clench.
Fantastic, Harry thought tiredly. The trip had hardly begun and he was already exhausted.
Draco grimaced. “We’re talking right now.”
Harry didn’t have a response to this, so he looked around the room for something to comment on. “Your room’s smaller than mine usually is.”
He sent her a grateful look and downed it in one, grimacing at the bitter flavour. Angelina watched him with amusement, before turning back to her book. As he waited for the potion to take effect he studied her face for any sign that she’d seen or heard about any of the things he’d done the night before.
“Hello Viktor,” he mumbled into his beer. Krum didn’t wait to be invited and took the seat next to Harry, indicating to the bartender that he wanted one of what Harry was having.
The man in question was just across the table from Angelina and Harry, chatting to someone Harry recognised as the mediwizard for the opposing team. He was tall, broad-shouldered and tanned, with an easy smile. They were laughing now, and as Harry watched, Malfoy placed a hand on the other man’s shoulder, grinning up at him. Harry had a bitter taste in his mouth and had to force himself to look away, downing about half his drink in one go.
“Not really,” Angelina shrugged. “Considering he’s gay.”
In an effort to overcome his newly discovered prejudice Harry decided that he was going to make a conscious effort to be nice to Malfoy. It was very much a guilt-based decision, but he hoped it counted anyway. The trouble was, Malfoy did not make it easy.
“Oh, cool,” Harry replied, not sure how embarrassed he should be that he didn’t have a clue what she was talking about.
Harry realised what he’d said and ducked his head in embarrassment. “No, I mean… Harry… You can call me Harry,” he choked out.
“I don’t know,” he mumbled miserably.
Draco looked back at him, expressionless. The only thing that gave him away was the white of his knuckles where he clutched his banana. It was funny how Harry could read him like that now. A year ago he would have been pissed off to get that blank look from him.
Ten minutes later as she was holding the floo powder, she turned back to him. “We’re going to be at the Pickle and Pumpkin on Thursday at seven. I know you’re busy, but it would be lovely for everyone to see you.”
“Um,” Harry swallowed.
His brow furrowed. “I keep telling everyone - I’m fine.”
“It wasn’t your fault,” Harry said, furrowing his brow. This was not the conversation he had expected.
After exchanging some more hellos and thank yous, the two women left for their offices on the other side of the house to argue about arrangements for the press. Before Harry and Draco could even breathe a sigh of relief, the Floo went again.
Those words had stuck in him like a thorn, spurring him to take Puddlemere’s offer, public opinion be damned. As he looked out over the dark garden and the remnants of Ron and Hermione’s wedding in the moonlight he wondered how he could have forgotten them so easily.
They finally dragged themselves out of bed and down to the kitchen where Una had prepared breakfast for them, although the house-elf herself was nowhere to be seen. They ate quickly, bumping their feet together nervously under the table. Draco finished first and sipped his tea quietly as he watched Harry wolf down his food. Draco was filled with an overwhelming fondness for him — appalling table manners and all. Sitting at the kitchen table with him always reminded Draco of the first time Harry had come here. Draco had felt so unsettled by how well he fit in, how he filled this huge place with life and warmth with just his presence. It had been the first time that Draco had really felt that Lochinvar could be his home, and it had been utterly terrifying.
“...alright? And now off to your accommodation where you can settle! You will notice that it is a more Muggle friendly establishment than you’ll be used to in Britain. Our Statute of Secrecy decrees that we live alongside Muggles so we try to assimilate as much as possible.” Chanel began to direct them towards the exit.
He was smarting slightly when he got back to his room about an hour later to get changed before going to the aftermatch. It wasn’t that he expected a smile and a wave from Malfoy, but he could have at least returned the small gesture.
“But,” she began to protest but Mr Weasley was already dragging her away.
“Good mornings,” they droned in unison, before scampering out the backdoor.
He stopped just in front of Crabbe, who was swinging the camera around wildly by its strap.
It was the pressure from the World Cup, he told himself. It had nothing to do with Draco. Things with Draco— with Malfoy had gone the way they were supposed to, the way he’d always known they would.
“Oh, no, not at all,” Harry said, trying to hide his shock as best he could. “I just didn’t realise anyone was there.”
Oliver leapt up on a bench as they were packing their things and cleared his throat over the chatter. “Well done, team! I do have notes but they can wait until tomorrow. For now, I hear that we’re off to a Muggle bar, so I expect you all to behave yourselves.” A cheer went up amongst the group.
Draco nodded at Weasley and she gave him a wide grin. They weren’t yet bosom friends but she was important to Harry, and even he had to admit that she was difficult to hate.
Harry was still laughing as he began to walk down the tunnel towards the pitch. It wasn’t until he reached the green and saw the Scottish team assembling on the other side that he realised that he’d been successfully distracted. Ron was a lot sneakier than he let on.
He made his way from the press tent towards the English camp. The World Cup village was set up like a small city. It was warded to be invisible to anyone who wasn’t a player, staff or family, for privacy and safety. It was centralised around a collection of long tents which housed food, medical and press. Coming off this base were paths that lead to the sixteen camps of the countries that had qualified. To get to the English camp, Harry had to walk past Egypt, Germany, and the United States.
Hermione looked at him sadly. “How are the headaches?”
It was the sounds Harry would remember later with embarrassing clarity as he lay alone in bed. The sound of Draco’s breathing, the little gasps and sobs that Harry couldn’t quite believe he was responsible for. There were other things too: the softness of his skin contrasted with the hardness of the muscles and bones beneath, his woody, expensive scent, the way his chest and neck shone with sweat. But most of all, it was the sounds he made as Harry opened him up. He was - as always - in control of the situation, talking Harry through kindly but impatiently, and every now and then his voice would shudder and Harry felt it all the way to his toes. He thought he could come from that alone, just from watching him.
“If you’re not comfortable with the fact that it’s me…”
His brain was lagging a solid ten minutes behind the rest of his body, and only caught up with him when he found himself standing in front of Malfoy’s door. He hadn’t made a conscious decision to go there, but if he was completely honest with himself, it seemed inevitable.
“G’day, mate!” she yelled in his ear in the worst Australian accent he’d ever heard, grinning widely. He winced at the volume. “Well done on the game. You’re a fucking star.”
He opened one eye to see a very blurry Malfoy standing over him looking disgustingly awake. “Oh, god,” he moaned, closing his eyes again.
He looked around the garden in desperation and found Harry and Granger watching his predicament with amusement. He gave them a dark look, but before he could rope them to help him in he was practically swarmed by the rest of the Weasley offspring demanding a tour of the dormitories.
“He thought I was jealous of him for being able to pull.” Harry avoided Angelina’s eyes.
“Hello, Mr Malfoy. I’m going to do some final diagnostics and then we can see about getting you home.” The quill scribbled furiously as she waved her wand over him. When she was done, she examined the clipboard for a few moments, brow furrowed.
“Harry, please just consider it,” Parvati said desperately. “It’s been over a year since your last interview. The public needs to hear from you.”
by the way.”
“Erm, cheers, Luna,” he said with a smile, but Draco could tell he wasn’t sure what else to say.
“Awww Potter, are you worried we’ve damaged your new headshots?” He held up the camera and snapped a picture of Harry’s furious expression.
To be perfectly honest, he’d given himself a bit of a shock too. He didn't know where it had come from. He looked down at the Firewhiskey - perhaps he’d better slow down. “Sorry,” he said with a laugh.
“I knew it. You never could follow through…”
“How about this? You apologise first, and then if I feel like it I’ll think about apologising too,” Malfoy replied, and Harry opened his mouth indignantly before seeing Malfoy’s smirk and realising that he was being teased.
“Honestly, she drives me mad sometimes,” he griped but shot Harry a nervous smile. “She seems to think that the cake needs a fifth layer. I keep telling her that it’s too late but there’s no reasoning with her.”
Ron laughed too. “If he heard that speech I’m sure he’ll be waiting in your hotel room when you get back.”
The handwriting was so elegant and delicate that Harry had to look up for a second and catch Malfoy’s eye to confirm that it was actually his. He considered his answer carefully. Did he actually want to duel Malfoy for Colin bloody Creevey’s bloody camera? Not really, but there was something about Malfoy’s supercilious smile that made Harry want to one-up him more than anything in the world. He scrawled his answer on the back of the same scrap and, when Snape looked away again, sent it sailing over.
“Like Puddlemere’s star player abandoning the Snitch to be his evil rival’s knight in shining armour? Yes, exactly like that.” She sighed before continuing. “The second, as his friend, is: leave him alone.”
“Why?”
Malfoy turned his head, just slightly, to glance at Harry, the light from the room illuminating the sharp features on the right half of his face. “Alright,” he said expectantly.
He looked through the window and saw a pretty witch with long dark hair sitting looking back at him. Beth raised her hand cautiously and waved and he waved back, feeling idiotic. She looked like she was waiting before the firing squad.
He remembered that conversation like it was yesterday. It had been a few months after the end of the war. They’d been out here on the roof but it had been late afternoon in summer and they’d been drinking tea instead of whisky.
“I don’t know.” A pause. “It’s just not the right thing for either of us.”
She beamed at him and pulled him back into a hug. When they finally separated, Harry found that he was half scared to look at Ron, who hadn’t said anything yet.
“You’ve got to say what you want out loud and then tap your wand against the plate and it’ll appear straight from the kitchen,” Angelina instructed.
“You know, it’s not your career that will be over if Krum opens his enormous mouth.” Malfoy was shoving his things into his bag, his movements growing more agitated by the second.
Sleep was the worst casualty of the injury. He’d never been the greatest sleeper anyway, but since the World Cup he’d barely been able to lie down without his mind being swamped with bothersome thoughts. That was one of the reasons he was so grateful for Quidditch: it tired him out until he could safely fall into bed.
There was a lull in the conversation then and Harry turned his head to look at Malfoy again. He was looking back up at the sky and so Harry could only see him in profile but it was still fascinating to be this close to him and not trying to hex each other. The low light made his cheekbones look even more dramatic than usual, and Harry had the oddest urge to reach out and run a finger over the ridge of his nose and cheeks and feel the structure of the bone underneath. It looked so sharp that he wondered nonsensically if it would cut him. As he watched, Malfoy blinked slowly and his eyelashes were so long they almost brushed his eyebrows.
He gripped Harry tightly and surely, moving slowly but with a slight twist that made Harry shiver all the way down to his toes. It was so different to the way Harry would do it to himself. He wondered absently if this was how Malfoy liked it.
“We’re going for a dance,” she announced, gripping Malfoy’s hand in hers. Cormac looked like he wanted to get up to join them but Angelina held him firmly in his seat. Harry watched as Camille dragged Malfoy towards the packed dance floor. For the briefest second Malfoy glanced backwards but then he was engulfed in the mass of moving bodies.
writers had cooked up for him, much to the joy of his team’s management. He never thought he’d miss it.
“Your ears are all red, you absolute liar,” she laughed, pouring them both a cup of tea and sitting down across from him. “Spill, right now. Who is she?”
“So?” She waved her hand impatiently. “What happened?”
Harry clenched his jaw in frustration. “I get that, but I need to know.”
“Nosy,” Draco chided but he was smiling.
If he was being honest with himself, the sponsors weren’t the only reason he was hiding. He hadn’t spotted Malfoy yet, but something about seeing him in this context was freaking Harry right out. He was wound so tight that he almost jumped out of his skin when the man himself appeared at the entryway.
Draco looked very small and pale lying in the hospital bed at St Mungo's in his blue and white pyjamas. There was a bandage wrapped around his head, plastering his hair to his forehead and causing it to stick up at the back.
“Alright, thank you, Una,” Draco interrupted, sternly but not rudely. “That’s quite enough, I think.”
“No, no! I was hoping… I didn’t know.” They stood there for a few seconds, just grinning at each other like idiots.
“Negative publicity? You mean like…”
Malfoy just hit him again.
He felt Harry’s presence before he saw him, coming up behind him carrying two glasses of champagne.
Patil and Pansy had joined the rest of the party and seemed to be in the middle of a furious argument. Draco carefully avoided being roped in.
“You know I want to keep my love life private too, you dolt.”
Ron blinked at him. “Oh, bugger, I didn’t think of that.”
The first week back had been hard. He’d barely slept at all. His bed at Grimmauld Place had felt hot and uncomfortable, so he’d gone over to Hermione and Ron’s. They’d let him sleep in their spare room for four days before they asked him what was wrong.
“No.” Harry scrubbed a hand over his face. “We’ve been hooking up for a while, but it’s not like that.”
“What are you doing here?” Malfoy leaned a strong shoulder against the doorframe. He wasn’t wearing a shirt. Harry did his best not to notice. He was standing so close that Harry could have counted the flecks of silver in his eyes if he wanted. Which he didn’t.
“Nah you’re pulling my leg, you’re not Harry Potter.” The man shook his head, “You almost had me there.”
“Make World Cup feel like junior Quidditch trophy.”
So Malfoy had kissed him. Or had he kissed Malfoy? Harry’s brow furrowed as he tried to remember, it was just so fuzzy. He could definitely remember the other boy leaning forward, but he was almost certain he’d leant forward too. How inconvenient, it made the already confusing situation even more so because Harry couldn’t figure out whether he should feel embarrassed and worried or not. Regardless, he knew he wouldn’t tell anyone; for starters, it would just be too hard to explain to Ron or any of the other boys, and Hermione would probably just be mad at him for sneaking out in the first place.
He had expected Wizard’s Way to be like an Australian version of Diagon Alley but it wasn’t at all. To begin with, it was a lot smaller - basically, just a grassy square lined on four sides by a pub, an apothecary, a bookshop and a restaurant.
“Oh, erm, no, I just hadn’t seen it before,” he mumbled, suddenly becoming deeply interested in the bookcase to his right.
“A what?” Malfoy asked. “Is that a Muggle thing?”
It was safe to say that he felt rather stupid about having believed the rumours about Malfoy and Ginny, and more than a little guilty for being so hostile. He was supposed to be representing his country and his club and instead he’d acted like a jealous teenager.
“Yes.”
He cleared his throat. “Now, I don’t want any of you to collapse in shock, but I wanted to say that I’m really proud of you all." The team let out a roar. “Alright, alright, I’m serious. When I took over this job they said we’d be bottom of the league for years, and we’ve proved them wrong.”
“That was quick,” he said, starting to get up, but she stopped him with a hand on his arm.
Even though Harry understood - and he truly did - he couldn’t help but wish that Ron would be there. With both Ginny and Malfoy coming, it was shaping up to be the single most uncomfortable month of his life. The only reason that he’d agreed to do it in the first place was that it was something to fill the horrible emptiness that was the off-season. Of course, when he signed up, he’d thought he would be celebrating winning the British and Irish League with a lovely holiday.
“Is true,” Krum said matter-of-factly. “But still - was not way I wanted to win.” He paused for a second. “Wanted to visit hospital but Wood said no.”
You have the capacity to hurt him very deeply, Pansy had said. Harry tried to look at their relationship from Draco’s perspective. He’d always assumed that Draco held the power between the two of them; he was more experienced, more decisive. But now Harry wondered if that was the truth. He remembered what Angelina had said about the difficulties Draco had faced when he first came to the Magpies. Had Harry helped him? Had he encouraged the English wizarding world to embrace him?
“Crikey, you’re Harry Potter, aren’t you?” he said finally, his mouth stretching into a wide smile that seemed to contain an unnatural amount of teeth.
The pair had barely spoken to each other the night before, just ate dinner downstairs with the team and then crashed in their respective beds, but Harry was pretty sure that Malfoy hadn’t mentioned that he needed to get up at the arse crack of dawn.
Even Hermione had turned to look at him with an encouraging smile. Harry wasn’t sure who had died and made him the Hogwarts anti-bullying officer, but it felt supremely unfair, he was the last person the Slytherins would do anything for, especially Malfoy. He looked over at the table again and saw the boy in question looking back at him with an extremely unattractive sneer on his face.
Parvati arrived about halfway through the third round of drinks and made sure to sit next to him so that he was pinned between her and Hermione. He resented the fact that they felt like they needed to coddle him, but it was also a bit nice to feel cared about that much.
Then he realised that Malfoy wouldn’t know who it was so he quickly added:
“Please don’t say anything to him about it though,” she rushed. “Obviously if he hasn’t officially told you, I shouldn’t have said anything. I just assumed…”
Harry had never been in a feud before but he had to admit it made life much more interesting, and also significantly more stressful. He found himself obsessing over Malfoy’s games, even going so far as to use polyjuice to sneak into a Magpies v Harpies game, which didn’t make him feel better.
“No,” Malfoy admitted, and he had suddenly become very interested in the strap of his bag. “It’s just that owls don’t really listen to Muggles, and every time I sent him a note he’d get pecked really nastily. And it was, well, more… subtle.”
“Like to see you try,” Krum laughed too. There was another short silence, more companionable this time. “You and Malfoy, you are in love?”
“Of course he didn’t.” She rolled her eyes. “He’s too proud, and he would never want it to seem like he’s using his relationship with you to benefit his career.”
Harry frowned. “I wouldn’t do that.”
“Took your time,” Malfoy drawled.
It was blunt but Harry didn’t mind. “No. I didn't have anyone to do that, really. My aunt wasn’t exactly the, uh, nurturing type. I used to imagine, though, when I was sick. I used to close my eyes and pretend that my mum was making me soup or brushing my hair.” Harry felt a familiar lump in his throat and swallowed it down quickly, but when he glanced back at Draco’s face he was horrified to see his eyes welling with tears. “Sorry, that was depressing.” He attempted a joking tone but it landed more in the realm of apologetic.
“You’re a twat,” Harry looked back up at the sky, crossing his arms.
This was very much a group effort:
“Nothing,” he replied, but he didn’t pull his hand away. Malfoy’s cheek was soft and cool from the night air. He traced the line of his sharp cheekbone under the skin because he’d wanted to for ages, and he felt more than heard the soft intake of breath from Malfoy.
Pansy’s words played over and over in his head. You need to ask yourself who the character you are playing is. He’d never thought about it like that before. He’d always assumed that he was just himself on and off the pitch. Except… Was that strictly true? A far more familiar voice rang in his head: Don’t tell me you think you have to be Harry Potter: Quidditch Star twenty-four hours a day? Perhaps, instead of playing a character on the pitch and being himself at home, he had been playing the character all the time.
“I got another room, I’m grabbing a change of clothes,” Harry replied, fighting to stay calm.
The first red flag was that the studio was located inside of the
Marseille was stunning. On the pitch, the sun was so bright and blinding as it glanced off the metal stands that Harry had to wear his tinted goggles. Unlike the oppressive heat in Australia, the French spring was mild and pleasant, usually with just a hint of a breeze. It made playing a joy, and Harry couldn’t help but wonder why on earth Malfoy had ever left.
Colin looked at him with huge eyes brimming with tears, “Will you get it back for me Harry?”
“But they’re your friends, Harry,” Hermione said, placing her hand on his arm again.
The pre-World Cup qualifying games were always a good time, though, even if they required a decent amount of international travel, and the English team was coming together beautifully; they beat Wales, Germany and Italy in quick succession.
“A Nimbus 2001? You’ve got to be joking.”
He tried not to overthink it. Draco could be asleep, or his phone could be dead. He took a deep breath, decided to try again in the morning, and went to bed.
“Fragile?”
“Um, yes,” Harry said with some apprehension and then winced when the man let out a loud cackle.
Harry felt another wave of nausea and leant forward to rest his head against the seat of the toilet. It was lovely and cool and he closed his eyes. “I’m just going to rest my eyes for a second and then we’ll finish this conversation…”
His melancholic musings were interrupted by a sharp tug on his jacket hem. He glanced down to find an extremely ginger child with enormous blue eyes staring up at him.
He turned to look at her and was surprised to see a little flicker of worry in her eyes. “Yeah?”
“No, but it’s probably a good idea. It’s easier this way, cleaner. Before either of us meets someone else or gets attached.” Draco looked completely calm but there was that muscle in his jaw that twitched, giving him away.
“Only because you sent me a ‘you up’ text.” Malfoy sounded very much like he was smirking. “At one in the morning, I might add. It’s all very damning.”
Kreacher looked even more suspicious. “But Master has not used this room since he returned from the red-haired blood-traitor’s house.”
“You heard me. It’s not a big deal.” He sounded exasperated but his ears grew pink.
“What do you want?” Malfoy asked, quieter this time. He placed a hand on the wall next to Harry’s head.
Draco snorted. “You are doing a terrible job of pretending not to be thrilled.”
“Great!” She smiled even more broadly than before. Harry wondered idly if she was in danger of splitting her face in two. “Welcome to Australia, team! My name is Chanel. I’m a representative from the Department of Sports and Games, which is part of the Australian Ministry for Magic.”
“That’s good.” She seemed to relax a bit. “You worry me, you know.”
“I don’t know what you want,” Draco said. “Do you?”
“Parkinson? Pansy Parkinson?”
“Well no, since you chickened out last year,” Harry couldn’t keep the annoyance out of his tone this time. “Why, have you been in a dual before?”
Harry sat up a bit too quickly, blinking in shock both at the sudden light and what Malfoy had said. “What? Angelina and I aren’t…”
The next morning Harry was awoken to the unbearable sound of a Tempus clanging. He blinked, the world a blur like it always was without his glasses. Even in this state, he could tell it wasn’t time to wake up yet.
“Er, what about him?”
Malfoy cut him off by turning and walking back into the room. For a moment Harry thought that he was kicking him out, but then Malfoy called over his shoulder. “I need a drink for this conversation, want anything?”
She glanced around to check that no one was listening and then leaned forward. “I heard he had a really hard time when he first got to the Magpies. I wonder if that was what it was about?”
Draco was nowhere to be seen during the aftermath celebrations, nor was he at the afterparty at the England camp afterwards - not that Harry had really been expecting him to be.
With a sigh, Harry turned back to the game, focusing his attention on the Seekers who he was ostensibly there to observe.
Harry swallowed. “Yeah?”
“Why did you come back to Britain?” Harry wished he could watch Malfoy’s face.
“...totally unacceptable, please see previous correspondence… Harry!” She cut herself off and beckoned him in, flicking her wand at the quill so that it froze mid scrawl. “Sorry about the wait. We’re in the middle of contract negotiations with a Russian player's agent who I swear is part Nogtail.”
“Do I need to bring up the throw cushion dilemma of 2001?” She gave him a challenging look.
Malfoy sniffed. “This crap costs more than your entire wardrobe, you heathen.”
He paused in the doorway. Malfoy was leaning on the balcony, staring out at the city. The lamplight from the room spilled out and made his back and his shoulders look like they were luminescent. Harry took a sip of his drink, and a deep breath.
Hermione ignored him. She was looking rather pale too. “I’m so sorry, Harry, we should have called first. We just didn’t think… We just came to tell you some news, but it can wait until later. We can come back.”
Draco gave him a stiff little smile and then turned without another word and swept out of the bathroom.
He let her guide his hands to her waist and into her hand and they swayed together with the other couples. This was probably the closest they had physically been since they’d broken up, he realised belatedly. It was so familiar and strange at the same time.
“I know you’re not asleep, Potter,” Malfoy said after a few minutes of silence, sounding amused.
“Yeah I’m fine,” he said quickly. “Sorry, what were you saying?”
“That’s not it at all.” Harry could feel the familiar anger boiling up inside him again but it didn’t feel good at all this time.
“I hope my wedding is like that one day,” Ginny said quietly. “It was just perfect.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Harry was so indignant that he forgot his self-control and opened his eyes. Malfoy was facing away from him, folding his trousers, wearing nothing but very tight pants. The magazine cover blazed in his memory. Harry gulped and quickly looked away when Malfoy turned to look at him.
Draco wasn’t wrong about the potion. Within five minutes of taking it he was fast asleep and Harry was left to his own devices once again.
The team took up residence at a table near the back and the Muggleborns gave the Purebloods a quick lesson on ordering drinks at a Muggle bar.
Ginny looked away, out at the backyard of the Burrow where the pre-dawn moonlight light illuminated the light frost like diamonds. “Sometimes I think you would have been better off without me.” She sounded uncharacteristically uncertain. “I was never any good at being there for you when you needed me.”
He wondered if he should be hurt that Malfoy had left, but part of him understood. They couldn’t be caught together, and if they were naked in the same room it would be difficult to deny.
Grinny was grinning too. “Now for the real reason we came here.” She took Hermione’s hands in her own and affected a concerned look. “Are you absolutely certain you want to do this? My disgusting brother hasn’t tricked you into this in some way?”
“Are you alright?” she asked softly.
“Merlin, Potter, you scared the life out of me. I thought you’d gone back with Johnson.” He grabbed his wand and lit up the room with a quick Lumos .
“Alright, Mr Potter, I only have ten minutes so let’s make this fast.” She paused, tapping a long dark nail against the desk. “How can I help you?”
“Nothing.” Harry’s neck was beginning to feel hot.
The Snitch was down very low, about a metre below the Scottish Keeper’s feet. Harry only looked at it for a second and then glanced back at Draco, but it was too late: as soon as they locked eyes, Harry knew that Draco had seen it too.
“You haven’t asked me for the traditional maid of honour and best man dance,” she said accusatorily.
Harry wasn’t a sore loser, he really wasn’t, but he truly had no control over what happened next.
They hadn’t seen each other since the final in June and it was undeniably awkward. Harry was acutely aware of how childish he had been. He’d thought about writing to Malfoy to apologise a few times, but he’d never quite been able to bring himself to send the letter. Now they were standing in front of each other looking down the barrel of a month as roommates.
