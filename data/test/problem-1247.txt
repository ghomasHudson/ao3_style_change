Mcgonagall probably had her reasons taking him back, she could have hope for him to be better, but more than anyone Harry knows that you cannot get better when everything is crashing down on you, not when you're alone.
"Some friends you are." Harry grumbled, looking at the tower of muffins between them. "I'm full." He said suddenly, grabbing a handful and shoving them in his bag.
“Malfoy seems to be quite fidgety doesn't he?”  Ron said during one of their casual breakfasts, without Voldemort around Harry finally got the chance to enjoy the regular school life, with no prophecy nor dark wizard to hunt him and try to take his life he found his days at Hogwarts uneventful, they had their usual lessons, they laid under the tree during breaks, it was nice, Harry really liked it, two weeks flew by without noticing, the now called 'golden trio’ enjoyed their days like they never did before, peacefully.
fairly similar.
“He sure does” Harry said, it has already became their casual conversation during breakfast, Draco Malfoy comes in the morning, his skin paler than yesterday, with dark circles under his eyes, his usually tidy hair looked like he didn't even bother, blond locks sticking out his sides, he would sit down but never eat, not that Malfoy was Harry's source of attention, he never really paid him any thoughts after the war, but he did notice that Malfoy wasn't eating, another thing he noticed however, were the creatures  clinging to Malfoy's back, bullying him on a daily basis, serves him right, Harry thought at first, but then he started noticing them more, sitting on Draco's head during lessons, messing up his potions, covering his eyes during transfiguration, no one besides Harry noticed them, they just assumed that Draco Malfoy suddenly became 'fidgety’ , Harry could clearly see that those creatures messed up with Malfoy's temper
TW: panic attacks
“Is it…how you usually spend your time..?” Draco murmured into his ear, through their way to the kitchen he paled several shades and looked very uncomfortable, focusing all his attention on his shoes than anything else going on around him. Harry smirked “nah, but I do remember a couple of times when I came over for tea when.. well, Dobby was alive.” The last sentence left his mouth with a guilty feeling swirling in his stomach, as hard as he tried not to think about his eleven friend, he just hopped back in to the conversation. When he thought that Draco couldn't look even more uncomfortable, he was surprised to find out that the Slytherin has successfully mastered the art of frowning, showing discomfort of various levels in many different and unique ways, his teeth clenched and he stepped a bit further from Harry, his milky pale hand rubbing at the cuffs of his sleeve. “huh..he died..”
In front of him stood two men.
He obligated.
A long shadow creeping from the corner, exactly where Potter need to turn to in order to get to the Gryffindor tower. His heart skipped a beat, and without thinking he leaped forward grabbing Potter by the arm and pulling him down the staircase. “Malfoy what the fu-” Potter yelped, being interrupted by Draco's hand clasping over his mouth, Draco shushed him, putting a singular finger in front of his lips, mouthing “Filch” to a round brilliant green pair of eyes, which then narrowed flickering back to the hallway where footsteps could be heard now. “What's this? Someone has been walking around here Mrs.Norris!” Filch’s annoying voice echoed through the halls, if Draco didn't stop him Potter would have to serve a pretty nasty detention.  “Someone's out after curfew!! And the steps are leading to…?” They could hear his steps getting closer, but Draco had no interest sticking around for him to find them, fiddling in his pants single handedly he searched for his wand, whispering a silencing charm on both of them before tearing off the wall and pulling Potter down the stairs right into the dungeons.
There was always something in Luna's demeanor that made her presence so calming, she spoke in an airy dreamy-like voice, always soft, always collected, she was safe to speak to
“Malfoy?” This voice cut through him like a knife, there would be no way in hell he'd forget the sound of his voice- Potter.
McGonagall nodded “I do.”
Splash!
When his eyes opened again his was gasping for air, his blanket tossed to the floor besides him as he lay on his bed, sweaty and disheveled. Bolting forward he looked at his bedside table, but not for his clock, but at the piece of parchment under it.
Even at the Slytherin table people kept their distance, and honestly? This is fine, it just meant they're getting more food anyway
“I want to make up with you” Hermione stated bluntly, ok woah, Harry may have wanted  to
Draco just gaped, looking at his slice and then at the creature, then back again “I...I think I need to give it to someone.” He muttered, giving Hermione a quick nod before following the creature, who already walked down the hallway. He really felt confused, is it leading him somewhere? Why hadn't it bloomed yet when there's clearly cracks? He carefully pushed through students, trying his best not to drop the pie in the process, only later he realized where the Solus was leading him: Myrtle's bathroom, somehow he always ends up there.
Harry woke up heavy.
thank you all for the kudos <3 it's super important to me
(See the end of the chapter for
And it washes off of all the dirty dishes
I can smile
“You deserved it!!”
“This- this is a fuck ton of apples!” Draco exclaimed, his rich background seeping through like sand “I've never even stepped into a kitchen? And you expect me to peel
The Slytherin girl opened her mouth and then closed it, confusion shines brightly in her eyes “ and why is that?”
Draco didn't understand why it made his heart throb, why his eyes teared up again, as he stared at the slightly mushed piece of bread it hit him, delightful taste filling his mouth as he took a bite, Draco sobbed, he didn't realize how hungry he was, taking big bites one after the other his mind raced
“I know you're worried about returning honey, but I'm sure school will be great” her grip tightened on the wheel, proving Draco that she was as afraid as he is, yet, she kept talking “McGonagall was kind enough to let you attend your eighth year at Hogwarts, and if she's okay with that, anyone will.”  Draco's gaze fell back to the blurred window he was leaning on, staring at the gray road they were taking to King cross station.
"I see.” She said, her tone cold “I guess there's no choice then.” Something inside him told Draco that this is not going to end well, he'd been hanging out with Hermione for two months or so, and even he knew that when she had ideas it's either genius or the worst thing that has ever to you, so it is only natural that he automatically said: “no.”
"Ewww no I don't wanna hear that!!" Ron screeched, bubbling laughter filling their dorm.
Satisfied with his victory, Potter kept nagging him during their whole way to the Slytherin common room, stopping only when Draco had murmured “a new page” before entering, sighing with relief as the warmth of the dim fire welcomed him there, everything about his common room was so calming, feeling more like a home to him than the new shitty apartment they got in London, heck, even more than the manor. Potter clearly didn't agree with him however, freezing the moment he stepped into the room. “Um… is it really okay for me to come in?” He mumbled, all his teasing from earlier evaporating. Draco was already about to step into his dormitory, waving him to follow. “Of course, don't you Gryffindors bring friends from other houses over?” On his third step on the staircase Potter let out a whimper behind him, quiet steps following him up to his room. “And where will I sleep?”  A reasonable question for once, Draco might as well call himself impressed. “Don't worry about that, not many eight years returned to finish school, also, as you may have guessed, one of my roommates is dead so there's always a free bed.” He pulled the door open, entering a well known room: four beds scattered across a wide room with a round window in the middle, it could never be opened, but it does show a great view of the dark lake, during his first year Draco was surprised their room had any sunlight at all, but then Snape explained him how the founder charmed every window to let through as much lighting and sound as any normal window would, just so Slytherins won't feel any different than they already are. So now the soft moonlight crept through the glass, lighting up the otherwise dark room, with only one candle on Draco's nightstand, perhaps Blaise’s doing. Usually two only two beds are occupied, Blaise and his, but seems like his friend is out for the night, he did have a thing going with some Hufflepuff. “Well, that's my room” he said, walking straight to his trunk, already searching for some change of clothes. “W-where are your roommates?” Potter asked, looking around curiously yet not leaving the doorstep. “Well,  as I said, one is dead” he waved at the left side of the room while his other hand still dug through his clothes. “Goyle is in Azkaban, Blaise seems to be out, he does that often, so it's just us here.” Finding what he was searching for, he pulled out a green sweater which should fit Potter just right, together with a pair of ivory pajama pants that were short on him. “Here” Draco said, tossing Potter the clothes. Being a fairly talented seeker, Potter caught them easily, glaring down at the fabric as if it's cursed.
“And the reason we're not using magic is-” she continued, walking over to their side, taking the butter that Ron had previously cut and dropping it into the flour, digging her clean hands in and started kneading. “Because it feels more real that way, if there's one thing magic can't do, is to give you the fulfillment  you'd get if you had done it by hand.” She pushed into the dough, not caring to get some flour on her, when she saw that the hard part was done, she handed the bowl to Harry, who took her position. “Ron, pour the water in little by little while Harry does that, it will be easier that way” Hermione gave Ron a quick kiss on the cheek, leaving a bit of flour there, Ron just grumbled, pouring a bit of ice cold water into the mix. “When you're baking it really creates this special feeling..” Hermione sighed, a soft smile appearing on her face as if recalling a good memory, taking a second knife and beginning to peel apples herself, doing a way better and skillful job than Malfoy ever could. “You can just put all your worries and feelings into it, and then serve it to someone else on a platter.” Harry gaped at the green peel curling up as a thin long line as she ran her knife over the fruit quickly. “That is a good metaphor”  he pushed into his dough harder, wishing that with it he could push in some lurking thought as well. She hummed, “when I was little I used to think that if I put all my feelings into a pie, I could make something good and sweet out of it, and then all my problems would wash off the dirty dishes.” They all went quiet, probably thinking about all the problems they could shove in a pie, even Draco went quiet, peeling his apples in big clumsy chunks, a couple of Solus lurking on his back, and some walking on the table, trying hard to knock the knife out of his fingers. He sighed, grabbing his bowl and moving over to Malfoy's side, earning a quick glare from Ron. “ ‘Mione,go help your boyfriend, he seems to be struggling.” She rolled her eyes but smiled at the boy lovingly “you peel the apples then.” She said, grabbing the bowl out of his grasp “just so it won't be too easy.” And with a wink she went to make her beloved roll out the dough for her. “Came here to laugh?” Draco muttered, reaching to take an another apple from the basket, Harry couldn't help but chuckle softly “a bit.” He said, fetching one Solus off Draco's back, who immediately froze, his gray eyes looking at him, wide and questioning but Harry, despite his loud and very much beating heart, ignored the boy and instead placed the creature on his own shoulder, wincing at the weight as it snuggled up his neck. “What are you doing?” Draco might've tried to sound cold, but his voice was too overflowed with confusion and relief with the burdening weight on his back lifting up a little. Harry shrugged, getting to peeling his apples, feeling extremely aware of the Solus on his back and the gaze of it's questioning owner. “You won't get anything done with these buggers teasing you all the time” he pointed at the Solus chewing on Draco's finger “thought that if I can see them… I might as well help you with their weight and stuff..”
Shuddering, Draco nodded “yes, I do not belong here, not anymore” his grip on the cup tightened as he felt her heavy gaze on him, shutting his eyes tight, he reassured himself with the cups warmth
This is a softer one, it was hard to write after the piano scene since I'm so proud of that one, hope I won't disappoint!!!
What could bring them so much pain? He wondered, hating his hero instincts for checking it out, opening the door slowly , a similar scene revealed itself before Harry: Draco Malfoy curled up, crying on the floor
to roll his eyes, recalling Draco's words mockingly. “You know what? Never mind. You can stay here in your wet clothes, freeze to death for what I care! Maybe Filch will come around and give you a blanked, I'm going to
Even if it means I'd have to find all the reasons for them appearing alone, I already made two of them bloom anyway.” He felt an uncomfortable twist in his stomach, knowing that Malfoy feels so desperate only because he claimed to abandon him, telling him that Malfoy didn't need his help anymore, Harry regretted these words, he really did, even though he wasn't entirely wrong either.
“Fair point.”
“I do too, my father as well.” He said, not really knowing why is he being so honest in this situation. It became quiet after that, Neville sobbed but made no effort to push Draco away from him, and he didn't leave, just sitting the in the heavy silence, finally deciding to break it. “Look, I know you could never forgive me, and I don't expect you to.”
Startled awake Draco called out frustratedly “wha- wait a second-” he stumbled at the door exit, groaning before going back to grab the - not to be dramatic-
Falling into a quick pace he followed in a direction he assumed Neville would take, noticing movement right around the corner.  Taking bigger steps he took a sharp turn, seeing Neville's back just a few meters away from him “Longbottom!” He shouted, running up to him as the Gryffindor stopped, only now Draco noticed that his shoulders are tense, as if he's expecting a beating, his heart dropped when he realized this might be his fault. “Um.”  Draco felt uncomfortable talking to him, especially since he didn't really feel like apologizing to Neville Longbottom. But he promised Harry to be good or something, so he better give it a chance. “I'm sorry, you know, for everything” Draco said, scratching the back of his neck. Neville, who still stood with his back facing him, didn't speak for a while, but he did turn around, his eyes not angry nor hurt, just tired.  He looked apathetic, like Draco's words mean nothing to him, maybe they did.
Luna pursed her lips, placing her finger on them softly, humming, after a minute of thinking she smiled “you're saying you don't know, but you already made the first move didn't you? No matter what your heart sees, who you're seeking to help has to decide for themselves if they accept it,you cannot help those who don't want it” she placed her hand on his shoulder, squeezing “all feelings, just like spirits, appear for a reason” he wasn't sure what in her words did it, but Harry felt fresh air coming through his nose, filling up his lungs
Out of everyone Potter was the only person he just couldn't face, and him snapping at something that wasn't actually
use magic “but they're heavy” he complained, McGonagall rose her eyebrow at him, her gaze not quite focused on  his face, but on something else “heavy? Well you unlike any other should be used to some extra weight” she remarked, a sly smirk appearing in her face before she left the classroom, leaving Draco frozen there
hey guys! i'm sorry it took so long to update, the truth is, i'm not feeling really good lately, also finals are coming aaaahhhhhhh
Which is bad, since Blaise is right in the room with them, and by the devious smirk on his lips, he does not know any better. “Morning love birds, you better get dressed before you miss breakfast completely and whine to be about it all day” Blaise said, pulling out a fresh button up and changing right in front of them, Harry, his mouth agape, quickly closed it moving the blankets from his feet ( throwing it on top of Malfoy in the process) and stumbling out of the bed clumsily almost tripping over his long pajama pants.  “we're not love birds!!” Harry stuttered, but Blaise wasn't looking at his desperate face. Instead, menacing eyes focused on Harry's body, not that there's anything wrong with it, after leaving the Dursleys he became a rather healthy boy. He didn't know what Blaise was staring at exactly, but Harry couldn't help but feel uncomfortable under his gaze.
btw english is not my first language so i'm sorry if my grammer is bad, i really hope you enjoyed this chapter i  thought that those kids need to chill and make up a little before they move on into learning more about the Solus and themselves, they are actually a methaphor for anxiety and depression( i hope i  managed to show that well) since one of my ways of dealing with it is to embody my problems and turn them into characters, making it into something easier to deal with, i hope this story helps you too
While Ron and Hermione snuggled in bare daylight Harry took his time to look around himself, students from Gryffindor and Slytherin gathered up near the entrance all waiting for the professor to arrive, but Harry searched for a certain Slytherin which he failed to find
"I know I know!" Draco said, running a hand through his hair to push it back, he liked mimicking his father. So he straightened his back and rose his nose high, reaching for the table to fetch his father's wand. "But I wanted- I wanted to show you something! Can I use your wand?" Lucius frowned, looking upon Draco as if he is being a nuisance, but soon enough he withered. Sighing softly as he leaned back into his chair. "Have you learned a spell?" He asked, his eyes brighter now, hungry. "Since I will be going to Hogwarts soon, I thought I should be prepared Father." Draco said proudly, holding his father's wand with shaky fingers. It felt cold and heavy in his weak hands. Nevertheless he pointed it, just like he did with his mother's wand, though way more kind feeling in his grasp. Eyes focusing on the peacock feathered quill as he concentrated. Feeling the magic tickling the tips of his fingers. Taking a deep breath and stilling himself, Draco casted.
“Sorry?! You're sorry?!” Malfoy screamed, pushing more and more creatures onto Harry's frame until the boy couldn't feel his limbs anymore, being crushed up by hideous weight. “Merlin!! I hope you suffocate!!”  And to Malfoy's delight (probably) Harry definitely was, in fact, suffocating.
Yesterday.
“Guess you really don't seem to get tired of me don't you?” He frowned, giving in when they begin climbing on him “what are you anyway? What do you want?” He spoke, as if they could understand him, kneeling down, he stared at a smaller blob besides him, it's legs were very short and they were more chubby ( or fluffy??) Their face flat with a couple of horns peeking out, it seemed like they had a pair of tails as well,he sighed, reaching out his hand to touch the creature “you know, that would've been nice if you'd at least talked..”  as his palm got closer, the creature seemed to notice him, their white eyes narrowed at him before it suddenly leaped onto his hand, sinking their fangs deep into it “ah fuck!” he yelped, pushing the creature off while he fell on his arse, rubbing his hand angrily
He never really thought about it, how many familiar faces were buried after the battle of Hogwarts, people he ate and studied with on the daily, colorless amongst rows of graves. Was it because he has been so deep in his own problems? Would he, if were killed in the war, had been written in the lists? Perhaps not, just like Bellatrix and Crabbe weren't, since villians do not deserve to be remembered.
"Stop making a face, you're souring my juice." Hermione said, sipping her orange juice with a distasteful expression."I'm not making a face." Harry said, his frown deepening at the vacant seat besides Pansy. "You are. Do you want my stew or something? You've been staring at it like it has personally hurt you." The Slytherin girl said, pushing her bowl closer to herself. "Well it's mine, the only person who can steal my food if Draco."
"You will be better." Lucius was so sure, everything in his well masked expression said so, making Draco see exactly what he wanted to; pride.
“Where have you been?!” Weasley squealed as he and Potter made their way inside the great Hall, it was already half empty as many students had already finished their breakfast. They sat down the Gryffindor table together earning a couple of looks, especially from Longbottom, who tensed up the moment Draco appeared in the hall. Potter chuckled awkwardly rubbing the back of his head “sorry, I slept over at Draco's” he said, and Hermione gasped loudly, he could already feel the blush creeping up his face, no way to be subtle with the name change but Potter didn't have to be so blunt about it! “Don't make it sound weird Potter. I kindly let you in only because you were enough of a dumbass to almost run into Filch yesterday.” It seems like his excuse (which was the absolute truth and nothing else) didn't land properly, since Hermione gave him a long and knowing look he wished she wasn't giving him. Pansy, who Draco now noticed was sitting besides her, a pair of black eyebrows so high you could barely see them under her dark hair. “You guys made up!” She exclaimed happily, a wave of relief washed over him, at least his best friend wasn't giving him weird looks, someone did though, sitting next to Ginny Weasley, Neville Longbottom couldn't stop staring him tense glances as if waiting for Draco to leap at him at any moment. When he met his gaze however, the boy turned back to his half empty plate, shoving a piece of fried egg into his throat, nearly choking on it in the process.
He didn't respond, he bit his lower lip painfully, quietly sobbing,his body stiff and frozen, loud nerve wrecking footsteps made their way towards him, it was almost soothing, to hear the loud scary sound getting bigger while he shuts his eyes tight devoured by silent darkness, and when your eyes don't see, you notice how loudly your heart is beating, in sync with each and every footstep
“Magic” Ron smirked, while still staring at the repaired walls in disbelief, but his running eyes locked on a certain blond figure, the sight made Ron frown immediately, Harry felt a sharp pain in his elbow “ouch Ron wha-” Harry was cut off by the redhead grabbing his face and turning him to look at a small pack of green, snuggled together between all the other house colors
The Solus hissed, biting down on Draco's nape as he blinked, shooting back to his senses. He blinked, realizing that he was still in the dungeons. His knees throbbing against the hard stone floor. In front of him, there was his father's letter. Torn to tiny little pieces. His father's only chance of freedom discarded by his own son, his last hope. The shaking returned, together with a nasty burn at the back of his eyes. Draco doesn't realize he's crying until a tear falls onto his father's neat handwriting, messing the ink.
It's on someone else's plate for a while
Suddenly he felt himself bump painfully into a hard surface, groaning loudly Draco stepped back only to see Neville Longbottom standing right in front of him, great, just what he needed to get more annoyed
“Y-yes! I love you like a table! I mean, I'll hold your stuff for you! Always there t-to support you you know? Strong and stable…” Ron bullshited his way through, and surprisingly it worked since Hermione's eyes teared up in seconds “oh Ron!” She leaped into his arms “that's the sweetest metaphor ever!” Ron laughed weakly at that, mouthing 'i have no idea how I did that’ to Harry.
Igor suspects it's located in the Headmaster's office.
"This is do'' a soft voice was followed by a sound, strong but pleasant. "After there is re-mi-fa-'' three sounds, three notes, softly played by his mother's fingers. "Eight notes is an octava, going from do to do, see?" A high pitch tone, his mother's smile. "This note is called do as well, but it is higher. Do you want to touch the keys?" Draco was little, big enough to learn piano, but small enough for his legs to tangle from the stool. His mother was warm at his side, fingers sliding down the keys gracefully. Draco wanted to be graceful like her, wanted to learn the magic she created with her bare fingers. So he nodded, pressing the keys she had just shown him, pointing it out on the sheet on notes they spread out on the top of the piano. "Good, can you see they're moving in a pattern? Take your time to read it, try to play the melody." Draco did, not understanding how the very same notes his mother played sounded so harsh under his undeveloped hands. A flush of shame crept up his neck, he did a bad job. "You are doing so well darling." His mother said, her hands playing a warm melody on his back, rubbing it softly in a way that made his heart sing from pride. "You're lying." He said, ignoring the content her praise gave him. "I would never lie to you." She tilted her head, chuckling at his frown. "Look at your hands." His mother said, platinum blonde hair falling over her eyes. "Your fingers are long and slim, you have the hands of a pianist."
“Oh come on Malfoy, don't be a dick.”
Of course he would.
“I can't believe you almost killed me with a Solus.”
He flopped down next to Pansy, too focused on the creature in front of him to care about Pansy's complaints.
Confused, Draco rubbed his eye furiously before glancing at the creature again, it was still there, how was she not seeing this?? It's right there! Was he imagining things? No, it's weight was too real to be imaginary, or maybe not
“Weird, I can't see anything” Hermione narrowed her eyes at the Slytherin, signing “ maybe it's like thestrals, only the ones that have seen death could see them”
And if my escape is successful, this could connect his disappearance to us.
off!”
Slowly, pale fingers released the fabric, and with a deep breath, Draco shoved his blanket down and rolled up his sleeve.
“This man was Snape.”  Draco's heart skipped a beat from the sound of this name, sandness overflowing him, he truly missed Snape, usually his support was there for all the Slytherin students, even though he was kind of an ass to everyone else.
YOOOO IT'S 2 AM AND I JUST FINISHED THIS CHAPTER BUT I COULDN'T MAKE YOU GUYS WAIT ANY LONGER SO THERE IT IS! I LIKE WROTE 5K WORDS IN ONE SITTING SO THIS CHAPTER IS 9K WORDS THAN THE USUAL 6K HOPE IT'S GOOD ENOUGH GOOD NIGHT
“Do you want me to throw an another Solus at you?”
, how ironic is that the boy who lived would he touching it now?. “Huh.” Harry said, his intense green eyes following the lines with deep concentration “I thought it would feel more like a scar, but your skin is smooth.”  Draco wanted to laugh, to mock him for such an awful remark, but he didn't, his eyes focusing on the famous lightning bolt instead. He never understood how everyone always recognized Potter for such a small thing, there it is, barely seen under Potter's bush of a hair. Yet this scar was the thing to define him, the legendary Harry Potter, the chosen one.
as if Draco was someone worth saving, he knew what he's worth, and it's definitely not the savior of the wizarding world pitying him, stupid Potter.
“Table?” She asked,not out of anger, she genuinely wanted to know
“You murderous snake!” a certain ravenclaw seemed to shout, “get lost!” Someone else just as brave remarked, Hermione gasped, putting her hands over her mouth “this is horrible…” she whispered, Harry agreed
“Do not. Call me Drake. Ever.again.”  Draco said, jabbing a finger at his chest. Doing his best to show Potter how pissed he actually is. “Then how am I going to call you?” Potter pouted, Draco wished earth would open up and eat him.
Harry never thought he would be coming back to Hogwarts, not after Voldemort, not after last year, yet he found himself marching down the familiar corridors anyway, with Ron and Hermione at his side, he now knew, that even after defeating Voldemort, thinking about an another stressing year at school seemed just as scary
woooo new update! I'm really trying to make their feelings realistic, so sorry for the slowburn you guys
his voice broke leaving dead silence,eyes were filled with shame, Hermione was right, he did have a lot of power.
“Did I really?”
To his relief, Malfoy had enough mercy stored in him to lift off the creature just in time when Harry started seeing white, he gasped loudly taking a deep breath as if he'd just been underwater. Malfoy had been glaring at him with glossy eyes, one Solus held tightly between his hands while his chest rose and fell quickly, Harry could hear every quick breath the blond boy takes, perhaps because he's practically wheezing air in and out of his lungs, or because he nearly got fucking
Zabini’s gaze narrowed at him “ help?? Why would you of all the people-” he exclaimed but was cut off by Pansy’s hand landing in his shoulder, her eyes wet “what do you know?” She says, her voice quiet but desperate, it was clear as day that she cared about Malfoy a whole lot, more than she cares about her pride
“And I really have no excuse, and no satisfying explanation that is worth forgiving...I just..I want to be better, I want to try” and he meant it, something in him really did want to try,it is his last year at Hogwarts, and he might as well do it here than wait for a funeral in order to cry about all the things he should've done.
He noticed how Parkinson left breakfast crying this morning, leaving all her friends behind, he also noticed how far the Slytherins stood apart from the rest of the students, as if they were keeping a safe distance between them, something inside him tugged at his chest, feeling like he should do something, but not quite sure what nor why, Malfoy was their friend right? maybe they could help him break through Malfoy’s thick skin.
Harry stared at the darkening sky, mostly because it's the only thing he could do while being pinned down to the ground by a bunch of heavy (and deadly) creatures. “I really am sorry, Draco” Harry said in a tone that  he could describe as no other than kissup, desperate for Malfoy to forgive him and also release him from all of this damn weight. “Sod off Potter, don't go using my name now.” Malfoy huffed, folding his arms over his chest, clearly sulking. “You didn't mind it in the room of requirement.” Harry stated matter of factly, tensing up as Malfoy shot him a quick glare, already taking a deep breath to prepare himself for suffocation Harry was rather surprised when Malfoy just softened up, his eyes darting back to the water “it was different..” he muttered, his voice so quiet Harry barely heard it. He didn't say anything after that, his words leaving a void for uncomfortable silence. Harry sighed, really wishing Draco would scold him more, heck, even shove a Solus up his face again, anything to replace this quiet, shattered Malfoy.
What? It was past lunch already? Draco really lost the flow of time, nevertheless it was a clear explanation of Longbottoms actions, Draco was still confused as hell
One of the creatures caught his gaze, their bright white eyes sending shivers down Harry's spine, for a second he feared their Slytherin owner would turn around as well and catch him staring, but he didn't.
Hope you liked this chaotic chapter! Is a bit more rom-comy than the rest of the fic but it had been a blast to write, I just love their dynamic as a group, I hope you do too ;3
"Yeah?"
“You skipped breakfast, and lunch too” he said
His eyelids grew heavy as his mind slowly drifted to sleep, the cool room contrasting against Potter's warm body besides him, his breathing has calmed down a while ago, perhaps he's already in deep sleep. A part of him wondered what Potter dreamed about, was it the war or the love of his friends? They all dreamed about the war, hellish nightmares of the screams, crimson red blood dripping in the halls, dear friends long gone, only the lucky ones don't experience nightmares, but the ones that got it the hardest are the the people that don't dream at all, those who have nothing left to dream about.
“Your family was bad huh? Yeah. On that I agree, did you know Malfoy? You're not the only one who had suffered. Your aunt, Bellatrix, did you know? How she
“It will be okay Draco” his mother's soft voice woke him from his daze, Draco's eyes shifted to look at her nape, it seems like their car had stopped, which is funny, since his father would never allow of such disgusting muggle technology, but his father was locked up now, and it doesn't matter what a prisoner thinks about the ones that are free, again, it's funny because after  the war none of them will ever be free no matter if they're behind bars or sitting in a luxurious car like Draco and his mother did, her worries reflected in the front mirror, she looked at her pale son with deep concern while he himself idly leaned on the cold window, he felt like scoffing at her but had no heart to actually do so, his mother has gotten way thinner in the past couple months, the dark circles under her eyes never leaving her, he just couldn't be rude to this woman anymore, nor ever again.
“YOU'RE WHAT?!” The idiot screeched, and Draco was glad he thought about putting silencing charms over them before going with Potter
Draco froze, his quill not moving, he felt uneasy lying to his poor mother, but telling her the truth will only hurt her more, she was very broken after the war, the strong and all mighty Narcissa Malfoy became a weak and vulnerable woman, he felt like telling her about the glares and the bullying, about the creatures, it will only be more of a burden, so he tightened his grip, took a deep breath and continued writing:

When he reached Gryffindor’s table he froze, clenching his fists tight
Harry hated Malfoy, for his whole life he couldn't stand him, a spoiled brat, a horrible bully
“And you know what's the worst part?”  Malfoy turned to him, his expression so pained Harry himself felt like crying “I thought I deserved it. I thought that that's how it's supposed to be!” His voice broke, reminding Harry more of a hiss than a whisper, one you'd hear from a frightened kitten displaying it's last way of defense in front of a predator.  “I mean- I mean… he gave me all I ever wanted, he bought me all the toys and sent me candy with each Hogwarts letter, he loved me Potter, did he not?” Harry thought he did, each time he'd see Malfoy from across the hall, receiving numerous gifts from his parents on the daily, you'd assume he's nothing but a spoiled child, everyone wished to be loved by their parents like that, but was he truly loved? Harry couldn't say for sure. The Dursleys hated his guts, therefore they abused him, locked him in a cupboard under the stairs, but Malfoy was different, never locked up nor starved, but abused nonetheless. “I.. I don't know..” Harry sighed, did Malfoy really expect an answer? From an orphan no less, but unlike Malfoy, Harry knew his parents loved him, they died protecting him, and while they are still alive, Malfoy never knew if what he received from his parents was true love. “I thought he did.” Malfoy admitted “I was so inspired by him! Ever since I was little I've been told that one day I'll grow up to be a great man like my father, and as his heir, that's all I wished to be… but now? He's locked up in Azkaban for choosing the wrong side in not one but two wars! What a great man he was my ass! now he'll rot there for the rest of his life, and perhaps, if the ministry will feel adventurous, me and my mother will join him soon.”  Harry pushed the Solus off him with great effort, just enough for them to scramble up in his lap, he sat up clumsily, determined to leave them there, not letting their weight return to Malfoy yet.
"You will surpass me, Draco. And the father before me, you will be the best there is. That is in your blood. That is your only choice." He squeezed his shoulder, grounding Draco to their expensive carpet. "The Malfoy name is a heavy burden." He said
He snuggled up in his bedsheets, enjoying the well missed warmth. Closing his eyes shut he was ready for dreams to overtake him, he didn't hear any rustles from Potter's side of the room, which was weird, maybe he's a very still sleeper. Burying his head into the pillow he could feel himself drifting into sleep before he felt a firm hand on his shoulder. “Draco.” Potter's voice said through the darkness, and Draco my or may not have released a very loud screech. He snapped his eyes open, jumping up quickly up his bed so now he was almost falling off, his eyes got used to the darkness already so he could clearly see Potter
I should really start wrapping up this fic huh? We really are getting there.
Before Draco knew it a gasp left his throat, he just stared at Potter, wide eyed filled with utter disbelief “help me-?” He whispered “help me?!” Potter stepped back from Draco's sudden yell, he couldn't believe it! Absolutely couldn't process it, Potter? Helping him? This is some kind of a joke! His blood was boiling feeling every nerve in his body completely snapping “I don't need your help!!” Draco spat at him, noticing Potter's anger raising under those stupid circular glasses, finally, a Potter he was used to.
he could only guess what the both of them talked about, given their shared history Draco guessed it wasn't good things. Hermione nodded quietly as gloom fell over the table, they've all been there, well, besides Pansy of course, who now tried to hold back tears, not a good way to start a morning, mourning you friends death, but it's not a new thing for any of them, since everyone lost someone in the war. “I'm sorry Draco… we tried our best-” Granger began and he made sure to stop her there “hey, it's okay. The Solus bloomed, so I'm better now” he gave her a gentle smile which she returned, no need to feel guilty now. Besides her, Weasley frowned, perhaps disapproving of their exchange? Draco had no time to think this over, since at this moment Neville rose up from his seat leaving the Great Hall. He didn't know what pushed him up to follow, but he did, shooting Potter a quick glance. One of the Solus climbed up his hair as he did so, making his scalp sting and eyes water- maybe Neville is the next thing he's ought to fix? He wasn't sure, but it was worth a try.
It was then when Potter shifted, every movement of his noticeable on the small bed “did it hurt?” Potter, who Draco assumed to be long asleep, spoke suddenly. And he debated whether he should turn around and strangle the git for disturbing his sleep twice in one hideous night. “Shut up Potter. This is not a sleepover.” Draco growled, pulling his blanket over his ears as if it would make all the Potter-related noise to go away. But the boy didn't waver, instead, Draco felt an another shift on his bed as Potter popped himself on one elbow, his gaze sternly locked on his nape “I never had a sleepover..” the Gryffindor muttered, a tint of hurt in his voice. Draco made his annoyance known by groaning loudly before turning over to face him, his glare softening when he actually
“Draco, it looks like you're falling apart, I won't ask why, even a dead man doesn't have time for that" Draco huffed a laugh,”i just..don’t know what to do” he mumbled, tears filling up his eyes “I'm not here to help you anymore, but..listen up kid” Snape’s voice soothed him, his hands were clenched at his sides, tugging thick pieces of fabric in his palm
happy Valentines day!
A black blob like creature was making itself comfortable on his shoulder,it didn't look like an animal, yet had four legs and claws we're definitely tugging his shirt, their white eyes were wide and dangerous, he yelped standing up with a jolt, the thing fell of his shoulder and hissed
“I just don't think anyone should be treated like that” Hermione said, her voice quite tense from the irony, since Pansy
"Harry? Hey Harry! Mate we're gonna be late!" A voice called out to him, but it was muffled. He didn't let it bother his dreams. "Harry you're missing breakfast! And I mentally cannot skip breakfast, I will never survive potions without it!" He saw someone, they were almost invisible against the snow. Just as white, yet not as cold. They had flesh and skin which were warm to the touch, and eyes that froze you in place. Harry knew this person, he enjoyed standing in this soothing nothingness around them, if only this annoying voice stopped talking… "that's it. Neville bring me my wand, I'm gonna aquamenti this bitch"
“I know that.” She said it as if it was a normal thing to be, as if he just told her he ate the most delicious chocolate frog ever, no concern whatsoever.
When it's done
Weight.
“There she comes!” Ron exclaimed, startling both of the boys. Harry almost forgot his best friend was standing right besides them, looking more and more uncomfortable by the second. He visibly softened when Hermione approached however, holding a bag of flour with two house elves behind her, one holding a basket full of apples. “We can use the counter right in the corner, by the time we will finish the dough they'll have an oven prepared for us” she said proudly with a bright smile on her face. Even though Harry was uncertain about all this, he couldn't help but smile back at his excited friend. Ron quickly grabbed the basket and thanked the house elf, while Draco gaped at the pair looking like he doesn't know what he's supposed to do now, so Harry quickly walked up to the second house elf which carried a paper bag and took it from her “thank you for letting us use the kitchen” he smiled at her softly noticing that the bag contains some cinnamon and sugar. She giggled shyly “we would do anything for our heroes, mister Potter” sharing a quick look with her friend who nodded “yes! This is the least we could do” Harry tried hard to keep smiling at them as he stood back up to his full height, it's awkward to get called like that, and Harry is everything but a hero in his opinion, which was mutually agreed with Malfoy who murmured “saint Potter” when he came back.
Seems like Neville didn't believe him as well, he scoffed angrily “different now huh? Oh, poor Draco! Look how damaged he is, so we should all just forgive him right? No! I won't be like them.” He stepped forward, poking a painful finger in his chest “I will not pity you Malfoy. I will not flutter around you just because you became somewhat decent!”. Now he was really getting on Draco's nerves, who felt his face heat up from anger, he'd push Neville off himself, just like he did in his early years, more than anything he wished to shout in his face, to laugh out 'ha! You think you're worthy of my apology?!’ and then Neville would squirm, run away crying just like he did after all those years instead of glaring daggers at him with such bravery now Draco understood how he had the guts to slice down that snake.
Always someone but himself.
Wait a minute.
A restless Hufflepuff  was kicking Malfoy in a middle of an empty circle created by the crowd, no one besides wailing Pansy, who screamed in horror didn't seem to bat an eye, they all shared this fury, yet only one was able to express it, and Malfoy let him.
Harry remembered what Ron had said to them the other day, that they have to be kind, not because they deserve it
(See the end of the chapter for
When he entered it however, he immediately knew why the Solus has led him there. Neville Longbottom was sitting there, his figure small and hunched under the sink, just like Draco had been when he just returned to Hogwarts, skipping meals and spending most of his time falling apart in the bathroom, that's when Neville came in, bringing him sandwiches. He probably made a noise, since Neville's head perked up sharply, his bloodshot eyes wet and leaking rapidly. Draco had taken a reflexive step back, and then saw the Solus strolling right up to the boy, sitting there, waiting. He took a deep breath and did the same, sliding down the wall at his side, far enough for both of them to be comfortable yet close so he wouldn't have to yell. He stared into nothingness for a minute before just offering the boy his plate. “I made pie.” He said, Longbottom just glared at him. “I, uh.. don't eat sweets so..just take it.” He shoved it in his direction until Neville took it, giving him a sceptical look “I didn't poison it or anything, otherwise Potter and the Weasel would probably be dead.”  The boy didn't answer, but Draco didn't expect him to. His chest had been heavy and bothering even without his words, telling how he's not interested in hearing Draco out, so he didn't give him the chance to do so, “what happened?” He asked him, leaning his head against the cold wall, he had the indescribable urge to fiddle with his sleeves. “You know, um, it's sometimes easier to talk so someone you hate than er..a friend.” Longbottom just stared, and it had gotten on Draco's nerves, can't he see he's trying hard here? This git is probably debating whether he should smash this pie right into Draco's face, and he wouldn't blame him; he gave him the pie after all.
“With needles.” Potter said without skipping a beat. Draco screeched “A NEEDLE?? What is wrong with them?? I would never do such a stupid thing as tattooing myself with- with needles!!”  Instead of saying anything, Potter just gave him a long, long glare. “Won't do anything as stupid huh?” He mused, making Draco snap his mouth shut.
Even towards the ones who most definitely don't deserve it.
Thus he decided to help him, he decided to try, so he won't repeat his previous headmaster's mistake, he won't let an another broken child slip away like that.
I finished this chapter earlier than I intended and honestly I have absolutely no patience so i decided to upload it
And crumbled under the immense weight.
“Clearly I did not.” Draco stated, sneering when Potter pulled his tongue out on him. Yes, seeing Harry Potter splashing disoriented in the black lake had been quite a sight, one he might imprint in his memory and tell his grandchildren, how he tricked the all mighty Harry Potter, the chosen one, to fall face down right into the black lake, letting out the most girly scream as he did so. You know, for pettiness sake. What he won't tell his grandchildren however, is how he himself fell to the very same trick, leaving him all wet and uncomfortable, his shoes squeaking with every step he takes.
His wand was heavy in his grasp, words alien on his tongue as he sobbed:
Draco woke up heavy.
The only problem is that all evidence of our connection to him is archived at Hogwarts.

“Why all of your clothes are green?” He asked, looking at his sweater suspiciously. Draco just gaped at him, giving him a few minutes so the question would sink in, especially when he's in the Slytherin common room which is (surprise!) Mostly green, before he snarled “why all of your questions stupid?” And pulled his pajamas from under his pillow, suddenly feeling very self conscious. When he originally invited Potter over, he didn't think they would be alone, he also didn't think through the fact that they will have to change in front of each other, he was about to ask Potter if he wants him to leave to for a couple of minutes before getting a flash of bright red boxers, with
Thank you guys for the patience, especially the ones who keep up with me no matter the waiting time, it means a lot.
He would flush, but it seems like his feelings for Draco were quite obvious, so he might as well act on it. It's probably wrong to search for him that way, Hermione will scold him, but that's for later. Ducking into a corner Harry pulled out his marauders map. Draco wasn’t hiding in the dungeons nor lurking in the hidden hallways of Hogwarts. Instead, his name appeared slowly passing near the headmistress office. Weird, but not totally unusual. Without second thought Harry bolted down the hallway, his heartbeat picking pace together with him just moments before betraying him and stopping entirely when his eyes landed on a certain blonde. Draco was standing right in front of the Griffin statue, a heap of books weighing down his arms, Harry would assume it to be uncomfortable and straining, but he couldn’t help but break a smile recalling how similar the git was to Hermione, both in intellect and the way the liked to carry their books. The boy seemed entranced by the statue, storm gray eyes searching so intensely Harry would assume he could see right through it into the familiar room beyond. Approaching quietly Harry stepped behind him, seizing his moment when he said; "Aren't they heavy?" A stupid question, Harry knew the moment Draco turned to meet his eyes, frowning. "Are you mocking me?" Draco spat, his words contrasting the softness of the lips who bored them. And Harry knew, since he got a taste of them yesterday. "I meant the books, idiot." Harry tried to explain carefully, he really didn't want their first conversation after the kiss to be a fight, or at least they could fight with their lips instead of their words. "Oh, right." Gray eyes widened, as if realizing where he was Draco looked around himself, worrying his lower lip in his teeth. He looked stressed, Harry noted as Draco avoided the Griffin statue like fire now, looking anywhere but behind him. Taking the initiative, Harry stepped right next to the boy and leaned to grab some books, his arms immediately screaming at him from the strain. Draco blinked. "Where are you headed?" Harry tried to keep his tone light, quirking a smile at the taller Slytherin. "Potter- that's fine I can carry this." Draco grumbled, reaching to take his stuff back only for Harry to duck out of his way quickly, praising his quick reflexes due to years and years of being his team's seeker. "Let me." He reassured, his heart clenching at the way Draco rolled his eyes. "I was about to return them to the library." He muttered at last, already walking down the hall only for Harry to follow him like an excited puppy.
There was a sigh, softness replaced by evident annoyance. "You're terrible." Draco said, turning sharply without waiting for Harry to follow, as if he knew that he would, that git.
“Why do you look so tired?” Snape asked, Draco shook his head weakly “it's- hard..” he mumbled, suddenly feeling weak under the painted gaze
The creature simply glared straight into his eyes making him feel uncomfortable, like their gaze brought uneasy weight on his back.
Previous events ran through his mind, when Potter found him in the most vulnerable state, if Draco knew better he'd guess Potter would hex him or at least call him out for old times sake, but he didn't, for he offered Draco help instead.
Stopping in front of the green pack made all the eyes turn to face them, Parkinson frowned at her sight but saying nothing, not that she would dare to be rude to a war hero, the air between them was so intense you could cut it with a butter knife, both of the sides staring intensely yet not daring to say a thing
His chest throbbed,and the pain from yesterday's beating kindly reminded him where he was, just like all the other students cared to remind him, he no longer belonged at Hogwarts, somehow, the weight on his back grew, he didn't know those things could get heavier, but it seemed like they did, just like Pansy, deep inside he was hurt, longing for the warmth of his mother who kept him safe all this time, this Hogwarts wasn’t the school he once knew, a place he and his friends hung out and endlessly teased Potter and his friends, a place where his actions were always hidden and forgotten due to his father’s powerful name, Draco was thrown off into a completely different world, a damaged heartbroken world mercilessly abused by war, in which Draco fought, for all the wrong sides and reasons, Draco grabbed the fabric at his chest clinging into his button up helplessly, his cold hands cooling his throbbing chest, everything hurts and not only from his beating, everything is pushed down with the weight on his back.
There was no way those things were real, maybe it's a spell, perhaps a prank, he didn't care anymore, it was his second day here and he was tired already.
“We fought after that”
"And one day, that weight shall rest on your shoulders."
i've been having a really hard time with my anxiety, suffering from more attacks than usual and i found myself curled up in bed crying, writing this fic as if in search for temporary safety, your kudos and comments make me extremely happy, this chapter is a tad softer than the others, i had a blast writing it
"Ron I don't think that's-"
“Spirits?” Hermione skipped through the green grass, her bushy hair bouncing as she walks, Harry nodded, his gaze locked on the familiar hut in sight “I think so, after looking more closely, they're definitely slightly see through”
“Why can't I just use magic?” he moaned, yanking the apple from his hand when the knife finally found its way to his finger, he hissed loudly shaking his hands which now Harry noticed had one finger colored crimson, quickly popping it in his mouth, sucking on it grumpily “I told you!!” He shouted, his eyes suddenly meeting Harry's.  He might have accidentally shoved a bunch of flour down his throat since it just went dry, there was something different about Malfoy, all worked up and frustrated like that, struggling with the dumbest and the simplest of things making him look more alive, more human. He had rolled up his sleeve just like Hermione told him, the soft yellow light of the room making even his ugly mark beautiful, platinum blonde hair all messed up and from all the times he ran his fingers through making several locks fall freely against his forehead, almost glowing white in this lighting. Something in his stomach twisted uncomfortably, and he dropped his gaze to look back at his bowl, filled with a little mountain of pure white flour, so soft yet cool to the touch, a voice in his head suggested to shove his face into it, that would make him get rid of a bizarre thought.
Thank you guys for all the patience, I am immensely proud of this chapter and sincerely hope you will like it as well.
A wonderful flash of memories crossed his mind, and Harry reached for the sweater he wore yesterday absentmindedly, inhaling softly just to check if there were any remains of cologne that wasn't his. "W-why are you smiling like that?" Ron's said with a visible shudder. "Merlin please stop smiling like that, you look like a maniac!" Harry lowered the fabric blinking at the shape. "I'm not smiling." He said, biting down his smirk. "Yes you are!! And you should stop! Right now." His best mate said, reaching for the table and shoving his glasses on him rather violently. "Ow- Ron!" He whined, smacking his hand away. "It hurt you bastard!" He said, glaring at his friend (which he thankfully can see now) Realizing that Ron was wearing a very disappointed expression. "Something clearly happened yesterday." He said, Harry had to fight his urge to smile again. Yesterday he and Draco kissed. No, Draco kissed him. And let him kiss back when Harry wanted to. His heart tugged at the memory of the blond giggling against his lips, showing a soft side that made Harry want to climb a mountain or something stupid like that. But the stupidest part was how happy Harry felt, recalling the memory as if it was recorded on tape. He liked him, liked him so much it hurt
He will ignore it, and then it will leave, his stress was acting up, it definitely was.
“You should accept help, if you're offered, I did once, and served under a great man, who I was ready to die for”  Draco's sobs evolved into loud cries as he fell down to his knees, pain streaming through his whole body, running everything through his head, Voldemort, the war,his family- Potter.
“Draco...you….” Snape's painting spoke, moving slowly just like he did when he was alive “...look horrible, your father would never allow you wander around looking.. like that.” Draco felt a dry chuckle leaving his body “father’s in jail” he said, Snape nodded “of course he is.”
L. Malfoy."
"You are avoiding the subject." Ron grinned knowingly.
“Nope.” Draco admitted proudly, his other hand clasping over the mark through the fabric. He spared it a quick glance before flopping onto his bed, sighing with relief. “Well, enough with the underwear talk. I'm going to sleep, we have two free beds in this dorm so you can take whatever, I'm turning off the lights, okay?” Draco said as he slipped under the covers, already about to blow the candle. Panic flashed on Potter's face as he simply nodded, he stomped over the two free beds and Draco blew off the  candle, letting the room to be taken over by darkness.
With a quick flash of panic Harry considered shoving Malfoy off himself and claim him for abducting him, but then he remembered that he willingly came into his room, even worse,
"You will not let go of this stupid kiss huh." Draco groaned, Harry grinned knowing he rolled his eyes just now. "Nope." Green met gray as they glared at one another, Draco sighing softly. "you are a sore loser." Before cupping his cheeks and pulling him back into a kiss. Merlin, he was just as smitten as Harry is. It was clear in his eyes, so why must Draco always get the upper hand? He cannot lose to him. Not even in this. So keeping his lips occupied his hands roamed, sliding from his shoulder down to his ribcage, smirking when the blond whimpered against his lips. He was so sensitive. So delicious. This feat will surely be explored later, when they will have a little bit more privacy. But for now Harry used what he could reach for, meaning that Draco's lower back is to be thoroughly explored. Untucking Draco's button up Harry's hand snuck past the fabric until he met soft skin, running his fingers over it as the blond gasped sharply, breaking the kiss momentarily before pulling him back in. His back was smooth and oh so warm, Harry could probably melt into him if he kept this any longer. His hand slid down slowly like candle wax until it met the coarse fabric of Draco's pants and before he knew it he was squeezing Draco's arse, some kind of paper crunching beneath his palm.
. Potter's eyes widened before narrowing again, his brows curled into a frown. “I'm not dramatic, also, who said I'd let you top me?”  Draco felt like slamming his head into a wall,his cheeks definitely red now. “I can't believe we're having this conversation!” he said, and Potter had the
Perhaps each friendship should start with a splash of water.
“Sugar?”
An act of desperation
Why Neville was picked for Gryffindor? The answer is simple, his bravery is not showcased in loud acts and unforgettable fights, even though he cried a lot,feared everything, Draco realized:
Who's better than me at posting updates at 1AM??? Probably everyone.
So what brought these creatures to him? Could Malfoy even see them? or was he just bearing with the weight?
Hermione hummed, tucking a curly lock of hair behind her ear, nodding before she took a step forward, grabbing Harry's arm “okay let's go”  her actions really took him by surprise, he stared back at her bouncy bush of her hair wide eyed as she made her way towards the Slytherins, he said that he
“Nice earrings” Harry caught himself saying, “Thanks!” Luna smiled at him softly “they are made of a first year's broken glasses” now when he looks at them, he does notice a thin frame around the glass pieces “oh.” He gaped, poor student.
He thought, but Malfoy could not hear his pleas, they were all in his head after all.  “You always have to be pure, dirty your magic with forbidden spells but not failure, no, failure is unacceptable.”
“I didn't know you could play the piano.” Harry said, after the Solus disappeared Malfoy had no intention of staying in the burned room. He let his fingers linger on the milky colored keys for mere seconds before stroding off with a quick pace, and in a loss of what to do, Harry followed. They ended up seated on the green grass right by the dark lake, Malfoy being curled up to himself, his head hanging between his knees with a few platinum blonde strands falling on top of his face. Malfoy just shrugged, his shoulders quirking up as he did so. “My mother taught me how to play when I was little” he admitted, the air was still tense between them, Harry had no idea why Malfoy wanted him, of all people, to be the one to see him in such a vulnerable state. Harry didn't deserve it, not to hear Malfoy playing nor to see how Crabbe had shown him his farewell, he never had the right to see how beautiful to Solus were when they bloomed, not after all he said.
them you know?” She looked at her boyfriend with sheer disappointment, and then sighed, realizing everyone are looking at her dumbfounded. “Wait, you've never made a pie before? Like, ever?” She stared, Draco felt an uncomfortable twist in his stomach “uh…no?” He said, realizing that he and Potter said that in unison, both sparing a look at each other before turning back to Hermione, who frowned “you mean your mother never taught you how to make apple pie?” Potter grimaced, his gaze dropping to Ron's half eaten plate “er..” he mumbled, and Hermione clasped her hands over her mouth, gasping “oh Harry I didn't mean to- and you Draco?” She turned to him in a desperate attempt to fix the situation, he swallowed hard, noticing Pansy smirking at him. “Um, well, my mother never really used the kitchen...house elves cooked for us…” he mumbled suddenly feeling embarrassed of his heritage, which he shouldn't do, why would he? His life was filled with gifts and chocolates with plenty of money to spare of course they had house elves- his mother is a noble woman, at least she would be still, if her husband hadn't been a death eater and thrown to rot in jail. Hermione's frown turned into a glare, seems like house elves is a sensitive topic for her, Merlin, it's so hard to communicate with Gryffindors.
Hermione nodded again. “And cut them up afterwards.”
“Why did you let me come?” Harry asked, meeting Malfoy's eyes for the first time after they left, the blond boy looked clouded, as if he'd debating whether he should tell him about his reasons or not, it seems like he decided on the positive, since he answered; “I couldn't go back there alone, I tried..” Malfoy choked up, taking a shaky breath before continuing “I… I felt like you'd understand, since you were the one to save me and all… seemed appropriate.” Harry hummed, dropping his gaze at his now dirty hands. “I know you said you wouldn't help me anymore, sorry for dragging you into this again.” Malfoy said, making Harry look back at him “no! no.. don't apologise… I should be the one doing so, it's just-” just what? It just him not bothering to deal with his problems properly since it always worked out in the end? Honestly, Harry didn't know, and that only made him feel more guilty. “I'm truly sorry Malfoy” he tried desperately, remembering his decision to try again, not because he had to, but since he himself wished to do so. Draco looked at him for a long while before he reached for his back and grabbed a feisty Solus which screeched in his hands, and before Harry could form a question, he had been hit by a fur ball that felt like a fucking
Draco froze, thinking whether he should brush it off as a joke, but Potter's glare was determined, he was totally serious. “Potter please, muggles are-”
He decided to sketch them, pulling out some new parchment and dipping his quill, Harry began sketching a sloppy black figure: they were small, about a size of a cat, with bright white eyes that could pierce through steel if they wanted, four large ears, the same amount of legs, long and slightly unproportionate next to their unusually little body, their face was flat,the end of their thin tails was fluffy, and they looked more iridescent than they were black
“Cut them up?! Are you mental? I will slice my finger off!” Now she was one one rolling her eyes, grabbing Malfoy by the shoulders and turning him sharply towards the basket, giving him a light slap on the nape, making him flinch. “Oh you will alright, you chop things for potions just fine.”
Oh, oh right.
You must destroy all the evidence about our meeting during the Triwizarding Tournament.
He should try again, Luna's speech gave him a hint, these Solus do appear for a reason, if he can find why, getting rid of them should be easy right? Malfoy may be frustrated now, but he will be calmer soon, and Harry will approach him, offer him help again as many times as he can until the prideful Slytherin gives in, Harry dealt with difficult people before and if he managed to give Kreacher in, he could win Malfoy over easily.
“I can see them” he said, Draco did not get him at first, but his heart dropped dead on the floor when realization hit him,of course, how could he forget this burdening weight? Draco gaped at him, trying to appear clueless even though the creature is digging its nails into his nape, Potter went on “I know you can see them too,the creatures” Draco dropped his gaze, Potter
He never noticed how much he needed that.
"Yeah, and what's the occasion? A posh blond." Ron snorted. "He doesn't care what you smell like, I bet he would get in your pants even if you wore nothing but your stinky Quidditch gear." Harry turned sharply at that, his cheeks flushing. "First of all it's not stinky! Second of all-" truth is, he had nothing to say to his defense, so his deliberate voice quickly turned into a mumble. "We are late for class.."
“Why are you asking Harry?” Ginny poked his cheek, smiling softly “I can see a black creature bullying him” Harry said, making his friends turn and stare in Malfoy's direction shamelessly, after all they've been through they knew better than to call Harry a madman  for seeing things only he could see
“Two please”
Through guilt and hope, new starts bloom.
Maybe Malfoy didn't deserve to be here, perhaps he deserved to be locked up like his father, but still, he was there, right in front of him
That's what he told himself.
Normally, if you'd meet Harry before the war, he'd turn around and leave Malfoy to his misery, but suddenly, he couldn't
Getting tired of the silence, Harry broke it; “are you going to use the spell?” He asked, his mind drifting back to their earlier conversation with McGonagall, a part of him truly wishing Malfoy would never come around to actually
The platform was flooded with chattering students, with Hogwarts Express kindly waiting for all the students to return, Draco felt his mother's grip on his shoulder, clearly reading through his nerves “I will be fine” he mumbled, smiling at his mother weakly, tears flooded her blue eyes and she pulled Draco in into a lung crushing hug, even though she's way smaller than her now grown son, she still was a strong woman.
And with a soft light, the parchment weaved itself back together until it was whole again. Without thinking he threw his wand aside, yanking the parchment and reading through it again.
Am I dead? Who knows.
“Oh come on man, what's wrong?”  Ron leaned onto the table, exploring Harry's expression carefully, Harry sighed and put down his wand, turning around to face his friend “I met Draco in the toilet” Ron rose an eyebrow at him, suddenly smirking “ooooOoooOooohh… did you-”
Also I had a lot of falling offs with my friends and significant others, And the change is so sharp it will take some getting used to.
Were they heavy? Could Malfoy deal with them? Not that Harry cared about Malfoy in particular, he'd rather not associate with him at all, he's a death eater, a criminal, but Harry found out that he didn't have the urge to hit him like the others did, he found that he doesn't hate Draco Malfoy, when did it start? When Harry stopped being utterly annoyed by his presence? No, he was definitely still annoyed, but Draco didn't bother him as much anymore, after the war Harry matured, he had no patience for rival games anymore
“Even if it's Malfoy” He agreed.
Not only that, but he also felt disoriented and incredibly warm. His eyes opened slowly, blinking a few times while two thoughts occurred to him: this wasn't his bed nor his common room.
“Dumbledore, was one of the most amazing wizards to set foot in this world, especially this school, he truly was, a marvelous man” McGonagall finished her cup, placing it on the table “and he was incredibly forgiving, for those who wanted a chance.” Draco frowned at her, what does Dumbledore have to do with this? The bloke is dead, and it's Draco's fault.
heavy pile of books to run after her “professor wait!” He panted heavily as he reached her at the end of the hallway, following her footsteps in a quick pace “what did you mean by that?” He tried hard to keep looking at her, but the creatures found a perfect timing to climb on his face and tug at his hair during the time his hands are occupied, bloody hell, but McGonagall didn't answer, instead she just reached the headmistress office door instead, whispering 'apple cider’ for the Gryffin door to reveal it's magnificent stairs “come” she murmured as she already walked up the stairs and Draco helplessly followed, his hands hurting horribly, who would ever lift such weight from their own accord? Draco held himself back from whining, which he failed when he realized they had to go up an another set of stairs.
And a part of Harry felt like he was slipping, just for a moment. Right through his fingers. A drifting smoke just like a Solus in bloom. For a moment Harry wished it hadn't made him as nervous as he did.
By the way guys if you like my pain inducing stories you should totally read my Webtoon "Cruel But Beautiful", it's wack.
Draco always wondered how Neville Longbottom ended up a Gryffindor, his whiny and weak demeanor always made him look like he was cut out to be a Hufflepuff, nothing about his teary eyes and shaky knees was brave, he was just there, as if the sorting hat made some kind of a mistake, always out of place, always so easy to pick on,  bullying Longbottom had always been a blast, especially Potter's angry reaction to that afterwards, but now, the war painted a different person in front of him, the Longbottom he saw now was strong, sitting right here next to him made Draco feel so...small.
“You looked really hurt, so I thought I'd grab you something” Longbottom murmured, dropping a wrapped up piece in his hands, Draco stared at it thunderstruck, his eyes moving back to the Gryffindor boy “what the fuck?” He whimpered, his voice broken and raspy “just eat it.” The Gryffindor sounded colder than he looked, his expression slightly uncomfortable, yet eyes warm and worrying
Boy do I love disappearing for a year and then coming back with a chapter, sorry guys. This has been the hardest year of my life, I went and I’m  still going through so much changes. I write  this fanfic to cheer myself up, as twisted as it may seem with the amount of angst and existential crisis this fic provides.
The both of them just stood there. At least there was one thing they could always be similar at, they don't know how to talk about important things such as their feelings, and very much prefer just standing there, getting angry at their problems instead of solving them.
A thing clicked inside of Draco as he let his gaze follow Harry's locking on a mark of his own.
Even doubt

He just hoped that if he slipped, it would be where Harry could follow.
“Well, I certainly do not feel I made any mistakes” McGonagall said, lifting her cup again before drinking it “Hogwarts is your home,just like the other students”
Eighth years shared all their lessons together, making each period a practical mess, their classroom filled up quickly, Draco has taken his seat in the back of the class long before everyone arrived from breakfast, well, since he skipped it.
“just leave me alone!” Draco snapped, slapping her hand away, she pulled back her face curling into pure anger
“How can you be so calm about it?!” Draco snapped, his grip tightening “do you know what I've done?!*
“Your mother loves you.” Harry said at last, remembering how the woman defined Voldemort, lying right to his face for a mere chance to see her son, While Lucius risked his whole family for power, Narcissa Malfoy was ready to lose everything in order to keep her family safe. Draco softened at that, his shoulders relaxing slightly “I know..” he mumbled, pushing his knees tighter onto his chest, perhaps thinking about his mother alone in muggle London, well, at least that's what Hermione had told him after reading the prophet one day, telling him something about the Malfoy manor being taken away when Lucius was arrested. Harry wondered how the boy felt about that, but this wasn't his question to ask.

“We shouldn't fall so low!” His voice echoed through the hall “ we just survived a
I BEEN WAITING TO WRITE THIS CHAPTER FOR BLOODY TWO YEARS!!! TWO YEARS OF MY LIFE FOR THESE FOOLS TO FINALLY KISS OH MY GOD.
Malfoy let out a shaky breath, pinching the bridge of his nose  “honest to god Potter I want to bloody
Draco stared back at himself,he was flooding, drowning in dismay with each tear sliding down his worn out face, when did he start crying? Putting his hands down onto the sink in hope to keep himself stable, he crumbled down with the weight on his shoulder, desperately holding onto the sink while his body was curled up on the floor, loud cries echoing through the room, he hated this, these forsaken walls, those people who looked like they knew him, he hated himself, wheezing and screaming in the bathroom that was way too familiar, only two years ago he was here, crying, scared for his life, turns out nothing changed much, since he was still falling apart on the same cold floor, when each day feels like stepping on sharp needless tearing his pale skin apart revealing dark, cruel red, with a shaky hand he grabbed his sleeve and lifted it, revealing his ugly death mark, he hated this mark the most.
Sharing an uncertain look with Zabini, Parkinson reached out for the hand and grabbed it, silently nodding.
“Why me?” he said before Draco finished the sentence “that's the only thing I want to know.” Neville took a step forward, his apathetic expression turning angry “why, out of all the people you could make miserable- you chose me?”. His throat went dry, how is he to explain himself? Neville has always been the weakest link, a tiny whiny little boy who couldn't defend himself against anyone. He has to admit bullying Neville has made him feel…powerful. “I- I had a hard time, back then.” he said simply, but Neville just frowned “oh I've heard all about it. Those creatures on your back or something, giving you a hard time! How interesting. Draco Malfoy starts caring about the people around him only when he starts suffering!”  that's not true, he wanted to say, to shout even. How dare he accuse me of such things when I'm trying to apologise? Draco wondered to himself, gritting his teeth to the sight of the angry Gryffindor. The Solus on his back hissed loudly, making this overall experience a huge headache, taking a deep breath he tried again. “Listen.. my father abused me okay?” He felt a shiver run down his neck, but he went on “I was angry so I took it out on people! I'm different now.” He said, not entirely believing it.
She might've found out Draco skipped all his classes today, perhaps she came to scold him, or even worse, send him home, which he wouldn't mind honestly, Hogwarts is far from being a safe place for him now.
Yay! Romione date next update! I've been wanting to write this part ever since I thought about writing this story a year ago, I'm excited to hear what you think!
“Oh..”
"Only because I'm dealing with a brat." Harry answered easily, his mood immediately lifting with the knowledge that he wasn't the source of Malfoy's discomfort. But.. if it wasn't him, what happened?
I am sending you this letter with his House Elf, you must burn it right after you read it.
“I hate you!!” He shouted, feeling familiar fangs clutch into his shoulder, “I hate you!!” weight pulling him down into the floor, maybe if he will cry hard enough
I know I'm jumping between humor and angst but that's what I like, I feel like this fanfic is really bittersweet and kind of real? For my feelings at least.
“Woah you really got beat did you?”  Blaise’s dark skin contrasted beautifully with the white window he was leaning on, his arms folded over his chest, Draco scanned him, his eyes stopping on the green Slytherin tie, Draco looked at his own and smirked before tying it on himself too.
“What are you doing in my bed?” Draco hissed, keeping his voice low even though they were the only ones there.  The boy shrugged, shifting closer “let me sleep with you please” he said, sounding just as uncomfortable as he looked like. Draco just stared at him for a long, long minute, trying to understand whether the chosen one is joking or really wants to get killed.
You know what to do.
“What did you do.” Harry stared at Ron blankly, his friends groaned “I didn't do anything!!! H-Hermione I really like you like-”
Heyo guys! Sorry for the wait! I've been writing this chapter for a while until I realized that it was getting too long so I cut it a bit shorter and divided it into two updates, so this one is a bit shorter than usual since that's the only point that looked okay to stop the chapter on.
“He was crying” Harry cut him off before he said something stupid, Ron closed his mouth firmly, forming a thin line
Running his eyes around the great hall, Draco's gaze locked on a messy curly hair surrounded by two annoying redhead and a literal bush of hair- Harry Potter.
When they
But god, has he missed these halls, the halls they all grew up in, the halls some of their friends had to make their grave.
Enjoy the chapter and please comment your thoughts it makes me so happy!
“oh my oh my!” Slughorn groaned, picking up the broken pieces with a flick of his wand “Mr. Malfoy what are you doing? did you slip up?” if Draco knew what he was doing he wouldn't shatter the cauldron in the first place, perhaps the stupid old teacher couldn't quite grasp that, but Draco didn’t say anything, his angry gaze locked onto the black creature walking around the floor just where the shards have been, their wide white eyes piercing through Draco’s soul, crippling fear caught his throat, making it hard to breathe, please leave me alone, please leave me alone,please leave me alone his mind repeated in desperate hope those agonising creatures could hear him, could let him go, everything around him seemed to turn black, the creatures tail messing with his sight, he was being watched from every side, from every corner eyes heavy and burdening, please, please anything but those judging eyes-
He should show this sketch to Hermione, maybe research a little bit, perhaps there will be something about these creatures in the library, he could ask Hagrid as well, he missed the man anyway, wouldn't hurt to pay him a visit.
“More of an annoyance, really.”
Their road to platform nine and three quarters was carefully painted with the countless footsteps every aspiring witch or wizard that ever went there, to Hogwarts, the magical place
Choking on his tears, Draco finished his sandwich.
- he could still remember how their weight felt, and now he knows what caused them, yet, somehow, knowing the cause doesn't really make it better, but rather more familiar of a feeling: more bearable.
could one truly start over? would it take a slap on the face?
Without saying anything else, McGonagall strode down the hall for Draco to follow, he stumbled behind the graceful woman, creatures pulling down his pants with their weight, thank Merlin he's wearing a belt.
“a thing?”
Potter.
right into his face.

Can one truly be forgiven, after ruining someone's life?
He remembered his lessons with Dumbledore, telling him that Voldemort was created from a man who had no love, no heart, what if leaving Malfoy like that will create an another Voldemort? Harry rubbed his scar, kind of instinctually, it didn't throb like it used to when he who must not be named was alive, but Harry remembered the pain clearly.
She completely ignored him however, telling them how they need to mix the ingredients in a bowl and then pour some flour on the table, kneading the dough before it all sticks together and becomes rather elastic. “Hermione my hand hurtsss” Draco sighed dramatically in the background, his other hand displayed against his forehead dramatically as if he's some damsel in distress. Harry snickered as she slapped his hand “Merlin's beard Malfoy you're so annoying.” She said, leaving Ron and him to deal with the dough themselves. She didn't go far however, leading Malfoy just across the table and finally letting go of his hand, Draco let out a cry of triumph holding his hand out as if he almost had it cut out, his happiness quickly fading when with a heavy thud, a basket full of apples was placed in front of him. “You my dear, are going to peel the apples.” Hermione said, handing Malfoy a knife. If Harry would've guessed he'd say at this point Draco was seeing white, since he gaped at the knife in his hands with pure horror “w-what?” He muttered, shooting Hermione a terrified look “you mean...all of these..?” He pointed at the basket, Hermione nodded smugly. “You better be thankful, I knew you wouldn't dirty yourself to save your life, so i didn't give you anything to do with flour.”
“Shut up Draco, I thought we were friends.” Harry said, pushing the paper bag into his arms, Draco gasped and almost dropped all of it's insides  catching it in his hands clumsily. His head jerked up angrily “I thought this was your bag?!” Harry smirked “not anymore” and started making his way towards their table. “Wha-” he was about to complain, but realized that he was left alone with the two elves with all of his friends already halfway to their workplace. Draco snapped his mouth shut, giving the small pair a confused glare, as if he's unsure of how to act so he just returns to his natural state: being a dick.
And that's what peace supposed to feel like, it should be kind, calm and reassuring, especially after the long dangerous war.
“Like what?” She spat at him, oh boy, Weasley just dug his own grave, visibly swallowing, Ron looked at Harry for help,who shook his head defensively, he might have dated two girls in his life but it sure didn't help him understand woman, all Ron needed to do is to tell her how much he loves her, something nice, it's not too hard, but again it is Ron Weasley we're talking about.
Now Malfoy was laughing, a full, heartfelt laugh “woah, you trust me? Isn't that too quick for you arch nemesis?” He teased, Harry let out an exasperated huff, so Malfoy didn't accept his offer, geez, what a way to reject someone, guess he's still bitter about being rejected in his first year. Malfoy groaned, offering a hand “quit moaning Potter, didn't you ever get pranked? That's what friends do” Harry looked up so quickly his vision blurred for a second, now he stared at the hand Malfoy was offering, a smirk tugging on his lips “and you're calling me a menace?” He reached up, his cold hand taking a warmer one, water dripping down his skin. Harry's smirk widened, Draco Malfoy is a fool.
“Oh goodness!” Hermione laughed out, quickly reaching for her wand and casting dittany. “There you go, blood's gone, now go back to peeling.” It was clearly a tease, but Malfoy got so worked up over it, muttering all about muggle nonsense and stupid apple pies, Harry hadn't really listened.
“Please” Potter said, treating him like some kind of a small animal. Draco didn't want to, he won't show it even if he'll be begged to. “It's proof that he's dead.”  His gray eyes shot open quickly, widening as he met Harry's gaze. The eyes that once were only looking at Draco with pure hate, the same look he'd give the dark lord, they were soft now, pleading, asking for permission. Just like him, Potter had been afraid. He needs proof that the person that ruined his life is really dead, and Draco, as foolish as it is, gave up for him.
It's strange to say, but he has gotten used to Draco's temper, and the git would always skip lunch when he was upset. It's weird, being familiar with his routines and habits. It made Harry feel closer to him, and the worry in his chest tightened. Was it their kiss? Did Harry do something wrong? He couldn't sit in his seat. He saw a blonde head from down the hallway, but when he made his way towards him Draco magically disappeared. So he's either very busy, which he shouldn't be. Or he's avoiding Harry.
in the middle of breakfast wasn't helpful, Draco understood that he's the only one seeing them, hearing his footsteps loudly echoing through the hall, he stopped, surroundings himself with uncomfortable silence.
And on that sweet fucking note (again.) , the group dissolved agreeing that it's an issue for an another day. Draco was glad to escape the library, spending so much time in there was suffocating especially with the weird tense air that has been going on between him and Potter. Did something happen? Draco wondered. Shooting glances at the Gryffindor throughout their whole meeting, Potter seemed to be strictly avoiding his gaze,  perhaps he's imagining things, he and Potter had been exchanging notes just a couple hours ago, and it was fun! Then what's wrong? Deciding that thinking about the burdening weight on his back would be too heavy for now (literally) he approached Harry.
Harry was laughing out loud at this point, seeing Draco struggling like that is truly a blast. When he turned to Ron however, he noticed that his friend was not having a good time at all. “They get along well don't they?” Ron muttered so just Harry could hear, he frowned “what are you talking about?”. His friend poured the flour into a bowl, but his motions were more violent than they needed to be. “Malfoy duh, all intelligent and up to his ass.” Harry gaped at him, his ginger brows were furrowed angrily with an intense glare aimed at the pair. “Ron.” Harry grabbed him by the shoulder “Hermione loves you mate, why would she need Malfoy?” This really didn't make any sense in his head, out of all the people he knew he would never even think that Draco and Hermione would work out together, they're just so.. not right for each other, Hermione liked Ron ever since she knew him, Harry honestly couldn't name a more perfect pair. They fight a lot sure, but they survived a war together, stayed together even though it had been hard. Unlike Harry and Ginny who couldn't handle an another person's problem together with themselves. “I don't know, he reads books and shit, clearly doesn't need help with potions.” Ron whispered angrily, slicing the butter into cubes even though Harry was sure he imagined someone else under his knife. Harry's frown deepened and he followed Ron's glare coming to a sight: Hermione peeking over Draco's shoulder as he pathetically attempted to peel apples, his hands clumsily either cutting too deep or nothing at all.
with Parkinson, but most definitely not befriend her.
He's not. Harry thought, remembering their time together. But then he hesitated, maybe he did do something to piss Draco off. "I've seen him in our dorm today, he's been looking kinda pale" Blaise said, smirking slightly when Harry looked at him expectantly. "He didn't say much, I assumed he didn't want to talk."
And they have a dirty history together, unresolved rivalry that never died down, when Malfoy wasn't sending hexed in his direction, he was cursing and shaming him with everything he got, using any given chance to knock Harry down
It was dark.
“My ass could've saved itself!!”
"If there is a brat between the two of us, that would most certainly be you." Draco cocked his head, keeping his nose high as if to shove his poshness right into his face, Harry would be annoyed if he didn't like the sight of Draco's exposed throat this much. "Yeah?" With a burst of Gryffindor courage, and maybe the desperate need to shut a git up, Harry stepped sideways easily pushing Draco right against the nearest wall. His soft gasp echoed across the empty hall, gray eyes wide with astonishment. "Harry what are you-" he whispered, but Harry didn't bother telling him, he showed him instead. Leaning in Harry pressed his body against the other teen, their lips meeting midway as Harry continued what he didn't get enough of yesterday. It was silent, as if the whole building held its breath, only to be broken when Draco's hands gave way. Letting his books clash loudly at their feet his hands reached to pull on Harry's robes, pulling him closer. From there, it was all but quiet gasps and frenzied movements. Following Draco's lead Harry abandoned his books in order to run his hands all over Draco's sides, feeling his ribcage through the fabric of his button up. It was hot, it was bewitching. As if pink lips against pale skin pulled Harry under some powerful spell, and he didn't even bother try resisting it.
could one become good after many years of learning not to?
maybe if he shouts loud enough, they will.
The other was tall and lanky, and there was great status and wisdom in his stance. His eyes looked like storm clouds, and they were swarming with pride. His pale hands rested on a delicate cane, and he looked like safety, he looked like home.
“Look how far they are” Harry didn't look at her, so she shifted her gaze to look in the same direction, eyes locking on the small green pack, she stared for a long minute before sighing, her face visibly softened when she turned back to Harry “you think it's the creatures?”
“Maybe we miss them” Harry said, sharing knowing looks with the two “yeah, maybe we do, so we're desperately searching for something unusual to do” Ron's freckles danced around his face as his lips curved into a sly smile “even if it's Malfoy”
He tightened his grip around his hand
Lord have mercy, haven't he suffered enough? “Stop. Just stop.” He begged, Potter quirked a single eyebrow. “You sure dude?I thought Drake suited you pretty well.”
My cat has been diagnosed with severe anemia and was on the brick of death this week. He is my best friend and I hope he makes it through.
“I don't even like sweets.” He stated when Hermione pulled out the steaming pastry out of the oven, placing it on the counter to cool. It smelled great yes, with all the butter and sugar that went into this thing how could it not? But after putting so much effort into something he doesn't even get to eat all the bruises on his hands suddenly feel worthless. “Well then.” She gave him a long and disappointed look, casting a quick cooling spell before cutting into the thing, destroying the pretty crust she had put so much effort in. “One of the things about food is that you could also give it to someone important.” She cut out a neat slice and placed it on a plate then handed it to Draco. “How about you give it to someone? Sharing something you made actually feels really nice.” She said, cutting out slices for herself and the other two morons, who right now tried to beg the house elves for tea.
“We came back to school, it has been hard, but let's not make it harder, make it a happy year..Please”
everytime he felt like a madman Luna was always there to guide him with her colorful bracelets and weird creativity, her soft gaze reading Harry like an open book, Luna was truly something marvellous, painting her own life in such bright colors so she would never get lonely, he felt himself smile kindly at her “ do you think what i’m seeing is real?”
“So my father taught me not to fail.” Malfoy said, flinching at his own words. “He taught me to sit tight, and master my spells, to perfect my movements, because Malfoys are allowed nothing but perfection.” A memory flashed in front of his eyes, how he's seen Malfoy and his father at the beginning of his second year at Hogwarts, how tense little Draco was around his own father, it all made sense, all fell together and yet, Harry couldn't bear admitting the truth.
Saying his goodbyes to Luna, Harry went off towards his Herbology lesson, if he remembers correctly, they share this lesson with the Slytherins, when he thinks about it, most of his lessons are shared with Slytherins this year, which is understandable considering how little of them returned, Harry was surprised Malfoy returned at all, but perhaps running around the school searching for his parents does not count as a war crime so he could return and finish his year at Hogwarts. Noticing a familiar bush of hair, Harry smiled widely when he found his friends already waiting next to the greenhouse, Hermione's back facing Harry, making her hair look like a floating poodle, Ron was standing in front of her, they were talking about something Harry failed to hear “hey guys” he shamelessly put himself into their conversation, they're his best friends after all, him taking a part of all the conversation was part of the 'harry Potter pack’ and the shop has no return policies.
“I thought that- that it would soothe him too..” Malfoy's voice turned quieter, and Harry needed no explanation to know who he was talking about. Vincent Crabbe had died in horrible flames, his screams still visiting him in his dreams, Harry was the one to fly Malfoy out of that place, only to follow him back inside a year later.
me? writing fluff? what?
Harry thought while coughing violently, feeling his lungs clench in pain, well fuck, he really is going to die.
“Snape was a death eater as well, and oh did he suffer, you should know” McGonagall stared him dead in the eye, yet her expression was soft and caring  “I would want you to talk with him”
“What brought you here today? How's lessons?” he cupped the hot drink in his hands, sipping loudly  “they're nice” Harry took a sip himself, recalling all the boring lessons he had this week, Hagrid hummed, placing his now empty tea cup on his small wooden table  “Actually, we wanted to ask you something” Hermione said, placing her cup on her thighs, Hagrid looked at them sheer curiosity in his eyes, she continued “Harry has been seeing things lately, we think it's a kind of spirit” Hagrid’s eyes wandered between the three of them, carefully listening
He nodded politely, standing up and brushing off his own robes before he turned his attention back to the headmistress, lowering his gaze apologetically as her gaze pierced through his entire being.
Merlin what a day. He had a breakdown, missed a bunch of lessons as he stayed in his room sleeping out all the crying he did yesterday, thinking whether he wants to strangle Potter or himself, (in the end he did strangle him, ah, the sweet, sweet taste of revenge.) Then that talk with McGonagall gave him so much hope before it all crashed and burned. What's the point of telling someone the solution if they can't use it? Deep inside he knew that McGonagall suggested using the spell as a last resort, a second option not many are given in life, and as kind as the headmistress is, Draco could never use her offer. It's just too much, experiencing the things that created the Solus once again, he doesn't even know what kind of things cause them, and after two Solus blooming; one during a quidditch game and the other in a room where one of his friends died, he honestly didn't want to know.
Pansy just stood there, eyes wide and mouth open, Zabini stepped in front of her “what's the catch? Why do you care so suddenly?” His voice was sharp and defensive, his tall figure landing shadow on Hermione's face, creating some sort of invisible barrier Harry was unsure he could get through, the Slytherins suddenly felt so out of reach, yet they all grew up together in this castle, loving and hurting, laughing and crying, all desperately trying to fit in but give up in the second their house is assigned and all the others boo at them and the only friends you have are the ones sharing your house color, Harry bit his lip, his gaze dropping to the floor “I know Malfoy has been acting weird lately” he said, focusing the attention on himself “i might know why, but we can't help if we're at each other's throats”
Even visiting the room of requirement again was surreal, he couldn't go near there through the whole year but only now, with Potter by his side, he felt like he got the courage, which is totally stupid, since Potter was angry at him at the moment and yet he still followed him there, even comforted him for fucks sake.
Draco quickly pulled his pajama shirt on, a silk long sleeved nightshirt so long it could work as a dress, while he might’ve used it as a night dress when he was little, he isn't as shameless now.  “You commented on how I always wear only my house colors, while you are wearing red boxers yourself. That's why you're a hypocrite.” He finally turned to face Potter, who still stared openly at his wrist as if trying to understand what exactly happened there, his mouth hanging open. When he noticed Draco was watching him he snapped it shut however, careful green eyes fixating on his face, even though Draco could clearly see them snapping back to his hand every couple of seconds. “I- I'm not a hypocrite! I'm sure all of your underwear is green.”
For a moment everyone just stared at each other, Weasley slowly chewing a mouthful of gravy, hoping no one will notice. Hermione coughed awkwardly “anyway. I'm in such a mood for apple pie!” She exclaimed, smiling to herself warmly from the memory. “Well, there's pie here” Ron said after he swallowed “speaking of-” he reached over the platter and grabbed himself a slice, or two, and kept eating. “I know.. but like.. I miss
Draco rubbed at his temple, wondering how Granger managed to spend 7 years with this walking headache.  “Look Potter it's not like I'm going to fuck you there, don't be so fucking dramatic.” He wanted to slap him, and then himself, and also cut his tongue off for saying such a
being completely torn apart.
Hope you enjoyed this chapter! I really like making apple pies, but I never eat them because I don't like the texture of baked apples:( it is nice to make others happy though.
Hands.
“I-” Draco said “I don't know okay?! How muggles even tattoo people?”
Harry looked around himself, his heart dropping from the sight, young slytherins who had never took a part in grown up’s wars were standing behind the crowd shaking in fear, tucking their green ties deep into their robe pockets, hiding the shameful slytherin color, the same color that was now stained crimson by Malfoy’s blood.
"Repero."
“How do you think they will call us today?” Draco whined, yanking his blanket off a bit too aggressively so those little shits jumped away, they did, but one of them actually bit Draco, he hissed loudly throwing that thing off his bed
“I think he's possessed by some sort of creature, making him aggressive”Parkinson stared at him analyzing his reply “and you can help?”
Right, he and Potter are now friends, he would be embarrassed to admit how happy this actually made him, he had to throw Potter into the lake just so his stomach would stop fluttering.
his throat became the moment he saw him, how his breath actually hitched, which made the whole situation a lot more exasperating. “You're aware we have lessons tomorrow right? That I actually need to
“Wait- Malfoy what are you doing?!” Potter whined, applying no force to actually resist him. “Taking you to my common room” Draco said simply, not having the patience to deal with his whining when Potter stopped sharply,  almost making Draco trip over his own feet.
The proud woman stood before him, her hands folded neatly behind her back, her iconic bun pulling her hair so tight it might actually show her skull, she was wearing a beautiful olive colored velvet robes, matched with a witch hat, she looked at Draco just like she looked at everyone, with her nose pointed high as if it's a given that she is certainly better than everyone, which is true.
“This song…” Malfoy continued, lifting his chin just enough so it would rest on his knee, gray eyes mirroring the dark waters, the sky had already turned pink having the lake reflect today's last rays of sunshine. “It's a lullaby she used to sing to me… in order to calm me down after a nightmare.” Honestly Harry would never imagine that Draco Malfoy, a man raised by two rich wizards would ever have nightmares nor a single worry in his life. He didn't sleep in a cupboard under the stairs, growing up in great halls and marble floors instead, never had Malfoy known hunger or cold, his parents were alive and well, the Dark Lord didn't kill them by the mere age of 21, not ever getting the chance to send their son off to Hogwarts, a school both of them grew up and fell in love in. But after seeing Malfoy fall apart in the room of requirement like that, Harry knew for sure that even when you have money and breathing parents, nightmares will hunt you down as well.  Harry picked on a handful of grass, finding that he didn't quite know what to do with himself, so he plucked a bunch out, watching as numerous bugs scattered away from the rude invader of their grass home. “Why did you choose to sing it now?” Harry found himself asking, not daring to look up at the blond. “a funny thing isn't it?” Malfoy let out a humourless laugh “she sang it to me after calming down my father, and just when the screaming downstairs settled, she would come and soothe me with a hoarse voice.” Harry didn't say anything, he felt like he had no place in Malfoy's story, so he let him talk.
