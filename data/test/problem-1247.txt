He locked eyes with him, letting the certainty, pain and knowledge that he had shine in them. Not actually allowing Legilimency, he wasn’t that desperate yet, but what was in his eyes seemed like enough.
‘You can’t! You swore you’d protect him.’ He couldn’t let him just walk away, he still needed him, Harry still needed him.
They slid into the room, Greg and Vince as calm as anything, grinning at their success in their mission and knowing they had the Golden Trio cornered. Draco almost doubled over, clutching at his chest to try to control his breathing, his hands shaking. The first time he’d come out of the battle the one good thing he could say was that he wasn’t a murderer. A few hours on the side of light and that claim was taken away from him. Fuck! He had to be stronger than that to keep moving though. This moment was important. He could hear the movement of the other three searching the room, but better than that, he remembered where they’d found Potter.
‘Hold it, Potter.’ His voice came out more stable than he’d expected, thank Merlin for small mercies.
‘Okay, fine. Bored or nervous?’ Harry caved, they were the only two reasons he’d heard Malfoy rambling in here, he liked to think he’d gotten good at reading him.
Potter’s face fell, he was disappointed, or maybe even upset at the response? He refused to take it back though. Staying with Severus would be a giant improvement. It would be safe, normal, give him a second to get his feet under him. If that was an option
Harry swerved again as the serpent lunged at him; Draco leaning with him with a practiced ease to shift the broom exactly where they needed it. They soared upward and straight toward the place where, the new door stood open. Harry saw the rectangular patch on the wall and steered the broom at it, and moments later they were in clean air, they could breathe again and they collided with the wall in the corridor beyond.
‘I virtually lived in the Room of Hidden Things all last year,’ his voice was just as brittle and pained as the first time he’d said it. ‘I know how to get in.’
He – the him stuck in the past – had to fight the war, had to survive the outcome, was probably missing Potter?!
This one was a bit different to my usual style. Please let me know if you enjoyed it and if I should put up some more short ones! It was fun <3
The Aurors that led him weren’t gentle. They prodded him along with the tips of their wands and one or two well placed Stinging Hexes when he stumbled. Just a little bit long, just keep walking. He knew the halls well, he worked here for almost two years now, they probably wouldn’t like hearing that either.
He grit his teeth, casting a wordless silencing charm around him, thanking Merlin that the Hogwarts wards had already fallen as he Apparated to a hidden corner of the room. He’d made Harry show him this memory, he’d needed those final moments of his godfather … now they were more useful than ever. He knew where to hide, he knew what to expect. He might be too late to save him, but at least he was here to try.
Slightly charred around the edges, but it was cold when he touched it. If there was once a fire on the other side, it was out by now.
He wasn’t sure how long it was of throwing shields over his shoulder and flinging out any curse that came to mind at whoever was attacking him. He wasn’t sure which side he was fighting against most of the time. As long as they weren’t the one he was hunting for and they didn’t have orange hair, he really didn’t care who got hit by his spell. Blaise seemed to fling out his with even less concern for who it hit.
‘Have you decided what you’re going to study yet? I know McGonagall said we could still swap until four weeks in given … everything … but really, imagine being four weeks behind on class! We really should make sure you’re positive about your subjects.’ Hermione was straight into study mode; it was nice there were at least some things that didn’t change.
Draco lunged forwards. He’d heard Percy talk about this moment enough times. Fred’s last words that haunted the whole Weasley family. His arms wrapped around Fred before anyone else had a chance to move, tackling him to the ground as the air exploded.
So, he escaped the quiet of the castle to hide in his ashy room, with thoughts of Ginny still spinning through his head and a letter from her crunched in his hand.
He looked different. Brighter, fuller, happier, more confident. He still looked enough like the Potter from his time to bring out the same response though. The snide comments already chocking him. The cold glare already settled in his eyes while the Malfoy sneer crept across his face. All lovely things if he wasn’t facing possibly his only ally in this world. He needed to get his feet under him before he made (remade?) an enemy of the man.
‘Aguamenti!’ Harry bawled, but the jet of water that soared from the tip of his wand evaporated in the air, a stream of water against this was less than nothing.
There was doubt in his eyes again, the desire to argue. He shook his head, glaring, but listening to Draco one last time. He didn’t have power over him anymore, they both knew it, but without a better plan on offer he’d at least work with him for now.
‘I’d tell my Father he deserves to be in prison for dragging me into this shit. I’d come out to my family and wouldn’t give a shit if they disowned me for it.’ He was listing them off smoothly, the regrets he’d had from life, he sounded excited to say them out loud. ‘I’d break off my engagement, though it’s kind of a by-product of the above. I’d get my potions Mastery, specialising in healing potions to make up for the damage I’ve done. I’d date a boy. I’d confess-’
This time, his heart still pounded, but the overwhelming fear was missing. It wasn’t a trial; it was a rerun. His eyes scanned the room, looking for the mess of black hair. It was missing, but it would be here soon, he didn’t remember if Harry had been there from the start last time, he just remembered him speaking up. They weren’t at that point yet, maybe he came in late?
‘Ahh right … why start off light, let’s jump straight to the most painful one.’ He settled back, taking a few bats to drag a book to in front of him so he could stare at the pages instead of looking at Harry.
He sighed, waiting at the barred door while the Auror kept fiddling with his keys. As though, if he just took long enough, someone would come in to change their mind. But no one came and eventually the cut metal made it to the lock.
‘We have already placed protection around the castle,’ McGonagall continued, as though anyone was still listening to her, ‘but it is unlikely to hold for very long unless we reinforce it. I must ask you, therefore, to move quickly and calmly, and do as your prefects -’
‘My instructions to the Death Eaters have been perfectly clear. Capture Potter. Kill his friends – the more, the better – but do not kill him.’
‘It sucks. Being dead is just crap. Being stuck in here with only you occasionally for company is beyond shit. But I’ll always be grateful to you for giving me that chance. And I don’t regret dying for him.’
He managed to push himself off the other body. He didn’t want to leave Greg alone where he was, but he’d made it through okay last time which meant that was the safest place for him this time.
Sure, he hadn’t actually left yet, Draco had no reason to think that might be what he was planning to do. Except that he’d lived through it. Through his funeral, through years of thinking his godfather had died hating his life, through night after night of Harry wallowing on the guilt for a man who was never given the recognition in life that he deserved. He knew that’s what the man before him had planned to do, even if he didn’t have the words to explain it. So, he stuck with the simplest words he had.
‘Yeah, course. It’ll be great.’ And it would be, or at least could be – might be? There was an answer somewhere there where it would work. He just wasn’t quite sure he’d reached it with the same level of enthusiasm as his friends had.
His progress was slow. The blood from his shoulder dripped against stone, but he didn’t get nearly far enough before he was stopped. He didn’t know how long he’d taken; he didn’t know if Severus would even still be alive at this point. With a wand pointed at his face his options were fairly limited.
‘No Potter, too … shapely for me.’ Draco drawled back with an eye roll, he called him Potter, he was getting annoyed too.
Still, no one trying to help him, but at least his last effort for the war hadn’t been wasted. Harry lifted the silvery substance into it with his wand. When the flask was full to the brim, and Severus looked as though there was no blood left in him, his grip on Harry's robes slackened.
That was a good thing. An amazing thing. That gorgeous, happy little boy deserved nothing less. But he KNEW that they wouldn’t want him in his life, nowhere near the amount he had been if at all. It felt like the life he’d created with Potter was slipping away further and further with every thought.
The silence swallowed them all again. Every head turned, every eye in the place seemed to have found Harry, to hold him forever in the glare of thousands of invisible beams.
Harry laughed softly, covering the shake of his breath at their proximity. Their arms were almost touching. Where he should have felt the warmth of him, he could barely make out the chill, the only sign that anything of Draco was still there with him.
Fred looped an arm around his shoulders, his hand barely resting against him. Delicate, so careful. He could see the tears in his eyes. He felt bad.
Potter snorted, as though he was torn between laughter or a sigh and just elegantly chose to fail at both.
It was hours later, he had more than the required inches written, more potions knowledge about using pewter bloody cauldrons than he ever wanted to know. He didn’t want Malfoy to stop speaking though. The rhythmic cadence of his voice, the enthusiasm in his words. He’d never get sick of listening to it.
Harry slammed the door behind him, leaning back against is as his chest heaved and breath refused to settle. Over the pounding of blood in his ears he heard the soft whimper of the end of that sentence from the other side of the door.
When he’d circled back in the room, it had been for Malfoy. He’d risked his life for Malfoy. Ron had followed him as though he was doing what was best. Ron got Goyle on his broom no problem. They were heading to the exit before Harry had even turned around.
‘Yes, because that would be so tragic.’ He was almost glad for the opportunity to practice his sarcastic drawl.
He wanted to argue, wanted to correct them. What had happened the first time should have happened again. It was no use though. He knew what he’d changed. If Potter didn’t come for him then why would he have come for his mother.
‘That’s so creepy, you know that, right?’ Malfoy called out, his laughter breaking the sneer of his tone.
His release had been remarkably different last time. Something about having The Chosen One arguing on your behalf left little room for doubt. This time … well this time there was only him, and the thing growing in him. If he could explain how that came from their Golden Boy too they’d probably – well, let’s be honest – they’d probably lock him up faster or walk him out to get the kiss straight away before they had the displeasure of proving or disproving it.
Those fuckers, one scared girl from a table who’s families were standing on the other side waiting for death. They didn’t have a good choice here. It wasn’t ‘us and them’ for most of them, it was a choice of who’d they die for. Black and white was a luxury they weren’t afforded.
His breathing began to shake, and he stared into the light for a moment, holding his breath before he felt he could begin again. One, two, three, four, five – in – one, two, three, four, five – out –
‘– and it is doing so without your help,’ Voldemort’s voice in person was worse than he remembered too. ‘Skilled wizard though you are, Severus, I do not think you will make much difference now. We are almost there...almost.’
A whispered ‘Nox’ and the light disappeared. Draco knew that to look for, what to listen for, so once again he dragged himself to his feet, bloodier again, weaker again, but still moving. He snatched the wand from the fallen Death Eater, at least now he had something, even if it felt as though it was rebelling in his hand.
Harry didn’t get the chance to respond. Like a wave, the school’s hatred of Slytherin’s seemed to shake them out of their terrified stupor. The entire table of Gryffindor’s stood first, turning their glares to those in green. Following them were the Hufflepuffs, then the Ravenclaws. It was well timed, intimidating, and intense, as though they’d practiced this before. All those eyes set on Pansy he could see her trembling at his side as they began to raise their wands.
Harry knew it was bound to feel different, but he hadn’t known quite how different. He couldn’t look around the castle without seeing the scars of the battle. Burnt or damaged walls. All safe by now of course but they hadn’t had time to erase them completely. It almost wouldn’t feel right to have done it yet anyway.
All that got him was a few extra glares. No idea whether that was from the swearing, the screaming, the name he’d thrown out or just that he had the nerve to keep asking, but he kept going anyway.
He should have put it together earlier. There were a lot of different theories on time travel, and he’d done extensive research into all of them. There were two basic building blocks of how it could go. The alternate dimensions theory where going back and changing anything immediately created a new reality so the one you left would play on from where you left it and a tangential one was started where you made the first change. Or looped or butterfly effect, where you step on a butterfly in the past and suddenly don’t exist.
‘Harry, this is our final year, you have to take things seriously. Covering all the subject you need to be an Auror won’t help if you don’t want to be an Auror-’
Severus’ eyes widened slightly, staring at Draco as though he barely recognised the boy before him, he guessed that was fair.
‘Not here …?’ He couldn’t resist asking, he knew he didn’t want to hear the answer, but the question slipped out before he could stop it.
‘You two, the Golden Trio went to the Room of Requirement with everyone else. Use a Disillusionment charm and wait there. Call us using these the second the three of them step out.’ He cast a quick charm on three galleons, handing one to Greg and one to Blaise, handy trick Hermione, thanks. ‘Remember the Dark Lord wants him alive so don’t do anything until I get there to help. Got it?’
After that he’d died and he thought that was fair. Then he came back and one of the first words he heard was his name.
Harry grinned, he’d had enough of the semi-serious conversation anyway, it was time he moved on to more comfortable ground and goading each other was something they were both so very good at.
‘Ha-’ He didn’t even get the full syllable out before an Incarcerous wrapped around him, he shifted just enough as he was falling to see bright pink hair.
If it was his timeline then everything he’d lived from the morning of the war was lost, being rewritten.
‘But he’s younger at a later point in time, so from a second timeline, right? That makes him the Second.’
Ron and Hermione followed back to the stretch of wall beyond where the Room of Requirement was waiting. Harry paced past while Draco watched, the door appearing at the third lap and the three of them slid inside. He left his hiding spot, walking straight to where Greg and Vince were waiting, the tell-tale shimmer of a weak spell outlining them.
That brought up a whole other bucket of questions. He was in his body, not the one from the time he was in. Did that mean there was another him here? Like a time-turner travel situation? Probably not, he remembered still being in his bed at the moment so they would have crossed paths, and a time-turner wouldn’t have sent him back to Hogwarts. Whatever it was, he had to be who he was.
‘If you’re staying, then you’re staying for me. No questions or arguments until this thing is over. If you have a problem with that then I don’t have time for you, and you should get out of here now.’
Something he’d done had already changed it this much, he had to be more careful. Harry had to defeat Voldemort, so everything had to be done as close to the first time as possible. The lives he saved had to be as separate from that as he could make them. Crabb started the Fiendfyre, so he had to stay. He couldn’t get him out to safety yet, maybe he could get his own broom before the room went up in flame, but that was secondary to Harry’s task. But Blaise would be an extra who wasn’t meant to be there. He’d also be observant enough to ask questions about why Draco knew where to be, why he was saving Order of the Phoenix members.
Touch one wall, long breath in to the other. Then breathe out. Touch wall. Repeat. He’d learnt this at the start of last year.
Malfoy’s head swung back to look at him, silver eyes steely and resolved in a way Harry had only seen once before.
‘I wish-’ he murmured, cutting himself off before he finished the thought, he owed Draco more in this moment, but he wasn’t sure he could say it.
Draco tumbled from the broom, hands clawing at the cool stone of the corridor floor as he coughed and retched the ash and smoke out of his lungs, violently scrubbing the tears from his checks even as they kept falling. To his side Harry sat up, staring back at the closed door. Slightly further down lay Ron and Hermione, panting on the floor and then Greg, quiet for once, still unconscious.
They fell into silence, Malfoy’s attention finally shifting off him enough that he managed to get though a whole page. He heard pages flicking across from him, but that might be Malfoy reading or could be his version of a workout for all Harry know, and he refused to look up again. Refused to be the first one to break the comfortable silence settling between them.
Finally, he heard it, the crazed shout of Dolohov calling out “Crucio” and the calm “Stupefy” from his old Professor. How this side won with their bloody morals holding them back honestly astounded him. Of course, he knew the man he ran towards wouldn’t win, not this one, not this time.
‘Fucking leave Harry …’ Draco murmured under his breath. He couldn’t risk getting in Harry’s way, not yet at least.
‘Give you two some time alone too.’ Ron nudged him, nodding towards where Ginny was chatting with a friend, glancing shyly across at him. ‘Just to talk mind you.’
Hermione dove aside, no harm done, but he could see the fury growing in Harry’s eyes that his friend had been targeted, with that spell. Compared to what was going outside it was nothing, but it seemed like everything to him in this second. Harry shot a Stunning Spell at Crabbe, who lurched out of the way, knocking Draco’s wand out of his hand; it rolled out of sight beneath a mountain of broken furniture and bones. Great, wandless again. He knew that was it, he wouldn’t get a new one before the end of the battle and he still had lives to save.
The great hall was the worst. He couldn’t step foot in it without picturing the bodies they had lined up. Without thinking of all the faces he recognised, the ones he wouldn’t get to see again. The ones that should be walking back here with them. Ron and Hermione were at his side at least. Their hands clutched together and faces pale. He knew they were thinking the same thing, but none of the said it out loud. As though that made it any easier …
Any others? Anyone else he might have known from anywhere? There were those girls in their year weren’t there? Lavender and Padma? No, Parvati and Padma, that was them. Please, in the name of all the Four Founding Fathers, say Parvati and Padma …
Draco woke bathed in murky, green light filtered through the water of the Great Lake, in the Slytherin dorms, the calendar pulled to the worst day of his life: 2
‘Where's Ginny?’ he said sharply. ‘She was here. She was supposed to be going back into the Room of Requirement.’
Then he was there. Harry Potter, looking much worse for wear and, Merlin, so much thinner, he’d forgotten how bad it had gotten by the end. Their eyes met and Harry offered him a small, uncertain smile of relief. Draco was stunned for a moment; he’d forgotten how his heart raced at that first smile. How much he-
He’d just reached the exit when he heard the screams. He turned and saw nothing but fire. Then the broom lurched and they were both thrown off into the corridor. Free.
‘It cannot be any other way, I must master the wand, Severus. Master the wand, and I master Potter at last.’
The cheers faded, replaced with whispers spreading through the hall, heads snapping to Gryffindor table as Harry joined it, still searching for the other two thirds of the Golden Trio. It was petty, and it was understandable, but it did heart a bit that those emerald eyes weren’t searching for him. He was used to being the one Harry turned to now, but he was in the wrong ‘now’ for the moment.
The door seemed just as reluctant to let him leave, groaning it’s disapproval as it swung open. There were three guards ready to escort him out through the Ministry. All with their wands out, pointed at him. He could feel their magic cracking in the air, ready to go. Not a pleasant sensation.
‘You’re right though. Potions assignment. I’m just going to find somewhere quiet to read through some of these books.’ He shrugged his shoulder and gestured to his bag that still held at least five of them. ‘I’ll let you look over what I’ve got tomorrow, yeah?’
He didn’t watch him when he turned away. He didn’t admire the long, strong planes of muscle on his back. He didn’t have the V lines of his hips memorised. He had never wondered how low his pants had to slip to see a tan line. And he certainly didn’t blush when Potter spotted him thinking nothing about all of the above!
‘We came to get you, didn’t we? You did call for me after all.’ Answered Fred, the twin with both ears.
‘Give me Harry Potter, and they shall not be harmed. Give me Harry Potter and I shall leave the school untouched. Give me Harry Potter and you will be rewarded.
He tried to take his usual calming breath as he walked inside, but he chocked on some thicker ash, the weird breeze that flowed through the room going in just the wrong way to welcome him in.
‘Huh?’ Harry looked around the room, as though it held the answers, Draco just sighed as though he was dealing with a child.
So no, not his past’s body, his current body in the past. Thank Merlin that his glamour work was strong. It should last a week if not interrupted. So, he was three years older and not as sickly thin as he’d been the first time going through this. That was interesting … and completely unprecedented.
‘But-’ The Aurors walked forward, he felt the cold chains on his arms, leeching the magic from his body. It took fucking magic to maintain the womb. He couldn’t- He had to-
‘I’m sure I have no idea what you’re talking about. I’m here, aren’t I? Why would you think I was going anywhere?’ He covered smoothly.
‘It has elf heads on the wall.’ Harry grumbled in complaint, that sounded like Draco wanted him to move there …
He drew himself up, breaking open some blood replenishing potions and swallowing them smoothly, the colour and strength returning to him after two more unknown potions.
‘We have no time to collect possessions.’ McGonagall’s voice echoed his own thoughts. ‘The important thing is to get you out of here safely.’
Dolohov drew back his arm, posed to deal his signature curse. Draco could imagine the purple flame striking across, could imagine Lupin fall. All he could think of was Teddy. That gorgeous little boy who he and Harry spent half the time raising. He deserved his parents, even if they were stupid enough to leave him alone as they fought. He deserved his Father.
At least he was entertaining Draco. Complaining about his potential girlfriend troubles to the boy he had a crush on … smooth.
‘IF WE DIE FOR THEM, I'LL KILL YOU, HARRY!’ A great flaming chimaera bore down upon them, but Ron and Hermione dragged Greg onto their broom and rose, rolling and pitching, into the air once more.
When the Weasley’s showed up it was with their typical, obnoxiously wide, grins – that was expected – their first words were less so.
‘My wand of yew did everything of which I asked it, Severus, except to kill Harry Potter. Twice it failed. Ollivander told me under torture of the twin cores, told me to take another's wand. I did so, but Lucius's wand shattered upon meeting Potter's.’
‘It’s just … I didn’t. I guess I never really spent much time thinking about ghosts before all of this. I mean, I know Professor Binns sleeps – he did it in class enough – but it seemed more like a personality quirk than a requirement. I mean, the Bloody Baron never sleeps, well I suppose he must, knowing what I know now, but I’ve never seen it so-’
Severus strode past where Harry was hiding, Voldemort stood up, the light glinting off his serpent-like face.
The sorting seemed more subdued. There were less new kids being sorted. They still cheered as anyone entered their houses, but it was more out of habit than joy.
Harry wasn’t coming. All Draco had was the hope that even without his testimony they’d be kind. He was a child, he hadn’t killed directly, he had been threatened … it had to be enough.
The second he was clear of the room Draco moved to lunge forward, but Harry beat him to it. The crate blocking them from the room drifted sideways, he couldn’t see him, but could hear as Harry  climbed into the room, approaching the wreck of a man bleeding out on the floor but he offered no help.
The twins came barrelling through, Fred and George a little worse for wear, bloodied and bruised but both standing, both laughing with the pure exhilaration of being alive, of being on the winning side. Drawing Harry’s attention away from him again.
‘It brought friends!’ Harry again. Nope, there was nothing in that hallway. He lent against the wall to keep himself standing, heading outside, the Shrieking Shack, that was his next destination. One more. Just one more and he could rest. He ignored the shouts and spells behind him, thinking of his soft bed at home, Harry’s arms around him. He could do this, just a little more, for Harry. For Severus. He was meant to have one more interaction with Harry, but that one had left him stunned and he didn’t have time. He just had to hope that it wouldn’t make too much of a difference.
Draco’s breath caught as he saw the flames roaring behind him. This was the moment of moost of his nightmares. Flames of abnormal size were pursuing them, licking up the sides of the junk bulwarks, which were crumbling to soot at their touch. They were hungry, they were wild, they were death.
Lying in bed that night he tried to think of Ginny, trying to bring up the emotions that Draco spoke of. That need to be with her, sense of completeness when he was with her. The desire to touch, be touched by … someone. Only the someone that came into his mind wasn’t the red-haired girl he was trying to imagine.
When they reached the main hall, his eyes scanned the room. There was no one running to greet him. He couldn’t spot the familiar figure he was looking for. Everyone was staring at him, the Ministry workers, the reporters who’d gotten wind of his release. Only two were walking towards him though, with uncomfortably familiar shocks of red hair.
‘Malfoy?’ Even over the shrieks of the flames he could hear that deferential, confused, trusting tone. But there was no fucking way he’d do it. He was here to save Malfoy, and Malfoy knew how to survive if nothing else.
‘All this long night when I am on the brink of victory, I have sat here,’ Voldemort’s voice was barely louder than a whisper, ‘wondering, wondering, why the Elder Wand refuses to be what it ought to be, refuses to perform as legend says it must perform for its rightful owner...and I think I have the answer.’
Her weak comforts or plans were cut off as a voice echoed through the hall. Draco tried to restrain a shiver, but he wasn’t sure he managed. That voice was one he’d hoped to never hear again in the real world, one he heard far too often in his nightmares. One he’d never be able to forget and with only a few simple words they managed to suck the warmth, the hope, the strength in the room as efficiently as a horde of dementors.
‘Bo-ored …’ he whined, looking over Harry’s shoulder at the half-filled parchment. ‘I even miss bloody homework. How sad is that?’
The second they were outside the castle walls they were embraced into the chaos of screams and spells. They clung to each other with one arm, wands raised and heads down as they moved between fighting bodies.
Draco fell asleep wrapped in the warm arms of Harry, naked, satisfied. The fertility potion vial was empty on the bedside table. He placed his hand over Harry’s, resting on his stomach; long pale fingers weaving through strong, tanned ones. Maybe this time.
‘He has, to use the common phrase, done a bunk.’ Replied Professor McGonagall and a great cheer erupted from the Gryffindors, Hufflepuffs, and Ravenclaws.
He twisted and lunged for the toilet just in time, hurling what little food he’d had today into the water.
Harry’s face cracked into a grin, eyes flicking open and locking on the cocky ghost leaning against the wall.
Really? That’s all you want to share? Why not list all the Death Eaters attacking and outline the Dark Lord’s plan while we’re at it. Proper villain monologuing time. How had he let it go this way the first time?
The diadem seemed to fall in slow motion, turning and glittering as it dropped toward the maw of a yawning serpent, and then he had it, caught it around his wrist –
He twisted the antivenom in his pocket that he’d stolen from the potion stores earlier that day. This would have to be enough. It would have to be soon enough once it was done. He’d never seen the body but Harry had told him what had happened. He’d said it wasn’t eaten so there should still be a decent chance.
Once he was around the corner, he shrugged off the shoulder of his cloak, staring at the gash, blood trickling down his arm. Worth it for Fred’s life. But fuck that hurt. He couldn’t heal it. He didn’t have a wand, ointment, anything. He was as useless as a bloody muggle in the middle of a wizard war.
‘They'll be all right,’ Harry managed, his words sounded empty, but Ginny needed to hear something. ‘Ginny, we'll be back in a moment, just keep out of the way, keep safe – come on!’
with it, just not what I go for.’ Draco’s arms fell to his sides with a sigh, that was the first time he’d said that so plainly to anyone, of course it had to come out in a semi-fight.
‘I’ve done what I can to protect him in this war…’ Severus replied cautiously, but he was giving him the chance to speak which meant there was a chance he could stop him.
‘But it is of you that I wished to speak, Severus, not Harry Potter. You have been very valuable to me. Very valuable.’
‘I don’t know if they could have been better people without me. Maybe they preferred things the way it was, they used me just as much as I used them, just in more basic ways where mine were more obvious orders. I like to think it worked for all of us though. Regardless, in that moment, they might have gone against my loyalty to follow someone stronger, but so had I. It’s what I taught them anyway so I couldn’t really fault them for that. I still owed him my protection. It’s all I could do. If I kept myself alive all the way through the war, betraying everyone else around me, then that’s fine. I have my own moral code to my family and to both of them.
‘We … ahh … are just going for a little walk, okay Harry?’ Hermione managed to keep a straight face despite her blush.
He woke up with a gasp, sweaty, twisted in his sheets, clinging to his had which still felt like it burnt.
‘I think you should be alive … not me.' He stormed into the room, what an opener; spending so much time with Draco had improved his flair for the dramatics.
‘Weird being back hey? But I’m wiped, going to go straight to bed. Night Gin.’ And ducked through the portrait before it could swing closed behind her friend.
Draco frowned; he hadn’t seen that one coming. But potions master, double agent, working for a psychopath who likes killing and snakes. It made sense he guessed that he’d been prepared for exactly this … that didn’t make it even slightly okay.
‘Fine, maybe. But not now. I have to get some credit for what I feel now.’ It was the only argument Harry could think of, and something in it lit a spark in Draco’s eyes.
Blaise’s eyes narrowed, his face was blank, but those eyes held a chaos of emotions. Fear, doubt, confusion, concern, but something in his voice must have struck the chord that he wanted, and Blaise nodded slowly.
‘’kay?! You think all of this-’ he gestured at the room – their room he guessed – their bed, the naked Potter relaxing in front of him. ‘-is covered with that?! You’ve got to be fucking kidding me?!’
‘The second you slip up, we’ll have you. Everyone here knows you should be in Azkaban and we’ll get you there.’
‘That’s fair, the place is disgusting. But it’s yours, fix it however you like.’ He answered simply, lying down beside Harry, staring at the ceiling in his place.
‘What do you want for Christmas?’ He had wanted to work it in casually, somehow it still ended up blurted out, but it worked to change the topic at least.
He could see the tattoo; he’d cast the glamour. All they saw was the snake and skull. Not a great impression to give.
Harry looked away first this time, trying to convince himself not to say what was in his head, but Malfoy had let him in on his thought process, they were being honest with each other. He may as well give this a try. This was the exact kind of thing that he stopped himself from saying to his friends. The kind of thing that had started building the distance between them. Malfoy was simultaneously more and less important to him, and in just the right way to give him the strength to voice the thought.
I have no real clue on chapter lengths, but each should cover about a month. We’ll have part of future and past in each chapter, though at this point I think a lot more happens with Older Draco back in time than Younger Draco in the future. They both have their struggles though!
‘Did you know ghosts can sleep?’ He hummed, Harry looked up to see him laying on his stomach, flicking the same page backwards and forth.
Crabb was still in bed when he got back to the room. Maybe it was better if he didn’t come with him … Goyle had calmed down a lot after the war and he had no doubt that Crabb would have too, if he’d had the time. But he wasn’t there yet, he was probably safer if he just got caught up in the student evacuation with the rest of them.
He’d asked McGonagall about it, as soon as the dust had settled enough. Apparently, the room hadn’t burnt the corridor. It hadn’t been seen since. They hadn’t recovered a body. He’d stopped asking about it pretty quickly. He couldn’t stomach hearing it again.
It opened into a giant, empty room. He couldn’t see to the end of it, but he recognised it. The Room of Lost Things, it was just … empty. He stepped inside, leaving the door open behind him, just in case.
‘Blimey, d'you reckon it'll still work after that fire?’ asked Ron, he staggered to his feet, rubbing his chest and looking left and right. ‘Shall we split up and look –?’
‘I mean … she is gorgeous.’ Harry looked to the letter as though that was where she stood in the room, considering what it was a life with her was offering.
‘Well, the day you went to the past was the day you got knocked up. At least, the you that came back was pregnant. So, we knew that it was coming when we started trying. So … that’s why they … I mean, we are-‘
He wanted to start working on a way out of here. A way to confirm his timeline and get the hell back to it. Instead of that, he got to stare at the cracked cement of his cell and hope the malnutrition wasn’t doing damage to the baby. Not quite how he’d expected the start of being pregnant. Harry would have been over the top, maybe painfully so. Running out the second he asked for anything. He probably could have gotten him to Apparate half-way around the world if there was something specific he was craving.
‘It's somewhere here!’ Harry yelled, pointing at the pile of junk into which the old tiara had fallen. ‘Look for it while I go and help R – ‘
Sure, Harry had missed them, but they’d been happy, they’d had a good life. Now there was no guarantee he could get back to that. No guarantee it was there waiting for him.
There was a terrible scream. Snape's face lost the little colour it had; it whitened as his black eyes widened. Nagini’s fangs pierced his neck. His hands flailed and fumbled as they tried desperately to push the enchanted cage off himself. Within moments his knees gave way, and he sank to the floor.
His stomach twisted up in knots, but it almost felt exciting knowing he’d get to be a part of this battle on the right side this time.
‘Yeah, yeah. Hermione will want to check your work.’ Harry grinned at him as Malfoy bristled at the suggestion his work would be check, and Merlin forgive, be corrected by her.
A jet of scarlet light shot past Harry by inches: Hermione ran around the corner behind him and sent a Stunning Spell straight at Crabbe's head. He wished he could have let it hit, but he couldn’t, not yet. He yanked Vince out of the way just in time to dodge her spell.
‘Shame he wasn't concentrating when they mentioned how to stop it, really,’ said Ron, whose hair, like Hermione's, was singed, and whose face was blackened, neither as bad as Draco’s but Harry wasn’t looking at him. ‘If he hadn't tried to kill us all, I'd be quite sorry he was dead.’
‘Yeah, great. Go on you two, have fun.’ He managed to muster up enough enthusiasm to push them down the corridor, not that they really needed the encouragement.
He stopped and took another deep shaky breath. Yes, it would be okay, he could do this. He was about to face some of the worst times of his life, even after living with the noseless bastard, but for Harry he’d be willing to suffer through it twice. He could feel his cautious, wavering resolve begin to build in his stomach strengthening. There was something else he could feel there too, a nauseous twisting feeling that he’d chalked down to the terror at his situation in general but now he concentrated on it maybe that wasn’t all it was…
His breathing began to shake, and he stared into the light for a moment, holding his breath before he felt he could begin again. One, two, three, four, five – in – one, two, three, four, five – out –
It was somewhat entertaining to watch Ron simultaneously try to set up his best friend and protect his sister’s innocence, but it wasn’t worth the awkwardness.
But- He and Harry had bonded, the slightest bit, in that moment at the end of the war that had already been wrecked. He remembered Harry telling him that in that moment of relief at the war being over, seeing the same relief on Draco’s face had meant a lot to him, made it clear how he felt by the end at least. Some people weren’t dead. That was good.
‘Merlin that’s confusing …’ he mumbled, trying to keep up with their blathering, how could they work a conversation about time relativity into such a ridiculous discussion?
He’d royally fucked up this time travel thing. If he could, by some miracle, work out a way to go into the future there’s no telling if that would mean he’d just take this body and suddenly be missing for years or if he’d suddenly remember a separate past. In either of them he didn’t think he’d end up with Harry and there was too much to risk there.
He closed his eyes and reached out to the handle that had appeared, swinging the door open to a luscious, large,
‘I … Hadn’t thought about it.’ Harry thought about what he knew about the room, what he knew about ghosts, neither topic he had much information on really. ‘I mean … you have to know what kind of room you want from outside, don’t you? What if you weren’t in the room I thought of? What if me trying to create you a room meant you … I don’t know … didn’t exist anymore?’
He stumbled off his bed, his feet jarring against the stone floor. Shit. He was used to a bigger bed and the plush carpets that he’d demanded, and Harry had indulgently supplied. He looked around the room. It felt too real, it wasn’t a dream, couldn’t be a dream. Usually, the only real thing was his panic, but he could tell that the pain was there. The cold was there. He was here.
‘You’re not there …’ He added, he hadn’t meant to say that part out loud, but there it was. The real reason he couldn’t imagine living there. He wanted his future to have Draco in it.
Hearing the word “friends” from them like that was … off-putting. But they observed him with narrowed eyes, careful and calculating, watching for his reaction. It was a remarkably Slytherin look for two die-hard Gryffindors. He might be able to make this work.
A wry grin pulled its way across his face. Of course, by this point of the war he’d been broken … completely … he wasn’t that boy now.
The only thing left for Hermione to nag him about was his bloody house. Less annoying than the others but still, just one more thing. He glanced out of the corner of his eye at Draco. He’d solved all his other problems, maybe he had an answer for this one too.
Even worse that his first stalling technique, but Draco had somehow let him get away with it the first time, so he had to again. He knew the line, even if he didn’t want to say it again.
Even with his steps his breathing wasn’t working right. How the fuck did he usually take five seconds with each breath in and out? He gasped it in in a second, desperate to fill his lungs. It left him with a wheeze, sucked from his body just as fast.
‘The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am not its true master. The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner. You killed Albus Dumbledore. While you live, Severus, the Elder Wand cannot truly be mine.’
To his side a figure rose, by the time he glanced across it was too late to stop her. Pansy Parkinson raised a shaking arm and screamed,
‘We should work together on the potions essay tonight. I know you have your books, but you haven’t even opened them yet, have you?’ The answer must have been in his eyes because she clicked her tongue in disapproval and continued on, ‘Right, well, I’ve only just completed my first draft, so I’d be happy to spend a few hours tonight going over it with you.’
He was within his own timeline so could potentially kill himself early but not erase. There was probably some comfort in that.
That meant he was doing this alone. He nodded, walking over to Blaise’s bed. Yup, just him. He poked the sleeping boy in the ribs, ignoring the swat and the growl.
It felt right. It was something he was excited about. It wasn’t perfect, of course, but nothing was when so much in his life was based off a translucent boy. But it was still getting better.
But it was his turn again, as though holding the script for a play that no one else knew they were a part of.
No, there really was no other option, he’d just have to live it out and do his best to get everything back on track. He’d done it before, and he could damn well do it again. This time he was armed with information. For instance the fact that Harry, even Hogwarts Harry, had a few R rated dreams about him made him much more confident about this from the start.
Draco’s eyes were open for about three seconds before it clicked into place. This morning, this particular morning, waking up in his bed back at Hogwarts was etched into his brain. He’d had nightmares about it so many times before. The day he almost (and probably should have if it wasn’t for Potter’s stupid saviour complex) died.
Screams rose in the room. Draco knew how this part went but he still found himself clutching to Greg’s arm at his side like so many others in the room. He couldn’t help glancing around the hall, he knew the spell, he knew the monster in question wasn’t actually here, but something about that voice drove any logical thought from his mind.
Time travel was confusing. He’d woken up in the middle of the war, readying himself for death. He’d have to start thinking of the other implications soon. But for the moment there was nothing else for him to do. Which was a relief because he wasn’t sure there was anything else he could do. He was barely keeping himself standing at the moment.
Draco didn’t think. To his side he heard Blaise calling out a Protego thrown in Lupin’s direction. He didn’t know why, but Draco had said save him, so they weren’t going to let him fall. Lupin stared out as the purple flames hit the invisible wall in front of him. The confusion at seeing two Slytherins help him froze him. Dolohov wasn’t as easily distracted. His wand raised again going straight for the killing curse, Draco’s spell left his lips first.
Then there was the demanding pressure of chapped lips against his, and it felt so real. As teeth dragged across his bottom lip he jumped back, eyes snapping open. There was no way he could have imagined that.
‘We have to run. The Death Eaters are running!’ He urged frantically. Draco shrugged him off, turning to see that Harry had already turned away, already caught up in someone else’s conversation.
‘You can’t send me there!’ He leaned against the edge of his bars as though the closer he could get to the Head Warlock, the louder he could scream the words, the more likely they were to listen.
He shivered, shoes twisting against the charred stones beneath him and he half threw himself through the door with a step.
One hand twitched at his side wanting to reach for the wand that wasn’t there. The other fell flat against his stomach. His thin fingers wouldn’t be any real protection if they decided to attack, but that’s where it wanted to be.
He bit into his lip, refusing to scream. He felt the floor connect with his knees and the iron tang of blood in his mouth before the spell let up. He took a deep breath, forcing himself to his feet to meet his eye. Okay, he could try again. Ignoring the tremors of the aftershock of the curse he faced the Death Eater.
‘Harry, you really shouldn’t be so careless about your homework. The Auror’s might accept you both anyway, but to get through the training, to earn and keep your jobs once you’re there, you’ll need this kind of information.’
‘Nah, we couldn’t agree if it was the first or second so that would just make things confusing.’ It was just a damn name; did it really matter?
Draco grabbed the Stunned Goyle and dragged him along; he was so heavy, he couldn’t believe he’d done this the first time. The temptation to drop him and bolt was almost overwhelming, but he was not going to let anyone new die. With no wand, no time, nothing changed he might not be able to save Vince, but Greg wasn’t going to go down’ with him.
‘I have a problem, Severus,’ Voldemort spoke softly, that was the most terrifying of all, he almost sounded … kind.
Draco snorted, yeah, because that was what was really important. It was like when they read the safety videos on the plane (which he’d been painfully attentive to, terrified out of his mind while Harry laughed at him), you leave your shit and get the fuck out. Oh, and high heels off. He glanced at Pansy; she mustn’t have gotten that memo.
It seemed to be enough for now though, they dropped the topic and he managed to make it through the rest of the feast in relative peace. The whole table seemed to decide as one when it was time to leave and the procession of Gryffindor’s made their way to the common room. Ron and Hermione lingered just outside the portrait.
‘Fine. YouTube. Anyway …’ Apparently from there answering the original question was now the lesser evil. ‘If you really want to get me something for Christmas, why don’t you think of a more interesting room for me?’
‘That's my wand you're holding, Potter,’ he raised his own wand in the gap between his two guards, he hoped no one else could see how it trembled in his hand.
‘I tried …’ He croaked, curling in on himself as he gasped for breath through his tears. ‘I did my fucking best …’
‘Okay, maybe not friends in the same kind of way you have friends. Not in the same way most Gryffindor’s have friends. But they were all I had and I did care dammit.’ He pushed the book away, giving up at staring at the words and stared at his hands instead, they didn’t offer much more, but it was better than seeing whatever was in Harry’s expression.
‘Moving on.’ He coughed through the words, straight from smoke and ash to dust, what a fun night his lungs were having.
Harry pulled the Healer apprenticeship offers closer to him and slowly began to fill them out beneath Draco’s smiling gaze.
He pretended the words were for him. Shoving himself off the wall as he broke into a staggered run down the hall. He stared at the ground in front of him and just focused on keeping moving. It didn’t matter if he ran into someone, he didn’t have a wand anyway, his only hope was that no one spotted him.
He needed someone other than the precious Chosen One to talk to. Someone else to get information from who he could actually get through full conversations with. Someone worth conversing with. Someone who he didn’t want to punch after a few words and wasn’t constantly on the verge of laughing at him.
A roaring, billowing noise behind him gave him a moment's warning. He turned and saw both Ron and Crabbe running as hard as they could up the aisle toward them.
‘We was hiding in the corridor outside,’ grunted Goyle, thank Merlin Draco had taken the time to work on his elocution after this, he could barely handle it now. ‘We can do Disslusion Charms now! And then, you turned up right in front of us and said you was looking for a die-dum! What's a die-dum?’
He sighed, his form physically drooping and looked slightly paler than it had been at the start. Malfoy took another deep breath, he didn’t need it, they both knew it was habit rather than necessity, but that moment seemed to give him enough strength to look up. To meet Harry’s eyes again.
‘You're joking, Perce!’ shouted Fred as the Death Eater he was battling collapsed under the weight of three separate Stunning Spells. Thicknesse had fallen to the ground as Fred looked at Percy with glee.
‘Azkaban.’ The verdict was passed, it wasn’t enough, the fear from the first trial flooded, ice-cold through his veins.
A strong hand landed on his shoulder, spinning him around to face Blaise. There was a moment of relief that he was okay, followed by annoyance that he’d interrupted what he knew was an important moment. This was the moment Harry decided to give him a chance. Adrenaline rushing through both of them, both of them alive. They needed this moment to open that path.
‘Why were you thinking about ghosts sleeping?’ He asked, turning his head but not moving away from the door.
Snape was not looking at Voldemort now. His dark eyes fixed on the coiling serpent in its protective sphere.
‘I’ll call them. I’ve tried to contact Severus too-’ that was a weird name to hear out of Potter’s mouth, ‘-but he hasn’t responded. I couldn’t tell him everything. You were both always pretty shady on what he actually knew. I figure you’d be comfortable with him though?’
Draco was blocked from moving any further forward. The crush of the crowd was too much to wade through. Harry had pulled back and was looking around. Just a little further and he’d see him, then-
If they both lived through this then he owed him that at least. Not the truth, obviously, but he could think of something.
Draco’s eyes were glossy, he shook his head to cut off the thought, wincing as Harry’s fingertips slid through his cheek. Where they touched Harry could feel the cold, damp air, the only physical sense Harry could get of Draco’s existence. Draco jerked back violently.
‘Harry?’ Ron's voice came from the other side of the wall to Harry's right. ‘Are you talking to someone?’
He couldn’t imagine a world where his godfather hadn’t died (and Harry could avoid the extra guilt of hating a man who honestly did hate him but had a bit of the wrong end of the stick). George not losing his twin and becoming the shell of a man that Draco had gotten to know, that gaping hole at all the family dinners filled with the twin’s pranks. Teddy with parents.
In actual fires you get down low. In a fire where you were counting on a boy who hated you to fly back to catch you, you climbed. Ignoring the pain in all your limbs, ignore your lungs not getting enough air, ignore the junk ripping at your knees and hands as you scramble up them. None of it matters. You just fucking climb.
Harry thought about getting annoyed at the obvious jab. He really did. But to do so would be ignoring the much more important fact here that he didn’t have to do his homework anymore. As much as he. And all of Gryffindor really, had teased Draco for losing to Hermione (in most classes), he was just behind her in grades. Even with his idea of ‘dumbed down’ answers, he’d be giving the right ones.
‘Sorry Ron, I think some time alone in the castle is exactly what I need for the holidays. Get my head cleared out a bit, you know?’ He locked eyes with Ron until he got an understanding nod.
There was a chance Draco could be left behind, moved to wherever the things in the Room of Lost Things used to go. So, he knew what to focus on. A room, one he wanted, with Draco in it.
‘Shut it Potter, just … give me something else next time? I’m sick of only having an empty, burnt room and your ugly face to look at.’
Blaise stared at him for a moment, so many more questions and fear at the name mentioned, but he didn’t waste time. He nodded, chasing after Tonks while weaving a moving Disillusionment charm around him.
Greg took the coin and nodded, the hesitation in Vince’s eyes wasn’t well hidden, but he stalked away with his friend so at least for now that was under control.
Voldemort swiped the air with the Elder Wand. It did nothing to Snape, who for a split second seemed to think he had been given a reprieve: but then Voldemort's intention became clear. The snake's cage was rolling through the air, and before Snape could do anything more than yell, it had encased him, head and shoulders, and Voldemort spoke in Parseltongue.
Malfoy doubled over, making fake retching sounds as Harry settled on the ground, grinning up at him.
He’d been through all this. He remembers this morning. The war. The clean-up. The hatred. The grovelling. And then … Harry.
They’d both been left on their own, but his mother didn’t have anything of Harry from the future to save her. He wasn’t even sure how long it would protect him for really. He wasn’t free, he was on parole. As soon as they had an excuse, as soon as they had another option, he’d be where they thought be belonged.
And in absence of that someone, he’d be willing to settle for the Weasleys. Even if their only commending feature was that they weren’t Potter. That was a pretty big plus right now.
How could he get together with Harry from a fucking prison cell? How could he survive with the dementors draining him … how could it survive? His hand clutched at his stomach.
Hearing them now he knew how they were heard. After having sat through all of the of the actual Death Eater trials his crimes were nothing. In his timeline they had forgiven him in time, surely, they heard that now. His path to repentance started in this moment. If he had to walk it again to get back to Harry then he’d do it.
Draco spotted his wand on his bedside table and lunged forward, clutching it in a shaky hand as he raised it to aim at the Chosen One.
‘-Still, if one of us was meant to die in the war it should have been me. It was bloody prophesised after all. I mean, I walked in there knowing I was going to die … you … you did whatever you could just to live.' Harry gestured hopelessly at his translucent figure.
‘It'll be all right,’ Hermione’s voice was wild, Draco wasn’t sure even she believed those words. ‘Let's- let's get back to the castle, if he's gone to the forest we'll need to think of a new plan-’
If they held the same idea of loyalty as Vince had then that wasn’t very promising. But he was hardly going to point that out now.
Maybe it was like Stockholm Syndrome. All he had was Potter, he was beginning to grow on him, like a fungus. A smothering, strangling, captivating type of fungus.
‘My mother,’ the line was simple, easy, he’d watched this memory a few times today, making sure he wouldn’t change it, but the conversation felt so false, so flat.
‘Perhaps you already know it? You are a clever man, after all, Severus. You have been a good and faithful servant, and I regret what must happen.’
‘STOP!’ Draco screamed at Crabbe, his voice echoing through the enormous room. ‘The Dark Lord wants him alive –’ This was terrifying, he knew how it was meant to go but one wrong move, one thing different and Harry could die, the Dark Lord could win. It was worse now than the first time around knowing what he was risking with each move.
Harry hummed non-committedly, letting her home in on Ron for a bit until she got agreement from him and turned back on him.
The flames lit Draco’s face; it did look good. Most importantly though, he looked happy. Even if it was at Harry’s expense it was worth it. There wasn’t really any point defending himself here. The room was working against him.
‘'Must mean'?’ Crabbe turned on Draco with undisguised ferocity. ‘Who cares what you think? I don't take your orders no more, Draco. You an' your dad are finished.’
‘Where's Professor Snape?’ Draco glanced down the table offering the third year Slytherin who spoke a smile, loyalty, the snakes knew what it was worth.
‘Yeah, that’s the confusing part here.’ Draco grumbled, letting them continue their performance over the top of him.
It wasn’t fair, he knew it wasn’t fair to throw this at Draco, but they both had enough of the same twisted humour that he thought Draco would get it. He emptied his bag onto the ground, all of the books for his final revision spilling out. Hermione seemed determined to make sure they all had a copy of every book in the library. The exams started tomorrow, and it was all too much. The exams, what came after, everything.
Magic was blocked there, drained from the skin bit by bit. The womb growing the baby was pure magic. He couldn’t. He just couldn’t. The Potter here might not care, but his Harry did, and the baby was them.
Thankfully there was silence across from him. When he looked up Malfoy was watching him with a cocky, knowing grin. He felt his cheeks heat, the stupid grin widened, but he still didn’t speak. Harry hid his face behind a book, glad the serious conversation was over, but this didn’t feel much better. His heart was thumping against his ribs as he read the same three words over and over again, feeling the gaze on the top of his head.
have stayed in his own reality. Which means this Potter was his Harry and he’d legitimately just saved the lives of a bunch of people that were meant to die. He had likely just overwritten his actual time, at least his memories of what would happen?
Was that really even a question? Of course, he’d take his head of house, his god father. Why hadn’t that bee the first option?
‘My – my lord?’ Snape controlled his tone, offering no emotion apart from the calculated curiosity to his question. ‘I do not understand. You – you have performed extraordinary magic with that wand.’
Draco waited a moment, the room was silent, the tunnel was silent. He waited as long as he could make himself until it seemed safe to move. Not that it mattered anyway, Harry had stayed until he was dead. There was nothing he could do for shim now. Maybe there was nothing that ever could have been done.
He paced the corridor, waiting for the door to appear. Just like the first time, he didn’t really think of anything in particular. The Room knew what he needed, and he didn’t actually know if the Room had the magic left to form anything specific. It didn’t really matter anyway.
‘...evacuation will be overseen by Mr. Filch and Madame Pomfrey. Prefects, when I give the word, you will organize your House and take your charges in orderly fashion to the evacuation point.’
It was the only response he could think to give. From the bright smile on Draco’s face, it was worth it.
Stupid bloody experiments, he would have been much better at being a spoilt, rich socialite. Why exactly did he decide he had to work? And in the Department of Mysteries?! He swore under his breath, trying to calm himself down but he’d never really been good at that. He needed Harry.
‘I have told you, no!’ His calm finally broke as he screamed the words at Severus, taking a moment to turn away, sweeping his cloak behind him as he regained his composure. ‘My concern at the moment, Severus, is what will happen when I finally meet the boy!’
‘Everything.’ Harry glanced over at him the closed his eyes. ‘Tell me everything you’d be doing while I do nothing.’
Draco always made these things sound so simple. If Draco specialised at healing potions, it might be nice to work with him, beside him …
A stunning spell flew over his shoulder, he could feel Harry’s power and turned before he could think, a half-insane, giddy smile on his face, ignoring how his body wavered at the turn. Before he spotted Harry a fist connected with his face. He could feel the blood dripping down his chin as he allowed himself to fall backwards. Oh yes, this moment.
‘Why would I stay Draco? I’m sorry, but from here there are two options for my future. Either no one believes what I’ve done, and I’ll be heading straight for Azkaban, or they do, and I’ll be hailed a hero that I very much am not. Neither particularly appeals to me and I’d say I’ve earnt choosing something for myself for once.’
It was the voice he wanted to hear, but not the welcome he’d hoped for. He wasn’t sure what he’d hoped for. This place might be away from the rest of the world, the rest of his life, but that didn’t mean it didn’t exist in here. By bringing in the letter it felt like he’d merged the two.
‘She … she wants an answer. I’ve been … avoiding her since the battle, I guess. I should have an answer for her.’
‘Call Fred fucking Weasley!’ He screamed, the desperation breaking his words. ‘I saved him! He knows I saved him! That’s got to be worth something!’
The Fiendfyre leapt at his heels and he felt tears running down his cheeks as he gagged on the smoke and ash. The fire was mutating, forming a gigantic pack of fiery beasts: Flaming serpents, chimaeras, and dragons rose and fell and rose again, and the detritus of centuries on which they were feeding was thrown up into the air into their fanged mouths, tossed high on clawed feet, before being consumed by the inferno.
If he could give Draco somewhere else to spend Christmas, then of course he should. Of course, he would.
‘I speak now, Harry Potter, directly to you. You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest. If, at the end of that hour, you have not come to me, have not given yourself up, then battle recommences. This time, I shall enter the fray myself, Harry Potter, and I shall find you, and I shall punish every last man, woman, and child who has tried to conceal you from me. One hour.’
‘I don’t have a problem with her, that’s the issue. They keep telling me to get back together with her and I can’t think of a reason not to.’ His eyes latched back on the letter, as if it had answers rather than questions, as though he could will it to change.
The ground opened up beneath Dolohov’s feet. It was a crack, it was smooth, like the hole had been waiting beneath him and had only just been given permission to show itself. Dolohov didn’t fall, he didn’t sink, he slipped, smoothly into the nothing that closed over him. Arm raised to try to claw at the edges, but the earth crumbled beneath his touch, dragging him down with it before filling in the spot where he was without a mark. Leaving the ground as it was, lacking one Death Eater. Buried alive.
His breath was coming in too fast. He couldn’t remember how to breath slower. How could people take air in in any way other than desperate gasps? It just flooded in and he needed more and-
He couldn’t lie to her. The second he shook his head she’d shut down. She’d lied to Voldemort, he was the reason he was dead after all, but he felt like that was the second Malfoy he let die that day. He’d visited her afterwards, back at Malfoy Manor. She was barely a shell of the woman she’d been.
