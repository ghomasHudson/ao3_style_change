"Well, that's easy," Harry smiled. "I'm just an amazingly selfless and kind-hearted person." The statement earned a snort of amusement from Draco, and Harry's smile widened. "And besides, Draco, I don't know if you've picked up on this or not, but I like you. And you're right, we really don't know each other, pretty much at all or anything. But I still like you. And every new thing I learn about you makes me want to know even more. You intrigue me."
"You wanted to protect him," Hermione said sadly, in a voice even quieter than Harry's had been. "Oh, Harry…"
Harry often wondered what they talked about; sometimes Malfoy looked irritated, like he was arguing with one of them; other times he looked as if he was holding back laughter, much to Harry's annoyance. The sound was so rare he couldn't help but wonder what the Slytherin sounded like when he laughed. Harry had only ever heard his laugh tainted with malice and derision, he had yet to hear a genuine laugh from him. He also had yet to see him out of the company of his two housemates.
"Okay," Ron interrupted in a firm voice, "I think I changed my mind, it's no longer funny to me. I officially revoke my blessing unless you promise there will be no more talk of sexual favors between the two of you. Especially while I'm trying to eat."
Without a word, Draco walked forward to wrap Harry in a tight embrace, clinging to him and allowing the brunet to re-center Draco like nothing else seemed able to. Taking his cue from the blond, Harry said nothing as he locked his own arms around Draco's waist, holding him up and keeping him afloat above the sea of his own tempestuous grief. They stood that way until Draco completely lost track of time, wondering how many hours and days the two had been wrapped around one another.
"I didn't make the food," Malfoy confessed, and Harry only smiled in response.
"It's okay, Draco," Harry assured, voice so kind it hurt the blond to hear it. Nobody had ever treated him with such patience or tenderness before. "Just get some sleep, yeah?" His fingers stroked the length of Draco's arm before Potter pulled his touch away. "I'll see you in the morning. Goodnight." And with that, he turned and made his way to the bedroom door, pausing to glance over his shoulder and smile sadly at Draco before the door clicked shut behind him and Draco's room was plunged into a heavy quiet, leaving him alone once more—just as he had foolishly asked for.
He stayed in there until the water ran cold, finally shutting it off and toweling himself dry before padding back to his room. On the bed sat a folded pile of clothing—a t-shirt, joggers, and black cotton boxers. The thought of wearing Seek's clothing—wearing Seek's
But his brooding was interrupted just as he reached the yellowed grass of the early spring grounds—still not quite as warm outside as he would have liked—by the arrival of red hair in the form of Ginny Weasley, nearly hidden behind two large crates and a broomstick all balanced precariously in her arms.
Draco had been alone for nearly his entire life.
"Yes, well, I suppose I can stay out here and watch him for a bit longer."
"Please," he scoffed. "As if
"Soon," Harry promised, hanging up and practically throwing himself on his bike. It roared to life and he did not hesitate to race away, grateful that the roads would be empty at this time of night. He turned his high beams on and twisted the throttle, shooting forward so quickly it took his breath away. But he punched it even faster, going over twice the legal speed as he hurried to find Draco. The area Draco was lost in wasn't exactly a rough part of town, but it certainly wasn't the nicest area, and Harry did not want anything bad to happen to the man.
"Yes," Kings agreed, a shadow crossing his dark face, "he will. But he's not the only casualty we've had. They've also taken Cedric, Sturgis, Bode, Frank, even Alice." He paused to exhale heavily before glancing at Harry once more. "And James."
in a relationship with Harry Potter. That's all the article was about."
sounded as the badge with his identification slid into a metal slot and the red box began to sink. As the light from the Atrium slowly began to rise along the length of the lift and the room came into gradual view, Draco felt a tense coil of nerves knotting through him at the thought of finding himself trapped in a building where not a single person would be pleased to see him.
"I'll take the pain away, baby, I promise," Fenrir cooed, crowding Draco against the nearest wall, and Draco tried to swallow down the bile rising in his throat. He hated the word 'baby' and Fenrir fucking knew it.
Finally, the silence was broken by Harry. "Just tell me, Draco, do you want someone to accompany you back to the Manor or not? The Tracers should be by any second now and there will be other Aurors with them. I can arrange for someone to take you back and stay with you for the night if you want."
"Ever again," Draco added.
Potter bobbed his head and hummed, increasing his pace as Draco groaned, lost in a haze of white pleasure. He could feel his body tightening up and he tried to warn Potter, he really did, but half his muscles seemed unable to work and his mouth, unfortunately, was among them. As Draco came with a wailing shudder, Potter coughed and sat up, choking inelegantly.
"You should have seen Blaise's face when I had to explain the concept of hand-me-downs," Draco grinned.
Christ, though, it had somehow made more sense to Harry to find out that he had had a piece of Voldemort's soul living inside him for most of his life than it did to find out that Malfoy might just fancy him.
"Malfoy," Weasley sounded wary, as though he was fully expecting some sort of spiteful comment in place of a greeting. The reaction would make Draco want to laugh if the situation was not so serious.
, it had made him furious. Seeing them had felt like a violation. But seeing them in a different context, in color, all lovingly put together in a book by Harry himself, who had obviously put quite a lot of time and thought into the gift…it made Draco's insides tingle with that soft, melty feeling he only ever got in Potter's presence.
"And did I?" One corner of Harry's mouth quirked up in a grin. He felt fairly certain that Wood's coaching reputation was safe, something affirmed when Oliver shook his head. Harry could see Finlay drifting below, staring up at the two of them.
Casting a last look of distaste at Lucius, the two guards swept from the room, closing the door behind them with a click. Draco could feel his father's stone-grey eyes on him, assessing him in a way that Draco already knew to be negative judgment. He could imagine his father's lip curling at the sight of him without even having to glance up, and he could not help but fidget nervously in his chair.
"And now you have to get off me," Draco told him, shoving his way free and turning his head so Potter could not see his smile.
Draco still hadn't responded. "Well?" Harry prodded cautiously. Had he been too hasty? Not thought this through enough? But the next second the blond had reached out and yanked Harry in close to meet his mouth in a bruising kiss.
"I dunno," Harry said cheerfully, mock saluting them with his empty shot glass, "I think Blansy sums you two up pretty well."
"Er, yeah," he nodded, feeling nearly as embarrassed as she looked. "Thank you," he called after her as she climbed to her and scurried from the Great Hall. Turning back to Ron and Hermione, he felt shock on his flushed face.
Brittle silence followed his words, hanging heavy and dusty between them like the dry sour-smelling pages of a forgotten textbook. There was a question Harry longed to ask, but he did not want to upset Malfoy further. Deciding to throw caution to the wind and hoping the man would not begin shouting, Harry spoke. "Can I ask you a question?" he began slowly, becoming encouraged as Malfoy nodded warily. "Don't get offended or anything,"—the wariness grew more pronounced—"but is part of the reason you collected Muggle novels so zealously in your youth was that it was some form of teenage rebellion against your father and the strict standards and principles he raised you to uphold?" The question was asked much more formally than Harry had intended, and he waited nervously for Malfoy's response.
"That's one of the most disgusting things I've ever heard," Harry said in a low voice, unable to comprehend the layers of horror embedded within such a story. "Please tell me that you're no longer betrothed to her!"
"Tell us another story!" Pansy requested, and Blaise nodded eagerly.
"You should have woken us," Ron frowned. "We could have searched for whoever it was as a group."
"She was right about you," Draco glared, seething with hatred. He had not ever known it was possible to loathe someone this strongly; it felt as though his very bones might crack from the intense force of the burning, searing hatred pumping through his every vein and threatening to consume him whole, infecting his heart and thickening his lungs until he was drowning in white-hot hatred; he was submerged completely in the dark depths of pure, undiluted loathing, bowed helplessly beneath a rancorous tide pulling him farther and farther out into the stormy swell of his own seething malice. "She always said you were a self-centered, spoiled, vicious, fake little bitch who always thought herself far too good for anyone else. And she was fucking
"I think we should go check out where Mandy was killed," Harry said in a low voice. "Look for any sort of clues we can find, any spell residue, sign of a struggle,
of Muggle clothing?"
Oddly enough, however, it wasn't a terrifying prospect. Not if the reward was the feeling of Harry's palm in his own, warm and steady and safe, anchoring him to the world in a way he had feared he would never again know. He wasn't quite sure what it was that had possessed him to kiss the Gryffindor in front of so large a crowd, other than the way Harry had raced to his rescue without hesitation, no matter all the terrible things Draco had said to him or the way he had fled from the Potions room without a single word. Harry had defended him, in front of everyone. He had attacked a fellow Gryffindor for Draco.
"I've always wanted to kiss you," Malfoy murmured, sending Harry staggering back in shock.
"You're not the only cautious one," Hermione said with a wry smile, but Harry noticed that her eyes remained troubled. "Frankly, I'd be amazed if they managed to break into my flat. Wards are much harder to dismantle than they are to stitch together. The wards on this house, for example, are so thick that the entire manor may as well have been coated in iron. They weren't up when we first arrived—all the wards were down. I think the new wards must have been put up during the first murder, or immediately before. I wonder if that's why it was such a horrid spectacle, to keep us from noticing the bars of our cage locking in on us. None of us noticed we were being trapped until it was too late."
"Draco…" Potter sounded hurt, and Draco's heart constricted further. "I needed to speak to her, it wasn't something I
"Exactly," Harry agreed, still smiling, "and you have met me. So don't act like I'm so terrifying."
be better than all the constant Howlers and daily hate mail, all the jinxed envelopes containing cursed letters and unrepeatable threats, the angry shouts echoing down corridors from the swarms of glaring students, the constant terror that swept through him every time he felt someone approach from behind. Death surely had to be better than the tiny, lost, insignificant feeling that had taken up permanent residence inside him, reminding Draco every single day—whispering to him every single minute—that he was worthless and unloved, inconsequential and alone, useless and unimportant. The voice said he didn't matter, and Draco knew the voice was right. It was the same voice always reminding him that not a single person cared about him, not a single person would be sorry if he died. It was the same voice that reminded him that the vast majority of the population would most likely be
"Erm, Malfoy?" Harry asked uncertainly.
, and he could hardly show up with an Auror in tow, and that his contacts would sever all ties with him, and I wasn't about to knock him out and lock him in the cellar, or follow him around like an obsessed shadow, or anything!"
. A perfectly legal potion, I might add. Certainly not one meant to harm anybody."
from you, I'm awarding him ten points instead because he's
"Just tell me what happened," Potter said, voice somehow both firm and soft, warm and cold, determined and uncertain, and Draco hated that he was still speaking to the wall. "Were you upset with me? Did I do something to make you angry? Did I push you too far before you were ready?
Appearing reluctant, Potter pulled back and slipped his hand back into Draco's, tugging him down the narrow hallway.
"No, you're not awful, Malfoy," Harry said in a low voice, hesitating for a moment before rubbing Malfoy's back to comfort them both. "You didn't know about any of that. I told you so that you would know and so that nothing like this morning will ever happen again. And also because…" Harry trailed off and Malfoy squeezed him lightly in encouragement to continue, "because I want you to know me, my past and my secrets and how I feel about things. If we're going to keep seeing one another, it's important to know these things about each other, isn't it?"
"I'm not jealous!"
"Enough, already!" Ron shook his head, but Harry thought he saw his lips twitching.
"So, boyfriend," Draco grinned. "Walk me back to the dorm?"
It was Hermione's turn to snigger at that.
concrete to be able to offer the man, despite Draco already having the answer all along, Harry felt a large crack split the length of his heart, threatening to snap it in half. "You trusted a criminal over me. My god, Draco, you really don't trust me at all to do my job. You didn't believe for one second that I would be able to solve this."
"Well…" Harry began, sounding both nervous and determined, "I figured, you know, since Blaise was nice enough to fuck off and leave us this nice empty dorm all to ourselves…I was thinking…"
Desperate to leave the room, Harry scanned the walls with increasing alarm for a way out. But as he whirled around, he wasn't sure which exit would lead where. There were three doorways he could see, as well as a marble staircase in one corner.
Still nothing; the voices did not fade, the cue balls did not stop
The empty doorway seemed to mock Draco as he stared at it in growing frustration. Why did Daphne have to leave her rooms
"Oh come on," Blaise said cheerfully, "try and be more optimistic, darling. Maybe if we shatter enough of those cold-hearted, cynical Slytherin stereotypes, he might be a bit more receptive to us."
"Just…go slow, all right?" he implores. "It's been a while."
"Eh, partly," she shrugged unrepentantly, still smiling. "But also because weekends are the only days I have free. We still train in the off-season, you know."
"Be grateful for that," Blaise told him, shaking his head in disgust. "He once dared Daphne to wank him off in front of everyone, including me,
"No!" Draco lied, shaking his head fiercely. "No, I swear! I wouldn't do that to you!"
"You have, Malfoy," Harry nodded gravely. "You've suffered eighteen years in your own company."
the two of them had in common. They didn't like any of the same things; they didn't have any common interests or speak to any of the same people. They didn't even have the same color hair!
"Merlin's fucking beard, Potter, is there
"I think I'm all right with that," he chuckled, tightening his hold on the blond. "I'll freely admit to being selfish when it comes to you, Draco."
"Nobody splits away from the group," Harry said, finally breaking the tense silence that had been sitting stagnant between them all, and although his voice was soft, the other five still jumped at the sound. "Not for anything."
"It's a potion to aid in remembrance," Hermione responded automatically. "You take it before reading or studying something and it helps you to retain the information much better."
"Tell him to answer our goddamn question and we won't have to!" Morgue yelled. "This little bitch knows where Pansy is and he's going to tell me right now!"
Frowning, Malfoy stepped even closer as he raised the same hand as before, a strange expression on his face as he reached up to gently tangle his fingers in Harry's hair—until Harry shoved him away with one hand.
A heavy hand clamped down on his shoulder, trying to pull him back around to face Wolf, and Draco automatically flinched, stumbling away from the unexpected touch as his eyes widened in terror.
Malfoy and Zabini exchanged a weighted look, and Harry felt something in his chest tighten at their easy ability to hold a silent conversation with one another. "Fine, Potter," Zabini said with narrowed eyes. "We'll wait for the moment and not confront him directly about it.
"How did you get out, Harry?" Ron asked curiously.
"He's not staring at you, Draco, let it go," Pansy said, rolling her eyes without ever once actually glancing in Potter's direction to check if he really was staring at Draco or not.
But it was Hermione who answered, giving the brunet a pitying stare. "Harry, nobody is surprised by this," she said slowly, as though explaining a basic, well-known fact to someone simple.
"Yes, but not Mandy," Hermione said, appearing thoughtful as she fiddled with a lock of her hair. "That would have been my first guess as well for the connection if not for the fact that Mandy had no part in it."
, Malfoy was
Hermione nodded once but the intensity of her gaze had not lessened any. "But Malfoy's the reason you ended things for good with her."
"You needed a whole entire new wardrobe, Potter," Draco shook his head right back at the brunet. "You had no choice but to purchase that much. And now we have the extra special delight of burning all that hideous clothing you used to wear."
"I'm not admitting to anything that could come back to bite me," Potter said in a light voice, cheeks still red and lips still spread in a smile.
An iron fist squeezed around Draco's heart, stopping it cold in his chest. "A knife?" he breathed. "He attacked you with a knife?"
"It was a finger," Potter finished, tone darkening further.
"Come on, I'll walk you back to your dorm," the dark-haired teen offered, causing Malfoy to huff but appear secretly pleased.
Draco slid his hands along the collar of Harry's robes with a smile. "I don't think I've ever been kissed like that before."
"Thank you," he said numbly, placing both potions on the small table near Malfoy's bed. With another pat to his shoulder, Pomfrey turned away and headed into her office, the door closing behind her with a soft click.
"I've always wanted to play," Potter sighed, surprising the blond. Potter wanted to play an instrument? A classical instrument? It made Draco feel better to be reminded that there were still some things that Potter was unable to do. The prat wasn't nearly as bloody perfect as the papers liked to make him out to be.
The old familiar slither of fear was beginning to spread through Draco at the thought of their relationship being made public knowledge. What would the masses say to Harry when they found out who he had chosen to be with? Not only was Draco male, but he was, well,
"No, of course not!" Draco shouted. "He didn't do any of that! The sex was fantastic! He used plenty of lube! And he definitely did not bite my dick when he sucked me off!" The room fell into ringing silence and Draco felt himself blush fiercely as he realized what he had just said.
"Blaise," Draco whispered. "Oh, god, Blaise!"
Yes, Draco mused, the latter was also an option as well. A very good option. Probably the best option.
"A gorgeous catch," Blaise added, and Draco knew he felt bad too.
, it did not leave nearly the same pleasant tingle in his throat. More like the insistent urge to scrub at his brain with a wire brush until the images were permanently removed.
Unfortunately, his gag reflex won, making Harry have to reevaluate everything he had been hoping about Gryffindor willpower being strong enough to trump any obstacle it encountered, even something as simple and annoying as his own gag reflex. His willpower could defeat Voldemort, but not his own sodding gag reflex? Stupid gag reflex, didn't it see that Harry
"Yeah?" Harry chuckled. "You nervous for me?"
As Draco attempted to calm himself, Potter glanced over at him and their gazes locked. The man looked surprised and slightly alarmed by the sheer fury that Draco could feel emanating from his entire body, but the shock quickly faded away to be replaced by a defiant expression, as though daring Draco to throw the tantrum he longed to.
"Besides," Blaise cut in, still grinning, "we don't need to know what they sound like. They look like they would sound like what you sound like. So that's what you sound like."
The words caused another burning splash of guilt to surge down Harry's throat and into his stomach, pooling and settling hotly, making his insides feel raw and blistered. Zabini was right. He had no excuse for saying those things, not even if Draco had hurt him first. He had clearly upset the blond and he felt shame and regret scorch through him in blistering waves.
"Very well," Draco sighed, grudgingly handing over the box still clutched between two sweaty hands. "Er, happy Valentine's Day," he finished uncertainly.
"Wait 'til you try the dinner and then see if you still say that," Harry joked in a gentle voice, hand still moving slowly up and down Draco's back.
like it before punching him in the face and storming from the room and then never looking in the other boy's direction ever again.
The mirror opposite him caught his attention and he gazed at himself in absolute silence for long minutes as he considered hurling something at his own reflected face—maybe a book, maybe a spell. Gazing around, his eyes landed on the enormous black frame of his monstrously large bed, and Draco took a moment to admire it. Dragons were carved into every inch of the thick onyx wood, exhaling black flame as they wrapped around the posts and spread ebony wings across the head and foot boards.
"Hermione," Harry interrupted, feeling exhausted and worn out and not wanting to sit there listening to her odd stilted sentences all night. "What are you trying to say?"
Sucking Seek off had been nothing like sucking off Fenrir. Seek had tasted clean and smelled like the ocean breeze; Fenrir stank of blood and whisky. Seek had moaned appreciatively, touched Draco lightly, allowing him to set the pace. Fenrir tangled his hand roughly in Draco's hair, forcing his head down and making him gag and choke. When he came, his hand tightened in Draco's hair, forcing Draco to swallow back a yelp of pain at the aggrieved clenching.
"Well, I, for one," a voice drawled from the doorway "would be very interested in hearing those particular rumors, seeing as how I'm the one he's currently practicing said abilities with." Harry glanced up to see Draco leaning casually against the doorframe, glaring at the two of them.
—he hadn't meant to offend the man!
"So are things…okay, then, between the two of you?" Draco asked cautiously, and Harry squeezed his hand in comfort.
Finally, he would have answers.
"Enormous and manly," he repeated firmly.
"Did you already check his wand?" Harry asked, keeping his voice low.
Harry turned to exchange a glance with Malfoy. "Yes, there is," he said, turning back to Anthony. "There's a snooker room downstairs. You and a bunch of the other blokes went in there today to play a few rounds. But they said that you and Stephen left to find a bathroom and never came back."
"Cae's only nineteen," Potter interrupted, his voice taking on the same smug tone parent's voices take on when bragging about the accomplishments of their children.
"You know," Harry began, "I've never actually worn silk pyjamas before. This is a whole new experience for me."
Tracey hugged him with one arm, pulling back to stare into his eyes with a serious look. "Draco…" she said quietly, her many piercings glinting in the silver moonlight, "this bloke you're with…who is he?"
"Oh my god, Draco," Pansy said suddenly, a wide smirk spreading across her lips. "You two totally snogged, didn't you?"
"You're taking a truck?" he whispered, shocked for some reason. "You're taking
"I really do love you, you know," Draco whispered, tears still shining on his porcelain doll face. "I've always loved you. And I'm sorry for everything I've done, I really am."
"I'm curious," she shrugged, but Harry could see that she was attempting to make the movement more casual than it was. "And it's not as if we'll have to stay. If we get there and find it to be too much, for any of us, then all we have to do is leave. It's not like he can keep us trapped there, can he?"
The day had already been so long, he just needed time to himself.
"Right." Pansy and Blaise exchanged a look.
Harry wanted to disagree, thinking that he might have a very good idea, actually, based on the way that Malfoy was currently attempting to devour him through a kiss, but Harry's mouth was far too preoccupied to argue. And the next words from Malfoy effectively made Harry forget everything the blond had already said, snatching the air from his lungs and the sanity straight from his head.
Malfoy grinned against his mouth. "Well, then I hate to be the one to inform you that the spotlight over your head is not likely to vanish anytime soon, if ever at all."
"What do you think it is?" Ron wondered in a low voice, and Harry glanced over with a shrug.
But that loathing had dissipated long ago, leaving nothing but a dull ache behind in its place.
Draco glared. "Bollocks."
"You really don't think I tricked everybody into coming here just for the opportunity to kill them off one at a time for some sort of sick sport?"
"Oh, sod off!" Draco glared, trying his hardest to ignore his flaming cheeks. "Just because nobody has ever thought that your body was good enough to stick anything into doesn't mean you can disparage other people for it!"
"And then you stay here. With me."
"My, my," Zabini smirked, stepping closer. "We are a bit testy in the mornings, aren't we?"
"Er, see what?" Harry's heart was still hammering furiously, increasing its pace as Malfoy handed the square parchment over without a word and raised one eyebrow in expectation. The close-set handwriting on the card was immediately recognizable.
Fenrir frowned. "Draco?"
Glancing back over at the group of Slytherins, Harry felt his heart constrict as his gaze landed on Malfoy, and he knew that, no matter what, Draco would also make it out alive.
"From what?" Blaise wondered. "What's more important than talking about my very existent and very extremely enormous prick?"
Instead, he raises his knees to his chest and simply says, "Now."
"You didn't have to! Are you trying to get yourself killed?! Do you have any idea what Wolf will do to you when he finds out?!"
Shaking his daze, he looked back to Draco and his lips parted and he found himself responding with the only word he seemed capable of saying after a request like that: "Okay."
A heavy stone dropped into Draco's stomach. Who was there? It couldn't be his father, his father was in Azkaban. It couldn't be Cyril Crabbe, there to exact revenge on him. The wards would keep him out, and even if he had somehow made it inside, he would hardly go around announcing his arrival to the house-elf. The man clearly had more sense than that.
They stared at one another for several moments before both glancing to the others, who, despite their earlier fear and worry, had all settled down and appeared to be at least attempting to fall asleep.
"Potter," he drawled. Was Harry imagining the slight tremor? He said nothing, just scooted a centimeter closer. "I assume that you are in the
(See the end of the chapter for
of how it felt to have Draco Malfoy wrapped around him, pressed against him, feeling him everywhere and kissing him deeply.
And all Draco could think in that moment was a bemused
Harry's eyes widened in amazement, and Draco wondered if the other boy had not been expecting to be granted permission. "Really?" he breathed, the single word barely audible, as though he was being extra careful not to spook Draco by speaking too loudly.
Hermione gave him a wry half-smile. "I really don't believe you would have tricked us all here to kill us off one-at-a-time whilst also locking yourselves inside the house with us."
Shifting them, Seek turned Draco by the shoulders until Draco's back was to the wall. He grasped Draco's hips in both hands, kissing him harder as he slipped a thigh between Draco's legs, and Draco gasped into the kiss, clutching at Seek's shoulders and wondering if it was possible to faint from a kiss being too good. They were panting heavily into each other's mouths, and Draco wondered if Seek felt just as light-headed as he did.
Harry smirked. "I've found that pleading works quite nicely."
"So," Malfoy continued in the same flirty tone, the one that was making Harry's head spin with confusion, "am I allowed to tell people that I was Harry Potter's first?" Harry gaped at him in shock, and Draco laughed as he continued speaking. "To show him the wonders of silk pyjamas, I mean."
He was aware of the consequences and in no way wanted to pressure Malfoy, but Harry suddenly needed to know. He needed to know what they were and what they meant to each other; he needed to know what they were doing and where this was headed. He didn't want another uncertain, in-between relationship like he had with Ginny. He needed to be upfront with Malfoy and find out what exactly it was that they had, but damn if that thing the blond was doing with his tongue wasn't distracting.
For the briefest of moments, Draco felt comforted, special. Harry Potter wanted to protect him? Three years ago he would have been annoyed, but now he felt oddly okay with having the brunet near. But then the situation once more slammed heavily into his chest, driving the air from his lungs.
"This is why I hate prospects," Tracey said with a disgusted shake of her head. "They're not even part of the club and they think they're fucking untouchable. Zach has been here for what, three months? And he thinks he's owed the same respect as a patch?"
"Because," the man grinned. "They're meeting up with my club."
"Harry," Draco said flatly, hoping that would be all the explanation Blaise needed.
"Well, yeah," Harry agreed blankly. Where was he going with this? "But that was before you made it more than clear that you
"What?" Malfoy paled and fell back a step. "
There was something out there, something watching them. Something worse than wind and rain, something intent on forcing its way into that house.
Potter said nothing for several moments. "I think it makes you the braver one, actually," he said quietly.
"So," Harry said after several minutes of tense silence, "do you really live here all alone?" His words seemed to bounce off the darkened walls and echo back to him. The house was large and intimidating, with a threatening feel to the air, and Harry had no idea how someone could live in such a home by themselves. It seemed to always be cold in the Manor, and Harry did not like the sound of their footsteps reverberating along the large hallway, the one half-cloaked in darkness. The entire house seemed to be constantly cobwebbed in clinging shadows, no matter the time of day, giving everything an ominous feel. It felt like the shadows were watching them; it felt like the walls could hear them; it felt like even the air was aware of their presence. Everything about the house felt sinister and bleak, funereal, almost, in a way that Harry had never known a house could be. How could Malfoy live in such a place all alone?
"I'm sorry, Blaise," Draco whispered, feeling Harry rub his back as the tears fell harder. "I'm so sorry. You came back here for me and you died as a result. I couldn't stop them and I'm
The thought made Draco frown.
"Not hungry, darling?" a voice asked, and he glanced up, tensing automatically before relaxing at the sight of Pansy.
"Fine, I think, for the most part," Harry answered, sighing before continuing. "Look, Neville, do you remember how you said I could come to you if I needed a favor?" He still wasn't completely certain of what he was about to ask of Neville, but the hot coil in his stomach would not let him remain silent.
"I'll be back," Draco choked out, stumbling to the door. He didn't wait for a response, hurrying from the clubhouse and tripping his way across the yard toward the back. He yanked the heavy garage door open just wide enough for him to squeeze inside before slamming it shut again, thankful for the thick silence that promised privacy. There was just enough light streaming in through the grimy windows to see his surroundings. He jumped into the backseat of his car, locking the door behind him before pulling his phone from his pocket with fingers that trembled so badly they barely worked. They were shaking so much that it took three tries to successfully pull up Seek's number, and Draco took a deep breath before hitting the call button, his heart pounding in his throat as he listened to it ring.
The scrutiny made the blond nervous and he stood up quickly before glancing around, unsure of what to do now that he was no longer seated.
"No, there are others," Potter said quickly. "It's just that, you know, none of them are as good as he is." There was a double meaning hidden in there that Draco could not ignore and did not want to wonder about. He was still maundering through the mystery that was Potter's relationship with this Caelix and filed the statement away for future examination.
talking…But that wasn't the point! He shook himself from the strange trail of thought he had started to wander down and back into the moment, into the burning heat of Malfoy's stare.
"Blaise deserved it," Harry shrugged.
Michael snorted softly. "God, did he get it bad for that one," he murmured, eyes glassy and distant. "I remember taking him to the Hospital Wing afterwards and him saying he would have done it again in a heartbeat."
"Of course," Draco smiled.
"Right," he grinned, the smile lessening as he thought back to that conversation he had shared with Luna by the lake all those lifetimes ago, when she had comforted him through his confusion over Draco. It felt like he had become a completely different person since then.
of you hated each other for this attraction, which is just bloody weird all by itself. But now maybe one of you wants to act on it but the other one isn't really sure. I mean, is something like a relationship even
I take advantage of his silence and lean forward to kiss him, plucking the nearly-empty glass from his loose grasp and placing both on the coffee table. Pressing further into him, I part my lips, tracing my tongue teasingly along his mouth before slipping it inside. Groaning, he tilts his head to deepen the kiss, one hand sliding through my hair and the other resting on my neck just above my collarbone.
Fenrir groaned, stretching out his upper body before shuffling back and swinging his legs up to lie down.
"Too much?" Caelix finished helpfully, smiling softly as he looked away. "Really, Harry, I'm the one who should be sorry, not you."
A final goodbye was heard before the line went dead, and Draco slumped back in his seat, pressing his fist to his forehead in a useless attempt at making all the painful thoughts whirling through his head just
"You goddamn bastards!" Smith shouted the moment the Slytherins entered the lounge. "Which one of you did it?! Which one of you killed her?!"
But Seek's kisses weren't like that. There was a soft, gentle confidence behind his every touch that Draco couldn't resist. He didn't want to resist. Just once in his life, even if it was only in that one moment, Draco wanted something perfect. He just wanted to feel whole once more, even if he knew he never would be. He had lost far too many pieces of himself over the years to ever again be able to count himself as whole—but Seek somehow made him feel able to almost trick himself into believing it could be possible.
Rolling them both over, Draco began to return every favor, tugging at Harry's clothing until the Gryffindor was just as bare as Draco, grey eyes sliding up and down the other boy's body appreciatively. They had been intimate before, of course, but those had all been quick fumblings in darkened broom cupboards. Never had Draco had the chance to actually
He looked up at her with glassy eyes, nodding and praying it was too dark for her to notice his quivering lip.
As the door swung shut, the room was plunged into an uncomfortable silence. Harry felt confused about the situation and angry on Malfoy's behalf and puzzled by his own response to it. Zabini stared after Malfoy with a frustrated, slightly hungry look on his face, but the next second he had turned to Harry and the expression was gone, replaced with casual regard.
Standing at the window and staring out at the grounds like that, Harry couldn't help but be reminded of his and Draco's very first kiss, the two of them standing by an open window watching the rain together as they spoke in quiet voices, right before exchanging a kiss that Harry had felt throughout his entire being.
"It's not that simple!" Harry repeated in annoyance. It was not as if he could simply ignore every complication and not take everything into account in what he would consider to be a very major decision.
Did he just compliment
"They, er, already have," Harry responded uncomfortably. "Smith knows where Draco's bedroom is. He followed us up here earlier and saw which room I came out of."
"Erm, I don't think so," he replied uneasily, eyeing the shiny weapon held in Harry's other hand with clear discomfort.
Nodding, Harry raked a hand through his hair. "Is there anything else you can tell me? Anything at all that struck you as off about him? Was the last time you saw him the only time he had ever been threatening?"
Those eyes had arrived at Hogwarts at the start of term with only Blaise Zabini and Pansy Parkinson to represent the Slytherin eighth-years. The night of the welcoming feast the doors to the Great Hall had been thrown wide and silence had fallen as the three Slytherins were noticed and appraised. Malfoy stood tall and collected and stared right back at the students eyeing him, some with curiosity or surprise, others with blatant hostility. He held himself stiffly and drew his cloak tighter around himself before sweeping gracefully to the far Slytherin table, Zabini and Parkinson following closely behind.
good enough to be with the Chosen One?
With a loud groan, I shove my parchments aside and stand, stretching my aching joints. Guilt pools hotly in my gut as I wonder how he's doing.
"And what would Hermione be?" Harry sounded amused.
One of the ways her had kept his anxiety at bay was drawing, and he was okay at it, though he never showed anyone. It would pose too many questions, and he hated questions.
He didn't know what to do with himself. He was alone with his thoughts, and he hated it.
Draco’s warm hand touched his shoulder and he collapsed into his arms. The dam broke and Harry cried.
"Then who? Is it Potter?" Blaise asked. Draco tried to keep all emotions off of his faced.
There was a moment though, when Draco thought Potter had seen him, because Potter had smiled-
Draco stepped into his dorm as Theodore Nott was leaving. Blaise was still in bed, but looked awake.
"Do you want breakfast? I can call a house elf." Draco offered. Besides, he should eat too, Pansy had told him to anyways.
"That sounds great." He said, keeping the fear out of his voice. Hermione knew. She'd bring it up. He didn't want to talk about it until he figured out all that he was feeling.
"Now, be careful on how much you take, it has sat a whole week, and is very strong. So, unless you wish to be telling the truth for a month, better not take more than a small spoon full." Slughorn warned, "Now, each of you take the potion, and ask each other a question, though if you already know the answer it isn't really that fun, now is it? Anyway, in a few minuets I'll come around and ask each pairing how they did."
"About an hour and a half." Harry nodded, that wasn't that long if he thought about it. "So, are we going to skip classes today? What to you say, want to join me in the male Snake Pit?" Draco gave a smile. It was almost as big as the one he had had in Harry's happy place.
She was about to turn away when she decided the conversation was not over. "I noticed you weren't in classes today."
"Hey. I know you probably don't want another person here, but Luna has helped me with somethings, and I thought it would be good for you to talk to her." Harry said running his hand through his hair and looking away. Draco hoped his fear wasn't showing on his face.
Until Madam Pomfrey woke him up. She had gently shook him awake and let him go.
But he didn't want to over step. So he did what he did yesterday, he grabbed Harry's hand.
Harry checked the Map again. "The school would be a wreck without me and you know it. Voldemort would have returned 1st year, and it would have been all down hill from there." Draco flinched at that name, he had barley ever said it after 4th year, he knew how much weight it held.
Harry ate quickly, nearly inhaling all the food. Draco raised a amused eyebrow. It wasn't as bad as Crabbe or Goyle had been, but it was still a little bad. Draco nearly laughed as Harry finished while he was  still on his toast.
Of course it was a little awkward, they had only been on good terms for a week and a half. Draco sat next to him, hoping the awkwardness went away soon.
"With parties and games and drinking?" Harry asked raising and eyebrow. He checked the Map again, but Filtch's name had moved, he looked for it, then checked the floor they were on. There was Filtch's name, walking along a corridor ahead of them. He was just turning down the hall they were in when Harry pulled Draco into an empty classroom and closed the door gently. He held a finger to his lips and watched as Filtch's name passed by the door.
Abomination. The word that had truly sent him spiraling. He tried to forget just how much he agreed with that word, but he couldn't. He was an abomination.
So he had is own opinions, but he never went against his father, because he was a Malfoy, and in his fathers mind that meant something different than in Draco's mind. In his fathers mind it meant he was better, stronger, smarter, and over all worth more than the people around him.
tw: panic attack and nightmares
What was wrong with him? Why was a smile so haunting? Why was it Potter's smile?
Draco let a small smile seep across his face, before he caught himself. He hoped they hadn't noticed.
"It comes naturally towards you, you're really easy to dislike." Draco said running his hand through his hair unconsciously. The bun he had put it in fell away, and Harry's heart seemed to want to stop. It had parted to the side and fell like a silk curtain around his face.
Then, the breeze that had felt like fingers running through his hair had turned into someone actually playing with it.
She walked to the potions cupboard and stored the vials quickly. She glanced over at Draco, seeing the open sketch pad in his hands. She gave a knowing smile and stepped into her office, shutting the door behind her.
In. Out. In. Out. In... Out. He commanded his lungs. He willed his heart to slow. He closed his eyes and tried going to his happy place, but it just wasn't the same. Why did his happy place feel different? Why did it feel like it was missing something? Everything was the same it had always been. Lake behind him. Trees below. Mountains in the distance. Him on his broom, alone in the vast sky.
Why had Draco never really noticed how hot Harry was? He always saw him as good looking, but now?
All of course from his photographic memory. He thanked his mother for that. It was why he did so well in classes. Or used to.
"Me too." Harry said in the same soft voice. He lowered the map and looked out of the window to the moon. He came to a stop and peered out to the Forbidden Forest.
"The same as always." Harry responded sitting next to her, she understood what he had meant.
Harry snorted and let out a small chuckle. Smiling pleasantly at Draco. Again Draco's heart leaped from inside his chest. Great. That was absolutely just lovely.
He looked down at the blank page in his lap. He had been so caught up in hating himself, he hadn't drawn Harry.
Draco sighed with relief. A distraction.
That was how he found himself in a secluded corner of the Library, thinking about anything but his essay.
He found a smooth, uncut place, just at the head of the snake, dangerously close to his wrists. Not that he cared.
Harry Potter was supposed to save everyone. Harry Potter was supposed to end it. Harry Potter was the only one who stood a chance. Yet in the end, it hadn't mattered, because people died. Good people, who followed him to battle, who trusted him. They would never be able to do anything ever again, their last act was following a boy with no experience and no plan into battle with some of the most evil, cunning, and vicious people that one could find.
Draco's day took a turn for the worst.
He finally had enough of his hair and did a quick charm that put in into a small bun. Then he put is wand back into his pocket and paced back and forth in front of the fireplace.
"Does it only open to that? Or can you just say something along those lines?" Draco asked as Harry searched for Filtch's name.
Even the 1st and 2nd years got it bad from older students. How shallow do you have to be to make fun of a 11 or 12 year old because they wore green? How 'brave', or 'wise', or 'kind' did that make someone?
"You much have a lot to make fun of me for, considering how many times I've almost died in the last seven years. At least twice each year, not including the one summer dementors had attacked me and my cousin." Harry said pulling his knees to his chest.
Draco opened the curtains and locked the door. "Locking me in? What do you plan to do with me in here?" Harry asked jokingly. Draco fought a blush.
"Green." Of course he had no idea if this was true, but neither would Hermione.
"You'd know all about kinks wouldn't you?"
As Harry came in and sat down, Draco let out a small breath of relief.
But why should he ignore it? Why should he let himself suffer? Hadn't he done enough of that today? Why couldn't he escape? Who cared anyway?
"No, I've never tried. I just go down to meals like a normal person." Harry said, looked up at the canopy over the bed.
But he could feel the eyes on him from all around the Great Hall, he tried ignored them. Why play into their hands, if they really wanted to hurt him, they would, and he wouldn't be able to stop them. Wouldn't want to stop them. No amount of taunting or confronting could change that.
Draco didn't even try to dodge, there was no point. She had hit him pretty hard, and he took a step back, only to be tripped by a small Hufflepuff boy behind him.
"It's because I'm wondering why you're still here. There's nothing to do, and I'm sure Granger and Weasley will be wonder where you are." Draco said putting the chart in his robes and moving so he was leaning on the headboard. He stretched his legs out behind Harry's back and crossed his arms.
Neville's was the worst, it made Slughorn age, and no one could figure out what he did wrong. And they started the next potion, Veritaserum.  This one they would need to be partnered for, and Ron immediately joined Hermione. So Harry looked around, everyone else was paring up, but he felt like he should pair with Malfoy. He didn't know why exactly, but he felt like he needed to.
Draco had never let any one mess with his hair. But he trusted this unknown person more than he had trusted anyone he had ever known. He had even stopped allowing his mother to touch his hair.
"Not really, unless I have a reason, I never really had the time. Between sleeping and foiling plans of the people who wanted me dead, I didn't have time to take a stroll though the castle." Harry said checking the Map again, to see if they were in the clear, but mostly so he could stop himself from starring at Draco. The soft moon light seemed to make his hair glow a dull white light, and Harry wanted to touch it. But he wouldn't, that would be weird, and they had just started to become friends. Harry didn't really want to ruin that.
"No. I only went into your room and 'Accio'ed it. And I wouldn't invade on your drawings, I figured you wouldn't like that." Harry said softly. Draco didn't think he was lying.
When the sorting was finally over, Harry's throat felt soar, but he felt a twinge of happiness. He had brought the school closer, and that meant, maybe, this year would be better than his first, and that was all he could hope for.
What was she doing here? Why was she talking to Draco? Harry felt like he was in another dream.
"No promises." She said as she closed the door behind herself.
Traitor. Death Eater. Murder. Bastard. Evil. Abomination. Shit. Whore. Less. Useless. Unwanted. Disappointment. Unloved. Not Worth It. Just Like His Father.
Eventually, his flowers shifted from the light green of curiosity to the dark blue of sleep.
They weren't friends. They didn't talk to each other. They had despised each other for years. Yet here was Harry, rushing to his rescue like they cared about each other. But Harry did care. He cared because Draco had given him silence. He found himself turning the doorknob only to find it locked. He cursed and used Alohomora. He opened the door as slowly as he could just to keep him from throwing the door open and scaring Draco.
Draco was really glad Potter hadn't said anything, he really didn't feel like starting things this early. But he was prepared for it when Potter walked in. Thankfully Potter understood that it was indeed to early to argue with anyone. But he knew if it was Weasley, he would have been hexed, or just told to sod off at the very least.
Draco rolled his eyes. "I'm not denying anything. I only watched him because he was my rival. You two wouldn't understand."
And he was the one screaming. In fear, in pain, in panic. His skin so cold it burned, arms numb, legs aching, mind searching for something, for why, how…
"What's his favorite colour?"
He thought it had something to do with his mother, even though she never stopped the excessive punishments that would fall upon him with he would step out of line. She would sit there, and look away, as her son fell further away from her. Yet after each one, she would hug him tightly, and look at him as if she had a million words she wanted to say, but she never did. But when his father wasn't home, she would sit silently by him, then tell him one thing again and again, as if anything more might cause more harm then healing.
"Very insane." Was all Harry said. And the rest of the class was spent in a comfortable silence, just like their mornings.
He turned around ready to walk away if it was someone else wanting to tell him he should be rotting away in Azkaban like his father, but it was only Professor Clawford.
“It’s going to be okay.” He whispered softly, reacting his head in the crook of Harry’s neck, trying to put as much support into his words as possible. Harry’s sobbs quieting down, his shaking lessening, his breath finally steady.
"Harry?" Hermione shook him out of his thoughts, "Harry, I said you should get your robes on, we'll be there in 10 minuets." She looked at him slightly concerned, Over the summer he tended to zone out, and she had hoped that the school would help him focus more, but she was still worried as any best friends should be. Thankfully she didn't mention it.
This was the last time he'd step off this train onto the grounds. He had already decided he wouldn't go home for Christmas, it was always lonely now that no one visited. Not that those who visited before had been welcomed guests. Or guests at all.
He probably got a little sleep, because he looked at the clock and it was nearly 3.
"Well, if you insist." Draco looked at Harry for a split second before both boys started laughing. "With all this flirting I might think you gay." Draco said, his heart stopping, maybe he was gay? Or bi? Draco had a chance if he was bi.
He curled his fingers around his palm and drew circles with his thumb. He hoped the small gesture would help. He hoped Harry understood all that he was trying to say with it.
When they did git up, neither spoke as Draco let go of Harry's hand.
Harry's eyes. Gemstone green. They stood out against his darker skin. His eyes were a lighter, jade colour, with darker, murkier rims that bordered his pupil and the edge of his irises.
"Not you too. Please, I deal with it enough." Draco mumbled, but he honestly wouldn't mind a pet name from Harry.
That had been his fathers doing, much like everything in his life.
The reason why was hiding, running, he couldn't catch it. But it seemed important.
"Still in denial." Pansy said shaking her head sadly.
"Ronald." Only Hermione and Mrs.Weasley called him that. "Just because we're together doesn't mean we can't be friends, and do friend things. Besides, the 3 of us aren't dating, we can't leave Harry out of it." She turned to Harry, but he didn't say anything.
"MALFOY! DRACO!"
"No problem, mate. Have to spoil my godchildren somehow," Ron laughed.
She hadn't been killed by the killing curse, no; these sick people used sectumsempra on a pregnant lady and let her bleed out. Harry's hand subconsciously rubbed his stomach. Harry had taken the potion to let him carry a child only a week ago.
"Harry?" Draco questioned from the door.
Draco smirked mischievously and picked Harry up by the waist. Harry giggled, wrapping his legs around Draco's waist. Draco kissed his lips hungrily, carrying him up the stairs. They finally reached their room, and Draco shut the door quietly behind them.
"Dad... Dad left for a bit," Harry lied, "You two are going to leave for a bit too."
"With all due respect, it's a sweater and jeans, father," Draco stated. Lucius became red, clearly outnumbered, and opened his mouth to protest. Narcissa promptly stuffed a croissant in his mouth, shaking her head. Draco tried to stifle his laughter at the indignant look on his father's face.
"Thank you, Malfoy," Harry smiled then looked down at the tie, " Wow, you're way better at this than 'Mione."
They sat there with their beautiful twins for what seemed like hours until a knock on the door snapped them out of their haze.
"Who do I need to dispose of?" Pansy said, twitching.
"You have to, princess," Harry sighed.
He smirked lightly. He was two inches taller at least. His shoulders were broadened and his muscles were beefier. Gorgeous pearl-white wings protruded from his back, the tips frosty blue. He smiled at the strong canines. It was his eyes that put him off. It wasn't like Snape said. He had only been fully transformed for a few minutes at most, and his iris' were flooded with blood red. It was a good look; Draco just wasn't expecting it.
"NO!" Harry shouted as they cuffed Draco. "YOU CAN'T TAKE HIM!"
Harry left the house an hour after searching for evidence. He was going to need a long nap to settle his stomach after what he had just witnessed.
"Would you boys like anything from the trolly?" the witch pushing the cart asked lightly. Ron practically jumped up and Harry shook his head laughing while standing up. He placed a few gallons on the cart.
There was a long silence by Harry's quiet sobs and sniffs. Finally, Harry broke it.
"They're so beautiful..." Draco whispered, cradling Maeve in his arms. Maeve had pale skin and bleach-blond hair. Her eyes were a greyish-blue, with hints of green.
That was all it took. Hermione's lavender apron was discarded, replaced by a jacket. A Patronus was sent to Molly to watch the kids because of an emergency. Hermione grabbed Ronald's hand and apparated to Harry's house.
"Malfoy...Malfoy!"
Two Months Later
Fleur + Bill
"No shit, I've been wearing them every day since the day I was born," Malfoy chuckled, "Let's go before we're late for the feast." Draco picked up his trunk and began to leave the train. He found the carriage Pansy was in after a while and sighed. "Thank Merlin, you have a shirt on."
"I suppose," Draco said, shifting uncomfortably. "He was very nice to me at first. Sweet, almost. He looked after me, made sure I was safe and comfortable, and that nobody within or outside the club messed with me for my orientation, since he knew what it was like to be gay in that sort of world. I'll admit that I was rather taken at first."
How much of him was the Draco that Blaise had known? How much was the Draco that Potter knew?
It sounded odd. And most likely dangerous."I have no idea what any of that last part means," Draco admitted, still trying to take in the idea of Potter actually bringing Draco here for any of whatever it was that Potter was expecting them to do.
With a startled yelp, Draco was suddenly hauled to his feet by the man, who had appeared without warning in front of his chair. "So, we're agreed then?" he asked in a low voice, leaning forward to press a kiss to Draco's chin. His lips slowly trailed upward to cover Draco's mouth, and all Draco could do was moan a shaky
Draco glanced over his shoulder to glare at Blaise but whipped automatically back around when he felt hands settle on his hips and begin gently tugging him forward.
"Shit, shit,
"You all heard him threaten me!" he cried dramatically as he turned to the others, clearly expecting them to back him up.
They both shrugged, appearing unapologetic. "We were bored," Seamus explained, bending low to take his shot. The sharp clack of the balls striking one another made Padma jump.
"Then it's a good thing you make me so happy, isn't it?"
something, anything. He wanted to flee, chase, fight; wanted to run so far he would never find himself again, sprint so fast his heart would never stop hammering in his chest. Sometimes he really could not bear to remain still, halted and unmoving, cemented behind stone walls with nowhere to go, locked away in the castle with nothing to do but boring, mind-numbing mundane trivialities. Like fucking
Well, fuck that. He would not be cowed into hiding within his own fucking home; not ever again.
"Always," Draco wheezed, body frozen in fear.
part of
"Didn't I?" Draco wondered in surprise, eyebrows rising. Had he never told Gregory about his and Blaise's relationship? Idly, he tapped his armrest with one index finger as he thought back on it. No, Draco supposed he never had. "Well," he began slowly, unsure of how to phrase his response, "You were living in Germany when he and I first started seeing one another, and…we weren't really keeping in contact by that point or anything…" his words trailed off in shame. The excuse sounded weak even to his own ears. Why had he just allowed Gregory, someone he had befriended practically at birth, to just fall from his life so easily? How hard was it to pick up a quill?
"More like how lacking we think you really are," Pansy grinned.
Draco felt his heart stop completely. "How could I not, Harry," he said softly, feeling faint from the sudden hope surging through him, "when I love you this much?"
With another sigh, Harry climbed to his feet, deciding that he would give it another day and then reach out to Draco again. If Draco ignored that one too, then, well, Harry supposed he would have his answer.
"Harry," Hermione said quietly, reaching out to pull him to a stop. She gestured up ahead with her chin, and Harry's head snapped in that direction, noting instantly what Hermione was looking at. A door farther down the corridor was open, the interior dark, but Harry could just make out what appeared to be an unmoving foot extending past the threshold and into the hall.
Were they truly friends? Was it actually possible? It appeared to be real, but Draco was terrified to trust it, certain that the moment he did, it would disappear. Would Potter disappear too, once it was all over? Once the case was solved and Draco's life was no longer in danger, would he simply fade away like the others had? Would he even say anything at the end or would he simply vanish without any sort of farewell?
"No," Malfoy said in an odd tone, turning to give Harry a strange look, "you haven't, Potter."
Well, other than magic, he supposed. And ghosts. And homework.
to Malfoy? Maybe Harry had only ever served as a distraction from all the many horrors stalking the blond. In the past few years, Harry had learned, through his own experiences and through watching his friends, how often sex could be driven out of fear. What if Harry had only ever been a means to forget—and what better distraction than sex? With a pang, Harry wondered if that was how Caelix currently felt—as if maybe the brunet had intentionally led him on.
on first dates, but you were raised in a family of super posh high-cultured toffs, yeah? I'm sure you know at least one place we can go."
Weasley was the one who answered. "Daphne said it was outside on the balcony railing when she entered the room."
"My aunt and uncle never liked me," Harry said quietly, ignoring the tightening in his chest. There were very few things he hated more in the world than speaking about his childhood to others. "They were the ones who took me in after my parents died, but they never wanted me. I was forced at a young age to cook and clean for them, while my cousin was allowed to sit in front of the telly for hours at a time and eat all the food I had made. And…" he took a deep breath before continuing, "I never had a proper bedroom for the first ten years I lived there. I was kept in a tiny cupboard under the stairs, one that had a lock on the outside. If I disobeyed them or displeased them in any way, I was thrown in there and locked in, with nothing to do and nothing to eat, and I had to wait in there until they felt kind-hearted enough to let me out, usually when they were hungry and my aunt didn't feel like cooking or one of them needed something cleaned. There were so many times I would have panic attacks as a child from being locked in there for too long, but it only made them threaten to keep me in there longer, said I deserved it for being a burden. They would even lock me in there at night to sleep because they didn't trust me not to steal food or roam around the house or something. And even now, I can't handle feeling trapped like that, Malfoy, I can't handle feeling restrained in any way because it puts me right back there in that damned cupboard. And I especially can't handle something like that from somebody I should be able to trust because I should have been able to trust my aunt and uncle but I never could, because they never cared about me. And I can't handle the idea of not being able to trust the person I'm with when I should trust them more than anyone else in the world. You—you really scared me today, Malfoy, when you did that, I wasn't expecting that. So you can't
He was there, and he was warm, and he was saying such lovely things, things that may very well be lies, but they sounded so nice to hear. Nobody had ever been in love with Draco before, or ever told him as much, even as a lie.
"Apparently you do," he grinned. "You were the one who brought up wanking, not me. And you brought up
Harry said nothing, mouth tightening as he looked away. Yes, he knew he was walking a dangerous line with Draco, but he didn't care. He could handle whatever the Death Eaters threw at him.
Blaise gave an elegant shrug. "That either means that you hate the chair because it's preventing Potter's arse from being seen clearly enough to study, or you hate it because you're jealous of it."
"Maybe not," Blaise shrugged. "Maybe you never intended to or ever thought of it as using him. But you went into your friendship knowing exactly who he was and how people would respond to him, and how they would respond to you as a result of your being friends with him. So don't blame Draco for doing the same thing, especially when I was the one who pushed him to do it. Because you don't know him, Weasley. You never truly have. And you have no idea how he feels about Harry."
"See?" Pansy said brightly. "Aren't we learning so much about each other already?"
With a start and a sudden flash of panic, he wondered if Malfoy was all right. Had anything happened to him? Maybe this was a distraction—make them think the killer was focused entirely on Daphne, while they were really out snatching Draco.
Draco blushed. "If you want it to. That was pretty good too, I suppose."
The next morning found Harry late for breakfast, after having once again dreamt of Draco Malfoy, the pale blond hair becoming alarmingly familiar in his dreams. Ron had already left without waking Harry, something he had noticed the redhead doing more and more often.
"She wanted to punish me," Malfoy whispered, sounding pained. "She thought it would be the perfect revenge. She had been humiliated by my refusing her, even if my sexuality would never have allowed for anything between us, and thought that by slipping me a love potion designed to make me unable to help but act on my pre-existing desire for you and fall into a different state of obsession, rather than real love, it would be the perfect revenge. She believed that there was no way that you would ever even consider me as a romantic interest, let alone return my feelings. She thought that if she gave me the potion, I would grow even more obsessed with you and throw myself at you—hopefully somewhere embarrassingly public, I'm sure—and get immediately rejected, becoming heartbroken and humiliated and I would then finally understand just what it was that I had done to her." Draco gulped, eyes sad. "But that's not what happened. I did become obsessed even more with you, and did approach you, and did throw myself at you, but…"
"This is why
"Malfoy," Harry said softly, reaching out to touch the other boy lightly on the shin, praying to god he wasn't bruised there as well. "Malfoy, I'm not here to hurt you, I swear it. I didn't even know you were down here."
"I was thinking more like close friends," Harry interrupted wryly, shaking his head in amusement. "But if you want, I can definitely say all of that as well."
Draco groaned and dropped a kiss onto Harry's head. "Of course I love you, you idiot. Honestly, as if there isn't a single person who isn't in love with the Chosen One." Harry opened his mouth to argue the statement, but Malfoy continued before he had a chance. "Especially when you play all Slytherin like that, using my attraction to you as a weakness against me, I quite approve. But I do not throw tantrums," he stated fiercely.
"Now you, Smith," Ron growled, and Smith's hand tightened around his wand. "If I have to rip your whole hand from your body to get that wand, I'll do it."
Just like the first time he had witnessed it, the sight of Draco Malfoy crying forced Harry to a frozen stop, unable to do anything but watch with horrified, pitying eyes at the sight of the once-proud Slytherin crumpled in a heap on the cold stone floor of a hidden corridor, sobbing in a way that nearly broke Harry's heart.
"Hey," Harry said quietly as he approached.
With a flash of guilt, Draco suddenly thought back to earlier that morning. He had kissed Blaise. It had in no way been initiated by him, but he had responded nonetheless. Had
The words were met with silence as Potter simply stared, frustration etched across his handsome features.
An endless parade of doors flashed before Harry's eyes, only distinguishable by the distinct creak of the hinges as the door was opened, and the final, sharp click of the same doors slamming shut. Every single room in the house seemed emptier than the last. The only thing filling the empty rooms beyond cobwebs and cold walls were piles of dust and shadows, along with an almost haunting silence that seemed to make the very air feel frostier. Harry shivered as he shut yet another door behind him, sighing into the chilly air of the corridor and imagining he could see his breath fanning before his face. Was it really as cold as it seemed or was Harry simply imagining that the darkness of the house could not be anything but icy? They had been searching for Stephen for what felt like hours, and yet they seemed to be no closer to finding him than they had been when they started.
Finally, Cyril wore himself out with his anger and with a last look of disgust, threw Vincent violently away from himself. Vince landed heavily against the wall and crumpled to the floor, curling up and trying to make himself appear as small as possible. He let out a small sniffle, one that earned another contemptuous glare from his father.
Harry didn't stop running until he was absolutely certain there was nobody following him, feeling dangerously light-headed as he ducked into a narrow corridor hidden behind a large tapestry. "Fuck," he whispered hoarsely, burying his face in the safe darkness of his palms and breathing deeply for several minutes, holding the inhalations in his lungs for as long as he could as he tried desperately to calm himself. He would never, ever get used to the frenzied and oftentimes demanding attention that the swarming mobs of the wizarding world forced on him against his will. At school, it was not normally so manic as that; not like it was outside the castle. Harry shuddered as he thought back to the first and only time he had attempted to visit Diagon Alley after the war. Just the memory alone was nearly enough to send him into a full-on panic attack.
Without another word, the four Gryffindors swept from the room, the sounds of Justin's sobs still ringing in their ears.
me already, Potter, for fuck's sake!"
? He was about to shower in another man's shower and about to wear another man's clothing to bed—what the fuck was he doing?
"Like you lot don't know how to do Dark magic from a distance," Smith sneered, and Zabini took a step forward.
"A magician?" Malfoy's nose wrinkled as he tilted his head in confusion.
The man's eyes narrowed dangerously. "The pit?"
"Er," Harry fiddled with the hem of his t-shirt. "The day that Goyle showed up."
," he stressed the word, "you love me as much as you say you do, you'll respect what I'm telling you right now, and give me time to think, Blaise."
And now Draco Malfoy
"Well, the other two doors are still warded," Ron finished, frowning.
Without warning, Harry ducked his head and took one of Draco's nipples in his mouth, licking around the area and gently tugging at the bud with his teeth, and Draco couldn't help the way his back arched or the sound that slipped from his throat. Feeling increasingly desperate, he ground himself against Potter as best he could, wondering if he was really ready for such an experience but knowing it was already far too late to stop. He could not remember anything in his life ever feeling as good as the sensation of Harry pressing back against him and nibbling his way across to the other side of Draco's chest.
"Look," Blaise sighed, "I'm not sure what happened, but maybe just give him some time, all right?"
Without another word, Harry tore open the fastenings to Draco's trousers before ripping both trousers and pants down his legs in one smooth tug, tossing them somewhere over his shoulder before raking a heated stare over Draco's mostly naked body.
Chuckling, Draco reached up and swiftly unwrapped the black band holding it up, allowing the hair to tumble free. It flowed past his shoulders and along his spine, ending in the small of his back. Harry wanted to bury his face in that hair, wrap himself up in it and remain there forever. He ran his fingers through it, loving the silken feel, so very different from his own hair. Running his fingers through Draco's hair was like running his hand through still water.
Maybe he should just push the blond up against the wall and kiss any doubts he had away. That was definitely an appealing solution. An angry Draco was beautiful.
"I want you to call me Draco again," the blond whispered. "I want you to stop looking at me like you're scared of me. I want you to stop taking one step back for every step I take towards you."
"Just fucking leave already, Potter!" snapped Malfoy angrily—it was quite
"Anthony," Neville said quietly, hands held up in a placating manner. "Just give us all a chance to talk this through, all right?"
Draco would live.
With a smile, Harry bent forward to capture his mouth in a kiss before trailing his fingers down to finally grasp hold of Draco's cock, which was somehow warmer than he had been expecting. He began to move his hand slowly up and down, relishing the way Draco whimpered and sighed as he pressed himself closer to Harry's body. Harry released him long enough to snatch at his wand once more, casting a quick lubrication spell before continuing to stroke him. Draco clutched at his arm and moaned into his mouth, unable to remain still as he twisted and writhed. It was the hottest thing Harry had ever seen. He pulled back to watch for several moments before kissing Draco even more fiercely, tightening his grip and speeding up the movements of his hand.
"A true Slytherin hero," Blaise nodded. "The Gryffindors don't know shit about true selflessness and heroism."
"I hope so," he inclined his head, still smiling. "I'll let you know the moment I do, all right?"
"I dunno, maybe we should go ask Potter," Pansy said in a sly voice.
Wishing he had never entered the library and faced this awful dilemma, he took a deep breath before pulling out the chair next to Harry and sitting down heavily, startling all three Gryffindors. Harry turned to him in surprise, eyes widening in delight as a smile spread across his face, and Draco struggled to keep a similar expression from taking over his own face at the sight. Across from him, he could see Weasley narrowing his eyes at him in suspicion, while next to the prat, Granger stared at Draco impassively.
Potter, however, stood tall, with a quiet confidence and a hushed aura of power that instantly drew Draco's attention. The ugly glasses from his youth were gone, replaced by thin black frames that seemed to cast a certain dangerous glint to his eyes—eyes Draco was certain had never been
Draco smirked. "Have not been touched by anything other than your own hand in years."
Embarrassment and shame swept through Harry at the words. Wescott was right, of course. Harry should not be focused on his personal interest in Draco Malfoy. He needed to focus on the case, he needed to find answers and stop whoever was behind this. Solving the case was far more important than his own selfish personal life. There was no time to involve himself in trivial dramas with Draco fucking Malfoy, for his own sake as well as Malfoy's.
"Did you find anything on either of the boxes?" he asked, attempting to distract himself from the thought twisting through his guts.
"I can't—we can't," he shook his head. "This is all just—too much. I'm still not even sure what's really going on here! It's just too much too fast, Malfoy."
Cyril Crabbe sat trembling in the chair he was bound to, fingers scrabbling against the wooden arms as he struggled uselessly against his holds. But something wasn't right…something was different about him…Harry echoed Scrivens' gasp as he watched Crabbe's hair thicken and turn from dirty-grey to chestnut brown. His nose shortened as his chin rounded, cheekbones shifting higher and fingers thinning somewhat, becoming more delicate than before. His chest expanded as his shoulders became less broad, neck thinning above the new features. Feeling horrified, Harry watched as Crabbe's entire body adjusted and changed, becoming someone new. Someone Harry had certainly not been expecting.
him? Did anyone still need him anymore? "Need me?" he pondered aloud. Needed his what? His name, his money, his fame, his power? Needed him to throw himself recklessly into a dangerous situation with only a simple hope he would come out alive? Needed him to be the face of a generation? The poster child for justice and mercy and benevolence and love? Needed him to be the vanquisher of Malfoy's demons? Needed him to once more be a shield between evil and the world? Needed him to once again offer himself up as a sacrifice? Play the martyr? Did the world see him in any other terms? Wasn't that all he was good for? Suffering and dying? Harry didn't know how to be
"She's right, Harry," Ron said quietly, and Harry glanced up to see him kneeling behind Hermione, gazing at him with pity and concern, compassion and sorrow shining out from his blues eyes. "You didn't know, none of this is your fault. And you certainly didn't rape anybody, so stop telling yourself you did. And anyway, he couldn't press charges against you even if he wanted to. You're not the one that gave him the potion and you had absolutely no knowledge of it the entire time you two were involved. It was Greengrass who's responsible and she's the only one he has a real shot at pressing charges against, especially if the potion nearly resulted in the loss of his life."
a nasty voice in Harry's head reminded him, and it was a voice he could not argue with.
The hands on Draco's waist slid higher, slipping beneath the hem of Draco's shirt and clutching at bare skin. Seek pulled back, breaking the kiss only to immediately latch onto Draco's throat. He scraped his teeth over the trembling skin before nipping lightly, laving over the area with his tongue. Draco moaned and clutched at the man's head, tightening his hands in the black strands of hair tickling Draco's chin.
"Aren't all ponies technically babies?" Pansy wondered, settling herself onto Blaise's bed, and it was then that Draco noticed she had changed into one of Draco's long sleepshirts that he kept in his trunk.
do, but had he blushed? He supposed Oliver had said more than one thing that had brought heat to Harry's face yesterday, but those had all been friendly jokes, surely. There was no way that Oliver had any sort of feelings for Harry; surely Malfoy was simply imagining things out of jealousy. Wood was a professional Quidditch player now—he was handsome and famous and had money and could date anyone he wanted. And why would someone like that want Harry? Harry was far too thin and uninteresting, and he was also still in school. Surely Oliver would want to date someone his own age?
"Fine," Greyback grunted. "Nothing a drink won't fix."
Draco, I swear it! I did NOT kiss him back and I am NOT interested in him! You're the ONLY person that I want to be with and I can't even begin to tell you how sorry I am for hurting you like that, but I won't ever make you feel you can't trust me again, all right, not ever again!" As he spoke he started drifting forward unconsciously and found once his words stopped that he was much closer to Malfoy than he had originally been.
Cae shrugged. "Anything is possible, I'm afraid."
"I am not," he argued. "I am a deeply complex individual; you couldn't ever even hope to understand me or delve the mysteries of my many complicated layers."
It would not matter, even if he could somehow find it within himself to move his gaze. He would not see the man.
Blushing, Draco pulled him back in for a gentle kiss, one that Harry relaxed into with a smile. But the next second, the man was once again pulling away. "I like you too, Draco," he said breathlessly, stealing a quick kiss. "So fucking much, you have no idea."
Potter pinched the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger, mumbling under his breath. Draco caught the barest snatches of his mutters, random words such as "same" and "never change", as well as his name and what suspiciously sounded to be a rather impressive array of profanity. He merely kept his arms folded and waited for Potter to look up.
"So it went well then?" Blaise wondered, sitting up to gaze at Draco speculatively. "The plan is working?"
"Telly, Malfoy," Harry laughed again. "And deal."
"And provoked Harry to flirt back," Hermione added, not bothering to hide an uncharacteristic smirk she traded with Ron.
for?"
"Don't you worry, Professor," Blaise cut in, grinning like a maniac, "we'll help Potter collect them all."
It was over? Wait, what was over? School? Them? They couldn't be over, Harry would not allow it! He would not allow their relationship to fade away—he wanted Draco and he wanted him forever. He wanted to wake up to Malfoy's relaxed smiles and sleep-mussed hair every morning; he wanted to fall asleep wrapped around Draco's warm body every night. He wanted to have someone to come home to and wanted someone to come home to him and he wanted that someone to be Draco.
"Yes?" Granger asked turning to face him, book pressed against her chest as if she was hugging it.
One that often came to him. It was really more of a memory, but it hurt him.
"Here." Harry huffed, pushing the box into Draco's hands before trying to catch his breath. Draco opened it suspiciously, but as soon as he saw what was in it, a look or disbelief married to his face.
Because of Harry's wink.
No, someone would miss him. He was wanted. He would not be forgotten.
Everything was perfect.
"Hello Harry." She said in a very Luna Lovegood voice, soft, full of some kind of wonder, and sweet. "How have you been?"
Surviving this year was going to be easy, as long as the insane author he had to deal with let it.
It was almost like he could already hear the laughter. The teasing. The whispers. He could feel the stares.
They were all titles they threw at him, they wanted to hurt him, he couldn't blame them. He was a unwanted, unloved, useless, murdering bastard. He was a Death Eater. His mark would never go away. He was never going to erase what he had done.
She took it and gave a  small smile. "Thanks."
“Harry?” Hermione slowly stepped forward and tried to place a hand on his shoulder.
What could you say to someone who had seen you so vulnerable? Draco hadn't brought himself to look Harry in his eyes after he had hugged him.
Dusty blue faded into orange. Orange faded into the dark violet of twilight.
Draco then wondered, did he look peaceful in his sleep.
Harry found himself wanting to say 'I don't know', but what he said was, "Because someone once said that insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results. So I sat somewhere different to avoid insanity." Harry himself didn't even know that was the reason, but he guessed his mind did.
"Of course not, you need to be babysat at all times. Who knows what you would get into on your own. Crazy things like killing teachers and basilisks." Draco offered in a factual tone. Harry rolled his eyes but smiled.
"How long do we have 'till people start to wake up?" And ruin the moment. Harry honestly couldn't wait to spend the day off from classes with Draco.
But Harry looked so broken in his arms. So scared, he was shaking, she was hanging onto Draco’s shirt for dear life.
Draco found himself exited when footsteps echoed around him. But Harry wouldn't walk so loud if he was trying to sneak in. He was smarter than that. Maybe.
They asked him what he thought with expectant eyes, he couldn't help but give a small smile and tell them that it was the best dinner he had ever had. They were over joyed at this and Draco found himself enjoying the elves.
"What is is favourite colour?" Hermione asked softly, at least she knew when to drop a subject.
The last thing was Draco. His white blonde hair cascading around his face in a silk curtain. A brilliant smile was married to his face. On which Harry had never seen on Draco's face. His grey eyes brimmed with laughter and warmth. He was wearing a black long-sleeve shirt that met dark jeans at his waist. He was leaning back on his hands that were pressing against the soft dirt. The sunlight from a unknown source shone on his hair and gave his a golden glow. He looked stunning. Draco was absolutely gorgeous. Harry's breathe caught at the sight of his looking so happy.
"Fangirlling is not the same as liking someone as a person." Draco commented. "But you too unobservant to notice the difference anyway."
When he stepped back she smiled and said, "That's what friends are for." Then she left him standing in the middle of the hospital, tossing the word 'friends' around in his head. He was really going to cry. But this time it didn't seem as horrible. She was his friend.
The day for Harry once again consisted of him watching Draco when ever possible. He looked at Draco in DADA, at lunch, and when he passes by him in the common room after classes. He wanted to talk with him, like he did that morning. Talk about easy things. Simpler times. This morning was the best morning he'd had in while. The easy smiles were the best part. He felt like he didn't have to pretend he was okay.
He sighed, that was probably the best he was going to get. So he made his way to the common room after getting dressed and getting his sketch pad.
"Ah." Draco said nodding, but Harry knew he didn't really understand.
Harry had said he understood feeling like it was though.
"Yes. He's half dressed. Just don't use my bed." He called after her as she went in. They weren't really together last time he checked, but he still liked to tease them.
Draco nearly jumped out of his skin. His heart kick started and he tightly closed his eyes. "Blood fuck Potter! What the fuck? How did- You have an Invisibility Cloak?!" Draco said now seeing the cloak Harry was folding neatly by him. "Of course you do." Draco sighed and placed a hand over his heart, which hadn't calmed down yet.
The eye contact had caused it. He had not been expecting Harry to look him in the eyes.
Without a word, both boys made their way back to the Hospital Wing.
It was the day, over Easter break, when Harry had been dragged to the Manor. But it did not begin with the 5 prisoners being brought in.
Draco started to wonder if Harry would come back at all. Harry had said a lot of things, things he probably wouldn't have said around Draco under any other circumstance. Harry probably didn't want to deal with Draco.
He silently walked to his bed and placed the sketch pad on a side table next to him.
Draco looked and was a loss for words.
The sun was above him, never moving. Tall grasses blew in a soft breeze that fluttered through his hair like fingers.
As they passed, Draco smirked, "Yeah, you should listen to your Mudblood," He almost physically flinched at the word, he had never liked saying it, but he was a Malfoy, "girlfriend. She's the only one that would stoop low enough to date you."
"How did you find me?" Draco said, though Harry couldn't see Draco's face, he figured there was a cautious look on his face, due to the way he asked.
"That's not even the best part." Harry said, practically whispering in Draco's ear, he was leaning in close to look over Draco's shoulder to see. Draco suddenly became all too aware of the lack of space between them, he could feel the warmth emitting off of Harry's chest. His heart jumped a little.
"I had a fan club?" Harry asked shocked. Did he really not know?
"Actually, if you'd been paying attention, you would have heard Professor Slughorn say it was a potions master who knew what each ingredient did separately and came to the conclusion that mixing them together would create an enlarging potion. The only thing he didn't know was how to add them in. He wasn't mental, he was brilliant." Hermione said in a voice that often amused Harry, because it sounded like McGonagall, but Harry was already zoning out.
The world slowly came back to Harry. As his eyes fluttered open, he looked around him. Green and silver adorned the walls and bed spreads. For a second he wondered why everything was green, then he remembered, he was in Draco's room. He must have fallen asleep in the relaxing silence Draco brought with him. It felt good to get some restful sleep, though it didn't feel like he had been asleep for long. He rubbed his eyes and closed them again, listening to the room.
Draco had finished his drawing and had started to draw the Whomping Willow, when he looked up at Potter and found he had fallen asleep.
"You should just have to be cautious like the rest of us." Draco said teasingly.
But this year it had started to change. Because of the Sorting Ceremony.
It was like an itch, and it wouldn't go away easily.
Harry nodded, "I wanted to give it back to you after your trial, but you had already left when I was leaving. I wanted to give it back to you in person, so I didn't owl it to you. Then I forgot I had it in my trunk."
"I have perfect posture, I can assure you. The finest teachers in the world taught me. Do you doubt them?" Draco shot back. This banter was relaxed, fun, calming.
One of the reasons he had seen though the illusion that Malfoys were better because they were Malfoys, was his heart.
"You'll have plenty of stories to tell your grandchildren Golden Boy. Those things though, would be for you." Draco said as they turned a corner into a corridor with no windows. The sudden change in light made both of them pull out their wands and use Lumos. Where moon light gave Draco's hair a pure dull light, the light coming from his wand made and eerie dull light glow from his white blonde hair. But were, in different way, strikingly beautiful. "We should do it."
They never bothered to make friends with Slytherins. They never bothered to act kindly. That was why Slytherins kept to themselves. Because everyone else judged them before they had gotten to know them, and it hurt.
Way too soon, he left, he didn't want to leave, but he knew Ron was going to wake up any minute now and he needed to be there when he did. And he started the day with Ron telling him about his dream, which Harry didn't pay any attention to. Then breakfast came and went rather quickly, he hardly remembers siting there for longer than 10 minutes. Then Charms was easy, they were once again reviewing simple charms, and Harry found himself impatient, but he didn't know why. What did he have to look forward to today?
Harry felt calm and happy, because all the problems he always seemed to struggle under, lifted when he joked light-heartedly with Draco. Sure there were other, not so comfortable feelings that lurked in his mind, jumping out at him when he least expected. But the good feelings, the ones making it earlier, they made it all worth while. Harry had suffered for a long time, he was glad to feel free, even if it was temporary. Draco made him happy. It was that simple. But also very complicated. All Harry knew for sure was, he wouldn't have been able to survive this year with out Draco. What started as silence had morphed into friendship and understanding. Harry chose to ignore the feeling that he wanted it to turn into something more than just friendship, sleep deprivation works wonders on a person.
They were breath taking.
Draco knew he should probably stop him mind from going there. To stop before it was too late to back out. Because Harry Potter was straight. So they would never be together.
Harry nodded and leaned his head back and closed his eyes. He probably hadn't gotten much sleep.
Draco rolled his eyes, Pansy always just played along with his jokes, knowing he'd always win any retort contest she started.
Now that was a class he would really need to focus in. He was never really fond of potions, and he blamed Snape for that, but the professor had been a good man in the end. And Slughorn would be teaching, so it wouldn't be that bad. He hoped. He did well last year he was in school, but that was thanks to a book he had found. This year was definitely going to be hard. He just needed to get at least 5 N.E.W.Ts of Exceeds Expectations. McGonagall recommends he go for Transfiguration, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Potions, and Charms. Harry also hoped to add Care for Magical Creatures to that list. With of course Apparition, all Aurors needed to be able to properly apparate.
It had started when the first kid was called, a thin boy with curly blonde hair and small face, was sorted in to Slytherin. At first it was only the Slytherin table that cheered, and some 8th years, then, something unusual happened. Harry Potter, the Pride and Joy of Gryffindor, stood up and cheered. Soon, his friends joined in. Then the entire Hall was cheering for this new Slytherin.
He didn't deserve to be happy ever again. He deserved to always suffer.
The Hobbit is my favorite book, and the movies are really good...
He frowned a little. How long had he been thinking? Did he even have time to draw him this morning?
"Like this." Luna said and tapped his arm with her wand.
"Sure, I could use a walk around the castle. Not like I have anything better to do anyway." Draco said placing his sketch pad down next to him. Over the hours, he had finished a few drawings, and he had just started a new one. Harry still hadn't asked what he was drawing, but he suspected it was him. Every now and again Draco, when looking up, would look at another part of Harry, like his hair or robes, then sketch again.
"Draco?" He head Pansy say softly, of course she would ask.
Love y’all.
That was it. The smile.
He looked down at the blank page and started with basic lines. First where Potter would be on the page, then a very light sketch of the chair he sat in. The scratching filled his ears and he began to fully immerse himself into his drawing.
"Leave a note and don't let her know where you're hiding. You could hide in my dorm. No one would mind and it would be the last place they looked." Draco offered, his eyes meeting Harry's. Harry just searched his eyes for something. He didn't really know what he found but it made him smile.
"You just want me in your bed." Harry replied sarcastically.
He looked where they were facing, and saw Draco Malfoy ignoring a group of 6th years that were making fun of him. Malfoy walked off pretending not to notice them. He walked off in the opposite direction, and Harry wondered why he was going. They had lunch, then the 8th years had Transfiguration. But Malfoy was going down another hall. Not that it mattered to Harry. Malfoy was is own person, he could handle himself. But Harry found himself worrying about Malfoy during lunch none the less.
What had woken him? What had made him come out here? Why did he seem so upset? Yesterday was bad, but Draco had hoped that he had helped. Maybe he hadn't done enough.
In fact he had almost went to the Great Hall for breakfast. But he decided that other people may not be so kind to him as to speak with him.
"Only so I could make fun of you later for it." Draco responded matter-of-factly.
"I'd like to see you try." Harry said teasingly.
Yet, like everything in Draco's life that seemed to be good for him, sleep slowly seeped away from him soon. He never really got sleep anyway, and his tiredness felt normal.
"Really? Didn't you go to the Yule Ball with her?" Harry said, but did Draco hear some relief in his voice? But why would Harry be relieved that he had never dated Pansy?
He was going to survive this year. He was. Because Harry cared for him.
"As if that wasn't what you did to me. Having a double standard, how very Slytherin like of you." Harry shook his head teasingly.
"Harry?" Once again, Hermione broke him out of his thoughts. "Do you want to talk about something?" She said softly, knowing Harry's mind had been wondering.
~*~*~*~*~
"Oh. Uh... well... er... I have this map... of Hogwarts... that... well, er... shows everybody... in the castle. Where they are, what their doing... every minute of every day... So I opened it, and found your name... Then I was that there was a lot of people around you... So I went to see what was going on." Harry bit his lip, he had started blushing more.
"Afternoon." Draco said courtly.
When there was a reason.
The question took him by surprise. At least Harry hadn't pressed the colour of his flowers. "At Madam Malkins'. We were being fitted." Draco said recalling the memory. He hadn't even know it was Harry Potter he was talking to. It must have seemed outright awful. But of course he had, he was awful.
Harry woke with a start, like he did so many times before. Sweat dripping down his face and eyes wide. Nightmares still dancing evilly through his unawake mind. Screams and laughter and all the usual things. But, something about that nightmare was off, wrong, truly life threateningly scary. It was Hermione and Ron laughing, a fierce cackle, doubling over in, tears streaming down their cruelly smiling faces.
Why was there even a reaction in the first place, it was Harry.
"I bet. I mean, the entire room? On the ceiling? Lord, my aunt and uncle would have a field day with that. Granted it would have been hard considering I slept in the cupboard under the stairs until the my first letter arrived. They were worried they'd get in trouble for mistreating me, so they gave me my cousins second bedroom." Harry said as if living under the stairs was completely normal.
"That wasn't the worst thing they did." He smiled sadly. Suddenly Draco felt his blood boil. He wanted to find Harry's relatives and hex them. Then he thought, that was how the Malfoys treated everyone else. How he had treated everyone else.
"They punished me and wouldn't hear reason." Draco was taken back. Punished him? For accidental magic? Even when he accidentally died his Fathers hair dark blue, he wasn't blamed. "There was this one time, they had my hair cut short, because they didn't like how untamed it was. Then I grew it back, and my aunt nearly died. She almost shaved my head, except my bangs. 'To hide that hideous scar.' But over night it grew back. Lucky, they couldn't find a reason for that to be my fault." Harry laughed at the memory.
The size of the fireplace made Potter seem tinier than he really was, but Draco liked it like that. It seemed to emphasizing that the Savior of the Wizarding World was still young.
"You're happy." Luna noted, packing up her paints. Draco just looked at her with astonishment. "It reads your moods. It's a simple charm really. I gave Harry a chart of all the colours if you want to look them over, but guessing is always fun too. I need to go now, I'll leave you two be." She said and started to walk off.
Draco Malfoy had barley been able to stop himself from adding to his collection of scars on his left forearm.
"Well, I can check for internal problems easy enough, and I'll grab some ice for his face. Do you know who did this?" She asked and Harry shook his head. He silently cursed himself for not writing down all the names that had been there. He could be so stupid. "Well." She sighed and her wand started to emit a dull yellow light. She hovered over Draco's abdomen and the light turned purple. "Broken ribs. I'll get something to heal those up." She briskly walked off and returned with another vial and an ice pack. "Here. I'll check in on you in a few minutes. I assume you'll be staying, Mr.Potter?" Harry just nodded.
"I understand." He said in a soft voice, filling the silence of the bathroom with those two words. He looked at Draco, his face was still blank, so he continued. "I understand what's it's like to be pressured into doing something you don't want to do. Be someone else for the people around you. I understand what it's like to have your entire life planed out for you, but no one tell you until it's too late to change anything. I understand having whispers about you follow you around because of one mark. I understand what it's like to feel helpless, to want to get away from it all. I understand what it's like to feel like you deserve to be hated. I understand feeling like everything is your fault. But... It's not your fault... Draco," He said his name, it almost felt weird on his tongue, he looked over at Draco and noticed a single tear was starting to fall. "It's not your fault. You don't deserve to be treated like shit. You're a good person. You're the reason so many people are  alive today. Maybe you don't see it, but Draco, I do." At this point, Draco was crying. Tears streamed down his face, but he stayed silent.
Harry resurfaced as the one thing on his mind keeping him from work. Harry fucking Potter. His stupid face, and stupid hair, and stupid kindness. He was hard too hate, once you got to know him, but Draco wished to anyway. If he hated Harry, he would not have to harbor a crush on him, and things could go back to normal.
As he relaxed and fell into his drawing, he felt as if surviving this year wouldn't be that hard, because the silence that was held was nothing less than perfectly promising.
But he was still glad they were there, even if they didn't speak. Because he might explode if someone hadn't been there.
"Then we'd both be dead, and wouldn't have helped anyone. To be honest, I'm glad we're both not dead." She said. The lines she was making looked more and more like large flowers.
Sure he had the unfair advantage of the Map. But he wasn't invisible. How could he sneak past Madam Pomfrey's watchful eyes that never seemed to rest.
"We should go to my room before Nott and Blaise wake up. Nott won't ask too many questions, but Blaise won't leave us alone." Draco said after and hour of sitting and talking about nothing.
They were all like sheep without a single thought of their own, Draco thought. But even he found himself clapping for the Hufflepuff that was sorted next, and for the Gryffindor that bowed as she got off of the stool.
"You can call me Harry." Harry said gently. Sure Draco had been calling Harry 'Harry', in his mind, but out loud was different. It held more weight.
Someone was humming a song he had never heard before. It was sweet, and soft, and filled Draco with peace.
"They were so obvious. It was annoying, honestly. They followed you around like lost puppies. They gave me death glares and threatened me to leave you alone. It was hilarious." He had, on many occasions, been told to leave Harry alone, 'or else'. He laughed them off and ignored them.
Harry remembered what it was like when he fixed his wand with the elder wand and held it for the first time in a long time. "You're welcome," was all he said.
"Only slightly." Harry agreed nodding his head. "But I am the one who found you, so it's only fair if I'm the one that helps you through the boredom." Harry said pulling one of his legs up onto the bed.
"Stag, but that's common knowledge."
He saw Harry looking over at his flowers. He pulled his sleeve down. "I'm fine." He muttered and clenched his jaw.
He held his hand.
If Granger had just told him off, he wouldn't have complained, he doesn't deserve her forgiveness. But it would have sent him spiraling down again.
Harry reached over and gently took his arm. He slowly unwrapped it and looked at all the scars. They both found themselves in silence again, The two newer ones had healed, joining the sadly large number of existing scars. Harry suddenly had an idea.
High-pitched and terrible. They made his blood curdle. He knew that Bellatrix was hurting her, someone innocent. Someone brilliant, with a bright future.
"Maybe I will." Draco gave a dramatic wink and Harry laughed.
"Anyone would be dumb not to. Just because I found someone as good-looking, doesn't mean I had a crush on them." Draco said definitively.
"I could have helped you." He said, fighting back a sob. He could have helped more. He was a horrible person. He ignored her screams, her cries for help. How could she forgive him?
"What?" Draco asked commenting on how Harry had suddenly shook his head.
Through out class they took notes and answered questions that she would throw in to check if everyone was paying attention. Soon the class was over, and most people headed to the 8th year common room, or their respective dorms. Hermione suggested they sit and talk about their day, she had said that it was good to talk things out, especially after a new experience.
When Harry talked, Draco was reminded of the humming from his dream.
So Harry helped Draco stand, holding him by his elbow and shoulder. Draco stood, and stared off into the distance, but walked with Harry. Draco had slightly bent over and was clutching his stomach. Harry wondered what had happened, and clenched his jaw. He hated seeing people hurt. They slowly made their way to the Hospital Wing, which wasn't that far. Thankfully they didn't run into anyone, Harry did not want to deal with questions. All he wanted was to take Draco to the hospital and see that he got better.
"What if he doesn't want to talk and I just make things worse?" Harry said, he thought of his silent mornings, what would happen if he no longer had those?
"A hobbit." Draco said shortly.
And McGonagall read the first name, and one by one, everyone was sorted. Everything was the same. Except, now when any house was called, everyone applauded.
Well, here's some stuff???
It was going to be a very long year.
So Draco drew it.
"Lovely." Draco said standing and helping Harry up. He let go of Harry's hand, though he really didn't wan't to.
She had given him a chance to prove himself. Hopefully he had surpassed what she had thought of him. Draco even surpassed what he thought of himself.
Useless.
But he didn't look to see who it was. The dream knew, so he had no reason too.
Even thinking about it, Draco felt a pit in his stomach. Potter had smiled, while he was in the room. Draco didn't know why he felt so oddly about Potter smiling, but there was the pit in his stomach that showed he felt something.
Silence. Like this morning. Why couldn't he stop thinking about this morning? There was something about it, but he couldn't put his finger on it.
Draco ran his fingers threw his own hair and flipped it to one side. Draco wondered what was going though The Chosen Ones head that allowed him to sit still for almost 30 minuets. Draco could barely sit still for 5 if he had nothing to fidget with. But it didn't matter.
Harry immediately tensed up and his next breath let no air in. “Hey, Harry, Harry, it’s okay, hey, calm down, it’s okay.” Draco said, tring to get him to stop panicking. “Harry,” Draco gently cupped Harry’s cheeks and tilted his head up. “Hey, breath, just breath, okay, in…” Draco breathed in, “and out…” he breathed out. “Come on, in… out… in… out… that’s good, okay, everything is okay, just breath.” Harry’s breathing returned to a semi-normal pace and Draco pulled him into a hug.
As he walked in, he was Harry was already there. Draco smiled, looking down at Harry.
That stung. Draco didn't know why, but hearing that from Saint Potter hurt. He didn't show it though. He watched the Trio walk into the classroom, and he felt his left forearm burn. It did that every now and a again.
Harry was not okay. Draco sat down next to him, not knowing what to do.
As Draco thought over what that meant, he knew with a little peace, he could survive this year.
Before he really knew what he was doing, he pulled Harry into a hug. He wrapped his arms around Harry's neck and rested his forehead on Harry's shoulder.
"Actually, I got the Cloak first. I got it for Christmas... First year... From Dumbledore..." Harry ran his hand through his hair and gave a meek smile.
His fault, because he was Harry Fucking Potter. He didn't deserve to be praised, he should be shunned, left alone to die forgotten. Yet people wanted his autograph, wanted to talk to him. When those who died would never talk again. He felt alone, so very alone in his own mind. Lonely and trapped. There was no escape, no way to get fresh air, no way to leave his thoughts behind. And he got claustrophobic in his own head. The way the thoughts seemed to press in on him from all sides. He knew there was no way to let them out. No way to stop them, and he felt he couldn't breath.
He knew he couldn't skip dinner, but he didn't want to go to the Great Hall. Because every time he saw people, it hurt because it reminded him of what he had done to them. They looked at him as if he had the words 'Death Eater' stamped across his forehead. But in reality, it was tattooed on his left forearm.
He ran into his dorm and stopped in front of his trunk. He searched frantically before he found the box he was looking for. Grabbing it, he ran back to the Slytherin dorm, where Draco was now standing looking very confused.
THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS UNTIL HARRY'S POV HAVE GRAPHIC DEPICTIONS OF SELF-HARM
~*~*~*~*~
Draco Malfoy cried silently. Tears streamed down his face, and his heart seemed to be getting crushed by all the words spoken to him that day.
"Sorry, I must be boring you." Draco said suddenly coming to his halt of the explanation of how a dragon had started to massacre a town on a lake.
He also started to think about today in potions, the silence they had both been fine with while working together. Harry was glad he had partnered with Malfoy, anyone else would have wanted to talk to him. Mostly about the war. Always the war. Did people not think of anything else now? Harry was really glad Malfoy hadn't wanted to talk about the war. Harry knew it probably had something to do with what Malfoy had gone through. Though he didn't know all of it, Harry knew there was more to Malfoy than what met the eye, even if it was buried under layers of ego and slurs. That was one of the reasons he had spoken in Draco Malfoy's defense at his trial.
The houses where a mess. Everything about them. The system was flawed.
Harry went to bed round 10, not wanting to stay up any longer. He knew that tonight, he would get a peaceful sleep like he had done the night before, especially with the promise that Draco would  be there in the morning.  Unlike this morning, when he had still been in the Hospital Wing. Even though Harry hadn't woken up from a nightmare, he had still found himself up before everyone else.
Scum.
"I didn't have a crush on Potter. Please, I have standards." This was getting irritating, what were they going on about.
"Yes. Have you never tried to get the house elves to come to your dorm? I even know most of their names." Draco said, slightly unbelieving. Maybe it was a Slytherin thing.
Midnight quickly approached the two boys as they sat in the hospital wing. Harry had completely exhausted the topic of homework and quidditch and the conversation threatened to die. Not that Harry wasn't okay with the silence, just Harry didn't want to leave Draco alone with his thoughts at the moment. Harry understood the way your mind always tended to betray you with unwanted thoughts and feelings. But Harry had ran out of topics that he wanted to talk about, topics that were safe from bad memories.
But now, the things that once brought Draco so much wonder, felt dark and distant. Somewhere between that day, and a year ago, when he had last star gazed, he had lost the childlike fascination of them.
He didn't know why, but the other boy just always seemed to loom near his thoughts, and he didn't like it. Why would he be thinking of Harry Fucking Potter on is own free time?
"There is no new guy." Which was true, Harry wasn't knew in his life. He just saw hims differently was all.
Funny, Draco thought, Slytherins guys must have a thing for Gryffindors. Not that he'd ever say so. He'd give himself away, and Pansy loved saying 'I told you so'.
"Yeah, I guess. Just give me a second to write a note to Ron. I won't tell him where I am so they won't look for me. I'll take the Map though, to make it seem like I'm not still here." Harry said as if he'd been thinking about it.
But, Slytherin wasn't free from inter-house bitterness. Slytherins viewed everyone else as below them, pressed this idea onto the younger Slytherins. They never tried to be greater, break the stereotype. They became what others had accused them of, evil.
It wasn't like he didn't deserve them, he did, he knew it. He was the one who let the Death Eaters into the castle, but it still hurt.
Fortunately—or unfortunately, Harry couldn't decide—the need to begin spouting whatever came to mind vanished with the arrival of Ron, the redhead suddenly entering the sitting room through a different doorway than the one he and Malfoy had come through, the one that led to the drawing room.
The danger was gone, Voldemort was dead; most of the Death Eaters had been killed or captured, with the Ministry dealing much harsher punishments than they did the first time around. Lucius Malfoy was given no leniency this time for faking servitude under the Imperius Curse.
At his words, Draco felt hysterical laughter threatening to spill from deep within his throat. "You can't save everyone, Potter!" The hand on his shoulder felt suddenly far too hot, the touch now somehow scalding. Draco jerked his shoulder away in one sharp movement, standing and stepping backward out of Potter's blistering grip. "You hated her!" he accused, glaring at the Auror. "You hate all of us!" He was breathing heavily, straining beneath anger that felt like a physical burden weighing him down, one he was struggling to carry.
She shifted her weight between feet, and Draco noticed a heavy bag slung over her shoulder.
Feeling more than a little dazed himself, it took Draco a moment to comprehend the other man's words and even longer to shake his stupor. When he finally did, he was unable to fight the grateful moan that escaped as he reached down to lift Harry's legs up higher, pulling out an inch or two before rolling forward and sliding back in, keeping his movements small and shallow as he circled his hips. Harry groaned loudly as he pulled at Draco's waist, attempting to bring them closer together. Bending down, Draco covered Harry's mouth with his own as he steadily slid out more and more every time, pressing deeper inside with every returning thrust as he gradually began to set a slow, deep pace, one that they both seemed more than satisfied with.
, Draco thought, sighing internally. It was hardly the same thing—everybody wanted Potter, everybody was dying to get a piece of him. The only thing everybody was dying to do in regards to Draco was to get as far away from him as possible. "Deal," Draco said, stealing another kiss. "We only share ourselves with each other."
"C-can I hold one of them?" Hermione asked beginning cautiously to look between Hazel and Maeve.
"Read and... yeah, I read," Draco looked down with a smile.
"Then I'll-oh, we're here," Pansy smiled as she skipped off the wagon. Draco shook his head as he closed his book and followed Satan- *cough* Pansy to the Great Hall. They sat in front of Blaise at the Slytherin table.
"Hi, sweetheart," Harry whispered, kissing the crown of his goddaughter's head.
"It's not a guy," Harry said simply. Draco looked flabbergasted. Then he realized something.
"Dear Merlin, is it a pureblood thing to sleep like the dead? You and Ron both are a tragedy to wake up," Harry laughed, backing away enough for Draco to sit up. "We're almost there, so you might wanna get your school robes on." Draco nodded and got his robes from his trunk and changed. It was just their shirts; not to mention that they change in front of other guys all the time because they live in dormitories.
It was August now. Draco smiled as he marked the day off the calendar before folding it and gently putting it in his trunk. He then proceeded to put a set of undershirts, sweaters, and skinny jeans in his trunk, neatly folded. He packed his thick textbooks.
"Now, listen carefully Draco, remember when we went to Saint Mungo's?" Narcissa asked. Draco nodded, "Well, you know how I and your father have creature blood?" Narcissa looked to Draco in question.
They finished dinner an hour later. Ron and Hermione wished the twins happy birthday one last time and went home. Harry and Draco read the kids to sleep, and Harry went down to the kitchen to clean up.
From Ron, Hermione, and their kids, the twins both received matching charm bracelets. They both had heart charms, which would glow red if the other person was in danger. Both had lightning bolts, which would go straight to Harry's watch. It alerted him what state they were in, a lot like the Weasley clock. Dragon charms went to Draco's watch.
Ginny + Luna
"Okay, can we just eat breakfast now?" Draco sighed. They nodded sadly at their son's frown. They ate in silence. Draco finished and excused himself to his room. Draco decided to read till Severus came. He thought of the book he wanted and held out his hand. He watched as the book sored from the bookshelf without hesitation. Draco was a lot more powerful than most thought. He could perform almost seamless wandless magic and his wand only magnified his power tenfold. He sighed and opened the novel and read in silence at the time ticked by.
"N-nwever?" Hazel asked gently.
"I hope you rot and die in that cell," Harry said in a cold, emotionless voice. Draco inwardly grimaced at the tone.
Draco's eyes shot open. A messy-haired Potter hovered over him; his hands on Draco's shoulders from shaking him awake.
______________________________
"Draco..." He looked past Voldemort to see his mother. She had thick tears running down her fair cheeks, she was reaching out to him. The only thing holding her back from coming forward was his father's arms that were tightly coiled around her waist. His father's face was twisted in agony. He knew that they knew.
"Yes, we need to talk about your...issue. We have time seeing as this potion needs to sit for four and a half hours." Severus looked over at Draco. "So I take it your parent explained the most important details?" Draco nodded firmly. "Good, so do you have any questions?"
Hazel began to clap excitedly. "Bwubbles!" she squealed. Bubbles were one of Hazel's favorite things. Maeve loved bubbles too, just not as much as Hazel did.
"Mother was throwing formal dinner parties almost every day, saying I need to meet wealthy suitors. So, pretty lame. You?"
"Yes, love, bubbles." Draco smiled sweetly at how precious his daughters were. An entire year and he still couldn't get over how amazing his daughters were.
Blaise + Neville
"Agreed," Harry said, smiling at the bundle in his arms. Hazel had raven hair and the same pale skin. Her eyes were the same deep emerald as Harry's.
Harry looked at his two precious little girls, sleeping without worries. He smiled sadly, tears still rolling gently down his cheeks. Hazel's eyes fluttered open gently.
"Your features will be enhanced and you will have an alluring aura from being veela. Your eyes will probably brighten and glow when feeling strong emotions. You'll have your wings, retractable like your mothers. Your canines will be longer. Those are probably the only initial changes, maybe a change in height and mass. Most importantly though, when you get thirsty, your eyes will get blood red. The thirstier you get, the more the red will pollute your iris. This means you will have to use charms to hide it," Snape answered fully. Draco nodded again.
Thank you for reading this book! Before you continue, there are some things I want to clear up.
Harry sighed, and made his way to the stairs. He walked up the stairs that seemed to end in his doom, but then maybe they did. He decided to not tell Kingsley about the baby he was carrying. He couldn't lose anyone else, he just couldn't. No one would know anyway. The only ones who knew about the baby, other than Draco, were Ron and Hermione. He reached the top step and took a deep breath, here goes nothing...
-this book is focused on my version of a Harry Potter next generation (however main characters from the series are very present in this)
"A-alone. S-sad," her soft voice replied, giving very little signs to having just finished crying. Another pair of strong arms encircled them.
Maeve and Hazel were taken to the nursery to rest. Harry was informed that they could leave the next day. Harry was incredibly happy. He had his wonderful husband and two precious little girls. He had a family, a real family. He wanted this happiness to last forever. He wanted this to last forever.
"You see, you're rare because most don't survive. You have special...requirements," Draco raised his eyebrows, "You need blood as all vampires do, but the twist is that you can only feed on werewolves. You won't need as much blood as regular vampires, but you still require it at least once a month," Lucius finished looking at Draco sadly. Draco's eyes widened considerably.
"Look, simply stating that making out half-naked while on a train of kids can get you put on the muggle pedophile list," Draco laughed as Pansy squawked.
He sighed, sinking into an empty compartment. He sat in a corner and pulled a book from his trunk before tucking it away. He flipped to the bookmark with his thumb. He read for a few minutes before the door slammed open. 'Will I never get peace?' Draco sighed marking and closing the novel.
He shook his head and decided to rid himself of dried blood and the scent of alcohol. He lightly turned on the shower, making sure the stream of water didn't touch or ruffle his wings. He sighed in relief as the water dulled the leftover pain to faint to a slight ache. The water washed over his new features with a relieving sensation. He washes the smell off of him with vanilla body wash. He gently weaved his shampoo covered fingers through his hair. He washed it out as he thought of the day ahead. He turned the knob to the water and got his towel and dried himself carefully.
"Present time!" Draco shouted excitedly. Harry rolled his eyes, smiling.
"We haven't died yet," Harry winked subconsciously. He continued as though it never happened. Draco sighed and open his novel back up. He drifted off as the light conversation surrounded him.
They're late... really late. They're never THIS late. Maybe I should-, her thoughts were cut off by a slam and quick steps, which was followed by a bellow.
"Drink, Draco," she whispered, holding out the vile. He quickly realized what the red liquid was. He nodded and slowly took the vile from his mother. He opened it with hesitation. The smell reached his nose and he, all of a sudden, could feel how hungry he really was. He felt almost a primal urge come over him. He downed the red liquid in four gulps. It soothed his burning throat. His eyes fluttered slowly and his parents watched as the red drained from his iris'. Draco tilted his head forward again, a calm to him he rarely possessed. His face was relaxed and there was a slight red tint to the crease of Draco's lips. He placed the empty vile onto the table gently. His mother looked worried.
"So I may be totally screwed?" Draco asked putting his head in his hands.
"Yes. Firstly, what will I look like exactly?" Draco asked steadily.
"Uhh...Blaise bought me clothes for Christmas last year. He said I looked nice in them," Draco answered shyly, "I forgot to comb my hair, it's the middle of summer, on a weekend."
"Hey, buddy!" Harry smiled.
"Harry, there is...one last thing I need to speak with you about," Kingsley said, voice dripping with remorse. He put a hand on Harry's shoulder gently, bracing himself for what he had to do.
"HERMIONE!" her husband's voice rang through the house, sounding panicked. Hermione ran to the sound, worried.
He opened the door gently, not wanting to wake the twins just yet. He snuck in undetected, closing the door behind him. He looked at the two cribs in the back of the room. He walked up to the cribs slowly. They were matching brown mahogany, with soft lavender blankets furnishing the insides. Inside each was a young, innocent, beautiful girl. They had family that loved them and promised to never leave them. Little did they know...
Draco smiled at the calendar. 'Two weeks till I turn 16.' He pulled a baby blue sweater over his head. He zipped the fly of the black skinny jeans he had thrown on. He was too lazy to bother with his hair; it's his own house anyway.
"Where dad?" she asked, looking around for Draco.
"Isn't that dangerous? They could bite me! Not to mention I have months till school and I don't know any werewolves!" Draco's voice filled with panic and his heart began to beat faster. 'This is it, I am going to die. Why me?' Draco thought in fear.
"What are you wearing? Have you heard of the invention of the comb?" Lucius spit. Draco coughed.
(Deceased)
I am pretty sure I got most of the main characters but if I missed anyone you want me to consider just say so. (Most I didn't list are canon) Also, sadly Snape and Dumbledore are still dead for the plot (sorry :( ) If you have any suggestions, they are welcome :)
"They took Draco to Azkaban, 'Mione."
"The only werewolf we kno- is it Lupin?" Draco's voice hardened.
"So, what did you do over the summer?" Draco asked lightly.
"Ron? What is wr-Malfoy," Harry's face scrunched up as he huffed and sat beside Ron. Draco raised an eyebrow.
Hermione sighed, glancing at the clock again. If Harry, Draco, and the kids didn't show up soon, the tea and biscuits were going to be cold.
One Year Later
"Okay," Harry said simply, draping his arms over Draco's shoulders.
The attacks didn't stop there either. Every week, two to three attacks occurred. This continued for a month before progress was finally made. Harry wasn't too happy about this progress, however.
"How is it that the ice prince of Slytherin, who is supposedly heartless, such a dork?" Blaise smirked at Draco with a raised eyebrow.
It was Draco's birthday. Pansy, Blaise, Crabbe, Goyle, and Theodore just went home. Draco was a bit dizzy from them breaking into his father's Firewhiskey. He stumbled into bed after stripping from his jeans; planning to sleep in his grey sweater with his boxers. A small sigh escaped him after curling up in his blankets. He was out in seconds.
"Honestly, I mean I actually learned nothing last year. Ms. Umbitch didn't even let us use fucking wands in Defence! WE ARE WIZARDS AND WITCHES! For Merlin's sake, that woman gets me fired up!" Pansy calmed down a little bit after realizing she was yelling.
"Hey, Draco, Pans, what's up?" Blaise smiled.
"Okay, mother!" Draco called back. He shut and locked his trunk. He picked it up easily and ran down the stairs. Narcissa smiled at him lightly and held out her elbow. Draco took it and felt the feel of apparition surround him. He opened his eyes to be greeted by the familiar sight of Platform 9 3/4. He set down his trunk and said his goodbyes to his mother. She kissed his cheek lightly.
"They took the twins?" Hermione questioned, fury intertwining with the sorrow she felt. Harry simply nodded, and Hermione wiped a tear from her cheek. She hadn't realized she was crying.
"You had a FAMILY! You traded your FAMILY for DEADMAN!" Harry bellowed. Windows could be heard rattling in the background. "I killed that man with my own WAND! You WATCHED me KILL him, yet supporting HIM is more important than your FAMILY!" Harry screamed. Glass could now be heard shattering in the distance.
"I've heard Potter's pretty hard to dispose of, so have fun with that," Draco chuckled as he pulled out his book and began reading as Pansy verbally plotted Potter's demise the entire trip to the castle.
"Half of them, probably," Draco smirked, biting into an apple.
"Sure, mate," Ron smiled, walking over to Harry's bed. Harry was handed a gingerish-brown-haired one-month-old. She had light blue eyes, identical to Ron's. She gently smiled at Harry.
"Twank you, Dad and Dwaddie!" Hazel squealed. Draco smiled and kissed his daughter's cheek.
-this is also on Wattpad if you prefer that site (https://www.wattpad.com/story/182069159-the-ones-we-lost)
"It is the best option, Harry. They aren't safe here," Kingsley pleaded. He knew those twins were leaving here in the end, by choice or by force, but preferably choice. He wanted Harry to do this willingly, knowing the danger the twins were in by staying here.
"IT WASN'T HIM! IT CAN'T BE! HE P-promised," Harry stuttered, breaking down. Draco had been blank the entire time, hadn't fought when the Aurors cuffed him. He was in too much shock. "H-he said he wouldn't ever support Voldemort...no matter what..." Harry looked at Draco and anger filled him. He started walking toward Draco, fire intertwining with the emerald green eyes. Draco finally spoke up.
"Of course, take as long as you need. When you are done, they will be taken to a muggle orphanage," Kingsley replied softly. He stood up and walked to the kitchen, out of the way.
"What's wrong with him, Lucius?" Narcissa whispered.
They didn't bother knocking but instead bursting in. Loud sobs could be heard from the living room. They ran into a horrible scene. It was a mess, to say the least. Hermione knew Harry couldn't control his magic when he got like this. He was horrifying with his PTSD after the war.
"Are you encouraging this behavior?" Lucius looked indignantly at Narcissa, "This is not a laughing matter Cissa! This is the first step of rebellion! What's next? He runs off with blood traders like his cousin Sirius did? It is unacceptable!" He replied to his wife who was trying to stifle giggles.
"I promise to never leave you alone, princess," Harry whispered.
"You too?" Hazel asked with glossy eyes.
"Was this girl shirtless?" Draco asked. "No, I'm not a perv, but I might have seen the girl," Draco rolled his eyes at the glare he got from Harry.
"Y-yes, but we couldn't have just bought blood as father does?" Draco stuttered.
Lyra and George had been a thing since the 5th year and got married after Lyra graduated (after repeating the 7th year) Fred lived because of a powerful protection charm she put on the twins before the battle but was still in critical condition. He lived and got hitched to Angelina Johnson. (Ik, plot but whatever because of everyone else being taken and they're cute kinda <3) Both couples have children but you'll have to wait to meet them. Also, here is a list of couples that have not been yet mentioned.
"She has a point," Harry said with a laugh.
He growled as another wave of pain washed over him. The pain had put him on his hands and knees. His mouth opened against his will as his canines were lengthed. The ripping of his back increased. So he sat in consistent pain for three hours before it eased. The ease took away the ripping, but an ache was left in its place. He heard a slight flutter and smiled. He walked to his full body mirror.
"I am fine, princess," Harry replied sadly.
They played with bubbles for what seemed like hours until a soft hum came from the doorway separating the kitchen and living room.
"Yeah, the twins are so precious, and I wouldn't mind another one running around," Draco smiled.
Harry laughed and picked her up. He rested her on his hip, kissing the crown of her head. "Happy Birthday, Princess," Harry whispered. Draco noticed the droplets of chocolate on the apron around Harry's waist. He must have finished the twin's cake. Ron and Hermione were coming for dinner, bringing Liam and Juliet with them.
"You see...um...Hermione kinda always ties my tie for me, because I can't really do it my self. As you can see, Ron's trash at it too," They both looked over to where Ron was tying his tie like a shoe, "So, I was wondering if maybe you'll tie it for me?" Harry asked with hopeful eyes. Draco rolled his eyes as he began to tie Harry's tie.
They spent the rest of the evening passing around children, joking, and laughing. Eventually, Ron and Hermione had to head home because Liam, their one-year-old, was with the sitter and they couldn't keep them waiting too long. Hermione preferred taking Juliet with her since she was so new, and Hermione didn't trust her in anyone else's care.
"Fine, mother," Draco replied dully as though he was shutting down. He sat in silence as his parents watched him in worry. "Excuse me, I'm not particularly hungry," Draco sighed, pushing away his plate before walking slowly to his room. He pushed through the door and collapsed onto his bed. His parents showed in the doorway a short time later.
"You know what? Fuck you, Ron! What I do and who I do it with is none of you fucking concern!" Granger yelled and stormed out of the hall.
"You two are insane; you are going to have a heart attack," Draco frowned slightly as Ronald tore open a chocolate frog. Harry shrugged.
"I...I want more kids..." Draco stuttered cautiously. Harry beamed.
"W-what happened, Ron? Are you all right?" Hermione was barely audible with shock.
"I was wondering when you two would come to meet your goddaughters," Harry smiled, gently rocking Hazel.
"Those Gryffindors are really something. Were they born in a barn and raised by wolves?" Pansy snarled as one of them caught an entire chicken leg in their mouth, resulting in loud cheers.
"They attacked one of your members?" Draco felt his eyes widen. He hadn't heard a thing about it.
"Oh," Draco mumbled, unsure how to respond. "Right. Well, why wouldn't you."
"That's the most boring opening question I've ever heard in this game," Pansy shook her head. "Do try to come up with something more original for your next turn, please."
"Course you should," Weasley grinned. "Wouldn't want to allow yourself to take too much of the fifteen minutes you set aside for a break each day, would you?"
Returning the nod, Harry swept the Slytherins from the room toward the direction of the large staircase. They followed behind him like hushed shadows, none of them saying a word. The only sounds Harry could hear were the muffled scrapes of their feet against the hard floor beneath them, and the occasional eerie creak of the old house around them. A sudden rumble of thunder broke overheard, startling the six of them. The hallway they were in was dark and cold, without a single window or hint of the outside sky in view, only yellow gas lamps throwing weak puddles of light every few meters. Every door along the corridor was closed tight, and Harry wondered if Stephen and Anthony were behind any of them. But would they be found dead or alive? The house was so impossibly large, how long would it take everybody to find the two missing men? How long would it take to conduct a proper investigation in a house this size?
"God, Draco," Harry panted mindlessly, feeling nearly frantic in his desperation for Draco to touch him, to allow himself to be touched by Harry, to be on top of him, underneath him, to feel himself inside Draco's willing body and know that the blond truly wanted every single touch.
"Yes, Draco, I think that's an excellent plan," Hermione agreed, and Harry and Ron exchanged a glance at her continued usage of the blond's first name.
Harry had failed.
Casting a quick Impervious charm over his glasses, Harry continued farther out into the rain, wondering just who—or what—the other two Aurors had been chasing after. He had only taken several steps forward, however, when he was stopped by a strange noise. The sound of staggered footsteps sounded, followed by the rustling of a bush. Harry tensed, wand drawn and held tightly as he waited. Sudden movement to his left drew his attention and he turned with narrowed eyes, a spell ready on his lips before his wand was lowered in horror as he recognized the man stumbling toward him.
"Goodnight, Draco," Harry whispered in a rough, throaty voice and Draco breathed in sharply, looking dazed.
"I think so," Draco answered uncertainly. "More or less."
"Fuck." Harry could feel Malfoy's growl against his skin. "Who the fuck needs Charms? Useless, horrible class. I won't possibly subject myself to it and I shan't abide you to, either."
Fucking Malfoy.
"Who was it, Potter?" Draco's voice was the barest slither of a whisper. "Who died?"
"Can she not mean both?" Parkinson asked. "My bedmate is also my best mate."
The question seemed to confuse him, and he blinked at her for several moments. "The bedroom?" he said slowly, thinking back. "It was Zacharias."
"Harry! Oi!" a voice called loudly behind the two of them, and Harry froze as he recognized it.
"Did you hear anything during the night?" Harry asked. "Anything at all. Any sounds from the hallway. Anything in your room."
Harry nodded with a grin.
included. It made his body feel warm and his heart thrum faster.
He raised one eyebrow at her. "Do you not remember that Hufflepuff party in fifth year where Hannah Abbott wouldn't leave me alone? Poor girl was obsessed with me. Her persistence paid off, I suppose, in that she did end up getting a drunken pity kiss from me that night. Oh, and there was Draco, of course," he added in a casual tone, sniggering when Harry's hand twitched violently, knocking over his empty shot glass.
Draco laughed sadly. "Not all of us are as fearless as you."
"Dirty sod," he murmured in a husky voice thick with sleep, "watching me like that when I'm unconscious."
At the question, Harry cringed. "Erm, well, he was there when I accepted it."
"What if it's something worse than yesterday?" Caelix demanded, eyes glittering. "Who knows what the hell that sick bastard will send next? For Christ's sake, he sent that girl a fucking
"Hmm," Pansy tapped her chin, "he would have to be something a bit more stupidly heroic, wouldn't he? A more in-your-face kind of animal. Like a hawk or something. They certainly seem a bit full of themselves, don't they?"
, in this room. Let's get you out of here, yeah?"
"Hmm," Blaise hummed thoughtfully, "you might actually be right. All right, I change my mind,
"Too bloody right," Pansy agreed. "Blaise and I aren't even a couple and yet we're still the best couple here. We deserve to have the best name. A proper good one. Try again. And this time, let's put a bit more effort into it."
"Did anybody hear anything at all?" Harry turned to the others. "
it. I wasn't kidding when I told you that this thing has only ever been flown twice." Harry shook his head at the ground. That was just
love! No potion she could ever make could ever even hope to compare to what we have between us!"
"What?" he squawked. "I am not a prude! Just because I don't want to think about any of your weird tits doesn't make me a prude! It makes me normal! I don't even like hearing you lot say the word 'tit'!"
"Something," Draco echoed before shaking himself and standing. "Right, well, I wanted to check the progress and I suppose I have. If there are any further developments, please inform me immediately."
-George Eliot,
The spinning finally stopped as he was spat out onto the familiar hearth of the sitting room. Harry rose to his feet and began brushing the soot from his clothing as he started toward the doorway, but had only taken two steps forward when Pibby cracked into the room, wringing his hands in distress.
"You do know you have nothing to worry about, right?" As Harry spoke, he scooted his chair closer, until he was able to wrap one arm around Malfoy's waist and pull him into Harry's chest.
"Well, if we're not about to be killed, I'm going back to sleep," Nott drawled, sounding bored. "If you start getting tired, Blaise, wake me up and I'll take over lookout or whatever."
Draco—was it really so wrong of Draco to desire such a man gone?
at me. The entire fucking time! He just sat there staring at the table, looking all sad and pathetic and hiding behind his stupid long hair."
She rolled her eyes. "This is as near to it as I want to be, trust me."
"You used his first wand?" Would that even work? Did wands forever identify themselves with their owner, even after the owner was no longer living?
"So," Draco said after several silent minutes. "How, erm, did you get involved with the Hallows?"
"And I'm afraid this latest attack has led to a change in plan," Potter sighed as if expecting his next words to cause an argument. Draco waited patiently—or not so much, really, but Potter wasn't paying close attention—for the Auror to continue speaking. "Until this is solved and the killer caught, Daphne, Ron and I are going to be staying here in the Manor with you."
Harry nodded, trying to ignore the tears still rolling down his cheeks. The Calming Draught had worked in keeping the best of the panic away, but it did not seem able to stop the tears from welling up. How had things come to this so quickly? Harry and Draco still barely knew one another, had only been involved for
For a moment it looked as if Potter would not be satisfied with that answer. But the next instant Potter was nodding and handing the note back. "You're right about not wanting to send any of this information through post. So far we've managed to keep everything from the public out of respect for the families and to keep the investigation hushed. Also, we really have no desire to inspire anymore 'vigilante' work." The word was said with a barely disguised expression of disgust, which for some reason made Draco feel lighter at the thought that Potter did not approve of the public's thirst for vengeance.
! He said something about making you pay!"
"Yes, Harry," Cae sighed. "Look, I
Panting heavily and attempting to regain his breath, Draco felt himself beginning to relax, his muscles gradually starting to unclench as his heart began to slow. In his peaceful, blissed out state, it took a few moments for Draco to become aware of several things—the first was the tiny whimpers issuing from the tan throat that Draco's face was still tucked into; the second was the frantic, almost desperate circling of Harry's hips on Draco's softening cock; and the third was the feeling of the other man's diamond-hard prick poking Draco wetly in the stomach.
The voice responded but Draco was now too far for Harry to hear the words.
One leg slipped off Seek's shoulder as Draco's knees shook, his entire body feeling molten and tingling as Seek finally pulled out only to drive back in immediately, sending sharp stabs of pleasure radiating throughout Draco's core. He repeated the motion, pulling back to look Draco in the eye as he slid in and out, over and over, a fierce look on his face as he stared at Draco with dark eyes.
A sharp laugh like breaking glass tore from Goyle's throat. "He's right over there, Zabini," he cooed, leaning in close to speak in Blaise's ear. "Draco's right over there, tied up and waiting to be gutted. I'm going to carve him into tiny bloody pieces. Right after you."
"It wasn't you I was trying to get away from," Greg frowned. "It was everything and everyone else. I left because…I mean, I dunno, it was just so fucking
"Breaking hearts before breakfast is even over, eh, Harry?" Ron sniggered, sitting up and wiping tears of mirth from his eyes. "Hey, at least this one wasn't thirteen."
A loud creak had him whirling around, wand drawn, but there was nothing in sight. The hallway was empty.
Instead of cheering him up, the thought only saddened him further. Glancing around at the exploded furniture, broken windows, gaping holes in the walls, and mounds of shattered glass, he addressed the elf. "Don't worry about fixing anything, Pibby, or attempting to restore it. Just seal the entire room off."
anything. A kiss is not a promise, after all. He had told Cae to give him time, had tried to express his confusion over the situation as best he could. He had never flirted with the man, never to his knowledge given him any sort of signal before the last couple days that he was in any way interested in him. Had he? Maybe he had without realizing it. But did it actually count if Harry hadn't even realized it? After all, Harry had had it pointed out to him on several different occasions by several different people that he was pathetically oblivious—not his own wording—when it came to such matters. Was this another of those times where they had both read the situation differently? Was that what had also happened between Draco and Harry? Had Harry seen the two of them differently than they had each seen him?
Harry's shoulders slumped in defeat and he nodded. "Well, will you give him a message for me, then?" Blaise considered for a moment before tipping his head in agreement. "Tell him that I'm sorry and it wasn't what it looked like and that I can explain if he'll let me and," Harry paused as he flushed bright red, "tell him that I love him." Zabini raised one eyebrow at that but said nothing.
A single eyeball lay nestled inside the velvet box, reminding Harry horribly of Mad-Eye. Only this one was a real human eyeball, just
"It's there," Zacharias said blankly, pointing to a shut door several meters away. "He's in there."
"He went out?" Ron's eyebrows disappeared beneath his hair. "
Following after Wolf and his pathetic attempts to stand, Harry kicked out hard, catching Wolf in the face and watching a spray of blood hit the dirt with indifferent eyes. A large gash had opened up along Wolf's left eyebrow, leaving rust-colored rivulets running down the man's cheek and obscuring his vision. The blood ran into his eye, staining the pupil red as Wolf tried to blink it away.
"I…I don't know, just…wait." My ears burn and I feel the urge to smash my head against something hard. The fountain may just work, but to get there I would have to step away from the warm fingers wrapped around my upper arm, holding me steady. I cover those fingers with my own much paler ones, only to watch as he snatches his hand back as though my touch caused him pain.
Pansy raised both eyebrows at him. "And you really think Potter's going to just sit there and allow it? Now you're just being ridiculous, Draco."
"That absolute twat?" Pansy began laughing even harder, and Blaise had to move the bottle of firewhisky away from her in case she knocked it over. "Oh god, Granger,
"I appreciate that you came to find me this morning to check how I was doing," Draco spoke in a polite, distant voice, one that made Harry's stomach clench. "But I would really rather be alone right now if that's all right with you." His hand reached for the book lying on the table next to him, a clear dismissal.
, Zabini!" Harry snapped, taking an angry step forward, and Blaise instantly fell silent. "I was asking Draco! What did that mean, Draco, those things you were just saying?"
"Christ, Draco," Blaise said in a wounded voice. "All we did was bet on whether or not you had buggered Potter yet."
"Just spend the night with us, Harry," Ron argued. "They'll be fine. And there's no question of you not trusting us or not being able to sleep near us."
"I already told you, it's a surprise," Potter smiled, but there was a nervous air to them that only served to confuse Draco even more.
Tapping lightly on the wood, he waited for a response, prepared to slink back to the empty bed he had just come from when he heard a quiet voice tell him to come in. The door creaked as he opened it, the brassy, old-fashioned knob feeling like ice against his palm.
"You once deducted points from Gryffindor and then told Potter it was because you didn't like him! And then took another ten points from Granger for being a Mudblood!"
An icy, glaring Malfoy still looking murderously angry. "I told you," his words whipped out low and harsh. "I told you that he had feelings for you and I told you that he would make a move and you
"I think we should speak to the others," Neville said quietly. "Just to make sure that none of them left their room last night."
The lift shuddered to a halt and the anxiety increased as he approached the security desk to present his wand. The wizard on duty did not even glance at him as he checked the wand offered. It wasn't until he read out the slip of parchment and reached Draco's name that he glanced up sharply, eyes narrowed in suspicion. Fortunately, he chose to remain silent, but Draco could feel the man's eyes on his back the entire walk across the Atrium to the lifts.
Harry pinched the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger. "It's not the jealousy that's the problem. People get jealous, Malfoy, everybody does, that's not what this is about. It's the way you were acting about it. You do realize that you literally pinned me against a wall and refused to allow me free until you got your way, don't you?"
Somehow, his glare sharpened even more. "It was Justin. Justin killed Kevin. That's what happened, Granger, that's all you need to know!"
Draco smiled, the expression vanishing in surprise as he suddenly found himself flat on his back, looking up at a tousle-haired Harry Potter looming over him.
"I'm sorry," she said sincerely, reaching out to place a hand on his upper arm. He felt warmed by the contact and was surprised to find her touch much more comforting than he would have guessed of a virtual stranger.
"Welcome to our lives," Pansy shrugged.
"Well, we need to fix that," Draco said without thinking, appalled that Harry Potter, the eighteen-year-old sodding saviour of the entire bloody world, had never so much as owned his own pair of trousers.
"I dunno," Blaise shrugged. "Is it working?"
Whispers.
"Yes," Blaise rolled his eyes, "but my point is that you don't. Ever. Toward anyone for any reason, even if they used to sit up at night helping you study for O.W.L.'s and checking over your Arithmancy homework for you out of the kindness of their unappreciated heart."
"Harry," he corrected quietly, and Draco pulled back to stare at him for a moment before a soft smile lit up his face.
"Okay," he sighed, climbing to his feet and following behind her in silent reluctance.
"It's all right," Harry grinned, shrugging and speaking around kisses. "I thought your dot was evil."
Oh, god.
But then he remembered Wisp's note:
"I thought…" Malfoy started again, tone sounding petulant. "I thought what you said was true." His silver gaze flicked down to stare at the grass, now a dark sea spread across the still grounds covered in a violet curtain of deepening twilight. "I thought maybe you wanted to be with me. I thought you didn't want me to forget."
With a swallow, Harry nodded and rose from the floor, glancing back over his shoulder once before leaving the room. Zabini was resting his cheek against the top of Draco's head and whispering soothingly. One of Malfoy's arms was wrapped around the dark-skinned man's waist, and the fingers of the other were fisted in the chest of Zabini's robes.
"What the hell are you talking about?" Pansy gasped.
"I no wanna leave!" Hazel cried.
"Now, before your father explodes, we are here due to an urgent matter in need of discussing." Narcissa went serious towards the end. The laughs died in Draco's throat as he saw the urgency in his mother's eyes. His father had finished the croissant and nodded solemnly.
