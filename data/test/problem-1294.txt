Harry begins to move his head up and down and massages his balls at the same time. He’s painfully hard himself now.
"Don't worry", Draco reassures him. "I know what you meant."
And since Ron and Hermione are busy snogging, he knocks at Neville’s door.
“You’re a freaking Gryffindor. Grow a pair of balls and tell him how you feel!”, Ron argues and shakes Harry’s shoulders.
Harry licks his lips. “Why here? And why now?”
Draco runs a hand over Harry’s chest. It’s such a soft movement, Harry feels shivers run down his spine.
Harry nods and gets up. Just as opens the door, he turns around one more time. He sounds incredibly sincere. "You're really amazing, Draco. See you on Tuesday."
“Deal.”
Draco grabs Harry’s shoulders and gently turns him around. He grabs Harry’s ass cheeks and begins to massage them softly but firmly.
Draco nods. “Yes. That’s what I meant. I was just trying to say that anyone would literally throw themselves at you.”
hand even brushes his ass. Draco can’t think straight.
“Merlin, I need—
But with Harry, it's different. They stay in the office until it's dark outside, both not saying a word and working on whatever they have to do.
He’s so close to coming, the heat becomes almost impossible to bear. He’s sweating, he feels out of breath, but he doesn’t stop.
Draco snickers. “No, no. Sorry. I just didn’t expect it to be this cozy. I mean, it’s very Scandinavian chic.”
When the phone blinks two seconds later, Draco surges forward and grabs it quicker than a leopard.
Harry nods. “Yeah, absolutely.”
“Fuck. You scared the shit out of me.”
Harry is starting to get angry. “I said no. Thank you. Now get off.”
Harry bites his lip. That’s probably true. “I just needed to escape.”
Harry does as he's being told and begins to cut the Bats' spleens. He carefully avoids getting too close to Draco now, but he feels his presence nevertheless. Draco radiates heat and strength, and a scent that drives Harry crazy.
“Of course you’d order something fancy”, Harry grins.
"Draco, honey, you're just looking for excuses not to get involved with someone. I love you, but you're being ridiculous."
“That is actually fucking brilliant.”
He knows right away what the guy wants from him. It’s not the first time it has happened. And even though Harry is horny, he isn’t in the mood right now. And he’s definitely not the kind of guy to do sexy stuff in a dirty bathroom.
Ron sighs. “Harry, man. Since when are you such a bore? We could dress up, get drunk, and find you someone nice to shag.”
Harry doesn’t recognize that voice. He turns around with a frown and stares back into black eyes. The guy is handsome, no doubt. Tall, black hair, dark eyes, and a stubble. His jaw is sharp, his skin looks smooth, and he has a broad back. Harry forces himself to smile.
Draco presses his lips together and stares at Harry's lost green eyes. How could he possibly say no? He sighs. "Yes, of course."
Even though he already knows the answer, Harry holds his breath. He feels as if he’s going to pass out.
Harry nods and settles into the seat. They don’t talk since Draco feels way too tense and on the edge. The air around them is thick with tension, lust and unspoken words. Draco wishes he could disappear.
“Okay, I’ll trust you with it. I’m shit at potions anyway.”
Harry blushes. “Yeah. I liked it too.”
"I wish I could take the exam in your lecture. Yours is so much more interesting", Harry sighs and steps forward to the counter.
“Why don’t you ask him out on a date? Just the two of you, no drugs, no sex. And then you can get to know the real him.”
Draco gives a few seminars and individual consultations for students needing help with their essays in the following week.
Harry looks at him confused. "You look tired. Are you okay?"
“You’re so fucking beautiful”, Harry breathes into Draco’s ear.
Harry shrugs. „It’s fine, I guess. I’m majoring in Philosophy and Literature since I love reading and writing, but I’m not sure where it’s going to take me, you know?“
Therefore, they made a huge mess in the kitchen, laughing and spilling tomato sauce everywhere. But the pizza actually tasted nice.
Harry tilts his head. “I’m not sure if it’s possible to catch up with Muggles if you never really lived with them. Muggle society is actually pretty creative and also complicated.”
Hermione shakes her head, apparently woken up from her shock. “No, Harry. Of course, we’re not angry. Right, Ron?”
“I don’t know,” Harry lies. “I guess I’m not good at this school thing. Homework is really stressing me out. Also, I want everyone to just leave me alone, you know?”
Harry shrugs. He tries to explain it without giving away too much. He doesn’t know what he’s feeling, and he doesn’t want Draco to think that he’s falling in love with him or that he wants to be in a relationship with him. Which is totally not the case. No, not at all. “I don’t know. I mean, we had already crossed the line. We already fucked countless times to a point where it almost became a habit. I figured a while ago that I didn’t really need a potion for sex anymore anyway.”
Draco shrugs. "I was a dick."
Harry winks at him and guides him to a fancy Italian restaurant. “I hope you like pizza and pasta. This is the best place in London.”
“Yes, but we weren’t ourselves then.”
"You'll be the death of me, Harry", Draco mutters, causing Harry to grin.
Draco positions the camera in front of them shuffles closer and grins into the camera. “Smile, Harry!”
Harry rolls his eyes and presses his lips against Draco’s forehead. “I could stay like this forever.”
Draco feels dizzy walking back to their seats. He gets clogged up by Harry's cologne and really hopes that no one notices how flushed and worn out Draco looks.
Draco begins to roll his hips into Harry’s. “Fuck me, Harry. Hard.”
There, a few balconies away stands the man of his dreams and his worries, smoking and shirtless. Is Draco dreaming? He must be hallucinating. Now he's officially gone mad, Merlin. Draco falls back to the wall and watches the man silently. How could anyone be this beautiful? It’s truly not fair.
Draco arches his back, his mouth falls open, his eyes roll back, and Draco’s entire body tenses. “Fuck, this feels so so so good. You have no idea.”
. “I enjoy it, too.”
Harry hates how rough and desperate Draco’s voice sounds. He bites his lip and continues to fuck him with his fingers. He doesn’t really know what to say since he also doesn’t know how he survived without Draco. He never wants to live without him ever again.
Hermione sighs and runs a hand through her curly hair. “Harry! He probably thinks that you don’t love him back.”
“Here”, he points to the presentation “you can see the plan for Friday. Friday night, we’ll visit a Shakespeare theatre performance at the Harold Pinter Theatre.”
“Hi,” he says as he steps closer to Harry. “I’m Aron.”
Fuck it, Harry decides. He’s so painfully hard. He needs Draco, and he already got his permission anyway. He pushes in without any warning, without being careful. He slides in all the way.
“Hmm,” Draco mumbles. “I think this might be my new favorite smell.”
“I find Katie Bell really pretty”, Seamus sighs.
Draco’s eyes light up. “Seriously?”
Ron raises an eyebrow. He doesn’t seem convinced.
“Oh my god”, Draco moans and throws his head back. “Yeah, please, Harry - fuck - I need more”
Draco’s hands go lower, they rest over the buttons of Harry’s jeans and begin to unbutton them. He helps Harry jiggle out of them and finally roams his hands all over Harry’s body. Harry’s head rolls back. He lets Draco work his magic, allows him to do anything he wants to do.
Harry gets tired during the day since he hasn’t slept all night. At some point, Draco sits down on the floor and conjures some painting paper, brushes, and paint. Harry watches him from the couch with huge interest. They don’t speak, the TV runs in the background and fills the room with soft noises.
“For real?”
Harry opens his eyes in surprise. That can’t be true. Draco Malfoy has problems getting laid? Draco Malfoy? The hottest guy in their year? “I don’t believe you.”
„I’m very pleased that you are all so greatly interested in coming to London with me to catch up on some history together“ Draco begins his PowerPoint presentation.
Then, Draco’s knees fall open, allowing Harry to push inside even deeper. Apparently, Harry must’ve done something right, because Draco’s head rolls back with a scream. “Fuck, right there!”
His breath hitches and he closes his eyes shut and lets his head fall back. It’s all too much. Thank god he's sitting closest to the aisle where it's also the darkest.
Once Harry is happy with Draco’s technique, he turns around and begins to cut up the tomatoes.
“Harry, you have no idea how fucking tight you are. It feels so good”, Draco moans. "Such a good boy, taking my cock and behaving so well."
Draco huffs out a laugh as he falls on top of Harry. "Are you okay?"
Obviously, he doesn’t deny him anything. He poses next to the boy, smiles into the camera, and even gives him a hug. But he still wants to disappear and never interact with any wizard or witch ever again. He knows he’s bright red when he goes back to eating his sandwich.
Harry snorts again. He feels as if someone had punched him right in his stomach. After a few coughs, he stares at Draco. “Excuse me?”
Draco looks up at Harry and frowns. "Are you okay?"
“Lavender, Chamomile, Vanilla, and Honey.”
Harry stares at him with dangerous eyes. “You tell me.”
“May I ask you a question?”
Harry’s head snaps up. “Really?”
“What happened?”, she asks without letting Harry catch his breath.
Harry knew it wouldn’t be easy returning to Hogwarts. He had tried to mentally prepare himself. But standing here in front of the castle, all of his foolish preparations come crashing down on him. He swallows the lump in his throat as he tries to fight the images flashing before his eyes. This year would definitely be interesting.
Draco raises his eyebrows. “What way?”
He can feel Draco smile against his forehead. Draco tightens his arms around Harry. “Don’t worry. I get them too, you know.”
He can feel tears forming in his eyes at the sensation. He needs Harry so much closer, needs to feel his body on his, needs his skin on his.
“You are so fucking beautiful, Harry.”
“That boy is madly in love with you. He literally told you. And he also said, “call me when you’re ready for more”. That means he doesn’t hate you, it shows that he knows you really well.”
Draco nods. “Yes, I am.”
“Did you tell him that you love him back?”
“Yeah”, Draco answers and now it’s his turn to blush. “You know - someone who the Veela wants to attract because - um - because - Well because the Veela's attracted to them.”
Draco casts a cleaning spell on both of them. “This is much better. Now I can relax.”
Draco wipes a sweaty hair strand away from his face. “Probably. Theo, Blaise, and Pansy are all going home. I wouldn’t want to stay here all alone.”
Now it’s Draco whose head snaps around as he looks at Harry through dark eyes.
When they get on their gondola, Hermione and the others quickly walk to the other end to snap some pictures, leaving Harry and Draco to themselves.
Even though Draco isn’t finished yet, his hair already looks better. Draco manages to style it into a neat, Hollywood worthy quiff.
Harry smiles and watches Draco cutting the cake. He takes a huge slice and stuffs it into his mouth. Harry barks out a loud laugh. “Wow. That is a new sight. Draco Malfoy, stuffing his face with cake.”
“Thank you!” Harry presses out. He feels overwhelmed. “Thank you. I really appreciate this.”
Harry feels exhausted. He can’t help but think that he’s ruined their relationship. They were getting along so well, but ever since they hooked up in that club, the whole vibe between them is different. The incident at the club happened without any Armortentia. They were drunk, sure. But Harry
They wake up in each other’s arms, both with shy smiles plastered on their faces.
Harry licks his lips. “But where does that leave us?”
Draco grins and shrugs. “Ah, the good, fun times about being a student. Sometimes I do miss it.”
“So, you don’t have a type? No preference?”
“Harry,” Hermione hisses. “Can you sit still for
Harry presses his lips together. His heart swells inside his chest.
Harry shrugs. “I don’t know. You don’t seem very open-minded. And I don’t want you to think I’m coming onto you.”
“Oh my God”, Draco moans as his eyes roll back. “Yes,
“During what? Please, just tell me what’s going on and what I can do.”
The boy moans as Draco continues to lick his tight hole, teasing him and making him feel good. Draco can't help his own arousal and begins to moan himself.
He follows Draco into his bedroom, suddenly very aware of the fact that he’s only wearing soaking wet underwear and a towel wrapped around his shoulders.
“I can hear you worry. It’s annoying. Go back to sleep.”
Harry tilts his head as he thinks. “I don’t know. A nice laugh, a good sense of humor, intelligence. Someone who gets me, you know? Someone who vibes with me.”
Draco bites his lip and shivers. Harry presses a kiss to Draco’s shoulder blades.
Harry doesn’t need to lookup. He knows who it is. The raven-haired man squeezes his eyes shut and shakes his head. He doesn’t answer. He wishes Draco would disappear again.
” he shouts, hope still simmering inside his stomach. Maybe Draco just went downstairs for a cup of tea? But Harry knows that Draco won’t be in the kitchen. He just knows that Draco apparated away.
Harry watches him. He looks at Draco, wonders how he could ever live without him. He craves everything of Draco. And sure, he doesn’t ever want to lose him, but maybe he needs to risk it all one more time. He holds his breath.
Hermione frowns. “Since when are we eating again?”
“I mean,” Harry rows back, panic building up inside of him. “I’m not attracted to you! Like, not at all. But, you know, many people consider you attractive. That’s all.”
“Blaise and Pansy said they were watching you flirt hardcore with him. That’s what made Draco really angry and sad. He was upset and
Hermione and Ron exchange a confused look. “What? He left?”
Harry grins. "Okay, Sir."
Harry rolls his hips into Draco, opens his legs even further, allowing Draco to slip inside even deeper. They both let out a desperate cry at that.
Ron wants to continue arguing with him, but Hermione grabs Ron’s arm and stops him. “I think it’s a good idea, Harry. Get to know each other. Build a friendship. The rest will fall into place.”
“Draco. Are you really sure about this?”
Draco squeezes Harry’s hands. “Me neither.”
Naturally, he asks Draco what to do a week before everyone is supposed to leave, after they’ve just shagged their brains out.
Draco is unconscious and unable to move nor speak, so Harry does the only logical thing and picks up the limp body. He carries Draco to the bed and puts him down gently.
Draco groans. Merlin, this is getting too much. "So impatient, bet you would beg for it, wouldn't you?"
“I mean Hermione and I couldn’t believe how slow you were. It was so fucking obvious, you know, with all the eye fucking going on. I thought you’d be married by
He doesn’t say anything else, simply focuses on driving.
The moment he steps inside the party tent, he feels overwhelmed. The music is too loud, there are people everywhere, everyone is laughing. But that’s not why he feels overwhelmed.
Harry grabs his wrist before Draco can run out of the bathroom. “Please. Don’t.”
Draco turns around, reaches for the two bottles of Armortentia, and holds one out to Harry. “Cheers!”
Harry doesn’t sleep well during the first night. He keeps thinking about Draco and how the other man is sleeping in the room next to him. The raven-haired man fights the wish to get up, walk to Draco’s room, and get into his bed cuddling with him and falling asleep next to him several times. It’s exhausting.
Together, they rush towards the bathroom, both clearly not thinking straight. After two hours of drinking his mind has left any ability to form any reasonable thought.
* * *
“Good luck getting your man!”, Neville shouts after him but Draco doesn’t care.
Harry sighs. Then, he throws back the entire thing. It burns in his throat and makes him cough. “Merlin. That is
Then, his hand suddenly moves upwards to Draco head. Draco’s breath hitches in his throat and his heart stops beating. In a soft, gentle movement, Harry strokes some wet hair out of Draco’s eyes.
“I mean, if you put all of his flaws aside and focus
Draco nods. “Yeah. Please don’t take it seriously. It’s honestly meant as a joke. I don’t know. It’s stupid.”
This makes Harry moan even more. His dick is already so hard. He knows he’s not going to last much longer. “Fuck, Draco. I’m close.”
The response makes Draco’s heart flutter.
Harry’s head snaps up. “Pansy’s gang?”
“Fuck,” Harry hisses at the sensation. “Please don’t stop!”
Draco blushes. "Thank you."
“It’s really painful, isn’t it?”, Harry asks softly and steps even closer.
They spend Christmas Eve making their very own pizza. Draco has never made pizza himself before, and Harry really wanted to keep it interesting and untraditional.
“Alright, folks. Let’s head home, shall we?”, he says with a hoarse voice and it comes out miserable and sad.
“That’s weird.”
Draco starts to kiss Harry, pushes his own body against Harry’s chest, and begins to stroke him gently. He’s being much more passionate than Harry would have expected, but he’s not complaining. Draco certainly knows what he’s doing. He builds up a steady rhythm, making it harder to breathe for Harry.
Draco looks down at him, raises his eyebrow, and waits for Harry to speak up.
Harry can’t concentrate on his Professor, telling him about Ancient Wizard History. He’s not tired – he’s restless. His mind rushes to ten million different places, he scratches the wood of the table and uses his magic to get it repaired, and he bounces his leg up and down.
“Fuck, Harry. Don’t stop.”
Harry sits down next to Luna and stares at his shaking hands. Luna reaches out and grabs ahold of them. “It’ll be fine, Harry. Don’t worry.”
snogged the hell out of that stranger! How did you even see me kissing him when you were busy making out with somebody else?!”
Harry bites his lip. “I don’t know. We’ll see.”
Harry barks out a laugh. "Oh no, no, no. You've got it all wrong. He's with Seamus. He's just a really good friend."
“But you were the one who said that you didn’t find me attractive! You said that multiple times. You kept telling me how you didn’t fancy me. How it was all just sex between us. A one-time thing, a win-win situation, remember?”
Draco watches Harry confused. Didn't he just flirt with the beautiful boy in the cafeteria? Why is he now flirting with Draco?
Then, Harry gently pushes it in.
is really young.”
Draco desperately hopes that the trip comes about. He needs at least 10 students willing to participate and then he’s free to go. Otherwise, it's not worth going.
He mentions that to Draco one night. He’s still high on endorphins, sex, and love.
When Draco goes for his usual Sunday morning walk, he thinks about calling his mum. Maybe he would cook pasta with salmon later.
Harry begins to suck the soft skin at Draco’s neck. He bites it, licks over it. Then, the wizard shakes his hand free from Draco’s firm grip, wraps his arm around Draco’s waist, and pulls him impossibly closer. He reaches out for Draco’s cock and begins to stroke him.
“Bathroom!”, Harry orders.
“Ready?” he whispers and holds onto the raven-haired man’s waist. For some reason, this feels so much more intimate and serious than the many other times they’ve fucked. This almost feels like making love. Or maybe Harry has officially lost his mind and is imagining things.
He wants to grab Draco, push him against a wall, kiss him, and never, not even in a million years, let go of him.
Harry squeezes his bum and groans, his hands grabbing the sheets. It's a sinful sight. Draco leans down and presses kisses on Harry's back, starting on the top between his shoulders and making his way down south to the curve where Harry's spine meets his arse.
Draco grins. “Merlin, that’s such a muggle thing to do.”
Draco pinches the bridge of his nose in frustration. “The Veela transformation usually is a very normal, painless act.”
“Um. Yeah. I guess.”
The sight in itself could make Draco cum on the spot.
Harry’s head snaps around in surprise.
“Because I don’t want to go back to how things were. I want them to stay like this forever. I want to be with you forever.”
When he runs up to the door, he knocks on it like a crazy person. “Harry? Harry, please open the door!”
Besides, he doesn’t really want to know why the age gap is so important to Harry anyway. Thinking about it makes him feel dizzy because it's something that Draco has thought about too. He checks his watch and realizes they’re only 5 minutes away from the agreed meeting time.
* * *
“Unless you don’t want to?”, Harry asks him, suddenly feeling shy. He knew he overstepped a line. Draco doesn’t really want this.
Draco licks his lips and pulls Harry’s cheeks apart. Then, he blows a soft airflow on his delicate skin.
“Hmm?”
Harry’s stomach drops to the floor. “Veritaserum?”
Harry opens his legs even further, allowing Draco to push in all the way. Draco uses this for his advantage and thrusts into the boy.
Draco nods. He holds out his hand for Harry to shake. “Deal.”
“Harry!” Luna cries. “It won’t be the same without you.”
“What did you think of exactly?”
“Harry,” Draco suddenly mumbles. Harry freezes. “Shut the fuck up.”
Ron tilts his head. “Oh! So, it’s a guy then! Hm. This is fun. I’m pretty sure I’ll find out who it is by the end of this term.”
“I don’t want to keep you up”, Harry whispers, already feeling bad for keeping Draco from sleeping.
Harry tilts his head. “Draco, we’ve fucked so many times now. It’s important that we trust each other enough to talk about the things we like. Or don’t like. I don’t ever want to do something you don’t enjoy.”
They both breathe heavily, unable to calm down.
strong!”
Draco plays with his silver rings. “No, you’re obviously not ugly. Have you never looked in a mirror before or what?”
* * *
Blaise grins. “Truth or Dare?”
The wizard cringes at how broken his own voice sounds. He clears his throat and tries again. “No. No, he didn’t.”
He’s surprised when he feels Draco’s lips on his neck. He sucks gently at first, then he starts getting rougher. Draco’s left hand begins to cup Harry through his boxers, making Harry moan loudly. He didn’t think that Draco’s pure hand would feel like heaven. He’s never felt like this with anyone before.
“Without saying anything?” Just like that? No note? Nothing?”
Draco’s mouth opens in a silent cry, his eyes are tightly shut and the hand around Harry’s begins to squeeze tightly. “Harry, I’m -“
“You have to tell me what to do!”
it. I’m ready, Draco. I am. I’ve wanted you since the first time I saw you in that lecture. But just
“Jesus, can’t they give you a break for one second?” Hermione whispers as she sorts out her cards. They want to play a muggle game that the other wizards have never heard of.
“Malfoy!”, Harry shouts. “Are you okay?”
But then, Draco looks up and the way he stares right back at Harry takes his breath away. His grey eyes sparkle in the dim light of the club, his lips seem plush and glossy, his cheeks are rosy pink and his hair is a mess. Harry has never seen anyone more beautiful than Draco. He shouldn’t do it. But the moment Draco licks his lips, that’s when Harry surges forward. He grabs Draco’s waist and pushes him against the wall, presses his lips on top of his and begins to kiss him passionately.
Draco's heart skips a beat and he sits up straighter. "Harry, what a surprise!"
Draco seems to be just as aroused. He lets his head roll back, allowing Harry access to his neck. Harry pulls away from Draco’s lips and kisses his way down low, bites Draco’s neck, kisses the sensitive skin, and turning the blonde man into a shuddering, moaning mess.
“Oh, Potter. Stop being such a bore. Sex is so much fun. It’s natural. Come on, open up to me.”
Harry doesn’t dare to open his eyes. He might ruin the magic of the moment. What if Draco suddenly realizes what they’re doing and disappears? What if Draco will be mad at Harry for luring him into this situation? His heart beats painfully in his chest, and he wishes he could mute his anxious thoughts.
Harry’s eyes snap up and he watches Draco through the mirror. This time, neither of them break the eye contact. Harry suddenly feels hot, and it’s getting harder to breathe.
But all of that goes to waste when he sees Harry walking out of the door into the pouring rain. It’s already dark, so he can’t see his face but Draco is certain it’s Harry.
Draco stares into green eyes and gets lost for a second. Then he nods. “No problem. The rain was awful.”
Draco watches him closely for a second. His hair is even messier than this morning. “I’m gonna go eat something. And I’ll probably go back to the hotel.”
Draco pouts. He doesn’t want to accept the fact that it’s all his own fault just yet. Deep inside, he knows. He knows that this thing with Harry means more than anything has ever meant to him.
Harry’s head snaps around. He gleams at Ron. “That has nothing to do with him!”
Draco pulls Harry closer and presses kisses all over his face. "I love you, too. Thank god you're mine."
Harry shakes his head, but can’t hide his excitement. It's been way too long since he truly let go. The group begins to drink and after an hour, Harry already feels his head spin. His cheeks feel warm, his hands are slightly sticky and his face hurts from smiling so much.
“No, you don’t.”
Hermione hums. “Hm. Okay.”
Harry stares at her perplexed. “I can’t just do that.”
* * *
“Just Friends”, Harry states.
He squeezes inside, closer to the sink, and waits for Draco to follow him. He eventually does. The other man closes the door, turns on the lights, and stares at the floor.
Ron shakes his head. “No, no. That’s not what this is about.”
Draco shrugs, but his eyes don’t leave Harry’s. “I was horny. I have a free period, and I really could use some...
“Well”, Draco says. “About us, I guess?”
Harry looks around him, watches his friends and his family and his heart swells in his chest.
Draco meets Harry’s eyes in a tempting, playful dare. “Deal.”
He presses his lips together and tries to ignore the stinging pain in his chest. It doesn’t matter, he tells himself. He's not disappointed. Nor is he jealous. It’s nothing. It’s better this way.
“Once a mother, always a mother”, she simply states. “I’ll see you at your flat in an hour. Send me the list, Draco!”
Draco kisses Harry’s cheek. “I’m really sorry you had to go through all of this. I know that I wasn’t exactly nice to you back then either.”
He’s being interrupted by Dean, who shoves a shot glass in his face. “Drink up!”
Draco bites his lip. “Harry, I love my job. I really do. I can’t risk it.”
Draco squeezes him tightly and buries his nose inside Harry’s neck. “You smell so fucking good. You have no idea.”
Draco grabs the sheets, while Harry continues to move his fingers inside of him. “You. Your muscles. Your hands grabbing my ass, my arms, my legs. I imagined you kissing me, hard. I thought of you pushing inside me, painfully slow. Then, painfully rough.”
“Um, Hi.”, he says.
He presses down a kiss right there, causing Harry to scream "Fuck, Draco!"
Harry raises his eyebrows, amusement still clear in his eyes. “What makes you think I would flirt with you?”
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Harry grins. "You talked to your mum about me?"
“I suppose Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy are the last two without a partner. Alright, then. Since everyone is partnered up now, please sit with your partner and listen closely to the assignment.”
Black messy hair and piercing green eyes look through the door. "Mr Malfoy?"
Harry barks out a laugh and his eyes sparkle in amusement. “You’re a shitty liar.”
His answer shoots out of his mouth before he can think about it. “We were never just friends.”
“Fuck”, Harry shouts and holds him tightly. “Draco! Are you okay?”
The boy leaves the balcony and enters his room and Draco panics.
The guy doesn’t get it. He runs his fingers up and down Harry’s arms. He lowers his lips, and the moment he tries to kiss him, Harry loses it. He grabs his wand with one hand, the other wraps itself around the guy’s neck, and he pushes him against the wall.
"Come in", Draco shouts and looks up.
Harry grins. “That’s good to know. But what can I do to make it even better?”
He starts the engine and drives to Harry’s flat. He desperately hopes he’ll be there.
Harry presses his lips together and runs a hand through his hair.
Harry turns bright red. Luna giggles. The others whistle at him. Some even bark out a loud laugh. Oh, Merlin.
Draco only hums in response and continues. Then, the blonde man takes the showerhead again and begins to wash out the shampoo. Harry rolls his head back and gives Draco better access.
“I’m sorry for what happened at the club. If I had known that we would stop talking for a month afterward, I never would’ve let that happen.”
“Harry,” Draco sighs. “Please do something. Please!”
“It simply would be practical if we were into each other. Because then, we could help each other out. We both want to get laid but we can't as long as we're stuck in Hogwarts.”
“Harry,” Draco moans as he begins to push his hips into Harry’s. Harry swears he sees stars at the sensation. “Harry, I need you to fuck me. I need you to be inside of me. Merlin, I need all of you. Need to feel you, taste you. Fuck me, please.”
“Mr Malfoy!”
Harry shrugs. He doesn’t know why he can’t talk about Sex that openly. He dislikes it.
"Draco, stop teasing me, I need you inside me", Harry pleads as he throws his head back.
His eyes are sparkling dangerously, and he struggles to control himself, anger and adrenaline mixed with his buzzing, fuming magic running through his veins. “I said get the fu–“
“Harry, what the hell –“
Draco doesn’t answer him. Instead, he collects all the necessary information for his planned trip. He fills out some papers from his university in order to get permission for his field trip and puts them in an envelope ready to send them away later.
“Are you insane? That is actually incredible. You know how much I struggle with my hair. Always have. I have no clue what to do with it.”
“Okay”, Harry whispers and presses a kiss down onto Draco’s shoulder.
Harry clearly isn’t thinking straight. Draco being naked and thirsty for a cock isn’t helping either. His Veela is probably starting to form and puts Harry in a lovesick, horny trance or something.
was uptight!”
Draco moans. "Fuck, Harry."
Harry nods. “Yeah. I don’t know what I had expected. Definitely not this.”
“Draco. Come on.”
“Oh my god”, Draco cries. “Please give it to me.”
“How come that you visit my lectures then?”
“What are you doing here, all by yourself?”
grade me.”
Draco feels sick to his stomach. He feels absolutely horrible. He tries to eat some of his pasta because he knows he needs to eat at least something but he really can't get anything down his throat anymore.
Draco lets out a desperate sob and slams a hand down onto the mattress. “Harry!”
She grins. “I came prepared.”
A few more pushes and then, Harry sees stars. He has never come this hard in his entire life.
Draco eventually sighs. “What a shame. We could really help each other out. If only we would find each other attractive.”
Draco giggles and kisses Harry's cheek. "Yes. I'm your boyfriend."
Harry just shrugs his shoulders. “I’d like to see you more often.”
“You’ve attended the lecture about Ancient Greek last semester and wrote the best essay hands down. Of course, I remember.”
“Did you just say ‘Both of you’?”
Draco shakes his head. “I’d rather not. I trust myself most when it comes to potions.”
“Harry!” Draco moans and grabs Harry’s hand that is resting on his thigh. “Touch me; I need you so much closer.”
Draco shakes his head. “No, no. Don’t be. I’m just really excited right now.”
Harry sighs and rubs a hand over his face. “I don’t know. I didn’t force myself to fuck you.”
Draco leans back, his grey eyes turning soft and gentle, and hums. “Well. First of all, you need to eat. You look like shit.”
“I haven’t seen you this excited in a long time,” Hermione notices a couple of days later at lunch. She watches Harry eat enthusiastically as his legs bounce up and down.
“Mortified?”
Harry only nods, eyes looking heavy and tired.
“Potter shut the hell up. I don’t need butterflies and roses. Just give it to me already. You should know that by now. Rough and hard, remember?”
The blonde man lets his hands roam all over Harry’s body. He tucks at his shirt and manages to pull it over Harry’s head. Then, they break the kiss apart and stumble out of the rest of their clothes. Harry giggles when he almost trips over. “Whoops.”
Ah, the perks of being The Golden Boy, as Draco always puts it. “May I excuse myself to go to the hospital wing? I think I’ve distorted a muscle during Quidditch training. It really hurts.”
And Draco does. They sit together for an hour, Draco explaining to him what the solution looks like. And for the first time, Harry actually gets it. He understands the whole procedure. He’s never understood anything in potions, but Draco makes it seem so manageable and easy.
Neville shrugs. “Yeah, I agree. I mean we’re just talking about looks, and Draco does check all the boxes. Besides, I think he's really changed a lot since the war.”
They head downstairs together, that’s when Harry starts to get nervous. He has a small present prepared for Draco in the kitchen, but now he starts to wonder whether it was actually a good idea. He doesn’t know how to act around Draco anymore – whether it’s too much or not enough or just right.
“Please don’t remove your hands”, Draco cries. “Please!”
Draco tilts his head, and he finally seems to relax a little. “You’re in love with me?”
“Okay" Draco answers "I’m going to remove my fingers now”
Only a couple hours later, he jumps up. He doesn’t know what the dream was about, but he’s sweaty, his heart is beating as if he had run a marathon, his breathing is ragged, and he doesn’t know where he is. The nightmares still come and go once in a while. Even if it had gotten better, the past always tends to hunt him.
Harry’s head spins, and he feels lightheaded. Fuck. This must be the happiest day of his life. He feels so bubbly and excited and happy, he can’t form one proper sentence. And he definitely doesn't want to talk now. Instead of talking, he surges forward. He grabs Draco’s face with both of his hands and presses his lips on top of his. Harry finally feels complete again. God, he loves Draco. So much. He sighs into the kiss.
Harry turns around and looks at Draco now. “What do you mean?”
Draco smiles. "No problem. It was nice working alongside you."
“Oh. Sorry”, Harry replies and rips his eyes away from him. He gets up and begins to wander through the classroom, trying to keep himself busy, so he won’t stare at Malfoy again. Harry doesn’t really know what to do with himself, so the raven-haired man starts to stretch his sore muscles. Schoolwork has been tough and he can feel the tension and the pain in his muscles every single day. Then, he turns around, and his eyes immediately find Draco’s. Draco looks away. He almost seems as if he got caught doing something forbidden.
Draco nods. “I see.”
“Quit the sweet-talk and fuck me like the man that you are!”
Draco clears his throat again. God, this is awkward. “Well. I needed some time to realise what I want. Who I want.”
“Feels nice”, he states. His thoughts go blank.
Harry is as hard as Draco must be by now. He rubs soft circles onto Draco’s arse cheeks, occasionally squeezing them and running his nails over the soft skin.
Harry frowns. “Snufflings?”
“But you didn’t?”
When the house-elves are finished, they place the most beautiful cake in front of Harry and Draco. Harry laughs at Draco’s expression.
Draco squeezes his eyes shut. His cock is so hard that it's almost painful. Hearing Harry begging for it does sinful things to him.
Neville nods, but he doesn’t seem convinced.
Draco contemplates. All of the other students are busy talking or reading or sleeping. They wouldn’t even notice Harry, a student, was sitting next to him. Besides, they probably wouldn't give a shit anyway.
Harry shrugs again. “I don’t know. Couldn’t really tell.”
That makes Draco grin. He nods, runs a hand through his messy sex-hair, and turns around. “Good. Then I’ll see you on Friday next week. Ten pm.”
“Hm", Draco nods. "But make sure the others don't see you, yeah?"
* * *
“Okay?”, Harry whispers, kisses Draco’s thigh, and watches Draco through worried eyes. The last thing he wants to do is hurt Draco or make him feel uncomfortable.
All he can think of is the way Draco had kissed him back. The way Draco had moaned Harry’s name. The way he had confessed his love to him. Harry’s brain feels fuzzy. He needs to distract himself.
Draco nods. He bites Harry’s lip and pulls him even closer. “You make me lose my mind, Harry.” They stroke each other in the same rhythm; their dicks are sliding against each other every so often. Harry is close to passing out.
“I don’t know”, Draco answers truthfully. “I might do one soon. I haven't really thought about it."
Draco only hums in agreement, kissing Harry’s chest instead. He can feel Draco’s steady heartbeat, feels every part of Draco’s skin. He swallows the moment and never wants it to stop. He can’t believe he’s lying here next to Draco Malfoy after they’ve shagged their brains out. But Harry wouldn’t want to change a single thing.
“Oh my god”, Harry groans and grabs the sheets.
“The only reason you came along was Draco. The moment you stepped into the club, all you cared about was Draco. You almost burst out into tears when you saw him kissing somebody else and he nearly lost his shit when he saw you kissing that random dude.”
Draco sits down at the round table in the kitchen and watches Harry get out some tomatoes, pasta, zucchini, cheese, and lentils. Then, Harry begins to cook Spaghetti Bolognese.
But Draco’s hot skin feels too good. Draco’s moans sound like heaven and Harry’s brain shuts off. He grabs Draco’s arse and massages it gently.
Harry sighs. He can’t imagine how it must feel to be inside of Draco. He pulls out his fingers.
Draco smiles and nods. "Yes, that's what I'm here for. Go on, tell me about your ideas."
And he’s so utterly fucked. How could this happen? Harry is a student, for Christ’s sake. Not a pizza delivery boy or a hairdresser at his favourite salon.
Harry obliges and steps into the bathtub as well, sinking against Draco's chest.
“That actually sounds insane, Harry. I can’t imagine it being relaxing or amusing at all.”
Harry nearly gets a heart attack and jumps up. His heart is racing, and the panic only slowly fades away.
“I’d rather spend time with you.”
The blonde man grabs the two bottles and hands one to Harry. This is it, Harry thinks. There’s no going back now. He doesn’t know whether he should be scared or excited about what’s to come.
“He was very straight forward,” Draco eventually states, watching Harry’s reaction curiously.
"Hmm", Harry only hums and leans back against the seat his eyes fixated on Draco.
Draco doesn’t look up, he only hums.
Harry’s head spins. He watches Neville get up and leave the bedroom to use the restroom. But his thoughts are still racing through his mind.
Draco nods.
“Huh,” Draco notices. “How did you get out of that? Oh, wait. Don’t. I already know the answer.”
fucking needed this.”
Harry looks at him confused for two seconds. Then, his eyes light up when he recognizes Draco. “Yes!”
Draco feels very hesitant at first, feeling scared that Harry's friends won't like him anymore after all the drama between them. But Harry promises him that they're not unforgiving and that they will love him.
Draco shrugs his shoulders and grins. “What can I say?”
“Fuck!”, he screams as he comes inside Draco, his fingers sinking into Draco’s delicate skin. He feels dizzy and breathless and so, so good.
Draco walks up to the door but stops himself before leaving. He turns around and watches Harry with an unreadable expression.
“Wait a sec,” Neville shouts. He hears some clattering, and then, Neville opens the door. His face is red and covered in mud.
Harry presses his lips together. “I know. But it’s not like I selflessly sacrificed myself to help out my former archenemy.”
“Um.”
“Harry”, Draco cries.
Harry,” Draco cries out.
Draco ignores him. “I need him, Neville. I’m going crazy without him.”
“He behaved like that because you were flirting with that guy, Harry. Do I need to spell it out for you?”
“Fuck,” Harry pants. His back is arching. He feels the need to grab something to keep him distracted. There’s nothing to hold. Therefore, he grabs Draco’s bicep and claws his fingers into his delicate skin. “Draco. Please, do something.
Neville’s face softens. “I know, Dray. I know. I’ve noticed.”
They sit in silence, both staring outside and watching the ocean. It’s nice weather today. The sun is shining, which makes it seem like summer, even though it’s probably freezing cold outside.
The stranger nods. “Ah. What a shame. I thought I could get you alone.”
Harry tilts his head. Yeah, Blaise probably is attractive. Harry has never really paid attention to him, though. He seems too arrogant and superficial.
"Mr Potter!"
* * *
It's Thursday and Draco is spending the two free hours that he has in-between his lectures in his office grading some essays.
Draco thinks about Neville's words for three days before he eventually decides that maybe he is a drama queen. Maybe this whole situation isn't even as bad as Draco makes it out to be. Maybe the boy is simply interested in history and is intrigued by Draco's knowledge and intellect.
Harry tilts his head in confusion and waits for Draco to continue.
Harry nods. “Yes.”
Draco has to sit down and calm his racing heart for a moment.
Harry sighs. “Malfoy, I really don-“
The boy simply nods and begins to roll his hips up into Draco’s. “Please, move.”
Draco laughs. Harry tilts his head in surprise. It’s a beautiful sound, and it makes something inside of Harry's tingle. He’s never really heard Malfoy laugh before, he notices.
Draco arches his back, his mouth falls open, his eyes roll back and Draco’s entire body tenses. He doesn’t say anything, he only breathes heavily. Tears stream down his face.
“Merlin, Potter”, Draco groans. “We fucked so many times, do I really need to tell you again? Fuck me, use me, be rough, I don’t give a fuck. Do something, please!”
Harry nods in relief. “Yeah, I’d love that.”
Harry frowns, the words sputter out of his mouth before he can even stop himself. “That is absolutely stupid. I don’t wanna do that! Why would you choose that for me?”
Harry opens his eyes, looking tired and worn out, but also very happy. "Hmm. Very."
“I know”, Harry says and grips his own hard, leaking cock. “But I want to.”
“Hello, stranger.”
“I need you to fill me up, need your cock inside my arse. Please, Harry, it hurts so much.”
“Are you going home for Halloween as well?”
“But if you could hook up with anyone from our year, who would that be?”, Seamus asks.
“Oh God,” Harry moans. “Fuck, I missed this so much. Merlin.”
It’s passionate, hot, and incredibly sexy. Harry doesn’t ever want to stop. His fingers are tingling when he touches Draco. His entire body feels as if it’s on fire. Draco kisses him back and begins to roll his hips.
“Do you care about me?”, Harry’s eyes fill with tears. "At all?"
“You look like a child on Christmas Eve.”
Harry sits on the floor, next to the huge chimney in the Room of Requirement, and warms his feet. He watches Draco, who’s been reading a book for the past forty minutes.
Of course, one student stays. At this point, Draco is so used to having Harry around after and before lectures it doesn’t even make him that nervous anymore.
Harry nods and takes a drag from his cigarette.
“Don’t stress yourself, I can go grocery shopping. Send me the list of things you need and I’ll buy them for you.”
But Dean doesn’t give in. He basically shoves the drink down Harry’s throat. Harry coughs. “These are the rules. One-Shot of Veritaserum.”
Draco is about to lose his mind. It’s been three fucking weeks since Harry confessed his love to him. Three weeks since he’s been close to Harry. Since he’s touched Harry.
They simply don’t have that kind of relationship where they carry one another to the hospital when in need. They haven’t even had a proper, normal conversation in all these years they’ve known each other. The past lesson filled with awkward accidental touching just proved that.
“Well, I wasn’t. I will be after this. Or not, I don’t freaking know. God, it’s too hot in here. I can’t think straight. My skin is burning”, Draco cries and actual tears are rolling down his cheeks.
“Are you coming with me?” Draco suddenly asks, and Harry turns around in surprise.
He doesn’t have to search. The moment he looks up and faces the students, his eyes land on Harry in the third row, right up front. Draco stares at him surprised for a minute.
Harry watches it with curiosity. “Um. Do I want to know what this is?”
The next few days at the Burrow sucks. Not because he doesn’t enjoy spending time with his best friends and family.
Harry rolls his eyes at him. "You tell me."
Draco presses his lips together to hide his smile. Neville would probably roll his eyes at Draco if he were here.
“Harry!”
After unpacking their luggage, they walk downstairs to make some dinner.
“Okay”, Harry tries to distract himself. Don’t look at him! Do not look at him! “Let me just do that real quick.”
Harry frowns. “What?”
“Draco?”, he shouts. No answer. He runs to the kitchen, checking the room first. No Draco. Then, he checks the living room – empty. Fuck.
He runs his hands through the younger man's hair and grabs it tightly, causing Harry to moan. "It doesn't feel wrong, does it?"
Harry almost runs outside, longing for fresh air. He can feel the energy buzzing through him. He’s got it under control, usually. But sometimes, his buzzing magic and adrenaline turn into bursts of anger and aggression. On his way outside, he tries to avoid as many people as possible, ignoring a few calls here and there. Being back in school really irritates him so much more than he had thought. He had fought Voldemort for so long and had not cared about school since their fifth year. And now he has to focus and study and actually concentrate plus having all eyes on him. He’s not used to that anymore.
Draco’s mouth drops and he steps closer to the kitchen. “You –“
“Harry,” Draco shouts and arches his back. “
There’s a tiny blush on Draco’s cheeks, but it might just be the cold air. “I heard you guys talk. I didn’t know you were bisexual. I wasn't eavesdropping or anything. But for a very short moment, I thought you’d consider getting with him, so I didn’t want to interfere right away, and you know – I didn’t want to be a cock block so I waited.”
Then, Harry removes his mouth and conjures some lube into his hands. Slowly, he enters one finger into Draco’s tight hole.
“So, I can send you a letter anytime I want? Or I can ‘call’ you and talk to you through this?”
“Why?”, Draco asks.
“Yeah, I’m doing it the muggle way. With a knife and a cutting board.” Harry bites back a laugh at Draco’s fascinated expression. He looks as if he’s never seen a knife and a zucchini before.
Draco frowns. "Thanks, mum."
“Can I give you my number? Maybe we can stay in touch and meet up sometime.”
Draco smiles, and it looks so genuine and sweet. His eyes light up, and they shimmer, his dimples are showing, and his cheeks turn even pinker. Harry thinks he’s slowly becoming obsessed with seeing Draco happy at this point. He doesn’t want to think about that. He doesn’t want to think about how utterly fucked he really is.
“Ah,” Draco says without looking up. “You’re finally here. Did my little mouse find you then?”
“I feel like shit.”
Draco winks at him. He
Harry wishes he could just tell Neville about the Armortentia. That’s the only reason why Draco even started enjoying the time spent with Harry. But Neville would probably send him to a mental hospital right away for agreeing to something so stupid and dangerous.
“What do you mean? Neville?”
Draco only shakes his head and squeezes him even tighter.
She smiles and looks around the room. “Did you know that Snufflings can jump up twenty feet into the sky?”
Draco ignores Harry’s surprised face and skids closer. He can smell Draco even better from here, and it’s making his head spin. God, Draco does smell fantastic. He grabs Harry’s book and his parchment paper and reads the exercise. “Ah. That’s easy. Let me explain it to you.”
He can tell through the phone that his mum is rolling her eyes at him.
Harry puts in a second finger and works Draco open slowly. When he thinks Draco can take it, he adds a third finger. Judging by Draco’s moans, Draco is ready.
Draco wouldn’t say his love life was nonexistent. He simply put his heart and soul into his studies in order to become a professor of history at the age of 30.
Then, he stares at it, unsure what to do with it. “I’m sorry, Harry. The lemon cake was easy to understand. But what exactly is this?”
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Harry feels a painful sting inside his chest. “We wasted so many years.”
He hopes it won’t be too awkward with Harry ignoring him and being so distant but after all, the ride is only half an hour so hopefully, it won’t be too bad.
Harry shakes his head. That can’t be true! Neville must’ve gotten something twisted. “I – Draco isn’t the kind of guy to get jealous. He definitely wasn’t – that can’t be. He isn’t into me. Not like that.”
“I said, lay down. No more questions.”
When they finally break apart, Draco grins. “Merlin, took us long enough to figure that out, didn’t it?”
Harry sighs. “Okay, okay. I guess you’re right. But I can always pretend, can I?”
Harry shrugs, but there’s still a smile on his face. “Okay. I’ll try.”
After one hour and a half, there's a break. Some students buy drinks, the others go out to have a smoke, some stay in the auditorium.
He sits down on the bleachers, takes a deep breath, and stares into the distance.
Draco wants to do this forever. He wants to fuck Harry every single day, wants to clean him up after, wants to cook him a nice dinner and cuddle with him while they're watching Netflix. Draco wants to kiss him, wants to take care of him, touch him and make him feel good. The realisation hits him hard.
Harry barks out a loud laugh, feeling a bubbly excitement in his chest. “Yeah. They do have their moments.”
“You look good”, is all the blonde man manages to say. “Really, really good.”
Harry sighs. He shouldn’t say anything else. He should shut his stupid mouth. He will absolutely regret this once he’s sober. “Yes. Really. I don’t care about anybody else.”
“Um.”
"Okay", Draco whispers and stretches his head, giving Harry better access to his neck. "I am listening."
"Of course it's not just about sex", Harry answers for Draco just as the waiter puts down their glasses of wine.
"Have I woken you up? Are you that uninterested in my class, Mr Potter?"
“Fuck, you make me so happy, you have no idea,” Draco sighs and grabs Harry’s face with both of his hands. He presses his lips on top of Harry’s and kisses him fiercely. Harry feels like he’s falling, and it worries him just a little.
“Yeah”, Harry agrees. “Sure. Let’s do that.”
The rest of the day, Harry stays away from him. Draco stares at the boy every few seconds but doesn’t get a response from him at all. Is he ignoring Draco? Is he simply tired? Is he not feeling well? It drives Draco nuts.
"Why don't you sleep a little? We still have a lot of time on the train."
“Aren’t you horny?”
Draco's eyes open wide and with one finger, he guides Harry's head to look at him. "Are you serious?"
Neville looks at Harry with hopeful eyes. “Oh. Are you finally going to talk about that mysterious boy? We’ve all been dying for you to finally open up!”
“Please tell me if anything’s hurting you,” Harry whispers. He could never forgive himself.
The students giggle. He can see Harry smiling softly at him in the dark and Draco clears his throat.
He walks to the Quidditch field, not really having a destination planned in his head. He simply enjoys the cold, fresh air and the quiet surrounding him.
Harry reaches over and turns on the light. Then, he gets up and does some stretches. He hasn’t worked out in almost a week and his muscles are beginning to feel sore. Maybe a little stretching will help him relax and then he might actually fall asleep.
He watches Harry get out of the car and waits until the boy opens the door. Then, Harry turns around one more time and waves at him.
Within the next minutes, 30 students fill the lecture hall and sit down in the front row watching Draco excitedly.
Neville raises an eyebrow, clearly judging him.
Draco raises his eyebrows in surprise. “Excuse me?”
“Malfoy”, Harry squeaks. He stares up at the man and tries to find his composure.
“You’re the Golden Boy. You’re famous. You’re Little Miss Sunshine. Everybody loves you. And you’re
“Okay,” is all that Harry brings out. He feels nervous all of a sudden, but in the right way. His stomach is fluttering in anticipation.
Draco nods but presses his lips on top of Harry’s. He begins to kiss him softly. Harry can’t get enough of it. They continue to kiss, Draco still on top of Harry, who slowly starts to stroke Draco’s hips, legs, waist, and back with his hands. Draco has the softest skin he’s ever felt in his life.
“Ready?” Draco asks as he hands him the little bottle.
Draco’s blush deepens. “Um. Yeah. A joke. As I said. I’m not even sure if it’ll work.”
Neville rolls his eyes. “Keep telling yourself that, honey. You're absolutely in love with that boy.”
Harry doesn’t understand anything. When Draco licks his lips, Harry stares at them for a second too long. “The kind where people are scared of you. ‘Oh, shit. He was a death eater, don’t go near him. He’s dangerous!’ The bad kind of famous.”
“Because”, Seamus shouts. “I wanna know. Who’s the most attractive guy in our year? Or girl? What do you think, Harry?”
Draco shakes his head. “Well. Thank Merlin that you’re the Golden Boy, huh? The Boy Who Lived. The boy who saved the wizarding world. People literally see stars when they look at you. Must be nice.”
Harry shakes his head. “Merlin, please no. I’m too old for that now.”
“What the hell,” Draco pants, as if he’d run a marathon. “What was that? Merlin, I’ve
Harry barks out a laugh and greets them all. “This is my friend, Draco Malfoy.”
The room looks very cozy. There’s a stack on the left, a desk with books, a vast, soft carpet, candles, and two big sofas. Harry smiles. Yeah, here he could relax for a little bit.
Draco huffs and begins to take off his robes. “Because it’s none of your business, Merlin. This is just perfect, being stuck with Harry Potter during this.”
Harry simply nods and grabs Draco's hand. He leads them upstairs to Draco's bedroom, Draco's nerves building up inside of him more and more every second.
Harry licks his lips. This conversation is making his head spin, and he doesn’t know what to say. “Yeah, anyway. Whatever.”
Fuck, what is he supposed to say? He takes a deep breath. “How are you?”
Someone (probably Molly) quickly shoves a glass of champagne in his and Draco’s free hands.
Draco begins to massage Harry’s shoulder, trying to calm him down. “Let go of him.”
Draco breathes out in relief when he’s finally out of the close proximity. He runs a hand through his hair, straightens his pale blue button-up shirt and sits back down. Merlin.
With that, Draco walks out of the room and leaves Harry to himself.
* * *
“Us getting along for once in our lives. Joking, talking. It's nice. I like that.”
“Draco, I think we shou–“
company.”
A lot, Harry thinks. He’s starting to enjoy talking to Malfoy, even if it makes him feel uneasy most of the time. He still enjoys it. He doesn’t want to destroy this tiny little development with Malfoy. But at the same time, he’s really horny, has been for months. And this could actually help him relax and make him feel good.
Eventually, Draco begins to yawn.
Harry leads them to the table where Ron, Hermione, Dean, Seamus and Luna already sit. Draco has seen pictures and has heard stories about each and every one of them.
"Draco", Harry sighs "I need you"
“Dare,” Harry spits out right away. He’s definitely not going to choose Truth when Draco sits a few feet away from him.
“It’s not drugs, but anyway. The guy is not into that. He’s not the type of person to go on dates.”
"Tell me if it's too much and I'll stop", Draco grits out, slamming into Harry and leaving bruises all over Harry's lower back.
He drips it onto Harry's back, on his arms and his arse.
Draco smiles. "What exam do you have to take?"
The moment he looks around if anyone saw that embarrassing encounter, he catches a glimpse of Malfoy bickering and giggling. Harry can’t stop the smirk on his face the moment their eyes meet.
Draco nods but still trembles. “Yeah. I’m aware of that. That was a shit idea.”
Draco takes a deep breath and presses send.
"Anyway", Harry says and sits down on the grey couch in Draco's office. "I have to write an assignment and I feel really lost. I was hoping you could help me?"
Draco now does look up. He stares right back at Harry, trying to figure out where this is going. “Thirty-one. Why?”
But Harry doesn’t stop. He continues hitting that spot, pushing Draco over the edge. Moments later, Harry follows him and comes himself with a loud grunt.
“You basically just described me”, Harry states in confusion.
Draco puts down a tiny blue lunch box in front of him. Harry stares at it in absolute confusion.
“Draco –“
In a swift motion, he throws the boxers away and then reaches for some oil standing on the bedside table.
Harry feels reassured. Maybe this does mean something. He begins stroking Draco’s back gently, moving his hands lower and lower.
, Potter. You really do not have to live abstinently.”
When he wakes up after a very short night, he stumbles into the bathroom and jumps into the shower. Then, he grabs his jeans and a hoodie, gets dressed, and heads downstairs. He can already smell bacon and eggs coming from the kitchen. Harry smiles when he steps closer and watches Draco cook.
Harry pouts. “Not really.”
Draco frowns. He feels this weird feeling inside his stomach. It's not quite anxiety - it's nervousness, guilt, fear, a very bad feeling he can't describe. Before he can respond, Harry has left the room and closed the door.
Draco is still mesmerised. He nods and doesn’t know what else to say. Now that he knows what the boy’s voice sounds like he’ll never be able to sleep.
“Oh, yes. Yes, yes. Of course, Mr. Potter. You may, please.”
He wishes he could wrap his arms around Draco right now and tell him how much he loves him. How much he wants to be with him. How badly he wants to kiss him and fall asleep next to him for the rest of his life. How much he regrets the past two months of ignoring each other and not admitting his feelings sooner. He could’ve spent the past months kissing Draco every single day! But he as a fool and was too scared, to be honest with himself. He wants to tell Draco all of this. But now he’s gone.
His friends wait and give Harry some time to collect his thoughts. “It was wonderful. Really. We got along so well. Everything was perfect. And then, I snapped and I kissed him and we had sex.”
“Spending time with someone who actually makes me feel good about myself.”
Harry presses kisses all over Draco’s back, feeling absolutely exhausted. His muscles hurt, his heartbeats in his chest quickly, and he feels himself drifting into the most peaceful sleep in months.
“Well, excuse me”, he jokes. “Did you really think I’d rent a hovel?”
Harry groans. He hates that game. “Nah, thanks. I’m out.”
“One is the shampoo. It’s supposed to clean your scalp without making it dry or frizzy. The other is a conditioner. This smoothes the hair and makes it soft.”
Harry licks his lips and kneads his hands. “Um. I’ve booked a little house near the beach and I’m going to spend Christmas with Draco there.”
They work in silence, the tension between them growing to an unbearable extent.
“Or”, Draco grins and changes his voice into a mocking tone. “are you excited for Boxing Day tomorrow?”
Draco grins. “Same. Anyway. May I offer you some firewhiskey?” Draco tilts his chin and points to the bottle of firewhiskey on the table.
Draco shrugs. “What are
Draco smiles and kisses him back. “I know. I feel the same way.”
Harry forces himself to calm down as he walks down the stairs. He immediately smiles when his eyes land on Draco, who’s waiting for him in the Entrance Hall with his luggage.
. How was he ever able to live without this wonderful man? He’s never noticed how well they actually work together. They’re made for each other. Draco is now lying on his stomach, waiting impatiently for Harry to make the next move.
Draco watches him again. “I know what you mean. But I still prefer it this way.” His shoulders tense up and he almost seems shy now. “We talk now. That’s very positive to me.”
watching you with that guy,” Draco mumbles against Harry’s lips as he begins to kiss him passionately. “It drove me insane. I wanted to grab you, kiss you, make him understand that you’re not his.”
Harry presses his lips together, not wanting to interrupt Draco’s flow. His eyes sparkle and he seems so excited. Harry doesn’t want to ruin that right now. He continues to watch Draco through the mirror, feeling his heart clench inside his chest.
Harry tilts his head. "Did anything happen?"
Harry's face now breaks into a small smile. "And?"
Draco nods and blows out some smoke. “Yeah. Same.”
Draco grins and sits down next to him. “Don’t worry, it’ll be brilliant. You know, I’m really good at potions.”
“First, the thing about the former archenemy. So everything’s good between us now, right?”
Harry smiles. “You can admit anything around me, you know? I’ll never judge you.”
“Stop staring, you creep.”
Draco’s heart skips a beat.
Harry doesn’t know what to do. He doesn’t want to overstep the lines. During the summer he’s had plenty of wild shags, both female and male, sometimes both at once, but nothing felt as intimate and hot as this. It’s Draco Malfoy, after all. Not just anyone.
“Sometimes, I feel as if the high doesn’t really ebb off.”
Harry shakes his head and rubs his eyes. “No.”
Turning his head, he searches for Malfoy and walks further into the large bathroom, only to be met with a shirtless Draco pouring some oils into the huge bathtub filled with bubbles.
He turns around and orders his Chai Latte. After paying the lady, he turns back to Harry.
Harry smiles and opens his arms for Draco. The blonde man happily cuddles into Harry’s body, wrapping his arms around his torso and resting his head on Harry’s chest. Harry begins to stroke Draco’s messy hair.
Silence.
Neville looks unimpressed. “Ah. You finally figured that out after what? Four months?”
Hermione watches him for a moment. She’s probably considering whether she should say something or if she should give Harry some space.  Then, she simply shrugs, collects her books, and leaves the classroom without looking back at Harry. He's never felt more appreciative for his best friend.
“Shit,” Harry mumbles, takes a bite of the banana and rushes to the door. The boys are all laughing at him. He knows how this looks like. As if he actually cares about this dick appointment. As if he has a genuine crush. But he doesn’t! Let the boys think about what they want. Harry knows it best anyway. He doesn’t like Draco. He doesn’t want anything from him but the sex.
Harry decides not to argue with him about whose fault it is. That’s a dangerous topic to discuss and Harry doesn’t want to ruin the conversation. “You shouldn’t have to go through that.”
But it drives Draco absolutely fucking nuts. He needs to see Harry. He needs to talk to him, needs to feel him, needs to see his smile, needs to wrap his arms around him.
“Psst”, Harry shushes him.
One hand keeps him steady, pushing down onto Draco’s back, the other is held tightly by Draco.
“Am I included in ‘everyone’?”, Draco asks carefully.
Harry sighs in relief and smiles. “Did you always know what you wanted to do?”
Draco continues to eat. “I’ve never really experienced anything like this before, you know?”
“Oh, no. I’m not talking about the food. I meant
After packing all of his stuff, he immediately apparates to the Burrow. He doesn’t even care about anything else. The moment Ron sees Harry walk through the door, he drops his cup of tea, shouts “Hermione! Emergency!” and grabs Harry's arm. Ron pulls Harry with him and rushes to his bedroom, Hermione following him immediately.
And then, after his lecture, Harry walks up to him and chats to him about the lecture, about the things Draco explained, what Harry found most interesting, what Harry didn't understand.
He needs Harry. The realisation hits him hard after the fourth week without him. Draco finishes his lecture and stares into the lecture hall, eyes searching for Harry but he’s nowhere to be seen. He feels empty and lost and wants to cry.
Draco shakes his head, his eyes glistening. “I really don’t care. I’m over the moon. You’re the best! Thank you.”
Draco seems to think about the same thing, but he doesn’t seem to have an answer.
Draco quickly stares at his book, avoiding Harry’s gaze. Harry knows him well enough to know that he’s blushing. “I don’t know, Harry. Won’t they be disappointed if you don’t spend Christmas with them?”
When Harry wakes up the next morning, he feels pleasantly warm. He slowly starts to notice his surroundings and feels arms wrapped around his waist and a leg thrown over his. He smells Draco and smiles. He missed waking up next to him so much.
Harry clears his throat and returns to his book he’s pretending to read. “Oh. Really.”
When Draco finally opens his eyes, it’s almost as if the whole world stops. There’s nothing else, just these beautiful, grey eyes staring back at him. Harry never wants this feeling to end. He wants to drown in it with Draco. He can’t help the burning desire for Draco that is raging rough his body. The most beautiful man Harry’s ever seen is standing right in front of him. Harry must be the luckiest man in the world.
“Harry, you have no idea how fucking good this feels. Please, fuck me harder. Touch me everywhere. I need you so much; please don’t stop.”
After having another round of shots, they all apparate to London, but Harry doesn’t share his friends’ excitement. He feels his nerves build up inside of him. He desperately wants to see Malfoy, but he also doesn’t know what will happen, if Draco actually happens to be at the club. Will they make out? Or go even further? He doubts that Draco casually will carry two bottles of Armortentia with him. Maybe Draco will say “Hello Harry, nice to see you!” and turn around and dance with another bloke. They’re not dating. They’re not a thing. They haven't really spent any time together without the love potion clouding their brains. What if Draco is annoyed to see Harry at the club and snarls at him? Draco could totally do that because –
“It’s another muggle thing. Every single muggle has one of those. Honestly, if you don’t have a phone at this point you’re considered old-fashioned, weird, or an alternative hipster. Everybody has a phone. Everybody!”
* * *
“Um. It’s basically a book? Shit, I’m horrible at explaining, I’m really sorry.”
One hand keeps him steady, pushing down onto Draco’s back. The other is held tightly by Draco.
Hermione’s jaw drops to the floor. “No way!”
“Draco, don’t stop, don’t stop, I need you, need your cock, fill me up, come for me, I need to feel your cum inside of me, please.”
“Did something happen?”
“I love lemon cake, but I’ve never really had one for myself. Mother is a horrible cook and she’s even worse at baking. She lets our house-elves do all the work. I cringe every time, trust me. I wish she didn’t need to rely on them so much.”
"Morning", Draco mumbles.
He sighs, rubs his eyes in an attempt to wake up and gets out of his chair. His office looks like a mess. Technically, any normal person would still consider it very tidy but to Draco, it is a total mess. He's a tidy person and he needs everything to be clean and organized.
"Finally, man", Dean says and embraces Draco in a hug. "Harry hasn't shut up about you since his first lecture like six months ago or something. I was getting tired of his thirsting."
„I mean, it’s just a few words from me to the students, nothing special“, Draco quickly adds when he sees the smug smile on Harry’s face.
Stop, Harry thinks. You don’t really want this. He doesn’t really want this.
Draco doesn’t look at him but rummages about inside his bag. “And why is that?”
So, Harry does. He pushes into Draco, again and again. Draco meets every thrust, moaning, and crying at the same time. They find a perfect, steady rhythm, both adjusting to each other’s movements perfectly.
Draco simply stares at Harry, the words echoing in his brain. Then he realizes that he's supposed to order.
Harry closes his eyes, pulls his legs close to his chest, and lets Draco do all the work. Draco gives Harry the showerhead back, opens the little shampoo bottle carefully, and lets some of the potion drop over Harry’s head. Then, he begins to massage Harry’s scalp. Harry purrs.
“Yeah. Everything’s different. I’m glad, though. Glad that it’s all different.”
Harry raises his eyebrows in surprise. “People actually say that about you?”
They stay quiet for a while and sit down on a bench eventually.
Draco leans back and watches Harry through interested eyes. “Nice.”
Then, Harry starts walking towards the little house. He opens the red door and walks inside, Draco following him.
“Smells really good”, Harry notices.
Harry shrugs. “I don’t know. I’m just in a good mood.”
Draco rolls over and smiles brightly at Harry. His eyes sparkle, his cheeks are rosy, and his dimples are showing. Harry’s heart flutters at the sight of that, and he reaches out for Draco, presses his lips on top of his, and pulls him into a tight hug.
“Harry, I’m sorry for losing contr–“
Harry doesn't comment on that.
Draco grins and sits up. “Now it finally gets interesting. Tell me more, Potter.”
Draco physically needs to see Harry. He feels like he’s suffocating without him, like a starving man desperate for food.
Draco takes the showerhead from Harry’s hands. His voice sounds rough and quiet. “You haven’t used enough water. You need to go much slower.”
“Your hair is really soft”, Harry whispers and his eyes flicker down to Draco’s lips.
He falls down on his seat with a sigh, getting his book out and checking the train for all the students one more time. He nods proudly when he counts all thirty.
Draco holds his breath and watches Harry timidly.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Draco gathers his things, grabs his cloak and runs out of the Dungeon's as if he's being followed by a dangerous animal.
Neville raises his eyebrow. “So, you only ever hung out to have sex?”
Draco sighs. “It doesn’t have to be weird. Right? We’re both different now. I’m not saying we should be friends. But let’s just not make it weird.”
Harry nods. “See you on Tuesday?”
“Urgh. It’s a muggle thing. Doesn’t matter right now. Why would you kiss someone just because some random guy started flirting with me? I didn’t even care about him, I was looking for you!”
Once they’re outside, Harry nuzzles closer to Draco. It’s drizzling and cold and Draco doesn’t mind being this close to Harry at all.
Draco grabs a chair and forces Harry to sit down in front of the mirror. Harry can now see all of Draco. His blushed cheeks, his blonde curls, his grey eyes that seem vivid in the dim bathroom light. Draco looks so freaking beautiful. Harry bites his lip.
“Maybe”, Harry clears his throat. “A dildo will do?”
When it’s finally December, they get their last assignments for the month. Harry sits in Potions, but he doesn’t really listen to the Professor. He wants this month to be over with as soon as possible. He wants to go home for Christmas already.
“Harry, please come with us!” Neville begs.
Draco turns his head and softly smiles at Harry. “Morning.”
Harry can’t remember a time when he felt so easy and relaxed around someone. He watches Draco prepare some water and paint. Then, he begins to paint the ocean. His hands run over the paper smoothly, holding the brush with concentration and skill. Harry looks at the scene in front of him in awe.
Harry rolls his eyes and grins. “I’ll give you one shot. No more.”
“Feels weird to be back, right?”, Draco mumbles.
Then, he picks up his phone and grabs the little note with Harry’s phone number.
Harry kisses all the way down and finally unbuckles Draco’s belt. In one swift movement, he undresses Draco and throws his jeans and his boxers away. Then, he licks his lips and starts to massage Draco’s already hard cock with his right hand. His left hand is massaging his balls.
Draco shrugs. “Breakfast.”
“Wonderful”, Draco states and watches the tree in awe.
“Yeah”, Harry answers, ready to take off his clothes and give Draco what he needs.
Harry conjures some lube. Then his warm, slick finger presses at Draco’s entrance, circling around it.
“I also dream of being lonely. Hogwarts isn’t necessarily being nice to me, you know. The people here can be … cruel.”
“I know this is probably an unpopular opinion, but I actually find Draco Malfoy quite handsome”, Ginny giggles as she takes another sip of her fire whiskey.
Draco wraps his arms around Harry and presses a gentle kiss to his forehead. "I was really worried you had already moved on, you know."
“Malfoy, I…-“
Draco hums. “Yeah, didn’t really seem forced to me, either.”
Harry bites his lip. Merlin. Fuck it. “Depends. Usually, top. But it doesn’t have to be.”
Then, Draco opens the second bottle and works the potion into Harry’s hair. Harry lets it all happen.
“I don’t like him,” Harry answers. “It’s just about sex and nothing else.”
He’s on his usual cook-and-talk date with his best friend Neville. This time, it was Draco’s turn to cook for the two of them and he hasn’t stopped complaining about the mysterious boy since Neville entered Draco’s apartment.
He’s so close to coming, the heat becomes almost impossible to bear. He’s sweating, he feels out of breath, but he doesn’t stop. “Ohhh”
The play begins, but Draco doesn’t really pay attention. His thoughts are everywhere except for where they should be.
He frowns when an attractive boy with chocolate like skin and a black short afro sits down next to Harry and throws an arm around him.
“Where the fuck have you been?” Draco shouts, all his emotions building up inside of him. “You haven’t been to any of my lectures in a month! A fucking month!”
But Harry really, really doesn’t want another horrible encounter at the Leaky Caldron. That’s why he insists on staying home.
Draco grabs Harry’s shirt and guides them both to the bed. They fall into the sheets, Draco on top of Harry. Harry immediately runs his hands all over Draco’s body. He feels this desperate need to be closer, so much more intimate. He wants to taste all of Draco and never let go.
“So I’d be very pleased if you could just leave me alone in my misery.”
They slowly grab their belongings and walk outside together. It’s cold. There’s a thick layer of snow covering the grounds of Hogwarts and some students are outside, throwing snowballs at each other. Harry can’t bring himself to feel excited. He feels the heavyweight between him and Draco.
“Merlin, Potter. Only you would apologise for having Sex with someone and think you took advantage of them.”
"Hmmm. I like your name. Draco. That's really special", Harry says after Draco comes back from getting his Chai Latte. "Anyway, it was nice to meet you here. See you on Tuesday!"
Harry presses his lips together. He doesn’t want to admit that he misses that time. He clears his throat. “Why don’t we get away over Christmas? Just the two of us?”
Draco smiles and feels warm and fluffy inside. "I'm glad I could help. If you have any questions feel free to ask."
Harry feels his chest tighten at the sight of Draco in so much pain. He wishes he could do something, anything to help. “I don’t understand.”
Draco squeezes his eyes shut. “I think we both know what this means.”
He sighs and raises his own glass of wine. “You really are something, Potter.”
The boy simply shakes his head. “Oh no. I just wanted to tell you that your lectures are my favourite. I think you’re the best professor in this university.”
“Why would you
I was searching the entire club for you!”
Harry swallows the liquid and coughs, fights for air but doesn’t win since the whiskey has burnt its way down his throat. He needs a moment to collect himself, then he shifts in his seat uncomfortably. He feels weird discussing sex with Malfoy. He doesn’t even talk about sex with his friends.
“Relax, Merlin, you should see your face!”, he laughs. “I just like Workshops, they’re different.”
His phone rings. Draco looks down and sees a new message from Harry.
* * *
Harry snorts and lets himself fall back down onto the sofa. “You’re crazy. I was always one step ahead of you, Malfoy.”
“Did you talk after having sex?”, Hermione asks still confused. There’s a deep wrinkle forming between her bushy brows.
"Merlin, you sound like my mother."
Harry frowns. “No. What the fuck? I already had three cocktails.”
He gives Harry a private, shy smile and Harry returns it.
Harry pushes the doors open and heads inside. He’s immediately being greeted by fifty house elves, all shouting “Mr. Potter, Mr. Potter, Mr. Potter, Mr. Potter!”
Keep it professional, Draco, he warns himself.
“You can do nothing, Potter”, Draco almost cries and it doesn’t even sound angry. Draco simply is in a lot of pain, Harry can tell.
Things are
The wizard knows that he’s a coward. There’s no reason for him to avoid Draco. He should look for him, talk to him, tell him the truth. Be the Gryffindor that he is.
Harry smiles. “This is a children’s movie, but it’s actually very sweet.”
“That sucks.”
He steps aside and allows Draco to take a look at the kitchen table. There are a freshly baked lemon cake and a small package next to it.
Draco slams the door shut, smiles and reaches for Harry's hand. "Nope, wasn't terrible."
That’s why he’s sitting in Transfiguration class. His leg is bouncing up and down. His fingers are playing nervously with a coin while his mind is going everywhere, except the stuff he’s supposed to learn. He sighs. He really needs a solution to this problem.
Draco can't help but smile and wave back. The flutter inside his chest is starting to get annoying.
Harry snickers and nods in agreement. "You're probably right."
He does try, but he doesn’t succeed. It’s pure torture at this point. The lesson feels like a thousand years, and when it’s finally over, Harry jumps up in relief. “I’ll go for a walk.”
"He's not a minor", Draco sighs suddenly feeling very stupid. "But it just feels wrong."
Harry doesn’t know why the hell he’s sharing that kind of information with Draco freaking Malfoy. But he feels comfortable enough right now.
Even though Harry would love to drag this into eternity, he knows that neither of them is going to last very much longer. Harry’s cock is throbbing painfully. And Harry desperately wants to drown inside of Draco tonight.
“Convenient,” Draco remarks and puts the two bottles on the table. “Are you still in on this?”
"Okay", Draco croaks. He seems even paler than before and the shaking has gotten worse. "We're done."
“Fuck,” Harry whispers into the kiss. He bites Draco’s lip and then grabs the boy’s t-shirt. He pulls it over his head and surges down to kiss Draco’s chest.
pushing him into the mattress.
“Harry”, Draco cries. His breathing is ragged and the heat radiating from the two of them keeps him in a daze.
Harry nods. “I haven’t made up my mind yet. I don’t know if I like it or not. I mean. I obviously am
Harry grins as he eventually turns on the radio and hums along to “Fly Me To The Moon” by Frank Sinatra. He almost forgets that Draco is still watching him.
Harry nods. He also trusts Draco the most with potions, simply because he knows that the blonde man is brilliant at brewing potions.
But still. Harry had always felt a weird connection to Malfoy. For years, he strangely obsessed over the blonde boy, blaming him for every single bad thing and putting so much energy and effort into hating him. And now that the hate is gone, his obsession technically should have left too. But he still searches the classroom for him. His eyes still land on Malfoy in the Great Hall during breakfast. He still watches him during class. He still thinks about those impossibly soft curls and those grey, sad eyes.
He accepts the shot that Neville prepares for him and tries to place it in between Hermione’s cleavage. But Hermione fights back. “No. I’m not doing that. It’s Ron’s turn, not mine! Why should I do something I don’t want to do when it’s not even my turn?”
But Draco doesn't listen. He begins to massage Harry’s shoulder with his free hand. The other pushes into Harry at a quick pace. Harry needs to focus. Otherwise, he might come just from this.
“I need you to fill me up, need your cock inside my arse. Please, Draco! Please", Harry begs.
“I can’t,” Harry admits. He’s wide awake now. Also, because he feels his morning wood sticking into Draco’s hip, which makes him feel a little awkward. But at least, Draco’s morning wood is pressing into his stomach, so it’s not
Harry’s head snaps around. “Wait. You do know what a movie is, right?”
Harry nods and lets him continue. When Draco’s hands move lower and rest on his shoulders, Harry can’t stop the happy sigh leaving his lips. Draco begins to massage his shoulders, rubbing and squeezing them gently and Harry wants to turn around and kiss the other man. God, he really, really wants to kiss him.
And Harry pushes into him in a steady, hard rhythm, his orgasm slowly building up. He knows that Draco won’t be able to walk tomorrow, but right now, he couldn’t care less. He slams into him, harder and harder, as hard as he can.
“Magical”, Draco says, looking absolutely stunned. “So, do you have a phone?”
Some kind of strange energy forces him to walk closer to the shower, closer to Malfoy.
“Oh my god”, Harry groans and pushes himself up with his arms.
Harry nods. “Yeah. It’s tough sometimes.”
having
Draco can't even be mad. How could he? He has a wonderful boyfriend, an amazing best friend and after tonight he would have great new friends.
“It all started off with an incredibly stupid idea. Um. We basically hooked up. But we weren’t sober at the time.”
Draco gulps. „I just like to be prepared.“
Draco feels even more proud of himself. He can’t believe he managed to pull this off. Even his coworkers praise him for his fantastic idea and his fabulously written request.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
A few more pushes and then, Draco sees stars. He has never come this hard in his entire life.
Draco waits a couple of seconds before replying. He licks his lips. Then, he blinks. “No. I don’t find you attractive.”
Draco nods. “Hm.”
Harry nods but doesn't dare to speak up. He doesn't trust his voice right now.
now.”
. I’m sorry, mate. It seems like you actually have to stop being a dick and talk to Draco like a normal, mature grown-up man. That must be so bad.”
The streets are already crowded. There are so many people surrounding them, many of them are muggles. The atmosphere is electric, the smell of alcohol, smoke, and sweat is hanging in the air. Harry grabs Dean’s arm because he doesn’t want to lose his friends in the crowd.
Harry nods again. “Seems like they don’t care much.”
“I don’t want to talk about sex with you.”
Draco reaches for a powder, reaches past Harry and brushes his stomach, making Harry hiss. Thankfully, no-one but Draco notices. They bot turn a dark shade of red.
Draco takes some oil and rubs it all over his aching cock. Then, he places himself on top of Harry. His left hand grabs Harry's waist, squeezing it tightly. Draco's certain it will leave dark bruises on Harry's delicate skin. The right hand guides his dick closer to Harry's entrance.
Draco nods. “Yeah. Same. This was insane.”
Draco chuckles. “Harry Grandpa Potter, huh? Can’t keep up with me. You’re just too slow. I always knew it.”
Draco doesn’t feel any different. It’s all too much. Harry on top of him, rolling his hips down on Draco’s. Harry’s dick touching Draco’s.
Harry shrugs again as he shoves a cinnamon roll inside his mouth. “No. Nothing. I just really enjoy life right now.”
But Harry feels nauseous. He wants to hide in his bed here in the Burrow and never face reality again. He shouldn’t have kissed Draco. He ruined everything between them. And even though Draco told him he loved him, he still disappeared. Maybe he regrets saying it now. Fighting Voldemort was easy compared to confessing your feelings not only to yourself but also to the person you love. Harry wants the world to open up and swallow him.
He holds his breath and throws his phone on his bed. Then, he lets out a silent, frustrated scream. He is pathetic. Why does he care so much? Even Greg, his cat, looks at him disappointed at what his owner has become - a pathetic man with an embarrassing crush!
"I promise I keep quiet", Harry says before he begins to type something into his laptop.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
“Draco”, Harry cries. His face scrunches up so much, Draco doesn’t know whether it’s pain or pleasure. “I’m so close, so close”
“Draco.”
He’s so close to coming, the heat becomes almost impossible to bear. He’s sweating, he feels out of breath, but he doesn’t stop. “Ohhh”
When they take a walk through Hyde Park, Draco purposely walks closer to Harry, but Harry keeps himself busy talking to the girl Hermione or her ginger boyfriend and Draco feels empty without Harry by his side.
“Oh no. Did he break your heart?”, Ron asks. Hermione kicks him in the stomach.
“Potter. It’s already fucking weird. We’re not friends. We’re not enemies. What is there to lose? We’re not risking anything here. Fuck, we don’t even like each other. No feelings, no attachments, no risks. Just a one-time thing.”
Harry grins and shakes his head. “You’re unbelievable, Malfoy.”
Harry watches him closely and probably notices Draco’s wet hair and soaked clothes. His eyes turn a shade darker and he licks his lips. “Right.”
“Fancy seeing you here, Potter.”
Harry shrugs. “Yeah, why not? I’d rather spend Christmas with you, knowing that you’ll actually enjoy yourself than spending Christmas at the Burrow, worrying about you.”
Harry grins. “Okay. I won’t tell, I promise.”
He moves closer to Draco and waits for him to make the next move. He eventually does by taking Harry’s hand and guiding him to the big bathtub. The water is warm and smells fantastic. “Mmm. What did you put in there?”
“Anyway,” Dean says and throws a Hoodie at him. “You have to go. You’re late.”
This kid is going to be the death of him.
Draco wraps his free arm around Harry and pulls him even closer to his chest. “Fuck, Harry, you look so fucking good, you have no idea.”
“No. And if you really must know: I am horny. All the time.”
Why would Harry stop? He wishes he could do this for the rest of his life. Being with Draco, seeing him like this, feels so fucking right. There’s nothing in this world that makes him feel better. He feels like he’s supposed to be right here, with Malfoy.
Harry steps closer to Draco and grabs his hands, keeping them still. “Why would you think that?”
Only Harry seems to notice. He grins at him every two seconds.
“You need to stop this.”
“Okay,” Harry breathes after a while. “It’s okay. Move. Harder, please!”
Draco watches him for a while.
Draco tilts his head. “What makes you think that?”
Draco doesn't care. He pushes the door open, but just as he wants to close it, Harry shoves himself into the tiny room with him, he locks the door behind him and grabs Draco's arms. Then he pushes Draco against the door, pressing himself against him.
“So?”, Draco tilts his head, more serious now. “Why can’t you sleep, then?”
starting to get out of hand when after one of his lectures Harry asks him if he’s doing any smaller seminars or workshops soon.
“Had a nightmare”, he mumbles and hides his face in Draco’s chest. “Please. Just hold me.”
Then, his hand closes around Draco's arm, sending shivers straight down to his cock. Draco must feel it too, judging by the way he flinches and hisses at the skin contact.
nothing. Yes. He doesn’t think about why that’s stinging inside his chest so much. Nope.
Suddenly, Harry hears a little squeak close to his foot. Harry looks down, looking for anything that could’ve made that sound. Then, something tiny hits the left side of his foot. Harry frowns and takes a closer look. And there, hidden behind his bag, sits a little mouse looking up at him with huge, terrified eyes.
“Maybe we should start being friends for now. Like, actually hang out and do things together, you know? We never actually got to know each other”, Harry suggests.
But now, he actually feels ready to commit. To fall in love. To actually be with someone. And for some stupid reason, he had hoped that Hogwarts might give him just that. But oh boy, Harry was so wrong. Harry has never felt more uncomfortable and out of place in his entire life. Harry painfully accepts that the other students either adore him or they are terrified of him which makes living at Hogwarts very difficult for him. It's a horrible situation. The only people he can talk to are his friends and a few of his classmates.
"Turn around", Draco orders him softly and watches Harry turn around on his stomach quickly.
“Nev?”
Hermione, Molly, Ginny, and Luna have prepared a big party over the last few weeks. They’ve invited every wizard and witch they roughly know. Harry feels exhausted by simply listening to Ginny reading out names who are invited.
Draco shrugs. “I want to try. I never really made an effort to learn anything about them. I always did what my father told me. I copied his opinions, beliefs, and attitude towards muggles. I want to educate myself and have my own opinions, you know?”
“Why not?”
Hermione grabs Harry’s elbow and guides him forward, a knowing wrinkle forming between her bushy brows. Harry sighs. She knows him too well.
Draco sighs. "I don't think I can do that. Neville, he's really bloody attractive. I've never seen such green eyes in my entire life!"
He continues to snap random pictures until he flips the camera and squeaks when he sees his own face. Harry laughs.
Harry watches Draco for a moment, his heart beating incredibly fast. He really doesn’t deserve Draco.
Harry’s eyes shoot open. “What? Y’all noticed since then?!”
Draco’s eyes widen. “Um. How am I supposed to do that?”
Harry removes his hands from Draco’s skin and Draco immediately begins to shake and tremble in pain. “Fuck, hurry up!”
Draco gets out of his car and rushes up to Harry.
Draco sits a couple of benches behind him, his blonde hair flowing in the wind, a grey scarf wrapped around his neck, and a cigarette between his lips. Harry didn’t even know that Malfoy smokes.
Malfoy chuckles. Harry’s heart stammers inside his chest. Merlin.  „Nothing’s changed, has it? You’re still running straight into trouble.”
And Harry does. Draco snaps the picture. Harry makes sure that he immediately sends it to him.
Draco runs a hand over his face, feeling a bit embarrassed. How Harry looks absolutely fabulous straight after waking up he has no idea.
Harry turns around in surprise so that he can look at Draco. “You have nightmares?”
But Draco still can’t seem to move. He’s scared that Harry won’t want him anymore. What if Harry met somebody new? What if Harry hates him now?
"So you're interested in gender studies and also feminism, I suppose. What else are you interested in that's somehow related to these topics?"
Fuck. Why did Harry and Draco both think this was a good idea again? Harry knew it would be fucking awkward the moment he could think clearly again.
“Have you already done the transfiguration assignment?” Harry obviously tries to change the topic because he doesn’t want to talk about this thing with Draco. It’s all going in a great direction. He doesn’t want to overthink it. All he wants is to enjoy the moment.
Draco huffs out a dry laugh. “Potter! Shove your arse inside my dick, please. I think it’s obvious how much I want it.”
Harry bites his lip. Ah, fuck it. “I find you physically attractive, yes. I always thought you were good looking, to be completely honest.”
Harry chuckles. “Ssshh. A mouse.”
does.
Draco feels so stupid for being that much upset but he can’t help it. The thing is, he misses having Harry around. He
, Harry thinks. Surprised, but also slightly worried, Harry follows him.
With a wink, Harry turns back around, walks out of the office and leaves Draco feeling hot and flustered and bothered.
He manages to relax more and more, allowing Draco to slip his third finger in with almost no resistance.
When dinner is finally ready, they move to the living room and sit down on the couch.
“You have no idea how many times I wanked over the thought of you”, Draco sighs.
But even if Harry was the love of his life - could Draco jump over his own shadow? Could he let go of the fear and the thoughts telling him that this is wrong? Telling him to stop this immediately?
“Harry!”, he sighs, reaching for Harry’s arms, shoulders, anything. He seems desperate for more. “Please, please! Do something, oh god.”
Dean only shrugs. “Hermione brewed it, ask her.”
Harry huffs. “No! God, no. I promise you. It’s not drugs. I would tell you, I promise.”
Draco’s mouth opens in a silent cry, his eyes are tightly shut, and the hand around Harry begins to squeeze tightly. “Harry, I’m so close - Nnnghh! “
Harry’s eyes flicker around the crowded hallway. “Um. Yeah. Kinda. I don’t know. “
“Hey”, Draco smiles as he steps into the library. “Ready to work on our assignment?”
Harry watches him mesmerized. How could anyone be so beautiful?
“Why? You could’ve gotten laid.”
He doesn’t know if his eyes trick him but he could swear he can see a light blush on Harry’s cheeks. “Twenty four.”
Harry chuckles. “Don’t worry, I knew it needed some explanation. This is a phone.”
Draco pushes himself up, away from Harry. He gets out of the bed and starts to pick up his clothes from where they took them off last night. Harry watches him get dressed. Even now, sober and conscious, he can’t deny that Draco has delicate, soft skin and a wonderfully toned body. He feels his cock twitch at the sight. Harry stops his thoughts right then and there. No, he’s
Draco shakes his head. “No. Mother always made our house-elves do it.”
“Hermione,” he says and squeezes her hand. “You really did a fantastic job with the decoration. The room looks amazing.”
“I don’t know,” Harry admits. “I’m not really in the mood just yet.”
Harry tilts his head. He knows Draco well enough to know that there’s more to the story.
Draco is satisfied with himself. They went to both museums, spent the perfect amount of time in each of them, they had an interesting tour guide and the students all beam at him happily when he tells them they are free to do whatever they want to do.
Then, he reaches up and tries to attach the star to the top of the tree. Draco’s shirt slides up, revealing just the tiniest bit of soft, silky, pale skin. And Harry, he –
Malfoy doesn't look up. His lips are pressed together tightly and he seems to concentrate on his work.
Harry smiles. “Yeah?”
He decides to only focus on his job, his profession. Draco loves being a professor and he wouldn’t let one beautiful student distract him like that. The thing is, many students are attractive. Draco isn’t blind. There are many attractive, athletic boys walking around on the campus. Most of them are studying medicine or sports or law. But no one has taken his breath away quite like the boy with the messy hair and green eyes.
Harry moans out loud. “
Neville listens closely.
Harry holds his breath and presses his lips together. "I'm sorry! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you."
Draco’s head snaps up. “What?”
Draco hums in pleasure. “I need this so much, Harry, please give me everything.”
you don't want to be with me.”
He presses a kiss down onto Draco’s shoulder, bites him, and sucks. He wants to leave marks all over Draco’s body. But right now, he wants to fuck him. Harry places himself in front of Draco’s entrance and teases him with the tip of his cock. He lets it slide across Draco’s entrance a couple of times without actually pushing in.
Harry nods. He feels as if he destroyed something between them, but he doesn’t know what that is. “Malfoy, wait.”
His words get stuck in his throat when Ron enters the living room, arms wrapped tightly around Draco Malfoy’s shoulders and guiding him towards the couch.
“So, like a ‘friends with benefits’ kind of thing?”
Draco grabs Harry’s back with both hands, pushes him forward in a bending position. Now, Draco can hit Harry from a different angle, pushing inside harder and faster. When he hits that particular spot inside him, Harry moans loudly, bites in his own arm, and tries to control his body to stop himself from shaking. It’s all too much. He desperately needs to come. He’s so freaking close.
Draco only hums. It’s so dark, he can only see shadows of Harry. „I use lots of conditioner.“
Draco roams his hands all over Harry’s body, kissing him fiercely and holding onto him for dear life, biting his lip and scratching his back.
Draco looks at Harry for a couple of seconds. Then, he sighs and nods. “Yeah sure.”
But after fucking Draco into oblivion, he doesn’t quite think everything is just good between them. He thinks it’s a lot more complicated than that.
When he plays an interview with a historian-author, he walks to the side of the lecture hall, leans on the wall and watches Harry watching the video.
Harry frowns. "How could I move on from
Harry contemplates for a second. Should he really drink with Draco Malfoy? But then again, why shouldn’t he? “Yeah. Why not.”
"And why is it complicated?", she smiles. "Does he have a boyfriend? Is he straight? Is he not interested in you?"
Harry seriously contemplates apparating to London for a night out and look for a nice, quick fuck. But he knows that’s against the school rules, so he tries to get a grip on himself. He really doesn’t want to get in trouble for leaving the school grounds even if he’d probably get away with it.
Harry rolls his eyes and sits back down. “I’m getting annoyed with you, Malfoy. I really am. I'm starting to think you're following me around.”
Draco sighs and rubs his eyes. “I don’t want to talk about this.”
"Wait. Do you mean Dean?", Harry asks. "Afro, hipster clothes, perfect chocolate like skin?"
“Harry!” Draco shouts, arching his back. “Fuck. I need you inside me right now, please, fill me up, quit the teasing. Be rough with me.”
Draco trails his fingers down Harry's spine and frowns as he notices the dark bruises on Harry's back. "Sorry."
Harry lets his bag drop to the floor and rushes towards Draco. “I was so hoping for you to say that.”
Harry wants to hug Draco. Merlin, he really wants to reach out and give Draco a tight hug, make him feel loved and cherished, and never let go. He clears his throat. Don't cross the line, Harry. “Okay, well. Then this is a Christmas Holiday filled with firsts. Let’s decorate a Christmas tree for the first time!”
He wishes he could wrap him up in his arms again.
“Oh my god,” Harry groans and pushes himself up with his arms. He’s beginning to sweat, and he needs a moment to collect himself.
“But what makes somebody attractive to you?”
Draco nods. “Yeah, I never would’ve made a move on you.”
And now he’s sitting in between Neville and Luna, feeling incredibly uncomfortable since everyone in the Leaky Cauldron is staring at him. He tries to hide his discomfort, but the others notice it too.
Harry sighs. He really can’t tell Draco that he hasn’t been able to stop thinking about the other man. They agreed on casual terms. A one-time thing to release some pressure. If Harry opens up about his weird emotional state, Draco would roll his eyes, make fun of him, or, worse, get actually annoyed with him and stop talking to him at all. Harry doesn’t want that.
The man underneath him shivers and arches his back, searching for more skin on skin contact.
And Harry does. He comes all over Draco’s hand and uses his own cum to get Draco off.
“Harry,” Draco groans. Harry begins to lick the inside of Draco’s thighs, occasionally bites as he strokes Draco’s hole with his fingertip.
“I will.”
“Mhm.” He doesn’t notice the curious glances and smirks his friends are exchanging. “You might reconsider tagging along.”
Harry needs a moment. He holds on to Draco’s shoulders, squeezes his eyes shut, and takes a few deep breaths. Then, slowly, very slowly, his vision comes back and he looks up. Suddenly, he realizes how close Draco and Harry are standing. He could easily move forward and press his lips on top of Draco’s. He can already feel his breath on his lips. It would be so damn easy.
the Amortentia. I hated not talking to you over the past few weeks. We can’t go back to not talking.”
Harry forces himself not to look up from his book and look over at Malfoy for the hundredth of time for today's lesson. It surprises him that no-one else has noticed yet. Or maybe they have and they simply kept it to themselves.
