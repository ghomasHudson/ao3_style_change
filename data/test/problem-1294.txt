Ron you better not find and read this or I will resurrect myself, find Crookshanks and you will never see that replacement rat you said you’d get ever again (you have been warned).
If I do die, Draco, I know we’ll meet again, in another life, on another plane of mortality. This isn’t ‘it’, there has to be more to come. I said earlier that we don’t get second chances but deep down I hope I'm wrong.
If you got this letter then I’m dead, uhhh so that’s a thing that might happen, just more fun to look forward to I guess!! It’s a bit of a gamble honestly, I mean I’m writing this under a tree in the middle of a forest with a mouse staring me down and in a month I might be five feet under or I might be cooking that little bloody mouse for dinner but I’ll just have to wait and see I guess.
I’ve always wondered what it’ll be like, dying. Whether it’ll be instant or prolonged and painful. Where I’ll go after, what’s next. I like to think I’ll see my mum again, my Dad, and Sirius. Well, I hope it’ll be like that; I want to know them from more than just old stories and legacies. I want them to know me, my personality, the subjects I liked at Hogwarts, what I wanted to do after school, who I wanted to be and the things I love.
The dreams turned to nightmares when my mind was stained by what I did to you in that bathroom. I can never forgive myself for that, and I don’t think you will or should either, I don’t deserve it. This story still started in the same place, the misted tree labyrinth, the same innocent figure, yet the perspective was never the same. The journey would start one of two ways: I’d see it all play out and not be able to interfere, just like before, a God in a world I subconsciously crafted, or I’d be running behind the boy, chasing him like a shadow, yet still grasping for anything that would amount to some control. In this new dream, I felt everything he did, whilst still experiencing the world as a second being that existed within it. His face was something I never truly saw, I never seemed to even try to, but I always knew it was you.
I want you to know me, I wish you had. I wish I knew you, Merlin the years I spent wanting to know you.
I was actually sort of maybe kind of “stalking” you in our 6th year, or Hermione calls it that anyway, but whatever you call it I am sorry, it was a bit weird I have to admit (MY SUSPICIONS WERE RIGHT THOUGH SO CAN YOU BLAME ME? Exactly.) It started with me watching you (I know how I sound - hear me out) from across the classroom, from across the crowded halls. I scanned your face every day for clues about what was up with you that year, what had happened to your spark, if it was still there just being masked by anxiety or if it was a mere smoke trail in the darkness. I think I always knew which one was true. I think deep down, I just wanted to know if you were ok.
Do you remember in flying class when you stole Neville’s Remebrall? I chased you in the sky and it landed me on the quidditch team, which you weren’t exactly thrilled at. It was the first time I’d ever rode a broom, and I ended up using that memory to try and conjure a Patronus you know? It didn’t work, but it could’ve. If we were up there together, as equals and friends, if your smirk had been a grin and your snark had been teasing or banter or something. It was a happy memory, but not happy enough.
I’ll see you around I guess? Not sure how to end this letter (I mean I’m just laughing and crying at this point so that explains it), so just do what I say and enjoy the life that’s ahead of you, it’ll get better I swear to you Draco.
Ok I think that’s it? I’ve got to go now but hopefully this gave you... something? I don’t know, I can’t really see from the tears streaming down my face but I’ll leave you with one last thing, one last thing you have to promise you’ll do and if you don’t I can’t do anything but- fuck just please live your life like you’re living it for both of us, like there’s 2 souls in your body. Please. That means no regrets and no self-loathing, you live your life like I’m walking on the ground right beside you… like I’ve always dreamt of doing. I’m not sure you feel how I do and I can’t even guarantee that you’re still reading, let alone that you even have this letter in your hands, but this is the last thing I’ll ever ask anyone for, so yeah.
You used to disappear from the map and all that’d be left would be an almost-non existing whisper where your footsteps faded from. It gave me a motivation, an excuse for why I followed you, talked about you, why you never left my mind. Traces of you clouded my every waking moment. From when I got dressed in the morning to my dreams at night, I never knew why. In the beginning, I’d dream of a faceless figure in a forest, me looking down upon them like an omnipresent being. I couldn’t interact at all, they didn’t know I was even there, yet I watched them tear through a dreary forest to safety, out into a golden spring clearing, then wading into the depths of a glistening clear water stream. The boy would always be wearing a white flowy gown, nothing like I’d ever seen before, it’d sheer in the water as my dreams would fade. He always made it to safety, wherever he came from or meant to go.
I used to be able to wake myself up from nightmares unless they were visions poisoning my brain (courtesy of Tom Riddle), but not these. If I tried hard enough I could de-immerse myself a little, mellowing the sea of raw emotion churning around me, but my conscience never let me unravel myself completely. I just had to live it through, like some divine punishment self-sentenced by the lore of my own mind palace. Even when I’d wake up and go about my day, I never really left that world; entranced and caged by the dreams of you, involuntarily trapped in this fantasy world where I could wish for an alternate ending, a do-over. It was like every moment was a trance, a hallucination and you were the only constant in both.
Then when we got to Hogwarts, you got up infront of everyone and asked to be my friend. You were rude, pompous and a little shit but… I regret not saying yes. You were insufferable in that moment (and every minute after that), but a part of me never stopped wondering what would’ve happened if I’d taken that hand of yours and become your friend. I’ve spent so long over the years wondering about the whole thing, but the last couple of months have led me to realise that I seriously bloody regret not knowing you, the real you. It’s not like that encounter on the stairs was my only chance either, I mean the only reason I got put into Gryffindor was because I didn’t like the impression you gave me; and being in the same house as you would’ve been another way to become your friend, a second chance, but I’m stupid, and we don’t seem to get second chances.
I remember when you made those ‘Potter Stinks’ badges in 4th year, they were irritatingly popular. You conveniently made them around the time Ron decided to fuck off (guess that was foreshadowing eh?) so that was great fun for me. On top of that, even Cedric’s friends wore them, so there really was no escape from your endless provoking. I miss him, Cedric. I miss him a lot. Someone so ambitious and optimistic and… happy, having their life cut short like that, I guess it was foreshadowing too I guess? Sorry, that’s probably not the right thing to say. Anyway, the whole pin thing was pretty funny thinking about it now, as much as it pissed me off. And this may be the dehydration talking but you must’ve spent hours trying to find the right photo to shove onto that stupid pin. I can just imagine you laying out what… 50 different photos on the common room floor? Then asking your friends to help you decide which one would annoy me the most. Them all watching your frustration, maybe Pansy laughing affectionately at you whilst Vincent stuffed his face with the latest treats he’d found. That reminds me, I can’t believe you never found out about us polyjuicing as Crabbe and Goyle in second year. There are so many things that you think you know about but in reality I don't think you have any idea about honestly. You’ll have to ask Ron and Hermione about that too, there aren’t enough minutes left in my day to explain all these little things.
Harry was pulled from his thoughts when Draco cleared his throat, clearly waiting for him to answer. He shrugged, “He saved my life. He may have been a bastard and an asshole, but he looked out for me in his own way, kept me alive. And..” and he gave you back your life. Harry wanted to say. “And he died because of me. It’s the least I could do for him.” “Typical Potter.” Draco scoffed. “Always thinking everything revolves around you. He died because of Voldemort, you dolt. You didn’t kill him. You didn’t point your wand at him and take his life. Don’t take credit for it. I’m sure you’re thinking all of those other deaths are on you. But you can’t do that. Unless you were the one who fired the curse, other people’s deaths are never your choice nor your responsibility. You’re not a killer.”
That same day, Harry was in a bad temper. He had to cook a second batch of breakfast for Daphne, because the eggs were not the correct consistency, and Seamus, one of their farmhands, just had a baby last night, so he had to do the harvest himself. It was still morning, but he was already tired, and Daphne had the urge to go to the market for a new set of earrings. So here he was, picking fresh peaches while on his way to the stables to prepare the horses for the carriage.
The Plague had taken Narcissa as victim, and the kingdom grieved for her as much as their own loved ones. Lucius’ grief was worst as he had grown sullen and reserved, even to Draco. When Narcissa was still alive, Draco, as the next King, had learned from her that a good ruler must always place the good of his subjects above himself. Lucius, unfortunately, lost the love of his life, and turned cold and cruel in his rule. He even decreed that Draco could not ascend to the throne if he had not found a suitable partner.
Once upon a time, there was a Young boy who lived in a manor house in Godric’s Hollow, with the best gardens in the country. His father James was a minor Lord of the House of Potter, and had businesses dealing in plants and potions in the adjacent villages and kingdoms. His mother Lily was a common country girl with no lineage, but possessed an extraordinary talent in potions, which was perhaps what drew James to her.
As Draco sobered from his laughing fit, he looked up to see Harry’s serene smile, the first true smile he had seen on that handsome face, ever since the end of 5th year. “I can’t believe you’re the first person I came out to.” Draco said, shaking his head. “I can keep a secret.” Harry whispered. “If you don’t want anyone else knowing, I can shut up about this. You’re still you, gay or straight makes no difference.” Draco sighed in relief, knowing that at least Harry was not homophobic, and his confession had not ruined his chances at friendship with the Savior. “So.” Draco added awkwardly. “Thanks, and I appreciate you keeping it to yourself, for now. I’m still trying to think up of ways to tell my parents. Like, No Father, I am not honoring the engagement contract with the Greengrasses, as neither Daphne nor Astoria possesses the cock that I desire.” Harry choked out another laugh at this. He thought he knew all he needed to know about Draco Malfoy from observing him across the Great Hall for the past six years, but he was dead wrong. He fell even more entranced by Draco’s dry humor and sharp wit as they traded suggestions on how to come out to Draco’s parents. “Or you could say, Father, do not expect any heirs from me, as I hardly believe that a man’s anal cavity could have the capability to produce a child.” Harry giggled.
Harry took some time to clean himself up and pick up their crop and the latest potion orders, before heading to the market himself, hoping that he won’t bump into the Prince, or at least that he did not recognize Harry, so that he won’t die of embarrassment.
Lily and Harry continued on with James’ businesses, with Harry taking care of the farm for their potion ingredients, as well as some vegetable crops, dairy cattle, and horses, while Lily continued to experiment on improvements in their potions. One day, a few weeks before Harry’s 16th birthday, Lily’s experiment had gone wrong and she inhaled toxic gas. The healer was not able to spell away all the fumes, and estimated that she may die of lung tissue damage in the next few days. Lily resigned to accept her fate, but cried for her baby, her Harry, who will be left without a family. Lily spent her remaining days with Harry at her bedside, reading to her, and promising to keep the farm and their business afloat. She set aside a modest fund for Harry, as she was sure that Petunia would be given control of the Potter accounts when she was gone.
Harry let out a sigh of relief, but he noticed that Draco tensed up instead. “Now as for you Mr. Potter, I am technically not allowed to bring in guests while the school is closed, but we may provide you food and lodging in return for your support in the castle repairs. I do recall that you had a special map that could help, correct?” Harry nodded absently, still looking intensely at Draco and watching his eyes turn fearful at the prospect of being held in trial. Draco looked back at Harry with a pleading look, silently asking for him to just drop it. Minerva continued, unaware of the tension building up between the two boys. “Ms. Granger will be coming by anytime soon for her daily visit Mr. Potter, so I suggest you get ready to move in on your suite, so you can meet her there instead of here. So, if there’s anything else, you can call on Tippy, she’ll be glad to help you.”
“Hey Cinderboy, what’s taking so long? We’ll be late to the marketplace! I heard the Prince will be there today!” Daphne screamed from inside the house. “All right, all right, I’m on my way!” Harry shouted back. Harry let Ronald, their actual stable boy, take the ladies to the market. “Hey Ron, when you get back, please check on the other horse there? He needs shoe replacement.” “Sure Harry. Anything else you need? You look like you had a fine morning. Earlier today I thought you were about to pull your hair out!” “It was a strange morning. I met someone… Well I’ll tell you about it later, can you take these bitches away now, please?” Ron laughed at that.
He took his time cleaning up in the shower, until the water ran clear a no longer a muddy brown from all the dirt his skin had accumulated over the last few days. He noticed a few more bruises in his torso, and a small burn in his leg. Was this from the dragon, two days ago? Or from the Fiendfyre yesterday? He didn’t know anymore. He decided to stop by the infirmary to get some potions. He dressed up to make himself more presentable. He found a set of robes, deep red, almost black, that was folded neatly at the foot of the bed, and he wore those, thinking Kreacher must have prepared it, since his own clothes were ruined beyond repair.
This was the sight that met Hermione Granger as she entered the infirmary. To say that she was confused at seeing Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy giggling like third year girls is a massive understatement. She walked back out of the infirmary, as if retracing her steps might lead to a different outcome, but as she stepped back in, Harry was gasping, grabbing his stomach, while Draco was sniggering and snorting, face red and tears in his eyes. She cleared her throat in an effort to make sense of the scene in front of her. “Oh, Hermione, you’re here! Professor McG mentioned that you’ve been visiting, thanks ever so for still looking out for me.” Harry said as soon as he was able to recover from his laughing fit. “Granger.” Malfoy said as coolly as he could, in spite of his disheveled appearance. “Dare I ask what happened here?” Hermione said, raising her eyebrows. “Oh, we were just…” Harry gave a sideways glance at Malfoy, who proceeded to interrupt him. “Thinking up ways to tell Lucius Malfoy to go fuck himself.” “I see.” Hermione looked at Harry with a ‘we’ll talk about this later’ visible in her expression. “Well, would you like to relocate to your suite? McG had the DADA professor’s rooms cleared out for two, from what I remember. I could take the couch for the next two days until.. you know.” Harry ended awkwardly. Hermione raised an eyebrow again, mouthing to Harry ‘Draco??’. “I better check with Poppy first if she’ll allow me out of this bed. You go on ahead, I know my way there. I’m sure you have a lot to catch up on with Granger.” Draco said.
“I.. I..” Harry started. He knew the Professor was right. If he had been with the others, he would have pushed himself to comfort Ron and Ginny and Molly, without thought of how he himself needed the rest. “Thank you,” he whispered.
Harry felt the sun warming his face. Huh. That was new. His bed faced the west side window, he shouldn’t be feeling the sun in the morning.. oh! It was nearing sunset. He must have been more tired that he imagined. His stomach gave a loud growl, and he noticed a plate of food on his bedside. “Thanks Kreacher” he whispered. He dug in to the Shepherd’s pie and butterbeer, before making his way to the bathroom to clean up. I look much better now, he thought to himself. His eyes were still sunken, but now their usual clear green, no longer dull and dead looking. There were a few bruises on his cheek, but otherwise his face was relatively unscathed. He felt his ribs and noticed that the swelling and pain had subsided. Amazing what a good few hours of rest can do.
Draco was finally able stop struggling with his cloak and faced his assaulter. “Stop that! I only mean to borrow your horse, and I shall return him immediately!” Harry finally saw the face of the thief, and was surprised to recognize the Prince. “Oh Lord! Forgive me your highness, I did not recognize you! Oh God I shall be punished and executed, oh what have I done!” Harry cried out.“Come now, no need for such dramatics. Just let me have your horse today, and I’ll forget this ever happened, okay?” Draco said in haughty tone. Harry knelt and bowed his head to the ground. “Here now, no need for that.”
Harry lied back down and started to wonder where Ron and Hermione were. Then he remembered the sight of Fred’s open, unseeing eyes, and the laugh that was permanently etched on his face. He remembered seeing Colin’s crushed skull, and Lavender’s ravaged face, and Remus and Tonks reaching out for each other, even in death. He was assaulted with memories of the walk to the Forest, with his Mum and Dad, and Sirius and Remus, all telling him he did good. “Did I do good? Was it enough?” Harry whispered softly, just as Kreacher popped back in and placed a steaming bowl of vegetable and chicken soup. “Thank you Kreacher, you better get your temple looked at before it scars.” Kreacher’s eyes widened and he exclaimed, “Kreacher will get a scar of his forehead like Master, so everyone knows that Kreacher is brave just like his Master!” Harry shook his head exasperatedly. “I’m too tired for this”, he mumbled, just as he finished up his soup and drank up his juice. “Thank you Kreacher. If anyone looks for me let them know I’m here. Just wake me up okay?”. Kreacher nodded and popped out immediately.
Remus and Tonks… Harry’s face fell into a frown, as he tried to remember Andromeda Tonks, Tonks’ mother. Why hasn’t she come? Professor Snape’s last memory was still fresh in his mind, and he thought that the least he could do was make sure Snape was honored like the hero he was. “I’ll arrange for their funerals once I get out of here.” Harry vowed. “I’ll tell Minnie”. Poppy answered before she left. Harry laid on the bed, still exhausted despite the, apparently, 80 hours of rest he had.
As Harry approached the stables, he heard a soft voice. “Here now, relax, good boy.” Padfoot, his best mount, was neighing loudly. “Sshh, come on, just let me… Ah!” followed by the sound of trotting. Harry quickly picked up his basket full of fruit and ran to intercept the horse thief. “Oh no you don’t, you’re not getting my horse, you thief!” He shouted as he started throwing peaches at the cloaked figure on top on Padfoot. “Aah, no stop, stop that!” Harry continued pelting him with the fruit, all the while shouting. “What do you think you’re doing, stealing from us honest folk! Who do you think you are, lazy sodding bastards!” Harry was no longer thinking of the thief, but of his cousins and aunt who have made his morning, and his past four years, hell.
This was his life from the time he was 16, until one day, two months before he turned 21, when everything changed.
Harry’s breath suddenly hitched as he was assaulted with memories of Remus teaching him the Patronus charm in this room. He gasped, trying to catch his breath. There was a sudden influx of magical energy and all the lamps on the corridor flared dangerously high, before dying out. “Harry, are you alright? What’s happening?” Hermione panicked. Harry just shook his head while trying to regain his breath. Suddenly he felt soft long fingers stroking his hair. “Breathe.” A soft voice commanded. “Follow my voice and breathe. In … breathe out… Breathe in… Breathe out… You’re doing so well, a few more breaths come on, in… out…” Harry’s vision started clearing up as his breath evened out. He recognized the voice as Draco’s. “Good. You did good Harry. Granger, sorry for pushing you but your friend was having a panic attack and you weren’t helping.” “How did you know…” “I’ve had them myself. I had to learn meditation techniques on my own to deal with the fact that I lived with a murderer in our Manor. I couldn’t enter the dining room without seeing that monstrous snake eating up whole persons. So I needed to control myself and taught myself meditation and occlumency to control my panic attacks.” “Thank you Draco, and for what it’s worth, I saw how he forced you into it, into torturing them, and I know you had no choice, just like that night with Dumbledore. I don’t hate you anymore you know, I don’t think I ever did.” Harry ended in a whisper.
I am going to update this once a week, but I got far too excited about people actually enjoying my work. Thank you so much for the kudos! Here's another chapter as a reward.
2. What should the dorm layout be like? Should I pair them by house or mix things up? (and any requests for who shares with who are appreciated)
Someone screams behind them, a girl, or a high-pitched boy. Footsteps, horrified gasps and panicked cries, echoing in the stone hallway. The tea seeps into the floorboards, soaked up by the pastries or merging with the scarlet liquid.
Oh great. Now Ginny’s calling him that. Sure, she looked a little disgusted as she said it, but she said it nonetheless.
“Is this gonna be your full-time gig, then?” Ron mumbles, grin slipping at her appearance. The two of them had split up not long ago, although Harry has a feeling it’s only temporary, to give each of them space. They’d never resolved the issue of Hermione wanting independence to follow her own dreams, so Harry thinks this is maybe their way of doing that - letting Hermione find her feet and have a set path in what she wants before getting together again.
"Mr Corner, perhaps I am wrong to assume you are all adults. I'm afraid there are no bubbling children to cover up your words, therefore I would appreciate you tell me directly if you take issue with my decision."
“But it’s not time, yet!” Theo says, hurrying forward and leaving Hermione to shuffle through notes. “He needs to be fully through before your magic is needed to break the spell. If you use your magic up now, he’ll stay a ghost when he comes through!”
“No, no, it’s alright.” Harry hastily reassures her, sitting down after her. “You can call me Harry. It’s weird to be called Mr Potter all the time.” He laughs nervously, and Narcissa joins in with a tinkling laugh, polite and restricted yet clear and bright, like the chandelier in the front hall.
It’s cold outside, the sort of day Wood would declare perfect for quidditch. All the students are in lessons, however. He should be in his lesson. His legs stall, wondering if he should turn back and apologise. Then the horror creeps in, pushing him forwards.
Hesitantly, he nods, still regulating his breathing. For Nott to find him here, like this… He doesn’t think he can quite get over the humiliation. He’s the Saviour. He’s supposed to be the strong, unshakeable one, not the one breaking down in the middle of the Forbidden Forest.
“It’s cruel, really. I became his godfather, promised to take care of him if Lily and James died, and then I only ended up knowing him for little more than two years.” Black sighs, oblivious to Draco’s growing anger. “I wish things could have been different. I wish James and Lily were still alive.”
“It’s ok. That sounds amazing, Hermione. Well done!” Harry grins, holding up his hand for a high five that she gives with an eye roll. “Soon you’ll be running for Minister, no doubt.”
“Liberacorpus!” Potter yells, landing hard on the floor yet stumbling to his feet again quickly, wand in hand.
Too much fluff. Seriously. Far too much fluff for such an angsty fanfic, but it is really cute. You'll be able to tell I was in a very good mood when writing this.
A woman with dark brown hair curled around her ears stands, nodding politely at the cheers. Heartstringer. She looks sensible enough, with a flat expression, yet Draco can see the twinkle in her eyes from a mile away. Hopefully, she will be decent enough to let him pass the subject.
“Inter house unity and all that bullshit probably.” Blaise hisses, anger reducing him to using swear words.
They sit in relative silence, all too caught up in the dread that it was only the beginning. Draco is grateful for it, sliding back into the haze where time passes him by without any emotions, good or bad. Head resting against the leather back of his seat, he stares listlessly out of the window, watching the first drops of rain begin to fall.
The old woman’s gaze softens as she leans back in her chair, regarding him. “You say you’ve thought about this a lot?”
Draco sighs. “Y-yes.” His voice is a whisper, strained and choked, but it’s there. “S-stop- stop wor-worrying.”
“We can come back after.” Remus insists, glancing at Draco. He takes the hint, and nods at his mother, slipping his hand from hers.
The next tug brings him to his feet, and suddenly he can see a doorway ahead of him. Wavering, whispering, gauzy and faint, but definitely an arch to somewhere.
“I don’t need your pity, Potter. I’m fine, and I’m smart enough to know that you don’t care about me at all. What are you actually here for?”
There’s no doubt it was the Slytherins, not by the smug smirks that most of them are parading about in. He passes a small group of them now, sixth year girls, who glance at the red jewels clinging to his hair and giggle. Fist tightening inside his pocket, he flicks his wand at them, sending a sudden gust of wind into their hair. They squeal, frantically trying to save their hairstyles, and he moves on. It’s petty, he knows, but after a full day of the snide whispers, he’s had enough.
“Don’t thank me yet.” She holds up a hand, a pleased twinkle in her eye. “You’ll need approval from the Professor’s Association, and you’ll likely be sharing Theodore’s quarters between the three of you for now. I don’t see why Professor Heartstringer wouldn’t agree, but she might decide not to accept you as her trainee assistant.”
What fandoms do you like reading about on here? Or which fandoms do you think you'll start reading about?
A sinking starts in Draco’s chest, fingers of dread dragging his mood down even further. Today really can’t get any worse.
“You don’t have to say it right now.” Harry rubs his cheekbone with his thumb, soft and gentle and so much better than Draco could ever be worth. “We have all the time in the world. Even if you never manage to say it, I will still know it. It doesn’t matter if you can’t say it. It doesn’t make it any less valid. I love you, and you love me.”
“I don’t know.” Theo flips a page over. “I don’t know how this is going to work, whether he’ll go back to his body or create a new one.”
Draco nods, forming a plus sign with his fingers and then pointing at Harry (and you). The grin on his face feels strange, but a welcome sort of strangeness that he can’t wait to get familiar with.
When this is over, I will be taking a small break from large fics to gather ideas and make a plan for a new one. However, if you've read 'You're Going To Poke Someone's Eye Out', you'll see I've been thinking of writing a story of Gakushuu (from Assassination Classroom) going to Hogwarts. This will include Draco, however Gakushuu will be the centre of the story. I realise not many other people will know AC well enough to be interested in this, so should I:
“I wish you could speak. Then you could tell me about Harry, and about Remus, and about what they’re doing. You’re probably the only person who knows about them who is going to pass through for a long time. Now, I’ll probably have to wait until another family member dies, which will hopefully be a long time.”
His bed is piled with blankets, far more than necessary. He thinks he sees dried blood on a pillow, and remembers when he’d seen Draco spitting blood into the sink in the morning. He had gone back for his socks, having accidentally left them behind, but Draco had looked so furious at being caught that he’d fled and never mentioned it again. Perhaps he should have.
The whispers that spread throughout the hall are louder this time, taking at least a minute to die back down again. The four of them exchange looks. If one of these vigilantes was searching for a perfect group to attack, they would be the ideal candidates. Theodore swallows anxiously, throat bobbing and fingers clenching the table edge.
“But the aesthetic!” Blaise groans, gesturing at his own heeled shoes. “Pansy agrees with me. Plus, you’d be so much more intimidating. I don’t mean to offend, weaselbee, but at your height, no one will take you seriously when you go to arrest them.”
“How dare you!” He spits at them, adrenaline fizzing through him, awakening every sense in his body. “You don’t ever do that, not in this place!”
There are a few gasps, muttered voices mixing with small squeals of surprise. He hasn’t spoken since his death, and before that, had only managed shorter sentences than these. By the looks of delight and shock from the other students, they hadn’t realised he and Harry had been practising.
But it was war. It was a time where even the best of people could do the worst things. His father is by no means a good man, but the echoes of Draco’s childhood can’t let him suffer alone. The admiration and awe he’d held for his father, the years of clawing for a scrap of love from the man, it hasn’t just disappeared. Hearing these words, even when they’re falling out in a blubbering mess, it fills a hole in Draco’s heart that he didn’t even know he had.
“Shut up, you idiot.” Harry huffs, dropping into a seat. “How am I supposed to stop someone from thinking they’ve caused the death of hundreds of people?”
Move. Pounding heart, aching legs, clawing at his stomach. Tense muscles. His glasses slip, sticky with sweat which really shouldn’t be coming out of him, he’s not running, but his hands are clammy and it’s definitely his because he’s thinking about it again.
“We’ll find them. We have to.” Harry sighs, glancing out of the window. Hagrid is fast asleep behind them, rumbling snores undisturbed by their bickering, and the whole of Hogwarts seems to be asleep too. “How long do we have?”
Lupin walks in a couple of minutes later, looking slightly exasperated as her house elves parade over a tray with tea made just how she likes it. They slide it onto the coffee table, then pop away again.
Ron and Hermione dating is fine with him. He’s happy for them. It’s only when it becomes like this, him awkwardly trailing after them, that he can’t help but wish things were like before. When he was the one in the middle, the one they relied on. When he had some reason to be in their lives.
“Master Draco?” There’s a small voice behind him, like a house elf’s, except why would there be a house elf in the hospital ward?
Draco smooths out his face, putting on a stony mask. With this, he fixes the weasel with an icy glare, warning him to back off before something bad happens. He should have guessed it would have the opposite effect.
Updating this instead of sleeping, because I the longer I stay awake, the longer it takes for school to arrive, right? I can't wait for sixth form when I don't have to learn what electromagnetism is...
“Pansy…” Hermione sighs, wishing she had hands to reassure the girl with. “It isn’t anything like that. Draco’s just… He doesn’t want you to worry about him.”
He’s saved from Blaise’s retort by the arrival of food. As always, the Slytherin table consists of a healthy variety of food, unlike the calorie disaster that arrives on the Gryffindor table. All attention turns to salvaging a decently matched meal, apart from Theodore, who seems to absorb any food without a single consequence for his weight. He reminds him far too much of Crabbe and Goyle, except they steadily grew larger. Not any more. With one dead and another in Durmstrang, it’s hard to focus on eating.
He’s already off, fleeing from the room with the guilt snapping at his heels. Her sharp face, defined cheekbones and sloping eyebrows, they remind him so much of Draco. His heart caves in on itself, emotions bursting free of the wreckage as he stumbles through dark halls, the shadows in the corners clutching onto his desperation and ripping it open. He can’t do this. He thinks he’s going to be sick.
Harry, Ron, and Terry are the last left in the common room, and end up talking late. Really, Harry is waiting for them to leave so he can call Remus, but the conversation is enjoyable. Terry tells them he wants to work in the Ministry, and had returned to Hogwarts so that there’s no chance they could turn him down for being ‘underqualified’.
So it isn’t just him who feels it. “Gobsy, what do you mean he needed help with everything? He can walk fine.”
I'm spending far too much time flicking through instagram instead of writing or talking to people, so to get myself motivated, I'd like to know more about you! I love knowing what people are thinking about my work, but most importantly, I love seeing what you're like. Therefore, I'm going to start asking a short question at the bottom of every chapter or work I publish, and see what you say.
“Well. Really I’m just here because I want to be. I told you earlier, I don’t hate you anymore. Maybe I never really did.” Harry pursed his lips, hesitating while he made the decision whether or not to let Draco in on his deepest, darkest secrets. He decided to take the leap, to trust that Draco would not use such information for anything. He had already seen Harry’s breakdown in the corridor, it wasn’t like the next bits of information was going to be any less damaging for his reputation. “I didn’t have a good childhood you know, so the truth is, I was envious of you. You always got those sweets from your mum, and you were so well dressed and posh and I could tell that your parents doted on you. I wanted that my whole life, and there you were rubbing it in my face that I could never have it. So I guess I resented you, for a while, until that year.” He knew that Draco knew what he meant. “I followed you around and I could tell that you were more and more miserable everyday. And I realized that your life was not all the rainbows and butterflies I thought it to be, especially with Voldemort living in your house.” “I hate him. He destroyed my family, invited those monsters into our home, and defiled…” Draco’s eyes went blank as if trying to close off his thoughts. Harry didn’t push, and instead walked over to Draco’s bed to hold his hand. “Ssshh. It’s ok, your safe now. I’m here. You can feel me here, it’s over now, he’s gone. He’ll never come back, and they won’t be able to harm you again, I promise you.” Harry continued to stroke Draco’s hand until he felt the pulse calm down, and Draco’s face relaxed as he fell asleep. Harry let go of his hand, but Draco held on tighter, making Harry chuckle softly and whisper “I’m not going anywhere, I’m here for you, you’re safe now.”
We kissed then, lips meeting once more, and the taste of you was magnificent. I could taste your Teeth Cleaning Charms, and ginger crèmes, and I sighed into you, feeling your whole-body shudder as you surrendered into your pleasure.
“Although one of the blood relations is my mother, and she probably wouldn’t say so – not yet – but I think she’s rather fond of your son. If you were to meet each other, you might have fought about dining conversation etiquette as well as the appropriate attire for the occasion of a family dinner. And you would have disagreed on each other’s households and recreational activities and the probably quite different ways of speaking.
Oh Harry, I don’t have words for how excited I am right now. I’m so relieved that Teddy doesn’t have to go through the trouble that would’ve come with the other kind of creature inheritance I had in mind. Instead, he will grow into his wicked abilities and into all the mischief that will come with it, as I can fondly imagine. Merlin only knows what a child with such transformative abilities might come up with.
My Mind Healer urged me to keep an open mind, and I promise, I am attempting to. I’ve read – and reread – your words about shaking off your family’s prejudices and I’m listening to them. That’s why I’ve written here today. I don’t want everything that we had between us to be nothing but ash.
Narcissa hedged her bets, knowing that I’d shove the parchment up my sleeve rather than drop her deeper into the mire. Merlin, but her love is a force of nature! Be assured that I’ll always love you, for I wouldn’t want to feel the sharp end of her wand were I to do you any wrong. I think, in Narcissa’s perspective, every bit of risk she took was worth it, for we are now sanctified, and somehow more official in her perspective. I'm sorry that if Narcissa believes I'd only accept you alongside a big pile of gold, but we can't force her to change her opinion.
Oh, Draco. I felt my stomach flip, and bile rise in my throat as I read the title. ‘Spicy Shenanigans, Snaky Secrets and Slytherin Spitefulness! Draco Malfoy: His Seductive Truth! An Exposé by Rita Skeeter.
Narcissa must have noticed my reaction, for she gave me a smile. It was reserved, and small, but very real, nevertheless.
I desperately hope that this doesn’t scare you, my darling. I was so caught up in the conversation and in traditions I grew up with, that I didn’t even consider that you might not want to get bonded. Or that you’d at least want to wait to get bonded.
But I couldn’t have talked to you right then. I ought to have tried anyway, but… Fuck, give me a few minutes or hours. Just wanted you to know that I’ll be fine. I’m just in my dorm room. You needn’t worry.
But my eyes fell on the delicate skin of your throat then, looking so pale and soft under the dark tufts of your hair. I swear, I only wanted to press one little kiss to that precious part of you. But when I angled my face and kissed your nape, I felt the muscles in your stomach flex. Your whole body – shoulders, chest, belly – squared and went from unguarded to solid as you leaned back against me.
You rolled your eyes at that, not quite seized by the (hilarious) picture I had painted for you. Instead, you linked our arms closer as we walked. “I wouldn’t care, Draco. But it’s true that Knockturn isn’t the best place to be seen. Not with your probation.”
There are ten minutes left till dinnertime, Draco. Rather than begin the Potions reading that Slughorn has given us, and only manage a paragraph, I’m going to spend the rest of this period telling you about those Muggle things you mentioned yesterday. I consider it my duty. After all, I did rather steal your attention away during your last Muggle Studies lesson.
For that small, tiny moment we just existed, and I knew that was how it always would be. I watched as you sipped your tea, and marvelled at the comfortable set of your shoulders and how tranquil your expression was. Your eyes were so wide and shiny and your smile so ready and unschooled. It was a wonder to me. I’d do everything in my power to make you feel so relaxed, every single day of your life.
I hope that you haven’t read the “I understand that love cannot wait” line without any sarcasm. A betrothal, first and foremost, is a contract in her eyes. Don’t forget that whenever we talk about engagement, it’s like love and plans to bond are two different things. That too, is something I have a different opinion about. But you surely know that, mon ange.
Well. I didn't mean to make him so anxious, so I interrupted his rambling immediately. "No, just listen. If - and I mean
Harry, I feel so besotted. I want to rest in your arms for evermore, bury my face in your skin, and drown in your kisses. I can’t describe how glorious it feels to press my naked body against yours and to have all this skin touch.
You haven’t outed yourself to me – like I said before, I wasn't looking. I kept my eyes trained on the action in front of me – but you’ve told me something equally important. Like I suspected, you were sitting in the same stand as me, love. We were both there.
And – more recently but still only some months ago – I also learned about your childhood. You grew up believing you were a source of shame, that you deserve nothing but abuse. You were drawn into a world of magic that must’ve felt like a fairy tale through your young eyes. There’s hardly anything as liberating as flying a broom for you. You love to hear stories that take your mind off the mundane. You care for people, for almost everyone. You dream of a life that brings you some peace and quiet, a plate loaded with Treacle Tart rather than a problem to solve. You wish for someone to share your bed. Someone who holds you close and cites poetry to you and looks like he’s got his shit together. Is that Barnfield poem still charmed into your diary?
As for me, I had two tutors and a governess. Starting from five-or-so years old, I learned the basics with my governess and Mother, like reading, writing, maths and basic magic. Then I learnt about literature, history, astronomy, Latin, plants, beasts – everything of these in relation to wizarding kind, of course. Oh, and calligraphy, etiquette rules, elocution, ballroom dancing… playing the piano. I think I spent at least two hours a week learning about table manners, would you believe that?
I had better go, my new friend. It’s Quidditch tonight, Hufflepuff versus Ravenclaw and I cannot wait to let my hair down. I shall be standing in the stadium, cheering at the top of my voice.
But darling, I’ve just read this article again now. What if it’s all true? What if this is who I am? Some slutty Slytherin snake who makes advances with anyone who seems like a good catch? I did tell you about him – about Blaise. How I got on my knees for him without a second thought. How flirtatious I got when he fumbled with my tie and how I climbed into his lap after a party. It’s all bloody true.
My heart clenched as your tongue met mine. Your lips were supple and yielding, persuasive and delicious, and – I swear – that I wanted nothing more than that. All I had planned for was to hold you. I cupped your face with my hand and the two of us drew ever closer. Your body was warm, Draco, so brilliantly warm and I felt all the blood rushing to my groin.
She said that she’d been listening to her siblings and to a couple of our mutual friends. She thought she’d been hasty. Not given me enough of a chance to get over the war, and the worst days of my life
Instead, your grey eyes met mine, so full of love, and defiant pride. You cupped my soft cock, and told me that, “before we return to our bed chamber tonight, I want you to fuck me again.” We haven’t had that pleasure yet; though you keep giving me sensual, dark-eyed glances over the top of your book. I know it isn’t far from your mind. I find I’m already growing hard at the idea of pushing inside you once again.
Merlin, but your kiss was something special, so filled with longing and heat and want. Then we pulled apart with the tiniest of moans – I’d have kissed you for the rest of time had you only have let me – and you gave me the sexiest smirk, half-poised and half-vulnerable.
I love you. When I saw you on that bed, shifting ever so slightly, looking up into my face like you weren’t sure what I’d think of you… But then I felt the stress flow away, and you eased into my touch. While you gave me the time to take in the sight, that was all I could think about. I love every inch of you. I have never felt anything like that in my life. I could’ve spent hours just tracing every muscle, bone, and curve I could find on your body. Every scar that shows what you’ve been through and what you’ve accomplished while we are still so young.
Transfiguration. Well, well, well. Remember the day you wouldn’t tell me whether you took Transfiguration or not? I’m not telling you whether we’re in the same class now or if I’m in the group on Wednesdays. That’s what you get.
Did Ron and Hemione come up already? Before I left for McGonagall’s Floo, they told me they’d look after you. Get ‘Mione started on the subject of getting back at Rita Skeeter. It’s her very favourite subject in the world.
I’ve asked a couple of the professors whether you were poorly, but they all said that it wasn’t their business to be talking about your private matters. I’m getting bloody worried. I know you’re still here at Hogwarts because I can see your name on my dad’s map.
What you said about Mother meant so much to me. I’m sure you’d think her a cold, vain woman at first, and I honestly couldn’t hold it against you. Perhaps your friends would’ve been pulled into bone-crushing hugs after not seeing their mothers for such a long period of time, but that’s not how we work. You show me yet again how open-minded, sympathetic, and insightful you are, my dear love, by seeing beyond the tension I described.
I truly think, being so lonely at the beginning of this school year was good for me. After being in custody for the whole summer, even after all the trials – I see the chance that I could still have fallen into old habits, if I had had Greg, Pans, Theo and Blaise with me, the old clique. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t want to blame them. But overcoming some of my thought patterns would have been difficult without this change of surroundings. Especially here at Hogwarts.
But I quite liked what you said then: that you only ever think about your parents’ death days, but that you’d rather start to celebrate their birthdays instead, even if just a little. I think that’s a nice thing to do. And you know me and numbers. Both your parents’ birthdays are forever engraved in my cerebral cortex from now until forever. I won’t fail to remind you of the birthdays of my in-laws, and you will come up with fun little things to do to remember them.
You’re right: I’m getting off topic again. In my defence, love, you did smile at the mention of those badges.
I’d know that you’re watching. I wouldn’t give it away, but I’d know that you were watching, and I’d raise my arms to wash my hair, I’d spread soap over my shoulder and my chest, and all you could do is follow with your eyes as the foam slowly runs down my body.
With that, he snatched the forms from me, and gave them a tap with his wand. They flew into the air, glowed a brilliant red, and with a flash of magic they vanished.
I’ve been thinking about naming your business as well, and this is what I reckon. I don’t think that we should give the business our names, and that isn’t because I’m ashamed, or because I don’t want our names linked. After all, I’m going to bond with you and link our names forever. I don’t care what the
It’s Friday and our ever-bickering favourite couple will occupy the Room tonight. Which brings me to that date in the Astronomy tower we’ve been discussing for weeks now without ever getting to actually do it. Bring nothing except your enticing self, I have everything sorted for a lovely tryst. And don’t you dare wank! No wanking all day long, Potter, because I want you hot and bothered tonight.
“Harry.” Remus’ sharp voice cuts in as he enters, papers clenched in his hand. “That’s enough. It’s no one’s fault. Draco and Sirius are back with us, this isn’t the time to start attacking each other for helping them. If he hadn’t used your magic, they would still be dead.”
He doesn’t want to be some sort of figurehead for those stupid ideas. He doesn’t want people to think he meant to do it. He hates the admiring glances, hates the pats on his back and the small notes they pass him. It’s only been two days since Draco died, and yet he feels like he’s going insane with all of the attention, getting whiplash from the extremes of good and bad.
Then he realises his father is still watching him, and a jolt of panic shoots through him. He never told his father he was gay. He’s the only heir of the Malfoy household, the only one that can carry on their bloodline. He can’t be gay. Not only that, but there would be no way he would have told his father he was with Harry Potter, the Slayer of the Dark Lord, the one who had won the war and ultimately destroyed their chances of a better life.
Hermione taps her foot, listening to the shuffling inside the room. She should start bringing a book to read here, honestly. Twenty minutes is far too much time wasted.
After Sirius had vanished into the Veil, Grimmauld Place had been left to Harry as his godson. He hated every inch of it. Every strange musk smelled like Sirius, every screeching portrait sounded like Bellatrix yelling, every whispering curtain reminded him of the Veil. It was all too painful for him.
He smiles gently at her, heart swelling at her praise. It feels like a lifetime ago that he lay in the Manor, unable to move or eat, rotting away in his thoughts.
“Oh really?” This time the High and Mighty Lord of Lions steps in. “That’s not what Parkinson’s wand is telling us.”
Harry clears his throat. “It was just after you’d… uhm, died… and he told me I should stop using magic to try and make you… happy? I’ve been thinking about it, and how I can’t really do much magic at the moment, and I thought that I might stop using magic for a while, once this year is over. I’ve… forgotten what it feels like to be without magic, how I actually thought about things instead of just doing them. When you have magic, it feels like no matter what you do, you can just fix it with magic. Break a vase? You just cast repairo. You know what I’m saying?”
(Blank stare, hissed words, hate and loathing slamming the magic down onto his arm, blood and pain rearing their ugly heads, the shard of mirror slicing and slicing, wand crushed under the anger of his self-mutilation-)
“However,” Lucius continues, “they won’t be counting on your agility and your smarts. You will study hard, Draco, and you’ll think more about what you do. When you’re older, you won’t break your arm going that high. But it will take time and hard work. You will be the best, so you need to think about what you do. You can’t do silly things like fly higher than you’re supposed to.”
But Harry can’t see the future, so he can’t be certain. He never thought he’d end up with Draco, after all.
Hermione smiles, jumping up and helping him to his feet. “I should warn you, they’re having a party down there. Not too many people, only eighth years and a few seventh years, but it will be a little loud.”
“A painter maker, sir.” The house elf finishes for him. “Did Master Draco not know he was one, sir?”
It’s unrecognisable. Fairy lights dance around in the air, blue and gold and silver, and the floor is covered in soft multicoloured rugs. Every exposed piece of metal has been charmed a different colour, and strings of dyed wool link together and hang from above. It’s a mad mix of clashing visuals, but Draco loves it, because it overwhelms every bad memory that had tainted this tower.
Draco stares at him. Blaise drops his gaze, uncomfortable, and stands. “I’d better get changed. We’ll be arriving soon.”
“But I can’t. If things were different, maybe I could have. But I can’t, because I’m ashamed of a lot of things I’ve done over our time together.”
“Please don’t, Harry. I think I might actually cry if you do whatever that was supposed to be again!” Ron mumbles, face firmly buried in his hands.
“Yes.” Hermione nods fervently, turning back to her work. “Pansy is right. Remus, you and McGonagall can get through to them, I know it. The rest of us can just leave it up to them. Come on, you two, there’s some wrapping paper you can be working with…”
“Narcissa, I can talk to the ministry for you.” He blurts out, spinning on his heel right in the doorway. “I can try to get you out of here. Grimmauld Place belongs to me now, and I’m sure Remus would like some help renovating it, since you would know all about the heirlooms, and it might be good for you. You can bring all of your house elves. There has to be enough space.”
Her light hair flicks over her shoulder as she gazes past him. “I can’t remember. Perhaps a Sroating told me in my dreams…Anyway, Ginny, you said you wanted to join the Gryffindor Quidditch team again?”
“Or they could be looking for a reason to lock him up.” Hermione adds. “People will be angry that they put dementors near their children for an entire year to stop a criminal who, as it turns out, isn’t actually a criminal. There was widespread panic when he escaped Azkaban, and finding out it was all for nothing - most people won’t be impressed. If they lock him up now, they can say they were right all along.”
Then it’s Draco’s turn. He swallows, fingers shaking as he grips the bottom of the lectern, reading over the words on the page. This is it. This is what he’s been working towards for the past few months. He clears his throat, opens his mouth-
Albiet when drunk, but the best plans are made when drunk! Tbh I have no idea, I've never been drunk before. Aaanyway I'm straying off topic. Any ideas for future chapters, please say!
“Yeah, right, cause you’re the ones who should be annoyed!” The weasel growls sarcastically as he passes them, freckles lost in the furious scowl across his face.
There’s a brief silence. Narcissa’s fingernails tap against the skin of the cup, harsh and loud in the quiet. A clock, somewhere in the house, ticks.
“It’s for your own good.” Lucius said coldly, in the Spring before Draco’s 21st birthday. “You have a responsibility to the kingdom. You need to make sure you’re ready, and you have a partner to see you through it.” Draco could not believe what he was hearing. “But Father, I am still young, and I have you to rely on as well.” Lucius finally dropped his posture and held Draco’s hands. It was the first time he had ever shown any emotion, since Narcissa’s death. “I loved your mother more than life itself. She was my strength, and I would like to believe that I was hers as well. I want you to have the same. I will not live forever, and I cannot always be around, and you need to make sure you will have an heir, for the good of our Kingdom.”
Not like me. Draco added to himself. He hated seeing Potter like this, all self-deprecating and carrying the weight of his guilt. He knew that look, he’d seen it at the end of Fifth year when he heard news of his cousin’s death, and again in Sixth year, when his mentor’s body fell off the Astronomy tower. “Whatever Malfoy. Just.. Just let it go. I’m taking responsibility for Professor Snape since he doesn’t have any other family to take care of it.” And there was at least a tiny spark of that old defiance in Harry’s eyes, that made Draco’s heart swell inexplicably, beating with admiration and awe at this boy, who had lost so much but still found it in his heart to give and give. Draco felt the urge to take his hand and squeeze it, telling him that he doesn’t have to fight for this.
Harry kept quiet, as he noticed that Malfoy was deep in thought. He knew the blonde man’s expressions as well as the back of his hand, after so many years of staring down at each other across their house tables. How could Harry not know, when he felt the air sucked from his lungs as he stared down at those stormy gray eyes? After that night in the bathroom in sixth year, he could not think of Draco Malfoy without seeing the swirling hurricane in those eyes, full of fear and anxiety and helplessness, followed by pain and anger and finally with desperation as his chest was opened up by Harry’s carelessly thrown curse. He had never forgiven himself for being the cause of those once brilliant eyes slowly losing their light. He had never been more grateful for Snape, for saving Draco’s life that day, and Harry promised himself he would do anything to keep that spark Draco’s eyes alive.
“I didn’t know… I could have…” Harry stammered. “No Mr. Potter, you could not have done anything aside from what you already did. You took down the most feared dark wizard of the last 20 years. No one should expect more from you that that.” There were a few minutes of silence as Poppy started spreading salve on Harry’s remaining bruises. “This one will be permanent.” She said, pointing to the circular burn on Harry’s chest, the mark of the locket. “I know, it was made by the darkest of dark magic.” Harry whispered. Poppy looked like she wanted to ask more about it, so Harry tried to change the topic. “Who are those?” He whispered. “Professor Snape’s body was found in the Shrieking Shack, but no one has come to claim him yet. And.. Professor Lupin and Auror Tonks as well.” Poppy whispered back.
“You heard that too, didn’t you?” Lavender whispered. “He’s a killer.” A long silence followed. “But I still admire him. He’s been my only companion these past 2 days. My parents are gone, and my brother’s an Auror, chasing down the remaining death eaters and preparing for trials. He asked me if I wanted to go to St Mungo’s, but I realized that Malfoy will be alone here if I left. I’m grateful for him because he saved me. He’s hurting Harry. He’s always looked to his parents for guidance, but they led him wrong. It wasn’t his fault, and I won’t let you send him to Azkaban.” Harry was surprised at Lavender’s statement. “I’m a killer too. It’s part of being in the war. It was kill or be killed. I don’t blame him, and I’ll do all in my power to keep him away from Azkaban.” Harry whispered back.
Draco recalled, as vividly as if it were just yesterday, that night at the Manor, during Easter break. The Snatcher brought Potter in, and Draco felt the world stop in its tracks. Just that morning, he was cleaning up another of Greyback’s messes. There was no uncertainty there – it truly was Potter, even if his face was all swollen and messed up. Those eyes, those jewels that shone with a fire of defiance, even as Aunt Bella dragged the boy by his hair and shove his face in front of Draco. “Well?” Aunt Bella had whispered in her awful sickeningly sweet voice. “Is it him?” Draco knew very well that it was him, because who else could make Draco’s heart race with just a gaze from those emerald eyes, and who else could both make Draco feel both suffocated and like breathing fresh air for the first time?
The infirmary was almost empty except for 4 beds, two of which had the curtains shut. “Madame Pomfrey?” Harry called out. “I’ll be out shortly!” Came the response. Poppy bustled in carrying multicolored potions vials in a tray. “How are you feeling now Mr. Potter? I had your elf feed you your potions while you were sleeping. I wanted to have you transferred here, but Minvera did not want to wake you. Are you hungry?” She rambled on as she cast diagnostics on her two patients. “I’m feeling better now Ma’am. I just ate before coming down, and I had a small breakfast of soup before I went to bed this morning.”. Poppy looked a Harry as if he just made a joke. “Mr. Potter,” she said gently. “You had your soup three days ago, and I’ve been asking Kreacher to feed you nutrient potions and some restoratives to help your body recover. You had multiple broken bones, bruises, and internal bleeding, and even some burns!”. Harry was shocked. “No one woke me up? You should have woken me up! I needed to be there! I needed to see…”
It did not take long for Lily to regret her decision. Darlene and Daphne were both lazy, and spent their time playing games instead of helping with the farm chores. Petunia did not have the heart to discipline her girls, and instead indulged by buying them the latest fashions in dresses and shoes, and all sorts of useless trinkets. She had a shouting match with Lily regarding the fact that they shouldn’t be spending their money on such trivial things, but Petunia answered that the Potters had old money and could afford it. Lily was frustrated, and her only comfort came when she sat beside Harry’s bed at night, reading to him and telling him stories of how kindness will always triumph over evil. She also started teaching him the household finances and telling him how, when he turns 21, he will be Lord of House Potter, and represent their family in the Assembly of Lords.
Harry’s heart was hammering fast, and he forced himself to relax as he picked up the Prince’s soiled cloak. He had admired the gorgeous Prince from his portraits for so long, with his beautiful blond hair and intense stormy eyes, and He could not believe that he actually met him. He breathed in the scent of forest, mint, and lavender, before he headed to the river to find the horse and to wash the cloak. ‘I certainly missed my chance to make a good impression’, Harry thought to himself, as he glimpsed his reflection in the smooth waters of the riverbank. His hair was a mess, his face was darkened with soot in places, and streaked with tear tracks. His green eyes were rimmed with red, and had dark purple bags underneath. He knew he looked like this even before his encounter with the prince. He sighed deeply as he hung up the now cleaned cloak, and prepared the horses for the carriage.
Nine or ten of us fell into a rough circle. “Truth or dare,” suggested Susan and though a few people grumbled, it seemed as good a game as any. Seamus passed the bottle around, and I sealed my lips around it, taking a deep swallow as Hermione set her wand spinning in a circle.
There’s another thing that surprises me. It’s still so surreal that I am invited along to Weasley’s and Granger’s engagement announcement. For some reason, that unhelpfully reminded me of our past, love. You noticed that I’ve been quiet yesterday. If there’s a reason other than that I very much enjoyed listening to everyone, that’s possibly why.
Draco Malfoy, you have the tiniest pair of lines beside your eyes. When you smile – one of your real smiles, not one of those polite arrange-your-face-appropriately numbers that you use when the professors ask you a question in class – then those lines deepen.
I genuinely have no idea how Mother imagined this would go, but I think she was equally scandalised and charmed, and I loved the expressions on both of your faces. If you ask me, this little gesture would have won her over if she hadn’t already sort of accepted that we are undoubtedly in love.
Oh, love. You looked at me with such anguish. “You’ve already done so much,” you murmured, your words as light and as diaphanous as feathers. “Loved me. Given me a home and a future, and a life that I love. You shouldn’t have to sit here, and listen to this Mulvaney talk about the war, and the gruesome details of my probation! Sometimes it’s hard to believe that this is my life. Sometimes I think I’m waiting for the other broomstick to drop.”
Sweet Circe, I just copied a poem down in our diary. I’m kind of embarrassed, but I’ll totally call you an ignorant, illiterate prat in case you make fun of me.
Of course, now you’ve done it once, you’ve made a precedent. I’m going to be wanting snogs in every single one of our lessons from hereon, please. I’ll admit, you took me by surprise, especially as I didn’t see you at breakfast, like I was very much hoping I might. Then when I saw you sat at your potions table you looked the very image of a studious and tidy scholar, with your bound folder of neatly annotated notes and your pristine copy of Advanced Potion Making open wide across your desk.
Now, I’m rather wise to my best-friend – and normally I’d have gotten him to spill all the gossip simply by threatening to tell ‘Mione that he, George and Oliver Wood snuck off watch the Apples versus the Harpies during the Christmas hols, while Ron was supposed to be visiting her parents – but today I decided that a more subtle approach was necessary.
I’m blushing now, thinking of the throaty noises that I couldn’t help making with each thrust of your hand. Warmth quickly began to build as you wrapped your hands around my prick, and I felt whole-body shockwaves roll through me as I tensed and orgasmed with your name on my lips, wetting your hands and my belly with my climax.
When we got inside the RofR, we were still laughing about escaping Peeves so narrowly. But Circe, when we kissed and started to undress each other, the amusement was replaced with such earnestness. You kissed me ever so slowly, perhaps because we finally had time. I think, once we saw the bed, the settee, and the fireplace, we knew that we’d totally stay the entire night.
But I digress. Hermione. She was a bit cross, wasn’t she? Anyways, she still inquired after the problem after you’ve left, asking what exactly the clauses on contacting others said. “And be quick about it. I’m already five minutes late for my planned revision session.”
The two of us left the classroom, and I was careful not to look you in the eye. I knew that if I saw you smirking then the jig would be up. Seamus was entirely mystified by proceedings and couldn’t quite believe that I’d been so careless.
The two of us sat together, our limbs entangled and our breath whiskey sweet as the wand’s pointed end landed facing Ron. The whole lot of us claimed foul, of course: how likely was it that it had landed on Hemione’s boyfriend? She only gave an enigmatic smile, however, and refused to answer our friendly jeers.
We would have lain there, my darling, sticky and sated, had only time been on our side. It wasn’t to be, though. The Hogwarts Express was leaving at twelve, and we both needed to be on it.
And then you gave her the flower bouquet! She didn’t say much to that but believe me when I say that she loved it. If you weren’t quipping about wanting to be the perfect son-in-law, let me reassure you that you are a prime specimen. The beginning of that Easter Sunday couldn’t have been any better.
I’ve told you before, haven’t I, that he hates change and things not coming out the way that he expects. He’ll come around to Hermione being busy for a year, because he does truly love her. I only hope he isn’t too much of a prat in the process.
GBygone are the times of gallantry now that my name is irrevocably linked to that of my betrothed! Over are the days of bliss now that my magic is to be perdurably interwoven with this arcane abode we call our home!
I remember how bloody relieved I was when I asked you whether we could be open about our recent relationship, and you said yes. The mere idea of sitting with you, walking next to you, talking to friends, and feigning being naught but mates – it would have shattered me into pieces. And the jealousy, Merlin… Students look at you so differently, love, ever since we’ve kissed the first few times in public. Of course, some are still ogling you, but they do it differently. They know you’re mine.
Oh Draco, you are such a thoroughly good person. I have to confess, actually, that all this talk about Hermione’s law course, and me potentially studying at St. Mungo’s… You don’t have regrets, do you? I mean, working from Grimmauld Place, brewing potions; you’ll be amazing at it, the best in London, but you’re such a powerful wizard. You could do so much more though. In another life you could have been Minister for Magic.
You must have felt my own erection, for you gave me the craftiest of smirks and then you rolled your hips against my own. Goodness. I’ve never felt anything like it in my life. The firmness of you, love, and how big and weighty your prick was for me. If I hadn’t have known how queer I was before today, then the feel of your prick against mine would have been the deciding factor.
But the best part of the room are the French doors that open to a large balcony, fenced with delicate black iron-wrought balustrades. It overlooks a Wizarding park nearby with an open-air theatre, various botanical gardens, and even a few enclosures with magical beasts.
Muggle football? I couldn’t believe you had no idea that Muggles love sports as much as wixen. They do, and they’re every bit as loyal and passionate. One day I’ll take you to a match if you fancy it. The crowds can get a bit boisterous but that’d be okay. You’re a Wiltshire lad so let me think… Salisbury City, I reckon. They’re your local team, Draco.
Merlin, but it was such a thrill to tease the ticklish spots at the back of your knees, and lick into the dips of your pubic bone. I found all of the places that made you tremble and grasp, and you did the same. The delicate spot where your neck and shoulder meet that had you crying out in laughter. That little patch of skin on your inner thigh that I only needed to ghost my lips over to get your cock to stand to attention.
The same thing happened, but I watched longer this time. And the same light that I saw in the beginning reappeared after each of those memories, only that I understood that it was the light incorporated into your Patronus, darling. I watched your magnificent stag dashing across a lake towards so many Dementors. Towards your Godfather, Hermione, and also your own self. I wouldn’t have understood, if you hadn’t explained the whole ordeal afterwards. The Time Turner and how you first thought that it would be your dad who comes to your help.
But anyway. You took a few steps back and told me to take a moment to pull the memory into my awareness again. “You have to feel it, it’s very intuitive magic,” you explained, raising your hand to your chest for emphasis. “It’s not so much about the correct pronunciation or even the correct wand movements, like is so often the case with charms. “You have to feel the emotion alongside your magic on a visceral level.”
“Kinky,” I only commented, holding my hand out for you to squeeze some of the lube into my open palm.
Quite honestly, I must have looked a sight, and I pushed my breakfast away, knowing that I wouldn’t be able to eat another bite. I knew, right there and then, that I’d rather have faced a dozen Horntails in single combat than get up on a podium and speak aloud.
Okay, that got more of a rise out of him than I had anticipated. “You’re bloody on, Malfoy,” he snarled and practically dragged me up to the Gryffindor common room. Only a few other seventh- and eighth-years were lounging about; Ginny was writing an essay by the fireplace.
A true French omelette isn’t filled though. It’s just plain and very creamy. Topped with some chives at most. It’s just eggs and some salt as far as I’m aware, the same ingredients as scrambled eggs. It’s all about the technique – that’s what Pansy’s mum said when I stayed at hers once, and we had omelettes for breakfast. But I wouldn’t know, love. Not a first clue.
I was positively wheezing when you mentioned how I’m courting new money. I’m sure, only five-or-so years ago, Mother would have been appalled! Tremendously appalled! And me too! Salazar, how things change. I must hope that you have no plans on really learning about all the courteous small talk nonsense and suchlike. At least not with the intent to follow these guidelines all too precisely. I’d rather you not veneer your candour. It’s one of the things I admire the most about you, mon beau.
I’m reminded of the fling with Blaise here. Still my only experience bar you, Harry. I had so many expectations and presumed what to do, what not to do, what he liked, what he wouldn’t like – you get the idea – instead of communicating anything.
I’m ready to leave, I think, even though Hogwarts will always occupy a special place in my soul. After all, it was the only home that I knew for so many years, and it gave me everything. But I know now that it is time to move on. A couple more months of this unrelenting work, and then our education will be complete. We’ll have our N.E.W.T. exams, and then we can say goodbye to this castle and begin the rest of our lives.
journo, trying to make a Galleon out of you both. I’m your mate! You don’t need to jump down my throat.” He paused, seemingly to gather his thoughts “I’m just trying to understand, is all. How you knew that it was real… And not just- you know… experimentation. Thing is,” he continued, looking sheepish, “and please, don’t you and Draco tell a soul this, but Dean and I messed about a bit… fifth and sixth year. Kissing mostly. A few cuddles. Sometimes we even shared a bed.” He sighed and looked pensive. “We never dared do anything sexy, and we didn’t know anywhere else to go… And I know you and Ron and the other lads noticed, but you were always good enough not to say anything.”
In that moment, Draco, all that mattered was the warmth of your skin and the way that our arms were tangled around each other’s waists. You looked so relaxed, love, your head squashed against the pillow, more relaxed than you ever do in the daytime. The sharp curves of your jaw, and the neat shape of your eyebrows, and your long, dark eyelashes fluttering on your cheeks. I felt so happy, and if I couldn’t have that with you, every day, then I know I’d be lonely.
So you and Ron had the Parvati twins. Hermione was with Krum. Wasn’t Chang with Cedric Diggory? Who died at the end of this fucking year when the- when You-Know-Who came back? And then in fifth year your little green arse dated a cool Seeker girl who was one year above you?
In moments the pair of us were back to being teenage rivals, inflamed and incensed by each other’s brilliance; both of us wanting nothing more than to emerge triumphant over the other. All niceties were thrown aside as we both dove for one of the (slightly) better broomsticks and wrestled them into the air.
It’s the same look I’ve seen countless times. When you were fighting one of the dragons you mentioned, for example. I have also seen this look in your eyes on countless occasions on school corridors. On the Pitch. I felt it burn into my skin in sixth year. In the Manor in late March. In the Room of Hidden Things eight months ago. I’ve seen it the same day again when you defeated You-Know-Who.
And admit it, Draco. Getting outside after curfew was worth all every minute of sneaking around and hiding in alcoves, wasn’t it? Setting those warming spells on each other and making our way over the desolate grounds to the Pitch was more fun than I’ve had in ages.
Darling, I was insecure and nervous, shocked even from my uncontrolled movement. The more of a surprise it was for me when the little noise you made resulted in a rather urgent, “Draco, move.”
“Oh yes! Listen to yourself. Preaching patience and acceptance! You’re nothing but a green, naïve schoolboy! You and Draco are both as bad as one another. Circe. If only the pair of you were correct.” Some of the heat left Narcissa’s voice, and I saw the smallest slump of her shoulders. “There is nothing, nothing that I want more than my son’s happiness but how can that arrive at your side, Harry Potter? You're the most famous wizard in England. Perhaps even the world.” Some unnameable emotion crossed her features. “Draco, a prideful, foolish boy, let the love he held for Lucius lead him down a dark path. The Dark Mark he wears on his arm can never be reversed, and his reputation never be salvaged. All I dearly wish, with whatever years I have left on this Earth, is to protect my son from further maltreatment! My only wish is for him to be safe. I failed to protect him from Lucius, but I’ll be damned if I cannot protect him from you.”
Just now when I relished your beautiful words, I was thinking back to what I used to think of you years ago. And never would I have thought you such a sensitive, considerate friend, perceptive thinker, and poetic writer. I’m so thankful for this bloody diary – without it, I’m not sure whether we’d ever gotten to know each other like we have, Harry.
Darling, I’m sorry that I chuckled at that doubtful, curious look you gave me. You shoved at me and pushed me back, pinning me down on the seat of the settee in a quick motion. Of course, only because I let you, and not because you move darn quickly and confidently, no.
Thank you for this evening. I really, really enjoyed it and you really weren’t a dreadful dialogue partner, not one little bit.
You explained to a very eager witch that your kisses don’t bring luck upon anyone, to which I chimed in that I could confirm that first-hand, earning a startled gasp from the witch and a crafty smirk from you. But when you turned back to me, you groaned, “Gods, when will this be over,” and I wasn’t sure whether you meant for the day or in general. Because I can assure you that it will be like that for the rest of your life. Or at least for a good few years.
Okay, listen. This is very much first year Arithmancy stuff and on the side of the subject that heavily leans into Divination. But who am I to argue with the certainty of numerology? We’re a perfect match and no, I don’t care that this sounds like one of these relationship tests as seen in Witch Weekly.
I think the place that I’m most interested in one day visiting is Italy. That's my secret dream. My friend – the nosy one we’ve talked about – has told me that there is graffiti carved into the Colosseum in Rome which shows magical folk lived there, thousands of years ago. I think I’d really like to see that. History of Magic was another of those subjects that I coasted in, barely listening to Binns’ translucent teaching. I was always too busy whispering to the mate I sat with and doodling in his textbook. Maybe you’re amused at me, while you read this. Do I sound gauche? Maybe you’ve already been to Italy and seen all the famous sights.
I hate to tell you this – I feel like betraying both of you by saying it – but be careful around her. You first-hand witnessed how she can be. If in doubt, rather say nothing at all than too much. Circe, I wish I could have given you a manual for talking to her, like the ones Muggles have for their electronic appliances.
Oh, love. What can I say that adequately describes the next hours? I suppose I hadn't ever really understood the limits of time the pair of us have suffered whilst we remained at Hogwarts. How each of our orgasms was a hurried thing, snatched whenever we had the opportunity.
I’ve been keeping you all to myself, love, and as far as she knew I was still in a relationship with my ex. It all took a little bit of explaining, but she seemed to accept my perspective after I’d described exactly how happy you’d made me. I was close to showing her the quill that you’d given me, but in the end I demurred.
I could see, too, that all of your worries fell quickly away, and that you couldn’t help but warm to her. The feeling was definitely mutual, too. Andi kept looking at you, drinking you in like you were something lost that had been returned, miraculously, to her side. It makes me hopeful, Draco, that once the two sisters are reunited at our bonding, they’ll find their peace with one another.
A bigger part of me sat very still, wracked with nerves, and stared out at the match with unseeing eyes. I wanted to know who you were, so very badly but I couldn’t expose myself in front of everybody that we know. I’m assured by my mates that the game was excellent – that the Lions were on top form – and I cheered and yelled at all the right moments, but I couldn’t follow a minute of the game.
The Mind Healer gave me an encouraging smile. “I can see that you’ve been under a tremendous level of stress,” he replied, carefully placing the parchment and quill on McGonagall’s desk beside him. “And truly, if it’d been me in the same position, I don't doubt that I’d be experiencing symptoms very much different to your own.” Folding his arms, the Mind Healer looked thoughtful. “Can you remember, Harry, what we talked about the last time we were together? I recall that it made you much more emboldened, and you left looking cheerful.”
As for the other rituals – I have seen a bunch of different things. Many purebloods bond into foreign families instead of British ones, trying to avoid marrying each other’s cousins until their family tree is a circle. In Muggle biology they can somehow explain this with a lack of variety of genes or some mumbo-jumbo like that. Anyhow, each bonding ceremony definitely had one or the other imported tradition.
I wasn’t sure whether you’d get back to me at the last moment having received a late invite to the party. I know that you’ve been mingling with your cousin recently.
Please ensure that your fiancé is fully prepared to meet Teddy with an open heart full of love, though if you have chosen him, I have no doubt that Draco Malfoy has a temperament that is free of old-fashioned prejudices.
Luckily for Draco, Madam Pomfrey and Professor McGonagall chose that exact moment to enter the infirmary, before he did anything that would have him confined to the mental ward. “Ah, good, you’re up Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy, Ms. Brown. So, Poppy has cleared all three of you for release. Ms. Brown, I have already contacted your brother, and he’s picking you up at my office. As for you Mr. Malfoy, I can extend your stay for maybe two more days, but after that we won’t be able to make a believable excuse anymore, as you don’t have any permanent damage that warrants longer than a week’s rest. I can help you with any arrangements you need to make before we release you to the Aurors.” “What? No way, you can’t let them take him!” Harry interrupted, surprising all the occupants of the infirmary, including himself. “Sorry, but we can’t let the Aurors take Malfoy. He hasn’t done anything wrong, he had no choice in taking the mark and in following Voldemort.” “I understand Mr. Potter, and I have done as much as I could to keep him here as long as possible to avoid the holding cells. Do not worry too much, Kingsley is a much better Minister than Fudge and will definitely ensure fair trials for all. I’m sure Mr. Malfoy will be fine.”
Harry stood, head still bowed, and passed a bucket of water and a clean cloth for the prince to clean up. He waited in silence. “Here, take this. As payment for my borrowing your horse. I’ll return him before sunset. Just, find my horse along the river path, he broke a shoe and I didn’t want to hurt him. Let him into your stable and get him farrier, so I can take him back with me when I return.” “You are too kind your majesty, Thank you. And I’m sorry again, for calling you names and getting you all dirty, here, you can have my cloak, and I’ll have yours cleaned and ready when you come back to return Padfoot.” “I’ll see you later then.” And with that, Draco left, confused from the morning’s events, and he savored the scent of firewood, peaches, and an earthy musk, from the boy’s cloak.
Draco was quiet for a while, relishing the first real interaction he had with his father since the past four years. “I understand Father. I want what you had with Mother, but I am afraid I cannot have that for myself. I realized some time ago that I am gay Father. I do not know how I can find my true love and keep my responsibility. I do not want to disappoint you, so I find I must let go of that dream.” “Oh my child. Yes, your mother and I knew you were gay. She had even contacted a distant cousin to help her create potions that would allow you to have children of you and your partner’s blood, but I had not heard back from him. You should ask your tutor, Lupin. He knew the potioneer personally, and he can get you in touch.”
Draco was surprised, as he thought he had hidden his inclinations from his family. Lucius chuckled, “Oh you thought you were so clever, but you mother always caught the way you stared at the captain of the guard whenever they held their exercises in the courtyard. We did not mind, as long as you honor your responsibility and provide an heir to the throne. That is why she contacted Lupin’s friend.” “It matters not father, I have not met anyone who has piqued my interest. The courtiers the nobles, and the knights here, they don’t have what I want. I can’t even tell what I really want, but I’m sure I’ll know it when I see it.” “Then I suggest you get out of the castle and visit the village. While you are at it, find the potioneer to check if they were ever able to create that potion Narcissa requested.” “Thank you Father.” With that Draco left, his heart lighter than it had ever been, not knowing in just a few days, his fate would be changed forever.
“Kreacher!” Harry called, as he dropped his head on the pillow of his old four-poster bed. “Master Harry is here!” Kreacher bobbed his head, and Harry noticed he had a great gash at his left temple. “Are you alright Kreacher? You’re wounded! Do you have potions or something you can take for that?” Harry said, as he sat back up and reached for Kreacher’s head. “Oh Kreacher thanks Master for coming back. Master is truly a great wizard, to come back from where none has ever returned! A most powerful wizard for defeating He Who Must Not Be Named, and Most noble defender of the house elves! Worried for Kreacher though master looks worse!” Harry chuckled and felt pain in his ribs. “Yeah, you’re right Kreacher, I probably do look worse than you. Can I trouble you for a bowl of soup and a glass of pumpkin juice? I am quite tired and I don’t think I can face anyone else right now.” Kreacher nodded. “Right away Master,” and left with a crack.
“You needed to be resting and nothing more.” The stern voice of Professor McGonagall made Harry shut up for a bit. “Mr. Potter, you have done so much these past few days, few months actually, and no one is expecting you to keep going on as if it had not affected you. Please forgive me for making the decision for you, but I felt that you needed to be away from all the grief, since you already have so much to grieve yourself without the burden of others’ pain.”
Let me start with some basics for formal etiquette at the table. Once you’re seated, you will take the napkin and place it in your lap. Fold it once and let the open side of it face your body. This allows you to pick it up, clean your mouth, and put it back down without showing the person seated next to you any ungainly stains on the napkin.
So, yes, I was a little delayed, but it didn’t matter. You and Luna have obviously become very fast friends and were already chatting amiably when I got there. Not wanting to cut in, I listened for a moment, and I was ecstatic to hear you talking about Grimmauld Place. “There’s a lot that needs updating,” you said, giving me the most handsome quirk of a smile when you saw me, “the interiors are frightfully dark and grim, and the number of skulls used by Walburga for interior design needs to be seen to be believed, but it’s got so much potential, Lulu! All we’d have to do is enchant the walls a less austere shade. You really must visit and bring your father too.”
In the beginning, with every wave of pleasure that coiled through me, I felt my arse and my thigh tense without having much control over it. But your eyes were studying my face and my every minute move so intently, that you were perfectly aware of that. Your movements were slow and cautious, your loving words low, comforting hums.
I’ve read that Malfoy’s harsh restrictions are due to last for many years, and that he had to make a stark choice between here or Azkaban. Quite honestly, I feel a degree of pity for the bloke. Who is to say that we wouldn’t have made the same choices as he did, had our situations been reversed?
Most of the time, you and I, we spend our days in a miasma of contentment. Our intimate relationship has led us both to the heights of pleasure, we talk constantly about every subject under the sun, and the rest of the time we are studying or larking about with our friends.
A hand rests on his shoulder, making him jump and fumble for his wand. It instantly draws away, the figure crouching beside him. He can’t think, can’t look, can’t breathe. He doesn’t know what to do.
He flinches, the arms around him warm and unnatural. He hates it, he wants the man far away from him, but he can’t tell him. He can’t say one single thing, so he dumps his head on the man’s shoulder and nods weakly. Another few seconds like this won’t kill him, really.
“I understand, but the board of governors and the ministry won’t.” Flitwick frowns, sitting on his stack. “I’ll talk to McGonagall about it. For now, I’d like one of you to bring Mr Malfoy this work.” He pulls out his wand again, flicking it and levitating a stack of paper over to Harry. “I’m sure Miss Granger will be able to explain it.”
“You are an asshole, and a dickhead, and a stupid murdering scumbag, but I’ll help you.” Pansy huffs, throwing a piece of paper at him. “My family funds some of the Unspeakables’ experiments. Call that number, tell them you’re a Parkinson, and they might let you in. Don’t you dare say who you really are. I don’t think they’ll ever forgive you for destroying half of their rooms, killer of the Dark Lord or not.”
Draco doesn’t understand. He’s too young, with a brain already foggy with dreams, and not enough experience of the world to understand.
He steps back, face closing off quickly. “This was a bad idea. I’m leaving.” Turning around, he begins to flee, but Luna grabs his elbow and pulls him back.
“Narcissa, Draco is-” Again, the words stick, choking him as his throat tightens with guilt. He can’t do this. He just can’t. “I’m sorry, do you have a bathroom I could use?”
“Very well, Nott.” She smiles, face lined with a type of sad happiness. “I shall speak to the department. In the meantime, you should speak to your teachers, and Hagrid. I’m sure we can arrange for your own rooms in the castle, so you won’t have to traipse to the top floor and back down again every day.”
She spins back around, narrowing her eyes at him. He’s looking back down at his work, cheeks dusted pink, hand clutching the quill a little too tightly.
His legs give out. Collapsing onto the floor, he curls up, a tree rubbing its bark against his back as he feels the guilt rushing towards him. It swallows him whole, caging his chest and pounding against his skull. He can’t breathe. He can’t breathe. He can’t breathe and he doesn’t know where he is and there’s no one there, no one there because he’s just killed Draco, he killed Draco, Draco's dead and he killed him!
His father loves him, and Draco has always loved his father, even now. He can at least allow him this moment of peace in his death.
The Dark Mark. He hates it. He can feel how poisonous it is, sense when it creeps up to Draco’s head and slides inside his brain. He wants it gone.
Speaking of Ron. Harry wanders over to him, raising a hand in a wave. Ron grins back, slinging an arm around his shoulders when he’s close enough.
‘Everte Statum’ Draco flicks his wand, and Potter crashes backwards into the door, slamming it closed. The room is pitch black now, but Draco adjusted to it a long time ago. The non-verbal spellwork had taken effort and time, but this was so worth it.
The smoke is thickening, darkening, the edges sharpening into spikes. Is this really what Malfoy is thinking? He wants to deny it, but the smoke is reaching down, wrapping around Malfoy’s hands, which have a tight grip on both ends of his wand. As though he’s going to snap it.
(“Even if Draco had been given everything in the world, he would still have had to deal with his own thoughts. Magic couldn’t fix him.”)
So. Potter told the whole school then. No doubt he told everyone how pathetic he had been, mumbling nonsense and just accepting Potter’s help. Defeated, Draco shakes his head slightly, wincing at the throbbing of his head.
He rolls his eyes, dropping the paintbrush in the pot and slowly maneuvering his wand over the picture of a sad house elf. For a moment, he thinks he sees the creature blink at him, but that can’t be real. He can barely dry the painting with his magic, how could he make it come to life?
A warm hand closes around his shaking ones, grounding him. “Draco?” He realises they’re all staring at him now, two pairs of brown eyes and one black filled with concern. Trembling, he focuses on Pansy’s, calming down.
Ending might be a little rushed, since I had to wrap it up pretty quickly before going out, but hopefully it still works.
They’d borrowed the projector and film from Mr Weasley, who’d been clearing out some of his muggle junk thanks to Mrs Weasley. The painted animals in the common room took offense to it at first, hissing and clawing at the lines of where the projection began, but soon they got bored and wandered off. Draco doesn’t understand the plot of the film much (all of the characters seem pretty stupid in his opinion), so he’d zoned out quite a while back in favour of relishing in the warmth from Harry.
Mine would have to be Luna. My second is Newt, because he's just too adorable and nice, but Luna does what she wants and does not care one bit about what other people think, which I adore. Plus, she's really pretty, so...
Leaning his chin on his hand, Harry drifts off again as they all start talking about… something. He isn’t really sure. All he knows is that Parkinson has put one hand over Malfoy’s head, and started playing with his hair. Is that normal? Sure, Harry had suspected they were dating in sixth year, but he’d thought with Malfoy budding up to Voldemort they’d have split up. Evidently not by the way Malfoy nudges closer into her hand.
Stole was a strong word for it. Draco hadn’t exactly fought very hard to keep it, and now he had doubts as to whether the wand would even respond to him anymore. It was rotted with dark magic the last time he’d seen it, and by rights it should be completely Potter’s property now. He’d won it in a fair fight.
Draco keeps his eyes down, tugging his beanie to cover more. Pansy joins Blaise in glaring, imperious, evidently hoping fear will make the students leave them alone. Theodore stares straight ahead, as though oblivious. The only sign that he's noticed is his clenched jaw and fist.
‘What’s got you so happy?’ Draco trails out of the chair and collapses into his bed, almost groaning in plaesure at the softness of it. He wishes he could lie here forever and never get up.
“Sorry.” Harry bites his lip, forcing himself to turn away from the room. “Are you ready to go down?”
Pansy leaps up from the seat in a second, wand out and pointed at the weasel’s neck. Silence washes over the common room like an icy wave, hands sneaking wands from sleeves or pockets. “And what is that supposed to mean, you rat?! Are you implying that you, in any way, have more right to feel things than us? Is that what your idiotic statement is about? Because, if it is, my dear friend, I will have no hesitation in-!”
As always, any ideas or questions or random comments are always appreciated! It's great being able to talk to you and see what you think of what I write.
Speaking of Parkinson and Zabini, the two of them have moved from giving him sly glares to giving Nott them instead. He’s asked Luna about it, who’d muttered something about too many wrackspurts. Ginny had then told him that Luna ‘isn’t a seer, y’know’ and that he should ‘go ask Trelawney if you’re so interested’. He hadn’t asked Trelawney.
“Went well?” His friend says cheerily. “Managed to convince him to spill all his secrets with that famous charm of yours? Saved everyone’s souls while you’re at it?”
“It’s weird that you’re going to be the first.” Harry shakes his head in amazement. “I bet they’re going to remember your name for far longer than mine. The Boy Who Lived Twice? Nah, they’re gonna be celebrating Luna Lovegood, first ever Mind Healer.”
“Ignore them.” Ron shakes his head. “We only need the stupid blonde git, right?” He glances at Harry, who holds onto Blaise’s wrist. No, it isn’t for support. That’s unnecessary, Blaise doesn’t need support. Theo insisted he do it, to make the transfer easier.
“I promise it won’t happen again, Malfoy. I know… I know what you did after the battle. Remus - I mean, Remus Lupin -gave me the letter last night. Will you please let me in?”
Finally, Terry heads down, Ron close behind. Harry kneels down in front of the grate, preparing himself, but before he can stick his own head through, one pops up in front of him. Remus’s startled face stares into his, and cracks into a grin.
“Yeah, ok, I’ll do that. Thank you, professor.” He nods enthusiastically, heading towards the group in the corner, how with Ginny.
Time passes by, filled with laughter and excitement at the comforting familiarity of it all. Soon the plates vanish, signalling Ginny and Luna to stand.
A bit of a short chapter, this time, but I think the next one will be longer. I have the final plan in my mind, so there may only be about five(?) chapters left. Don't worry, though! There will probably be more, knowing me, and there's always going to be my shorter fanfics being uploaded.
Harry’s heart sinks. Lost his wife, so now he’s trying to regain his friend? It’s impossible. Sirius is dead. Harry has to - no, Remus, Remus has to accept that.
He shakes his head, feeling a little faint. How could he have never realised? Did he never doodle something and see it move? Then again, he was far too busy trying not to die to doodle lately, and the skill tends to come out around the age of sixteen. He’s read a few books on it.
A chuckle ripples through them all as they surround them. Poppy is eying the hoard with an unimpressed look, but she doesn’t move to shoo them out like usual. Apparently coming back from the dead has its perks.
There’s a horrible silence, muffled coughing and shuffling feet as he tries to push the words out, breathing from his belly like Luna has taught him to do. Nothing. Frustration wells inside him, making his heart pound faster and breaths come quicker despite his efforts. The seconds seem to stretch out into hours, pitying and disgusted looks mixing and getting confused.
“Alright, I think that’s enough. Any more questions can be addressed to your head of house. For now, Filch will lead you to your dormitory.”
Draco grins at him, mind full of (iloveyouiloveyouiloveyou) racing thoughts. He chokes on his words, so much to say and not enough time to say it, and all that flies from him in smoke (white smoke?) is ‘Hi’, because he’s an equally absolute idiot.
“I apologise. It is polite of you to visit. How has Draco taken the news?” Her voice is light, concern lacing her words clearly.
Ok, we're getting close (for the thousandth time) to the ending here. This chapter is a bit of a mash of things, but I didn't have a set plan in mind for this one, I just had to fill up an entire chapter without getting onto the big event of the next chapter.
Granger? She would know about everything that’s going on with Potter, and she’s been sitting with Draco in the library. As irritating as that is, being replaced by the Mudblood, Pansy can see that Granger must at least feel more sympathetic towards Draco. Yet talking to Granger would mean Granger tells Potter, and if Potter is drugging or cursing Draco, he would try to get rid of Pansy. Not good.
Maybe if he hadn’t been so suspicious back then, he could have helped Draco more. Maybe he wouldn’t have cast that spell.
It’s frustrating. He hides the visits, saying he’s going to study in the library, and ends up having to do exactly that when Malfoy turns his back. Time and time again, he avoids Parkinson’s suspicious glares, Ron's hurt eyes, and Nott’s bitter resentment. All for him to say some small thing and be met with petulant anger.
They know he’s alive, at least. The house elves in the kitchen, overhearing their conversation, told them they deliver food to him every day. Apparently, they’re the only beings he lets into the room, despite the fact that Potter and Michael now have nowhere to sleep. They’ve been jumping around the other dorms for the past few nights, but she can tell Michael is starting to get annoyed. Potter is curiously quiet.
Luna smiles, setting Jaebo down on the coffee table. The animals painted on the walls start to gather around, eager for attention too. “Hello, hello, hello. Oh, snakey, you look especially shiny today!”
“Right.” Remus narrows his eyes. “Well, I would suggest looking in the library, if you’re allowed in the Forbidden Section. There’s a few books on mind magic, and I’ll owl you any books I find in this place. Please, Harry, don’t actually test out the spells. You don’t know what damage it could do.”
Faintly, he registers his hands are shaking again. He stares at them in morbid fascination, deciding to focus on that rather than the fact that his robes are all crumpled on the ground. Gently, he intertwines his fingers, squeezing them together and breathing deeply until they remain still.
Draco nods again. Why would Harry not be happy? He’s the Saviour, the Blessed Baby, the Boy Who Lived Twice. The stupid scarface who has been riding a broomstick of success from the minute he survived Volde- the Dark Lord’s killing curse.
Trembling, he digs his teeth into his bottom lip, trying desperately not to cry. The shadows in the corners leer at him, whispering how it is his fault, how he’s so selfish to be crying. He did this, why should he be allowed to cry? Draco was Narcissa’s child, her only child who had protected her until his death, and she is the one with the right to cry over him. Not Harry.
“We wanted to give you both a ‘welcome back’ present.” Hermione announces, stood in the gap between their beds. “Hopefully they’ll give you something to do until you’re well enough to go out again.”
Theodore glances up through the holes in the shack, wolfsbane ready in his hand. He hates this. There’s no reason to go through it, without anyone waiting for him on the other side with a smile and an open heart. Father’s in Azkaban, again, and Draco is hiding away in his room. If he died in this shack, would anyone care? Would anyone come looking for him? Would anyone cry when they buried him in the ground? He doubts it.
Speaking of smells, there’s another one mixing with the pastries. Metallic. Thick. Something familiar he can’t quite put his finger on. Finally, he lifts his wand, muttering a spell that lights up the candles around the room.
Nice. Not perfect, not in the slightest, but not the worst thing ever. A middle ground. Balancing on a knife blade, not sure whether your next movement will tip you over the side.
Harry slips out of the ward, feeling like he’s drifting in his thoughts, an ocean of resentment against what he’d done.
Shaking his head, he dismisses his unease and stops in front of the gates, memories of the last time he was here flooding his mind. Hermione screaming. Bellatrix’s laughter. Dobby’s-
She means that he is hiding with the only people who won’t punch him, of course. Knowing her, she’ll adopt him as her new pet to protect, and Draco can’t help but want to demand Nott leave and never return. Instead, he shrugs noncommittally, and sits. Instantly, Pansy pulls his head down to rest on her lap, where it stays for the remainder of the trip.
Huffing, he swings himself onto the carpeted floor, stumbling at the sudden lightness in his head. His legs shake, so he sits once more, resigning himself to calling a house elf to help him. They had all been under Vold-...the Dark Lord’s control when he had arrived here, so it was a shock when he found a few of them still in the house after he was defeated. Secretly, he’s grateful. His mother needs someone to keep her company in her house arrest, with his father in Azkaban, and Draco...like he is.
A collective sigh of relief ripples over the group as they surge forward again, nervously disappearing into the air. Pans giggles as she sticks her foot out, watching it vanish, then following it. Now there’s only Draco left behind, staring at the empty space.
The silence is deafening, everyone expecting him to declare his intentions. His silver eyes flick over each person's face, trying to gauge their reactions, until he decides against heading to Pansy. That would take him past Buck-Teeth and towards the weasel, and judging by the hard lines around her mouth every time Pansy’s wand nears the weasel, the Muggle spawn would cast an incredibly nasty hex. No, not that way.
It resists slightly, confusion souring the cream and dragging out the coldness, a musty scent of moldy parchment stinging his hand. Blaise can feel his forehead dampening, the strain of battling with pure magic making him sweat.
Harry rubs his face, pushing past the man to approach the gates. He thought people knew that. He’d told everyone at her trial, although he supposes the newspapers aren’t likely to print that. The Boy Who Lived Twice defending the wife of a Death Eater? No one would want to read that.
“Are you really only having some bread and an apple? Draco, love, try the lasagne. It’s become better since fifth year.”
“Oh, Harry, I’ve got some news you might want to know…” Remus jumps in, smile spreading once more. Harry suspects he’s just trying to avoid another argument, yet he lets it slide.
He only has a little left. Still, he could whisk the source of the magic away from here with that, let him recharge, and consume again.
He opens the door, fire filling his lungs, breathing life into his corpse. He can’t let him get away with this. Potter doesn’t deserve to live happily ever after, not after everything he’s done. Especially not with that letter, and especially not after the attack earlier in the year.
“Well, it’s more of a question.” He settles down closer to the fire, knees curled up to his chest. “Are there any spells that fix people’s heads? Like how obliviate makes people forget things, but I don’t want him to forget it, I just want him to see it differently.”
Harry’s puffing like Slughorn by the time he nears the corridor. If this does turn out to be a prank, he won’t have the strength to fight it off, but he turns the corner anyway.
Of course. Draco had given it to Luna so she could lay it over Dobby’s grave. Harry had been such an idiot back then, bursting into a girl’s dormitory because he actually thought Draco would kill her, the one person from another house who didn’t hate him.
He gulps, setting off down the long pathway. The unsettling feeling follows him, surrounds him, and Harry wonders how in Merlin’s name Narcissa is surviving in this place. He wonders how Draco survived, in the months between the trial and school starting. Then he realises Draco didn’t survive, not really. He’d been a ghost, his past self barely peeking its head out.
Everyone remains frozen, staring at the space the caretaker used to be. A few seconds pass in deathly silence. Abruptly, his face appears, twisted in annoyance.
And then it’s the day before he has to leave, and he’s not ready. He’s finally started properly showering, yes, and he wears clothes in the day, yes, and he eats a small meal twice a day, yes, but… no words ever come out. He’s cold all the time without his blankets. His hands shake when he remembers. He screams every night when he is able to sleep, which is not very often, and his tongue bleeds every morning after. His mark still throbs, under all the permanent bandages. He’s only talked to house elves and his mother since the trials ended.
“Here.” Harry pushes forwards, giving the boxes to their respective people. To Black, he grins as he passes it over, receiving a vigorous hair ruffle in return. To Draco, he smiles in an awkwardly shy but hopeful way, cheeks flushing as Draco returns it. Draco’s heart does a little flip at the expression, mind racing with ‘how could I ever deserve that face’.
“Running away again? Yeah, thought so!” His voice taunts from behind, forcing Draco to spin to them. Opening his mouth, he prepares to yell at them to leave him alone, that they have no idea what he’s like, that he wouldn’t run from them. His voice sticks.
Draco doesn’t, at all, but he nods anyway. He’s lived his whole life with magic, and he’s always thought about what he does, weighing up the pros and cons of every decision. Except for where Harry is involved. Harry has always been the exception.
Harry frowns, slotting the new information away. He wonders why he’d never heard of this before, considering he’s in the same year group. Then again, he did think he had a serial killer after him that year.
“Malfoy…” Professor Lupin (no, not a professor, not anymore) reads over the short letter once, then again, as though he can’t believe what he’s seeing. “Why?”
So many comments! I love signing in and seeing all of your thoughts on the story, or on the question, or on anything at all! Anyway, another question at the bottom.
They skirt around the edge of that corridor, turning away once more, and Draco loosens his grip. He won’t have to confront that problem today, then. Not quite yet.
Why are they confused? They shouldn’t be confused. All the other Slytherins have run away from him or yelled something about unfairness. Harry lowers his wand, racing mind calming enough to see the red trimming of their jumper. It’s a Gryffindor, not a Slytherin. A Gryffindor, beating another person up. A group of Gryffindors, beating up a defenseless…
“I love you, my sweet child, I’ve always loved you and been so proud of you! I never meant to hurt you like this. I’m so sorry!”
“Well, well, well. Isn’t that a surprise.” Theodore tilts his head, narrowing his eyes at the book. “Then again, he has the same arrogant streak as Vizzini, even if he doesn’t have the same amount of power. You think he’s up to it?”
“Draco?” Harry’s smile falls, all eyes on Draco as he stops, fingers shaking over the last piece of paper. “What’s wrong?”
Better. He folds the parchment, slips it into an envelope, and leaves it on the desk. Hermione or Potter can take it up to the owlery next time they visit. As he thinks that, the door opens and Potter walks in, bright grin on his face and treacle tart in hand.
“This is my final question, I swear.” Harry sits back, hands sliding to intertwine with Draco’s. “What was up with that sweater? Near the start of the year, you wore… my sweater. At least I think it was mine. I never got to ask you about it.”
Except he shouldn’t, and it’s wrong. Not because it’s gay, Luna’s managed to stop those thoughts, but because it’s the boy who bullied him and then almost killed Dumbledore. He doesn’t want to like Malfoy. It isn’t fair that he likes his smile, and his sarcasm, and his ambition, and his ridiculously soft hair. He hates the way he’s now looking back over his memories and reassessing them from Malfoy’s point of view. Back then, the ferret was a richer Dudley. Now, he knows it’s so much more complicated than that.
He shifts uncomfortably, hand adjusting his glasses. “Well, I was wondering why you and Malfoy- I mean, uhm, Draco - aren’t talking anymore? You were really close, and then…”
“When did he tell you this?” Pansy sits down heavily on the floor opposite Luna, face amused. Or it could be exasperated. Or annoyed. Luna doesn’t really know. The pixie behind her can tell her later if she asks him, but she’s never talked to them before, so they could disappear right after this conversation. She hopes not. The portraits are always so much nicer than other students, since no one else talks to them a lot.
Suddenly, he jolts up, eyes flaring wide open as a thought occurs to him. “Remus! You said Sirius might be in Limbo, right?”
Smiling weakly, he turns back to the half-unwrapped box, trembling fingers ripping away more. What if it’s just a sign saying ‘I don’t want to date you’ from Harry? What if it’s a little more subtle, like a poem about an ignorant peasant who falls in love with a prince, and ignores every sign that the prince actually hates him?
Draco nods his head, stopping the eye roll that he’s dying to do. Where else did Harry think he was going to go? Back to the Manor?
Harry picks at the edge of the table, flushing. He has more money than ever before now, with all of the presents and awards and paid interviews from saving their world. Even before that, his parents had left him enough money to not have to work ever again. For Nott, a pureblood who he’d always thought looked down on him, to not have enough money to eat seems unbelievable. Purebloods are rich and arrogant and fascist. Nott doesn’t seem to be any of these things now.
His blonde curls bob up and down as he nods triumphantly, a small smile gracing his lips. Pansy shoves aside the pile of paper and claps her hands together, a determined expression on her face. “Forget all of this stuff. Granger, Draco, we have more important work to do!”
“Mr Malfoy.” Blaise offers his hand, then winces and retracts it when he realises Lucius can’t shake it. “It’s good to see you.”
The new voice slams into his ribcage, forcing him to fall back to the floor with gasping breaths. A tall thin man stands a little way off, platinum hair streaming down his back like a shining stream of gold, hair that Draco remembers sifting through as a child.
“I’m sorry.” Sirius mutters from above him, fingers resting on his hair. He’d found Draco not long after his father had vanished, and had carefully led him over to a column, patting his back and trying to provide comfort despite having no idea why Draco was upset.
