And maybe, when you're out, we'll see each other again. Wouldn’t it be weird to meet at Luna’s? If you remain friends after that. If we do meet again, I promise to give you a chance. And maybe I’ll ask you at least one of those questions circling in my head.
I’m sorry, my love. That I never explained nothing and that it took me so long to have the strength to name you like that. You deserve better. In fact, you deserve much, much better than me. If I was half the good man I thought I was years ago I would let you go, live your life, finally live in France far away from me. I would never forget you but maybe you would, with time. Everything that happened would be behind you and maybe you could grow back from the ashes of what happened. But I’m not that good a man, and I know I don’t have the right but I want you for myself. I want you here, with me, I want you to forgive me, I want another chance, I want to find a way, any way to get you back. You don’t believe any good can come from a prison sentence anymore but if it could make a difference to you, I’ll make my time in Azkaban too.
Joke! But they are staying for dinner. I’m making the spicy Moroccan everyone likes. Jamie and Teddy are coming. We’ll have a nice dinner on our level and then they’ll take the boys home.
“That’s what I thought, but it has to be thought through better.”
“Hey! I hope you’re staying out of trouble. Where’s Jerry?”
To be fair they don’t have the best track record. Ginny does have unique access to the details.
“I understand.”
“So if you go through here you have your bathroom. Tub and shower. I like these sinks. There should be plenty of hot water. If not, let us know and we’ll have it fixed. Do you know there’s what is called a tankless water heater? Unlimited hot water! Linen closet with extra towels. Draco put these in here too. Even set you up with some basics. Oh, his son Scorp made those soaps and stuff. Those are going to smell awesome. . . . shampoo and conditioner too.”
And it’s clean.
See you at the Leaky! Bye.
I’ve just finished. What’s up?
“Double it up.”
And there’s an apparition point right around the corner off of Duntshill Road.
Just get my Grandson’s over here so I can spoil them!
“Then you could use the fondant. No piping.”
“NO!”
HOW? Oh wait. Maybe I know.
“No. The house.”

Hugo has been quite thorough. The Dept. of Mysteries is on it. MLE is on it. Those bases are covered. Hugo has the filing ready to go, I just need to transmit it once Draco has finished his final read and he’s nearly done. I’ve got the Supreme Mugwump waiting. She’s agreed to expedite it on an emergency basis and is already in contact with the original Muggle divorce Judge. Once that’s done we can finish up with the Muggle authorities. There are hundreds of pages of additional evidence collected by both MLE and Muggle investigators. And now because of Mysteries we have all of their locations. They apparently could never pin anything on them because of a hands-off religious exemption.
“How much further?”
“No, I hope he’s having a nice time with them.”
“This is a new start. A tradition with my family is that you get called what you prefer. You decide. What do you
“Teddy!”
“He did?”
That is so DAD.
“HA!”
“If it’s for the Children’s Society? . . . . Go ahead and put my fucking wand on display! That would get people down there.”
“You can always tell me to go back to my own dream you know.”
For the cottage.
“Here you go.”
I appreciate knowing that. Agruella will as well.
“Perfect!”
We get it! But Ted, ANIMAL CROSSING.
“Channel four it is then!”
AP: Wow, another nice transition Auntie!
Plus, I get to bake a cake and my special chocolate cupcakes!
GRRRRRR.
I’ll get Jennifer into a chat. When is good for you?
“Not a picky eater then?”

Or gifts.
“Where are you going for that one?”
Hey guys, Thanks for doing this. I was starting to get confused with all the projects.
Dreaded Aunt Walburga’s place. I’ve heard about the painting. And she says there are mummified elf heads running up the stairs. Shivers.
But you can have fun with your driving uniforms :) Maybe something with a line of Muggle buttons.
“She chose Coldplay of all the freaking things. COLDPLAY.”
Let me just briefly share a photo. Sorry for the interruption, but asking for Lily reminded me:
Well, my job just got a hell of a lot easier!
“I think you need Lily the pedicurist. She'll let you choose the nail colour.”
“OH.”
“Let me do this. Here we are in a public place. Dressed in fairly nice things and I get to feed you your chocolate. The last time we were here we were hiding in a booth in the back. Today you’re my husband and I want to feed you this chocolate mousse because your lips are so pretty. So open up Malfoy-Potter and fucking take it.”
Go Jamie! Go celebrate with Jones. Do that pool dance thing or something!”
“I figured.”
Awesome!
Pt. 2 of the Family Dinner.
Draco and I will be over in about an hour? With Mum and Jerry.
Looks like Hugo and Grayson have competition!
“Dried herbs here. Seeds here. Blends here. Peppers, black, green, white, pink and your rainbow blend. Your salts are here. . . . .fleur de sel. . .your smoked salts here. . . the pink Himalayan, Australian sea salt, the red Hawaiian. This one is just your holiday and baking spices, nutmeg, star anise, cinnamon, allspice and such.”
Miss Parks
“Minnie’s going to retire in five years. Uncle Nev is going to take over as headmaster. Scorp and I plan on one at least one more baby after Aspen. Maybe another when she’s a little older.”
Thats fine.
I’ll contact Liogell and have them open it up. I really want to see it. The overview says Euphemia Potter retreat. So that means it was my Grandmothers.
“Zebb and Trandy have given the staff at Grimmauld the day off tomorrow. They’ll help get you moved.”
“Where should I really keep it then?”
Yes. It’s just Geraldo and one assistant I think?
I’m awesome!
“Step up here.”
“Yeah. I kept them. They’re even in backwards order. I just put each reply on top of the last in a box. They’re still in my old trunk.”
“Sorry.”
WOAH.
“Yes of course!”
A baby coming has some to do with it too.
I didn’t know any of this, but yes good!
“Can it be Malfoy-Potter like the boys? If so I’m all for it.”

Ugh. I love you more.
“What do you know about magic?”
Luna Lovegood-Longbottom -
You’ve got a date!
Absolutely NO Pigs. Guinea or Bacon.
“Alright, Jon? Do you want to help Davey open the lid?”
“What?”
“I can cook. I might not be as good as my brother, but I can fucking cook a few things.”
No stay here. Please?
I haven’t been back to the penthouse because I’m concerned it’s still there. I also think Scorpius recognized that THING.
“Don’t bother Decram they’re catching up on the gameshows they missed this past week. I understand Sev is getting an education in Muggle cultural events. Plus, that would require you to put on clothes and I’m determined to keep you in your favourite outfit until at least tomorrow.”
“Too funny. I’m glad the photographers got their shite together.”
“Who is this handsome young man on the arm of Hugo Granger-Weasley?” LOL!
How’s Aspen?
“Punkin head!”
“Sweet, Sweet Coffee! And I think your Slytherin snake pants are fetching . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . I’m okay. . . . . . . . .No, I swear, I’m okay. . . . . . . . . Merlin, Draco.
“I did and I didn’t. But it’s still pretty good. I’ll read you the highlights. It’s mostly from the tournament. I abandoned it pretty quickly.”
If it was a dark ritual, perhaps some French voodoo thing maybe. Otherwise NO.
Obviously that’s going to happen on another day. We’re singing along with the Starland Vocal Band at the moment.
“And how do people actually get to Wales?”
Just wanted them to have a good day.
“I know!”
“They did?”
“What kind of biscuits do you have for sale today? Excuse me for just a second while I call my assistant. . . . . . ”
There you go, kids. That’s perfect in my opinion..
“Doesn’t look like it. They were meant more as an exercise in the execution of different styles. They were probably graded.”
What the fuck did we just watch?
“It’s good.”
“That’s you unfiltered. We always love that the most.”
GROAN.
I need you to gather in my offices. I’ll get some refreshments and open up the conference rooms. I’ll open up my direct floo.
Scorp and I are at the Cat & Crown having a bite. This place is nice.
“I thought you said it was temporary?”

Malfoy Manor (Fidelius)
“I will tell you, because of that war and what I did, I’ve spent a good portion of my adult life working to keep myself and my kids grounded. I’m a very lucky man, Dud.”
“Witch Weekly then?”
Diagon Alley, London
He’ll Love It. I’ll be heading back in about an hour, I’ll bring him over in two?
Hermione said that part.
“The tea sets are rattling.”
“Both! Draco?”
“What the . . . .”
Just one fucking week without some bombshell would be nice? It’s only fucking MONDAY.
There is a beautiful Auburn 851, Speedster in perfect condition, 1935, but that only seats two.
——————————————————————————
What day?
“Agreed. And it’s inexpensive. Why on earth anyone would want to grow their own oregano is beyond me.”
Can you guess what Ginny's favourite word is today?
Harry and Draco tell the boys about their surprise.
OMG. Harry, you’ve planned a big party haven’t you?
Ted. For example there’s a massive Klimt in the main floor dining and a Miro above the fireplace. There’s a theme throughout. And they’re not prints. So you understand what he means by “don’t touch” and the reason the place is so heavily warded.
Yes please? I’m about finished with the approvals and then I was going to work out. And then I’ve got the boys.
“Certainly.”
“Hey up there! Nice jumpsuit!”
“Nothing. The wand, although unusual in form will be more than adequate for the boy’s lifetime. If he chooses later that the wand needs a different aesthetic we can address that issue, but I would be very wary to alter it.”
“Let’s do it.”
Draco, aren’t you done with that potion thingy yet???? Don’t forget!
—————————————————————————
I’ll remind you of that when the photos come out in the paper tomorrow.”
“We need to do something. I’ve finished up signing all of the Gringotts paperwork. All of the bills are paid and now there’s nothing left on my schedule.”
“Oh plants! They’re making progress. And look at that. Small fountains are in. No water though.”
For immediate review:
“That’s me here. Look at the bottom one. That’s the day we met!”
OMG I just realized. Is Draco going to move out of the penthouse??????
Fairy lights are underrated, AND we have matching pillows.
“What? Why?”
And then Draco and I are going to take the guest room down at the far left end of the hall. The one with the nursery. We’ll use Draco’s furniture for now too. His bed is comfy. Sooo comfy.
“Exactly. And that wouldn’t have been authentic for you. . . . .But it might be for someone else. It’s about what’s right on your own terms, not what someone else thinks.”
“Oh. That’s awesome. And Kreacher looks so proud and relaxed!”
“Zebb helped.”
I’m talking about Rosie and Jaydne.
“He’s probably down with Scorp then. I came up by myself. Let me just waddle over to the railing and see if I spot them!”
I would like the clerk to record the vote on the legislation entitled “The Abolishment and Repeal of Discriminatory Laws Imposed upon Minorities”.
I had Mr. Liogell connect the kitchen floo systems between centre and manor. He’ll de-activate it after the event. He also did a general (exit only) connection so guests will have the option of using one of the fireplaces in the entrance hall for their return home if they choose.
“I like backward dinner!”
“Is it all gross?”
“The sound is AMAZING. Thank you so much!”
“UGH! Just come with me!”
“Curtains out! Peony wallpaper is hideeeeeooooous!”
Oh it’s good. We’re having a virtual fistfight over Dad’s birthday again with Teddy!
“THAT’S IT! Try it again!”

“Decram is always full of surprises. I told him it was for you and he knew exactly what to choose from the jewelers hall. . . . . .now the shoes. . . . . . . that’s why Pansy altered the hem on the trousers that way.”
“Oh.”
“Open those pocket doors.”
Mr. Jordan Delivers:
You always have the best ideas!
“So cool.”
“Oh Merlin. He’s even put away my cookbooks!”
“That you already know. Yes. Fireworks. They come from the Wheezes.”
UGH. Yes!

Not really, it’s muggle. I ordered it online and had Hermione do her thing to it so it works in the lab.
“This is what it looked like in 1940. She who shall not be named didn’t inherit the place until ’46, so this is before she did her “alterations”.”
Yes please! I was thinking just a 5cm white mat?
“No way! It’s just a parade viewing party.”
I do.
Weird.
So are you going to hyphenate your names too? Going to have to match up!
“This. . . . . . .”
Jamie and I already know. You’re going to like it. We’ll be back after we put the boys to bed.
Thank Hermione for the license. Come home! I’m loosing my bearings.
What else can I be of assistance for concerning Mr. Evans?
“I’m not moving in yet! Just some basics like coffee, tea and biscuits. Not too much food but enough to make a quick lunch while it’s being worked on?”
Would it be okay? Are you sure?

“You can’t be serious, Scarhead.”
“Okay.”
“That bar across the corner is a perch.”
“Shall we head upstairs to Mother?”

“Why no books?”
friends.”
”You’re taking the mickey, right?” he says after a moment and they all shake their heads.
Harry nods quickly, ”Or when I fell through the portal, I’m not sure… I just remember holding it in my left hand as I was duelling the Death Eaters, and when I woke up in the Hospital Wing… in the other place… it was gone.”
Ironically, he hears one of the boys snicker and ask Dudley under his breath
”What did you do?” he demands in an unusually loud and uncontrolled voice.
”Hey cub… your dad said you wanted me to let you know I got back alright?” Remus whispers and Harry feels his fingers card through his hair. ”I’m fine, pup… go back to sleep…”
”I … I was confused”, Harry says again and shrugs.
”Don’t you start…” Harry mutters, collapsing onto the bed.
and urges him inside the pub with an insistent hand on his back.
He tries to catch the professor’s eyes, but the man is stubbornly staring straight ahead as he continues to push and prod Harry towards the Entrance Hall and then past a few curiously goggling last-minute stragglers out of the large oak doors and onto the lawn.
”Wood is looking smug”, Flint mutters quietly, glaring over at the Gryffindor table. ”He’s probably underestimating our new Seeker—”
He drops down to the ground. He’s staring wordlessly at the approaching two owls whilst biting his lip anxiously, when Harry joins him.
”No”, Dumbledore says softly. ”She has been Petrified —”
Harry thinks.
He turns swiftly and begins to walk across the lawn. Harry grabs the golden egg from the ground and hurries after him. He tries to grab his hand, but Draco immediately snatches it back and stuffs it inside his pocket. He doesn’t say anything else, or look at Harry. He just keeps staring straight ahead and walks at a steady pace until they reach the Slytherin Common Room.
”Yeah”, Harry whispers and smiles wickedly. ”Promise you can keep a secret?”
”The Dark Arts”, he murmurs dramatically, clasping his hands in front of him. ”Are many, varied, ever-changing and
— gets a hold of that Stone, Voldemort is coming back!”
”No-one knows”, Harry says shortly.
…” Dursley hisses, his face now closer to purple than red and Harry wonders if he might be having an anuerism. ”
…” Snape urges and continues to pull on his arm.
He smirks playfully against Harry’s lips before sealing their mouths together in a deep kiss that steals Harry’s breath away, along with the last of his reluctance and insecurity.
”Ah, Severus”, Remus says softly. ”Speak of the trolls…”
”— touching himself —”
”…’lo there”, the grumpy old man in the painting says and gives him a half-hearted little wave.
Harry thinks faintly.
Slughorn turns back around, the three glasses of lemonade hovering in the air in front of him.
Over the next couple of weeks, in-between stuffing their faces with everything chocolatey and engaging in long-winded tournaments of Exploding Snap with Sirius, Harry and Remus continue practising the Patronus Charm and finally, on Twelfth Night, Harry manages to conjure a corporeal Patronus. His stomach swoops, but as soon as the Patronus form registers with him, it sinks again and the silvery creature immediately evaporates into thin air.
Harry turns back to Draco, even as he starts shovelling food onto his plate and hisses, ”You never told me I’m mentioned in any books!”
”Great!” Harry says with a grin.
He still hasn’t opened his eyes, and when he feels his dad’s hand shake his shoulder insistently, he presses them shut even tighter.
Stumbling out of the fireplace at home, Harry remains standing in the middle of the room for a moment. He looks around at the familiar, bulging bookcases and snoozing portraits, the worn old sofa and the coffee table, the row of framed photographs on top of the mantlepiece… Home… He wonders if Draco and Narcissa are home at the Manor yet… Unless… Unless… Harry shivers and hugs himself. No, he tells himself sternly. Draco said he’d be fine, Drcao is fine. They’re both home and safe.
Harry blinks and looks around. He doubles back and sits down in one of the seats in the front row. Professor Snape stands up and stalks over to tower over him, his narrowed eyes boring down on Harry with intense scrutiny that makes Harry want to squirm, but he wills himself to remain still and maintain the eye contact calmly.
”Harry,
”Draco, please tell me the truth”, Harry murmurs. ”Did I hurt you last night?”
wrong
”I’m not that short for my age”, Harry protests feebly, but the small pile of presents at the foot of the bed is already stealing his attention and he eagerly scrambles over to rip into the first one.
Harry belatedly remembers that these versions of Sirius and Remus are apparently a couple and accidentally catches Sirius leaning in for a kiss, before hurriedly whipping his head around.
”Yes, Sir”, Harry says quickly, grabbing Ron by the hand and dragging him back inside the castle.
”What’s doing it?” she says in a terrified voice. ”What’s eating it?”
”Hogwarts is guarded by many ancient spells and charms to ensure the bodily and mental safetly of those who dwell within her walls”, Snape reassures him. ”Time and space matter in magic. Eye contact is often essential to Legilimency.”
Rummaging around in his rucksack, the Irish boy produces two large bottles of firewhiskey with a beaming grin. Draco yelps and immediately scrambles to grab from him.
”Sir?” Draco prompts warily.
— I’ll kill you! I’LL KILL—!”
Draco blinks in surprise at the word
”That’s what Voldemort was after, what he wanted me to find.”
Professor Snape nods in understanding.
”It was Hagrid”, Harry gasps. ”Hagrid opened the Chamber last time.”
Harry cringes in shock, and would have screamed if he wasn’t so petrified. Where the back of Quirrell’s head ought to have been, another face is protruding; a terrible, chalk white face, and although Harry can’t make out the features without his glasses on, there’s no mistaking the bright, red eyes…
Professor Snape opens the large oak doors with another flick of his wand and lets Harry step through first.
, he concedes to himself. She’s only ever been at one party with Granger and neither of them really got to drink all that much before Remus caught them all and confiscated the firewhiskey.
And it had been amazing! He really wants to do it again, but he’s too scared to initiate it… What if Draco doesn’t want to kiss him again? What if he leans in and the blonde recoils or pushes him away or slaps him across the face —
”Oh…” Draco whispers and there’s a strangled quality to his voice that does all sorts to wicked things to Harry and he can barely stop himself from grinning.
”M-my Lord…?”
Remus finally lets go of Harry and grabs his trunk for him. Harry gets a glimpse of Draco and his parents just before they step through the barrier to King’s Cross.
”What”, Harry snaps. ”I can’t read minds!”
, he thinks numbly but even as he thinks this, he finds himself walking towards the door at the end of the corridor as if pulled to it by some magical force…
”You’re not still jealous, are you?” he asks in an undertone once they pull apart and then watches warily as the blonde’s eyes immediately shutter. ”You have no reason to be, Draco. None, whatsoever.”
Blaise rolls his eyes.
”Guys — enough”, Harry says tiredly.
The chill in his Head of House’s voice sends a shiver over Harry. He squeezes his eyes shut and sends a silent prayer to whatever powers might be at work in the Universe that the Potion Master will keep him alive long enough for Harry to come up with an explanation… Swallowing thickly, he turns around.
He sits up and wipes his sweaty fringe form his forehead and rubs his scar, but it’s no use. The pain is coming from inside his head, not the scar itself.
”Both of you out of my office”, Snape snarls. ”
Harry gingerly perches on the edge of his seat and studies his daddy’s face with a frown… He hadn’t noticed it at all during the lesson, but the man looks ill… His complexion is pale, almost ashen and he’s clearly exhausted…
”It’s not going to work if you’re in a bad mood or have a negative attitude, Harry”, Remus says, shaking his head. ”You need to have confidence in yourself and your memory, because if you feel defeated, you are actively working
”Patience, my dear boy…”
”I need to tell you that you and your partner —”
”Oh, for…” Harry thrusts his head back and glares at the ceiling. Password — what was it? — McGonagall said it last night — what was it?!
”Not get involved?” Harry splutters.
”No, not since last week”, Harry laughs.
Harry” — Remus sits back on the bed, pulling Harry with him until Harry is more or less draped over his shoulder and clinging onto him like he never wants to let go.
”It’s not even eight o’clock”, Harry says. ”You always say never floo before ten in the morning and after ten at night.”
”Hospital Wing”, Seamus says.
wants to do is hex the grins off of the Hufflepuff girls faces, Harry counts backwards from ten like his dad has taught and then kneels down and starts collecting his books.
”Go, go,
”Care?” Harry cuts in.
The rest of the Slytherins stampede onto the pitch, swarming around them, cheering ecstatically. Harry’s dads beam at him and with a couple of final pats on his shoulder they tell him they’ll see him at Christmas.
His voice is immediately drowned by an outcry from the benches. Several witches and wizards shake their heads, and some even shake their fists at Bagman, to show their disagreement.
”What’s got into you—?” Draco says as soon as he catches sight of him next to the door.
Harry looks over his shoulder. Madam Hooch is approaching their team with long strides. He feels his heart stutter in his chest.
Someone is shaking him roughly. The soft darkness of sleep slowly shrinks into the corners of his consciousness and he blinks his eyes open in confusion. His eyelids still feel incredibly heavy and his vision is still blurred, even after his glasses are pushed onto his face.
”There is juice”, Lupin says, putting a plate of scrambles eggs down in front of Harry. ”We have orange and pumpkin — but you prefer pumpkin, right?”
”Yeah, I’m okay, Harry”, Draco says and gives him a small, crooked smile.
! You will
”Relax, Harry…” Draco murmurs gently, breaking the kiss.
”There you are”, Pansy says, appearing behind Draco and looking just as happy. ”That has literally made my top ten list of things that have ever happened…”
”What?” Draco murmurs curiously.
”Just spiteful rubbish”, Remus says with a dismissive shake of his head.
”Nothing”, Sirius says. ”Look, Harry… James was my best friend and yeah, looking back at some of the things we did, I was a bit of a wanker, and he could be a tosser at times, but he grew up to become the second best man I have ever known —”
Feeling nauseous, Harry buries his head in his arms and concentrates on taking deep breaths…
”No”, Harry exclaims. ”It should have been. But you’re kicking up such a fuss about this, I’m actually worried now that you believe I don’t care!”
Several of the professors react in alarm and Harry can see both Dumbledore and Professor Snape instinctively stand up, but it is Professor McGonagall who strides around the Head Table and runs down the middle aisle and disappears through the doors.
Harry sighs softly. He’s not in the mood to talk to the eccentric Headmaster just yet… For a second he contemplates burying himself under the covers and feigning sleep, but just then the old man tips his head forward and twinkles at him over the rim of his spectacles.
”Er…”
”Yeah, well”, Sirius says shortly. ”What does it even matter? Think I’m proud of having a relative like her? As far as I’m concerned, she’s not my family. None of them are. I cut my ties with the lot of them when I was sixteen!”
When Harry awakes for a second time, pale wintry sunlight is streaming through the high windows of the Hospital Wing. He fumbles with his glasses, the regrown bones in his right arm and hand stiff and prickly. Once the glasses are on his face, the other beds come into focus around him and Harry turns to peer over at Colin Creevy, but that particular bed is now hidden behind curtains.
”No, that’s okay…” Harry mumbles.
The girl looks up suddenly and catches him staring and immediately scowls at him. He quickly looks away again, shooting Pansy and Daphne an annoyed glare when the two girls burst out into snickers.
Sirius fills up his own coffee cup and automatically reaches out to fill Harry’s as well, before he catches himself and pauses, then gives Harry a questioning look. Harry shakes his head with a pinched smile and the man mumbles, ”Right, yeah, I remember…”
”Shouldn’t have asked”, Lockhart says jovially. ”We meet again, Harry!”
”I owled Narcissa”, Remus tells him. ”She just owled back a while ago. Everyone made it home safely and Draco says to tell you he’s looking forward to seeing you at Hogsmeade Station on the first…”
”Why are you and Draco sleeping in the Common Room?” Pansy demands. ”Better yet, why are you and Draco sleeping
Smiling, Harry leans forward and inhales a big breath… His eyes flicker over to Draco in the seat opposite and lock with his steel grey ones for a split second, his stomach fluttering as the blonde’s lips twitch, and Harry feels himself smile back, wider and happier than he probably should…
”It’s nice though…” he says softly once they’ve received their food, glancing around.
”Not really”, Harry mutters drily.
They join the others at the Slytherin table again and Harry refills his goblet with pumpkin juice and gulps the whole thing down in one go. Aware of the others weird looks, he slumps a little in his seat and wipes his mouth with the back of his hand a little defensively.
”What dirt have you got and on whom?” Seamus demands.
… Can we get out of here now?”
”Okay”, Harry grins.
Lockhart seems to have noticed the same thing however, because he quickly declares the demonstration to be over and instructs the students to get into pairs so that they can practise the Disarming Charm for themselves.
, according to a weather-worn street sign next to one of few functioning streetlamps.
”Don’t mention it”, Draco says.
Harry thinks.
”It was

sneaks up on him and has the usual, calming effect. Harry remembers the other Draco, almost identical to his own Draco in every way, once he let his guard down,
to tell you
”You keep quiet now”, the man growls. ”Can’t take any chances…”
Harry nods and watches him take off down the corridor at the top of the first landing, while Snape leads him down the passage at which end the large stone gargoyle is situated. He almost has to jog to keep up with Professor Snape and jumps slightly when the man swears suddenly, glaring at his arm watch.
”Will you help me stick them to my bed?”
The dark shape shifts again and this time a long-fingered, pale hand clutching a wand appears out of the tangle of robes…
He stares in wide-eyed excitement at the different shop windows, the glimmer of a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop catching his attention.
”And they didn’t have any more kids besides you?”
”What happened?”
” Draco says again, struggling to his feet and Harry can see that his legs are shaking. ”She came bursting into the office! She must have seen the water in the corridor —”
”If I
Harry, Ron and the rest of the first-years scurry between the older students and gather in front of a huge man wearing a large furry coat, and Harry realises with a jolt that this is Hagrid, he’s met him a couple of times before! When he was younger, the man — half-giant — had come to the house to visit them. He beams up at him, not feeling scared anymore.
that fluttery currents of charged
”Yeah”, Harry nods. ”I was still there, duelling with — I don’t know — at least two other Death Eaters. I was cornered. The Space Room was my only way out of there, but —”
I think —” Remus says eagerly, moving over to the pantry and digging through the contents with an almost childlike enthusiasm that makes Harry grin. ”Yes, we do! Harry, do you want a piece?”
Climbing to his feet, he turns around to see a very exhausted-looking wizard look up from a large gold watch and stoop down to pluck the tea cup from the ground and toss it in a large box of other used Portkeys. Another wizard, just as tired-looking as the first, if not more so, scribbles something on roll of parchment.
”He was”, Pansy counters. ”Daph just had a massive crush on him!”
”I’m up anyway”, Draco says and shrugs. ”I won’t be able to go back to sleep, so I might as well go down to the Great Hall with you.”
… I’ve got one year to teach you how to deal with Dark —”
”I know we did, you clumsy fool!” Draco says in a rush. ”Don’t ever scare me like that again!”
”Harry, what are you talking about?” Remus asks gently.
”Of course I haven’t”, the girl says haughtily. ”I wasn’t speaking to you at all until about two seconds ago.”
The Great Hall is in its usual Monday lull when they sit down for breakfast, but it’s broken in their section of the Slytherin table at least, when Draco slams down his copy of the
”Bread”, Seamus nods happily.
Harry sucks a shaky breath into his lungs.
It’s only when they start to filter further into the Time Room and start making their way towards the circular room and the Exit, that Harry realises there are even more people there than he’d first thought. He can see Professor Dumbledore hovering just behind Professor Snape along with the witch and wizard from the Department of Mysteries.
”You’re scaring the First Years!” Zoe calls back sternly.
Harry swallows thickly and carefully slides off the stool and starts making his way over to the Slytherin table.
”I will kill you, Harry James Potter”, Pansy hisses, grabbing his shirt again, but the back of it this time as she desperately hides behin him. ”
”Yeah, right, cute”, Harry repeats, clearing his suddenly dry throat.
Riddle hisses.
”Well… thanks”, Harry says awkwardly and holds his hand out to her with a blush. ”For all of it.”
”Harry Potter”, a small, scowling wizard brandishing a large camera yelps and hurtles through the crowd to grab Harry’s arm.
?” Harry says and the bord blinks calmly at him.
Mister Diggory and myself have gone to
only last summer that you would do your outmost to make sure that he wouldn’t be—!”
”No, no, no…” the blonde keeps muttering frantically.
”Are you ready, Harry?”
”Come now, Dumbledore!” Fudge splutters. ”Is this positive prejudice, because of your acquaintance with Hagrid? You know, they don’t
”Are you seriously suggesting that Harry’s patronus
He’s still frustrated with him the next day and it reaches a boiling point when he stands by the Common Room exit, impatiently shifting his weight from foot to foot as he waits for the blonde to join him. Draco’s harried gaze keeps flitting over to him and he even begins to stand up slowly, even as he keeps scribbling furiously on whatever essay he’s writing.
”Draco…” Harry murmurs. ”Can I… I really want to…”
Across the dorm, Crabbe and Goyle are taking turns to glare daggers in Draco’s direction whilst muttering darkly to each other, nodding their heads and cracking their knuckles.
”Eh?” Hagrid says a little too casually. ”Oh tha’… tha’s just… er…”
Lockhart finally lets Harry up and claps him on the shoulder with a grin and a wink. Harry glares back and rubs the side of his face that had been pressed against the cold, dirty floor… Then, remembering Lockhart’s sweaty palm pushing against the other side of his face, he rubs that too.
”Can I become an animagus?”
The caretaker immediately scowls suspisciously, but Snape glances at the clock quickly and seems to stifle a curse.
On the last day of the holidays, the last person Harry would expect to show up at the cottage raps on the front door and glares back at them from the other side of the threshold when Remus opens it.
”YOU!” the man in the armchair suddenly shrieks and Harry jumps again. ”
”Not in the last five years!” Seamus insists. ”And trust me, this is our year! You just wait and see!”
Maybe it’s the accumulated weight of all the looks and comments he’s received since his name came out of the Goblet of Fire that has been piling on to him, or maybe it’s the fact that even Ludo Bagman seems so sure that he’ll fail that he was willing to compromise his reputation, and maybe even his job, by offering Harry help, but whatever the reason, Harry is starting to feel a rather mutinous sense of defiance like a small but steady flame in the pit of his stomach.
”How was Ancient Runes?” Blaise asks the three newcomers.
The blonde’s crazed eyes swivel over to him and he frowns incredulously, the pink note crumbling in his fist on the table. Harry sighs.
”, Harry insists and looks up finally. ”Not just because it’s Draco. Wouldn’t you still think so even if you didn’t know who made them? If you saw this”, he tilts the book up, showing them a particularly detailed drawing of Harry and Seamus playing Exploding Snap in the Common Room. ”Framed on a wall somewhere, or in a book, and you had no idea who’d made it, wouldn’t you still think it was really good?”
Harry remembers Remus telling him that Sirius had stuck pictures of muggle women on his bedroom walls, but he never said they’d be so…
”Do you like it?” Sirius asks tentatively. ”We can take it back if you don’t, they gave me a receipt and said it guarantees an exchange, so if we go together you can pick out something else you like better… but I thought it was a nice colour, and most of the other jumpers had writings on them…”
”Ah, the Hungarian Horntail”, Bagman says and gives an exaggerated shudder, then winks at Harry.
” she says harshly. ”What she wrote about you showing signs of a pathological co-dependency that a child could only develop under the most extreme emotional living conditions, I mean even if you
, Harry thinks in surprise, the many memories of Granger acting strangely around him and the weird conversation he’d had with her in Grimmauld Place last summer flashing into his mind.
”What’s
”You are the Potter boy”, the centaur says after a moment’s awkward silence, his sapphire eyes darting to the scar on Harry’s forehead. ”You had better get back to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time, especially for you… Can you ride? It will be quicker that way… May name is Firenze, by the way.”
Snape lets out a frustrated sigh and grabs him again, except gentler this time. Harry clutches the sleeve of his robe and leans into him until he’s sure his legs will carry him.
Quidditch practise doesn’t feel as important anymore, not even to Harry. After everything that’s happened so far this year, the idea of winning the Quidditch Cup doesn’t seem nearly as life-altering.
”Little Miss Prissy here was just about to tell me when you arrived”, Skeeter says acidly, taking a large gulp of her butterbeer, her sly eyes sliding from Harry to Draco. ”So are the two of you official now? How does your family feel about that, Draco? Do they appr—?”
”Coffee, please…”
Looking between the two of them and noticing the family resemblance for the first time, Harry realises this must be one of Ron’s older brothers…
Remus sinks down on the edge of the bed with a sigh, but waits patiently for Harry to finish reading.
Ron bats Harry’s hands away from him and pins him with a furious look, pointing a finger over his shoulder in Draco’s direction.
— which is a drawing of Draco himself, sitting hunched over at a desk and writing something with a quill, looking almost transparent as a ghost in the flood of sunlight streaming in through the large window in front of him.
Draco just shakes his head, doubled over as he is, trying to catch his breath.
”You know your dad doesn’t want—”
”Calm down, Moony”, Sirius soothing voice interrupts the tirade finally. ”No-one was hurt… it’s over now…”
, of all things! If anyone heard about a monster hidden at the castle and decided to find and befriend it, it would be the half-giant…
”Yes…” Harry mutters. ”You want to tell me why?”
The choked gasp behind Harry tells him that Draco has seen the message as well and when the other boy inches closer to him, Harry curls his arm around his waist and pulls him against his side gently.
”Nothing. He’s going to make sure all the students are safely evacuated from the castle in the morning, just like he said in the Common Room, and then he’s going to contact Dumbledore and tell him everything… But by then it might be too late for the Weasley girl, won’t it? All night in the Chamber with a basilisk? I don’t know what Snape’s thinking…”
He has to keep the quill moving. If he stops, if he so much as pauses, there is no way he’ll be able to start again, no matter what Toad Face says or threatens him with. He’ll break down then — she’ll have broken him — and he won’t give her that satisfaction.
”Nothing to worry about”, he says pleasantly. ”Now… to our new students, I would like to say,
, that could take forever, he thinks in frustration. But trust the gryffindor girl to still have some faith in the adults of the world.
The ghost of a young girl suddenly soars up from the cubicle and hovers near the ceiling, staring down at him through tear-swollen eyes.
Finally, he reaches a door at the end of the corridor and his heart begins to hammer harder and harder as he stares at the door handle.
He stands shivering for a moment, listening to the silence. He knows the voice is right, but he doesn’t want it to be, doesn’t want to think of it that way.
”Yes, Sir”, Harry says diplomatically as he turns back to Dumbledore.
”Why didn’t you go to Professor Snape?” Sirius asks.
Comments are love.
”, Harry grouses back.
”Tease”, Harry mutters, but keeps smiling as he sits up to join Draco in having a look at the small pile of presents at the foot of the bed.
”What?”
”We were just —” he starts to speak, but Draco is already turning away.
problem?” Draco demands, finally putting the paper down again.
, he reminds himself. And there’s no way he could make Vaisey the Seeker, he’d have to make him a Chaser.
”Not that clever”, Draco mutters with a frown.
The woman’s wide mouth stretches into another awful grin.
They keep flying as the sun sets and don’t stop until it’s got too dark to see properly. Harry races Draco to the ground and touches down first, cheering triumphantly while lighting his wand with a
”I promise you, you’ll be fine.”
”You…” Harry starts, but cuts himself off awkwardly.
”Ye-eah — I-I know”, Harry says again.
”I’m fine”, he says quickly. ”How are you guys?”
”That’s good”, Draco says, turning away. ”Come on, let’s go get breakfast!”
”Luck, really”, Harry mutters. ”He wanted to duel with me, but of course I didn’t stand a chance… which was the whole point, I think… but then, something weird happened, some weird spell that made our wands connect… it was enough to distract him for a few seconds, so I could run back to the portkey.”
”Yeah, nothing, ehm… Important…” Harry says, feeling a fresh layer of cold sweat break out along his hair line.
Harry looks down at the brand new broomstick and fingers the golden letters morosely, ”But the letter from Hogwarts said —”
Black dots erupt in the corners of his eyes and slowly seep into his vision like spilling ink, until there is nothing but darkness, and the only thing he can think of, the one thought that reaches him in the vaccuum is… ”
”Oh yeah”, Harry says and shifts on the bed, tucking his legs under him. ”Yeah, like I said, I was raised by my muggle relatives so, obviously, not by them… I met both of them in Third Year for the first time, Mister Lupin was our DADA teacher — one of my favourite teachers, actually — he even gave me private lessons, taught me to conjure a Patronus so I could fight off Dementors—”
”This is fancy…” Sirius comments idly, holding the tie pin up into the light from the window.
”I’m fine, Harry”, Remus says with a tired smile. ”Or I will be, at any rate…”
”And I should warn you, Mister… Harry… Even if you’re fast learner, it might still take time. You have to understand that several aspects of this operation is reliant on chance alone… For instance, the both of you will need to be asleep at the same time for the connection to even be there… But it also requires Potter’s mind to be open, in order for him to recieve the message on his end… And”, the man adds, looking decidedly sour. ”Considering how inept Mister Potter is at intentionally
”You don’t have to eat anything you don’t want”, Harry says quickly. ”But I made the treacle tart, so have to try that!”
He’s so engrossed in his glum musings about it as he’s decorating the wall above his four poster bed later that evening, that it takes him a good while before the tension in the room fully registers with him and even then it takes him another moment to figure out the source of it. But once he does, he’s amazed he didn’t spot it immediately.
there? That will take us
”Are you okay?” He asks, taking half a step closer to the other boy.
”Nothing!” Harry snaps, then tilts his head back with a sigh. ”Merlin, I hope the Sorting is quick, I’m starving…”
” before Remus shushes him.
Harry is momentarily distracted by Granger giving his arm an insistent pull and turns to look at her, half-listening as she hiss in his face about
No matter the circumstances, even if his daddy has been furious with him, whenever he’s locked those arms around him and thrust his face into the crook of Harry’s neck, any tension that might have been in the man’s body a moment before would drain out of him immediately. If it would have been physically possible, they probably would have melted together… But not now.
”Ah, that’s right, I almost forgot… you don’t like the Dementors, do you, Albus?”
Raising his wand once more, Voldemort conjures a shapeless silvery substance that soars through the air and latches onto Wormtail’s bleeding stump. Within seconds, it reshapes itself into a sleek palm and finally four fingers and a thumb sprouts out it. Wormtail gasps, but this time in relief and wonder as he holds up his new hand and moves the finger experimentally.
Draco finally turns to meet Harry’s gaze and his grin shrinks sligthly, but not entirely.
”Yeah”, Harry mutters with a half-hearted glare. ”You scared the shi- erm, I mean, you
The hunger that’s been steadily making itself known since his shower, is finally reaching undeniable proportions around lunch time and he’s debating with himself whether he should go and check out the kitchens, maybe see if Dobby works there in this world as well and get himself some pie or something, when the bed hangings are suddenly pulled aside to reveal one stony-faced Draco Malfoy staring down at him.
carriage?”
”Harry, when we spoke yesterday, you promised me you’d get the situation with Umbridge under control and now —”
”Mister Black, I assure you — quite safe —”
”No, not the real Moody — Barty Crouch Jr., when he was impersonating Moody, last year — he transformed Draco into a ferret, then he made him bounce up and down on the floor —
Harry hangs back in the doorway and watches warily as the two men shake hands, before Remus takes a seat next to Sirius on the sofa and receives a quick kiss on the cheek.
”, Harry exclaims.
”On the count of three we will cast our first spells. Neither of us will be aiming to kill, of course!”
”You’re going to have to go back to Hogwarts a few days earlier, okay?”
”I’m happy for you”, Draco murmurs, his smile twitching as he gives his own letter a small wave. ”My parents can’t make it.”
“Not long”, Blaise says, nodding to Harry. “ You should get going, it will kick in before you get there.”
”Father made me leave it at home”, Draco mutters. ”I told him there was no reason to buy it, if I couldn’t even use it until next year, that we might as well wait until the next model comes out… But then I won’t have a broom to fly during Christmas hols, so we decided to get it after all.”
Harry!” Draco implores him. ”What if Voldemort meant for you to see that, just so you’d go charging into the Department of Mysteries? What if it’s a
, is it?”
”Yeah…” he says slowly.
”Well, it matters to them…” Sirius says, pulling a face that suggests he, like Harry, couldn’t give a damn about theirs or anyone’s bloodline. ”They’re traditionalists, like my family was… Which means they probably have some deal with another pureblood family in regards to Draco’s… Future…”
That seems to jostle her out of her stupor, because with a sudden jerk she staggers back a step and blinks furiously.
Harry isn’t the only one who thinks so either. At the end of their last DADA lesson of the year, when Remus thanks them all for their hard work and tells them how much he has enjoyed being their professor, however briefly, several of Harry’s classmates asks him if he’ll be back next year.
”Twelve”, Remus says, rifling through his pockets.
, full stop”, Pansy cuts in and nods towards Draco. ”I thought maybe your parents finally got her sacked…”
The portrait of Amando Dippet’s snores seem to stick in his throat and he blinks, clearly offended, but catches himself and prompty goes back to pretending to sleep.
Harry saw it escape…
”Where’s dad?” Harry asks curiously.
Harry sighs.
, a cold voice pipes up at the back of his mind.
”Early June”, Draco says quietly.
”I…” Harry hesitates, looking over at Draco for support.
Harry shoots her a look, then flicks the pages a little quicker until he gets to seventeen and spots the headline: ”
”, Granger hisses, her hair getting frizzier as if to make a point.
Harry squirms uncomfortably in his seat. He’s used to people talking about him, but they’re usually doing it behind his back… Trust his team mates to do it right in front of him…
He’s aware of the sidelong look Draco throws him and knows the blonde must have spotted the pair as well. He avoids meeting his gaze, for fear of bursting out into giggles and embarrassing his dads.
”We’ve been sitting here for too long. I can’t think anymore”, Draco continues in a rush, piling his books in a toppling pile and Harry sags with relief. ”The brain best retains information reviewed at the beginning and end of a session, so to best utilise one’s study time is to segment it, that way you increase your chances of remembering what you’ve read…” Harry shoots the other boy a glum glare. ”Harry? Are you even listening to me?”
”So you’re dad’s an animagus too?”
The blonde moves around him, smoothly manoeuvring them both so that Harry stands facing the party, with his back to the window. They sip their drinks and talk. It’s not exactly small talk, but Harry can’t help but notice that the blonde is skirting away from any and all topics of conversation that could be considered serious. However, he’s more than happy to avoid them all himself and keep things light, so he doesn’t draw attention to it.
” Blaise shouts from outside the bed-hangings that are drawn on the other side of the bed.
”It’s just…” Harry mumbles. ”Thinking about what it would have been like… Finally getting back here and…”
”What?”
it doesn’t have to for us to step in. Do you understand? You need only signal that you wish to stop and I — we — will come to your aid. No-one will think any less of you, okay?… Harry?…
”What?” Harry blurts out. ”We’re not going to—?”
”You are friends vit her, no?”
”Oh, right, yeah I can do that—”
”Potter fought!” Moody continues happily. ”He fought it and he damn near beat it too! We’ll try that again, Potter, and the rest of you, pay attention — watch his eyes, that’s where you see it — very good, Potter, very good indeed! They’ll have trouble controlling you all right! Now, ready—?”
”He gave you a book?” Sirius says sceptically.
”It’s nothing.”
— and — and — and I don’t know, I don’t know what you see him at all, to be honest, but you get my point —”
”Exactly!” Granger huffs, shooting the twins a disapproving glare.
”Any others?” Crouch says.
”What —!” Flint gasps and is immediately hushed by Adrian who is, as always, squeezed into his side on one of the sofas.
”I saw… Ehm… Draco”, Harry says, then immediatly curses himself.
After they’ve finished the tour of the dungeons, they head back upstairs and then spend the rest of the morning walking around outside. Harry shows his dads the Durmstrang ship and then takes them to Hagrid’s hut to show them the Beauxbatons carriage and the large horses as well.
”Should we speak in private?” Remus asks quietly and Harry looks over in time to see his gaze flit away from him and back to Professor Snape.
Now that the dragon has been removed from the enclosure, Harry can see the raised seats draped in gold where the five judges are sitting.
”I’m still not talking to you”, he mutters finally.
Mrs Weasley finally lets go of them and Draco slumps against Harry’s side. Harry awkwardly removes the sword and the Sorting Hat from his waistband and hands them over to Dumbledore. The old wizard accepts them with a surprised look. Harry swallows thickly… Then looks at Draco.
The giggles immediately quiet down and the excitement of earlier fizzles as they all exchange uncomfortable looks.
”Was that necessary?” Remus asks his husband quietly.
”What, I’m serious. Half the school thinks you can control a secret monster. I’m covered until graduation!”
He finally closes his bag and slings it onto his back, then jogs to catch up to Harry.
Harry and Draco exchange an excited look.
Ron is standing in the middle, even taller and ganglier than the last time Harry saw him, grinning proudly and holding up his pet rat Scabbers in one hand and waving furiously with the other. Next to him stands his only sister Ginny, also waving but not as ferociously as the rest of her family and she also keeps shaking her hair into her face as though hoping to hide it.
”Professor Snape dropped by earlier”, Draco mumbles. ”With the murtlap.”
Raising his wand, Harry bellows, ”
”Can you imagine… if we all had Firebolts when we play Gryffindor next month”, Seamus says wistfully.
The toothless old landlord and barman is deep in conversation with a wizard sipping something that looks even stronger than butterbeer, Harry can see. The both of them huddled close, heads close together across the bar. But as Remus steps out into the dim light, with Harry close on his heel, he straightens up and gives them an expectant, almost hopeful look.
Briefly the memory of Remus’ disapproving eyes across the kitchen table breaks through, and the heavy feeling of shame that Harry had stubbornly tried to push down at the time.
The shadowed person gets closer and closer to him and Harry tenses his muscles, readying himself for a fight or —
He’s thought about Malfoy’s offer a lot. Not that he’d ever consider taking him up on the offer of staying at Manor, but he’s thought about just writing him — and Granger — just for something to help pass the time but also to keep him sane amongst the doilies and muggle TV quiz shows, by reminding him that
”Yeah, exactly”, Harry says confidently, leading the way inside the greenhouse and finding a free space by one of the benches. ”Riddle cares about trophies and he cares about pureblood lineage or whatever, obviously he’s going to want to get his hands on that ring and necklace… I just don’t get why it’s important that
Harry turns his head around instinctively to see a bushy mane of mousy-brown hair bob its way back through the crowd and disappear into the Entrance Hall again, his eyes locking briefly with Ron Weasley’s before he looks away again.
The next morning, Harry wakes up feeling slightly better about the previous night. Yes, they had been caught by Professor Snape and landed themselves in detention. But considering they were almost eaten alive by a giant, three-headed dog and narrowly escaped unscathed, Harry isn’t all that fussed about it.
”Are you almost done?”
”You know James didn’t get his big growth spurt until fifth year”, Sirius adds, beginning to clear the first course off the table.
”Wh- What do you m-mean?”
”Maybe you should ask her to dance”, he suggests lightly taking his drink back from Draco and sipping from it to hide his mischievous smile, just before Pansy forces her gaze away from Granger again.
— and next to the Sorting Hat, mounted inside a glass case, is the large sword that Harry pulled out of the Hat when he was fighting the basilisk inside the Chamber of Secrets in Second Year.
”It’s a Grindylow”, Remus tells him. ”You’re going to learn all about them in a few weeks…”
”Do not worry, Harry…” Dumbledore says with a hint of affection. ”This time you shall enter the Pensieve with me and, even more unsually, with permission.”
masks…”
”Don’t ever do that to me again”, the man murmurs thickly, and Harry nods.
”Get up”, Snape snarls, grabbing him by the arm and pulling him roughly to his feet.
”It won’t — work — the water —” Draco pants as Harry pulls him along.
”Yes, yes…
”That’s a very poetic way of saying
When he tells Professor Snape at breakfast, the man doesn’t appear concerned at all. He just reminds Harry that it was his first attempt and that
He strides over to the door directly opposite them, figuring just because the wall didn’t start spinning in his dream doesn’t mean this still isn’t the door they need to go through.
”Daddy…”
”Yeah”, he says curtly, dropping the trunk with a loud
Harry rubs the sleep from his eyes, then pushes the glasses onto his face and squints up at the other boy happily. His blonde hair is slightly mussed and his eyes are still a little swollen, but the small smile that he sends Harry’s way makes Harry tingle all over and he beams back.
”I’m fine”, Harry says dully. ”Just tired…”
”What’s that?” Remus asks curiously. ”Did he make you another drawing?”
”Rise and shine, runty!” the man exclaims and hands him his glasses.
”What are you talking about?” Harry demands nonplussed.
fault—!” Harry snaps, throwing his hands up in exasperation and then catching himself just in time and adds a hurried
”There’s… one… more thing”, Harry says quietly, pulling his hands out from under his daddy’s.
”Oi—!” Seamus protests loudly, grabbing lumps of frosting from his head and flicking it on the ground.
”Headmaster”, Harry replies curtly, then looks over at his Head of House and allows himself a tiny flicker of a smile after all. ”Sir…”
”Pucey and Higgs?” Sirius says. ”Don’t think you’ve mentioned them?”
Another look passes between the two grown men and Harry frowns. The amusement, or whatever it had been, that had glittered in both men’s eyes only a moment ago is now nowhere to be seen. If anything, a sense of foreboding has settled over the kitchen like a heavy blanket.
He shakes his head again.
” Harry exclaims in frustration. ”Quidditch? I guess I’m a decent flier? But a fat lot of help —”
”Better him than us”, Draco says again.
”What?”
… copy this down.”
”I think so! The smallest bottle will get us through the black fire!”
Harry shakes his head stubbornly,
Harry glances back over at the half-giant and winces. Not only are both his eyes black and swollen, but the rest of his face seems to be covered in cuts and bruises as well.
go through his transformation alone. The only reason he is right now — on Christmas, no less — is because of Harry, and that makes him feel awful.
Some of the teachers exchange worried looks, others look confused or irritated. Finally, McGonagall arrives and a hush immediately spreads through the room.
She might as well has stabbed him in the chest with her fork, it probably would have felt much the same, Harry thinks as he stares down at his overflowing plate and counts mechanically from ten in his head for a second time.
”One question… What about that house-elf?”
Professor Snape’s dark eyes linger on Harry as he trails off, and Harry tenses up, steeling himself for — something — he isn’t sure, but Professor Snape merely frowns at him, then turns away with a dramatic swirl of robes and barks at the class to get their cauldrons out.
”Harry”, Lupin calls. ”It’s almost time.”
his dad had said whilst holding onto the tire he was sitting on and pullling it, him, up up up and then letting go.
”Harry, calm down…” Sirius says firmly and grabs him by the shoulders and steers him over to the bed and gently pushes him to sit on the edge, then crouches in front of him. ”Tell me slowly, from the beginning, what happened…”
”How are you feeling?” the man repeats firmly.
His heart is pounding furiously in his chest and the slimy stuff Professor Snape gave him seems to be melting  inside his fist.
”Well, I… I mean… I’m a Parselmouth like him, I guess.”
Another rare sigh escapes the older man and with a weary
”It was great to see you, runt”, the man rumbles, giving the top of his head a quick peck. ”But give the rule-breaking a rest for a while now, all right?”
”What?” Harry and Pansy echo each other worriedly, both watching the blonde warily as he glares down at the paper.
”Oh…” Pansy leans back again with a frown. ”Well, I don’t exactly know that yet…”
He is still the Team Captain though, so he knows he needs to keep up appearances for the sake of his team mates who
Harry blinks in surprise,
”You’ll have to”, he says finally. ”But you’ll have to wait outside while I run into the office…”
Draco flinches back and stares at him in surprise. Harry blinks rapidly, his face falling.
”This is brilliant!” Harry gushes. ”But why would you give it to
”What else would it be?” Harry counters. ”A subtle request that I bring some with me?”
Umbridge ignores his comment and continues talking to him with her unnecessarily loud and slow voice and even starts using some sign language of her own to illustrate her points. Harry can only stare in disbelief, while Pansy and Daphne dissolve into peels of giggles next to him and Draco muffles his own snickers against his shoulder, all of them earning cold, furious glares from Granger.
Harry’s mind flashes back to that morning in the Common Room when he woke up to Pansy standing over him and screeching, demanding to know why he and Draco were sleeping together…
”That explains so much — how’d you find out?”
Draco quickly schools his face into a neutral mask once more and asks him what his dads had said about it, so Harry tells him the rest and the other boy nods, mumbling he’s happy they worked it out.
”Harry, I’m so s-sorry — I swear I d-didn’t m-mean to, Riddle made me do it —!”
”Yes?” Harry prods. ”Is that it?”
”Hiya, Harry”, Ron says awkwardly.
the smirk in its tone.
”All right —”
”She —
”All right… see you in a bit!” Sirius says, striding round the table to give Harry a rather forceful peck on the forehead, before he quickly turns on the spot and Disapparates.
The fleet of little boats move together as one and sets off across the lake.
”Really?” Harry more or less whines. ”But I just had a bad dream…”
”Harry, you fancy a game of Exploding Snap before dinner?” Seamus says.
”You’re sure you had nothing to do with the swamp in my office?”
. Some man they once knew who disappeared… His daddy said he’d been an animagus, that he could transform into a rat at will, and dad was sure Ron’s pet rat Scabbers was that man… And judging by his dad’s anger, they can’t have been on good terms with the man before he disappeared either…
with the deepest loathing —
Harry nods, but quickly regrets it as it makes the pain in his head flare up again. Sirius gently grabs his arms and helps him to sit, watching him worriedly.
”I eh… Wouldn’t know”, Harry says shrewdly. ”I don’t really hang out with the team all that much anymore, I guess I miss flying more than anything… It always used to help clear my head, you know?”
Harry blinks in confusion and is about to sit up, when the other boy pounces on him just as suddenly and excitedly again. He just as time to register a small glass phial in his hand, before he’s being kissed senseless again and everything but that melts away. He’s aware of Malfoy doing something, but he’s not sure what and he doesn’t much care as long as his lips are on Harry’s and his hand is…
to defeat Voldemort.”
”Oh”, Hagrid says dully. ”Dunno. He wouldn’ take his cloak off and he had his hood pulled down over ’is face… Nothin’ unusual abou’ tha’ though… Yeh get all sorts in the Hog’s Head…”
this?” Draco asks, his eyes narrowing futher, looking from Harry to Seamus. ”Is this some kind of ridculous show of ultramasculinity—?”
He flips open the book eagerly to see if his hunch is true… The very first page has a drawing on it that is identical to the illustration on the front cover, except more rich in details and with a lot more depth due to the shading… Harry doesn’t know much about art, or specifically drawing, but he can tell that there is definitely some talent behind this. But then again, maybe he’s just biased. Because even though he’s never actually seen Draco with a pencil, there’s something about this drawing that reminds him of the Christmas card Draco made him three years ago which makes him certain that Draco has made this as well.
Harry takes the seat next to him and hunches down as low as he’s able, giving the other boy a discreet glare that goes completely ignored.
”No?” Harry echoes in surprise.
”Yes, we acquired it in very peculiar circumstances. I remember it was brought in by a young witch just before Christmas, oh, many years ago now. She said she needed the gold badly, well, that much was obvious… She was covered in rags and pretty far along with child. She said the locket had once belonged to Slytherin—”
Dumbledore, Harry”, Remus chastisises him gently, then sighs and puts his mug down on the bedside table again, then turns to face Harry more fully. ”And yes. In fact, he has already offered me the post permanently.”
”It is
He’s received cards from both the Weasley family and Granger again, and also from Hagrid (fortunately unaccompanied by biting literature this time),  Colin Creevey and half the Slytherins in his own year and above, including his closest friends Seamus, Blaise and Theodore, who have all included small gifts.
Professor Dumbledore claps his hands, creating a sort of ripple effect of applause all along the Head Table, but none as polite and enthusiastic as Dumbledore. In fact, Professor Snape only lets the palms of his hands touch twice before he promptly places them on either side of his plate again.
”Don’t worry about it being too advanced for you”, Snape says suddenly. ”I will help you grasp the principles and after that, it’s just down to practice and discipline… I realise your lack of focus will put you at a disadvantage—”
He leans forward and grabs the artefact he’d put down on the table when Harry joined them and pulls it back into his lap. Harry leans a little closer and frowns at it.
”No”, Dumbledore says. ”But my guess is that the real Moody is somewhere in this office… he would have needed to keep him close, so that he could continue to brew the Polyjuice potion…”
”Ah, Sir, ask no more, ask no more”, the elf stammers, staring back at him in horror. ”Dark deeds are planned in this place, but Harry Potter must not be here when they happen. Go home, Harry Potter, please go home! Harry Potter must not meddle in this, Sir, it is too dangerous —”
Draco pulls him towards a small circular table at the back, where the light from the windows doesn’t quite reach, even though they’re the only couple in the teashop. If Harry were to hazard a guess, he’d say they’d only just opened because the shopkeeper, a wizard in his mid- to late thirties who appears at their table and greets them glumy before lighting the candle on their table and handing them a couple of menues, looks like he’s just rolled out of bed. Harry smiles and thanks him.
”It’s not me, is it?” Harry grins playfully, but he still feels a small twinge of something less than pleasant when the girl simply rolls her eyes at the question.
older! Adult!”
”Yeah”, Harry says impatiently, rubbing his hands over his face. ”I get it… all right, then… let’s do it…”
Finally finding a somewhat rumpled quill and a blank scrap of parchment, Harry quickly scribbles out his reply.
Harry looks back over his shoulder to see Sir Cadogan trip over his own feet and land in a sprawling heap in the middle of a nest of startled Horklumps. He flops onto his back and pushes the visor onto his head, gasping for breath and shouting after them.
”But there are
Harry ignores him, however. He’s too caught up in the incredulous look Draco is giving him.
Hagrid manages to tie a rope around the Skrewts stinger, but nearly gets stung as something just outside the garden catches his attention and distracts him.
you? — we’re doing thestrals today—!”
The station clock tells them they have five minutes to get to platform nine and three quarters. Sirius parks the bike and helps Harry climb out of the sidecar, then steers him towards the entrance of the station firmly, saying there’s no time to get a trolley, ”Just leave the trunk as it is for now and then ask one of the older students or a teacher to unshrink it for you, alright?”
The oak front doors open and the Durmstrang students march inside lead by Karkaroff, looking as smarmy as ever in his fur-lined robes. Harry’s eyes immediately dart to Krum at the front of the group. He, like all the other boys from Durmstrang, is wearing blood red robes lined with dark brown fur, a stark contrast to the light blue robes of the petite girl hanging off his arm. Harry doesn’t recognise her and thinks she must be a Beauxbatons…
In the remaining two days leading up to the First Task, the anti-Harry campaign seems to double its effort and even though Diggory and his closest friends in Hufflepuff (who were the ones who used to quote the
at the kitchen table keep flashing in his mind and he realises he needs to let them know that it’s not true, that he didn’t say any of those things; in fact he didn’t say anything at all — all he said was ”er” and ”ehm” — that stupid quill made up the rest!
“You owe me an extra song at Christmas. And chocolate.”
You’re just going to get Mr. Liogell to handle it aren’t you? No driving test. Just Goblin administrative work and fees.
“You two are unbelievable. I’ll confess, it smells wonderful though.”
OMG. The art collection. Everyone was blown away. Those block prints on the second floor were my favourites.
Sigh.
“I don’t.”
How long to get them seated? We’re still getting dressed and I need to stick-charm the jewels.
And another thing! What’s up with a different outfit for everything? FOUR DIFFERENT SETS OF ROBES???
UGH. Now our family is going to look even more bizarre. I’m in a relationship with my new Son-In-Laws Father. Yeah, I guess we’ll see how Grimmauld turns out. I’m pretty excited to get started working on it. And Draco’s ready to practically GUT the cottage.

“Go through that set of doors, I’ll venture that there are plates and linens. Don't bring out the good china.”
“It was obviously Ron and Hermione, WHO ELSE WOULD IT HAVE BEEN???? Those three had their photographs plastered EVERYWHERE! Care to explain THAT my dear Godfather?”
Love you to infinity, times a million plus three.
—————————————————————————
Congratulations again. How did Harry react?
Well, are you? And also, my interview with the boys will come out before this one and they have explained the baby situation in that interview. So our readers already will know about how that’s going to happen.
“That would be nice. Something at least. . . . . . I know, how about a game show?”
She did the same kind of thing with Poppy when she was in school. Interned in the infirmary with Poppy. She was really good at it.
“Susan is telling me that we made more change in a couple hours than has been done in years.”
“UGH!”
The other showing of wands is different, and may surprise many. Harry’s wand is presented along with that of Draco. With the explanation that has been rumoured about, but until now never confirmed. The wand of Draco Malfoy (Malfoy-Potter) was used by Harry in the final battle. This is known but rarely spoken of, and completely ignored in history texts. The story of how the wand was acquired and its alliance is finally put to rest in Harry’s own words. A separate report on this finding will be published at a later time.
Headlines.
“Yes. I’ll run back to my place and write it up. Give me 30 minutes?”
Please.
“It’s a ring. Please accept it.”
Do you know about the knockturn strip club?
You’ll clean up just fine, don’t worry about it. Hannah’s coming too right?
“I’ll meet you there.”
“Narcissa scares the fuck out of me, but yes?”
“Well it definitely needs to be preserved as an example of something. A sadistic architectural relationship if nothing else.”
Okay so beach party! Saturday? Time?
Yes, thank you. This is going to get them off our backs at least for a little while. And yes, Louis actually should have something unique that sets him apart from the others. Quite fitting for him.
“I’ll make an emergency Portkey out of something, do you have the exact coordinates to your office?”
Hey Butterbean?
And his work on potions research with Scorp. They’re on the verge of major breakthroughs. Life saving potions that can be shared with Muggles!
. . . . . . . . . .
So here’s the deal. You all know that I’m really busy here at the sanctuary and can’t come visit very often. That’s true. But part of that is also because I have a boyfriend. We’ve been together for a little over a year. I KNOW. We live together. He’s really cool and sweet and smart and I really like him a lot. It’s kinda serious. It’s just that I’ve not said anything and I was nervous about it because he’s different. I feel pretty terrible about it because I lost faith in myself and all of you guys over it and I’m really sorry. Dad hates the term but I’m going to use it. Squib. He has no magic. He’s not a muggle, he comes from a magic family. Just born without it. He works at the sanctuary with us. I’m bringing him with me for the meetings. We’re staying at Mom & Jerry’s. His name is Eric, you might have noticed the random name included on the letter. He signed the agreement and everything. Dad even sent a separate letter for him so he can come. And so that’s what I have to say. And I’m really sorry for keeping this from you, but I was worried and for some reason scared about it. I’m now more embarrassed about keeping it from you and you can all hex me now.
“No that place is going to be too gross and gloomy. Wait until you see it Draco, It’s seriously depressing. I suppose we could go to the manor if it turns out it’s okay there. If not I’m not sure. Don’t want to do it here at the cottage, I plan to be already working on the clear out by then.”
Danika = Occamy
“That’s doable. Match the stonework on the townhouses.”
“I saw a little of that yesterday.”
“It was in my gift closets! I’m never not prepared. You, Mother and the kids practically have their own wing!”
. . . . . . . . . .
“What NOW?!”
I have an idea, but let’s talk about it over dinner.
Place cards and seating assignments. Escort to the table. That sounds like a RIOT! YES LET’S DO THAT!
You’re just downstairs Potter!
And I plan to keep it that way. It’s a slippery slope. Wexcel is the Wizarding version of a Muggle spread sheet software.
“I can’t do it.”
“This looks GREAT!”

Here’s my copy/paste: The Mugwump can resolve conflicts within the Wizengamot when there’s not a majority and consult with any of us, including myself if they feel that a decision may not be in the best interests of the public or the magical community at large. The Mugwump can put a hold on decisions or legislation for a period of time while either conflicts can be resolved, or if I do something really dumb.
“We thought they moved away.”
All the same?
You may also bring Family members if you wish, however we would recommend limiting the attendance to around 10-15 persons as the space is limited. If more attendees are required we would need to open the ceremony to the public venue, and we believe your intention is to keep said ceremony as private as possible.
WHAT?
Harry is in big trouble.
“Oh. The portraits are all going though. Narcissa is taking them to the manor.”

Loves you with no reservations . . . . . .
“US?”
“UGH.”
“I did.”

“Where are you?”
Something a little calmer for mid-week.
LOL! You’re BOTH lying! I know you two and EVERYONE has been there.
And I know you can sing. You can team up with your buddy Jerry.
“Oh Merlin, Blaise. I’ve never seen him like this before.”
I tried teaching him the incantation. Sat him down at the kitchen table with a feather and showed him how to do it.
Did I tell you I’ve got my Gringotts guy looking into it?”
Isn’t that a given? We can speculate all we want.
It’s not a problem. I just need to get dried up.
How’s that? I went with silk in a subtle weaved stripe. My Mother taught me that transfiguration.
Rattlesnake (BOTH)
OMFG. PERFECT.
Yes you must!
“Jamie, I’m telling you this and not because you’re my Son. This broom is incredible. It’s ready. Don’t change a bristle. I want the Harpies fitted out with them before the season starts. Every team member including the reserves. You can introduce it on opening day. And I’m serious that I want a couple for myself and Draco. Ginny can you imagine Draco on this thing? Actually more . . . Make sure Minnie get’s one for sure . . . and Mum and Jerry for home . . . . . . Get this into production right away. Tell me anything you need to get it done. Draco will help too.”
What kind of items are we talking about?
“Technically, you could. . . . I take it that you approve then.
All in favour of the Legislation on the table raise your hand. . . . . . . And opposed? . . . .Very well. I would like the clerk to record the vote on the legislation entitled “The Repeal of Intentionally Vague Limitations on the Minister of Magic.” The vote is unanimous in favour of the Legislation.
Harry. You control the Wizengamot.
It’s supposed to be very different now. She wants to host the New Year.
“Practical research then.”
“He’s really serious about that?”
See you around 14:00 on Saturday.
Oh my gawd!
“These bigger pieces?”
Is there a connection?!! We have reached out to Mr. Potter and Malfoy for comment.
She can’t cook! I don’t think she even know’s what that is!
It’s never too early for a Luna update.
OH. He’s NOT kidding you guys. Have you ever been to Nev’s greenhouse?
c/o The Quibbler
Well, yeah. And the Lovegood-Longbottom’s.
I would like that Brock breakfast set that we got from my parents and copies of some more photos? Nothing else I can think of.
“What else is on this floor?”
“This one says Al’s first school day . . . . . . .
Thank you for all of your assistance with the events this coming Thursday. I’ve just met with Mr. McAlroy and I have a couple of requests. He’s going to need some assistance on the day of the event at the manor. Please do whatever you can for him:
“Amazing.”
“You’ve had them here in your vault all these years.”
Thanks. It feels good.
“Not today, boys.”
“My count so far is five.”
“He said that. 7 fucking AM! He’d better not think I’m going to start getting up that early. Just No.”
But it was my turn to curl up with Scorp!
“Cool!”
I think I’ll call a meeting Monday? I could do something quick in the snowflake or something. You’ll come won’t you? Help explain the process?
“Okay.”
I will.
Of course there is paperwork to reflect this. I have a copy in your Hogwarts student record:
“I don’t think so? You didn’t tell us what was off limits!”
“It really needs a good cleaning, mostly the glass and walls. You can see a lot of the staining on the tile work back there by the exhaust vents. A good cleaning and it would really sparkle.”
“How?”
Lucy can ride up front then. Want me to dress up with the cap?
“I haven’t seen evidence of any criminal potions.”
Sorry!
“•” . . . . . . .stuff the letter and portkey . . . . . .
Okay.
“Do you like the desk?”
“At this point no matter what we do it will be one.”
“Remember, I said they were colourful?”
Space planning.
“Where’s Grampa Harry?”
“Of course, I went overboard and rambled on forever trying to explain things.”
I could ask Seamus to come over and put up the child protection wards? She won’t even notice, and she won’t wander out of the areas you designate. Where's Jerry? He knows wards.
——————————————————————————
“Look!”
I should bring up something from the cellars. It think this calls for something special. What do you think darlings? The Dom Pérignon ’96?
Yes that will be excellent. Alright it’s a date then. I’ll let you go?
It’s done?!!!
Yes, and Mr. Malfoy is quite experienced in negotiating art prices. He is a world renowned collector. I have not experienced anything quite like it. He’s very shrewd.
“I like the salmon high tops. This had better not be a million galleon bottle of champagne.”
Yes, you’re right. Rosie too.
“Grampa Snape! This is the best parade ever!”
“I don’t want to.”

“He did.”

“I can have what you need delivered tomorrow.”
“. . . . . . . Built in 1724. . . . . Two storeys not including the attic and cellars. The main floor contains one single entry hall that opens to reveal this central rotunda. The exposed balconies overlooking from the above bedrooms level. The rotunda, with it’s glass domed ceiling is the core of the building.”
“There’s not a lot left really. I abandoned it pretty much after the yule ball. . . . . .”
Tell him we have a house account at the Muggle cleaners. Which is true BTW. Anything he’s questionable about goes there. Tell him it’s my responsibility to keep him looking impressive. . . “Business Expense”!!! “Cost of doing business”!!!
“Because it will cover up the swimsuit!”
OMG. I can’t wait for you to see her. She really does look just like baby Al with Scorp’s eyes. She calmed right down and took the bottle. Zebb and Poppy have gone over all of the feeding requirements. I forgot about that. It’s a little different.
“Wait . .slow down”.
“Well, let’s see then . . . . . for you . . . . .these grey trousers . . . . this lime green shirt with the ivory jumper. . . . . baby blue boxer briefs . . . . . I won’t bother with the socks because I know they’ll just change before breakfast anyhow . . . . . . but these black wing tips will go nicely with the trousers.”
Maybe we should leave it placed there then and you can do another for the top floor when it’s been finished? You’ll have a better idea once you’ve seen it?
The conversation was recorded weeks prior to publication and this is a transcript of the conversation.
Shite.
“I need to get some of that pasta salad before it’s gone.”
“Hey Ron! What did you name it?!”
Does anyone have ANY IDEA what the fuck the plan is?.
I don’t think it’s bad, but I’d still like you to come down here.
“Would you care to take the stairs or the elevator ma’am?”
“So it should be time for an update to the image on the card. That can be arranged. For now you are free to drive. You also still retain your license on the Isle of Man.”
“You haven’t met Louis yet?”
UGH! JUST A-K ME!
Gramps is going to get out his slide projector!
Tory and I met at social functions that you refused to go to. We were in the same school year.
The guy in the painting is Decram and he’s very excited for the party. Say hi and introduce yourself! He also knows where the bodies are buried so if you get lost seek him out. You might even run into Headmaster Snape in the potions lab!
“Not a skull in sight. Nope. Look in there. Nothing but some cruddy old empty shelves.”
I’m using a riesling for the syllabub. I’ll get some more pulled and chilled for us unless you’d like something else? Draco’s got mead happening for he and Ron.
For some reason I must formally announce that I am inviting guests to view the property and temporarily break the wards. The Fidelius remains in place. We ask that guests tour in shifts. This will also help as it will hopefully look like neighbors are having some sort of party, or wake as it were throughout the day. Muggle attire is requested.
“What brought this up?”
“And the towels.”
Yes! Get here!
More Goblin questions.
“Oh NO.”

Anytime before Thursday?
Have a good evening. Goodbye.
NOW??
Gringotts
“Okay.”
“I said we’d talk about it. Draco hasn’t even seen them yet.”
“Tomorrow after the cars?”
“Ummmm.”
At that time, whoever is the proxy for the Prince seat will vacate and Draco takes his seat. Harry has assured me that he has chosen a fabulous outfit for Draco. The proxy will be informed to take a seat in the observers gallery.
Do you know how MAD that makes his cousins?
This changes everything. And really Heraald isn’t much better! It’s harder to write! And to top it off my name now looks like a fucking LAWFIRM!
“Okay.”
The bloodied robes he was wearing when he was murdered, his wand. Personal grooming items and things like quills. I still have a lot of it in my vault. At the time I couldn’t have him buried because people were concerned with grave robbers. So I had him cremated, I kept his ashes in my vault for probably a couple years. McCull had the ashes too.
REALLY?
“Hey, thanks for what you said to Teddy earlier.”
“I guess so! Since everyone is here today it makes sense.”
So who’s left then?
“If I was doing that would I ask Trandy?”
Butterbean,
“No, I’m good with the coffee. Did you read this?”
NO. I will not release you alone in an automobile to terrorize London.
Probably. Especially if it involves his 3-D printer things.
“My nephew is a third year. Maxon Martinson. You know him?”
“So now we’re done. Hugo, you’re next!”
LOL and Hey Eric!
“Okay.”
I know!
Alright then, please carry on.
“I get that a lot. I’m from Basingstoke. My Grandparents’ Koi business is in Kobe. I relocated there around six years ago to learn the family trade, but I live here primarily now. A large portion of our business is here so I’m back and forth quite a lot.”
“We have an apothecary problem.”
“You and that wandless. You just decided to draw a blue sparkly line in the lawn. You just make up a spell to do what you want on the fly and go with it!”
ON IT!
He’s ready?
Perhaps you’re a seer and don’t know it? I have the impression that your prediction might come true? Maybe you should try tarot cards or tea leaves!
“You are correct, they will find it humorous. You have no previous driving violations. It is doubtful that you will be sent to prison for a questionable quaff.”
Can this stop?
“Is that my surprise?”
We’re going to the actual beach right?
“Free? That’s going to make potion people mad if they can’t sell it to the ministry program.”
“The kids are very close knit. You find yourself in a very unique position if they take you into their fold. It is more than rare. . . . They take their friendships very seriously. They bicker, but they don’t fight and it’s usually just poking fun at each other.”
When we advised both the Manager and Ministry officials that Our Readers deserve to know about the event, we were told again that the event is being covered exclusively by another publication! Again, RUDE!
Not much really. They just kept listing shit off. Over and Over and Over. Seats This. Title That. Vault There. And There. Oh and hey since we’re at it let’s just throw in a few manors, houses, a lodge and oh . . .here’s another Wizengamot Seat!
“MUM! Oh Merlin.”
“No. We know that.”
Made breakfast. Made Coffee and tea. Draco made biscotti. We’ve explored the library a little. Decided to become animagi together. About to go take a look at the progress on the park.
It’s a Narcissa Malfoy-Black original! We want it framed for over the fireplace at the new house.

“Cool! It’s a horse!”
Sometimes it feels that way. Seems like I’m the only one who really cares. It’s exhausting. But then all of a sudden there’s a photographer hiding around the corner and the next thing I know I can’t even have lunch with my daughter without it becoming a scandalous event. I really draw the line when it comes to the kids. They didn’t sign up for this (expletive). I’ve been working on fixing that.

You seem to think I’ve gone soft. Not going to work young man.

Friday morning revealed a complete makeover to the retail space. Resplendant in antique lighting viewed from the street. It seems the crews worked through the night to complete the endeavor. The entire building sparkling and lit. One can say the space conveys a light and cheerful ambiance, but also a classic sense of tradition from the street.

“I’ve worked it into your employment contract. There is a housing allowance evenly distributed based on the normal rental fees at the complex and on what would be considered a room rate for each individual. Those who don’t require housing receive the equivalent as additional salary that can be applied to their personal housing expenses. The compensation on that portion of the salary are then not taxable. Our Gringotts accountants handle all of these payroll issues for them on your behalf.”

Did you threaten them with another lawsuit?

Went AWESOME. Cemetery is building a custom columbarium I just need to tell them how many niches. It’s going to be outside on the grounds near the entrance. I picked a spot! It’s going to be black polished marble with each name carved into the niche covers. They’ll have it ready to go by Tuesday morning! Just need to give them the number of “interments” and a list. They even gave me a drawing that I can show Kreacher. They also told me about a ritual that they and Kreacher can perform at the house to transfer the heads directly to the columbarium!

We will. You’re right we should ask my Mother and Mrs. Weasley.
“Come outside and look up and down this street. What do you see?”
Yeah I asked for some help. I didn’t want your nice study ruined with a bunch of extraneous clutter. We hid all of the wires and your printer now looks like a fancy box thats inset into one of the bookcases. I’ve also upgraded you like I did Grayson. Proper keyboard etc. I’ve imported and linked everything from your computer at the Centre. They speak together now so you can work at either. You’re all set.
Yes that’s fine.
Got it.
“Leave it. Let them see what she did.”
I’d like to put a few rumors to rest and perhaps confirm one that has been floating around on another news source.
Not an error. The name is hyphenated.
“Good weird though?”
“Yes. Does it scare you that it’s long distance? And for the record I can actually hear you in the back of my head. . . . You sent I love you several times and said something about wanting me to come home soon.”
“It’s just the Knut stipend for my patronus classes. I still need to schedule them.”
“I know what you’re thinking. . . .they’re protected just like the one I did at the cottage. Little kids can’t get near them. That’s a standard charm I put on all of my water features.”
Now. I’m going to stand right here with my hands in your pockets and beg you to kiss me.”
Point taken. You kids don’t ruin him!
“Imagine these planters with greenery in them though.”
That’s hogwash.
Headline 2:
“Who are they up against?”
It's Wednesday in Australia I think. Happy Midweek!
Do you really think so?
I’m tired.
You think Molly would be used to that by now.
“That’s not the FUCKING BROOM!”
So right. This one is family friendly though and kind of funny if you ask me. But it will keep you from talking about it with anyone that wasn’t at the meeting. Make sense?
——————————————————————————
“No I’m glad you did!”
Do not!
You should let Draco just do whatever he wants. That’s his element. I just want my old Quidditch stuff and that kitchen table set if nobody else does.
”Don’t worry, we’re going”, Draco assures them calmly. ”I’m thinking of wearing my light blue—”
Remus’s arms are strong and tight around Harry, making him feel safe…
”He’s gone?” Harry mumbles, his mind racing. ”Then we’re safe? He’s definitely gone?”
”Don’t … don’t you remember?” Harry asks carefully.
” Draco continues matter-of-factly. ”Now,
Harry nods in understanding. He remembers both his daddy and Professor Snape explaining this to him at the beginning of the school year. At the time, the idea of not being allowed to keep taking the Dreamless Sleep potion was a nightmare in itself, but now… Harry is almost certain he could stop taking it completely right now, and he’d be fine.
”You don’t say”, Harry snaps. ”Just tell me everything you know.”
Harry’s confusion disperses then. He knows that feeling.
”I bet”, Harry nods.
”I wonder”, Professor Dumbledore says softly. ”If I might have a word with Harry —?”
Harry shivers as the cold, night air hits him. Then he spots a lantern bobbing along towards them and a loud, booming voice calls out, ”Firs’-years! Firs’-years over here! Gather aroun’ ye lot!”
”Me too…”
Harry quickly scans the History of Magic classroom and is relieved to find Draco already at their usual table in the front row. He makes his way ove and quickly slumps down in the seat next to him, trying to make himself as invisible to the other students as possible, uncomfortably aware of the Gryffindors stares from the other side of the classroom.
”Whatever”, he mutters.
”Knew it…” he murmurs and shakes his head fondly.
what’s on your mind, Mister Potter?”
he’s heard that name somewhere recently.
”You-Know-Who”, Harry mumbles, feeling himself shiver as his mind flashes back to the graveyard. ”Death Eaters… he killed Krum… killed him—”
”Oh… I didn’t know what it was called…”
…” the blonde says, glancing between the two of them. ”No, I slept great.”
”Come on, let me show you something else…” Sirius says, clapping him on the shoulder.
”, Snape says slowly. ”
, Harry remembers with a jolt — and it’s like the final pieces of a jigsaw puzzle magically scuttles into place…
Before Harry knows how it’s happened exactly, his knees have buckled under him and tears are running down his face. He struggles for breath, but it’s like his lungs won’t cooperate. Now matter how much he gasps, he can’t get any air. And not until his dad has slammed his strong arms around his body does Harry realise how violently he’s shaking.
Harry shakes his head.
”That’s okay, I rather go home”, Draco says suddenly, then immediately blushes and stammers out, ”I-I-I mean y-y-our home, C-C-reirwyn’s—”
Someone puts his glasses onto his face and Harry blinks behind them, finally able to make out the faces of both his dads leaning over him, smiling in relief. Both Remus and Sirius have dark shadows under their eyes, but Remus looks worse; he looks like he hasn’t slept in a month. His eyes are raw from crying as well, Harry can tell and he feels guilt gripping his heart and squeezing it tightly.
… With a sigh, he puts his glasses on.
Remus’ eyes flicker over to him again and he puts his wine goblet down in determination.
”Yeah, I know. It’s taken me a while to get used to though. When I was younger I had this fear of heights… But now I don’t mind it at all.”
”Yeah.”
With a loud crack, the creature explodes into smoke and disappears, leaving Harry alone once more. As he begins to move forward again, he tries to walk as quietly and quickly as possible, listening intently for any sign of movement in the darkness around him… turning left twice, before he finally finds a right turn, Harry performs the navigation spell again and as he’d suspected, he’s gone too far east…
Harry’s heart stutters in his chest…
With a startled yell, he starts swinging his arms around wildly, but only hits empty space… Whatever is holding him up is out of his reach and keeps dangling him the air… If only he knew in which direction to point his wand, he might be able to hit it with a Disarming Charm or a —
”And Finch-Fletchly must have seen it through Nearly Headless Nick!” Draco says eagerly. ”What about the others? Mrs Norris?”
”Oh, yeah, the Blast-Ended Skrewts”, Harry mutters darkly. ”Maybe Rita Skeeter isn’t all bad then, if this means Hagrid has to get rid of them now…”
”I’m not a kid, you don’t have to”, Harry mumbles sleepily but moves into Remus’s caress when the man strokes his head.
”How heavy is it?” Sirius asks curiously and grabs it from Harry. ”Not too bad…”
”You can’t tell me what to do!” Harry says indignantly.
”Or not…” Draco mutters, leaning back again with a frown. ”Harry?”
”I was?” Harry says numbly, cheeks burning. ”W-What did I say…?”
On Friday morning, something finally distracts at least Harry and Draco and the rest of the Slytherins from the school’s recent obsession with The Chamber of Secrets, because when they come out of the dorms they find a new notice on the board in the Common Room announcing open try-outs for the Slytherin Quidditch team on Monday night. Harry and Draco both turn to look at each other in excitement and start talking at the same time:
”Defend himself”, Ogden scoffs, getting to his feet and pointing his wand to his own face, to stop the gush of puss still coming from his nose. ”Against what, man?”
Malfoy looks up again, he seems to be weighing his words.
”Oh, Merlin…” Draco says in a small voice, and Harry notices for the first time that the boy is trembling all over.
”Nothing, nightmare, sorry”, Harry calls out.
”In this world, yes. I’ve been told that. But
”So we just make sure none of us go anywhere alone?” Seamus says, shrugging.
Harry almost stumbles over his own feet in his haste to get out of the office. The pain in his head has faded to a dull throbbing, but his scar definitely hurt when Umbridge touched him… it’s only ever done that when Voldemort’s been nearby…
Remus ushers Harry and Draco out of the drizzling rain and into the slightly warmer Entrance Hall, then pulls Harry into a big hug.
, but we’re not
”Don’t be shy.”
The little memory ghost begins to speak, as if answering a question and Harry peers down at it curiously.
”Oh…” Harry mumbles.
There is a collective intake of breath followed by a hiss of excited whispers as Dumbledore conjures up a small stage along the right-hand wall of the hall, upon which a drum set, several guitars, a lute, a cello and some bagpipes pop into existence.
Harry’s fingers twitch over Draco’s bare skin as he trails his hands up the other boy’s arm, before grabbing his shoulder and pulling him closer and deepening the kiss.
— Harry rolls his eyes, even as the funny feeling in his stomach does a little flip.
”Don’t get smart with me, Snape”, Moody growls. ”Or one or two of my
”She’s a complete hag!”
”No-one deserves to be humiliated in front of the whole school!” Harry exclaims in frustration and then angrily tamps down the mental image of Umbridge running from the Great Hall croaking like a toad,
”So you were right”, Draco says. ”Slytherin’s heir is free and the monster’s still on the loose.”
”Fine…” Harry mutters and lowers his leg again, bending over to stick his face into the flames instead. ”
… You might get to smooch your boyfriend again?” she finishes with an exaggerated eyebrow wiggle.
He spins around and, ignoring the stares from the other students and the disapproving glare from Madam Pince, he storms out of the library. Harry swings the book bag onto his shoulder and it knocks against the small of his back hard enough to brusie, but Harry doesn’t care. In fact, he almost welcomes the dull throbbing… It gives him something else to focus on, something other than the fury that’s coiling inside him like some aggravated snake getting ready to strike —
Draco mumbles something that is too quiet for Harry to make out.
he thinks furiously and turns away from the mirror with a scowl.
”I now ask the Jury”, Crouch shouts. ”To raise their hands if they believe, as I do, that these crimes deserve a life sentence in Azkaban!”
Glancing up at the headmaster’s face, Harry nods in understanding and takes a deep breath. He leans forward to plunge his face into the Pensieve and as soon as his face hits the odd substance that is neither gas nor liquid, with no discernable temperature, he feels his feet leave the floor of the headmaster’s office.
”…Oh”, Remus says in surprise. ”Then—”
me?” the girl says, her smile flickering out.
”Hm…” Voldemort says softly. ”I
”I know”, Blaise grouses, still stalking across the room.
They sit like that for long time, and Harry almost dozes off again. But then he remembers Pettigrew and shakes himself awake again.
Several students, like Draco, seem to rush through their meals so they can spend the time revising, whereas most of the Ravenclaws seem to be forgoing sustenance altogether, judging by their absence at the Ravenclaw table, and instead spending all their time between lessons in the library, much to Madam Pince’s aggravation.
Draco frowns in confusion.
, Draco”, he says. ”I know you want me to leave you alone, you need time, space, whatever, and
Harry turns back to give the golden eagle an appraising look. He’s aware of Granger striding over to join him.
”No”, Harry shakes his head. ”I’m just… not from around here.”
”Yeah, or something”, Harry agrees happily.
he thinks excitedly.
”I saw James and Lily”, Harry says, a little louder than he’d intended.
?” Draco demands defensively.
”Come on, let’s find you a seat…” Sirius says bracingly and claps him on the shoulder, before grabbing his trunk for him.
He sweeps away from them again, his robes billowing behind him as swoops down on Longbottom and starts  insulting the Gryffindor boy’s poor brewing skills like it’s a normal day like any other. Harry stares at the scene, feeling oddly removed from himself like he’s outside his own body watching the classroom from a distance.
”Thanks”, Draco says quietly. ”Oh, and… I’m not sure if the rumours are true, about Potter’s muggle relatives, probably not, but… If they are, and those muggles give you any grief… Send me an owl and, I don’t know, you can come and stay with me or something… If you want…”
”Harry… You know the Malfoys are one of the oldest pureblood families in Britain…”
”What about us?” Sirius demands, just as angrily.
(which sounds a bit like an exaggeration, to Harry…)
Harry sighs. He hates porridge, but he should probably set some kind of example and eat some anyway, in solidarity with Draco if nothing else. So he forces a few spoonfuls down.
”Harry, I understand that you’re hurting, but you can’t just use people—”
it might be fun”, Draco interrupts him for a third again and Harry bristles.
Harry blinks, really noticing the set table for the first time. The cat struggles a little, but he manages to put her down and Remus quickly distracts her with a bowl of food of her own.
Professor Snape doesn’t reply immediately. He simply turns the page in the book he’s reading with an almost pensive movement, then flits his eyes up from the page to meet Harry’s own.
”At least you got out”, Harry says tentatively and Sirius gives him a sidelong glance. ”I mean, it all worked out… in the end… right?”
in Harry’s opinion. But there is no denying that his extracurricular brewing of the Animagi Potion has been working in his favour. The old Potions Master clearly has a soft spot for him, thinking very highly of him as a potions student.
Harry thinks fervently.
”What magic?” Remus asks swiftly.
”Mmmkay…” Harry mumbles, burrowing into his pillow gratefully.
”Or not…” Seamus mutters. ”Hey, look at the lions…”
Harry stares. Krum is asking him for love advice? About Granger? Maybe the girl
”But I told, I had no idea!” Bagman cries, his smile falling for the first time. ”None at all! Rookwood is an old friend of my dad’s, it never crossed my mind that he was in with You-Know-Who! I thought I was collecting information for our side! Rookwood kept telling me he’d get me a job at the Ministry once my Quidditch days are over… I mean, I can’t keep getting hit by bludgers forever, now can I?”
”You always did like big friends who looked out for you”, Sirius continues. ”At first it was me and Remus… And James… They only made you Secret-Keeper because I suggested it”, Sirius snarls, his voice getting thicker and thicker with suppressed emotion.
Harry looks over at the Irish boy in confusion. Noticing the smirks on his other friends faces and the blush in Draco’s cheeks, his confusion only grows stronger.
Harry walks inside his bedroom and slams the door shut behind him. Almost immediately there’s a knock on it.
With an eruption of pure excitement and relief inside his chest and stomach, Harry bursts through the open door to the Department of Mysteries —
Harry huffs and throws his hands up in the air, barely registering the fact that Draco lurches forward for a reassuring embrace, ”
Harry returns to Hogwarts feeling slightly better about the whole thing, but far from okay. Talking it over with Draco helps him process everything again, but when he describes how the memory made him feel the blonde looks stricken, like he’d just said something rude to him and Harry frowns in confusion.
