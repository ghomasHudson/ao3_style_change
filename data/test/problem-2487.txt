‘I... because I’m so sick and tired of this fucking job, Potter.’ He averts his head as he gets up from the recliner and starts pacing the room.
Harry hums. His stomach is rumbling from all the delicious smells. The Count makes his way over to the bed and positions a tray in front of Harry. It’s filled with pain au chocolate and croissants, strawberries and peach juice. Harry’s mouth waters. The Count sits across him on the huge bed, legs crossed. He looks relaxed, his hair disheveled. ‘Please, tuck in.’ The Count nibbles at his croissant. ‘Coffee will be here in a second.’
I laugh with Harry, seeing the same sparkly giddiness he showed when we were just together. And I swallow. I know I mustn’t be jealous, but it’s bloody difficult when you see your significant other this happy, while you aren’t the cause.
Snape grabbed into his wrist and looked at the bracelet. "What? You idiot child! Do you know what this means?"
"Slughorn? He absolutely adored Regulus. Couldn't care less about me. I was shit at potions while perfect Regulus was the good one at Potions. Obviously made his wall." Sirius groaned. Although, he missed his brother, he was still pissed about his childhood.
"Arthur Pendragon," He said as he shook Draco's hand, "King of Camelot."
Teddy just smiled and nodded.
Steve came out of the ship holding Tony. Pepper (who had joined them when she heard what happened) ran up and hugged Tony. She was full on sobbing.
"After your Sirius? As much as we love him, that wold just inflate his ego too much."
"Yeah, so you need to hide or something."
"No, you can go now." Draco said.
Sirius slowly walked towards Severus. His Patronus spell faded and he holstered his wand. When he got close enough to Severus he just stared at him for a couple seconds. Then, he grabbed his collar and pulled him into a kiss.
Harry pulled the cloak off and stared at Neville, "Hi, Nev."
"Can you tell me about Teddy?" Scorpius blurted out.
, Thor seemed to be on edge.
To anyone who didn't know this was Merlin, wouldn't know. The plaque at the bottom of the frame said 'The Great Dragoon'.
"I tried firing him but the Board didn't let me to show 'not all ex-Death Eaters are bad!' I know that because of Draco but my students were more important than the Ministry mantra." Teddy said.
"Sir—" Harry tried but was quickly shut up by Fury.
Everyone made their way back to the compound. Draco was uncharacteristically quiet on the long way back, he only sat next to Harry and took a nap on his shoulder. Teddy and Pietro were whispering about something, Harry couldn't really pick up what it was. Sirius and Snape were seated across from each other just glaring at each other. Occasionally, Sirius would kick Snape and Snape would kick back. Bucky sat next to Steve and across from Sam, who was glaring at him. Next to Sam was Natasha, on the other side of her was Clint. On the other side of Sam was Scott. Peter was sitting next to Tony, just rocket firing questions. On the other side of Tony was Rhodey. Wanda sat in between Clint and Vision. T'Challa was dropped off at his home country, or as far as the Quinjet could take him.
They walked out of the kitchen. "We'll be right back." Tony announced.
"You mean the thing you sought out to destroy when you were supposed to be in your seventh year?" Rogers asked.
"Do you know who did kill him?"
Either way, Scorpius woke up and Draco saw his beautiful emerald green eyes. "Harry! He has your eyes." Draco exclaimed.
"How was that man Peter Pettigrew a rat?"
Everyone was standing behind Steve, Natasha, T'Challa and Harry. Snape had wisely stayed in the upstairs with Shuri, Scorpius and Vision. Draco, Sirius, Wanda, Bruce (who was in a Hulk Buster suit seeing as Hulk didn't wanna come out), Sam, Rhodey, Okoye and Loki were ready for a battle standing behind the four
"Why didn't he just come to our house?" Harry questioned.
"Right. Well, thank you all. I appreciate the help. I should get going. I have to wrap this or something."
"How much?"
"Yeah. His name is Pietro Maximoff. Real sweet guy. He has superhuman speed. Oh, we have superheroes on our Earth instead of witches and wizards. Teddy literally almost died for him twice, I think it is now. Pietro proposed to him right as Teddy was almost dying. Kinda sweet if you ask me. I didn't get to see it though."
Merlin gaped. "How'd you know?"
"Stay outside. I need to check on him first. I'll let you know when you can enter." Draco said right before entering then closing the door on them.
Teddy was still principal of his school, but since it was now summer, he had a bit of a break for a while. He and Clint had gotten close. Clint reminded Harry a lot of the twins which made him really happy. Although Clint didn't like them at first, he was starting to love them like family.
"What happened to the Harry boy?" Drax asked.
"Draco! Healing spells that heal magical people?"
"No, it wasn't. Is there anything else you can tell me about his life? Is he happy?"
"Attacked?" Merlin asked in a surprised tone.
"Then the ten year anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts. I made a speech. Draco made a speech. Andrew Creevey, Colin's dad, shot a curse at Draco. Me, being an Auror, didn't know how to help him, I called another Healer, Hannah Abbott, over and she healed him. An Auror is basicallly our SHIELD and a Healer is a doctor. Draco was Head Healer and I was Head Auror. We worked together a lot, which is how we started developing feelings for each other. After Creevey shot the curse at Draco, I shot him with another curse, but put too much power behind it and almost killed him. So we went into hiding. We hid for 45 years. He told me that Voldemort forced him to make a Horcrux which is how he hadn't aged. I have his Horcrux now. We got married, not legally of course. We almost got caught by Hugo Weasley, Hermione and Ron's kid. During our hiding, we worked on spells, potions and everything. Then in October of 2053, we decided to take over the Ministry. Didn't really work. Found Teddy along the way. He was Headmaster of Hogwarts and was talking to the Auror's about upping the security of the school. And we ended up here. Teddy is a Metamorphous, meaning he can alter what he looks like. He made a Horcrux and chose to keep himself looking like a 17 year old like me and Draco. When we went missing, he chose my green eyes and Draco's blond hair and he hasn't really changed it since.
"And who was friends with Pettigrew? 'Cause it certainly wasn't me!"
The sound a twig snapping was heard.
Harry laughed. "Let's go kick this giant purple grape's arse then you can compliment me."
"Ted, you know I would never hurt you. I love you with my whole heart and I'm sorry." Harry whispered, not wanting anyone else to hear him.
"If they're going, I'm going." Arthur said.
"Will you two stop fighting for once? They're trying to enjoy a happy moment!" Teddy basically yelled, stepping between Sirius and Snape. "God, you're starting to sound like an old married couple."
Scorp moved around a bit in his papas arms before settling back down and sleeping peacefully.
On the battlefield, Wakandan soldiers disintegrate to ashes.
"Oh. No. It was another incident." Sirius said, grabbing his strawberry lemonade and taking a sip.
"Alright, so now, goodbyes? We don't know whats gonna be on the other side of that. So, just in case," Draco suggested.
As a spur of the moment decision, Harry turned to George, "I'll meet you at the Veil in an hour. I have to do something first."
"Okay! Can everyone be quiet? We don't know the gender, we have like a month and a half before we find out the gender. Yes, Peter, where we're from, guys can get pregnant. It's rare and only happens if both males are powerful enough. No, Tony, we're not naming them Anthony. We have a couple name options for girls and boys, but we don't have an actual name yet. The due date is November 6th. Nat, we love you, but no you can't teach them to hold a knife until they're at least 10 years old. We haven't asked them yet, but we want to ask Severus, Teddy and Sirius to be the godfathers." Harry said quickly. "Any other questions?"
"Straightforward, are we?" Once again, he stayed silent to see how she would react. She didn't falter. "Harry Potter. The Boy-Who-Lived. But that's not the information you're looking for, is it? You want to know why he knows so many with the names of my comrades. Harry Potter visited me, once. Back when I was merely a twenty year-old. Said he needed help bringing his friends back. Though, he introduced himself as Hadrian Black. He was intending to come back here, to this time period, but landed with me instead. He gave good advice. He was the one who pushed me to tell Arthur about my magic."
It seemed like she was crying, "Be quick. He is very strong."
"Sirius." Harry whispered.
Harry nodded while running down to the basement to grab a cauldron and the ingredients needed. He came back upstairs and put his stuff down next to Draco.
Harry nodded and led him into a small guest bedroom on the communal floor.
Severus, who had leaned into the kiss and placed his hands on Sirius' waist, hesitantly pulled away and looked around. Draco, Harry and Teddy all had similar smirks on their faces.
"How?" He asked, as if Harry would know.
Gwaine perked up, "I believe you still have normal alcohol here?"
"You have a lot to catch up on, Bruce." Sirius, who was also in dragonhide armor, said, as he put away his wand after hearing who it was and walked into the room, also going in to hug Bruce.
"Please stand. I've never liked people thinking I was a hero. Still don't." Harry explained.
"Status report?"
Severus just nodded and threw a glare at Sirius.
"I thought you said you weren't going to leave."
"Can I help you?" Potter asked, not even bothering to look up from a case file he needed to work on.
Harry nodded (not that George could see that) and grabbed some floo powder before saying, "Hogwarts' Headmasters office."
Harry got up again and walked out into the middle of the battle field. He looked at Thanos who had teleported in a couple minutes ago. He summoned both of his wands. His magic was flowing through his veins like it did in the Battle of Hogwarts.
"Where?"
Draco laughed. "Tell me about it." He said before taking one last glance at Harry then walking towards the kitchen.
"Your patronus?" Snape asked quietly.
"Exactly. In maybe 40 or 50 years, she'll be dead. Meaning, a new Minister, then we can strike. Or we wait until she retires."
She somewhat recognized the names of Steven Rogers and Anthony Stark.
The voice was barely a whisper, but Harry somehow still heard it. He turned to the Veil, seeing the Cailleach looking directly at him.
Someone (probably Strange. Teddy may have only known him for a couple hours but he already knew he was the voice of reason with the current group) suggested that they get off the donut, so they did.
"The one and only." Harry smiled.
The stones flew over to where Harry was standing. Thanos' eyes flew to him.
"Yes." They both said.
"He didn't!" Ron yelled, obviously angered by his best friend hurting a man who in his mind did nothing wrong. "If anything, we should have left Malfoy to die!"
Draco quickly cast a shield around Teddy and gave Harry a 'let him come over here and I'll protect him' look. Harry nodded and kissed Teddy's forehead before apparating to Draco with Teddy then apparating back alone.
"Sectumsempra," Draco whispered, "Heal it please. You know the spell."
The doors barged open, the security entering the office, circling Harry with their wands pointed at him.
"You called Nat?"
Harry elbowed his husband, "Not my fault I didn't grow up in specially tailored clothes from fancy French or Italian designers."
As usual, Harry saw Loki waiting for him.
"Harry," Tony called, catching his attention, "I think it might be time to, y’know, pull out the bracelet circlet thing."
Chapter 12: Post-Civil War/Pre-Infinity War
But for now, he was content just being around his family.
"Wait. How long have you been here?"
Arthur and Merlin, Harry and Draco, Steve and Bucky, Teddy and Pietro, Tony and Pepper, Natasha and Bruce, Sirius and Severus were matching because they were dating, or soon to be dating.
Harry just stared at Draco for a good amount of seconds before he spoke up. "Are you scared because of what happened to Carina?"
Harry stayed quiet, "Not sure I'm up for that yet," He whispered.
The uniform was terrifying in his opinion. They were a dark blue, tight fitted jumpsuits with the SHIELD emblem on the sleeve. It had 'H. Potter' embedded on the left side. They were not protective at all compared to his dragon hide armor that he chose to wore underneath (not that anyone knew except Draco and possibly Teddy) after his first day.
"Do you have a picture?"
"Well... The Stones are the living but they were used as a form of death. So can't the Hallows do the same thing as a form of the living?"
"You know we're doing everything we can to bring him back."
"No, it's fine," Teddy waved him off, "I'm used to it by this point."
Sirius hung out a lot with Natasha. She had reminded him a lot of Lily. They had also become close friends. She even helped him realize that being gay was a normal thing in this world. As a gay man in a wizarding world that doesn't change their mind that easily, made it hard for him to be himself. But here it was completely fine which seemed completely crazy to Sirius.
"Great! Now that we have introductions over with, we need to talk." Steve said, as Natasha pulled up the street footage of Tony, Pietro, Teddy, Peter and the unknown male enter an alien spacecraft.
Banner went back to asking questions, "What's the Sword of Gryffindor?"
"Then wrecking havoc is the nicer version. Now stop talking and come help me with my wandless Patronus."
"I'd like you to work for me. We can ignore the blood thing for now, as long as you work for me. You'd work as an Agent, working closely with some of my most trusted."
"Are you okay?"
Harry burst out laughing. He looked at Thanos and saw his face of disappointment.
Explanations, trips, confrontations and birthdays.
"Love? How would you feel if we move our plan up a few years?" Harry asked.
Severus studied the bracelet. "Death is only one side of the story. You forget about the Life part. Two sides of a coin."
So she did what she could. She called off the arrests.
Draco took a deep breath before walking towards Weasley. "Good morning, Hugo. Good morning, Headmaster Lupin." He faked a smile at Hugo then smiled genuinely at his cousin.
"Does anyone have the same Patronus?"
"I'll be leaving tomorrow. Think about it. I can even be there while you tell him if you'd like. I can explain whatever you want to him."
." Harry hissed in Parseltongue.
Bruce started laughing, "You guys are so screwed now!"
"Everyone calm down! We can fix this!" Steve yelled over everyone else's ranting and worrying.
"Tony." Steve spoke, "What's this about?"
"Sirius. Snape and Dumbledore planned it. Dumbledore wanted Snape to be the one to kill him, so he could prove his loyalty to Voldemort so he would trust him. After that Hermione, Ron and I went for Tom Riddle's Horcruxes. We found most but had to go back to Hogwarts to find the last couple. Then I ended up being a Horcrux and whatever. War broke out at Hogwarts, the Battle of Hogwarts. May 2nd, 1998. Hell broke lose. So many people died, Sirius. Fred Weasley died, Snape died, Lavender Brown died, Colin Creevey died. Remus and Tonks died. I had to die. But Dumbledore gave me the Resurrection Stone so I came back. Thanks to Narcissa, I'm still here."
There was a feud going on between the Avengers, specifically Tony and Steve. Their arguments all led back to Sokovia which made Wanda and Pietro feel bad every time it was mentioned. It was something about the UN controlling the Avengers. Harry always zoned out at those meetings seeing as they reminded him of all the meetings the Minister would include him in for no reason. The team was mainly split three ways: one, the ones who think yes, the team should be controlled by the UN; two, the ones who think no, the team should not be controlled by the UN; and three, those who think the team should talk things out instead of just jumping into arguments. Even Draco, Teddy, Snape and Sirius, who weren't even on the team, had a preferred side. On team one was Tony, Natasha, Rhodey and Vision. On team two was Steve, Clint, Sam and Wanda. And on team three was Harry, Draco, Teddy, Sirius, Snape and Pietro (who didn't want to go against his sister but he still thought they needed to talk things out like normal people).
"Where?" Steve asked.
"Yeah, a couple actually. We got bored a lot while over here. I can show you our spell making and potion room at our house if you'd like."
Harry took a deep breath in but nodded either way. "Well, I'm sure you know that we were school rivals, you could say. He was a Slytherin and I was a Gryffindor. All the houses and professors besides Severus hated the Slytherins. They were cast out as the dark house, meaning that no one wanted to be associated with them. Him and me had a very odd, you could say, relationship. We would fight all the time and everyone knew of the rivalry between Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter. During my sixth year, I had suspected that Draco had been turned into a de—a bad guy, which he had been. So I was following him around all year and accidentally hurt him. You probably don't remember, but he has these scars across his chest because of me. It was an idiotic decision and I've regretted it ever since, but I can't take it back. Then after the war, we became friends because of his decision to turn to the good side during the war and through Teddy. Teddy was actually the one who realized we were in love with each other. We had had a couple flings but never established anything until after we went on the run."
"It is getting pretty annoying and we’ve only known them for a couple weeks." Elyan said, all the Knights plus Merlin and Guinevere nodded.
Harry watched as Sirius and Severus turned even more red, if possible.
A couple seconds later, Severus, in a white button up shirt and some black jeans. It seemed to be the norm for Severus these days. In his arms was baby Scorpius dressed in an Iron Man onesie that Tony had bought for him along with onesies of the other Avengers. Somehow, it's as if Scorp knew, the Iron Man and the Captain America ones were his favorites.
They all nodded and went along their separate ways. Severus walked towards Draco and Harry holding a five year old Scorpius asleep in his arms.
The Titan turned his attention to the boy who stood some feet away from him.
Harry laughed and pulled away from the hug to look at his husband. He put his hands on Draco's stomach. "It's our baby we're talking about. Speaking of which, how far along are you?"
"Like who? I had a crush on Cedric and he died. Krum is as straight as a board. The Weasleys were too much like family. Dean and Seamus were gay for each other. Neville was hardcore crushing on Luna during our school years."
When everyone had their items, Hermione pulled out the letter that was at the top of everything that was addressed to all of them.
She turned to the window, looking Northeast to where London would be over seas, "What are you?" She asked to no one in particular, just to herself.
"Unnecessary. I've had enough practice."
Harry facepalmed mentally, "Shit. Okay," He thought for a second before speaking in Parsel, "
She moved on to Draco.
"So, between the end of the battle, I spent a lot of time going over my life choices. After a while, I signed up for the Auror program. I skipped all the training, because of everything that I'd already been through. There was this one guy who hated me since the moment I entered. Bekhe Ryztan. He was the top Auror, besides Head Auror. He was gonna be Head once Robards quit, we all knew that after the year he wanted to leave but never found a good replacement for him. So Ryztan was gonna replace him. But when I joined the office, along with Ronald and Neville, who also skipped the junior program and made to the main program. When Robards retired five years after the war, I became Head Auror. Ryztan hated me even more then. So, we went along.
George grabbed the journal from Charlie, a quill and said, "Talon."
"I thought you knew? Voldemort made him make a Horcrux."
He saw blood on his face and a bruise around his neck. The mans eyes cracked open and Loki recognized those green eyes. "Loki?"
." Harry whispered.
"It's a spell from my Healer days. I taught Harry since taking them on yourself it kind of awkward."
"I don't know. But either way, it's probably someone that they didn't like. Someone who fought against Voldemort in the war, most likely."
Romanoff narrowed her eyes but shook his hand, "What do you mean finally?"
Clint sped up, going faster than the Jet probably should.
"Yeah. I just thought we got away from all that 40 years ago." Harry sighed.
"Alright, let me stop you right there. Draco was an asshole because of his father, Lucius. Lucius believed that Pureblood were better than half-bloods and especially Muggleborns. Draco was raised on his ideals. Narcissa was more open on the ideas but she couldn't speak up without risking her life. For the blood purity thing, basically Purebloods think they are, like the name says, of pure blood, meaning all wizardry decent. Occasionally, when the kids are raised like Draco was, they think they are higher up on the social chain. Then there's families like the Weasleys. They're also Purebloods but they are considered Blood Traitors for not believing they are better than the others. And Quidditch. It's a sport. I wish we could try it some day but we don't have the supplies. Well I do have a Snitch, but we need more brooms and the other balls. But! It's like soccer in the air, I guess. There are goalposts, brooms, balls, and seven members a team. There's three Chasers, two Beaters, one Keeper and one Seeker. The Chasers are in charge of making the goals with the Quaffle, each goal being worth ten points. The Beaters make sure the other players don't get hit by the Bludger which is charmed to knock the players off their brooms. The Keeper is the goalie and the Seeker, which is what I was, is in charge of ending the game. The Seeker is after the Snitch, which is a flying gold little ball. It moves so quickly, you need to be on the look out for it at all times. If the Seeker chases the Snitch, the game ends and their team gets added 150 points, almost always winning the game for their team."
Silence followed his question before seven men came out of the trees.
"Can... May I see what you have?"
"It was called Dumbledore's Army, the DA. It fell apart after the fight at the Ministry. Or the Department of Mysteries Battle, as the
Teddy ran up to Draco, interrupting his conversation with Severus. His hair was flashing between dark raven, platinum blonde and his normal blue.
She still is the most beautiful woman I know. But more gorgeous than her appearance is her kindness, straightforwardness, wit and her power to do anything for the ones she loves. I could never have wished for a better mother for our children. I love her so much, it sometimes hurts.
‘Oh, Po- Precious. Nothing is ever easy with you.’ The Count summons the lube. He slathers his hand in it, reaching down slowly. Harry feels him part his arsecheeks. When the tip of his finger breeches his hole, Harry whimpers, his eyes fluttering shut. The Count presses in further, moving up and down. He leans into Harry, kissing and licking him wherever he can reach.
‘That’s honest. And hopeful.’ He adds.
I see a flicker of doubt on his face. ‘Do you want me to stop?’
Draco blushes and averts his eyes, while he nods. Just Harry takes his chin and directs it up. ‘Look at me, love. I know you’ll do wonderful. Just do to us what you like to do to yourself.’ Draco looks at him, feigning innocence, through fluttering lashes. Just Harry’s smoldering look goes straight to his cock.
I look at him, standing under the pale moonlight. His radiating beauty. His hair is long and curly, not messy like when we were teenagers. He doesn’t know it, but he emits power, even now we’re going to play. I can’t wait to break him. Not too far, never too far, but just far enough for our arousal to peak at new heights.
In which Draco, Ginny and Harry talk and Ginny and Draco discover they have more in common than they thought.
‘For fucks sake, just fuck me!’
‘I... I’m not sure how to start.’
He decides not to answer. Limping takes up all his energy.
‘I don’t boast about it. But I can do most spells wandless.’
Still I carried, I carried, I carried on
He has the decency to blush and casts his eyes downward.
He blushes. I’d forgotten how adorable it makes him look. I’d forgotten how he likes me to jibe at him. How it turned him on when I insulted him. I also remember how he craved the tenderness he was deprived of in his youth. How much love he needed and how much he has to give,
Boy Toy gets on his knees next to the still sitting Draco and takes Draco’s hand to guide it onto his cock. ‘I’ve never done this before’, Draco lets a tiny bit of panic seep through his voice.
‘The theft that was reported counted three vials. I’ve only retrieved two. And I suspect you’re not going to tell me where the last one is.’ She purses her lips. ‘Just as I thought. You leave me no choice but to do a proper investigation, ma’am.’
‘Har? Harry? Are you crying?’ I get up and kneel before him. My hands find his face and grab it. I wipe away his tears. ‘Look at me. Talk to me.’
‘Oh dear, lost your tongue? I’ll find it for you, because you’ll be needing it later on.’ Malfoy looks at him devilishly, while trailing the tip of his tongue over his upper lip, sending a shiver through Harry.
Draco crashes his lips on Harry’s, tongue seeking entrance. Harry shakes his head. ‘Uh-uh. You had your chance and decided not to take it. I’ll be finishing this whole plate of tapas all by myself. Although...’ He waits for impact. ‘Something naughty might make me change my mind’.
Harry’s eyes shoot backwards. ‘I’m sorry.’
I could still just make up an excuse. My mind is racing. Should I do this? I must’ve hurt him then. All of a sudden a much worse thought slips through my mind. What if it never was serious for him? What if he was glad I left him?
‘Yes. It’s me.’ Bellatrix gestures, as if the caller on the other side can see her. Stupid cow.
It takes the wind from his sails. He deflates. ‘You’re serious, aren’t you?’
She blushes and averts her eyes. She looks delicious enough to eat right now. ‘Why, auror?’
After the weekend, Ginny and I invite him over to our home. Ginny has gone beyond herself to cook a delicious dinner. She did inherit some of Molly’s cooking talent. She’s just too lazy a housewife to show it off often, but I love her anyway. She’s perfect as she is.
She thinks a bit. ‘Oh yeah, as I’m an utter idle housewife, I expect both of you to take turns to cook for our weekly meetings too. And that’s about it.’ She looks at Draco, expectantly.
Jones looks at it in wonder. ‘Hmm, must’ve been my imagination then. Just finish the bloody report today, Malfoy. And I’ll talk about your insubordination with your senior auror.’ He turns and walks out of the office.
Harry slowly blinks, because he shouldn’t intrude. When he opens them again, he unexpectedly catches a glimpse of the count, dancing with a round breasted witch. His eyes lock onto Harry’s as he swirls by, a little lopsided grin tugging at the corner of his mouth.
Time to step off the rollercoaster. I know what to do. I have to end this. Harry will never love me as much as he will love her. I grab my phone and wipe away my tears. I see a good looking boy standing next to me, watching me. I walk over and snog him. My phone snaps a quick a photo.
Harry wraps his strong arms around Draco. ‘There now, nothing to worry about. It’s okay, love. If you don’t want me to see you naked, it’s all right. As long as I can see that lovely cock sometimes, I’m happy.’
‘Do not anger me, Drapunzel.’ She releases him. Coughing and wheezing, his shaking hands fly up to his sore throat.
Glancing down, he also registers something else. The tailored jeans Harry’s wearing give him a distinct view of his assets. Which are either completely hard, or just plain enormous in flaccid form. Harry’s eyes follow his glance. He smiles a wicked grin.
‘But... You knew it was me before I fucked you? And you still let me?’
Bottle in one hand, take out box in the other, Harry crosses his street. Strange, he could’ve sworn he had turned off the lights? Must’ve been in too much of a hurry this morning. Fumbling for his keys, he manages to open the door, bottle of wine clutched between his legs. As he enters his cozy living, he has to put down his food container, to prevent all that lovely sushi from toppling over. That’s when he notices. The moon reflecting on something in his living, something metallic, something shiny, something that normally isn’t in his house. Something a lot like a gun with a silencer screwed on. He hears the safety latch of the gun click.
Draco gets up and paces the room. ‘I couldn’t. Why would you, Savior of the whole wizard world, slayer of Dark Lords, ever be interested in me? Death eater junk? I figured you just wanted a quick fuck and would leave.’ He averts his eyes. ‘And I didn’t think my heart could take that.’
‘What’s on your mind?’
‘Auror, please. Anything but that. I’ve never swallowed a cock that deep.’
‘I’m sorry, it’s so slippery, I keep on accidentally pushing in. I’ll stop the minute you tell me to.’
I feel an erection forming in my pants. This is truly happening. Ginny enters and looks at my bulge before asking me: ‘need any help with that, husband dear?’ I smirk and open my fly.
‘What took you so long?’ Mother’s voice is stern.
The Count has never been seen without a mask and glamour. No one knows his identity, only that he’s from a long line of wizards. No one is even sure if he’s a Flagler at all. He’s revived the annual bachelor ball with a naughty twist, turning the prestigious event into a shameless sexy version. It has been a great success ever since the war ended ten years ago. He also hasn’t joined the ball the last few years, claiming there weren’t any compatible wizards or witches available.
Draco nods, even though he doesn’t feel the same about himself. Harry presses a soft kiss to his lips and moves to get Draco a cup of flawlessly brewed tea. ‘Eat, please. Go shower. Go to work. And I might just have a surprise for you, to make you get through the long, boring day ahead.’ Draco’s eyes fly to Harry’s. Who just smirks and blows him a kiss.
Draco swallows. He desperately wants to come. But he also desperately wants to keep some things to himself.
He walks to the door and looks behind him one last time. ‘I might be naked in my house tonight, being a very naughty boy. Maybe someone needs to discipline me.’ His eyes flutter in false innocence.
‘Want to feel pain. Feel anything.’ Harry averts his eyes. He feels a blush creeping up. He hasn’t blushed in a decade.
‘No sir. My wand is on the table.’ He gestures at the table on the other side of the room.
‘No! Harry, no. I’m not. I just... I need to get used to this. Okay? It’s... I’ve... never done something this bloody bonkers before. And you know I’ve done some pretty bizarre shit in our lives.’
‘Oh love, so tight. I’m...’ I can hear from the desperate edge in Harry’s voice that he’s close. My hand flies over my cock, I’m so aroused it’s almost painful. Harry groans and moans as he fills her up, his back arching and his breathing coming in uneven pants. I shiver at the sight and come in long spurts over myself and the carpet. We’re all silent for a moment, trying to control our breathing.
Just before his head enters too, he swears he hears Narcissa’s voice telling him: ‘be careful, Mr. Potter. Draco would never forgive me if I let anything happen to you.’
‘I... I like to have sex in animal form. But you said no animals.’
‘Bastard.’ Harry lets out a relieved laugh.
‘Really? Wouldlikezat’ Harry should feel silly or even uncomfortable, passing out after sex. But instead he feels strangely safe and protected. He tries to get up and wobbles. Yep, that champagne was a very bad idea. The Count is up in a jiffy, his strong arms catching Harry before he falls. He guides him to the bed. He gently lays Harry down on it, pulls of his trousers off again and tucks him in. The Count looks at Harry for confirmation when he moves his hand to the nape of Harry’s neck. Harry nods sleepily, and the Count removes his mask. Harry takes down his glamour, smiling feebly. The Count looks surprised at the sudden display of trust.
My mind feels like a foreign land
Harry holds Draco’s gaze. ‘Am I clear?’
In which Harry is devastated.
‘I’ll take him to hospital, Weasley.’
‘Step away from the window, ma’am.’ She complies, looking flustered. I start circling her, hands behind my back.
Harry looks back, feeling his cheeks heat up again. He shakes his head. ‘No, dear Count. I would very much like to try and suck yóur cock.’ He can’t believe he just said that.
‘Don’t think I’ve gotten sappy. I can’t fuck you if you’re hurting too much to move.’ He growls. But Harry doesn’t miss the soft fondness in his gold specked eyes. Suddenly he knows. Knows Malfoy will be careful. Won’t hurt him if he doesn’t want it. He feels himself relaxing as Malfoy’s hands caress his arsecheeks.
‘Arrogant prick.’
He pales again, and quickly gets out, hooking his arm through Ginny’s outstretched one. ‘I’m proud of you, hun. You did great. Want to ride Space Mountain with me today? If you want, I can kiss you through it too.’ Gin makes kissy sounds with her lips. Draco laughs with his whole body as he swats her arm. She kisses his temple and rests her head on his shoulder. Draco leans into her. I watch them leave for breakfast fondly, a small smile lingering on my lips. Did I mention I’m the luckiest wizard alive? Well, I sure as hell am.
‘Yes. That’s what they made you believe, didn’t they? But I think I look very much alive.’ Malfoy pushes himself off the tree, adjusting his cloak. ‘Just look at me, Potter. Really look. Even your gnomebrained auror instincts must be able to unravel this mystery?’ His posh voice holds a challenge.
Draco does what he asks. Harry almost comes on the spot from the innocent looking man between his legs. He tangles his hand in his braid.
Focusing his hearing, he realizes something is wrong. It’s quiet. Too quiet. All the normal forest sounds seem to have disappeared. Harry’s hand flies to his wand. ‘Is anyone there?’ he yells, his voice coming out more hoarse than he intended. No sound returns.
‘You sure?’ Harry rolls his eyes, but Draco holds back until Harry gives him an almost imperceptible nod. Draco thrusts forward, moaning from the pleasure Harry’s hot, tight mouth gives him. He pulls out and thrusts in again, making Harry choke. Draco checks Harry’s watery eyes, and seeing nothing but pure arousal there, he starts thrusting. He tries not to go too deep, really, he does, but soon he’s unable to stop as raw, fierce need takes over. He thrusts even deeper, making Harry moan beneath him.
‘Is he okay?’
‘You can’t escape me, Mr. Potter. I’ll claim what’s mine.’ He hasn’t got much of a head start, so when I catch up, I tackle him down forcefully. We both topple to the ground, a tangle of limbs trying to hit overpower each other. I manage to get the upper hand and press him to the floor, his hands well above his head, my knee between his legs. His pupils are blown when I look at him. I kiss him, hard, and know I have to stop kissing him, or the whole play will be over in an instant with me apparating him into the bedroom to fuck him there. He seems to sense it too with his perceptive auror instincts, and bites my lip. Just hard enough to get back in the scene.
‘Draco, it’s hard for me...’ His look is serious. Darn, this is the moment he’s going to tell me it was all a mistake.
‘Green?’ Harry looks at him, concerned head cocked to the side. ‘You know you can stop me at any time, right?’
‘You’ve never...? Never had sex after the war? Before yesterday?’ Harry’s expression is soft.
Oh, and I would love to hear your thoughts about this story.
Harry picks up an asparagus. ‘I want you suck on this, before eating it’. He gives Draco an intense stare. Draco flushes, but opens up obediently for the vegetable. First he licks the head, tongue swirling around the soft texture. Then he slowly swallows it and starts bobbing his head. His lips forming a perfect ‘O’ around the asparagus. Harry gives him a smoldering, appreciative look. Feeling brazen, he starts moaning a bit. Harry picks up his hand and presses it palm down on his hard on under the table. ‘This is what your moaning does to me, you filthy boy’. His whisper is sinfully low and still a bit hoarse.
He feels the soft tingle of Harry’s magic wash over him, knowing he’s cleaned him. The heat has subsided, as Harry sends a cooling charm his way too. Damn, this man is just bloody flawless. When his panting subsides, he tucks his cock back in.
I got addicted to a losing game
Harry rolls his eyes. ‘I’m ready.’ He hears Malfoy slicking his cock. He has never heard search an erotic thing.
‘Well, what did you expect from someone creating a book with recipes that were close to perfection? And of course there were lots of other great cooks then. What, do you think, made her book the number one in the 1900’s?’ Draco grins. ‘That had to be magic, right? And a bit of good old Malfoy persuasion...’
‘She’s something.’ Draco smiles broadly as I kiss him. I agree.
‘Okay. I love teasing, being in control. I love pushing you, testing boundaries. I will take care of you, but I expect you to signal me when you’re uncomfortable or want me to stop. I like bottoming, but I’m not adverse to topping either. I love blowjobs, deepthroating, rimming, dry fucking and handjobs, either on the giving or receiving end. Role playing and semi public sex are greatly encouraged as well as disobedience, as long as I get to punish you for it. I love a bit of pain and I like inflicting it.’ Harry licks his bottom lip as an almost sweet grin washes over his handsome face, while he clearly reminiscences some earlier inflicted or received pain.
‘That’s alright.’ He sips his coffee. ‘I really liked last night too. And now you should run. Can’t keep the auror force waiting.’
‘Oh no. Oh no. You don’t get to do this to me, Potter. Not after all these years. I won’t be second best if you have lady troubles. No. The moment you’ve reconciled, you’ll go running to her, abandoning me. Again.’
Hesitantly, Draco reaches for it. ‘Oh, its much softer than I expected.’ He starts stroking it a bit. Harry groans. ‘I’m sorry! Did I do it wrong?’ Draco retracts his hand.
‘Oh yeah. It still is.’ Draco looks over his shoulder, arms remaining tied above his head. He watches Harry clean himself up, a devilish grin on his lips. What the?
Suddenly Malfoy’s breathes in his ear, the words forming a warm trickle against his skin. ‘Touch yourself. It makes it easier.’ His tongue licks a stripe on Harry’s ear. Tentatively Harry touches his cock. If he isn’t careful, he’ll come right there, on the spot. Spreading his precome on his cock, he slowly moves his foreskin up and down. The pleasure makes him shudder. He doesn’t even notice Malfoy’s fingers returning to his hole. Doesn’t notice two fingers becoming three.
‘Ginny and I...’
All I know, all I know
‘Malfoy, obviously.’ I prevent my eyes from rolling as I reply, but it costs me a year of my life. ‘You’re not entirely happy, Har. I know you. You’re not whole.’
(See the end of the chapter for
I’m nervous as Draco knocks. Will they get along? It’ll only work if we’re all in this together. He enters, looking gorgeous. His long hair is shining, as are his eyes. I can see he’s nervous too. We both freeze at the doorstep, not knowing how to greet.
Draco sits at his desk. He’s out of his mind from boredom. All his files have been sorted alphabetically, his paperwork done. He’s almost happy when senior auror Jones barges in. ‘Draco, where the fuck is that report on the Fleetwoods case? I fucking told you to finish it last week!’ He mutters something about fucking incompetent young men being allowed to join the force.
‘After the war, no one would hire me. Reformed or not, the fucking death eater label stuck. The ministry made me a offer. I became an official, ministry payed fucking hitwizard. I’ve done in countless of malicious witches and diabolical evil wizards over time. But when I read your name, I knew. Knew it wasn’t okay. The whole fucking ministry is so bloody corrupted. The fuckers must want you to be stopped before you topple them over.’ He puts his head into his hands, elbows still on his knees. He rubs his face.
‘Hell, yeah.’ Harry pets his hair. Draco strokes him some more.
‘Where are you going? You’ll be blowing me right here.’
‘That’s a great idea.’ Out of habit I grab my iWiz, wanting to jot the ideas down. His stern look makes me freeze in my movement, iWiz halfway in the air. I put it down. Plot bunnies can wait. Conversations with your real life husband are way more important.
‘I... I’m sorry. I’m sorry for what I did to you all these years ago.’ Does he know what I’m talking about? It could’ve been anything.
He looks at me with an unreadable expression. ‘What about us, Harry?’
‘Fuck.’ The Counts still sounds out of breath.
He smiles. ‘That would make me predictable. Where is the fun in that?’ His finger is already searching out my hole, as he gently presses the tip in.
All I know, all I know
(See the end of the chapter for
Thinking of how alone he is, how scared he is, Drapunzel wraps his arms around his legs. His sobs turn into a flood of uncontrollable tears, staining his dress. He wishes there was someone to take him away. A noble prince. ‘Harry’, his head provides. The thought rattles him. Why would he want his prince’s name to be Harry? He doesn’t know anyone but Mother and the characters from the books he has read. There must be something wrong with him.
‘Nope, can’t do. You’re going to impress a count, lad. But okay, I’ll hold back on the feathers.’ Harry shares the details, shows him the mask and finished the call. He shakes his head. Glitters.
‘Over a desk in a sodding country residence. Do you?’ He is silent. I can clearly see his desire, it’s telling me ‘why the hell not’.
‘Yes, but Harry won’t save you, will he? You should’ve been kinder to him.’ Drapunzel shakes his head vigorously. Something is very wrong indeed. He must collect himself. He wipes the tears from his face. No use in crying. It won’t solve anything. He feels his wet dress clinging to his chest. New clothes! Yes, that always cheers him up. He walks up the stairs to his bedroom in the top of the tower. It’s a dark place, with a large four poster bed with heavy, burgundy curtains. The only light seeps through a small, round window in the ceiling. Drapunzel has an enormous 18th century wardrobe. It’s heavy mahogany doors creak as he opens them. Inside are beautiful dresses and gorgeous undergarments. His luxury robes are hung on the side of the wardrobe.
He opens his eyes and looks at Harry intensely, as he sends himself over the edge. Semen is spurting all over his pants and the table cloth. A load moan escapes his mouth. Shit. A woman at another table looks directly at him. Fuckerthefuck, they will get thrown out. The woman resumes her eating, Draco notices relieved.
‘Are you proposing...’
‘How... how long have you known?’
‘Thomas’ Fashion and Tailoring, how may I help you?’ Timothy’s crinkled, friendly face shows up in the floo.
Has it gotten warm in the room? Draco feels either room or he himself has heated up several degrees. He also feels something stirring in his pants. Something he didn’t expect after several rounds of mind blowing sex. Harry is great in bed and has an incredible experience. All of a sudden it makes Draco feel insecure. What is his sexual performances don’t satisfy Harry? What if he has had better? What if he’s so disappointed in what Draco wants, he can’t get it up anymore?
The Count turns Harry around again and plays with Harry’s cock and balls. To Harry’s amazement it’s already half hard again. The Count grins. ‘Needy, are we?’
Leaving the boy perplexed, I press send as I make my way out of the building. I don’t react as Harry texts me. I keep walking, to the airport. Home.
‘I’m entitled to use reasonable force to hold you down, ma’am. Unless you would like me to cuff you?’ I can see her reflection in the window. Her hazel eyes are a pool of want.
‘I’m not sure. That’s one thing we have to sort out.’
‘Bloody hell. You really shouldn’t have done that.’ Harry’s eyes glint dangerously as he wipes the spit away. Harry raises his hand. Draco holds his breath. He studies Draco’s face, seeing his own dilated pupils reflected there. ‘Green?’ ‘Green.’
‘Off we go, then.’
‘We had an agreement. I was willing to condone your little potion business in exchange for some... favors.’ I lick my lips. ‘But now I find out you’ve been handing out like Father Christmas.’
‘Do you have doubts? Don’t worry, you’re in no way obliged to have intercourse with me. If my cock’s not to your liking, we’ll just head back to the party. Plenty more fish in the sea there.’ He tucks his cock back, his stance haughty and disinterested, but Harry’s trained auror eyes don’t miss the flicker of sadness and hurt in the Count’s eyes.
Sighing, Harry puts on his long, crimson red velvet cloak. Harry loved it the moment he saw it in the shop window. It emits a sort of vintage gothic vibe, that makes Harry feel like he’s a 15th century mage. He buckles up the shiny, silver clasp on top. He steps into his dragon hide boots and grabs the basket. Not wanting to land in a tree, he apparates to the front of the forest where the wild anemones grow. Walking will do him some good, he thinks as he enters.
‘No shit.’ Malfoy grins as he halts to let Harry adjust to his cock. Harry looks at him. It’s difficult to grasp that this man, almost considerate and wanting to give Harry pleasure, is the same as his hotheaded, posh school bully and the cold blooded killer he saw earlier.
‘Do you want the cuffs on or off?’
‘When the world falls dooooown / I’m waiting for you’ He hums as he brings his plate to the kitchen. Returning to the couch, he watches the ballroom scene. He imagines Jareth kissing him there, telling him ‘Look at what I’m offering you. Your dreams.’ What would he want from Jareth? He feels his cock stir to live. A small smile tugs at his lips. Little Harry knows what it wants from Big Jareth. He snorts. His hand reaches down, into his trousers. It’s been some time since he wanked. It might calm him further.
Harry stiffens. ‘That’s not-‘
This time I pink. ‘I... I deeply care for you too, Harry. I need time to love again.’
Ooh, ooh
Bellatrix enters the tower. ‘Hello, Drapunzel’.
Warning: this part got a lot more intense than I intended. If rape and abuse triggers you, please don’t read. There’s no gore or too many details, but better be safe than sorry, okay?
‘She was a wizard?’
‘Let go. Come for me. Let me feel you come.’ The Count keeps thrusting, a tiny film of sweat forming on his beautiful face.
‘Good boy. All clean and quick about it. Let’s keep it that way. Want a chocolate bun?’ Draco picks one and eats it, his stomach growling from all the heavy labor his body has had to endure yesterday.
‘Then please come for us.’
He looks at himself in the mirror. Wow. He looks royal with the mask on. The eye sockets leave just enough space to give a glimpse of his eyes, without giving away his identity immediately. His fingers trace the pattern of the mask. The mask makes him feel strangely sensual. He feels his prick twitch a bit. Harry appreciates the feeling as it’s been a while.
Draco swallows and nods. Work can wait a little while longer. Harry gets up and starts rubbing Draco’s hair with the soft fabric of the towel, working his way down. His hands linger on his cheeks. ‘So elegant’.
‘How is it? Do you like what you see?’ Ginny licks her lips as she thrusts in again. Two taps. She grabs Harry hair and pulls him closer, her other hand on his hips. Using his hair as leverage, she fucks him, thrusting in and out. Harry writhes under her, sweat beginning to form at his beautiful body. My hips are barely able to move, but thrust up in the same rhythm. I hear the blood pounding in my ears. I’m salivating, whimpering and groaning as I watch the scene unfold before me.
‘Sorry, je ne parle pas Français. Je suis Anglais.’ I hope she’ll understand me.
‘Don’t worry, Precious. Just lick it a bit and remember what you like when someone blows you.’
Draco swallows a lump in his throat. ‘I...’ His voice is strained.
She clears her throat. ‘I want to know when you’re with Draco. I don’t want to worry sick when you’re not arriving home. I don’t know how I feel about you living somewhere else, so I really hope you’ll continue living here. Of course I don’t mind it when you sleep elsewhere some nights, but your home is here. Draco, you are always welcome too. I want you to feel at home. But when Harry and I play, I expect you to respect our... my privacy.’ Draco nods.
‘Maybe you’re just a little slut yourself? I see you getting off on chasing me. You filthy cocksucker. You should’ve called for backup when you had the change. Now it’s just you and me and my big cock, auror Malfoy.’ I have to keep from rolling my eyes at the cheesy line. He sniggers too.
Thanks @ DiverTazSC for the idea :)
Harry smiles. ‘You’re doing the Jareth thing quite well, Count Flagler.’
Malfoy growls. ‘I know what you’re trying to do, but your distraction won’t work. You can’t rile me up to get me to fight with you, so you can escape. No, Potter. I plan to fuck you. Right here. And nothing you say can undo that.’
I tap upwards, reaching for the underside of her small but perfect tits. I stroke my hands over the bottom half of her bra, kneading them, before reaching into her cleavage. I feel her shudder. ‘Auror, what are you doing?’
Mispy’s eyes widen when she sees Harry. ‘Master is having visitor stay?’ Her voice sounds astonished as she adds in a whisper: ‘Master is never having visitor stay.’
"Would you ever go back?"
After having heard (or read) so many names she recognized from Arthurian legend, Hermione made her way back to Hogwarts the next morning. Neville was in his office this time around, so she stopped to talk for a couple minutes before going back to Merlin's portrait.
Draco chuckled.
"Why aren't you dressed up? It's Halloween after all."
Merlin sighed before nodding.
"I love you too, Daddy."
"Please, call me Teddy, Mr Syiltal," Teddy smiled kindly then stuck his hand out.
That's another thing. Every time he wielded the Elder Wand, whispers were constantly telling him to do bad things. In this case, he actually listened to them. There's a reason it's also called the Deathstick.
His eyes caught the bracelet. That was new.
Neville, Charlie and George were shocked that the entrance to Salazar Slytherin's hideout was in a bathroom.
"Voldemort made me made a Horcrux."
"Oh, you know it Stark." Harry smirked and through him a wink. He jogged out of the common room then came back, "One last gift for the team. It took a bit of time, but, you know me, always doing the craziest things."
Teddy tried it just for fun. It moved a centimeter then stopped. The same happened with Steve.
He made his way closer to the Veil.
"You will make it back here. He can't lose another parent."
Teddy looked around on the ship he was on with Tony, Peter, Pietro and some man named Stephen.
"So he knows Brucey but not me. They all know Bruce but not me." Stark pouted. "But still. What's the Killing Curse and if it's supposed to be a Killing Curse, how's he still alive?"
and they exploded into tiny pieces. Then Thor got the final hit on Ultron.
Getting Loki to help him turned out to be easier than expected. In his words, "I always love messing with people. This could be very fun."
Just then, Teddy burst through the door and went directly over to Draco and hugged him. His hair and eyes were different now. He now resembled more of what he did as a baby. "I'm sorry, Draco."
- Noah Cyrus
" Tony yelled at him.
"What do you mean he needed help bringing his friends back?"
"Well, well." Thanos said.
"Can you tell me more about the legends?" Merlin asked once they were in the safety of the chambers.
"Loki." Steve said, walking up to him. "What are you intentions?"
"In a way. When I left this earth it was 2053, I think. Then when I landed in the other earth it was 1970, and now I'm back here."
It looked like Tony was about to snap before Harry whispered, "
"You, please." Draco mumbled, just staring at his baby with a smile on his face.
"Oh, Merlin..." Harry whispered and turned to Draco who had a look of concern on his face.
16- Endgame
Harry looked at his sons eyes and smiled. "Yeah, he does. And he has the iconic Malfoy blonde hair." Harry said, pointing out the small tuft of blonde hair on his head.
"It's true, just like I'm always going to be here for you."
"I'm just a man who lived through too much." He put his hands up in surrender, trying to get the spies to put down their weapons.
"What do we name them? If it's a girl, I don't think I can handle naming her Carina."
"Oh my god. Draco— I don't know what to say. I'm so sorry. This never should've happened to you. After all you both had been through. Losing a child is the worst possible experience. I can't say I've experienced it personally, but when I was sent to Azkaban, I lost Harry. I was supposed to take care of him but I lost the only opportunity I had to raise a kid. But you losing your child before ever meeting her, that's horrible, Draco. I'm so sorry you went through this."
"Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off!" Quill responded after putting his mask back on.
"Never have I ever driven drunk." Steve said.
"We're fifteen minutes out!" Clint yelled back.
Back on Titan, Thanos finally arrived. Only Stephen was there to greet him. The others were hiding.
"No. You're wrong. Harry can't die. He literally cannot die."
"You're gonna come back?"
Watching his son, Draco asked a question that had been on his mind the entirety of the meeting, 'What do you think we would've done if we stayed in the Wizarding World?'
"Nope."
Before Severus could respond, Scorpius spoke again, pointing at the screen, specifically at Draco. "Papa."
"Do you wanna tell the others?"
Harry stood by the core and ripped apart any bots that he saw that were approaching either the core, an Avenger or a citizen. Draco and Sirius were helping people on the ships and getting them to safety, occasionally using a floating charm to get them there faster.
"Merlin? As in the one that Harry visited?"
"Okay. Whatever you say," Teddy smirked and went to check out the food.
"Who's that?" It was a picture of an ultrasound. Like all magical pictures, the ultrasound of the baby was moving, showing the baby slightly moving around.
The woman stepped forward and smiled at him. "Hello, Scorpius. I'm Guinevere, but you can call me Gwen."
The end.
At points when it got really hard to be without Harry, he would pull up footage from FRIDAY of Harry with Scorpius from when he was gone.
"Yes. Potter or Malfoy..." Teddy mumbled.
Merlin, the one in the portrait at Hogwarts, could help him. She flooed into the Headmasters office. She knew the school board had made Neville Longbottom the new Headmaster. It was clear he hadn't finished moving in, but he had started. Currently the office was empty so she made her way down the staircase and to the dungeons of the school.
"What did the Horcrux inside you exactly do?"
"Well, we did stuff. I started getting sick. Like throwing up, nauseous sick. Harry was there for me, as always, but one day he asked—well, more like stated, I guess—'it's not like you're pregnant or anything, so why are you still so sick?'. And that's when I remembered—"
"The Calming Draught. You were three years old, but your father thought you should start your training to become a Potions Master early."
"Good thing you won't then. He has us magical people to help him now." Draco smiled and pulled out a pen, transfiguring it into a chair for Gwaine.
"So you're a time traveler?" Gaius asked.
"Close the Veil." Harry said, still holding his wand up to the Dementors.
"You're right. It wasn't Draco Malfoy. It was Draco Potter. You may not like Draco, but he's good for Harry. They help each other. They complement each other. You may never accept their relationship, that's your problem. But do not for one second insinuate that Draco Potter does not love Harry Potter. I have never, in my hundreds of years of living, seen a couple more in love than them.
There was silence for a bit before everyone started talking all at once.
As if right on cue, Draco walked in, out of his usual after-work sweats and in a black tux, white dress shirt and emerald green tie. "Hi, love. There's a gala that Stark invited us to. Teddy's getting ready, the Avengers left to also get ready. So, hurry up. Black, I guess you can come too. I'm assuming you don't have a suit with you, so, come with me."
It was a stressful thought, all your friends being able to die but not you. Them, all looking older and you still looking 17. Them, being able to get drinks with no question and you having to pull out your ID because you look so damn young when in reality, you're their same age. Okay, maybe not so much the last one.
"Get him to the room next to Harry's. I'll be getting ready."� Draco said then hung up the call.
"Harry!"
Steven Rogers, or Steve Rogers was a war hero who died in the 1940s in a plane crash. He had been engaged to Margaret Carter, but she moved on after years. Anthony Stark, or Tony Stark, was the heir to a gigantic company owned by his father Howard Stark. She had heard people praising the old Stark Industries when she went to the Muggle world. Stark had died in 2008 in Afghanistan after being kidnapped and tourtured for three months. The company was now owned by Obadiah Stane and his assistant Virginia Potts. Mostly everyone that spoke of Stark Industries said they missed the old era of either Howard or Tony Stark.
"Harry." Draco whispered as he ran over to him.
"Okay, okay, fine," Harry nodded, "Use the knock back spell, Dray. So we can have some time without them trying to kill us."
"Can I be the godfather?"
The rest of the ride was silent.
"Up in Tony's lab getting his metal arm fixed. Here. I'll take you."
They were going to get in the QuinJet that had been altered by Tony, Rhodey, Bruce and Rocket to make it go into space while still holding up.
"Okay, Merlin, first of all, take a breath. We'll tell them. Mordred won't be able to do anything to us, we'll put up wards around the place. He won't touch us."
"The man killed them probably." Draco whispered. "Who would so willingly kill 16 people but be against Voldemort?"
"Hi, Scorpius."� Sirius said, reaching his hands out to hug his godson.
"Like what?"
"Put him in Morgana's old chambers. You can look over him."
"We'll bring them back Harry. I swear." Steve said before patting his shoulder light and walking away with Thor and Natasha in tow.
I apologize if that is incorrect, that is what Google Translate said.
"Daddy!" Scorpius said, dropping his stuff animal and going over to hug his dad.
"What are you talking about? You belong here. We already have a room set up and everything."
Merlin laughed, "Oh, god, no. For us here it is 2053, in another world it could be 529, or 6394."
"I can't, Sev. All I think about when I see him laying here is seeing James' dead body at Godric's Hollow and how I chose revenge over staying with Harry. He was a baby and I left him."
"Hey, Harry. Let's get back to the Compound." Bruce said softly. He walked over to Harry and slowly led him towards the QuinJet.
"Alright. I was born on July 31, 1980 to James Potter and Lily Evans. The following Halloween, Peter Pettigrew told the Dark Lord Voldemort where we were living. Pettigrew was their secret keeper, meaning only he knew where we were. So basically, Voldy wanted to kill me because of a prophecy that said a boy born at the end of July wold be the one to kill him. He obviously didn't wanna take his chances so he came to out house on Halloween and killed my parents. When he shot the Killing Curse at me, it somehow rebounded and hit him instead, killing him and leaving me with the lightning scar, but he wasn't actually dead, not that we knew that until like 10 years later. Sirius Black, one of my parents best friends was assumed to have been the one that outed my parents and killed 13 muggles, non-magic folk and Peter. Which wasn't true by the way, but we'll get into that later," Harry took a breath before continuing again.
Sirius looked at the dog that had formed from Severus' wand. The dog quickly faded away but everyone had already seen it.
From what scans picked up, there were seven people detected, but there was another being that was emitting a very different kind of energy that they didn't know how to classify it. It seemed human, but it didn't at the same time.
"I love you, Harry." Draco said before he also disappeared.
"She's already here?"
"I lost my brother, my best friend, my godson, my love. I may not've gone through the same as you since my parents never loved me, but I was there when James' parents died. They were my family and I know what that's like. I want to do what I should've done all those years ago. I wanted to be there for my family but I never was. Please let me be the uncle I never was."
Following his lead, Harry Potter joined in along with Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Teddy Lupin, Neville Longbottom, Luna Lovegood, and many others.
Once they paid and sat down, Scorpius spoke up.
"What? Mordred? The one that stabbed you?!"
Bruce noticed that they were starting to circle around to the force field and spoke. "Cap, if these things circle the perimeter and get in behind us... there's nothing between them and Vision."
"Hello, Mr. Hewion. I hope you're doing well," She smiled the smile he knew she had reserved for professors at Hogwarts.
"Thank you, Sir Lancelot. Isn't that right, Merlin?" He turned to the other side to look at him.
"Doesn't that suck?"
Pietro sat down next to Scorpius on the bed. "Well now I get to give it to him when he comes back."
"That I'll live forever? Watch everyone around me die? Never be able to move on from this life? Be stuck in the body of a 17 year old forever? Have a power hungry wand that wants to multiply the power I put on every spell?"
"Bruce? Oh my god. You've been gone for so long."
"Did Draco pay for this?"
Harry chose a plain vanilla ice cream while Scorpius chose cookies and cream. Scorpius put basically a mountain of toppings while Harry just put a couple gummy bears and some sprinkles.
Banner gave him the knife. Harry cut a straight line down his forearm and let the blood drip into the cauldron. He had to cut his skin many times because he kept healing. He cleaned the knife then cut into Draco's arm, taking the smallest amount of blood and adding it into the mix. He stirred for a bit before using the Elder wand to pull on the magic surrounding the soul in the bracelet.
"It hurts." He mumbled. "There's too much."
" Drax asked.
Scorpius took the rings and nodded fiercely. "Okay."
The same thing happened with him. The 'how are you?', 'how's Draco?', 'how's Sirius?', 'are you happy?'.
"Then I'll make a deal with Death! I'll make a Horcrux! I don't want to live knowing I could've been with the only family I have left. Please..."
Merlin told him to follow him and took him into the castle. "Where'd you learn your magic?"
In reality, Harry didn't want to ride a horse, he didn't know how to ride a horse. But he was the youngest Seeker in a century without even having ridden a broom before so maybe this should be easy.
"Yeah, well, that's that." Draco finished.
called it."
"I hold more power in my body than you do in a finger." Thanos said.
"I think that's a great idea."
He had his wand out in front of him, looking around for where Draco was. Weasley looked down and saw something, Draco didn't know what.
"And what were you doing after school? Going to jail then escaping and attacking 13 year old boys!"
Teddy cast the spell. This time it worked for five minutes before starting to bleed again.
When Sirius, Severus, Teddy and the Avengers were getting on the Jet, they didn't know what to expect. An energy surge that was three times as powerful as when Harry, Draco and Teddy entered the world was not something to mess around with.
"And you?"
The Polyjuice potion Draco had faded away. Draco cursed to himself before making a run for it, putting up a shield around himself.
"Alright then. Thank you."
"Yes, well the rest of your companions don't, so shush." He turned to Merlin and made his way around the group, "Meet Arthur Killian Pendragon, Merlin Emrys Wilde, Leon Nicholas Young, Guinevere Adriana and Elyan Conan Thomas, Lancelot Dace Lane, Percival Trace Morris, and Gwaine Owen Andrews. Congratulations, you're officially citizens of New York, thanks to moi. You need to get IDs and most likely a drivers license, but that can wait for now." Tony said, before he sat down and watched the Arthurians quickly look through the package.
?" The men shrieked at the same time.
"Harry was my school rival. I didn't realize until I was... fourteen when he almost died to a dragon. But I couldn't do anything about my feelings. We were on opposite sides of a war, him fighting for the good, me fighting for the bad. I made the right choice in the end, but it took a couple years for me to realize." Draco said, scratching a bit at his arm where the Dark Mark was.
He nodded and reshrunk his trunk. "I have to go." He said before he disappeared with a pop.
Pietro basically locked himself in his room at the compound, only going out for food every once in a while but no one ever saw him considering he ran in and out in a matter of seconds. It was hard on everyone.
"Draco. He knows everything about me and my life."
"Alright, Teddy, pick a color then we'll talk." Draco laughed.
"You're supposed to be dead. I heard the Aurors talking about it."
"I cannot say. It hasn't happened yet. In six months it will happen. The real Merlin will know when."
"Okay, you're starting to scare me, Draco." Sirius frowned.
"Tony, Pepper. Who's this lovely girl?"
"As I'll ever be."
The portrait had an intricate gold frame with what was believed to be the castle of Camelot as the background. Merlin himself was an old man in red robes. His face had wrinkles and a long white beard.
“Yeah. Scorpius Leandro Potter. He's perfect. Right now, I'm thinking Ravenclaw, he loves learning. But he's also very sneaky and caring and rebellious."
"He's my son..." Sirius whispered. "I may only his godfather, but he's as good as my son. Even though I chose to leave him when he needed me the most."
Snape went quiet for a bit before he nodded. "I know the basics of wand making, I might be able to help with that. Is there anything else?"
They all laughed.
He was paler than usual, making the scar on his forehead more prominent. The shirt that he wore (which Natasha saw him wear multiply times) that normally form fitting for him looked like it was two sized two big for him. It also didn't help when his hair had started to grow out and Natasha knew that if he could grow a beard, he would have stubble at this point.
"Oh thank Merlin. I thought you were gonna kill me."
"The language of reptiles, snakes in general."
"Argo Pyrites."
is what the chapter was called.
"What if..." Severus whispered. He kneeled down and took the circlet off his head. He put it around his wrist then shrunk it down to the size of his wrist.
Hope you had happy holidays and a happy new year!
"I mean no. But—"
After he had woken everyone up (if he had to jump on beds to get some of them up, no one mentioned it because they all loved him too much), they made their way to the Christmas tree for presents. They were all in their pajamas, of course, but Tony had gotten the couples (or soon to be couples, in his opinion) or best friends matching pajamas and no one knew until they were all together.
"There were four of them. James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew. They were the best pranksters at Hogwarts, only to be rivaled by Fred and George Weasley around 18 years later. My dad James and Sirius were friends since before Hogwarts. They met Remus because he was lost on his way to Charms and instantly became friends. Then they found Peter also lost on their way to Transfiguration. All of them were Gryffindor."
"Camelot?"
If only it would stay happy.
Harry was about to curse, but then he remembered his son was there. "Right… I'll figure something out." He said, already planning something out.
Hermione, on the other hand who was hiding beneath her desk, cast a charm that would transmit her voice to the whole building, "Attention. This is Minister Hermione Granger. Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy are in the building. I repeat, Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy are in the building! All staff either take cover or help find Draco Malfoy." She ended the charm and stood up, casting a spell to detain Harry.
"First of all, yes I would. And second, he's a Metamorphous."
, that's our newspaper, was controlled by the Ministry, our government, and blah blah blah, the Ministry just wanted a reason for Draco to be sentenced to Azkaban, our prison, terrible, terrible place, zero out of five stars, would not recommend. I was sentenced with attempted murder, murder and assist in murder, none of which were completely true. Attempted murder because I shot a curse at someone with more power than I was supposed to. Murder because I murdered the Dark Lord who I was raised to kill, so I mean... And assist in murder because when I was 14, a boy at my school died during the Triwizard Tournament, and there were no witnesses so everyone thought I killed him or helped with killing him, which I didn't by the way. I watched him get murdered terribly by one of my father's ex-best friends. Long story short, we were in hiding until 2053 when we decided to take over the Ministry, found Teddy along the way, who is my godson and Draco's cousin, he begged us to come with. Accidentally got caught, had to battle my ex-best friend who was the Minister at the time and we fell through the Veil and here we are."
Harry and Draco had both gotten tattoos over the years. It was Draco's idea to find a spell to get tattoos, so they did. Harry's first tattoo was the Draco constellation, tattooed over his heart. Draco found it cheesy at first, but loved it so much. Draco got small narcissus flowers and lilies tattooed on his side, representing both their mothers. Harry also got a small Snitch tattooed behind his ear and the Deathly Hallows symbol on the wrist he has the bracelet. He also had a stag, a black mutt and a wolf tattooed on his hip bone for his past Patronus, his father, Sirius and Remus. They decided to get a matching tattoo. Of course, they had to pick a dragon after their Patronus. It's a small dragon that had their wedding date written by the tail. They have the dragon on their collarbones.
"I'll always love you, too."
Draco gladly took the hand and shook it. As he did, Teddy gasped slightly, looking at Draco with wide eyes.
"No. Just of the Healers report that its us and that we're dead. But your friend Granger is still the Minister. We might just have to go and do this now."
Harry gripped Draco's arm in an attempt to conceal his laughter, Draco seemingly also trying not to laugh.
. Scorpius kept asking when his dad was gonna wake up, Draco would always respond with, "Soon."
She had gone to Gringotts to pick something stuff up when the Goblins had informed her that there was a trunk addressed to Hermione and the Weasleys.
"Once you're safely through, I will go back to Earth. Do you have everything you need?"

"It's coming! It's coming! It's coming! I got it! I got it.... !" Peter said when he finally got the fingers loose from the gauntlet.
"Wow. This is amazing." He breathed, walking around the library and stopping when he saw a bunch of pictures. "Who's that?" He pointed towards a picture of a man who looked similar to Harry dancing with a beautiful redhead.
"I could say the same thing," Harry pulled away, placing a kiss on his lips, "Now where's my godson?"
Harry sat on the floor of his bedroom in the compound. He finally let himself cry. Another death followed him. First his parents. Then Cedric, Dumbledore, Dobby, Fred, Remus, Tonks and now Teddy, Draco and Sirius.
"As far as I know, Arthur doesn't have anyone he wants to be his Queen."
"After all these years, magic never ceases to amaze me." Clint gushed.
One day, Natasha had called Harry to the compound.
"Don't worry, Prongslet. I'll go with them to make sure nothing illegal happens."
"Right! You did that after your schools years!"
"Hi, yeah, excuse me. They're also really confused over here." Stark said.
"Well. I lived in a place called the Wizarding World. It's truly amazing. Brooms that fly higher than anything you've ever seen. Animals that can talk to certain people. Toys that speak on their own. The clothes were horrifying. Portraits that are alive and speak. Pictures that move. Ghosts that help wherever they can. Owls that deliver packages. Goblins that manage money. Fireplaces that can transport you. Dragons and merfolk that will most likely kill you if not treated correctly. Wanda that harness your power. Potions that could put a stopper on death. Schools to learn how to correctly use magic.
Teddy watched as Quill turned to Thanos with horror in his eyes.
Simple! Not.
"Oh, yes. The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches. Born to those who have thrice defied, born as the seventh month dies. And the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not. And either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives."
"Lucy, I think this might've been a terrible plan."
I have now realized, as I'm writing the future chapters, there will be 18 chapters.
A couple seconds later, George came down, then Neville, then Charlie.
"Yes, Merlin. You can date, marry, court whoever you want."
"Death Eaters. Voldemort's followers. A lot were caught by the Ministry and sent through the Veil. I'm assuming they either ended up here or hopped around like me."
"So, it wasn't you who stalked me for a week about 2 months ago?"
"Different times, Harry." Sirius explained. "Time works differently."
Harry slapped Sirius.
"Don't you dare hurt Draco." He snarled. Behind his back he was slowly casting a spell that would release him.
Bruce looked shocked. No one ever wanted to actually see him do it. He just did it for the necessary task at hand.
"The wolf's child?"
When he arrived at the banquet, Draco Malfoy and Teddy Lupin were the only ones there. Harry walked up to them and looked at Teddy.
"And?"
Tony spluttered, "You just mixed random things?"
"Alright." Harry nodded, putting his water down and walking back out to the mats.
"I doubt it. He wouldn't kill Dray no matter how much he hated Lucius, Bellatrix or Snape."
Draco paused. No one had called him Malfoy since before he and Harry disappeared. Especially since Draco chose to take Harry's surname (not legally yet though, of course).
Fury didn't even bother stopping, just showed the man at the main desk a fake FBI badge and made his way to the elevator. He went up to Potter's floor and found his desk.
"Hey, Scorp." Draco called, catching the boys attention, "Do you wanna go see Daddy?"
"Just like our son is going to be." Harry said as he kissed Draco's stomach. "Hey, Scorpius. It's your dad. I love you so much. I'll always love you. No matter what happens."
"Well, I mean yeah. You guys are family and you kinda did just make Tony your sons godfather."
"And it kept going from there. We never established anything, but I think everyone knew we kinda liked each other. Even Teddy could feel the sexual tension and he was a child. Four years after his mom died, he became Head Healer and seeing as I was Head Auror, we had to discuss things regarding everything. We never did anything crazy, maybe a couple kisses and a one-night stand, we were just friends. I had heard the rumors that the Ministry thought I was going crazy for befriending a Malfoy. But I obviously ignored them, you know how much I enjoy avoiding things like that. Then I found out they were true. At the ten year anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts, before the speeches and when Draco got shot, I heard some wizards and witches gossiping when they saw me talking to Draco. They worked under Shacklebolt too! Kingsley was the Minister at the time. I heard them saying that they were only there to make sure I didn't go crazy and end up killing everyone there and become a new Dark Lord. Apparently, Kingsley thought Little Harry Potter would follow in Voldemort's foot steps. I had all the traits too. Master of the Elder Wand, friends with a Malfoy, power that not even he knows of, immortal, y'know, the usual Dark Lord stuff.
Another thing that came with the seventh month (and really with the whole pregnancy) was setting up the nursery. They had one in the Potter house, the Tower and the Compound (but they weren't supposed to know about that one yet). The one in the Tower was very simple considering they wouldn't be living there for much longer but just in case the compound wasn't ready by the time the baby came (which was unlikely). It had a crib, a rocking chair, a dresser with a changing station and a chest of toys. Very simple, but it could be needed.
"They're magical photos, so they move." Draco explained when he saw Scott pick one up and look a bit shocked.
Harry held Teddy for a while but let go before it would get too long and too suspicious. He turned to Draco, "Where's Andromeda?"
"Truth or dare." Tony said, once he passed out a bottle of beer to everyone.
"Easy. Live through a war when you're a child. Be the center of all the bad guys attention, meaning they want to kill you every chance they get. Oh! And don't forget the abusive relatives." Harry shrugged, unzipping the top half of the uniform to look at the bruise that was already fading from where the arrow hit.
Draco hadn't bothered to dress up, all Harry did was throw on some old robes and called himself a student. Teddy changed his appearance to look more like his father, saying he was going as a werewolf. Sirius pulled on a leather jacket, jeans, white shirt and Doc Martens he borrowed from Draco (he hadn't had a chance to get his own clothes that didn't look like rags or clothes that are a hundred years old) and called it a day.
"What exactly are the Deathly Hallows?"
"Shh… Harry. It's me. It's Merlin. Let me help you." He crouched down on his knees and placed a hand on Harry's bracelet. "
"And I suppose, I'll have you protecting my arse every second of every day."
Once Harry left, Sirius followed Draco out of the kitchen and into the master bedroom.
"More than anything."
Harry hugged Draco as everyone around them cheered. Including the 13 people who said it was a girl.
Thanos did as he was told and let go of Peter. Everyone else just stopped moving and watched as a boy with blue hair flowing in the wind was ind controlling a Mad Titan.
Draco took Scorpius in his arms before turning back to Bruce, "He's our son. Scorpius Leandro Potter. And the one that was holding him is my godfather, Severus Snape. He's about a year and a half old."
Then came the Cailleach. George had given Harry some advice once he was filled in on what happened with her. He had told him to just tell his team because in the long run, they were the ones who were gonna help him with the Mordred slash Morgana issue.
, but that would probably make him even more confused.
"Why don't you join us? We were on our way back to Camelot anyway." Arthur suggested.
Scorpius smiled and sat up. "Can we go get ice cream?"
"Harry, it's fine. We didn't know you could even come visit us. They don't need to know if you don't want them to," George said.
"Unique name for someone in the States."
"Hey, hey. Come on Teddy, keep your eyes open for me, okay?"
"Open it!" Harry said, laughing a bit.
"Come in." He called. The squire opened the door and only walking in a couple paces before speaking.
I was on a small hiatus the past two weeks which is why there were no updates. Sorry about that. We're back to our normal weekly updates now!
"Well, my parents were named James and Lilian Black." He was so tempted to say Potter, but he knew he couldn't. "They died when I was young so the title of Lord was passed to my uncle, Sirius. Then he died two years ago and I gained the title."
"Hi. I don't think we've been properly introduced. I'm Teddy Lupin. Or Potter." He stuck his hand out.
"I'm making a speech once this thing starts. I was really confused as to why at first, but I figured it out later. She wants people to realize that not all ex-Death Eaters are bad, or something," Draco shrugged, seeming to be rather calm as an ex-Death Eater, though he still wore long-sleeves to basically everywhere he went to cover the Dark Mark. "Are you making a speech? I'm assuming you are, considering you're the one to thank for us being alive."
So, she kept reading.
"The mutt?"
So, when the twins finally decided to join the Avengers, Teddy was more than ecstatic to help them. His hair even turned a gold-yellow color to show his happiness (to which the twins were really confused about, but didn't question it as they also had powers that no one completely understood). He helped Wanda and Pietro get changed and helped them understand what they were fighting for.
"No!" Harry screamed.
"We can assume that it's the solar eclipse on June 10th, if Mordred wants to meet you on June 3rd, a week before the ecplise. We can assume he's going to try to tell you something about Morgana. Question is, who are you taking?" Severus questioned.
Thor dragged Steve along to the bar, Clint, Natasha and Bruce went over to the pool tables, Sirius and Teddy also went to the bar while Draco, Harry and Tony went to the photographers.
"Draco?" The man whispered. He lowered his wand and moved closer to them. He noticed the other two men and stiffed as he looked at Sirius. "Black? I thought you died."
Tony smiled but his smile soon faded when he didn't see any books or anything with him."
The next couple minutes were filled with reunions.
He hadn't exactly told anyone what he was doing besides Loki and George.
"Steve..."
Clint looked up and saw Pietro on his knees over the supposedly dead body of Teddy.
" Draco's voice called from the communicator.
"Decent. Meetings and one surgery. Just one. We couldn't even save the woman. There was too much damage." Harry tilted his head in confusion as if to ask 'what happened?'. "Car crash. She was driving and flew through the windshield when another woman slammed into the side of the car. The other one is still unconscious, has been since they finished her surgery a while ago. But, enough rambling, what about you?"
Teddy smiled slightly and Draco opened his shield to let Teddy in.
Draco had finished speaking to Teddy by the time the Auror was rushing over to them. Harry grabbed Draco's hand and they apparated away.
Harry showed Severus the bracelet. There was a crack right over the Hallows symbol, basically cutting it in half. "I've looked everywhere but no where does it say why the symbol of Death could be broken. I'm the Master of Death for god sake! Why would now, after so many years, why would it break now?!"
"Keep fighting while shot. The newbies Fury picks up normally can't do that."
"You killed half the universe and you expect us not to come back?" Tony said, glancing at Harry, who cast a disillusionment charm on himself and got to work.
"Two years. Tony's been helping me. There hasn't been activity for two years until now."
Lucius actually had the audacity to gasp. As if he cared about his son one bit. "You killed him."
"What, it's not like you slept together." Rhodey joked.
Sirius and Harry took a shot.
Teddy came up to him one day and blurted out, "I'm engaged!"
Scorpius and Morgan were matching because they were children and wanted in on the fun.
Harry turned around and smiled at his old friend. "Minister Granger. How lovely to see you."
From inside the Jet, the others watched as two dragons, a wolf, a dog and a non-corporal Patronus were formed.
"Names and titles?" Griphook asked a couple minutes later.
"Yeah. I'm sorry about kinda killing him when I first showed up. I saw the silver hair and my first reaction was Lucius Malfoy and I shot the killing curse at him. I'm so sorry."
Severus was intent on learning as much as he could, seeing as Bruce wasn't here meaning he was the one in charge of delivering the baby because of his experience as a medi-witch which was needed to become a Potions Master. SO far he knew how to deliver the baby safely but was still trying to figure out how to make sure Draco survived as well. Male pregnancies were rare (it was known that they could happen but since same sex marriage isn't that accepted in the Wizarding World, it didn't happen much) so they weren't documented that well. Plus the fact that they only have a limited library didn't help either. As far as Severus knew, there were only 600-700 male pregnancies and maybe only 400 of the carriers had survived. It was really risky but it was too late, he had to find a way to make sure both Draco and his baby survive.
"Did you get what you were looking for?"
Just then, Teddy came running in, "Energy surge. Large one. We need Avengers. Tony, Nat, Steve, Clint and Thor are already suiting up."
"He's going to die eventually, Harry... We won't like it, but its going to happen. Maybe we can convince him to make a Horcrux, but I don't know."
"Draco, where are we going?" Sirius asked as they were heading away from their house.
Neville nodded and cast a
"This is very... nice." Snape said quietly.
Weirdly enough, they all became a family. The Avengers still didn't know the full extent of the Potters and Sirius' past, but they knew it was shitty.
Clint nodded and smiled at the slightly moving baby.
- Alec Benjamin
"He's my cousin. I will protect him with my dying breath. And my name is not Malfoy! It's Draco Lucius Potter! Get it right!" Draco yelled, sending a curse at Hermione, that was deflected by the mini-Weasley.
"Minister Granger!" Many reporters were calling.
"The sign of soulmates." Severus said.
"Children that grew up around you," Severus drawled.
"Thankfully, we did make it here, so none of that is going to come true. At least I hope it won't." Harry said quickly after seeing his husbands face of sadness.
"That's Severus Snape. My godfather." Draco whispered.
Sirius nodded and turned into his animagus. It was the same black dog that Harry recognized from third through fifth years. The supposed grim that Trelawney said was his death omen for the year.
It seemed like everyone stood up. Then, Arthur kneeled. Then the Knights, Gwen and Merlin, following their King. Then the original six Avengers. Then Bucky, Rhodey, Sam, Maria, Wanda, Pietro and Carol. Then the Potters and everyone else. The last to kneel was Fury and he did so reluctantly.
Infinity War
"Are you kidding? Vocatis? Seriously? You might not have been the one who was disowned and thrown into jail but have you no respect for Cervisia? Best wine company ever. James introduced it to us. Their Sermo? Best thing ever."
"Thor." He nodded in response. He turned to Tony, "I come bearing information."
Loki walked out of Harry's room and leaned against the doorframe. "The Once and Future King. How lovely to finally meet you." He smirked.
