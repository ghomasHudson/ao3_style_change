“Please tell me that the one in the Chamber of Secrets is the one that houses half of his soul!” Bellatrix nods and that takes a bit of stress off his shoulders. At least only one student can speak parsel and it just so happens that the student is the Dark Lord’s grandson. Two birds with one stone. He isn’t sure what will happen once they are in Harion’s possession or if the boy would even work with him to find them. Given their current predicament, Severus doubted it. “Okay, then where is the second one?”
Draco curiously wondered.
Dumbledore smiled and dropped his wand. He looked awfully at peace with the fact that Draco had just murdered someone right in front of him.
"Merlin, what was that?" he cursed. He was obviously referring to Potter's display of strength. Not the odd tingle that ran up Draco's spine.
"Fine. I give up," Blaise declared. "I won't act like an overprotective boyfriend anymore, but eat this apple first."
He mentally cursed himself for giving Potter a hint as to where he was going to be, but he forced himself to act as if he didn't care while he walked away from Potter.
And Draco can't handle it because-- "They're Animagi?! Harry, why didn't you tell me?!"
Draco was hanging dangerously close to the ground. His hands were on Potter's chest in which could easily be considered romantic. His normally neat hair was most definitely tousled and his face was dangerously close to Potter's. And Potter was carrying his weight while in-between Draco's slightly bent legs, one hand defiantly pressed on the floor while the other was tightly wrapped around Draco's back.
Shaking his head, Draco let out a low chuckle. "Don't be. You didn't make me do anything. I wanted to."
Draco's cousin, Nymphadora Tonks, and Shacklebolt took care of her.
"Do you want thisss?"
"Really?
Pansy, for some reason, was exceptionally pleased. She kept murmuring, "About damn time," even when Draco and Harry finally joined them and the room erupted into louder cheers.
Draco swallowed. "Lately, I've been wondering why it happened to me, but not to anyone else. I had a lot of guesses such as magical signatures and blood heritage, but when it turns out Harry had it too, I had the insane thought that maybe I could find a clue in the flowers. And I did. Our mothers, Harry. What is one thing our mothers have in common?"
“Handsome doesn’t just describe you properly, Harry,” Draco said. “Even if it did, you’re much more than your looks. And I don’t love you because of your stupidly green eyes and your perfectly unkempt hair. You know I hate how you can move boulders with your eyes and frustrate me with your impossible to tame hair. No, I love you because you’re kind and honorable, and you care so much about the little things that it’s nearly impossible for me to believe how incredible you can be sometimes. Not only that, but everything you do, you do it for love. You hated me during Hogwarts because you loved your best friend. You fought in the war because you loved your family. You became a teacher because you loved children. You even proposed to me because you’re in love with Scorpius and me— and that’s saying quite a bit about how insane you are as well,” Draco huffed. “But, I don’t mind that at all. So if you think, for even one second, that I will one day ‘wake up’ and ‘realize that I can do so much better than you’, then I’ll be here to tell you to shut up. I already can do so many things better than you— baking and putting Scorpius and James to bed easily are just two examples— but there’s absolutely no one else I’d rather love. Do you understand that, Harry James Potter-Malfoy?”
Of course, Draco didn't believe him. Now, he did. But before, he didn't.
Blaise rolled his eyes, taking his seat again and picking up his fork. There were a string of murmurs that rang around them, but Draco refused to acknowledge them as he took his seat again.
"What?" Draco slurred. "But... but you were angry during lunch today. And Montague is a good-looking, cool bloke!"
That night, for the very first time all term, Draco didn't get a single bit of homework done.
She arched a perfect brow. "Why would you purposely make him be a distraction for not only yourself, but for your other classmates?"
Professor Hayes frowned. "Yes, and does this apply to your following statements? The fact that they are 'factual' pieces of information that you had acquired from... in delicate, inaccurate words, other people of higher authority?"
Granger looked up thoughtfully. "I just wanted to." She then paused. "Actually, I think it's because you're not going to bother me like everyone else does. I doubt you're going to ask me to marry you."
Draco glanced towards him, almost instantly looking away. "What are you talking about? Yes, I did. We didn't share anything with each other until then."
"Alright. Well, have you considered taking the Dreamless Draught? I'm sure Poppy has plenty in the Hospital Wing."
"Potter, I don't think you understand how difficult, complex, and utterly incredible wandmakers are," Draco sighed. "You can't just
"No, Draco, don't have that look on your face." Pansy sighed, rubbing her eyes tiredly.
When they arrived at the Slytherin table, Pansy, Blaise, and Theo absolutely refused to take a seat before Draco did. Grumbling about it, Draco complied. Then, as if a nonexistent switch was flipped, Blaise waved a protective charm around all four of them and sat next to him. He promptly laid out all the scrolls and started jotting down additional notes without even glancing up. Pansy placed a warm biscuit on Draco's plate. Theo then poured Draco a glass of orange juice, not even looking up from his book.
Draco huffed. "No."
Harry shook his head ‘no’. “Not now.”
"And why would you propose this?" Severus asked, his tone finally indicating an emotion other than exasperation and annoyance.
How Draco hadn't believed Harry before when he said that he loved him; how Draco know understood what he meant. How rven though he wasn't yet, he thought it would be easy to fall in love with him as well.
Harry wiped his hand on his robes, pausing when he felt wetness against fabric. It resembled the feeling of a clean sock in a puddle— disgusted and uncomfortable.
Potter groaned again, but held the proper posture for the entire minute that Draco counted aloud. When he relaxed, Draco was pleased to note that he did not revert to his original, horrible habit of slouching over like a crippled old man. He was still slouching, of course, but it wasn't that bad. Draco felt the tiniest bit proud too, though he quickly pushed this feeling down. He counted to fifteen seconds before instructing Potter to begin posturing properly again.
"Potter, I didn't call you here for you to interrogate me," Draco sneered.
Giggling, she left them alone and made her way over to their other guests, smiling and chatting them up before sliding to Theo's side. The lanky Slytherin looked down at her in surprise, but handed her a blue cup anyways. "Party pooper."
"Huh..." Potter huffed. Draco breathed a sigh of relief. "Yeah, I guess you're right, Malfoy."
"I literally have no idea what you just said," Harry replied.
Thus, all Draco couldn’t comprehend was why the flashes of green kept catching him off-guard.
"Okay. Got it." Potter's smile was radiant, the smile slightly withering when Draco stopped walking. "Oh. You have Defense right now?"
"Well, yes and no. That's not the answer I'm looking for, but it's a good start," Draco said.
Letting his mind wander, Draco realized how much he wanted to tell Potter about Hyacinthe. He wanted to tell Potter about how they would have gotten along all this time if his uncle Regulus and Hyacinthe remained good friends.
Potter sighed, relenting. "Fine. How would you say I should do so?"
Harry didn't respond, simply taking off with their friends and leaving Draco alone with the Death Eaters. Draco tensed when he heard a nasty cackle.
His heart felt lighter and his whole being craved that life.
Rolling his eyes, Draco stuffed the chocolate into his robes' pockets. "You've already given him chocolates before. I believe that is first-name worthy."
"That's well enough," Draco said then.
But then the world spun and bile rose in his throat. A familiar feeling was returning. One that Draco had successfully avoided for three days now. All the signs were pointing otherwise, but Draco refused to believe that he was in love with Harry. After all, he could just see the way that Harry would look at him if he found out: with horror, with disgust, and with discomfort. And then he'd say the bloody 'I'm sorry I don't feel the same way' that would kill Draco and—
"That's good."
Debating whether or not he should bring up more refined clothing, Draco decided to settle for the hair like his partner said. "I wouldn't've if you simply maintained it."
Hermione folded her arms, now grumpy.
," Harry argued. "Who would be alright with dying like— like that? It's bloody, and painful, and—"
Draco simply waited it out and took Harry's hand into his.
Narcissa slowly took out the pouch that Yvy had helped her find, placing it in Draco's left hand. "This, my darling, is a Black heirloom. It's connected to several vaults, libraries, and kitchens. At any given time, you can feed the pouch a bit of your magic— a simple charm should do the trick— and it will give you precisely what you needed."
"Cookies?" Harry repeated.
Draco sighed.
When all was done, Draco tiredly maneuvered himself to the bathroom and cleaned the blood that stained his silk pajamas. He ended it up throwing the pair away. Much like how he ended up throwing away his bedsheets and pillowcases. He cleaned the room to the best of his abilities, gathering the petals at such a slow rate he was almost afraid that his mother or someone would wander in and find him sitting on the cold tiles surrounded by bloodied flowers.
Pansy blinked slowly as though he started speaking French to her. As though he was stupid enough to talk to her in a language she doesn't understand.
Draco didn't even hesitate before disagreeing. "No."
Malfoy got halfway to shaking it when he stopped. "What do I have to do? To pay you back if I say yes?"
"Have any of you seen where Pansy is? I need to make sure she's tuned the piano correctly. And dusted and charmed it the exact way I've told her a countless number of times."
. Quidditch is a dangerous sport, and there are too many risks up there for you."
Harry’s smile wavers. “Ray. Draco. Lucius’s son. The one you’re looking for.”
Draco somewhat smiled at that and continued his search for Potter's present with Blaise by his side. Every so often, Blaise would point out an object that caught his eye and Draco would turn to give the object a once-over. However, he rejected all of these things. They weren't enough for Potter; they weren't worthy enough.
"Alright."
Harry shrugged. "Still doesn't change the fact that you're good at potions."
So the Potter-Malfoy wedding was going to be on October 31, 2000.
"Sure," he said smoothly. "Oh, and before I forget, McGonagall left for the Ministry, Goldstein. She wanted me to pass on the message that you're suspended, Goldstein."
Harry let out a weak, tearless sob.
Draco's eyes softened. "Yes. I'd agree with Ron in that case."
And one may call it unreasonable jealousy, but Draco merely did not want to even face the prospect of losing people he cared about. He already didn’t have many things now— a future, familial trust, and hope— but his friendship with Pansy, Blaise, and Theo (Vince and Greg too obviously... though Draco wouldn’t tell them anything since they are the epitome of the worst people to tell secrets) was the one thing that he was sure he still had.
For some reason, he just knew that Potter was going to forget his copy of the script again and that they were going to have to press their shoulders together to read Draco's copy together. It made him feel strangely giddy inside, a feeling which Draco hated bubbling in his stomach. He skillfully avoided having this hatred from rising to the surface.
Sorry for taking so long to update this. I lost a little bit of inspiration and kind of took a break. Hopefully, I can pick it up again but we'll see.
“No of course not.” Harion rolls his eyes and begins walking toward the entrance to the chamber. It was probably around dinner time by now. They would be leaving for break tomorrow, so he probably needed to show his face for a little. He really needed to speak with Draco. “But it’s better than being bald and not having a nose.” Marvolo scoffs and rolls his eyes before disappearing.
“That it is, little one. If you write in it, we can converse. However, be warned, should it fall into the hands of someone who does not retain my direct lineage, they will die a most painful death.” Harion nods sharply and presses the book into his chest protectively. “Only you should be able to feel the magic coming from it. Everyone else should see nothing more than a blank journal. There is another one, I believe, housed in the school. I often get a small feeling of it being here, but it is hidden away somewhere far from this chamber. I’d say near the highest floors and hidden by a great deal of magic.”
“Well, maybe it’s a good thing you’re all dying out.” The red-headed Weasley boy sneers as he walks past them to find his seat at Gryffindor table. “You’re all slimy little death-eaters in training anyway.”
Harion stands and gathers his bag following the quite hissing down the hall a bit further to the abandoned girl’s lavatory. What snake would be hiding in the bathroom? Harion could feel his magic shifting toward something as if it was reaching out for him calling to him. Something dark and alluring was drawing him closer to the sinks and he found his feet following the call without a fight. His mother had said that ancient pureblood familial magic could feel like this. Her exact words were hypnotic and dark in relation to the darkest of Black family magic.
Bellatrix nods and glances down at Harry. He knows that she was going to tell the Goblin that Harry was adopted, and it was something they rarely spoke about. For Harry, he hated reliving those moments he spent with those retched muggles. For Bellatrix the time she spent before having him as a child were some of her worst moments.
“Yes, I was quite fond of him. He was two years or so younger than you. He was lovely, at least in my memories. He was intelligent and diligent. His letters were different than the persona he put up, but he was real, and I adored him, or at least that is what my memories show right now. You know how these things go.” Narcissa nods having remembered several breakthroughs that turned dark after the next session. “The mind healers think that there as a widespread memory charmed used on several people that occurred through old magic or someone using blood magic. It would make sense I suppose considering what I know about this man and his future following the absolution of our bonding contract.”
Blaise raises an inquisitive eyebrow at Harry. “It certainly sounds to me that you have your own doubts or agenda here. Care to share?” Blaise was intuitive and had learned from his mother how to read people. He was the only one other than Pansy out of all the Slytherins who could call out Harry or Draco and get away with it without their heads being snipped off by Draco. At times, it could be quite irritating.
The two sisters share a look before apparating away with a loud pop.
“Will they be upset if we’re not?”
Harion leaves the room as quickly as possible. He could feel his pureblood mask cracking as quick as his steps through the dungeons. He barely registers that he was running, and it was bad for the image of a proper wizarding Lord to run. He doesn’t even murmur the password to the common room. Instead, he hisses for the doors to open in broken parseltongue. The doors open and he steps into the room to find Draco and the other first years huddles around the fireplace. They looked to have been in deep discussion but that had paused upon him stepping foot into the common room.
Harry reaches forward and places a restrictive hand on Draco’s shoulder. Draco’s warmth even seeps through the heavy fabric of their school cloaks. He’d always loved how nicely the blonde’s heat felt against his skin. It felt like home. “What need Black to keep you back? How sad that the son of a death eater needs to restrain you.” Blaise watches as Harry’s eyes narrow and he nearly moves to attack the redhead when Snape sweeps between them.
I've changed the Gaunt family tree up a bit. Originally Voldemort was born in 1926. Merope died that year. Her father died a year later. In this story, Merope and Morfin were both Marvolo's children and were born to his first wife. After she died, he remarried Isadora Selwyn and had Marvolo II (Harry's grandfather). For my own references, I made myself a family tree that I can post somewhere if anyone would like. I haven't listed death dates or anything yet though I probably should lol.
“Very well then.”
Harry always hated this part of meeting with the Goblins. The teller Goblins were always grumpier than the account managers. Harry would be too if he had to deal with stupid wizards all day arguing about their money.
“Draco claimed her as a snake.” Pansy whispers.
“How is your mother doing Harry?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Mother killed them. Tortured them to death and burnt their home to the ground with the most fiendish of flames.” Harion relaxes into the man who still had not released him. His magic was so warm. It felt so similar to his own; it was like a breath of fresh air. “Her mind had been shattered following the death of James Potter, her betrothed. She fell in love with me the instant she saw me and sought to raise me as her own. Sirius Black being the then heir, now the head, of the Black family had enacted ancient familial magic to magically adopt me into their ranks making her claim over me a righteous one so long as I was to be bonded to a member of the family.”
Flint sighs in agitation when Ronald finally finds his seat. “I often wonder how the brilliance of the twins came from that family. It seems with the more of them born the dumber they become.” Marcus shakes his head at the thought of how lowly the once great Weasley clan had fallen. The twins were brilliant wizards and had they been placed in Slytherin they likely would have excelled far past the binds they’ve been put in by being placed in Gryffindor.
“Now, now. We cannot be too rash. He’s got to have gotten the idea from someone somewhere, no?” Harry glances up at Pansy acknowledging her point briefly before returning to his book. He’d been having his mother mail them to him because all the ones he wanted to read in the library were seemingly borrowed out all the time by the bookish Gryffindor with bushy hair. Harry had also heard whispers that the others were not quite nice to her either and that had made him significantly unhappy. It was on the tip of his tongue to let it slip to Theo, whose unhealthy obsession had only grown, that there were whispers in the walls that his little Gryffindor was being treated less than pleasantly. “Probably from his siblings or hag of a mother.”
Several purebloods of other houses that honor the old ways can be seen offering a food and beverage to the center of the table in front of them. Many appear to be vanishing food and drinks, likely to set up an altar to the dead in private rather than in the presence of their unknowing housemates. Halloween, as the muggles call it, is much different than Samhain. It merely for fun and to gorge ones-self full of candy and sweets whereas their weekly long celebration of the dead is much more respectful.
Sorry for the super long period without an update. I was recently diagnosed with celiac disease and before my diagnosis, I was incredibly ill for months on end. I didn't have the energy to do much of anything because I felt so sick much less write. Now that I'm beginning to get back to feeling like myself again I hope to update more! Please enjoy this chapter and look forward to more coming soon!
Theodore looks around at the small group of first years in shock but also tremendous worry. “Hermione is still in the bathrooms on the second floor. She doesn’t know!” Harry nods sharply knowing that they would likely get into a wonderful amount of trouble if they went after the young witch.
of October 1981. Almost Ten years ago to the date.” Sirius barks out a laugh and leans back in his chair sounding almost neurotic.
He does not really want to admit how much weight came off his shoulders at the thought that he wouldn’t be a good fit in Gryffindor. On the train he had wondered if his birth parents would be disappointed if he didn’t follow in their footsteps to Gryffindor but the thought had quickly been pushed aside in favor of concentrating on the game of exploding snap Dray had tucked into his robe pockets for the train ride.
Silence descends on the room and Bellatrix realizes that she had never in fact even thought of sharing the revelation with Severus when it was revealed to her at Gringotts. The thought of him being Harion’s father crossed her mind fleetingly before being overshadowed by the fact that Lily was a Gaunt and the daughter of the Dark Lord. She’d never stopped to even think of contacting Severus. Now that she had, she was not sure she wanted to. Not only would he have the ability to claim guardianship rights over Harion, but he also might not even believe her and treat Harion even worse than he already does. Severus was a tricky man and would not believe her words alone. Selfishly she wanted to keep this from him to protect her own right to her son but on the other hand, Harion deserved to know the last living biological parent he had left.
Narcissa reaches out and wraps a tight hand around Bellatrix’s trying to sooth her knowing how chaotic her thoughts may be after another memory clearing up. “I apologize cousin. Bella…her mind was fractured during the war. She had been under the imperius for so long and when the curse was finally broken…” Narcissa trials off to leave Sirius to connect the dots.
“The Black library of course. The Black family is long known to be the keepers of the darkest of secrets known to magic. Mother allowed me free reign of the Black libraries. She never wished to limit me of anything.” Harry closes his eyes tightly a small sliver of longing for his time spent with his mother hollowing out his chest. “Even the most retched of books if I desired their knowledge mother would disengage their warding for me or read them aloud to me. Any knowledge she had she sought to teach me.”
“If James and Lily figured everything out, don’t you think that Sirius would have figured out things were not right as well?” Bellatrix finds herself leaning forward in her chair in excitement. Sirius was strong-willed and had a stubbornness that often put even Narcissa’s will to shame. If anyone could break a memory charm, Sirius Black could. “I don’t believe Sirius would have killed his best friend, a man who was like his brother. They were not stupid enough to make their closest friend, something known to everyone in wizarding Britain, as their secret keeper especially if they knew that someone was manipulating them.”
The doors of the manor open before Bellatrix before she was even aware that she had arrived at the front of the manor. Her mind was in chaos, as it often was after a visit with the healers and a breakthrough, but today was markedly worse because she knew she had to collect herself to pick up her son tomorrow.
“Perhaps we should pay him a visit as well then.”
“Yes.”
“But of course your highness.”
“It must be me if he doesn’t even want me.”
“I think he knows a lot more than he’s letting on.”
“Speak.” Harion leans back and glances up at the professor. “And Mr. Black I expect the truth and all of it if I’m spending my free time appeasing you.”
Bellatrix sits down slowly in her normal chair and runs a hand across her forehead before brushing a stray strand of hair away from her face that had fallen from her bun. “Cissa, sit down please.” Narcissa pauses and then sits down across from her while floating a cup of steaming tea toward Bellatrix. “The Longbottoms are still…uncertain. I know that I was not there that night, but I don’t know what I was doing instead? I also don’t know how people would have seen me there if I had been somewhere else? You and I both know my wand did not show traces of the cruciatus curse.”
It was the week before Samhain, or Halloween as muggles called it when Harry experienced his first run-in with the headmaster. Thus far, he’d been able to keep his distance from the batty old man. His mother had warned him, as well as Uncle Lucius and Aunt Narcissa, to give the crazy old man a wide berth. They trusted him about as far as they could throw a giant, which obviously wasn’t very far. The old man, Harry learned, had been the one behind placing him in a home with those awful muggles. He’d sealed Lily and James Potter’s wills and from what Harry could dig up was the reason his godfather was in Azkaban. Not that Harry didn’t agree that the man who sold his parents to the Dark Lord should rot away in Azkaban.
The bushy haired girl with a smattering of freckles dotting her tanned cheekbones nods with a bright little grin. Her curls bounce with the movement and she holds her hand out in a very muggle fashion. She must be a muggle born witch or a half-blood then.
Draco catches Harry’s eyes in the mirror and holds his gaze for a long moment while he thinks. For eleven-year-olds, they were both far more intelligent than most children in their year. Having grown up the way they did they were expected to act mature and not like little hellions. “Perhaps that is because they all know Aunt Bella and Mother are sisters. Technically that would make us first cousin.” Draco turns finally and crosses the room. Harry points out a specific pair of black dragon hide boots that he thought would go well with Draco’s outfit.
Harry very nearly runs to the woman in excitement upon finally seeing her. He had missed his mother dearly and hated being away from her for so long. Her wild inky curls were pulled away from her eyes in a neat half-up hairstyle with the rest cascading down the back of her dark green robes. Her black dress was left partially exposed. Instead of running to her, Harry brusquely walks toward her and offers her a controlled smile.
“I’m going to miss you too my little lord.” His mother pulls away from him and fixes at his collar until it looks neat and presentable. “Now hurry on to the platform alright. Your luggage is already on the train. Find little Dray and the two of you will find a compartment. Be good this year.”
Both women turn their head to the door behind them when it opens and two guards escort a haggard looking man into the room. Long ebony curls hang in unkempt tangles around a gaunt and sunken face. Striking blue eyes, which are decidedly clear or insanity, take them in for a moment longer than expected before turning away and glazing over. Narcissa could almost see right through the insanity act if she could look past her cousin’s appearance. Sirius had always been exceptionally good looking, good with men and women alike. Like this, she could barely see the beauty that had surrounded the young man just ten short years ago. Of course, that was not to say Sirius was not still handsome, just a bit deathly looking.
Lily was kind and caring and everything good in the wretched world of his childhood. Her laughter and her smiles could light hundreds of towns in Severus’ opinion. She was everything wonderful in the world. She often spoke of one day running away together and living in a peaceful little cottage where they could grow all the flowers and foods they could imagine. After their first years at Hogwarts together her dreams had grown into a tiny little cottage on a plot of magical land where Severus could set up a potions lab and she could create new charms in a warded room. Together they could plant vegetables and fruit trees. When Severus had finally worked up the nerve to kiss her under the twinkling lights of the gardens during Yule, her dreams of their future grew to include a tiny family of dark-haired children running about happily and plucking apples from trees as they played.
“Um sorry for interrupting but you wouldn’t have happened to see a toad?” They share an amazed glance at such an incredibly odd statement but then again most muggle born must already feel they are in dream land getting on a magical train to go to a magical school. “You see Neville seemed to have lost his.”
“Then were would Uncle Luc and Aunt Cissa get their fun?”
Her question hangs in the silence between them. Would he take her son from her? No. Harion was just as much her son as he was his son...if not more so. She had seen him grow and raised him in a household full of love and acceptance. Could Severus have done the same? Would he be so cruel as to tear away from his son what little happiness he had experienced in his short painful life? “No. You are his mother. You’ve shown him what it is to be loved and accepted and cherished something I fear I would not have been able to do even had I known...that he was my son.” It was the first time Severus had said it aloud. Harion was his son. Harion. Harry. Harrison. The small black-haired boy who flinched at the loudest noise and hadn’t spoken until he was seven was his son. He was beautiful.
Harry stared at it, “A weird fabric thing?”
Draco stuttered for a moment as if he was debating whether or not he should say something before he responded with, "Of course I am. Now, enjoy the feast, Harry."
Draco nearly choked on his toast, and panic flashed across Harry’s body, ”You okay?”
"Seeker."
"It doesn't matter." Draco shoved past him, "Hurry up."
Draco feigned surprise, "This is the third-floor corridor? I'm so sorry, sir! I had no idea."
"Hey, Harry-" Ron's loud voice snapped Harry out of his wondrous expedition into the history of Quidditch, "Hey, Hermione. Hey... Malfoy."
Harry was much more excited about his next class. Mixing stuff to make something new and magical piqued his interest quite a bit. He had scoured his textbooks in his dorm after Draco had told him about it, discovering a plethora of new and exciting information.
Draco and Harry's eyes met, wide as they both looked at the source of the sound. Mrs Norris. Harry groaned, this meant that Filch was nearby, and they had to go-- but Mrs Norris was in the way.
Harry had a moment of panic. Was there an essay due in Potions? Transfiguration? "How so?"
Harry felt his excitement fumble a bit before it descended into the bottomless pit that was his stomach.
The boy looked surprised that Harry knew his name, and turned a bright red. Harry turned and followed after his friend, worried about how he was acting.
"Because I put myself in danger."
"If you wanna learn about Quidditch, don't learn about the history- learn about the art of it." Ron said elegantly.
"He did! So did Ron and Hermione!"
Harry sighed hesitantly, and his eyes snagged on a small piece of parchment resting upon his sheets. Hedwig was sitting next to it, preening. He smiled when he saw that Azazel had made his way onto Draco’s bed, delivering his much larger stack of mail.
"And Malfoy. I wouldn’t put anything past Snape. But what’s he after? What’s that dog guarding?”
What up it's ya boi. I've had no motivation for literally anything for a while. (Seriously, I stopped eating for a while because I just didn't feel like it)
He glanced at Harry; the boy is still oblivious to the situation. He seemed enthralled by the tainted book, his eyes full of wonder as Draco found himself staring at them.
"The world isn't as nice and dandy as you think. If you show that you're vulnerable they'll exploit that."
He turned, looking at Malfoy, "What is it, Malfoy?"
As the two figures vanished into the castle, most of the Slytherins erupted into laughter.
Harry grinned, "You're just jealous because I met another troll."
Draco smacked the back of his head, "You absolute dunderhead."
"I have a massive library- AND it's less restrictive than the school one- we'll find him in no time," Draco assured him.
Harry grinned, turning the note so that Draco could see it. Draco looked up from his mail, a neatly written letter being set aside as he peered at the note presented to him, “Hagrid?”
"We just want to know more about Nicholas Flamel." The muggleborn said nonchalantly.
"Professor Dumbledore said that we would face a horrible death if we did!" Harry protested, standing up.
Harry nodded, jumping up, "You're right! I'll be back, then yeah?" He quickly ran out of the room.
He fell backward, the soft feathers muffling his hearing as he sunk further and further into the pile. He blinked, standing upright again. He watched as Zabini grasped at his face, bleeding and bruised. The feathers fluttered away as Draco let out a frustrated sigh. He looked down at them, seeing his fist clenched and stained with blood. His eyes fell closed, and when they opened once more, Blaise was pinned across the Slytherin table, and Draco watched as his fist jammed into the boy's jaw like a muggle sewing machine. He was yanked out of the feathers, and he let out a sigh as the feeling of loss overwhelmed him. Draco struggled against the ropes binding him from the rest of the world. He gazed at Pansy, urging her to come and untie him, but she only stared back with fear glistening in her eyes. Everything was slow, flowing through time as smoothly as a polished cauldron. And then it wasn't. Time sped up, and the feathers flew out of Draco's ears. A boy was screaming out, and Draco looked for the source, confused when a hand clasped over his face, and the sound faded out.
"Hey, Ron! 'Arry! ...Malfoy." The half-giant cleared his throat, and Draco found it evident that it was because of him.
Harry let out a small chortle before quickly snapping his mouth shut as he saw Professor Binns turning.
"Did she say anything about me?" Draco asked insistently.
"Honestly, Draco. Could you be any more obvious?" Pansy snarked.
"Because I saw it?"
"Guarding the package Hagrid got, yeah!" Harry interrupted Malfoy.
The next period was lunch, and Harry put aside the feeling of his gnawing heart and focused on his hunger instead. Sharing jokes and being with friends as they laughed at things besides himself. For once, he was the comedian, not the comedy. He grinned as he helped himself to about two portions of food rather than his usual half. His reference was drilled into his memory as he remembered as he used to stare at his cousin's heaping plate. Harry had dubbed Dudley's regular meal size as four portions, edging on 5.
”I'll have you know that I probably know much more about Quidditch than you do.” She sniffed.
Ron laughed- oh yeah, he was there- "Malfoy-"
What about when his eyes, then hazel, clearly echoed sympathy while he was insulting him? Is someone making him act rude? If so, who?
Draco didn't reply, instead leaping up the stairs two steps at a time. Harry followed, nearly getting hit in the face with Draco's robe.
"Take a nap in there, did you, Potter?" Draco shifted himself off of the rough stone walls of the dungeon, walking firmly towards the stairs. Harry had to jog to catch up.
The moment afterward had been disturbing. Snape had looked at him with his cold, dead eyes and Harry gaped in disbelief in what he had just said. The panic quickly vanished when the sound of laughter had flooded his ears. It was quiet, hardly louder than a murmur, but it was there. The best part? Ron was one of those who had laughed.
"Potter!"
Halloween was coming much too soon. The once grey halls of Hogwarts soon danced with orange and black. He filed in the dungeon classroom, heart skipping a beat when he saw a distinct pattern at the tables. One from each house. Harry panicked; Hermione was already partnered with Draco, who had the face that meant he was pretending to be annoyed. The only other Gryffindor he really knew was- Ronald Weasley.
Bellatrix offers Severus a mysterious smile filled with many emotions he found himself unable to name. He’d seen a myriad of emotions cross her face in the many years they had worked side by side before, during, and after the war. These were not among them. It almost looked like resignation. “Yes. My Harion is an intelligent boy, wise beyond his year mates, but he is still just a boy. There is not much that he does that I am not aware of...even now.” Severus notices another mysterious emotion crossing her gaze when she turns her eyes to look at him. It was almost as if she was looking into his soul and assessing him.
“Exactly.”
“Sir, we have heard that a little lioness who was kicked from the den is in the second-floor bathrooms.” Draco raises his eyebrows hoping that his godfather gets the hint that the lioness was being mistreated like them and that was why they wished to help her. “We’ve decided she’s a snake in the lion den.”
Severus is taken aback by the boy’s tone and the anguish in his face. There was desperation there that he himself had felt countless times before. He remembers the surprise he felt when he found out that his mother, a Prince by birth, had an entire family who wanted him in the worst way possible following her demise. He’d left his acholic muggle father in a puddle of his own piss and vomit and never looked back at just the tender age of sixteen. That had been the summer before sixth year and following seventh year he returned to Hogwarts with the power of a wealthy pureblood house behind him.
“That is why I fear I may have made a terrible mistake.” Bellatrix sets her empty cup aside and folds her hands across her lap turning her too aware gaze toward the flickering flames of the fire.  Her curls sway slightly with the movement and Severus wonders just how much longer until they all come tumbling down from where they are piled haphazardly atop her head. Her hair was not the tangled mess it had once been. No. There was an effortless kind of beauty in the chaos of her curls now. She clearly cared for them and kept them clean and managed but she was also not as bothered to keep them in pristine order either. “If Harion believes I do not want him I fear there will be very little that I can do to change his mind.”
“Of course not, Harion.” Bellatrix offers the small boy a tight smile despite how much she wanted to fall to her knees and wrap her darling little boy in her arms. She had been aghast when Lucius had told her that a troll had gotten into the dungeons of the school. She had wanted to storm into the school herself and give the headmaster a piece of her mind but Narcissa had convinced her that their boys would not do anything to put themselves in danger. She was glad that her child looks to be in one piece. “We’ve got much to do today so let us take our leave Harion.”
Harry was a smart child. He excelled in any subject his mother thought fit to teach him. He grasped concepts with ease and had a natural affinity for magic that made his mother grin in pride at every turn. He had always enjoyed learning; the one thing he was denied as a child before living with her. Despite his natural love for reading and learning he was never a child that had ceased to wonder on things. Book were not the entirety of the world as some children like him thought. There were still parts of the magical world that ceased to amazes him at every turn and perhaps that was where he differed from the others.
“Oh my, he’s quite a powerful young man.” The wild haired woman runs a finger through the little boy’s black curls and coos quietly down at him when the boy glances up at her in surprise. It felt to her almost as if the boy was surprised that someone touching him could do so without it hurting. It made something ache in her usually unmoved heart. The imperius had done damage to her emotional control and her sympathies were usually the most vacant. She wanted nothing more than to hide this quietly little boy away and show him the childhood they had growing up; one of love and enjoyment rather than sadness and pain.
“More than I probably should.”
“I’ll have you know, child, that we age very well. My grandfather lived to be the tender age of nearly two hundred. Unfortunately, my siblings met tragic fates and my father died of dragon pox. Merope was murdered by her husband shortly after her son’s death. That muggle man beat her to death, and she loved him too greatly to raise a hand to him in defense. She died the year I was born. Morfin shared the same genetic malformation as his mother and died shortly before his eighteenth birthday. Heaven forbid I age like that blasted old man you have for a headmaster!” Harion giggles softly envisioning the lithe regal man standing before him in atrocious orange robes with a long scraggly white beard and hair. “Do not. Absolutely not. Do not envision me in his robes. Salazar forbid, I even fell into such insanity as to think something so horrendous was fashionable.”
“You are quite an intelligent child, aren’t you?” Marvolo takes a step forward and brushes a hand through a loose lock of black hair that was curling around his eyes. It was an odd feeling. His hands were not quite true flesh and blood, but it also lacked that ghostly quality that ghosts like the Bloody Baron had. “Pray tell, where did you discover such knowledge that took me nearly seven years here to find? It is likely not something an eleven-year-old should have knowledge of.”
“Dying would have been a better life than this.”
“Imagine my surprise when The Dark Lord we knew was actually Lily’s father and likely would not have been able to kill her.” Severus is glad he wasn't about to drink tea or he surely would have spit it out. He knew that Lily was a Gaunt but he hadn’t connected that Marvolo Gaunt, her father, was actually the insane Dark Lord. Albus had often told him that The Dark Lord was the half-blood child born out of a love potion to Merope Gaunt named Tom Riddle. On Harion’s family tree there had been a Tom Riddle who would have been Lily’s cousin and about the same age as her father but Severus had written that off. “Slytherin familial magic is said to be incredibly strict when it comes to using magic against blood family members. Gaunt family magic by extension is also quite strict about aggressive magic against fellow family members. From my understanding, it is a way to protect the legacy of the lineage. The Black family has similar regulations.”
"Well, actually-" Harry protested before he was interrupted by Draco.
He frowned, despite his pounding headache. Why couldn't he reme-
"Seems my family approves of our relationship," Draco hesitated for a moment, "Friendship, of course."
Snape fumed, his nose twitching more. "Correct. Then, what is the difference between Monkshood and Wolfsbane?"
"I dunno," Draco shrugged, "Just thought I'd wing it."
Harry only managed to keep his eyes open in the class because of the anticipation of the adventure that was afterwards. Not wanting to draw attention to himself, he was forced to keep the signs of his anticipation below his desk, resulting in extremely jittery legs.
Harry snatched the book-
"Seriously? You're arguing because of your name. Do you realize how daft that is? Who cares what your last name is? Just shut up and get along."
Harry's classes flew by. In Potions, he managed to make people laugh. He reminisced upon the moment.
"It's not worth risking our lives over, Harry." Draco pushed.
"Apologies, Mrs. Malfoy. It won't happen again."
He hadn't even done anything, yet uncomfortable glances followed him everywhere he went. Whether it was because he was Slytherin, or that the Malfoy name had been tainted- no,
"Focused. Today's important, you know."
Harry saw after him for a few beats before he turned to Neville, "Sorry about that, Neville."
“I found him! Nicholas Flamel!”
"She just wanted to know how I was doing; that's all."
Draco jumped, “Merlin, Harry! What?!”
He split off from the group, thankfully unnoticed. He found himself following Snape, wondering why he was away from the other professors when he noticed that somebody else was with him. He nodded to the redhead, keeping his eyes on the greasy professor. They followed him until their noses urged them not to, drawing their attention to a troll down the hall. They watched as the troll went through a door, racing to it and locking it. They smiled at each other in short-lived triumph, as soon after they heard a scream.
The next class had great promise, but Harry was disappointed. The teacher for the subject that he had anticipated so much was the same man who shivered when he had seen Harry before. Thankfully, he didn't share this class with the Gryffindors. Unluckily, Harry needed to see the board, so he was forced to wear his glasses. His fool-proof disguise was foiled. Nobody seemed to notice, though. In fact, Quirrell was nervous towards Harry before he had even put his glasses on. Maybe he's scared of black hair?
Harry decided,
Harry looked into Draco's eyes as they came to the conclusion together- "The third floor."
find out who he is." The muggleborn insisted.
Draco smirked, “No, idiot. I’m going to put them on with my sweatless hands.”
Harry smiled at the others murmuring as they stirred. Typically, this would be a terrible sound to him, but this time, he didn’t have to make breakfast enough for twenty, he would get to eat breakfast with people who told jokes that weren’t about his dead parents. He stood, knowing how the alarm was. It would only turn off once everybody was off of their bed, and while the other boys mostly despised this, Harry generally marveled at it.
"I was caught in the restricted section," Harry admitted quietly.
"Draco, wouldn't it make more sense if I simply didn't grab my glasses by the glass part?" Harry mused, internally scolding himself for not having considered this before.
"I didn't think it was important," Harry shrugged it off, still not seeing the importance.
"What is it?!" He snarled, before turning pale, a sickly green hue washing over his face, "He's not behind me, is he?"
Sorry
"Here it is." Draco opened the door to a clean bedroom, "This is where you'll be staying."
The boys turned in unison just in time to feel the hot breath of a three-headed dog on their faces. Draco's hand scrambled for the doorknob, gripping it and throwing the door open before grabbing Harry and getting out of there. Luckily, Filch had decided to search elsewhere for them, and the boys ran back to the dungeons.
As he walked down the green-lit hallway of the dungeons, he saw a flash of red. No- it was more than a second; it was a wave. A group of first-year Gryffindors walked towards the potions classroom, and Harry bit his lip nervously.
"Yes, Malfoy?"
Coming into the classroom, Harry was quite ecstatic to learn about the wizarding world's history, perhaps even more excited when he discovered that the teacher was a ghost.
Draco paused, biting his lip, "That's your name, isn't it?"
Harry stared at Draco’s floating head, “Holy shit.”
Harry turned to Draco, a smile on his face. He watched as Draco folded his letter and pocketed it before smiling back.
This story is dedicated to Katy Garbus, and all preceding pieces written by me are as well.
"It's obvious," He rolled his eyes as they entered the courtyard.
"What do you mean?" Draco asked from the opposite corner of the carriage.
happens to be a friend of mine and as far as I know, I'm the one in authority here. Detention."
The first years rested at the foot of the stairs and waited for Professor McGonagall to cry out their names.
Draco froze, the cloak grasped in his icy fingers curling into the curves of his fingers. He shifted, eyebrows raised at Harry, "Because your fingers are obnoxiously too big to be able to do that without touching the glass."
boy."
"'Ello there, Harry!" Hagrid grinned as Harry ran into his arms. Harry didn't see his eyes narrow slightly at the Malfoy boy.
Apologies for the lack of chapter today. I tried to write it, but I couldn't find the inspiration. Why, you may ask? Because, this weekend, my inspiration made the decision to end her own life. Katy Garbus, my 7th grade English teacher and biggest fan. I wouldn't be writing this today if it weren't for her. This, of course, had a very big impact on me. I write this in hopes that someday, wherever she is, she can read this story. She was always supportive of every writing piece I produced, even the cringy emo poems I wrote when I was 12. She saved my writing to her desktop, she loved it so much. She was always so optimistic and bubbly and I never saw this coming. So again, apologies for no chapter today, but I hope you can understand.
"I'm Malfoy, Draco Malfoy," The boy answered, his eyes seeming to twinkle with hope at Harry's acknowledgment.
Draco scoffed, ”Of course I did, now face forward." He shoved Harry back around to face where they were going.
Draco's arm twitched as if to make a move to comfort the boy, "Maybe. I can't say. If he didn't, he wouldn't be a true friend; if you were a Gryffindor, I would still be your friend."
"Where does it say that? My father is on the school board and as far as I know, that's never been a rule."
"Bones, Susan,"
He scowled but sat back down.
"About how much you frickin' love the wondrous Harry Potter."
"Clearly you haven't looked in a mirror."
"...it's a rather large tree," He finished.
"Exactly," Draco's eyes twinkled, "That's why we're going."
- when his father had become a death eater, he wasn't sure. He wasn't sure of much these days. Blimey, he wasn't even sure if he wanted to be sure. Not knowing was frustrating, of course, but sometimes the truth is worse than ignorance.
The first years get their first flying lessons. Draco's acting cold, and when Harry takes a late-night walk he goes to comfort him, leading to a terrifying discovery!
Draco opened his mouth to respond, but before he could, a loud, nasally voice filled the room. "Welcome, students, to your first potions class. We will begin with attendance to ensure that every one of you is here, at least physically."
"Doyouwanttospendchristmaswithme," Draco blurted out, avoiding Harry's gaze.
"I can't wait to learn more about it, I- oh, Hermione!" Draco whipped around to find the muggleborn that Harry was referencing, "Did you get the book?"
- out of her hands, oblivious to the tension between Draco and the muggleborn.
Harry starts off on the right foot with Professor Snape... kind of. For once, Harry enjoys school and even has a decent lunch! And then it hurt.
"And the dog is guarding it? In the school?"
Harry's eyelashes fluttered excitedly as they entered the Great Hall. Draco looked around as well, but it seemed rather plain to him. It was brighter than he was used to, sure- and most definitely happier, but not as extravagant as the decor he had at home. If Harry was this excited about these decorations, Draco couldn't wait until Harry saw the ones at home- maybe they could decorate the tree together. He had never done that before- the tree was always expertly placed and decorated, having a sort of unnatural look to it. It looked amazing, of course, but not... homely.
Draco shook his head, "It's in the third-floor corridor, isn't it?"
Harry's broom leaped straight into his clutch. He glanced at those around him, grinning when Draco's broom had made its way into the boy's icy hands on his second try. Ron's broom, however, didn't seem to want to interact with the ginger.
"Why would I be?"
Harry frowned, confused, "Yeah...?"
"There's-" He began.
Harry nodded stiffly and froze when Mrs. Malfoy gestured for him to sit next to her.
Draco flinched as her hair stung his face, ”I wasn't talking to you.”
"He-"
"Did you see his face, the great lump?" Draco cackled.
"No reason. Follow me." Draco's hand stretched toward Harry's for a moment before quickly retracting.
"SLYTHERIN!"
Whispers and murmurs bounced off the walls of the classroom, bringing more and more attention to Harry. He cast his gaze downwards, grabbing some parchment, a quill, and a bottle of ink out of his bag. He would focus on his studies. He couldn't get in trouble if he wasn't doing anything. He didn't want to lose house points by existing, but the way things were going, that might happen.
"Yes, you did. But I don't want my hair to be gelled; I want it to be... not a mass of unruly spikes sitting on the top of my head."
He found Draco in the bathroom where they had experimented with makeup before.
Harry shook his head, his hair settling neatly along the contours of his upper face, "Not yet, no."
Draco scoffed, "Idiot."
"Where do you think?" Draco scoffed, "We're going to Hagrid's."
Harry shifted under his covers, his thoughts prickling on his back. Why was Malfoy so rude today? Did something happen? Was it the letter? No, he was cold before that.
Filch scoffed, "Hogwash!"
Neither reached out their hand, Hermione giving a curt nod before mumbling a greeting, and Draco returning only a slight smile before they both turned their attention back towards Harry.
How curious.
Draco sighed, physically bothered. His hands were shaking, and Harry didn't think it was from the cold. The color returned to his face, "Do you... with...?"
Draco nudged him, "What are you laughing about?"
“Dads are good people.”
He cleared his throat, "Harry's staying at the manor for the holidays, Father."
Those words seemed to put all thoughts in Draco's head on hold, "That- I mean, why should I care if you get in trouble?"
"Oh, look! We're almost to King's Cross!" Draco gestured out the window towards a large group of wizard parents waiting on the platform.
Draco is gay and invites Harry over for Christmas.
Their classes went by in a flash, most likely because they slept through them. Lunch was okay, at least Ron wasn't glaring at him anymore. Harry was excited for their afternoon and scarfed down his meal. Not that it helped- he would still have to wait four hours.
(See the end of the chapter for
he thought excitedly.
Harry let his lips curl into a slight grin at the last part of the teacher's statement.
"Draco!" His father stretched his arms towards him threa- lovingly. Threateningly? Lovingly? What, exactly, was the difference?
REVISED
"Hello, Hagrid." He said, face as neutral as a statue.
Ron smothered a snicker, and Draco whirled to scowl at him, "Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair and hand-me-down robes, you must be a Weasley," He scoffed.
Draco pulled his hand out of Harry's and grabbed his wand. He tapped the doorknob and muttered something before opening it and pulling Harry into the room with him. They panted, anxiety pulsing through their veins. To their relief, Peeves had decided that he had been too helpful tonight and refused to tell Filch where they went.
The half-giant turned red, "How do ye know about that?"
"Yes, I did." Draco watched as the muggleborn's eyes flickered to him.
Draco grinned.
Harry nodded, "Yes, ma'am."
"Wow! I've never seen a tree
Appalled gasps and murmurs ran through the hall. No one had foreseen that The Boy Who Lived would be a Slytherin. Harry glanced at Ron as Professor McGonagall took the hat off of his head. Ron gaped at Harry with disbelief, then glared at him. Harry blundered down the stairs toward the Slytherin table, which was packed with confusion and feeble cheers. Draco waved him over and made room for him, his face full of delight.
"Harry said that it was vault 713. The same vault mentioned in the paper. What was in the vault?" Harry glared at Draco.
"I see. Did you clean it up?"
"Uh, kinda? I got scraps sometimes," Harry shrugged.
Harry stared up at the source. He seemed familiar; Harry knew that he had seen him before.
The boys walked in silence, ascending several more flights of stairs before they froze, eyes widening. They followed the sound of clacking to Mrs. Norris padding towards them.
"The brooms aren't going to fly away without us, Potter," Draco muttered cooly.
"I didn't know I was going to invite you!" Draco yelped defensively.
Harry raised his eyebrows, "Huh?"
“Potter? What the hell-”
Ron frowned, but took it and nodded.
“But he’s your dad!”
Harry looked at him, ”That's what we’re doing right now, isn't it?”
"Your personal copy?" Snape raised an eyebrow.
He clambered towards a broom, settling himself in between Draco and Ron. The broom was worn, with twigs sticking out from strange angles. He grimaced, imagining what it might feel like flying on it.
“I know what was in the vault. I know what the dog is guarding.”
"So, whatever it was, it was obviously valuable, right?" Draco sat on the edge of his bed, his legs shifting as he processed the news.
Draco's arm tingled, and he noticed that the periodical brushes of Harry's arm against his had stopped, as Harry seemed to be lost in thought.
Too late.
"I was too focused on the three-headed dog!"
Harry seemed to like the Quidditch match that day, much to Draco's delight. He couldn't exactly remember what the score was and who won- he was too busy thinking.
"Uh..."
"Sorry! I've just never been excited about sports before." Harry glanced back at Draco, his emerald eyes full of wonder, causing Draco's lips to twitch into a smile.
"I didn't want to do that, you know."
Harry spent the rest of the feast trying to enjoy as much of it as possible; he clapped when Ron was sorted into Gryffindor, even when it earned him weird stares, he chuckled when Professor Flitwick dropped his fork, and he chatted with his fellow Slytherins.
Harry smiled, ”Then I guess we can be faggots together.”
"Not sure, but it was on a trapdoor," Draco muttered
Harry took the limp package, unwrapping it as a piece of parchment fell out. Harry set the package down to read it.
Harry grumbled, and a nasally voice spoke up, "Before what?"
Ron rolled his eyes, “Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something. I’m with Harry-"
Draco carefully pushed the door to his bedroom open, wincing a bit. Maybe if Harry- but he wasn’t in there. He felt somebody push past him and gasped as Harry suddenly appeared after being shrouded in the invisibility cloak.
"Fine, then. Let's just mind our own business like we always do, then?"
haha i hope you liked also im in quarantine lol idk if i have covid yet tho.
A hush of wonder rippled through the crowd as they took in the view.
"Make room everyone, our new celebrity has entered," Snape had said.
"Don't forget to go to the library. We only have one day before Christmas." The muggleborn said.
Draco frowned, "How should I know?"
Draco started to get up to continue his argument with the man, and Harry went to stop him before he stopped himself, "Did you see that?"
Draco snatched up the package, “Do you know what this is?”
"Who?"
When the professor began to dismiss the class, Harry jolted out of his seat along with many others, frowning at the sudden feeling of coolness on his right leg.
Draco let out a huff of amusement before gazing at Harry’s cheek. He reached out to touch the bruise that he had caused yesterday, and Harry’s hand reached up to grasp at Draco’s as he winced at the pain. Although it hurt at first, Harry couldn't help but feel a sense of comfort as Draco’s hand touched his cheek.
"Oh, shut it," Harry shoved Draco playfully, "I just want the book back."
"Professor Snape, sir, shouldn't Slytherin get house points from Harry knowing the answers?" He asked.
"Stick out your right hand over your broom and say 'Up!'" Madame Hooch directed.
Idiot. Why would he say that? That was uncalled for. Now Harry hated him. He should. Why didn’t he before? How could he be so stupid? It’s rule number one:
Draco frowned, the last sentence floating through his head without a single moment spent pondering upon it, “A withdrawal? When was this?”
Snape stiffened, "Yes, of course. Fifteen points to Slytherin for Draco pointing that out, and 10 points to Slytherin for Potter knowing simple trivia."
Snape came by and scoffed, "You are the stupidest person I've ever met, Potter."
"Mum." Draco's voice cut through suddenly.
Harry's eyes quickly darted away as Ron turned to meet his gaze. He spotted Draco several paces in front of him and jogged to catch up. Harry slowed as he reached him, stepping inside the dank dungeon classroom. He shuffled quietly to the seat next to Draco, not wanting to attract any attention to himself.
Harry frowned, confused, “So I’m just gonna… not see?”
He pushed himself to his feet, the ball steady in his grasp. He walked back towards the group, side-eying Malfoy before going right up to Ron and presenting the ball to him.
"The third floor," Draco said suddenly, startling Harry out of his thoughts.
Harry relaxed as he saw the professor, dropping Draco's hand.
He was interrupted by approaching footsteps.
Draco snorted, "You know they won't do that. The Chosen One needs wizardly training; you aren't the Boy Who Lived with muggles for the rest of your life." He shifted in his seat, "Besides, if they did, I'll tell my father."
Snape frowned, his nose twitching. "Very well. Where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?"
"You'll make sure it gets back to him?"
Ron laughed. Snape took away 10 points, but it was worth it. Harry watched as Draco beelined out of the classroom the moment it ended, turning when he was nudged on the shoulder.
Draco sighed, picking the rest of his stuff swiftly as he leads the black-haired boy outside of the classroom, "Do you want everyone to know?"
Harry took it, wondering if cold hands ran in the Malfoy family. She quickly exited the room, and Draco immediately harped on Harry with questions.
This is where he belonged.
He felt a smile creep up on his lips, influenced by the excitement of Harry. Draco was sure that was why- there was no way
Ron and Harry ended up heading the same way to the Charms classroom, and Ron took the opportunity to slide in some of his own snarky encounters that he had had with others in the past.
“I’m glad I made you open it now.” Draco murmured.
The first few days of classes were the most eventful that Harry had ever experienced. Given, he's only experienced those classes so far, but that's beside the point. Harry's clothes had been enchanted to match his house's colors, and he had concluded that green looked much more fitting on him than red ever could. Draco had agreed with him on that, continuing to say that the color accentuated his emerald eyes.
They turned to lock eyes with Professor McGonagall, Snape and Quirrell close behind her.
He obeyed, sitting next to the woman. It felt weird, having an adult care about him in this way.
Harry stumbled over his words, "Well, no. Hermione got it from the library-"
Harry thought,
Thank you all so much for the kind words and support! Without them I would've never had the motivation to pump out another chapter today
There were partners for Charms class, but this time they were assigned. Harry was partnered with a blonde Slytherin girl with a rather large nose, and Ron was with Hermione Granger. He glanced around for Draco, finding him next to Neville Longbottom, both looking extremely uncomfortable.
If I haven't updated in like, a week, please scream at me because this is such a good prompt and I'm gonna be so mad at myself if I don't finish it.
be there. He tried to close the door and scurry away, but before he could-
Harry blinked at Draco, “Why?”
"Come, sit."
"Wake up, doofus." He kidded.
Harry frowned. Draco didn't usually refer to him as his last name unless he was angry. Could Draco be mad at him? Why would he be? Only this morning he had put Harry's glasses on for him.
Checking in to see if anybody still has interest in this series. Also- any ideas? I know I had a lot planned when I stopped but then I, well, stopped. Now I kinda forgot everything but I’m sure it’ll come back to me.
Draco's cheeks flushed red, the heat radiating slightly onto Harry's skin. A whisper crawled from his throat, "You are...?"
“Just do it.”
“How big was the package, Harry?” Draco asked.
“Well, I don’t know his middle name. It could very well not be Billius,” Draco stammered.
"Yeah! See, if you based your knowledge solely on the writings about Quidditch, you'll be biased towards thinking that the chaser is the best position, when really it's the-"
Harry's focus was seized away from the ground as Neville Longbottom abruptly spurted into the air like a soda charged with mentos. Gasps reverberated around him as the boy shifted from the broom and fell to the earth.
Draco inhaled shakily, tearing open the packaging to reveal an ugly green wool sweater with a white ‘D’ knitted into the front of it.
Harry grabbed Draco's hand as he turned to run away from where Filch was heading from. Harry jumped when Peeves, the troublemaking poltergeist, decided to scream to let Filch know where they were. Harry cursed under his breath, jiggling the doorknob of a door. They were stuck in a dead end.
"Well, it isn't, so-"
”Y-yeah, it's an insult.”
This took me forever! 2.8k words and many hours of suffering. Check me out on tumblr!
Draco watched as Harry's warm, calloused hand met with his father's cold and stony one, "Anyways, Draco?" Harry prompted him.
Next chapter will be a Hagrid Visit.
"Huh?" Harry looked at Draco, "Oh, yeah. I was just thinking."
"A library book outside of the building?" Snape pocketed it, "Not allowed."
This is kind of a fluffy filler chapter, but it does have a plot. Harry wasn't originally going to have a scar episode, but I'm sick as fuck and my head started pounding as I wrote that part. BUT! On the bright side we get Draco trying to keep Harry in the hospital wing next chapter.
Harry frowned, "What if I had lost us house points?"
Madame Hooch next taught them how to mount their brooms, and Harry attempted to reassure Draco after he was told that he was doing it wrong, only earning himself a scowl. What did he do wrong?
Severus nods encouraging the boy forward. There were many a plethora of things that could have been spoken about not all of them good or all of them bad. He was just as confused now as he was before.
“You look like her.” Marvolo chuckles and runs a hand through his hair. Harry used to have a very similar habit until her mother trained it out of him. “We were very similar. She had the same kind of drive that I did. She encouraged me often to take my studies seriously and if they didn’t challenge me enough to finish them first and then move on to things that I found challenging. She wrote quite often and when I first told her of Elspeth, she was overjoyed. Looking back, I’d like to think she liked her enough when they met. Surely they met before my mother met her death.”
“Even Andromeda refuses to speak to us on principle.” Bellatrix sighs softly thinking about the sister who was born between her and Narcissa. She had always adored Andromeda. Despite not being the youngest their parents often babied Andromeda. Narcissa had always been quite well mannered and independent. She met Lucius at a young age and demanded her bonding contract from birth be absolved in favor of a true bonding contract with Lucius Malfoy because she believed in her entire being that Lucius was her soulmate and he well and truly may be. Bellatrix had never had as much vigor as Narcissa. Narcissa was quite like their cousin. “Narcissa! Sirius!”
“No, not quite, little one.”
Waking up as so had eased the feeling of homesickness the little eleven-year-old boy felt upon waking up that morning. Breakfast had not yet fully reached its peak when they finally found their way to the great hall. Harry had been excited to have been able to write a letter for sending before they were sent off to beds for the night. He knew his mother would be happy to hear from him so soon. His leaving certainly would be detrimental to him mothers mental state for a few weeks but he knew she was strong enough and their bond formed enough that they would be able to survive.
“Isn’t he supposed to be our defense teacher?” Marcus Flint murmurs exasperatedly.
Draco had not ever been one to be bested and would read the book as soon as Harry had finished it which landed the two of them sitting rather high at the top of their year by the time Samhain was approaching. Despite this Harry had grown unusually unnerved by the defense against the dark arts professor. Quirrel was an odd sort of man who appeared perpetually frightened or simply insane at the best of times. His head was constantly wrapped in a misshapen turban and Harry had caught him on more than one occasion talking to himself in a plethora of voices. He had complained several times to his mother who appeared thoughtful and oddly wary of Harry’s description. She had passed on the advice to merely steer clear of the man for the time being.
The room was quaint. There was a desk against the far wall with two large burgundy colored leather chairs sitting in front of it. A set of parchments are stacked off to one side. There are bookshelves covering most of the other walls of the room with a variety of objects, books, and parchment. There were some objects like a mortar and pistil off to one side of the desk and a ritual blade beside it. The room smelled like parchments and something older, magical. Harry felt comfortable here. They take seats in the large leather chair as the goblin takes his seat behind the desk. It’s quite for a long moment and the Goblin gathers his things.
“My mother is perfectly alright sir.” Harry knows that the old man can hear the contempt in his voice. His mother was a touchy subject. “If you don’t mind my asking sir, why am I here? If I’m not in trouble and you merely called me up here to talk about my heritage then I’d like to leave. I shouldn’t even be in this room without a parent or my head of house present. Be that as it may, I am going to be late for potions and as uncomfortable as it may be with all those bloody Gryffindor students, I would not like to show up late to my favorite class.”
“I do not smell dishonesty in your words.” Remus sits stiffly in the chair offered to him. His gold eyes never turn away from Bellatrix. “How did you come into contact with James and why did he task you with caring for our cub?”
“We’ll do it.” Bellatrix murmurs. Narcissa snaps her head toward Bellatrix possibly ready to hex the woman, but Bellatrix begins to speak again before she can. “On the stipulation that you answer one question for me.”
“Of course not, sir.” Blaise offers their head of house a wry grin and darts a glance toward Harry and Draco who seemed to be stuck in a conversation using just their eyes. “We were merely discussing pureblood betrothal customs with Mr. Weasley as it is a very useful thing to know as we age. Mother was just owling me about it the other day.”
“Will you?”
Severus glances down at the roll of parchment that he had never gotten the chance to hand back to the tiny dark-haired boy. He has unrolled it many times since it had come into his possession. Again and again, he traced the many lines of the little boy’s family until he found his name connected undeniably with the tiny boy’s as well as his beautiful Lily. Each class he’s taken a moment to try and find another feature on the boy that was shared between the two of them. It was in the slight tilt of his wide green eyes and the subtle curve of his lips. He had the slight point to his left ear that almost every member of the Prince family inherited. There was also the little twitches of his nose that he did without thought that Severus had done as a child as well. Despite being so young, the boy certainly held a similar jaw shape to Severus. His nose and brows were entirely Lily and the curls could also be attributed to Lily as well. Somehow their genetics had mixed well enough that the boy could also seemingly pass for a member of the Black family without anyone knowing.
“Yes, sir.” Harion frowns and glances back down at his textbook. “I overheard mother speaking with Aunt and Uncle during Samhain. They spoke about something I wasn’t sure mother wanted me to hear yet or ever if I’m to be entirely truthful.”
“Severus. It's Severus.” Draco growls low in his throat and moves to sit up and go and give his godfather a piece of his mind. He may only be eleven, but he’d be damned if anyone makes Harry feel like such crap. Harion’s hand holding onto his arm stops him. “Please don’t. Please just stay here…with me.”
“Sure, preservation. It isn’t merely because you know Snape doesn’t favor you?” Pansy glances down at her nails and bites back a grin when she catches Harry glaring at her. “Of course not. You’re Mother merely taught you that you trust no one but your future bonded.”
“Of course.” Bellatrix and Narcissa move to stand but before they can turn away from the man, Sirius reach out and grips Bellatrix’s wrist. She and Narcissa both turn to the man who is looking at them desperately. “Just one thing, before you go. How is Harry?”
Harion stares out the window at the murky waters of the Black lake. Funny how a lake that shared his name had the same lonely nature that he did. He’d successfully avoided Severus Snape with all of his might and couldn’t find it in himself to be to upset that he was distancing himself from everyone in the process. Harion hated making Draco choose between his beloved godfather and Harion so he tried to make it easier for the blonde. He was disappointed that Draco had yet to seem to forgive Severus, but he figured with time the other boy would.
“I suppose so, but, you and I both know that things are not always what they appear to be.” Draco twines their fingers together and begins pulling Harry toward the door. “Don’t believe anything that foul red-headed Weasel has to say to you.”
“I cannot allow my future bonded to be unhappy.”
“Hello, I’m here for a meeting with the House Black account manager.”
His tongue felt dry when he finally stood before a certain tap. He wondered if his birth mother ever felt this way. If she too ever stood before this very mirror and felt the same dark welcoming draw. Would she have understood it? Would she have followed it? Severus surely wouldn’t have. His Slytherin self-preservation would have won out. His birth mother was Gryffindor would her courage have won out. Perhaps she had found this place in her youth as well and traversed its depths. It would have been less noticeable if a girl had entered the lavatory and disappeared for a while. A ghost did haunt this very room and it was possible for any girl to make friends. His birth mother was said to have been very friendly in her youth.
“I believe we have spoken of everything we desired, Severus. We will learn little else tonight.” Severus nods and finishes his tea. The room was still warm and he felt more tired than he thought. There was less of a weight on his shoulders. It had been many years since he truly felt that things were looking up for him. Perhaps, together with Lucius and Narcissa, the two of them could protect the last part of Lily left living. “It’s late. You are welcome to the guest room. Floo travel may be too dangerous this late. You may do as you wish but the offer stands.”
Harry was a child of extraordinary patience and a temper that was not easily set off. That was especially so if the comments were directly about him. The one and seemingly only thing that made the boy’s magic flare to life in rage was anyone speaking ill about his mother. That woman was certifiably insane, yes that was true, but she was a doting mother who was incredibly loving to him. She taught him how to survive in the horrible world they lived in and gave him weapons to use in his defense.
Narcissa had her nose wrinkled in disgust and a fan covers her face from the smell. It smelled distinctly like a mixture of mold, stagnant water, vomit, and human excrement here. The guard who was acting as their guide for the day seemed almost detached as well. Bellatrix supposed you would have to be to work here day after day especially around the presence of Dementors.
Taking a deep breath Severus whirls toward the floo and tosses in powder stepping through before he can second guess himself. The room lights in green but dies down quickly once he steps in and after a few moments Bellatrix steps into the floo room. Her long black hair hangs in loose tangles down her face and she’s only wearing the normal dress that she wears under her robes. Like this, Severus often thinks she looks much younger than she normally does. He and Bellatrix had never spent much time together. During the war, he found her a tad too insane and mentally unstable. After the war, he had pushed everyone and everything away until the night they had found Harry. He’d been torn when Lucius had called him to come through the floo and petrified they would somehow hurt the little boy. As much as he hated James Potter for stealing his Lily away he would never want to see the only part of Lily left in the world come to harm. When he’d arrived and seen the positively minuscule child wrapped up protectively in Bellatrix’s arms he’d been stunned speechless.
“My son had been having some issues at school and I’d like him to be tested for dark curses.” The goblin looks surprised for a long moment before looking away from Bellatrix and down to the parchment in his hand. Harry knew not to question what was happening now. “I would also like an inheritance test done now. However, due to uncomfortable circumstance, I would request that it is not filed with the ministry.”
“Of course.” Sirius signs the document with a flourish and his signature is as beautiful as ever. Ten years in Azkaban had not taken a lifetime of lessons out of him. “Ask away cousin. If I know the answer, I’ll tell it to you as straight as I can.”
Draco sneers and hisses something under his breath but Harry reigns him in with a silent shake of his head. They would get revenge for the Weasley boy's prejudice but not here. They would do it in a way that they would not be caught. They were smarter than to stoop to the level of a dunder-headed Gryffindor boy.
“Horcruxes.  He said he had been ‘pushed’ into making them by Albus in his youth and then continued to do so as his mind deteriorated from splitting his soul. He believes he had made six before the splinter that was in Harion was created and is hoping to regain two of them by being in the school.” Severus narrows his eyes. Why then was the man seemingly going after the Philosopher’s stone? It didn’t add up. “He wants Albus to believe that he’s playing into his hands rather than trying to regain his mortality.”
“Narcissa, our contract was a finalized one. It was not one of the ones that are made for children.” Narcissa’s eyes widen. There were several different types of bonding contracts. There were contracts made for young children that did not have any strict regulations. Children were merely told they would be bonding someone when they grew older but that was not to say they could not date someone else. They often did not date others but there were not magical consequences for doing so. There were also true soul bonding contracts that created magical guidelines leading up to a proper bonding. Both participants swore fidelity to one another on their magic lest they lose their magic entirely. The contract could be absolved if both parties sought it for differences in opinions. “Narcissa, I have no memory or memory gap in place that indicates our bonding contract was ever absolved. It broke on October 31th 1981. The mind healers believe that was what broke the control the imperius had over my mind.”

“I’m sure you would have raised him just fine had you known he was yours.” Bellatrix offers Severus yet another mysterious smile and he feels he can finally place one of the emotions in her gaze. She was relieved. Despite how well she had played at being confident she wouldn’t lose her child she had still feared the loss all the same. “That’s not why you came here though.”
Harion reaches out to press a finger into the scales of the massive beast with ease. She dips her head down to nuzzle against the top of his head. Had he perhaps been any other boy he would have been terrified to be wrapped up in the confines of the massive beast labeled as classified XXXXX.
“Thank you.”
“Who doesn’t want you?” Draco says fiercely. His chest ached at the thought of another person capturing the heart of his beloved. He may be only eleven, but he’s loved Harion Black, since the day he was five and he met the other, absolutely tiny for their age, five-year-old. He remembers being so entranced with the way his wide green eyes practically glowed with wonder at ever small act of magic and kindness. “If not…then they don’t matter. I’ll want you for however long you’ll have me at your side. Everyone else who doesn’t can choke on a chocolate frog, Harion. What did we always say?”
“They said she’s in the second floor ladies room.” Daphne Greengrass sniffs from her spot next to Pansy. “Myrtle said she’s been crying in there since the third block.”
“Come on Dray we need to get dressed.”
“Yes, you are one of very few remaining.” Blaise whispers. Harry wondered if he often forgot that he and Harry were in a similar position. Blaise was the last male Zabini and he and his mother were the only two left in existence after his uncle murdered his father in a jealous rage and then was given the kiss.  “It is a heavy weight to hold on your shoulder when you are the last of your line.”
“I’m going to miss you mum.”
Severus was not sure exactly what he was thanking the woman for but it felt like a necessity for him to do so. He had never had such a pleasant conversation with her before. Surprisingly, she was a phenomenal conversationalist. He did not doubt that it was the pureblood upbringing. The Black Family were known to be inviting hosts and part of that must be knowing how to converse. It certainly would make sense. Narcissa was the same way. Her presence alone put you at ease. It must have been something taught to them. That night Severus finds himself staring up at the ceiling of the guest bedroom wondering just how Bellatrix Black had looked through him with such ease. Few had been able to see into his innermost workings. It left him feeling vulnerable but also intrigued. Just who was Bellatrix Black? What kind of person had she been before her mind had been shattered? Severus wondered just how formidable she must have been.
“You said confidential, correct?” Severus nods and watches as her eyes flicker briefly toward the lit fire before a small smile curves upon her lips. “I had wondered what he was going to be doing with that copy he made.”
“Well, everyone outside of our friends thinks it’s weird.”
Narcissa smiles serenely at Sirius waiting for the guards to move toward the door at their backs before answering the man. He waits patiently for her to answer him. “He disappeared when he was five from his muggle relatives house.” Narcissa winks discreetly at Sirius who seems to catch on rather quickly. He nods sharply as the guards open the doors to the room. He releases Bellatrix’s wrist and offers them both an obviously, at least to them, fake smile with watery eyes.
“So, it was you.” Remus sips at the cup of tea Narcissa had levitated toward him. “Sirius and I had thought as much. We had thought perhaps Andy but that was quickly tossed to the wayside considering their age difference and then we thought maybe Narcissa but that was also clearly not probable.”
Harry let out a low whistle. “Color me impressed. Not many your size can take me down so easily.”
And the next was a Daffodil one.
The Vikings weren’t happy to see Harry dragging him back out to pillage, but they came along anyways. Something about the manic and desperate look in his eyes must have clued them in not to try Harry’s patience right now. They said quick farewells to their lovers and children, then headed for the ship.
It was absolutely horrible how Harry wanted a celebration to occur on the night of his parents' death. How he didn't want to mourn them and the life he should have had. Still, Draco knew once Harry set his mind to something, no one and nothing could convince him to do otherwise. Besides, if Harry really wanted it to happen that day and felt he would feel happy doing it, Draco would rather die than stop him from doing so.
They sat in silence again, Potter flipping the pages of the sketchbook ever so slowly while Draco thought Potter's words through. When Potter was finally satisfied with it, he shut the book and examined the leather jacket, which Draco had handed to him along with the sketchbook earlier. He muttered to himself about how similar it was to Sirius' leather jacket as he did so, a melancholy look taking over his entire presence.
"I know, but I tend to overthink."
"Potter-Black," Draco choked out, still not quite believing it. "Oh Merlin. How did that ever happen? Who let it happen? Who thought it was a good idea? Oh Merlin. Uncle Regulus— Potter— ugh."
This is why reading the tags are important in fanfics...
"Well, once or twice, but I usually tossed those thoughts out pretty quickly. After all, why would you want me? You're—"
"I didn't!" Harry growled.
Hope you all enjoy <3
"Oh Merlin. Merlin, no," Draco whispered.
"I have no idea. She didn't disclose any additional information to me," Draco sighed.
Inducing fear into people who could easily disarm him was perhaps the only advantage of having the Dark Mark on his left arm.
And Draco was pleasantly surprised to note that Potter was effortlessly carrying his entire weight along with his own. Not that he was any heavier than a hundred and twenty pounds now, but it was still impressive.
"However," Draco continued hesitantly, "this did not continue into the last generation."
"Don't be a fool. I know that she's started S.P.E.W." Actually, no he didn't. But, the details never really mattered when it came to their bushy-haired friend. She'll mention it to him at some point. "However, house-elves live to serve. They borrow magic from their owners and, if you were not introduced to Whispy, he surely would have died from lack of magic."
(The name was odd, yes, but the fact that the dragon responded to the name was even odder. Still, the name strangely fitted the beast so Draco did nothing about it.)
"What about last year? When you begged me to hoist you up on that tree just so you could 'look down at Potter and not just because he's short'? Was that one time as well?" Blaise mocked.
"When we came back to the office, there was an assload of paperwork on our desks."
But then, when he saw the first letter, addressed correctly to his cupboard and only his cupboard, Harry contemplated even leaving at all.
"What else do you want to know about me?"
A moment of inspiration struck him when Draco accidentally stumbled upon this odd looking stick. It looked like a 'Y' and it had this weird looking string attached to it. And then Draco remembered what his mother always advised him to do: 'find a rock and throw it.'
"Why are you still here?"
“Should’ve groveled,” Harry said as he kneeled beside him.
In some other world, someone was both cursing him and laughing at him for being so stupid and ignorant.
“Shut it, Nott.
(See the end of the chapter for
He found himself sitting quietly in his seat in the potion’s classroom wondering briefly why had had even spoken to the dour man before class started. What had brought him to think it was a good idea to speak up to share his rolling thoughts that still made very little sense to him. Was it what he heard playing with his emotions? Was it seeing his mother slip inside the school late last evening and following her into the office of their defense against the dark arts professor? Was it all of the above or nothing at all? Harion couldn’t be sure.
“James Potter is very much dead, sir.” Harion proceeds to pull the piece of parchment out of his textbook and then put his textbook back into his bag. “Though we share blood through adoptive measures…it would appear he is not the wizard who sired me.” There is silence for a long moment as the boy thinks over his next words carefully and decides brevity is likely the best solution. “You are, sir.”
The snake lets out a sound close to a chuckle and bobs her head down to press against his cheek as if to caress it. He reaches out and runs a hand along her scales nearest her deadly eyes.
Molly Weasley looks unhappy to have not found much to use on Harry’s mother, he knew the Weasley woman hated his mother for unknown reasons. “Have a very nice day Mrs. Weasley and Ms. Weasley. It was a pleasure meeting you.” Harry hurries up the steps of the bank following obediently after his mother. He had always like the bank. The goblins were fairly ugly looking, but they were rather interesting. They ran a good business and Harry had the sneaking suspicion that they could cripple the entirety of the Wizarding world with little effort. He was always told to be polite but poised when it came to doing business with the Goblins.
His mother kneels down and cups his rounded cheeks lovingly. He’d seen the woman mad and angry before but never at him. She’d given him more love in the six years he’d been with her than he ever could have wished to have when he was five years old. He’d only spent four years with that whale of a man and his equally as large son and skinny twig of a wife. Somehow the memories still happened to wake him up late at night. Still even with a family of just the two of them and people sneering at his mother when they walked down the street calling her a multitude of names, he could not have been happier than he was with his mother.
Bellatrix almost sneers in contempt at the woman. She knew her child was small, years of mistreatment from those damned muggles had stunted his growth. She, however, did not like what the Weasley matriarch was implying by stating how small he was. “Ah yes, he is quite small for his age. He’s merely not reached his growth spurts yet. Cousin Regulus was quite small for his age as well until right before Hogwarts.” Molly Weasley looks less than pleased to be proven wrong. Harry feels vicious pride in his mother for handling the situation so well. Bellatrix obviously glances at her watch and offers Molly Weasley a look filled with false surprise. “I apologize for cutting our conversation short Molly, but I fear we will be late for our meeting the Goblins.”
Remus Lupin was still a slender and handsome as he had been when they were in school together. Time had aged him some and his features were splashed with many more scars than ever before, but his blonde hair was still beautiful and vibrant a sign of a strong bond to his mate. A werewolf with a strong bond to their chosen wizard could survive a great deal more than an unmated one. He brushed off the soot that had collected on his jacket pocket and takes a deep long breath before releasing it through his teeth and turning golden eyes toward the hallway housing the stairwell.
“You can call me Harry.”
“Regardless of whether it displeased Harion or not, you will remain for the festive if you come.” Her gaze is sharp and Severus finds himself unwilling to argue further with her. She and Narcissa certainly looked like siblings at this moment. “Though Harion is wise he is just a boy and he will show manners befitting of his station. Though, I suppose a conversation when he returns home couldn’t hurt anything either.” There is a teasing look on her face that is again unusual. It was like nothing he had ever seen on her features but he was not opposed. Again, it made her look younger...livelier than ever before.
Lucius smiles and presses a kiss to Narcissa’s temple before making a shooing motion at his wife. Narcissa grins and tugs Bellatrix away from her husband who had already sat down to begin penning a letter to the minister. “Oh, and darling, if you could press that we’d like very much to see our cousin as soon as possible.” Lucius huffs at his wife’s impatience but does not comment on it. The woman was obviously up to something or another and Lucius had long learned to ignore her. The less he knew about her scheming the better.
There were many things she remembered vividly despite her time under the influence of the imperius. Still, despite nearly seven years of working with the mind healers sadly, there were still many things that she struggled to remember. She remembers the night that she had supposedly tortured the Longbottoms, but she doesn’t remember actually doing the deed. Many people had spoken up about seeing her there and yet that could be easily manifested with the use of Polyjuice. For the last three sessions she had, Bellatrix had been struggling with a breakthrough. There was a potent amount of magical obscurity in her easily past, perhaps the earliest moment of her mind being altered, that she just could not get through. The magic was strong and widespread, not only focused on her, and the mind healer had been thinking it was some kind of old blood magic.
“Thank you, Bellatrix.”
“Oh have we upset crazy Bella’s little baby?” A darker haired seventh year raises a brow at the sixth year pair who just couldn’t seem to keep their mouths shut. Marcus Flint had heard quite enough about the powerful Black lord who was only a young boy. Harion Black had made a name for himself in the darker pureblood circles for mastering spells up to seven levels above his age level. He was truly a little prodigy of magic. These two boys were asking for punishment and Marcus would do little to help them. “What are you going to do brat? Call your insane mother to come crucio us until we’re just as crazy as her?”
Harry glances around the room feeling so much warm accepting magic seeped into every corner of the room. He had never felt anything so startlingly warm in his life save for perhaps the first hug he received from his mother after a nightmare.
“Well there may be a way other than Sirius to confirm whether they knew or not.” Narcissa and Bellatrix both turn to look at Lucius like he’s grown a third head. It was already hard enough to convince the minister to let the two women visit their cousin the first time. Surely, they wouldn’t succeed a second time at least not before his trial. “Really, don’t look at me like that. Your cousin does have a bonded who is still very much alive and very much not imprisoned, does he not?”
“Draco…we need to get up our mothers will be here soon.”
“Yes, sir.” Harion’s voice is quiet and barely audible. “I will take my leave then sir.”
It was easier than he thought it to be and yet he still saw the man wandering around more than entirely necessary; especially close to the third-floor corridor that was off limits. He was no Gryffindor and certainly not foolish enough to go into the corridor unprepared. However, he had heard whispers in the halls from other houses that the first year Weasley boy had gotten some sort of hero complex and felt that he and Draco were somehow wrapped up in everything going on and were somehow in cahoots with Quirrel for some reason only Merlin knows. “What a batty git. Who would willingly work with someone like that bloody madman?” Draco, foreseeably, was not pleased with Weasley ruining his good family name. Harry had heard the other boy talk about telling his father on more than one occasion.
Hello everyone! Just a quick update with another one coming along shortly. This chapter technically takes place a few weeks before the last update and from the point of view of Bellatrix no less. Hopefully, everything makes sense in the chapter and if it doesn't then it will slowly make sense in the next few chapters.
“Hello dear, have you got everything you need?”
They all turn at their head of house’s sharp drawl and Draco waits until the last person in the common room returns to their rooms leaving only himself and the rest of their small group of first years behind. “Sir, is she alright?” Theo asks quietly looking down at his shoes.
As the night progressed he found himself further and further thrown into a spiral of anger and guilt. Through all the poking and prodding the boy refused to stray far from the crazed Bellatrix Lestrange. His hands gripped onto her with a tightness and desperation Severus had seen only a few times before from children who experienced extreme trauma and abuse. Despite his fear of Severus and Lucius the boy never once uttered a word which Severus would later find out was normal for the boy. He remembers Lucius saying the boy had spoken for the first time when he was seven after living with Bellatrix and the Malfoys for two years.
“So bratty.” Marvolo chuckles. “Though I was created and portioned off from my soul at seventeen, might I correct you, I’ve had lifetimes to scour every book and writing left in these chambers. Salazar and our ancestors were brilliant beings who left journals and studies and writings behind here our familial space. Though I am perhaps twenty or so now, I have read of great loss and great loves. I was understandably relieved that I experienced some great love in my life post splitting my soul when your mother searched me out. Though to know that I had not succeeded in making my child’s life any better than my own pains me. Those pains have only grown now in knowing that even my grandchild has suffered a similar fate to my own.”
“Harry, dear you’re hissing at us.”
Harry wheezes out a pained laugh when Draco elbows him harshly in the ribs and turns his nose up at the whole lot of them. “If you must know, Mother and father have their fun like normal parents must. They do not enjoy those beast chasing their heir!” Harry laughs again when Draco daintily picks up a piece of toast and curls his lips in a disgusted sneer toward Pansy and Blaise. Theo was a bit further down the table making eyes as a certain bushy haired Gryffindor. That was no surprise really.
Hello all! I'm finally back. This year has been crazy hectic and really low for me. My family has suffered several really horrible losses this year and we're finally getting back on our feet and ready for the next year to bring something good for us. That being said I've finally gotten enough inspiration to start writing this story again.
The guard disappears and Narcissa settles primly onto the cold metal chair provided for them. Bellatrix was already cold enough and did not really want to place herself on a freezing chair to make it any worse. She felt a lot less comfortable than what Narcissa looked at the moment. As per instructed, for their own safety, of course, the pair to relinquish their wands upon entering the prison. That did not necessarily make her uncomfortable, she had lived for nearly four years without a wand following her trial after the first war. When she was deemed mentally stable enough she was allowed a wand again but the lack of one only made her better at casting wandless spells like Accio and warming charms. She’d only gotten a wand returned to her right before Harry had entered her life. His presence had made her entire perspective change. Without him, Bellatrix was not sure that she would be in the same place mentally that she was today.
“It means that there is a student being mistreated by their own house.” All their eyes turn sharply to see Marcus Flint standing to their left with his wand drawn and ready just in case someone or something breached their common room. “It means that they have more in common with up snakes than they should. It makes them an honorary snake in the pit.”
He’s tugged out the door and Narcissa’s eyebrow crease in confusion as they are escorted out of the prison slowly and given their wands back. “Whatever do you think he could have meant by greeting the moon for him?” Narcissa wonders aloud. Perhaps he might be slowly going insane in there a mind healer would definitely be in order once her cousin was freed. Bellatrix stops short for a long moment then continues walking as if nothing had happened.
They both share a knowing look before their standing in sync and hurrying down the halls toward the library. If anyone could get them into the infamous Azkaban prison it would be the man who keeps the minister of magic like a lapdog. Lucius Malfoy was a man of many talents and great influence, but he was also poorly prepared for heading off his wife when she set her mind to something much less his wife and her oldest sister. They find him sitting in the library, on the floor no less, surrounded by piles upon piles of books.
“What happened after the contract was absolved? Not long after that the first war really broke out and all of us were controlled in one way or another. Father died shortly after that as well.” Narcissa studies the look of unease on her oldest sister’s face when she speaks of one of the most horrible times in both of their lives. For a moment Bellatrix had thought she would forever be a prisoner in her own mind. “Who was the man you were to be bonded with?”
The headmaster had cornered him and lead him toward his office with a strong hand on his shoulder. He was playing the foolish old bat card but Harry had been warned that he was much more conniving than he looked. He’d also overheard Uncle Lucius one time saying that Dumbledore even sold out his own lover when he went ‘dark’. That one was obviously a conversation he was not meant to overhear. His mother would prefer it if Harry didn’t remember anything at all about his previous childhood and that he was left unaware of the world outside of their home. She’d seen too many horrors of her own not to want to protect him from it all.
“As much as I’d love to believe that sir, you are not my mother’s favorite person. All things considered, you’re not very high on my list either considering you tried to throw her into Azkaban when she was obviously severally mentally broken. My mother is a good woman but I am her only child and she would see you dismantled before allowing me to meet with you privately. Now, if you’ll excuse me, headmaster, I’ve got class with Professor Snape, and as I am not Professor Snape’s favorite person I would rather not be late.”
Draco’s eagle owl reached the table with precision followed closely by the snowy white owl his mother had bought him just days before when they were shopping for the last of his things. He had named the pristine female Hedwig. Clutched in her talons is a piece of parchment sealed with the colorless black wax of the Black family.
“Yes. They’ve been treating her so poorly in the lion’s den.” Harry narrows his eyes sharply at that knowing how evil children and other people could really be. He had never liked bullies and likely never would. “I’m worried that she’s hurt.”
“Yes, I had deduced that it might be about that on my own my darling wife.” Lucius shuffles toward another bookshelf tucked a bit further back and plucks a book from its hold. He opens it to the first few pages and flips through them before huffing and snapping it closed. “What makes you think he would even agree to speak with you two, to begin with? Or have you both forgotten that you are estranged?”
“Perhaps we should call Severus. He’s better with these things.” Lucius steps up and studies the young face of the boy intently. His features are more sharp than the rounded jawline and nose of the Potter family and his magic sounder and more powerful despite his young age and malnourished appearance. “He’s a powerful child. I would venture a guess that his magical core has been sustaining him all this time.”
“Careful not everyone’s parents can plead insanity to get out of Azkaban.”
“What are you going to do?” Narcissa skirted over the obvious statement of what they both came to conclude. If James could not physically be with Lily Evans without losing his magic, then he would not have impregnated her with Harry. The question of who Harry’s father became one that Bellatrix found she could not answer at the moment. “Do you plan to go to the goblins?”
-Alia
Their first week of classes had gone by without much fanfare. The new additions to the snake pit found out rather quickly that the only class they were treated equally in was the potions class. Though charms class was a break from the devastating transfiguration classes with Gryffindor’s head of house, it because abundantly clear that the snakes needed to stick together for a reason. Harry was intelligent, his knack for picking up spells and facts out of thin air was only fueled by the abundance of books and readings he was given access to as a young boy. All of the Black family archives were at his disposal as well as most of the Malfoy family library.
“And you think I do?”
“Pans, I adore you and we’ve practically been raised together, but I will end you.” Harry glares sharply and for anyone else, it might have made them run for the hills. Pansy merely laughs and went back to filing her nails. “Though I am unaware of why Snape dislikes me, that has not influenced my decision.”
“So, James Potter and my Lillian were never truly together?” Harry shakes his head and turns away from the man at the thought of his birth father who had yet to speak to him since that fateful day. Marvolo pulls his head away for a short moment and contemplates the boy before him. There was a sadness in his eyes as if the very thought of someone caused him great grief. His father, perhaps? Yes, it certainly was his father. If not James Potter than likely Severus. He had surely been the only man his Lillian had ever truly loved. Had Severus not known? “Come with me little one.”
“Oh yeah!” the guard pulls open his outer robes slight and pulls an official ministry file out before resizing it. “Here you are then.”
“Bella, are you alright?”
“Did James Potter have a biological son?”
Harion glances around the room once more wondering what secrets lay behind the doors present. Surely Slytherin’s long thought lost library would reside here where only his blood could find it. Perhaps even more could be found in the depths of their passages if his mother and grandfather hadn’t thought to remove such things.
“Are you alright?” Bellatrix pulls back to look over her son with sharp eyes. She looked for any hair out of place or a scratch somewhere one had not been before. “Lucius told us there was a troll in the dungeons. Were you and Draco safe? I just about wanted to storm into that retched headmaster’s office and tear him apart for putting my little lord in danger!”
“I told Professor Snape he was my father around a fortnight ago. Maybe more, I’m not sure.” Harion is gazing into the fire with a clear distance in his eyes like he was reliving the memories again: anew. “Needless to say, he did not take it well. He sent me about my way with little more than a brush off. My bonding mate, Draco Malfoy, was unhappy with his godfather and refused to speak with the man for some time. Seeing this I distanced myself from the issue so that they may reunite as godson and godfather. I would not want Severus’ hatred for me and my blood to cause a rift between him and Draco. Draco has done nothing wrong and does not deserve his ire.”
“Ugh.” Draco rolls away from Harry to flatten himself out on his back and stares blearily up at the canopy of silver and green above their heads. He frowns softly before tugging Harry forward into his silk-clad chest for another cuddle. “I don’t want to get up, it’s warm.”
“That depends on what is it you would want.”
Harion whirls around and strains his ears for the careful hissing again.
The little boy nods determinedly and shuffles away from his mother who is straightening to her full height once more. His mother really was a lovely woman. Her glassy blue eyes and striking black hair were enough to draw eye to her and yet her alluringly strong disposition made people want to be seen with her despite her past mistakes. She was powerful and her magic radiated from her even when it was under control.
“You knew?”
The dungeons were chillier than anywhere he had ever lived and his mother owled him a charmed quilt she had bought in Diagon Alley just a few days into the week. The dungeons were also slightly volatile with the old students becoming acclimated with the bunch of new first years in the room. Harry and Draco were two of the more problematic additions to the snake pit for their last names and the power and stigma attached from the first war. Despite both familial named being tinged with dark magic the Black and Malfoy name carried significant weight in the wizarding world of Britain.
Harry jumps in shock as a beautiful and massive emerald green snake moves across the room from one of the passageways. Harion immediately recognizes it as a basilisk from its shrouded yellow gaze. He’d heard many stories about the king of serpents once his mother found out about his parseltongue abilities. For a time she’d even called him her little basilisk because he would one day be a powerful lord just as the basilisk lorded over all other snakes.
The doors glow briefly for a long moment before dimming and refusing to open. With a hissed curse Harion lays a palm against the door and speaks again. “
Severus takes the parchment that Harion slides across the benchtop to him with stiff fingers. Perhaps if he stares close enough, he could see it in the color of the boy's hair and the seemingly too round shape of his eyes or the subtle curvature of his nose but in the same breath, he looked for all the world like a Potter or a Black.
Narcissa takes the quill and documents back from Sirius who is smiling crookedly toward them. His teeth, which had always been beautiful, were not in great shape but still nicer than most prisoners likely were. Once he was freed, she had no doubt he would be once they pushed for it, then they would get his teeth fixed first and foremost as well as get him in to see a mind healer.
“We’ll be sure to find you if we happen upon it.”
Harion glances behind himself at the open doorway and takes pause. Would anyone come looking for him like last time and find a massive chamber opened in the bathroom? Would a wayward girl stumble in unafraid of the ghost haunting the room? Myrtle was gone for now, but would she go blabbing that the sinks were open to a professor or worse the headmaster?
“Perhaps Mr. Black you should return to your common room until dinner.” There is a very brief look of devastation that crossed Harion’s eyes before it disappears behind the mask of pureblood upbringing. Severus is certain that he has come to the wrong conclusion, but he couldn’t bring himself to comment on any of this information without really coming to terms with everything. “It would likely be for the best that you speak to very few about the information you overheard Harion.”
“May I inquire into why that is Miss Black?”
“Okay then.” All eyes turn to Harry as he places his utensils down and begins to pack away his bag. “Let’s go find her. No one deserves to be friendless.”
Harion doesn’t even move when Draco wraps his long limbs around him protectively. Draco pulls the younger boy’s face into his chest and tightens a hand in his hair. “You don’t have to say anything if you don’t want to…but it’s not your fault. Whatever this is…it’s not your fault.” Harion shivers and Draco spells the blankets around them and the curtains closed with a flick of his wand.
“You never know, you could be so insane that you looked like a snake hybrid with no nose, a forked tongue, and no hair.” Harion watches in unrestrained glee as a shiver goes down the spine of the horcrux. He outright laughs when Marvolo brings a hand to his crisply coifed hair. Marvolo shoots him a sharp glare and turns Harion by the shoulder to shuffle him out the door of the library. “I was just joking! As far as I’m aware your probably some waif possessing my DADA professor.”
“And at the moment we have no way of confirming or denying Sirius’ knowledge of any of this.” Narcissa huffs quietly and taps her nails against the edge of the armchair she’s sitting in. “Even with this knowledge, what would we be able to do with any of this information until Harion comes of age or is better protected from Albus.”
All eyes turn to Draco as he speaks but they quickly linger to Harry who is staring pointedly down ta his food. Between the two of them, Draco took the lead more often than not and he knew Harry’s moods better than anyone else in the world including their parents. When something upset Harry, it upset Draco, and therefore Draco would do whatever it was to eliminate that cause of Harry’s unease. If it meant befriending a friendless muggleborn than he supposes he would do that as well.
“And he cannot even take care of a troll.” Gemma Farley mutters under her breath.
Again I apologize for not updating for so long. I hope to update more regularly but I hope you understand if that doesn't happen. This year has been really weird all around so I'm hoping 2021 treats us a little bit better. Anyway, leave a comment if you'd like and tell me what you thought!
“You say that,” Harion whispers. “But you don’t even know what happened.”
“Have a wonderful day, ladies.” The guards haul Sirius up out of the chair as he slips into the guise of losing his mind. “Please stop and say hello to the moon for me.”
Harry woke up earlier than he normally would have on a Saturday morning. His eyes are instantly drawn to the mop of silvery blond hair that is nuzzled into his collarbones. Draco’s body heat has seeped through the blankets and warmed up Harry’s cold limbs. Even at only eleven, barely near the beginning of growth spurts, Draco’s legs are miles longer than Harry’s. Harry’s toes brush against the middle of Draco’s shins and Draco’s has one long leg wrap haphazardly around Harry’s legs.
“If it isn’t the ickle little firsties. Having a chat are we Malfoy?” An older boy perhaps a sixth year whose family were unaligned in the first war balances on the edge of the sofa Draco and Harry re sharing. “And what have we here? Little Mister Black. How’s that insane mommy of yours?”
Blaise greets them from outside their drawn curtains on his way to the bathroom. Theo chuckles from somewhere off to the side of the room likely near his own bunk. Harry sits up and pulls the curtains open to offer Blaise’s retreating figure a sharp glare. Harry drops down from his bunk and hisses as his feet make contact with the chilled dungeon floors. By the time he’s finished getting ready Draco is finally finishing his shower and entering their room to dress for his day with his mother.
“But of course.”
“You’re entire manor reeks of my cub.” It was little more than a growl and had Bellatrix not anticipated as much, she would have been terrified of a territorial werewolf. “Why does it smell like my cub?”
Harry had his eyes only set on the pair of grumbling sixth years as they tried to right themselves. His wand flies out and moves with such precision as both boys’ bodies are bound so tightly their ribs crack from the pressure. A flurry of small hexes with a lot of punch hit boy boys who end up with stinging faces swollen in several areas. Finally, Harry steps forward and stress down at them, his green eyes flashing dangerously. A child runs down the backs of a few older students as they catch sight of the magic fluttering about the small boy’s body.
Harry chuckles dryly at the over exaggerated gagging noises coming from the blond-haired boy curled up on his lap. Draco had always and still does find the attraction that Theo had toward girls a bit disturbing. Though Blaise happily supplied that it was because Draco likely batted for the other team, Draco always snarked back that it was a good thing his bonding contract was with Harry and not Pansy then wasn’t it. That always made Harry glance his way and raise a brow in amusement. Draco was usually not a very outwardly affectionate person lest it involved Harry. Blaise just had the ability to get under Draco’s skin in ways that most could not because he had known them for so long.
Azkaban was cold and damp and made Bellatrix shiver in disgust. She was so entirely grateful to the team of mind healers who had helped keep her from this place. Just the thought of being sent here made her want to empty the contents of her stomach. She would not have lasted very long in here with how destroyed her mind already was after the war. She felt bad for all the prisoners. No matter what heinous acts they may have committed in their lives no one deserves to live in such filth. Even the spineless men and women who worshiped the ground the dark lord walked on did not deserve this squalor. They certainly did not deserve luxury, but they deserve the right to have sanity and simply sit in isolation lamenting on their mistakes for the rest of their days. Insanity was an easy way out of atoning for your actions.
They all begin packing away their things but stop short when the doors to the Great Hall are slammed open and Quirrel is standing there panting harshly. “Troll! Troll in the dungeons! Just thought you should know.” He then proceeds to pass out in front of the entire student body.
Now, after finally having broken the blockage, Bellatrix is not so sure that she had wanted to. Things were still partially fragmented, something Bellatrix had become accustomed to, and there were no answers yet. Bella only had questions. Many people, who did not know the art of mind healing, thought that the healing was instantaneous and that the memories returned suddenly. Sadly, as much as she wished that to be so, it was not. Memories were fickle and often would return in segments often different segments of different memories forming at the same time. Rarely do memories return whole or in a form that makes sense.
“Let’s tell professor Snape,” Pansy suggests. “Surely he will tell McGonagall.”
“No,” Sirius mutters quietly. There is venom in his voice, but it’s not necessarily directed toward them. “Did you think they would?”
Severus had not expected for the young boy to ever question his parentage. It was never hidden from him that he was Harry Potter. Why would Bellatrix think to have a heritage test completed on the boy? Things just didn’t line up. Harion is still staring at him deep in thought. Clearing his throat Severus speaks. “I did. Though how that is much of a revelation I am not entirely sure.” Harion glances toward the window and Severus realizes that there is something more, something much larger than this detail.
“If he so much as accuses Aunty Bella, you know father will have the entire weight of the Malfoy fortune on him.” Draco reaches forward to fix a strand of Harry’s long black curls. His fingers linger purposefully on Harry’s ear while he offers Harry his signature Malfoy grin. “Not to worry. My father will certainly hear about this. I’ll ensure it.”
“Yes,” Bellatrix whispers. She wanted to take Harry from the school as soon as she collected her thoughts earlier today but knew that it would arouse suspicions if she picked him up randomly without much notice. Samhain was a few weeks away, to begin with, and she was picking him up then to visit graves of past relatives as well as to visit Lily and James Potter's graves. Her heart ached for the love she lost. The memory of the pain of the bonding contract snapping away from her soul with the departure of his felt fresh with the memory newly uncovered. She knew that there were clearly underhanded dealings that occurred and had a feeling that James Potter knew more than he let on when he passed on. “Narcissa, I vaguely recall a letter. It came when I was deep in the clutches of the imperius. It’s a fractured memory, one that hasn’t cleared up yet, but it was from James.”
Bellatrix returns to walking after brushing off any dirt that may have gotten on her robes. “Hmm, a lion in with the snakes how unusual.” Harry nods and glances up at his mother as she offers him a tight smile. “We will be visiting Gringotts first before visiting the graves of my mother and father, cousin Regulus’ grave, as well as the special grave we visit every year, is that alright with you?”
“Besides, Uncle Sev doesn’t hate Harry per say he merely doesn’t like anyone.” Draco reaches forward to play with Harry’s fingers. Harry smiles indulgently at his best friend. “Except for me of course, I am a special case, after all.”
They stop before a small room close to the center of the compound with seats and a rusty looking grey table. The room otherwise was bare and there were windows looking out every side. Dementors circled the room every now and then ghosting their spiny fingers across the glass and frosting it over. “Here this will help with the dementors.” The guard hands over two chocolate bars and offers them the closest thing to a smile if ever there was one in this place. “You two can have a seat in there. They’ll bring prisoner Black down in a few moments. He’s been refusing to eat lately, a bit barmy that one, but I guess you’d have to be to do what he did. Didn’t think he’d been able to with how they were y’know.”
The portrait falls closed once every last student was in the common room, not many of them were standing around, to be honest, but they were huddled into groups with the first years being effectively pushed further into the common space away from the portrait as time ticked by.
“Hn.” Snape glances at where Draco and Harion are both sharing contemplative looks with one another as if debating something silently with one another. It was a bit unsettling. “Perhaps by sharing your knowledge of betrothal customs with Mr. Weasley you will enlighten him on a world he certainly should have known long before now.”
“Do you think he’ll help her?” Theo asks nervously.
The bell signaling the end of class sounds and Professor Snape doesn’t turn from the papers on the desk when he speaks up over the students. “Mr. Black please remain behind.” Draco glances at Harry and Harry turns his eyes away from the blond. Draco huffs angrily and storms out of the room with Pansy and Blaise hot on his heels. The Gryffindors stare at the three retreating backs before shrugging and making jokes. Harion picks at the edge of a piece of parchment tucked into his textbook.
The rest of the boys in their dorm had already cleared out for the day leaving Draco and Harry to themselves. Harry studies the slightly older boy with faraway eyes. “Is it odd to you that we are to be bonded?” Draco hums in confusion likely processing the question slowly due to his half-asleep state. His hands are busy fixing his clothing to look just right. He was never one to not impress.
“No long story short, Harion is the son of Severus and Lily, heir to the Prince line. He is the last living Gaunt child in existence thanks to his mother who was illegally stolen from her family and sold off as a fake muggle-born. He’s also going to be Lord of both the Potter line by blood adoption, as well as, the Black family when he completes his bonding contract with Draco. All of which, I’m assuming, Cousin Sirius knew when he used the family magic to adopt the boy. With the protections of two ancient wizarding houses and the blood of a founder running through his veins he should be nearly untouchable by meddlesome old fools.”
Any whooooo...I hope you all enjoyed this chapter!
“Pans is quite right.” Blaise wraps a protective arm around Harry’s shoulder and his magic simmers down a bit. “While we are quite used to your unusual gift, those Gryffindor children passing us by are not. And we need not repeat the troubles we’ve had growing up, do we?”
“Yes, I suppose that I do.” Narcissa glances toward the library when a thud sounds only to shake her head and chuckle softly when they both hear a poorly muffled curse from Lucius. “Mother and father found my bonding to be very pleasing. You never said very much about it. Of course, you have always been the type. I had thought he was very fond of you with the number of owls the two of you sent and received. Andromeda and I were always joking we were going to lose an owl at the rate you two were going. And then mother merely said that the bonding was called off and nothing more.”
“No, not quite.” Marvolo watches as the young boy tilts his head in a way so much like his Lillian that it sends a pang of sadness through his heart. “The masses were told that James and Lily Potter were slain on the night of October 31, 1981, by the Dark Lord Voldemort in Godric’s Hollow. What truly happened is unknown but on that night my mother, James Potter, and the other half of your soul were destroyed.”
Only once the classroom clears out and the door shuts behind everyone does Severus speak up.
“While I agree with you,” Harry says in a quiet whisper. “I don’t think our mothers would appreciate being kept waiting especially if they got word of a troll being in the dungeons.” Draco sighs softly and sits up in Harry’s bed. His bunk had pretty much remained untouched for the entirety of the year so far. He’d spent every night curled around Harry, much to the humor of their friends.
“I don’t have to know what happened to know.” Draco pulls Harion impossibly closer. He’d always been bigger than Harion, but it was even more now that they were hitting their growth spurts. Draco towered over Harion. He could practically hide Harion with his body if he really felt like it. “I know that you’re not at fault.”
The few people in the room jump up in shock when the two boys fly across the room and slam into the marbled stairwell across from the furious looking first year. Harry stood glaring darkly at the pair of boys making up the crumpled heap of body on the floor.
Severus finds himself taken aback. He often had joined the Malfoy family for Yule feast but never the morning of Yule or the eve before. Those were times set aside strictly for the family. Bellatrix had always been overly protective of her time with her son. She would ensure that he experienced each of the sabbats to their fullest extent. Yule especially was an important time of year for them since it had been Harion’s first sabbat spent with them. He’d been found shortly after Samhain.  To be invited into her home on one of the most important and cherished Sabbats to her and Harion was something he would not take lightly. Were it anyone else he would likely refuse but a part of him desired, more than anything, to know his son.
Draco settles back into the bed with a conceding sigh. “Okay.” Draco stays curled up with the other boy and wipes his tears away when they eventually spill over the apples of his cheeks. They hold one another close even through dinner. Draco ignores the slight hunger in his stomach and instead falls asleep with the younger boy. Eventually when the other boys return to the dorm later that night, and Blaise peaks in the curtains, they find Draco wrapped entirely around Harion. His long arms have the younger boy’s head pulled tightly into his chest and his leg thrown around the boy’s waist. Harion’s hands are fisted as tightly as possible around Draco like he was afraid the older boy would disappear.
“Woman you will be the death of me.” Lucius leans against his desk which is filled with a scattering of parchments, quills, and books open to several pages about blood magic healing spells. “If it would make you happy, darling, I suppose I could owl the minister. It will be kept entirely quiet, darling. The press cannot know about your visit or it will make us look bad.”
“So you’re saying that Marvolo Riddle was actually the Dark Lord Voldemort?” Bellatrix nods sending a few more strands of hair tumbling down from her bun. Clicking her tongue she plucks her wand from her hair and with a simple swish the strands are rearranging themselves haphazardly once more. Severus watches as she tucks the wand back into her hair. “Who is Tom Riddle then?”
Harry glances to the left to see a redhead looking their way with a disgusted sneer on his parched lips. Pansy bares her teeth in irritation and Draco slowly drops his hand from Harry’s ear. Harry drastically misses his best friend’s warmth. Pureblood intermarriage was a custom passed down from family to family and as it stood whether someone actually knew it or not, Harry and Draco were not actually blood-related. They had been betrothed from the moment Bellatrix officially registered Harion Black as her son.
“What have they been doing to her that has you so worried Theo?”
“You and me against the world.”
“Why are you so smart?” Harion turns and raises an eyebrow at his grandfather. He wondered briefly what Marvolo would look like today. “Aren’t you like perpetually in the mind of a sixteen-year-old?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I still argue she was missorted with those bunch,” Pansy says with a flick of her black hair over her shoulder. Her nose scrunches in the oddly unflattering way that makes her look like those dogs with the scrunched up faces that muggles love so much. “Should have been a Ravenclaw I say.”
"Malfoy, Draco,"
"Shut it, Potter." Draco hissed as the greasy caretaker rounded the corner with a crooked grin plastered across his face.
"And 10 points from Slytherin for the book." Snape said to Harry before turning and walking away.
“Language!” Harry scolded.
Harry frowned, "What about it? You just said we're not allowed to go, what could we do?"
"Aw, Harry. I'm sure that int true!" Hagrid ruffled his hair, and Harry almost slammed his face into the table.
"I was going to show Harry my room."
Harry looked at him, awkwardly, "Erm... Ron and I are staying."
When the Gryffindors stopped, the teacher, whom he had learned to be Madame Hooch, barked at them, "Well, what are you all waiting for? Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on; hurry up."
"Hey, I'm sorry for being a bit of a prick earlier. You're uh... pretty cool." Ron squirmed as he maneuvered his way through the social obstacle course.
"Shut up, Malfoy," scowled one of the Patil twins.
Harry ran his hands through his hair, "Gah... so, what's the plan, then, huh?"
"Merlin... so what do you want me to do?"
"Oh. I thought it would be like a sleepover. Don't people usually stay in the same room?"
"Woah, really? Huh, I never thought that you could do that." Draco smirked.
could have better Christmas decorations than his family, right? After all, he was a pureblood family. He was better, right? Right? Though he refused to admit it, the school's feeling seemed more like home than it did at the manor.
"Yes, you!" Draco elbowed Harry lightly before letting out a small yelp as the pain from hitting bone registered, "Merlin! Tell me they at least fed you!" He rubbed his elbow.
tell me that?" Draco's voice rose in pitch.
Hermione.
However, the scowl didn't vanish for long; the next morning in potions class, it emerged. Harry wasn't surprised.
"But-" Draco protested.
Harry was a fast reader. He always had been, even when the subjects were dull and boring. He never had much else to do than read in his spare time, and he found the beatings worth it to bring home books from the school library. Dudley never read, so it wasn’t as if Harry could borrow from him. He was never very picky about what books he read. Whatever it was, it occupied his mind and provided some sort of escape from the Dursleys, at least temporarily. Now, the books that Draco was handing him? They were more than just an escape. They were a new world. Harry was actually interested in what the pages described. Draco had to keep reminding him that he wasn’t meant to actually be
"You're my friend?" Harry asked as hope flickered within him.
Harry laughed awkwardly, "Uh, yeah? My aunt and uncle kept me in a cupboard for 11 years- they don't want me there for Christmas. I'd just be a bother."
After potions, Draco, Harry, and Ron were talking- mostly Harry- when a large green object came into view. It was a Christmas tree, a rather large one being carried by a large man- the half-giant.
"Wish me luck, Harry!" Draco exclaimed as he ran up the stairs.
He watched Draco inspect the ball for a few moments before taking it out of Draco's grasp and handing it to Neville, "Malfoy, what are you doing?" He seethed.
The boys were on their best behaviour when they were out in public, but their dormmates knew that they were talking all night, earning them quite a few pillows to their heads. Once they had finally gone to sleep, it was time to wake up. Harry looked at Crabbe and Goyle as they got up and glared at him. Why him? Draco was talking just as much...
“What is that? Is that…? That looks like a Weasley sweater. Who’s it from?” His father began pacing toward him.
Of course, he was oblivious. He always was.
"We did it!" Ron breathed in relief as Harry pulled his wand from the troll's nose.
"Oh- Draco, this is Hermione Granger. Hermione - Draco Malfoy," Harry attempted to introduce the two of them to each other.
The color quickly drained from Draco's cheeks, "A cupboard...? They kept you in a cupboard?"
By now, the word had spread across the Great Hall, and Draco hurried him out and towards the hospital wing, the Hall silent as Harry's oversized shoes hit against the wooden floor.
"So, did you get my letter? You didn't-"
The bickering stopped immediately.
Harry's eyes widened, realizing that he should really
The bushy haired girl shoved past them, tears evident on her face. Harry glared at Ron. He didn't see her for the rest of the day but heard whispers of her sobbing in the girls' restroom.
Harry nodded, trying his best to keep his legs still as he slowly learned about vampires. Harry could swear that his brain was stuttering now.
The boys quickly ran into the room, Ron throwing a pipe at the troll as Harry somehow managed to get onto it's back, his wand up its nose. Ron urged Hermione to run and proceeds to use his newfound skills to knock the troll over with its own club.
"Actually, Professor," Hermione interjected, "It was my idea to find the troll. I thought I could defeat it by myself. Ron and Harry came to my rescue."
to uphold
“Honestly, Harry. Azazel’s smart enough to not drop it off at the table when I’m not there. Worst case scenario, I’ll get it a day late.”
Harry knocked on the door, waiting a long moment before knocking again. He hesitantly cracked the door open, hoping that Snape had left it in the empty room. So much for an empty room- Harry watched as Filch patched up Snape's horrifying leg as Snape held his robes up.
The girl froze, returning quickly to her work. Harry finished the class without another word to her, ending up beside Ron as the students filed out of the room.
Ron gave an approving nod.
Draco turned red, "Yes, mum."
"Wait, so... you think that the dog is-"
"Just c'mon." Draco grabbed his hand, pulling him towards the stairs in a hurry.
"What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?"
"How-" Harry sighed, "How did it not cross your mind to
Harry and Hermione looked at each other awkwardly as the two boys bickered.
Draco's cold fingers wrapped around Harry's wrist as he went to inspect his friend's forehead, "What's wrong, Harry?"
He looked back one last time, and he swore that he could see a look of concern on the ginger's face before it turned to a scowl. Could he still care?
Professor McGonagall stared down at her through slim glasses, "I'm thoroughly disappointed in you, Ms. Granger. I'm afraid I'll have to take 5 points from Gryffindor due to your reckless actions. Return to your dormitory at once."
They meet Hagrid, and Draco has suspicions
Draco looked across the hall, a bit confused as it seemed the same as the rest of the hall. When he turned back, the tree suddenly had ornaments on it, and Hagrid was grinning awkwardly.
"You wanna try that again?" Harry snapped, having heard the slur much too many times in the Slytherin common room, "Or should my friend's father hear about this?"
Harry grinned.
"I hope I haven't made it harder for Ron to sneak in the library," Harry murmured as the train jostled him from side to side.
“You weren’t very inconspicuous with inviting me,” Harry pointed out.
"Actually, we do, sir. Thank you for your time." Draco stood and pocketed a rock cake and rushed Harry out of the cabin.
"Oh, come on, Potter. If that were true, can you imagine what kind of trouble the school would be in? He wouldn't actually let anyone die here." Draco rolled his eyes.
He barely managed to get there in time to watch Draco snatch it from Neville's hand. Harry stood behind him, confused. His eyes flickered to Ron, who looked to be ignoring him rather than glaring at him. He wasn't sure if this was an improvement or not.
"Well, I'm glad he's helping you."
"Excuse me."
"No, my hair's just forever sleeping." Harry groaned, glancing at Draco as he spoke.
"He was limping." Nodded Hermione.
Malfoy paused, biting his lip as if he was considering something. He glanced at the Slytherins before turning back to respond, "It's just a little fun, Potter," He spat, "Didn't know you were such a killjoy." His face contradicted his words, a look of sympathy flashed in his eyes.
"Why'd you do that, Malfoy?" Harry fumed.
He could always guess what color Draco's eyes would be by where they were. If they were in the dungeons, they were a dark green, darker than the trees of the forbidden forest. When they were in the Great Hall, the candles bounced off of his eyes and gave a sort of goldish hue. When they were outside, they were practically always a striking hazel color, unless the sky was grey and cloudy, then his eyes matched the moisture surrounding him.
He glanced back towards the train, refusing to look at his father's face. Harry meekly shambled out, tripping on the last step down. Draco was going to help him. He should've helped him. He didn't. Harry quickly stood up and brushed his knees off, wiping the sweat off his hands before thrusting his hand towards Draco's father.
He shifted in the sheets before sitting up, his eyes meeting Draco's, now a silvery blue. Nothing moved for a few minutes, the boys just sitting and staring in silence.
"Good thing one of us is observant, then."
The hall erupted with worry as the professors sought to maintain peace. Dumbledore's voice soon boomed throughout the room, ordering the prefects to lead the students back to their dormitories. The Slytherins protested, as their dorms were in the dungeons where the troll was. Something calmed them down, but Harry didn't hear it. His mind was too busy racing. Hermione had no idea.
"You never told me," Draco murmured.
He sneered at the two boys, "Been naughty, have we? You know you aren't allowed in the third-floor corridor... Headmaster's orders."
"What was that?" Harry panted
“There was an attempted robbery then, as well,” Draco muttered quietly.
"You made it, Harry! You did it! You..." Draco gazed at Harry's troubled face with concern, "What's wrong, Harry?"
Harry closed it and handed it to him, "It's Quidditch Through the A-"
"If there's a dangerous animal at Hogwarts," Draco interjected, "Who do you think would be in charge of it?"
Draco stopped suddenly in front of the doors of the Great Hall, "Flying lessons, Potter. I have to impress."
He felt a pang of jealousness, Draco was his only friend... but he wasn't Draco's.
"Just looking," The boy muttered before striding back to the Slytherin table.
The boys beamed, running off back to their dormitories after being ordered to by Professor McGonagall. Harry found himself surrounded by Draco and Pansy when he returned, both glaring at him.
She called him Harry. She was such a soft, motherly figure, and she had called him Harry. Harry had forgotten that maternal figures were meant to be loving.
“Oh, sod off. Gimme that!” Harry snatched the cloak back, looking at it in detail.
Harry laughed at the dog, while Draco took a step back for a moment before entering the cabin as well.
"Hello, sir! I'm-"
Harry woke on Christmas morning with Draco dumping a few packages on him, “No idea how they knew you were here, but here’s your presents.”
His mother nodded quietly, her eyes warm.
He waited unabatingly for his name to be called.
The corridors were silent as Harry walked towards the staircase. Drip. Harry stopped, panicking for a moment before realizing that they were under the Great Lake. He resumed his pace, stepping silently up the stairs, his mind racing.
"Oh," Draco's heart stumbled for a moment, but he wasn't quite sure why, "Well the teacher's lounge isn't far from here. I'm sure you can go there and ask Snape for the book back."

Draco smirked, "Really? I guess that would make sense-"
"Oh, no, please call me Harry." He smiled, watching as her eyes flickered over his green robes. He braced himself for the typical 'Slytherins are evil!' remark.
Feel free to interact with me there and send me fanart! I'd love to see some!
"Well, c'mon then!" The half-giant waved the boys over, and they went excitedly to the Great Hall.
"Imagine staying here for
Harry looked up as Draco replied to the girl, "We were just going to go outside, Pansy. That's all."
"There," Draco moved back, and Harry wondered how much time he had spent standing there thinking. Draco gave no hint to the answer of this question and instead turned to get ready himself.
Do your part, says Aunt Petunia. Do your part, says Uncle Vernon. Do your part, says Dudley. Do your part, says the world. But what if you're doing it wrong?
"Wherever you think best," Harry murmured.
"You do realize that we have Defense Against the Dark Arts before, right? No point in eating so fast." Draco laughed.
"Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard. Keep your brooms even, lift a few feet, and then come straight back down by tilting forward slightly. On my whistle -- three -- two --"
Draco cocked his eyebrow, ”Sure.”
"Ha, I wish," Harry snorted, quickly wiping away the moisture from his nostrils.
"You're kidding," Draco stared at him.
Draco hit her with the back of his hand, "Oh, shut it. Anyone would, he's the most powerful wizard- and he's our age!"
“Did you hear about the Quidditch match?” Harry whirled around in the hall as he asked Draco.
Draco fell silent before muttering, "It doesn't, I suppose."
"You're Harry Potter." The girl squeaked. Of course, he didn't know when he'd ever get used to being unique.
Harry watched as Draco walked towards the Slytherin table as he processed this. Why would Draco have to impress? More importantly, who? This was, of course, only the first lesson. They would all be learning, and Harry doubted they were even going to be in the air this time. He followed Draco, eyes lingering at the ceiling windows where the owls swooped in with mail.
"Look over there, Potter." He gestured towards the Gryffindor table.
. What is this?” Harry shoved a parchment into Draco’s face.
"Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?" taunted Pansy, "Never thought you'd like fat little crybabies, Patil."
"Blasted thing,” Snape said. “How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?”
Draco scoffed, “How would you know? Yours is
"Me?" Harry frowned.
"And you two," She gestured to Ron and Harry, "Despite your terrible idea, you managed to execute it without losing your lives. 5 points to Gryffindor and Slytherin."
He glanced at Draco, whose icy blue eyes glistened in the dim light of the dungeons as he looked at the professor. Draco was different. Draco didn't care about who he was, just about who he is. That was the difference.
Harry bit his lip while he waited for his pale-haired friend to gather his things, "Hurry up!"
"Harry."
"Oh, yeah. I didn't even know about wizards. It all just sort of happened."
the books, but skimming the pages for “Nicholas Flamel”.
Harry rolled his eyes, ” I know that. People say it to me all the time. Why did Blaise say it? Heck, what does it even mean?”
"Right. And they know I'm coming, right?"
Harry was saved from having to come up with something to say as the professor- Professor McGonagall, returned, "Right. They're ready for you in the Great Hall now," She walked through the massive doors into the Great Hall.
"You okay?" Draco whispered to him, not wanting any rumors to quell.
Snape let out a sigh to calm himself down. "Excellent, Potter. Let's hope that everyone else wrote that down."
of it? How is Quidditch an art?" Hermione interjected.
"Hello, there," He sat next to her, watching her bright brown eyes look up at him before widening and returning to her book, "Sorry, am I making you uncomfortable?" He moved to get up.
Harry watched as Draco rushed out of the room. He looked around the guest bedroom, noticing how an inch of the carpet looked more expensive than the entire Dursley house. It was strange; Harry thought that Draco would be happier, considering how much money the boy had. He grew up with parents who loved him. He grew up practically using money as scrap paper. The more Harry thought of it, the more he noticed how differently Draco acted once they had left Hogwarts. It must be the magical aura, he decided. Hogwarts was such a magical place; it made everyone happier. A gentle knock pulled Harry from his thoughts, and he looked at the door to see Mrs. Malfoy.
Hagrid gulped before answering, "Er- well, it coulda been any vault, now!"
If only they stared back.
When Madame Hooch came back, Harry couldn't bring himself to even glance at Malfoy.
"You're coming home with me for Christmas- I'm no longer asking," Draco insisted.
"Try being assertive. I think it can tell if you're not entirely sure," Harry suggested, breath hitching when Ron whirled to glare at him.
he thought,
“Hagrid didn’t do anything illegal! I was with him the whole time!” Harry was too angry to notice that Draco knew his birthday.
“Oh, shut up
"No buts- we have plenty of space," Draco insisted.
A smile escaped Harry's lips, "Then why'd you do it?"
Harry beamed, "It's nothing."
(See the end of the chapter for
! Don't worry about it!"
friends- kept glaring at him from across the common room. And the third was that Harry's breathing was
"Yes, Professor Snape?" Draco seemed to be trying to feign innocence in the matter.
“Language!” Draco teased.
(See the end of the chapter for
And then his face began to hurt. It started at his cheeks, his near-constant grin using face muscles that he'd never used before. And then it flowed upwards, giving him a headache as he choked out laughter. The jokes had slowed by then, and Harry glanced around the hall. His eyes fell on Ron, smiling slightly as he saw the boy having fun. As he turned his gaze towards the front, a sharp, searing pain hit his forehead.
"What was that about?"
“Oh.”
Harry turned his head, "Wha-?"
Draco glared at him, “Anyways. Most came with a note. This one didn’t. Open it.”
Harry scarfed down his meal, excited for the adventure to come. Draco laughed, nudging him.
His father's eyes slowly traveled to meet his, "Is that so?"
"And why, exactly, is that any of our business?" Pansy asked unenthusiastically.
"Where does it say that?" Draco snapped.
"Thanks for having me, Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy."
"Hey! Wait a minute- where are we going?"
In a flash, potions flew by Harry's ink-splotched parchment filled with notes depicting potion class procedures and even a little eye he managed to draw with his quill. It was very messy, however, almost as if it was bleeding. As enjoyable as the class was, the cold stare drilling into the side of his head gnawed at his heart.
"Father!" He interrupted, "There's somebody I want you to meet."
Draco, pinning Zabini across the green-lit table, pummeling him over and over. Harry running to help, whether it was Draco or Zabini, he couldn't remember. God- had he helped Draco?
He moved to seize his glasses, grimacing when a pale hand beat him to it. He gazed at Draco, who smirked, “Every morning you grab them with your sweaty hands, smudge them up, and then spend at least 20 minutes trying to wash them without magic. Honestly, I’m tired of waiting.”
His father snatched the packaging away from him, “Dear Draco,” He read aloud, “I’m so happy that you and Ron could mend the rivalry between our two families! I’m sorry this isn’t much, but I promise that there will be further gifts. Love, Mrs. Weasley.”
"Keeper."
The broom threw itself into Ron's hold, and Harry grinned. He stood there waiting for the others to succeed and took the chance to examine his broom. It was primarily a dark brown, with speckles and flares of lighter colors adorning the length of it.
"Yeah..." Harry watched Draco's face for any sign that he knew what was up, "What is it?"
"Exactly," Draco grabbed Harry's wrist, making sure of the placement, before pulling him out of the crowd exiting the Quidditch stands.
His father frowned, “It’s Christmas. Open it.”
"I am not a troll, Potter!"
"Seeker doesn't require much- you only have one task for the entirety of the match!" Ron fumed.
Draco yawned, and the boys trudged up the stairs before collapsing onto their sheets.
"Excuse me, Malfoy?"
"Well, your
"Be an absolute jerk."
Harry blinked his eyes open, a dull throbbing pulsing through the right side of his jaw. All he could see was white, and he panicked. Was this heaven? Was Harry dead?! He blinked once more, little lines once invisible coming into focus. The hospital wing. He lifted his head, immediately dropping it back down onto the pillow. Why was he here? Did he slip in the dungeons again?
“The groundskeeper,” Harry explained, “He’s my friend.”
“Well, go on, then. Open it, Draco,” His father insisted.
"Wh- how do you know that?"
"Amazing, innit?" The half-giant grunted as he placed the tree, "You should look across the room; it's even better!"
But the blonde was already standing, heading towards the boy with the ball. Harry scrambled after him, nearly tripping over the bench he had been sitting on. He stumbled and ran to catch up with him as Draco approached the boy.
"Huh?"
Btw, that was contour. Draco's gotta keep his cheekbones sharp.
"Why? Are you that excited to do Potions homework?" Draco mumbled.
When the time had come, Harry was hurrying Draco as he watched him smearing hair gel in. Once he finally emerged from his nest of gel, Harry rushed him out of the dorms.
Harry could hardly believe what was happening. He went from an ordinary scrawny orphan kid to a famous magical skinny orphan kid overnight. And to think it all started from a letter. He had gotten used to kids avoiding him, wanting nothing to do with him, so when the ginger boy from the large family that had helped him sat in the same train carriage as him, he wasn't too sure what to do. He wasn't even sure what he did; all Harry knew was that he had a friend now: Ron Weasley.
"It didn't cross my mind, to be honest." Draco seemed to shrink into his seat.
Harry couldn't find Draco in the Great Hall during breakfast, and he wondered if Draco hated him for something. He quickly brushed it off, finding that there was no foundation for this theory. Harry grabbed a slice of toast before hurrying out of the Hall, hoping to find Draco.
big!" Ron interrupted.
She giggled softly, "It's okay, Harry. I told you to make yourself at home; you don't have to be so polite."
"What do you mean,
It was almost the end of term, the winter holiday quickly approaching. The air had gone from crisp and cold to sharp and freezing, causing the dungeons that the Slytherins resided in to be nearly unbearable. Harry was used to sleeping in the cold, though. At the Dursleys, he only had a thin blanket to protect himself from the weather, and there was no heating in the cupboard. Harry had yet to experience a winter in Dudley's second bedroom but suspected that it would be cold there too. Either way, the cold didn't bother him all that much, but it bothered Draco, so Harry decided to sneak one of his blankets onto Draco's bed, knowing that if he offered it, Draco would vehemently deny it. Draco looked peaceful when he was sleeping, his usual scowl softening and his ungelled hair falling into the crevice of his eye socket.
." Harry corrected
”I'm sorry that you can't trust me enough to talk to me rather than avoiding me.”
"Filch," They both breathed.
? That's the most boring role of them all!" Draco sneered.
Draco ignores them all and barely gets Harion to his bed before the younger boy collapses into the sheets like dead weight. His entire boy curls forward into the smallest, tightest ball possible. Draco had been angry at being brushed off for so long but all of that evaporated upon seeing the hollowness of the other boy. Draco had seen this plenty of times in their younger years together. Harion was easily pushed too far back then. He trusted little and always thought the worst of any situation.
“Yes, yes, I know dear.” Narcissa grins vibrantly. She steps lithely around a pile of books on the floor and tiptoes up to press a warm kiss to the corner of her husband’s lips. Bellatrix wonders idly for a moment if she would have lived I such domestic bliss had it not been for someone meddling in her mind. The thought pains her. “Thank you, Lucius. Really. It means a lot to me.”
Harion watches as the great beast tilts its head as if in wonder before tucking itself calming around him. He feels the softness of the serpent’s scales rub against his hand as the creature moves.
Sirius looks between the two women for a few long moments before leaning back in his chair. “No. Not biologically.” Sirius pauses to collect his thoughts and Bellatrix lets him, knowing that he was trying to figure out what to say without outright giving up their many secrets. “James had never helped to conceive a child. However, he and I both have an heir and son.”
“Yes, mother.”
“It was not an expected breakthrough, at least not for a few more months to a year at least.” Bellatrix takes a careful sip of her tea and clears her throat still unsure of what exactly her sister would know. Of what little she remembered of their early lives together, Bellatrix had always kept things a little tighter to her chest than Narcissa and Andromeda had. She had apparently kept this secret very close to her chest because the man involved was five years her junior almost. “I remembered something from early on. You and Lucius were only a year or two into your bonding. Do you remember that I had been arranged to be bonded to someone around that time?”
“Does he know where these Horcruxes are located?” Severus may not like Albus but Horcruxes were incredibly dark magic and could have lasting consequences if a student stumbles across them. “I’d rather a student didn’t accidentally come across them. I may also be able to gather them and bring them here. I’d rather not give them directly to him if I don’t have to. I still don’t entirely trust him.”
“No.”
The dark slope lights rapidly and a set of stairs descend into the dim light. Harion steps into the depths with ease. There were cobwebs that he clears away with a wave of his wand. “
“I’ve found, Severus, that the only way to show Harion that you are serious about your devotion to him is to actively become involved in his life. If you show interest or effort he will eventually come around. Perhaps...you would care to join us for Yule? You needn’t stay if you would prefer your own home but you are welcome to our dinner and our morning with Narcissa and Lucius.”
If you have any questions please don't hesitate to comment. Harry will eventually go through piecing information about his family together while figuring out what happened the night his mother and James Potter died and his grandfather turned into a waif. It may all seem to be a jumbled mess right now but that was meant to happen. Harry is just now hearing all this information.
“Aren’t you two related?”
Thank you for your understanding and I hope that we will be able to create more amazing HP fanfics in the future!!!
Draco tugs on his boots with ease and grabs both of their cloaks from his trunk. It wasn’t often that they talked about Harion of his past in this kind of relation. Draco understood better than anyone else that it was a touchy subject and one Harion would have rather stayed far away from. “I suppose so. Even so, as simply the scion of House Black, people may have thought it weird that we are to be bonded even second cousin bonding contracts are uncommon now.” Draco rolls his eyes as Harry shrugs on his outer robes. He wasn’t wrong, of course, but that didn’t mean Draco thought that their bonding contract was weird.
“He’ll go and get her just for that,” Blaise says to placate Theo. Harry rubs a hand up and down his back nodding along with Blaise. Blaise turns toward Draco and raises an eyebrow questioningly. “Why did you claim her as a snake in the lion’s den? What does that even mean?”
Narcissa stares at Bellatrix for a long moment. She takes in everything that Bellatrix had told her and compartmentalizes the information. Her eyes narrow sharply and Narcissa holds a slender finger up as if she’s recounting something or going over the information again. It did not take the other woman much longer the figure out what Bellatrix had been battling with all day. “Are you implying what I believe you are implying?” Bellatrix nods shortly because she didn’t dare speak it aloud for fear that it would send her entire world to the ground. “If that is the case, and you don’t believe he had relations outside of your bonding contract, then we may need to visit the goblins.”
“Now, now children…we wouldn’t be fighting in the corridor, now would we? I presume you know everything about Death Eaters to be tossing that term about so easily, Mr. Weasley?” Harry feels a long chill go down his spine as the slow drawl that their head of house uses and pulls Draco half a step back to stand in line with him once more. “Or are you all really so stupid that you would purposely fight in the halls? In which case house points would likely be deducted.”
“You can always owl it to me right?”
“Do you think he and Lily figured everything out?” Narcissa frowns softly and rubs at her temple. “Does it much matter if we can’t speak to them in the afterlife? There really isn’t anyone else close to them that we could speak to who would trust us enough to speak to us.”
They both fall silent even if they did not come to a verbal conclusion. They’d known one another for so long that it was hardly a matter of verbalization any longer. Their eyes both turn toward the door as a knock sounds on it and a bushy haired girl peeks her head in.
“Perhaps Lupin knows something more than Sirius does or can help up free him.”
James had written to her near the end of his seventh year at Hogwarts about he and Sirius decided to rebel a bit and get tattoos the muggle way. Remus Lupin, their friend who had grown up in the muggle world, had taken them into muggle London for the first time ever and they’d managed to get themselves tattooed. It was a simple design comprising a set of lines to make up a dog. James’s tattoo was a similar design making up the form of a stag. They’d both been Animagus since their fourth year.
Dray latches onto his hand and tugs him toward the train while waving excitedly back at his parents who are watching on in trepidation. The train is larger than it appears and there are students milling about excitedly talking with one another and trying desperately to find good seats before the train departs. By some stroke of luck, the pair of them end up finding an empty compartment near the back of the train and settling in alongside one another with their uniforms and wands.
It is nearly eleven when the portrait door opens and their head of house steps through the opening and into the room. Their head of house is limping slightly and there are some blood stains on his leg, but he looks to be healed already so they all breathe a sigh of relief. His dark eyes swing around the room to take a quick head count of his snakes to ensure that they were all present and accounted for.
“My mother is Bellatrix Black, sir.”
Harry storms out of Dumbledore’s office, well quickly walks because Lords certainly do not throw temper tantrums, and into the dungeons. Every person he passes gives him a wide berth and whisper in surprise when he passes. How dare that crazy old man hint at what he did. Harry would kill every person in this castle before he let his mother go to Azkaban or the Janus Thickey Ward. Hell, he’d rather go in her stead. He’d suffered abuse enough that he could handle dementors or curses. He’d die before she was sent to either place.
Harion nods and wraps a hand lightly around the wavering vision of a man. “Will you be old if we bring you back to life…like ancient?” Marvolo pulls away and rolls his eyes.
The table falls silent and Harry cannot help but to continuously watch as Theo glances toward the doors again and again. He almost felt bad for his year-mate who obviously was worried for the young girl that none of them had really met before. Harry wondered vaguely if Theodore had befriended the young lioness and that was why he was so worried about her wellbeing.
