,” Draco couldn’t finish. Panic was a tight band around his chest, squeezing harder by the moment, crawling up this throat like a burning hand. He put the phone down on the coffee table, too hard. He wanted a sip of water, but his hands were shaking too much.
Hard muscle, solid from keeping up his Auror workouts, but not brutally shredded like he had once been when racing on foot through dark alleyways had been his day job. A slight softness - he liked the feel of it under his fingertips. Dark hair on his lower belly. Firm chest. Tight nipples, which tightened even further as he touched each of them in turn. He cupped his left pec, and squeezed. Decent tits.
Harry hadn’t quite found his voice, and so he tore the page with those names from his notepad and pushed it over to Malfoy. He picked it up and hummed again, then retrieved a Muggle mobile phone from the inner pocket of his robe.
“Go home, you both look exhausted. Thank you for coming, boys. You did a wonderful job of distracting him.”
Potter’s lips were already on Draco’s throat, and he rolled over and settled again between Draco’s thighs, which opened for him without hesitation. “I can think of one or two things,” Potter said, and Draco made a noise he would absolutely deny knowledge of later, and lost himself in Potter’s mouth once again.
She nodded, and Draco set about taking the sample and explaining what would happen next, while Potter took inventory of the owls, and sent a Patronus back to the Ministry. Before long, several Aurors and all of the Owl Keepers arrived to begin the monumental task of getting the owls safely back to the Ministry. Then Draco and Potter brought her in.
Malfoy’s shoulders tighten, and he turns back to Ted, pushing the veggies around with the ducky spoon distractedly. “Oh.”
“How dare you,” Draco said. “If I had a hair out of place, I’d know about it.” Potter threw back his head and laughed, and Draco wondered what other people were thinking, if they were looking at them, if people had noticed that Harry Potter was all but holding Draco’s hand, in front of a sculpted ice centrepiece with a giant frozen cock on it instead of a dolphin’s beak.
“Fine.” Potter clenched his jaw, and started taking things from his pockets. Keys, a mobile, a packet of cigarettes all tossed onto the coffee table. “Let’s start with your outfit. Did Seamus put you up to it?”
“Harry, I’ve told you a thousand times, we’ll get an elf service. We’ll get a whole team of them, they’ll dust and mop this place within an inch of its life, and we’ll spend a small fortune updating the bedding and linen, and the mattresses too, I’d imagine, and keep the windows open the whole week in the lead up so everything will be fresh and clean. I’ll order flowers in for all the rooms too, and some posh soaps. You love posh soaps.”
Potter looked down at the files in his arms, then up at the cloud of memos. “I feel like I’ve walked into some sort of elaborate trap.”
hesitant. Perhaps that had started as a prudent approach, following the break up with Ginny and the absolute media circus that had come with the announcement that they were over. Not that it was an announcement as such, more of a strategically placed comment in an article in the
and Draco didn’t stop until he was pushing in, too hard, too tight. Potter arched his back, snapped his hips up to meet him. He was so tight, so hot, Draco was coming too fast, he didn’t want it to be over. Potter’s eyes were bright and green, and wide open, and Draco was coming hard. Potter jerked himself hard between their bellies and when he came he called him
“And Auntie will want to stay as well, so they can spend as much time as possible together. Plus, you know what they’re both like. Two glasses of champagne, and they’ll be collapsed on the nearest upholstered surface together, weeping about how much they love each other.” Draco snorted, as if he wasn’t as much of a lightweight as they were. “We can probably put them in a twin room and save a little space. And Tedward, of course, he’ll need his usual.”
Harry swallowed hard. “Very smart. I’m scruffy,” Harry laughed ruefully and shoved his hand through his hair again. “I feel a bit under-dressed actually.”
This time was after a field assignment that had gone completely shit shaped. Being in Potions, his fieldwork was very rarely dangerous, these days, but Draco was still as well trained and deadly as any other Auror in the Corps. It had only been two years since he’d transferred from Field, anyway, and so when a routine collection of samples from a crime scene, which had apparently been secured earlier in the day, turned abruptly into a wandfight, he’d been able to hold his own. He’d been squatting, examining a spill of something thick and iridescent, with Weasley hunched beside him, and the crackle of magic had him looking sharply up as a hex rocketed past him and caught Weasley in the chest. He went down with a thump, and Draco managed a Shield charm and a healing stabiliser in rapid order, before he got his Patronus off to Robards, and focussed on defending himself from an onslaught of curses.
“I have to go,” Draco moved towards the fireplace again. The room was getting blurry. “I can’t process this right now.”
Harry nodded and cleared his throat. “I’ll get you a drink, and then I’ll pop upstairs for a quick tidy.”
ago to stop her meddling in his business.” Weasley chuckled. “So if she wants to get involved, she has to do it via you.”
Half-nine in the Department of Magical Games and Sport had never been so quiet. Draco had agonised over the decision to hold the gala on a Thursday night, but in the end the unusually heavy schedule of fundraisers, festivals and balls that month made the decision for him. As a result, Draco had given the department staff the following day off – there was a high probability of absenteeism due to hangovers anyway, and anyone who did show up would probably have wasted most of the day with gala-related gossip. At least this way, he could score a few points with his people, and minimise discussion of any impromptu swimming by senior staff, and certainly no scuttlebutt about any other department managers who may or may not have been almost holding hands. Plus, Scrivener was almost guaranteed to call in sick anyway, so there was really no reason for anybody to make an appearance on Friday.
Although. Technically, Potter had the upper hand in this situation; he had been much more inebriated than Draco, and could therefore excuse his overly friendly behaviour quite easily. Draco had hardly been pissed at all, and had still gone along with it, so this was rather more embarrassing for him. Actually, the more Draco thought about it, the less absurd hiding from Potter seemed, after all.
“Are they really dirty tricks when we both enjoy it so much?” He slid further in, slowly, gently. “I think it should be one hundred points to Gryffindor, actually.”
“I could remind you,” Potter said, and his voice licked up Draco’s spine like a flame. “You seem like you have time right now.”
He spooned out some pasta onto both of their plates, and with another smile, took his own bite. His eyebrows climbed. “Fuck, Potter, this is incredible. How have you been keeping this from me for all these years?
It was getting to the stage where his glass was sticky with fingerprints, and Draco should just give in and drink the disgusting thing, or abandon it for something more to his taste. He grit his teeth, then threw the shot back. It fucking
“Harden up, Bujalski.” Ron was remorseless. “Last, and by no means least, if I can get Anders' pants off, maybe I can remove the stick up his arse while I’m at it!”
“I’m done with the 2782. I’ll pull the personnel file from HR and request any incident reports from the overnight guard.” He jotted down the name from Potter’s notes, and set the various documents off through the memo service. Draco cast a Tempus. “I’d estimate we have at least a half hour before we’re going to get a response for those. I should let Weasley know where we’re up to.”
“Good,” Harry said roughly. “They were going to find out anyway when we lodge our paperwork, anyway.” He tightened his arms, and kissed Draco on the shoulder. “Alright?”
Teddy looked small in the gurney, even though he was eleven, and due to go to Hogwarts in just a few months. When he saw Harry and Malfoy pull back the privacy screen, he burst into tears, and Harry was crouched low beside his bed a moment later.
“Seamus fully bolted up to the dorm, and Harry realised what he was doing and went after him, and we could hear shouting and things being knocked about, but then we heard Seamus absolutely hollering and sure enough he’d had a crack at Summoning that little album and it’d slid right out from under Harry’s pillow. We gave him
Orange Singlet hooked a finger in a belt loop at the front of Harry’s jeans, and tugged him forward, out of Malfoy’s reassuring grip and almost against his neon-clad chest. “Hi. I’m Paul. And you’re gorgeous.”
“Don’t call her Jesus, Malfoy, she’ll only get a big head.” Ron squeezed past Draco to get to a seat on the other side of his sister. “The way she’s going, the Harpies will have to bench her, ‘cos she won’t be able to keep her broom in the air.” He looked at Draco, and then his sister, and shoved his hand into the box of Pepper Imps. “You know, because of the weight of her giant head.”
Draco shook his head. He shut his eyes and pretended he hadn’t seen Theo exchange a look of concern with Blaise over his shoulder, and instead focussed on the feel of them boxing him in with their bodies, and the thrum of the music all around them. He wished Greg was here, but Greg had fucked off to Canada years ago, and wasn’t around to be Draco’s protector anymore.
“Yessss,” Draco moaned. “I mean, no! God, Harry, you know what I want,” Draco’s breath stuttered as Potter’s fingers skimmed his prick. “Just give it to me.”
There was a very particular set of sensations which always accompanied a visit to the Burrow. There was the ever present smell of something cooking, and a delicious sort of warmth to the air no matter what the weather was outside. The chairs always felt more comfortable there, squashier, softer, like well-worn tracksuit bottoms. And the inevitable feeling that followed eating far too much, a sleepy contentment that made it possible to ignore how tight the waistband of your trousers had become. Ron wasn’t even pretending to put on airs; his shirt was entirely untucked, with a noticeable drip of gravy on the front, and Harry could only thank the hem of it for saving him from the sight of Ron’s now unbuttoned jeans, and pale, distended belly. Nothing could save any of them from Ron’s belching, however, which he was blaming unconvincingly on the local bullfrog population.
Potter let his eyes drift down Draco’s body like fingertips. His drew his wand from his thigh holster, and gestured with it. “Turn around, you lush. Healing first, flirting later.” Draco turned the water off and braced himself again against the tile, and Potter’s magic collided with his back a moment later. He made a noise, it was punched out of him rather than anything voluntary, and the pain coalesced before fading to a low thrum.
“Cleaning,” Harry murmured into the corner of Draco’s mouth. “I do want the party, and I want to show you off to all our friends and family,” a kiss, another, just one more, “but I’m not looking forward to cleaning this place up.”
“What-” he said, disoriented. His wand was in his hand, but so were several feathers, and it seemed in his semi-conscious state he’d reflexively snatched his wand from under his pillow, and ripped directly through the linen slip in the process.
Draco, bless his cunning and perfectly shaped backside, had also worked out the best way to get Harry-related admin done. This was something he’d figured out in their early days as Aurors, although these days his methods were far more intimate. The key was to make sure Harry was immobilised - getting his hair cut at the barbers, being measured for robes, or, stirring a fussy risotto - and strike. Equally as important was not giving Harry too many choices to pick from. This tactic was a proven winner. Draco already knew virtually all of Harry’s preferences, so he came prepared with simple decisions like midnight blue metallic or classic black for the exterior, and cream leather or grey for the interior, and two bedrooms with ensuite and downstairs loo, or three bedrooms and a family bathroom.
“Absolutely not,” Draco said, with such venom that Harry nearly expected to see fangs emerge from between his thinned lips. “I don’t want any more of your former lovers in our house.”
“You’re not being sensible, you’re being a knob.” Harry was beginning to regret making his famous pasta salad, if this was the thanks he was going to get. “Think of it like this: imagine if Hermione and me split up. Would you tell us we’d’ve been better off never even trying?”
Ron was attempting to stuff a second slice of toast into his mouth, which was still full of the previous slice. “Why? What?”
my wife saw my best mates cock, but I suppose she wasn’t my wife at the time, so I don’t have much of a leg to stand on.”
He smiled against Harry’s throat. “No. We agreed that this was going to be about looking, and so that’s what it’s going to be about.”
, dipped it in the delicate buttery sauce, and carefully lifted it to Draco’s lips, where he took it from the fork with a rasp of sharp teeth along the tines. They sat like that, Draco hot in Harry’s lap and chewing with slow deliberation, and Harry watching his mouth raptly, until Draco was done, and Harry could drag him down for a kiss that turned immediately filthy. His mouth tasted of thyme, cream and pepper, and Australian shiraz.
Longbottom carried his share, and they stacked the gear and samples carefully in the cabin with some Cushioning charms for good measure. Draco lifted his arms and stretched, feeling his spine pop. Longbottom snapped another picture, and Draco yanked his jumper down where it had risen, and flipped him off.
Malfoy was just slightly below him, standing on the first step of the stairs. He gave Harry a small smile, and still seemed to be amused, rather than offended. “We haven’t been those boys in a long time, Potter. I’m sure I’ve never said this and I’ll probably deny it if asked, but I respect you. Seeing you in the state you were in last week brought back some unpleasant memories of my own coming out and I wish I’d had someone to tell me I wasn’t a freak. That it was okay not to be sure. That taking your time and waiting til you’re ready is perfectly sensible. That there’s no rush.”
Draco opened his mouth, then closed it again. Well. He hadn’t expected Potter to be quite so willing to cooperate. Draco cleared his throat. “Frankly, at first I thought you were doing it on purpose, just to frustrate me.”
two bogus or unimportant ones, no need to get too creative with your lies, as he’s probably not really listening to you anyway. No reports, memos or notes of any kind are to be posted on unlined parchment – blank paper makes him very, very angry. Are there any questions?”
Harry bit the inside of his lip. “Yes. The cause seems to be, er, a cursed dildo.” He pursed his lips, and poised his quill. “The original dildo was Muggle in origin and is only stocked in a limited number of establishments in England, including yours.”
Just the thought of that made Harry’s stomach churn. “No, I’ll do it.” He couldn’t have elves rummaging through his stuff. They wouldn’t know where everything was supposed to go, they might not know what was rubbish and what was meaningful. They’d package things up and he’d never find them again, or Merlin forbid, they might throw things out. Worst of all, they might give away to Draco that-
A short time later, Harry wiped his hand on the drop sheet, and pressed a possessive kiss behind Draco’s ear. “Bet Alain never made you come like that.”
“I’m having a breakdown, and I need a phone as soon as, because I need to get some information from Longbottom about photos of me he sent to Potter.”
He stared out the window of the van at the first rays of sun in the breaking dawn, and daydreamed about hash browns and orange juice, and how much better plum jam tasted when it was licked from between Draco's arsecheeks.
“If you could try and smooth things over with the Ambassador?” Potter nodded. Two of the burlier waiters were hauling Scrivener out of the tank by the underarms. He was getting shouty.
“I know what it means,” Cabbage Head looked at him, squinting. “So why are you catting around pubs searching for a lookalike? Why don’t you just go straight for the source?”
“Let’s decorate first,” Malfoy said. “But I’ve got something to put in your fridge, if that’s okay.”
Draco turned his head just enough to look over his shoulder, and winced when his whole left side cramped in objection. “How’s Ron?”
If he’s being honest, he wants to call Malfoy, but as much as Harry wants to, he also feels skittish and nervous when he thinks of it. He hasn’t liked anyone in such a long time. He never had to do all this with Ginny; they already liked each other as friends, knew each other for years, had grown up together. When they first started seeing each other it felt so natural, from the moment they kissed in the Gryffindor common room, and then when she’d taken his hand again for the first time after the War, and kissed the tips of his fingers and pressed his palm to her face... Malfoy was going to be different. Not the innocent blossoming romance he’d had with Gin. This was going to be molten hot and probably filled with the itch of agitation between them that they’d always had, rivalry and irritation and two lives lived as differently as they probably could have been; it was going to be exciting, and like nothing else Harry had done before, and Harry felt restless, and ready, and unbelievably
Harry shook his head. “Mungo’s told me not to when I was being discharged, and I got the distinct impression things could get pretty messy if I didn’t comply.”
“Can we please re-focus back to the matter at hand, which is that apparently you’ve all been running a book on my bloody love life since before I had hair on my nads.”
The sounds of the pub came upon him suddenly, as if switched on. A Muggle place, free of wizarding journalists, dark and fairly quiet aside from the low murmur of conversation, and the chink of cutlery on plates. He looked down at his own plate - roast lamb, and red wine gravy. Mashed potatoes on the side, creamy white mounds, and a pile of fat, green peas nestled beside it. He went to pick up his fork, and found it already in his hand.
“Let me see if I can split you into quarters, then!” And Draco just laughed at him again. “I hate your Fellowship,” Harry said, only exaggerating a little. “How long again until you’re finished?”
Draco sucked on Potter’s neck, and pulled his shirt out of its neat tuck in his trouser waistband. “No, I’m clean, very, very clean. That’s the point.”
“I’m having a creepy thought,” Ginny’s eyes are fixed on Teddy. “That this is what our children would look like.”
“I love you,” Draco whispered into his ear, and Harry was melting hot, and gasped that he was going to come, and Draco said it again, “I love you, Harry,” and that was how he finished, spilling, bucking hard and without grace.
Potter smiled up at his godson. “Hey Ted, would it be alright if I had a talk with your big cousin for a little bit?”
“Okay, boys,” Hermione’s voice was soothing, and she moved from the settee to sit on the arm of Harry’s chair, patting him gently on the shoulder. “I’m calling time on this one before things get out of hand. Harry, you’ve got that look in your eyes.”
“Harry we have no issue with anyone you decide to see. You're an adult and you make your own decisions. You know what's right for you.” Hermione’s hand was warm and reassuring on his wrist again. Harry dragged the tines of his fork through the mess of beans and egg on his plate.
“Like them - Harry, this stuff, it's incredible.” He held a Fendi satchel in his hands. “I’m fucking furious with you!”
“Yes,” the kid gasped, and Draco nudged him none too gently towards Potter. He stumbled, and Potter automatically reached out to catch the kid by the elbow, and Draco took his moment to exit sharply into the throng of clubbers pressed around them. He forced his way to the dance floor, caught Blaise by the elbow and dragged him, and by extension Theo, deeper into the crush of bodies. To his relief, they followed him willingly and without question.
“Shush,” Theo held up one hand, and took a long sip of his own coffee. “Zabini, in this family we give if we expect to receive, and Malfoy, stop avoiding the subject. You want help, you explain what’s going on, otherwise I’m going back to bed.”
She nodded, flicking back her hair and straightening on towering heels. “Mmmhmm, sure - Weasley, fancy seeing your plain mug here. The tit fairy hasn’t been to visit yet, I see?”
“Not to me, I like them both.” Potter nudged Draco’s knees with his own, and Draco spread his legs further apart, and curved his spine, opening himself to Potter. He took Draco’s earlobe between his lips and teased it with sharp nips of his teeth, and Potter pressed one hand to the swell of Draco’s arse and traced a thumb over Draco’s entrance; his cock had left a generous smear of wetness on Draco’s skin, which Potter now circled his thumb through, pressing in gently and steadily until he breached him. Draco had only been exaggerating slightly; they had fucked, slowly and lazily, earlier that morning, but Draco was in no mood for slow now. He wanted to feel it, rough and quick. Potter seemed inclined to indulge him, twisting his thumb with quick efficiency but only working Draco just enough, just enough to make it work, to make it feel good, to bring Draco to the edge of rough, and too rough.
Hermione coughed, and Ginny’s eyebrows threatened to make a break for her hairline. “Ouff. Shots fired.”
The effect was almost hypnotic. It was like watching the gently beckoning tentacles of a sea anemone, each cock around seven inches in length and a translucent purple, which only enhanced the overall impression that this thing was some sort of deep sea-dwelling creature. Harry only realised he had reached out to touch the nearest appendage when he registered the temperature of it under his fingertips: it was warm, which he had not expected. In fact he would estimate it to be about right for human body temperature, and his fingers seemed quite naturally inclined to curl around the shaft of it and gently squeeze.
Draco pushed his hair out of his face. It was still sticky from Ted’s hands, and knotty. Which meant it had probably been standing on end while he was at Potter’s,
Potter’s face was very close. He could smell the tea on his breath. “I – it’s a conflict of interest...workplace affairs are against the rules-”
“I’m telling you, Ron – keep it simple. Take her somewhere nice for dinner, and then a night at a nice hotel. And the Leaky does not count for either of those. Get her some flowers, she likes roses, right?”
it, before Conjuring a fresh, hot cup of Darjeeling. He handed it to Harry before Conjuring a teacup of his own, and filling it with what smelled like a white Jasmine tea. He let Harry sip for a few moments in silence, watching him shrewdly over the top of his cup.
“Trent,” he said breathlessly. Draco smiled, and this time Potter seemed to see his teeth, and his posture tensed.
By the time the briefing with Ron was scheduled, Harry had made far less progress than he had hoped for. The cuttings had not sprouted. The various samples had mainly showed only what Harry supposed they ought: that they were made from polyvinyl chloride and bore the hallmarks of some sort of magical intervention, although what that was specifically was still unclear. The objects themselves had not been manufactured with it – they were definitely Muggle, down to the slight ridges from the original mould along the length of it. The spellwork was very subtle and would need further investigation, which was the most disappointing part for Harry, as he’d be fervently hoping it would turn out to be something obvious and easily identifiable, so he could skip straight on to the tracking.
Potter scratched the back of his neck, sheepish. “I suppose you wouldn't believe it came with the phone.”
the good reason you think it is!” She was beginning to look really annoyed with Draco. The last time she’d had that look about her, he’d received a fist to the face not long after. “You seem so sure that Harry’s destined for some conventional, chocolate box future, but you don’t even know if he wants any of that!”
Ron howled through another overstuffed mouthful, and Harry finally came back to the present, laughing. “There he is,” Ginny said with a grin. “I was starting to worry that you’d disappeared in there.”
“Scrivenation, the art of predicting the mood of Undersecretary Scrivener based on patterns of behaviour, such as wardrobe, choice of morning beverage, and whether or not there’s a staff meeting scheduled. It’s actually quite a bit more accurate than its magical cousin, Divination.” Wedderburn made a noise like a besotted sheep, and Malfoy shushed him.
“I don’t think that’s a good idea.” Draco leaned away from him slightly, and just looked, one eyebrow raised. “It’s the worst one. You think you’ve seen everything, but that room is basically worse than everything else combined. It’s much more than we can handle tonight, especially since you have to go back to Hogwarts in the morning.”
When it was Malfoy’s round, he came back with three fresh jugs of lager, but he also came with several bowls of hot and crunchy sweet potato fries, with little pots of golden aioli beside them. Two bowls settled themselves between the jugs at the far end, clearly spaced to share, but the last landed directly in front of Harry.
it when he had to go away. Knowing that Draco would be there, in their flat, all alone, eating a bowl of cold, soggy cereal for his morning meal. Probably pouting sadly to himself. Draco loved breakfast too, mostly because Harry made it for him, and took so much care in preparing it, wanting him to start his day in the best way possible. Draco would lie-in most mornings, as long as possible, and would shuffle into the kitchen, usually nude, when he could hear the clink of cutlery being nudged aside by plates as they were set on the table. Draco smelled so good in the mornings, so warm and sweet, and his hair was all tangled and fluffy, and his eyes were all sleepy and round. It was mushy, Harry knew it was, and he'd never admit it to any of his friends, but sometimes he liked Draco to sit warm and naked and directly in his lap to eat breakfast, so that he could feed little bites of toast with apricot jam to him, or a segment of orange, or a moist piece of muffin. And they would talk idly about what they were doing today, and what needed to be added to the grocery list, and whose turn it was to renew the wards on their flat. Draco would yawn widely and then stretch, and every toned plane of muscle would shift under his velvety skin. They would also usually end up fucking, torturously slowly, on those days that Draco ate breakfast from his seat on Harry's lap. The milk and juice jugs would wobble and splash, as would the tea pot, while Draco rode Harry right there on the kitchen chair.
Draco blinked at her, ironically still stuck on fanny. “I’m speaking to Potter a normal amount, for colleagues who work in different departments.”
He turned away from the lewd display now spread on his duvet and quickly searched for the number for Throb on his mobile. Darling, the door bitch (that’s what Malfoy’d called her, Harry thought guiltily) answered sweetly even though it was only three in the afternoon.
, right? And that-” Harry repeated the process with a purplish wave, positioning it on a new row right below the blue. “-that’s the
Harry quickly settled his bill, after ordering the jugs of beer he’d come to get in the first place, and sending them over to the table with a flick of his wrist. “Excuse me,” he caught the attention of a bartender, who stopped short and blinked in surprise when she clocked his scar. “Can we use your staff Floo? It’s an emergency.” He didn’t say it was Auror business, but he let it be implied, and the bartender seemed happy to oblige Harry Potter.
Potter took off his glasses, and rubbed his eyes. “Okay. So there are several things I want to address here. Firstly, why are you saying ‘canoe’ so often? Secondly, I’m sure you cope well enough with the green, considering how well you managed being all but smothered in it in Slytherin house for all those years in school, and don’t pretend you don’t know very well that it suits you. And third, doesn’t Scrivener understand that my risk reports are just recommendations for improvements? I mean, nearly all of the problems I identify with any given proposal can be easily rectified with a few amendments. In fact, the only proposal I’ve opposed outright in recent memory was the reinstatement of the Tri-Wizard Tournament, which in hindsight sounds a lot like it might have been one of your dummy suggestions to use up one of the Undersecretary’s two ‘no’s...”
He pulled back just far enough for Draco to see that sly grin again, with a hint of dimple. Ouff. “You, probably.” Draco smiled. Perhaps his holidays were off to a promising start after all.
Potter was leaning on the bar with one elbow now, his body entirely turned towards Draco, who was stubbornly refusing to mirror his pose. He wasn’t going to undo all of his hard work over the past five weeks in one night. Not when it had felt like dying about two thirds of the time.
The silence went on for so long that Harry nearly gasped with relief when it finally broke. “I’m going to need a bit more information.” Draco looked at the hallway around them. Piles of stuff spilled over into other piles of more stuff, with even more tumbling out of cupboards and drawers, and from shelves, and under a pair of twin beds in the room opposite.
Harry sighed at the cork board in his lab, now covered in parchment and notes. He was stuck, really, waiting for news on Fanny Ballhatchet of Cockfosters, and honestly he’d exhausted all of his ideas.
“Is my virtue safe?” Potter asked, amused, and Draco pretended he didn’t feel the flush of embarrassment creeping up his throat.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Get out of my office.” Potter backed out of the room, awkwardly juggling the files and ducking away from the more aggressive memos. “Thank you!” Draco called after him, before closing his door and locking it with a wave of his wand. He fully intended to take complete advantage of this opportunity, effective immediately. He pulled the Quodpot contract closer, and frowned, crossing out several lines and re-writing them.
"Vicky!" Harry said grumpily, stomping out of the lab and slamming the door shut behind him. He very nearly threw the dissection report across the tiny foyer and out into the Level Two corridor, but managed to hold onto the rapidly scrunching parchment with the last of his forbearance. "I need some time to think about this case. Can you please hold my owls for the rest of the afternoon, and I don't want to be disturbed unless it's the Minister." He paused at his office door. "Actually, I have an appointment at a quarter to five, so please let me know when he's arrived. But other than that, I'm bloody offline!"
“Annoying Ministry Weasley and wife, and offspring,” Draco said loudly over Harry’s snigger. “One-ear Weasley et al, Granger-Weasley’s, and Beard Weasley.”
Harry must have looked blank, because Malfoy’s mouth tightened in the smallest of smiles. “For tomorrow?”
“Neville’s moved into Malfoy’s room,” Ron said, later. He’d generously cooked a portion of bacon and tomato for Harry, who needed a bit of protein after the morning he’d so far had. “He looked a bit traumatised.”
The clock in the hall began to chime, and Harry swore. He really didn't have time for this. He pushed his hands roughly into his hair, and the mirror gasped.
Embarrassingly, forgot I hadn't finished posting this. One more bit to go, I'll try to keep the next update to less than one year.
“Not at all,” Blaise managed, though it looked like it might kill him. “Let’s set up some meetings for the next few weeks, and get Mungo’s that new wing.”
“The water thing, the fact that you’re some sort of Bermuda Triangle for self-inking quills, and I think we can both agree that coming back from the dead is pretty weird. Also, you have an unhealthy fixation on Homes Under The Hammer. I can never bloody find anything I’ve recorded on the Sky box, because it’s nothing but endless downloads of Homes Under The bloody Hammer!”
“Yeah, fuck Smith,” Harry said, with feeling. “He was the one who reported me for misconduct to Wix Resources back in ‘09!”
He squinted at it, but couldn’t see how it would possibly hold a bottle of wine, let alone more than one. “Can it go?”
He’d wondered many times what Potter was up to. His departure from the Aurors had occurred when Draco was barely through training and was a Junior sent to talk to old ladies feuding with neighbours over rose bushes, and all the crap jobs like filing and copying. Weasley never mentioned it, even when they became partners, and eventually became friendly. He did try to discreetly dig for information from time to time, even now that Weasley was promoted and was technically his boss, but the ginger git always gave him a certain look when he did, like he knew exactly what Draco was doing.
in Weasley’s infuriating voice. It was a mistake to have allowed Weasley to program the thing. When he was back from hols he planned to stuff the cursed device directly up the ginger git's arse.
“Thought you were doing roast lamb,” Harry said, following Ron down the hall of the flat to the kitchen.
“No, you did not.” Andromeda’s voice was stern, but Harry thought he could detect a little amusement, there. No doubt Tonks had got up to equally ridiculous shenanigans as a kid.
” she said loudly, and with great gusto, and Ron made more gagging noises that threatened to follow through. “Anyway, why aren’t you speaking to him anymore?”
Bog appeared in the lift, just as Draco was turning the lever to take them back down to Level 2. “Auror Malfoy.” Draco started and lurched right into Potter’s chest, his hands spreading across pleasantly firm pectorals.
That was one hundred percent Narcissa Malfoy, talking. “It’s not vulgar to talk about bodies, Ted. Bodies are normal and everyone has one, and all the parts we have are important. Hence, why Neville was keen not to be separated from any of his sooner than necessary.”
“That was an incredibly shit joke, you’re normally much better than that. Maybe I fucked the humour right out of you.” Harry pressed kisses to the top of Draco’s head, his hair a soft, slippery mess. “...You think I’m sexy.”
Harry squinted at the bathroom mirror. “Erm - pardon?” Something strange was happening to the glass. It was turning a sort of pink colour, and a fog of condensation was rapidly forming on the surface even though Harry’s shower had been hours and hours ago. There was no steam left in the bathroom to speak of. “Are you quite alright?”
God, he wanted Malfoy here, doing this to him, maybe with his long fingers smearing through the sticky wet on the slit of Harry’s cock. Maybe sucking softly on Harry’s nipple, then pulling on it hard with his teeth when Harry least expected. With shaking hands, he pressed the toy harder into himself, hard against his prostate, and thumbed the speed up a little higher. He wanted Malfoy kneeling between his thighs. He wanted to be held down by the hips with strong hands. Legs pressed apart, as far as he could. He wanted the blunt head of a hard cock to tease him, to breach just the rim and hold there while Harry sweated and trembled, and begged for another inch. He wanted Malfoy to fuck the breath out of him in long strokes, with his fingers knotted in the curls at the back of Harry’s neck, and he wanted Malfoy to
He reached out to touch the topmost toy with just the tip of one finger. It was cool and hard, a clear, glass-like dong that looked nothing much like a cock.
Harry concentrated. He could hear someone taking a piss. It was rather noisy, now Malfoy had pointed it out.
Malfoy told him stories about his travels through America with Narcissa over the rest of the sandwiches, and a substantial portion of salad, about how the magic in Louisiana was thick in the air like a living thing, but the humidity was even thicker; and how they’d taken the train Muggle-style, from New Orleans to Boston, and it hadn’t been at all what they’d expected, nothing like the Hogwarts Express at all; and the alien wonder of a flying carpet through the Nevada desert, the mad collection of Muggle buildings that made up Las Vegas appearing out of nowhere. When they were finished, and Harry’s stomach was fit to burst, and his face was a bit sore from smiling so hard, Malfoy got a bottle out of the fridge, and two small glasses that he told Harry were for serving an apéritif, although what they were drinking was more accurately a digestif. Then he poured them each an amber slosh of mandarincello, which he told Harry he’d
That really set them off, and Harry focussed on putting up some hasty soundproofing charms around their banquette, before the patrons on either side of them got any more annoyed about the noise than they were already. It was a good distraction from the horrible, plummeting sensation of completely irrational jealousy that had swooped through his belly at the thought of Malfoy checking out Ron.
The pitch was warded to the back teeth, and Potter had paced the sidelines with his wand drawn the entirety of each match. Teddy had probably never been safer in his short life. “See it? I squealed like a little baby crup.” He shook his head solemnly. “Very embarrassing for me. And I nearly had to change my pants!”
, Potter, this little so-called heatwave we’re having has nothing on a hot June day in Nola.” Malfoy gestured to Harry’s plate. “Try some. Tell me what you think.”
There were millions of men in London. Draco’d checked the census records once, when he was extra bored at work. There would have to be one hundred thousand of them, surely, that looked somewhat like Potter (statistically - he’d done the sums on another slow afternoon). And
Potter grinned, and Draco thought, not for the first time, that it was rather a terrific smile. “The plan is, we let Scrivener retire, I take up the Undersecretary job, and after two days I call a press conference and announce I’m retiring too, and name you my replacement.”
As it was, Harry didn’t remember his leather jacket was still at the nightclub until Sunday morning.
“Did I?” Ron said innocently. It was beans this morning, and the ever-present buttery toast. “What happened?”
In the bedroom, Potter lit the bedside lamps with a low, golden light. The bed, as always, was in disarray. “Shoes and shirt off, then on your stomach.” Potter was rolling up his shirtsleeves, and Draco unlaced his boots, set them carefully near the door, and unbuttoned his shirt. Potter watched him.
Potter looked down at him for a long moment. He gestured with his wand, dragged the ottoman over, and sat on it, arms folded once again and jaw set. “Why don’t you start by explaining what part pureblood tradition is playing in this mess.”
It turned out he fancied it well enough, and from his knees in the neon shadows of the club, it was easier to imagine his face contained Draco’s preferred colours and shapes. He didn’t even seem to mind that Draco didn’t reciprocate in kind, only pulled him off with cursory efficiency, before leaving him with a pat on the bum and a slightly bored “Thanks.”
Said bird slid onto the seat beside Draco, and grinned at him. Draco couldn’t help the way his own mouth twitched up at one corner in reply. “Weasley, where’s your better half this evening? I was hoping there’d be someone intelligent to talk to if I’m to be forced to spend time with the unwashed masses from Field.”
“Roger,” Harry agreed. Malfoy hoisted Roger’s bulky frame onto its front, the bollocks thunking gently as they moved.
Pansy insisted they go out to a club for once. It was true, they hadn’t done that in ages, but Draco was wallowing in his melancholia, and didn’t feel like watching them all feel up strangers, and probably each other, until the dawn hours. Anyway, he’d already declined Neville’s invitation to birthday drinks that weekend, and it seemed disloyal to go clubbing and
Clementine ginned and placed two glasses on the countertop, dropping a nearly perfectly round sphere of ice into each with steel tongs. “In the flesh. She’s not expected on the floor until after the DJ set has started but I’m sure she’ll find you.”
The spell analysis had come up with some unusual results. Despite the now heavy creasing inflicted on the parchment by his frustrated hands, he could still read the report. Harry groped absently along the carpet just under the divan, where he was sure he’d dropped a quill last week. The dissection seemed to be recognising at least some aspects of the Gemino curse, but the spell pattern wasn’t consistent with the proper form, and there was something else that was defying identification, all tangled amongst it. It made some sense – Harry had seen for himself how that particular curse could cause unstoppable replication of a cursed object, but aside from the fact that this was, indeed, an uncontrollable replication, the rest of the behaviour didn’t fit. The cocks didn’t double in response to touch; they’d grown as a bush after the original had been buried, for reasons so far unknown, and they subsequently seemed to respond only to attempts to be stopped. How did the rose bushes become part of the issue? Who the shitting hell cast this godforsaken curse anyway, and for what purpose?
That was a tricky one. On the one hand, it was his favourite mug. On the other, tea without proper china.
"Hermione says that the fact that you're cooperating, not fighting this at all, is in your favour. And my opinion does count for something around here, you know."
“Malfoy, thanks for coming,” Harry gestured for Malfoy to come over to the whiteboard. “I was really impressed with your custom charm work yesterday. I was wondering if you’d give me your opinion on this.” Malfoy stepped closer to the whiteboard, which was now covered from corner to corner in Harry’s cramped notes.
Harry blindly groped for Malfoy’s wrist, and pulled him down onto the bed. Malfoy yelped. “Shhhh,” Harry threw an arm over his hips, and took Malfoy’s wand from slack fingers. “Don’t wake Nev.” He cast a wordless spell, and a bubble of silence encased the bed. “Quiet now,” Harry pushed his nose into the back of Malfoy’s neck. His hair smelled good. “Sleep.”
“No, we’re clear,” Potter said, and he commenced divesting Draco of his outer robe. “You’re dirty, you know that?”
Malfoy slammed the file in his hands down on the desk, so suddenly and with such force, that Harry jumped, and paperclips and fastenings flew in all directions. “Doesn’t
“Quite,” Malfoy said, rather smugly. “Now, get out your gloves, Potter, and lets get our friends nice and lubed up.”
“Er,” Harry flipped back through his notepad until he found the page. “Seven inches long, lilac coloured, made of polyvinyl chloride. I have a serial number, if that helps?” Malfoy jotted each specification down on the parchment, including the serial number, and then wrote ‘sale’ at the bottom of the list. He drew his wand from his robes and tapped it gently on the page. The words seemed to melt into the paper, and nothing else happened for a moment – but then words reformed on the page:
“Seriously, it’s better that we don’t go in there. We’ve done so much already,” Harry gestured at all the boxes. “Let’s leave this last bit for now. I’ll work on it through the week!”
Harry closed his eyes, and used every ounce of his willpower to pull away. “Draco, what if we - what if this-”
"…and it is our conclusion that the sentence imposed on Draco Malfoy should be considered served, reduced by four years and six months, with due consideration given to his expressed remorse for his crimes, and subsequent invaluable service to the Ministry during The War. Mister Malfoy - you are free to go."
“A miracle, to be perfectly honest. It’s an issue of tradition, and I can almost guarantee I could spend the better part of a year working my way through the bureaucracy and red tape before I even came close to an outcome.” Draco poked a nearby cup with the tip of his wand, and the tea stains disappeared.
Harry sat up in bed with an involuntary, but deeply felt, moan. His pillows were unpleasantly hot, and had twisted into lumpy instruments of torture under his head during the night. It really wasn’t any wonder that he was feeling hungover and a little bit ashamed after the night he’d had. He tried to recall if he’d ever got himself off so many times in a row, even at fourteen, which he was fairly sure had been his peak wanking age. He couldn’t think of a single time that he’d brought himself off three times in as many hours. It was lucky he had any skin left on his palm, let alone his cock.
“Good. Then last additions, I want Oliver Wood, because I think he might hit it off with Rahim, and Kreacher.”
Drumming up the nerve to Portkey to the ground was embarrassingly difficult, and in the end Draco arrived far later than he intended. As was expected with his luck, the first person he saw was Weasley, who took one look at Draco and let out a low whistle. “Slytherin pride, eh Malfoy?”
“Don’t be grumpy about Hermione, I promise it didn’t mean anything.” The rug was a right mess now, and Ron was pushing him out the sitting room door without stopping to tidy up the soot. Draco would murder them both if he knew.
“Sold,” Potter said, and he was halfway out the door before he’d finished the word. “I’ll get my coat and see you back here in five minutes.”
The rest of the outfit was no easier. Harry tried all of his shirts, but found he looked disturbingly like Michael Flatley when pairing any one of them with the tight jeans, and quickly ruled them all out too. Something plain seemed like a safe choice, so he pulled on a white t-shirt, groaning when he found it barely reached his hips and clung to his shoulders and chest. In desperation he threw on an old leather jacket that had once belonged to Sirius. It was buttery-soft and somewhat comforting, and he felt slightly less exposed with it on.
Harry groaned, and passed a hand across his face. It was hard to say which of these rooms was the worse one, since they were both terrible in their own right. This room just happened to be the one where Harry hid his impulse purchases. Draco stepped in, easing past a huge box with an exercise bike in it, never opened. On top sat several cricket sets, many of the bats signed by elite cricketers from the England team, as well as India and Australia. Several tubes of fresh, blindingly neon tennis balls were also perched on top. Tennis racquets to match were around somewhere, probably under something else.
“Being in love with an uncommunicative idiot who takes you for granted and never tells you what you mean to him until you basically hate him?” She rolled her eyes. “Yeah, sure. No idea what that’s like.” Granger sighed, and signalled for the elf again, and asked for a glass of sparkling water. “Listen, I know it’s none of my business. And I realise that I don’t really have a history of respecting other people’s boundaries, so I say this with full self-awareness.” When the elf had been and gone again, she continued. “I think you’re making a mistake with how you’re handling things with Harry. And Teddy,” Draco nearly stood up, but Granger held up one hand. “Please, let me finish. Teddy only has three living blood relatives, and all he knows right now is that one of them would rather be at the office than spend time with him.”
“Smith,” Zabini murmured. God, this was too good. He was starting to see why Draco enjoyed it so much.
It would be much worse, later. When he’d experienced being in a relationship with Potter, and having him leave, move on to someone else, and always having the reminder of him through Teddy.
“Oh.” Realisation and a fresh blush bloomed on Potter’s face. “It’s called the wallpaper. You choose a picture to stick there so you always see it.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, clearing his throat. “Yes, that would be very helpful, thanks Malfoy.” He waved his wand in a sharp motion, and both the King Dong and Amy glowed faintly purple. “When you’re ready.”
“Darling,” Draco said calmly, which was a sure sign that he was probably about to explode. “What exactly the fuck am I looking at, here?”
Breakfast was his absolute favorite meal of the day. He didn't like to sleep-in nowadays, as he had once upon a time. He wanted to get up with the sun and throw on his tatty old bathrobe, and stand in the kitchen in the light of the brand new day, whisking eggs and frying sausages, and pouring cold, fresh milk into tall glasses. He set the table, every morning. Except for when he didn't, and he carried breakfast in on trays for them to eat on their knees in bed. He relished the feel of buttery crumbs down his front, and accidental drips of marmalade or golden syrup on his sheets. Breakfast was grand.
Malfoy seemed unfazed. “But it’s been quite a while though, hasn't it.” Harry wondered wildly if Malfoy could actually
“Rude. That was my best chat.” Harry shivered in the cold night air. He was freezing, but he could stand here for hours, as long as Malfoy kept smiling at him like that.
“In the spirit of that,” Draco said lightly - too lightly. Harry forced himself to concentrate. “We really need to get the party organised for the next couple of weeks.” Harry groaned into Draco’s armpit. “Honestly, Potter, anyone would think you didn’t want an engagement party.”
“Let’s look it up, shall we?” Teddy carefully cancelled the video, and Draco spelled that word out too.
There was no more time to fuss around if he wanted to attempt to sort out his hair. Harry grabbed a pair of dragonhide boots with ornate buckles, another find from Sirius’ old wardrobe, and pulled them on as he hopped into the bathroom.
“Well done,” Draco sneered. “With powers of observation like that, maybe there’s a career for you in the Aurors after all.”
Harry laughed. “Not enough galleons in the world for that, mate.” He gave the paper one last look, then collected it and his now empty tea cup, and took both to the sink, dropping the paper onto the towering pile of old
“I’m him.” Draco says it firmly, then puts his free hand even more firmly on Harry’s thigh, like he’s staking a claim. It’s like a bolt of lust directly to the cock. “Since we have that settled, I’m going to need you to take the blame for teaching Edward improper words.”
Malfoy, long limbed and graceful. Malfoy’s strong, nimble fingers and silken hair that brushed so gently against Harry’s jaw, and throat. Malfoy knew all sorts of things that Harry would like to know too, would like Malfoy to teach him. There had always been something about Malfoy. Harry had always been fascinated by him, he couldn't deny that. And Malfoy had always been handsome; Harry’d known that too, even if he’d tried to ignore it.
“Like you invented shagging,” the mirror puffed, and the glass shivered and dripped rather violently.
This time Draco’s eyes were a little softer, but his accompanying sigh was still annoyed. ”So, do you have an estimate on exactly how many old magazines, and mummified Doxies, and jars of your own piss are in this collection, or?”
“Hmm?” Harry realised Malfoy was staring at him, his lips quirked. Harry coughed. “Oh, yes, totally agree, Malfoy.” Harry hadn't the faintest idea what Malfoy had said in the past few minutes, but he wasn't about to ask him to repeat it.
ready. In need of some advice. And really very hungry, he realised, as his stomach burbled. Man could not live on Lucozade alone.
Potter rolled over and settled above Draco, and leaned down to press a very soft, very gentle kiss to his mouth. “You’ve already earned it. Scrivener’s a fuckwit who wants to curry favour with the ‘famous Harry Potter’, only he doesn’t realise that that bloke pissed off years ago. I don’t want to run the place. I like being a consultant. It’s simpler – not as much of the office politics to worry about.” He grinned at Draco, who frowned up at him.
Potter adjusted his glasses and thumbed through some of the pages he was still holding. “Shift change at midnight, everything went as usual, all owls accounted for. Three had been checked out for overnight deliveries and were expected back in the morning, but the rest were in the roost where they should’ve been. There were only two Keepers on Gamma shift, that’s midnight to six, and they were both on the lower deck for most of the shift doing meal prep.” Here Potter shuddered, presumably at the thought of what that must entail. “Both claim they didn’t notice anything particular, other than a particularly stiff wind at around 2.30am. Apparently it wasn’t unusual enough to prompt a roost check, because the owls were only found to be missing about an hour before Alpha shift arrived at 5.45am.”
Ron laughed so hard that the dong fell onto the table with a dull thud. “Maybe not, mate, but Hermione has these anatomical models from her third year Healer training. Maybe she can tell you where she got them.”
Blaise choked on his next sip. “That much, really?” Harry smiled, and nodded. “Well. It’s going to take a bit more than an auction of your excess household items. You’re going to have to exploit your celebrity, and probably spend time with people that you’d normally find irritating or tedious.”
Draco had a CI once who had told him that the best time to kick a potions habit was the day you started, but the second best time was now. He’d thought it a bit rich, coming from a man who was informing on a criminal syndicate in order to get off his own charges, but over time, the past six months, particularly, as he’d come to view this thing with Potter as a symptom of his own addiction, Draco found himself more and more convinced the CI was right.
“But the rest is accurate.” She didn’t wait for a response. “What’s changed, then? Seems like something major happened, what, two months ago?”
“You’re not kidding,” Potter breathed, as Draco ground against his hip, and locked the door with a flick of his wand.
Theo found Draco’s moka pot, and set it on the stove to brew them some coffee, and Blaise frogmarched Draco to the breakfast bar and onto a stool like an insubordinate child. He steepled his long fingers and stared at Draco, until Draco gave in and snapped, “
Harry picked up the tie again, and wound it around his fist. “Will you come to the funeral, at least?”
“Shut up,” Malfoy sulked, but he got in. Harry smiled and slipped his arm over his hips. Malfoy hadn’t bothered with the robe this time.
“No. I mean. I don't know.” It shouldn’t really matter. There was really no telling where this thing with Malfoy might go, beyond maybe a shag, or a couple of them. Did it really matter about all the things that had happened so long ago? He knew it did, to him, anyway. Harry didn’t do one nighters, or flings, or fuck buddies. There were many reasons for his long period of singlehood, and that was one of them. He needed there to be a real connection. That’s why a Muggle or a casual shag would never work. How could he possibly connect with someone that he couldn’t talk about...well, everything, with.
Ron looked thoughtful as he chewed. “I’m secure in my heterosexuality, but I’d try anal, at least once, see what all the fuss is about.” He waved his chopsticks in Harry’s face. “The anus is full of very sensitive nerve endings, you know, Harry.”
, you might run into Scrivener.” Potter rolled his eyes, and sucked on his teeth noisily. “Ugh, really. You’re a disgrace.” Draco couldn’t stop his hand from twitching forward this time, and he brushed away the pastry flakes which had collected on Potter’s robes with a violent swish of his monogrammed handkerchief.
“Perhaps not, but you’d better do something about it, or that penis, and the wanker attached to it, are going to be in very finely diced pieces, very soon!”
,” Draco took care to imply dire consequences in every syllable of his name. The boy turned an especially satisfying shade of pale and made haste to the buffet table.
Draco had looked up at Harry at some stage, and evidently his creeping sense of impending doom was showing, even upside down. “That’s a lot of bedrooms.”
“Mustard,” Harry answered, and snatched a cornichon from Draco’s plate. “Do you think we have time for a quickie?”
“I’m married to my work, Potter,” Malfoy said, his nose in the air. “And I’m quite satisfied.” Harry just laughed at him, and he could tell Malfoy was pleased by it, in the way his lips tightened against a smile that he couldn’t quite keep from his eyes.
“It’s Dudley,” Cabbage Head said. “If you keep calling me Cabbage Head, I won’t introduce you to my cousin.”
After all, he’d made such a big deal about Perkins being the expert, even though that had been an exaggeration, so he could hardly backtrack now. The fact that Potter had addressed the memo to him was purely because he was the senior officer in Potions Division, and thus was in charge of distribution of cases and allocation of work. So, really, there was no reason to question Draco’s decision to delegate accordingly.
“Did you see when I nearly came off my broom, Draco?” Ted double thumped, and Draco tried to suppress a groan. He was going to need medical attention after this. He also tried not to think too much about the amount of jam doughnut residue being transferred into his hair by Ted’s sticky fist. “I could have died!”
Mollified, Malfoy drew a blank sheet of parchment from the tray on his desk and picked up a quill. “Specifications?”
After dinner Draco watched the memory twice, the McQueen scarf wrapped around his shoulders. The sound of their dishes clinking in the sink under a washing charm was just audible in the sitting room, with the telly on, and Bake Off about to start, and the fire was low and glowing orange. Draco sat with his legs curled up on the sofa cushions, and Harry sat as close beside him as he could manage, his own legs stretched straight out and feet propped up on a low footstool. “You know, I never believed that story of yours about nearly being sorted into Slytherin.”
be a trifle busy.” They scattered like ants, and Draco went back into his office, closing the door before allowing his grin to finally break free. He checked his watch, frowned, and then returned to his desk to check his calendar, picking up a quill to scribble out a memo.
"Who's going to tell?" Harry asked, still gripping Malfoy's hand, still staring at him, so close. Malfoy shrugged again. He didn't try to move, or retrieve his hand. Eventually Harry let him go, and stepped towards the wood pile.
Draco cut a piece of lamb and chewed it. Potter watched him, and looked as if he wanted to say something else, but didn't know how.
Harry shrugged. “Why not? It’s only six months, and if Draco’s already teaching, then we won’t have to do the Floo-in, Floo-out thing again. Honestly, I’d do the Groundskeeping or even the Caretaking, whatever, I don’t mind. Hagrid and Filch are surely on the verge of retirement. I’m ready for a quiet life. As long as we’re able to sit down for dinner together every night, and wake up together every morning, I’ll be happy. I don’t care what I do.”
“Well, try to do it while walking, Potter, if you think you can manage both things at once. I’m busy.”
“Saggy what?” Draco stiffened, and Potter nudged his way to the bar with his hips, and leaned both elbows on the counter. “I’d love to hear the end of that. We don’t swear much to Salazar in our House.” The twink across from them started vigorously fellating the straw in a vivid green cocktail. Potter had his eyes on Draco like a white hot brand, and missed the show. “We go in for more of a ‘Godric’s giant gonads’ vibe.”
“I was a queer kid living under the same roof as the Devil’s henchwoman. Voldemort used to pop in for tea with a ruddy great snake. There were werewolves living in the orchard. It wasn’t ideal.”
“Bottom,” Potter said without hesitation, his hips cocked against the kitchenette worktop. Draco felt his face heating even as he rolled his eyes and firmly avoided looking too closely at Potter’s jeans.
Draco glared for as long as he dared at Weasley, then a bit more at Potter. “I’ll set up in Incident Room 7. I need to make some Floo calls to cancel my Portkey and hotel, and my elf service. Then I’m getting a cup of tea. Meet me in front of Seven in fifteen minutes Potter. You won’t be able to get in with just a visitor pass.”
There was an audible hum in Draco’s office, caused chiefly by the swarm of memos circling the air space above Draco’s desk like a flock of noisy birds. He almost didn’t notice it anymore, thanks in part to the Shield charm which had become a necessity to prevent each anxious missive from swooping down and pecking Draco’s head. He was absolutely swamped with work; for every memo he plucked from the fleet above, it seemed another three would arrive.
Draco scheduled a briefing, and invited half the department. He also made sure he scheduled it to overlap with an appointment Potter couldn’t get out of, right at the end of the day, which was conveniently the middle of Draco’s shift. So there was no chance Potter could refuse, nor could he skip Ted’s end of year parent-teacher briefing. And there was no way it could finish early, and Draco could be cornered, alone, with no excuse about somewhere else he needed to be.
“Harry said Malfoy got weird after they shagged that time I got hexed on the wolfsbane case. Mum’s knitting you a jumper, by the way, Malfoy.”
Potter grinned at him. “Oh, you like me alright. Don’t try to pretend you haven’t been fighting this since the day I joined the team. You’re very good at it, except for the blushing – which I’m all for, don’t get me wrong.”
He knew he had, but it also seemed sort of unbelievable. No wonder Hermione had been so worried about his wellbeing. He was practically a fucking hermit.
Harry sat up properly and Conjured himself a Muggle whiteboard and erasable pens. Waving his wand over the report, he copied the spell diagram and transposed it onto the whiteboard, and began to scrawl and mutter to himself. “Gemino curse, incantation
There had been no mention of a limit on veto powers. Who was making these rules, anyway? “Yes. No Krum.”
“Potter?” Malfoy said, and Harry blinked and checked his holster, then his back pocket for his wallet. Anything else he’d left behind he’d have to come back for on Saturday. His brain was too fried by the heat and Malfoy’s perfect hips.
“I can see the paranoid little cogs whirring away in there, Malfoy. It’s as simple as this: I’m disgustingly in love. Never been happier in my life. She’s the most annoying woman I’ve ever met, and we fight at least twice a day. She cannot cook to save herself, she’s bossy, she’s eye-wateringly clever, and she’s an absolute monster in the bedroom.” Draco’s eyes were huge.
“Marvellous,” Malfoy said, and beckoned his fingers. “Hand me a pair of those gloves, then, and let's crack on.”
Agatha had been thrilled. Potter sent him a memo that swooped and pecked him hard on the ear, and which said only ‘What the fuck, Malfoy?’. Draco spread it flat, and traced the letters carefully with his fingertip, then quickly set it alight before he could do anything else even more stupid with the thing.
He watched him, as Malfoy continued to stare at his hand, his cheeks burning red now. Harry stepped a little closer, and Malfoy's posture stiffened even further.
After Teddy’s final dose of Skelegro for the evening, and a few more chuckles over how horrible it was, and that the taste alone should be enough to discourage him from any further risk-taking behaviour, Andromeda saw them to the door of the ward. “What have you done with your mobile, Harry? I tried to call you several times before I tried my nephew.”
Draco did the first two things, and went to bed, but lay there, his mind racing, incapable of sleep.
thought about anything, only they’d always had a sort of rivalry, hadn't they, always trying to get one up on the other. One
Harry did as he was told, and tried his best to express his appreciation for all Draco’s other bits as well.
“You look like the bastard child of Elton John and David Bowie,” Pansy said, sipping a latte in his kitchen. She’d at least brought almond friands with her, otherwise he’d have told her to fuck off hours ago.
“Maybe I shouldn’t Silence it after all. Give Malfoy an excuse to flash his pants at you again, and slap you about a little bit.”
“It sounds like Malfoy should probably come along on this one, sir,” Potter said to Robards. “We could use the consult in the field.”
“I do trust you, completely.” He put his chin on Draco’s shoulder, going up onto the balls of his feet to reach. “I’ve been listening to what you’ve said these last two days. I know when I get like this it can make you feel like I don’t. I do, though.”
As soon as his food was gone, and Potter's, Draco was moving again. The sooner this was over with, the better, and if Potter wasn't going to say anything, not yell or tell him to leave, or anything else that might
“Pans and I never dated, which you well know,” Draco said primly. “Moving on from family to friends. Blaise and Greg, obviously, and Theo. Millie, the Greengrass girls, Zach Smith-” Harry made a loud gagging noise. Zacharias Smith. There were few people Harry could stand less than Zacharias. Draco put down the pen and fixed Harry with a look. “Something to say?”
Ginny mashed a bit of grilled tomato onto her sourdough with glee. “I’m definitely fine with it. Not to make it weird, but if you ever need someone to, I don't know, hold the camera while you…”
Weasley grinned, fondly. “Yeah. She’s a bit mental, our Hermione.” He pointed at Draco. “She’s decided you need rescuing, and since she can’t hassle Harry about it directly-”
The war had been over for nearly twelve months. Voldemort was gone, just a bad dream, half-forgotten by most in this new era of peace. But for some, it wasn't nearly over. Trials were still held daily for war crimes, and sentences were being carried out all over the country.
Draco felt like he’d just been hit with an Ennervate. He jerked his hips, wrenched Potter’s hand out of his jeans, and pushed off the wall, managing to dislodge Potter with the element of surprise. “And I’m not a
They were both laughing when Malfoy’s door opened loudly. Malfoy himself stood in the doorway, again in his pants and silky robe, holding a towel and a wash bag, and glaring meaningfully at them both, before stomping to the bathroom and slamming the door.
Half a dozen photographs of Ted appeared. Ted in his uniform at the cottage, broom in one hand and clearly brimming with excitement. Ted being buckled into his pads by a beaming Potter. Draco’s breath caught. There was open love on Potter’s face, and Draco’s heart guttered for a moment. Ted in the change rooms with the rest of the team. A close-up of Ted and Auntie Andromeda, their faces squashed together, cheek to cheek. Ted and Draco: Ted up on Draco’s shoulders with one fist in the air and the other clutching Draco’s hair, and Draco looking up at him, laughing, his hands wrapped around Teddy’s knees. Finally, one of Draco and Potter - in fact, it was a picture of Ted running full pelt towards his grandmother, a near blur in the foreground, and Draco and Potter in the background. Everything about them radiated tension. Below this one, a green bubble with a question:
“Yeah. It was October. You first kissed me at my birthday drinks, and you finally acknowledged we were actually dating in August. So stubborn,” Harry kissed him on the tip of his pointy nose.
He flicked his wand distractedly around the kitchen; a couple of dishes from meals eaten through the week are set to washing, the empty bottle of Lucozade putting itself obediently in the recycling bin along with an empty Stella or two, which then tramped out along with the rubbish to put itself in the bins outside. A shopping list wrote itself on the board hanging from the back of the larder door. A broom shuffled out of the utility room and swept up stray crumbs and bits of crud into the pan, which dutifully followed.
He was going to have to cancel all of it, each item on his carefully constructed and much looked forward to itinerary being crossed out instead of ticked.
Draco’d had a long time to come to terms with his feelings about Potter, but not nearly enough to process what Potter claimed he felt in return. Even with his best friend backing him.
“I’m not begging – I’m ordering,” Draco pushed back against Potter’s cock and succeeded in catching the ridge of Potter’s cock on the very rim of his hole. Potter hissed. “There’s a difference between the two.”
The club was sensory overload. The music throbbed through him, almost like a living thing, and the air was thick with the scent of heated flesh and booze. The crowd heaved, arms raised and fingers reaching towards the ceiling; they too reminded Harry of some sort of single organism, moving as one to the beat. It was almost oppressively hot; sweat prickled along his spine and behind his knees. Malfoy was behind him, his chest pressed to Harry’s back like it had been that night in the lab. He had one hand lightly on Harry’s hip, encouraging him to press deeper into the mass of bodies. “A little further, Potter, that’s it.” His breath was a sultry huff into the shell of Harry’s ear. “Just a little more.”
Draco, thankfully, loved admin, and would therefore drag Harry along whether he cooperated or not, and was the sole reason they had a nice Muggle vehicle, with the appropriate magical permits, and a cottage in Martigné-sur-Mayenne, and British passports (which could be found without the need for a major excavation of the study) which they could use to drive their nice car to their lovely French cottage for holidays.
“Well, call me old fashioned but I’d suggest by taking your dildo sample and inserting it firmly into the crevice of your choice. But you’re the lab rat, Potter.”
“You also promised me that you’d make sure nothing happened that I didn’t enthusiastically consent to. Malfoy,” Harry turned his face til their lips were almost touching. “If I consent any more enthusiastically, I’m going to tear a hole in the front of my trousers.”
Malfoy smiled, still looking away. Harry couldn’t keep his eyes off him. “I want to keep it. And your respect. All the good things. I want them to stay. I couldn’t do without them again, I think. I’m grateful for our friendship. Maybe I haven’t said, but you’re one of the most important people in my life, Harry.”
He knew there was something going on around him. Lots of noise, lots of people talking loudly, excitedly. He could hear Potter shouting over the top of the crowd, something about making sure there were no clauses. He couldn't see. He couldn't seem to focus his vision properly. Was this how Potter saw the world, when he hadn't any glasses? Just a murky blur of colours and shapes, no clear outline of who or what he was staring at-
Well, that wiped the smug grin right off Ron’s face. “I don’t mind telling you, that hurts my feelings.”
He broke the kiss, or tried to — his mouth seemed glued to Potter’s neck, and his hands were already halfway up the back of his robe. “What are you doing for the next two weeks, Potter?”
Harry shrugged. “Well, it could still be something like that, but it’s not clear yet whether this thing is just intended as a nuisance, or if there’s something more harmful lurking under there. Digging the garden up has done nothing to stop these things growing back, nor has removing the original cursed object,” Harry gestured towards the dildo, lying prone on a tray on the bench between them. “The fact that the cuttings wouldn’t grow here in the lab is perplexing. I had two planted in soil samples from the Throttlebottom’s garden, and one in fresh soil as a control, and it grew in none of the test pots. I even buried the original and nothing happened, which indicates that there is something very specific about that garden or those people that is directly related to the activation of the curse. I’d be very hesitant to use any sort of magic to get rid of them until we know it won’t backfire and cause even more cock-related disasters. Which means Throttlebottom is probably going to pay the Minister another visit soon, which means the Minister is probably going to pay
“It’s too early to be saying ‘penis’,” Neville said sleepily from the other bed, and under a mountainous duvet. “That’s an after breakfast word.”
“He?” Ginny’s eyebrows climbed, and he could see her exchanging looks with Hermione in the mirror on the sun visor. “Did you say ‘he’?”
“Everyone is visible from the office,” Malfoy was saying. “The glass is integrated with the charm, which allows it to look like a regular wall on one side, and reveals all those present in the shop, on the other. That’s how I keep an eye on things, and see if I need to send anyone onto the shop floor if it’s getting busy. I’m not normally out there, you see,” Malfoy said conversationally, as he watched a rather large wizard pay for a length of velvet rope and a blindfold. “But it’s been a bit relentless today, and all my people are already on the floor. I don’t like to keep the customers waiting. They mostly know what they want, and would prefer to be in and out quickly, as it were.”
Draco went pink, and his mouth twisted sideways. “I was being bossy and unreasonable. You’re off work with a curse injury, and this is hard for you even at the best of times, so just rest this week and don’t worry about the last room.”
astronomically drunk that they had been in any danger of falling in – in fact, Draco was still not entirely sure how the Undersecretary had managed it, but he was wearing a cravat that evening, and that meant that any disaster could, and often would, happen.
. I'm calling for your help in getting some, erm, artificial assistance. I'm not sure quite what to ask for...something anatomically correct," Harry cleared his throat and used the sleeve of his robes to wipe the quickly rising beads of sweat from his upper lip. "I was wondering if that was something you might have at your shop."
“Merlin,” Ron laughed, turning back to the chicken. “If that’s not the Black gene making an appearance.”
“Not really,” Potter said, looking up and doing some sort of twist and stretch himself. “There’s all sorts of weird shit that you’d expect, but nothing that sticks out as relevant to this situation.”
Draco pressed the end button viciously with his thumb and dropped the phone on his bedside table, then rolled over again and shut his eyes.
Longbottom shook his head, eyes a little vacant. “Dunno, but I’m not game enough to ask, either. She’s not to be crossed!” It was good to laugh. The water felt good, though it was cold. The sand shifted beneath his bare toes. “What about your mum, is she making arrangements for you?” Draco blew out a tight breath, and shook his head. “How come?”
“I already said I agreed with you,” Draco said, swallowing the wine in one. “What do you want from me?” It wasn’t like he could go back in time and un-fuck Potter. Potter had seen to that himself, when he and his friends had smashed every Time Turner in the United Kingdom escaping Draco’s own father and his Death Eater chums.
Potter slid a scrap of parchment with the codes across the counter and through the gap in the kiosk’s service window. He hadn’t quite removed his fingers before Draco plucked it up, and so for an electric microsecond, they were touching.
Draco shook his head. “No, Harry. You hear, but you don’t listen.” Draco levitated the cake away, and moved closer. “What did you wish for?”
Draco sat at his desk and schooled his face into the picture of innocence, or at least, as close to innocence as his face might ever get. “What smirk? How dare you.”
“Sometimes people ask me about you,” Longbottom said, frankly. The waves pushed them around some more, and Draco belatedly renewed his Warming charm. He couldn’t imagine who would be asking Longbottom about
“I know, they’re horrible, right?” A moment later she came up with a bag of Quality Street, just the orange creams, and a small carton of Pepper Imps. “Luna loves them, honestly I shouldn’t have let her pack the snacks, because she has the most peculiar taste.” She sighed. “Looks like I’m going to starve.”
Breakfast. God, but he loved breakfast. Harry supposed it hearkened back to their school days, at Hogwarts. Big, hot breakfasts, mountainous piles of bacon, and toast, and eggs, and pancakes. It was kind of a nostalgic thing, in many ways. A daily reminder of the good old days of long wooden benches, boys and girls jostling, and giggling, and pinching, and kicking, and burping the alphabet and the Hogwarts song. A reminder of some of the best talks he'd ever had with Ron, and Hermione, and some of the best essays he'd ever written in the very last minutes before they were due, decorated with crumbs and splashes of pumpkin juice and spots of ink.
, who was possibly the fittest person he’d ever met and who was the present owner of a thriving sex shop and therefore was about a thousand times more sexually experienced than Harry. He was going out in clothes which were basically painted onto him. If he so much as had a mildly sexual thought tonight, it would probably be visible to the wide world, and he strongly suspected he would be having a number of sexual thoughts around Malfoy whether he wanted to or not.
. Because Harry had discovered he was just that, sweet right in the centre, despite his many exterior prickles. It was one of the first of many surprising discoveries he’d made about Draco back when he was still
“It’s a pleasure to have you behind me, Mr Potter.” Draco stood, and escorted Potter to the door. “Pierce will show you to your office, and get you settled in. I’ve taken the liberty of scheduling a meeting for the two of us at three o’clock. You should ensure your calendar is free for the remainder of the day, as I suspect it may be a long one.”
Potter looked stunned. He raked a hand through his hair, which was already wild. “I didn’t - I don’t see you like that. Is that what you think? I wasn’t trying to send you away, I-”
“Fairy lights, I think.” Malfoy stood beside him, looking up the branches above them. Harry nodded, and Malfoy took a deep breath, and began to cast. Beads of golden light poured from the tip of his wand like a string of amber pearls, racing each other up into the limbs and scattering widely, sticking to leaves, branches, twisting up the knobbled bark in garlands that wrapped around the trunk and back down again. It was beautiful; it made gooseflesh rise on Harry’s arms, and butterflies race around his belly. Malfoy’s face was sharp in profile. His eyes twinkled in the reflected light. Harry could hardly stand to look at him, but equally, he couldn’t look away.
“I always wanted your attention.” Malfoy said it quietly, with a little smile on his lips, his eyes on the bottles of booze lined up behind the bar. “I’m a simple creature, Potter. I went about it the only way I knew how. Being a little bastard.”
“I was looking for you,” Potter’s boots echoed off the tiles. “I went up to your office, but they told me you were probably down here.”
Potter made a hand gesture that was not very festive at all. “You look like you just sucked a lemon. What’s the problem?” He didn’t bother to invite Draco to sit, not that Draco would have waited for such an invitation anyway. He pushed a pile of tinsel off the spare seat with the tip of his wand, and felt his face draw even more tightly into a disapproving pucker when a half-eaten piece of shortbread was revealed underneath. “Oh! I wondered where that got to!” Potter looked pleased, and leaned over the desk to snatch up the biscuit, taking a huge bite to Draco’s great horror. “Sit, already. You’re making the place look untidy.”
“You know, I think the thing I’m most looking forward to when Scrivener retires is being able to say ‘canoe’ again. I really had no idea how often it would come up,” Potter’s voice was lazy and sated. “But it does. It really does.”
Draco glared, with as much authority as he could manage while remaining aware that the tips of his ears were burning, and probably turning pink. “Where I come from, it’s a sign that the person requiring the grooming is an unprofessional mess, and who is devaluing the nearby real estate simply by being in its general proximity. Meeting Room 4, now please!”
they didn't want to these days, including so called chores like cooking. Draco couldn't care less about breakfast, unless Harry was making it for him. It was a gesture of affection, of love. One which Draco and Harry both missed out on whenever he was sent off on assignment with the Auror team.
Draco made a pained sound, and pinched the bridge of his nose. Potter crouched down beside the girl, who was looking decidedly wobbly. “What were you trying to do with the little owls?”
“Aren’t you going to tell me why I’m a genius?” Potter’s voice followed Draco back out to the corridor and into the jangle of Christmas carols.
Malfoy was a good two hours away, but Harry's mind kept turning back to his imminent arrival, and the item he would be bringing with him, and what he'd then have to
“He’s alright, Harry,” Malfoy said, his voice calm and reassuring. He grabbed a handful of powder, and opened the Floo to St Mungo’s. Not completely alright, then. Fuck, Ted. “He’s alright,” Malfoy said again, and wrapped his long, warm fingers around Harry’s wrist, squeezing. “Come on, I’ve got you.”
Potter waved his hand dismissively. “Oh, have a day off, would you. What happened? The last time you made that face, we’d lost the bid for the 2015 Headless Hunt World Head Polo Championships to France.”
“Why not, Harry?” Hermione’s hand was cool when she touched his wrist. She was using a bloody charm!
Harry wasn’t quite sure what to say about that suggestion. In fact, he was still thinking about it several hours after Ron left.
he thought to himself, moving his foot under the slow drip of the tap, letting the warm water trickle behind his toes and over the sole and arch.
Circe’s tits. “Again, I appreciate the kind offer, but I am truly just up for a night with my friend. Not up for any choking or pissing, or anything else.”
His wand slipped out of his hands and into the water with a plop, and Draco swore and scooped it up frantically before it sank out of sight. “Longbottom - what the fuck? Was that a come on?”
Malfoy cut one in half, and Harry saw that they were thick with meat, cheese, and some sort of pickle. “They’re not entirely authentic,” Malfoy said, as if Harry would have known the difference. “I couldn’t find a proper muffaletta loaf, so this is actually focaccia bread, which is close enough. And I used Jarlsberg instead of Swiss, because that’s what they had on hand at the delicatessen near mine.” He used the knife to gesture to the pickle. “That’s giardiniera and olives - my favourite bit, actually.” Malfoy served a hefty half onto Harry’s plate. “For my twenty-first birthday, Mother took me to America. Father had died not long before, and we were both at a bit of a loss.” He placed the second half onto his own plate, and took the lid off the casserole dish that held Harry’s pasta salad. “We were in the French Quarter in New Orleans when I discovered this at a cafe near Jackson Square. New Orleans is
“I don't know what any of those things are,” Draco lied, and changed into his comfortable grey jeans instead of the heavier trousers he’d started off in. It was hot, being August, and the last thing he needed on top of everything else would be swamp crotch. “Do you think this is too much?” Teddy was almost certainly going to be a Hufflepuff, there was no hint of Slytherin to be found, and Draco had been keeping a close eye, but it wouldn’t hurt to show a little House pride anyway. In that spirit, he’d spent half his drunken evening digging out his school Quidditch uniform. The practice jersey from Sixth still fit, in a manner of speaking. It barely grazed his hips, and it was a little clingy around the chest and shoulders, but you could hardly tell when he rolled up the sleeves to the elbow. He almost hadn’t - the Mark had faded considerably, and got a little paler with every passing year - but it was going to be a long and hot day, and people already recognised him whether they could see the Mark, or not. He was who he was, and who he was, was Draco Malfoy. Former Death Eater. Current proud cousin.
That prompted an embarrassed huff of laughter from Harry. “It’s Harry, actually. Gorgeous is just my middle name.”
“Gross,” Harry grimaced, taking several steps away from the vanity, and setting the jar of hair cement down on the cistern of the toilet. His mirror was a total perv, and now he was going to have to move his bedroom to at least another floor because there was no way he was ever going to shower or relieve himself in this one ever again.
“Fuck!” Weasley spluttered and pushed his mug onto the nearest flat surface, hot tea seeping into the front of his robe. Draco pulled the letter from the morning from his coat pocket and chucked it at Weasley’s head.
"No questions!" Potter shouted. "No questions! Draco Malfoy deserves his privacy, and some goddamn peace and quiet. You might as well give up now as there'll be no questions!"
“Not this again. There are three reasons you want to go there, and none of them are the quality of the food.”
“Rubbish,” Ron said. “You saved my life only a couple of weeks ago. Also, it’s my personal belief that everyone has a little bit of Gryffindor in them.”
“Yeah,” Harry sighed. “So I have a habit of buying people things and then not giving them to that person.”
“No. I’m not -” Harry cleared his throat and stepped slightly closer. “This is hard for me, Malfoy. I find it hard to let go. To be, uh...vulnerable, I suppose.” That was possibly the most honest thing Harry had told anyone in a long time, and perhaps it was weird that it was in the middle of a Muggle nightclub, to Malfoy, but it was about time he gave the issue air. He
“No,” Harry rumbled. He wasn’t sure what had gotten into him, but he had Malfoy pressed against the wall with the entire front of himself. “Not this time.”
,” Draco moaned, and they stopped talking about cleaning and parties for just a little while longer.
A Muggle place, then. Harry sipped his tea thoughtfully for a moment. He really did need to get back on the horse; this mini meltdown made that painfully clear. He needed to break the ice, as Malfoy said. He couldn’t bear the well meaning enthusiasm of his best friends, not yet at least. Malfoy, on the other hand, was not a friend, although he had been fairly decent just lately, even counting the rinsing, which was surely to be expected and was not entirely unpleasant.
Harry rubbed one hand over the back of his neck, cheeks flaming. “Ah, right. I don’t really know much about sex toys. Not really my thing, I suppose.”
Out in the garden it was easier to breathe. The oaks were tall and ancient, a thick canopy to block out the heat of the day. The grass was thick, thanks to Neville’s watering system, and the hanging pots and raised beds were full to the brim with violets, daisies, candytufts and geraniums, and sweet peas, frothy and bright, and tumbling over the edges.
She smiled and murmured her thanks, and they were alone again. The piano was soft, and rubbish. Draco hated everything about this fucking place. There was absolutely no chance of running into Potter here. “Yes, I heard you’ve changed your rotation. And your workout. You’re not even doing your usual run, is that right?” She took a slow sip. “Not even coming to Junior Quidditch tournaments for the sake of young men who look up to you.”
“Right – well. My investigation.” Harry cleared his throat and retrieved his notepad and a self-inking quill from the inner pocket of his robe. Malfoy gestured towards a small, glass walled office in the corner of what Harry could now see was a large warehouse. Crate after crate was stacked on neat shelves, with helpful signs such as ‘Dildos – glass (3-6 inches)’ and ‘Nipple clamps’. Harry felt sweaty and flustered, and wasted no time striding into the small room and taking a seat on the opposite side of what was clearly Malfoy’s desk.
“Nothing,” Draco said, and he lifted his robe down from the hook by the door. “Let’s get going. Maybe I’ll let you watch the cricket after we eat.”
Harry did indeed love posh soaps, and if that were all they needed, then he wouldn’t be feeling so anxious about it. But that’s not all that was needed. Not by a long shot.
“Okay,” Harry said with great amusement. “So I’m the horribly unattractive one in the relationship. My mistake. It does make me wonder what you keep me around for, given how sexy you are, especially since I’m practically blind and possibly a homophobe as well. I’d’ve thought you could do better.”
Potter pulled back eventually, and Draco realised he was pressed against the wall of his flat, the front door wide open for anyone to see him in all his glory, with particular bits of glory tenting lewdly at the front of his towel.
Potter didn't move. He didn't kiss back. Draco opened his eyes and saw stunned green looking back at him, eyes shiny and blinking in what must have been shock. Draco pulled away in horror. What had he
An umbrella with a jewelled peacock handle. “Now, come on, that could come in handy...Potter...Potter!”
? He should have asked Malfoy to bring some lube. He seemed to recall lube had been important, and Harry cursed himself silently for not having sorted his sex life out well before now.
“Maybe he was swearing because you look like you’ve just walked off the pages of a very specific type of themed dirty magazine.”
She rolled her eyes. “You’re not scary. You’re like a grumpy kneazle at best. Potter came back from the dead, and killed a basilisk when he was like twelve. If that doesn’t frighten yet arouse you, there’s something wrong.”
Harry listened to Malfoy’s voice and tried to focus. He remembered how the men in the club had reacted to him. Men who didn’t know a thing about him - they weren’t reacting to the Boy Who Lived. They didnt give a fuck about the mark on his forehead - probably just thought it was the product of a wild night out with the lads in his youth, a few stitches and a funny story to re-tell on pub night. He looked at himself again. He liked his hair, sort of. He liked the colour, anyway, and that it made him look like his dad. His dad was handsome and confident and full of cheek, everything Harry didn’t feel. He’d like to be more like his dad, to channel that confidence, the magnetic quality that he and Sirius had seemed to have in spades.
Well, once again I sailed directly past the 50 word target without even attempting to stop. Prompt 'graveyard'.
“That was a nice touch, by the way,” Potter gestured toward the enormous hourglass filled with glittering gemstones in the very centre of the ballroom. As donors dropped donation pledges written on squares of white card into the collection box in front of the hourglass, a corresponding shower of gems fell into the lower bulb. “Just like Hogwarts.”
At work, it’s mostly fine. Work’s busy, distracting enough that he doesn’t get lost watching Malfoy do stuff. He’s so tired by the end of the day that he’s content to go home, and open the windows to let the heat of the day out, make dinners of salad and grilled fish, and beer so cold it makes his teeth hurt. Being alone doesn’t bother him so much, in summer. It’s too hot to think about that, and he’s weary enough that a cool bath is all he needs to send him off to an undisturbed sleep.
“Everything,” Draco said, raw, and felt a spike of panic. That was giving away more than he intended.
he could almost hear Malfoy whisper, and Harry felt his heart pick up. He thrust it gently in, then out.
“Spexy?” There would have been a time when Harry might have at least tried not to let on how funny he found Draco’s relentless rinsing - he was simply incapable of stopping himself, even shagged out - but those days were long past. These days, he simply laughed. These days, life was pretty bloody good.
“You say ‘tried’, which implies I was unsuccessful,” Harry looked pointedly around their kitchen, then at Draco’s engagement ring, and back at his own. Draco narrowed his eyes.
“Have you broken it?” Draco heaved the pack onto his shoulders, and began the hike across the damp sand. “Why is it making that noise?”
“I can appreciate that things may change between consenting adults. Maybe Harry’s not a good shag, maybe you’re just sick of him. There’s lots to be annoyed by, with our Harry. But don’t fuck Teddy over, Draco.”
“I had no idea you even knew how to use it,” Harry said, amazed. “Who taught you about the Sky box?”
Harry took a half step back, and raised a hand between them. “Hi - uh, thanks, I suppose, for that...offer. Erm, I’m actually just here with a friend and I’m not looking for any - sucking. Thank you.”
Harry had never actually been shopping for new clothes, unless you counted his first set of Hogwarts robes. It’d sounded weird when he'd told Hermione, but despite having access to his own money once he'd rejoined the magical world when he was eleven, getting himself some proper kit that actually fit him had never been high on his list of priorities, and frankly he'd felt slightly selfish anytime he'd thought about sorting himself out a nice pair of trousers, or a t-shirt that wasn't full of holes (or which was possibly actually a Dudley-shaped tent).
“There bloody is. It’s your ‘I’m going to get involved where I’m not required’ face. I’ve seen it many, many times.”
“I’m afraid you won’t want to marry me anymore after you see that room,” Harry blurted. Oh, god. That was embarrassing.
Martin gave Malfoy what appeared to be an almost warm smile, if he was capable of such a thing. He was enormous, with a neck as thick as one of his own meaty thighs, and he looked like he might burst out of his suit jacket with one unexpected sneeze. “Mr Malfoy, good to have you back. Are you joining us this evening?”
“Tea, please,” Potter said weakly, and he shuffled into the office and slumped into the guest chair, shoving the stack of orange files onto the desk as if he couldn’t wait another moment to relinquish them. Draco bit his lip in an effort to supress a smile, and busied himself with tea making duties. When the steaming cup was eventually in Potter’s ink-spattered hands, he finally seemed to cheer up, although only marginally.
Ginny rolled her eyes at Harry in the rear view. “And third and worst of all, you’re weirdly obsessed with the deer, and I’m genuinely afraid that one day you’ll be gored to death on the antlers of a disgruntled stag.”
“Oh, fuck - no, that’s not what I meant, Malfoy, Merlin. I was just asking, like, conversationally. Out of interest.
“I was hoping you’d do that,” Ron’s eyes lit up at the sight of the salad. “This is going to be perfect with my grilled chicken.”
“Good work, Potter.” If he’d had any breath himself, Harry might’ve complained, but that would be a much bigger exaggeration, and nobody would believe him, anyway, were there anyone other than the two of them here to witness it, because it was a fact widely known that there were few things Harry Potter enjoyed more than a nude and sweaty Draco Malfoy lying on top of him.
He counted on his fingers. “Ted’s room, and maybe two more on that same floor. They’ll just be the usual amount of dusty and creepy.”
Malfoy stretched, and Harry tried very hard not to look, with middling success. “You know, Potter, it’ll fall off if you’re not careful.”
Without moving his hands or reaching for his wand, or so much as blinking, Potter had the office door slam shut, and the lock slid home with an audible click shortly after. “Any other objections?” Potter’s voice was soft and a little rough. Draco shook his head once, and closed his eyes as Potter’s lips met his.
But now he was looking. Harry was looking at himself the way Malfoy had made him look at the other people at the club. Harry wasn't a skinny little boy anymore, even though, somehow, until just now, he’d still sort of felt like one. He pressed one hand to his belly. He looked.
Harry snorted. “Give it a rest, you’ll give me ideas and I don’t have time for an extra long shower this morning.”
come in handy. I’ve never told you Malfoy, but I have a hidden talent. I can guilt people into donating money to charities. It’s kind of amazing, actually.”
Ron looked sadly at his extra sausage. “I’ve a terrible feeling this is going to put me off my meal.”
“It’s just a tie,” Harry said, hesitant, and he reached up to unravel said tie from the prim bow he’d belligerent fastened around his shaggy mess of hair. “Technically, I’m meeting his stupid dress code.”
Harry paged through until he found the list of overnight guests, Narcissa, Andromeda, and the rest, and sighed. If he was going to be stuck at home all week, then he should probably make a start on some of the clutter while Draco wasn’t around to see the full extent of it.
“Let’s put it this way, Malfoy, even I noticed when you rocked up looking like that,” Ron was clearly deeply amused.
Potter had a dark flush slowly crawling up his throat. “You’re telling me you just spontaneously decided to wear that specific top, unprompted.”
Harry put his cup down and leaned forward, his elbows on his knees and his face in his hands. “Sorry. I’m - I’m having a bit of a strange week. Today in particular.”
“You could always delegate the biting stuff to the fieldwork team, sir. I know Rosewarne has some experience with biting toilets, and I was around for the tea cup epidemic of 2002.”
There was a short pause, and then Malfoy gave Harry the thumbs up with one hand, while picking up his quill in the other. “You did? Mail order, you say? What was the customer name?” Malfoy scratched the details out on the back of the list of suppliers. “Hmmm, doesn’t seem to be the same name as the person who came in to see me. Well, look maybe they got it as a gift, I’ll see what happens when I speak to them again...what’s that? Oh, why was it being returned?” He looked at Harry, and casually dropped his gaze again to Harry’s mouth, and over his chest, and down to his thighs. “The guy said it wasn’t stiff enough.” He gave Harry a slightly wicked smile, and Harry’s heart thudded suddenly. “Right-o, well thanks Les, I’ll send the fellow in your direction and you can argue the refund policy with him if he shows up. All the best – bye.”
“Yeah, somewhere,” Ginny said through a mouthful of Draco’s wine gums. “She’s probably off making a flower crown for her lion headdress, or something.”
Draco kissed him then, leaned in and brushed his lips very gently over Harry’s mouth, then ran the tip of his tongue along Harry’s bottom lip. Harry could smell mandarincello, and then with a very small sound of pleasure, Draco tilted his head, and kissed him properly.
“Send the fucking thing before you wimp out.” Adrenaline raced through him, leaving butterflies in his belly and a wild flush blooming up his throat. He tapped the screen, got the photo attached to a message, and at the last moment, added ‘for your collection’ below it.
If there’s one thing that could drag Harry’s attention from his godson, it’s Malfoy. Harry looks at him, Malfoy’s ramrod-straight back, and tense shoulders, and dark brows drawn down in a frown. He’s pretty sure none of that’s for Teddy. Malfoy loves Teddy, melts for Teddy. Malfoy being soft and gorgeous and gentle over Teddy is about seventy-five percent of the reason Harry’s internal organs have felt like they’re falling down a long flight of stairs every time Harry looks at him lately. The rest of it has a lot to do with the way Malfoy fills out a Falcons jersey.
“That hardly seems fair,” Ginny said, taking her seat. “I assume we’re talking about Malfoy, are we? Even Malfoy deserves a good riding every now and then, surely.”
“Harry only left because he knew he could and the department would be in safe hands with you and me.”
“You’re a daft wanker, is what you are. If you’d only be more honest and less of a bloody wally, you could have all that with him.”
“Then I guess I’ll be seeing you at the round-robin.” It wasn’t really a question. Draco’s throat felt tight, like he’d swallowed something too large and it was stuck part-way down.
Draco looked around in confusion. “Darling, this is a four storey townhouse. It’s practically all bedrooms. We only need to use seven of them, I’m positive there’s seven spare rooms around.”
Her eyes widened. “You’re going to talk to him?” Of course not. Draco is a coward of the highest order, always had been. There’d be no talking to Potter, telling him that this thing they’d been doing together was done, thanks for your time and all the very best. It’s not that he thought Potter would be attached, or hurt - quite the opposite. Potter would probably laugh at him. He’d probably just rotate another blond into the routine, and barely register the difference.
). He was also allowed to keep the chest of baby clothes, which he insisted upon while blushing furiously. They hadn’t had a proper talk about kids, but Harry wanted them, and he wasn’t ready to let go of the baby stuff just yet. Just in case. Draco didn’t object, but he looked as if he had a few questions about it.
“Draco, honestly, let’s just forget about that room! We can put Pansy and Ginny in together and just tell them to stop being so ridiculous. And, McGonagall probably won’t even stay. Or we can put Luna up in that little hotel - she’ll love that!” His prior sense of calm had left him. Maybe he’d packed it in the box with the half-dozen non-stick saucepans, or the one with all the fitness stuff. It was probably pressed between that DVD of abdominal work outs, and Joe Wick’s
Pansy pursed her lips, bright, cherry red to match her long nails, and the half-dozen maraschinos floating in her rum and ginger. “Well, what are you going to do, then?” Like it was that simple. Identify the problem, formulate a plan, enact the plan. Problem solved.
Malfoy confirmed that galleons were indeed fine, and Harry wondered again how it was going to look submitting an invoice for anatomically correct rubber genitals in his next petty cash claim.
into every unsafe crime scene in London. Always shouting at me, after.” Malfoy took a resentful mouthful of beer. “Prick.”
Harry felt a great surge of irritation rise within him. This sort of crap was precisely why he had such utter contempt for Throttlebottom. “Well the problem is, Ron, that there are actual dangers to Muggles and magical-kind that we’re trying to resolve, the kind where actual people are at risk of actual bodily harm, and not just a little embarrassment. The system doesn’t operate in a way which allows the person who complains the loudest to receive priority service just so we can make him go away!”
“He morphed himself a set of wings, and took a running leap off the cottage roof,” Andromeda said behind him. “Landed rather heavily, to his shock. Victoire thought he’d been killed, and almost couldn’t speak through her hysteria to tell me he was flat on the dirt after taking out the hydrangeas.”
He pushed the jeans further down his legs - nice thighs, thick and strong. The hair on his legs glints in the low light. He likes this part of the body too, loved the contrast of hard muscle and softness in Ginny, and the tight pull of expensive fabric in Malfoy’s trousers as he lounged against the brick outside the club. Running a hand up his inner thigh, he enjoys the gentle scratch of the hair, the contrast of muscle under soft skin. He cups his balls, rubs them gently and rolls them in the flat of his palm. He never takes his time like this. Never watches himself like this. Never appreciates himself like Malfoy told him he should.
After several long moments of panting, one arm flung over his eyes, Harry Summoned his mobile and tapped out a brief message before he lost his nerve again.
“Yeah, well...I stopped seeing him a couple of months ago, like I said. I was trying not to get hurt, because I was certain he didn’t want anything more than a casual fuck. I didn’t know how to deal with it, so I just started avoiding him everywhere all the time until he got the idea.”
, and every year at your birthday drinks Seamus makes a smart comment about it. ‘Oh, looks like Harry’s still not wearing the face off Malfoy, then’,” Hermione’s voice was high and her Irish accent was terrible. “Well. We’ll see who’ll be having the last laugh at the pre-Christmas shindig this year, won’t we,” she finished, tearing a bit of
The bedroom was blessedly silent once more. Draco sighed. Rolled over, clasped the topmost pillow, and closed his eyes again. He pulled the eye mask down, and tried to recapture the dream — perhaps he could slip back into it after all…
Draco looked from Granger down to his tumbler of gin and cucumber. He hated that, too. “Unlike Socrates, I’m not quite ready to sacrifice my cock to Asclepius, unfortunately.”
“I know,” Harry said, kissing his hand again. “I promise I’ll make it even harder when you get home.”
Malfoy hummed  slightly to himself, and waved his wand to clear away the page. Picking up the quill again, he scrawled ‘inventory’ and then listed the specifications again, less the serial number. A list of three items appeared on the parchment, and Malfoy turned it toward Harry, who leaned forward and pushed his glasses up on his nose.
“And what are you imagining doing with those lovely thighs and long fingers, hmm?” Orange Singlet caught his eye. Harry licked his lips again, a nervous impulse, and Orange Singlet gave him a slow smile.
“Potter, I’m starting to get really concerned about what else you’ve been hoarding. You promised me no jars of piss or bags of hair.”
Blaise stuck his head in the Floo. “Yes, what the fuck is going on, Draco? It’s seven. It’s Sunday. You know what I call this time.”
"You're welcome. But it isn't me you should be thanking. Its Alma Fivepennies you need to say it to."
Potter stayed still, his hands hanging by his sides, open. “I’ve been attracted to you for a long time. And I respect you, as a fellow Auror. You’re fun to spend time with. When you’re with Ted, I - you’re good with him. Loving.” Potter was still flushed, but he stood his ground and never looked away from Draco. “I didn’t think you wanted anything more than sex, with me, and that was fine, but over time I realised I was falling for you -
Malfoy swigged his pint again, and tried to sneak his hand back into the packet. “Just what I need on my birthday.
“I used to be jealous when you two were partners.” Harry was mostly on his stomach, his face in the pillows.
a prude. He was just, well, comparatively inexperienced. He really hadn’t had the opportunity to fiddle about with his bits or anybody else’s, not during school, anyway, unless you counted Ginny. Which absolutely did count, and she’d been very good about working through his sexual identity crisis, and was not at all judgey when he’d asked for a finger in the bum while she was sucking him off. And they’d had very nice sex together, actually, very nice sex indeed, not that it had stopped the inevitable break up. Harry glared at the results of yet another inconclusive test on the dongs. It was probably a good thing that this whole dildo crisis had come about, actually. Not for Throttlebottom, obviously, but maybe for Harry. He needed to get past this shyness and hesitance about sex, and having it with someone other than just himself, alone. Had he seriously been single for
