Ron moved his rook. Malfoy moved his pawn. Ron moved his Knight. Malfoy Moved his queen. Ron moved his Pawn.
“I'll give you extra kisses” Ron planted his hands on either armrest and leaned close to Hermione's face. She was blushing all the way to her ears.
“What the hell are you doing?” Malfoy scoffed, the playful insulting nature of the comment made Harry slightly nostalgic.
Malfoy offered no rebuttal as he returned to his book. But surprisingly enough he didn't ask Harry to leave. Maybe he knew Harry didn't give up that easily, or maybe, just maybe, he enjoyed the company.
“Draco!” he pushed further into the common room. “Play me in chess, I haven't had a worthy opponent in days.”
Harry and Draco sat in silence drinking their tea. It had been several days since they’d met like this. It felt strange to say but Harry kind of missed it. Not the waking up from terrifying nightmares part, but the gentle air that the kitchens carried was something Harry would always love.
“I hope so, I don’t know if I can handle seeing it all broken down” Ron sighed, and looked at his feet. The compartment fell into a comfortable silence.
Finally classes were over, Harry flopped down on the common room couch. He was completely exhausted.
Had she really noticed that? Was she just making it up? Why would she even make something up like that? Harry was positively puzzled by the entire interaction.
He should look away. But instead he smiles. Malfoy raises an eyebrow before getting wrapped back into his conversation with Pansy.
Harry startled awake once more, he was used to this. He would throw open his curtains and Malfoy would either be sleeping or gone.
“Yay!” He showered her with kisses. Still leaning over her, he looked positively ridiculous due to his height but the moment was sweet and Harry couldn't help but smile.
“Yes, I'm sure” he reassured her planting a loving kiss on her forehead “we have to get to the train.”
Now this was getting out of hand. Harry had probably done similar things with Ron and Hermione a million times before, but something about Draco’s long delicate fingers brushed up against his face sent Harry into a fit flustered embarrassment.
“You really don't have to im sure its fine”  Harry complained as Draco aggressively proofread his essay.
“Normally I don't meddle in Harry's love life, he gets there on his own eventually.” Hermione rattled on, “but you and him are being especially dense and I just want you all to be happy.”
As they rounded the corner the large intimidating castle came into view. And it looked nearly perfect. As if it had never been blown to pieces in the first place. The cascading towers reached far into the sky, and the windows glowed with the warmth of golden light. Harry was beyond surprised with the reconstructions.
When they got back to the dorms Hermione plopped herself down at one of the tables, she mentioned something about essays, or maybe homework? Harry wasn't listening, he was dedicating his full attention to a particularly tricky chess game. He knew he stood no chance beating Ron but he was going to try anyway.
“memory loss is common, he will remember with time what has happened. “ It was not severus who answered but rather the woman who stood near the door. Harry hadn’t heard he come in, and it made him bristle, a low growl building up in the back of his throat.
Dudley had changed for the better while Harry had been gone, but it didn't mean his aunt or uncle did. In fact, while the violence towards him had stopped, the words hadnt. Harry didn't even know his aunt or uncle knew some of the words they called him, if the pain would lessen over time.
"I know what it's like being forced to do everything in a house, you should help him out more Dudley. And maybe sneak the kid a hamburger or something, he looks like a good stiff wind could knock him on his arse."
“I think.. I think he would love it. That is a brilliant idea. Now, come to bed love. “ She set her hand on his arm, the mans eyes turning to her as he sighed.
Declan didn't say anything as he worked, knitting the wounds back together , his eyes every so often glowing blue. Coraline helped when she could, lifting the boy with a gentleness the warrior didn't often show.
Looking up, harry was barely able make out the blond hair, something inside of him reaching out to the woman whose wide eyes blurred as he passed out.
Seeing it empty, Dobby didn’t sense the magic in the book, he only thought of the young boy and his writing practice. Perhaps having his own journal would help his shakey hand, dobby only thought of how to help him.
He didn’t see any glimpses, but moving the thread lovingly, he moved it to wrap it around the gold one, seeing the grey strengthen almost immediately. Azure seemed to have no problem as the grey tinged his own brilliant gold as he accepted the bond into himself.
“And it will do it.. All of it?” She looked at the vial with wide hopeful eyes. If they could heal harry of the damage done to his body, she might be able to fix the bond she had severed.
"Someone has bound a child in those awful bounds, Severus. He's lived with them for over five years…" She turned to throw her arms around his neck, burying her head into his chest. Every sob made his heart hurt.
“Of course. What do you want to know?” She set down her tea, assuming by his face he had many questions.
This time, it was worse. He had never been held under the curse for so long, but then again, he'd never seen his father so angry. He had presented human, even theo had known he wouldn't but he couldn't tell his father that. His mother was a Draconi, he knew at best he would be a halfling, maybe even get lucky and be considered a dragimi.
That was what all her tests had confirmed. Not that she believed it, not that severus did. Her mate had stayed in his lab for the entirety of the weekend, not coming out even once. Not even when her husband and their alpha had come home.
But he had grown a foot, now a good six feet and still growing. His hair, while always white blond, was longer and swept back into a low pony tail. The color was now the color of the clouds, a stark white compared to before. His eyes blue and stormy grey mixed together in a dance around his pupil. They would become almost bright silver when transformed.
The other blond sometimes came to peak into the doorway, but she never came in, not once. Sometimes it made him ache but having tom helped with the ache.
While he hated Draco as his alpha, he knew he would never kick him out of the mateship. Sighing, he ran a hand through his hair and nodded, finally after three days of fighting…
Declan with his deep blue eyes and freckles, red hair that never stayed put. His smile that calmed her, the voice that stopped henry and Calem from killing each other when they still went at it (even after fifteen bloody years; Coraline figured that boys never changed, even when they were men), the hands that healed.
"Master Declan be needings healer Narcrissa! Kinley being tolds to bring her back as soon as possible and with healings potions! " The elf bobbed its head up and down as she spoke, the floo activating behind severus as his wife walked through.
“NO! I won’t! I won’t… He has to be alive, I just… I just found him.” The agony in her son’s voice made Narcrissa wail, curling into herself. Severus and Axel both tried to comfort her but she had just lost another child, one she had for far to short of time. There was no balm for this wound.
“Yes Harry. You are the head of your mateship, the Potter Mateship. Do you know who your alpha is?” Harry knew it was a simple question, especially since he had learned a little more from Juniper.
“that means your instincts are working. The changing into one of our kind is an intimate thing, I doubt you will ever tell those closest to you anything either. I have yet to tell my Mateship, and I have been in it for almost thirty years. “ She patted his hand, before sighing. “You mentioned Azure? I only know one Guardian named Azure, and that is Azure Krang, head of the Krang family.”
It stayed that way for a good five minutes before he felt exhausted, his body struggling to keep up. But his hands weren’t shaking and he was achey but not in pain. Feeling hands slip under him, he was hauled up into the potions masters arms, carried back to bed.
“Should we just move him Narcrissa? We could set him up in the sunroom, its bigger and we could easily transform it into a bedroom. “ She thought for a moment of his words, the sunroom had huge windows and beautiful views. Dracos room had a view but nothing like the sunroom.
Almost as long as I have been unable to do magic.. Go rest now Harry, you handwriting is getting worse.
"Oh child… Severus! I found him!" She yelled, Theo covering his ears with his hands. He had become used to the silence of the room, and her voice was an echo in his brain. Why did she have to be so damn loud?
The sound of the door made theo flinch, wondering who exactly could be coming. The house elves just popped in and out of the room, and his father had been in once a week earlier. He hadn't seen hide or hair of his father since then, and he knew he wouldn't.
“A long time ago, the elves and the fae made a pact in blood. They made a child in both their greatness, a perfect child. His name, was Nivah. He was the first of his kind, and he was not the last. Every five or so generations, a family with creature blood, of either elven, veela or fae blood, will birth a child of Nivah. I am a child of Nivah. You are as well. “ Harry shook his head, stepping away further.
So, as most of you know, I dropped this story as I wasn't happy with the direction I was going with it. But about a week ago, I hinted that I was bringing it back. Welllll... I have! Go on and check out These Blind Truths have Blind Ambitions!! It is the brainchild of this story and the planned sequel and will basically be the same plotline but with added goodies. I hope everyone enjoys it!
" Then his creature is making a familiar mateship." They weren't unheard of, it being the only sound way of helping a creature with no familiar bonds or very broken ones to grow. They were replacements to the parent bonds, and usually were made of a preexisting mateship.
“Fine! You can be my alpha until we figure something else out. And damnit, Malfoy, I never said I was going to kick you out. But that doesn’t mean I wont if you don’t change your ways.” He waggled his finger at him, reminding himself of mrs. Weasley. “No remarks, not one. Or I swear I will make you suffer.
Writing to tom was really the only highlight of his days, not well enough to go out. The nice woman promised him that soon he would be able to venture out around the castle, especially when her son returned from his trip. She had gotten a pinched look on her face when she told him gently that he wouldn’t bother harry, making the boy think that whoever her son was, it wasn’t someone he got along with.
Closing his eyes, Harry felt the need to sleep push its way into the forefront of his mind. With a small gasp, the man moved him so his head was laying in his lap, carding his hands through his hair. He was so close to sleep when he knew.
The last one was weak, and grey. Unlike the other threads, it was limp when he touched it. But he did get feedback, he just didn’t like the feedback he got.
Looking up at the Dragimi, he raised a hand to bring him closer, Theo crossing the space in seconds. Dropping onto his knees, he brought both the dead submissive and his alpha closer, feeling Dracos breath on his face.
"I should take them off, at least maybe he will have a chance." Bindings of hate was what scared him, it..
The eggs were cooking slow, the heat down as harry made sure not to burn the toast. It was hard, with his aunt hovering to make sure he didn't take a bite and his uncle announcing his hatred of fags. He could see Dudley gripping the edge of his seat, his cousin trying not to lose it. Harry almost felt pity for the bigger boy.
" do we have to do ma'am?" He whined. He still didn't know the strange woman's name, only that she sometimes reminded him of draco.
“I assume he will be here as soon as he can then. A warrior in a Nivah Mateship is never far from the submissive, but as far as I know he is a quite busy man. “She gave him an endearing smile, reminding him of Mcgonagall.
Sliding out of the bed, he took a few unsure wobbly steps, wincing at the pain it caused him. Another few steps and he was halfway there, regretting his choice at once when he felt arms loop around his waist and he was helped to the chair he wanted. Sighing in bliss as he sat down, Harry looked up to thank his helper when his mouth ran dry.
Familiar: This is family, parents, siblings, relatives, godparents. Sometimes a familiar mateship can be chosen, but that is on the rare case that either the orignal familiar mateship is dead or abusive. A familiar mateship, like a soul one, is instant and can be painful during the first stages. Stage one: the binding, which usually forms at touch. Stage two: protection, the familiar creature involved will become protective over the center point of the bond. Stage three: Ritual to seal the bond, or in the case of Harry, magical sealing.
Azure didn’t say anything, instead he touched the side of Harry’s head, before reaching back and pushing the door open.
Death was preferable to being free, not when he was serving a Veela high councilman like his master. Or the beautiful healer, Narcrissa. Or his slightly scarier master who seemed to disappear at all manners of the day.
Two, he was warm, really warm and could smell peppermint and something spicy and woodsy all around him. It reminded him of Christmas, hot chocolate mixed with candy canes and the fire going in the common room.
Getting up, Harry stretched, his bones popping. For once, he didn't feel sick, didn't feel broken. His uncle hadnt touched him this summer yet, and he only had a few days left before he could go back home, to his real home. His excitement was dulled however, by the ache he got when he thought of returning to the castle.
“He was being abused, and is also a bound Nivah. “His father spoke slowly, and Draco felt a different type of anger rise up. But it was nothing compared to what he felt at his fathers next words.
"I know, it feels good. " This man kept running his hands through his hair, a small smile gracing his face. Shadows danced in front of them, the darkness of night reaching their little meadow. Looking away from the man and to the moon, which had moved surprisingly fast, he stared at the ominous glow it gave off.
Another growl added to his, from the other side of himself where the still sleeping slytherin had mimicked his mates sound. Harry cocked an eyebrow, before he very unceremoniously pushed the sleeping slytherin off. The sound of laughter coming from draco shocked his own chuckle from him, Severus already massaging his brow.
“You should pick one of the lost for the second. They are Gaurdians who Nivah did not make through the transition into Nivah. They are quite lonely people. “ He knew already he would, and made an appointment to go with draco to the council whenever they could.
It felt staged. Like he had been meant to hear what he had when he had. But if there was one thing he was good at it... It was hiding.
He had gotten them on "Eye-sore" and "Neighbors". It was worse to be seen with the bars than to be seen with an owl as a pet.
Severus pushed his way into the room, followed closely by his mates, Lucius eyes widening as he saw his sons friend. He had never seen such cruelty, even the death eaters had usually killed their victims, not left them to deal with the slow death the crucio brought. Watching his mates work, Lucius went to work, finding the Nott family will.
“Oh that’s… What?” He looked up at his mother, shock running through him with a little bit of an edge. Harry Potter, fucking Potter was in his home. He felt his creature rise, his eyes freezing into hard silver as he asked again.” What?”
“We are creatures Harry, like Veela, or Dragimi. Vampires and Werewolves. “ He looked up before sighing and gesturing to the door. “If you do not go now, Harry, you will never become one of us. “
"Sweet bloody merlin… " Declan mumbled, his hands moving to the boys forehead. As they got close, he jerked as if shocked, the boys magic thrashing violently underneath his hands. And the magic of someone else, something else. It curled around his hands and pulled, the taste of fear flickering across his magic.
Setting down tea, coffee and Dudleys smoothie, Harry scoffed down his toast and water before hurrying outside before his aunt could hit him with the spoon she had been eyeing. The day proved to be a hot one as he got to work, picking up the sheers and starting in.
This chapter can be skipped! But I wouldn't suggest it. This entire chapter is on the different creatures you'll see and the bindings. And also mateships. Basically everything that might confuse you is explained)
" how did you do harry?"She soothed, reaching for the mess of a paper. He looked unsure before allowing her to look.
"Not a child.." He mumbled, his hand pausing in his carding before restarting when the boy shifted in his sleep.
“What’s going on? Move, that is my mother in there!” Draco had come with theo at the sound of his mothers wails, getting angry when Henry had tried to stop him. Seeing the Veela in his eyes, Henry let him through, knowing he would regret it later. Letting such a young boy see someone dead was a cruel thing, but he was an alpha, he needed to know what death looked like.
When the last of the skin had knitted itself together, Coraline pulled back, her body shaking and her eyes on her mate. He was shaking for a different reason, her submissive practically steaming with anger. His hand lay on his stomach, where the first child they had was growing.
"Ill get us tea. And call Calen. " She told him, brushing her fingers lovingly across the boys head. His magic, settled but still wild, brushed back reaching and tangling with her own.
“Mother, what… “Draco started to ask when he came into the room, his heart wrenching into his throat and cutting off his words. He didn’t want to believe it, neither did Theo, who stood a few feet behind him. Both of the boys felt sick in places deep in the stomachs, touched by the death of someone they knew.
“DAMNIT HARRY!” Draco had been trying so hard, but it had been an hours since Harry’s heart had stopped. The others had long since given up, Coraline reduced to a heap of sorrow, as so was his mother. Theo stood near the bed, looking like he’d been stabbed in the heart.
It was nice not shaking, even if he had suddenly become a little meeker as he remembered more. He didn’t talk to anyone, except for tom, who had been quite cross with him when he had told him what had happened.
"See I told you Vernon, the boy is asleep, no funny buisness to be had." His aunt sneered as she stared at Harry. They had come to check on him, well actually to make sure he wasn't misbehaving.
"This child probably has never had a restful night in his life." Declan whispered, as his hand carded through harrys hair. The binding of fear always made things hard, Declan knew from his own work with people who had them done. It was mostly adults, who had come in with the bindings from some stupid fued. Bindings of fear was torture, of the most cruel kind.
Soul mateships can shift at anytime, an alpha can easily become a warrior or a beta, but a submissive will never become more than that.
Seeing his mother, he smiled at her, showing his perfectly white teeth as he bound over to her, his voice much deeper as he swept her up, burying his face into her neck.
It had been three days, three days since harry had woken up, groggy and his head hurting quite a bit. He had been confused and hadn’t remembered much, even if he had started to get those memories back. Like the fact that he had been beaten within an inch of his life by his uncle. And he had been a shaking mess until recently.
Nivahs magic had to be bound, it was to wild to unpredictable. It lashed out dangerously and killed most who dare upset the creature. So in order to save face, Nivahs were bound at two or one years old, by the parents or siblings of the child. It was a grand celebration, with fun and cake. The binding date was like a second birthday. And it would be until they were seven and the magic of the binds was broken.
“It’s time son…” Lucius said finally, it had to be done. He wouldn’t let his son suffer like his wife had, working on someone who would not waken until the body started to decay. He had to be the one to stop this.
" He better master. He eat little, but mimsy know he don't eat much. Dobby taken liking to the boy, he often be talking with him. His hands do shake but little boy don't mind. He sleeps lots. "She started to wring her hands in her tea cosy dress. " He has nightmares and calls for his mates. His creature be fighting to get out. Is.. Is little boy almost better enough to be fully healed?" Even house elves knew the cruelty of having a creature bound away.
He could almost hear his aunt screeching about it, maybe hearing his uncle saying how the man should wear a mask.
Soon so had his Papa. He wasn’t supprised his Dad wasn’t present, Axel stayed far away if he could. Every since his brother’s death, the man had been a shadow that he couldn’t catch.
“Our kind?” Harry took a step back as the man laughed again. He had an amazing laugh, it made harry want to melt onto the floor and whine. It was utterly embarrassing.
They sat in silence, watching the moon as it moved across the sky, Harry wishing the moment would not end. But the feeling that it would nagged at the back of his mind. He had to wake up…
But Nivah's were so much different. They thrived on familiar magic, and their bonds were always so soaked in it that the creature could thrive while being bound, making the seven year old mark easier. Usually, at seven, child regressed to the age of the binding , which was usually three or four, but it was easy to fix. The child would be retaught everything, at a fast pace.
Not beta'd, I know its a small chapter but we meet another one of Harrys mateship. Azure Krang. More will come up about him in the next few chapters, and we finally meet tom and draco in the next chapter..
“Where will you be? I am sure this is all in my head. “ Harry knew this was a dream, he had remembered taking the potion with Snape and then falling asleep. He had been in the manor, he didn’t know who’s but he knew he had been safe. This white hall was so different than anything he had ever imagined.
“All of it. Never damage, the immune system compromise. Even the headaches. “ Severus seemed to finally notice Draco as he took a step forward and pressed in for a hug to the young half transformed veela. “You’ll get to see him in about an hour. Let us heal him more. “
Veela: Veelas are creatures of harpy decent. When angered, they have talons and beaks, controlling fire elements with ease. A female veela has an alure to attract possible mates, while a male veela has an extra sense of perception that warns them when they are in danger. It is considerable harder for a female veela to find a mate, as the extra perception of a male lets them know immediately when they are in the presence of their mate. (If they have reached the age of majority which is twelve)
But if a child's parents died before the binding date, a new bind of true faith could be made. It was usually done by a god parent or a relative, so the familiar magic was still present but never as strong. The child usually never made it to the seventh birthday, usually they broke the binds much earlier.
“Very good, Young one. I see some of the knowledge of the gate has passed with you. That is how we greet one another, especially a male to a female. “She explained, before reaching out for his hand. Ignoring Draco’s growl, she grabbed his hand and moved it to her shoulder, before moving her hand to his. Bowing her head, he copied her before she explained again. “And this is how two submissives greet each other. “
It tore the creature apart, it was the punishment of the most cruel and ugly kind. It was like the dementors kiss, to have to live with a broken creature. They had caught it in time, his mateship bonds wouldn't be affected. If they had been a year later, then Declan wouldn't be able to do anything.
The man watched his young mate go,turning his head to the forest at the edge of the clearing,speaking to the one who watched.
They brought him home, along with the Declan mateship. They gave him dracos room, hoping when the boy woke up, that he would be more at ease. They had been told their guest rooms were... Cold.
As he burnt his professor to a crisp, he had felt an agony that reached deep inside of him and clawed its way up. It hurt, so bad, like fire and ice meeting for the first time. He hadn't passed out from magical exhaustion like the Nurse had told him (why hadn't he been sent to a real hospital? He had read up on Magical Exhaustion and it was no joke), he had passed out from the pain. Waking up in the hospital, with all those gifts, that had seemed so set up, even Dumbledore walking in at the moment he woke.
Mateships: There are four different types of mateships, the first being the most common. Familiar, the second being Soul, the third being warrior, and the fourth being the most rare, death.
Harry had been so small, Severus hadn't recognized him at first. Not without the scar. But when he had, he pulled him from coralines arms and burried his face into the small boy. He had lost control of his creature, which had never happened except for in anger.
"Kinley has been told to get Mistress Narcrissa! Mistresss Narcrissa needed by Master!" Severus knew the elf, a small pale thing with long arms and dark burgundy pillow case. Seeing one of the masters of the Malfoy house, Kinley pushed past the house elf trying to stop her as she wobbled over.
"Your getting better. Now, time for Latin. " They had started lessons the day after he woke up, four days ago. He had been restless, feeling fine hopped up on pain potions and calming draught.
It was raining the day dobby decided to break the rule, sneaking into the large library that held the darkest of dark books but also the most informative. It was there he was drawn to the farthest book case, to the small leather bound journal that was hidden between two rather large tomes.
Hmm.. Tell me Harry, does it bother you? To be compared to your father? I was once compared to my own, and I didn’t like it one bit.
Nivah: Nivah are a mixture of Fae and Elvish blood, usually dark elves but wood and winter can give blood as well. It is never from a copulation of the two races but a ritual of blood magic with was conducted several generations before hand. The magic takes up two six generations to build up, but Nivahs are always strong. They are even tempered and very intelligent, working off of fae knowledge which is given to them on the day of adulthood (Twelve for both Fae and elvish). Nivah have generally dark coloring, even wood and winter blooded, with jewel colored eyes (harrys emerald eyes). Winter Nivah have fairer skin and are the rarest to be born while wood have darker skin and dark have light skin with sharper features. (Harry is a winter nivah). The nivah are usually submissive, but on the rare occasion can be dominate (Alpha).
The argument they had been having was Draco’s place in the Mateship. He didn’t want the slimy bastard to be his alpha, he wished he could move Azure to the spot but a Nivah couldn’t be an alpha. They were to.. Tempermental. They were better suited as Submissives and scholars, or in azures case, gaurdians.
Harry kept his promise, writing in the diary slowly, his handwriting improving greatly as he took pleasure in talking to his new friend. He hoped he could call tom a friend, even if the older man or well boy sometimes wouldn’t answer, drawn into brews of silence.
Harry looked proudly at the almost illegible handwriting, it looking more like a five year olds first attempts at writing than his twelve year old self. He contemplated on showing it to the nice lady when it faded, sending a shockwave of disappointment and confusion through him.
“What was it like? Going through the door?” Juniper asked, waiting with a calm face as he balked. He didn’t know why her asking that made him… Angry? Hurt? Protective.
Draco Lucius Malfoy looked different from the last time his mother would have seen him. The last she saw of him he had been covered in sweat and in so much pain from his transformation. She hadn’t been able to comfort him, he had been taken so fast. But that was the way things were for a male Veela, they transformed and then they went to train.
Nivah, because of the magic of a familiar and how they grew, didn't regress, infact they became smarter. They noticed things more, became more and more even tempered. The dark elves were gentle and kind creatures, nivah (which was born from fae and elvish) were no different.
“We have all missed you. Severus would be here, but he’s been holed up in the lab. I don’t know if you got my owl, Darling, but we have two guests. “ This perked him up a bit, he hadn’t got the owl. That happened sometimes, the others would hide his letters from him to teach him some humility.
“Now harry what can you tell me of Mateships? Of creatures. “ Harry started to tell her everything he knew, which wasn’t much. Only the little bit that the nice lady had told him, and some of the creature wars. Juniper didn’t interrupt, except for a few times to correct him or tell him he was going good.
While harry didn't see himself as Gay, he knew he liked both girls and boys. He had caught himself with a small crush on Oliver Wood, and even on Flint after a match against slytherin. He had worried about being gay until he caught Oliver and Percy together after a match, snogging and going at it like rabbits. The wizarding world didn't seem to have a problem with it, seeing how something in their magic allowed for conception of the all important heir.
Then, he had met someone new. A woman with white gold hair, and eyes that shined like saphires. She had an almost dangerous air around her, but something inside of him screamed for the woman. She kept her distance mostly, looking at him with such a loving look he made a sound he had never made before.
“that is alright Harry, it is common to not recognize the bond. Close your eyes, I am sure you can feel Azure in your head am I correct?” he nodded, and she smiled. “Then let his bond lead you to your others. Follow it to the source.”
Maybe, your just a book, I don’t have to forgive you. But the lady says that I shouldn’t hold grudges, its bad. So yes, I forgive you.
"No. He's not. We tried. Flower tried but she says he needs a mate to ground him. And without a mate, and without his creature, we have no possibility of breaking those binds. " It made him furious.
" I've never seen so.. So many of them. Placed on a child no less. " His voice wobbled, his shaking hands come to push the hair from his face. The red locks just stubbornly came back but he barely seemed to notice. His eyes and face were drawn out, tired as he kept staring at the covered up child.
“Yes harry, you are a wizard. And yes your father was Potter. But you are also a NIvah, Harry James Potter, first of his name. You are the son of Margret and Percival, the Fae and Elf who gave blood to your line so you may become the son of Nivah you were meant to be. I am the son of Genviera and of Alfred, a dark elf and a spring Fae. I know it is confusing now, but it will make sense once you go through the door. “ He reached up to touch Harrys arm, but he shook his head at the last moment, pulling back.
The sound of pain released from her lips made declan look up in alarm. The boy had been stable, his magic soothed and calm. Normally, Declan would have left it at that, let the wizards deal with their hero. Send him back to the wizarding world with a harsh word and some checking up on. But then the boy made that sound and so had his mate.
A childs bond, it was supposed to be a celebration. When a child of any creature showed magic, they bound it to help the wizard magic to grow. If not then they were trained in the magic of their creature, and usually the wizarding magic wouldn't be as strong. Like in Coraline and Henry, who had never had a bond of that nature.
“You have to keep it down Harry. You won’t get better if you don’t. That’s it, calm.” His nice lady seemed to come out of no where as she started to card her hands through his hair. Gagging again, Harry looked up at them both with a whine, the hand still clamped around his mouth.
Henry and Calem. They both hated each other, couldn't stand the sight of the other. Their hatred was deep rooted into their brains that when she came along( and subsequently the other), they fought like warriors forgeting that she was the warrior of the mateship. Fate had a funny sense of humor, pushing the three of them together with the one entity that changed them all.
“I want to see him, now!” Draco’s mind was filled with images of the scrawny boy, with his eyes. He could only think of his enemy, broken and abused and it felt like death. He never wanted that for harry, thinking of his own baby brother and how painful it had been.
Warrior: Is a mateship belonging to the warriors of different mateships. They sign in blood to uphold their bond, and to protect their mates and their fellow warriors. This is usually issued by the alpha of the mateship.
Theo had never been locked in his room before, he'd always been aloud to roam around the house, so long as he stayed far away from his father and his new family. The Nott head had gotten a new wife the moment his old died, theos mother having died in child birth of the second child. Unlike theos birth, anthony Nott had demanded to be in the room, and had seen his wifes creature before she took her last breath.
Harry didn't know where he was. For days he had wondered, alone in bed and unable to really move. It had scared him at first, but then she was there. She was like... An angel from the bible, long blond hair and blue eyes. Beautiful blue eyes.
" No, Foreign is not. Were you able to feel what type? If he is one of the fallen, then foreign would be the elders…" Declan shook his head, the magic hadn't felt cold like the fallens did.
"BOY!" His uncle roared from the doorway, the alcohol dripping from his voice. This wasn't the first time his uncle had come home from work drunk, but never mad. Usually it was from a pint or two celebrating with a coworker but never mad. Harry knew something was wrong, so wrong when his uncle came into the room, his face purple.
Finding himself staring again, Harry didn't notice when the man looked back, staring back into the younger's face. It wasn't until that delighted laugh came up again that it shocked harry out of it, looking away in shame.
Fae: Fae are much like Elves, except they are healers and scholars. Fae rarely are submissive, rather they are healers and betas. The exception are the royal elves who are almost always submissive. Fae have lighter coloring with jewel colored eyes(Declans blue eyes).
Over the time of his winter break, Dudley had found his love of the same gender, of males instead of Females. And with that, came Daniel, his first boyfriend. Daniel was a sweet boy, who was into the martial arts and could kick anyones arse if they needed it kicked. But the boy also hated bullies with a passion, hence Dudleys change of hearts.
One second, she was wrapped around the child who had taken so much of her love and time. A child who reminded her so much of her Fredrick, reminded her of everything her mateship had lost. She had been watching him sleep, Severus not far from her as he paced. Everything had been okay, she had been watching the damage be slowly undone, checking his bonds and cooing at him whenever he shuffled in his sleep.
“I did it! I made it! “He rushed to Narcrissa’s side. Handing her the vial that had been in his hand, he seemed extremely proud of the yellow and blue mixture swirling in the almost grey vial.
Harry and Ron entered first. Later followed by Draco and Blaise. The room was circular with four beds equal distance around the room. It was decorated very similarly to the common room, lots of neutral colors not pertaining to a specific house. The room was warm and felt like he could make a home in it. their trunks had been placed at the foot of each bed. Draco’s was just as snobby and perfect as Harry could have imagined. Ron had already laid down and outstretched his legs onto the bed, but harry was far more transfixed by Draco.
If Harry was lucky Draco wouldn't even remember what happened, and he could take this secret to his grave.
“We were just uh-” he glanced at Malfoy who had a pleading look in his eyes “we were just getting some food from the kitchen.”
He snapped out of it and threw himself onto the bed. Running his hands through his unruly hair. “Should we get ready for bed” he asked, tilting his head to look at Ron. Still sprawled out on the bed. “Ron?” He asked again. “Damnit Ron” he pushed himself up.
His mind had wandered away from his homework and his eyes had fallen onto Draco’s hands. “Why do you wear the rings?” Harry questioned.
Because even though they were friends they weren't good friends. They weren't the friends who comfort each other, they were just two guys who drank tea together at ungodly hours of the morning.
They continued on several games after that, sometimes Malfoy caught the snitch, other times Harry did, sometimes he'd let Malfoy catch it just to see that smile again.
“Are you sure you packed everything?” Hermione inquired, smoothing over the wrinkles in Ron’s shirt.
But Harry was preoccupied by the blush that had completely covered his face. Whether Draco understood how attractive that position was is up for debate, but one thing was clear.
Draco seemed completely taken aback by the mere idea of getting a package from Mrs Weasley but his face was even better when he opened it to find a sapphire knitted sweater with a large silver D on the front.
Draco didn't seem to mind though. He followed Harry wherever he went, making snide remarks when he did something dumb.
It was busy and loud, the bartender scrambled to get them their drinks as fast as he could, Harry suspected he might have recognized him.
despite all of that it was great to see the Weasleys again. They were the closest thing he’d ever had to a family. And as if she could sense her name Molly Weasley approached harry.
He stepped into the kitchen, but Malfoy wasn't there. He wasn't disappointed, okay maybe he was a bit disappointed. He would have enjoyed a little company is all, but his own solace would have to do. He asked for a cup of tea and sat down at one of the tables.
“You too” he smiled. It was good to see Ron again. He’d been invited to the burrow several times over the summer, but he figured it might be awkward. Him and ginny had broken up only about a month ago and he figured being in such close proximity with her wouldn’t be great. Not to mention Fred and George weren’t too happy with him, and you don’t want to get on their bad side.
The feeling of lips on his was the biggest relief Draco had ever felt in his life. This kiss was softer than their first, slower, smoother. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s shoulders, pulling him down. The kiss was quick, like a promise. Neither of them felt the need to rush anything. They had all the time in the world.
“If you could follow me please” she guided them to what appeared to be a dead end “Hippogryph” she spoke. And a large wooden door materialized right in front of her, not unlike the entrance to the Room of Requirement.
It glinted golden in the light of the sunset and Harry knew Malfoy saw it too as they both took off spreading towards the small thing.
“Checkmate” he announced, leaping up from his seat triumphantly. “You walked right into that one mate”
“Ill be there” harry assured her. He was sure ginny and him would be okay by then. Fred and George were slightly more uncertain.
He slugged out of bed and pulled on an oversized sweatshirt. Only then did he realize Malfoys curtains were drawn back, he stepped a little closer expecting to see him sleeping. But the bed was completely vacant.
He rolled onto his back and spread his limbs out spread eagle, For a second Harry thought he might be hurt before he broke out into the biggest smile he’d ever seen on Malfoy's face.
“Well pardon me I didn't know I was in the presence of a god” He teased with an over the top sarcastic tone.
“According to Mcgonagall we 'aren’t allowed to try out for the teams but are free to play on our own time whenever the pitch is free’”
Lavender and Pansy were engrossed in what seemed to be a very interesting conversation Pansy had her elbows planted firmly on the table, resting her chin on the heels of her hands. She looked completely occupied by whatever Lavender was rattling on about. He swore he saw a little bit of adoration in her eyes, but he chalked that up to lack of sleep.
Whether forgetting was really what Draco wanted was up for later scrutiny but right now he had a Runes essay to write.
When they got back to the dormitories that night Harry nearly fell asleep in his clothes. And for the first night in a while, he didn't have a nightmare. Because it was a good day.
“Hermione!” Ron shot up from his seat and began showering her in affectionate kisses. Harry took it that their relationship had been going quite well.
“Oh ok ok” Hermione enveloped Harry and Draco in a big hug. “You two better not get in any trouble while I'm gone.”
There was a burst of excitement from everyone in the common room and before they knew it they were gathered on the pitch.
“It's a Weasley sweater” Harry sat down next to Draco. Pulling his own green sweater over his head. “She makes them for all her kids, and their friends”
Malfoy pushed ever so slightly ahead, clasping his hands around the ball and tumbling forward onto the grass.
“Potter and Malfoy can be seekers” Dean shouted, as the self appointed master of this operation. “Me and Ron will be Keepers and the rest Chasers”
“The Christmas spirit Draco” Harry exclaimed “holidays are a time for togetherness or some shit like that”
They had a regular conversation with Hermione, she spent most of it clinging to Ron’s side talking about homework. Harry’s eyes wandered the length of the table.
“Ron probably mentioned you or something,” Harry said, stuffing some of his chocolates into his mouth. “They're really comfortable, you should put it on”
“Hermione” Harry ran up and threw his arms around her small frame. Draco stood a few feet behind him looking rather unsure.
He hadn't mentioned his early morning tea with Malfoy. Partly because he didn't think Malfoy would be fond of it, and partly because he didn't want an onslaught of questions on why he was up so early anyways.
“wow” mumbled Ron. The great hall looked as though it always had. Four long tables position perpendicular to a long table raised slightly at the far end of the hall. Everything was lit by candles, and the ceiling still looked like the night sky.
Harry had gotten some chocolates from ron and hermione, and Draco had gotten a nice ring from his mother. He slipped it onto his finger to join the other ring Harry had never noticed before.
He climbed the steps to the astronomy tower. Harry had grossly underestimated the cold, He shivered as he perched himself on the edge of the balcony.
Malfoy was sitting on his bed, leisurely reclined on his headboard. He'd taken a break from his book to glance at Harry apprehensively, but quickly lowered his eyes when Harry met them. But the small flustered expression when Harry took off his shirt didn't go unnoticed. He angled his chest towards the wall as he pulled on his pajamas.
The day had continued on in a similar manner. classes were taken with the entire eighth year. Ron and Hermione were cute. Pansy and Lavender sat next to each other. Draco sat in the back. All in all it was an ok day.
Harry tilted his head to the side and was face to face with Malfoy, his chest heaving up and down, cheeks flushed, mouth in a wide grin. And for the second time in his life, Harry thought Malfoy was beautiful.
He was laughing, infectious, sweet, laughing. Harry felt a little dizzy, he collapsed down next to Malfoy and began an infectious laugh of his own.
he slipped back into his compartment, and stood in his place completely stunned. “i think Malfoy was just…Nice?”
“Oh speaking of christmas!” Hermione perked up “you both need to finish your essays before the break!”
Harry dragged Draco through the streets of Hogsmeade, their arms linked together like an old married couple. Every few steps Harry would notice something cool in a window and pull Draco along with him.
“Mrs. Weasley loves everyone.” Harry stuffed a chocolate frog into his mouth. “Pluf shwe mave yu-” he swallowed “a weasley sweater. She only makes those for people she likes.”
“Attention, Attention” McGonagall called from the podium. “Id like to call special attention to our returning eighth years.” She motioned to the crowd. Cheers could be heard from several students. She went on with a very long and motivational speech before raising her hand and bellowing “let the feast begin”
They all took their seats. Ron and Hermione began chatting with the other Gryffindors. Harry surveyed the table, Seamus, Dean, Neville and a few other people had returned to finish their education. He was happy to see all of them. He was hoping this could just be a normal year.
Harry pushed himself off the bed and made his way across the room. The blond looked up at him, tear stained cheeks and red puffy eyes. He wiped at his face but the damage had been done.
Draco was sitting at an empty table in the library. It was his free period and basically the only time he could think without Harry there to make him feel all weird inside.
It was lunchtime and Harry had dragged Draco out to the fields. They were eating their food under a large willow tree. It was Saturday so neither had their robes on. Harry was wearing his classic khakis and a sweater, while Draco was wearing a Leather jacket, band t-shirt, and black jeans.
He’d almost completely forgot Draco was in the room. He whipped his head around, and there he was. Laying in bed, leaned up against the headboard, reading a book. He showed a sort of calm harry had never seen him exhibit before. He whipped his head back round before Malfoy could notice him staring.
Harry sat once again in the comfortable silence of Draco Malfoy, it seemed a little crazy. He was sitting so casually with his former enemy, having some tea. He watched as Malfoy turned the page of the book he was reading, he lifted his arm up to brush a piece of hair out of his face.
Draco was still shocked they had so easily extended an invitation when Harry mentioned he had nowhere to stay for the summer vacation. It wasn't exactly like they had the best history. He could only hope Harry’s word carried considerable weight in the family.
“Ronald Weasley!” Hermione scolded, “skipping is against the rules and you know it” she grabbed his arm and dragged him into the classroom.
“Two pumpkin pasties” she mumbled, keeping her eyes glued to her book. Most likely one of the textbooks they’d been assigned that year.
“I've heard about the escapades of your former Defence against the dark arts teacher Mr. Lupin” the professor bellowed from the front of the classroom.  “While I don't agree with him on everything I do still approve of his teachings”
He was soaked in sweat and his heart was beating out of his chest. He grasped at the sheets and pulled them close to his chest. He squeezed his eyes shut and rocked back and forth. Because maybe if he pretended his demons weren’t there, then they would leave him the fuck alone for once in his life.
“What do you want to be when you graduate?” Harry broke the silence. Everyone who’d ever read the Daily prophet knew that Harry was studying to become an Auror, but he’d never heard anything about Draco’s plans.
“Damnit” Ron huffed. “I need a rematch with Malfoy” his eyes floated over to the blond who was sitting elegantly reclined in one of the armchairs. He seemed to have put his book down to check Lavender's essay.
The time flew by and before they knew it they were heading off to bed. Harry and Ron had just finished up a game of chess (Ron won of course) and were getting their pajamas on when Malfoy entered the room.
They didn’t move until the sun had long since risen. He tugged Malfoy up by his hand. “We have to get ready”
“Just some self righteous bullshit, thought they were better than some filthy death eater like me” Malfoy sneered the last bit. “Maybe they were right” he muttered under his breath, so soft Harry almost missed it.
Draco shot over to Harry in a burst and grabbed the golden snitch out of his hand. “Look i caught it” he teased
They sat in a silence not much different from the ones they had shared many times before. Except this one was a little heavier, and Malfoy was just a little sadder, and Harry was worried.
“Merlin Harry you're going to hurt yourself!” Draco lifted his head and inspected his forehead. Tilting it to the side with a firm hand on his jaw, before finally letting go looking satisfied.
Draco had always commended Hermione for how observant she was, but this was an inconvenient time for her to put that into use.
“Oh umm idk I've been wearing rings for like forever and it just feels super weird to not have them on.” Draco laughed. “Plus it will make an easier transition when I get married.”
This news had been received significantly better. Excited chatter could be heard from all the students. And Harry had to admit the idea of impromptu Hogsmeade trips and late night walks sounded rather appealing.
“That's good,” Draco breathed. “I need to pick her brain about a new potion a romanian alchemist just discovered.”
When the two pastries arrived he pushed one of the plates over to Malfoy. He was rewarded with a strange look, but Malfoy didn't say anything. He just ate the Pumpkin Pastie.
“You should tell McGonagall” Harry offered. Trying not so sound as enraged as he was. Wasnt the school supposed to be promoting house unity? How could they let attacks like this happen.
Draco didn't like feeling all weird inside. He didn't like feeling warm whenever he thought about Christmas night.
“Oh, thank you” he mumbled grabbing them and sliding a couple sickles into her hand. “Well uhm goodbye” he looked at Malfoy.
And suddenly harry was in Hogwarts, except it was broken down and crumbled. His clothes were ripped up and standing right infant of him was Voldemort. But there was no one else, none of his friends, or Hagrid, or Mcgonagall. He was all alone.
“I told you I'd never let you catch the snitch again” Harry yelled as he held the golden sphere triumphantly above his head.
“Couldn't fall asleep” Harry remarked, sitting himself down next to Draco. Who wiped a few tears from his eyes.
The golden ball took a dive towards the ground and the boys followed. Their shoulders pressed together as they reached their hands out towards it.
Harry woke in the middle of the night. He tried to get up but a strong arm was clasped around his waist.
He maneuvered to the other side opposite Hagrid and made his way toward the carriages. The ride was much like he remembered. Being led along by the large bony thestrals, That now most every student could see.
“Harry?” a small voice spoke from behind him. He turned around to see Ginny standing in the dim light of the corridor.
His crush was nothing, that's what he had told himself before. but now it was something. A very big thing that he couldnt get rid of. A thing that refused to leave him alone, a thing that made him feel all fuzzy inside for no reason.
“Merry Christmas!” he flung his arms around the sleepy boy, which seemed to wake him up well enough, as he wrapped his arms around in return.
Before they knew it Hermione was jumping up from her seat and rummaging around their luggage muttering things like “we’ve got to get dressed” and “what would you do without me”
Harry relished the comfortable silence that fell between them. Only broken by the occasional sip of tea or turn of a page.
Now that harry really considered it, Draco was attractive. He’d stopped gelling back his hair a while ago but it looked slightly longer than he’d remembered. His skin was pale but his cheeks flushed the slightest shade of pink. And his eyes. Oh his eyes, they were a striking shade of grey that harry rather enjoyed gazing into.
The group came to stop in-front of a tall stool, sitting on top of that stool was a ratty looking old hat harry immediately recognized.
It was an outfit Harry never imagined he'd see on Draco. But he had to admit he looked pretty good in it.
It's actually embarrassing how long it took me to update this fic. Anyways, this is just some more build up. I swear the romance will start soon.
“Well I've always liked the idea of being a Healer” Malfoy looked up from his book. “But I don't know who would want to be healed by a Death Eater”
“Oi Malfoy!” Ron hollered across the room, startling Malfoy so much he fumbled with Lavender's essay, practically dropping it on the floor. “Come play chess with me!”
Hermione burst into laughter “that's it?” she was practically rolling around on the floor from amusement. “Merlin Harry, I thought someone died!”
“I have your room assignments with me here” she pulled a piece of parchment from inside her cloak. And began announcing names.
He wasn’t sure if he knew Malfoy and Zabini were still in contact. Did this mean they weren’t friends? Harry shook his head. No, Malfoy had also sent a nice bouquet to a man named Shelly, he’d told him himself. He also gave flowers to his mother, and he was sure he loved her.
More ferarum: the mores of a beast; sex in the manner of beasts (I think we can all figure what that is pointing towards)
“Draco’s Teddy’s cousin, but their families have been estranged since before Teddy was born. But we’ve known him since we were children, you know”. Hermione didn’t add
“Oh hush! Don’t apologize. How about I just come by tomorrow again, and do just those little things, yes? And I’m sure Luna would also love to help, whatever that would mean.” She snorted a little. Harry looked her over, her face marked by grief, her kind eyes.
“Ah yes, they do tend to do that, Witches. But tell me this, Potter,” he leaned forwards a bit more, and Harry could see some flecks of blue in the irises of grey.
Mrs. Picklewilly frowns again, and looks contemplative. “Yes, that is the question, isn’t it, dear?”
He briefly thought back to Malfoy in his suit, beautiful and stylish, but so decidedly un-Harry that he just
Zabini was a solicitor, and a very good one, apparently. Perhaps not so surprising, giving his mother’s tendency to go through husbands like tissues and end up richer every single time. But why did Malfoy need a solicitor? He took care putting together the purple columbines and glinting, ruby-zinnia. They were rather expensive, and their sparkling leaves were also often used in cosmetics. ‘Just perfect for a posh git like Zabini’, he mumbled, and added their standard coloured card, printed with
Harry smoothes down the quilted blanket over his godson’s bed. Teddy’s fever -which had come as predicted-, had gone down to no-longer dangerous levels, and he had finally fallen into a quiet sleep. It was long after midnight. The only light in the usually so brightly coloured room was a small moon shaped lamp next to the doorknob on the wall, so Teddy could find the door and come get Harry if he needed to. It bathed the room in a silver, colourless sheen. Ron and Hermione had left just before ten o’clock, when Harry had finally convinced them they couldn’t do anything to help, and Ron was getting worried about Hermione having enough sleep in her state. Hermione had glared at Ron for being ‘irrationally worried’, but they had flood home together regardless. Leaving Harry to sit beside Teddy’s bed, stroking his now dull, brown hair and hoping he would sleep through the night. Harry’s knees popped when he raised himself off the chair next to Teddy’s bed. He put up an alarm-charm around him, which would make his wand buzz if Teddy’s temperature rose or when he woke up. He shuffled out of the room, straight into what used to be Sirius’s room, and he crawled into the canopied bed, feeling like a child himself. Unprepared for all that lay on his shoulders, worried to his stomach, and feeling incapable of dealing with it.
Harry felt his cheeks colour. “Well then, assume I’m extremely stupid. Enlighten me. Why are these the right ones?”. Harry rung up the number on the till, and Malfoy got out his Gringotts bag.
“You have to wait a bit, pup, right, Mione?”. Hermione nodded, hand on her still flat-looking stomach.
Hermione had grown up, and had become the bigger person. She had had it in her to forgive someone who had done everything in his power to make her life, and that of others like her, impossible. Ron had seen it, and had decided to learn from it.
“Well,” she sighed again, pushing her hair out of her face, puffing it up even more. “Whatever I am going to wear, this isn’t it!” she tugged again at the fabric hugging her lower stomach, and turned back towards the dressing room. The salesperson helping them who had kept a discreet distance, rushed forwards to help her out of it. Draco, sensing some sort of explosion coming up soon, debated whether to follow her or not, but given the nature of her distress, he thought it best to follow her and try talk her down. Even if he shuddered thinking of the exact details of exactly what was going on with Hermione. Or anything to do with how Ron had gotten Hermione in such a state. Dear lord, no thoughts of that presumably freckled arse. He approached the dressing room’s velvety curtain.
He relayed, as far as he could, what Healer Lindsay had told him before, Hermione nodding in keen understanding. He didn’t mention the part about the mind-healer, still wrapping his mind around it. They were chatting, Harry winding down, when Teddy’s eyelids starting fluttering, the first signal he was waking up. As was usual when he woke up, his eyes were a light amber, unlike the green he liked to turn them to.
Harry groans. He remembers the drawings well; it was another one of those instances where he had a nice little chat with his Muggle teacher, wondering how he got such ‘fantastical ideas’.
“Get up” he presses, a little louder. He squeezes his eyes closed one last time, and mutters again. “Get the
Potter looked at him from under lowered brows. He looked rather grumpy, but it was hard to take a man seriously who was wearing something so
“Welcome to Spectral Sprouts!” It comes out rather strangled. He glares murderously at the Fanged Geranium, which was swaying back and forth gently now, not at all looking like it’d almost bitten his finger off. In had walked a familiar looking, lanky teen- young man, maybe. He was looking rather mutinous in Harry’s direction, like something about his person set him off. Most notable were his muggle clothes, a dark green hoodie and a pair of ratty jeans, not unlike the ones Harry was sporting. He was dawdling in the entryway to the shop, his shoulders stiff. What was more, Harry had the distinct impression that this young man wasn’t magical. There was a lack of buzz around him, something Harry noticed around magical beings, even the plants.
Incredulous, Harry couldn’t help it: He laughed. Upon seeing Malfoy’s face, he really wished he hadn’t. Malfoy’s jaw was hard, clenched. Wait, it
She was right. So what if he was single, quit his job, disappointed everyone. He had Teddy, who called him
“We’re not even sure yet if it will be a boy. It might be a little girl!”. He looked smitten with the idea.
I also feel like the story is going ever so slowly, but I can't seem to speed it up, since I want to enrich and embellish, even though not all details are relevant to the plot. I hope it's not too distracting, and actually enjoyable.
today,” she drawls, as if work was something dirty, which she well knew wasn’t: she owned a successful cosmetics business, after all, and not by lazying around, “but we’re having lunch together, and we need some sort of a
“Potter. You again.” His eyes land on the darkened jawline, now decorated with the beginnings of a beard. His eyeballs nearly fall out of their sockets. Dear lord, Harry Potter has grown a beard. Or a three day stubble.
I feel like this is a bit of a boring, transitional chapter. BUT in the next one something is going to happen which I KNOW you will all love. I'm giddy with excitement!
“What do you know about the war, Lawrence?” he asks instead of answering directly. The young man frowns, a little thrown off by his question.
“Mr Potter! You can’t be here!” a short female Healer scolded him, advancing towards him with a wand raised. He felt his face harden, his magic again drawing close to the surface. He could feel Hermione standing behind him, still in the dooropening.
“I just wanted to have dinner with you, Lawrence” he says more calmly than he feels. He’s taken off his outer robes, is now in only a thin, uncollared black shirt and what to muggles constituted leggings –traditional wizarding wear, of course- and while more comfortable, he feels too exposed. His summer underclothes are, after all, exceedingly thin and airy.
While there was still a long way to go to expand on the curriculum, it had turned out a success; muggle-born children reported better adaptability in classes that asked for intuitive magic, like potions and transfiguration. Hermione claimed it was due to a better sense of the ‘developing wizarding self’ or some nonsense. She had even gone as far as to introduce two school-counselors to Hogwarts, as an addition to the medical staff. The next step was evening seminars for muggle parents, to better understand their children and the world they were sending them into.
, but could you please wait with closing. I’m rather in need of some flowers!”. Harry looked up, and stared. It took him only slightly longer than usual to find his voice.
Also, I've outlined 8 Chapters by now, but as I'm writing the story sometimes moves into a different direction, which adds to the number of Chapters. I sincerely hope you'll enjoy what's coming in the next few!
“Lucius Malfoy has filed for retrial, apparently”. She states, voice serious. Harry tries very hard not to spill his tea, and fails.
It made him wistful, to see one of his family members being allowed to be himself, coloured hair and all.  He was secretly impressed by how Potter allowed all of it: the multicoloured walls, the mismatched socks, the jokes. Draco had
“Yeah, Hermione told me. It’s the worst feeling” she said empathetically, and smiled at him. It was a nice, warm smile, without any pity.
Hermione never spoke to him about Ministry matters anymore, since he told her it led to tension between him and Marcus. And while that wasn’t an issue anymore –Harry ignored the little twinge of regret that that thought caused him- he still didn’t really want to think of the Ministry while at the flowershop. But then Malfoy had waltzed in in those suits of his and had mentioned… things. Odd things. Things similar to the little hints of news and gossip Mrs. Picklewilly liked to drop while he tried to swallow the sticky fruitcake she served. And hadn’t Malfoy visited Mrs. Picklewilly too?
. He took a deep breath, and knocked loudly, steadily, three times. He could hear the magical amplification inside, making sure his knocks carried to the occupiers of the house. He took a step back, and tried not to swallow his tongue with nerves. It was starting to drizzle, and he hoped Potter would answer the door soon or his hair would be ruined.
“Hmm, how thoughtful of you.” He answers, although it doesn’t sound all that sincere. He walks further in the hallway, and before Harry can stop him, he steps into the kitchen. Harry inwardly braces himself.
The Ministry was all aflutter with rumours, but he strode through the hallways with his chin tilted up, a little sneer on his face. ‘Let them talk’, he thought. He forced himself to walk slowly, with dignity, and not
“Shhh, Teddy, that’s normal” he stroked his godsons hair, leaned back. “The Healer said no metamorphing for the next week, okay?”
The floo chimes again, and Potter waves his wand to unblock it. Immediately, the loud voice of Molly Weasley fills the space, panicked and shrill.
Harry didn’t exactly know what the Boggart had turned into for Teddy, but he had an inkling. He could well remember Molly’s Boggart, in this very house, showing her her family, dead. Molly had woken to Teddy screaming in a panic, Victoire running up the stairs already to get her. Teddy had been so frightened his magic had tried to shield him from the threat, but, not having an outlet, had turned into itself. It was comparable to an autoimmune reaction, only magical, and acute, Hermione had explained to him in Mungo’s. Harry had immediately taken hold of Teddy and apparated into the Emergency Ward, where Teddy was seized and brought to Spell Damage. Limbs and magic splaying everywhere, they had had to strap him down to get calming draughts down his throat, before they could set up a sort of wizarding IV fluid; it had no tubes, but required precise incision, for which Teddy needed to be still. At that point, Harry had been pushed out into the hall, told to “Please wait, Mr. Potter”.
embroidery. He himself had taken up what had been Regulus’ bedroom on the first floor, leaving Sirius’s as it was. He still visited it sometimes, especially when having a hard time with Teddy, or recently, Marcus leaving.
But as he closed up shop, Neville asked what Harry was smiling about, and he couldn't really answer that question, either.
if Teddy wanted to call him dad? What a small thing to ask for. What a precious, unexpected gift. He sighed.
The Wizengamot has ruled. Draco finally gets someone in his corner, and he finds out about his mother's friend Jane.
, and what a boatload of trouble that has been!” he exclaimed with an indignant air. “And I kept thinking, who would send weird and smelly bouquets with odd Latin phrases for Godric knows what reason? Merlin, only figures it would be you! HA” he thurst a hand through is hair.
Harry insisted Ron was cheating, having Molly’s recipes when he wanted them, but their current attempt was a favourite recipe of Mrs. Picklewilly, and he had utter faith in her. She was beyond picky with the preserves and pickles she sold, so she must know a thing or two about cake –or banana bread, in this case. If this failed, he would ask Hannah, who had surprised him with excellent blueberry crumble last week in Neville’s shop.
His cheeks were flushed, and he was fussing with his hair, which was obviously windswept. And Merlin, he was wearing a
“What has you worried? Not the meeting then, I hope? We know what to expect”. Hermione stills, and he sees her eyes dart to something on the corner of her desk. He motions to grab it, but she beats him to it.
“Oh, it’s so awful! That lying, conniving -” she pushes a hand through her hair, puffing it up even more.
Thank you for reading this beast! I will try to be a more considerate writer in the future, and hope to make it feel less forced/rushed.
, please”. The voice sounded vaguely familiar, but most definitely annoyed and short, if not utterly polite in its words. Harry grunted and straightened himself up, hoping this new customer wouldn’t mind all the scattered dried herbs still on the floor, and all over his clothes. The smell of Neville’s magically enhanced lavender was nearly overwhelming, and he felt his nose itch.
A voice comes from upstairs. “Ted? Who’s there? I’ll be right down, after I get this muck-” his speech was interrupted by some squelching noises and incomprensible curses. Draco turns curiously to Teddy, who is grinning wickedly. “We’ll be in the kitchen, dad!” he yells up. Dad? When did
is me telling you off, Teddy”. Teddy laughs, perks up even more, and jumps off of the stool to hug Harry, who slings an arm around Teddy’s shoulder.
out, and not him?!”. Harry rubs his face again. He was way too tired for this. Marcus gets up, moves towards Harry, as if to touch him. Harry knows he can’t handle it, he might break if he does. He’s wanted Marcus to come to him for so long, to come and apologize. This didn’t at all go like he dreamt about.
“Is grannie coming over soon?” asks Teddy, sipping his hot chocolate like it is the most normal thing in the world. Perhaps it is, given the frequency Malfoy has come by lately.  Harry is yet to sip his, even though he knows it’s not poisoned and it smells lovely. Again, Malfoy is being weird, making hot chocolate.
on VCR. His thoughts kept drifting off to Marcus, seemingly already moved on, and his toothpaste, still on the shelf in his ensuite bathroom. A mint-coloured reminder that apparently, Harry couldn’t compete with unattached, unscarred and polished purebloods. “Haz?” Teddy asked, turning to face him on the couch on hands and feet. He had his clawed socks on, and they were scratching the blanket he put over them.
“In here!” he answered from the kitchen, and quick footsteps brought Teddy bouncing into the kitchen, straight to the refrigerator.
“Do your parents know?” he asked Ron, who shook his head. “We told Mione’s parents yesterday, they were absolutely delighted.” He grinned. Hermione’s parents had been recovered from Australia after the war, and after intensive therapy most of their memory had returned. Whenever having visited Hermione’s parents, Ron was full of delight about the ‘inventiveness of muggles, Harry!’, and their house was now slowly gaining piles of what Hermione called “junk” but what Ron was certain he would get the hang of soon (Harry saw the comparison with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, but wisely held his tongue). Luckily Hermione’s dad was a patient man, and they had bonded over getting to know how to use an iPhone, which now everyone in the Weasley family –and Harry, carried everywhere, using them with varying degrees of success.
It had been rather surreal, to see Hermione’s stomach project a wobbly shape when the healer had cast the spell. He glanced at the image she’d enclosed, and smiled. A weird looking blob indeed, and unlike muggle ultrasounds, this one was bright purple and the image moved on an invisible axis, like a globe. Neville had already squealed upon seeing it, but exhausted as he was, he’d retreated to the back to sit down in the sun-room. Harry could well imagine how tiring it must be, with a newborn. He hadn’t been there with Teddy when he was a scarce week or so old, but Teddy had been a terrible sleeper for years, nightmares plaguing him often. Harry was glad though, at the thought that Neville and Hannah were in it together, and they were so good together too. Wonderfully sappy, if he was being honest. Then again, if anyone deserved it, it was Neville.
