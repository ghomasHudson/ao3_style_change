“Flipendo!” Hermione cast.
"Of course," Mrs Malone nodded. "I will run through the other options if there are any complications. But that's for a later date." Harry looked down at his belly and rubbed it slowly, he hadn't really considered that something could go wrong. Draco clutched Harry's hand tightly, he was having the same thoughts. "I don't want to stress you out, but it's something you need to consider."
“Has that ever worked?” Hermione scoffed. “When I was overdue with Hugo, Mum just suggested I eat lots of curry. I just got the runs.”
Ron looked at Draco and Harry slightly dumbstruck. “What's going on?” He asked frowning. He was slightly too drunk to do this.
“Are you sure?” Harry smiled as he sat down on the bed.
Harry rolled his eyes and walked off with a shrug. “Whatever then...”
“Huh?”
Draco nodded as the small bundle was placed into Draco's arms.
"Thank you," said Harry nodding, feeling a little reassured. "You'll have to convince Draco of that, however."
“So, moving on... Are you managing?” Hermione asked, changing the topic.
"James?" Molly asked curiously.
“That would do it,” Hermione reasoned. “That’s impressive.”
"I'm not cleaning blood out of the carpet," Harry said snatching Draco's wand out of reach.
Harry nodded and tried to breath steadily. It was supposed to help with the pain, or the pushing.
Harry wouldn’t have had it any other way.
"Wait. Wait. Draco's a Veela? Which means you're not a pure blood. Dad is going to flip!" Ron grinned.
"Harry. You're not in labour, it's not proper contractions. Have a bath or read a book." Sirius called back.
“The beast drained their blood” Hermione nodded slowly. “Has anyone been abducted yet? Like the old tales?”
"Draco's okay?"
“So?”
"Making yourself at home I see," Draco said opening the bedroom door. Harry noticed the leather gloves instantly. “Why did you come?” Draco said sighing.
Harry smirked, “Drink your pint, before I kick you out” he warned playfully.
“Really? Hadn’t guessed,” Ginny asked putting her glass down.
"Spit it out Draco. Your nerves are unbecoming" Lucius said rolling his eyes.
“Oh, I’m sorry. No wonder you’re looking a little porkier” Mother said as he acrylic nailed hands jiggled Harrys stomach. “You’ll start resembling your father if you’re not careful.”
“Go away Potter” Draco answered glaring.
Draco nodded and licked at Harry’s neck. Ron and Hermione moved closer, watching the baby in Harry’s arms carefully. "
Draco could hear the snickers, From his classmates. His face was beginning to go red “Sure.”
Draco and Ron circled around each other sniffing, as Draco howled loudly and moved to the door. Draco impressively opened the door with a clawed swipe, it creaked open.
“Sure,” questioned Albus, grinning. “But what did you do, crash the car?” He was tall and had inherited Harry’s dark hair and eyes; his face resembled some of his own most recognisable features, although softened slightly.
"Well Weasel, when a part Veela loves a man. Their biological imperative to Breed can sometimes lead to their same sex partners becoming pregnant" Draco said talking down to Ron. Ron frowned.
“Touchy” Draco bristled. “Fine, yes I left you. For your own good. But this…” he stepped closer and sniffed. “Have you cum?”
‘They were flirting’ Scorpius marvelled in complete confusion.
Out of the shadows the villagers approached the Reverend, they looked paler now, movements more inhuman as they moved their heads to search around their glazed-over eyes now fixed in place. “My Congregation, patience. God will reward our us” he said stopping them all with his hypnotic command. “Go Ronald Weasley, it is time.”
"He doesn't answer them."
“No way,” Callum replied, genuine fear in his eyes.
“It is nightfall. You must come inside? Did you not hear him?” She hissed her eyes glancing around.
Albus and Scorpius sighed. “We could just move out?” Scorpius suggested rubbing his temple.
"Don't throw accusations. You brought him here when I expressly asked him to stay away. I could have been back home by now" Draco muttered.
“Have got started on a nursery yet?” Ginny asked as she poured the cocktail out into a pair of glasses.
"Boyfriends?" Draco queried. "And we met at a erm...thing..."
Draco grinned, “And here I thought you were busy having masturbation parties with the Gryffindors.”
“Okay, uhm, Cedric?”
"We've all made mistakes. Now you listen here Draco!" She said firmly. "As Parents your job is teach your kids to be better."
Harry shook it politely, looking at her confused. “Hey. Look Draco can I give you my number? I mean summer is coming up...and I figured?”
Harry looked up and smiled, “Ignore him, he’s been here since seven and he’s had more than a few”
There was a sound of disagreement from the others. “What? Does the geek chorus have other opinions?”
Draco nodded understanding.
“Don’t tell him” Harry frowned.
“The only beasts here are you!” Reverend Trask snarled. “Vampires!”
Harry smirked a little. As he headed for the large gathering of wizards all turned facing a platform. Kingsley Shacklebolt stood addressing the crowd. Harry noticed he'd finished addressing the crowd.
"Thank you Mother" Draco said grateful as he pressed into Harry's neck kissing it gently. "I love you so so much. Soiled?"
Draco grinned. “Yes, Harry loves curry. I prefer Chinese.”
"Well. We didn't think Harry was pregnant. He's a male, it doesn't happen" Barnabas said and awkwardly.
"Ron," Hermione said rolling her eyes.
"Yes, shockingly when you grow up with a library that would make Madame Pince cream. You turn out to be decent writer..."
“They do it with all the guys, try not to let yourself be bothered by it."
"Just do it Draco" Harry groaned. "Ohhhh...Merlin" Harry swore as pain washed over him.
"Harry? Is everything okay? You haven't been in the office in ages. I asked Robards about it, but he said you had quit?" Hermione asked.
“How far along are you?” Harry said gently.
“Mating season” Harry realised. “Hermione, she mentioned...I didn’t listen.”
Harry was starting to suspect he might be able to breast feed once the baby arrived. If that was normal, that was probably the only problem with being pregnant. There wasn't a normal, Magical conceptions were few and far between and most of them hadn't bothered writing it down. Which frankly Harry didn't blame.
Kingsley nodded understanding. "I overheard you weren't able to go on Leave?"
“They’re not going to want you either” Otto said glaring.
"If they do..." Harry asked quietly.
"Fainting can happen. All the blood rushing around the body" She said calmly. Draco nodded and gripped Harrys hand tighter.
“Are you Harrys Butler? Did he send you to meet me?” Draco asked looking around, empty street. Sun was setting, cars driving past oblivious.
Harry blinked surprised. "Oh um Thankyou Kingsley" he said before gritting his teeth and clutching his stomach in pain as he bent down slightly.
“Chicken, chips and tabouli. Didn’t have time to get to the co-op” she said. “You sure you’re okay Draco?”
Mrs Malone gave a disarming smile. "I wouldn't worry."
“I love you too. You did really well tonight. But you worry me sometimes” Draco said honestly. Harry smiled, “I know. But I have you looking out for me. That helps”
Harry stood silent and pressed his palms flat against the table. He closed his eyes; he could feel it. That silent pull, that desire to give himself over to it.
Harry wanted the ground to swallow him up, for darkness to envelop him and save him from this night. "Errr...Draco. Sort of. Invited me?" Harry said not quite sure if that was truth after all.
“Given that he bloody took Harry, it’s a bit hard to deny Hermione!”
Harry knew Draco would be understanding, but he wanted it to be right. He'd eventually found someone who seemed understanding. Mrs Amy Malone, she lived in Croydon and while she hadn't had experience with, Male Pregnancies But she was willing to learn.
“You look exhausted. Why don’t you go home?” Hermione asked. “Or get a coffee?”
“Draco thinks it’s because he’s a better wizard. But I don’t think it's that.”
"Harry!" Hermione said firmly, "You need to push!"
Hermione snarled at the mutilated vampire corpse, as Ron, brought a candle over and dropped it onto the body. Instantly it lit up with flames. Harry felt himself crawling backward from the intense heat.
“I wish. No, he’s pregnant.”
“Old and past our sexual prime? Apparently not. Apparently male carriers, just like women, get a boost of fertility in their age. A big burst of bloody fertility," Draco's eyes narrowed further until they were almost closed.
Draco nodded gently, “You can’t get rid of PTSD completely. But you can manage it, and for some it will go away. Harry comparatively doesn’t have it too bad, but he still gets set of occasionally.”
But Harry Sodding Goodie Potter who was an Auror and in a completely different section of the office. Still somehow felt it necessary to come say hello to Draco and make small talk. Frankly if Arthur Weasley wasn’t his boss and vaguely fond of Harry he’d have hexed him. Instead, Draco had to settle for annoying Harry until he got left alone, which was a kind of reward in itself.
They began to make The Malfoy Chateau a home. The three of them and Ron and Hermione settled in one of the village cottages. Given the sudden vacancy of property, it quickly became a nice wizarding hamlet away from prying Muggle eyes.
Harry laughed. “I’m going to marry someone of standing obviously. Or someone hot like Hugh grant or Ewan McGregor” Harry suggested.
"You're not quiet" Sirius muttered under his breath.
“You do it wonderfully,” Harry reassured.
“I know. I’ll be careful...” Draco nodded.
"The moment this gets in the papers. What then? Hmm? The Boy who lived pregnant! Because my son couldn't keep it in his pants long enough to settle down with a woman like is proper."
"Invite them round. We can tell them together; you know you'll regret keeping it from them," Draco reassured.
He stroked his stomach a little proudly, he looked pregnant especially with each passing month. The curve was there growing bigger, yet lower than a normal pot belly, not that he hadn't put a bit of extra weight on. He did up the buttons on the blue shirt it clung to his stomach and was tighter than he'd have preferred. The creeping smell of food was wafting through the house, making his mouth water, as he towelled the remaining shaving foam off his face. And began to walk downstairs clutching the banister tightly.
Draco growled deeply his eyes narrowing at Ron.
Narcissa gazed around the room. "You've let the place go. I assume there's a guest room I can stay in?"
“Cheat” Harry frowned. There was an art to pouring beer, he found doing it the muggle way made for better drinks.
“But your arse is so big! Don’t ruin it!” Harry pouted.
Harry blinked and looked at his stomach, was he really that fat. “Err...right” he said shifting his weight. “What’s going on?”
“What’s your...oh” Draco went silent and looked Harry up and down considering. “How big are you?” He asked with a smirk.
“Harry please walk towards me slowly” Hermione insisted calmly.
Draco smirked, “I went to have a cigarette. But ended having a shag instead?”
“My Master” Ron grinned with a sick grin.
Draco sighed in relief, as Harry rubbed the ointment on his back. “Helping?”
“Come to us boy!” The Old man said brandishing his silver blade.
“One second!” Draco said putting his hand over the receiver.
“And yet I’m not above hexing anyone who calls me moody,” Draco retorted casually, taking a sip of his irritatingly non-alcoholic drink.
"Sort of. Err. Sort of had too..." Harry said uncertainly. This
“What’s so funny?” Harry asked hovering in the doorway.
He ran towards the bathroom, the girls. And pushed in, ignoring the out of order sign. Inside he saw him, the blonde boy Draco, the one he’d fucked. Leant over a sink, crying in frustration.
"I look fat?" Harry said meekly looking down at his stomach, it was bigger. There was no denying that, he was into his second trimester he was bound to look bigger.
"Thankyou. But I feel weird, the pants are riding up my arse" Harry frowned.
“Then stop complaining,” Draco answered. He rubbed his belly and sat down on a box. “You four are so active today, I think my insides have begun to bruise.” Albus and Scorpius would help clear the attic out and perhaps they’d move James or Caelum up there. Then they’d use one of their rooms for the Nursery. But there was still so much to be done. Scorpius returned and sat down next to Draco. “Where’s Albus?”
Draco smiled, “You should go home, you look tired.”
"There's like an inch of dust on this" Ron commented. "Harry! Stop the cart I think something is wrong.”
“You must have knocked it. Perhaps if you didn’t come over here that often. It wouldn’t happen” Draco smirked drawling.
"Harry!" Draco said putting an arm around him and bending down concerned.
“I found the Cognac!” Draco declared walking up through the door to the cellar. “Morning Scorpius.”
Truthfully, Harry was more concerned he might give birth to a wolf. Which was not the case.
“Fuck” Harry swore, as a wolf flexed cracked its muscles. Ron was smaller than Draco and his fur was more reddish than his too. He bowed his head to Draco, and for a second Harry was certain he was smiling.
“Ruddy Faggots! You should be in jail!” He yelled after him.
“Ahem!” Ron coughed.
Harry’s words were cut off by the door being kicked in. Cold winds billowed in and a figure lowered its head as it craned into the room. Harry stared at the table he refused to look up.
“Speak for yourself” Draco drawled. Harry sat up and turned in the direction of Draco’s voice, his Hogwarts jumper bulged. A three-month curve, a pregnant belly. Clearly the toilet shag was real, the baby was real.
“That’s a cherry thought,” Ron muttered.
“Absolutely,” assured Harry, kissing Draco gently. “But you won’t die. I love you, Draco.”
Harry looked over to where Hermione lay and saw a snarling wolf in her place, glaring at the Reverend. Ron and what Harry presumed was Hermione launched themselves at the Reverend. Causing him to collapse as the wolves clawed tearing into his body. Congealed and cold, limbs ripping off as Draco wrapped his paws around the Reverend's screaming head, as he pulled. Decapitating him.
"It's a boy. Because of your" he waved his hand.
Draco for his part was as annoyingly trim has ever, he had this habit of wandering around shirtless. Harry loved it! Sirius just wished he'd put on fifteen pounds, so he'd seem less like he was some sort of blonde skinny Adonis.
Harry heaved himself out of the fireplace in the ministry forecourt. It wasn't peak hour, but he was certainly getting some queer looks as he waddled slowly. Towards the forecourt, he walked straight into the ministry security checkpoint. Where the moment the older a little haggard security guard caught a glimpse of Harry's unimpressed face, Harry's heavily pregnant belly and Harrys more unimpressed face. Waved him straight through.
"Your father fainted went down like a tonne of bricks. You are just as squeamish Draco" Narcissa warned.
“Be safe. Especially in your condition” His Mum said worried.
"Hey," Lily said, reaching over and rubbing Draco's belly. "Let me manifest."
Hermione raised an eyebrow, "Well your pregnancy is quite the talk of the ministry. Especially with the cat out of the bag."
Draco nodded. “Well, imagine...” he paused and looked down at his belly. “Basically, they do a focused Splinching. So, part of my belly is removed, and they lift the babies out. And then they re-attach it.”
“I can hear him in my head” Harry commented. “My Alpha.”
“What’s going on here? Why is everything boarded shut?” Harry asked.
“What have you done” Harry swore gripping the stairs tightly as he felt a contraction and pushed.
"How do you know it's going to be a boy?" Draco said smirking.
Draco smiled warmly, "didn't go as weirdly as I thought." Harry jabbed Draco firmly.
“No” Harry said sitting on the bed. “We need to talk.”
“Dudley gifted it last Christmas. It's terrific. A Pot of that, please, and throw out the green tea – it’s just water with leaves in it," Draco muttered.
Draco took a swig of his third beer. "Maybe? I love him. So probably will eventually."
"He's at work, covering some conference at the ministry. So, you can't just walk in and drag him out" Sirius said trying to talk him down. "He'll be home in a couple of hours. You can yell at him then."
"I'm pointing out this is your idea" Harry reminded Draco.
“Hmm,” Draco hummed, his eyes narrowing. “I will take back my suggestion for baby names.”
“Draco making you take him on holiday?” Hermione asked, wryly.
Harry shot him a look of
"Misdeeds, no offence but don't we have to be put on trial!" Ron replied.
Draco raised an unimpressed eyebrow. "Then you should be at home! In Bed!" Draco grumbled.
“Well, Albus and Scorpius are moving into the attic and their rooms will become the nursery and playroom respectively, unless Harry consents to move into the manor."
"Yeah. It's probably the best I'm not on speaking terms with my parents. Considering it won't take long for anyone to figure out the Malfoy's biggest secret" Draco said melancholically.
"Perhaps you should fact check more often then" Kingsley smiled. "And Harry, I'll speak to Robards about having a position available so you can re-join the Aurors when you're ready."
“Oh. Thank you?” Scorpius said confused.
"I. can't do it" Harry said looking at Draco. "Can you do it?"
“I haven’t got anyone pregnant, unlike Dad, and you're only having one. Why are you making such a thing about it? It's not like there aren't five of us.”
“It is too late. Your Evil took the lives of two of our congregation, and you must be punished for that!” He declared opening the bible.
"Hmm. I take it Draco was this stubborn as a child too?" Sirius asked curiously.
On Tuesday, Draco went for a simple collapsing charm, every bit of furniture would collapse when Harry touch it, it was mildly amusing. And specifically led to Harry giving up and going out on patrol.
"No." "Yes!"
“Do you two ever agree with anything?”
“Technically four. But yes, that’s about accurate” Draco nodded. “Come along. Harry will be pleased to see you both.”
Draco nodded, as he felt eyes staring at him. “Right...”
“Yes Sweetheart. How was school?” She called out over the sound of the kettle.
"The best" Sirius answered with a smile. "Harry is a surprisingly normal person, all things considered."
“Can I sit here?”
He could eat, but that wasn't helping things, beyond making his arse wider. Ron had commented that he looked like he'd been stung by a bee with how round and thick his arse looked. Hermione said it was common, it helped deliver the baby safely if there was 'more padding' as she put it. Harry just felt fat. He had a big belly with lots of red stretch marks over the surface it led the way into every room and was starting to cause love handles to develop, a pair of breasts that had begun developing. Much to everyone's amusement.
Draco nodded slowly. "James Sirius Potter" he conformed.
"Right. Yes...okay..." Harry nodded slowly. "I'm..."
"Draco Potter. Get your arse here!" Harry bellowed full of hormonal frustrations.
Harry nodded and held Draco tightly as they apparated into the living room of Grimmauld place.
“I know. But I married you, I knew what I was getting into,” Harry said kissing Draco’s cheek. “If you're up for it, I'll run you a hot bath?”
“I spoke to Dumbledore. We were in there for maybe four, five hours. And we aged five months” Harry said reaching out for Draco’s hand. “You’re a good kisser you know.”
“Well...right...” she said blinking at him. She was almost looking through him. Like she didn’t recognise him.
“Hairs a mess. But that’s nothing knew” Otto smirked.
“Err...yeah. What’s wrong with that?” Harry said staring at him confused.
“You haven’t been practicing safe sex? Shouldn’t you be taking precautions?” Asked James, grinning.
He turned to Barnabas Cuff. "Come on Barney, you can't expect an expectant father to work up to his husbands due date." Barnabas with his round face and chin that seemed to wobble with every defence he uttered. "Now. I won't hear of it. Harry is very clearly ready to pop. I think it's entirely reasonable for Draco to be home with him" Kingsley insisted.
"So, Draco. Have you been looking for work? Now Harrys quit who's going to be providing for bub" Sirius commented.
"Well, it was more efficient than I expected."
Harry marvelled at Draco. He happily scoffed a couple of slices of cake and some tea before relaxing back in bed as the Midwife examined him. Lucinda Morerow was a trained Healer and Midwife and had helped delivered Caelum. She was Persian with a warm smile and a tall thin body. She gave him a set of potions to drink, which Draco forced down, impressively with no complaint.
“Of course,” Hermione nodded. “And new babies are exciting?” She pointed out.
The bathroom opened and a dripping wet peered over the balcony. "What?!"
“Err Pickering” he said hesitating.
Draco had been uncertain about it after the initial euphoria wore off.
"Behave you" Harry warned playfully. As they headed into the kitchen. Draco returned to stirring a few pots on the stove and began serving the meal up onto plates. "How much arsenic would you like Ronald?" Draco asked playfully serving up a large plate.
“Well Christmas is coming up? I was wondering what your plans were Harry?” Draco asked, his hands were in his pockets of his expensive custom-tailored black robes. His long blonde hair tied back into a Viking inspired plait.
“Yes. But that one tastes especially like water,” Draco muttered.
Mrs Weasley put down her knitting and embraced Draco in a tight comforting hug. "Now Dear. I know you might not have planned it. but you'll be a Parent in mere hours" Mrs Weasley said rubbing Draco's back. "Sometimes life chooses things before you would have. Trust your instincts, I think you'll make a terrific father. You and Harry both will."
“Stop telling them you're going to die in childbirth. That won’t happen,” Harry commented as he passed the doorway with a basket of washing. “James, where are all the towels?!”
“I thought you might want to come with me?” Harry suggested sucking his belly.
“Unlikely?” Lily frowned.
“Harry would cry too much, and be even more rubbish at disciplining them,” Draco dismissed. “Who else died that your father liked?”
“I... had a dream. I was in a castle...” Harry stopped and clutched his head rubbing the centre of the forehead. Like something was missing there. “Was that...where you were talking about”
Harry folded his arms, unimpressed. "I don't care. Come home!" Harry begged his eyes watering slightly.
“Don’t you feel it? Come on. Your Harry Potter, you’re not a muggle. This isn’t your life” Ron insisted.
“Still - four more children,” laughed Ron. “I’m impressed Harry got you pregnant again – a brave choice.”
“I’m Hermione. Hermione Granger” A bushy haired brunette said as she sat down in the seat next to him.
“I don’t blame him. You weren’t trying to get pregnant, were you?”
“I won’t act on it, but it’s something that keeps gnawing at me.”
“Game on” Harry grinned, as he walked out.
Narcissa smiled, as Draco strolled back in. "Is father coming? Should I be expecting an apology?"
“Nothing will happen. You are very strong,” Harry said, offering a bowl of cookies and cream ice cream. “You’ll give birth and we’ll have four wonderful new children.”
Scorpius wandered into the kitchen at the manor. His stomach was rumbling, he’d been so tired after the Hogwarts Express. He’d gone straight upstairs and passed out in his bed, now it was the early evening. He’d certainly missed dinner.
“So, this town has a Vampire priest in charge of all the villagers. A werewolf in the manor and three wizards in the middle.”
“Good Morning Villagers! I can see you are all rather busy, but I was enquiring if the baker was available. I wish to purchase some Baguettes?" Draco Malfoy's voice said cuttingly. Hermione and Ron glanced over at Draco, dressed in a red velvet coat, an open white shirt, a loose paisley cravat, and a pair of the tightest pants imaginable. The villagers all stared at him for a long pause, Draco sighed. “Je veux acheter du pain, je ne veux pas interrompre ta brûlure des sorcières”
“It’s been two months Potter; you would have coped” Draco rolled his eyes.
"They're not having sex, are they?" Ron said hand over his eyes.
“Daemon” Reverend Trask.
"Hmm. Noted" Sirius commented.
“Good” The Reverend smiled. “My congregation are hungry, baying for the blood of innocents.”
Harry breathed out, watching as it became a cool mist that was guided away by the nippy breeze. The Horse’s feet crunched under a mix of snow and gravel, as it dragged the carriage up the narrow winding road. He looked ahead but the snow-covered trees made it near impossibly to discern if they were headed the right way.
“I almost wish I died young. Then I could have retained my beauty,” Draco muttered.
"Draco..." Narcissa said firmly. "Is it wise for you to be taking responsibility for this child? We can certainly organise Harry to be compensated."
Draco smirked. "Your beautifully plump arse."
Draco looked up at Mr Hubbard who glared expectantly. Draco sighed and looked down at the monologue under Lady Macduff’s name. Eventually he was relieved by the bell ringing.
"Breath Harry" Mrs Malone encouraged.
“You know what. I am just going to say it. Being burned at the stake by a bunch of French villagers is not on my list of things to do. Especially after keeping us imprisoned for what two-three months?” Ron commented and tugged on the ropes around his wrist. They were tied back-to-back against a wooden post that had been set up in the town square.
"Yes" Harry said firmly. Draco raised an eyebrow. "Yes, I do. Don't give me that look" He frowned.
"Fine. If I must" Draco said simply.
“Can I hex him? Just a small one?” Draco begged. “I’ll let you have your way with me,” Draco offered rubbing his round belly. “I can probably do sexy if you turn the lights off.”
"Harry" Draco said placing his hands-on Harry's shoulders and rubbing them gently. "Please..."
"Knock Knock!" Hermione said from the doorway.
"Thing?" Hermione smiled incredulously, as she peered over at Harry.
"I don't blame him" Sirius admitted. As Harry waddled into the fireplace and angrily called out ministry of Magic. "Harry!" Sirius snapped as Harry disappeared. He sighed and looked at the roof, "I know you're laughing right now Padfoot and I swear when I get up there, I'm going to kick your arse."
That evening Harry woke up in pain. The lights were off, it was late. He rolled onto his back, "Draco!" Harry groaned uncomfortably. He was laying in a puddle on the bed, for a moment he thought he might have pissed himself again. Before a worrying thought started to take root.
“I told you the tapestry was.”
"Minerva, Andromeda, Arthur, and Neville," Draco smiled. "And I suppose you can use Rubeus as Arthur’s middle name.”
“Obviously it’s yours! Why else would I be bloody calling you Potter!” Draco snapped irritably.
It was almost five pm before Draco arrived at Westbourne Park station. Even then he’d been waiting around for twenty minutes. It was starting to get dark, and he stood in the Phone box. He dialled his home number, “Hi Mum...”
Harry scowled. "And yes, Draco did suggest my outfit."
Draco face went bright red, as she glided out of the room. Harry and Draco stood quietly, watching each other quietly. Draco began to do the buttons up on his shirt. "Sorry. I didn't think mother would say that..." Draco apologised. "This is going to be a long night. Isn't it?"
Draco smiled. "Either way they'll perfect." Harry smiled and cuddled against Draco. Mrs Malone began going through various information they needed to be aware of. Harry felt a little reassured, although aware he still would have to go
“I’ll pay you two hundred Galleons if you go downstairs and tell him I’m not home,” Harry begged.
Harry smiled. "Better than I thought. I think its adrenaline. How's our son?"
Draco grinned. "I'm fine, thank you..."
"I'm not a" Harry said gritting his teeth.
"You passed out mate. Your mum brought you in drooling and everything" Ron grinned where he was sitting with a mug.
Fifteen minutes later, with a slight spring in his step, Draco returned to the line. “Sorry Miss. massive queue of tourists” Draco lied with his most genuine smile.
Albus nodded. "Right..." He handed the glass to Draco and another to Scorpius. "I suppose I'll start. Scorpius and I have decided we want to move out. We've started applying for apartments."
Draco put a hand on his back as his firm round stomach led him, puffing and out of breath. “Merlin I’m unfit,” Draco whined.
Wednesday Draco was taking a different approach. Harry vaguely aware of the pranks, “Honestly Two days, it’s like being back at school” Harry complained to Arthur. “And it’s not like Fred and George’s pranks these are just annoying” Harry complained, to Arthur who was sympathetic.
Reverend Trask stood there crucifix outstretched in his hand. Draco cocked his head and half-heartedly knocked it from the Reverend's grasp.
"Coffee then," Hermione said wryly. "But don't overwork yourself," she reminded. "Do you have the paperwork on the arrests made in Shoreditch? I've got to face a press conference later, and I want to have my facts correct.”
Harry was pregnant. The bigger he started getting, the more likely it was that he'd be unable to hide it at work. Or do anything but paperwork knowing the ministry bureaucracy.
“Well, your Papa is pregnant.”
“Will you open your gates to Salvation. God wants this land to be cleansed” he said licking his fangs haughtily.
"No. I just miss you..." Harry said a little pitifully.
He let out a loud moan as a contraction hit him and his cock hardened involuntarily.
Harry dropped his spoon and stared agog at Draco. “Did you just.”
Harry yawned and rubbed his smooth forehead. Pushing his dark hair out of eyes. “It’s because the beds here are like rocks. And Fabian snores” Harry said stretching as he stood up. Smoothing out the navy blazer and tie. “Do I look alright?”
Draco recoiled against the window. “That seats taken” he said automatically.
“Seriously?” Otto replied raising an eyebrow. “Yeah, you’ve always had a belly. You and I are the fat kids, it’s why I’ve been worried about you sleeping through lunch. It was one of your favourite times of day” Otto laughed.
"Threw me out" Draco sighed. "Due to the fact I've brought shame to the family."
“Dinner will be in ten minutes” She said walking out of Draco’s room. Draco closed his door and fished out the pack of cigarettes he grabbed his neon pink lighter. He left the front door open and leaned over the balcony watching people arrive home from school and work. He lit up his cigarette and let out a long puff, for a good second he thought he saw two teenagers standing on the quad, one with a tangled mop of curly brown hair and one skinny red head.
"James is like your father. Scorpius suggested names that, while having literary origins, are a little out there. And Albus hates his name so he'll suggest incredibly normal ones."
"So, I am getting fat?" Harry said frowning.
"Now you want saving?" Hermione sighed.
“No sorry” Draco said trying to quickly walk away from him.
“Priorities Hermione” Draco muttered; we’ll just body bind him.”
Harry was sure he almost heard an echo. He looked over and saw a group of public-school kids, uncivilised shoving each other their grey pants and white shirts untucked and messy. Except for one, towards the back was a thin blonde, he was probably the neatest of all of them. As he was being talked too by a girl with bushy brown hair. But the blonde, he was hot.
The pyre of wood sticks beneath them caught flame, Hermione felt the heat arc up beneath them.
“Who knows. Probably finding some trashy girl who resembles more of a gorilla than a human.”
“Really?” Harry asked.
Narcissa took a sip from her mug, "Are they happy?"
It turns out convincing his fellow Aurors to let him pull harmless pranks on Harry was easy. Round of drinks later, and Draco was able to saunter in and out of the Auror office without asking questions. On the Monday, which had required him to slip on Sunday night. And he wrapped every single item on Harry's desk in wrapping paper. The yells of anguish were an utter delight to Draco.
Draco was only moderately interested in the excursion. He was pretty sure Mum wouldn’t have been able to afford it, but with the child support check from Dad she insisted. Draco couldn’t think of anything worse, stuck on a bus with all the idiots he went to school with. He sat up the front near the teachers as all the boys who’d make it difficult for him would sit up the back. He stuck a piece of gum into his mouth.
"I thought I'd heard the Floo" Narcissa Malfoy said practically gliding into the room in a black lace, beaded gown that would have made Morticia Adams jealous. "Harry. I didn't believe we were expecting you" She said pursing his lips in consideration.
“Draco, until we kill whoever bit Ron. He’s dangerous”
“But how can I have a baby” Harry had replied.
Eventually after getting dressed and showering and breakfast. Draco was insistent on having breakfast every day, as left to his own devices Harry would often skip it. Harry often found Draco was more organised, Harry was haphazard. Going by the seat of his pants, Draco on the other hand was insisting having everything organised.
“Draco. Where are you?”
"Well, off you go. I'm sure Draco will lecture you if you're late" Sirius teased, ushering Harry out of the bedroom.
“Papa!” Lily said in horror, although she couldn’t help but laugh. “Neville?”
Harry embraced Draco, holding him tightly in his arms. “I love you...” he said into Draco’s shoulder.
"Relax dear!" Narcissa warned. She was standing back, letting it happen.
"Harry! Wait for me!" Draco protested as he quickly hung his coat up and followed Harry into the floo. The two almost pressed against each other. "Bit snug" Draco said ignoring the scowl.
“However, wizards have a higher survival rate than Muggles do regarding pregnancies. Especially considering you’ll need to be induced.”
"Of course. Especially with you pregnant" Draco said his smile returning. "Now Where has Weasley got to."
“Blimey Draco, this is miles nicer than your other Mansion. This place has a colour other than dreary.”
A loud trembling howl echoed above them. Elaine blew out the candle. Ron moved away from the door instinctively, Harry looked toward the shuttered window. The sound of heavy footfalls and the sound startled horse whinnying and baying. Suddenly cut short.
“I thought you were going home?” Harry said looking over at Ron, who had sat back down.
Scorpius just stared impressed, Draco stuck his spoon in and took a big bite and groaned. As he chewed, “Utterly heavenly Harry. Merlin” Draco murmured and took another bite. “I love you!” He blurted a mouthful of pudding.
“We didn’t bloody murder them. The Beast did that!”
Draco's eyes flared. "Absolutely not. You’re forbidden."
Scorpius stayed to wait for dessert, and Draco sat next to him. “I’ve got the pudding” Harry said levitating a plate that had a literal flaming pudding. He extinguished the flame and cut a third and handing one to Draco, Scorpius and one for himself. A ball of homemade vanilla ice cream appeared alongside.
“No” Harry said scrawling with his quill.
“But you said”
"No, he's not..."
“So, when’s the funeral?” Scorpius asked, hesitating in the doorway and clutching a book tightly under his arm.
"Obviously," Lily said breaking into a fit of laughter, Draco following suit.
“Draco. I’m never ever going to claim to be an expert in pregnancy,” Ron declared.
“Ah. Potter, Malfoy. There you are” The Tall man with the dark long hair said.
Two hours later. Draco locked the door after Kicking the last customers out. He’d ended up putting a few silencing charms around. To avoid any more fireworks setting Harry off. “So, is this why you started a bar?” Ron realised.
“I don’t blame them. We are strangers and they’re scared” Hermione said.
“Asking nicely could have helped” Ron commented.
“Harry, you can look,” Lucinda reassured wryly. Harry peered out from between fingers and smiled as he saw four bundles lying wrapped up.
"A thatched roof" Draco grinned peering up at the ceiling in awe. Harry raised an eyebrow, "They're nice houses. Okay"
"Right, I'll go find him I need help with organising dinner," Draco said.
Mrs Malone nodded. "I know. But you’re getting there. Just keep going."
"Honestly though Harry, this is miles better than where we stuck” Ron complained. “Some bloody muggle. Who Draco and Hermione are convinced are a vampire mind you. Kept us locked in a church basement. Apparently, as it turns out because they think we are demons from Hell or some bloody nonsense. Who killed those two whose house we got invited too” Ron explained recounting every detail of it?
“I don’t care” Draco replied taking a long drag of his cigarette. Harry was sort of still looking at him, “didn’t you have to go to the toilet.”
"None so far" He said honestly.
Draco visibly paled. "To be frank. No! I did this to Harry, and I'm taking responsibility for our child. Am I clear?"
"Tea," Harry said, bringing in a tray and some cake.
"It's fine" he said brushing it off. "Come on tomorrow and we'll figure out this leave thing" He said clearly a little sheepish. Draco nodded.
"It's done" Harry reassured. "Maybe they'll come around to it in time..."
“They’re stupid. Fucking Claude chose McLaggan over me! He’s rubbish. He’s taken so many Bludgers to the head!”
Ron leaned over and whispered something in Hermione’s ear.
Suddenly the crowd all turned and stared at Harry. He suddenly realised he was very undressed in nothing but Pyjamas, Slippers and a dressing gown. There were a few camera flashes and Draco pushed to the front of the crowd sheepishly.
There was a loud bang from outside and the sounds of fireworks going off, a cheer erupted from the bar. Harry almost jumped, his hands began to shake and shoved them under his apron turning towards the wall. Bottles of wine and all kinds of spirits from the Bermuda Triangle to Dubai. He focused on the labels, on how full the bottles were struggling to occupy his mind.
Harry was sat in his office at the Ministry of Magic. He was getting closer to forty by the day. Grey hairs were beginning to appear in Harry’s dark head of hair, more lines on his face. Even his slim lanky figure was beginning to fill out around the middle. But that was probably due to the ministry canteen food, and the nights of take out alone. Grimmauld place empty with the kids back at Hogwarts. Ginny....well...he was alone.
“Well, how’s the house looking? How’s the nursery?”
Stone corridor and a flickering torch, shadows bathing the long corridor and paintings that seemed to move as Harry ran. He was clutching a long-carved stick in his hand.
"Wait. Wait. I don't want to miss this" Sirius said with a mischievous grin as he stepped out of the lounge.
“We’re not paying you. You need the practice,” Draco said simply. “Because your Dad seems to be dodging this: I’m not pregnant with one baby; I’m having four - Quadruplets in fact.”
"Yes. And no Ronald you're not suddenly going to be attracted to me" Draco said rolling his eyes.
"I was too angry at you. And I knew if I started getting dressed, I'd get all weepy and lose my train of thought."
“It’s good to see you. Draco has been suffocating” Harry admitted.
Draco it had turned was as Hermione suspected more in control as a wolf. His pureblood line giving him the role of Alpha, with Hermione and Ron as Beta’s. Ron was more excited by it, the increased strength and agility, and the healing. Hermione got used to it, although even Harry could tell she wasn't particularly pleased with having to obey Draco. Draco refused to turn Harry and insisted he would only do it if he were dying, which Harry understood.
“Biology” Otto replied as they walked out of the dining hall.
"I am. I don't have any reason to let you be involved, since you unceremoniously kicked me out" Draco said firmly. Sirius smirked and sipped his tea.
Draco was back to normal, other than some scaring which quickly faded as Harry rubbed cream into it. Hermione and Luna had come around to assist, helping manage the four babies as Draco recovered. Once he was awake and all four infants fed, Draco relaxed. “We did it.”
Harry looked at Draco heartbroken. "I love you..."
Draco chuckled, "You're pregnant isn't that enough."
"I was bored. The imagery of the tapestry, it's vivid" Harry muttered not meeting Draco's eye.
Not that they were the real ones either. Fake ones designed to torment and panic him. Draco had told him he needed to relax, but every time Harry lay down in bed, he found himself quickly getting bored.
"Thank you,” said Harry. “And the babies?"
Hermione suppressed a giggle. “How long until you're induced?”
"Right" Draco said looking at the coat he'd put on and taking it off. "I don't want soot getting on it, it's a nice coat."
Draco nodded, then repeated. “You should go home. And I should meet you there” Draco commented.
“Ron. That is why he left; it’s mating season. And we just brought Harry to him on a platter” Hermione realised.
“I’ll be fine. I just need a minute, it’s Bonfire Night I've got a good crowd, I’ll be fine” Harry insisted stubbornly.
“I'm Pregnant. You two can cope,” Draco commented.
“Draco Malfoy. The Master of the Malfoy Chateau" He waved a hand toward them. "Anyway, the bakery. My lover is keen for some of the freshest bread, and I do love to spoil him.”
“We broke up...” Harry said quietly.
“I am. I know how important he is to you. And I know I've been a lot,” Draco admitted.
“I am not Granger. And I hope you don’t wish I was” Draco Malfoy drawled.
Hermione shook her head as Draco turned back to the changing of the guard. Hermione seemed to disappear after that, she didn’t sit next to Draco on the bus back. He didn’t see at her at school again either. It was almost as if she hadn’t existed at all.
Harry smiled as he waddled over a loose robe done up loosely around his waist. His baby bump, “Is it warm, I wouldn’t mind sitting in the garden for lunch.”
"Draco, I'm a grandmother. The one thing I look forward to doing, is spoiling him and giving him back" Narcissa said simply.
Harry looked at Draco with a firm glare.
“Yes. But I’m 21 Granger I wanted to wait a few years before I conceived a child” Draco muttered. “Instead, you bring my mate to me during breeding season. Thank you for that.”
“No?” Draco questioned with a weary sigh.
“You know. Your ex Algy was staring at you in history class” Otto commented.
“Bu my mum had seven pregnancies, and she’s still kicking. Draco, I'm sure you’ll be fine,” Ron insisted.
Draco blushed and let go. "Sorry. I..."
Harry lounged lazily in one of the high-backed chairs in one of the schools many study areas. He waited patiently for his parent’s arrival, curious to why they wanted to see him. Apart from parents’ days and term break he didn’t see them otherwise.
“I won’t know until I give birth,” Draco smiled. “This pregnancy was a surprise. I figure I might as well keep that going.”
"Sirius isn't cooking, is he? Last thing I want is food poisoning again," Ron frowned.
Hermione grabbed her wand “Incendio Maxima” She cast, and a jet of fire erupted from the tip.
“What have you done Potter!” Draco yelled as his voice got further and further away.
“Well...” Draco hummed uncertainly.
“Yes. The landing will have to do” She sighed as she lay him down against the stairs and sprinted down and scooped up the cushions. Grabbing her wand out. “Harry have your wand at the ready.”
“Your wizard friend is with child, yes?”
"Lucius..." Narcissa said giving her husband a look.
“It was a dark artefact; it’s supposed to trap the user in a world without magic” Hermione butted in.
Harry smiled and handed Hermione a teacup. “Draco, do you want me to get you a hot water bottle or an ice pack? Or...”
Draco smirked a little. While he was still stressed, he relaxed. There wasn't anything he could do. Harry had to deliver their baby, he just had to wait. They did wait and the hours seemed to drag on.
The Bus pulled up in the coach parking that sat next to Windsor station, there was gift shops and a cafe near a staircase the wound around a column. The whole area was loaded with tourists. As they all walked off the bus, “Remember your representing the school” Ms Clarke the History teacher yelled.
“Merlin’s balls...” Ron muttered staring.
“Really?” Harry squinted.
Ron Weasley grinned, his chin had a thick layer of orange stubble. Where he hadn’t shaven for a couple of days. “Ooh. Thanks Harry” Ron grinned and took a sip, “Perfect. The perks of having a best friend who owns are bar.”
“Lucius and Narcissa know” Harry commented aware that wasn’t a helpful answer. “Normality helps, I don’t have it severely. And everyone would start making a big deal about it.”
Harry frowned, “No protest? Just, okay?” he squinted.
Harry reached out and placed a plump hand on Draco’s stomach, “wow. Err. I’m sorry about that...”
"We'll repent!" Hermione offered wriggling.
"Sure, I failed with Ron over there. But you try and that's the point" Mrs Weasley reassured.
“I’ve got to say it Harry, you have terrible taste in blokes. Pregnant Malfoy, if he’s not enough of a pain already” Ron murmured.
“But four? I want to be excited. But I’m terrified. Hermione, what if Draco or I die before they're of age? What will they think when their parents are old enough to be their grandparents?" Harry vented; they were worries he hadn’t been comfortable to admit to Draco.
“He’s making me get the snip,” Harry admitted. “But I've been trying hard to take the..."
“Are you gay?” She asked with an amused smile.
“Triplets?” Harry winced, now beginning to understand why Draco was livid.
“You’re pregnant and running out of room. Stop being hard on yourself,” Harry said, rubbing the roundest part of Draco’s stomach.
Instead somehow, Draco was able to convince Harry that he should meet his parents. He was sure he must have been nauseated or at the least too tired and not paying attention at the time.
“He had none: His flight was madness: when our actions do not, Our fears do make us traitors” Draco answered pursing his lips. His eyes glancing up at the ticking clock. Waiting for it to hit 12:35 and for lunch bell to ring.
"James is with Molly. He's perfect."
"I have done what is necessary. Your kind has cursed this land with your magical sins. I spent years wiping out the Wolves who resided here. In God's will, I refuse to allow it to happen again. Daemons and Sinners like yourselves must be punished" He said squatting Infront of Harry. He reached a hand and stroked Harry’s belly. “Your child will be an adequate sacrifice.”
Harry sighed, frustrated with himself, and Draco rubbed his shoulder sympathetically.
"Well. I was a massive git at Hogwarts and frankly, I could have ended up imprisoned if it wasn’t for his intervention. But he has always been good to me. He treated me better than I was used to and cared about my wellbeing, wanting to make sure I was comfortable," Draco said, smiling as he remembered. "I didn't really believe that he wanted me until he proposed. I perhaps expected, at some point, for him to get bored. After we got married, I felt comfortable, and my anxieties about my relationship disappeared. We began to consider about having our own children. Your grandparent’s wanted an heir and Harry has always wanted a family of his own,” Draco explained, rubbing his belly gently. “Why?”
Hermione looked surprised. “I’m impressed about your restraint in not bringing it up with Ron,” she admitted as Draco grinned like a cat.
"I think you're just fat," Harry commented, pressing his hand to Draco's stomach covered in old stretch marks from his previous pregnancies; the skin was soft and plump.
It was different, it felt like that one time he'd used a butt plug. Tight but not. Mrs Malone had gloves on and gently examined Harrys hairy asshole. He wished he'd waxed or trimmed, or something. "You're dilated. That's good, if you start to feel light headed let me know"
“Yeah, Harry is” Ron replied without thinking. He started scratching at his neck where two puncture wounds had healed over.
“No, which is only for the best, as I’m grateful your father has run out of influential individuals to name them after.”
“Long night?” Harry asked.
Harrys legs were spread, he felt exposed, his cock limp on display, his asshole the focus of two sets of his eyes.
“Melbourne Breakfast?” Hermione squinted.
“Hey. It’s Draco. Remember we...shagged” Draco hesitated.
"How?" Ron blinked perplexed.
Harry rested for the rest of the full moon. Draco named their son James Sirius Malfoy and spent the next few days refusing to give Harry to have a moment of peace. Hermione sent word to the French Ministry of Magic, they sent Auror’s and removed any remaining vampires from the village. The Reverend had been embedded in the town for 200 years, keeping the village submissive to him while they remained useful. He'd been the one to kill Herman and Elaine after Draco had knocked them out. Using the opportunity to use Ron and Hermione as scapegoats for their deaths.
"Agents of Satan! Evils sent to lead us from God" A figure declared silencing the rabble. He was in all black, with dark receding hair and pale skin. He had a clerical collar and held a wooden crucifix in one hand and a copy of the bible in the other. He could almost have been handsome if he hadn’t decided to become a religious extremist.
James swore under his breath and walked into the laundry, dumping his muddy Quidditch gear into the sink. “I don’t want to talk about it.”
“The Manor on the edge of town, it has been empty for years. My grandfather told me stories of the beasts who roamed the mountain. Who would take young people from their beds on the night of the first full moon? On the third night, they would return unharmed but soon they would swell with the beast's progeny. Generations this village lived in fear until it just started to kill people, bodies drained of blood.”
Draco’s mouth fell open. “That the definition of big. Potter”
” Draco growled. Although Harry realised Draco hadn’t said it out loud.
“Trust me, I built four of them. James and I struggled,” Harry maintained. “But it’s ready. We’re not painting it though. They’ll make do.”
“They murdered two of the Congregation and drained them of blood.”
Lily squinted. “That makes even less sense.”
Lily’s eyes widened in horror. “They do what? I am never getting pregnant. You don’t feel anything do you?”
“Well?” Draco asked exasperated.
“That’s not what they’re saying,” Harry insisted.
. "Draco"
“The point is we want you involved,” Harry reinforced.
"He has a thing for your son," Draco said casually. "I caught Hugo with his tongue down Scorpius throat during the summer.”
“He’ll leave. Put your wand away” Hermione hissed across at Ron. Huddling the blanket tighter around herself.
“Potter!”
“Come on Harry” Otto said tugging on his arm. “Mr Jones will kill us if we’re late.”
"Sorry," Harry apologised. "I have to spoil him twice as much to combat his self-doubt.”
“So, I am big?” Draco bristled.
“A task Master?”
“So, you can get free babysitting? Right... I want to be paid” James crossed his arms.
“I remember” Harry yawned. “What’s up?”
"Wait. You're a Veela?" Hermione said squinting. Ron stared and took a huge step backwards in worry.
"Tea is fine" Draco said politely, as he was handed a teacup.
“Right,” Albus smiled wryly, picking the box up. “Why aren't you making James help us?”
Draco grabbed Ron and pushed him to the ground putting his hand firmly on his chest. As he began to transform. Bones cracking, and clothes ripping as his taught body began to transform into a hulking furry beast that loomed over Ron.
“Seeing each other” Harry confirmed with a smile. “If that’s okay with you?”
“And you’ve had five children. There aren’t that many who would be expected to have kept their figure,” Hermione offered. “I’m not as thin as I was at Hogwarts.”
Harry grinned. “You took my virginity, I think. Because I don’t know if the other relationships I had there counted.”
Lily pursed her lips. “I’m not rising to that Papa. Alright, anyway, hmm, I’m assuming that Harry Jr or Ron Jr is off the table.”
Harry put his hand on Draco's shoulder and straightened. "It's only one of the fake ones."
“Mhmmm," Draco said leaning into Harry his hands pushing at Harry's clothes. "You have too much fabric on.”
Harry frowned, "Of course you're good at packing charms..."
"Hermione went up there. It'll be fine Draco, seriously and I hate to say it. I don't think Harry is totally hating being pregnant" Ron grinned.
“No, you won’t,” Callum replied, smirking.
The kitchen was almost humid which wasn’t that unusual considering the house elf often cooked up a storm. There was however an unusual sight standing in the kitchen. Harry Potter was standing watching a large pot.
“He doesn’t like attention unless it involves me being naked” Draco remarked from the other side of the bar.
“I just orgasmed Draco and we’re in the middle of a fight” Harry muttered.
"Yes, that's bad. Enjoys how?" Draco questioned nervously.
“Minerva Hermione Potter,” Harry smiled. “I nagged her into letting me use it as a middle name.”
Harry nodded and followed Draco upstairs to his bedroom in silence. "You can stay with me" Harry insisted.
"He's perfect" Draco said lovingly. "So perfect. Is Harry okay?"
"I've come to see my son. And be here for the birth of my grandson" Narcissa insisted pushing past Sirius.
“Why’s he there?” Draco asked quizzically.
"I did" Draco agreed his face flushing. As he sat down on the bed. "How do you feel?"
Draco turned and looked at Harry's belly, "Maybe a bit, but you’re pregnant and a male. Frankly I have no reference point. So, if you are I don't care, as long as the baby is healthy."
Harry looked surprised, they hadn’t really defined what he and Draco were. But he understood how important his relationship with his son was.
To make matters worse, Hermione had mentioned some mating thing, and perhaps he if he'd actually listened. He might not be in this situation.
Hermione smirked a little, "I'll give you a hand." She said as she passed the plates out. "So how did you and Harry...become you know?"
“Really?” Harry blinked surprised.
“Alright” Harry nodded rubbing his belly. Draco cupped It and smiled as the baby kicked. “Either way I'm certain it’ll be an amazing quidditch player.”
Harry was very quickly becoming fed up It been almost nine months. He wanted his baby out. "Where's Draco!" Harry bellowed in frustration as he turned and began to waddle back the other way.
"Your mothers here. I haven't let her in yet, I figured you'd prefer to greet her" Sirius gestured to the door with his mug.
"Uh huh..." Ron said smirking. "I think you’re brave enough being in the same room. I mean mum never let dad in with her."
“Faggot!” Someone coughed snickering. Probably Andre one of the footballers.
"Your child. It looks healthy, growing nice and steadily. Six months by the looks of it" Mrs Malone explained. "Would you like to know the gender?"
“I’m just saying, we could rock up and he’ll tell you to bugger off” Ron offered reasonably.
But the main problem with working in The Ministry of Magic. For such a large organisation, with so many people. It could be agonisingly small. Even the Department of Law Enforcement, although Draco worked for the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts. And aware of the irony that a Weasley was his boss.
"You're getting a gut mate." Ron said leaning over to prod Harry's tummy.
“We should be able to use this for the sauce. Better than your Tesco liquor Potter” Draco said with a smirk.
“You didn’t have to be that rude” Hermione said looking at him.
The moment his foot hit the bottom step; the doorbell rang. "Course they're early," he mumbled as he opened the front door. Standing there was Ron and Hermione. Ron had a six pack of beer under his arm and Hermione was dressed in nice robes, probably the same ones she'd been wearing all day at work presumably.
“Ron stop it we’ve all been through a lot since the war. Draco especially what Voldemort had Fenrir do well it’s unthinkable” Hermione muttered. "Look up ahead" Hermione pointed her arm, over the tops of the trees. The roofs of buildings could almost be spotted through the heavy snowfall.
"Ow! Merlin!" Draco swore.
Harry ignored him. “Come on. There’s time for some tea and some cake.”
Narcissa seemed to gaze up and down at Harry. "You look fatter Harry. I assume that wasn't Draco's doing."
“I knew better” Draco smirked. “Should have seen his face. Very worth the four years studying” Draco grinned, as he went to serve some more customers. Pouring glasses of beer and cocktails.
Harry grinned. "Thank you.”
“Granger...ten...” Snape trailed off. “The point is you shouldn’t be here.”
“Seriously. Look at this” Otto said shoving a newspaper in his face. As they sat in the back row of the bus “They’re all single...”
“Actually, we agree on quite a lot. I just play devil's advocate because it annoys him,” admitted Draco, grinning.
Harry elbowed him firmly. "Watch it."
“Ron what's got into you," Hermione said shaking her head.
“I don’t like the inference,” Draco replied haughtily.
Draco smirked, as Harry walked in and slammed the charred and half melted MP3 player on the desk.
“So... Is it girls? Do you know what you're having?” Lily questioned.
“Hermione! Ron!” Harry grinned.
"So, you had choices? And you still choose him?" Ron said in disbelief.
Ron's face dropped. "What's bloody Malfoy doing here?" Ron swore horrified.
“Ouch,” Harry commented from the doorway. “What kind of tea would you like: Green, Camomile, English Breakfast or Melbourne Breakfast?”
“Draco has control as a Wolf?” Hermione said.
Harry groaned and woke up with a start. “Christ. Did you have to!” Harry said yawning.
“Technically it’s a type of wolf” Hermione nodded slowly.
“Huh?” Draco said looking up at her.
“No even this candle is a risk, we daren’t light a fire" She hissed. "Please come in!" She insisted on stepping back from her door. Harry, Hermione, and Ron followed the woman into the house. It was dark and as their eyes adjusted, they could almost make out a table in the centre of the room. The outlines of a couple of chairs and an empty hearth. The woman closed the door and set the candle down on the table. "A few minutes should be safe. Should be safe."
Within minutes, Sirius and Narcissa were awake and Fire calls went out to Mrs Malone the midwife, Ron and Hermione, And Mr And Mrs Weasley.
“Am I fat?” Harry asked Otto as he fished out his Pyjamas from his wardrobe.
“Elaine, why did you open the door! Who are these strangers” An older bearded man hissed growling at the girl.
"Oh, four?" Harry asked, becoming pale. He was definitely in trouble.
Draco shrugged. Then considered, “I’d like to kiss you again probably more than I should. But there’s something you should probably tell you first” Draco sighed as he pulled up his sleeve, revealing the dark mark.
“Yes, but Weasley is a fat lump. It was to be expected that you’d end up putting on weight married to him,” Draco replied pithily and then sighed, collapsing into Harry’s arms “Fine. Obviously, I ought to be on a diet then.”
“Snarl all you like. I cleansed your kind from this land, and I will do so again” Trask declared. “My Congregation craves blood” He grinned with outstretched arms. The Villagers stretched forward. Draco backed back.
He'd also been putting off telling Ron and Hermione. He'd attempted a couple of times but both times he'd chickened out. Mostly as Ron had brought up Ginny's upcoming wedding and everything got
"Well. Draco, you aren't wrong that pregnancy at your age is risky, especially with multiples. There is a real possibility that all four children may not survive to full term,” Hermione begun.
Harry nodded slowly as Draco led him to the dining room. "Your parents know your gay right?"
“It’s your own fault. Now sit” He insisted. “Enjoy your strawberries and I'll sort out some lunch” Draco smiled kissing Harry firmly.
“We don’t. Just get on with your life” Draco dismissed.
“He’s learning to shave. I recall you weren’t any better,” Draco pointed out coolly. “Go sit down, all of you.” Begrudgingly the five siblings sat around the kitchen table, all waiting.
“I don’t want a pity friendship” Draco answered snappily.
“During the full moons, I’ve had this urge to turn you all” Draco commented going red.
"I figured it out!" Hermione said coming down the staircase with a stack of books in her hand.
“Oh yes. You just want to be alone” Harry rolled his eyes.
Harry rubbed his engorged stomach. It was a unique situation, given that since he and Draco had had sex less than three months ago the idea that he was practically full term with a baby was a strange concept. Strange was an understatement.
“You're having quadruplets. The answer should be obvious,” Harry pointed out.
Suddenly Draco skidded into the room almost tripping on the carpet in a very un-Malfoy like manner. His hair dripping wet, shirt open exposing his pale skin and flat abs. It took a lot of self-control for Harry to not let out a moan. "Harry! You're Early!" Draco said giving an awkward glance to his mother as he went to Harry's side.
“You just going to gloss over us almost being burned at the stake?” Ron frowned.
“I locked Potter in the tower room and when I went to check on him. He’d already jacked off to antique tapestry. Honestly, he's so damn sexually repressed he can't even keep his hands to himself” Draco muttered. “Now come along, I need to pick some supplies for Harry. He’s craving bread and strawberries.”
Sirius offered to accompany Harry, mostly Harry was sure he just wanted to stir the pot. Harry had declined, as he could tell Draco was already uncomfortable by the idea. He'd even given Harry a list of topics not to mention. Albus Dumbledore
Draco kneeled and undid Harry’s shoes and removed his socks. “I can run you a bath later if you wish?”
“Your parents will be here this afternoon. They want to talk to you” Headmaster Ryan said firmly his mouth going into a straight line.
Harry winced. "He's my..."
"You're supposed to be at home" Draco hissed, fully aware everyone was staring at him as he came to Harry's side.
“So, we really had sex” Harry said going pale.
Harry squinted, "I'll hex you! But Draco just wants me to make a good impression" Harry admitted. "He's nervous, I don't blame him either."
Draco leaned back in his chair, “Whatever do you mean Potter? You act like they’re was ever peace between us.”
“Thank you, I’m glad you’re okay with this” Harry said honestly. “It’s very mature of you.”
“Do you have plans?” Draco squinted.
“They won’t care” Hermione reasoned, “And if anything happens you have five practically adult children who will help and lots of friends who will support you.”
Harry picked a strawberry dipping it in chocolate and ate it.
"Yes. Harry is spread eagled. And Draco is between his legs" Hermione said rolling her eyes and walking in.
Narcissa forced a smile. "Hello."
as hard as he expected.
"No," Draco said flatly.
"Uncle. Pretty sure they will care. That's the point. I'll get a lecture that'll put me into labour." Harry pouted; Draco could sense the guilt in Harry's words.
Draco smiled and leaned into Harry, and the two began to kiss. “Well I did raise him right” Draco commented as he pulled away from the kiss.
Draco sighed in exasperation and threw his head back. "Honestly. You'll be the death of me" he looked at Harry. "I told you I'd be home at six. Then I'm all yours for the rest of the night."
Draco sighed. “I find it egregious when you use logic on me. Can you at least get me some ice cream?”
“Look. Harry mate, this whole place is wrong” Ron insisted.
“Err. Can I grab another round of beers?” A Wizard in puce coloured robes asked interrupting.
By lunchtime Draco was positively terrified. He went down to the canteen on the first floor. He saw Harry sitting with Hermione, Draco kept to himself. Occasionally Harry would peer at Draco out of the corner of my eye. And yet nothing.
Before Draco growled deeply, stopping Ron dead in his tracks.
"Okay, Hun,” said Harry, rubbing Draco’s shoulders.
"He'll have to. I'm having Quadruplets; he's got to make up for that. Otherwise yes, this is the backup plan.”
“Perhaps if you hadn’t dropped everything to come after me, we could have avoided this” Draco had sighed. “There are worse mates to have a child with.”
There was a loud knock on the front door. "Who the hell is that" Draco said frustrated.
"He has your eyes and your jaw" Narcissa smiled warmly. "I've put the soiled towels in the wash. Mrs Malone is just having some tea downstairs..."
"Harry!" Draco said horrified.
"Higher," Draco answered gravely
“They had just arrived; they would be slain on our doorstep” The girl hissed back at the older man.
“Woah? Malfoy getting fat, are you?” Ron sniggered as he heaved himself up.
Draco glared, “No as a matter of fact, I’m having Potters bastard” Draco snapped irritably.
"I'm sorry about this Mr Cuff. I'll get this one home and write up the article and hand it in" Draco apologised profusely.
“Well they’re making me take long service leave at work, anyway your Mother and I are going on a cruise” His father said patting Harrys shoulder.
Harry sighed considering and looked at Draco's pleading eyes. He did care, and he was probably right. “Alright. Alright” he said sitting down on one of the bar stools. “Get to work Draco” Harry smirked.
"Hello Minister" Draco said politely with reverence.
“We can do that” Draco nodded. “I also stopped and got some strawberries; I know how you have that sweet tooth," he said levitating a platter over with melted chocolate and honey and other delights to Harry.
