Malfoy entered Harrys flat quickly and suddenly. He stepped out onto the rug in front of the fireplace looked directly at Harry. Harry, being surprised and dumbstruck, just stared at Draco.
“Malfoy?” Harry replied, stunned.
“I just assumed Granger did all of the reading and you and the weasel copied from her.” Draco shrugged.
He felt hot, wet tears streaming down his face and he didn’t know how to stop them. He felt the hand remain on his shoulder as the tears came faster and harder and his breathing began to labor and hitch in his chest. He couldn’t understand why he was crying, and he hated the fact that it was happening in front of Harry Fucking Potter but at this moment, he couldn’t change what was going on, so he just let it continue. He felt as if he was crying forever when the tears finally began to cease, either that or he just physically couldn’t produce tears anymore, either way, he was glad it was stopping. He looked up and saw that Harry had moved on the couch and was sitting closer to him, hand still on his shoulder and a look of concern on his face, but sympathy playing in his eyes. He went to tear his gaze away from Harry when he heard a movement behind Harry and he looked up to see Teddy standing there, holding his stuffed wolf that Draco had gotten him, staring at Draco with intense sadness in his eyes. The boy ran over to him so quickly that he couldn’t stop him even if he had tried to.
“Sorry about that mate. Forgot that you’re probably not used to that.” Weasley let Draco go and took a step back, making room for Granger in the space. Draco simply nodded, not saying a word, terrified that he might say something that would upset either one of them and would make Harry run to the rescue, which he didn’t want to happen.
“Of course I remember your sorting Mr. Potter. It was one for the history books. Never in my years as being the sorting hat for Hogwarts have I had a student that was able to be placed in two different houses so well.”
“Well I bloody well wasn’t expecting you to reach out at –,” Harry looked at the clock. “10 O’clock at night.”
“The sorting hat? You’re not serious Harry.” Draco said in disbelief.
Harry,
“Oh Harry,” Mrs. Weasley swung a dish towel that she had over her shoulder at him playfully, “stop it, you’re going to make me blush.” She grinned like a child and was already blushing a bright red that almost matched the bundle of curly red hair that sat playfully on her head. She took a step towards Draco and held out her hand gently to him and smiled. “Draco, it is such a pleasure to have you in our home. I hope you’re hungry. I tend to make enough food to feed a dragon when my children are home, and I still always have leftovers.”
“Yeah, Ted was okay when he got up this morning.”
“Actually, when it comes to you, he doesn’t tell us much. Just that you two have been spending more time together and that this little monster seems to just adore you.” She smiled and looked down at Teddy who was now playing with a necklace that she wore, and ruffled his hair, which was a bright green at this moment.
“Well to be honest, if it hadn’t been for Hermione, we probably would have been dead.”
Harry smiled and looked back at Teddy’s door, remembering the day that he was brought home and he couldn’t have imagined a better moment in his life. The dreams had subsided significantly, and the bad days didn’t seem so bad since Teddy arrived. Harry was so grateful for his godson. He looked down at his tumbler and noticed it was empty. He leaned to grab the bottle of scotch and refill it when the fire turned green and he saw Malfoy. He looked at the clock, it said 10 O’clock. Harry nodded and Malfoy walked in, sat down, and poured a glass of whiskey.
Draco stood suddenly and rushed out of the bar, leaving the bartender calling after him in complete confusion. Once outside, he leaned back against the brick wall and pulled out a cigarette. It was a filthy habit that he had picked up during the war, and he just never had a reason to quit, even when his wife,
“Sure.”
from Harry. He simply nodded and pulled himself up off the floor finally.
The next thing he knew he was staring into deep dark brown eyes, eyes that made his heart stop, eyes that filled his whole body and soul with the feeling of being complete. He stared at this little human in his arms, the little bit of hair on his head was strikingly blonde like his own, but he could see the ends start to curl. He smiled as the little one in his arms looked back at him with intense curiosity and smiled. He smiled at him. At Draco. At that moment Draco knew that there was nothing in this world that he wouldn’t do to protect this small, fragile, perfect child. He was lost in adoration of his son when Astoria’s voice broke the quiet.
The rest of the week seemed to fly by, with Ron and Hermione finally letting go of their constant questions and Draco still making his nightly 10 o’clock visits, Harry was shocked when he woke up Saturday morning to the smell of…
“Aunt Molly’s invited us over for dinner tonight, would you like to go?” He smiled down at the now silver haired child, who nodded eagerly.
, so he hadn’t really needed to wear them anymore. After deciding that most of the wardrobe in his closet was far too fancy to wear to meet a child, he decided on a simple white button-down shirt, with a pair of navy-blue trousers and loafers. He looked himself over in the full-length mirror and scoffed, thinking that his younger self would be appalled at the man standing in the mirror. He didn’t have a proper waistcoat, or cufflinks, or a tie, he just looked, simple. But he didn’t have the energy or effort to put into any of that and figured Potter would take the piss out of him if he met Teddy that way.
“Just trying to talk? Are you fucking kidding me Potter? Since when do you just want to talk to me?” Draco’s voice was getting louder with each word he spoke.
“And who better than you ‘Mione? You’re the smartest person I know.” He turned to look at her as they finally reached his office door.
“What’s that?” He pointed to the tattoo that caught his interest.
“No, seriously. I may not have been expecting you this early, but I’ve got plenty of food here and the only person I know that can eat all of this by themselves is Ron.” He saw the man laugh slightly as he said this.
“But he can help, I promise.” Teddy pushed the wolf further towards Draco, obviously not taking no for an answer.
“I really am sorry Meda.” Harry looked down at his feet and shuffled, he really hated coming by late to get Teddy, it always made him feel bad.
“For?” He put his cup on the table and leaned with his hands clasped in front of him, elbows on his knees.
"Draco Malfoy got hit by a curse that turned him into a girl."
Weasley nodded in agreement. "What should we do, then?"
“I — I look forward to it, my Lord.”
Pansy opened her mouth to explain, but just then Theo opened the door.
There wasn't enough room out in the hall to come to a graceful stop; he and Malfoy went tumbling to the ground next to Ron and Hermione and Goyle.
"Malfoy?" he guessed.
“Ophis,” Draco told him, but the Dark Lord had started making some very strange hissing noises and didn’t appear to hear him. Draco was confused until Ophis began making similar sounds, too, and then he realized that the Dark Lord must be speaking Parseltongue. Somehow that made Draco even more afraid than before, but, as if he sensed Draco’s ratcheting fear, Ophis gently butted his head against Draco’s fingers, and he instantly felt better.
"Come on," Pansy grabbed Draco's hand as soon as they were inside, "you need at least one more drink."
Harry managed to find his voice again. "I don't understand. How can... are you okay with it?"
"Other than being an oblivious ferret?"
. Perhaps it was because he’d only ever talked to his mother, but he simply loved listening to Harry tell him about all the places beyond Draco’s tower that he’d been, even though Harry was a terrible storyteller and frequently had to backtrack in the middle of his stories.
“I see,” the Dark Lord nodded, and then turned his attention back to Draco. “Draco, I will soon become something of a father figure to you.”
reason you're so… infatuated with Malfoy?"
“Good,” said the boy. “My name’s Harry. Harry Potter.”
Pansy sighed. "It's really not a big deal, Draco. Come on, let's just go to dinner."
"Er, what I mean is," Harry said, trying not to sound like an idiot and also not feel overwhelmed by how distractingly close Malfoy was, "I think floral's a good look on you."
Harry was holding out his hand outstretched to Draco, smiling eagerly.
Harry had gone to
Nothing happened.
The last thing Harry saw as they Disapparated from the parlor was Malfoy's steady grey eyes.
"I lied to you," Harry said, and then he paused and glanced at Ron briefly. Ron's only reaction was a brief nod for him to continue, so Harry looked away again and kept talking.
“Really? What is it?”
"Draco! Fetch Draco, he'll know."
Blaise snorted. "It's more humiliating for us, mate."
The truth was that Draco didn’t really want to leave his mother, but sometimes… he just felt a little stifled. Which was ridiculous, of course, because she only came and visited him once a week, and the rest of the time he had the tower to himself.
“Wait!” Draco cried out, just before Harry tilted his broomstick away from the tower. “Don’t come tomorrow, my mother’s visiting.”
But there was no way out of it, at least not that Draco could think of. He was at their mercy, trapped in his tower with no one to—
"That would be preferable," Hermione said firmly.
"Jamie," he said, thinking quickly. "Don't know anyone with that name."
"Nah, I got nothing," Ron shrugged. "Hey, want to go to Hogsmeade with Hermione and me tomorrow night?"
“That
"I've been meaning to ask you," Ron said hesitantly, as they sat on the beach in front of Shell Cottage together, "are you… alright?"
“Draco, I have wonderful news!”
wonderful, Mother,” Draco said with false cheer.
He looked confused, and Harry realized with some relief that it was so loud that Malfoy probably hadn't heard what he'd said.
Slowly, he approached his window, growing more uncertain with every step. Would he even be able to leave? There were spells on spells preventing people getting in, were there ones to stop him getting out, too?
"Okay," Harry said slowly, "I think I've had enough studying for today. I'm just gonna go get a snack, maybe fly around the pitch or something. See you later!"
"Happy birthday, Harry!"
? Oh, why can't the world be consumed by Fiendfyre?"
"And that's why I was watching him on the Map, Hermione! I'm sure he's doing… something!" Harry gesticulated wildly, hoping this would somehow help Hermione understand that he was totally justified in stalking Malfoy on the Map, but her gaze was still flatly unimpressed.
“You’d — really?”
"Potter does not think you're ugly," Blaise laughed.
Draco had wished to go so many places outside his tower, he wouldn’t have known which one to pick first. Just to go anywhere beyond the tower had seemed like a distant dream up until a minute ago.
"I look ridiculous," wailed the sad, pathetic excuse of a ferret in front of her. "I just can't."
"Fine!" Pansy snapped, feeling her eye start to twitch. "I'll go down and bring you back dinner, but you owe me!"
Harry asked Draco questions about himself, too, but Draco found it far more interesting to hear about Harry, so he mostly deflected those questions and turned the conversation back around. Harry visited him every day and stayed for hours, and Draco enjoyed his visits so much that on the sixth day, he almost forgot to warn Harry.
"Hard no on the cupboards." Weasley grimaced. "I dunno, Sticking Charm?"
Draco felt almost giddy with success. He’d done it. He’d left his tower. Harry would take him anywhere; he could go see the ocean, meet magical beasts and beings, even go to Hogwarts, if he wanted! The entire world was somewhere out there beyond the trees, just waiting for him.
Pansy looked over at the Gryffindor table. Potter did look disgruntled, but by no means did she get the impression that he had any issue at all with Draco's clothing.
"Oh, don't worry, Weasley," Pansy smiled. "It's the perfect solution."
“I’d like nothing better.”
Harry slept in on his birthday. It wasn't intentional, but the flight from Privet Drive and loss of Moody had left his sleep somewhat disjointed the last few nights. He enjoyed the feeling of waking up slowly and well-rested, until Ron barged in.
Hermione gave him a flat stare and then returned to her Ancient Runes notes, waving a hand imperiously at Ron, who gave a large sigh.
Harry was only vaguely familiar with the music, but soon a song began playing that it seemed the crowd was enthusiastically fond of, and they became much more energetic. Harry briefly lost his footing in the fray and ended up bumping against the back of someone. He meant to turn around and apologize, but it was too crowded to do so, and it quickly became apparent that whoever it was had no hard feelings about it at all, because they began to move intentionally against Harry's backside. Harry was surprised, but the sensation wasn't unpleasant, and he found himself responding in kind.
Harry swooped down closely behind them and reached down for Malfoy, managing to grab him by the hand, and taking the broom up higher before he helped Malfoy up behind him.
Harry digested this for a minute. He still wasn't fully sure how he felt about Malfoy, specifically, being his soulmate, but Ron's explanation made him feel at least a little bit better about it.
"I'm wearing girls' clothing," Draco hissed. "It's disgraceful, not attractive. Just look at Potter; he clearly thinks I'm ugly."
“Ah!” It had burnt him. Draco glared at his mug while pulling out his wand and casting a Cooling Charm. He went to take another sip, and then froze with his mug halfway to his lips, suddenly realizing that he was not actually dreaming. He slowly looked back up, and the boy was still sitting there, watching Draco in clear amusement.
"I don't know if I even want to look in a mirror," Draco said warily, looking down at himself. "Why can't I have a full shirt, again?"
He tugged his sleeve back down over his wrist as he went, although he knew it wouldn't make a difference. The same five letters — the same name — would still be there when he looked again later, unchanged.
All purebloods had been required to take Muggle Studies this year, and Ronald Weasley was no exception, although he always looked considerably happier to be there than anyone else did. Normally, Pansy partnered with Draco, but today she timed her arrival in the classroom so as to be sure that one of the others would partner him first, and she elbowed everyone else out of the way until she was sitting next to Weasley.
By lunch, Harry realized that it was absolutely impossible for him to ignore Malfoy. He had been cultivating the habit of watching Malfoy for so long that it was extremely difficult to stop, and it didn't help that he was now acknowledging to himself that Malfoy was attractive. It also didn't help that Malfoy appeared to be hiding from him, which only made him curious as to why.
"What other reason would there be, Hermione?" he asked, wracking his brain. "Wait! You're in Runes with him, yeah? Did he do something? Say something?"
It was Harry, hovering outside his window on his broomstick. Draco tried to stop his sobs, but he only succeeded at slowing them a little.
"What're you playing at, Malfoy?" Goyle asked.
"Hogsmeade?" Harry asked, bewildered by the sudden change in subject. "Sure, I guess. Where are we going? Three Broomsticks?"
"What are you doing, Pans?" the boy in question asked her from his face-down position on his bed.
"Yes, it is!" Draco moaned, flinging an arm across his face dramatically. "It's like an ah-pocky, a pock-lisp, an — oh, whatever the Muggles call it!"
Harry hesitated for a second, and couldn't help looking at Malfoy himself.
"What'd I say," Ron said, with a bit of a smug smile. "Malfoy's a git, but he's too smart to ignore Magic."
The whole of Hogwarts, it appeared, agreed with her: Draco was hot, no matter what clothing he happened to be in. Even more interestingly, the rest of Hogwarts also included one green-eyed, bespectacled Savior of the Wizarding World, who had apparently forgotten how to chew upon seeing Draco. The sight of his open mouth was horribly unattractive.
"What is this? What's happened, Cissy?"
Ginny had been correct, of course. The spell had not turned him into a girl; instead, it appeared that every item of clothing Malfoy wore had been transfigured into something much more feminine.
Pansy decided to jump straight to the point — that was usually the best approach with Gryffindors.
The Fiendfyre was growing rapidly, but luckily they didn't have to look for long — Malfoy and Goyle were standing together atop a rapidly-disappearing pile. Ron and Hermione made their pass first and managed to grab Goyle, their broom dipping dangerously close to the flames as the broom adjusted to the excessive weight.
Why could he not get Malfoy out of his head? It was literally only a change of clothes, he berated himself, and some sparkly makeup, how had it suddenly made Malfoy so interesting?
As it turned out, Draco had some very strong feelings about people he didn’t know becoming his father all of a sudden.
He closed his eyes and took a deep breath and took those two steps.
"I must have dropped it!" Harry cried in horror. It was probably while he was distracted by Malfoy's hands in his jumper, he decided, not that he was going to tell Hermione that, but Hermione was smiling.
“My Lord!” Draco’s mother cut him off, and Draco was a bit surprised at her audacity. So was the Dark Lord, if the look he directed at her was anything to go by.
"That they're totally gay for each other?" Harry agreed, still not seeing where this was going. "Yeah, and they're together and happy now. What's your point, Ron?"
"Blaise," Ginny said, tipping her head towards the Slytherin table with a smile. Harry glanced over in time to see Zabini winking back at her.
Harry did not have time to think about whatever in Merlin's name was up with Malfoy after that, being a little preoccupied with getting everyone out of the Manor, but in the tumult as they made their escape, Malfoy appeared unexpectedly at his side and shoved something into his hand.
He watched the entrance to the Great Hall for the rest of dinner, not wanting to miss it if Malfoy decided to show, but it became clear that he wasn't when Parkinson rushed in about ten minutes later and whispered something to Zabini before making off with an armful of food. Harry slouched in disappointment, catching Ron and Hermione exchanging a glance as he did so, but he steadfastly ignored them.
"Thank you," she said absently, considering Draco's wardrobe.
, and made all sorts of friends, and had all sorts of adventures and seen all sorts of fantastic things that Draco had only ever read about in the books that his mother owl ordered for him.
"That's childish." Pansy waved it off. "And besides, I'm pretty sure both of them would be able to undo it in a heartbeat."
He had a Dark Lord to vanquish.
"Potter?" Draco exclaimed. "He's going to see me in
It was probably for the best, anyway, Draco thought as he went to bed later that night. It would have been fun to have a friend, but he had a feeling his mother wouldn’t have liked it one bit.
"It's not like it'll matter," Draco groaned, lifting his head to eye her narrowly. "What are you choosing an outfit for?"
Since they were eighth-years, McGonagall allowed them quite a few liberties, one of which was that they could go to Hogsmeade any time they wished, instead of only on select weekends. Pansy was sure she hadn't meant it to be used for this purpose, but loopholes were meant to be exploited.
Draco wanted to go see anything beyond his tower so badly that he’d actually obliquely mentioned it to his mother once. He hadn’t even said he wanted to leave, just that he thought the beach sounded nice, but she’d exploded anyway. It had turned into an hour-long rant about how she needed to know he was safe in his tower where nobody could hurt him and had ended with Draco sobbing and promising that he never wanted to leave her.
She left his dorm room to the sound of his promises of everlasting adoration, although he wasn't really getting out of anything by skipping dinner, just delaying the inevitable. Madam Pomfrey had already looked him over and said that it would wear off in a week, and that he wasn't excused from classes.
. He found that the idea of him being gay (or possibly bi, but he was undecided on girls) was much less intimidating than
came too late; before the wand left Crabbe's hand vicious, unnatural flames had already leapt out of it, and as his wand went arcing upwards it continued spewing them. It was definitely not normal fire, Harry thought, watching with horror as it grew abnormally quickly.
Ron appeared to be either coughing or trying not to laugh, and between the two of them, Harry felt like walls were closing in all around him.
"Ron, what is this?"
"Hermione
"Just, y'know, I know you took losing Dobby the hardest out of all of us, but it seemed like… like, I dunno, something's bothering you?"
"I dunno," he said noncommittally, unwilling to admit he hadn't heard the question because he'd been mooning over Malfoy.
"Potter?"
"Seemed kinda obvious to me," Ron continued, seemingly oblivious to Harry's temporary paralysis. "Like that ferret would ever
Harry found himself unable to speak, he was so shocked.
"How do you even know all that?" Seamus demanded, looking rather jealous.
"Who set off Fiendfyre, Harry?" Hermione panted as all three of them headed off together down another aisle. Harry wasn't sure it went back to the entrance, but it at least went away from the fire, which was still leaping up the mountains of objects as it pursued them, and formed disturbing shapes of snakes, dragons, and chimaeras as it devoured everything it touched.
“Next time though buddy, please make sure you wake me up, even if you want to be the one cooking. I really don’t want you to fall or burn yourself, okay?”
“I’ve just been spending more time with Teddy, that’s all.” He had started to go though the new case files that had appeared on his desk that morning before he had gotten in.
“What’s up Teddy?” He turned his attention to the child.
“It means that, despite the fact that you and the other two of the Golden Trio always seemed to save the school at the end of the year, you always had a habit of turning it upside down for at least half of the year.” Draco started laughing at this point. “I mean, do you even
“Of course, buddy.” And Harry snuggled the boy tightly and told him the story of The Wolf and The Morph, and within minutes, the boy was sound asleep in his arms.
Teddy groaned on the floor and grudgingly got up. He looked over at Draco and gave him sad eyes again, obviously looking for a way out.
He had just started on his second glass when his fire had suddenly turned green. Harry jumped and looked intensely at the fire, waiting for Ron or Hermione to come through. He was shocked when he heard a whispered voice coming through.
“These are amazing Teds. I had no idea you were such a good cook.” Harry said, mouth half-full of another bite of pancake, because they really were, amazing.
his father after all. Draco downed his glass and stomped off to bed. Angry about how going over to Potter’s house and sitting in silence and drinking his whiskey calmed his mind. Angry about all the children being affected with sickness. Angry that he hadn’t seen his son in weeks no matter how much he asked Astoria. He was just, angry.
“Uncle Draco!” Teddy yelled and ran directly towards Draco and jumped directly into his arms. He grabbed Draco’s face and squeezed it playfully and laughed maniacally.
“No, no we weren’t. And to think, it all started because a young boy got his feelings hurt by a person that he barely even knew.” Draco hung his head at his own words, all traces of the happiness that he had previously felt now faded from existence.
Harry laughed, “It was this very bright lime green. It reminded me of Fudge’s old bowler to be honest.” Harry leaned back in his chair remembering the morning, Teddy’s bright green hair flailing around on top of his head. “I guess you’re right Ron.” He smiled. “It didn’t seem to carry on to this morning.”
“That’s better.” He laughed at them. “So, you’re my cousin?” He looked at Draco, his questioning look back on his face. Draco nodded at him and he continued. “But, you’re old.” He scrunched up his face in confusion. Harry couldn’t hold his laughter in this time and Draco shot him a look, making him stop suddenly, but it was obvious he was just holding the laughter in this time. “You’re old like daddy.” Teddy said, breaking Draco’s glare from Harry, making him laugh this time, looking over and seeing the man across from him now being the one glaring at him. “I’mma call you Uncle Draco, is that okay?” Teddy asked, but before Draco could even open his mouth to respond, Teddy spoke again. “It’s okay.” He nodded smartly and then smiled, making Draco realize he wasn’t even asking Draco, he was just stating a fact.
Thank you to everyone who has kept up with the story so far. I have so many ideas going on for this story and with school and my small-business, I haven't had time to update. Hopefully there will be new chapters at least once a week, if not more. :)
“Morning Harry.” Draco said as he leaned against the counter, wiping food off of his hands. Harry looked him over and a pang hit his stomach again like it did the other night with Teddy. Harry shook the feeling from his mind and focused his attention back to Draco. “You alright Harry?” Draco looked Harry over, noticing the strange look on the man's face.
“No Teddy, he’s yours.”
“What’s going on Teddy?” Draco asked the boy as he played with the strands of hair that hung around Draco’s face.
“Yeah. But something else weird happened last night thought.” The words had blurted out of Harry’s mouth before he could stop himself. He didn’t realize he had needed to talk about it until he was in mid-conversation. Ron raised an eyebrow in curiosity at Harry and sat down in the chair opposite him. Harry just decided to go ahead and delve into last nights oddities with Malfoy showing up out of nowhere. Ron listened intently and didn’t interrupt like he normally would in a situation like this.
. What he was seeing in Harry as he watched his godson was a look of complete pride and love for the boy. He noticed as he was staring at Harry that he had never, in all their years of knowing each other, seen the man next to him with such happiness. This thought struck him to his core and the pang of sadness in his stomach overwhelmed him. He sat in this pain for only a moment when he felt a hand on his shoulder. He looked up and noticed Harry looking at him with concern across his face.
I'm apologize for how long it has taken me for getting another chapter up! Thank you to anyone who reads this fic, I've just been incredibly busy with the holidays and trying to take advantage of every spare minute to myself. Thanks for the patience!
The day was long, and Draco really didn’t notice the time flying by until Mr. Elowite had walked over to his cauldron and placed a hand on Draco’s shoulder. Draco flinched at the touch, forgetting where he was in the moment. Mr. Elowite removed his hand quickly and gave an apologetic look. Draco adjusted his face as best as he could to show that it was nothing Elowite did but brushed the situation off. “That time already?” He asked quietly, this was always the worst part of the day, going home. Elowite nodded and Draco packed up his things and headed home.
“Professor McGonagall?” Draco stopped directly in the center of the room, unable to understand what was going on.
Draco thought to himself,
that covered his forearms completely. He stared at the man’s arms as he followed them as they moved up to his hair. Harry had pulled out his wand from the bun that kept it in place and Draco was mesmerized as it cascaded down to his shoulders.
Ron looked down at Draco’s hand, which he instantly thought he would swat away, or yell at him to get out of his family home, but then the unexpected happened. Ron pulled him in for a hug. A hug. Something that almost made Draco scream in surprise but when he looked down at Teddy, he saw the light in the boy’s eyes brighten so much as more people he cared about meeting and getting together that he couldn’t help but smile even more and return the hug.
“Do you call Uncle Ron and Aunt ‘Mione by their last names like you used to with Daddy ‘cause of school too?”
“Will you help us make a cake Uncle Draco?” Teddy had jumped back in Draco’s lap now.
Draco shook his head and brought his thoughts back into focus. “Yeah, just wandered off again is all.” He tried to give Harry another small smile and turned to Teddy. “Alright Teddy, what do you need me to do?” Teddy smiled as he turned to Draco and handed him a large bowl with many utensils and ingredients inside it. Draco looked down at it curiously and then back up to Teddy.
“Then I’d believe you.”
“I DO!” Draco was screaming now, and he didn’t think he could control his anger anymore. “You’re the fucking prat that turned down a handshake of an eleven-year-old boy who just wanted to be friends. The arsehole that decided that making a classmate’s life a living fucking hell for 6 years was a good fucking idea. You let Granger PUNCH ME IN THE FACE! YOU TRIED TO FUCKING
“Teddy,” Harry said softly, “What did you do to Moony?”
“You’re serious?” Draco piped up finally.
“It’s fine. I’ll go.”
the prat?” Draco could feel his anger rising with each syllable he spoke, he didn’t know where it came from, or why it happened, but he couldn’t stop it now. “Says the savior of the fucking wizarding world, if only they knew who Harry fucking Potter really was, maybe they wouldn’t fawn over you as if you were a damn god.”
“Excuse me?” Harry spoke as they came up to the hat, “Erm, Sorting Hat?” He spoke a little louder, and the hat still sat, silently sleeping on it’s shelf. Harry eventually resulted in poking the hat to wake it up, much to it’s discomfort.
Harry walked over to the sitting room and stared back at the blonde man looking back at him, he wasn’t sure what was happening, but he nodded anyway. Malfoy walked through the fire and into the sitting room. He looked around and then his eyes landed on Harry, cold and grey as Harry had always remembered them being, but there was something different about them, they looked, pained.
Please feel free to leave any comments! I'm still working on this writing thing and would love any words good or bad.
Harry looked down at his godson and smiled, “So I’m guessing you wanted to make me breakfast again but you didn’t want to wake me up?” Teddy glanced up at Harry with big sky blue eyes and nodded. “And since last time I told you that you weren’t allowed to cook by yourself you reached out to Draco?” The boy nodded again. “But how did you know how to reach him?” Harry picked up Teddy and held him in his arms as the boy’s hair slowly started to change back to it’s previous color, which was his common blue-green.
“Your favorite memory from school, what is it?”
Hearing his name coming from Potter sounded odd but, in a way, that Draco could get used to, so he shrugged and accepted defeat. “If you say so
“Yeah, sorry about just being in your kitchen when you woke up, but I got an invitation to come over and make breakfast and I just couldn’t say no.” Draco laughed and looked down at Teddy, who was now burying his head in Harry’s leg, hair suddenly turning a pink-ish red, almost blush like.
and was walking around in just his socks. He felt completely overdressed at this moment and hated the fact that he made such a fuss over his appearance.
“You know, I’m not really sure either.” Harry said after a moment of silence. Malfoy looked up at him when he said this. “McGonagall said that it’s because I would help out anyone who seemed as if they needed it, even if they didn’t say that they did.” He smiled at this, knowing it was true.
“Thank you.” Teddy whispered into his shoulder.
At that, Teddy turned around and glared at the two men in front of him. “Are you two gonna help? I feel like I’m doing everything.” He huffed and turned back around, making sure he had everything. Draco and Harry looked at each other from what the child said to them and they both broke out in laughter.
“Aunt Minnie?” Teddy piped up as soon as Draco and Harry reached them. McGonagall turned to look at the boy, who was now sitting next to her in a transfigured desk small enough for Teddy. “Can we have lunch with you today?”
Draco had no idea what he had gotten himself into when he agreed to make a cake with Harry and Teddy. He half expected to stand on the side as Harry and Teddy did all the work. He had no idea how to make a cake. And to be honest, he had no idea how to make
“Malfoy?”
Draco sighed and stepped out of the floo, cleaning himself off as he did so. He followed Harry into the same direction Teddy had ran towards the kitchen and almost stopped in his tracks to take in the chaos that was Mrs. Weasley’s kitchen. It was a chaos that Draco had never seen, but something about it made Draco feel as if he was… home. A smile formed across Draco’s face before he even knew what was happening. He looked around the room and was amazed at everything around him. There were dishes washing themselves in the sink, knitting in the corner, food placing itself on the table, where there were 15 seats around it. Draco knew that the Weasley’s had a large family, but had never fully seen the whole family together at once, and he knew that this was either going to go horribly, or very well, thanks to Harry and Teddy.
“Don’t be.” Harry’s eyes met Draco’s again and a small smile played on his face, but not one of happiness, or giddiness, but one of comfort and assurance. One that Draco had only seen a rare few times, towards those that Harry had cared about, and always from a distance. But never towards him.
Draco looked up at Potter for help but all he got was a shrug from the man across the table and he sighed as he looked back at the very curious Teddy next to him. “Well, your father and I weren’t very good friends back in school, so we didn’t call each other by our first names.” Draco said, hoping this would appease the child.
“Well, I invited him to come back over this weekend.” He ruffled Teddy’s hair and slid out of bed, making Teddy’s head bounce off of the mattress.
“Fuck it.” He sighed. He walked over to the fireplace and read the address on the card again and once again was staring at the face of Harry Potter.
When Draco and Teddy finished cooking, they all sat around the table and ate everything, leaving nothing left over. Harry looked over at the clock on the wall when he had finished putting away the dishes as Draco was playing with Teddy, and noticed that it was already 9 O’clock.
“Nothing’s wrong mother, it’s just taking longer than expected.” He smiled a small smile at his mother to try and calm her some. He noticed a sigh from her and saw that the tenseness she held and subdued a great deal. “Thank you for coming.” He whispered as he took one of her hands from the other and leaned his head against her shoulder.
“Did you want to know what some of them are?” Harry smiled sheepishly.
“Teddy? Draco? What are you -?” His eyes caught the sight of their hands, both covered in flour, and his smiling face suddenly turned to shock. “NO! Teddy, whatever he’s convinced you to do, do NOT do it!” Harry started backing away slowly, but ended up against the wall with nowhere to run. Teddy turned to look at Draco, who replied with a smile that Teddy reciprocated. He turned back to Harry and grinned wide. The next thing Harry knew, he was covered in flour from head to toe, and Draco and Teddy were high fiving, laughing wildly.
“Morning?” Harry said tentatively.
Harry spun around and looked at her, noticing her expression and feared the worst. His stomach dropped. He couldn’t lose Teddy too; he was all that he had left outside of his friends. “Is he okay?” He said hesitantly, fearing the worst.
Being an Auror wasn’t as dangerous at it was when he first joined. The first couple of years consisted of finding any former Death Eaters that had escaped arrest and trial right after the war. The thought of the consistent field work with Ron, hunting down some of the most dangerous and lethal, made Harry smile as he walked down the sidewalk on the busy London streets. But now, now it was just picking up random one-offs. Someone broke into a store, someone was smuggling illegal potions from outside of the country, a duel had gone off in front of Muggles between two irritable Wizards who had gotten drunk and couldn’t agree on the next location. It had all gotten so bland and predictable for Harry that it didn’t have the draw to it like it used to.
These thoughts ran through Draco’s head repeatedly until the cigarette had burned the edge of his fingers.
“Astoria’s resting, it seems to be taking longer than –,” Draco was caught off by a healer walking into the room, silently nodding to him. “I’ll be back.” He kissed both the women on the cheeks and hurried back to his wife.
“I see…”
“Draco!” They heard a voice yell down the hall. They both raised their heads at the voice and saw Pansy rushing into the room. She looked out of breath as though she had been running, yet her presence would say different. She still looked the epitome of calm and pristine. She walked over to him in a hurry and pulled him into a large hug. “What’s going on?”
“That settles that then.” Draco smiled. “Now, Teddy, if I’m not mistaken, we still have some eggs to make, that is, if your dad doesn’t mind us continuing to cook.” Draco looked up at Harry, who was still holding Teddy. Harry nodded and put Teddy down so they could finish cooking.
He stuffed his hand in his pocket and it brushed against the card that Potter had given him. He pulled the card out of his pocket and turned it over again between his fingers.
Thank you to everyone who has left kudos! I really appreciate it. If anyone would like to leave a comment, good or bad, either way I appreciate it.
“Of course.” Harry nodded, and turned and left in the floo. When he arrived at home, he went to the kitchen and made a cup of tea. He heard the flames of the fireplace roar and looked over to notice that they were emerald green. He wondered if Hermione or Ron had decided to stop by to visit, or maybe Neville or Luna. He peered over the kitchen counter to look at the fireplace and to disbelief, he saw Malfoy looking out from it.
He jumped up out of the chair, rushed to the window and let the owl inside. He pulled the rolled-up parchment from its leg and watched it turn and fly away. He opened the parchment and his heart sank at the words.
“Daddy?” Teddy piped up, standing right at Harry’s feet now. “Can we go home now? I’m hungry.”
Harry shook his head, smiling slightly at Hermione and her need to constantly mother him. He dove back into his work and before he knew it, it was time to leave. He packed up his cases into his filing cabinet and headed out to meet Ron at the Cauldron.
Sorry that it has taken me literal months to update the story. Between work and my laptop taking a crap on me, I've had this chapter written for months. I finally got a new computer and am finally able to update the story on a regular basis. Thanks for all the kudos and love!
Teddy stared at the toy with wide eyes and said with an excited tone, “I’m a kid!”
for you?”
“Good Morning Ted.” Harry yawned, trying to stretch around the bouncing child.
Harry had finally looked at his surroundings after walking for what seemed like an hour when he saw a little hole in the wall Muggle pub across the street. It looked warm and inviting and the thought of being able to have a drink or two without being stared at sounded like heaven at just that moment. He walked across the street and entered the pub, no one looked up, no one jumped at the sight of him, no one bombarded him, and he smiled.
Draco had entered the kitchen with Teddy pulling him and Harry following them both. When Teddy let go of him, he went to grab a small step ladder from next to the fridge. He placed it next to the counter and climbed up. Draco watched as Teddy started pulling bowls and spoons and measuring cups out of the cupboard. He felt movement next to him and turned to see Harry had moved to lean on the counter beside him. Draco looked up at his face and saw the look on Harry’s face as he watched Teddy pulling things onto the counter left and right. There was a look in his eyes that Draco couldn’t quite place. He had seen it before, but only once, when Granger had punched him in the face in their third year.
“’S alright.” Draco looked up at Harry, and he noticed something he doesn’t think he’s ever seen from Harry. He was crying.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry transferred his gaze to the now empty glass in Malfoy’s hand and then to his own empty glass on the coffee table in front of him. “Would you like another?” Harry said quickly, standing up and taking the glasses in his hands. Malfoy simply nodded and Harry went back into the kitchen to refill the glasses. He sat back down on the couch and handed Malfoy’s glass back to him. He took another large gulp to Harry’s surprise. They sat in silence for what seemed like eternity when Malfoy finally stood up. Harry’s gaze followed him as he moved towards the fireplace.
Harry had sat down next to Teddy and looked over at the toy. He looked up at Malfoy in amazement of the toy when he noticed it was a stuffed wolf that was charmed to change colors every couple of seconds. “Daddy…” Teddy whispered. Harry looked down at the boy, who hadn’t taken his eyes off the stuffed wolf, “It’s just like me.”
“Potter, out of all of your former classmates, which of them do you think would have had the worst of it after the war? Mr. Malfoy. Which of them do you think would come for help but not actually ask for it? Mr. Malfoy. And lastly, out of all your former classmates, who do you think would be hesitant to ask for your help and stay away from the public eye?”
“Well then, come over on Saturday, around 10, and you’ll get your proof.”
” Draco put his hand to his chest in feign disbelief of Harry’s words.
“I really should be going Potter.” Malfoy said to him across the room, standing from the armchair.
He looked at the man next to him apprehensively, “You could say that.” Harry said slowly, waiting for the worst.
“That’s not fair Teddy, you know that I can’t say no to you when you give me your sad eyes.” Draco sighed and ran his hand through Teddy’s hair. “I guess I can’t be rude and turn down her invitation. But you promise me Harry that there is no ulterior motive towards me coming with you?”
“I’m not.”
And did Potter just open up somewhat to him as well? He had rambled on a bit about the fact that he had never really told anyone how he had felt, and that no one had ever listened to him. But didn’t he have the weasel and the mudblood for that? Surely, they would listen to whatever the leader of their beloved Golden Trio had to say and of course they would have compassion for him and make sure he felt better about himself more than he probably already did. Savior of the wizarding world and all that shit.
Harry laughed and got up from the couch and picked up Teddy, “It’s ready now if you would like to eat?” Teddy nodded hastily and looked down at the wolf then back up at Harry with questioning eyes, “Yes you can bring the wolf to dinner as long as you don’t get food on it.” Teddy smiled and then looked over at Malfoy and then back to Harry with the same questioning look. “Would you like Malfoy to stay for dinner?” Teddy nodded again. “Well, if he would like to stay for dinner, then he is more than welcome to.” Harry looked over at Malfoy who simply nodded and raised from the armchair.
“Uncle Draco?” Teddy piped up from Granger’s lap.
Harry changed Teddy and tucked him bed, as he was walking out if the room, he looked back at him one more time, as he usually does to see what color his hair would take as he slept, and noticed that the bubblegum pink was still there, shining brightly against the dark of the room. Harry smiled to himself and closed the door. He walked down to sitting room, poured himself a glass of Scotch and relaxed into the couch by the fire.
“Ignoring that ridiculous statement aside, I’m talking about McGonagall.” She stopped and looked at Harry intently.
“I would be honored Teddy.” Draco smiled and happily took the book. They both got comfortable in the armchair that Draco got so used to residing in while at the Potter home and he began the story.
“This is amazing Teddy.” He smiled at the boy.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Mr. Malfoy, I presume?” McGonagall said calmly, looking at Harry over her square framed glasses.
Harry laughed and nodded, letting Draco know he didn’t need to finish his question. He unbuttoned his sleeves and rolled them up on his arms, exposing a myriad of colors, all belonging to different pictures gracefully displayed along Harry’s forearms. Draco’s eyes wired as he looked closer to the tattoo’s, spotting a few that he could understand. Harry turned and twisted his arm so Draco could see all of the sides of his arms, and Draco watched as the muscles flexed and curved as Harry moved.
“Was walking by, thought it looked nice and warm, figured I’d stop in for a drink on my way home.” Harry smiled slightly, letting his worry fade as he continued to talk to the gentleman. They had talked for what seemed like half an hour when he felt someone sit down next to him. Noticing that the person was just there to get a drink as well, Harry continued with his conversation with Eric and didn’t think twice about Lucky’s newest patron.
“Ron just told me what happened. Are you okay?” She said in a hurried voice.
“Well, nice ter meet ya Harry. Ain’t never seen you in Lucky’s b’fore.” Harry sighed realizing that the man had no clue who he was and was just being kind to a random person at his local pub.
“Well, if you don’t mind me calling you Draco as well,” Weasley said, straightening himself on the couch, shoving another pie in his mouth, “I don’t mind if you call me Ron.”
The next hour was as anxiety riddled and stressful as Draco could have imagined it. His mother had arrived shortly after an owl was sent to her from the hospital. Draco and Astoria made sure to have the list of authorized visitors and family members at the hospital well in advance just for this moment. They were of course to be prepared for anything. Nothing was to take them by surprise. They had Astoria’s hospital bag packed for weeks prior to today, Draco had secured the top labor and resting suite at the hospital months ago, but still, nothing had prepared them for today.
When Draco entered the sitting room, he looked up and noticed that no one was in there. He was worried that he had come by at a bad time or that Potter wasn’t even home, or worse, he wasn’t actually invited and had made the whole thing up in his head. He went to turn and leave when he heard a clatter from the room off to the right of him. He looked up and noticed Potter in the kitchen, he seemed deep in thought as he was cooking something and Draco didn’t want to disturb him, he would just come back another time. He went to turn back to the fireplace again when he heard Potter speaking from the kitchen.
“Uncle Draco, you look so silly.” His little laugh got louder as he spoke, gasping for air.
Draco shrugged it off and just assumed it was Potter’s tactic to making someone feel comfortable with how they are feeling in that moment so that they don’t feel embarrassed to talk to him about things. He ignored his thoughts and finally ordered some takeaway and sat in his armchair, finally able to relax for once in his life. His thoughts were drifting to some of his fonder memories of his life when he was disturbed by the sound of scratching at his window. He looked up and saw a familiar barn owl perched just outside,
“You made it.” Harry said with a smile, but the tone in his voice hinted surprise, seeing as he partially didn’t expect Malfoy to show up.
“Neither have you.” Potters words still had a hint of irritation in them but had calmed.
“Hey Teddy?” Harry said, watching Draco look over the recipe. “What kind of care are we making bud?”
Harry turned to Draco with a triumphant smile on his face, “See! I told you I was supposed to be in Slytherin originally!”
“Do I look silly Teddy?” Draco was smiling brightly now. Teddy could only nod at this point, for words were unable to form through his fit of laughter. “Well if that’s the case, then I surely can’t be the only one to look silly.” His grin stretched as he saw Teddy’s eyes widen slowly as the words processed through his mind. Teddy went to speak and raise his hands to his face but was a second too late. Draco had taken a handful of flour and tossed it at the boy, who now mirrored him with the mess. Teddy just stared at Draco, surprise crossing his face, and then a smile. The kitchen was silent as the two looked at the mess that had been created. The silence was finally broken when Harry broke out in laughter again.
“YOU USED A SPELL ON ME THAT YOU DIDN’T EVEN KNOW? ARE YOU DAFT POTTER? HOW FUCKING STUPID WERE YOU?” Draco was fuming at this point. He looked at Harry closely and noticed the hurt on his face from this one moment. He stared at him for a moment and finally took a deep breath and tried to calm himself.
“Oi mate, you never showed up at the Cauldron last night.” Ron had popped into Harry’s office within minutes of him arriving at work.
“You did say 6, right?” Draco said questioningly, noticing the surprise in Potter’s voice.
“I watched you when we went to Grandma’s house with the cup of dirt at the fireplace and so I grabbed some of that, threw it in the fireplace like you do, and then I just said Uncle Draco’s name out loud and his face just showed up in the fire! It was awesome.” Teddy giggled at the action and turned to look at Draco.
He sighed audibly and straightened up, turning to look at Potter. Suddenly Draco noticed that Potter had changed in the 8 years it had been since they last saw each other. Any time Draco’s thoughts had brought up Potter in a moment of depression, or anger, hell, even sadness, this wasn’t the man that came to mind. The Potter he remembered was a skinny young boy, with short, messy, almost black hair. Thin gold circular frames that somehow always seemed to end up broken, that hung low on his nose as if they didn’t fit his face properly. And then, there was that unmistakable scar, just above his right eye on his forehead.
“Uncle Ron gave it to me for Christmas last year and it’s one of my favorite toys ever. Daddy says I have to keep it here that way I can play with it when Aunt Molly watches me or when we come over for dinners.” He was moving little trees around it, setting up a scene around it to make it look like it was traveling through the forest. “It’s in like, my top 5 toys of all time. Just like the Moony you gave me.” Teddy turned and looked up at Draco and smiled so bright he thought the boy's smile was going to break his heart.
“You okay Draco?” Harry asked kindly.
The kitchen was quiet again and somewhat peaceful when Draco suddenly felt something crack against his head and then followed by a cold, wet sensation running down his neck. His eyes widened in surprise when he saw an egg land on top of Teddy’s head soon after. They both looked up and noticed Harry had the carton of eggs in his hands, a playful smile formed across his face. Draco looked at Teddy and the boy simply nodded. They grabbed the nearest ingredient and automatically threw it at Harry, who was now covered in the cocoa that they must have grabbed. The three of them stood in the kitchen looking at each other, not saying a word. Suddenly, Teddy yelled what seemed like a war cry and the kitchen erupted into a battlefield of cake ingredients. Food was being thrown from multiple directions and covering all three of them and most of the kitchen.
“Yes, he’s a lot smarter than I ever was at that age.” Harry responded with a smile as well and laughed lightly, turning to look back to where Teddy had just stood.
“Well I’m here.” Draco huffed. “But I can leave if you’d like Potter.” He started to turn when he heard a small voice from down the hall.
and heading to greet him in the sitting room. Draco noticed that the man was wearing a simple long sleeve t-shirt and jeans,
“Where did you get this?”
“Teddy, we need to go and get ready, come.” Harry held out his hand at the base of the stairs and looked at Draco, “We shouldn’t be more than 20 minutes, is that alright?”
“I meant to ask, you seemed as if you knew the story quite well.” Harry questioned, raising an eyebrow. “How is that?”
Harry watched as Draco read to Teddy. He noticed something shift in Draco’s eyes during the conversation with Teddy. Harry observed the scene in front of him and watched as Draco made all of the noises that the characters would have made, all of the sounds that went along with the story. Harry was greatly impressed with Draco’s ability to keep Teddy entertained through the story. While in his thoughts, Teddy must have fallen asleep and neither Harry, nor Draco had noticed. Draco looked up from the book and noticed there was a small smile on Harry’s face as he looked at them. Draco looked down and noticed that Teddy had fallen asleep during the story. He looked back up at Harry, wondering what to do. Harry noticed this and got up from the couch to grab Teddy from Draco’s lap. He carefully pulled Teddy up and carried him to his bedroom. Once Teddy was all tucked in, Moony close to his side, Harry headed back into the sitting room where he was surprised to see Draco still sitting in the armchair.
“Well?” Draco sneered, but Harry detected a slight change in his tone though, it didn’t seem as arrogant and distasteful as usual. Harry thought Malfoy seemed, put off in a sense.
“Well,” Hermione blushed at the words. “I appreciate that Harry, but I wasn’t talking about me, because, yes, I may be smart, but I’m not the
After a couple of drinks, Harry headed to go pick up Teddy and deal with Andromeda’s incessant badgering. He went through his usual nighttime routine with Teddy, minus the story this time, and finally sat down on the couch in the sitting room. At 10 O’clock on the dot again, his fireplace roared a bright emerald green again and Malfoy’s face was looking back at him again.
“Finally, I’m starving.” Ron said, stretching, picking up the plate of pies and helping Hermione off of the couch.
Draco looked up at him and shrugged. “Figured I’d get a glass or two of whiskey from you before I did.” He smiled at Harry, who nodded and made his way to the kitchen to grab their respective bottles and two tumblers. He set the bottles and tumblers down on the table in front of Draco, who leaned forward and poured himself a glass.
“I think that sounds great Teddy.” Draco smiled down at Teddy who hugged his stuffed wolf tightly.
“Well, yes but- “
Malfoy.” He took a step closer to Draco, feeling his blood rising. “Maybe if you weren’t such a fucking prat, maybe it would happen more often, and it wouldn’t be so foreign to you.”
Harry looked back at him with confusion on his face, he honestly had no idea what he was getting at and honestly didn’t want to get into an all-out war in the middle of his sitting room. “I was just trying to talk Malfoy, don’t be so sensitive about the shit.” Harry realized he was now standing up as well, facing Draco with the same intensity.
“Draco, the baby’s coming!” Astoria shouted from the bedroom. Draco raced up the stairs to her as fast as he could, he held her hand, his mind racing as to what was supposed to happen next. Draco had never felt this feeling of uneasy before, and he wasn’t keen on it. Finally, he remembered he needed to take Astoria to St. Mungo’s. He called her bags to the room and held on to his wife tightly. They landed right in front of St. Mungo’s Hospital and quickly rushed to the front desk. The witch that sat behind the desk and looked up, her eyes opened wide at the sight in front of her. The witch hurried them to the labor ward and called a healer as soon as she could.
Draco sighed and grabbed the wolf. “Thank you, Teddy.” He pulled the wolf close to him to appease Teddy, but he noticed that something was different about the wolf when he held it close.
“Oh, Harry!” A voice called out from around the corner as Draco was still taking in the amazement that was just the kitchen alone. He turned his head towards the voice and an unmistakable head of red hair had just entered the room. He had started to back away as Mrs. Weasley had rushed into the kitchen but was stopped by a hand on his wrist, that he looked down to notice was Harry’s, which led up to the man turning to look at him with those same eyes, that same smile, that same… everything. He breathed again and planted himself where he stood, now feeling stronger and a bit more confident.
“Yes.” Harry said quickly, beaming as brightly as he could to Andromeda.
Malfoy seemed to be thinking this over, and then he looked up at Harry and finally said, “It was a time that I figured you would be in.” He looked over Harry’s face, which showed more curiosity before, “That first night, it was 10, so when I came by the second night at the same time, and you were home yet again, I figured that would be an appropriate time to come by. Knowing you were home and just sitting in here, and all.”
“True, you did marry and have a child with Ron, and honestly, how wise of a decision is that really?” He nudged her playfully as she swatted his arm.
“Completely.”
Draco stared at Potter for another moment before the silence was broken by Potter’s words. “You alright Malfoy?”
“And what? Ted loves him, he even brought him a stuffed wolf that changes colors because it reminded him of Teddy. Hell, Ted even convinced him to make a cake with us last night, well, try to make a cake, but it ended up in a food fight with a huge mess for me to clean up.” Harry laughed as he remembered the events that laid out the prior night.
“See ya’.”
The two men looked at each other, unsure of this revelation made by an eight-year-old. “I mean, I’m okay with it, if you are
“If that were the case Malfoy, I’m sure I would have gotten better marks than I did, but no, I did not.” Potter had his back turned to Draco, but he could still see the tenseness in his shoulders from the conversation. He finally turned around and faced Draco. “Besides, if I would have just copied off of Hermione, she would have killed me instantly.” He looked at his feet and laughed quietly. “And also,” His snapped up quickly, his eyes had changed to daggers at Draco. “It’s Ron, or Weasley. If you’re going to be in my home, you will be mindful of that. Got it?”
He thought,
“Well it’s simple my boy, he asked not to be put in Slytherin.” It said matter-of-factly.
“Anytime Draco.” He squeezed Draco’s shoulder gently and headed down the hall where they could both hear Teddy calling for him.
______________________________________________________________________________
“Yes?”
“I’m so sorry uncle Draco! I forget sometimes.” His little head hung and he held Moony close to him.
“Can I-” Draco hesitated a moment and Harry saw a faint pink flush on his cheeks.
“It’s nothing Harry, it just means that I get to spend a little extra time with this fireball here.” She laughed as Teddy turned his hair a vibrant flame red/orange at the sound of ‘fireball’.
“Well, McGonagall,” Harry laughed slightly as the words sounded odd when he said them out loud to her. “It’s just that, well, I’ve had an old classmate that’s been coming by my home nightly. But what’s odd about it, is that they come by at the same time every night, they don’t say a word, they have a couple of drinks, and then they leave. It’s happened every night for the past week and I’m not really sure what to make of it.”
The nightly routine of Malfoy coming into Harry’s sitting room had continued for the rest of the week and on Saturday morning, Harry sent an owl to his old professor, Minerva McGonagall, asking if he could come by the school and speak with her, that he needed to get her view on what was going on and in all honesty, he just wanted to see the school again, and her. He received her reply within the hour and she had told him that her door was always open for him and that if he had the time, to come by that same day, her floo would be open for the rest of the day if needed. Harry smiled at the parchment in his hand, sent an owl to Andromeda to let her know that he would be out of the house for the afternoon and if she needed to get in touch with him he would be at the school with McGonagall, and took off through the floo to Hogwarts.
“Erroll?” Harry questioned. He took the parchment from the bird and gave him a few treats before turning back to the sitting room to read it.
.” Draco laughed as he said this and noticed Harry’s eyebrow raise at his words.
“Professor? Why Potter, I thought with it being what, 8 years since you last attended Hogwarts that you would have called me something other than Professor.” She looked up from her parchment and noticed the look of confusion from Harry. She smiled and nodded and said, “If it makes you more comfortable, you can simply call me McGonagall, seeing as you calling me Minerva might make us both a little uncomfortable.” Harry noticeably relaxed and smiled at her. “Have a biscuit Potter.” She put a hand out to the small brass tin that sat on the corner of her desk and Harry obliged. “So, what have you come to talk about?”
“Mornin’ mate.” Ron said with a mouth half full of food, as usual.
“Malfoy, in case you’ve forgotten, I
“Okay, I’m going to go play with Moony now.” Teddy said, hopping off his chair.
“I’m sure you can figure it out Potter. You seem to have a knack for answering your own questions that seem to have no answer at all.” She smiled again and looked at him kindly over her glasses.
“How did you -?” Harry looked at her with complete surprise. He knew nothing ever got past McGonagall, but how could she have figured this out so quickly?
“Fine.” Draco hugged but didn’t argue. “Well, it seems a bit late, I might as well be going then. Work in the morning.” Draco stood, Harry standing beside him.
“I’m really sorry Andromeda. I had run into an old schoolmate of mine on the way home who was in a bad spot and- “
“Saturday at 10?”
“That was a good one. I actually think I know who started that one too.”
“Shocker.”
“Well then how am I supposed to help someone who wants help, but won’t ask for help, and doesn’t even know he needs or wants it?” Harry leaned back in his chair frustrated.
A cough from behind the both of them interrupted the conversation and they both turned to see a tall red-headed man standing behind them, a tray of pies in one hand, and a pie going into his mouth with the other.
When Draco returned, Harry and Teddy were in the sitting room, Teddy playing with his Moony, Harry reading a magazine. They both looked up when Draco entered the room and got up to leave.
“Well, yes.”
“What happened Teddy?” Harry was now down on the floor next to Teddy, hand on his shoulder gently, worry in his eyes.
Harry was laughing now with Draco and had to gasp for air as he remembered that night, it was so long ago but for some reason, he could recount the whole event as if it had happened yesterday. “Well, if you must know, Ron had hurt Hermione’s feelings earlier that day and she was in the lavatory crying according to one of our friends. So naturally, when we were all running back to our dormitories we had to turn back to go and get her because she had no clue what was going on.”
Teddy finally climbed down from Malfoy’s lap and turned to look at Harry. He hugged the wolf tightly and looked at Harry intently and said, “When’s dinner?”
“Well fine, I’ll just leave then.” Malfoy turned on the spot and headed back towards the fireplace.
He looked over at Teddy, who was making what he called ‘flour angels’. He laughed and shook his head and looked down at his clothes. He, like the other two, was covered head to toe in food, and he was surprised to realize that he didn’t mind. He looked back up at Harry and noticed that the man was looking at him as well. He felt that same feeling in his chest again and instantly looked away, feeling a flush in his cheeks.
then. I mean, of course the whole school knew about the Quirrell thing, but the troll thing we only heard rumors. I didn’t believe most of them, but still, there were some pretty crazy stories that had wondered around after Halloween.”
“That’s a good one.” Weasley smiled. “Nah, she kept Granger, it's what she’s been known as at the Ministry for years and we didn’t want to have to change it all up when we got married. Mum wasn’t all too comfortable with it when we told her but she respected it enough when Dad came in and told her that it would be easier for her career if she just kept her name.” He smiled at Granger and gave her a light kiss on the cheek, which made her blush the same shade as Mrs. Weasley earlier.
“I don’t believe it.” Harry shook his head as he said this.
Draco laughed and nodded. “Yes Teddy, but if you would like, and if they are okay with it, I can call them by their names just like me and Daddy do.” He looked up at Weasley and Granger, an eyebrow raised as they both just stared in amazement at the conversation between the man and the boy.
When Draco entered the waiting room, Narcissa looked up at him, her eyes going seemingly wider than Draco thought they could go. “Is anything –,” She tried to choke out.
“Wait, Weasley hurt Granger’s feelings? I didn’t even know he was capable of doing that to her. Aren’t they like, the perfect couple or something?” Draco was looking at Harry in disbelief.
Harry woke the next morning to Teddy jumping up and down on his bed.
Draco nodded and Harry smiled. He saw Harry’s hand flex beside him and suddenly a pair of pajama bottoms and a t-shirt appeared on the table in the sitting room next to them. Draco’s eyes widened at Harry’s use of wandless magic and Harry just shrugged.
“I’m sorry.” It was barely a whisper, but Harry was confident he heard it.
“Can’t tell you.”
McGonagall paused for a moment to take in Harry’s question for a moment, then she finally looked at him and said, “Why yes, I believe he is Potter. But the thing is, I don’t think he himself knows that he is asking for help. We both know how Mr. Malfoy is Potter and we both know he is not one to ask for help, no matter how bad things may get for him.”
Draco finally goes to the Weasley home for the first time.
“Do you?” She raised an eyebrow at him at the question.
Malfoy shrugged and made his way into the dining room as Harry made lunch. He handed a plate to Malfoy and they ate in silence before Malfoy thanked him and headed towards the fireplace. He stopped suddenly before he reached the fireplace and turned to face Harry. “Do you mind if I come by tomorrow?” The look on his face was somewhat hopeful as he said it.
“I’m so sorry Draco! Ronald! You know better than to just hug people out of nowhere!” Draco’s head snapped to the sound of the new voice in the room and saw Hermione Granger standing in the doorway, a stern look on her face that he knew so well from all of those years in school, but instead of it being towards him, it was towards Weasley.
I am that stupid and ignorant that I tried to save him.” Harry scoffed and sat back on the couch, looking over at Draco, the rage still in his eyes, but, Draco noticed, that were at himself, not at Draco.
Harry nodded at this and looked at Malfoy once more. “Well, now that this has been settled,” He stood at this, Malfoy’s eyes following him as he did, “Hungry? I’m starving.” And he proceeded to the kitchen.
So I have severely slacked off in updating this story. I've had so many ideas on how to continue with this story that it's been a bit overwhelming. I'm so grateful for everyone that has commented, given kudos, and bookmarked this story to keep reading it and those that have been reading since the beginning and have stayed with the story. I'm going to try to keep up with the story in a more timely manner in the future. I hope you enjoy!
They all laughed as Ron just shrugged, putting another pie into his mouth, heading towards the kitchen, where they joined the rest of the Weasley family, which Draco couldn’t figure out how all of them were in the home and he was just now seeing them since he had gotten there.
We’ve heard that you have Teddy this weekend and wanted to invite you over for dinner tonight if you don’t have any prior arrangements.
to him? Draco couldn’t make any sense of it but at this moment, he wasn’t going to dwell on the thought of it. All he knew was that after that quiet time in the sitting room, he felt… better for some reason that he just couldn’t place. His head wasn’t swimming with all the horrible things that had happened to him lately, or how miserable he was with his life. He just knew that he felt somewhat better after it and wondered if he would go back. Potter did say that the invitation was open, so maybe he would go back, he didn’t really know. Draco finally stood up and slumped off to bed, alone, as usual.
“We tried to keep out of the public eye and from anyone who might not be best influence for ‘Pius.” Draco sat back a moment and took another drink. “I haven’t seen him in weeks, and his mother is taking him on holiday for another two.” Draco hung his head and took another drink before he spoke again. “I know she’s not doing any of this to hurt me, she just thinks that it’s best, is all.” He brought a finger to the bridge of his nose and sighed once more.
“You try to save everyone Harry. It’s just who you are. I just wish you hadn’t saved me. But then again, I’m getting what I deserve now instead.” Draco noticed Harry’s expression change and he couldn’t hold back. “I mean, after the war of course I got shit. Even after the trial where you stood for Mother and I. But I expected that. I thought that would be the last of it and eventually people would get over it or realize that some people don’t remain the same person. And most people did, my boss forgets most days what I’ve done or who I was associated with and it makes me happy.” A small smile tugged at Draco’s mouth for a second but faded as he continued. “But now, it’s not people remembering who or what I was, it’s life that’s deciding that I don’t deserve a second chance. My father passed, but I honestly don’t fucking care about that prat, but it’s been hard on mother. She seems as if she’s withering away most days and it breaks my fucking heart and I can’t take it most days when she lets me see her. My
Draco grimaced once he heard his name. He didn’t want to turn to look at the man standing just to his right, he didn’t want to see the smug face of “The Chosen One”. He just wanted to run, run as far as his feet could take him. But he knew that with Potter already standing there next to him, looking at the state that he was currently in, probably judging him with every drag of the cigarette he held between his fingers, that the option to run was not really an option at all.
“What?” Harry couldn’t understand what was going on in his best friend's heads, but he sensed it wasn’t good.
Harry’s face twisted in pain at Draco’s words. “Actually, I can Malfoy.” He sat down with defeat at this point. “He actually killed my parents, remember?” He looked down at his feet, his hands twisting each other in his lap.
Teddy turned to face Harry and then looked back at Draco, squinting his eyes at the man. Draco felt uncomfortable at this but held his composure.
“Good morning Sorting Hat. I was just wondering if you remember my sorting all those years ago?” Harry said happily, a giddy grin on his face.
“What are you getting on about?” Harry shook his head in disbelief. They had started this, and Harry saw no end to it. “What do you mean by, if they knew who I really was? You act as if
“Draco Fucking Malfoy”
“Right.” Ron nodded, finally remembering what Harry had told him yesterday. “How is the little guy? Feel like I haven’t seen him in ages.”
“What are we doing here Harry?”
Harry sighed as he rolled out of bed, the small boy bouncing behind him. He made his way to the kitchen, placed Teddy on the counter and began to make pancakes. He was absent mindedly thinking to himself as he piled the plate high, Teddy laughing wildly with every pancake that Harry added, when the thought of Malfoy in his sitting room came back to him. He still couldn’t figure out what any of it meant or why Malfoy even came by his house. He was still trying to figure out why any of that happened when Teddy had pulled him out of his thoughts. He had looked up and saw Teddy with a mouthful of pancake and a fistful of another one.
“Well this is me reaching out.” Malfoy glared at Harry, crossing his arms defiantly.
Draco threw a hand to his chest in an act of surprise. “Me, dress like a bum, you offend me Potter.” A small smile twitched at the sides of his mouth. “But fine, I’ll make sure to dress appropriately. Where are we going anyway?”
Potter, Draco thought, and drifted off to sleep.
Draco shook his head, thinking. Potter just nodded when the look of surprise faded, went and grabbed the whiskey and just left the bottle for Draco. Again, he didn’t ask questions, he didn’t sit and stare at Draco this time, he just let the room sit in silence. As if he
“Yes! I didn’t know if that was happening to you too, but I hoped it would. I didn’t want you to be sad anymore Uncle Draco, so I thought Moony could help you like he helped me when I got sad about Mom and Dad.”
Harry and Draco moved over to where Teddy was standing and looked over all the objects on the counter. Draco looked over at Harry and watched him as he pulled his sleeves up to his elbows. As Harry did this, Draco noticed something on Harry’s arms. He took a closer look and noticed that Harry had
The person next to Harry had been waiting for a few minutes without the bartender, whose name Harry learned was Bert, serving them. Harry made eye contact with Bert and nodded behind him. Bert looked around Harry and saw them sitting there without a drink. Bert walked over and Harry had turned, about to ask for another round for himself and Eric, when the person next to him had jumped out of their seat and took off out of the bar. Bert was calling after them and Harry turned around to get a look at the person.
Harry nodded and made his way over to the kitchen and poured a glass of whiskey, he looked at the glass and then over to Malfoy and then poured a little more. He walked back into the sitting room and held the glass out to Malfoy. Malfoy glanced up, took the glass from Harry and drank half of it in one gulp. Harry sat back on the couch and looked at Malfoy once more. He noticed that the platinum blonde hair that was always so neat and tidy now looked disheveled, and it had grown out significantly that reflected what harry remembered of Lucius Malfoy. His eyes had dark circles underneath them as if he hadn’t slept in days, maybe weeks. His sharp features looked gaunter than Harry believed were possible for a Malfoy and his whole demeanor just seemed… sad.
“Yeah, yeah he’s fine. It’s just…” Harry sighed and ran his hands through his hair. “He fell asleep last night with pink hair. Tonk’s pink hair.” He looked down at his feet and felt a pang of sadness towards his godson.
“What was that?” Draco sat up and felt the flush in his cheeks.
“He hasn’t been told much, just that your mum and his grandmother are sisters. He’s seen some of your pictures from your school days. Apparently, your mum had sent a few photos to ‘Meda a few years back when she was trying to make amends and wanted Teddy to know more of who his family were.”
“Well at least you’re not dead.” Andromeda said sternly. Looking Harry up and down, checking to see if he was at least injured, because that was the only acceptable reason for being so late to pick up Teddy.
“Okay!” Teddy took one last jump and bounced off the bed. He took off out of the room and down the hall to his own, Harry following behind him.
“Daddy!” Yelled a small voice in his ear. Harry pulled back the blue mess from his face and was looking directly at the vivid, now purple, eyes of his godson Teddy.
“I’m fine, just surprised.” Harry walked into the kitchen, Teddy still clinging to his legs.
Harry woke the next morning to Teddy jumping on his bed, his hair now a vibrant lime green, begging for pancakes. “Please daddy,” The small boy begged. “can we please have pancake’s this morning?”
“Well, if it keeps happening maybe you should try and talk to him about it.”
Harry couldn’t make any sense of what was going on in his life. Malfoy had been in his sitting room two nights in a row now. Malfoy never says anything, never looks at Harry besides the initial look through the floo to make sure he can enter, and he leaves without a word. What was his world coming to? Malfoy, of all people was just waltzing into his home, drinking his alcohol, and walking out. But Harry had noticed something had changed with Malfoy the second night of him stopping over. Malfoy seemed to have more stress written on his face, but he didn’t seem to look as in pain as he had the night before. Harry still didn’t understand what was going on but maybe, just maybe, it would either stop and he could just forget about it, or it would continue, and he could eventually ask Malfoy what was going on. That is, if Malfoy even knew what was going on himself.
“Actually,” Harry’s smile got bigger, and Draco could see a twist of something forming behind his eyes. “No.” And Harry suddenly burst out laughing.
Draco took his face in and instantly noticed that it was Weasley, Ron Weasley standing in front of him. But this Ron Weasley wasn’t the same that he knew in school. He was strong looking, more freckles than Draco remembered, and he looked a lot more confident than the boy all those years ago, making Draco remember that it was more than just him and Harry that had changed from the war.
“I’m completely serious Draco.” Harry grinned, but there was something about his grin, something in his eyes that told Draco he just needed to trust him. So Draco simply nodded and walked over towards him.
He tried to shake the memory from his mind and then his thought trickled to the day Father died. It was hard on Mother, she didn’t leave her room for days after they had received word via owl that he had died while in prison, but that didn’t mean that it still didn’t hurt her. Draco was sad, yes, but in the back of his mind he was happy the world was rid of the man. He was always so callous, and his words were always filled with venom when he spoke to anyone but Mother. But that day, that dreadful day, it broke his heart to see Mother so distraught. He was always a look of composure, pristine and proper, but that day, that week really, she was nothing more than a shell of the woman that Draco had remembered looking up at every day with admiration. A woman who loved her son with such heart that she had lied to the Dark Lord to make sure he was alive.
“If you’re sure.” Draco shrugged walked towards the dining room. Potter walked over and set a plate full of food in front of him. He looked down in amazement at the pile of eggs, toast, bacon, potatoes and a glass of orange juice in front of him. He looked up at Potter to tell him thank you and noticed the man hadn’t even waited for him to say anything and saw him digging into his own plate. Draco watched him for a moment and noticed that he was a very uncivilized eater, shoveling food into his mouth as if it were his last meal, or only meal. He scrunched up his face at this when Potter looked up from his food finally.
Harry was about to say something to let her know he was there when he heard her say, without lifting her head from her parchment, “Well, come sit down Potter.” Harry smiled and remembered it was McGonagall, there wasn’t a thing she missed. He walked across the room and sat down in one of the chairs opposite her.
Harry laughed louder at this and leaned back on the couch. “I feel bad for McGonagall.” He shook his head at the realization. “I mean, she’s going to be in so much trouble with him, he’s as smart as his father was and just as much of a rebel as his mother was.”
“The offer still open or is it a one-time thing?” Malfoy said, glancing over his shoulder at Harry. Harry just nodded and Malfoy walked into the fire as it roared a bright emerald green and was gone.
Draco and Harry sat in silence for almost an hour before Harry finally got tired of the quiet and spoke up.
Harry thought. He jumped out of bed and ran downstairs, worried about Teddy cooking on his own again. He stopped abruptly when he got to the kitchen and saw, not only Teddy in the kitchen, but a long plait of almost white blonde hair next to him, turning and tending to the bacon on the stove, as Ted was whisking eggs in a bowl.
“But what about -?”
“Okay Daddy. I promise.”
Harry hung his head and laughed under his breath and turned to Draco, who obviously looked confused. “We eat cake when we’re sad in this house.”
“I was just making a cup of coffee in my kitchen when I heard my floo go off, and when I checked it, there he was, smiling like he is now. He told me he needed help making you breakfast but wasn’t allowed to do it on his own but he didn’t want to wake you. So, naturally, here I am.” Draco shrugged like it wasn’t that big of a deal to just be in Harry’s house without his knowledge, cooking with his godson.
“Teddy,” Harry said softly to Teddy, noticing the curious look on the boy’s face. “This is your cousin, Mal-, ahem, Draco Malfoy.”
Harry nodded. “Saturday at 10. And don’t dress like a bum, we won’t be staying here.”
Harry walked into the Ministry feeling lighter than he had in years. He walked into his office to find a mess of bushy brown hair directly in front of him. He stopped suddenly and closed his door, making Hermione turn suddenly, Ron sitting directly behind her in Harry’s office chair.
Draco walked his usual route home, thinking about how many potions he had to make today, all those children that had been hit with the Dragon Pox. It just wasn’t fair. Thinking abut work had suddenly put Draco in a sour mood and his thoughts had turned to everything else, and the daily downward spiral had started again. He hurried home to try and get out of this headspace he was in and relax, but once in the door, he realized that all his home was going to do was make this feeling he had worse. He went to his kitchen, grabbed a bottle of Whiskey and put in an order for Chinese takeaway. He sat down in his armchair as he waited for his food and watched the fire blaze again.
“If you ever need to talk or anything Malfoy,” He heard Potter saying, his voice slowly backing away, “Just reach out.” Draco heard something move next to him, and when he turned his head after it went silent for what seemed like a reasonable amount of time to assume Potter had left, and noticed a card on edge of the window to the pub. Draco grabbed it and saw the same scratchy handwriting he remembered from his childhood.
Draco nodded once more, walked over and grabbed the clothes off the table and headed towards the stairs. He stopped and turned to look at Harry, who was still in the kitchen. “Harry?” The man looked up at him. “Thank you… for, well, I had fun today. But also, for letting me…” His words trailed off as Harry walked over to him. Harry placed his hand on Draco’s shoulder and smiled.
“I know, she was typically the reason Ron and I had survived every year. I don’t think either of us would be alive today without her being our friend throughout school. But when we had entered the lavatory, the troll was making a right mess of it, smashing everything it could to try and get Hermione, it was terrible. We had tried to distract it to keep it away from her and knowing Ron and I, we didn’t think that through all the way because it had come for us at that point.” He shot a glance at Draco who was back to laughing, holding his stomach and face turning red. “So, I had jumped on the back of this thing, which was, of course, a stupid idea, and somehow my wand got stuck up his nose.” Draco almost fell over at this point in the story, he was laughing so hard.
“Troll boogers? You have to be joking at this point, right?” Draco could hardly breathe he was laughing so hard now.
Draco and Potter looked at each other at the same time now, unsure of what to tell Teddy.
“Is that what brought those on?” Draco nodded at Harry’s arm. Harry looked down at where Draco nodded and gave a soft chuckle.
Both Harry and Draco made their way over to the sorting hat, Harry smiling and almost bouncing in his walk, while Draco followed slowly behind, hesitant.
The green flame went down around Harry as he landed in the fireplace of Andromeda Tonks. He stepped out onto the rug and listened closely around him, a bad habit he has yet to break in the last 8 years, and suddenly out of nowhere a frenzy of blue succumbed his face and a vice like grip wrapped around his neck.
Draco sat down and looked over the recent files that lay across his desk. There seemed to have been a recent increase in healing potions lately and Draco’s stomach turned at the thought of it. “How many dragon pox remedies do we need today Elowite?” Draco said sourly, just thinking about the children in the recent breakout always bothered him.
“Wait, Draco.” Harry stood up and placed a hand on his shoulder, which sent shivers through his spine, something that he had never felt before and surprised him. “Molly invited you to come for dinner as well.” Harry smiled widely and held the parchment out in front of him for Draco to read to confirm his suspicions that Harry could clearly see play on his face from his statement.
“Harry,” Hermione started before anyone else could say anything. “How have you been? We feel like we haven’t seen you in ages.” She placed a hand on her hip and looked at Harry with a worried expression.
Draco read the note three times over to make sure that he was reading everything correctly. He was, and with every word he read, his heart sank even more. The happy, comfortable feeling that he had previously felt coming home had disappeared. He sank back into his chair, waited for the takeaway and drank himself into a slumber. He was just done with the day at this point and didn’t see a reason to do anything else.
Teddy huffed again and shook his head. “Uncle Draco, do I have to do
The silence remained as they sat in the sitting room until Draco finally spoke up. “He’s a very smart child.” He looked at Harry and smiled, a bit of adoration in his eyes for the boy.
“I think he needs to get to know his cousin. Even if I never fully did.” Harry smiled at him and held out his hand. Draco took it cautiously, still always worried this whole thing was a trick. “And who knows, maybe we can talk more about how obnoxiously big prats we were back then.” Harry smiled at Draco and he could tell that it was a genuine one.
“I’m fine Hermione. Honest.” Her facial expression calmed, but not by much. “I’m serious Hermione! Nothing went down, he didn’t try to hex or jinx me. He just… sat.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I promise. Molly just wants to get to know you. Ron and Hermione told her that we’ve become friends recently and when it comes to Molly, if her children, birth or “adoptive”, say that someone’s changed, she believes them and wants to get to know them for who they are now instead of who they were.” Harry smiled at Draco and put his other hand on Draco’s other shoulder. “I promise you Draco, they just want to get to know you, the
Draco stood up and walked over to the fireplace. He knew he would regret this decision as soon as he made it, but he was at a point of no return. He grabbed a handful of floo powder from the cup on the mantle, threw it into the fire, when the fire blazed a brilliant emerald green, he said the address and suddenly, Potter’s face appeared before him.
“Um, yeah. Just had a moment. Nothing to worry about Harry.” Draco feigned his best smile and turned to look at Teddy, ignoring the questionable look on Harry’s face. “So, why aren’t you using magic? Aren’t you worried that he’s going to make a huge mess?”
“Who’s bothering me while I’m sleeping? I know it’s not time for another sorting, so what do you want?” The hat groaned. When it finally opened it’s eye flaps and noticed Harry and Draco standing in front of it, it’s tone suddenly changed. “Harry Potter! And Draco Malfoy! What brings the two of you to come visit me?”
Harry rolled his eyes at the child and pulled him down off the counter. He set him at the table and made himself a plate. Once finished with breakfast, Harry cleaned up and changed Teddy and himself and dropped off his godson to Andromeda’s house. After what seemed like an hour of Andromeda complaining about his job, Harry finally set off to work.
Draco nodded and looked over at Granger.
“Malfoy.” He said with a slight hesitation.
Teddy’s eyes lit up, and for the first time, Draco saw the boy's talent in action, as his eyes turned from the bright violet, to a fierce yellow, almost as bright and fierce as the sun. Draco stared for just a moment at Teddy and then up at Harry. Harry looked over at Teddy and noticed the drastic change in the boy's eyes. “Hey buddy?” Harry piped up, making the boy turn to look at him. “Remember, not everyone is used to your gifts?” Teddy turned back to Draco with a shocked expression.
“Harry? What would you like for lunch? I’m sure you’re not fond of young Teddy eating cake for lunch.”
in the school and you and Weasley just so happened to knock the damn thing unconscious. What were the two of you
“Daddy!” Yelled the small voice and Harry’s head snapped in the direction of the voice.
Draco looked up at him and nodded. He wasn’t sure if he could open up about it, especially not to Harry, but knowing that there was someone in the world that would listen, and, Draco felt, wouldn’t judge him, made him feel better about it. “You mind if I stop by again tomorrow?” His voice sounded hopeful, much to his surprise.
“Yes, it’s still here, it’s right around the corner there. It might be sleeping so don’t be upset if it doesn’t want to answer your questions.” McGonagall smiled and pointed to where the sorting hat sat, sleeping soundly on a shelf.
“Sure.”
“Shit.” He dropped the cigarette quickly and looked up, it had gotten dark out and Draco hadn’t even noticed. He turned and walked to his flat. Once inside he looked around, the flat wasn’t that big, just something to put a roof over his head since the divorce, so it never really felt like home. He turned the light on and walked to the kitchen, poured himself a little more than a finger of whiskey and leaned against the counter.
“Obviously. Can I come through?”
“Yours truly.” Draco leaned back in the armchair and threw his arms out in satisfaction.
Draco almost laughed at his mother being called Aunt Cissy, but he held his composure for the sake of the child. “Yes, yes I am. And you must be Teddy.” Draco smiled at him, realizing the boy was only looking at him the way he was to make sure his memory was serving him well.
“I’m just…” His voice faded as he tried to find the words to express what was going on in his head. Scared? Worried? Petrified? He honestly couldn’t place what the feeling was but didn’t have much time to think about it, because before he knew it, a hand was placed on his shoulder once more and the wave of relief flew over him just like in Harry’s sitting room.
Draco hung his head low in his hands, setting his glass aside, and felt a sudden heat rising from his chest. He had tried to push back the emotions for so long about all the shit that he had gone through in such a short time, but he felt as if he was finally at a breaking point that couldn’t be reversed. The card was still in his hand and he looked it over once more.
Harry’s laugh became so infectious that Draco started laughing too. They both laughed so hard they ended up keeling over, holding their stomachs, faces both bright red. When they both sat up and looked at each other, their smiles faltered some, but they remained on their faces.
Draco closed his eyes and pinched the top of his nose between his eyes and sighed. “I suppose.”
invite you.” He laughed softly to himself as he said this, still trying to figure out why he did in the first place.
Draco looked at Harry as Teddy walked out of the room and they both sat in silence for a moment before Harry stood up and headed towards the sitting room. He looked back at Draco when he was halfway to the room, “Would you like to come sit?” Draco nodded and followed the man and sat down in the armchair as Harry sat down on the couch.
“See? He’s fine, he just needs the story every now and then.” Ron smiled softly to Harry. He had seen these moments with Teddy when they’ve stayed over at the Burrow or when Teddy came over for a playdate with Ron and Hermione’s daughter, Rose.
“Well,” Harry sighed, “I guess I can’t argue with that logic, mainly because I know Teddy probably would have decided to make breakfast even if you had said no. So I guess I can’t complain that he had some supervision so he wouldn’t hurt himself.”
“Scorpius.” He said instantly. He knew it was odd that he had picked out his child’s name before he had any children but he had read the name in one of his favorite stories and from that moment he knew that he would name his first son that. He looked back down at his son, watching him look around the room, back at Draco, over to Astoria and Draco couldn’t take his eyes off him. Draco heart was full for the first time in his life and basked in that moment for as long as he could.
Draco sat back down in the armchair in the center of his living room. He raised his wand and a bottle of whiskey and a tumbler gracefully landed beside him on the small table. He poured himself another glass, even though he had drunk nearly half of the bottle that Potter had left beside him, leaned back in the chair, and closed his eyes as he took a sip of the amber liquid. His mind played the evening over again. Potter looked surprised to see him there.
Draco nodded, “I need to run back to my flat, I seem to have gotten food all over my shirt… again.” He smiled and winked at Teddy, who laughed and ran upstairs into his room. “I’ll be back shortly.”
Teddy turned back to Draco with pleading eyes. Draco eventually gave in with an exasperated sigh. “I guess you are a kid. But you must know something about this toy. It’s a very special toy, so it needs to have a lot of love and care okay?” Teddy nodded quickly and Draco handed him the toy. Teddy ran over to the couch and Draco followed him and sat down in the armchair he was so familiar with. Teddy carefully unwrapped the toy and stared in amazement once he had pulled it from its wrappings.
Draco looked up at Potter with a worried look but was reassured with a nod from Potter and finally bent down to meet Teddy’s gaze.
“I’m sorry Malfoy, not everyone grew up all proper and shit like you.” He huffed and set down his fork, a hint of disdain in his voice. “But if it’s so unappealing, you can leave if you’d like. I won’t be offended to throw your food away.” Draco noticed a bit of hurt this time coming from the man across from him. Or was it discomfort? Draco couldn’t really tell.
His mind had gone back to right after the war, when everyone had wanted an interview, or a picture or an autograph and Harry had to do everything he could to avoid the public. He had ended up confining himself to either his house, Ron and Hermione’s or the Burrow. He had sold 12 Grimauld place during that time, he no longer wanted that constant reminder of his godfather and the Order. He broke up with Ginny because he felt as though he would hold her back in her life, wanted to play for the Harpies and make a name for herself outside of him and her family. She didn’t seem to fight much on it due to the fact that when they talked about it, they both realized that the only thing that they had in common anymore was the war, and it became to depressing for either of them. He finally was able to get his own place and hide out there after a while, thanks to Ron and Hermione doing the searching for him and handling most of the transaction due to the public frenzy that happened every time he walked out of the house.
“It hasn’t ended for me either, Potter.” Draco was looking at the man across from him with tired eyes. He didn’t know that Potter had felt this way. He had seen Potter in the Prophet, he knew everyone reveled him as their Savior, he knew they all told him that this was the best things had been in a long time thanks to him.
“He’s met Teddy?” The pair said in unison.
“I’d like that.” Draco smiled back. He finally stood up from the armchair and headed towards the fireplace.
“I didn’t do anything to him! I promise Daddy.” Teddy spun around to Harry and looked at him intently. “I was playing with him in my room, and I was showing him a picture of Mom and Dad and my heart hurt again when I was telling him the story you tell me, and then out of nowhere he started to get warm, but not so warm that it hurt, but I hugged him and…” Teddy trailed off, looking at the floor.
“I’m in here kiddo! Come here for a second, I’d like you to meet someone.” He nodded to Malfoy and gestured for him to come into the room.
Harry scooted closer to Draco and began explaining some of his tattoo’s. He showed the buck and doe he got for his parents, a lily field under them. There was a snitch done in great detail, a phoenix that wrapped around his bicep. Harry started pulling down his sleeve when something caught Draco’s eye.
Draco sighed, understanding Harry’s point. “I get it. It’s not easy saying no to a face like that.” He smiled at the man across the room. “But I might need to run home, I am a bit of a mess.” He gestured to the food covering himself.
He walked down the cobble stone road and ended up at a small toy shop a few blocks past Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes. He looked around the shelves and nothing had stood out to him that seemed proper to give the boy, the toys were either to simple for a child of his age or just seemed downright boring. He walked around for a few more minutes when out of the corner of his eye he spotted the perfect toy. He took it straight to the counter and smiled proudly at his decision as the woman behind the counter accepted his money and he walked out of the store.
“Yes, Malfoy. I read. Why does that surprise you?” He put the book down on the table and got up to gather the dishes to return them to the kitchen.
“I… I think he is.” Draco looked up at Harry who was eyeing Teddy curiously. He looked up to Draco and noticed the curiosity that was playing on his face as well.
Ps. Please invite Draco for me as well, Ron and Hermione told me the two of you have become friends recently and we would love to have him over as well and get to know him.
“What? Are you serious?”
When Harry finished Ron just looked at him with the same curiosity he had started with, finally, he gave a big sigh and put his hands on his knees. “Well mate, I don’t know what to tell you about that one.” He shook his head at Harry and looked as if he was giving it a bit more thought. “Ya’ know, you mind if I run this past ‘Mione and see what she has to say about it?”
