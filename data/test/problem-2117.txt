“Yeah it really was. One more party and we can get on with the house, and the nursery.” I grin at him.
He is so controlling. I stare at him and he runs a hand through his hair. He looks frustrated and angry. What’s his problem? Oh right, he has to deal with my drunk arse. I sway a little and he puts his hand on my shoulder to steady me. I feel a bit guilty then and so drink the water, all of it. I may have drunk it too fast though and now feel slightly queasy. I look at him through my drunk idlebrain and nod thoughtfully. He is looking yummy.
I widen my eyes at her. What is she doing? She widens her eyes back at me, and I realise she’s trying to make Harry jealous.
“So did I, that's why we are going on another date next Friday.” I smiled at her. She squeeked and pounced on me before I could object. Not that I would have, I loved Hermione’s hugs.
“Okay babe?” I ask him when he leans back against me. I put my arms under his armpits and take his hand over his chest. He squeezes them and nods.
“Fine, but don’t say I never do anything for you.” I crossed my arms and looked at her. She jumped up and down clapping her hands then. She looked so young and energetic. Not like she had been through a war and been working hard in the ministry for the past 4 years. I couldn’t help but smile with her.
“Thanks Harry. By the way, can you tell me about this hat you want me to speak to?” Ohhh she means the sorting hat.
“I’m going to bloody skin that ferret alive when I find him. I don’t know what he did but it must have been bad for Harry to break things off.”
“I’m coming in.” I tell him softly and open the door. When I see him, I have a quick flash back to the time he was crying in moaning myrtle's bathroom. I quickly clear that from my head though because the Draco now looks a mess and needs my help. He is leaning over the sink with the tap running and has clearly splashed his face a few times. His eyes are red rimmed and even through the wetness on his face, I can see the tears falling.
“Of course not. I like having you here.” He frowns as he says this and then glances at his watch. “It’s late.” And he turns to look at me. “You’re biting your lip.” His voice is husky, and he’s eyeing me speculatively.
“Harry.” A small voice said to me. I recognise it straight away and begin crying. “Harry, it's okay. I’m here, you don’t have to go anywhere you don’t want to. Just calm down and take some deep breathes with me.” Hermione say but it’s like she’s talking through fog. She takes my face in her hands and begins breathing deeply. I try to copy but it's no use, this ones a bad one and it’s gonna take more than a few breathing exercises. “Harry please. You’re scaring Draco. Just take some deep breaths.” As soon as she says Draco the fogginess recedes. I remember he’s still here and open my eyes wide. I look over to him and he looks like he's going to be sick. Shit! I need to calm down.
After that is over, we sit down at the picnic tables. There is food and drinks everywhere and people are talking and laughing and congratulating us.
“Okay I’m sorry.” He got out between laughter. “It's just, you and Malfoy! I never in a million years would have seen it coming.” He said and then just as I was about to speak he urged, “you and Malfoy!” And looked utterly puzzled. I just shrugged because if i was honest I didn’t know where it had come from either. It had just happened, mainly thanks to Teddy and Andromeda.
“I’m going to throw my stomach up one of these day.” He says rubbing his belly, he then looks down at it and starts talking. “Please be kinder to me little cherry, you’re killing me here.” I chuckle quietly and get down on my knees. I place my hands over Draco’s and get really close to his belly.
20 minutes later a grey looking Draco comes out of the room, arms filled with potions and pamphlets, followed by Katie.
“So, a termite problem ey?” I smirk at him. I catch his lips turning up just before he turns back to the toilet and throws up some more.
I narrow my eyes at him as I slip the pants on. My hair is a mess, and I know I’ll have to face the Pansy Parkinson Inquisition after he’s gone. Grabbing my bobble, I walk to my bedroom door, opening it to check for Pansy. She is not in the living room. I think I can hear her on the phone in her room. Harry follows me out. During the short walk from bedroom to front door, my thoughts and feelings ebb and flow, transforming. I’m no longer angry with him, I feel suddenly unbearably shy. I don't want him to go. For the first time, I’m wishing he was
“Uncle Harry, can I come to your new house tomorrow? I promise I'll be helpful.” Teddy holds on to my hand and pleads.
“Yes, your issues.” He fishes into his inside jacket pocket and pulls out a piece of paper. My email.
As soon as they are gone, crookshanks leaps off my shoulder and starts chewing one of the pillows on the sofa.
“Then why have you been crying? You never ever cry!” She sounds slightly panicked but I can tell she is trying to soften her voice. She comes over and puts her arms around me.
Ethan has his arm around my waist when I look up into the frosty green eyes of Harry Potter. Pansy is beside him.
This throws me. Do couples still say that? Only three months - is that why there have been so many? He doesn't keep them for long? Or have they had enough after three months?
“How was the holiday anyway.” I ask them both. Ron was very red and sunburnt. He looked in a lot of pain actually. Hermione had tanned very well but she probably put sun cream on unlike Ron.
Please note the date of origin: 1580-90. I would respectfully remind Sir that this is the twenty-first century. We have come a long way since then.
“As well?” Harry’s eyes burn and he raises a questioning eyebrow. I blush. He lifts his hand and traces my cheek with his fingers.
“I believe he has your eyes Mrs Potter.” Draco says then while looking into Leos green eyes, the same as mine and my mums. That does it for me then. I place my head in my hands and weep. Draco places his arm around me and pulls me into him. He strokes my hair and kisses my head.
Draco got me the newest broom as a present, after me telling him not to get me anything. But he said that if I’m allowed to buy him birthday presents, then he is allowed to buy me birthday presents. I couldn’t really argue with that logic. So me and Ron had spent all morning at the house trying it out.
“Because Hermione and Ron have gone to Greece for their 4 year anniversary and asked me to have crookshanks. And as to why he’s destroyed the place, well he hates me.” I look at him now and sulk. He offers me his hand and I gladly take it. He helps me up and I wince a bit from all the scratches on my hands.
I breathe deeply and collapse backwards onto the bed. That man is so confusing! He’s also kind of a tease, I think looking at my tented underwear. I roll my eyes and flip over onto my front. My hormones are racing and I feel needy and achy. Is this desire? Is this what that feels like?
As I’m heading for the couch I get a look around the spacious office and my eyes stop on some small painting hung on the wall. They are a series of muggle, forgotten objects painted in such precise detail they look like photographs. They are exquisite and I stop and stare at them.
And as I weep into my pillow silently, it’s the last idea I cling to. This is all I know, too. Perhaps together we can chart a new course.
“The irony is not lost on me,” he smiles sardonically. “Seriously, are you okay?” His eyes are intense, probing, demanding even. At the same time as asking this, he vanishes the cum from my stomach.
“Not yet.” He says breathing harder as another contraction takes over. After it's finished he looks at me. “Will you get behind me again please.” He pants out.
She hugs me and then gets up and hugs Draco. “Thank you so so so much guys. If you ever need a babysitter, I will be more than happy to help.” She chuckles while wiping her face.
Okay maybe a quick shag and then we can discuss the party. What harm can it do? Besides, this is moving too fast for me to start talking about Ron.
“I suppose, but don’t be gone too long, I’m still cold and just might have to find a replacement for you.”
I laugh, in spite of my tears. Tea is always the answer, according to Sev. I remember my mother complaining about him, saying that when it came to tea and sympathy, he was always good at the tea, not so hot on the sympathy.
“Breathe, Draco.” He whispers in my ear. Then suddenly he is stood up and heading for the bathroom. “Breakfast will be here soon, you must be hungry.” And he’s gone.
5 hours later. It has only been 5 fucking hours and this cat has destroyed my living room. He has put at least one hole in every pillow, he has brought the curtains down trying to climb up them, he attacked the fireplace and got soot everywhere, he’s smashed at least 3 things, and he is currently trying to dig through the sofa. Ive text Draco multiple times for help but he must be busy at work. I just can’t get crookshanks to stop, he won’t listen to me. I am definitely not letting him out of this room though. I've set up his litter tray and tried reading the pages Hermione gave me but he pounced on them like they were prey and ate them!
“Hey Nia. They're going good so far thank you. We had a look around the rest of the land yesterday and saw some interesting things.” Draco said to her. At that she twitched her eyes and looked a bit nervous, I could only tell because I’d been trained to see things like that in the aurors. I kicked Draco gently under the table and gave him warning eyes. I cleared my throat and chuckled.
“You’re such a dork.” He then pulled away and swiped the paintbrush along my cheek. I stood still for a minute and looked at him. He was laughing and very clearly in a playful mood.
Harry is standing over me grasping his want which he has transfigured into a riding crop. He’s wearing old, faded, ripped jeans and that’s all. He flicks the crop slowly into his palm as he gazes down at me. He’s smiling, triumphant. I cannot move. I am naked and shackled, spread-eagle on a large four poster bed. Reaching forward, he trails the tip of the crop from my forehead down the length of my nose, so I can smell the leather and magic coming from it, and over my parted panting lips. He pushes the tip into my mouth so I can taste the smooth, rich leather.
“Definitely.” He says and we head out. I write Nia a little note on the door before we leave, just in case she wants to talk. I tell her we will be back tomorrow and would love to see her again. I don’t know if she will see it or even if she will still be here in the morning but I hope she is.
He narrows his eyes, and then seems to remember himself. Releasing my hand, he takes my elbow and leads me out of the room.
“Is that normal? Or okay?” I ask just as Draco mumbles ‘lucky for you’. Thankfully Hermione doesn’t hear him.
“I told him I’d meet him at Andy’s at 2.” I looked at my watch and back over to Hermione. “Speaking of which, we should get going.” She nodded and we both looked over at Teddy. As soon as I saw him I froze and heard Hermione make a little gasping noise. Teddy was still playing with the ducks but instead of seeing his normal face, he had changed it into a ducks face. Memories came flooding back of Tonks messing around at the table changing her face into all sorts of animals including a duck. And then more memories came up of her and with them brought memories of Remus, like when he came over to tell me Teddy had arrived and they had named me godfather. I could feel wetness on my checks and realised I was crying. I hadn’t even realised Hermione had moved until I looked up again and saw her speaking to Teddy in a low voice. I covered my face with my hands and turned away, but I couldn’t get the memories to go. It's like they were assaulting my brain and I was getting a headache from it.
“We haven’t even discussed it yet sorry. I’m sure you're in the draw though.” I wink at her and she taps the back of my head.  Of course her and Ron are going to be godparents, but I do need to check with Draco.
“Well, Draco, I can be very persuasive.” He smirks and then looks down at my plate. “You should finish your breakfast and then I’ll escort you back to Hogwarts. I’ll pick you up from The Hogs Head at 8 and then we will fly to London.”
“Hey dragon.” I kiss him and he blushes. “Did you have a nice sleep? Molly and Hermione are down stairs. Shall I bring them up?” I ask him, sitting down next to him and giving him a hug.
“I’ve never slept with anyone, never had sex in my bed, never flown anyone on Charlie Tango, never introduced anyone to my mother. What are you doing to me?” His eyes burn, their intensity takes my breath away.
“Right, we better get going. I’ll see you very soon little cub. Andy, thank you for the cup of tea.”
“Have you had enough time? Do you have any questions before I do any more tests or go through everything with you?”
“Now now little cub, stop your crying.” I bounce him lightly in my arms and grab the bottle that Andromeda left on the side “are you hungry?” I ask him and put the bottle in his mouth. He just spits it out and screams louder. “Do you need a nappy change?” I check his nappy quickly but it’s clean. “I know!” I grab my wand and make some bubbles. Then I turn the bubbles into different animals and make them go in a circle above Teddy’s head. He stops crying instantly and waves his arms trying to catch the animals. “Phew.”
I blush. I’d forgotten my missing boxers. Fortunately, Weasley has climbed out of the car and is opening my door so he can’t hear our exchange. I scowl at Harry, who grins broadly as I turn and climb out of the car.
“Healer Bell wants to see me every 2 weeks and she has me on a bunch of potions. She wants to do some tests the next time I see her just to make sure the cherry’s doing okay. We don’t know if not taking any potions for the first 9 weeks would have done any harm so she wants to be thorough.” He goes a little pale when saying this so I squeeze him close and kiss the top of his head.
“Fuck you Harry Potter, oh sorry I mean Saviour.” He sneers at me and goes through the floo without me.
“Are you colleagues on the student paper?” Oh no. The blood drains from my face. I have nothing to do with the student paper. It’s Pansy’s paper, not mine.
“I don’t know Harry! I don’t know what I’m doing.” He sits up and leaves me to fall forward where he just was. I ignore the twinge of hurt and sit behind him while kissing the back of his neck now.
“I think you should meet Neville. He promised to come help with the greenhouse anyway, so i'll give him a call. He is the herbology professor at Hogwarts, but also an old friend.”
“Draco’s pregnant?” She says then. Fuck! Oh merlin! Draco is going to kill me, bring me back to life, and fucking kill me again.
15 minutes later I come upstairs thinking Draco is going to be asleep but instead he is throwing up in the bathroom. There is sick on the bed and the floor and a trail of blood.
“Pans will be delighted - if we can find a photographer.” I smile broadly at him, so happy that Pansy will be happy. His lips part, almost like he’s taking a sharp intake of breath. He blinks at me and looks sort of lost. Shit….Harry Potter’s lost look.
Holy shit! They must be worth a fortune and I immediately know who they are from. Pansy is reading from over my shoulder.
“Draco, Mollys having a party for Ron next week at the Burrow, and it would be amazing if you would join me. Molly has said you’re welcome and I know Ron and Hermione would love to have you there. And your mum said you didn’t have any plans. And well, I would love for you to finally meet everyone.” I shut myself up because Draco has gone very pale, more so than usual, and his hand has started to shake a bit in my hand. “Are you oka-“
Lily and Luna head to the kitchen while the house elves clear away our dessert glasses, while Mr Potter, Pansy, and Theo discuss the use of solar panels in the wizarding communities. Harry, feigning interest in their conversation, puts his hand once more on my knee, and his fingers travel up my thigh. My breathing hitches and I press my thighs together in a bid to halt his progress. I can see him smirk.
There’s an obscenely rich and powerful guy I’ve met and he wants some kind of strange kinky sexual relationship, in which I don't get a say in things. Ha, she’d probably keel over there and then.
“So what did you do last night?” I ask. She cocks her head at me and raises her eyebrows in a what-do-you-think-stupid look.
“What happened?” Should I tell her? Can I tell her? Would Draco mind? But Draco isn’t here and I need Hermione to help me.
“Yeah, they really needed him apparently.” She says and carries on fluffing up pillows on the window seat. While I am trying to build a cabinet. Hermione scrunches up her face then and holds her stomach. She told me she’s been having false contractions all morning and they will go away soon. She told me they were called Braxton hicks contractions and she had them a few days ago too.
2 days later and I’m lying on my couch drinking a bottle of fire whiskey. I don’t know what time it is and I don’t care to find out. Draco locked his floo and warded me from entering the manor. He won't answer any of my calls or texts or even owls. I may have lost him for good this time, so the only thing left to do is drink. I can hear a banging and distant shouting but I ignore it and turn the wireless up. Next thing, I hear the front door fly open and bang against the wall. Ron and Hermione run round the corner and skid to a halt. I just look at them and take another sip from the bottle.
“Dray.” He smiles his dazzling toothy smile, which his dark skin makes appear brighter, and I can’t be angry with him anymore.
“I’m sorry uncle Draco! I forgot!” Teddy is crying now and hugs into me where I’m holding him to my shoulder.
“No harry! It’s not you. I told you it’s nothing okay? So just leave it.” He pushes me aside and walks out. From the creaking of the floorboards I can hear, he has walked out the house. I want to follow him but I don’t know if i should. What if he wants to break up? It's all my fault, I pushed and pushed for this and now it's all crumbling. I didn’t even ask him before I made a life decision for us. It's my fault. I made him panic and pushed him and it's all my fault. It’s all my fault. It’s all my fault. It’s all my fault...
“Hey.” he summons me. I peek up at him, and his head is cokced to one side. “Draco, you’re a very beautiful man, the whole package. Don't hang your head like you’re ashamed. You have nothing to be ashamed of, and it’s a real joy to stand here and gaze at you.” He takes my chin in his hand and tilts my head up to reach his eyes. They are soft and warm, heated even. He’s so close. I could just reach up and touch him.
“Thank you,” he says, and before she can reply, he takes my elbow and steers me into an empty office. He checks to see if it’s empty, and then spells the door locked.
I get him comfy and then accio the books and parchment for today’s lesson. Nia comes rushing out then with her wand in hand. She might not even need it this time but she needs to learn to keep it with her. We sit down at the picnic table and begin the potions lesson, starting with polyjuice potion.
“It really needs more natural light in here. We will have to ask the window guy to put a couple more windows in.” Draco says while cleaning the only window currently installed.
I head back into our room and grab my bag, making sure Pansy’s parchment and recorder are in there. “I’ve made enough potion to last you the day and it should get you back on track. I've also told the house elfs to bring you up some soup later. Make sure you go back to bed and get some rest.” I tell her because I know what she’s like and could be sat there all day looking through her notes for the school newspaper. Pansy was the one who got it started the first year in Hogwarts and has stuck with it ever since.
I go into the kitchen again and they aren’t there. I huff and walk back to the stairs. Draco is just coming down with Leo.
“You’re biting your lip, and you haven't answered me.” He’s frowning. I grin up at him impishly. He looks glorious with his tousled hair, burning narrowed green eyes, and serious, dark expression.
“I really am sorry Harry, I did it in good will.” And then apparated away. I did feel a little bad about it but not much. Hermione should have just told us or not done it at all. I sombered over to Draco who was still staring off in the distance with red rimmed eyes.
It looks like a big blue balloon has popped on one side and a big pink balloon has popped on the other side. There is a huge stack of presents either side of the buffet table. There are banners and balloons and food everywhere. There is even a bouncy castle for the kids, which Teddy has just spotted and runs for.
“Heyyy.” I heard next and look over to Draco. He’s on his side with his head propped in his hand. I chuckle and carry on taking my shoes off.
I look around and it’s like we landed in a war zone. There were kids running around, babies crying, Molly shouting, Ron and Ginny fighting, and Arthur was messing with the volume of the new muggle tv I got him for Christmas. Same old same old then. It was like this at every family dinner, especially if EVERYONE was invited.
I take another sip of my whiskey and am definitely drunk now but I keep drinking anyway. It has always been Ron and Hermione that have been there for me and had to pick me up when I’ve fallen. I never in a million years would have defeated Voldemort without them. They are so smart and brave and confident. They are such good people. I need to tell them right now, how good they are.
“Oh my. Harry I’m sorry dear. I didn’t mean to offend.” Molly looks awfully guilty now which makes me feel bad.
“I thought you’d want this? A place of our own to raise a family and be together?” I said timidly, trying not to provoke more shouting.
“Ehhh you’re so soppy. My slytherin blood can’t take it.” He huffs at me but I can tell he’s joking and I know he loves it when I’m soppy. I change the subject anyway.
“Me, too.” he murmurs. “I’ve never had vanilla sex before. There’s a lot to be said for it. But then, maybe it’s because it’s with you.” He runs his thumb across my lower lip.
“What. The. Fuck?!” Ron says deadly calm. “Harry? We have been trying to call you and get through the floo for 2 days? You haven’t been to work, you haven’t seen Teddy, you didn’t even go to mums yesterday. We finally come around thinking you're dead and have to blow your front door off its hinges just to get it, and you're sitting here drinking?!” He throws his hands up and looks at Hermione. “I can’t deal with this right now. I need to get back to work. ‘Mione just… just-“ He shakes his head at me and throws his arm out and then just leaves.
“Yes of course! Brilliant idea molly!” Hermione says excitedly. Draco rolls his eyes and smiles a tiny bit. I think he’s liked today more than he thought he would, I know I have. Everyone laughs at Draco’s eye roll.
“Don’t worry Mr Potter, we won’t be doing much speaking about yourself today.” The woman says and so I just pat the space next to me for Hermione to sit down.
I open the door for him and stare down at the floor. This is the first time I have ever had sex in my home, and as sex goes, I think it was pretty damn fine. But now I feel like a receptacle - an empty vessel to be filled at his whim. Harry stops in the doorway and clasps my chin, forcing my eyes to meet his. His brow creases.
“Teddy is going to be a great man someday.” I say gently with pride. Draco turns over and puts his arm over my chest.
“I tried when we came in.” I tell her but she gives me the sad eyes and I cave. “Fine, give me a minute.”
“Finally got me where you want me then?” I laughed some more and he made a surprised laugh sort of noise.
“Hi.” I murmur as she drags me into the large hall. It’s all dark wood floors and antique rugs with a sweeping staircase to the second floor.
Fucking hell! I nearly spit my drink all over him and choke a little. That is very personal...and he didn’t answer me when I asked.
“Dray, are you okay? I thought you took the potion?” I say while rubbing his back. He straightens up then and takes a breath.
“Well we still have 20 more weeks to think.” He nods slowly and then the fireworks start and I open my eyes. It really is a beautiful night. The first half of this pregnancy has had its struggles and I’m sure the second half will have some, but I wouldn’t change it for the world.
A tremor runs through my whole body. I am naked in a bath with Harry Potter. If someone had told me I’d be doing this when I woke up in his hotel suite yesterday, I would not have believed them.
His words are my undoing, tipping me over the precipice. Cumming untouched, my body convulses around him, and loudly call out a garbled version of his name into the mattress. Harry follows with two sharp thrusts, and he freezes, pouring himself into me as he finds his release. He collapses on top of me, his face in my hair.
Then all of a sudden, Andy stands up and walks out of the room. We all stare after her and Teddy deflates from pretending to be fat and now looks sad.
“Keep still.” he murmurs, and then he leans down and kisses the inside of my thigh, trailing kisses up, over the thin material of my boxers, all the way up my cock.
“Oh I just thought you would be tired, love.” I wrap my arm around him and give him a kiss on the cheek.
Sorry again guys, I know it's late. Hope you enjoy it anyway and thank you for all the kudos and comments! x
“Because I’m a benefactor of Hogwarts, I went there myself. And for all intents and purposes, I couldn’t get Miss Parkinson off my back. She badgered and badgered my people, and I admire that kind of tenacity.”
“Mr Zabini.” Potters eyes are cold and there's static in the air between them. “Where do you want me?” His tone is slightly threatening.
After 2 hours at the park with Teddy and Draco we are finally back at ours. Andromeda offered to have us over for tea but she’s been having us over so much lately that we felt rather bad. So we decided to come back to grimmauld and spend some time relaxing. Which meant sitting on the sofa, watching soaps, and eating junk food.
My breathing is still ragged as I come down from my orgasm. His hand moves down my waist, to my hips, and over my boxers to cup me. Then suddenly my boxers are gone, he vanished them, and I am naked. He lifts my legs and then my hips and puts a pillow underneath me. I am fully on show to him and he takes advantage of it and starts to slowly circle my entrance. Briefly he closes his eyes, and his breath hitches.
Nia wanders off into the garden then and says she’s going for a walk. So me and Draco go into the kitchen and prepare tea. With everything sorted in here, we went shopping and stocked the cupboards and pantry. We even put a non-perishable spell on the food in the pantry as we stocked it like a bomb shelter.

“Call me Lily.” She grins, and Harry frowns. “So how did you two meet?” She looks questioningly at Harry, unable to hide her curiosity.
Then there’s a big boom and suddenly there’s a big pink baby wrapped in a blanket in the sky. It’s eyes are closed and it has bright red hair sticking out the blanket. Everyone cheers and Hermione screams a little. Her and Ron kiss and hug and everyone congratulates them.
“I have a breakfast meeting tomorrow at the hotel. Besides, I told you, I don't sleep with girlfriends, boyfriends, slaves, subs, or anyone. Friday and Saturday were exceptions. It won’t happen again.” I can hear the resolve behind his soft, husky voice.
“I’ve got a bit of work to do on it yet.” I tell him, slightly embarrassed. I rub the back of my neck and look away. Neville slaps my back and laughs.
“That is it Ronald! I have told you not to say that to me! I’m going home.” She turns to leave but I grab her arm.
He grabs my hand, collects his jacket, which is hanging on the back of the sofa, and leads me through the door. Oh, the many faces of Harry Potter.
“Who said romance was dead?” she whispers, horrified. I’ve shocked Pansy. I didn't think that was possible. I shrug apologetically.
“CAN WE GO TO THE PARK AND FEED THE DUCKIES!” He shouts while jumping up and down excitedly. I laugh and pick him up for a hug.
I stop at the other end of Hogsmeade and put my hands on my knees, breathing hard, dragging precious air into my lungs. Oh, this feels good, cathartic. I feel my resolve hardening. Yes, I need to tell him what’s okay and what isn’t. I need to email him my thoughts, and then we can discuss these on Wednesday. I take a deep, cleansing breath, then jog back to Hogwarts.
“Yes.” I breathe, because my mouth is suddenly parched. I hear the ice clink against the glass, and he leans down and kisses me, pouring a delicious, crisp liquid into my mouth as he does. It’s white wine. It’s so unexpected, so
We spend the rest of the dinner in silence and then we both leave. Draco leaves first so I talk to Andy.
“Okay, I'll see what I can do Mr Potter. One moment please.” She disappeared for a couple of minutes and then was back. “Okay mediwitch Bell has a free appointment at 10 past 4, is that okay?”
Harry is leaning casually against the bar, drinking a glass of white wine. He’s dressed in his customary white linen shirt, black jeans, and a black jacket. His hair is atrociously wild as ever. I sigh. I stand for a few seconds in the entrance of the bar, gazing at him, admiring the view. He glances, nervously I think, towards the entrance and stills when he sees me. Blinking a couple of times, he then smiles a slow, lazy, sexy smile that renders me speechless and all molten inside. Making a supreme effort not to bite my lip, I move forward, aware that I, Draco Malfoy of Clumsyville, could fall over right in front of him. He walks gracefully over to meet me.
Gregory Goyle shouts from the door. We were in Hogwarts together but he left to go to university in America. He used to be quite chubby and sort of a bully, but looking at him now I hardly recognise him. He is all muscle and a jawline to die for.
He must have been for a run and is wearing a grey tracksuit. The bottoms are hanging off his hips in that sexy way that all his pants seem to do. His clothes and hair are dark with sweat.
He strolls slowly towards me. Confident, sexy, eyes blazing, and my heart begins to pound. My blood’s pumping through my body. Desire, thick and hot, pools in my crotch. He stands in front of me, staring down into my eyes. He’s so fucking hot.
“Fine whatever, can we finish this room now.” He said while gesturing to the almost finished room we had started this morning.
Holy shit. I just wanted to call Pans, I want to call after him, but his sudden aloofness has left me paralysed. What happened to the generous, relaxed, smiling man who was making love to me not half an hour ago?
My mouth drops open and I am staggered by his lack of humility. Of course, I would know all this if I had done some research. Still, he’s acting like an arrogant prick. I decide to change tack and go back to Pansy’s questions.
“Well you were close with all the constellation names Ginny, but you were going to deep in. His name is Leo James Potter.” There are laughs and then awwws from everyone.
“You think I’m gonna let you stay anywhere but here for at least the next week?” He chuckles at me and sniffs. We are still wrapped around each other and Draco’s crying into my shoulder.
“Draco, stop this. Hermione doesn’t hate you. And you're not to blame for things your aunt did, it wasn’t you. There’s obviously been a mix up or something, i'll just phone her and ask her what the hell happened.” As I grabbed my phone out of my pocket it starts ringing. I answer and it’s Hermione asking how things are.
“Forget this! I’m going back to my quiet bed.” He says and then leaves the room. Me and Draco burst out laughing and I pick Leo up to stop him crying.
“Molly, these are beautiful. Thank you so much.” Draco says and holds the little jumper to his belly.
“Good boy.” he breathes, his thumb brushing my bottom lip. He steps away into his closet and comes back with a silver-grey silk woven tie.
“You are very responsive.” he breathes. “You’re going to have to learn to control that, and it’s going to be so much fun teaching you how.” He kisses me again.
“Hmm. you are so sweet, Mr Malfoy.” His nose glides down the side of my cock and pubic hair, biting me gently, teasing me with his tongue. Sitting up suddenly, he kneels at my feet, grasping both my ankles and spreading my legs wide.
“Open it and find out Daddy.” He kisses me again and I lean around him to open it with both hands. I take one look and burst out laughing.
“No, I don’t think that’s a good idea.” I stare down at his rules. Waxing! Waxing what? Everything? Ugh. And no smoking!
“I do, I do!” Teddy says while already trying to climb my back. I hear Draco mumble something like ‘I’d appreciate one’, and look behind me. He looks worn out and in pain. I take his hand after getting Teddy on my shoulders.
“Your mind, no, Draco, but your body - that I’ve gotten to know quite well since yesterday.” His voice is suggestive. How does he switch so quickly from one mood to the next? He’s so mercurial….it’s hard to keep up.
“Good.” I swallow nervously.” I have some questions, Mr Potter.” I push some of my hair out of my eyes and look down at the questions.
“Yes” I answer in a nervous, hardly there voice. I clear my throat and repeat “yes” in a more confident voice. Come on Malfoy, you got this.
After that it goes quite quickly, he cums first after I press against his prostate and a few thrusts later I’m cumming to. I pull out and collapse next to him breathing hard and sweating.
“That’s a good idea.” I tell her about the pub. “Draco’s….cranky.” I decide with. Nia slaps my hand lightly.
“All of them Harry! Me and Ron asked everyone we knew. We asked George and Angelina, we asked Neville, Luna, Ginny, my parents, Ron's parents, we even asked dean. They were either busy, allergic to cats, or just wouldn't put up with him.”
“Just making sure you make it through the door this time, Mr Malfoy.” He gives me a small smile and he is obviously referring back to my earlier less-than-elegant entry into the office. At this memory I blush once more.
“Oh so I don’t look pregnant, just fat!” I halt there at that, I know this conversation is going down hill now.
“Nothing, because I’m not going to stop. Healer Bell said it’s fine to use magic. She said I’ll feel a bit tired but that’s all. It won’t harm me or the baby. Besides, this is my house as well so I want to help. Together remember.” He carried on walking and I caught up to him and caught his arm in mine and held on.
“Yes.” I whisper, because that’s why I'm here. His smile is triumphant as he holds me tight and apparates us.
“I find it difficult to sleep, and I’m not used to sleeping with anyone.” he murmurs. I can’t fathom his mood. He seems a little despondent, but it’s difficult to tell in the darkness. Perhaps the tone of the piece he was playing. He puts his arm around me and gently walks me back to the bedroom.
I’ve still got Teddy on my shoulders when we get back to the house, so I get him down but keep hold of his hand so he doesn’t run off into the house on his own.
“What? Harry what’s happened? Please just take it and then talk to me.” I give in and take the sobering potion, while nearly throwing up. “Good, now go get a shower. I’ll clean up and then you're going to tell me what the hell happened.” I do as I’m told just because I can't be bothered arguing. I have no energy and I just want to sleep.
“Good things I hope. Oh and congratulations with the pregnancy! Have you got a scan picture? Harry and Draco have just shown me theirs.” Hermione looks at me with wide eyes then.
“It’s okay. So, are you still okay for tomorrow's lesson? Mcgonagall sent some plants so we can start herbology.”
“All to be expected unfortunately. To go with that, from now on you may have sleeping problems and be more tired than you already are, you’ll get stretch marks, but you already seem to have a few of them so no need to worry, indigestion and heartburn, swollen feet, and also symptoms from early pregnancy may come back. Such as morning sickness, cravings, heightened sense of smell,and mood swings. So be prepared.” She winked at me then and continued to do spells on Draco and the baby.
“What do you want to do first Teddy?” Draco asks. He’s holding Teddy’s hand and I’m pushing Leo in the pram. Teddys hair is the same blonde as Draco’s and Leo’s at the moment, while we are around muggles. At first he couldn’t decide between blonde or black but he went with blonde because he loves his new cousin so much. His words.
“Greg…..oh.” My sigh is exasperated. He’s not going to let this go. “Harry Potter.” I cannot help the annoyance in my voice. But it does the trick. Greg’s mouth falls open, and he gaps at me, struck dumb. Humph - even his
“Two glasses of the Pinot grigio.” Harry says with a voice of authority. I purse my lips, exasperated.
“Yeah guess we are.” He spoke softly while rubbing his belly. It’s weird how quickly we’ve both got used to Draco being pregnant.
“Okay okay, give me a minute.” I go into the bathroom and look at my hair in the mirror. I have my black jeans on, a green shirt with no tie, and my black and white converse. It’s the best I could do on short notice. Pansy says muggle clothes are so fashionable and if I’m honest I love how they look on me. I run a hand through my hair making sure it’s perfect and then realise that I will be putting a helmet on and getting on a broom in about 5 minutes, so it doesn’t really matter how my hair looks now.
“Hey Neville! Hey Hannah!” Nia says happily and skips over there. I throw my hands up and sigh. Then I remember I’m the teacher and throw a stinging hex at her leg.
“It’s okay, I’ll apparate us upstairs and you can tell me what to pack okay?” She nods and I grab her around the waist.
“Please, Draco.” He says against my lips. He smells of the alcohol we have been drinking. He starts kissing my jaw, making his way to my mouth. Suddenly I feel panicked, I’m drunk and this is getting out of control. I feel suffocated.
“Ermm yeah sure. It’s not a big deal really. In Hogwarts there are 4 houses. Each house means different things. So say you are sorted into Gryffindor, then it means the hat saw that you were brave, and confident, and daring. Whereas if you were placed in slytherin then the hat saw that you were cunning, and ambitious, and had pride. There is also Ravenclaw, which means you're intelligent, creative, and wise. And lastly is hufflepuff, which means your patient, loyal, and dedicated. The hat looks into your soul and sees which house you belong in. There have been some questionable choices made by the hat, like Hermione. Anyone who looks at her could swear she is Ravenclaw, but deep down when things got real, you saw that she belongs in Gryffindor. But with you it will only be for fun really. You don’t have to do anything you're not comfortable with, Nia.”
“Leo! Lily! Sirius! Scorpius!” He kisses each one on the head as they hug him. “Scorpius, Sirius, how’s slytherin?” He asks them. This was their first year in Hogwarts and both got sorted into slytherin. Lilys in Ravenclaw and Leo is a gryffindor.
Failure to comply with any of the above will result in immediate punishment, the nature of which shall be determined by the Dominant.
I lie panting and spent on the bed, eyes closed as he slowly pulls out of me. He rises immediately and dresses after casting a scourgify on us both. When he’s finally clothed, he climbs back on the bed and gently undoes my bindings and pulls my t-shirt off. I flex my fingers and rub my wrists, smiling at the woven pattern imprinted on my wrists from the tie. He pulls the duvet and quilt over me. I stare up at him completely dazed, and he smirks down at me.
“Just dump them anywhere Ron.” At that, Hermione gives me a stern look so I sigh and I add, “and you can let the cat out.”
After a couple of minutes he takes his head out of his hands and wraps himself around me to cry into my shoulder.
After another half an hour of chatting and people saying congratulations, people start leaving. Soon enough me, Draco, Teddy and Andy are the only ones left. Me and Draco are lounging on the couch, with him between my legs and my hands all over his belly. Andy is in her arm chair and Teddy’s almost asleep next to the fire.
“So Draco, you may start getting back ache more often, you may get pains in your stomach, headaches, nosebleeds, sore breasts, dizziness, feeling hot, and leg cramps. I'll give you a leaflet and if you are worried about anything then just call in and see me anytime.” She hands him some papers and then jumps, “oh! I almost forgot. Do you guys want to hear the baby’s heartbeat?” We both nod with wide eyes and Draco lies back down. Katie points her wand and mumbles a quick spell and then suddenly there is a thumping noise all around.
“Dray, what would it take for me to get you to not use any more heavy magic on the housework?” He stops then and glares at me.
“I haven't looked at my laptop today, or my phone.” Crap, has he been trying to call? I try my distraction technique that’s so effective on Pansy. “That was a great speech.”
“Okay.” He said without argument. He must be able to see how worried I am. A muggle is easy to deal with, but a witch is a whole other thing.
“I will decide that.” She lifts the blanket and examines her again. “Okay, time to start pushing.” She takes the blanket off and puts a clean white sheet down instead. Then she put Hermione’s legs in the stirrups and sits in her little stool, with her wand and other instruments next to her on a tray. “Next contraction, push as hard as you can.” She tells her now.
“See you next time devil cat.” I whisper to him. He got on a bit better after that first day but not by a lot. That cat will always be an evil genius and a pest.
“What?! Don’t you like it?! Did you think it was something else?” I ask him while getting onto my knees.
“You alright mate?” Ron says next to me and gives me a jab with his elbow. I didn’t even see him sit there but I’m glad he did.
The doorbell rings then, just as Draco’s about to start shouting and possibly throwing pillows. He huffs and crosses his arms.
“Ready for me,” he says. He spells some lube onto his finger and pushes it inside me, making me gasp. He moves it tantalisingly slowly, in, out, and I push against him, tilting my hips up.
I turn back to the task at hand, trying to hide my smile. He’s hard to stay mad at. Especially when he’s being so uncharacteristically playful. He opens a drawer and takes out two slate black placemats for the table. I pour the egg mix into the pan, pull out the bacon, turn it over, and put it back under the grill.
“You still need to speak with McGonagall.” Draco says to me and smirks. Dammit, I forgot about that.
“Good thinking.” I pull down two glasses from the cupboard and Draco gets the alcohol. He has to bend down to find it and I swear he’s showing off his arse on purpose. Then he wiggles it a bit and looks over his shoulder.
When I got to work for the lunch shift, the place was quite busy. I groaned inwardly and started taking orders. Things started to calm down after a bit and I was able to discreetly read and eat my lunch at the same time, all while sitting behind the bar. Aberforth, my boss, doesn’t really care what I do as long as I serve the customers and clean the rooms at the correct times.
“Hi ka-healer Bell. Draco hasn’t been himself lately. His emotions are all over the place, he’s always tired, he’s been throwing up for a couple of weeks…”
“No you won't be able to. chéri is only small, I can just feel sort of a fluttering inside. Merlin Harry, this is amazing.” I smile down at him and can see it’s making him happy so I carry on rubbing. “I think she knows it’s you, somehow.”
I blink, and he smiles his adorable lopsided smile at me. The waiter arrives with my wine, a small dish of mixed nuts, and another of olives.
“Yes I do.” He says and winks at me. I laugh and move the ladders so I can start painting the ceiling.
“Well I think it is. I’ve been your boyfriend for over a year, I’ve met your mother multiple times. I’m just asking you to spend a couple of hours with my family, with the other people in my life whom I love. And you are standing there lying to me to get out of it. They are good people and just because they don’t have as much money as you do, and they aren’t as posh as you, it doesn’t mean you can go on pretending they don’t exist!” My voice had slowly started raising and I had ended it nearly shouting. I could feel tears running down my face. I was upset, angry, hurt, and confused. I look at Draco once more for any signs he’s about to change his mind. But he’s just standing there with his arms crossed and a frown on his face. I look down and my tears fall to the floor. I grab my coat and walk towards the floo.
She’s really struggling to keep going herself. I can see the same tiredness in her eyes that I see in mine. But she keeps going for Teddy. She knows the baby needs her.
“Is there anything i can do?” I ask him and place his dressing gown over his shoulders to keep him warm.
“Then where the hell have you been!” Draco shouted while jumping to his feet and moving away. He wiped his face and ran a hand through his long hair. It was past his shoulders now and I just loved it. I wanted to put my hands though it right now, through that silky- “Are you cheating on my Harry?! Because if you are, just tell me!” He screamed at me from across the room. Okay that one surprised me, maybe we really are falling apart if he would suspect me of that. “Don’t just stand there like a moron. I know you cheated on Ginny, so what would make me any different.” He practically whispered this last comment and turned away to put his face in his hands once more. I strode across to him and put my hands around him from behind and kissed his ear while whispering,
This was supposed to be my day off, I was supposed to study for my English Literature and potion finals today. So of course Pansy, my dorm roommate, picks today of all days to have the flu. The thing is she has this big interview with the CEO of Potter enterprises holding inc, and she says it’s a chance in a lifetime and it took her months to get the interview. So of course she’s begging me to go for her instead.
“Draco, you’re pregnant. Ladders and mould definitely don’t mix well with pregnancy.” He let out his breath and turned around.
“I’m going to be 6 years old!” He points his chin and says proudly. That makes me laugh loudly because he looks just like Draco doing it. Draco glares at me and talks to Teddy ignoring me.
“You alright Draco?” Katie asks, looking a bit concerned herself now. She goes to do a spell and Draco jumps up.
“Merlin Harry. We are both going to be dads in less than 7 months.” He laughs and puts his head in his hands. “Who would have guessed?”
“This is my favourite tea.” I say with a quiet, breathy voice. He frowns, surely knowing I’m hiding something. I put the tea bag in the hot water and stir it around. When I feel it’s dark enough I take it out. I can feel Potter gazing at me and look up to find him looking quizzical.
We get down and get to work then, finishing the last bits of painting in the kitchen. As we are finishing up, I hear the piano again. I leave Nia to finish her bit and head to the music room to find Draco. He’s sitting at the piano playing like he’s alone in the whole world. I go up to him and take a seat next to him on the bench. He briefly stops, sees me and carries on.
“It’s fine. May I hold Teddy please?” I ask him before he goes. He nods and turns around to give me the baby. He is still crying but as soon as Draco puts him in my arms he stops. He opens his eyes and they turn green, then his hair goes black. I gasp and look at Andy.
It hits 6 o’clock and everyone starts arriving. Soon enough I see Hermione, Ron, and Rose. I head over with Leo in my arms. Hermione passes Rose to Ron and holds her arms out for Leo, who gladly goes into them. Then Ron passes me Rose, this is how it always goes.
After a couple of hours, and Leo being passed around like a game of pass the parcel, we decide to head home. We say our goodbyes and I pick up Teddy while. Draco pushes the pram.
21    We the undersigned have read and understood fully the provisions of this contract. We freely accept the terms of this contract and have acknowledged this by our signatures below.
“Oh. I’ll bear that in mind.” I murmur. “Though...I’m not quite sure I’d fit in here.” Oh no, did I say that out loud?
Her mouth drops open and I savour the moment of a speechless Pansy Parkinson. She grabs me and drags me into the corner.
Oh fuck...not the Pansy Parkinson inquisition. I shake my head at her in a way that says back off now. Of course, this is Pansy and I may as well be dealing with a blind, deaf and mute.
“A witch?! No I’m not. But yes I’m living in the old barn, I’m sorry. I've got nowhere else to go.” She was almost in tears now and still struggling in her seat. Me and Draco look at one another confused.
Can we go through all of these? No fisting. What is suspension? Genital clamps - you have got to be kidding me.
“I’d also like to say cheers to Leo - for turning one!” Andy stands up and says. We all cheer and Leo claps too which sets us all off laughing again. “And Angelina on her pregnancy announcement.” We carry on clapping. It quietens down a bit and then Draco stands up.
I choke on my tea, and stare at him, eyes wide and mouth gaping. He pats me gently on the back and passes me some orange juice. I cannot tell what he’s thinking.
“You jerk, get up. Otherwise I’m leaving and you can go back to dancing drunk in your underwear on your own.” He teased back. I put my hands up to my face and spoke through my fingers.
“No Draco. Today has shown me that anything can happen.” I grab the parchment and quill from before and sit across from him.
“Me, too. Men.” she says in mock disgust, possible forgetting that I too am a man. I roll my eyes internally. “They’re animals.” We both laugh.
“So what were you saying about your guide?” Theo asks his sister. “Did he not take to yours and Rolf’s whimsical ways?”
I finish with Nia and she gets on with the questions I set her. Then I take Andy and Teddy into the house. I take them to the nursery last.
Me, Draco and Hermione all freeze with wide eyes. Molly looks from Luna to Draco to me, then lets go of Draco’s hand. Ginny's eyes go wide and she nudges Luna, who had obviously told her already. Then I look to Ron. He’s looking at me and then Hermione and back again. She looks guilty and I think he knows she knows. He stands up and leaves through the floo.
We get going on the dining room again, this time Draco is doing the cleaning while I’m trying to fix the wall with magic. The wireless was on quietly and Draco was chatting to me, but I was too preoccupied with the wall to talk much.
“Come on dray, marry me.” I kissed him sweetly on his chin and leading up his jaw and then one on his mouth, he leaned in for more but caught himself and sat up.
“Okay, but stay close please.” Okay I was being a bit overprotective but I’ve been like this since the war and with the pregnancy so new in my mind, it was in overdrive.
“Draco, just relax and have fun. Do you want to top or bottom, I don’t mind either way as long as you’re comfortable.” He frowns then and pushes me away slightly. I know he's using his mask as a safety net because he’s embarrassed.
“You are a greedy boy.” he scolds, and his thumb slowly plays with my balls, circling and pressing down.
“That sounds like your heart talking rather than logic and facts.” I say while slightly beaming at him.
“Nia’s working today right? We will have to pop round and ask her what her favourite colours are. We can have lunch too.” I tell him.
“Fuck off, Pansy. You know I blush all the time. It’s an occupational hazard with me. Now stop being so ridiculous.” I turn and snap at her. She blinks at me and looks surprised. I rarely speak like that to Pansy. “He’s just so...intimating, that’s all.”
“I mean, it’s obvious...isn’t it?” I’m clumsy, and scruffy, and nowhere near gorgeous enough to fit in with everyone else I’ve seen.
And he moves, but this time he doesn't stop. He shifts onto his elbows so I can feel his weight on me, holding me down. And as I grow accustomed to the alien feeling, my hips move tentatively to meet his. Then he hits something inside of me and I see stars. He speeds up, hitting that spot each time and I moan. He pounds me, picking up speed, merciless, a relentless rhythm, and I keep up, my cock trapped between our stomachs catching friction. He grasps my head between his hands and kisses me hard, his teeth pulling at my lower lip again. I can feel my second orgasm approaching and he thrusts on and on. My body quivers and a sheen of sweat gathers over me. Oh fuck… I didn't know it would feel like this….didn't know it could feel as good as this. My thoughts are scattering…..there’s only sensation…..only him….only me….oh, please…..I stiffen.
As I stand and wait for our row to disperse, Pansy calls to me. She’s heading my way from the back door.
I’m sure me, and maybe Pansy, can figure the rest out later. After all, I’ve been using Pansy’s for four years.
We step outside and Harry shakes his head as if to clear his thoughts and gestures for me to go before him in a most gentlemanly manner.
“No I guess he didn’t, but he had you. And staying in the house didn’t do him any good. He was miserable and when he finally went out, he…” she couldn’t finish that sentence. My eyes were watering already and I punch the drawers next to me.
I can’t help but smile at her concern and her burning curiosity, but suddenly I feel shy. I blush. It was very private. All of it. Seeing and knowing what Harry has to hide. But I have to give her some details, because she won’t leave me alone until I do.
“He is just being nice.” I tell her but then I think about it and what I know of Harry Potter, is that he isn’t nice. Polite, maybe. What if Pansy is right? I mean he did say that he was glad Pansy didn't do the interview. I bit my lip and hug myself, considering the possibility that he might actually like me.
“No!” I laugh and kiss him. He giggles and nods. “You know what this means?” I ask him. He looks at me and tilts his head. “You officially beat Molly.” We both laugh and then the envelope is grabbed out of my hand. I look up to see Orion looking at it funny and tilting his head just like Draco just did.
A few minutes later we are chatting and watching Teddy play with the ducks. He’s giggling and running around with them pretending to quack.
“Ahhhhh.” He yells while pushing and gripping my hand. I try to be as supportive as I can and shush him while stroking his hair with my free hand.
“I might get a bit bigger yes, but I won’t be fat.” Draco says and crosses his arms while raising his chin. That just makes me snort and he hits me again.
“Oh you mean the old apple orchard? I heard that was up for sale but I didn’t know anyone brave enough to buy it.”
Two extra windows and a balcony was added in the end, to make it more light and so she could sit out on the balcony in the summer. The furniture was all arranged nicely so that the bedroom was at one end, with a waist high wall added to give privacy, and the sitting area in the middle with the bathroom through the door at the other end.
My mind drifts back to the afternoon. Given what I understand of his preferences, I think he’s been easy on me.
“I wish they were here to see this though, all of them.”  I look to Ron and remember Fred and then to Hermione and remember Remus and Tonks. I remember Dumbledore and Snape, Cedric and Sirius, Hedwig and Dobby, Ted Tonks and Alastor Moody, Lavender and Colin, and the rest of the fallen, and especially mum and Dad.
“Well, we can start with: How was last night for you?” His eyes burn, filled with curiosity. He’s anxious to know. Wow.
“You are doing amazing my love! Keep going.” Then my phone rings but I leave it until Draco’s comfy again. Then it’s gone off but I ring back.
“Guys, I really need you right now. Please stay.” That seems to cool them both down and they turn to me with worried looks.
“Well, apart from the NDA, a contract saying what we will and won’t do. I need to know your limits, and you need to know mine. This is consensual, Draco.”
When we were both out of breath and both our faces hurt from laughing, we lay down next to each other. We were both covered in paint from head to toe but we didn’t care. We had had so much fun today, just spending time together.
“Haven’t seen you around for a few weeks Potter, have you been rolling around in all your fame?” He sneers at me, but I don’t take the bait.
“So, Audrey got Rose right for baby Weasley,” everyone cheers faintly, as to not set off either of the babies. “What about baby Potter-Malfoy?” She says and everyone looks at us. I’m just about to speak when Draco talks.
The Submissive will obey any instructions given by the Dominant immediately without hesitation or reservation and in an expeditious manner. The Submissive will agree to any sexual activity deemed fit and pleasurable by the Dominant excepting those activities that are outlined in hard limits (Appendix 2). He will also do so eagerly and without hesitation.
I get back to Hogwarts and Mcgonagall is there waiting for me. I speak to her quickly, not really in a chatting mood. I've had a long day and it’s quite late already. I tell her goodnight and slump off to mine and Pansy’s room.
“Ugh, fucks sake Draco!” Blaise jumps back in disgust. Potter is next to me then and pushes the hair out of my face. He gently leads me over to a raised flower bed, and I note that it's in relative darkness. Thank fuck.
“Yeah I’m fine. Floo is better than apparation but still bad.” He half heartedly chuckles. I pull him into a hug.
The rest of the week passes in a blur of studying and working and classes. Then suddenly it’s Friday night and me and Pansy are debating what to do. We want some time off from studying and to be quite honest, I want to get pissed.
He turns to my other knee and kisses his way up my thigh, kissing, licking, sucking, and then he is between my legs, running his nose up and down my cock, very softly, very gently. I writhe…..oh fuck!
“You’re tears say differently!” Hermione tells Draco stubbornly. I get up and rush to the living room. When i see him, he has clearly been crying, i pause. He looks just as bad as me truth be told, but always so beautiful.
“No, Draco. Dark knight maybe.” He shakes his head and there’s that secret smile once more. “Did you eat last night?” He suddenly shifts to serious. I shake my head at him. He clenches his jaw. What the fuck have I done now?
“Hmm maybe i will.” I wink at him and he blushes. It’s so easy to make him blush because of his pale skin. I grab his hand and lead him to the front door. “So, where are we going for this game?”
The waiter arrives with our first course. How can I possibly eat? Bloody Merlin - he’s ordered oysters on a bed of ice.
Oh shit. Less than an hour before the big reveal. My stomach suddenly drops again and I’m immediately nervous again. Holy shit, what has he got in store for me?
“Wow.” Is all I can say. It’s amazing, and it’s there and it’s alive. Me and Draco made that. I take his hand and squeeze it. After a minute it’s gone again.
He’s such a complicated person. And now I have an insight as to why. A young man deprived of his adolescence, sexually abused by some evil Mrs Robinson figure….no wonder he’s old before his time. My heart fills with sadness at the thought of what he must have been through. I’m not naive to know exactly what, but the research should shed some light. But do I really want to know? Do I want to explore this world I know nothing about? It’s such a big step.
“I couldn’t agree more Mr Malfoy.” He replies in a soft voice and the side of his mouth turned up. That does me in and I find myself blushing.
“Why have you never had vanilla sex before? Have you always done...erm, what you’ve done?” I ask, intrigued.
“It can’t have been that bad.” She laughs at me. “Anyway, he sounds quite taken with you, so maybe he is gay.” I roll my eyes at her even though she can’t see me, then proceed to make my cup of tea.
Suddenly, he sits up and pulls his boxers off and throws them to the floor. His cock springs free. Holy shit…. He reaches over to the bedside table and grabs a foil packet, and then moves between my legs, spreading them farther apart. He kneels up and pulls a condom onto his considerable length and lubes it up. Oh no...will it? How?
“Well you better get used to it because in 7 months there will be one more.” I remind him and move to get up off the couch. He stops me with a hand on my elbow. I look over to him and he’s got a warm smile on his face.
“Merlin no Harry! I think they are amazing. The things you tell me are great and I’m so glad you had someone there for you to support you through Hogwarts and ever since. I owe them so much just because they loved you and took you in!” He’s almost shouting through the sound of the rain now. I look at him confused.
“Where do we even start?” Draco asked, staring at the now fully broken front door, not having the courage to enter the house just yet. Luckily he had me and all my gryffindor courage that he usually winds me up about.
“Seems a good young man. Well off, too. You could do a lot worse, Draco. Though why I had to hear about him from Pansy…..” he scolds.
“Weasley.” He calls, making me jump slightly. Weasley comes back up the corridor. “Can you help Mr Malfoy's friends pack their equipment away and inform them that he is coming for coffee with me.”
“No Draco, it's fine really. I just didn’t want to keep shouting was all.” He looks relieved at this and I tell him what happened and about Tonks. He listens to every word and understands because he knows Teddy and he knows of Tonks.. and he knows about how hard the war was. After that we decide to get into the game and both mount our brooms once more. I realise the snitch and off we go.
Oh! I didn’t actually know this, and for a moment I get distracted with the thought that this man - who’s about 6 years older than me and mega-successful in all worlds - is going to present me with my degrees. I frown and drag my attention back to the task at hand.
“Here.” Draco says next to me and passes Nia his photo. Good thing one of us remembers things. I smile at him and hug him to my side.
“Well silly’s, it means it is my birthday in 2 weeks!” He practically shouts. We burst out laughing. He’s so clever.
“Hello Teddy.” Draco says then and hugs him from where he is attached to me, then kisses his head to. Teddy reaches for his stomach and strokes it gently.
The Three Broomsticks is packed with students who have just finished their exams. It is loud and hectic. Blaise joins us but he doesn’t graduate till next year. He’s always in the mood for a party though and keeps buying pitchers of margaritas for us all. I keep thinking I shouldn’t have my next drink, but then have it anyway. What the hell, it’s a celebration.
The gates let me in, and suddenly I’m a teenager again coming back from hogmeads. I always feel the same wonder coming back to Hogwarts, but I don’t get to come as often as I would like. This was my first real home. It was where I first made friends. It was where I found people who cared for me. And it was where I discovered real magic.
“Okay, thank you again. It's beautiful and I will never be able to repay you. It means so much to me.” She hugs us again and we head downstairs. Draco grabs my hand and squeezes.
“We didn’t all survive though.” Ron says. I turn to look at him quickly and he’s looking at Hermione like I thought he would be.
“I wanted to. You two have done so much for me so I just wanted to help out a bit.” She smiles at us and puts the paintbrush down. “Did everything go okay at the scan yesterday?”
“Yes alright Hermione, I’m sorry I’m ‘skittish’ but if you don’t remember i went through a war not knowing whether i would live or die or what was around the next corner. So please excuse my jumpy-ness. Now what do you want?”
“Oh.” Harry as a six-year-old boy….. My mind conjures an image of a beautiful, black-haired little boy with green eyes and my heart melts - a moppet-haired kid who likes impossibly sad music.
“He’s broken hearted Ron, imagine if we separated. You’d be a mess too. He just needs time. It’s only been a week, and he loves Draco very much.” Hermione whispers back.
“Yes, thank you it was lovely.” She tells me how much and I pay her, then add some money to the tip jar.
I carry my broom until I get onto an open bit of grass and then I climb on and cast a protector on my hair. After that, I’m in the air and it doesn't take me long to get there. I arrive at the hotel at precisely six fifty-eight and head inside. I shrink my broom and place it in my pocket.
“First for me, too,” he whispers, then smiles wickedly. “Bet you wish you were wearing your boxers right now,” he teases.
“Hey Hermione, can I hold Rosie.” I ask after a few minutes of quiet chatting. She nods and passes her over.
Little Miss Pigtails returns, all coy glances and swaying hips, with our entrées: beef wellington, I think. Fortunately, she gives us our plates and then leaves, although she lingers handing Harry his. He looks quizzically at me as I watch her close the dining room door.
“Please call me Andy, Harry. Everything is fine, I’m finished with my jobs if you want to go home.” She says and strokes my hair.
Pansy lent me her new broom for two reasons. The first being that it is a fast broom! From Scotland to London is going to take a few hours but a lot less time on her broom than mine, and second being that my broom probably wouldn't even make it that far. It’s old and slow and on its last legs, but I still love it and it's been with me since day one of Hogwarts when I was 11. I’m now 21, so I’ve had it for ten years and it wasn’t new then.
“He seems très cool about it, Draco. Don't sweat it. Look at him now - Harry cannot take his eyes off you.” I glance up, and both Sev and Harry are looking at me. “He’s been watching you like a hawk.”
The ceremony takes another hour to conclude. It’s interminable. Finally, McGonagall leads the other professors off through the side door to yet more rousing applause, preceded by Harry and Pansy. Harry does not glance at me, even though I’m willing him to do it. I pout.
“Thanks mate. Merlin, we haven’t even thought about the wedding yet, I think we are going to wait until after the baby.” He snorts and we are silent for a minute, then I just blurt out calmly;
This place is such a mess, I don’t even know where the wipes are. I look in the nursery and they aren’t there so I go into our room. They are in the Moses basket, no wonder I didn’t pick them up. I also pick up his tiny dragon teddy I got him just before he was born. He loves the thing already.
I decide now is a good time to step out, so I leave quietly. Just as I’m at the door a hand on my shoulder turns me around. And then Ron is hugging me with a death grip.
I do as he asks, and he binds my wrists together with his tie, knotting it firmly. His eyes are bright with excitement. He tugs at the binding. It’s secure. What now? My pulse has gone through the roof, my heart beating a frantic rhythm. He runs his fingers down the side of my face.
“Yes alright Sherlock, no he didn’t stay, and no we didn’t sleep together but that doesn’t mean it didn’t go great.” When I thought about that I furthered on it and said, “okay no it didn’t go great but we made up for it in the end and I’m seeing him next Friday. Happy now?” I asked their confused faces.
I put my arm through his, and we stroll out with the throng into the warmth of the early afternoon. We pass the line for the official photographer.
“It’s okay Dray. I’m really sorry for what I said and I want to be there for you and support you through this.” I sob back.
“You have a date with Harry Potter?” he says finally, once he’s over the shock. Disbelief is evident in his voice.
His world, indeed, and I want to belong in it, but on his terms? I just don't know. He hasn’t mentioned that bloody contract. I stare out the window and the landscape has changed. The somber night reflects my introspective mood, closing in, suffocating.
“You should find me intimidating. You’re very honest.” He pauses briefly. “Please don’t look down, I like to see your face.”
“Tell anyone and I’ll have to tell everyone you got hit by a rogue bludger and you’ve gone mad. I think they’ll believe that over me handing out compliments.” He says almost proudly and points his chin out.
“Draco…” I croaked and coughed to clear my throat, “what are you doing here?” I stupidly asked him, I knew what he was doing here and he was just, I looked at the clock, ...an hour and 15 minutes late!
“It is.” He closes his eyes briefly. When he opens them, they are wide and grave. “Draco, you have to go with your gut. Do the research, read the contract - I’m happy to discuss any aspect. I’ll be in Scotland until Friday if you want to make this work. In fact, I’ve never wanted anything as much as I want this to work.”
“Mr Potter.” I nod at him and turn to go. In the next seconds he is at the door opening it wide for me. I frown at him and he smirks ever so slightly.
“Do you want to come back with me?” I ask. I don't want him to go. I want to prolong our time together.
I looked at my watch and decide I have plenty of time to tell Nia the good news and continue the house. So I floo to the manor to see if Draco wants to join me.
“Just straightforward sex, Draco. No toys, no add-ons.” He shrugs. “You know….well, actually you don't, but that’s what it means.”
Suddenly there is a knock at the door and I jump as if I’ve been caught doing something bad. Blonde number two walks in with an apologetic but stern look on his face.
“It was okay...we got up every couple of hours with him and then he’d go straight back to sleep like now.” Draco tells her, then smiles down at Leo again like he can’t help it.
“Yes to our agreement. To being mine. Please, Draco.” he whispers pleading, emphasising the last word and my name. He kisses me again, sweetly, passionately, before he stands back and stares at me, blinking slightly. He takes my hand and leads me back to his bedroom, leaving me reeling, so I follow meekly. Stunned. He really wants this.
” he breathes in my ear. I whimper, exhausted, pulling against my restraint. I’m helpless, lost in an erotic torment.
Everyone’s in the kitchen now and a few tantrums are taking place, not just between children. Molly II is crying and saying Dominique pushed her over. It's not unlike Molly to cry, and it's not unlike Dominique to be a bit rough. So Dominique is told to say sorry which she doesn’t want to. Bill, who’s dealing with it, looks at Hermione and says “are you sure you want this ‘mione?” Everyone gives a chuckle at that, Draco and Hermione’s chuckles sound partially nervous though.
I go to say some of the old sweet passwords like sherbet lemon, but change my mind and instead say. “Dumbledore.” And the staircase starts moving. I should have known it would still be that, or maybe she changed it back for me.
“Oh Nia hey. Are you early?” I ask while checking my watch. It says 3 o’clock though, so she must be.
I find Potter by the main doors and we start our walk down to Hogsmeade. I suddenly realise that we have to talk to each other and my mind reales. What the hell are we going to talk about? What should I say to him? His warm voice brings me out of my reverie.
“Then what Harry? She must hate me because it’s the only reason she’d do something like this.” He signed.
“I’m so excited for you both. I can’t wait to talk about pregnancy with you Draco. It will be nice to have another pregnant person around. Everyone Is treating me like I’m fragile and need looking after, especially Ron. I know he’s just being kind but it’s driving me nuts and we are only on week 15.”
After a brief silence she moves on. “Do you want some supper?”  She asks and shouts for a house elf.
“I know they are Harry. You’re the best.” He says imitating my words to him this morning. I laugh wetly and turn to hug him. Then I pick Leo up and hug him too. We get up and I don’t feel like letting Leo go yet so I keep hold of him for now, which doesn’t seem to surprise Draco.
“More?” he says again softly. Testing the word - a small, simple word, but so full of promise. His thumb traces my lower lip. “You want hearts and flowers.”
15.3   The Dominant shall provide the Submissive with all necessary training and guidance in how to properly serve the Dominant.
“Hey! Before you say anything, no, we didn’t make plans to go flying. But it's such a lovely day today and I thought maybe you would like to?” He says shyly, obviously nervous to ask me about this.
“Okay,  Sugar?” I’m stunned for a moment thinking that he has just called me sugar. No you idiot, do you take sugar?
My head is swimming with all his words. I should have brought Pansy’s muggle recording device so I can listen to this again later - I suppose I could ask to borrow someone's pensieve. There is so much information, so much to process. The waiter re-emerges with our entrees: black cod, asparagus, and crushed potatoes with a hollandaise sauce. I have never felt less like food.
“SHIT! No way!” He shouts so loud that some birds in the trees get scared and take flight. Then he starts ripping the packaging open.
“Oh you mean Hermione. That’s fine because she’s pregnant and she will know not to tell anyone right?”
“Oh, I meant to say. Severus fire-called while you were….erm occupied. Apparently your father has sustained some injury, so your mother and he can’t make graduation. But Severus will be here Thursday. He wants you to call.”
4 o’clock come on quickly after that and people start arriving. Hermione and Ron get here first and give Nia some books, quills, and parchment as a present. Nia is beyond happy with that and thanks them.
“The healer said the baby is right at the back so i wont start showing for another few of weeks and she said my bump will be quite small until the end.”
Abruptly, I wake, gasping for breath, covered in sweat and feeling the aftershocks of my orgasm. Holy fuck. I’m completely disorientated.
“Luna was in ravenclaw, but she sat at any table, cheered on both teams at quidditch, and spoke to anyone who would listen to her,” Theo said while laughing. Luna smiled back at him and giggled. “I, however, am a fellow slytherin.” He winked at me and Pansy beamed.
“Oh ha ha. No, I don’t want your help. It's too dangerous and for your information I like to take my time to make sure I don’t miss anything. Like you missed that smudge over there.” I point at one of the windows but he didn’t fall for it and just glares me down.
“Oh, I wish I knew what you were thinking, Draco,” he whispers darkly, cupping my chin and raising my head so that we gaze intently into each other’s eyes.
“Shall we sit?” I said to Draco and led him over to the sofa in the corner of the room. It was an old but comfy sofa and as soon as you sat down, you would instantly slide into the middle. So me, Draco and baby Lucy were all squished in together. She was sat on Draco’s knee facing us and laughing at the funny faces he was making. He really was good with kids and I’ve never really noticed before.
“Hey love. Aunt Andromeda has gone home, I said we will have Teddy for the night.” He whispers, trying not to wake Teddy for a minute. I nod and he gives me a kiss.
“Because I love you, Draco. I would never do that to you, ever.” I said that ‘ever’ with as much force as i would while still being kind, he needed to know that. “It was different with Ginny, it was a guy i cheated on her with to see if i was actually gay. And you know what?” I turned him round to face me and removed his hand, with some struggle, from his face. “I’m glad i did. Otherwise I would have stayed with her and would never have been sure and then never have gotten with the most gorgeous, beautiful, cunning” I smirked at him while saying cunning and it worked because it got a little smile out of him, “man of my dreams.” I kissed him then, long and sweet unlike most of our kisses. It was nice and just what was called for.  “Now, if you don’t get your pretty arse over to that seat and listen to where I’ve been, then you’ll never find out and it will slowly kill you to never hear the best thing to ever happen.” Okay I was being a bit dramatic but it worked because Draco looked at me once with a raised eyebrow as if to say ‘the best thing?’ So I gave a small nod and he turned on his heels and went to sit down.
After seeing all of Teddy’s presents, we take him to the quidditch pitch and we spend the whole hour teaching him how to ride. He gets the hang of things pretty fast for a 6 year old. He’s a natural. So when we tell him it's time to go home, he starts to whine a little.
I fire-call Severus, who is just about to brew a potion, so our conversation is mercifully brief. He’s flooing over on Thursday for graduation. He wants to take me out afterwards for a meal. My heart swells talking to Severus, and a huge lump forms in my throat. He has been my constant through all the fights with my parents, mainly my father. We have a special bond that I treasure. Even though he’s my godfather, he’s always treated me as his own, and I can’t wait to see him. It’s been too long. His quiet fortitude is what I need now, what I miss. Maybe I can channel my inner Severus for my meeting tomorrow.
His email makes me weep more. I am not a merger. I am not an acquisition. Reading this, I might as well be. I don't reply. I just don't know what to say to him. I fumble into my PJs and, wrapping his jacket around me, I climb into bed. As I lie staring into darkness, I think of all the times he warned me to stay away.
After everyone has ate, Nia shows them her new room. They all love it and adore the moving paint. Then we all leave her to get ready to go out with her friends.
“Did I hurt you?” Harry asks as he lies down beside me propped on one elbow. He tucks a stray strand of my hair behind my ear. And I have to grin, widely.
“They have an excellent wine cellar here,” he says. Putting his elbows on the table, he steeples his fingers in front of his mouth, his eyes alive with some unreadable emotion. And there it is…. that familiar pull and charge of magic. I shift uncomfortably under his scrutiny, my heart palpitating. I must keep my cool.
I help Draco get comfy on a towel and then sit next to him. We are at a wizards only beach so Draco doesn’t have to put a glamour on his belly.
“Okay. Thanks George, we will see you tomorrow then.” I tell him, because Draco clearly is not up for talking and nobody is pushing him.
No activity that involves the direct contact of electrical current (whether alternating or direct), fire, or flames to the body.
“Yeah… but who would have thought we would end up like this. I mean, I didn’t even know about magic until Hagrid barged down my door. Then there was Voldermort, and the war, and everyone we lost....” I can’t carry on for a minute. Hermione wraps her arms around me and stays there, then Ron puts his hand on my shoulder. “And then there was Draco, and there was finally light. And now you two have a baby and mine is due in a couple of weeks.” We are all chuckling now, some of us with tears rolling down our face. “I wouldn’t change a bloody thing though, because it’s what got us here.” They both nod and then Hermione looks in the corner.
This chapter is kind of short, so I’m going to post chapter 5 as well this week. Which is also short sorry.
I glance up and Blaise is still hovering, watching us. I groan and put my head in my hands. This is the worst moment of my life. The only thing worse, that I can think of, is Harry's rejection. I glance at him now and he is staring down at me giving nothing away. Then I turn to Blaise again and glare at him. I will be having words with my so-called friend tomorrow.
I shudder at the thought of being flogged or whipped. Spanking probably wouldn’t be so bad; humiliating, though. And tied up? Well, he did tie my hands together. That was….well, it was hot, really hot, so perhaps that won’t be too bad. He won’t loan me to another Dominant - damn right he won’t. That would be totally unacceptable.
People walking past are looking at our little family and smiling. I keep an eye on Teddy and rock Leo’s pram to keep him quiet.
“Are you okay Hermione?” Ginny asks, causing everyone to stop their conversations and look up, which in turn makes Hermione blush.
My initial feeling is one of relief. He’s willing to discuss my issues at least, and he still wants to meet tomorrow. After some thought, I reply.
“Ohh. Merlin I wish I could have.” He chuckles and looks down at his stomach. I start moving towards the stairs again, thinking. We have a lot to discuss tomorrow. And we still have a house to rip out and put back together. I'll worry about that tomorrow though. For now, sleep calls for both of us.
“Don’t pretend, please. I’m so sorry Draco. I know I always miss dinner, but that’s changing from now. I will try my hardest to be home on time from now on, okay?” I asked him and looked in his eyes to make sure he knew I was telling the truth. Draco stared at me and then more tears started rolling down his cheek like he couldn’t stop them.
I go after Draco and find him in an empty waiting room with his head in his hands. His whole body is shaking from his crying. It may be silent but I can tell he is really upset. I sit down next to him and just hug him.
They shake hands. I feel sick. Sev has no idea how Harry intends to look after me. Harry takes my hand and brings it to his lips and kisses my knuckles tenderly, his scorching eyes intent on mine.
“Well I’m not. We will go home and get both the boys' coats. Then go to the flower park.” He says with his chin held high.
“Hey, don’t speak to me like that! I did nothing wrong. I just came to say that I will speak to Ron tonight and you should go be with Draco.” I sigh and look down at my shoes, while leaning against the fireplace.
I am comfortable and warm and it is quiet. I squint my eyes open….oww. That hurts. The quick glance I had told me I’m not in my room. I don’t know where I am. I peek my eyes open again, with my arm over my face, and see that I’m in a hotel suite. Holy shit. Last night comes back to me and the last thing I remember is Potter. Fuck….am I in Harry Potter’s hotel suite?
Me and Draco make our way to the sitting room and make ourselves comfortable. Then Teddy walks in pulling a tired looking Andy. She’s probably sad because it’s so close to Teddy’s birthday and she’s remembering Tonks.
Holy shit! What the hell is he doing here?!! He looks all outdoorsy with his unruly hair and his cream knit jumper, jeans, and walking boots. I realise my mouth is hanging open and can’t seem to locate my brain or voice.
“Yes of course we do.” I tell her, because we do. Me and Draco are both off work for a couple of weeks and we don’t need to be anywhere. Nia signs and looks out the window.
Luna starts talking about her recent trip to Paris now, and I shrink down hoping Harry isn’t paying attention. Why does France keep coming up?
“Here’s some money, go out and enjoy yourself!” I hand her an envelope with £50 in and then her taxi pulls up. she tries to pull away from the money but I shove it at her. “Enjoy!” I tell her.
“How do you know he broke things off? Did he tell you?” Hermione questions him. I hadn’t told him so how the hell did he know.
“See how good we are together?” he murmurs. “If you give yourself to me, it will be so much better. Trust me, Draco, I can take you places you don't even know exist.” His words echo my thoughts. He strokes his nose against mine. I am still reeling from my extraordinary physical reaction to him, and I gaze up at him blankly, grasping for a coherent thought.
“Now then.” He licks his bottom lip slowly. “You’re biting that lip, Draco. You know the effect it has on me.” He places his long index finger over my mouth, a warning.
“She’s at the burrow with Ron, Arthur, George, and little Freddie.” Then Draco says something that I don’t hear and they both laugh.
“Draco.” he whines and apologises simultaneously. I cannot deal with his petty jealousy now. I know he’s hurt, but my plate is overflowing dealing with Harry Potter.
“Sort of.” His voice is wary. He frowns for a moment and seems to be engaged in some internal struggle. Then he glances up, a decision made. “One of my mother’s friends seduced me when I was fifteen.”
I close my eyes, and drift into a heavy sleep with occasional dreams of a four-poster bed with shackles and intense green eyes.
“Leo. Leo James Potter.” Draco says quietly, still looking at our son. Then he looks up at me, smiles and starts crying again. I hug him close while crying a bit myself.
It’s 4:45 and I’m ready to leave, but I just have to make the bath all ready for when we get back. I add the bath salt and petals and a few candles here and there. I put a charm on the bath to keep it warm and I’ll light the candles when we get back. It looks romantic as hell in here, I hope he likes it. I leave my present on the sink and head for the floo.
“Draco, I’m going to cum in your mouth.” his breathy tone is warning. “If you don't want me to, stop now.” He thrusts his hips again, his eyes wide, wary, and filled with salacious need - need for me. Need for my mouth….oh fuck.
I go to my desk and pour some of the potion I’ve been working on into a vial. I hand it to her and a glass of water and she smiles at me, the best she can in her situation, and willingly swallows the potion down.
Before we can even knock on the door Teddy pulls it open and runs at us. He must remember the baby then because he stops just short of Draco and holds him hands out for a hug. Draco chuckles and bends down to squeeze him.
“Hey guys, you’re late. Everyone’s waiting…. you forgot didn’t you?” He said after taking one look at us. Me and Draco look at one another and sighed again because we did forget and we also knew we had to go. Molly had invited everyone round for tea today and we had promised we would be there. We had made that promise about 2 weeks ago though, and with all this house stuff, and baby stuff...and Nia stuff, i guess we just forgot.
“Harry are you okay? Are you crying?” Hermione asks from behind the door. I wipe my face and answer her.
What’s she going to say? I hear a faint popping sound. What’s that? He returns, the door creaking once more, his feet padding across the bedroom floor, and ice tinkling against glass as it swirls in liquid. What kind of drink? He shuts the door and shuffles around removing his pants. They drop to the floor, and I know he’s naked. He sits astride me again.
“Hold on.” I whisper and apparate us to the bedroom. I push him down on his back on my bed and crawl between his legs. All the while trying to kiss him and touch him as much as possible to keep him in the moment. I want this to be good for him. I pull my top and trousers off quickly leaving my underpants on. Next I go to grab his top and pull it over his head but he thinks I’m leaning in for a kiss so he leans forward too. I don’t mind giving him that of course. I’m nearly losing it by the time we break apart so i pull his shirt off and undo his trouser buttons slowly while kissing each one. He tries to thrust up but I hold his hips down.
“Teddy be careful with that please. It was my mother’s.” I tell him and he looks at me with knowing eyes. From one orphan to another.
I flush scarlet everywhere, feeling faint, and I instantly close my eyes. I can’t watch him do that!
“Yes I’m sure they are. As long as Draco does what I’ve asked and takes this potion once a day, then it will be alright.” She hands me a box of potions and some more leaflets on blood pressure.
Draco was better at this than I thought he would be and finished the windows in no time. I get down off the ladder and admire his handwork.
“This baby is going nowhere yet. He’s in here for another 10 weeks.” Everyone is laughing and retreating inside. 10 weeks. That’s all that's left before we meet Leo. I hope we’re ready.
I decide to deal with McGonagall tomorrow and with Ron tonight. I need to get Ron out the way so I don’t have to worry about it. He has been so supportive of us up to now but I’m just a bit worried that this pregnancy will cause him to explode with everything he hasn’t said so far.
“I need knickers, at least 4 pairs. Over there in the top drawer.” She points to her chest of drawers. I go over and grab a hand full, probably 5 or more. I shove them in the bag.
“Ahh yes right.” He darted over to the couch, probably hoping I’d sit next to him on it but I was still a bit angry so I took the chair. Which made him frown a bit.
“My father made me learn.” He says then and gets up. “Right, let's get to work then.” He changes the subject and accio’s the cleaning things from the other room.
“S-sorry,” I say, picking it up and looking at him once more. I think he’s trying to suppress a smile. “I’m not used to this.”
“Merlin, you're not even showing yet Hermione. How are you 15 weeks pregnant and not showing?” I ask her because surely by 15 weeks you must be showing. How long will I have to wait to see a bump on Draco.
A couple of hours later and everyone is sat down in the sitting room, stuffed after party food and cake. Teddy’s playing with his new presents with the other kids, he loves to share things, always has. Hermione stands up then.
Next thing, a blue haired Teddy rushes in. He takes a run at Draco but I step in front before he can hurt him and lift him into a hug.
“Yeah that sounds great! I’ve read all the books Hermione gave me on herbology, I think I’m really going to enjoy it.” She says excitedly.
Soon enough we’ve finished our tea and I’ve had a quick game of exploding snap with Teddy. I tell him I might see him tomorrow depending how Draco is. We say our goodbyes and I head back home through the floo.
“He’s twenty seven. I really am sorry, Dray. I should have briefed you, but I was panicking so much thinking I wouldn’t get anyone to do this interview for me, I forgot.”
Suddenly we are tilting and the front wheel is off the ground. I think he’s trying to do a trick to impress me but I just close my eyes and hide my face in his shoulder. Please don’t die, please don’t die, please don’t die. This is all I can think for the next few minutes until Harry's voice brings me back and I realise that the ride isn't as bumpy anymore but the wind is turning my fingers to ice.
“Thanks Andy, stand back Teddy.” After I know Teddy’s safely out the way, I step through and am immediately crashed into by Teddy who’s trying to wrap his arms around my waist.
“Ahhhhh! Harry!” He shouts while squeezing my fingers. “I can’t do this much longer! Get it out!” He cries to me. I kiss his head and push his hair out of his eyes.
“It’s okay love. It’s beautiful watching him grow up.” I say and rub his back but he just cries more.
“You’re moving this weekend to London. If you make the right decision, can I see you on Sunday?” He sounds hesitant.
I don't understand why you ran this evening. I sincerely hope I answered all your questions to your satisfaction. I know I have given you a great deal to contemplate, and I fervently hope that you will give my proposal your serious consideration. I really want to make this work. We will take it slow.
Hermione answers straight away and her face lights up at seeing Leo. Then she starts to cry and calls for Ron. He comes running in out of breath.
“I don’t trust that floo at the new house yet. I want a professional to check it out, not just you randomly sticking your head in it.” He tells me with a glare. So yeah, I kind of told him by accident I had used the floo. It slipped out, but now he wants me to owl a  ‘professional’ before we use it again. “So Apparation it is. Let’s go sort our little pest problem out.”
As we speed along through London, both of us quiet, no doubt inhibited by Weasley’s steady presence in the front. Harry’s mood is almost tangible and seems to shift, the humour dissipating slowly as we head north. He’s brooding, staring out the window, and I know he’s slipping away from me. What is he thinking? I can’t ask him. What can I say in front of Weasley?
I peek up at him. He’s enjoying a private joke, a trace of a smile flirting with his lovely mouth. I fear that it may be at my expense.
When we are finally back at grimmauld, I lead Draco to the bathroom and light the candles.  He stands in the doorway and I wrap my hands around his waist and rub his belly.
I go straight to the manor but Draco has locked me out of his floo so I land in the sitting area. I give Narcissa quite a fright.
“Hermione, what’s the issue?” he snaps. He listens, watching me, eyes speculative, as I stand in the middle of the huge room wondering what to do with myself, feeling extraordinarily self-conscious and out of place.
“Eclectic taste, Mr Malfoy,” he murmurs, and he paces towards me like a panther until he’s standing in front of me. His gaze so intense it takes my breath away.
“You know I like you, Draco.” He has a hand on my lower back now and he’s like a wall of muscle, I can’t move. He puts a hand in my hair and grips it so he can tilt my head.
“Not to me.” She says and lifts her eyebrow. “Sure, he’s got more money than you, but he has more money than probably anyone in the UK.”
To distract myself from the anxiety that blooms in my belly, I start doing what I told Pansy I would be doing - packing up my room. I begin by shrinking my books and putting them in my trunk. By nine, I’ve heard nothing.
It takes Teddy a while to settle down for bed that night after tea. He was too excited about sleeping here that he was basically bouncing off the walls. But eventually we got him off to sleep and got in bed ourselves.
“I thought you might.” He says before I can start asking them. Is he laughing at me? I blush once more at the realization, and sit up and square my shoulders in an attempt to look taller and more intimidating. I press start on the recorder, trying to ignore him, and ray my best to look professional.
“You can sit down now.” He halts my scattered thoughts, and I scoot down into the warm, welcoming water. Ohh….it stings and that takes me by surprise, but it smells heavenly, too. The initial smarting pain soon ebbs away. I lie back and briefly close my eyes, relaxing in the soothing warmth. When I open them again, he is gazing down at me.
“So little chéri is the size of a sweet potato at 20 weeks, and you're halfway through your pregnancy. Have you had any issues or concerns since I last saw you?” She asks Draco.
Quickly, he clambers out of the bath, giving me my first full glimpse of the Adonis, divinely formed, that is Harry Potter. His erection is tame but still substantial….wow. He wraps a small towel around his waist, and holds one out for me. Climbing out of the bath, I take his proffered hand. He wraps the towel around my waist, pulls me into his arms, and kisses me hard, pushing his tongue into my mouth. I long to reach around and embrace him…..touch him…..but he has my arms trapped. I’m soon lost in the kiss. He cradles my head, his tongue exploring my mouth, and I get a sense he’s expressing his gratitude - maybe - for my first blow job? Wow.
Holy shit. He grabs my left foot, bends my knee, and brings my foot to his mouth. Watching and assessing my every reaction, he tenderly kisses each toe, then bites each one of them softly on the pads. When he reaches my little toe, he botes harder, and I convulse, whimpering. He glides his tongue up my instep - and I can no longer watch him. It’s too erotic. I’m going to combust. I squeeze my eyes shut and try to absorb and manage all the sensations he’s creating. He kisses my ankle and trails kisses up my calf to my knee, stopping just above. He then starts on my right food, repeating the whole, seductive, mind-blowing process.
Percy's daughter Molly, who’s 3, and Bill's daughter Dominique, also 3, raced past and shouted hello. Bill’s other children, victoire (5 years old) and louis (just 1), were on the carpet together. Victoire was trying to get Louis to walk over to her, but he was more interested in the colours on the rag rug carpet. He had started taking a few steps at a time lately so Victoire was more interested than ever.
“I do have something else to say, well to ask.” He stands up and gets down on one knee in front of Hermione. He pulls a ring box from his pocket and opens it for her to see. “Hermione Jean Granger, I love you so much and I will love this child just as much. I know how much friends and family mean to you so i wanted to do this with all our friends around and when you had this plan of telling everyone together i just knew i needed to do this at the same time. So ‘mione will you marry me?” She’s crying now and everyone is silent waiting for her answer
“Yes maybe the colour, but it is starting to be just as messy as yours.” Draco says then. We all laugh and Teddy changes his hair colour from blue to black. I wink at him and scruff it up.
“Have a great time tonight Harry and tell me how it goes.” Hermione kissed my cheek and headed for the floo while grabbing Ron’s arm quite harshly.
The interview is at 2 so I race down to see Mcgonagall and then get outside, get on the broom, and swiftly take flight.
The Dominant shall provide the Submissive with a personal trainer four times a week in hour-long sessions at times to be mutually agreed between the personal trainer and the Submissive. The personal trainer will report to the Dominant on the Submissive’s progress.
15.20    The Submissive shall submit to any sexual activity demanded by the Dominant and shall do so without hesitation or argument.
“No, you sit… and talk.” She shoos him away. I sit down next to Ron and we sit in silence for a minute.
Early the next morning Katie floos in. Me and Draco are both awake watching a sleeping Leo in his basket. Draco has just fed him again and put him back down. Katie quietly knocks on the door and smiles at what she sees when she walks in.
I show them to Draco and move both chairs next to the bed. I sit on the other side of Draco on the bed and he leans into me.
“You cooked for me….that’s...that’s amazing. Thank you love.” I take his hand from across the table and place a kiss on it. He blushes even more now and tries to hide his face. After a minute he pulls his hand back and picks his spoon up.
The dining room reminds me of our private dinner at Harry’s hotel. A crystal chandelier hangs over the dark wood table and there’s a massive, ornately carved mirror on the wall. The table, covered with a crisp white linen tablecloth, is set, with a bowl of pale pink peonies as the centrepiece. It’s stunning.
“Dr...Draco.” I eventually get out. He looks at me then and he crumbles. I can tell the exact moment his defences lower and we fall into each other.
I flush scarlet, and seeing Pansy sitting with Theo, it occurs to me suddenly that the only reason Harry invited me was because Pansy is here. Theo probably freely and happily asked Pansy to meet his parents. Harry was trapped - knowing that I would have found out via Pansy. I frown at the thought. He’s been forced into the invitation. The realisation is bleak and depressing.
“Oh and I also put the swing up on the tree in the front, just like you wanted.” She smiles and then looks startled as Draco hugs her too.
I shake my head at him and frown sadly. I need to get out of here. He doesn’t want me and I don’t know what I was thinking. Why would Harry Potter want me? I wrap my arms around myself and quickly head up to the main doors. I can feel him behind me and when I’m at the doors I turn to face him but can’t look him in the eye.
My mother is oozing contradiction, desperately sorry not to make my graduation. Father has some illness or another, there’s always something with him. Honestly, I don’t think I’ve been in the same room as him for at least 2 years. My mother rattles on about him making a full recovery, but in the meantime he’s resting up, and my mother has to wait on him hand and foot. I don't know why she still puts up with this bullshit. I suppose she loves him - Merlin knows why.
and this does strange delicious things to my insides. Not one of his fifteen, not Pansy in her little bikinis, not evil Mrs Robinson. Me. This beautiful man wants me. He stops kissing me, and opening my eyes, I find him gazing down at me.
It’s hard to be around him at the moment. It's hard to be around anyone. Everyone is moving on and rebuilding, but I can’t. So many good people died in that stupid war and it’s not fair that I got to live.
“Ermm—we’d like to go ahead with the photo shoot for the article.” I remember to breathe and try to calm my beating heart. “Tomorrow if that’s still okay? Is here, at Hogwarts, a convenience for you?”
I look down then and realise I’m only in my T-shirt and boxers. I don’t remember anything after seeing Pansy. Shit, what the fuck happened last night. I get up slowly and sit on the end of the bed with the covers still over me. This is when I notice the water and tablets on the bedside table. I take the tablets immediately and finish the rest of the water. I start feeling better already and think I just needed a drink.
“Mr malfoy?” Draco stands up then. “If you’d like to follow me, healer Bell is ready to see you.” They both start walking away and I just sit there. Draco hasn’t asked me to come with him and I haven’t asked to be in there today, so I should just wait here.
For some reason I bring everything back out to the bar and start cutting the tomatoes. My fingers are trembling and I can feel his hot gaze on me. I don’t dare look up, I may end up cutting my finger off.
“Are you smirking at me, Mr Malfoy?” He looks amused but it's hard to tell. He tilts his head to one side. I flush at his tone and look down. I can't look at him when he talks like that.
“Yeah. It’s just these stupid hormones are going crazy. It doesn’t help with a baby sat on my knee.” He starts crying then and I don’t know what to do. He never cries in front of people, what if they work out he’s pregnant, or think I've upset him.
6    Everything in this contract must be read and interpreted in the light of the fundamental purpose and the fundamental terms set out in clause 2-5 above.
After nearly an hour of pushing we hear a cry. The baby has been born. Hermione is crying and laughing and kissing my hand.
I notice now that he’s wearing PJ pants. He runs his fingers through his hair and stands. His pants hang from his hips, in that way….holy hell. My mouth goes dry as he casually strolls around the piano towards me. He has broad shoulders, narrow hips, and his abdominal muscles ripple as he walks. He really is stunning.
I’m refreshed but suddenly nervous. Holy shit, I am meeting his parents! He’s just worked me over with a riding crop and tied me up using a cable tie, for fucks sake - and I’m going to meet his parents. It will be Pansy’s first time meeting them, too - at least she’ll be there for support. I roll my shoulders. They’re stiff. His demands for a personal trainer don't seem so outlandish now. In fact, it’s mandatory if I am to have any hope of keeping up with him.
“Ohhh.” She says as everything clicks. “Oh Harry I’m sorry. Why did he leave? He can't possibly think it's your fault?”
“No he won’t, he’s fine here.” She says coolly to the healer. “Don’t you dare leave me!” She hisses at me then and holds my hand for dear life.
“I’m going to have a feel inside okay?” She asks and Draco nods and squeezes my hand slightly when Katie starts. He makes a face of discomfort and then it’s done. “Well you are about 9 cm dilated, but the baby isn’t down far enough yet. I think we have another few hours yet. Do you wanna try walking around? It may get the baby down where he’s supposed to be.” Draco sighs at the time he has left and then nods. I help him get up and he holds on to me while we walk around the room.
“Oh yeah.” We were both laughing quite hard now and all I felt was love for this man. This man who was the most unlikeliest of men to fall for. But I fell hard and I don’t think I could ever stop loving him. With that thought I made a plan and apparated to grimmauld place with my lover.
“I’m really starting to worry now Draco, you're scaring me. What is going on? Is it the house? If you really don’t like it, I will sell it.”
Draco is carrying Leo in his wrap rather than get the pram across the cemetery. He holds my hand and we go over to my parents grave. Draco kneels first and I follow his lead. There are fresh flowers on the grave and a card. I pick it up and read it with Draco reading over my shoulder. It reads:
“I came here to tell you that I will come with you Harry. As long as I’m with you, I don't care what people think. I love you so much.” We kiss again and I drag him inside and up the stairs.
“She said it's about 9 weeks old and about the size of a cherry right now.” He gave the tiniest giggle to that, only noticeable because I felt him laugh against me.
The next day Teddy comes to the house to see us. I’m downstairs in the front room, having just arrived back through the floo with some more boxes from the manor. I’m getting all of Draco’s boxes first and then mine, then I’ll start unpacking.
“There will definitely be a ring my love, but for now the necklace will have to do.” I take it out and show him the back, which makes him cry again. We kiss long and slow, and Draco doesn’t get dressed the whole night.
“Draco, it's okay. Just breath. Feel my hand? I’m here. Everything’s okay.” Katie must pick up on what’s happening because she jumps into action.
Bloody hell….why is he so worried about my broom? It has given me 10 years of loyal service, and Blaise has always been on hand to maintain it for me. Harry’s next email is from today.
“Yes. I would like to spend some time here.” He says but he isn’t looking at the library or the shelf’s or even the book in his hand, he is looking at me and is smiling. I smile back and then clear my throat.
“I don’t know. Just holding Lucy has brought all these questions to my mind.” He’s calmed down enough now to sound normal ish but he is still crying.
“What’s going on? Is everything okay?” Then her eyes widen and she bounces down the rest of the stairs. “Is he in labour?!” I shush her.
“Where’s your man Harry?” Says George. Good question, where was Draco? He said he was coming. I sit down next to Luna across from George and begin chatting.
I walk in and go to the front desk where I am welcomed by a very attractive young man. He’s sharply dressed and well groomed. He looked up and smiled politely at me.
“Draco, what’s this about? You looked excited about it at mungos.” He sighs and looks down at our joined hands.
Hold on, I was meant to be the one interviewing him, not the other way around. His eyes burn into me and I feel compelled to tell the truth.
“Draco!” He can clearly hear me but is stubbornly ignoring me. “Draco, wait please. Draco!” I catch up and attempt to grab his arm to turn him but he flings it out of my grip and turns with a look of murder.
“Yes, he just got a bit of a poorly stomach at the moment but the healers have said he’s fine.” I tell them both but so that Teddy can understand.
“Hold your hands together in front of you.” he orders as he peels the towel off me and throws it on the floor.
The hall fills quickly, and the buzz of excited voices get louder and louder. The row of seats in front fills. On either side of me, I am joined by two girls whom I don't know from a different department. They’re obviously close friends and talk across me excitedly.
“It would be if Ron could be on time for once!” Hermione says angrily and folds her arms. Her belly is so much smaller than Draco’s even though she is 6 weeks ahead of us.
“Yeah I know, uncle Harry told me. But why? Everyone is always happy when there is a new baby coming.”
At 10 o’clock exactly he has just finished another contraction. He collapses back against me and turns his head into my neck.
“Then you have me.” She snorts then hisses in pain with another contraction. “I’m going to leave Draco a note and then we are getting you to st mungos.” She nods and I go to find parchment and quill.
“Oh, come on, Dray. Even you cannot be immune to his looks. Unless….are you not really gay?” She asks in mocking shock. I throw a pill at her and she laughs.
“Draco don’t! What the fuck am I going to do for 2 weeks with him. He’s been here 5 minutes. How am I going to go to work tomorrow and leave him in my house.” We get to the bathroom and Draco starts looking for the right ointment.
“That’s just because of the hole, that the baby is going to come through, it’s opening up and dialating. Katie told me all about it.” He says slowly. He looks pale and is sweating a lot.
“I’m sure he’ll be better when we tell him about those horses we are going to get.” I say cheerfully trying to get a smile out of him.
“Sometimes I still don’t think this is real.” I say in a half whispered voice. “Sometimes I think I’m going to wake up in that closet at 10 years and this was all a dream.” I start tearing up and so does Hermione by the looks of it. She squeezes my arm and gives me a sad smile. Then to my surprise, it’s Ron who speaks up.
“Hello baby, I’m Nia. You daddies are very nice people, so be good.” I chuckle and tell her his name. “Leo, we are going to be best buds. I’ll babysit you all the time.”
“No Draco, it's fine. You can’t watch over me all the time and if you want to leave one day then you can’t think all about me, you need to think of yourself.”
“Why didn’t you tell me the appointment was with her. I told you my past was coming back.” He’s starting to get a bit hysterical now and I’m frightened he might have a panic attack.
At 4 o’clock I’m in bed with Draco. He’s between my legs and says he feels comfortable, so I've stayed like this for the last 2 hours. His contractions are getting closer now and I’ve started timing them on a stopwatch. He grabs my hand again and moans.
“Master Harry sir.” He bows at me and then carries on. “Master Harry is meant to be seeing Master Draco sir. Master Harry told Kreacher he was leavings at 6 and Kreacher sees it’s nearly time, yet Master Harry is not ready.” I finally click on to what he's saying and look at my watch. He’s right! It's 5:45 and I’ve not had a shower or anything. Shit!
He grins at me and eases the car out of the parking space and onto the road. I reach into the glove box and retrieve the baseball caps. I pass him a cap, and he puts it on. I take my hair out of the messy bun and put the cap on.
And with that Harry puts the phone down. No goodbye or thanks or anything. Rude. I’m glad I didn’t even think about working for him. He’s just too controlling and cold with his employees. I shiver at the thought.
“Tonight?” He raises his eyebrow and I flush. Can he read my mind? Does he know Legilimency? No! Besides, my occlumency is too good. Severus has been teaching me occlumency since I started at Hogwarts. Anyway, I can’t feel Potter’s presence in my mind. Phew. I take a breath.
“I’d like to say cheers to Harry.” Nia stands up then and holds up her drink. “For deciding that his fate is to teach people like me, from home. And for finally quitting the aurors indefinitely. No offence Ron.” She whispers that end bit and everyone raises their glasses and claps for me.
I shake my head. “I don’t know what you mean.” My voice is hoarse. I hardly recognise it, laced with desire.
“And you’re seriously discussing what I want to do, when you have no experience.” His brows knit together. “How have you avoided sex? Tell me, please.”
“Oh, it’s only on loan. He wanted me to try it out.” My excuse sounds feeble. But Pansy nods her assent.
“Harry! Draco! Teddy! Hello dears. Everyone’s outside, we are just waiting on Ginny and Luna as usual.” She chuckles and shows us outside.
“Draco. My name’s Draco.” I mutter at him. “What can I get you, Mr Potter?” He smiles that inside joke smile again and I take a breath. I can do this.
“No.” He shakes his head and his unruly curls bounce on his head. He frowns and looks like he is recalling something uncomfortable. “Sleeping with someone.” He picks up his newspaper and continues to read….and pretend I’m not there anymore.
“Yes well it won't be nice if it gets cold, so eat up.” He says changing the subject but I’m not buying it this time, it was really sweet of him to do this.
I am engrossed in my book, but then the bell on the door chimes and I look up. I nearly choke on my bagel when my eyes meet with the bold green eyes of Harry Potter, who’s heading towards the bar.
“Draco!” I shout at him. “Sorry ‘mione, he’s been acting strange today. I’ll go have a word.” I hand Rose back and go towards Draco, against the shouts of Hermione that ‘it’s quite alright’.
Andrew hesitates, gaping at him. He looks lost. Potter turns his head to look at her and lifts his eyebrow. He blushes at this. Thank Merlin, it’s not just me.

“Do you wanna sleep at grimmauld tonight with me and uncle Draco?” He shoots awake at that and grins.
I sit down and look out the glass wall to the view of the city. I am shocked and the view is breathtaking. Wow. I saw it when I was on my broom but I was really looking, too busy concentrating on where I was going. I take a moment to stare at the beauty and then go into my bag and fetch Pansy’s questions. I don’t take them all the way out of the bag because they are on parchment and the two blondes at the desk could be muggles. I groan inwardly and curse her for not giving me at least a brief biography on this guy and his company. I don’t know anything about him. He could be ninety years old for all I know.
“He ate it.” I tell him with a raised eyebrow. He can’t convince me that this cat is a good boy. He opens his mouth but nothing comes out. I smirk at him and pull him towards the kitchen. “Tea?”
“Congratulations!” She says and puts the baby on Draco’s chest. He’s crying again now but tears of joy. And just seeing them two makes me start welling up.
I hang on to his hips as I’m tipped upside down, and he strides purposefully in the moonlight across the lawn.
“Please, Blaise?” I ask as I shut the door to mine and Pansy’s room. I sulk and slump down onto the sofa.
7    The Dominant shall take responsibility for the well-being and the proper training, guidance, and discipline of the Submissive. He shall decide the nature of such training, guidance, and discipline and the time and place of its administration, subject to the agreed terms, limitations, and the safety procedures set out in this contract or agreed additionally under clause 3 above.
“Who’s that then?” Hagrid shouts and opens the door. He looks down at me, just like I had with flitwick, and a great big smile covers his face.
We have been walking for a bit and we come to an opening. In the middle is an old, but clean, looking motorbike. It's big and black and I don’t understand. This isn’t flying. It will take us all night to get to London on that thing.
“How is Mr Malfoy? I was so glad to hear about you two, you were always staring at each other.” I go slightly red now and try not to groan and instead laugh nervously.
“Yes thank you Teddy, you’ve sang that 3 times today already.” He laughs and kisses the top of my head. That makes me chuckle because it’s usually the other way around.
“Pansy, I don't want to talk over the phone.” Harry is standing at the door, watching me. I glance at him and he turns and goes back to the kitchen.
Please him! He wants me to please him! I think my mouth actually drops open. Please Harry Potter. And in that moment I realise that yes, that’s exactly what I want to do. I want him to be fucking delighted with me. It’s a revelation.
“I’m just wearing my jeans and a hoodie. Yeah you look nice in that, wear that.” At that he pauses and frowns at me.
He moves forward. instinctively,I move back until I feel the bed against the back of my knees. He drops his towel, but I can’t take my eyes off his face. His expression is ardent, full of desire.
“Oh great so I’ll be working hard all day and then come home to a usually peaceful house, just to be greeted by that pest.” Draco chuckled and shook his head at that.
“I’m going to have a shower. Unless you want one first?” He asks with his head to the side, still grinning. My heartbeat pulses and my cheeks flush. He grins even wider at this and strokes his long fingers across my cheek and over my bottom lips. I stop breathing.
Suddenly, it’s like we’re on our own in the room. Just the two of us. My whole body has come alive, every nerve ending singing softly, that electricity pulling me to him, charging between us.
“If you aren’t down those stairs by the time I get down there, then there will be trouble.” He says and then storms off.
Hmmm...he’s hard and soft at once, like steel encased in velvet, and surprisingly tasty - salty and smooth.
“What a pleasure to meet you.” she murmurs. If I’m not mistaken, there is wonder and maybe stunned relief in her voice and a warm glow in her green eyes. Her eyes almost look the same as Harry’s, but Harry’s eyes are brighter, and Lily’s are lighter. After all, they are not biologically related.
“No, Sev, I’m good. It’s been so great to see you. I’ll visit real soon once I’m settled in London.”
“Well, it was, though I didn’t see her all the time. It was….difficult. After all, I was still at school and then uni. Eat up, Draco.”
“It’s a completely over-the-top gift. I can’t accept it, especially now.” I grin at Pansy, and she nods.
“We’re sure Teddy. Do you want to see the scan?” I ask him and sit back down next to Draco. Andy follows me over and takes Draco into a hug.
We glide around the room, over to the piano, and backward and forward in front of the window, London outside, a dark and magical mural to our dance. I can’t help my carefree laugh. He grins down at me as the song comes to a close.
“Right, get down here now. I am not getting stabbed by a looney muggle while you're up there messing about.” He may be using humour but i could tell he was a bit freaked out. I stepped back and must have caught my foot because a sheet moved and revealed a few twigs. I bent down and took the sheet off altogether, and there underneath was a broom, an old looking one but still a broom. Maybe it wasn’t a muggle living here. I really needed to get back to Draco, and fast. Just as I was turning to leave, I saw a little glint of silver. When I looked over I saw a name on a tag. Just one name and a familiar one. Nia.
