Draco took the spare chair and poured himself the last of Harry’s tea. Bugger. He hadn’t got to drink a single cup of that. Another tea-in-first sort of bloke, although Harry’d known that in first year. Weird.
So that’s why he thinks it’s a perfectly reasonable idea to jump from behind the table, flinging curses in every direction, watching wizards and goblins alike fall on impact, and only putting up a cursory Protego when he sees the slicing spell coming at him.
firmly in place. Spells are so thick around Narcissa Malfoy that Harry can’t see her form or make out her face or catch the timbre of her voice. Even Draco wouldn’t be able to recognize her, despite the blood magic that they’ve all used.
There were three clicks and Harry saw three red, blinking lights turn on, on three magicamcorders. Luna stepped back, out of the line of sight. Javier and Miles, mounted on brooms, prepared to follow Harry, whatever his choice.
Draco’s eyes were fixed on the scene before them, which, now that Mr Weasley and Ginny had entered, resembled an attack of redheaded piranhas over a bushy-haired chicken bone.
on him again. God, how was it that he always ruined things for himself? Things like Draco maybe going down on him. Draco’s hands began a slow, delicate trail up and down Harry’s thighs.
Draco nodded, frowning as he stared into the middle distance. “I don’t understand the block,” he said. “Learning is fluid. One little messed up Obliviation should not have caused such long-term effects.”
“Harry,” she murmured, her eyes flicking back and forth as she studied his face. He shrugged in response. “I’m not a real choice.”
Malfoy stared at him while Harry’s face got progressively redder. “Never?” he whispered. Harry shook his head. “What do you need?”
. For Draco. For his mother. Mostly, for himself. Because he will get what he wants in the worst possible way. He will love Draco and he will have Draco, but they could be actors, casted in hidden roles without even knowing it. The bond will make him forget he cares about this. The bond will make his love real even if it isn’t.
And when Malfoy smiled at him, it was the worst thing in the world. There was no way Harry would ever be able to move past this one time, when, for a moment, he’d been the only thing on Malfoy’s mind, and it’d been a
Harry scrubs at his face. He’s not going to cry. He’s lived—and died—through worse than this. “But what if we did anyway?” he finally says, looking up and meeting Draco’s eyes. They’re so clear to him, even now, even at this distance. He can see them in his mind’s eye as close as they’d been when Draco leaned into him, panting his name, their bodies undulating together. It was not so long ago. But it feels that way, and truth is not subject to reality.
Her kits cuddle into her, little bright white blotches against laboured-grey breathing, sharing their warmth even as they drink from her. Harry stands in the doorway, stunned, thoughtful.
“The MUS can go fuck itself,” said Draco, who was well past indignation and into contempt where the Americans’ political choices lay. “We just have to be very careful. That Obliviator sold his story to the
“Harry,” he called. Harry Henry grinned, sauntering up to take the final Snitch from Harry. Harry was determined to get rid of Harry in the next city because there was absolutely no fucking way in hell that he would date a man with the same name as him. The papers would have a fucking field day.
“We’d probably have enough power to hide the Earth,” Malfoy said, somewhat grudgingly. He looked up, eyes sharp, and added, “But we don’t. And we don’t have a hundred years to go breed with Muggles, so what do you suggest instead?”
He’s been married ninety-six years and estranged for eighty-nine and it’s been seventeen seconds since he spoke to his husband. He is frozen there, unsure. Draco’s eyes flick away, uncomfortable even after all this time.
“There’ve already been a number of interested eyes on his bum since the divorce was announced in the papers,” Yaxley spoke up, proving he’d been listening the whole time. Those people were all the same.
“Like Polyjuice,” Harry said, still staring at Draco. He’d been unable to look away, in fact. “I need your hair.”
“I see you’ve wrangled that burner into submission, Mr Potter. Good show, good show. That desk’s always been finicky on Wednesdays.”
Draco shrugs in response, bringing Twin One up to his chest and holding her tightly. Twin Two starts making tiny little baby whimpers and Harry then proceeds to ignore everyone else in the room so he can properly freak out.
“We’d never work,” Harry said, swallowing. He looked north again, wishing Hermione was here with him for this, or, even better, that he could just go home without having to say it. “You needed the prize money more than she did, but I can’t trust you. I guess I never could.”
“It took St Mungo’s five minutes to set it,” Ron says. “You could’ve popped over and then come into work.”
Harry inhales seawater and chokes, his lungs burning. Draco’s sinking fast and why isn’t he swimming? He surges downward, grabbing Draco around the waist and kicking hard to break the surface. A piece of cement ricochets into his head and he sees stars. He feels drowsy, begins to sink, his grip on Draco loosening, and then he forces his head clear again. This is his healer; a warrior never lets his healer die.
Harry nodded, and before he could say goodbye, she and her Ravenclaws were gone. They were always making plans to meet
She stopped talking. Harry could see her shaky exhale all the way from his seat. The crowd was leaning forward, waiting like the magic.
Ginny gave him one of her oversized Harpies tees to wear once he was done and he slipped it on gratefully, having not even realised how cold he was until he wasn’t anymore. Ms Danger trotted out fully visible then, her eyes back to brown and her fur red and white and wavy. Fleur, who’d never seen her visible, and Hannah and Pansy who’d never seen her at all, cooed appropriately over her beautiful features and her brave rescue.
“I’m Muggleborn,” said Mr Lao, by way of explanation. “I don’t know that I believed in them, but I certainly heard stories.” He glanced at the being on the table, shaking his head. “They look almost exactly like all the reports of sightings through the years. Seeing one here now, it’s so clear that they’ve always been here. We just never believed in what we didn’t want to see.”
Harry’s heartbeat intensified; his breath quickened. He spun around, seeing the circle illuminating the trees and sky. Eloise took his hands and laughed happily, spinning him around. He stumbled into Luna, who had flowers in her hair and starlight in her eyes. She kissed him on the cheek and took Draco’s hands to dance him away. Anthony Goldstein looked as awestruck as Harry felt. He stood still as everyone jumped and danced around him. Harry was passed to Fayth Walliams, to Mandy Brocklehurst, to Alick and Ernie, and dozens of people whose names he didn’t even know.
Hermione nodded, taking all of this down in her notebook. “So,” she said, looking up again. “Have you thought about a theme?”
So did the pull at the centre of his eyebrows, a constant line of worry that you couldn’t really see until you got this close, sat right across from him at the staff table. Harry didn’t know where Malfoy’d fucked off to for the last seven years, but he did know he’d taken his and Astoria’s son with him for all it. She’d come to Hogwarts only months after their divorce, pregnant, while Malfoy was still globetrotting.
Hermione made a disgusted face. “I am so glad I wasn’t at that tragic representation of human error. I honestly have second-hand embarrassment for all of you who went.” She caught Harry’s look and sighed. “All right, I was deflecting a little bit. I’ve…been contracted by the ICW. To develop a global
“Would you spend some time with Draco?” Hermione continues blithely. “Maybe there could be something there, and if we use that as a lever against the bond, with me and Ron also levering our marriage—well, you’re both into men, and both fit and healthy, good careers… well, Apex wouldn’t like the inter-department romance, but she may come around… and there’s always been something between you, even in school. If you can work with it, maybe it could turn into attraction—”
Late September in the highlands was cool, and the wind coming off of the Black Lake kept a steady flow of chilly air against all their faces. He was glad Ashwood had told him to wear it. Seeing all of these people out here, his new housemates, with the wind pushing their cloaks outwards, away from Hogwarts, he could see their futures beginning: the Hufflepuffs dispersing from their lives here, into the adult world, and yet somehow all still going in the same direction. It was not something he’d ever felt in Gryffindor. And looking around at the other re-sorted seventh and eighth years, he would wager it had not been felt in Ravenclaw or Slytherin, either.
“No creative streak, unfortunately.” Unless one counted the disturbing Malfoyish scenarios he’d entertained since seeing Hermione’s
“‘People,’” Millicent repeated, lip curling. “I know they created us, but I still don’t like calling them people.”
It would work better if they had a triad or a quad to cast the spell, as the Queen and her Council had originally composed, but Draco would work with what he had. And what he had was himself and Potter.
Right now, and for the past three weeks, for example, Harry has been terrified of scaring Draco off by accidentally bursting out with,
Harry bumped his shoulder to Draco’s, thinking a little human interaction would help to bring himself out of his sombre reverie. When Draco looked at him, Harry saw the same discomfort he was feeling in Draco’s reflected gaze. He didn’t know what made him want so badly to comfort Draco, but maybe it was the desire to lessen some of the old devastation he knew Draco must be feeling. This was a happy thing he had with Hufflepuff; it was a beautiful thing. They had to look forward, not backward. They had to save themselves.
Malfoy snorts and turns away. Harry follows him into a bright kitchen with floor-to-ceiling windows looking out onto the Mediterranean.
Harry had not been sure, at the time of his hire, if Minerva put him up there for his protection or everyone else’s. Maybe it was neither—maybe he needed the space to practice those wild, ancient spells he would teach the students this year. Whenever Malfoy casted, the air went all cold and fresh like eucalyptus, and he dragged that scent around with him for hours afterwards. Which of course Harry noticed.
They all settled in at Andromeda’s large kitchen table, with glasses of wine for the adults and rhubarb juice for Teddy, as that’s what goblins drank in winter so it was therefore what Teddy drank in winter.
Harry was in turn introduced to Atlas, Nero, Claudius, Finian, Quill, Martin, Harry Henry (Harry’s life: more mortifying by the moment), Phoenix, Socorro, Felix, Byron, Gregorious, Jesse, Titus, Raul, Gardner, Jake, and Heathcliff. By the grace of Merlin, there was only one contender left to arrive. Harry stared up at the bridge, waiting for the wizard to remove his Disillusionment charm and fly his arse down so they could all get inside, Harry could throw back several beers, and they would be that much closer to the end.
The anemones curled around his ankles. Harry whined. He couldn't take it anymore. He took his cock in hand and began jerking himself off, but he’d not even settled into a good rhythm before Draco was batting his hand away. Harry could’ve cried.
She flicked her ears, flicking Severia off in the process. Malfoy’s eyebrows went up. “And did you panic? Forget what it felt like to be a human?” She huffed.
Harry nuzzles his nose into Draco’s neck, inhaling the delicious masculine scent of him. “Yeah, babe. Anything you want. Just come down to the kitchen with me.”
“They want clean water,” Harry said, rolling his eyes. “But you’d think they could ask for that without, you know, trying to drown a Muggle kayaker. We’ll have to make some water purifying potions and dump a whole vat in the bay.”
“Fuck, Malfoy it’s always about the prize money with you, isn’t it?” Harry said. He picked up Malfoy’s shirt, the same shirt that, coming off, had completely undone Harry. He threw it at him.
Their eyes held again, then Draco moved to lean against the wall by Harry. Their shoulders brushed, and Harry was becoming quite used to the feeling. Between this and sitting too close at Sunday fantasy Quidditch meet-ups, and twirls around the common room when one of their players was magnificent, Harry was becoming quite accustomed to the heat of Malfoy’s body next to his own.
“They do,” Granger agreed, “But Muggle governments don’t share everything they learn about foreign nations with civilians. In fact, Ms Thatchery,” she said, turning to the woman who’d given Draco and Potter a dirty look, “Doesn’t the Ministry already have our Muggle Liaison Officers working with MI5, MI6, and the Royal Navy?”
The magic came slowly. It happened while the UMN was still in deliberations over the verdict for the protesting Obliviator, Prius O’Dell. The MUS was sending more stringent sanctions through their Senate when the first set of new Muggleborns quite literally popped up in late January. An entire class of twelve Kindergarteners in rural Hampshire began levitating above their desks after having fizzy drinks during a class party. Their teacher managed to snap a picture and it ran for three days straight in the local and national papers.
Harry’s eyebrows lifted. “You know Potions is no comparison to chemistry,” he said, “and I’m rubbish at it anyway.”
“Don’t be a bore, Harry,” said Dudley, followed by a quick, “Oi! Peterson, get back on the path and quit faffing about! This isn’t a holiday!”
“The point is,” Millicent added, “it’s safer for you to go make a spectacle of yourself than it is to go somewhere they can snatch you up and we’d never hear from you again. And everyone knows your name now—I showed my alien to the reporters and said they’d taken you. People will want to know if you’ve come back.”
“You see that?” Harry said to Hermione. It was one of the nights she’d stayed to eat dinner with him instead of rushing off with the other Ravenclaws. They usually invited Ron over, too, but he hadn’t shown for dinner yet. Hermione stopped talking and followed his gaze. Her mouth curved into a thoughtful frown.
Harry fought down a flush with an arcane strength he’d not known he possessed. “Yes, Professor, sorry.” He could bloody
“Aren’t we?” she asked, one eyebrow up. “Draco’s family. And you and he… well, it’s very plain to see.”
This seemed to bother her not at all. She curled up in his arms and promptly began purring. Harry sighed, summoned his potions notes and other things he didn’t trust to leave in a classroom overnight, and set off for his lab. He stuffed her in his cauldron for better carrying, and of course, she was okay with that, too.
Harry nods. He can still feel the ghostly presence of Malfoy’s come on his face, even if it’s all been Vanished away. He wants to feel it again.
“You’re going to Hogwarts!” he agreed, snatching her up and spinning her around before depositing her, dizzy, back on the ground. He gave Ron and Hermione a sideways smile, and then stepped back to chat with Ron while Hermione read Rosie a list of requirements for her first year at Hogwarts, to include studying hard, not taking any nonsense from boys or other girls, being respectful to all of her professors, thinking for herself, and being sure to write.
Harry nodded. The second batch of post owls arrived, carrying the deliveries from Muggle areas and further wizarding locales. The
“So,” Draco said, on a sigh, “We need to figure out how to do two things: one—remove the piece of the spell that takes the object in question out of time and space for a period of time, and two—make it work for the whole planet.”
Potter, meanwhile, was rushing around his rooms gathering books, papers, a Muggle laptop, a plushie from his son’s room, and tossing clothes onto his sofa. Draco took the opportunity to remove the Scottie landscape from his hearth and shrink it down.
Harry nods to confirm this when Healer Gaelan looks uncomfortably in his direction. “I used to fight against it, but now I just accept it.” He scoots his chair closer to the bed, and takes up Draco’s hand, interlacing their fingers. “Thanks for the freebie, babe.”
Harry nodded. The train began to pull away, and Teddy and Rosie’s waves became more and more enthusiastic. Hermione let out a little sob, smiling through her tears as she waved and called, ‘I love you! Be good!’ to Rosie.
More importantly, he got to see Draco at each one of them. And at each one of them, it became harder and harder to walk away from him at the end of the night. There was no going back for Harry anymore. He really wished he knew whether it was the same for Draco.
Malfoy was still looking at him oddly, and Harry took a breath as the weight of all his feelings he’d been avoiding thinking came crashing into him. He liked being around Malfoy. He liked working with Malfoy. He liked drinking brandy with Malfoy and saving the world with Malfoy, and he didn't want him to
Harry sighed. “Both me and Tracey felt it in our stomachs,” he said. “Is it centred there? Is it like a soul?”
After dinner, they grabbed some groceries (i.e., beer and crisps) from the Whole Foods and walked back to their terrace. Lee had indeed left with Madison’s phone number—and her agreement to go out to dinner with him on the weekend. Then Hermione had remembered that they were supposed to tip in the US, and Lee ran back to give her more cash than was probably customary.
“How’ve you never been fucked before if you can only get off like this?” asked Malfoy, slowly resuming his strokes.
Once he and Potter had copied down the spell, checked it four times for transcription and typographical errors, and made three copies, they herded Albus and Scorpius from the room and headed back to Potter’s to get to work.
Draco nodded. If he stopped, rested his mind, he could hear the echos of the sea above, water sloshing overhead, eroding the stone into soft, smooth gullies. The guards flanked the room’s only entrance, spears ready. They would know if the ICW caught wind of their online crowdsourcing event, but Draco wasn’t entirely confident the guards could hold off ICW wizards forever. This tense stalemate they’d been engaged in with Atlantis since their presser was near to breaking. It wouldn’t take much provocation for the ICW to decide it wasn’t worth keeping peace with Atlantis after all. He hoped they could protect them if the aliens found them first.
“Cheers,” Harry echoed, and took a swig. It burned. It tasted like fiery cranberry. It was amazing. They settled into an easy camaraderie there in the corner, ragging on the other seventh and eighth years in attendance, and for a while, Harry liked it.
“Well, not really,” said Harry. “I mean, they did transmute a really tiny bit of gold a few times, but it was radioactive, and I think it decayed back into mercury or something anyway.”
It’s stronger now, of course. In a way, destroying his own house is the only way he’ll see Draco’s face right now. The only way he’ll get Draco to smile at him again. It almost doesn’t even matter that he sees himself
“Either because I specialise in water habitats,” Harry said, “Or they wanted me out of the country.”
Harry nods. He looks at Shaadhon and wonders how he’s going to impart the need to find a patch of explosive magic, but Shaadhon just stares at him and then nods his feelers again. He takes off for the docks, and Harry chases after him. He catches up with Draco at the retaining wall, nearly running into him as Shaadhon barrels past. Draco’s staring transfixed at the supports of the docks before them. Shaad twines around all the pillars, eyes rolling like a spooked horse, making demonic little whistling breaths.
He’d inflected his voice like Snape’s, to mock Harry, and how he’d unconsciously picked up that trait since last spring. It went straight to Harry’s trousers. Which was really the last thing he needed. But he tossed a quill at Draco and laughed, and pulled his legs up on the chair like he was getting cosy, and no one had to know.
“She’ll say yes,” said Anthony. He was reading a book on forgotten princesses of Sub Saharan Africa. His interests had, obviously, expanded beyond Eastern Europe.
‘Slytherin!’ called the Hat, and Harry frowned. Maybe he should’ve guessed that. She gave him a little smile as she hopped down from the dais and went to join a gaggle of Hufflepuffs and the spare Ravenclaw at Slytherin.
Outside, a woman screams, and Harry makes the mistake of turning to see what’s wrong. Nothing’s wrong, as it happens. He’s just been spotted again. It’s always bad during Fashion Week. Everyone wants to be a model. He doesn’t
“Draco,” Harry said warningly, but he was trying not to laugh. “You have to be polite to me in public.”
Harry’s sure he makes some small dying sound in that moment. How is it that his voice won’t work when he needs to ask if there’s a public loo, but the moment Draco kisses another man while Harry hides in his living room, he apparently can’t help himself from making noise? It’s not fair, he’s been agonising over the lack of his voice for months and now Draco is kissing someone who isn’t him, someone who can’t have loved him for seven years and liked him relatively well for another one in eighth year, someone who really, legitimately, has no reason to live when Draco’s not part of that life.
Draco’s fingers tightened around his own. “I’m not ready to lose my magic, either. I’d rather adjust to Muggleborns charming telephones to work with magic than I would adjust to having to use the Muggle version because Floos don’t work.”
“Yes,” said Draco. “Magic is with everyone, even those who don’t have the ability to use it. Your body knows your history, even if you don’t.”
Dudley smirked. Draco caught Millicent watching him fondly and felt unaccountably sad that they’d dragged her and Granger into this.
“Two ounces,” Snape suggested. “I am not certain, but given that you’ve used one-half litre of base and the stone looks as though it will displace about 30 millilitres of water, that is the amount I would use. Add it slowly.”
Millicent frowned, didn’t bother continuing on with that argument. “So how are we going to get Dudley back from these
Harry grabs his hand and begins tugging him towards the basement stairs. “Olive oil,” he says. “And that big table,” he adds, piecing together a plan even as they begin to descend. “And then you naked for the next three or four hours. Maybe more.”
He put the Stone away and moved to lay down on the bed next to Draco. Harry curled himself around Draco’s body, and sighed in relief when Draco’s fingers came up to card through his hair. He closed his eyes and breathed in Draco’s scent as the voices downstairs erupted in cheers. Mr Weasley drunkenly began a rousing rendition of
They made back to the castle, panting and laughing, and Harry had never felt more alive than he did in that moment. Despite the shit they had coming, despite the entire world being a living horror film, Harry had, for the first time, something that made it all worth it. He was still baffled and amazed that something was Malfoy.
Harry jumped up, and, noticing the disarray of his sitting room, sent everything back to its place with a few pointed gestures and annoyed looks. Draco watched him, and it occurred to Harry that it was the wandless magic again. Maybe he hadn’t forgotten how to do it. He’d only wanted to keep trying for Draco, after all.
“I do,” Harry admits. He reaches down and pulls at his prick a few times, unable to help himself even if he wanted to. Malfoy bats his hand away. “
Teddy beamed. “He’s the one who recommended Mr Durjtak for my Gobbledegook lessons. They’re related.”
They shared another speaking look. Ron was the first to look away. Harry bent down to gather more false morels.
Somehow, they’d lost all of the other first through sixth year Hufflepuffs over the course of dinner. Harry hadn’t even noticed it happening; one moment, their table was full, and the next it was just the newly sorted Hufflepuffs and two bleak-looking sixth year prefects.
“It was—peculiar,” he agreed, lamely. “It seemed really simple compared to everything else he’s given us.”
“Me, too,” said Harry. Merlin, did he ever. He’d been raised Muggle and he knew there were plenty of wonderful ones out there. But there were also people like the Dursleys, and the thought of those kinds of people finding out about wizards terrified him. What if giving magic to Muggle children was the end of their history? What if they broke the Statute fully and completely? What if
Harry smirked at Draco. “Now it’s not sounding so bad if I come in second. I like little crème brûlées.”
She let go of him after a narrow-eyed look from Miles and returned to her spot with the others. Harry faced them. “It’s been great getting to know you both,” he said to Harry and Finian. “I wish you the best. And for the rest of you, I’ll see you in Barcelona.”
Draco hates anything on his desk that isn’t a blotter or inkwell, but he’s also in love with Hermione, thus the confused reactions.
Harry inhaled sharply. “I did, yeah. But I don’t know that I could’ve saved myself. It’s a lot harder to think when it’s just yourself who needs saving. The inspiration comes when it’s the person you love.”
Draco gave him a look. “Do you really think a single Muggleborn could have controlled enough natural magic to attach it to anyone, much less an entire family? And besides, who reads up on rituals, besides Hufflepuffs? They’re hardly used anymore.”
“You didn’t even do anything,” Harry said, feeling wretched and abysmal, and that he should’ve done something to stop this travesty after the war, but Ginny’s pregnancy had come on so quickly—she’d been due nine months to the day after the end of the war. And then the...complications, and Harry had just not had the emotional stability to do more than show up for one day of trials, give his testimony for Draco and Narcissa, and return to Grimmauld Place, and Ginny. Ginny, who had taken to spending all her days stuffed up in the dreary library, staring out the window at London’s gloom and refusing to talk about anything. He’d never been so grateful to the Harpies for coming straight to the Burrow and asking after her directly.
The fourth time was indeed the last one. The liquid condensed at the top of the alembic was purer even than distilled water, and a thousand times more precious. Harry separated the shimmering gold-wine sludge of impurities from the crystal clear pure solution and the blood-red stone still sitting at the bottom of the cauldron.
Ron hands him a beer and a bag of curry and Harry grabs it before he can drop it. Ron’s hands shake badly these days and his freckles have turned into blotchy brown spots all over them.
“Christ, I think it does,” said Granger. “But here, it says…” she trailed off, eyes flicking between the papers. Her fingers curled around the edge of the table. She read it through again, her fingers whitening against the wood.
Severus knew more than he was letting on, and wanted to wring it out of him; relieved because Draco was certain both his and Potter’s faces screamed ‘We wanked each other off last night!’ and he didn’t want to have to listen to it from Severus.
He’s been married for ninety-six years and it’s been eighty-nine since he’s spoken to his husband. Something catches in his throat and he struggles to swallow, to breathe. He thinks he might be dying and while he’d prefer it not to be with the indignity of collapsing in a Muggle grocery store, he would welcome the end of it all.
It had to also be noted that while nine times of ten one could gather the purpose of such a business by the name, that was not at all the case with the Whelk Right Inn. Yes, it was an inn, and yes, they did have whelks on the menu (quite good ones, if Harry were consulted), but their open secret was that it was built directly atop a natural hot spring, and a large one at that. The Inn’s Roman bath was, further, tiled in a deep black stone that was reminiscent of basalt, and most importantly, the proprietors were willing to rent out the whole inn to their party for the evening of the Struggle.
“You’ll see here the most recent event,” she said, pointing to a dark blue picture on top. She touched it with her thumb and forefinger, then spread them out on the paper, and the photograph zoomed in. Now, they could clearly see that what was a blur of blue was in fact the wreckage of an ocean liner, spread over the ocean.
“There you are! Sorry I’m late!” Hermione called, rushing up from behind them. They clamped up. She would be supremely disapproving if she heard about Mrs Norris.
“…Which brings us to the task before us,” Kurzschluss said gravely. He didn’t do ‘grave’ well at all. “I’ll open the floor to suggestions on how we can solve this problem. Let’s ideate some solutions while I whiteboard them.”
“Well anti-hex weaves, of course,” said Coddler. “And lately, people have been asking for… ah, Muggle repelling spells.”
That was all Harry thought about the entire way home. He barely registered the heat from Draco’s dry leg pressed against his own in the back seat. They could’ve talked of that bastard Minister again, but they said nothing instead.
Draco pressed his lips together tightly, and Harry dragged him, but they were a long way away from the edge of the diseased area, and then—Draco’s eyes dulled, and he started to twitch, and—
And only then does he allow himself to consider what he’s just done. Eaten a fucking bug. Or half of one, really. Not even a full bug, a baby one, but there’s the added bonus of it not having any antenna or twitchy legs to get stuck in his teeth, and—now that he’s run-on-sentenced himself into a neutral state, Harry considers the actual experience. A bit bacony, actually. And meat’s all the same when it comes down to it, isn’t it? These bugs probably aren’t any dirtier than the factory farms chicken nuggets come from. He bites off the rest of the larva and this time he looks at it as he eats it, acknowledges to himself that he’s licking the taste of bug off a wooden stick when normally, he’d throw out any of the rice with weevils in it.
On Bring Your Child to Work Day, there was a struggle over the rightful ownership of one Edward Remus Lupin, a child of seven years. Though he was the recognised godson of Harry Potter, he was also the recognised heir of his cousin, Draco Malfoy. As Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy were partnered together as Junior Aurors in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and would therefore be, in theory, taking Teddy to the same place, the true owner of the child was unimpressed by the squabbling.
“I didn’t check for cyanide,” Harry admitted. “I didn’t expect that. I need to go back and re-test for the hard chemicals. If there’s cyanide, it’s worse than I thought.”
“She was looking into how Arithmancy could be used to affect the animation of Renaissance portraits. Specifically, those holding passwords. You’ve got a Botticelli on your door. Granger wasn’t talking,” —and here the cat gave a very vocal and unequivocal hiss— “So I disabled the password with her hypothesis equations.”
“What quest?” the female Ministry worker exclaimed in broken Greek. “You are a monarch, not a knight!”
“Toodle-oo,” Harry repeated flatly, as Draco sauntered up to his hearth and delicately pinched a portion of Floo powder from the pink kitten-shaped dish (a gift from Rosie on his twenty-fifth birthday). Draco tossed it in the flames, and then he was gone.
“Right,” Harry said, after a moment. “Then, the next thing we need to do is find a way to coordinate with volunteer Muggles and…and just do the spell.”
They passed through more of the city. Draco squinted; further to the south, beyond the aqueduct and row of windmills, he would swear he saw destroyed buildings, scorch marks and broken walls. There was a shipyard in the far harbour, though several of the ships looked worse for wear.
Harry spent some time being highly visible playing against Mr Weasley on the PlayStation, but Mr Weasley was much better and there was only so much humiliation one man could take. He’d put in his time with the Yule Ball, he rather thought.
“Harry!” Draco yelled. Harry heard his chair scrape back, crash to the floor. There were footsteps and then he was flipped over, Draco was right there leaning over him, his eyes huge. “Harry, you sorry piece of shit, you better not let them take your magic!”
Astoria picked hers up as well, sniffed at it, and frowned. It was some modern citrus blend the house-elves were trying out lately; Draco didn’t blame her for the reaction. “I imagine it must be even more bothersome for you, creating a brand-new class.”
Just then, Scorpius sneaked out of his bedroom with a book in his hand. He popped up next to Draco on the oversized chair and, very importantly, handed him the book.
Everyone cheered. Louder than they’d ever cheered for any of the other six Struggles, louder than they cheered at Quidditch games or races. It was a deafening roar that any nearby Muggles were bound to hear, but no one cared. Harry was screaming himself raw in his excitement. Little sparks of magic kept floating downwards. One landed on Draco’s nose and Harry, lightheaded from the atmospheric magic, leaned forward to kiss it off.
Thick, white ropes of spunk hit Malfoy’s chest and Harry, absurdly, gets a brief flash of inspiration for next year’s summer line. Abstracted white stripes. Very nautical. He doesn’t have time to consider it in further detail before Malfoy’s throwing his head back screaming as he empties his cock inside Harry.
“Should you have a backup plan? You know, you could still go into broom-making without a Potions NEWT.”
“Oh, I can smell the Eggs Benedict from here,” Astoria said happily. “Your elf, Twerky, really makes the best hollandaise in all of England. I dream of them each Sunday night.”
“Sulphur is the spirit,” said Draco. “The spirit we’re aiming for with this operation is gold, thus—” He reached into his pocket and tossed a galleon to Harry. “Gold.”
Harry tried to play off the strange feeling he was getting, the heat he could feel suffusing his face. “How’d you manage the, er, particulars?”
The earth had a circumference of 24,901 miles. If their pledges cleared their minds and let magic travel through them, amplifying and bouncing to the next catalyst, it should take three minutes and fourteen seconds to connect the web.
Ms Danger leapt from the corner and onto the bed in one, strong jump. He heard, rather than saw, her sharp canine teeth clamping down into flesh, and there was an inhuman shriek. But she didn’t stop. Something hot and wet splattered across his face and when it touched his tongue, he tasted sour blood. Ms Danger’s shining blue eyes flashed as she bit down hard and shook her head like a wolf killing prey. The shrieks ratcheted up and then there was a call, a desperate-sounding yell in a language he’d never heard.
If things had been different, Harry thought, if Ron had never had first call on Hermione, he could’ve fallen for her too, maybe. Things would’ve been simpler that way. But things
A snort came from Snape’s portrait, and still, no one seemed to notice he was living, although a few people seated nearest did look around curiously.
The Auror Department was further back, through a maze of bureaucracy that only served to remind Harry of the slog his life had become. There was one bright spot in dragging his arse out of bed for work every morning, and unfortunately it was Draco. Their partnership in the Auror Department was going on four years now, ever since they’d finished training and been awarded Junior Auror Status. It was both four years too long and not nearly enough.
Draco finally looked away, busying himself with pouring himself a cup of tea and only then stirring in the milk. Posh git. “You were right,” he finally said. “About the catalyst, and the opposites, and balance. Have you always been clever?”
He never had got around to telling Ron about the board, and now it felt too secret, like it was a detail meant to stay in Hufflepuff. He couldn’t bring himself to betray that, meaningless as a single chess board was. It seemed that in Hufflepuff loyalty grew and grew, without one ever having to contemplate how.
“We really love volcanoes,” Padma explained. “I have a volcano calendar on my office wall and the cutest little volcano-shaped Floo powder dish. Oh! And last Christmas, Theo gave me a quill that writes with real lava, although I have to charm it cooler to use it in court, but it’s fantastic for distracting the defense. So volcanoes are our favourite. We’ve already been to see Krakatoa and Vesuvius.”
Harry stares at the empty spot in the doorway where Demelza had been standing only milliseconds before. He can’t call out to her and ask her what the hell she’s on about, and that pisses him off greatly. And he has to stay here overnight?
Harry was definitely suspicious by this point. “The fuck is wrong with you, Malfoy? Why are you telling me this?”
Hermione laughed, her eyes closing and her braids falling all over her face. It was moments like this, when she really allowed herself to be free, that Harry could see exactly why Ron fell in love with her all those years ago.
“Millicent said she was planning on taking those two, but she didn’t have time to play, what with her extra Arithmancy projects. I take it your Malfoy’s Millicent now?”
“But it does not matter where they come from,” said Severus, now idly scratching the Scottie’s ears as he gazed off into the middle distance. “It only matters that they’re here.”
“I don’t know,” said Malfoy, shrugging. “Feed it, pet it, cuddle it, give it a stupid Gryffindor name like Bertie or Jollies.”
He fished it out; it was a little dented, but the hovering charm was still in place, and it didn’t wobble when he set it floating three inches above the cauldron lip. He set the chicory roots inside and watched them steam, as he didn’t know what he’d do if he watched Malfoy instead.
they forcefully remove the blood ward from your magical core. You’re lucky Britain doesn’t like making the US happy and ignores extradition laws. Now go pack your shit. And don’t forget your fucking seahorse.”
Harry gapes. “That’s not fair! Your dad’s a murderous arsehole with a rap sheet and those names don’t even flow well. It’s too many syllables!”
“See this spell should’ve made the golems fall in love,” Fields says. He casts a diagnostic on the dolls and they pulse an empty grey. “But nothing. No emotional reading from them at all, even though we already implemented the standard animation spells and checked that they were working properly.”
“We lasted two weeks,” Draco said, rolling his eyes. His eyes cut to Harry's briefly, as if in reassurance. The jealousy faded. Even
“Feeling emasculated?” Hermione asked, also staring up at the penis. Out of the corner of his eye, Harry could see Miles creeping up with his sodding camera.
“It will require an O on your Potions NEWT. Do you think you can learn seven years’ worth of material in five months?”
“You stupid, fucking, reckless, cock-sucking, shit-for-brains arsehole!” Draco yelled. “You would’ve died! If you’d been alone in a cell in Guantanamo fucking Bay, or even at the Ministry… if Weasley and I hadn’t been there to coach you through something you should have
Ms Piazza blinked, looked down at her mobile and scrolled quickly through a dozen or more messages. After a moment, Ms Piazza looked back up and said, “My viewers have requested an image of a double rainbow and the message ‘What does it mean, ‘name’?’”
Harry nodded, felt wholly inadequate with it, and added in an eye roll to round it out. “My pleasure, Malfoy.”
When he’s aware of the world outside of Draco and his daughters again, he realises that the room’s cleared out, and it’s just the four of them again. Draco moves over, silently offering half of the hospital bed for Harry and Baby Potter. Carefully, Harry manoeuvers himself up, wary of jostling either of their babies. It’s amazing how those strange amoebas turned into these. (Secretly, Harry hopes one of them ends up a Hufflepuff, just to annoy Draco. )
. It was so bland as to be offensive because what the werewolf had really done was destroyed everything she’d ever valued. But then Lavender had got up and decided to value something different. If Ron saw something fierce and attractive in that, Harry couldn’t very well blame him. He saw it, too. He just didn’t want to sleep with her.
He was cut off as Hermione came up and elbowed him. She said into the camera, “You deserve that, Ron, but Harry’s going to have a good time anyway. Please don’t forget that the milk will spoil if you leave it out so be sure to put it back in the icebox—”
Harry snorts, but his laughter is muted again by the undercurrent of misery they’re all being subjected to. To
Harry shivered as he made the long, draughty walk from his rooms near the Infirmary to Malfoy’s. When he got there, he tapped on Poseidon’s frame and waited, thinking to himself that he was on the verge of freezing to death or at least developing frostbite.
He did so. His neck prickled as he set his stirring rod (glass, not wood) down again. When he turned to look, Malfoy was staring right at him with the most intense look Harry’d ever seen on him. The steam rising from his own cauldron made his face flushed and damp. Across the room, someone’s potion hissed warningly, and Malfoy smirked at him before returning to his own.
Harry was silent for a moment, thinking. He masked it by shuffling through his trunk, on an extended hunt for his ‘best cloak’. He didn’t even have a best cloak, he didn’t think. Maybe he should get one. Did Hufflepuff suit him? Did he feel comfortable here, in this cosy dorm room, with two of the windows facing the setting sun, and sunset light streaming in over his bed quilt and Malfoy’s hair, as he stared into his wardrobe, presumably choosing from a number of ‘best cloaks’?
Behind him, Malfoy huffed out a laugh, but it was somehow less biting than usual. Harry felt like a twat, but he rather thought he deserved a little jumpiness today of all days.
“Draco, get down!” He tries to throw himself on top of Draco anyway, but the blast comes from the other side of the retaining wall and everything is
“Nope, never,” said Harry. He grinned at Malfoy. “I guess it is a little funny that it’s you who finally did it.” He sighed happily. “Honestly, I thought I’d die without ever experiencing an orgasm from anyone but myself.”
“We should both quit,” Harry decided glumly. Their waitress came over with his pie, and Hermione ordered a second piece of banoffee and two more coffees for them.
Harry was unsure of what to say. He settled on, “Malfoy, are you aware of the term ‘schadenfreude’?”
It would be exactly what wizarding Britain expected of him, and he didn’t want anything to do with their expectations. “Professor Snape was in his portrait, though.”
Snape’s mouth twitched on one side. It sort of looked pleased, as far as Harry could tell. But it could have also meant that Snape was smirking at him. “And the types of hair in Flasks 2 and 3?” he queried, of course not telling Harry whether or not he was right.
Hermione chewed her lip a bit. “Well. I’d quite like to pair Arithmancy and magical Renaissance art.”
“The worst,” Murdoch agreed. He shook his head. “We’ve got to do something about, this is serious, it’s a serious thing. Trade deals, exports. The MUS is thinking this is very serious.”
to upend it over his posh blond head, but the glass stayed where it was, didn’t even bother to give a shiver. He looked back at Draco, victorious, and then frowned again because there wasn’t really any victory in not being able to do wandless magic.
Harry pointed his wand at the fireplace and got a fire going, the room almost immediately warming up, though it would take more than a fire to get the chill out of his bones tonight.
He fell into step beside him. The little butter knife kept following them, but Malfoy had stopped eating. “I…”
He needed to check on the—the thing. And Scorpius, too. One last time before they did this—before they changed the entire world.
Just a friendly reminder that this is a true WIP and while I know what the ending is, I don't know all the avenues we'll be taking to get there.
Draco didn’t know what to say, so he just kept hugging Potter, feeling both grateful and ridiculous, until they had to pull away out of decency’s sake.
“Unspeakable Potter has discovered a way to transfer your bond from Unspeakable Malfoy to your husband,” Apex says, startling them both with her presence. “It requires… a certain arrangement of events and emotions.”
“Potter!” McGonagall snapped, and as if under Imperio, Harry scurried up to the head table. McGonagall always was able to compel him to act right, he thought sourly.
Harry stops himself there because he’s getting ridiculous and he’s embarrassed of himself in his own head.
The cat hissed angrily, and Harry quite suddenly realised that—Hermione was on his couch. And she wasn’t pleased about it. He turned to Millicent. “Is that—?”
“Ah,” said Hermione. “That explains it then.” She capped her ink and smirked up at him. “If I looked at your roster, would it be full of only the most fetching players? I imagine you have both Hermes Kilgore
“By giving up my wand into your protection,” Theo said, “I am giving up my life, heart, and soul also. I trust that you will take care of it as your own, and that it will serve you as it has served me.”
“No, the next thing we need to do is find the Muggles who know how to get off those spaceships,” Millicent said.
By the time they get out of St Mungo’s, Harry happily staring at the little printout of their amoeba-like offspring swimming around in Draco’s belly, he feels like he could do anything.
“I do agree with Mr Dursley’s assessment of the situation,” Granger spoke up. She’d had her hair straightened today and it hung in a sleek fall around her face, accentuating her high cheekbones. “My parents are Muggles with public-facing careers that allow them to do a lot of small talk with their clients. They’ve told me that while almost everyone was talking about it yesterday, no one, so far, suspects anything more than natural phenomena.”
“Hermione’s five ten,” Ron said pointedly. This was true. And it was annoying. He glared at both of them.
“And thus we come to the point of this meeting,” said Minerva, returning to her chair and taking a seat. She crossed her hands on the table. Her white knuckles belied her stress. A rare bit of wandless magic from her had a second set of newspapers distributing themselves to the assembled, and that was when Harry, who had heretofore been manfully holding his shit together, felt the blood drain from his face and his sodding left ear start screaming.
Harry shrugged. “I, yeah—” He trailed off, biting his lip. This was tricky ground and he didn’t know how to navigate it. Finally, he sighed. “I didn’t want you to lose something that mattered to you… your crypt magic.”
Harry doesn’t really think he needs him as his Auror partner. Maybe everyone is right and Harry really does have a death wish. Maybe he’s not really in a mental place to be an Auror. But Draco is, and Draco’s strong and capable, and Harry shouldn’t stand in his way. So how could he need Harry then, if not as an Auror? Harry isn’t sure. He’s not good at anything else.
He pulled away, panting and Malfoy kneeled up to retrieve his wand from his holster. He cast a lubricant spell, dripping warm oil from the tip of his wand onto his fingers. Harry watched, unconsciously spreading his legs further apart. Malfoy smirked at him as he leaned forward again, bracing himself on one hand to kiss Harry’s mouth while his other traced up the cleft of Harry’s arse, circling his hole.
, and the other Muggle Immersion professor. Gryffindor recklessness obviously ran in the Evans family, Draco surmised.
His ear was still ringing; otherwise he might’ve wondered if he was hallucinating the whole thing, because surely something this mad could not be real. Was his heart pounding faster? Was he having a panic attack? Merlin, he
Harry laughed. “Which one’s the worst?” He checked his cauldron again, and finally it was at a roiling boil.
It took no time to get the table arrangements settled in the dining room, which also needed to be charmed, and then Teddy was freed to take his seat with Andromeda, as the guests had begun to arrive. Harry still hadn’t seen any of the Patils, but Hermione wasn’t panicking so he was certain they were here, though probably off in one of the guest rooms getting ready.
Heat was crawling up into his belly, sharpening the overwhelming punch of euphoria he felt with each thrust. He was walking the edge, each slide of their bodies threatening to push him over. Draco’s length was leaking against his stomach, so hot from blood it felt like melted wax against him. Harry pulled back from their kiss, his mouth slick and hot, and Draco threw his head back.
“Fine, yours,” Draco had said. Harry remembers it without fail. He knows this conversation as clearly as if he were watching it in a pensieve.
“That’s very Hufflepuff of you!” she said excitedly. “I’m glad to see that you’re getting accustomed to our new House. I quite like it here, don’t you?”
Slowly, Harry released their spent cocks and braced himself on either side of Malfoy’s face. Malfoy’s eyes were closed and a little smirky smile was playing at his lips. It gave Harry a thrill that he put that there, on
Draco rolled his head towards Potter’s. Draco dearly hoped Potter could see every detail of the absolute disdain for that suggestion in Draco’s expression.
“All the daffodils are dying in Wales,” Neville continued. “And the English Roses, the Scottish Heather, and the Irish Clover. Just all at once they started going. It’s a phenomenon that’s been happening since last summer.”
For this struggle, only the couple, their immediate family, and the goblin officiant were allowed in the room. The friends and extended family invited to celebrate the Second Struggle had to wait outside until they got the goblin gave the all-clear on the finances, and they were allowed in for the Vows.
Monthly dinners with Andromeda had been awkward and stilted, and twice Harry had found an excuse not to come. He’d not had a chance to really talk to Draco again since Christmas, and today was the day that Draco would let him start the chase.
She grinned. “I hope so.” She took another deep breath. “We can do this, Harry. There’s always life after, well.”
“It’s dangerous,” Draco said right away, the previous conversation apparently easily forgotten. “Can you imagine what would happen if we accidentally ingested some bad luck potion?”
Miguela took out two cauldron-shaped cards and handed one to each of them. “My floo address,” she said. “I would be delighted to keep in touch with both of you as you move through your careers.”
Mrs Black wanted to stay down to finish watching that episode with Hermione (‘As if I want to spend the evening staring at your luggage and listening to your sniffling, Mr Potter!’), so he went upstairs and got ready for bed alone. Which was probably for the best anyway since Mrs Black was worse than a mirror with her snippy comments about his appearance.
Draco lifted one eyebrow, and returned the stone to his pocket before any of the students could see it. “This is why you wanted that gneiss.”
“Harry!” Hermione said, dropping her bags and rushing to him. “You made it! It’s been weeks! I thought you were going back to one of your anti-magic phases when I didn’t see you at the Burrow last weekend.”
“I’m enjoying it more than I expected,” Draco admitted. “The students are surprisingly eager to learn about Gallic contraception spells and Peruvian weaving rituals. It’s…gratifying.”
“Nearly every magical nation in the world has agreed to the Statute of Secrecy,” said the assistant apologetically. “To refuse would be to declare war on every other magical nation in the world.”
Snape finally spoke up. “By antagonising him, you are only making your own life more difficult, idiot.”
, Mr Peterson,“ Hermione began, “but the US seems to have the highest concentration of practicing Wiccans in the world, so I think you’ll forgive me if I doubt your spell fully took! There are obviously American Muggles in New England and the rest of the country who believe in
, Harry thought in frustration. Why had he not paid attention in school, again? Now that the safety of his world depended on it, he couldn’t seem to remember.
After his second margarita and the third time he’d had to bat away a wandering hand beneath the water, Harry swam over to sit next to Hermione, who was, on the whole, a safer bet. She snapped her fingers to dry the water from them, turned a page, and returned her hand to the side of the pool, fingers dangling in the water.
She smiled, her eyes focused somewhere else. “It was lovely. Even with all the people around.” She frowned. “That night, your father called and made pointed remarks about your lack of heir.”
that?” He laughed once, showing all his white teeth. “Of all people! I would never want Muggles to find out about us. Not because I think they’re inferior—what does that even matter?—but because we’re entirely too different to coexist peacefully.”
Harry paused, opened his mouth to reply, and then very wisely changed his mind on the matter. “Do you have a middle name?”
Draco blushed, unable to help it. They were a hot mess. There was no way a real relationship could come of this, but the small, child-like piece of Draco that he’d never let go of could still blindly hope for something different. He sat up, brushed his hair back from his face. They needed breakfast, and then to get started on this monumental problem.
“Millicent, we’re planning to break an international law, in case you missed that part,” Potter said. “We’re going to most likely end up in Azkaban by the end of this.”
Hermione made a face and turned to read over a display of magazine ads for vibrators. Harry tried not to let his eyes slide to Malfoy, who was listening to the spiel with a great deal of attention, seemingly both enraptured and uncomfortable.
Malfoy groans. Harry manages a breathless smile as he works in a second finger. Suddenly, he’s flipped onto his back and Malfoy’s grasping his hand, scooping up all the slick oil there and coating his own fingers. He wastes no time pressing two into Harry.
Draco poured him another glass as the water heated up. “Don’t watch it,” he said. “It’ll never boil.”
Narcissa appeared around the doorframe in her riding clothes, beaming. “What ho, sister!” she exclaimed. “Terribly sorry for the delay. I’ve just come from Abraxans at Bagshot Park and you know how Sophie and Birgitte are. I didn’t even have time to change out of my gear. Heavens, it’s raining Crups and Kneazles down here!”
Weasley’s scowl didn’t change. “He’s worried sick about you, you know. Mum and Dad have been doing their best. Did you even say goodbye? Did you even think of him just now when you, yet again, volunteered to throw your life away?”
He’s just not too keen on telling the Weasleys what a slag for Draco he is. But there’s always next month.
“A lovely time,” she assured him. “Isn’t it wonderful that Hogwarts finally has a fair representation of Slytherins on its staff?”
He’d had to put on a summer jacket and shrink Mrs Black’s frame so he could stick her in an inside pocket and not look like a crazy person walking through the city with a large, rude oil painting under one arm.
The beetle was still crawling happily around on Draco’s wrist. Harry’s watched it for a moment, feeling something like dread curl up in his gut. What had the spirit beetle done to this stone, to attract Draco to it? And what would it do to Draco?
Draco considered. “Does it feel as if you have been repeating the same arduous task every day and the torment will never end, or is it more like you did a terrible deed to a woman and now a vulture is feeding on your liver every day while every night it grows back?”
Harry uncrossed his legs and crossed them again the other direction. “It’s just—and if I may—he’s such a
“Harry,” said Draco, and Harry jumped, caught by the unexpectedness of the sound. When he looked, Draco was smirking at him. “It sounds strange, doesn’t it?”
Hindsight being twenty-twenty, Harry knew now what he’d been scared of. Not of awkward questions from his godson, certainly. But from the possibility that Teddy walking in on them could ruin the fragile thing they might have just begun. He’d been desperate to keep Draco. And in doing so, he’d thrown him away.
He busies himself by working on the case, even though Draco says he’ll take care of it. He can’t stay still and fortunately, Ron and Hermione are usually willing to humour him.
For him to learn all the concepts in five months was going to be—he swallowed—it was going to be impossible. Even by Gryffindor standards…That is, unless he had a particular book. Harry detoured.
Harry smirked at Ron. “I made you one, too, remember? Let’s sit down and have a nice, long catch-up before you take my beloved goddaughter away from me.”
They both stepped backwards, pressing their backs against the shed. Snape was yelling something that Harry couldn’t understand over the sudden certainty that these wards were not going to hold. He took Draco’s hand and Snape’s portrait, and started running towards the field, but they’d only made it a few steps before he heard the deafening roar of the wards breaking and felt the heat of the explosion rushing over his skin.
Malfoy grinned. He lined himself up and pressed forward slowly. Harry groaned, his hips canting, his hand coming down to stroke lazily at his own cock to take off some of the ache from adjusting to the intrusion. Slowly, slowly, Malfoy pushed inside until, at last, he was fully seated and left panting above Harry. Harry felt his body tensing and relaxing again and again, adjusting to Malfoy’s presence.
Pomfrey frowned. “I’ve had to give Ms Lovecraft several Calming Draughts and a Dreamless Sleep. She was…not well. Harry, I’m afraid, is suffering from magical exhaustion. He Side-Alonged twenty-one people from London to Hogwarts.”
To his infinite pleasure and surprise, Malfoy flushes. His pupils blow wide, and he licks his bottom lip. “No,” he says. “I knew you wanted it.”
“I fucking know they do, Potter. I just thought I was done chasing after them. All right, fine. Someone’s working inside. What are your instincts saying we should do?”
“Mrs Fortescue said she wanted ice-cream fireworks,” Harry said, grimacing. “I don’t know if that’s a good idea.”
“Oh, for Merlin’s sake,” said Draco. “This is highly insecure. Our safety in this school rests on the defences of Hufflepuffs.”
At one hundred, he wordlessly (wandlessly) adjusted the heat, and just hung his head, letting Draco continue to devastate him, unable and unwilling to do anything about it.
“Welcome to Hufflepuff. You’ve made it through the barrels, and so you must be true badgers, even if you don’t look like them yet. A few words to get you started as you adjust to your new house: We are one.”
“Duly noted,” said Harry. “But what do I do? We still have family dinners every month with Andromeda. How am I supposed to wait six months for an answer? I can’t even wait for the kettle to boil without hitting it with a simmer spell!”
Hermione’s foot catches against Harry’s own, and he looks over from his perusal of the tablecloth to find her fighting a smile. She leans into his shoulder and whispers, “Ron says you’re Malfoy’s Mate.”
But Malfoy was looking at him oddly. Not angry—it was something else. “You didn’t use your wand. Again. Is wandless magic really that easy for you? It took me years to get one or two small spells.”
They followed Malfoy’s parents down a cobbled path that came to a cul-de-sac at the edge of a steep hill. There was enough light left for Harry to look down and see the White Horse of Wiltshire directly below them. And just beyond that, larger than anything Harry’d ever seen: a geometric shape, like a flower of life, pressed into the wheat below.
“Fine, fine,” Harry said. “But don’t forget to return the Animagus book you checked out last week. I’m not paying your fines to Madam Pince again just because you’re too lazy to walk up to the library.”
“Me, too,” Padma added, sighing. “I’m in court in an hour. We’re doing the divination this week, though, Hermione. I’ll owl you with the most auspicious date!”
When he goes to sleep, he thinks about him there, too, only when he’s asleep, he can’t stop his subconscious from remembering that night with the Muggle and replacing the woman with him…or sometimes even replacing her with Malfoy. He dreams about the long line of Malfoy’s spine; he sees it shiny with perspiration and bowed with pleasure; he sees Malfoy turning his head back over his shoulder and looking at Harry with sex-drunk eyes, his body moving with each of Harry’s thrusts, and fuck, when he wakes up from those, he forgets that Malfoy is
“Not as much as I’d thought I would,” he admitted. “But I kept showing up because I didn’t know what else to do.”
Even Petunia’s voice was different—lower and stronger, somehow, with none of the breaks it’d had from all the screaming she did at Harry.
That last time together in their flat with the heat of summer streaming in through their open bedroom window. Draco had sprawled on their bed, offering himself to Harry, his mouth pulled into a grin, his eyes crinkling. His short plait had already come half-undone.
Harry made a tiny sound, draped himself over Draco, and kissed him thoroughly. “I’ve been wanting this with you so long,” he gasped. “Like, twelve years long.”
“I will be, love.” His voice was so quiet, Harry wasn’t sure if he’d imagined it. “I’ll be fine when I see you again. Running on adrenaline right now.”
“You knew this the whole time?” Harry asked. It was directed towards Draco, but he wasn’t really sure who he was asking. All of them, really. “You knew and you still let him send you over there?”
“Tell me everything,” Draco said, as he pushed open the back door and strode in. He was in a t-shirt and sleep pants—the closest to undressed Harry had ever seen him in front of other people.
“You can call me Potter or Harry,” he said. “Draco.” The name was much softer on his tongue than he would’ve ever expected. He liked how it felt to say it.
He was wired—they probably all were—from whatever the hell was happening with Atlantis, and it was agitating him. Malfoy walked away, and Harry busied himself awkwardly positioning Snape’s frame in the Sticking Charm so he could see.
Draco was unimpressed. “Well, you can’t Apparate yet and I’m not Flooing so grab the damned teacup and let’s go.”
Mitchell pulls two dolls from his robes and sets them on the floor by the door. Fields aims his wand and all three Unspeakables step back from the golems. He casts one spell and the area glows white for a moment. A wave of magic follows a microsecond later, resettling around their bodies like a Demiguise. Fields’ protective spells have a smell of fir and Harry’s stomach does a little twist, thinking of Malta and Draco and Christmas. Just a few more weeks.
“Who said anything about more? I’m talking about that rubbish island the Mer Queen talked about. Let’s haul it in.”
Petunia put her hands on Millicent’s shoulders as they prepared to Apparate out. She looked Millicent over, studying her face and hair and stature. Finally, she smiled.
Malfoy’s mouth presses very tightly closed. “I’m on a Portkey tomorrow morning, Potter. I’m not your partner anymore.”
“Not such a big hero now, are you?” asked Draco. His eyebrow was arched in a way that made Harry want to lick his neck and perhaps his clavicle and a bit further if he could get away with it.
Except Malfoy. He really wishes he could run out of fucks there, but all he seems to do is play video games (badly, for some reason—he used to be so good) and wonder where Beirut is. Maybe one of the Muggles on PSN would know. He decides he’ll ask tonight when he gets home from dinner at Ron and Hermione’s. Except, oh wait, he can’t talk.
Malfoy sighed. “We need to cast the spell to hide the planet from the aliens, and to do that, we need about one percent of all Muggles on earth to volunteer to be magical conduits.”
Malfoy opened his mouth and wrapped his lips around the head of Harry’s cock and Harry bit down on his hand to stifle his moans. It was so, so very good, and it had been years and years since anyone had done this for Harry, but fifteen minutes later, he was no closer to coming than he was in interdepartmental meetings at work.
When the chicken wings arrived, Lee was disturbed to find that some were not actually from the wing area of a chicken. He held a tiny drumstick up, frowning. “This is a leg.”
This seemed to be a joke between them. Malfoy had the sense not to agree with it. Instead, he said, “Will you show me where it is?”
“Goggles, Potter. I’ll release the wards when I’m satisfied you’re protected. You will take the phial, and return immediately to your lab. I will reset all the wards here and meet you there.”
“Dinner,” says Ron. Harry gives him a dubious look. “Come on, Harry,” Ron says, ignoring that. “We have dinner with Luna all the time.”
“Well,” said Blaise, after a moment. “After all that, I’m sure you’ll be unsurprised to learn that we had virtually no success with the Muggle politicians. They were completely uninterested in environmental issues.”
The lad behind the counter smiled at them as they came in; Harry ordered them three cappuccinos to give them something warm to sip on, a reason to sit and watch television for awhile.
Draco’s eyes narrowed. He snapped his wand and a privacy spell flew up around them. “You can and you will, or we’ll end this
Regretfully, he let his hand slide back up, just as their faces broke the surface. Draco pulled back and the Charm stretched and popped, and then that almost-dying-almost-kissing moment was gone. Harry breathed in, let fresh, dry air fill his lungs, and felt emptier now than he had holding his breath.
Harry jerked to attention as he crossed the threshold, and, distantly, he heard Draco stop speaking mid-sentence. Teddy hadn’t noticed the awkward silence, but Andromeda’s gaze was narrowing thoughtfully, and even Narcissa, peppy as she was, sensed something amiss.
“Full marks for the article,” Orkney continued. “Excellent example of magical community security concerns.”
The same absurd, stunning realisation Harry kept ending up at when he lay in bed next to Malfoy, sweat cooling from his body, trying to fall asleep. The same realisation Harry had desperately wished wasn’t right. But it was. It was the only option they had.
Just then, the door opened, and there was Malfoy, giving all three of them a flat stare. “It does have a kettle, yes, Potter, but it’s electric,” said Malfoy. His eyes cut sideways. “Hello Granger, Jordan.”
Nigella is sick. Wolpertingers turn black when they’re dying. A darkness to help them hide in shadows while their bodies fight. It starts cloud-grey with a cold and then it darkens with severity. Nigella is charcoal—critical, still breathing, still nursing.
Save for Malfoy, who took advantage of the smaller crowd to come take the chair opposite Harry. He sat, leaning forward, with his elbows on his knees and his pale eyes shining.
Harry rolled away. He’d probably just now realised what they’d done, and then he’d run, and they’d never talk of it again, despite how Harry’s life would never be the same again.
“And perfectly dead, which you’d know is closer to a fantasy world than my mum not knowing what to feed me anymore,” said Dudley.
“Oh, god,” Ron whispers, and then he’s gone, pulled into his own head, mania overtaking him. His blue eyes go sybil-pale and the Unspeakable in Harry watches it, detached, curious, while inside, he is screaming. He has never been the one to push Ron into an episode before. He hates himself for doing it, knowing it would happen. He can’t examine this yet. He’s afraid to. He’s afraid of what he’ll see, what he’ll
Katelyn Harmon’s smug face was on the front page again. Shacklebolt had gone back to the UMN yet again begging for permission to Obliviate an extra one thousand Muggles for the year on top of their standard annual allowance of six hundred. Yet again, she’d rallied enough allies to block him and furthermore said she’d still block him even if he were only asking for ten extra Obliviations. It was only October, and no matter what magic Muggles saw in UK for the remainder of the year, Britain would have to let them go on their merry ways, with whatever knowledge they’d gained.
Other people in the park had seen it; Dudley had even got a photo on his mobile. Although the photo was a bit blurred from movement, and it really only showed a kind of triangle-ish shape above the trees, in the darkest, most void-like black Harry had ever seen.
The stream of magic flowing up from Draco’s wand sputtered, slowed to a stop. He felt as if he were looking in on himself from a remove. He was not part of his own body, not part of his own mind. His body was a foreign place where nothing lived and everything was dull. He was so tired…or the body he watched was, anyway…if he could only just sleep for a moment…
“I’m not,” Harry admitted. “I was trying to find something on how Muggle chemicals interact with magic.”
“You took these from the Ministry,” said Draco, still staring at them. He looked up. “You’re going to get us all arrested again.”
Then the food arrived, and Harry was left to enjoy the warmth of wined-infused conversation, of getting to know people he’d never bothered with, like Padma and Blaise. Of getting to know new people like Kyle and Quincy, who were so very like Malfoy in some of their posh ways, but so very different from him in others. And Mrs Malfoy, who was without doubt running some kind of game, and doing it quite well. He had no idea what her subplot was. He had a feeling it had nothing to do with the Mers.
“I’m coming with you,” Harry said. It was too coincidental that something strange would happen with the Malfoys just now, and Harry wanted to see whatever it was.
But Harry isn’t staying here. He’s just come to talk (or gesture) some sense into Malfoy so they can both go home and Harry’s electronics will work properly again. He shrugs, hopes his expression looks simultaneously grateful and regretful or whatever is appropriate right now.
Before he could pull her back, Hermione was in front of it, squinting up at the letters along the top. “
Harry tried to pull away. “No. I don’t want this,” he said, but Draco tightened his arms and Harry remained where he was. “I don’t want a pity fuck, Draco,” he added quietly.
He kicked off, staring down at the city and the blanket of fog that hid Malfoy from his view. Harry thought of the heady, rushed intimacies between them, the way his heart skipped over beats when Malfoy grinned at him, the way he made him laugh and smile and
Sunday morning he finally got around to writing that letter to Ron, though what to fill it with was still a mystery. He worked on it all through breakfast, adding thoughts here, anecdotes there, but an hour after, it was barely a page long. Hermione took pity on him and suggested he include the Gryffindor Quidditch team line-up, as it would take up space.
He bent down, engulfing Harry’s prick in his mouth. Harry arched up, gasping. Malfoy groaned around his cock, and then Harry felt two fingers pumping inside of him, making sure he was ready. They retreated, leaving Harry feeling empty, but then he opened his eyes to find Malfoy leaning over him, reaching for the Zwei on the bedside table.
Harry woke suddenly. The room was pitch black and the sheets were cold on the dog’s side. He lay absolutely still, as he’d learnt to do in his brief stint in Auror training, and just listened. There was nothing there. No sound, no movement, no light showing beyond his eyelids. But something was off.
The Muggle woman moans, shifting her hips back against him, and he makes the mistake of looking down at her.
“Sex is such a funny thing,” Harry mused. “When you’re a teenager, it’s all you think about. Then, when you’re an adult, you find that it’s not nearly as uncomplicated or exciting as you thought it would be. I used to sit in Binns’s class and fantasise about all the sex I’d have if I lived to be an adult. I think I mentally tried it on with half the people in our year, and it all seemed so great. Now…” He shrugged. “I don’t think I’ve managed to pull anyone in the last twelve months, and I didn’t even remember to think about it until just now.”
“To my hotel room, obviously.” He takes a few steps, looks back over his shoulder with that damned eyebrow cocked. “Are you coming or not? Do I have to model your clothing to get you interested in taking it off me?” As if Harry needs the temptation, Malfoy opens his over-cloak and shows Harry what’s underneath. White waistcoat, silver buttons. White trousers hanging on by a prayer. It’s the suit Harry’s designed for him to model—he must have sneaked it out after the show.
Luna put an arm around his shoulder and led him out of Al’s bedroom, shutting the door quietly behind them. She flicked a silencing spell at the door.
to? It’s fucking Beirut. Harry’s only even heard of it because of Malfoy’s sudden fifth-life crisis. Where the fuck is Lebanon anyway? He really should pull up a map when he goes into work tomorrow.
“Nothing like the exposure of our entire world to brighten up one’s afterlife,” said Draco, glaring. “You’re enjoying this, aren’t you? Now that it won’t affect you.”
Torches flickered to life. A stairwell curved down and it took Harry a moment to recognize the corridor leading to the kitchens. He hadn’t seen this place in so long he’d almost forgotten about it.
“Then we’ll have to figure out how to make it all work together,” Harry said firmly. “I’m sure the Ravenclaws would love the challenge.”
‘It’ll be good to make your own connections,’ Padma had told her at one of their recent wedding planning meetings.
“Then you must put something of Draco’s essence in the Potion.” Snape did not sound overly surprised.
They had a place to start. Draco refused to think of how it would end with the loss of his own magic.
There was a moment of hesitation, and then Justin, an absolutely-no-question-about-it Muggleborn, hugged Draco, who was perhaps too startled to do anything but return it. Justin released him, beaming, and turned to Sally.
Boot guffawed, slapping the table a bit as he struggled to breathe. Between laughs, he somehow managed to get out, “Could be—could be worse…could have been cut first round from the Cannons’ pre-season draft.”
“We can start with the worst offenders – in theory we’d get big results from that, and eighty percent of our results should come from twenty percent of the places,” said Justin.
“That’s a lot,” Harry said, before she could really get going. “So in five years, we’re going to go from one-hundred percent magic to…” he trailed off, adding the numbers up in his head, “something like ninety percent?”
He’s still not comfortable working with Lebanese pounds, so by the time he figures out the cost of the shawarmas, does the math in his head, and tries vainly to mentally convert it to galleons so he can tell if he’s getting buggered or not, the Muggle woman is well frustrated. She holds up four fingers and points to one coin, then holds up 3 fingers and points to another coin. He doesn’t even care at this point, and hands it over without argument. Next he looks for a wizard on a bike; it, unsurprisingly, isn’t hard to find. From him he purchases some bread hanging from hooks on his bicycle and is grateful that the exchange happens over sickles.
It’s been a hell of a long time since Harry’s seen a Manticore, but he recognises the little beast as soon as he nears the docks. It’s running happily back and forth, feelers waving as it weaves around the feet of passing Muggles. Judging by the Glamour Harry can see shimmering around it, he’s been cleverly disguised as a Basenji, but to Harry they will always look like those Warlock pets from that time he played
? And then another? Maybe just do one a day, just to be sure? Atlantis isn’t part of the ICW and I don’t think they’re going to bother upholding the Statute, no matter what we do.”
“That’s brilliant. I just need an O in Astronomy, and I’m on at the Apache Point Observatory. Can’t wait for Mexico. I love sun, don’t you?”
Is there a magic to be harnessed in the knowledge of loss? It would be sort of poetic if his emotional magic was healed by even worse emotions. And magic is often poetic, Harry’s found. Or at least petty.
Harry nodded miserably. “I have no idea how we’re going to coordinate that, or even get the word out. And we can’t go on telly again—the ICW is out for our blood and they’ll find us.”
“Immortality,” Draco said. “And transformation of base metals into precious ones.” He chewed on his bottom lip with his erotically crooked canine teeth. “They’re such wildly different effects that I can’t think of
Another round of laughter comes, and Harry freezes. He knows that laugh. Harry twitches his wand and nothing happens. Sighing, he refocuses and tries again. This time, the non-verbal Notice-Me-Not spreads over him and only then does he turn around.
Harry wore his new cloak on the night of Halloween. They were all stuffed and happy from the feast. Their spirits were high and their pockets were full of Honeydukes. Where the other houses had an array of sweets to choose from, the Hufflepuff table had been loaded down with all kinds of chocolates. Harry had looked up to the head table as he finished dinner and found Professor Sprout looking down at them all, her eyes soft with the worry a mother might feel watching children go off into the world. There was more to it than that, but she was good enough not to let on.
“You are restless,” she said. “You desire change, maybe chaos…for your lives to be more than living, for finding some higher magic to life itself. You will not be disappointed in your chosen paths. They are good for those of us who look for something higher than money in our vocations.”
“He’s been playing with Albus Potter,” Astoria said, with that patient, amused look on her face she always used when she was warning him about something she thought he was going to ridiculously overreact about. “They stole away together at breakfast while you were in Atlantis, and now he’s going with Albus to his Gran’s this weekend. They have LEGO.”
“The Our Lady of Lebanon monument in Harissa,” Fievel says then. Another pause. “The fuck you can’t! Those are my Aurors out there, and you will send in the goddamned
she’d always say, and Draco would pull himself up straight, apologise perfunctorily, and make a hasty retreat. She’d never yelled at him, but he’d hardly thought she’d be glad to see him back at Hogwarts after twelve years gone.
“They’d care if it affected their assets,” Draco said, smirking. “Your wealthiest Muggles—what are their main investments?”
“I thought they were pretty much unlimited already. I mean, Fudge was around for awhile, wasn’t he?”
“Dunno,” said Ron. “Maybe one of those fancy Dicta-Quills so she can finally write that bloody book about the Hunt for Things That Cannot Be Named.”
take on apprentices but we generally require that prospectives engage in a gap year between Hogwarts and apprenticeship, to ensure that students are knowledgeable of worldly affairs.”
Harry pulled them from his pocket and slipped them on, then did up his robes and cast the appropriate safety spells over them to make them lab-standard. He figured he should probably not just walk the halls carrying a vial of live Poison, so he looked about, and found one of Snape’s travel bags hanging from the door.
“I like to think that I’m in the dungeons. The view is nice from my suite in the Transfiguration wing, but there’s something erogenous and intimate about the dungeons, and it’s familiar to me, so that helps. I think about my prefect dorm, with the big window and the yellow-green light that filtered through the lake water and refracted in waves over my bed. The way it moved was like bodies: undulating, osculating. Intimate. And I think that someday I’d like to be one of those bodies.
“Oh, I did,” said Anthony, with a great deal of disinterest. He was reading through his notes from their last meeting as he spoke. “There was a period in fifth year where I couldn’t hold a conversation with Michael without having to wait for him to detach his mouth from Draco long enough to answer.”
And Malfoy seems pleased by this. He falls forward again, and their bare chests press together hot and damp. He slides his fingers into Harry’s hair and drags his tongue along Harry’s jaw. “Potter,” he whispers.
Well, actually, now that Draco thought of it—and adding the students from all his classes so far—pretty much everyone, even Potter, seemed to accept his presence by now. Maybe he was being prematurely paranoid. Which, he thought, was pretty fair given the situation his family was in. He had a son to protect, after all.
They were silent for a while as Harry set to work on his essay for understanding the qualities of common antidotes. He could hear Snape shuffling around in his frame, where he’d set up a makeshift office amid the heather. Finally, he could take it no more, and said. “You and Mr Malfoy are—friends,” Snape decided, hopefully.
“Hermione and I have been looking up the locations of all the major tribes,” said Padma. “We think it would be a good idea to visit each of them, to make sure we have a full understanding of their concerns so we can create a comprehensive plan of action.”
and flicked her eyes between the two of them. Harry could see the gears turning and he hated it because he didn’t want to answer questions and he didn’t know how to even if he did. Fortunately, Millicent came in next and shoved in beside Hermione, quickly pulling her into what Harry was beginning to suspect was an Arithmancy-based form of foreplay. Hermione was certainly responding to it.
“No, thank you,” she said, but it came out more like, ‘Not on your fucking life.’ “I’m not carrying a dick around just to meet your numbers. You can Glamour me into a different woman, and you and Potter can fight over the other one.”
He’s outside of himself again; there must be something wrong with him to always escape his own body when he knows something will hurt him. Is this what his mother did as she carefully, methodically, built up her own fear and misery? He studies the soft white-blond stubble on Draco’s jaw and carefully, methodically, does not remember how it feels against his inner thighs.
“We can start with the Chesapeake Merrows,” said Hermione, ignoring his whine. “Since they were the ones who rioted.”
This time, Snape couldn’t maintain the illusion of boredom. “An abduction attempt? Potter, you cannot—“
Malfoy looked annoyed. “It’s hard to avoid, really, if I want to speak to Pansy. Granger’s always with her nowadays, and one can barely get a word in before she opens her bushy mouth.”
On Tuesday, he dragged his arse out of the house, determined to apologise to Draco and fix this thing with Teddy. He resolutely ignored the Sword of Gryffindor in the troll leg umbrella stand as he grabbed his raincloak from the peg by the door. When he got in, Sephora raised her eyebrows.
The gift Harry was really waiting to be opened, however, sat in front of Draco’s crossed legs, untouched. Harry nudged him with his shoulder. “Open it,” he said quietly.
“But it was not fast enough. Generations went by and while humans on the island were growing stronger, smarter, lither, their own forms were growing thinner, weaker, their senses dulling. So they began to change us, making small adjustments to us that would hasten the process, and when they reached the form and mind they desired, they duplicated that person, so that they might be more available for making children like them.”
Harry groans, Merlin fuck it makes him hot when Draco uses toffy words in the same sentence as swears. He can feel himself hardening and would really love nothing more than to pull both their cocks out, summon a tubful of olive oil from the kitchen, and just rub their bodies together endlessly, or at least until they’ve come three or four times. He likes the feel of Draco’s belly between them nearly as much as he liked the firm flatness it’d been before. Actually, maybe he likes it just as much, now that he thinks about it. Maybe he—
“Now, I will tell you the history of the world and all people in it,” said Queen Sostrate. “It’s a long story, but an interesting one.”
They split the tab because it would be weird if Harry offered to pay, and then they step outside. There’s an alleyway two streets down that they like to Disapparate from. It’s a quiet walk and it remains quiet when they reach the alley; Malfoy wraps his hand around Harry’s forearm, and Harry Side-Alongs them to his flat.
The barista glanced at Harry with a little quirked smile and said, “You get the feeling you’re a complete idiot for believing her and a complete idiot if you don’t?”
“An unfortunate side-effect of studying a particular branch of magic in the Department of Mysteries,” Granger said, stepping into the tent. She had a scowl on her face and her hair was loose again, fluffing all around her face.
Draco shrugged, but suddenly seemed uncomfortable. “Yeah, fine. Look, I was thinking about the Separation and Conjunction bits. Uncle Sev made that healing potion in third year, the one that worked on everything he tried. He didn’t try it on one particular thing, though. It was always too dangerous.”
request he’s ever received aside from Draco’s on the train before first year. Other people just assume they’re acquaintances or friends after meeting him, and it’s made him uncomfortably aware of his own personal space and when other people are easing themselves into it.
Harry settled in for another round of distillation. It was close. So close. It might be the final round, he reckoned. This time, when he sat down next to Draco, Draco’s hand slid into his, and their fingers interlaced. Harry’s breath hitched; he said nothing, and they watched the steam rising through the still and condensing at the top. Their essences were mingled together somewhere in that steam, and Harry didn’t know how to handle that. He was currently blocking out everything that had been said today, on account that he didn’t think he would be able to get through this process if he didn’t.
Harry shrugs. He knows this. The mention of Malfoy’s name makes his stomach twist painfully. Has it really been three weeks since he left? Three weeks since Harry’s seen him? If Malfoy’s been gone three weeks, then Harry only has...he pauses to calculate it...roughly 3,380 weeks to go before he dies. He can go that long without Malfoy. Probably. Unless he gets killed in a raid first, which would make the wait a whole lot shorter, come to think of it… No, he decides. That would make it sound like he had a death wish. He shakes himself. He really should be paired with a healing Auror, though. He definitely works best when his back is covered.
“We both have hereditary seats, numbnuts,” said Draco. “Which you would’ve known if you ever bothered to show up for a session or, dare I say it, a vote.”
“Thank you, Petunia,” said Millicent, moving a blooming potted cactus out of the way to set her tea down. “Perfect as always.”
It takes another fifteen minutes before the area is secure enough that Harry feels safe having Draco within the city limits. They settle down against the cement retaining wall some feet away and watch the boats sailing in and out. Still no Fievel and still no Proulx and still no other Aurors. Where the hell are they? Ron is probably held up at Portkey Customs because that’s the sort of situational irony that Harry is normally subjected to.
He reached into his pocket and brought out Mrs Black’s shrunken frame. “She has an industrial strength Cheering Charm on her,” he added, and Narcissa’s face brightened infinitesimally.
Draco hesitated. The staff room was empty. The fire crackled in the hearth and it sounded so intimate and domestic that Harry couldn’t help imagining what it would be like to have Draco as his friend again…just the two of them, maybe flatmates, maybe forever, and he’d come home from the lab at night, and Malfoy would come home from wherever it was Transfigurists worked, and they’d lounge in front of the fire together, shoes off, calves tangling—
Several discreet coughs sounded, but McGonagall pretended to ignore them. Finally, Professor Vector said, “A large crop this year.”
If Harry had been sober, he would’ve thought it was a fantastic idea to get them all feeling more like they belonged. The other eighth years who’d been sorted with him were mingling, too. Besides Malfoy, Anthony, and Neville, Hufflepuff had also received Su Li, Tracey Davis, Mandy Brocklehurst, and Sally-Anne Perks. He didn’t know all of the seventh years, but Fayth Williams had come from Gryffindor, and there was Luna, of course. He had found it easy to get to know his housemates here, as he hadn’t done in Gryffindor. They really were a unified group here. It wasn’t so hard to be part of a group; he’d just thought it was.
“When I took Polyjuice for my term exam,” Harry said, “I was able to…” he trailed off, suddenly remembering exactly how hypothetical his Animagus form was in McGonagall’s eyes. Well, bugger. This was more than just a passing fancy, and might be significant for his and Draco’s inter-subject project, so he was just going to have to suck it up. He flicked his wand at the door and set a few privacy spells around the room. McGonagall lifted an eyebrow, but said nothing.
She frowned at the window, where a row of tiny specks on the sea’s horizon reminded all of them of the constant scrutiny of several Muggle militaries.
He remembered the blue light as he regained his breathing. Hermione was already looking around for the source of it.
Harry grimaced. “They’ve probably put a moratorium charm on international Portkeys.” He remembered them from the six months of Auror training he’d sat through before realising he had no interest in being an Auror. “They’re all blocked.”
But Harry had known Kreacher was dying. Kreacher had told him and Mrs Black. Elves knew their time. Harry had had time to prepare. Draco could have killed them both in that water, and it would’ve been a surprise. A horrifying surprise.
By the time Harry and Draco’s monthly dinner with Andromeda came around on the first Sunday of December, Harry’s crush had gone from a steady, underlying niggle in his brain, to a rushing, sparkling burn all over his body.
Malfoy slunk in and took the seat next to Harry just as Flitwick began leading the first years through. Harry stiffened, tried to hide his surprise, but he wasn’t sure if he was successful or not. Maybe they were talking again. He wasn’t entirely sure if the project carried over into their social lives.
Teddy nodded determinedly. “I have to if I want Gringotts to hire me, and I do. Professor Flitwick’s spoken to Professor Vector about getting me some extra reading next term, so I can catch up before third year when I take Arithmancy.”
Snape gave him a withering look, settled into the empty chair and desk amid the sheep Draco had commissioned for him to visit in. He tapped his painted fingers along the desktop, seemingly warring with himself over what he was about to say.
“This is bollocks,” Draco said. “Why do I have to play the foxy woman? I want to be Reverend Green.”
don’t like being torn to pieces,” Luna added. He scowled at his reflection in the window. She touched his back. “Harry.”
He gave up in frustration, and just banished both their clothes. Draco narrowed his eyes. “Where’d you send those?”
The conversation slowed after that. The day was a resounding success, but they all still felt drained. Even Petunia looked as if the weeks she’d spent under stress would take more than Dudley’s safe return to completely dissolve.
“Only to bad luck,” Harry says. “Thanks for reminding me what her first name is, though. I think I might’ve called her Dementora at the briefing meeting.”
Hermione dropped her quill, and purple ink began to drool out onto her notes. She noticed and cast a hasty spell before all her pages were ruined. “Harry—are you out of your mind?”
“I do, too,” Draco says quietly. “But you followed procedure exactly. You did every single render safe procedure step. I watched you. What else can we do?”
“This really does sound like it sucked,” Harry said. “I’m starting to be very glad I never married.”
Harry nodded again. He rummaged in his kit for his alembic, and then attached it to the top of his cauldron. Once secure, he raised the flame again. They settled down on the dead grass, leaning back against the shed wall beneath Snape’s stuck frame. Somehow their shoulders came to touch, and neither of them moved away. It was warm and quiet in their little area, and there was something profound in watching his hair melt into Draco’s.
“We’ll see,” Draco said, but he did allow Harry to gently take his hand and lead him over to Padma and Theo, who were beaming as they greeted all their guests. Padma was wearing a beautiful orange-red robe that shimmered in the candlelight like lava, and Theo’s black robes were not the deep inky colour of a tuxedo, but the igneous, shifting colour of hardened lava.
Malfoy raised his eyebrows. “What for? It isn’t like there’s a window in the door,” he said. “It was statistically likely to happen sooner or later.” Harry said nothing. Slowly, Malfoy said, “Did you not ever run into any of your old roommates?”
Before, when Draco was his partner, he could occasionally be convinced into a few miles around the park of a Sunday morning, but now his Sundays are better spent on PSN, which just came out last month and which he’d hoped to use with Malfoy before Malfoy fucked off to the desert. It would have been such a laugh to listen to Malfoy bitching at Muggle teenagers playing
“Muggle Immersion teacher,” Malfoy reminded him, sipping his brandied tea. “Seemed like the person to ask.”
Ron did manage to see them to the station on the day they were to return to Hogwarts. He’d apologized, and felt ruddy awful about hurting Hermione’s feelings, and she’d accepted it, as she always did.
He yawned, feeling a delicious sort of sleepiness come over him. He was definitely going to sleep better tonight than he had this past week.
has it performed optimally. Each group of our volunteer mice had at least one subject who remembered
“The free Snitch went to Draco Malfoy,” Harry said, for the benefit of the cameras, as instructed. They would cut in with a montage of Malfoy-scenes and the (censored) text of his letter no doubt. Harry tried not to care how much of himself this one moment exposed, on magicvision. “I have seven more to hand out.”
“It can’t,” Anthony said. “Extensive studies have proven that being around or being affected by a large amount of magic has no adverse effects on Muggles. It may be similar to electricity, but it doesn’t react with the human body at all the same.”
“Much better than seeing more of these stupid American ambassadors’ faces,” she said after swallowing, and irritably flung the day’s paper onto the steps in front of them. “I’m beginning to believe that they’re still just bitter about being colonies. Don’t they see that they’re endangering
“Of course you do, Draco,” Snape snapped. “Of fucking course. How might I abandon the very interesting manuscript on Panacea I was reading to assist you?”
“In the last month, assuming we survived all the other ordeals, we had to submit our union to the highest judge of all: wild magic. If we received a magical blessing, we could go ahead and get married. If not, and we still wanted to go through with it, we could get a handfasting instead. Fortunately — or unfortunately — we received a wild magic blessing, and eleven years later, here we are.”
Harry grinned. “That’s right. But I don’t know if Hermione’d be interested in watching a football game. D’you want to come to the Broomsticks with me on Sunday for my Quidditch fantasy league?”
Boot grinned, and it was such a nice, happy grin than it made Harry’s mouth curve up as well. God, he hated Boot. Hated how happy and together he was. And he also thought he was an alright chap and they probably would’ve been friends if Harry wasn’t trending towards basketcasedom these days.
“I think we’ll have the contenders you’ve chosen make their swimsuits out of found objects, to demonstrate their creativity.”
Harry stares down at his hands clenched in his lap as things start to fall into place in his head. He can hear Luna breathing, can feel her watching him, waiting for something. He looks back up at her and notices that her eyes are incredibly focused and clear right now. He’s never seen that on her. He swallows and opens his mouth to speak before he remembers that his voice still isn’t working. Fucking Reynolds. Fucking St Mungo’s. They still don’t know why he hasn’t healed correctly.
Harry took a seat in one of the two well-cushioned wingbacks by the fireplace and curled his feet beneath himself. They sat in a weird silence until a kitchen elf popped up with a tea service. Harry put three sugars in, even though he’d been trying to cut back ever since Dudley got on that Keto diet and made him feel so unnecessarily guilty about the most innocent amount of sweetener.
. His red beard could’ve used a trim but Harry had thoughts of that beard tickling his inner thighs as Ruby licked his bollocks.
There is a pause, silent, thoughtful. Apex’s head tilts. “You have spent weeks in your own misery, Unspeakable Potter. Has the—loss of my son truly become tangible in your magic now?”
Last night, he’d known Malfoy more intimately than he’d ever known him before, and that knowledge didn’t go away just because they had more important things to worry about. It scratched at Harry’s mind, refusing to let him focus.
The short witch didn’t sit back down. “Atlantis must resume the hiding spell or the British Ministry will take it as an act of war!”
“Not a wink,” Harry said. “I suppose I sleep better with you to guard me.” He added a suggestive, overdone wink to the end to make it more playful-sounding than he actually meant it, but it worked.
Harry nodded, straightened. It was already dark outside the windows. He pointed to his mouth and glared until Ron cast a mouth cleaning charm on him. It scrubbed at his tongue and gums much harder than it strictly needed to. Ron and Hermione were (probably rightfully) arsed off at him, but he didn’t regret it for a second. He’d put way too much work into this shit project for some government afraid of being voted out of office to dismantle it at the first whine.
“When I did the spell to test the sample’s magic levels. It...it’s like an electric shock, I’m sorry I can’t describe it any better.”
“And we all remember the waivers and contracts we and our parents signed at the beginning of the year that say not only you, but your parents also, will spend a great deal of time in Azkaban for the misuse of these spells?”
“I stayed out of sight, spending nearly all my time in the caves below with other magical people, and we created spells and rituals, learned to augment time and space. It was nine hundred years before my father died and I ascended.”
Harry turned and gave her an annoyed look. She missed it because she was busy telling on him to an Auror. Her fingers flew across the screen of her mobile, no doubt being as verbose in text as she favoured in real life. Then, Harry’s mobile vibrated.
With a roll of his eyes, Snape disappeared from the siren’s beach and she looked much relieved by it. Hermione waved to her, ever polite.
Petunia frowned at him for a long moment, then shook her head, smiled. “All right. Finish your tea and I’ll pop you all over.”
Hermione and Draco arrive together, both looking like they’d not slept the night before. That makes four of them, then.
Harry did not have an answer for that. “Um. Ruby,” he said instead. Luna noted this down. “And Dune, Felix, Quill, Zeph, Atlas.” He paused. Luna looked up at him, blinking slowly. Harry swallowed. “Malfoy,” he said on a sigh. Ugh. He hated himself in that moment.
Harry nodded, unable to speak. In his cauldron, in this makeshift lab, only corridors from where Draco slept, there now sat the beginnings of the Philosopher’s Stone.
Luna smiled at him. “Good,” she said. “Gregory Goyle asked me to Hogsmeade and I would be disappointed if it disappeared before we got to go.”
Harry sighed. “Thank Merlin it’s a lecture day,” was all he could think to say. He couldn’t deal with taking the kids out on an immersion experience today. Then, “Where’ve you been?”
“I want to know more about these—aliens, she called them? Where can I find more information on them?” asked Malfoy.
. Only half of those in the Americas were. This spell is unreliable and unsafe and we should be focusing our efforts on redirecting the narrative rather than spelling un-consenting Muggles all over the world.”
, indeed. Harry had always liked Draco’s hair at his shoulders. It had looked so loose and carefree, so like the Draco only Harry knew. Had Draco kept it that way for Harry or because
Harry throws himself down on the couch. This is not going at all like he intended for it to go, although now that he gives it some thought, he doesn’t know exactly what he intended. He just knows it wasn’t this. “You’re my healer,” Harry says quietly.
She waved her hand frustratedly. “Your life, Mr Potter. My son values it.” She glanced pointedly down at their joined hands. “Will you continue to try to kill yourself, and leave my son unhappy? I
But Malfoy made the grandest sounds, his hips rolling with Harry’s slow licks and sucks on his shaft. His fingers were tangled in Harry’s hair, the nails scraping lightly against his scalp. Everything was erotic. Everything felt ten thousand times more stimulating and sensual than normal.
Pansy shook her head. “Children really have no idea what it was like.” She brightened. “I wonder if Millicent will take the job next year.”
“Brilliant?” Harry suggested, still undone by Draco’s smile. “Cool? Great? Sexy?” He added the last one because he’d finally perfected Snape’s swirly robe manoeuver and one of these days, Draco was bound to notice. Luna had. Though, perhaps Luna noticing wasn’t necessarily reflective of its obviousness.
The Slytherins started cackling across the room, and Harry’s face turned red, even though he knew they couldn’t hear him. That meant maybe it was Hermione’s reaction that was causing it—he had no idea why she’d stopped talking, but the look on her face told him that she’d just realised something horrid. Something where he was found wanting.
, because everything’s basically fine…but the hair on the back of my neck literally stands on end sometimes. Am I going mad?”
Piers looked uncomfortable, but accepted a wand, of all things, from Aunt Petunia, and flicked it. A small set of silver sparks popped from the tip like champagne bubbling over. Dudley took the wand from him and did the same. His sparks were red and gold.
Luna got them all settled into their hotels rooms and then swanned into Harry’s, again without knocking. “Hi, Luna,” he said, not bothering to look away from the view of Copacabana visible from his balcony. He’d spent the whole night thinking of Malfoy and today looked to be shaping up similarly. Harry smiled, unable to help himself.
Harry turned and strode back over to him. “I see it now,” he said. He grabbed Malfoy’s waist and pulled him closer. “Is it too late?”
“Bugger,” said Ron. Mrs Weasley gave him a stern look. “Well hopefully she gets here before Lavender, so we can at least get that sorted.” He grimaced. “I suppose I’ll ask Lav not to come if it turns out for the worst.”
The water cuts off, Draco comes out still towelling his hair. Harry takes a moment to watch his arse flex as he walks to the wardrobe and pulls out his work trousers, shirt, and robes. The heady, oppressive feeling of a thousand protective spells from the wool fabric invades the bedroom.
She wrinkled her nose. “I’m extending it as long as I can. Anyway, I’m going to get back to Ron and the others. Molly’s got our kids and Mr and Mrs Honeyduke are about to break out the chocolate cordial. Night, Harry. Night, Malfoy.”
Pansy stopped short, inhaled and exhaled slowly. Draco put a hand on her back and she gave him a grateful smile.
“Merlin, what was I thinking accepting the Head job,” she muttered. “They’re wretched, evil little beasts.”
He realizes his breathing’s not going to come under control again so he kisses Malfoy anyway, and Malfoy arches into him, his lips warm and yielding beneath Harry’s own. His erection is hot as Incendio against Harry’s thigh.
Lavender smiled, blushing. One half of her face dimpled, and one half still had four sharp slashes up her cheek and another two down her neck. Harry rather thought it made her look even more fit than she’d been at Hogwarts. He did have a bit of a thing for the bad-boy/bad-girl look. Draco and Millicent,
When Malfoy’s Thestral completes its circuit, the music dies down and the lights descend. It takes Harry a moment and a sharp elbow from Luna to remember that he’s got to go out there.
“Go with Malfoy,” Padma said. “You’ll be able to explain any of the Muggle chemicals that he can’t.”
“I got it for homework,” Harry explained. Hermione looked even less impressed. “Fine – that’s why I was looking for you, actually. I need to know where to look. Help me help.”
Her eyebrows go up. “Then I suggest you have your mind healer send a certified letter to that effect to Auror Dawlish.”
Harry has no idea what that will be like; he just makes the clothes. Hair is still very much a mystery to him. Even more so now that, unfortunately, bad hair seems to have become something of a trend. Twice now, he’s had to talk Lavender and Pansy down from styling all his models with ‘the Harry Potter.’
When he’d wandered off to string together another unsuspecting pair of victims, Harry and Draco were left to entertain Miguela. She had dark, heavy eyes and a watchful expression that reminded Harry, uncomfortably, of Bellatrix Lestrange, but when she spoke, her voice was so low and smooth, and undeniably unlike Bellatrix’s that the feeling passed.
Abruptly, Hermione sighed. “But don’t worry about me. I’m just under a lot of pressure with this—” she grimaced, “stupid,
There was a pause, the only sound between them the shower sprays hitting tile at their feet. Then Malfoy said, “Are you going to watch your ex-girlfriend try out for the Slytherin team?”
last night. They’re here, and they want something, and the Queen seems to have an idea of what, if her ‘we all need to work together Sorting Hat song and dance’ bullshit was any indication, so we need to talk to her!”
“Oh, darling,” Harry said to her, when she stumbled piteously up to him for help. He helped her pull her head out of the sleeve and sent it back to the wardrobe again. She
Lee scoffed, and shook his dreadlocks back off his forehead. “Yeah right. You were collecting samples in a deep-sea dive two months ago. You’re just getting old.”
“Why?” asked Harry. He pushed back, feeling suddenly discomfited by Malfoy’s presence. Had he been leading Harry on this entire time? Had this all just been…part of the game?
He could pay rent on a decent Diagon Alley flat for two months with that kind of money. The league he and Ron had been looking at was only a ten galleon entrance.
“Dudley would’ve warned you, had he been there. This video spawned months of memes and internet jokes. It still gets some laughs, even three years later. You just revived the joke for people on the internet…worldwide.”
“That’s Chelsea for you,” Dudley groused, then nearly flew out of his seat when Man U made an attempt on goal and missed by a foot. Chelsea responded with some unsportsmanlike behaviour, no surprise.
“Don’t you ‘hey mate’ me when you’ve been gone three days, after exposing the entire wizarding world—“
I witnessed during your fourth year to remain clear of Dumbledore’s ears, and given his habit to gossip, the entire Ministry, then I suggest you desist.”
Harry had no idea. It really didn’t matter anyway since what came out of his mouth was, “I feel amazing!”
And just like that, Harry comes. He hadn’t even known he was close, hadn’t even got a chance to take more than a few cursory pulls at his cock, but there it is—he’s coming so hard his body curls, his arse clenching down around Malfoy’s cock, and his fingers digging into his biceps. Fuck, he hadn’t realized what a turn on it would be to hear Malfoy talk about his fucking clothing.
“Tell us what happened, from the beginning,” Malfoy ordered, and that, at least, seemed to snap her out of it enough to speak.
reprimanded for them refusing to speak to us about the case — was the only reason you were a more literal cocksucker afterwards! If you needed the excuse of annoyed goblins to act on your interest in me, then you’re a shit Gryffindor.”
Anything to get them off the subject of Hermione’s parents. It had taken her six months just to find them, and then with being back at Hogwarts, she hadn’t had a chance to go fix their memories until Christmas hols. Ron might’ve known this already, but he’d had Auror training and couldn’t take the time off to come with.
“The David Bowie poster in your loo,” Dudley said. “I mean, not that that’s a foolproof thing, but,” he trailed off, shrugging. “I haven’t seen the lad mags. You hide those better than the David Bowie.”
Adding Malfoy to an already Slytherin-heavy mix was just too much for Harry’s health and well-being.
“They also said it would be too expensive to stop polluting,” Lee added. “And that they had fish farms. I guess that was supposed to be an offset. Not sure how.”
Minerva stared at them for several more minutes. “And you’ve elected to take this ‘ICW task force business’ through alternative channels of communication why?”
He opened the door and nearly walked straight into Malfoy. They both jumped back, and that was the moment Harry noticed Malfoy was only in a towel, and had his toiletries bag in his free hand.
Harry had thought a night this good could never end, but then Hermione said she had to get Rosie home as she had more summer homework to finish, and Millicent had gone with them. Andromeda called for Teddy to be returned, and then it was just the two of them.
Hermione was unconcerned. “Will you really leave him to suffer for so long when you’re both obviously gagging for it?”
Harry nodded. He didn’t even care where Malfoy had got illegal Portkeys. He didn’t want to know. He just wanted everyone he loved to be able to live free and safe on the other side of this thing.
“That’s what I said!” Ron adds, taking another, happy bite of curry. It is really good. Mrs Weasley certainly hadn’t given her kitchen skills to Gin, so it had to go somewhere. “We’re going to Italy. Mum’s keeping Rosie. We’ll be back for Christmas.”
“First time for everything,” Harry said. “Now I’m here, I hope you won’t be distraught when you’re pushed out.”
Draco didn't even scold him. He just stood from his desk, and said, “I’ll let you read it over while I get some tea. We can talk about it after.”
Harry shook his head, swallowing. The truth was he’d not wanted to do anything at all that reminded him of Draco while they were apart. It was enough to see him at Quidditch League on Sundays. “Nah.”
He might’ve had a hangover the next day, but Ernie Macmillan turned out to be both the definition of Hufflepuff and a top notch potioneer. Harry was awoken on Saturday by his bed curtains flying open and Ernie, red and gold tie perfectly knotted even on the weekend, beaming down at him.
Maybe they were nervous, or just tired from all the landfills they’d been cleaning up, but the wave of magic flowing between them all took a long time to start up. The high druids were on their fifth round of the incantation song before the faintest glow started between their hands. When it happened, there was a rush of exhaled breaths, relief and exhaustion heavy in the air.
“Yeah? Bummer. So! You guys are here to solve some climate crisis, I guess? It’s really shitty over here. The Muggle government fights against it really hard, for like the stupidest reasons. It’s like they’re Nifflers with their heads in the sand looking for gold instead of noticing we got some pretty cool gold already. You should see the Adirondacks in the fall, man! If you’re still here, I’ll take you hiking for sure!”
“We have to hope for the best,” Hannah said. “It’s a risk worth taking to keep our magic, isn’t it?”
you have. Magic will know if you’re multi-tasking or not particularly caring about the outcome. You have to
Draco grinned, all sexy teeth and crinkly eyes. Harry died, perhaps, then struggled to maintain his best we’re-just-mates-and-I-only-love-you-like-a-bro face. “I know, moron. This time last year, you didn’t give a toss about Potions. It’s…”
“All of it,” she said, with a wry grin. He supposed he should’ve guessed that. He gave her a tentative smile back and she added, “Arithmancy, I suppose. You can do so many brilliant things with it. Spell creation, curse breaking, ward setting…amazing, unlimited magic.”
Water was the way to that. For a brief moment, he’d been interested in the blood magic that had let him keep his own life, but it had been, on the whole, much too creepy for him.
In the eighth year common room, Hermione was reading another letter from Ron with a distracted frown on her face. She looked up when he entered, and her expression changed to exasperated. “How does one handle post-relationship friendship with a Weasley?” she asked. “I’m sure I’ve no idea how it’s done.”
“I know you understand human languages, you cocksucker,” Millicent growled. “Where did your friend take him?”
They turned to Mr Granger, whose eyes were glued to the screen of the quiet telly. There was a huge fire burning in Atlantis. Words were flashing urgently across the bottom of the screen. Guards were battling the flames over smoking ruins of the castle, and in the sky, there were dozens of black ships.
Harry took hold of one of the coat rack’s branches, just as Malfoy was reaching for the same one. Their fingers brushed for a moment, and then, like normal people, they sorted themselves out without a word. Nothing awkward about it at all. He caught Dudley giving him a smirk across the coat rack and scowled at him, discomfited.
Hermione’s eyes narrowed. Harry immediately stopped laughing. “I was pregnant,” Hermione said, primly. “Rosie’s feet were on my bladder.”
Their breath mingled. Draco’s was slowing, thankfully, and now Harry could hear the background of silence all around them, how the ocean currents drifted by in echoing murmurings, how the movement caused by Hermione taking hold of the back of Harry’s shirt sent little warbly sounds spreading all around.
Millicent snorted. “Of course Dudley’s the one to drum up all the support,” she murmured. Dudley shot her a grin, which she returned.
“It’s no excuse,” she added hastily. “But I wanted you to know—there were many years when I was…not myself. I’m not even sure who I am now, or who I was supposed to be…but whatever happened, whatever your people did a few weeks ago, it helped me remember myself. And look…”
Harry didn’t care anymore. He was tired of getting fucked around, and more: he was tired of seeing the Mers get fucked around. The more he studied their water, the angrier he was. “Let them,” he said.
The camera people and reporters aimed their devices at the ritual grid, talking rapidly into their microphones as they narrated the scene.
“Of course I know what’s in seawater,” Harry said, refusing to think too deeply on how Draco had slipped and used his first name. It was too nice to contemplate just yet. “It’s water of course—hydrogen and oxygen—with a lot of chloride, sodium, sulfate, magnesium, calcium, and potassium making up the salts.”
Harry tipped his head, directing Draco’s attention to where Professor Sprout was gently Ennervating Fayth Walliams. “Sprout found us,” he said. “We probably would’ve slept right through it if she hadn’t."
But he didn’t. He ranted, raved, and threatened bodily harm to the Minister of Magic, but still, here he was in the Magically United States. Doing as he was told. He, Harry realised, was the reason political corruption was allowed to set in. He was the reason people got away with blackmail.
Dudley frowned. “I don’t think they all do. Some were speaking English to me while I was there—mind, I don’t remember much ‘cause I was so out of it—but I remember bits and pieces in English.”
Malfoy hmm’d. “It takes a lot of honesty to see yourself how you truly are. I suppose most of us don’t really understand why we were re-sorted.”
They stood, and Potter and Draco made their way out of her office and up to Potter’s rooms, while Millicent ran to her own to pack her necessities. From there, they called an elf to them—not Kreacher, since the Ministry would question him first—and sent her to gather Draco’s most important books, clothes, money, and a few treasured pictures of Astoria, Scorpius, and his parents. He wished he could tell Pansy where he was going; wished he could say goodbye to her. But he couldn’t put her in that position. He couldn’t drag her into scandal again, not when she’d finally redeemed her own name.
to Dr—Unspeakable Malfoy. And to Hermione, too. Plus, we need them for this. Can you let it slide just this once? Maybe it’ll be temporary.”
that he gets in his head and chest and wrists more than makes up for it. Draco closes the space between their bodies, his chest laying flat against Harry’s and he kisses the damp skin of his shoulder. Harry turns his head and their lips meet messily.
They hugged fiercely when Ron reached the bar. Harry’s robes soaked through from the contact, and Ron gave him a brief, apologetic smile.
Harry lost his balance and tipped forward out of his chair, tumbling to the hardwood floor of Draco’s office. His nose hit the wood first and he heard it crunch but he could barely spare a moment’s thought to the flare of pain because his guts felt like they were being unravelled and dragged west.
Luna beams at him. “Okily dokily. I’ll book them right away. I think they’ll be lovely with these acoustics.”
“Ah!” said Malfoy. “There it is.” He bent down to pick something up from between the two lion legs Harry’d been leaning against.
“14 new and exciting ways to please your wizard,” Dawlish drawls as he takes the seat next to Harry’s bed. “A holiday away from my bratty teenaged kids would be new and exciting; was that on the list?”
“I have to go back, Potter,” he said. “Without our family ancestor magic, the Malfoy line’s meaningless.”
they said.” She shrugs. “It’s true. I knew that going in. Just didn’t think you’d still be quite this fucking insane if you knew you weren’t partnered with a healing Auror anymore.”
“I like sporting,” Harry offered. He was certain his face was still flaming, from the heat of Draco’s kiss and the embarrassment of almost being caught. Coddler didn’t seem to notice. He flung measuring tapes all around, noting down Harry’s measurements with a practiced eye each time one of the tapes drew taut. A few taps of his wand and he had it on Harry’s shoulders and pinned up.
“We should start with the ones closest to major wizarding communities,” Anthony said. “They’re most liable to cause damage if they fail. We need to get those plastics as far away from Diagon Alley and Hogwarts as possible.”
Harry ignored him. He kept the liquor cabinet in his lab because… well, probably because he was stupid and invited explosions into his life, but there you go. He led them further into Grimmauld Place within the trunk, down to the basement and what used to be the kitchen.
“And just where would you have us go, Draco?” said Lucius, his eyes still following the article. “Your mother’s not allowed to leave the grounds and neither am I except for my...service.”
“See?” said Hermione. “It really only got worse from there. In the third month, we had to jump from brooms and trust that our partner would save us from the fall. I honestly wet myself then.”
“I don’t care, Potter,” Draco said. And then he was in front of Harry again, bearing down on him in a way that made Harry think of broom rides through Fiendfyre and heated romance.
Petunia shook her head. “I’m afraid of what will happen if he goes to the Embassy. The government still hasn’t acknowledged extraterrestrial presence on our planet, despite all the sightings. They still haven’t acknowledged magic, either. What if they quietly take him off to MI6 to question him or...or
Draco rolled his eyes. “Poor Potter,” he said. “You know so much and yet you know so little.” Deflecting again.
“‘Welcome’,” Ron says. “It’s usually written in graffiti, but once it was on a placard. Anyway, the first sentence clues you in that it’s coded, and then the second one gives the time and place. Then anyone who cracks it and wants to come, comes. It’s like BYOB, except the second B means ‘bomb’, not ‘beer’.”
Malfoy’s face went steadily more still, as if he were hiding all emotion but only slowly realising he needed to. “You admit to that?”
There’s no way Luna’s going to do that. She might be a bit loony, but her reputation in the field is excellent. Sighing, Harry looks at the Auror-in-Charge again.
Draco was apparently startled into a bark of laughter by Harry’s frankness. Or at least Harry hoped he was startled and not mocking him. He tried on a smile to prevent the awkwardness from setting in once Draco realised he hadn’t been messing about.
It wasn’t a lot of magic…but it was some. She had enough that she should’ve been able to go to Hogwarts. She might not’ve been the best student at DADA or Transfigurations, but she would’ve been able to master Potions and Herbology…even Charms with enough practice.
Emily Abbott was referencing a few of the books Harry had ordered for the Sett and her own ritual texts. “So if the ancient druids anchored it to certain species of plant life, but Muggle technology overcame that, that means Muggles created something that was stronger than whatever bond the druids formed.”
Dark Caravaggio backgrounds and tortured expressions suited the late Potions Master more than pre-Raphaelite idylls, at least.
“Since when are you anti-veg, Dudley?” Ginny, who was joining them as the official Ministry correspondent for the
Fortunately, given the long wait between turning in their notices and Padma and Theo’s Struggles and wedding actually taking place, they’d managed to hone a few skills with some themed party planning in the wizarding world, and a few small weddings in the Muggle one.
“But, Draco,” Luna said drowsily, barely lifting her head from the pile of poufs she’d gathered into a bed, “the nargles."
“Thought Harry could wand up something for you in this so you could get out of the castle a bit. You must be really bored only having those stuffy old portraits to talk to.”
!” Ron said before his words caught up to him, and he turned narrowed eyes on his daughter. “Cavorting?”
Harry chewed his lip. Against his will, he kept remembering what they’d done the night before, and it set his body alight all over again each time. He wanted to talk about it, to know what Malfoy was thinking, but neither of them brought it up. Harry didn’t think it was an awkward way, just a…‘We don’t have time to get into this’ kind of way. Which was pretty disappointing, considering how much Harry would definitely like to talk about it.
Harry exhaled heavily. “Draco, I was starting to feel at home there—with you. It felt like a place we could stay and live and I wanted it to be beautiful for you. It was worth the sacrifice at the time. It still is.”
Just then, Lee’s mobile began to buzz. He pulled it out and frowned at the screen. “It’s Kennedy Jones,” he said to them, before sliding his thumb across to answer.
Kyle arrived just then, still grinning as if it hurt him to close his mouth. “Draco, dude!” He pulled him into a manly hug, and then turned to Harry with his hand out. “Hey, man. Kyle Malfoy.”
“I rang Andromeda this morning and she told me Malfoy had to bring his Mum with him, and they were putting all of their properties in escrow and freezing all but his Hogwarts stipend account and his mother’s trust fund left over from her dowry. They only get their property back if we solve the problem. But Andromeda said it’s not the money—it’s the lack of ever being able to access the Malfoy family plots again. Apparently, there’s a lot of memory magic in the Malfoy family. The memories of their dead can be accessed by touching their tombs.”
“I am not shy!” Draco said. He allowed the sheet to loosen, though he made sure it still maintained his decency.
Harry scooped Severia out of his good cauldron and set her on the table. She stretched her toes out, and got comfortable, watching him lazily as he got the burner going and unrolled the mosses he’d been drying for two weeks.
“But that’s our land,” Malfoy said, gesturing out to the wheat field below. “That’s our tenant farmer and our wheat field and there are
“I didn’t get a chance to choose anything!” Draco yells. He whips around, his face white and blotchy. “I never got a choice! But—but maybe I would’ve made this one. I don’t know. I don’t remember. I never got the chance…”
He’d somehow forgotten, for the briefest of moments, how dangerous what they’d just done was. Maybe it was the act of being here with Potter, of all people. Potter, who he’d shared a bed and his own body with for weeks now. Potter, who was making sure his son stayed safe via a probably illegally bred Demiguise-Spaniel mutt.
Harry nodded mutely. As one, they let the hairs drop into the potion. They sunk to the bottom, and disappeared beneath the thick wine and detritus.
Finally, he spotted it. He waded in further, careful not to step on anyone, and peered in. There were a dozen or so multicolored seahorses swimming about. Harry carefully lowered the tank so that Seabiscuit could see through the glass.
Fleur and Theo siphoned off bits of gooey, black blood from his skin, talking in low voices all the while. They scanned the rest of his body and found more blood in his hair and on his pyjama bottoms. Then they went into Al’s room and quietly scanned Ms Danger, too. Harry was frankly amazed the boy hadn’t woken up yet, even with the quieting charms on his room. Luna had probably spelled him to sleep.
“Olwen, give me strength,” Malfoy muttered. The look he gave Harry was distinctly exasperated. “Really, Potter?”
Harry really had no idea, but the words were doing terrible things to him. Or maybe that was just the weighty look in Draco’s eyes.
Harry stopped swimming to pull out an empty vial. He filled it with water, capped it, and stuffed it back in his buttoned-pocket. There was likely a high amount of phosphorus or nitrate in the water here, if it was a dead zone. He’d have to check when he got back to the lab, but if the dead zone extended far into the bay, or was a regular occurrence, then that meant that this was a more serious problem than he’d thought.
The five remaining men stared back at him, some glumly, some angry. All without a Snitch. Harry shrugged apologetically. “Best of luck,” he said, and felt ridiculous. He turned and escaped up to his hotel room as soon as Luna gave him a thumbs up.
“If the right person comes along, I guess. When Gin and I divorced, I didn’t think I’d be interested. She was—is—my best friend. Not easily replaced, you know?”
The adrenaline-fueled fear and excitement they’d all felt last night after working their magic seemed inconsequential in light of today’s news. What was one missing landfill when the world had this to deal with?
On that, Harry had to agree. Then Vic, the league leader, brought up the first auction. Harry listened to the sounds in the Broomsticks sour as Gina threw down three hundred points for Mykonos Young, and the conversation heated up. Harry settled in next to Malfoy, sipping his secret butterbeer, and was utterly content for the first time in ages. He didn’t think of Ron once.
They spent some time exploring the rock and, for a rock, it was pretty fun. Luna educated them on the structure of Uluru and its connection (mysterious) to Kata Tjuta. Hermione supplemented this with a steady, cited, monologue of refutations, which she said under her breath and to Harry only. That Malfoy seemed to hover nearby and snort with laughter every now and again was something he tried to ignore.
He wonders if they could’ve fixed this if they’d tried harder. He wonders if they’ve wasted the last eighty-nine years of their lives waiting for the other to move first. He wonders if he should’ve never fallen in love with Draco and if he hadn’t, if maybe he’d have lived a happy life.
Malfoy looked over his shoulder, and then returned to unloading his homework from his satchel. “Surely, you didn’t think that a family as old as mine has survived over a thousand years with only one heir per generation?” he said, but there was no bite to it, just casual curiosity. He found his Transfigurations textbook and tossed his bag beside his bed before settling in at his desk.
She gave them a small smile, her eyes heavy. “I would not have, were it not for Severus’s counsel. He has explained much of the strange thinking of modern people, which does not excuse the behaviour of your compatriots, but does explain it.” She seemed to think for a moment, chuckled, and added, “I hope this meeting will be a welcome reprieve from the sudden aggression of the rest of the world.”
“Any idea what’s in it, then?” asked Draco, and Harry looked at him gratefully, and—inappropriately—aroused. It was so bloody hot when Draco was on the same wavelength as him. It was like they were quartz, resonating at the same frequency.
“I got a letter from Murdoch,” Draco said, his lip snarled. “He wants a progress report. I told him to ask Kennedy Jones for it because I was busy.”
As one, they jumped back, and Harry stumbled against one of the rickety, old student desks. Draco grabbed him before he could fall, and they turned to face the Fiendfyre again.
“The third cloak is the same, minus the trim and with arm slits added in, for easier spell-working. A more… sporting version of the other, if you will. My newest line.”
It wasn’t like everyone could be decent just because it was decent. It took all sorts, he supposed. “As long as we come up with something. Anything. We can’t just sit here—not now, not knowing what we know.”
Harry had not realised how much he needed—or wanted—Malfoy until these past few months. Malfoy had come in—slithered in, really—and attached himself to the one open port in Harry’s life: someone else who really saw the world for what it was, for what it wasn’t. For what it could be, and what it needed to be that.
“I told you we’re all gay,” Draco muttered. Was it Harry’s imagination or did Draco look right at him when he said that?
“Brill!” Harry said, a saying he’d picked up from one of his godchildren. He scrambled back from the hearth and beamed when Draco stepped out of the flames.
Harry said, “I keep waiting for something to happen, for the Muggles to suddenly figure it all out. It’s like we’re in this holding pattern—“
And then Draco activated the compass, returning them to the original leypoint, where Narcissa and the others would no doubt already be waiting. Harry’s body twisted into nothingness while his love for Draco spun out to fill the entire universe.
“No, we won’t,” said Harry, standing. “Ron signed me up for this stupid thing and you went with me the whole way. Consider this my retribution. Or Rosie’s gap year fund. Or buy yourself a holiday home in Hawaii; we’ve never been
“Then it’s a good thing I saw a bottle of it locked up in Uncle Sev’s personal supply room a few years ago.”
Harry nods, feeling his throat close up. He pushes in a little further, and then a little more, and when Draco starts rocking back against him, he can barely control himself as he slides in the last few inches. He falls over Draco’s back, trembling with suppressed need to fuck Draco into the mattress, and attempts to get himself under control. He never gets the chance. Draco starts fucking himself on Harry’s prick, his hands clenched in the sheets, the words coming from his mouth the most filthy things Harry’s ever heard, and they aren’t even in English.
“I assure you, Potter,” said Malfoy, as he jotted down a note in green ink (the same colour ink Harry liked), “you are average at personality, too.”
Malfoy nodded. “We’ve made good progress.” He took a deep breath, gave Harry a searching look. “I think we can do this, Potter.”
“Better get used to it, Malfoy,” Ron said, chewing on an apple. “This is your life for the next three weeks.”
Petunia cocked her head. “That sounds vague, but also an easy thing to pledge, so you should have some luck. You should set it up like a petition that people can sign to pledge. I can show you a website for it. After that, it’s just a matter of sharing it and getting people to see it.”
Harry watched Draco. His breathing was slowing, but his eyes still looked wild, and Harry knew that the terror he showed was not even half of what he felt. Harry tightened his arms once, a hidden reminder that Draco was safe. Safer — which was “safe” in Harry’s world.
“Why?” She looked like a perfectly normal cat to Harry. And everyone liked kittens, didn’t they? Even if they looked like they were wearing NHS glasses and had astigmatism?
But he was past that now, and he could see the value in things he’d have once spurned. Like his Animagus form.
Ginny looked to Hermione as if sharing something profound, and said, “We like the same Quidditch players. It should’ve been a dead giveaway.”
“Definitely not.” He stared down at his books, cursing himself for being such an idiot. There was nothing wrong with being an Auror. It was the sort of thing he did. He could be good at it. It could be
He digs one of Hermione’s omnipresent bottomless bags from the back of a kitchen cupboard and begins stuffing things in it, starting with his shrunken wardrobe, then his favourite chair, toiletries, his television, all of his gaming consoles, all of his games except for
He was right there. And then Malfoy moaned, his bollocks tightening against Harry’s knuckles, his shaft throbbing and that was all it took. Harry fell over the edge, his orgasm surging through him, over and over.
Harry rolled his eyes. “I feel really useless, though. I don’t know anything about spell-crafting. I don’t even know how we’d do this spell. There’s no wand movements or anything—is it really all just chanting and…I don’t even know what this part is,” he said, gesturing vaguely at the transcribed spell.
It reminded Harry, strangely, of living with the Dursleys, and those hot nights he’d hid out in the back garden to escape them for a few hours.
“Well, that’s definitely accidental magic,” Ron said, taking another Chocolate Frog. He was more inclined to eat with them at the Hufflepuff table now that there was a constant supply of chocolate to hand at every meal (and in between them). “Merlin, there’s been a lot of breaks of the Statute recently. Why aren’t the Obliviators doing anything?”
Hermione took it, licked her lips. “I notice you don’t speak like the house-elves where I’m from. Do you know why that is?”
Harry shifted uncomfortably. So far, they’d been able to mostly avoid this conversation by mutual agreement, especially given that Mrs Weasley had issued the invitations to begin with. But with wine came truth, and all that. It was, Harry reckoned, bound to come up sooner or later.
Harry looked to Hermione and Lee. Hermione returned his look with a clear signal that he wasn’t yet forgiven. “Shall we get them in before reporters are tracking our every move?”
There was so much there, so many things that he had no idea how to explain. He could drink the Elixir for a thousand years and never have enough time to explain to Draco all the fragmented thoughts running through his head at the sight of the mirror and the wardrobe. They'd
Kennedy gave them a pointed look. “Well, as you can see, they have. There were 804 souls on board, and not a one lived. No Magicals, so far as we know. This is the first incident that has claimed American lives, and we’re having a devil of a time keeping it out of the papers. The NoMajes believe it was a hurricane. There weren’t any storms in the area at the time. We had to alter a number of memories to get the media to report that Hurricane Hanna followed that path and was a Cat 5 at that longitude.”
“We’re strange foreigners walking through a capital city that hasn’t seen visitors in millennia. Of course we’re being watched,” said Draco. He did manage to avoid rolling his eyes.
Draco spun to him, his face a mask of fury. “What’s wrong?” he hissed. “Your bloody Gryffindor emotions are what’s wrong. Is there
She and Draco were incredibly close. He’d never known it before this year, but it must’ve been there all along, as comfortable as they were with one another. Slytherins were discreet like that.
Draco regards him as one might a Potions experiment that’s gone unexpectedly sentient. Strange, interesting, and possibly worth a Paracelsus Prize.
When they got close enough, Lee took the lead, bowing to her and saying a few words in stilted Celtic Mer, which he’d learned from Hermione last night.
want to be arrested by MACUSA when you’re on a Terrorist Watch List, Potter,” Draco snarled. “If you get arrested here, you’ll be in Guantanamo Bay without a trial and no one will ever see your sorry arse again—and that’s
The cat blinked at him, once. Then it turned and set off directly for the path that led back to the castle.
The alarmed look left Harry’s face to be replaced by one of amusement…and maybe arousal. “You’re better at that than me now. It’s hot.”
If Draco had been consulted, he would have started talks with a less aggressively sized party. Two or three key people to meet with the Queen and establish rapport, develop trust between their nations.
Draco’s hands came up automatically around him and held him there. Harry settled in, nosing against Draco’s cheek.
Harry’s eyes darkened. He could feel the arousal settling into his body like a hot, dark blanket. “What will you do with that?” he asked softly.
“I felt like I was back there—but when it was new. The homes and buildings in Atlantis were made from the same stone, exact same architectural style as those damned pillars, but Atlantis existed almost 12,000 years prior. How could Greece have been so similar?
“We’ve always been these houses,” Harry said, looking around the Great Hall at the students in their new colours. Malfoy and Neville caught his eye again. Neville he could see in Hufflepuff with him, but, “I can’t figure Malfoy out. What’s he doing here?”
She gestured to all the flowers growing in windowsills, and the unnatural winter garden out front of her house. “I think it was wearing off for awhile now, but something snapped the last of it off. And—I just want you to know I’m grateful for whatever your people did to give me back this connection to my sister. And for taking Dudley in, letting him be part of your world even though he’s…he’s not magic. And—and I’m sorry, for how I treated you. It’s no excuse, but…I’m sorry. You are welcome here anytime.”
“They thought we’d destroyed ourselves with magic because that was always their fear…that magic and technology could never mix without destruction.
“Sleeping in is unlike you,” Harry said over his shoulder as he stepped into his pants. “Is it daylight savings this weekend?”
This had not happened in Gryffindor. There, it’d been every lion for itself, and Harry had most often been an outsider. They weren’t going to let him be an outsider here. He was welcome, whether he liked it or not. He didn’t know what to make of that.
Harry pushes himself up onto his elbows. He shakes his fringe out of his eyes. He’s lost his hat somewhere between the bar and here and isn’t even arsed about it, even though it’s his favourite ivy cap.
Teddy’s face, which had begun to crumple, perked up again. “Brill! Maybe Mr Durjtak will be there, too.”
Malfoy nodded, looking relieved. They finished their drinks, the crackling fire the only sound to break the quiet.
On Christmas morning, Harry woke to the streaking orange glow of a Cannons chaser zooming around on the poster on the ceiling. Which wasn’t surprising, since he’d fallen asleep to the same sight, not six hours ago. He groaned, and rolled over, shoving a pillow over his head to block out the nuisance.
“Well, the burr was present, as I said,” said Malfoy. He shrugged, faux-unconcerned. Harry could tell the difference in Malfoy though; he’d always been able to. “She assured me it wasn’t legal, that the Minister was bluffing, that how dare he, and what nerve, and
“I suppose it would be for both your parents, wouldn’t it?” she said. They started down the stairs leading into the dungeons and her Gryffindor side showed through loud and clear as she skipped down the steep steps while looking back at him, waiting for his reply.
Harry manfully didn’t give him the pleasure of a response. “Have you heard anything from Murdoch?” he asked instead. “Ron sent me a text… seems like something’s weird over there.”
Draco looked relieved. “Thank Merlin. I thought you were going to go on a moral rant and I’d have to do it behind your back.”
Harry sighed. “It was hinted that the Minister didn’t know if he could trust anyone who would associate with someone who’d ignore an international crisis. Which was code, of course, for ‘We’ll fire Ron and Arthur Weasley and good luck to Hermione ever securing research funding for werewolves again.’”
Draco didn’t reply, just reached up with his free hand and plucked one of Harry’s hairs. He held it out over the cauldron next to the one of his own that Harry held. “Ready?” he asked.
But not nearly as unsettling as Atlantis literally resurfacing from beneath the sea, and—yes, there it was. It was sinking in now.
Malfoy burst out laughing, the action totally transforming his face, from pointy to terribly dear. Harry swallowed, discomfited.
“Thank you for joining us tonight as we ask the wild magic to acknowledge our daughter Padma’s intended marriage to Theodore Nott. We welcome your good wishes for a positive outcome and encourage you all to pour a glass of whatever you brought and raise it in toast at the ceremony’s conclusion. Thank you, once again.”
Harry grabbed the teacup. But when the Portkey landed, they weren’t standing out front of Grimmauld Place. They were in a room Harry’d never seen before, but he could immediately tell was in Hogwarts. There was light streaming in from windows overlooking the Forbidden Forest, a tidy walnut writing desk, and a couple of cosy chairs around the hearth. A door beside the fireplace led to a polished white loo, and another began a hallway Harry was sure would end in a bedroom.
“A long time ago,” she said, and he frowned, realising only in that moment how much he’d wanted to hear Snape was, somehow, against all odds, alive. “I was six or seven, walking home from school and I cut through an alley to get home sooner. I heard yelling, saw an old woman yelling at Severus and his mother in the street. I watched them for a time, until Severus and his mum went inside, and then the old woman spotted me—she aimed her wand at me and cast a nasty-looking spell, but somehow I jumped out of the way…landed on the roof of the house beside me. She looked so mean…and stunned. Surprised. Then she cast another spell at me, and this one hit me, and I tumbled off.”
“Which area should we focus on then? There were seven problems that alchemists generally concerned themselves with. In fact, there’s a decent biography on Flamel in the library that covers his mastery of each of them—”
It’s just that he values his life and would at least like to see his daughters born before their grandparents put a hit on him.
Its face was long and thin, with a weak chin—a community that subsisted on soft, prepared foods that didn’t require much chewing. The cranium was much larger than a human one, and looked unwieldy perched as it was over such a gangly, weak-looking body. But there was a mouth in the right place, and a nose that reminded him more of the Dark Lord than normal humans, and two closed eyes above it—one beginning to bruise an awful shade of black from Millicent’s punch. It had no hair anywhere on its body that Draco could see. He had no idea if it was male, female, or if there wasn’t a sex at all. For all he knew, these beings didn’t reproduce like humans.
Just then, a huge, echoing explosion rent the air, shaking the walls of the cave. Granger looked around nervously. Weasley cast a shielding spell around them all in case the caves collapsed, and kissed Granger hard before retreating to a magically-safe distance.
Some time later, Fleur and Theodore Nott exited the flames, potions kits in hand. By then, the barest beginnings of daybreak were lighting up outside. It was Halloween.
Lee shrugged and bit into it, chewing thoughtfully. Harry took the opportunity to test his water with a quick, inconspicuous charm. The results didn’t shock him, but he did curl his lip a bit. Always so much chlorine!
solution – or if they had, they weren’t sharing it. Shutting down factories sure as hell wasn’t going to help. But Harry and his Hufflepuffs couldn’t work with the Ministry on this. It might very well break the Statute of Secrecy. They would spend the rest of their lives in Azkaban for it.
“Dudley’s her pride and joy,” Harry said, feeling suddenly and unaccountably very sad for his aunt. “She’ll definitely talk about him.”
“Yeah,” said Draco. “Death is the catalyst. It’s the Azoth that we were missing. It was good that I died.”
“Can I be white and blonde?” Harry asked, hopefully. “With a nice figure and a pretty face, too. Basically, make me look like Hannah Abbott.”
“But he did not execute anyone; he saw that our Creators were no longer just a people looking to save themselves, but a people so afraid, so paranoid, that they’d become the monsters they feared. My father set out to find every single person with magic in his kingdom, and bring them together to create a shield between us, so they would not be able to see our magic.”
Harry looked to Ron. Ron shrugged. “What? We’ve been partners for seven years. Don’t tell me you never noticed.”
Harry scowls, brushes past her to go to his desk, where he finds the folder Malfoy’d brought him on Friday afternoon. He wants to swipe it off the desk in a flurry of melodrama, but when he tries, he finds that it’s also been stuck to the wood. Demelza smiles at him again.
Petunia shrugged, looking miserable. Her fingers curled around the china like thin, pale vines looking for purchase and not finding any. Millicent gave Harry a pointed look and he grimaced. It was not easy trying to make conversation with his aunt, but they were here for a purpose.
“You look swaggery,” Draco said, choking on his laughter. Harry attempted to swing his hips like Hermione did, but ended up tripping and nearly smashing Miguela’s face into the floor. “Professor—really, this is quite enough. What am I going to do for an hour, like this?”
“Wow,” Harry said, eyebrows raised. He was imagining Ron trying to explain the balance of his Gringotts vault in galleons and sickles to the Grangers, and having very little luck.
And tomorrow night was another one of them. If he really loved Draco, which he was beginning to suspect he very well might, then how was he going to make it through tomorrow night? How was he going to make it through Christmas? It was bad enough when he’d thought he simply wanted Draco, that he was simply mad at him for hurting Teddy’s chances at Gringotts.
She blinked at him. “Because you’re fine, your magic’s fine, we’re all home—well, Lee’s not—and Murdoch’s been impeached. He’s resigning on Friday. You can thank Narcissa for that. And you can also thank her for getting you cleared of charges with MACUSA and taken off the No Fly List. Her Mr Redfellow was a MACUSA agent working to uncover information that would prove the British Ministry was messing with American affairs. She’d tipped off the Aurors here, and they’d tipped off MACUSA and sent Redfellow to work with her.”
Draco wrinkles his nose, but Harry knows he’s dreading his parents finding out just as much as Harry is the Weasleys, so he considers it. After a moment, Draco huffs. “Alright, Harry.” Harry grins. Then Draco says, “But my hormones are ridiculous. Come fuck me. No wait, I want to fuck you before I get too fat.”
Potter yawned, pushed himself up to sitting. He snapped his fingers, illuminated by the blue light of Draco’s time charm, and his wand sailed into his hand. “
. He couldn’t say that it had been a bad choice. Their friendship was fading now, but for seven years, it had been the brightest thing in Harry’s life. Now it was soft and worn, but where the knowledge of it had once made Harry warm, it now left him with a clammy, resigned feeling like he was developing a cold.
“You’re noticeable,” Harry said, swallowing. “Your absence would have been more so.” He turned back to look at Draco again. It was almost painful to see his face. He’d been so sure, so agonisingly sure, that he’d lost Draco. He’d take a thousand dislocated shoulders to make sure it never happened again. Harry set the Philosopher’s Stone on the bedside table, and Draco’s eyes followed the movement.
Malfoy didn’t bother looking away from the skyline. “As if it’s any different from how you normally are around me.”
“So you did!” she said, and Harry heard the sound of parchment fluttering. He pulled her portrait out and craned his neck over the frame. She was waving the very same letter she always read when she was annoyed with him. “I’ve the letter right here! ‘Dear Wally,’ you write. ‘I regret to inform you that I have been appointed to the Supreme Court of the United States and must serve my country, therefore I shan’t be returning to London for our wedding. All the best, cousin Hugo.’”
Ron’s his best friend, but even he can’t know about their relationship. No one can. Not when Apex… And anyway, it doesn’t matter now because there
By some miracle, he managed to get to the spare Potions classroom before Malfoy, and even had his practise cauldron set up on the fire, carefully heating to a rumbling simmer.
Malfoy’s eyebrows shot up, but he never got a chance to say whatever sneering remark came to mind because their Portkey activated. Harry kept his mouth firmly closed and pretended he was anywhere but on a spinning Portkey, with anyone but Malfoy, and that he’d eaten anything but fish for breakfast. He really wished there was such a thing as a spell for seasickness.
“Hey, champ,” Harry said, ruffling his pink hair. He’d taken to colouring it like Tonks’ after Mothering Sunday this year, and had yet to change it to another colour. “What’ve you been up to?”
Severia shifted in her sleep, stretching out as if she owned the place—the place being Harry’s arms—which she probably did. But Harry had a feeling they were both trying to pull the wool over, so he set her down on the floor. She blinked sleepily at him for a moment, and then, with whatever the cat-equivalent was to a shrug, she pressed her front paw to the portrait. The gentleman in the Botticelli reached down and scratched at his canvas by her cheek. She obligingly rubbed against it, mrewed once, and the portrait swung open.
“I bet it really stings if you get a cut in that lake,” Lee said thoughtfully. “Imagine all the salt.”
Harry felt his face heating. He hugged her back, and then gently steered her back in the direction of the canteen. Those chocolate bourbons were calling his name. “Well, I’m picking Teddy up after work. Why don’t you and Rosie come over for dinner and then she can stay? I’ll get her to day school tomorrow and you’ll have the night to yourself.”
Severus looked, for the first time Draco had ever seen, conflicted. In fact, perhaps it was a defect in the painting because surely it couldn’t be an artefact of the man himself. “You should speak to Her Majesty again.”
“Think nothing of it,” Ron said blithely. He tilted his head, regarding Harry. “You know, don’t think I didn’t notice that money getting deposited to our accounts last Monday. A million galleons doesn’t just slip in unnoticed.”
“It really is! Very nice!” came chorus of replies, and breakfast resumed. Next to him, Harry felt Lavender deflate in relief, which was great and all, but it still remained one of the most uncomfortable meals of his entire life. And he’d had to eat Hermione’s camp cooking for nine months.
“No preventative measures at all beyond this lighthouse and a sign. I guess they’re only worried about invasions from Mexico,” Blaise surmised. He shrugged, hopped over, then hopped back.
Across the table, a representative witch from the British Ministry gave them both a dirty look. Potter affected extreme interest in Mr Kurzschluss’s continued warbling.
Harry didn’t much care about all that. He cared about the way Draco looked at him when Padma started speaking to Nott’s grandparents.
There was a pregnant silence. It took him a moment to parse the treacly words and find the meaning beneath. “So you’re saying that none of me is
“I was staying at Dudley’s tonight—we were up late watching the Man U game. We stayed up a bit longer…” She waved a hand, apparently to encompass ‘fucking’. “And I went for a shower. Dudley was already in bed…it must’ve been gone midnight by then. I came out, and the lights were out, but I heard something strange. Then Dudley started yelling, and I ran into the bedroom, and there were these…these
And then she was gone. The door shut softly behind her. Harry stared at it for several moments, mind curiously blank.
when she dies, just as Draco deserves him to feel it when Harry binds his own heart to him, however willingly or unwillingly. Just as Harry deserves to feel that moment when his real love is sucked away to be consumed into a construct, a golem, a tangible misery built up into a sacrifice for the man he loves.
“Potter, this is a reconnaissance mission which our entire world hinges on, not a hen party!” Malfoy snapped.
She eyed him narrowly. “He’s going to be devastated when he finds out Malfoy’s your new Ron, you know.”
“But the point is, Harry,” she said, finally, “we did enough. You didn’t need to know everything for it to still be a worthwhile experience.”
Their shoulders brushed as Harry stepped through, and he suppressed a shiver as best he could. It was like Draco’s skin was made of the same quartz, piezoelectric and attuned specifically to Harry. The Botticelli shut behind them, and Harry headed for his settee, but a hand on his shoulder jerked him to a stop.
Hermione tapped some more, bottom lip between her teeth. “All right, let’s try this place. It’s back near the Tube. Should be much quicker without our bags.”
It was strange, but the Hufflepuffs had a thing about calling one another by first names, at least outside of the Sett. It’d never been overtly stated that this was the done thing, but somehow it was obvious enough that even Harry and Draco caught on to it, and they’d been using first names without fail – albeit only within a classroom setting or when no one else could hear them.
A Botticelli, eh? He’d thought it was just a handsome bloke who liked to wink at him when he said his password.
“You dress me like I’m your fantasy, Potter,” Malfoy says. Harry freezes with his tape measure only inches from the top of Malfoy’s inseam. He looks up, but Malfoy’s staring fixedly ahead.
Harry suspected the excitement would taper out over the next week to a dull thunder, and he hoped opinions would settle as positive views of magical people before Harry, Millicent, and Malfoy needed to ask for their help. So far, no militaries had made further advances against Atlantis—or other magical communities. But it was early hours still. Only a portion of people seemed to think magical people were aliens, but that ratio could easily flip in the wrong atmosphere.
She looks up, her eyes shining. She looks afraid to blink and Harry doesn’t blame her. “Am I really that messy?”
When his breathing is under control again, he pulls slowly out and flops onto the bed beside Draco, grinning beatifically. Last night was fantastic and this morning is fantastic and Draco is fantastic and Harry’s life, on the whole, is suddenly incredibly fantastic. He turns to look at Draco, still grinning.
Harry sat back. “I can understand that. Really. But what I don’t get is the ICW trying to overcompensate for a potential breach by doing a global fucking
Harry grimaced. No, he wasn’t. He wasn’t anything close to okay. His head was spinning with a hundred different terrifying future paths, like he was a ruddy seer or something. And just like Trelawney, none of the futures he saw were good ones.
“So you wanted me to clear you,” Luna says. He nods and she blinks at him. “Well, are you ready to be cleared?” He nods again. She blinks once more. “What’s the meaning of life, Harry?”
. His vision flares, then narrows down, black seeping in from all edges. Malfoy fucks him hard, each thrust hitting mercilessly against his prostate. He jerks Harry’s cock in rhythm and it’s all too much—Harry comes.
“How?” asked Justin, who was probably the most likely to have access to higher Muggle math and the internet during summers home.
, today, and I am a vindicated man. I am ready to die now. When I reach Hell, and I meet your father there, I will greet him, and I will say, ‘Potter, I taught everything I knew to your son, little Potter, and he nearly became a Potions Master. But your genes won out, stubborn as they were, and he’s dead now. He
Magic flowed above them, swirling the air like the Aurora Borealis. Harry had never seen anything more beautiful.
He clenched his fingers, and Draco reached down with one hand to take hold of his own prick. Harry batted it away with a growl, and replaced it with his own slicked fingers.
“Oh, right,” said Neville, who remarkably seemed bolstered by this. He shoved the ring box in his pocket, pulled it out quickly to check one more time that the ring was actually still in the box, and then put it in his pocket again. He flung himself on his bed and sighed happily. “She’ll say yes."
Harry, too, was unimpressed. There was something about killing a dark lord and then having to return for A-Levels that really turned a man about. Add losing his very identity, the one thing that he’d always been happy to identify himself as – not the “Boy Who Lived,” not the “Defeater of Voldemort,” not even “Harry,” but just “Gryffindor” – and he was, roughly, a doxy’s arsehole from going off the deep end.
Draco’s fight left him all in a rush, and he slumped down at the kitchen table, summoning Harry’s half-drank beer and finishing it off. Harry picked Ron’s up and sat down across from Draco, watching his long, pale fingers run rings around the condensation on the wood.
Malfoy grinned. “Cowardly Gryffindor, hm? I always knew you were no braver than the rest of us. One tiny little abduction attempt and you need a nightlight for the rest of your life.”
He slid off Draco’s lap and took his hand to pull him up. Draco led him down that hallway that did indeed end in a bedroom, and as Harry began to unbutton Draco’s shirtsleeves, he felt the flood come again. Drowning his senses with too much emotion like the Mers had drowned Baltimore. But this was different. Before the flood, you lived in fear. But after the flood, you could begin to build. Harry began to build.
