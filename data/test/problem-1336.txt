“Um, hello?” Weasley started. “Harry, do you know who that is?”
"I'm older. I’m
"I—I panicked. S-sorry."
as an apology i added a special scene of harry's pov of him pining.
"Draco?!" Tonks cried, trying to flip onto his back. "Are you there? What's wrong? Whatever it is, fight it! I know you can!" She yelped and cradled Draco to her chest as another spell shot mere inches away from her head.
“Very,” Michael breathed.
“No!”
Hermione fell silent, eyeing him. “Alright, fine. But I’ll hold you up to that.”
There was an overdue talk with Harry to be had.
“Polyjuice Potion?” Draco repeated.
“What?"
When has he ever stuttered this badly before? "Harry, I really, really--"
"What happened?" Draco paled.
He wanted to ask about Andromeda.
that. But… I couldn’t risk it. Because-Because I couldn’t risk it! Draco, you mean so much to me. I've liked you for forever! Alright, I spent countless nights wondering if it was okay to think that my best friend had the most pretty eyes I’ve ever seen or—or why my stomach felt like knots every time you were even near. Or why I was obsessed when you tucked your hair behind your ear and it would just fall back in place! I don’t even know how many times I tried to tell you before the Yule Ball and you never even noticed. If anything, that should’ve told me to get a clue that--"
Draco made a face before he had a shattering moment of clarity. Oh, she knew someone. Oh, Merlin, she knew someone that wanted to ask him. Draco’s heart leapt. Someone wanted to ask him to the Yule Ball. Draco’s body was sent out of order. His heart thumped, his stomach fluttered, his face was on fire. Who? Who did she know?
"What is it?"
“Though I doubt it’s something that
Fourth year was the tipping point. It was when everything took a turn for the worst and began the most terrible years of Draco’s life. But he could make things better. Cedric Diggory doesn’t have to die by the Dark Lord. He could save a life. No mistakes could be made. And he isn’t going to make any.
“No… But I could!”
“Tonks?” Draco called out.
"Come on, we don't have much time!" He yelped when the slippery cloth was suddenly thrown over his head.
Ron took it out of her hands, looking over it. The blonde male seemed to go back and forth from the Penelope to Hermione.
“Uh,” Draco said. “Alright, then.” He turned back to the other boy who was staring at the retreating backs of their friends. “So… How’s your summer?”
Ron and Hermione were on the floor, Ron was laying down with his head cradled in Hermione’s lap, her arms crossed over his chest. They were giggling about something.
“How?”
Snape’s jaw swelled and Draco could hear his teeth clicking together. "Get some rest, Draco." He only said and left.
He was fine, Draco knew that. Why was reacting like he didn’t know that Harry didn’t die this year…
When the room flashed again, there was nothing there. “I had a nightmare,” Draco gasped. “Nothing new.”
They all settled as London started to flatten into rolling green hills and Anthony was telling stories about his Bar Mitzvah. “So my family enchanted a chair to do the lifting right, so it was my uncle’s turn to be lifted and do you know what he does? This man? This man has a
“Give him a moment.” Anthony’s words were the last thing Draco heard before the wind picked up and separating them from the blond.
Playing matchmaker was… fun.
“Harry Potter, I swear to Merlin! I--”
feel about Harry? Not Harry’s feelings. Just yours. I mean, would you even have those types of feelings for a boy in the first place?”
“Too bad, I need to talk.” Draco moved over to his bookcase, trying to find a book that wasn’t about Pureblood etiquette. “Harry Potter is this round glasses wearing, idiot Gryffindor that most likely got me into this mess.”
Terry pursed his lips and hesitated. “Fine, I’ll tell her you’re coming.”
“You don’t have to ask!” Anthony placed his book face down and climbed out of bed. He went to Draco’s other side and Draco’s face smothered against Anthony’s collarbone.
Madam Pomfrey's treatment of his ribs was quick and almost completely painless. Draco was settling into his bed after Pomfrey ordered bedrest when an unconscious Harry was carried in by Dumbledore, Sirius following and being carried by a Minister Fudge, Snape and Hermione trailing behind them four.
Harry hesitated, it didn't feel right to give Draco the diary. An instinct in the back of his head was telling him,
. "I'm sorry for whatever my family has done in the past."
“Yeah, yeah, shut it.” Harry sighed and pulled the drapes closed. “Crazy bat.”
Draco only smirked before tucking into dinner. Low noises of chatter and sounds of slurping filled the kitchen. Draco savoured Mrs Weasley's excellent cooking. Yet he felt himself constantly glancing over at Harry who was smiling brightly while talking with Sirius.
“What kind of weird?”
“Mister Malfoy,” McGonagall acknowledged him, before gazing at Harry, confused.
They watched as Cedric cleanly transfigured a rock to a bouncing dog to distract the dragon. Draco leaned forward when the dragon quickly lost interest and neared Cedric enough to burn half his face, but he nonetheless captured the golden egg. There was a special interest from the crowd for Fleur’s turn. Her turned ended swiftly with a quick sleeping charm with only a mild accident of setting her tunic on fire. Michael held up a banner proudly displaying Viktor Krum’s name as the boy stepped out.
Harry was already there and had a seat saved. His hand holding up his head as he lazily jotted something down on his parchment. (Draco doubted it was schoolwork.)
The rest of the time leading up to the holiday break was students practically crawling over each other so they wouldn’t get in his way. As if they stared at him too long, they’d be turned to stone. Anthony, Terry, and Michael didn’t even seem the slightest bit phased that the entire school thought one of their best friend attacked those people.
“Yeah... Draco Malfoy! That’s it!” George exclaimed.
”Mister Malfoy?” Lupin’s voice asked. Through blond hair, Draco peeked up to the werewolf.
Well… it wasn’t until February. Harry'll get there eventually.
"Well, Mr. Malfoy--very unfortunate--my condolences--"
He furrowed his brow. “What are you--” A dry, unforgiving tree branch smacked into Draco’s chest. He flew back, colliding with hard ground and a flare of pain ached his side. Panicking shrieking made Draco loosened his tightened hold on Scabbers. Drawing in a deep breath found to be painful.
“And your point?”
“Uh, sure. I’d like that. Yeah.” Harry cleared his throat, then repeated, “I’d like that.”
“Do not tell another soul.”
"Mate, I think you can lay them off for this one day." Weasley kept a firm arm around Draco, neither of them seeing the glance from Harry as he was about to knock the door. Granger was barely in when Hagrid shut the door on them. It was boiling in the small hut. Draco's hair was already feeling limp and sweat prickled on the back of his neck.
“Wait, you know Tonks?”
Harry pulled Draco into the hallway that hid them from both Sirius and Tonks.
"Anything for a fellow Ravenclaw," Cho smiled.
"Brilliant lesson today, Harry," Cedric said. "I think I've been taught things in these meetings than half the time I've been here at Hogwarts."
Draco's nerves made him stumble a little harder as he and Tonks landed in front of Grimmauld Place. He stared up at the townhouse and felt like it was looming over him.
“Hold on!”
It wasn’t exactly the satisfying comfort of his mother. Anthony didn't comb his hair with his fingers like his mother or give him sweet words into his ear, but it did make him feel secure. Draco’s stiffness slowly became lax. Anthony patted his arm once, twice.
Draco felt his tense shoulders relax. A logical approach to add to his cumulation of offhand research from the library. It was better than nothing. Maybe he could figure out once and for all why the universe felt so insist on certain events.

A loud
"No," the three chorused. She groaned but then saw Draco's wand sticking out.
“--Never lose you, I know. I
His mother loved him and Snape to a point, but that was all automatic. They
!” A woman jumped in front of them.
It was the end of the day and Draco hasn't really talked to anyone today because of the massive homework checks he was doing for his housemates. He didn't think he would see the three Gryffindors today.
"Malfoy, Draco." Taking a deep breath, Draco left Potter and Weasley as he went to sit on the stool. The Sorting Hat touched his head and...
“Dobby,” Lucius said and the house-elf appeared with a
“I supposed zat will be best. You are a wonderful dancer. I’ll find you later.”
"No." Snape paused and turned sharply towards Draco. "Why are you asking me that question?"
“Why don’t we move along now?” Hemione piped up and ushered Draco away as Harry grappled Ron into a headlock.
“I’ll see you tomorrow?” Harry said.
“No, we shouldn’t because the complete opposite reaction happened tonight! Draco rejected him.”
“Last year, Moody was being impersonated by a Death Eater right under our noses... And, during the Final Task, I saw Voldemort, I fought him and only barley managed to escape. The Ministry's not going to teach us how to fight these new dark forces. So we have to learn how to fight for ourselves."
“Well, it wasn’t as if Lupin was teaching class covered in fur and had sharp teeth.” Anthony shrugged. “Be glad that it wasn’t some blood-sucking vampire or
Draco smiled when the owl tried to affectionately nip at his finger. “It’s nice of you to want to go with your friends, but you need to have an actual date, Harry.” He turned back to the other boy. “That’s why I’m Fleur’s date.”
Hermione helped Draco prop himself up and fed him a steady stream of water.
"But I'm afraid my memories are failing me right now. How did that conversation end? Please, remind me." Riddle raised his arm up. "
Harry into liking you. He did it because he liked
Yes, he would’ve. He did. “I have to talk to him anyway.” Even after making up with his father, Lucius said that the complaint was already too far in process to void even for him.
This was the best Christmas Day Draco ever had at Hogwarts. That afternoon he even had a surprise run-in with Potter and Weasley on the school grounds and they fought in the snow and it was actually... enjoyable. He later refused profusely about thinking such a thing later that day.
“Mother,” He tried again. “Is this about what happened at the World Cup?”
“Draco Malfoy, are you scared of them?” Terry accused.
“Oh! You speak French?” Fleur blinked.
“Draco, what’s wrong?” Hermione asked.
Draco had enough. He was going to settle this once and for all.
"How can you be so sure?" Sprout asked.
"Seriously? Have you
Draco shook his head, feeling dumb that he thought Potter was someone that would have his back. To talk to when they were going through something…. and all he did was yell and shove him away.
“It’s not stupid if it affects you this much. I’m all ears if you’re willing.”
“I’ll keep him safe, Ron.”
"But I know that neither of us doesn’t have to keep suffering from that.”
Then, they decided to do mock duels on the last D.A. meeting of the term.
Hagrid was covered in snow, his giant moleskin coat giving him a misshapen outline. A dead rooster was in his gloved hands.
“What’s up with you?” Ron asked, noticing the change in Draco's posture.
“Pretty fancy there, Malfoy,” Anthony said, adjusting his tie. “White on white?
“A Malfoy that’s a Ravenclaw…” Lupin hiccuped a laugh. “That must’ve been a story.”
That's when Draco made his move. He slapped Harry's hand away and stood up, making the chair scrape against the floor. "I've had enough of this. Just—completely done." Having Harry's sweaty hand keeping him from speaking was the last thing he wanted to put up with. "I need to go." He pushed past Hagrid to get to the door.
“You’d kill him even after he’s helped you?!” Ron cried in horror.
Gentle fingers cupped Draco’s face and Draco felt the air thin.
“I like you, Draco,” Harry repeated and Draco realised that he said that aloud. “Like, as
"Harry, Harry..." Her eyes widened. “Like in… Potter?” She sat up. “You’re friends with
“Well, I wasn’t scared for you. And I was impressed to a point. You’re a good wizard, Harry. It’s one of the things I admire about you.”
"Relax, you're fine," Draco whispered in his ear, pulling Potter’s arm back down. What possessed him to calm down Potter, he had no idea. Still, it made him stop,
“I am, too. But it’s for him. If something is to come out of this, it'll only to give us enough accountability to save him if no one else."
Draco sat himself in between Terry and Anthony as he settled into for a long train ride.
Draco stumbled as he landed on cracked pavement. He looked up to see himself in a… where was he? They were on a street lined with brown-bricked houses. In the distance, he could see a dense forest.
"It's alright, Mr. Malfoy." McGonagall gently said. "I'm sorry I had to question you, I just feel awful about this." she patted Draco's arms. "I found this with them outside the library," she addressed the last sentence to Harry and Ron and held out a mirror that came out of her robe pocket.
“Draco! Draco Malfoy!” Ron Weasley hollered. The three Gryffindors ran up to them.
"I... I've had my share of rough times, Mister Malfoy." Lupin only answered. "I can sort of understand."
"I didn't know Hogwarts had a gamekeeper!" Draco said in mock-awe, though the two didn’t notice. “That’s amazing!”
Draco looked as his words and frowned at them. Then his brow furrowed. His writing was disappearing and another person's writing was being written.
happen. Like a certain pathway into the nearby future. And, most of the time, I’ve gone off to try to change that and that leaves to the future to be something completely new.”
for me.”
Andromeda explained muggle currency to him. (“Why do I need paper?” Draco asked. “Aren’t coins enough? These coins add up to the paper so what’s the use? Who are these people on the paper anyway?”
“Why?
“His name was Dobby?” Draco asked again.
Draco stared at him.
“Alright...”
Draco buried himself in the sheets. He had settled in and everyone had thought to call it a night and he happily agreed. His eyes studied his blue, four-poster bed, not over the fact that it was not green nor was the patch on his robes.
“We don’t know each other, not really,” Draco said. “I don’t actually know most things about you…”
“You’re amazing, Draco,” Harry said suddenly. Three pairs of eyes turned to him. “For doing this for us!” They all stared at him, Weasley with an unknown expression on his face.
"No,”
He continued muttering as he left the dormitory, none the wiser that Draco was within his four-poster bed.
--that good friends had with one another.
were our
A squawk made Draco whirl around to find Buckbeak settled on the other side of the hut, lying in a nest of straw and blankets. He turned back to Hagrid, disconcerted.
"No, not really him--"
"Thank you." She tightened her arms, not seeming to care that her expensive-looking clothes were touching basilisk blood. Harry could only blink in shock. Her arms left him, and she went over to Ron, who's eyes became wide as she pulled him into a hug. "Both of you, thank you."
“What are you up to, Draco?”
“I know, but it’s like… I already know, if that makes since. Just by looking at you I know… I’m saying the honest truth. You’re… perfect.” Harry seemed to realise what he said and added, “A-As in you have wonderful magic and grades!” Draco couldn’t help his eyebrow raising in confusion.
“I’m not avoiding anyone,” Draco said.
“Pfft, yeah, I know!” Michael grabbed the mirror to set it down and pulled at Draco’s arm again. “Now, come on! Let’s look around the place! I bet we can find all sorts of people here!”
After a few minutes, the Snitch fluttered over a particular tent before going through the open flap. Draco stepped inside, taking in the expanded space. Towards the back of the tent, he saw Michael eyeing himself in a large handheld mirror.
Harry stared hard at the lake. “She called him a drunk. My dad,” Harry confessed, eyes focused on the orange leaf that fell onto the water’s surface. “She called him a drunk that couldn’t support his family.” Harry’s hand curled into a fist. “She said something about my mum, too. She said something was wrong with my mum… because something was wrong with me.” Harry’s fist was shaking with silent anger.
longer than should have, but even when it softened to indifference and Draco just waiting for a girl to catch his eye… there was no one. He never knew what to do with Pansy’s affections. If anything, he took advantage of them. He lightly indulged in them because he really liked it when someone stroked through his hair and gave him a slight taste of his fantasies. Lucius told him during sixth year that his marriage arrangement would be someone from the Greengrass family and Draco can say with complete honesty he didn’t know anyone by that name despite his father saying they were in the same house and not that apart in age.
Tonks thus began an impromptu crash course of “important” muggle specifics. She took him through multiple “discographies” of various Muggle bands and singers (she even roped him into an impromptu dance party one night as they listened to records), flipping through magazines filled with supposed celebrities with coordinated outfits and imperative gossip about their relationship status, and what was “cool fashion” that involved piercings and overtly black clothing that was too much even for him. Tonks was by far the coolest relative he's ever met.
“We didn’t go,” Draco answered truthfully. “We hanged around the Black Lake instead.”
Ron choked on his spit and caused a nearby table of second years by to stare at him strangely. “Are you mad? Ask Hermione-- Why would I ask her?”
Nothing was making sense to Harry. The hidden meaning behind the boy's words was going over Harry's head. Riddle was saying all these things about Draco, but they couldn't be true. Yet, Riddle was standing there a gleaming grin on his face like his words were nothing if not true, but they
"DRACO! It's already over! Gryffindor won!" His shoulders were being thrashed side to side. “That has to be the shortest match in all of history!” It was Michael speaking.
“Lead the way then.” Harry nodded dumbly and took the lead.
"He was going to tell us something about the Chamber of Secrets. He's--He's a pureblood, right? Not muggle-born or half-blood. That has to be the explanation." Harry felt awful that he was just sitting there, doing nothing. If he could do anything, he would do it. Anything.
"Dumbledore and an Auror told me," Harry said.
he stopped. What would Dumbledore do? Would he even do something?
And to all my trans readers:
Sirius nodded. “Ah, yes. My mother’s prized heirloom. What about it?”
“I asked Hermione to take off Michael’s face paint,” Draco grumbled. “She scrubbed too hard. Hey, why are you laughing?!” He gave a forceless punch at a giggling Harry who tipped to the side to hide his smiles. Unconsciously smirking, he grabbed the pillow nestled beside him and whacked Harry. “Prat!”
“Can I speak to her?”
“Really? That’s so weird…” Harry trailed off.
“Hi, Goldstein…” Harry muttered, nodding his head to the two other boys.
"Something told me," Draco answered flatly, crouching down to the last bookshelf, skimmed the spines until he found
Michael frowned and checked over the lettering. “Dammit!”
Draco eyed himself in the mirror, smoothing down his dress robes. He twisted his body to get a side view of his outfit.
, and an
But then Terry noticed the look on Draco’s face change. It wasn't pleased or surprised or happy.
Anthony slumped in his seat, head tipped back, legs stretched out before him. "I'm not worried about it. You have the rest of the years at Hogwarts to make it up to us, but I guess I forgive you." Terry and Michael both agreed.
There was a special sting of guilt when he would look out the window and see Hedwig staring him down. When Draco would go and relieve her letter, she would sit and stare at Draco as if waiting for him to compose a response right there. It left Draco’s own owl taking initiative and ushering the snowy owl away (no doubt the beginnings of bad blood were being created).
Fleur gaped. “You know zis woman, Draco?”
His chest became slack, his throat opened as Draco gasped for air. The heels of his palms pushed against his eyes to stop the vision of those last moments. His heart was still felt like it was being squeezed, but the sense of panic was waning.
Andromeda’s hand went up to cup the back of Narcissa’s head. “Sister, I’ve missed you, too.”
Draco stuck out his arm to hold Scabbers in front of Ron’s nose. “I’m leaving for home. You can have Scabbers back.” After a beat, Draco added, “If you want me to watch him again when I come back, I’ll do it.”
He got the thing he wanted for years.
“What’re you doing here?” Ron asked as he reached Draco and Harry's table.
“Right then,” Uncle Ted said and drove onward.
He took a deep breath, repeating the phrase '
Draco smiled, feeling excited now.
“Oh, sod off. I have a girlfriend.”
Time melted one more as he found himself on the Hogwarts Express without remembering getting on. He spent the entire journey looking at the window once more, turning down Michael's offer of sweets and Terry's offer of using his pillow for a nap until the scenery blurred into King's Cross Station.
"Master Draco? Dobby is here to tell you that you are going to Diagon Alley for school supplies." Draco shot up to see it was indeed Dobby who was holding the breakfast tray up to him.
"How did you manage to do that? I know you’re his godson, but still…”
But as if he would
“Yep! It’s—It’s already passed and gone. Yeah, gone,” Draco tried to hear any trace of lying in Harry's voice, but couldn't hear any.
The crushing thoughts of being unable to change the past and never escape from it wanted to make an appearance once more.
him, to use the Crucio all while keeping her voice frighteningly in check.
"Yeah." They watched the Weasleys try to situate themselves as they gave farewell hugs before boarding the train. "They called you a Malfoy," Potter said after a while.
"Well, I guess that can wait till later. We should be grateful that these two risked their life to save your son."
Harry recounted everything odd and cryptic warning given him by Mr. Weasley, what he overheard the Weasleys talking about at the Leaky Cauldron, and to not doing anything rash regarding Sirius Black.
Michael spluttered. “Whaat?
Running footsteps startled the group further as Lupin crashed through the doorway.
Draco frowned and tried to sift through his memories. “No, professor. Nothing has happened to me.”
Draco followed him up the stairs and down a hallway, glancing at each moving picture display of a family of three.
"And that you wished you had a crack at said monster before Hagrid was arrested?" said Snape, the hand on his chair seemed to get tighter.
Draco waited for Michael to ask him but the boy only groaned, “You all are boring!”
“Mister Malfoy, you’re acting irrational. Have you received some poor news? You should know better than to talk like that to a professor—“
Harry gave Ron a bewildering look. “I didn’t even know about this tournament until
“So will you help us?” Harry asked, his voice hopeful.
“How is everything at school, then?” Narcissa asked as teacup floated into her expectant hands.
Lockhart gave a wide smile, nodding as if to say
One day, someone is going to pull his shoulder out of its socket from all the arm pulling. For the what seems like the millionth time, he was pulled into an empty classroom.
Narcissa didn’t answer. “I’ll talk to you soon, Draco.” She pushed herself up and pressed a kiss into his hair. She went over to the other two adults. “Thank you again, Andromeda. Edward.”
"Thanks, Mum..." Ron grumbled.
“Thank you, Uncle Ted,” Draco said. “And thank you, Aunt Andromeda.”
That's when he
“Hurry up, Potter!” Draco called out playfully, spinning back to watch the other boy climb the stairs. But Harry had stopped mid-step, his eyes soft as if bewitched. He looked up at Draco with a small smile etched on his face.
of all things.
Instead, Lucius sighed, long and exhausted. “I thought I was doing something good when filing that complaint with the Ministry. That it was showing that I have the influence to make things better for you.”
The next day he saw Weasley sitting next to Granger, but still didn't see Harry. Having not seen Quirrell in two days threw him of any confidence that the rumors were rumors which we steadily spreading.
Terry felt guilt grip his stomach. “Harry, I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to push.”
,” she whispered.
“But I have no idea who sent it.”
“I wanted to ask you something.” Harry turned to see Draco staring at him, his grey eyes shining.
His quill hovered for a moment before touching the paper.
It's not the most picture perfect, but it was still his father. His father was trying.
“Yeah?”
“I think should go back to my own tent then,” Michael said, pushing himself off the couch a few hours later. “I’m pretty sure the match’s about to start. I’ll find you all later
"After this, we can get you a present." His eyebrow twitched in confusion.
“Where are you going?” Draco followed after him. "Harry?"
"No, he still
Edward picked up the tension in the room and turned to Draco. “Uh, son, why don’t I take you to the living room? I’ll put on the telly.”
you alright?” Terry asked.
“Bicorn horn and boomslang skin,” Draco said, evening his voice innocently.
“Are you okay?”
“Draco Malfoy, I’ll never doubt you again!” Michael shouted over the roar of congratulations as Draco was lowered from his victory carry as they left the Quidditch field in late November.
“No—I really think I shouldn't come. Go without me. You're wasting time."
“What would I give to have a good professor again,” Anthony said, carefully unpinning his prefect badge to place at his bedside table.
“I can come by later…” Draco said when he noticed he was the only non-Gryffindor in the room.
“These steps... I’ve never seen anything like it... It’ll be difficult.”
Ron’s face twisted in annoyance. “No. Harry’s arsed uncle didn’t sign his permission slip.” he seethed.
Draco fell face-first into his bed, almost wanting to scream into his pillow. A knock on his door made Draco stop before he could.
“Thank you.” Draco nodded before he Ron led him to the castle.
“NO! I don’t want to hear it! Just
“What do we even need to talk about? There’s nothing I need to say to you.”
“I’m heading back,” Draco growled.
Draco thought he was looking into a dead carcass of a horse. The molting black skin was stretched over bones and seemed of nothing more. Wings squeaked when they twitched. It was hooked up to the carriage.
? We don't know a thing about Black, Narcissa. I already know where he'll be heading to. What if Draco gets tangled in such a mess again?"
“You’re too much of a square to attack students, mate,” Terry laughed as he sat next to Draco at breakfast, using the advantage of the free spaces all around Draco to put his school bag there.
“Don’t worry, Draco. Your bestest friend Terry will get you
That didn’t make Draco feel alright. Why did He have Harry Potter’s attention? He shouldn’t be getting attention.
“Definitely but just don’t have the proof of what. I need to start really looking at it. Maybe after the Yule Ball.”
Tonks took a breath through her teeth. “That’s cold, dear cousin.”
“Stupid Harry Potter!”
Disclaimer that this is a projected number of chapters left because I want to include two (maybe three) more side stories and make sure they’re not too oddly spaced out between the main storyline but yes, my realm of thinking that HRI has at least 11 more chapters! Get ready! Thank you for reading!
"Well, I suppose yes. He has... helped with a few things." Draco tried thinking about first year, but sleep was pulling him back in. He yawned. “Can I go back to sleep?”
The boys slowed down when they saw the staircase entrance jammed with students. Penelope Clearwater was trying to keep jumpy first years from going up the stairs.
as Draco said
“I never think I could ever do such a thing."
What was Barty Crouch doing in the Great Hall so late at night? And alone? It seemed natural to investigate. It could lead to more clues, maybe an answer. But it was reckless...
”Hey, doesn’t he look like that Malfoy prick Dad’s always on about?" George asked. Embarrassment flamed Draco's cheeks and he looked down, avoiding their gaze.
Draco breezed through the majority of his exams, much to the annoyance of his friends. The worst one was, as expected, Defense Against the Dark Arts. But it wasn't for what Draco thought it'd be.
Harry glanced down at Draco's hand before looking up and smiling. “Then… I’m not that afraid then.”
“No, thanks. Can I just…” Draco shifted his weight from foot to foot. “I heard there was a Black family tapestry.”
Thank you for the lovely comments in the last chapter!! And to comments from new readers: thank you for reading and coming along for the ride :)
“Then stop asking the same question,” he snapped, getting a shocked look from his three friends as he stood up, gathering the books in his arms. “I’ll talk to you later.” Then he left the Great Hall.
Draco couldn't help but preen at that.
Ron shrugged. “She said she’d meet me here. I think she wanted to fix her hair or something. If I'm being honest, I don’t feel so good.” He curled his arms around his stomach.
“Ah. Yes, she was feeling under the weather.”
“Anything I can help with?”
“But is it not Lucius' fault that you're placed in this predicament? What was he thinking of doing something so dangerous?!”
Draco paid for his books and the two stepped outside. Sunlight peeked through the clouds and it played off Harry's hair. Draco's stomach fluttered.
“I don’t know,” Michael furrowed his brow, then he shrugged. “I asked if it could find you like how we always try to find it.”
“Wow, he
Draco has a feeling that his mother wouldn’t join them but it didn’t stop him from wanting to protest. Before he could open his mouth, his surroundings exploded into a whirlwind of colours.
"Yeah, yeah, I saw. So... How was Harry?"
Draco pushed down the surge of panic, his back straighten as a response. "Just--trying something different. I guess I've been hanging around Micheal's dry humour for too long. Or I'm just changing... as a person."
Lucius was looking up from his papers as Draco opened the door. He set his quill down and stood as Draco eased himself into the room.
"But Draco simply
“What was the whole… Cedric thing?”
“You’ve been in the Muggle world?” Terry asked.
Somehow, this was more disheartening to hear it come from an adult. From his godfather. "I can't believe this. Even
One afternoon, Draco was at Hagrid’s hut, trying not to grimace at Hagrid’s planned trial outfit that had a yellow-and-orange tie when Hermoine rushed in sniffling and her eyes red.
“Yeah, maybe I can.” Harry seemed to want nothing more than that.
“For the better!” Hermione protested. “He doesn’t have to tell us anything.”
She paused before adding, "I love you, nephew. Deeply."
Draco bit his lip. “Our families make us who we are. They show us what we want to be and what we don’t want to be. We can know what it looks like to follow a certain path.”
my wand!” Weasley pulled out his wand from his pocket and Draco saw it was barely hanging together by a few splinters.
“Lucius, are you hearing yourself? He is
“Well, this confession is definitely about him," Anthony explained further, "
Harry had some regret telling Ron and Hermione about his crush on Draco. (Well, not Hermione, but Ron has yet not passed an opportunity to mention it in conversation.) Ron burst out in laughter when he told them on the Hogwarts Express, saying so after they questioned him why he kept looking at the door as if he was waiting for someone. Ron's given reason for laughing was that Harry's pining should've been a giveaway and that this was a goldmine for teasing (Hermione kicked him in the leg). It was nice to share his secret, feeling natural as neither Ron or Hermione batted an eye at the notion that he liked their
“What? What’d he say?” Michael asked. “Is it something that Ginny would also know?”
“Aw, you’d be lost without me?” Anthony placed a hand on his chest as if humbled. “Wow, how…” He threw his arm around Draco and mussed his hair. “
“So what I feel isn’t important?”
Memories that only suffered in Draco’s nightmares pranced around his vision. Dark red eyes, sharpened nails tapping against a table, Draco stepping in pools of blood and feeling like he’ll sink into them. Feeling like prey as the Dark Lord stalked around him as he quietly threatened to kill him.
?” Anthony sang.
? Malfoy? Malfoy, don’t ignore me! Hey. Hey,
"Yeah- yer not still on abou' that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped protect the Stone, he's not about to ter steal it."
Terry rolled his eyes. “This is

Terry shrugged. “I don’t know. My mum's supposed to be picking us up. She’s probably—“
be taught, Weasley. I’m impressed,” he said as they twirled around nearly seamlessly. “By the way, if you ever tell anyone about this, I’ll murder you.”
? They asked for dress robes this year didn’t they?” Andromeda asked, fluttering her hands over Draco.
Draco tried to pay no attention to his father and the shop owner talking about selling Dark Magic objects from the manor so they would seem clean or how the discriminated against Arthur Weasley. He found himself in front of a decaying hand on a cushion. He remembered this... the Hand of Glory... he recalled asking his father if he could get this, only to be reminded that Granger had beat him for top grades  that first year.
Draco jumped up at once, eager to leave the atmosphere of the living room. “Sure, Uncle!”
Draco managed an unsure smile before there was a blood-curdling scream outside. Jumping up from their seats, everyone bolted towards the tent opening.
The door groaned open. Draco jumped and turned around to see Harry peeking in.
"What are you on about now, Terry?"
Cat hair.
Draco clicked his tongue and rested his chin on his knees. “Stupid Harry Potter…. Stupid Fletcher Nil.” Draco cringed at himself. It really was like it was his original timeline: complaining about people who didn’t like him.
Moody hesitated to place his flask on his desk, his glass eye swiveling. “You look awful, Mister Malfoy. Why don’t you go to the Hospital Wing?”
"I'm fine, Minerva. We need to focus on the students." Snape released his grip on the chair and walked out of the room, his black robes fluttering in his wake.
Strange, Draco didn’t remember this…
“Harry, dear, could you tell Ron and the others that dinner’s running late," Mrs Weasley said, taking up a large spoon.
“But… this will bring disorder. Worse than that! It'll bring--I’m scared, Lucius. Terrified.”
“All right, all right. See? Look, I’m doing it,” Draco muttered as he opened the potion bottle and downed it one gulp. The blond suddenly felt a rush of warmth spread throughout his body as the potion settled in his stomach; it felt like he had swallowed fire, though the heat wasn't unpleasant. He uttered a breathless gasp as white smoke began pouring from his ears. He hastily grabbed for his goblet and starting downing his pumpkin juice in an attempt to quell the affects of the potion. He gave a relieved sigh when the smoke finally stopped.
When the dragon recklessly roared out fire, everyone ducked.
Enjoy!
Draco kept silent. Foggy, embarrassing memories of Umbridge patting his head and having tea in her horridly pink classroom.
He froze.
“Will do.” Then they were gone.
"How bad could've it gone?!" Anthony glanced over Terry's shoulder and wavered. "Oh, it was really bad."
“How could he…?”
good-looking! Come on, Draco!" Michael shoved Draco's arm. "Leave something for us!"
"Stop! Say what you’re here to do."
“Not so loud, Narcissa. And it’s not madness. It’s what needs to be done.” His father’s voice sounded strained.
Harry coughed and cleared his throat. “I wrote to you. Over the summer. I didn’t get a reply.”
“You’re... You're not joking, right?”
Buckbeak twitched, a made an inquisitive noise. He cocked his head and squawked again. The creature shuffled forward but still didn’t bow. Draco felt his palms get sweaty and starting having doubts about this actually going well.
“It’s not that strange. I find it…” Draco was careful not to wrinkle the edges as he set it down to organise Harry’s ink-soaked books, “… nice.” He felt himself smile.
Lucius looked out-of-place in his doorway. Draco doesn't remember seeing him in his room. Ever.
Draco stood up from his seat to set down how own teacup. He looked up at the werewolf in gratitude. “Have a good afternoon, Professor.”
“I recognized her,” Harry said when he sat down. “She was at Sirius’ retrial. She was one who tried to oppose the removal of Sirius’ charges.”
Draco’s chest twisted with empathy. “What happened?”
The crowd was keeping itself occupied as they wanted for the appearance of the champions. Dumbledore was waiting beside Minister Fudge and his group of Ministry officials.
"I'm sorry."
“It’s alright everyone. He’s only scared.” Luna said.
“I—I am!” Draco blushed. “Why are you still here? Get out!”
"Is Harry not going?” Draco asked suddenly.
Draco was running. Passed the shocked students leaving the dance, up the moving staircases, surprising the portraits on the walls, getting the bronze eagle’s riddle wrong twice before opening the dormitory’s door, and slamming it close.
“Where’s Hermione?” Draco looked over at Ron's other side.
Harry smiled and leaned forward, their lips moments from coming together.
“What?”
“Leave him alone,” Harry said forcefully and Flint chuckled.
best friend. Hermione thought of it as romantic and made Harry swear that he'd go and talk to her if he 'needed advice'. Ron pledged to "help in any way he can". Both ideas sounded terrible to him.
“Ted, what on earth are you saying?” Aunt Andromeda said as Draco turned away. “He needs to focus on O.W.L.s this year!”
“But what about--” Anthony placed a hand on Terry’s shoulder.
"What are the Beaters doing?" Michael shrieked beside him, violently pulling himself out of his wallowing. “They’re only paying attention to Potter! Play the game!“ He shouted at them.
“I don’t know. With the amount of books we got for him, I expect him to have some skill. I want to
Months fluttered passed with each day of cramming and practically relearning everything within a night until exam week arrived in the second week of June.
Draco willed the phrase to push out of his head.
“I’m a Malfoy. Family image is everything. As long as it’s salvageable then I can probably fix it up.”
"Oh, yeah. I’ll have to fix them."
“Moving on,” Hermione pressed, ignoring Ron. “What is it you needed to tell us, Harry?” she tucked Crookshanks’ basket securely beside her leg.
"Wisdom comes from experiences. You should know this, Mr. Malfoy."
But Draco didn’t know what to
didn’t help with a special edition that took notice of Harry’s worsened mood. Skeeter justified the turn of events that Harry’s ‘beloved’ wasn't impressed with him saving two people from the lake. Now, there was a hate club in the works for Harry’s heartless ‘witch.’)
"Potter." Draco, who's back was facing the Gryffindor table, turned around to see Harry hurriedly duck down, stabbing his food, his face a bright red.
“No, I just…” Draco distractedly pushed his hair back. “Greatly respect them.”
“You didn’t.”
“They what?” Draco didn’t really have an actual thought about Harry’s relatives but he never thought they were like that. “That’s--”
“Draco, wait. Do you--“ Harry began to say, making Draco turn back around. “I mean, would you—would you ever—want to--” Harry paused.
“No, no. I feel like I need to hear this.”
“Draco, wait.” Harry sighed, but the blond still walked away. “Draco!” A scrambling sound of shifting snow followed the blond.
Potter smiled miserably. “I… I... just ruined everything.”
"They call your name and you go sit on a stool, then they put a talking hat on you and it will tell you what house you belong to." Crazed looks were given his way, but he ignored them. "It sounds weird, but I'm telling the truth." Yet he could still hear Granger talk to Longbottom about the spells she knew to use for the 'real' test.
“Harry?” He called out when he was close enough.
"I say, what are you all doing here?"
” He warned, fixing Ron with a telltale look before leaving.
“Be careful, Sister,” Andromeda whispered.
As a reaction to his horrible performance during the Quidditch game, Draco was slowly filled with dread as February neared, bringing the match between Gryffindor and Ravenclaw with it. To distract himself, Draco worked on Buckbeak’s case with Hagrid and Hermione.
Draco blew his bangs out of his eyes and hoped that sleeping would help before pulling his blue sheets to his chin and closing his eyes.
After the announcement, there was a similar bias for Cedric than Harry. Fletcher Nil didn't seem to have the creativity of making 'POTTER STINKS' badges, but the presence of Rita Skeeter and her satirical publishings in the
“God!” Nil gave a frustrated shout, balling his hands in his hair. The Slytherin boy bowed his head to the ground as he yelled at the ground. “Every time you’re mentioned I suddenly feel like I’m vapour! You're now the rival Harry Potter has to worry about, you’re the one talked about along with Potter and his band of idiots, you’re the crush of the girl
"No..." Draco groaned. He couldn't really do that while being in Slytherin. Maybe if he—
“It’s fine. It was nothing.” He stood up. “Thank you for the tea.”
"I would wonder what's with the attitude, but I can't right now. Gryffindor won!" Weasley jumped up and down around them.
Draco drew out a tired breath. He made a mistake. “And what if I did, Hermione?”
“No, it’s because IT’S NOT REAL!” Draco erupted.
Viktor Krum.”
"Harry, slow down." Draco held up his hands.
“Book girl?”
Draco squinted at the figure above him. “Anthony?” he whispered.
"Of course," Harry said and looked over at Draco. "Would you write back?"
I’m fine, Uncle Ted.” He reassured, sitting at the table where his breakfast was waiting.
“Yes, sir,” Tonks nodded. “Draco, with me."
The boy went quiet.
“Draco, I feel like you’re hiding something.” His head shot up to the Headmaster. Instead of finding an angry face, he saw an understanding one. “Tell me, my boy. What’s troubling you?”
Draco got off of the train with Potter sticking to him as if they were attached at the hip.
“Oh, that. It wasn’t a big deal.” Draco shrugged, scooping more egg into his mouth.
Mrs Weasley stopped stirring. “I’m afraid I haven’t. She stopped showing up for tea time for quite a while now… Oh, I’m sorry.”
Before reading ahead, I’d highly recommend reading the side story I promised
“Dear Merlin! How rude of us! They talked about him as well, Hagrid,” Granger said. “About being a Slytherin traitor, gosh, Draco, I’m sorry.”
"Well, are you going to still let me copy?"
The outside world is a dark place, trust me on that. You're not always going to have the protection of the classroom. Dumbledore asked me to take this position to prepare for what's out there. Now, let's begin!"
“Oh, it always does long riddles on the first days,” Penelope muttered, pushing her blonde hair behind her ear. "All right, what did he say?" She asked herself quietly, trying to solve it. Draco didn’t know what to think.
Harry! I knew that something was wrong with Moody but I couldn’t see. And my father helped him return! On my behalf—“
"Why have you been avoiding us?" Harry asked again.
Yet, Potter didn’t say anything after that.
“Is she here?”
"Crazy, isn't it?"
“Do you want... comfort?” Anthony asked, his arms open in question.
"Good morning to you too, Terry."
,” he called out.
“Merlin, look at the size of that woman, Draco--Whoa!” Terry swore, seeing the blond's face. “What happened to you?”
“Yes?”
"Please, make yourselves at home," Dumbledore told the Durmstrang students. They nodded and migrated to the far left of the Great Hall.
“You got me there,” Michael admitted. “I'd wished he'd stay though."
" his eyes started to burn.
“It’s not funny, Terry!” Draco cried pungently.
Narcissa gave one last look to Mrs. Weasely. “I’ll see you for Thursday’s tea time, Molly.”
"My what?" Lockhart's smile waned a bit.
Barty Crouch Jr. said. He just made everything worse. How did this happen?
”No,” Harry replied too enthusiastically, but he cleared his throat and when he spoke again it was gone. “I… just need to get those back to the common room. I need to see if I can find a spell that’ll clean up this mess.”
"I think we would all like to know," McGonagall said, who was standing silently by the fireplace mantle with an equally quite Dumbledore.
“Who’d you have in mind if you did?”
Fletcher threw himself forward and fell off his broom.
Draco’s eyes seemed to dry up fast.
Ron frowned. "Why?"
Draco jumped. “What?”
“I did,” Aunt Andromeda said. “I mean, I was meant to marry a pureblood. Perhaps I was meant to become a Death Eater myself. But I chose not to do that. Trust me when I say that I know what atrocities our family carries, Draco. You and I have both benefited from them. That is why it's up to us to attempt to make progress."
“Can you help me?”
“Just be ready. Goodnight, get some rest, but remember to pack.”
“This is probably the best day of my life.” Michael cried, spinning around with his arms spread.
If you haven't already, feel free to check out the side story,
“I don’t see anything, Professor.” Draco raised his head far enough to rub tiredness out of his eyes. (He didn’t have a good sleep last night.)
“It looks like he doesn’t want it either way. Forget about him.” Harry said easily.
stood and went towards Rowena's pedestal and stuck her arm behind it. She pulled out a squirming rat.
"Professor." the blonde greeted as the man got closer and they began walking together.
Scabbers misjudged the depth of a crevice of earth and fell in. While he was squirming get back right up, Draco snatched him up.
“Someone grab him!” Draco shouted but only encouraged everyone to do the opposite.
“Maybe I am, Weasley.”
Sirius deliberated before replying, "Alright, just be sure that you don’t wake up the old bat.”
"I do. Of course, I do."
Terry turned and saw Potter coming in from outside, moving ghost-like as he slumped down onto the staircase, burying his face into his hands.
“It’s nothing.”
Draco beamed. "I do feel better."
“You ready for your fourth year?” Tonks asked.
"He has?"
Hiding in shadows, he positioned himself behind a moss-covered pillar. He watched Potter place Draco and him under an archway. Moonlight dazzled the snow, the intimacy of the secluded archway made Terry perk up in bated breath.
As she was looping her name, Narcissa asked, "Will you be careful when you go? Just, stay out of trouble will you?"
Tonks laughed. “Couldn't say it better myself. Oh, dear cousin, I think we’re going to get along great.” Settling beside Draco on the couch, she grabbed the remote. “Come on, I’ve just come back from my assignment and I’m beat. Let’s watch some telly.”
"Thank you," Lucius' tone was formal, his gaze went to Ron who visibly tried to shrink himself. "Thank you, to you both." Lucius held out a hand towards Harry. He tried not to flinch as his hand touched a cold ring on the blond man's finger. No sooner had he dropped the hand before it was pointed at Ron, who's eyes widened like they did when he saw the trail of spiders. Ron grabbed the hand and kept it there, not moving it. Lucius took it upon himself to shake Ron's hand. "I suppose... I was wrong about you Weasleys." The awkwardly long handshake was over and Lucius turned back to Dumbledore.
Arithmancy didn't raise his spirits.
"Help?” He asked Granger, looking up from his book to see Weasley and Harry behind her.
with updates and clues of the supposed girl that rejected Harry.
Draco’s heart left his body and came crashing back and pounded wildly. Harry’s fingers were cool against Draco’s face. Harry’s lips were a slow touch, warm, delicate, and new.
When he was certain that they couldn't see him, he ran the whole way to Ollivander's.
and everything went black.” he said, rubbing the back of his head. “Is it strange that I think it was Harry?”
Yet, I hope that doesn’t discourage you and that you enjoy the rest of these chapters. But you’re all lovely readers anyway.
“Oh, look how much you’ve improved!” Andromeda gushed. She patted his cheek. “Your mother will be so proud.”
“Like what?”
Michael, Terry, and Anthony (who heard the news later) were sitting at a table, homework spread before them.
"Come on, it suits you!" Michael said, wiping off his finger. "Just give it a try!"
“Terrible?"
In celebration, here are all the amazing works that have come out of those years!
of his participation. But it was also that same participation—seeing Harry’s unreadable face—that caused him to run.
“She’s wrong, you know.” Draco noticed that Harry didn’t relax. “She doesn’t know anything about this world, about our world. She can never understand. She’s only a muggle.” Draco wanted to say something dumb, like how he thought Harry was extraordinary and had the memories to back it up. But that sounded too weird from the mouth of a friend.
?" Harry nodded and Draco's face went slack.
“Which is a good thing to hear!” Lupin nodded. “Very good thing to hear, but I know how experiences like those can be… unpleasant. I wanted to give an invitation for a lesson to learn a spell that’ll help you counteract them. The Patronus charm.”
need his brow wiped when there was a loud
"Only that it dealt with Umbridge and her terrible class."
Draco promptly replied that there wasn’t a problem in the first place and sent Tonks’ owl on its merry way.
It was finally fourth year.
“Uh oh.”
"I want to get a drink," Harry said simply.
“Harry?” Draco called out again.
As if summoned, Michael crashed open the door. “Sorry, sorry! Lost track of you guys.”
Draco thought on what an owl that was owned by the Weasleys must’ve seen. What did clean and young eyes saw in its lifetime? Maybe saw messy breakfasts, carrying more and more letters as new red-haired children appeared in the house. Carrying care packages of food over long distances to be delivered.
"Walk to me to the Hospital Wing? I think Harry's going to wake today."
“Hello, love,” Narcissa said sweetly, petting his hair. “How are you?”
Draco.
Draco groaned and let himself slump against the couch as he glared at the bright coloured telly advert.
“Oh!” Diggory's shoulders jumped and lowered his parchment down. “Hi. Malfoy, right?”
“New students? Oh, joy! Hope to see you in Hufflepuff! My old house you know?" Said Fat Friar.
Draco let out a long breath.
In a dim, unused corridor, he let himself slid down the wall and tuck his legs to his chest to hide his face. He took deep breaths to try to stop his chest from bursting from the inside, his throat felt tight, and he could feel himself shuddering under the tight grip of his hands.
“Still I wasn’t always like this. I was actually an awful person too until… I realized how pointless it was to be so vain. It really doesn’t get you anything in the end.” Harry looked dubious at Draco as if he didn’t believe it so and Draco ducked his head down and cleared his throat. “But understand what you went through. Being isolated. Separated. I know what that feels like."
"Are you okay?"
She didn’t notice the door push open but no one being there.
“Yeah, an idiot,” Anthony echoed.
The blond hesitated. “Harry, you know that you’re so strong, and brave, and funny, and charming, and
The Gryffindor lot had an unsurprising victory against Slytherin for the Quidditch Cup. Draco has never seen Michael so enraged over a game, then be so ecstatic about the outcome of one. (He actually dyed his hair red for a week). Draco even managed to say a polite congratulations to Harry and left it at that.
“I can’t promise that I will. Between the Minister and the
“We… he… Why must I tell you this?!”
Creevey started telling Harry’s entire life story and Draco felt like the Weasley girl was going to have competition in the “Who’s More Obsessed With Harry Potter.”
“But he’s admitted to changing it around!” Ron argued.
“Sirius’ mother. Don’t worry about her. She’s one of those crazy purebloods.”
“Learning from Lockhart? Ha, good luck,” Draco muttered into his goblet.
The Second Task was a bore, and the entire competition was entirely unexciting since public opinion on Harry Potter switched when everyone took pity on Potter’s heartbreak and his so-called bravery in rescuing two people from the lake. Of course when he was thriving that Potter's love life was in a worse state than his that Potter must cover it up with his positive news to maintain his overinflated ego.
Potter bumped into Draco multiple times as they went into the Great Hall. They entered from the oak doors to the bright Great Hall, loud with students' conversations and lit by hundreds and hundreds of candles floating above their heads.
Writing back a goodbye, he shut the diary (now calling it that because Tom said to) and stretched in his seat.
“Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t know that you were here.” She swiped under her eyes.
"Don't touch me!" Ron shoved him off.
Harry. I just thought I finally understood how Harry and I worked. I thought I’d finally understood my place in Harry’s life—and him in mine. His feelings don’t affect that but after what my father has done I can’t even think of letting myself stand beside him least of all having feelings for me still.”
, you know.” He stirred the paint with a paintbrush. “Because that’s what a
"Had no idea." Micheal deadpanned. "Micheal Corner. This is Terry Boot." He laid a hand said boy's shoulder who jolted up at the touch. "And the loud one is Anthony Goldstein."
A rush of confused annoyance boiled within Fletcher and he hurried up to trail after the blond. “Er, hello?
“Can I sit here?” Draco looked up to see Harry standing above him. Ron was pulling Hermione quickly pass them to sit at another empty roundtable of their own.
--why didn't I see it before--I can't believe that I was so
“Dobby?” Draco asked.
walking down the hallway. And, And I can tell that he's looking for something. Sirius has told me as much. There’s something at the Ministry that the Order is trying to protect. And they don't think the Ministry is going to be safe anymore. Well, we already know that the Ministry's a broken system."
The Slytherins and Ravenclaws jumped away from one another as soon as the final note droned to a close.
Professor Moody flinched as he turned around. There was a flask in his hand. "Ah, Mister Malfoy. What brings you here?"
He was set up in a vaguely remembered obstacle course. He got through most it without trouble.
"I think--I think I'm--"
"Uh, I—I guess not...” Creevey’s ears turned pink. “But what about you? Why are you up?”
I've seen you be a whole different person, but maybe
he was reacting like this even after he had his revelation. He needed to say that he didn’t feel the same. Even though Cho and Ginny were now in committed relationships, that shouldn't stop Harry from realizing that his feelings for him were... mislaid.
“Says… everything! Especially when I know you can’t be telling me the whole truth."
Alright y’all, next chapter is going to be the yule ball chapter… and it’s called ‘Harry’s Confession’
“Can we go somewhere else? Maybe the tree trunk by the Black Lake?”
“No. Of course, you can.” Lucius glanced over the grounds. “Just--Be careful. But be sure to be back at the Minister's Top Box before the match starts."
"Now then," Dumbledore shifted his weight from one foot to the other. "Harry, could you tell us what happened? Preferably from the beginning."
“It’s better than doing that essay for Lupin,” Draco said.
“I know it is. Now,
“Harry Potter better hurry,” Kreacher said before jumping off of Harry’s bed and shuffling out of the room.
“No.”
"Ah..." Draco said, unable to think of anything else.
“Dobby doesn’t want to trouble Master Draco.”
"I'll see you on the Hogwarts Express," Draco told Ron and Hermione who were standing off to the side. They both nodded silently.
"Talk some sense into him! Show him that he could do this."
“Keep walking.” Draco jostled Harry as he moved past him. He didn’t break his quickened stride until busy hair and bright red head through a far off window.
“There is no shame in putting faith in friendship, Mister Malfoy. Sometimes it’s all we have left." Lupin set his teacup down. "Well, that’s enough prodding from me. Why don’t you head back to your dormitory and rest up? Your body must feel exhausted.” It did. “I’m sure your teachers would understand.”
“I thought you were going to go to sleep!”
“Trust me on this, Narcissa, I need to prove my loyalty. This will please him. I'll please him and reconfirm our allegiance so he'll leave us unpunished."
“Do you wish to talk?” Aunt Andromeda asked as she set a teacup in front of him.
“Y-yes.”
He tried not to feel vulnerable without his Ravenclaw friends when they left for home. Everyone else seem to leave and it was only some Slytherins and Harry and his group of friends.
“Want what, Draco?”
“Hermione, the potions should've worn off already. Are you still Millicent?” Draco picked himself off the floor and crowded around Hermione’s bathroom stall. The lock clicked loudly.
Draco flew dangerously close to Harry who had to move back to avoid him.
“It wasn’t his fault! I didn’t listen! Besides, Madam Pomfrey had me fixed before I could even lay down on a bed.” Draco defended Hagrid. He might not be exceedingly close with him but he still didn't deserve the slander.
Aunt Andromeda held out her arms and folded Draco into her embrace. “Oh, my dear nephew.”
He opened the book with more force than needed. The spine creaked with disuse, the smell of aged parchment reaching his nose. Draco thumbed the yellowed pages, seeing fragile photos stuck inside to show families stiffly standing close to fit in the frame, their movements to only smooth out a wrinkle on their dress or reposition their feet.
Grumbling, Harry pushed himself off the floor, wishing that his dream lasted a few moments longer.
A smirk curled on his face.
So very sorry about the long break, school has been very demanding and it’s very tedious to keep up grades. (especially for a student like me haaa)
Dumbledore held up a hand and Fudge closed his mouth. “Where is he?”
Harry erupted out of the water, collapsing onto the deck, people swarming around him with warm blankets and towels. Between fluttering bodies and arms, Harry’s eyes gravitated to Draco’s.
"What? Why would Sirius Black be after you? And why would you seek out a known murderer?"
No matter how much Draco has changed, there’s always going to be a part of him that remembers Malfoy. And if nothing is going to work out for him, if
“Nothing, nothing. Just… I never thought I'd be in this type of situation. Merlin, help us all.” He laughed then so Hermione joined in as well.
"It won't come unless it's called." Tom calmly said.
“Professor,” Draco greeted.
Once it was Harry's turn, Draco had run out of nerves and watched almost passively as Harry's hesitantly walked out into the arena.
"Huh?"
Harry said he was going to get over him. He wouldn't have feelings for Draco anymore.
, mate.” Michael knocked Terry’s arm off of him.
“Alright,” Draco answered as he watched the Snitch floated into Michael’s open palm and went dormant. “How did you make it do that?”
Harry eyed Draco’s cup. “Uhm, so this… looks like… some sort of a flying angel which means…” Harry flipped a few textbooks pages before his eyes widened. “Oh.” He looked up briefly to Draco but tore his gaze back down to the page.
“Good man, Anthony. Cheers,” Terry held up a fist that Anthony bumped.
“It is obvious?” Krum asked.
Draco left the compartment as quickly as he could without actually running. Lovegood had managed to make him uncomfortable the whole ride that he was afraid to even cough if that meant her eyes would go to him. Not even Granger appeared once which he hoped would keep Lovegood occupied. This was more uncomfortable than meeting the Weasleys that day in Diagon Alley.
“So?” Draco snapped. “It happened at the beginning of the semester. What good is it when it doesn’t even matter anymore? Why is he now so interested in what's happening to me now?”
Paranoid? Draco wouldn't describe his father as paranoid.
"We know Bulstrode’s ugly, but come on—“
OUCH!” Ron bumped his knee against the table as he brought his leg up to rub at his shin.
“It never happened to me before either.” Draco smiled again, brightly and carefully.
"Hey, what were you talking about?” Draco said as he slumped into the seat.
He needed to tell Draco how he felt.
"Now, for your punishment, I think I should—"
"I got my supply list today and a permission slip for you to sign," Draco said innocently, pretending not to see the newspaper in Lucius' hand.
"Who is Tonks to you? Because I’ve been writing to her describing you. She says she doesn’t think you’re acting like yourself. And Tonks respects you too much to not say those things lightly. And I know something’s up with you so… So who are you, professor? I know you’re not right. I’m certain, I’m not going to let you get away.”
Draco’s eyes went to the floor. It’s really not a shock that he would be confronted by Crabbe and Goyle. He was actually surprised that they didn’t catch him sooner. But he was a Ravenclaw now. And
“Potter must’ve screwed up
Mrs. Weasley brought he promised tea and let Ron and Hermione look over him as she tended to the other Weasleys up in their rooms. Draco was trying to tell Ron that he didn’t have a fever and so he

“Really?”
"Of course, Mrs Weasley," Harry nodded. "Draco? Do you want to come with me?"
…and started to violently shake them.
"Ron," Harry cut in. "Let me just..." Harry took Hermione’s spot and looked out into the crowd.
“I do, but nothing too bad. I’m serious.”
"Yeah, you should do that," Michael agreed.
“Everything
“I’ll be fine, Professor.” Draco strained a smile. “Thank you for the offer.” He gave an awkward nod and turned to leave the classroom.
“Admit what?”
laughter in the otherwise quiet bookstore. As if a moment of clarity struck him, he looked at the other boy next to him. Harry's messy dark hair, round glasses, loose muggle clothes, his infectious grin, books stacked in his arms. Draco's heart thumped off-beat. He looked... he looked....
The blond took his hand away and flew down to the ground where the Ravenclaw captain was dismounting. He ran a frustrated hand through his sweat-dampened hair.
“No.” the blond sighed.
really bright
"Mister Malfoy--"
What was he thinking? The universe liked to be funny with him, it never wanted to do what he wanted. Harry said that he still liked him but how could he think that Harry would—
As he followed Michael downstairs, he was mentally slapping himself. Was he already dreaming about it? Why couldn’t that dream be real then so that he could get it out of the way? Draco didn’t know what it meant to confess. Even within his head, he was a giant pile of nerves. How did Harry manage to do this?
"Are you excited for the end of the term?" Snape asked, his usual bland tone revealing nothing about actual interest in the topic.
Professor Trelawney was someone that Draco rarely saw. She was seen either at the head table in the Great Hall during meals or shuffling around the corridors to return back to the North Tower. Draco was surprised to see how she looked. Bangles clicking around her wrists, wrapped in so many shawls she could’ve rivalled with Luna Lovegood, her hair a wild mess but keeping out if the way of her overlarge glasses. She looked like one of those fake muggle psychics that Draco has seen in his briefs travels in non-magical London. The similarity didn't sit well with the blond. Her buggy eyes swept the room, making the students squirm in their seats.
Three set of steps that belonged to Harry, Granger, and Longbottom echoed as they appeared. "Follow me." Draco fell into step with the others as they marched outside to Hagrid’s hut. Harry's expression brightened when he saw it was Hagrid who they will spend their detention with, but Filch put an end to that very quickly. "I suppose you think you'll be enjoying yourself with that oaf? Well, think again, boy- it's into the forest you're going and I'm much mistaken if you'll come out alive."
“Study.”
"I wanted to! Very much so, but Madam Pomfrey said there were too many visitors..."
Well, that was true. Hermione, frazzled at the crowdedness, helped Draco decide on what sweets to get.
"I don't remember saying those
He really needed to get his head out of his own thoughts.
. You're always on his mind, you know?" Riddle's eyes glittered and Harry hated that he blushed at his words. "Tell me, how did you defeat the greatest wizard of all time as an infant. Tell me how you defeated Lord Voldemort."
"I'm Draco."
“So, Draco, do you like Harry Potter?”
"Draco?" A hand was on his shoulder, pulling him back into the present (because it wasn't the past, not anymore). "Are you all right?" Concern was in his mother's eyes, but one look at his father and he knew he had to meet the expectations, even if it was all for nothing in the end.
Draco told himself. Weasley sat down and heavy silence filled the compartment, Weasely's fingers getting tangled in his lap. He looked up to Potter. "Are you really Harry Potter?" He blurted out.
"Potter confessed."
"Who?"
Dobby was oddly missing from the manor. Usually, it was him that woke up Draco, but after that odd night, it was another house-elf that woke him most of the time. He would see him down the hallways after he came back from the manor library late at night, but when he tried approaching he got a shriek and a disappearing crack.
"Hey," Potter said, smiling at him. Draco felt caught.
“I don’t think I’m capable of that,” Draco said with a surprising amount of bitterness.
“How’d you make it do that?” Fred said, his aged bearded face in Draco’s face.
"With you looking lonely and all. I'm Luna."
They walked down the corridor in silence. Draco snuck a glance to see Harry’s shoulders were now lax with ease. Draco felt a smile grow on his face. Never has he fully talked his feelings out with a tangible person... (And to have it be
“What?”
“Do you?”
The Weasley twins were hovering all over Harry. One swung at the Bludger that was aiming for Harry’s head and threw it off its course. It looked fine to Draco until the Bludger turned right back around and tried to aim at Harry once more.
The thought made Draco’s heart stutter its beating.
"Thanks Mum and Dad," Terry said dully.
"Yes, Harry?" He hoped that it wasn’t anything important, breakfast smelled wonderful this morning.
“Make sure you beat Slytherin on Saturday.”
“Trust me, Narcissa. This is all happening in the name of my solemn oath to protect our son. Please, trust me.”
“Draco,” Harry gently interrupted. “Look at me.”
“Here you are, Draco.” Terry placed something by Draco’s goblet on a damp morning in the first days of October. Draco looked up from the book he was reading and reached up to grab the bottle and see what it was.
her, right?”
"I'm not the right person to be pleading to. This is out of my hands. I'll take you to Dumbledore."
“Of course I am,” Draco replied, feeling like he was only partially lying.
“Of course! Anything.”
The knot in Draco's chest twitched. "We'll see," he repeated, giving another tight-lipped smile.
Draco looked around the kitchen filled with unfamiliar faces, except one.
Harry was in danger so Draco can't--won't think everything is fine.
“Apologizing never fixes the problem. What would apologizing do?“ Draco's lips curled into his mouth. “Answer me.” Lucius snapped.
“What was it? What did you see? Was it something important?” Trelawney asked, her bug-like eyes freighting Draco more.
. Potter was tip-toeing to look at Draco. Instead of feeling annoyance as he thought he would, Draco instead felt sort of touched that Potter was checking to see if he was okay.
A bell jingled followed by a commotion happening in the doorway. "Ron--
“Yeah, I guess I do.”
It made it sound like Draco would be here for a long time.
Fletcher?!" he shouted, cheeks flushed. "You could've plummeted to your death!"
. Please. Don’t play dumb.”
“It’s not that big of a deal! Wait, how would you know it’d be Harry Potter?”
“Look, I want to make sure Draco's okay too. We all do. I wish we can help but…” Michael began.
“What? I’ve always been here.” Hermione breezed, smoothing down her hair that was more frazzled than usual. She glanced down at Draco’s calculations. “Maybe you should try the other way for Harry’s name. Just to see the comparison,” she added when she got a suspicious stare.
Andromeda and Narcissa were standing at opposite ends of the kitchen island. Edward was sitting in a breakfast nook, a half-assembled tea tray in front of him.
"It's blank." He closed it back to the cover. "Who's... Riddle?"
“Sometimes… there doesn’t need to be a whole…” Uncle Ted waved a hand. “Debating, rationalizing, second-guessing, or something of the like. Things can be simple. Like they’ve been there all along. Just think about what's in front of you and work from there."
"Yes, hello. Son, it's time to go."
Before they left class for the day, he caught Colin in the corridor, trying to see if he could say what Draco told him.
Draco was walking back to Ravenclaw Tower when he heard his name called. He turned around to Michael hurrying beside him, blushing brightly with a large smile on his face.
Still, he craved… affection.
“What is it, dear?”
Draco could no longer expect to stay at Harry’s side.
Draco’s hand was snagged by Harry and brought him back to himself.
“Yes?” Draco asked, tapering down his giddiness.
"Better."
“Come on, mate,” Michael said kindly and Draco wanted to get angrier because of it. “It’s not like you to be
He waited until Potter's name called out. As he remembered, he took the longest before the hat yelled out, "GRYFFINDOR!" The only thing that changed was that Potter looked back and their eyes met. Draco shrugged, thinking of nothing else to do as he clapped.
urge.”
“No idea. It was weird. By the way, you need to add another four inches to your essay.”
--glances of Ron and Hermione, and the longing of wanting to see Harry.
“Right.” Ron nodded. “Oh, uh,” he held out his arm and Hermione took it.
"Harry."
"At least a person hasn’t been attacked yet, but we need to hurry with this potion,” Granger said, dumping in fluxweed.
"I'm going to see Draco," Narcissa said and Lucius followed his wife.
Yet where did that leave Harry Potter?
Both he and Hermione turned a dark red. Hermione cleared her throat. “Shall we go in?”
"Harry, you need something?" Tonks asked.
Terry made a face. “Me? No way. Balls and dates aren’t really my type of thing in the first place. I usually like to take a step back and simply watch. I’m really just going for the Weird Sisters that are said to perform.”
get any better?” Draco tried to keep the desperation out of his voice.
It took a lot of convincing for Draco to go to Moody’s classes. Ever since his family’s history was publicized to the entire class, Draco had very little incentive to continue going but it felt pointless to be holed up in his dormitory for an hour. Moody just finished a caution story about ghouls when class was deemed over. As the students filed out, Draco steeled himself and walked up to the front of the classroom.
“You’re right…”
Harry seemed to preen. “Yeah, I know. It's quite impressive.”
"Stupid," Draco muttered.
Draco rubbed his eyes and woke up at the touch of something cold and wet on his fingers. He pulled his hand back to see it covered with red.
“Will…” Ron gulped as if he had slugs stuck in his throat. “Will you go to the dance with me?”
“You’ve--” Another horrifying moment of clarity struck him. “You’ve all been whispering amongst each other for as long as I can remember! You all knew from the start! For, For years! You were so obvious! You asked those questions. Those pushing, annoying hints. How is that not trying to meddle?!”
Michael, Terry, and Draco made to leave but Anthony said, "Can one of you wait for me? Couple nights ago, I lost something in here and I want to look for it."
Draco knew that it would be helpful for him to learn the spell, but he rather not deal with Harry’s cold shoulder while trying to conjure a nonexistent joyful memory.
Shaking his head, Draco took his hand away from the shelves and continued further into the library. In a forgotten corner, Draco knelt down to pull out an ancient book. Its leather cover was frayed and the Black family crest was peeling off from the centre. His mother’s family history book.
"Yes! Dobby interrupted Master Draco's sleep far too long! What a terrible house-elf Dobby is!" the house-elf grabbed the edges of his nightstand and prepared to smash his head in it. "Bad Dobb—"
Harry tensed. “It was dark. I didn’t—“
, and
“What did they do, darling?”
“Yes, he’s a close friend, but Draco, you're the first friend I ever made.“ Draco felt his cheeks go to a light pink.
Draco stuttered in his steps, faltering at the base of Ravenclaw Tower. The weight that settled on Draco’s shoulders was surprising.
He checked his other hand and saw it was free of any kind of red, but he saw something on his cuff that made his breath get caught in his throat.
After Divination, Draco had Arithmancy. There was frayed hope that this class could give him an understanding on what happened to him. (Draco was also rattled trying to ignore the fortune and to qualm his fluttering heart.)
secrets into Draco,
And losing! Badly!” Another powerful roar shook the stands and Terry ducked back down. “Just--When did you get
The next day, Draco was waving his wand in an abandoned classroom for the phonograph to start playing waltz music. He turned around and stood in front of a frowning Ron.
She grinned. “So do you.”
Keeping steady on Scabbers, he followed him as he scampered over the flagstones. Draco felt winded as they found themselves out in the school grounds.
Giving them a silent treatment, Draco got dressed and headed down to the Great Hall for breakfast, all while shoving down complicated feelings deep inside himself to not feel their presence. As the four Ravenclaws sat themselves down. He risked a glance at the Gryffindor table.
"Be careful, Scabbers is in here. We just left to get him rat tonic. That rat tonic was expensive." A witch and a little girl walked passed them.
“He insisted that he wanted to know any time you were placed in the Hospital Wing. I’m sorry, but I can’t go against a parent’s wish.”
"Draco," He wanted to duck down, but that wouldn't help him at all. "I gave you expectations. Did I not?" They were sitting in his father's office. The office he used for his work at the Ministry of Magic which was all for business and the place Draco would go for his lectures and punishments.
"We're fine, Hermione," Harry spoke for the both of them.
"Ready," The other two answered.
"What? Why-"
A young woman with spiky, bubblegum pink hair stepped into the living room, wiping down long Auror robes. She looked up and blinked at the stunned Draco sitting on the couch.
“Oi, Draco, go see if Potter’s still kicking.” Michael pushed Draco down the row, almost crashing into Luna Lovegood.
Crabbe and Goyle appeared on random, asking why hasn’t he asked for them or how come he wasn’t in Slytherin. Draco shoved them away and told them to stop bothering him. They haven’t been back since.
"Oh?" Michael said in an odd tone. "How so?"
“Yeah, hi. Are you busy?”
"He's... charming."
"Yes, of course, Draco. Let me get them for you.”
There was a sense of peace on top of that hill.
“Nil has gotten the Snitch! Slytherin wins!” Dean Thomas said with the little enthusiasm he could muster.
“Did he kiss you?”
to think about how much Draco’s eyes made him go weak-kneed and emptied his head of all thoughts. It was a problem for Harry ever since their meeting in Madam Malkin’s. Sometimes it still feels like he imagined it... Being in a magical robe shop, catching an interesting boy in his arms, his blond hair falling over his face but Harry still noticed that the boy had
Draco felt himself shake, frustrated tears burning behind his eyes as he glared at the ground. “I thought you said you’d trust me.”
"Nothing you probably haven't heard already. Mass murderer, a supporter of You-Know-Who. Why?"
Draco wouldn’t be so prideful that he didn’t feel nervous around Fleur. She was, after all, a beautiful French girl that already captured many hearts of the student body. (Draco swears he heard something about her being part Veela.) But something about him had the ability to have more composure. He didn’t understand how but he didn’t question it if it led to the possibility of sitting with other Beauxbatons students later on.
"You had..." Draco trailed off. He didn't want to actually say it out loud.
of you listened to me!”
task?” Harry started.
?” The boy still didn't reply as he dragged Draco into the courtyard.
He didn’t necessarily have a problem with Moody. It was similar to Buckbeak that if it wasn’t in front of him, then he didn’t think much of it. But this was a moment he
"It was because he knew something, right?" Harry asked, making Ron's head jump from the table. It was the first time he'd spoken since they'd found out about Draco. "That's what he was going to tell us that morning."
The entire class turned to him and Draco felt the familiar chill of the spotlight. Trelawney was frozen in place, her bug-like eyes unwavering as she stared intently at him.
"I'm serious, I was blown away. Especially today! Like Malfoy. I never realized that he knew to do non-verbal spells. Do you think he'll be able to teach that to us?"
…so enjoy! Tell me what you think of the chapter and corrections are always welcomed! (especially if i kept seeing dots move across the screen as i wrote this around some hour late at night)
"I suppose you have questions,” She continued.
, was almost too much. He just kept thinking of how it is, or how it's going to be, rather.
“I should say so,” Draco giggled breathlessly, settling back down on the couch. He pushed his hair back behind his ear and glanced at Harry. “Do I still have paint on my face?”
Sirius Black didn’t look anything like his portrait on the Black family tree. His eyes were sunken, his hair matted with grease, ragged clothes over his bony figure.
"Potter and his group found her hanging on the torch bracket as we were coming back from the feast,” Michael said. Draco curled his lips inward.
'" Flitwick placed a hand on his chest as if to keep his heart inside.
Draco woke up in a cold, dark corridor.
“Well, what about you?!”
Are there inaccuracies in my portrayal of the Imperius Curse? Yeah most likely. Please kindly take this portrayal with a grain of salt then and remember that this is fanfic where anything goes.
“Has something tremendous happened recently?”
"Do you think he'll do an interview for
"Is everyone in your families wizards?" Potter asked the both of them.
of important things-- but
“Just tell him, Michael,” Anthony said, lightly kicking his feet in the air. “He’ll stop bothering you if you do.”
"Minerva, go fetch Mister Potter and Mister Weasley with Severus. This seems to deal with your students." Dumbledore spoke calmly. McGonagall nodded and followed Snape out of the hall. "Now that excitement is over, let me go over the rules for the first years." They reluctantly took their attention back to the Headmaster.
“Suit yourself.” Draco shrugged when he rearranged his homework and found his half-written Defense Against the Dark Arts notes. “Harry, what do you think of Moody?"
"Er, I got kicked out. I wandered into the Restricted Section while looking for books of Nicholas Flamel."
"Now? This late?"
“It did…” Draco thought unenjoyable memories were things people
. I guess I should've told someone and not a dark magic encrypted journal."
Fleur shrieked before pushing boldly in front of Draco. She pulled out her wand and held it in front of the woman. The woman had a soft lavender undercut that showed heavily pierced ears, her Auror robes battered with her badge missing a chunk.
The certain buzz of getting presents didn’t bring a bounce in Draco’s step like it normally did, but he walked towards the sitting room anyway with a pleasant smile. Both Narcissa and Lucius were waiting for him, gleaming gift-wrapped boxes at their feet. He received lavish presents. Shiny books, expensively imported trinkets, soft feeling robes. His favourite was the two signed posters from his beloved French Quidditch team. (One was from one of the Chasers and Captain, Josephine Marat, and the other was from the Keeper, Bastien Janvier.)
Aside from that, HRI has more translations! Thanks to the
Dumbledore's Army was... different from what Draco expected.
"Sorry, but your eggs were about to go cold," Mrs Boot said placing a plate in front of him. "I here I thought Terry would be the one who'd we have trouble waking."
“I think I’m going to stay,” The words escaped Draco’s mouth before he knew it.
“No, nothing's wrong. Just… I need to say something. Something that I've been meaning to say.”
“A lot of frustration,” Terry answered for Anthony.
“It’s nothing.”
) remarks himself, until Crabbe and Goyle, on instinct, followed Draco’s order and pulled Nil out of reach.
Along with wearing jumpers and denims with casual ease, Draco had not been putting product in his hair and had been wearing his least fancy clothing all around the mansion for the last month. He had tried wearing his 'fancy' clothes and styling hair once more, but it had made him look like a mini-Lucius. That right there should give anyone shivers.
“You would teach me how to make a Patronus?” Draco said instead.
The boy looked up then hastily turned his banner right side up.
"Snape?" Draco asked.
"Master, master, please!" Pettigrew cried, grasping at Ron. "Wasn't I a good rat? A good pet?"
"What? Who's looking?"
Draco wasn’t even surprised to see Anthony, sleep-rumpled and rubbing his eye.
would stay even after the surface wounds faded.
“That’s likely to never happen,” Michael said as he spread a long banner across his bed. "But we can't let that get to us."
The game started smoothly enough, Draco automatically finding Harry higher than the other players, searching for the Snitch. He also saw a player in green up there with Harry. Nil was taunting Harry and Draco felt his stomach drop. Looking at it from the stands, Draco could painfully see that there was no reason for the taunting. Neither Nil nor Harry would get anything out of it. It’ll lead to no where, but… that could’ve been him… it
“Draco! We weren’t talking about anything. And absolutely nothing about you.” Ron said oddly and both Harry and Hermiome shot him a glare. “How was your summer?”
y’all are precious when you leave your precious comments... all of you’s are so PRECIOUS.
“Thank you for that confident, reassuring answer,” Terry groaned as he collapsed back into his seat. “How am I even going to be able to have a nap now?”
He didn’t truly know that status of what positions his parents had with acknowledging their past. But he had to give them enough trust that they were trying to fix themselves as much as he was. His father wanted to be a better father. His mother wanted to be a better sister. They acknowledged it. And they were making amends.
"Maybe. I don't know really... We'll see."
“Are you really going to kill me, Harry?” Black asked.
“Your name is Terrence?” Michael asked.
Draco had never felt so uncomfortable. The reality of him being eleven again had passed (sort of), but seeing Diagon Alley, bustling with movement and
“She’s right, but...” Draco started while looking over her shoulder, doing a once over of the ingredients, “most are in Snape’s private storage.” Maybe it was a lack of focus and his aching headache that made him say, “I could probably get them for you.”
"Oh, my dear time traveller,
"What?"
Harry was wide-eyed as Draco and Fleur stepped inside to meet with them, Terry, Anthony, and Luna moving along to enter the dance.
Ron looked uneasy, glancing down at his toes every now and then. Hermione didn’t seem to mind and kept her gaze firmly on her dance partner. Ron caught Hermione's stare and he never moved his eyes away again.
“Would you like to have some tea with me?”
A familiar, playful owl circled Draco and dropped a letter onto Draco’s toast.
.” She sharply tightened her hand so Draco didn’t collide with a rushing trolley. She loosened her grip. “You must be smart. Just be sure to choose the right people you can count on and not just anyone--”
They were talking, the angry clattering of teapots and cups as Hagrid talked about how he finally noticed Lockhart’s enlarged ego.
Lucius moved to Harry, noticing the stack of books. "Mr. Potter," Draco's father greeted formally.
“But they supposedly don’t exist. How—”
"What do you think the minister is here for?" Draco asked Harry but turned to see that Harry's seat was empty.
A resurgence of panicked shouts sounded as Scabbers weaved through their jumping feet.
“It’s not your business…” Draco slid down to the floor. “It’s not anyone’s business, but my own.” There was a brief moment of nothing.
“That’s nice, dear.” She said pleasantly. Lucius didn’t say anything, despite looking like he wanted to. Nothing was spoken after that.
The dormitory door creaked and Terry shuffled inside, the

an answer.
Several people suddenly screamed and Draco saw the school's ghosts float in. One ghost stopped their conversation.
"Love, are you alright?" His mother asked. "You've been awfully quiet these past few days. Spending all your time in your room, daydreaming at meals... Is everything alright-”
Draco burst from the tent flap and nearly cried in relief at the sight of Harry who was alone, glaring at his leather bracers he fastened to his forearms.
"Why?"
It's legs twisted at angles, pearly white hair making a stark contrast against the dark leaves. "It's beautiful," Draco whispered. Harry took one step closer and something slithered out of the shadows. A hooded figure stalked the dead unicorn. Draco felt his blood go cold, his heart stopped.
“I think I know what to... expect." Draco felt the store shrinking as the reality of that statement sunk in. He wasn't supposed to be here. His whole body shook, waiting for the Dark Lord to just walk in and wake him up from this nightmare or dream or whatever this was.
“I still think you should give it a try,” Hagrid said sagely. “Jus’ to say ye did it. Come on, ‘ll help ye.”
"Can I ask you for something?"
“Thanks… I guess…”
“No, it’s fine! This is fine. What is it?”
The three other Ravenclaws studied him.
The meeting was bumpy and full of contradictions. Sirius seemed to attempt to talk about an object that the Order has hidden, but Mrs Weasley would make the conversation cut short. With the vague descriptions of updates and repeating rejections of letting any of the younger people in the room join the Order, Draco found the meeting pointless as Order members began saying closing remarks.
Draco pushed himself through the parents and managed to step up onto a train cart, the floor moving under him. He turned back to see his mother and Mrs. Weasley waving at him. Everything about the two women was different. From Narcissa’s carefully curled hair to Mrs. Weasley’s shoes that had one of the faux buckle straps hanging loosely off her heel. Narcissa glanced over at Mrs Weasley in scrutiny.
“That is no matter! I will teach you more.” She looped her arm through his. “Ah, I didn’t know zat ‘Ogwarts had French speakers! Zat is such a relief!”
Draco shrugged a tense shoulder. "Probably from being around you Gryffindor lot."
none of this should’ve been a possibility. He wasn’t supposed to be--Harry could never--
“I’m sorry, I didn’t think I’d scare you,” Draco said. “Are you okay?”
“Just get back to bed.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione all situated themselves across the row.
Draco walked the length of the platform, trying to find an entrance that wasn’t congested with people.
"If what will work?"
“Sirius Black?” Michael nodded. “Right … Keep forgetting about him.”
Sirius Black.
"There's no reason for Draco to be here as well," Mrs Weasley said as she ushered out a fuming Ginny out of the room. "Hasn't that boy been put through enough already?"
“It’s not that I don't trust you love; it’s just I don’t trust
Ron's eyes darted between them. "I'll give you guys a minute." He backed away and went to Hermione's bed, hiding them behind the divider.

“I didn’t mean to! I was just so—confused. Of all the things I thought I was going to hear, that wasn’t one of them.”
“Don’t hesitate to write to us or to Nymphadora, alright?” Andromeda briefly tightened her grip before pulling him into a hug. “I love you.”
Hermione's hand went up. "Professor, aren't those spells banned from being discussed in a classroom?"
"Quite, touching, isn't it?" Lockhart smiled at the two Gryffindors. "Also," he turned to Snape. "who are you?"
"I-I saw you in the sweet shop." Harry balled up his invisibility cloak. "Then you followed Nil out here. And, knowing Nil, he wouldn’t like that. Why did you follow him?”
“Uh, it was nice meeting you," not really, it was as awful as the first time, "but I have to get to my mother.“ Potter’s own smile disappeared.
Hermione gave him his final deathly hug when the five boys arrived at the Great Hall. The repeated "Why didn't you say anything?" was chastised at him. Weasley now had Draco to think of him as Ron. (He went into an underground tunnel of Salazar Slytherin's deadly mythical basilisk, he deserved at least that much.) Gryffindor was announced the House Cup winner once more, but the blonde didn't seem to care as he was pushed a plate of creamy sweets.
“Definitely. We’ll do so quite soon. The Polyjuice is almost done.”
"Why wouldn't I? You're my best friend." Draco's breathing stopped short.
“Beautiful.” Draco intoned. “I’m just not up for it, Professor. “I haven’t been feeling good all morning.”
"Dammit, now Hagrid's going to look for us now. We need to move."
“I should’ve known,” Potter shook his head. “You’re cruel, you know that?” He slammed his shoulder into Draco’s as he left the blond.
You can close your mouth now," Anthony said, elbowing Draco's arm.
Draco nodded. "Father never let us sleep overnight."
“Nothing’s wrong,” Draco mumbled. He removed himself out of her grasp. “Nothing’s wrong, honest.” Narcissa looked suspicious but didn't question him.
“I’m not thirsty. I’ll be going now. I really don’t feel good. Maybe I need to lie down. Bye, guys.” There was a chorus of concerned ‘bye’s (an added slug by Weasley) and Draco closed the door behind him, giving himself a moment to sort out his mess of thoughts before walking towards Hogwarts. He was halfway up the steps of the entrance hall when someone shouted his name.
“It’s nothing, mate. Just magic being magic.”
"You said you had to tell me something. What was it? I don’t think I got it.“ Harry stared hard at his hands in his lap.
"What is it?" Nothing was in Potter's hands.
The rest of that day, he was on edge.
“Oh, yes, yes, a good daughter, that one. Oh, at least there's
“Yes, it is.” Lucius pulled out an old, broken pocket watch from his robes. “Hold onto this." He held out the watch's chain.
Draco stumbled as the train groaned to a complete stop, metal shrieking against metal.
They looked up and their eyes widened at the sight of the two boys.

He gathered all the letters and placed them on top of a
“Eh, not really. Though, when we do talk she has some…
“D’you need anything?” Ron asked.
(See the end of the chapter for
Comments are appreciated and well loved! (Seriously, your comments are the sweetest things in my life!)
"I don't want to talk about it." Draco bit out.
"See, Hermione? Nothing's up." Harry gently grabbed Draco's arm and pulled him off the wall.
Nearing the goalposts, he saw it. Hovering near the Ravenclaw’s Keeper’s foot, the Snitch quivered.
“Draco?”
They were all comforting Granger and defending her as Draco stayed silent. It was the second time this has happened, no, was it the third? He couldn’t remember anymore. It was still so…
! Please give it lots of love!!!!
Draco, wet and cold, sat on the edge of Harry's bed.
“I’ve been meaning to ask you, son,” Lucius asked. “How is your arm?”
“You might feel a little lightheaded from the blood loss so drink this.” She uncorked a potion and placed it in Draco’s hand. The potion left a sour taste but Draco drank it all the same.
"Guys, it’s me.”
Michael said
“But it’s nothing like dragons again.”
“No...”
than this. Draco took a final deep breath, wiping away at his wet face. “It’s fine. I’m fine.” The boy stood up, a wave lightheadedness causing him to stumble. “I need to get back to the others.” Draco turned towards to the door, trying to push away from the compartment. He just needed to get away.  “I’ll feel better there.”
“How is this something that needs to be done?! What can possibly justify what you plan on doing? This is a dangerous thing you’re planning, Lucius. Dangerous, insane—and unneeded! How do you know that Pettigrew isn’t lying? He’s been doing so for 12 years!”
He felt as if he knew the outcome for Bulgaria was going to lose overall but it didn’t really matter given that his friends were there with interesting reactions to the game especially towards the end when Ron saw himself as the winner of his and Michael's bet.
Harry nodded. “Meant to eat nothing but vegetables and fruits the entire summer.”
do that again! All of us was worried. I think Michael was about to cry."
"You're not really Slytherin material anymore." How was he not Slytherin material anymore? What did that even mean?
Tonks rapped a particular rhythm on the door. The door cracked open and Harry peeked out. Draco's heart rate spiked. At the sight of Tonks, Harry opened the door wider and grinned.
Students in light blue uniforms poured into the Great Hall.
The music started playing and they moved across the practice floor adequately enough. As Snape counted the tempo in his flat voice, Draco studied Pansy's face.
"Is this your first year?"
"Guys, enough—"
By Christmas morning, Draco had memorized the entire tree. From the repeated uses of the name Sirius and Regulus from previous family members to always lingering on Andromeda’s kind eyes.
"I don't know, something about the gamekeeper--"
“Nothing’s up with me. What would be up with me?”

"What was that about?"
hope everyone had a happy pride month!!
"What's
"Anything for you, mate." Terry jumped onto his bed, taking a candy out of his pile. He quickly unwrapped it and popped it into his mouth.
He’d be damned if he got that same fate.
"Jus' lookin'," Hagrid was shifting nervously. "An' what're you lot up ter? Yer not still lookin' fear Nicholas Flamel, are yeh?"
Draco opened his mouth before shutting it instantly.
They all sat awkwardly around the small table.
Lucius was still trying to process all he was told after Harry explained everything.
"He's been glancing at you for quite a while," a snickering voice on his other side said. Draco turned to see another Ravenclaw looking at him, a boy.
made a
Now that Draco wasn't looking at Michael's facepaint through a mirror, he could clearly see that 'BULGARIA' was written completely, utterly backwards.
“I KNOW WHAT WE SAID!”
Merlin’s beard, he could already feel himself getting a headache.
"I should probably go, too,” Draco said, prying away Fred’s arm and hurrying towards Michael for means of escape. (Fred and George managed to catch on to Draco's presence and have been stubbornly sitting on either side of the blond much to the displeasure of Harry.) “I'll see you all during the match!" He hurried out to catch up to Michael, ignoring the Weasley twin’s falsely despaired goodbyes and Harry's half-formed protest.
Draco turned around to see Potter wiping at his eye and wondered what was
“How? My parents are Death Eaters. They’ve always been so. I’m a Death Eater.”
"--got hit with a memory charm."
"Tom was--Riddle was--I trusted him so easily, Harry." Draco's voice was small, struggling to stay levelled. "I didn't know what I was doing--I just wanted someone to talk to--I never imagined that this would happen."
Please?”
“Why are you back here?" Crabbe asked. “We were looking for you.”
He’s probably running up to the dormitory right now.”
“Yes, Aunt Andromeda," Draco said.
"Huh? Already?" How deep can he get into his thoughts? It didn't even seem like that long.
“It’s nothing, Harry. It makes me happy that you asked for me. Are you coming with me?”
” the boy seethed.
"How so, Draco? How will Buckbeak be fine? He's going to be executed!"
“Never mind that. You know that everyone thinks he’s a gift to the Wizarding World?”
Draco broke into a grin and ran towards the boy. He didn’t even hesitate to launch himself around the other blond’s neck. “Anthony!” His cry muffled in the boy's collarbone.
“Draco!” He turned around and saw someone bound over to him.
Michael rolled his eyes. “Anyone can wear a shirt. The devoted fans take it to the next level. Come on!” He took Draco’s wrist and dragged him onto a stool. He grabbed a paint jar. Unscrewing it, he dipped a finger inside. “Now, hold still.” He instructed before touching a red-tipped finger to Draco’s cheek and alternated to the other. “And there… we... go! Perfect,” He grabbed the hand mirror with his clean hand to hold it up for Draco. “Now you look like you’re getting into it!”
The Firebolt gleamed with new polish. Children were jabbing at the glass, innocently wishing of wanting the fast broom to fly. Flying, Quidditch. Something Draco actually loved. It was an amazing experience in itself. Draco would practice all throughout the summer, hoping that he'll be enough to beat Potter the next year. It was something he missed. But it wasn't something he felt allowed to. Not anymore. Draco turned away from the Firebolt.
something that Draco wanted to do. He didn’t need to create an obsession with the boy based on the demented thought that he didn’t do enough, then Cedric was a dead man walking.
Draco wanted to drop a kiss on Harry’s hand to see if it would remove the pain.
So it’s not a dream, yes, he’s established that now.
“How could me snotting up your clothes be important to you?”
"Right, we should grab a stall," Harry said. The three went into separate stalls, each locking them.
Draco saw Harry was tense the whole time they were under the cloak.
The next few nights were the same way.
Not wanting to overhear the chatter, Draco went back to the dormitory to lay down before class, shutting himself back into his bed. Yet when his head hit his pillow he was pulled into long sleep that found himself opening his eyes to the sun much lower than the last time Draco saw it.
different,
before the Christmas party.
“How are you feeling?”
“I… just wanted to get rid of this, but…” It was hard to keep his tone level, "burning it didn’t seem to work.” Luna tilted her head before grabbing the diary again.
"I would fix them, but we're not allowed to use magic."
“You really shouldn’t have to be…”
They placed their bags down in Terry's room and Terry ushered them back outside and into the outskirts of his neighbourhood. Pavement gave way to dirt paths and soon Terry was leading the three into a large field.
“You were nice to me, Draco. It should be known that I should do something in return.”
did you say about the Weird Sisters?").
"Yeah."
“Jeez, he must not like hearing he’s a subpar Quidditch player compared to you.” Michael knocked his elbow into Draco’s side.
“Professor—the door—it's been vandalised--“ Clearwater wobbled. A ripple of whispers fanned the Ravenclaw crowd. She let Dumbledore and Flitwick up the staircase. The Ravenclaws muttered on what could happen to have Dumbledore investigate. As they waited for the teachers, the Ravenclaws chattered on what Clearwater meant by ‘vandalised.’ Dumbledore reappeared first, bearing no intense reaction compared to Flitwick’s small, pale, startled face.
Moody’s tongue darted out. “Yes…”
"Wait, Harry," He turned towards the boy who froze in place.
“Actually, Draco has the highest grade—Draco?” Granger stopped talking and saw that he was looking down, seeming lost in thought.
“Nothing’s going to happen to you. Not with your favourite cousin on the watch. Got it?” Tonks sighed, resting her cheek on top of Draco’s head. “My dear cousin, you’ll be okay.”
"Um, Quidditch!" Harry enthused when he caught up. "You've seen the Firebolt, right?"
"I found it in the fireplace," Luna said and she didn't look the slightest bit phased. "I thought you'd want it back."
“The Black tapestry! My prized family heirloom. In that room on the left over there.” She pointed down the hall. “Shows all the good members of the family.”
“Yes, a date.”
Errol might be old but he wasn't letting that get the better of him. And neither should Draco.
“So much so that you were having a dream about it?”
“I know a secret. About Crouch. He doesn’t know how many secrets I've gathered from my time in the Ministry.”
Draco, who didn’t want to sit in silence, stood up. “I’m tired. I think I’m going to go to my room for a nap.”
He did a double take when a moving group of green robes marched their way to the field.
Harry leaned forward to place a quiet kiss on Draco’s cheek. “Goodnight.”
Potter didn’t answer. Everything about his movements seemed hindered as if he was recovering from a severe blow.
Draco reached out and grasped Harry's arm. “I’ll make sure you are if you do.”
Draco shook his head to refocus. Now wasn't the time to watch 'programs.'
Draco turned and saw men with wild hair, dark eyeliner circling their eyes, overlapping leather bracelets that reached their elbows, and dangling earrings climb on a stage. Tonks is going to lose her mind when he tells her about this.
“Do you accept, Mister Malfoy?”
She scoffed. "Ugh, I can't believe she's already managed to print it out. Nothing in that article is true whatsoever, Draco, trust me."
“You think Ireland’s gonna lose?” Ron asked, reaching out for another biscuit from the centre of the coffee table.
Fletcher turned toward the Slytherin stands as if surprised that his housemates even knew his name. He put his face in a determined sneer. When he held up his Snitch enfolded fist, the Slytherin crowd exploded with cheers.
Draco gave him the satisfaction of stumbling but kept his focus on the snow-speckled floor. He gathered a breath and continued toward the train station, forcing himself to not look back.
“As long as nothing catches fire, I’m good,” Michael replied. Draco heard the noise of Micheal’s pillow collapsing onto his weight. “Happy Hanukkah, mate.”
“Of course. I can’t miss Mrs Weasley’s cooking.”
"I really don't know, Father."
“Oh, I don’ judge other professors,” Hagrid waved his hands in front of him. “I do worry that he’s always out w’ a sickness. Makes me wonder wot it is that’s always makin ‘im feel bad.” A ruckus outside the hut made them all look up. “Oop, that’d be Buckbeak.” (Hagrid started to put Buckbeak outside whenever Draco came around.) “Must’ve run out of ferrets. Be right back.” Hagrid excused himself and stepped outside.
“You don’t like… Saying that you don't, er…”
It was one particular day of the two owls flapping their wings and their feathered puffing up spectacularly that made Aunt Andromeda stop and ask Draco, “is it about your parents?”
The stands exploded in cheers and a band began to play until Harry bellowed, "HE'S BACK! VOLDEMORT'S BACK!"
. Draco's hand felt warm in his and Harry hoped that he could pass off the lie that his palms were getting sweaty because he fought the Serpent of Slytherin. "I don't know how I could ever repay you." Harry looked back up to the grey eyes that he liked so much.
“Nothing, nothing, I didn’t mean anything by that,” Draco paused for a moment to gather his thoughts. “I promise. I’ll go with you next Hogsmeade trip.”
Draco was tapped by a girl with radish earrings. “Luna,” Draco greeted. “What is it?”
that. Just as you
Gabrielle, Cho, and Mrs. Krum seemed very pleased at the admission but Draco wished Dumbledore would
“Hermione’s going to want to dance.”
, Draco thought.
“Vhat a bad memory to have of the Yule Ball…”
"I don't want to have this discussion in public. There's a reason I didn't response as soon as I got the news. I wanted to tell you face to face. I find it agreeable, don't you?"
“I like you.”
"It's one of the biggest Quidditch tournaments of all time!" Ron's eyes got starry-eyed. "Dozens of countries compete for the World Cup. Imagine this years' Quidditch cup but ten times more intense! Merlin, I hope Dad’s able to get tickets! It’d be an amazing way to enter fourth year with!”
"Quite a chance for us to meet," Draco played along and laughing and grabbing the attention of Lucius.
“He’s kind, and loyal, and caring, and—er, never mind.” Draco cleared his throat and fission of adrenaline phasing through his body.
Draco’s mother arched a perfect eyebrow. The red-haired woman flattened her flyaway curls under her hat, clearing her throat.
“Professor, believe me, I didn’t do anything to the Hufflepuff—“
While Michael baulked at such an insane question, Draco answered. “He’s Bulgaria's Seeker. And he’s
"Hmm, true. Hey, I think it's the small one!"
"Yes, but I didn’t—huh?”
"Goodbye, love." Narcissa planted a kiss on his forehead before giving him a gentle smile. "Have a good first year. Send letters."
“He’s going to make everything worse now that he’s back," Draco mumbled. "You-Know-Who.”
Anthony stopped to look back. “Yeah?”
, and (my favourite)
"I’m just having a nice day! Oh, the strangest thing happened a while ago. Some Durmstrang student came up to me looking for you and, I swear to you, he looked just like Viktor Krum. Almost identical! Mate, imagine Viktor Krum wanting to talk to you and imagine him coming to
“Draco, it’s alright. We can work this out. Together. Let us help you—” Anthony put a hand on Draco’s arm but the blond twisted away from his grasp.
“Draco!” Harry went to his side. “Are you okay?”
“You know, a walk.” Draco dramatically rolled his eyes. “I'm sure you've heard of it. We could just... hang out around the Great Lake.” Suddenly, Draco couldn’t look Harry in the eye, and an unknown feeling of doubt crept into Draco’s stomach. “You don’t have to, of course. I’m not forcing you to do it. I just thought we could we could… spend some time together. Remember our promise from last year to hang out together.” Draco frowned at his own self. Nothing sounded bad what he said but it still didn’t feel right. Why does it seem he can’t even talk to a regular human being? How do friendships function like this?
Harry wavered. “Right! Right, er, I was going to go send an owl to Sirius." He held up a sealed letter. "We can think of a place afterwards."
“Come on, Harry. Who would turn down
"No, I saw the Headmistress of Beauxbatons with Hagrid," Harry defended him. "She probably told her. And Krum probably knows as well. And Cedric now that I've told him."
"He’ll be out of the Hospital Wing soon, do you really want to wake him up from his recovery?”
Distant shouting of Draco’s name fell short to his ears.
“Moving on, while it seems you’ve been taught extensively about creatures, you’ve had no training when it comes to curses! It's about time someone taught you about these," Moody grabbed a piece and chalk and scrawled a title on the board. "The Unforgivable Curses."
The idea that he could actually sabotage Diggory was a half-formed at best, not to mention that he almost felt like cheating Diggory out of the respect and recognition he gained from the Hogwarts students.
“I… don’t know what I think of him.”
“It’s nothing. Just… it’s stupid.”
“Right.” Harry reached out to Draco’s hands. “I’m… I’m really happy right now. Happiest I've been all year.”
climbed out? I never felt more ashamed. We are above those traitors.“ Draco fisted his hands over his knees.
Sirius was at his side instantly. “Remus, did you take your potion?” He grabbed Lupin’s shaking shoulders. “Remus! Remus, listen to me, you can control it!” Lupin was heaving, curling in on himself. “You can fight this! I know you can!
Anthony snorted. “Hardly.” he moved to lean against Draco’s bedpost, crossing his arms as he watched Draco fuss with his hair. “Hey, did no one else ask you to the ball?”
Harry tried not to let his hope swell over the fact that there was an empty spot next to Ron across the table, yet Draco chose the one next to him.
That managed to make Draco smile. "It's really good to meet you, too."
"Headmaster, you don't think--" Flitwick started to say before a hair-raising giggle sent his eyes upward.
"Draco, hold on now--" Michael held up his hands.
"But I would like to know what you're hiding. One day. I'll figure it out." Granger smiled.
Draco slammed his hands against the table. He pushed away from the table and ran out of the room. He vainly tried to stomp his feet on the soundless marble stairs. At least he gave his door a satisfying slam.
The book gave a lazy grunt as he continued until it became still.
There was a pause.
"What is it Draco?"
“I don’t remember Valentine’s being like this last year…” Michael said, gagging at the lace under their plates as he and Terry sat across from Draco and Anthony.
Draco gathered Harry’s hands. “I’m here, Harry. ”
Wasn’t he doing homework a second ago? Draco saw the window and saw the orange-rusted sky that showed the day coming to an end.
big loves!
"Can I ask you something," Harry questioned.
After being stuffed with a delightful feast, the four boys walked with the large group of Ravenclaws back to the tower.
"But you didn't freak out."
Draco tore his hand away and bolted away.
Standing up with a flourish, he left his room and went downstairs. He entered the living room and found Tonks sprawled on the couch, watching a sitcom as she mindlessly gnawed on a liquorice wand.
“I want to, Lucius. I truly do, but… I’m worried. Things aren’t going to be the same anymore. How are you going to do it?”
A fit of anger that Draco never experienced before plagued him at an alarming speed. What did some woman from the
. A shiver traveled all over his body. Draco stared down at his hand, his mind thinking of everything it could be but blood.
ALSO ALSO, there is some lovely fanart by
like! And it’s not like you don’t know that you're the infamous Draco Malfoy.” Fletcher shook his head. He released his hair and looked up to flash his flat eyes. “Smart, perfect, great Quidditch player, Draco Malfoy. The type of guy who's been pissing me off since day one.” Nil stomped over to the blond who hastily starting backing away.
"I was... sleepwalking."
Draco shook his head. “I shouldn’t have gotten angry as well. Or make it seem that I knew about your own parents better than you. I hope you’re still not mad.”
Fletcher Nil was glaring at them, blocking their path. Crabbe and Goyle were standing dutifully behind him to give off the menacing look that Nil couldn’t achieve himself. Draco steadily kept his gaze away from both of them.
“Let’s go,” Draco said. All four of them were leaving for the holidays.
"Ron, cut it out--" Harry started, annoyed.
Draco brought his hand up to tuck his hair back only to have it stubbornly go back in its place in his eyes. Harry inwardly groaned. When Draco tried to tuck back his hair it always left Harry's stomach uncomfortably fluttering.
Narcissa rushed over and buried her face into Andromeda’s curls. There were sounds of weeping.
"M-Mr. Malfoy," He nodded.
reached his ears and he turned back around to see Harry had hit the back of his head against the wall, his eyes closed tightly. “Did you hit your head?”
Ugh, hasn’t he been through this already?
“You’re staring at me.”
“McGonagall announced the Yule Ball during class today,” Harry said.
"I can't say." Draco's voice was groggy, tears still soaking the other boy's shirt. His fingers were clinging onto the worn cotton as he trembled.
Anthony grinned. “I always am.” He stood. “Now let’s finally get to bed.”
"Did you know about that?" Draco asked, his focus on the newspaper.
Draco rolled his eyes. “He doesn’t want to talk to me and I won’t force him.” He shuffled Hagrid’s case notes. “I’ve been going through enough in my own life as it is.”
“He’s an artist!” Ron proclaimed. “Totally reinvents the entire game of Quidditch!”
“Yes, yes. Strange, he didn’t mention that to me about his own son...” Moody muttered.
“What’s going to happen with Sirius?” Draco asked.
“Let’s just not bother with him this year.”
Nothing was fine--Because his cousin was in danger--Fleur was in danger--Viktor was in danger--Cedric was in danger--Harry was in a danger.
Anthony pulled Terry off to the side. “Terry, are you
Fletcher looked at the large hands have a firm grip on his upper arms, surprise written all over his face. Crabbe and Goyle as looked amazed that they were still compelled to follow Draco, both of the Slytherin goons blinking owlishly at their old leader. Draco felt a lump in his throat.
“Then you promise to come to the next Hogsmeade trip?” Michael asked. “As much as I
want to get on Moody's bad side, both for his benefit and not tainting the friendship he and Tonks had. Draco didn't understand Moody one bit and, unfortunately, it seemed like he needed to. But he didn't think that he'll figure out in time.
!” Michael bellowed out, launching onto Draco’s back and causing all four of them to crash to the ground.
“Wait, you can transfix clothes? How do you know that?”
Draco smiled at that. “Me too…”
I'll collect my ten galleons then, Weasley.” He pointed an accusing finger at the redhead.
“Nothing, it’s really not important anymore.”
Draco’s French burnout made him take a moment to process. “Er…
“Yes.” Draco nodded. “I really like Harry Potter.”
Draco crept over to look over Harry’s shoulder. It was a doodle of a Snitch. Draco rolled his eyes on how it was
“Of course, Mother.”
. What's going
"Sure, if that's what you think," he replied chirpily, then turned his attention back to his peas.
“No. I suppose not.”
“Stop whining we're here," Terry said, standing beside a large oak tree. He sat down and laid up against it. "It's one of my favourite spots here at home. To nap mostly, but the view can be nice sometimes."
Nil glared at Draco, his dark eyes held anger, but beyond that, there was nothing that could be perceived. Grey eyes seemed to be looking through a blank, black space that one could trick themselves to believe it had depth. It was like looking through nothing as if Nil wasn’t supposed to be there at all.
"He's been talking to Creevey for weeks now." Ron managed to say between bites of toast.
"Fred? George? Are you there?" Molly Weasley called.
Michael shoved Terry off his bed and stuck out his tongue at him.
Draco was pulled from sleep slowly. His eyes cracked open to the pitch-black dormitory, the hiss of rain pelting the windows. Sluggishly, he tried to piece together what woke him up when lightning flashed through the room, illuminating a decrepit man holding a gleaming knife.
“Harry!” Draco jumped under Anthony’s arm. “Merlin, you scared me.”
Draco rolled his eyes and attempted to push himself to his feet, but stumbled. Harry rushed forward and steadied Draco with a hand on his back.
Gryffindor called a time-out and Michael was left silently fuming as the rain built to a steady pour.
"I heard that you lived with muggles. How were they?"
Malfoy took his arm back and continued down the corridor. Nothing felt particularly wrong with that interaction but it felt… strange.
Colin Creevey spun around and his eyes lit up. “Oh, hi, Draco! I haven’t talked to you in ages!” He turned his body back and took a few steps back down. “I came back because I forgot my camera! And to think I wouldn't even develop any of the film I have! I saw your Quidditch match against Hufflepuff. Wow! What a game! I got some great pictures of that killer move you did at the end! How have you been?” He said in one breath as he stopped in front of the other boy.
“Yeah.”
And Tom Riddle opened the lid and climbed out.
"He isn't going to wake up," a soft voice said. Harry's gaze went to the wall where a tall, black-haired boy was leaning casually. Harry has seen the boy before.
Harry shoved himself off Ron, straighten his clothes. "Draco, hi," he smiled as he walked forward before he hit his hip on a display table, seeming unaware that it was in his pathway. The stack of books shuddered as a warning. "sorry, sorry," he mumbled. Draco glanced over to see Ron a dissolve into laughter outside.
Crabbe and Goyle stepped out of the stalls.
“No, not really.” Draco also shook his head when the house-elf gestured to the tea.
likes
“Sort of. Why?”
“Yes, professor,” Harry grumbled. McGonagall nodded and went up the stairs and out of sight.
Hagrid knocked on the castle door, and Professor McGonagall swung open the door after a moment. The smell of dusty, old air filled Draco’s nose as they walked down a torch-lit corridor.
There was a good chance that if he went in he would see Harry.
Gird your loins and have this
The blond blew out a sharp breath. Going back home didn’t sound like a holiday at all.
Draco cleared his throat. “No, nothing like that.” He placed the back of his hand against his cheek to feel the warmth, the heat reminding him of how close Harry’s mouth was to his that night. He shook his head. “He didn’t do—that. Nothing like that happened. Tonks, don’t even joke about that.”
Draco imagined doing the same thing; moaning and groaning, complaining after being healed to an unimpressed Madam Pomfrey. Only willing to do so because no one else was around to see. “It was only a scratch. It’s happened before.” Draco said grumpily. Madam Pomfrey raised an eyebrow.
"You sure you’re a Ravenclaw?” Weasley asked.
Harry’s eyes bulged as his face pinked. “I-I mean…” He seemed to flounder for a word. “I just noticed that you’re both--You’re--You’re both… You’re both… Blond.”
“Er… hi, Anthony,” he coughed, putting his empty goblet on the table. ”It’s research.”
“Hasn’t someone asked you?”
“I still want to say sorry."
The game was called to be over with Gryffindor being the winner. When Draco managed to get on the field, the Gryffindor players came down and started surrounding Harry. He could hear Lockhart's voice and Harry's weak protests. The gasps that happened up in front made it obvious that Lockhart did something idiotic.
. Everything was
"Draco?" The redhead narrowed his eyes.
“Not true!” Michael said. “Draco and I went to the Quidditch World Cup!” He grinned and draped his arms around Draco. “Looks I’m better than you two.”
“The progress is never over since life is always shifting. It's been said before, Draco. The future’s not set in stone. We must understand that part of us and continue the work. To show that we do not follow our ancestors. Draco,” Aunt Andromeda reached out to cover his hand with her own. “Know that we have to understand that are doing what we can. You are not your father who made the choice. Whether or not he thought it was for you, it was still him who did so without your input. Do you understand?"
“Thank you.” Draco picked up his quill to get back to work.
"Why's that?" Hermione asked.
Draco had to put extra effort to swallow his bite. “Shut it.”
Harry made a strange noise.
When the Weird Sisters said they were going to go on a break, Terry wiped the sweat gathered at his brow. “I’m beat. I’m going to find something to drink and sit down for a moment. Wanna join me?"
Luna was idling in the common room, staring at the ceiling's painted night sky, twisting back and forth so her large rainbow tulle ruffles on her dress swished, her perpetual radish earrings doing the same.
Draco pinned his gaze to the floorboard, the edges of his vision going fuzzy.
Draco looked over at the Gryffindor table to see Ron shaking Harry’s shoulder as if demanding an answer. Harry, feeling eyes on him, met Draco’s gaze before turning away quickly. Harry’s answer must’ve been unsatisfying because Ron slapped a hand on his forehead while Harry stared down to his plate, his face going pink.
Harry reacted instantly. He slammed his hand on the still-wet ink and hunched his shoulders. “Draco!” he shouted and received a hiss of silence from the other students. “Draco. Hey, hi, didn’t see you there.” Harry greeted in a quieter voice.
“All those... mudbloods that'll be here soon. I need time alone." He put as much venom into his voice as he could, but his voice still shook at the word.
"Enough," Sirius said. "We have business to attend to."
"I guess you should come as well, Mr. Weasley..." McGonagall said. "I'm sorry to show you this, but there was another attack, a
Draco woke up the next morning thinking the previous night was a strange nightmare, but the weary looks Anthony, Terry, and Michael gave him told him that the night was very much real.
The urge to escape disappeared.
"Did I pin you, sweetie?" The witch fitting him asked, having noticed how he had gone rigid.
"It wasn’ Draco, Professor Dumbledore! I was talkin’ to him mere seconds before that kid was found. There’s no way he could of—“
Draco gathered a breath, then another. “I’ve always had something that told me what to do. My visions... they show what’s to happen so then I can prepare and I’m not faced with impossible decisions. But I… I don’t have anything about this. There’s
“Okay, what’s up with you?” Anthony said, putting down his fork, forgetting his scrambled eggs.
“Why?” He asked, still trying to shake off drowsiness. "What for?"
She looked over at him incredulously. “Yeah,” She settled her attention back to the television. “I’m Sirius Black’s parole officer.”
“Well, it’s simple then. I don’t put my name in the goblet,” Harry said. “Then I won't get chosen. Right?”
“You don’t
Sombre wasn’t the mood to describe the Ravenclaw tower, but complacent silence. Cho Chang congratulated on Draco’s defence against Harry, but it only made Draco feel worse. After making a half-hearted promise to Michael that they’d beat Gryffindor next time, he was finally released to go to bed.
“A friend,” Draco said offhandedly.
“Yeah. Yeah! It sounds nice,” Michael said. “I’d like to go.”
There was a sweep of commotion and Harry collapsed onto the field.
When he received faces of confusion he defended, "I was planning on growing it out this summer!"
But did Draco... attack Mrs. Norris?
”Will you?” Weasley asked with the same amount of feeling. Draco threw a hand in the air.
“Really? I could’ve sworn that
“Piss off or I’ll take it back,” Draco whined as he shoved Anthony off enough for only the boy’s arm to be left over his shoulders.
Harry reached up to touch Draco’s cheek and the blond hastily stepped out of the embrace.
The boy wildly searched the air to see what was the cause. He found none. Fletcher gave Draco one last scowl. “Like, I said,
"Harry?" Draco called quietly. Harry looked up to see the blond staring down at Riddle's diary.
"'Darling?'" Draco whispered as he pulled himself towards the table.
all this. Cedric'll be fine.
Even after the four were returning to Ravenclaw Tower, Terry was still covering and uncovering his ears. "I think I still have a ringing sound. I wasn't expecting that. What even was that thing?"
While the platform began to fill, Draco practised little spells nonverbally. Getting lost in the magic, he didn't hear the door open again.
Tonks reached out for Draco's hand and they disappeared with a
Sounds of Mrs. Weasley’s worried voice began drawing closer to the room. "Draco, dear?" Her head popped in and she sighed in relief when he saw him up. “Oh, goodness. Ronald told me you’ve woken." She hurried over to him and placed her palm on Draco's forehead. "Are you alright, dear?”
“For what?”
"Me too."
“Hogwarts, please give them the kindest, warmest hospitality," Dumbledore said.
"It's my favourite thing. I used to play a lot before--I started school." Draco finished shortly, his mood dimming. "I'd like to think I was good." Draco distractedly put the Charms spellbook in Harry's arms.
Oddly enough, he did want to help. He wanted to hack at such a thought.
” she spat at Draco. “They were both helping him!” She turned to Harry and Ron. “Lupin--he’s a werewolf. And Draco--Draco’s a
The morning was slightly better for Draco.
A group of Hufflepuff boys came into the hall to push Cedric Diggory towards the goblet. Diggory playfully swatted at their hands so he could walk through the Age Line by himself. He raised his folded parchment up to the flames.
“As for you, you’ll be helping Lockhart answer fan mail.” Draco had to thin his lips to keep a laugh inside.
“Yes…” Draco answered instinctively, still trying to recover from the volume.
"Yes, yes, I'll escort you back, all three of you."
“Why are we getting a present from Mrs. Weasley?” Draco asked.
“Come on we have to dance!” Terry pulled him to the gathering crowd on the dance floor.
“Nothing much! I just wasn't feeling hungry this morning. Or this afternoon."
“Has it begun spewing fire?"
"Difficult. Very difficult," a small voice whispered in his ear and he shivered at the odd closeness.
“Yes,” Draco said, surprising and hating himself.
“Andromeda, I know none of this makes sense. You have every right to refuse me. But I want you to know… I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.” Narcissa’s voice broke. “I didn’t do anything when you were cast out of the family. I did nothing to stop them. I didn’t stop Mother, Father, Bellatrix. I didn’t stop any of them. I just stood by and watched. And that makes it worse.”
Scabbers, more bony and ragged than the last time Draco’s seen him, was panicking in her hands. Shrieking, whiskers quivering, moving his tiny paw over her fingers, vainly trying to kick at her fingers.
Hermione paused as they found her. Her hair carefully straightened and in an artful knot on top of her head, a periwinkle dress. As she descended, Draco noticed her face was lightly covered in glitter.
Draco couldn't help the smile he had at the Christmas dinner. Draco would talk to Michael (Terry and Anthony went home) and other Ravenclaws. Laughing at jokes, friendly jostling, open smiles.
"I need to show you something."
“Draco!” He ran over to Draco who was sitting up and rubbing his eyes.
Draco didn’t say anything. He didn't want to deal with their reactions today. That was a concern for another day.
“Yeah… a great thing actually.”
"Mr. Malfoy, I've heard rumours going around saying that
If Divination said anything, Draco and Harry were still not on speaking terms.
"You know I love you, don't you?" It took more power than necessary to not look surprised at the comment.
“It's been a while, Remus." Black turned to Draco. "Thank you for the assist… cousin."
you like her?”
"Are you
“Oh, shut up and get on with it!” Ron shoved the robes into his face.
"It’s probably nothing, you know? It's probably some sick prank by the Slytherins," Anthony said, non discreetly looking at Michael and Terry, who vigorously nodded.
"Yeah... they don’t seem the type.” Draco’s voice was so quiet that Terry, who was a few feet away, couldn’t hear him.
Draco's memories interjected.
“Are you okay?” Harry asked after a moment but winced as if regretted the words.
Harry’s name get put into the Goblet of Fire in the first place then?
"Oh, we found out who he is ages ago. And we know what that dog's guarding, it's a Sorcerer's St-"
"Do you mean that?"
“It’s--It’s just a matter of circumstances. If I wasn’t in certain situations with Harry and if I wasn’t there where I was--He would have never liked me. I’ve seen it before. He’s meant to go out with someone else.”
Draco glanced up at the sky hesitantly. “It’s beautiful. But why are we out here? Is something wrong?”
"What was that?" Michael mumbled, rubbing his shoulder.
“How about we enjoy the match then?” Lucius suggested.
here," Draco said.
“Can I what?” Draco mumbled through his chocolate piece.
"Sitting with us?" Micheal raised an eyebrow, seeing Draco push himself into the compartment as well. "That's new." The four boys in the compartment shuffled around, struggling as they pushed trunks above them, all collapsing in a seat when it was finished. "What's up?" Micheal finally asked.
“It wasn’t a real me--”
Draco swallowed thickly. “Harry, I need to say something. Something that I should’ve said much sooner.”
Draco turned back to punch Harry’s arm. “Oh, shut up you—
"Have you ever felt... like you weren't needed? Or felt out of place?“ Draco knew he should be feeling embarrassed for even considering sharing his feelings like some wimpy first year, but he didn’t feel like Tom would hold it against him. Tom was his friend. He trusted Tom with his biggest secrets. He was the only one that could be trusted with his secrets.
“Uhm,” Draco felt his pinned smile strain. “What’s that, professor?”
“Oh, it’s so nice to finally meet you! Terrence always talks about you three!”
Madam Pomfrey plugged the empty potion bottle as Hagrid released Draco so he could gulp down air. “I’ve… also notified your father about this incident, Mister Malfoy.”
“Michael gave it to me. Does it look alright?”
“Whoa!” Anthony stumbled to keep himself upright with the unexpected weight. “Okay, this a hug.” He clapped Draco’s back in greeting. “Where’s this coming from? Is everything okay? Oh, no, wait.” He abruptly pulled Draco back by the shoulders.
Of all things that could’ve broken Draco’s fragile composure, it was the twitchy secondhand of the Dark Lord, Peter Pettigrew.
dramatic.” Draco pressed his fingernails into his palms. “You’ve never acted like this before…"
Half past twelve, the Honeydukes Express witch that passed out candy came around, asking if they'd like anything from the trolley. Potter went and bought some of everything and shared it between the three of them (Draco's eye twitching when he saw the dozens of Galleons Potter had). Draco had a piece of Liquorice Wand almost torn off when Potter suddenly spoke up.
Draco climbed out of bed and went over to Terry's area. He picked up the newspaper and unfurled it to read the headline.
Draco, be honest with me. Truly. Why are you trying to… fight this?”
Ron moaned in despair while Michael just shook his head.
“You weren’t responding to my calls! Mrs Boot has been calling us for breakfast for forever!”
Snape gave them a long stare before slipping his wand back to his hand. Pettigrew was dragged back up into the air.
He slowly turned back around.
The smoke and oppressive waves of heat made Draco feel lightheaded, the dull roar making the hair on the back of his neck shiver in vague recognition. His heart was thundering, his breaths cutting too quickly just to be from rising smoke, the piercing screams fueling rising fear.
"How did he
“She’s beautiful,” Parvati whispered.
As Draco laid down on the scratchy sheets of the Hospital Wing, he had a revelation:
“Isn’t it bad to change the future?” Ron asked.
“No.” Draco wanted to keep it in the past. To push it in the back of his mind and forget all about it.
“Son, you alright there?” Ted asked.
“No, because I know you’re a capable wizard, Harry.”
books with the perspective that they could eat me,” Terry muttered as his book purred open.
"He didn't win the trial." She said as she handed over the letter. He saw that Hagrid included his name when thanking Hermione for helping with the case.
“I’ll take it. You’re a lifesaver.”
"Merlin, don't scare me! I could've hexed you!" Draco made his voice sound shocked and horrified at the thought of hexing Potter, but he really wanted to so badly.
“What?”
“You can’t look inside this.”
"No, I don't know why my son would want a diary. He's never showed anything interest in things like that." Narcissa said. "Lucius?"
"Sorry, but after last year, I'm just a little more concerned." The boys grew quiet, shooting obvious looks at Draco. The blond’s jaw tensed and pretended he didn't hear continuing to look outside.
“What happened is that she doesn’t believe me!" Harry exploded. "The Ministry doesn’t believe me! No one believes me! My own
"Just tired. It’s fine. I’ll help. Until then, Harry.” Draco’s voice took a sharp edge.
"Draco, this is Hagrid, the gamekeeper at Hogwarts," Potter stated proudly.
“I never really saw the Quidditch World Cup like this,” Draco said. Often he and Lucius would go but it was an indirect social party for the Ministry. He’s never been on the camping groups before. “It’s… amazing.”
“Did you get a prophecy?” Anthony asked seriously.
Many changes of events that happened before, but now the consequences of his actions were now
Harry looked down at the ground, watching his steps. “Draco, I’m sorry that I didn't believe you. And yelled at you. I wasn’t thinking—and you were only trying to help me. I’m sorry.”
A loud
“Mister Malfoy?” Draco's shoulders jumped and his head shot out to see Professor Lupin hovering above him. The teacher's eyes were drooped and tired but alert with concern.
“Whatever may be bothering you, you don’t have to think that. We’re friends, believe it or not. We both keep idiots like Ron and Harry out of trouble and I think we could become good friends as well.” Draco stared at the closed stall, unaware of the look of awe on his face.
The dark-haired boy shook his head. “Right, right. Sorry.” Harry hurried up after the blond.
There was the brief flare of burning pain and sound of his robes ripping. Draco was pushed down and wildly tried to kick at the ground to be out of Buckbeak’s range as he lifted himself up, preparing another attack. Hagrid managed to put the rope around Buckbeak’s collar, yanking him back. Pair of legs surrounded him as he tried to choke back his whimpering. It stung, it burned. Flares of pain heated his arm. It was really painful, he wasn’t going to lie.
Both boys were shocked when the compartment door opened to show Harry.
"I swear to Merlin, if you Gryffindors make a habit of yanking me out and about, I will hex you." He glared at the three of them through blonde hair that shifted over his eyes when he was pulled.
There was an acute awareness that Harry was staring at him and Draco didn't know what else to do but to stare right back. Both boys were pink-cheeked as Harry’s bright green eyes seemed to try to convey something but it was lost to Draco.
Draco turned and saw Fletcher Nil graciously moving aside for Krum to sit beside him. Nil seemed to feel Draco’s eyes on him as he turned instantly to him and gave a satisfied leer.
"Right! I'll--see you--soon." Harry said, carefully placing Draco's books in his arms.
Harry shook his head. "I don't know. I think he's trying to hide the fact that he could be after me. He told me not to seek him out either."
Draco frowned.
The crunching sound of metal of being dragged over a surface and distant screaming interrupted Dumbledore. Students rose up from the seats to see if they could see out the windows, Gryffindors getting the advantage since the sound came over on their side of the castle. Loud murmurings spread throughout the Great Hall. Draco looked at the professors to see Snape already leaving, his black robes billowing out of the hall. The first years that were sitting at their new houses nervously, wondering of this was part of the feast.
Draco spared a glance for the impassive crowd.
“He's fine. I can still look after the rat fine, Ron,” Draco reassured. Anthony still disliked the rodent and never let him near his bed but Terry liked to pet it as he talked about his theories on why Snape was suddenly nicer to them in class. Micheal liked to watch Scabbers when he was most active: standing on two legs to reach up to a crumb of food that Michael would hold over his head.
"Perhaps, this discussion can be continued in my office." Dumbledore held out an arm for Fudge to go out first.
“What do you
"What's this about, professor?" Ron asked when he found himself behind a quiet Draco.
“What’s wrong with you now?” Draco despaired, setting down his suitcase to use both of his hands.
“He’s fine. A good teacher. Bit weird...”
from entering the tournament himself? Maybe he could sabotage the older boy? Should he even do that? Would that make the universe do something even more detrimental than Cedric's death?
“It’s still a head.”
“She asked me to take her.”
“Oh, right,” Ron said before his eyes widened in realisation. “
“I don’t know…”
Harry’s throat bobbed before he held out his hand.
"I'll go with-"
they made a GIF of
“The safety of our lives isn’t overrated to me.” Terry turned to the last blond boy, hoping for support. “Draco, back me up here. You know how dangerous this sort of thing is. Talk some sense into them.”
"And since you were out of bed, I think a detention will make you understand to never do that again?" They were passing the Astronomy Tower.
“Give me the rat.” Sirius held out a hand to Draco.
Michael changed tactics. “And you Anthony?”
“Barty Crouch Jr,” Dumbledore said.
"I'm good! I need some rest! Bye!“ and Draco left to give Harry his "rest."
“Same to you, but at least I got to know a lot about you,” Harry said.
.” Harry breathed, seeming to be in a daze.
“I know you said you’d want to put that night behind us and that you didn’t need me to respond. But that’s not true. You deserve one and I finally have it.”
Sirius Black.
“Something’s wrong with it!” Anthony shouted.
“But I am! Just look how I’ve treated you and the others. And my father--”
.” The light went out.
The anxious tone of his mother’s voice made him pause. He crept closer, confused why his mother sounded like that. He ran a silent hand over the wallpaper as he neared the cracked doors.
He was barely thought the trapdoor when Trelaweny gasped loudly.
” Harry shrieked as he turned scarlet.
cared about me!” It was by Lucius’ instance that he could kill Dumbledore. To get in the good graces of the Dark Lord, he insisted that he could make his son a murderer and didn’t have a problem with it.
let himself romantically think of Harry? What would it be like to date Harry? What would it be like to be Harry Potter’s boy--
jab about Granger being a Mudblood. He saw green light and Weasley double over next to him gagging up slugs, but he could barely acknowledge it.
“Why not? From what I heard, Harry wasn’t discreet about it.”
"No, Mother, I'm fine," Draco smiled and Harry felt too much air rush into his lungs and he coughed. That brilliant smile was directed at him now. "Harry..." Snape's eyes seem to stare through Harry and the warm feeling in his chest grew cold.
“Draco!” Harry cried out, reaching for a hand towards him as he was carried away by a panicked group of parents.
Harry was occupied with grumbling to himself, pulling at his shirt sticking to his stomach. He crouched down to pick up his emptied bucket by the handle.
“I-I was… I was heading back to my Common Room, sir.” He decided to use the go-to excuse for all Ravenclaws. “I lost track of time at the library.”
Narcissa pressed her lips inward. “Can you just do that for me? It’s important.”
Draco really did like that note. It was the nicest thing that anyone gave him, cheesy poem and all. It made Draco feel special but in a better way. Not as a vivid time jumper, but special enough to be a person's daydream. Daydreams for the two them to
for a Chinese translation and
Looking back outside to the green school grounds, he looked over and saw streaks of red around the Quidditch field.
“You are a good person, love. I always knew you were." Narcissa cracked a smile. "I was almost worried that you wouldn’t show it.”
“Wotcha,” She gave a two-fingered slaute.
“Then you should probably tell him.” Anthony gave him a sideways smile. “Before he realizes how much of an ugly crier you are.”
” It was weird for Draco to hear Dumbledore’s voice be raised. “I do not think Draco attacked that student.”
Draco still didn’t know what Sirius Black wanted with him. He wasn’t Harry Potter and he didn’t have anything that was Black’s.
"It's fine, Harry. I completely agree with them." He felt his eye twitch at the sound of Potter's name coming from his mouth but did his best to ignore it. Forcing a smile, he watched as Potter sat across from him.
“What? He’s going to be
Draco just finished wrapping up the story about Voldemort having meetings in his house when a sliver of sunlight appeared on his hand. Draco stretched his neck to squint at the dark blue curtains. Pulling them back, he hissed at the sudden brightness that took over his eyes.
“I got this!” Tonks growled before Draco could say anything. “Get out of here! Get to the Tournament!”
… why did things need to happen? They all seem so pointless, but still they were finding ways to sneak back in. What was their purpose?
“Clearly, you failed!” Draco shouted. “I’m, I’m, I don’t know what to do.” He felt uncomfortable in his own skin. His hands were too clammy and his heart still hammering in a panic. “What am I supposed to do knowing that Harry feels like that?”
even by
“Fine, fine. Can you get Weasley for me when you go inside?” Draco gestured up the staircase with his chin.
“Did she do anything else?”
“Er, what night?”
“I’m starting to hate that same answer, Draco.”
li—“ A twinkle caught Draco's eye.
“What rubbish!” Anthony scoffed, letting the day’s issue of the
"I'll go in first. Let you two catch up!" Tonks patted Draco's arm before walking inside.
“Professor.”
"Harry! Draco! Over here!" They both turned to see Granger running up to them.
Look, I’m almost finished with it.”
"Good, I think Dad's about to start dinner," Tonks pushed herself out of her seat. "And I think I've wounded Sirius' pride enough. We'll see you tomorrow!"
The two boys reached a corridor where the pathway to Ravenclaw and Gryffindor split away.
and everyone just doesn’t believe me. They're--Pretending that nothing's coming. All the newspapers did over the summer was keep saying the same thing over and over and not even a word about Voldemort. And it’s getting to me a little bit."
Draco heard a wet sniffle.
“Jealous?” Draco smirked, buttoning his cuff.
—didn’t spark anything for him while one particular Beauxbatons boy that only winked at him caused his face to explode in colour and his body became jittery…
“What exactly is happening?” Michael asked, peeved. “Why’d you two pull me away from my date? What's going on?”
“Draco?” Harry was pulling inked parchment and spell books into a messy pile on the floor.
Potter was staring at the spot Draco was. Terry could hear Potter’s breathing become ragged. Potter turned and rested his hands on the stone, pitching his head down.
“I thought you didn’t dance?”
“Draco, is something bothering you?” Snape’s eyes burned the top of his head. "Don’t think I haven't noticed how you are almost silent in class. Not to mention that your skin has taken to a new shade of paleness. I’m still your godfather, even at Hogwarts."
They gave each other a hesitant nod.
"Yeah. Yeah, they did." Dead leaves crackled under their feet. Draco didn’t know what to say. “Do you really want to talk about our families?” Harry asked honestly.
“Why? Because it’s Hermione?”
“What’re you talking about, Professor?” Draco asked, squinting his eyes in false innocence.
Draco growled in his head but lit up his wand all the same.
"Yes, that is what I mean, Harry Potter. Draco Malfoy opened the Chamber, he wrote the messages on the wall, he set the Serpent of Slytherin on everybody. It was all him."
“A friend?!” Ron shrilled, the same second years shooting him another look. “What— No-- Mate, you can’t
A group Hufflepuffs surrounding a brown Hippogriff took quick steps back as the creature staring hacking and retching. The creature coughed up a spit-covered weasel skull at their feet.
“Why are you all obsessed with other people’s love lives?” Draco asked. His three friends were worse than middle-aged witches with trashy romance novels.
This is going to be a long year.
would want to get asked by?”
Because Draco ran away the last time.
“I’m just wondering!"
Terry gawked. “You can’t be serious.”
"I know."
It was a good morning. The sky was clear with the sun finally showing, his ever-lasting headache was gone for another full week. A dreamless night, a promise of a fine day...
“What happened between ye and Harry?” Hagrid asked. “You also fightin’?”
“What are you doing?”
“We’ll explain more later. That is, if you’re in?” Granger said. Draco looked down at the potion list.
it. A sense of normalcy back before everything happened. When all he really was a self-entitled brat that picked on Potter for the fun of it. At least he didn’t know anything back then.
Draco felt himself be dosed again in cold reality.
Draco was too far away at that point to hear Uncle Ted’s defence.
“But I don’t think anything’s broken. Your mother also knows you're here. Do you need anything else?”
"Fine." The anger drained and dissipated to tired disappointment. "This is suitable. I expect you to always be the top student and make trusts with Harry Potter." Draco almost fell out of his chair.
“Most likely.” Draco looked around him, trying to find a vendor that was passing out snacks.
"Okay. Okay, I won't." Skinny arms went around him. Instead of pushing away, like he would in a regular situation, he leaned into Harry's touch. Draco moved up so his face was no longer in Harry’s chest, but his neck. The scent of sunlight came off of Harry and it made him curl even closer to Harry. How was that even possible?
Despite the ache of colliding with the ground and being compressed with body weight, a laugh bubbled out of Draco. Merlin, his friends were so
"Huh?" The haze appearing in his eyes was blinked away.
“I… I wasn’t acting like myself. I couldn’t
Draco, who was trying to choke back the overflowing sense of guilt as the sheer stupidity of his past actions, was put on the spot.
Draco’s head turned to the source of the voice. When did she get here? Draco swore that Gryffindors had Care for Magical Creatures during Arithmancy. And Hermione the entire train ride on the Hogwarts Express said that she couldn’t wait to see how Care of Magical Creatures will be like.
