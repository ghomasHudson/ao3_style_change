“It didn’t seem right, hocking it for something I’ll only need to replace again in a couple of months.” Ginny leans in to press a quick kiss to Harry’s cheek, before sitting back with a grin. “You can get me new gloves for Christmas.”
“We think there’s a loophole.” Harry changes the topic, pleased to be bringing good news at last. He hands Draco the notes he and Hermione put together and watches as he reads them carefully. “The Aurors shouldn’t be policing Muggle parks, the cruising spots, the Muggle gay bars. It’s not their jurisdiction, unless there’s magic involved. That’s for the Muggle police to deal with and if you get in any trouble with them, I can’t help you.”
Next to the gates is a Wiggentree, and Harry looks around to check there’s nobody coming or going. Within seconds, Draco finds his back against the bark as Harry kisses him soundly. He smells like Quidditch leathers, the light muskiness of sweat and the fresh winter air. With a groan of pleasure—watching Harry play Quidditch is better than any Evaporate—Draco pushes his hands into Harry’s hair and deepens the kiss.
“What part of ‘I hate wine’ don’t you understand?” Harry takes a sip anyway, when Draco hands him a generous glass. It’s not bad, as wine goes.
“Dunno.” Ron shrugs. “It’s not my normal, that’s for sure. I don’t tend to think about it much. Hermione gave me a right rollicking when I called Malfoy a poof. I tried to tell her it’s not because he’s gay, it’s because he’s a pillock. It’s just a word, isn’t it? She wasn’t having any of it.”
“You always say the nicest things.” Draco laughs and it’s so bright and unexpected, it makes Harry laugh too. When the laughter fades away, Draco runs his tongue over his lips. “That fucking
Harry puts his head in his hands and sucks in a sharp breath. The euphoria of leaving Wiltshire earlier that morning is like a distant memory. He considers going to see Draco, but he mentioned having a busy day at Gringotts—
“What if somebody saw?” Harry’s voice shakes and he takes another long drink of the booze. It burns as it slides down his throat.
“I—” Draco stops. He can’t seem to form proper words with Harry this close, his thoughts swimming. He leans back against the bookcase and meets Harry’s steady gaze. “Perhaps we should talk.”
“I’m not joking.” Harry tries to sound firm and convincing, but he’s not sure how to convince someone you’re gay. He didn’t know what to expect, but he thought Draco would believe him at least. The way he’s acting has Harry doubting himself. “Why won’t you believe me?”
“Why?” Harry puts the Passion Parchment down and gets to his feet with a frown. “Can’t you repair it?”
“I have no idea.” Draco’s voice is faint. He stands and turns his back to Harry, lighting a candle in the corner of the room, an unfamiliar tension in his shoulders. “You can’t joke about something like this. You’re no more impervious than I am. Your name might afford you some leniency, but not enough. Not when it comes to being gay.”
The book flips open and the parchment pages fan out until they open on a half-empty page. With another excited flutter the quill springs into action, writing furiously in the open book.
Laughing, Harry resumes his position after making sure he has proper access to Draco’s arse. Breathlessly he slides a slick finger inside him, meeting only a little resistance. The hot clench of Draco around him sends pleasure pulsing through his veins. He fucks Draco slowly before adding another finger, taking in the way his lips part and the arch and buck of his body.
Harry loves visiting Ginny, but he can’t picture himself living in Wales. His social life revolves around London and you can’t fly a broom after a couple of beers. Not to mention security breaches on the Floo Network several years ago led to a complete overhaul of the system. Shortly after the war, security concerns forced Harry to disconnect Grimmauld Place from the Floo Network, allowing Fire-Calls but no full body transportation. The Ministry Floos can only be used for official business, and it’s made his life with Ginny harder than ever, thanks to the time and administration required to arrange a Portkey and the physical strain of too much long-distance Apparition. Spontaneous visits dwindled and eventually stopped altogether. It’s just another thing between them they’re both putting off discussing, hoping things will just resolve themselves when the time comes.
Are you always this annoying? If you’re as bored as I am, I’d warrant you don’t have anything better to do either. Scared, Griffin?
“I don’t want to hear it, son.” Arthur’s face pales as he looks at George. “Great Merlin, is that why you’re here too? Have the two of you been—?”
“Hand.” Harry raises an eyebrow as if he didn’t know exactly what he was implying, a smug look on his face. “You wear a signet ring with the Malfoy crest on. It’s not very subtle. Your Quick-Match Quill’s really loud too, obviously you didn’t read the instructions about turning the vibrations off. I could hear you getting notifications when I used to send you messages at the gym. That confirmed it.”
“Of course I don’t,” Draco snaps. Guilt worms through him at the thought of the months of messages exchanged between Griffin and
The futility of having his biggest secret shared against his will leaves hot tears of anger pricking behind Harry’s eyes. He has half a mind to pre-empt any conversation between Ron and Robards, but he’s too exhausted and shell-shocked to know what to say. He doesn’t even know what time it is in America.
Draco pulls a face, hoping to fuck it isn’t Weasley. He realises he still hasn’t got to the bottom of why Harry’s evening has been so awful and wonders if it’s anything to do with his wand. The reminder that they’re going to spend the weekend working together is both welcome and not. Draco is already buzzing with anticipation, eager to see Harry again in the flesh. However, the sinking realisation that the sooner he breaks all contact with Griffin or tells Harry the truth, the better. His Quick-Match Quill vibrates and bounds towards the open notebook.
“It doesn’t matter.” Harry is surprised to find he really doesn’t mind. He’s spent all day dwelling on his plans with Draco for next Thursday, and his rash decision to go to Knockturn. He’s hardly had time to think about the weekend plans he made with Ginny. Wales seems like ages ago. “The Brecon Beacons sounds fun.”
Self-preservation aside, Harry’s been privy to murmurings about Draco over the years. He knows all about the unexpected friendship Draco struck up with Astoria Greengrass after the war. She publicly denounced her family’s views, something that created a real stink due to the Greengrass name and its long associations with pure-blood supremacy. By all accounts Draco and Astoria were thick as thieves and their close friendship was taken by many as a sign of Draco’s changing loyalties. Harry can’t imagine the grief Draco suffered after Astoria’s untimely death two years ago. Despite his wealth, his pompous attitude and his clear distrust in the Ministry, if the rumours are to be believed, Draco Malfoy has become a good man.
“You should.” Millie claps Harry on the shoulder. “I’m not going to tell you it’s all going to be fine, or any of that rot. But perhaps one day you and Malfoy will be sitting outside—on a yacht or something, knowing Malfoy—a pair of old queens that have seen more of the world than most. You’ll look back on this and say
Draco stops checking in at every second opportunity and licks, sucks and pushes into Harry until his limbs are shaky. When he pulls back, Harry groans at the loss.
“No more Ogden’s in the day.” Hermione points her wand at the curtains, drawing them to a close. “Be careful with that.”
Considering the club holds all the appeal of a pile of Hippogriff dung, it is nevertheless exceedingly popular. The Friday night air buzzes with the promise of the imminent weekend and whoops and hollers echo and bounce through the labyrinth of nearby alleyways. The long queue of excited faces would lead any casual passer-by to think Merlin’s Kitchen is the hottest ticket in town when the only thing it has going for it is a monopoly on the market. Merlin’s Kitchen could be infested with Doxies and people would still fall all over themselves to get inside, because it’s the only magical place in London that serves booze after eleven.
“Ginny.” Harry cuts her off with a shake of his head. He doesn’t want Draco babysit Harry. “I’m sure Malfoy’s got his own plans and the last thing I want to do is traipse around an art gallery in Central London. Why are you so determined to stop me from sorting out the garden?”
“Because I like chatting to you.” Harry gives Draco a strange look. “You did know it was me, didn’t you?”
“Dear Merlin.” Kingsley squeezes Harry’s arm tightly. His voice lowers to almost a whisper. “I would never, ever think any less of you. I have nothing but the utmost respect for you as a man, a friend and a trusted colleague.”
“None of my business, is it?” Harry thinks of Ron’s comment at Shell Cottage, and tries to sound unphased, keeping his tone placid. “It’s not exactly normal behaviour, but not something a bloke should go to prison for.”
“You’re wrong,” Draco bites out. “Nothing’s ever going to be the same for me again. Everything’s changed, Potter.
“Shocking.” Harry resists the urge to roll his eyes. “We could have used you on the pub quiz at the Leaky the other night. There were loads of stupid questions about potions and some weird old coins.”
The fact Draco literally is talking about Harry makes him hot all over. For a fleeting moment he allows himself to imagine that Harry knows too, and this is just part of an elaborate game. The thought fades as quickly as it arises. Draco stopped believing in miracles a long time ago.
“Not a lot,” Harry agrees. He pulls up a chair at Draco’s table and signals for a drink. “Want another one?”
Talking to Ginny lately is like clutching a fistful of sand and watching the grains slowly slip through his fingers. The tighter he holds on, the more he loses.
“You’re so infuriating.” Draco slides his hands up Harry’s thighs. He pushes up his jumper and finds the phoenix tattoo, brushing his lips against it. He pulls back and watches as the wings flutter. The phoenix begins to move like a flame across Harry’s belly and over his shoulder, disappearing off out of sight. “You and your phoenixes.”
. He used to crave it desperately, but somewhere along the way things shifted around and now the idea makes him want to go flying over crashing waves, diving headfirst into the oncoming rain, until the wind pulls all the breath from his aching lungs. He’s been with Ginny since the war and he can’t imagine a life without her, but over the years their lives have become increasingly separate: Ginny living in Wales, focusing on her career with the Harpies with determined enthusiasm, Harry throwing himself into his work at the Ministry. Spending every weekend together soon dwindled into seeing one another once a month or less, filling the gaps with rushed Fire-Calls.
, Harry wants to scream. He meets Kingsley’s eyes and he knows in that moment Kingsley sees everything. It’s as though he’s using Legilimency and Harry’s mind is an open book. Harry’s shutters fall, and he’s quite sure the expression on his face gives him away as Kingsley’s shoulders slump and his mouth sets in a grim line.
“I hate you for not understanding.” Draco’s voice is quiet, the rustle of his clothing and the warmth of his body indicating he’s taken the seat next to Harry. “I don’t expect to be forgiven for leaving, but this is different.”
There’s something about Draco that makes Harry unsettled. He doesn’t know what to say, or how to behave. It was easier in Azkaban, when they had a purpose of sorts. It’s harder here, on Draco’s turf. Harry’s never been concerned about saying the wrong thing—least of all to Malfoy—but he finds himself oddly tongue-tied.
It occurs to him as the sounds of Merlin’s Kitchen filter into the room why Harry asked if Draco was bothered by the noise. There’s something decadent about the way laughter and the buzz of conversation filters into the otherwise quiet room. The thump of the music vibrates through the floorboards and the walls but it’s not the loud, oppressive din of the club itself.
“I know.” Draco presses close to Harry, his naked body warm and firm against Harry’s. He scrapes his teeth over Harry’s ear. “I’m not going to hurt you. Not in a bad way. Just the way you want.”
“He’s been in meetings with the goblins.” Harry doesn’t want Draco to see him like this, pathetic and untethered. “Draco’s had enough on his plate. Me losing my job doesn’t compare. I’ve still got savings, I’m not going to starve.”
Draco turns his hand so it’s palm-up, unbuttoning his shirt cuff and rolling up the sleeve to reveal the now faded Dark Mark. Harry puts his palm over Draco’s and their fingers curl tightly around one another.
, Potter.” Draco doesn’t sound at all shocked by the bold assumption, but Harry doesn’t miss the note of pleasure in his tone. He adjusts the collar of his shirt and points at the bar. “I suggest shots. If you’re attempting to get me to let loose, a pint and a packet of salt and vinegar crisps isn’t going to cut the mustard.”
“I’m here on official business,” Harry reminds Draco. The words seem snooty and out-of-character, the tongue-tied sensation he sometimes gets around Draco returning with force. Harry glances at the clock, relieved to see the minute hand creeping towards the hour. “Time’s up.”
“As if I’d want to know anything about your sex life.” Harry snorts, the tension crackling between them dissipating in a moment of light relief. “I’d rather stick my head up a Hippogriff’s arse.”
Mondays are rubbish. It’s mornings like this I wish I had something warmer than a Quick-Match Quill to curl up with. The feathers don’t half make me itch.
“I’ll believe it when I see it.” Harry grins, the tension in the air fading away. He moves over Draco, looking into his eyes. “Hi.”
It takes Harry a minute to realise that the silence and following clamour has been caused by his appearance. He glances at Draco who winces.
A lull in the queue at the bar allows Draco to get another drink and he finds a seat outside. The cool breeze of the evening is a great deal more pleasant than the sweaty dancefloor and the scent of sweet, sticky drinks covering the floor inside. The added benefit to being outside is the ability to observe Harry, now back with his friends instead of cosying up to Draco in shadowy corners of the club.
because he’s one of us? Come and look at him, Mikey. Harry Potter here in the flesh, as I live and breathe. A
Harry studies Draco thoughtfully. Eventually he replies, keeping his tone warm. “Yeah, obviously. You really gross me out, Malfoy.”
The first cool press of Draco’s slick finger against his hole makes Harry grip onto the sheets again. He wants Draco to push inside him so badly he’s one step away from begging. He presses up a little towards Draco in silent encouragement, hoping to Merlin it’s as good as he’d always imagined. He’s so relaxed after Draco worked him over with his tongue, his cock blindingly hard and his whole body warm with arousal.
“We’re a long way from rainbows.” Draco pulls a face. “The windows have always been covered, to protect the people inside as much as anything. The owners wouldn't want to find themselves charged with conspiracy to corrupt public morals. They tend to be suspicious of strangers on the door and won't let just anybody in. Before the new legislation passed we had to be even more careful. People had their own language of sorts, phrases and words that those in the know would recognise, to keep out anyone wanting to cause trouble.”
“Nope.” Harry shakes his head. He takes a sip of the alcohol and tries not to cough at the burn of it in his throat. “Delicious.”
“This was in a locked drawer.” Harry’s voice is thick and foggy, his head spinning. “In a locked office. What the
“Yeah?” Harry sounds delighted, the smug arse. His tone shifts from gleeful to concerned in a heartbeat. “We don’t have to—I don’t expect you to—I’m flexible.”
“Hello.” Ginny gives Harry a big hug, clinging to him tightly. She pulls back, her cheeks flushed and her eyes shining. “Now listen here. You’re not to be cross with me about filling Millie in on the details. I want to help, and she’s got some experience in these matters—”
doesn’t get herself arrested for giving people blowjobs on Clapham Common. She’s so bloody beautiful she takes his breath away, a warm, happy energy that Harry wants to cling onto forever. “At the risk of giving you another heart attack…”
“Good.” Hermione stands, adjusting her robes. “I’ll do what I can, but I can’t be expected to manage every aspect of social reform on my own.”
Draco swipes his hand over his eyes, before meeting Harry’s gaze. “You need to understand that I’m a very different person to the boy you knew, the one who ran away at the first sign of trouble. I don’t just change allegiances and find an easier alternative when things become difficult. It’s not who I am. Not anymore.”
Harry raises his mug in response and forces a smile. The thought of ever being friendly enough with Draco to bring him into his cosy—and far too astute—group of friends leaves him more than a little apprehensive. His thoughts flash back to Draco smiling as if he knew something Harry didn’t.
“It’s fine.” Harry waves him in, despite knowing the smarter choice would be to tell Draco to Apparate home. “You used to say you’d rather eat flobberworm shit than drink lager.”
, Draco thought when the images of people in the wizarding world flickered before his mind in the dark, quieter moments.
“Sometimes, I think. For some more than others, particularly those whose parents didn’t accept them at first. At least the laws that put Malfoy in Azkaban don’t apply to witches, because the old wizards who wrote them never bothered to consider the possibility that two witches could be happy together without a man involved.” Ginny rolls her eyes and chews thoughtfully on her scone. “I can’t stand Malfoy, you know I think he’s an entitled prat that needs to go easy on the hair waxing spells. Still, he didn’t deserve that. He should have gone to Azkaban for letting Death Eaters into Hogwarts, not for getting tossed off or whatever he was doing in that park.
Eventually he finds Ginny chatting animatedly to one of her teammates. “Millie said there’s this bar in Cardiff, three floors high with drag and—”
“Blimey. I’d better get cracking on that party.” Harry swallows. Ron and Hermione are just two more things slipping through his fingers.
Harry pushes into Draco with one quick motion, holding his body firm as he undulates his hips without pulling out. Draco’s cry leaves him with a punch, and he huffs out a sharp breath at the initial fullness. His forehead beads with sweat and he keeps still for a moment to adjust to the unfamiliar stretch and burn of being taken.
“No, but perhaps I want to keep you entertained.” Draco slips his fingers under Harry’s t-shirt, his voice sinfully low. “If I had to choose between spending my Saturday fucking you or not fucking you, I know which one I would prefer. Don’t for one minute assume I’m inviting you over out charity.”
, Minister Robards.” Kingsley stands, his voice laced with fury. The magic in the room crackles and twists and he is as imposing and strong as he’s ever been. “If you put Harry in Azkaban, I will bring together every person I know, and we’ll break him out ourselves. Harry Potter will not spend one night in jail. Not one minute. Not one
. His confidence now fully returned, Draco breaches Harry’s body with a nudge of his finger, the slick of the lubricant making the passage easy despite the tight clench of Harry’s body. Biting back a groan, Draco presses his lips to the small of Harry’s back. With a grunt of pleasure, Draco adds a second finger and begins to fuck Harry with them.
“You’ve certainly done that.” Ginny gives her teammate a quick smile then drags Harry outside, leading him to a couple of empty seats in the stand overlooking the training pitch. Her face pales. “What’s happened to Ron?”
these days. Besides, the witch is smoking a cigarette that smells suspiciously like dried Shrivelfig. Draco doesn’t fancy leaving the club as pissed as a Cornish Pixie only to find cigarette burns all over his robes. It wouldn’t be the first time someone’s taken issue with the brevity of his time in Azkaban.
“Yeah.” Harry swallows around the lump in his throat. He slips his hand from Ginny’s and wraps her in his arms, nuzzling her head and breathing in the warm, comforting scent of her. “I’m scared for us too.”
is exactly what he needs. Harry grins at the thought that his obvious interest in sex might be therapeutic. It’s extremely charitable of him, really. He stretches out on the bed as Draco drinks in the sight of him. Despite the uncertainty of what happens next, Harry’s not in the slightest bit worried. He wants it. He wants all of it. He strokes his cock quickly and meets Draco’s gaze.
Looking around the outside space, Draco is curious about more than Harry’s unexpected proposition. He can’t imagine anyone living above this dark, noisy back alley with people puking at three in the morning and the crash of empty bottles being dumped into the bins before the sun comes up. Merlin’s Kitchen is just a gobstone’s throw away from Knockturn, which still retains its eerie qualities, despite the creep of new shops and eateries into the once off-limits space.
—there are three fingers inside his body and Harry isn’t gentle about using them. It’s not quite as intense as the pleasure Draco imagines he could get from Harry’s beautiful cock, but it’s damn close.
“This one was obvious enough even for me, thanks.” Harry shifts behind Draco, the slap of his palm and bounce of the bed indicating he’s giving his cock a couple of quick strokes.
“How romantic.” Ginny rolls her eyes. “It’s the love story of every young girl’s dreams. A nice, handsome man proposing because it’s going to be good for his career.”
“Not a lot, Robards has been commanding most of his attention. He’s cross with them for firing you, of course. I suspect he’s worried about Ginny too. We both are.”
. If he thinks it’s going to solve any of his problems, he’s wrong. Draco tastes blissfully good, sweet like wine. He surges into Harry with all the fight, fire and passion that’s absent from the cool, bored demeanour he puts on most of the time.
“Fine.” Harry rubs his hands together, eyeing something green and toxic behind the bar. Trusty old Apple Sours. “I’ll see what I can do.”
“I have no idea.” Draco presses Harry against the counter, his breath warm on Harry’s lips. “I’m not sure I can ever imagine living in a time that’s ready for us.”
The rest of the working day is sufficiently busy that Draco doesn’t have much time to think about Harry until he’s closing the shop for the evening. Pulling a face, Draco removes the quill and notebook he shoved in a drawer earlier in the day. With a sigh of resignation, he taps his wand against the notebook. It opens eagerly, the quill springing into action.
“Make it sound like we’re—” Harry stops, unable to finish the sentence. “You know what you’re doing. I’m not interested in men and I’m certainly not interested in you.”
“I never had any idea.” Harry frowns. It never occurred to him that Dumbledore would have any kind of private life. “Perhaps he was living two lives. Split down the middle, like you said. The person he was and the person he was allowed to be.”
“I wasn’t reaching for the booze if that’s what you think,” Harry mumbles. “It wasn’t like that. It’s about Sirius, not about alcohol.”
“Finally.” Hermione collapses on the sofa in Harry’s office with a sigh of relief. “I thought we’d never get there.”
“Okay.” Harry settles over Draco and captures his lips in a sweet, boozy kiss before pulling back. “How?”
It might not be anything special to Draco, but for Harry the tight, firm clench of Draco’s body is an entirely new and unexpected sensation. The grasp of him around Harry’s cock, the way Draco manages to look pissy and horny all at the same time, the newness of doing this. He’s had good sex with Draco. He’s had
“You’re so brave telling them. I hate feeling like a coward.” Ginny twists her hands together miserably. “I’m not scared of many things. Why this?”
Draco shakes himself from his thoughts and watches Harry shift his weight from foot to foot in time with the music. If he’s trying to make the silence less awkward with his horrible dancing, he’s failing. It should nip any misplaced attraction in the bud but unfortunately even when he’s shuffling from side to side with all the rhythm of a Mountain Giant, Harry’s still fit enough to make Draco’s mouth water.
“Just stuff.” Harry reaches across the sofa when Draco sits next to him and twines their fingers together. “It drove me mad not being able to do this tonight. I never realised how much I took that for granted. How do you do it?”
“I’m trying something different.” Draco’s words come out rough and jagged. “I thought you might prefer it.”
“No.” Draco turns, his eyes darkening as his gaze sweeps over Harry. “Nice jacket. Perhaps there’s hope for you after all.”
“Err, hi.” Harry shakes her hand, the half-familiar features clicking into place. She does look different. Brighter, happier and more colourfully dressed in a patterned shirt, bowtie and smart trousers. “Nice to see you again.”
His footsteps don’t land so heavily anymore. The voice in his head turns to a whisper and then fades away.
“Now more than usual,” Draco replies. He sighs and stretches out on the sofa, the steady tug of desire returning. “If you
“Let him speak, Mum. I’ve spoken to Ginny, she’s fine. It was all her decision, you know what she’s like. All career, career, career. She’s happy, she loves Harry like a friend. We all do. They’ll be best of mates still.”
It turns out, perspective is everything. When you’re fucking the Seeker, everything is different. Draco whoops and cheers so loudly Zabini starts giving him dirty looks. Draco doesn’t know what Zabini’s problem is. At least he’s not wearing a Gryffindor scarf, Merlin forbid.
“Go on, then.” Draco finds his voice at last, the usual smoothness replaced by rough edges as his heart
“I told you, Blaise and Theodore will be around here somewhere.” Pansy waves her hand. “Besides, you’re looking very handsome tonight. I’m sure plenty of wizards would be delighted to keep you company.”
during a stakeout or wrangling with the British Museum over an ancient artefact that’s actually an illegal Time-Turner.”
“Is that why you left?” Draco has always been curious about Harry’s sudden move from the Ministry to Hogwarts when everything seemed to be going so well for him. Although the salacious gossip columns about a failed relationship with everyone from Kingsley Shacklebolt to Hermione Granger were entertaining, Draco didn’t believe them for a second. “I just assumed you and Weasley were Ministry men.”
Hermione laughs. “It would be good for you to go out and let your hair down. I can’t remember the last time you had a proper night out. Didn’t you always do that pub quiz at the Leaky with Lee and George?”
“Circe.” Draco bites back a groan and he pushes his hand under the elasticated waistband of Harry’s joggers. He moves his hand over Harry’s aching prick and then presses his lips to Harry’s ear. “Take these off,” he whispers.
“Oh.” Harry chokes back a laugh and catches Draco’s lips in a messy, exuberant kiss. “Good to know, Malfoy. Thanks.”
Draco gets his wand and casts a quick lubricating charm, sliding a slick finger in between the cheeks of Harry’s delectable backside. He doesn’t miss the way Harry arches his back like a Kneazle, or the soft huff that leaves his lips.
As Draco watches Harry Summoning their discarded clothes it occurs to him that Harry is still wearing his socks. The ugly, white sports socks are right there in his eyeline in all their offending glory, one pulled up to the calf and the other bunched around Harry’s ankle. There’s something so stupidly normal about them that it resets the balance of the world and Draco finds his sense of self returning with aplomb.
“Is that a euphemism?” Harry takes his wand from his holster and casts a line of snowflakes. They burst from the tip of the wand, then fall around them, leaving icy kisses against Draco’s face. “Working better than ever, thanks to you.”
“Isn’t it?” Ginny’s cheeks are ruddy, her eyes shining. She looks different to the last time he saw her, her hair cropped close at one side and cut shorter than before. “Even in the rain, it’s beautiful. I don’t understand how you can live somewhere you can’t fly properly.”
Harry throws back the sheets, breathing in the clean, soapy scent of Draco’s skin as he works his way down his body. His body is still warm and damp from the shower, small beads of water kissing Harry’s lips. He lingers over Draco’s hipbone, mouthing lower. He pointedly ignores the irritated tugging at his hair, muttering
“I don’t have any friends left in England.” Draco answers Harry’s question at last. “Apart from you.”
“You don’t want me moping around.” Harry scrubs his eyes. A hot, angry flush of tears threatens. It’s so stupid, so frustrating. He doesn’t want to cry over his stupid job in front of Draco. He just wants to be left alone until he’s had time to work things out. “I don’t want to do this. Not with you. I’m fine.”
“Hermione works on social reform all the time, and you reckon she’s a shoo-in for Minister.” Harry tries to keep his voice level. The last thing he needs is to give Kingsley any doubts. “She asked me to help, she can’t do everything on her own. I don’t believe in the law as it currently stands, should I pretend I do just to keep the peace?”
Harry follows Draco into the living room after shrugging off the jacket and sending it upstairs with a flick of his wand. Ginny turns the music up and insists Harry dance with her.
“I do after hours appointments for one-to-one consultations.” Draco taps his wand against the stack of forms. “It’s in the paperwork. You can book your slot via owl. I’m not cheap.”
With a whistle, he leaves the shop and Draco is left staring after him, wondering not for the first time, how Potter
The music gathers and crescendos around them and in Merlin's Kitchen the dancing continues into the infinite night.
“Hello,” Draco breathes. He touches Harry's jaw, his eyes glinting. “Are you keeping the beard for a while?”
Draco shrugs. “I started choosing pieces that I knew father would find obnoxious, then I grew to like the style.”
to announce the arrival of Draco’s first customer. Harry blusters into the shop with a sharp gust of icy air and all of Draco’s good cheer rapidly fades away.
“Thanks.” Harry makes his way into what he assumes is Draco’s study. In contrast to the rest of the house, it’s much more in keeping with the Manor Harry remembers of old. There’s a large mahogany desk at the end of the room and a large sofa next to a crackling fire. For such an opulent room it’s surprisingly cosy.
Draco stops. Harry doesn’t say a word, but the wounded expression eases a little. He crosses his arms and nods, as if Draco should continue. He looks divine; rumpled and well-kissed.
“Great.” Harry musters as much enthusiasm as he can. “There’s loads happening. Busy, busy. You know what it’s like.”
With one hard thrust, Draco enters Harry. The stretch and burn makes Harry cry out, but the pain is just the right side of pleasurable. Draco gives Harry a minute to adjust before taking him exactly as Harry wanted. It drives everything else away and lets Harry lose himself in pure sensation. There’s no room for thinking, no room for agonising. There’s just a rush of endorphins and a searing heat, a dull ache that gives way to blinding pleasure as Draco hits the right spot again and again.
So what if I am? You’d better hurry up and get to the other stuff before I lose my hard-on. What does he do next?
Draco nods slowly and sips his wine. The sight of it is torture—the wet press of his lips, the muscles of his throat working, the way his fingers hold the glass. Harry bites at the inside of his cheek.
“It’s what she deserved. I’d hoped we could have a party for friends outside of the Ministry, but there wasn’t time to organise anything. It happened in such a rush.”
Draco nudges Harry onto his back and moves down his body. They haven’t been doing this for very long, but it’s been long enough that Harry knows the things Draco can do with his mouth are wickedly good. With a low growl of pleasure, Harry drops his head back on the pillow as Draco takes him into his mouth. He clutches a hand in Draco’s hair and bucks up towards him with a hiss of pleasure.
“Probably not, but you were always going to, let’s be honest.” Harry tries not to let his anger get the better of him but it’s difficult. “Come on. We might as well get this over with.”
Draco can understand why Harry would want to go through the proper process, he supposes. The old Draco would have thought it all a big waste of time, but now he thinks he understands why taking something just because you can isn’t always the best way to approach life. Even if he would never admit it, he admires Harry for his instinctive desire to work for the titles he earns.
, puts his magical coffee machine to work on grinding fresh beans and reaches for his favourite writing quill with its elegant peacock feather. He ignores the other quill that shivers and flexes beside him, like it’s stretching in preparation for the new day.
“I’m sorry.” Ginny’s voice wavers, her body deathly still beside Harry. “I—I never wanted to hurt you.”
“I’m not very good at delicate,” Harry replies. His hands are clammy, and he puts his coffee down before he spills it all over himself. “I’m like a bull in a china shop most of the time.”
“I didn’t say that.” Draco waits for Harry to sit again before continuing. He clenches his jaw, staring straight ahead without looking at Harry. “Are you going to pretend I didn’t deserve everything I got?”
When they finish, Harry drops his forehead against the wall and gulps in air. He feels Draco nudging at the edges of his mind again and his filters slip down as a wave of exhaustion hits him. He can’t bring himself to speak but he knows Draco can see the things flicking through his mind.
“Doubt it.” Harry laughs, relief flooding through him. He’s become so on edge about Ministry politics and the half-truths he’s been telling Ginny about his tentative friendship with Draco, he’s almost forgotten what it’s like to be unfiltered. “I don’t think Robards likes it when his Aurors go out late on a school night.”
“Stand still for the body search spell.” A bored looking witch with pink hair waves her wand up and down the length of Draco’s body. A flicker of recognition crosses her features as she does so. Eyes narrowing, she checks him again for good measure.
“You like wanking you mean.” Draco hopes Harry knows he’s only teasing. He thinks he would miss Griffin’s adventures with all creatures great and small if they had to give up Quick-Match altogether. “How do I know you won’t go off looking for new wizards?”
Ron stares at Harry for one long minute and then pulls him into a tight hug. He doesn’t say another word, pulling back after clutching him tightly. He walks away, swiping the back of his hand across his face and Draco watches him, shaking his hand.
Ginny snorts with laughter and Harry’s cheeks heat. Draco avoids Harry’s eyes and he sends a light hex in Millie’s direction that makes her yelp. The room descends into laughter, the music pulses and twists around them and Harry settles back on the sofa as his head spins. The idea of building such a secretive life when he’s always lived so unapologetically sits uneasily with him, but he supposes he should get used to the new normal.
“I’ll try to get the word out.” Draco’s expression is pinched, and he pushes the papers back towards Harry. “I suppose at the very least this gives us a way to overturn my conviction.”
“Because you seem like the marrying type.” Draco turns his wine in his glass, watching it slide over the sides. The candles in the room cast shadows over his face, making him seem more angular than usual. “At least you got some of that pent-up aggression out of your system after spending some quality time with your girlfriend.”
“I said I don’t want to hear about your sex life.” Harry shoves the papers towards Draco, sitting back in his seat and hoping he looks less flustered than he is. “You’ve got about ten million rooms in the Manor, Malfoy. Was it too simple to just fuck someone in one of those? Not risqué enough, I bet.”
. He finally settled into a job that suited him well, at the wizarding library in London. On his breaks he read as much as he could and discovered his interest in wandlore. Once he had found his faltering feet in Britain again, Draco cut ties with the Manor and packed the last of his bags. He left Britain for Paris, where he studied wandlore for three years at the magical branch of the Sorbonne. After that, he spent a further three years in Munich under the tutelage of Mia Gregorovitch.
“I can’t believe you convinced me to come back here again,” Draco grouses. “I’m starting to think my father was right about Dumbledore. Does the man always talk in riddles?”
“From the start.” Harry turns to look at Draco at last. He leans back against the window ledge, his arms crossed which is a sure sign Draco shouldn’t come any closer yet. “You’ve got a very distinctive…” He trails off and coughs, indelicately.
“Music’s decent at least.” Harry changes the subject with the speed of a duelling partner flinging spells at an opponent. “Pity I can’t dance for shit.”
“I’m—” Harry breaks off, his words chased from his mouth by another press of Draco’s body against his own.
The weird thing is, Harry isn’t even jealous of the lives his friends have. He doesn’t look at Ron and Hermione’s happy family unit and think
the time. It seems right that Draco should arrive bang on the hour, even for a visit he didn’t bother to arrange. He’s always been punctual.
—the world spins, twists and turns. Harry pulls away when he’s close, so close, forcing himself to turn and drop on his back. He hopes Draco understands what he wants.
The air gets heady with the scent of musk and arousal. Every thrust Harry makes sends sparks zinging like magic across Draco’s already sensitised body.
“He pretended to be very inconvenienced by it all but he wasn’t a bit convincing.” Ginny winks at Harry. “It evens out the numbers. Besides, he knows a bit more about the lay of the land in London and boys’ stuff. He could be helpful.”
“Yeah, perhaps.” Harry clears his throat. “We’ll have to have a party,” he decides, quickly deflecting from the topic of Ginny. “Get all the old crowd together.”
“It is if you want me inside you,” Harry murmurs. He really does have the filthiest mouth. He captures Draco’s lips in a warm, searching kiss and he tastes of salt and toothpaste, which he must have pilfered from Draco’s bathroom. “Are you going to get rid of your Quick-Match stuff?”
, as Molly puts it. It’s nice to meet someone who thinks Harry’s unenthusiastic proposal plans are rubbish.
what you believe.” Harry is so furious with Draco, he wants to throw something. His hand twitches towards his wand, anger overwhelming him. “It’s the truth. You might think it’s stupid, pathetic probably, have a good old laugh if you like, but don’t make the mistake of thinking you know me better than I know myself. You reckon you’re so perceptive, just because you’ve been around the block a bit but you don’t know anything, you—”
. He’s not a bigot. He just hates the way the conversation makes the itch under his skin intensify, hates the hot discomfort that rolls within him when he thinks about two men together. Hermione would get it if she were a wizard too, he’s sure of it. Harry makes sure his voice is firm, authoritative, steady. “I’ve got nothing against two wizards—or witches—being together. Live and let live.”
“I’m glad.” Harry looks at his hands, clearly debating what to say. “Your mum saved my life, you know.”
“I don’t know how.” Harry sags back against the sofa, unable to look at Draco. The courage of Harry’s newfound conviction ebbs away from him and he tries to put his tattered thoughts back together. “Maybe you’re right. I’ve got this all wrong, it was a full moon or something.”
“Nope.” Harry doesn’t elaborate, his tone suggesting that’s a conversation for another time. “It’s…a long story.”
“At first. Until it became unbearably difficult.” Draco glances at Harry. “I need you to understand we learned very lessons as children. I felt
Draco nods his confirmation, suspecting Harry doesn’t really want the full details. He enjoys helping witches and wizards organise their investments. There’s something soothing and mechanical about accounts and budgeting. His latest research has sparked something he buried after settling into the humdrum of his daily work, however. Delving back into the world of Arithmancy with Hermione has helped Draco remember how much he loves the
“It’s okay,” Harry replies. “I’m not sure I got everything right either.” He brushes his thumb against Draco's cheek. “But I forgive you, if you need to hear it.”
It doesn’t escape Harry’s attention that when he kisses sensitive areas on Draco’s neck, the tickle and slide of his beard against Draco’s skin makes him particularly responsive. Harry’s head swims with the masculine scent of Draco and the way he gets so restless and eager in his arms. With a groan, Draco tugs Harry into another desperate, biting kiss. They break apart and watch one another, Draco’s eyes glassy and dark. With deliberate precision, Harry slides Draco’s belt open, holding his gaze.
“Stop.” Draco holds up a hand, trying to catch his breath. He looks up to see the hurt and confusion etched over Harry’s face and his heart twists at the sight of it. “We can’t, not until I tell you—”
“I should be getting off—err—home. I should be getting home.” Harry speaks quickly, heat rising in his cheeks.
“Where’s the fun in that?” Harry flips open the top of the lube. He gets his fingers slick as Draco watches, a moan stuttering from his lips as he drops his hand to his cock and gives it a quick stroke. “No touching,” Harry says. “I’m coming.”
When they finally break apart, Draco looks faintly embarrassed. He ducks his head and picks up his belt from where Harry discarded it, a flush rising in his cheeks. He threads it back through the loops and buckles it with more avid attention than it warrants, his throat bobbing. Harry tugs up his joggers as Draco looks around with a frown, eventually spotting his wand and pocketing it.
“Well go on, then.” Ginny gives Harry a nudge, her voice low. “Go and have a quick whizz round. I’ll put the food away, sort out the lighting down here and get everyone settled.”
“Are you going to fuck me?” Harry bites back a moan when Draco presses his fingers into Harry’s backside.
“Nowhere at all.” Harry reaches out a hand and Draco crosses the room quickly, leaving his towels on the floor and slipping under the sheets. “Still using as many towels as possible?”
“Well if Hermione said.” Harry tries not to sound angry, but he isn’t sure he manages it. “How’s work?”
“I don’t regret you,” Harry whispers. He knows, if offered the choice, there are things he would value above his job. With absolute certainty he also knows that Draco Malfoy is one of them. The knowledge that comes with understanding what it is to be free and to stop living a lie burns fierce and bright inside him, but it doesn’t dull the ache of the things he’s lost. He wishes he could have both. Live as he wants to in every respect. In work, in love.
“Nothing,” Draco lies. Considering he hates the place he’s been having the strangest fantasies about sex with Harry in various parts of Merlin’s Kitchen. “I’m just planning to be helpful. With the sign.”
“Changing the subject so soon?” Draco laughs. “Because I get more done when I’m not being pulled into meetings every five minutes or trying to explain futures to trainees. Why do you make jokes about work? Is the current day job not exciting enough for you?”
He reaches across the bed to the rumpled sheets and the warmth of the mattress that confirms the night wasn’t just a dream. The sound of the shower lets him know that Draco’s still around, which is a good thing at least. There’s a hot cup of something next to Harry’s wand and glasses and he props himself up to drink it. The familiar taste of strong, black coffee reminds him of countless lazy weekends in bed with Draco. A kernel of warmth swells in Harry’s chest as he thinks about the previous night. Part of him is happy things ended the way they did, but there’s a smaller voice that reminds him the night ended with some things left unsaid.
“No wonder this thing has its own room.” Harry takes in the huge screen, shaking his head. “Nobody has a telly this size.”
“Thestral tail hair.” Draco holds up a hand when Harry begins to protest. “I know Ollivander doesn’t believe in anything other than Dragon heartstrings, unicorn hair or phoenix feathers, but I learned my craft from Gregorovitch’s daughter. It’s not unheard of to use Thestral tail hair in wands in other parts of the world.”
“You’re being deliberately evasive.” A flash of annoyance courses through Draco and he leans in, lowering his voice to a hiss. “You know precisely what I mean.”
“I wasn’t travelling for all of it. I spent time with a Mind Healer first. They were good, but the retreat I went to after wasn’t. I’m shit at yoga too if you’re interested.”
“I was there earlier.” Harry takes off his robes and closes the door behind him. His throat is scratchy, his voice hoarse. Since leaving the Burrow he’s been wandering around, until eventually he found his way to the Manor. The desperate, rolling anger has faded and now everything is numb and he’s so, so cold.
He takes in the vast, clean, white space that looks nothing like the Manor of old. Like the long corridors leading to Draco’s study, the living room is decorated with a painstaking eye for detail. Huge, colourful prints add interest to the blank walls and a large, opulently padded Chesterfield coffee table sits in the centre of the room, covered in arty-looking books. Harry picks up a small bronze. He nearly drops it when he realises it’s a sculpture of a naked man. Putting it gingerly back on the nearest surface, he shoves his hands into his pockets.
“Haven’t you heard magic isn’t allowed in here?” Draco points to the wall where countless signs bear the one rule Merlin’s Kitchen strictly enforces. “Authorised personnel only.”
“Are you happy at Hogwarts?” Draco asks. He’s not sure why it’s important to him, but there is still a restless energy that buzzes and hums through the shop whenever Harry’s around. Draco knows a lot about moving from place to place and he supposes what he really wants to ask is
“You have all the maturity of a ripe Mandrake, Potter.” Draco rolls his eyes. He stands again and moves to the window, watching his former classmates dancing under the magical fairy lights that look like stars. “Why on earth would somebody trying to escape attention buy a flat in the main wizarding shopping street above the busiest nightclub in town?”
“You’re staying over?” The house is warmer than ever, the heavy weight in Harry’s heart easing. “Malfoy, too?”
“I said enjoy yourself, not Wronski feint into my feet, you prat.” Ginny grins, giving Harry a light punch on the arm. She glances over her shoulder. “There’s no one around. Take off that cloak, it’s weird not being able to see you.”
The more Draco sees Harry in the flesh, the harder it is to keep up the pretence of not knowing exactly who Griffin is. Even small talk feels like one more lie piled on an already steaming pile of them. With his guilt intensifying, Draco knows this nonsense has to end. Although he doesn’t feel too bad about his early evasiveness—Harry is clearly as reckless on Quick-Match as he is on the Quidditch pitch—their conversations in person and as
Harry glances at Rosie and Hugo chattering excitedly, clearly thrilled to have their dad back. Hermione looks happier than she has in weeks, her smile broad as she chats to Molly. The sight of them makes Harry’s heart clench, and not for the first time he feels left behind. People are moving on without him, his friends are building families of their own. Harry’s stuck arguing with Malfoy in Azkaban and suffering a crisis of confidence at the Ministry. Not to mention his girlfriend seems less eager to spend time with Harry by the day.
If the enthusiasm exhibited in the next half hour is anything to go by, Harry is all too happy to oblige.
“It’s normal for me. As normal as breathing.” Exhaustion sweeps over Harry and he gestures to the door. “Just go back to America, mate. Tell Robards I’m still a poof. Whatever.”
“Something like that.” Harry keeps cheerful, refusing to be baited. “Rescued a few Kneazles from trees, apprehended a wizard smuggling ring and used a Time-Turner to go back and kill Voldemort again, just to make sure I finished him off the first time. How are interest rates doing?”
“In a manner of speaking.” Draco frowns and picks at a small speck of dust on his trousers. “The papers got it all wrong. They made it sound like I was in Paris for the parties, the
“You’re all mouth, Malfoy.” Harry lets his gaze trail over Draco’s face. “I don’t reckon you’d know what to do with yourself if I
Harry shakes the niggling thoughts away and scowls when Hermione opens the door to his office, closing it behind her with a sharp flick of his wand and a huff of aggravation.
“You might want to reassure them you’re not here to arrest people, Potter. Drink?” Draco makes his way over to the bar, leaving Harry in the middle of the dancefloor with a number of unfamiliar faces staring at him. Some look angry, some scared and others just look sympathetic, or curious.
“I’m going to bed.” Harry looks out of the window. It’s still pitch-black outside but the rain has stopped. “It’s late.”
It turns out declarations of love are Harry’s thing because his orgasm spikes, hitting him with force as his cock pulses in his hand. He spills into his fist and stripes Draco’s chin and torso with his climax, leaving him utterly dishevelled. His chest rises and he settles back on his heels, still straddling Draco and trying to catch his breath.
“Perhaps you are fun after all,” Harry murmurs. He gives Draco a smile, and shifts their positions so Draco’s lying on his back. “Can I suck you off?”
“Merlin.” Despite his sore legs, Harry can’t get upstairs and into the bathroom quickly enough. He lets the steam from the hot water gather in the small room and strips off his clothes. He tries not to stare too openly as Draco follows suit, but it’s difficult.
“Whatever his name is.” Draco finishes his prawn and puts a meatball on his plate, with a frown. “If I can’t enjoy Thursday’s without Auror
“It doesn’t matter who knows, now.” Draco turns back to the window, watching the rain. “Not anymore.”
, the name Draco uses to protect his anonymity. Of every problem Quick-Match has caused, that’s the biggest of them all. Draco knows he has to do something, but he can’t just pack it in after chatting to Harry for one long, balmy summer and a hectic autumn. It wouldn’t be right, and Draco is, despite all evidence to the contrary, trying very hard to do the right thing these days.
“The spell has begun to eat away at the core. The only thing that can stop a phoenix feather used in a wand core from being destroyed by magic like that is—”
“Naturally.” Draco lets Harry kick off his shoes and then leads the way upstairs, gesturing towards one of the open doors. “That’s my room.”
“Outside it’s always quiet. Inside, not so much.” Draco winks at Harry and leads the way. He pauses at the black painted door before pushing it open. “Welcome to The Wandering Thestral, Harry.”
He remembers going to The Burrow that year. It was one of his first birthdays as a new Auror. Arthur couldn’t stop shaking his hand and clapping him on the back. Molly was so proud she cried. She sent Harry off with an armful of gifts and a huge pot of stew—
“I suppose I could.” Draco gives Harry a salty, filthy kiss that lasts for longer than expected before they finally break apart. “You taste like come. I suggest you shower and brush your teeth because I have plans for later. I’ve had a year of abstinence, after all.”
Harry is effectively cut off by Draco pushing two slick fingers inside him. The sensation is strange at first, but his body adjusts as Draco moves his fingers slowly in and out. His fingers press against a spot inside Harry that nearly makes him fall back onto the bed as he tries to hold himself up. It’s not that Harry isn’t capable of keeping in position, it’s just that everything Draco does makes his body ache with need. It becomes difficult to think clearly; his body perspires and pure, hot pleasure overwhelms him.
“I am when I’m in bed with you,” Draco counters. From the laugh that huffs against his skin, he’s confident Harry doesn’t believe him for a moment.
Harry sits back with a frown, contemplating Draco. He has dark shadows under his eyes, and he looks jumpy and on-edge. “Has something happened?”
“If you say so.” Hermione doesn’t sound convinced and the hot flush of shame returns, pricking at Harry’s skin.
“Not that young,” Harry points out, reluctantly. “It’s been fifteen years since the war and I’m in my thirties now. There are people like our parents—”
“You must be desperate if you need my help.” Draco stands and busies himself rearranging an already perfectly organised stack of wands, in a vain attempt to keep his thoughts from straying beyond business. Looking at Harry head on tends to lead his mind in a decidedly non-business-like direction. “Aren’t you supposed to be educating your protégés by telling them about your heroic conquests?”
“Don’t you bother doing this when it’s just you?” Harry glances at the food he’s certain he’s not going to be able to pronounce, his stomach grumbling at the delicious scent. “It’s a bit weird eating at a table for twenty by yourself.”
Draco rolls onto his back and turns his head to watch Harry. His cheeks are pink, and his hair messed up. Harry dips his head to kiss Draco, sliding his hand down Draco’s chest and into his boxers. It makes Draco hiss and arch up into Harry’s hand. The kiss becomes messier when Harry casts a wandless, non-verbal spell that leaves his hand slick. From the way Draco responds he’s not sure if it’s the lube or the magic, but there’s definitely something that makes it even better than before. Draco seems to come completely undone, his hands everywhere as he drags Harry as close as they can comfortably be, letting Harry bite down on his neck, his collarbone, his shoulder. It doesn’t take long for Draco to reach his climax, spilling over Harry’s fingers. With a sigh of contentment, Harry slides his hand off Draco’s cock and moves his fingers slowly up Draco’s chest.
Harry’s anger quells, replaced with something altogether less comfortable. His stomach squirms as it always does when this topic of conversation comes up in official briefings. Wizards and
Harry swallows, taking his time to consider his words instead of diving straight in like he usually does. “It’s not vile,” he says at last. “Not if you enjoyed it.”
“I know you’ve changed,” Harry says at last. “I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t believe it, so stop being such a self-righteous arse and let me help you. You don’t have to tell me the legislation’s shit, Hermione’s already gone through all its flaws. Several times.”
“Me and Ginny aren’t together,” Harry continues. He pointedly ignores Draco and the offered shot. “We’re just friends. Best friends. She knows everything.”
“You know how,” Draco murmurs. His cheeks are pink and he trails his hand down Harry’s chest without meeting his gaze. “Don’t get any ideas about this being a regular occurrence.”
“Fuck the goblins.” Draco’s body is tense and tightly coiled. “Do you think I’m incapable of supporting somebody? I expect you imagine I wouldn’t have the first clue how to handle anything difficult. Draco Malfoy, entitled little brat who doesn’t care for anyone but himself.”
Draco rolls his eyes. Harry’s famous, but he’s hardly a celebrity. He hasn’t been anything for the last three years other than absent. His hand twitches towards his wand wondering what the fuck Harry was going to say before they were rudely interrupted.
With another quick smile at Ginny, Harry races upstairs. One of the best things about being a wizard is that household chores take no time at all. He doesn’t know what the arrangement is between Ginny and Millie, so to avoid any awkwardness he cleans three rooms. With all the dust and cobwebs lifted, the upstairs looks brighter than before. The rooms that used to belong to Sirius, Regulus, and Orion and Walburga are sparkling clean, the beds neatly made and the bed linen fresh and crisp. The bathrooms have a new glossiness, the various cleaning products all tidied away neatly. Harry tidies his own bedroom too, his cheeks heating as he does so. It’s not that he expects anyone to sleep there with him, but he wouldn’t put it past Malfoy to have a nose around. That’s all.
anonymous Agony Aunt, and Ginny takes a seat next to Harry on the sofa, talking excitedly about the upcoming Quidditch season and her plan to go and visit Ron and Hermione in New York.
Harry rolls his eyes and kicks off his trainers, leaving them in an untidy pile. He refuses to be embarrassed about the fact his socks are burgundy and gold. Malfoy should be grateful he didn’t wear the
“You’re unbelievable.” Draco’s rotten mood is getting worse by the minute. It’s typical of Pansy to pull two seconds after getting into the club. The most action Draco’s had in weeks is a peck on the cheek from his mother. “You can’t just abandon me.”
“No, I don’t think that.” Harry glances around. “But it’s not like you’ve got a telly in your living room. You still use candles. You stamp your letters with a wax seal. Nobody does that.”
“Not without the phoenix who provided the feather for the core.” Draco expects Harry to look as crestfallen as he is, after the hours he spent poring over books for an alternative solution. “What are you looking so happy about?”
“You’re Harry Potter,” Ginny says fiercely. “That’s who you are. Not the Ministry, not some government department. They didn’t help you much when you needed them. They let a young boy fight their wars. They’d be wise to remember that.”
“Everything you wanted before. No more hiding away.” Draco holds Harry’s gaze, a light flush colouring his cheeks. “I told mother I was planning to see you. She said if we were able to resolve things, she’d like to have supper with us.”
“Then fuck me like you’re not,” Draco breathes. “Let’s pretend that’s all this is. You can fuck me like I’m a stranger.”
“Well of course I liked it,” Draco snaps. He bites out the same lubricating charm Harry used a few moments before. He wraps cool fingers around Harry, his breath hot and rough. “Don’t pretend it didn’t make you horny as fuck, too.”
“About time,” Hermione mutters. With a sigh, she shakes herself, all business again in her element as the dedicated Ministry lawyer she’s become over the years. “The legislation that passed last year was based on the Muggle Sexual Offences Act 1967, with few amendments. We’re decades past that, Harry.
“I can’t wait.” Harry’s throat is dry, his voice thick with emotion. He doesn’t know where he’ll be when they get back.
“I should leave.” Draco appears in the kitchen doorway, because of course he can’t give Harry room to breathe.
“You would.” Draco rolls his eyes, before his expression softens. “Although if that’s your opinion, I suppose I should take the compliment.”
“I’m fully aware of the circumstances of your arrest,” Harry replies, tightly. “My team arrested you because you broke the law—”
“I suppose it’s trial and error,” Harry says. He slides his fingers over the crisp cotton of Draco’s shirt, his skin warm through the thin material. Harry breathes in, his fingers tightening in the shirt, his breathing as ragged as Draco’s. “Trying different things until you find something that suits you.”
“You’ve got to be careful.” Harry speaks abruptly, the words spilling from his lips. “If they catch you again it might not be so easy to get you out of Azkaban.”
“Ten points to fucking Slytherin. Is this gay enough for you, or do I need to turn around so you can fuck me properly?”
“I’ll buy new ones.” Draco presses his hand against the wall, which is cool from the outside chill. It’s a sharp contrast to the heat that flares in his body as Harry’s fingers press lightly into the curve of his arse. “I hate to disappoint you, but I don’t think what you’re about to do is described as a
“They do say when Alder matches with a witch or wizard with a particular strength of conviction, there’s no better wand wood. Keep it. I’ve got some ideas about what I would like in return.”
He sends Draco an Owl and is surprised when a haughty looking owl brings back a roll of parchment. He opens it up and reads the letter which makes his cheeks hot.
“I don’t care who you fuck,” Draco lies. He bites back a groan as Harry’s lips travel along his neck. “Would you do this on the dancefloor too?”
Draco stands abruptly. It’s a hopeless charade pretending he doesn’t want to be somewhere private to see where the night takes them. He can’t be bothered to pretend anymore and technically Potter’s already made the first move so there’s nothing to lose.
“For one reason or another, I’ve always ended up with a particular kind of man. Not dissimilar to you, in many ways. Men who like to take control. Men who think they’re less gay just because they’re the ones doing the fucking or the ones getting sucked off.”
“In case I got lucky.” Harry has the audacity to wink at Draco, a warm smile playing over his lips. “Which I did.”
“You’ll need to. You owe me a very expensive shirt.” Draco takes a sip of his coffee which is unfairly delicious. Potter really is good at everything. It’s infuriating, to say the least.
“Yeah.” Harry takes a sip of his wine, the light booziness making him more relaxed than usual. “But not for the reasons you think.”
Harry shakes his head, his body warming at the suggestion. “Hardly. I just want to see it. I can’t believe you ever let loose.”
“There’s going to be a next time?” Draco ushers Harry down a quiet cobbled street, stopping under a small arch away from the hum of traffic and the chatter of late-night bars and clubs. “Careful, Potter. People will start to talk.”
“I suppose I should leave you to it,” Draco says, gruffly. He pats his tangled hair, his cheeks turning red when he appears to remember what caused the uncharacteristic messiness in the first place. “What are you going to do?”
“You know what.” Ron looks up. “It doesn’t matter, I’m not here to talk about Gin. I can’t believe you’d be stupid enough to risk your job—”
or if his shop will ever recover, but he no longer cares. He only has himself to blame for giving the most stubborn wizard he knows the most stubborn wand wood. He never told Harry as much, but Gregorovitch always felt differently about Alder than Ollivander, whose notes indicated that Alder wands are best suited to someone with a different temperament to the wood itself. Draco always puzzled over the idea that a stubborn wand would do best with a more pliant owner. When he raised the question with Mia, she told Draco that her father’s perspective was different.
“Do you think I’m ashamed of it?” Draco keeps a careful eye on Harry whose expression, for once, gives nothing away.
Returning to Britain on the cusp of spring reminded Draco of the things he missed during his time abroad. He found himself taking long walks in the countryside to clear his head. He would practice the magical skills he had acquired in Europe in the vast, open spaces of Wiltshire. It was several months later when he spotted a small advertisement in the paper for the higgledy-piggledy little shop in Hogsmeade. All too aware of the crimes committed against Garrick Ollivander at the Manor, Draco was determined not to establish a business that would compete with Ollivander’s in any way. Instead, he set up a shop that focused on wand restoration and repair, rather than making and selling new wands.
“Give me time. I haven’t had a coffee yet.” Harry glances at Draco’s coffee machine and nudges his glasses up on his nose. “Is that just for staff?”
“Yes.” Draco swallows back the desire that pulses through him at Harry’s proximity. He really does smell divine. “I’ll see you at the same time tomorrow, try not to—”
“I hauled Dawlish in to reprimand him about that, not that it did much good.” Once again, a hot fury curls within Harry. He’s part of the actions taken against people like Roger. Directly or not, it’s his team policing Knockturn, on his watch. “They usually listen to me or come to me directly if they disagree with my approach, but not on this. I haven’t been involved with Knockturn in years. I was attacked shortly after the war and the Ministry felt it was a security risk to have me working in that area, not to mention my face is too familiar. Dawlish has always run stuff over there. It doesn’t help that Robards keeps overruling me.”
“You played moderately well,” he drawls instead. Draco is a reformed character, but he’s still an arsehole when he wants to be.
“We’ll always be family,” Ginny replies, fiercely. “Even if it’s not the kind of family people expected us to be.”
“Unexpected.” Harry laughs and when Draco looks up, he’s surprised to see how bright and expressive Harry looks when he’s talking about Jean-Paul. “He keeps things interesting. I like that.”
Draco raises an eyebrow and gives Harry a careful look. Eventually he frowns and looks away, clearly deep in thought.
“I’m not hard because you look like me.” Harry laughs, breathlessly. “I’m not that much of a tosser.”
Draco steps back from Harry and reaches for his wand to cast a quick Cleaning Charm over them both. His jaw tightens as he tucks himself back into his trousers, his cheeks pink, his hair perfectly messy and everything about him deliciously rumpled. Harry tries not to stare, tidying himself up and clearing his throat when the silence becomes awkward.
like last time. They arrest people for the smallest things, looking at someone funny, dancing. I could be curled up on the ground and they’d give me a swift kick then charge me with resisting arrest.”
“I never said I w—” Harry breaks off with a groan when Draco slides his hand more quickly. “Yeah, that’s—”
“How do you imagine?” Draco’s shoulders tighten. “Exactly as I anticipated. My father with disgust, my mother with tears.”
Harry nearly chokes on his beer, swallowing quickly. That explains the odd looks and furtive glances. Lee isn’t the first person who’s been weird around Harry since he took on Draco’s case. Pritchard didn’t pass the biscuits to Harry at the last Auror meeting, which is as pointed a snub as a Junior Auror would be comfortable making. There’s been a strange air in briefings and lots of whispered conversations that stop when he enters a room. Harry’s starting to worry his authority is on shaky grounds.
“You’re a right arse leaving him to deal with that by himself, Malfoy.” Lee rolls his eyes and helps himself to a bottle of beer.
It’s typical of Draco to skulk around outside feeling sorry for himself without plucking up the courage to knock on the door. He had plenty of opportunity to talk to Harry properly earlier, but instead he stayed for barely an hour, leaving when he’d polished off the last of his expensive wine. In keeping with the rest of the evening he didn’t have much to say for himself, walking out of the door with a snide
“With you, apparently.” Harry shrugs. He clears his throat, wondering if it would be rude to ask Draco about his suspicions. “Have you done all of that before?”
“I’m glad you’re here.” Harry pushes a hand through his hair, a flush of pleasure as he meets Draco’s gaze making his body hot. “All of you. I was going mad by myself.”
“I might,” Draco replies. “I know most of the crowd that go to The Purple Niffler and only a handful of them are desperate enough to go out with you.”
Fury rolls through Harry and he stands. “I’ve protected your son with my life, Arthur. Countless times, just as he’s protected mine. There have been no distractions, no
“How good?” Draco pushes his hand into Harry’s hair, pulling his head back a little. “Tell me how much you want to be fucked.”
“Ginny?” Harry approaches awkwardly, heat blooming in his cheeks when she spins around with a look of shock on her face. “I wanted to surprise you.”
If kissing can ever be a trustworthy indicator of expertise in bed, there’s a good chance Draco’s going to leave Merlin’s Kitchen forgetting his cloak, his torn shirt and his own name. It’s not that Harry has any special moves, but he goes about kissing with a strident, Potterish force. It’s a very good job that Draco had a wank in the shower before leaving the house as it’s the only thing that spares him the indignity of coming in his pants.
“You’re no fun,” Harry mutters. Draco’s firmness sends another bolt of pleasure through him, despite his words. “No fun at all-ah—”
“You’re going to be the death of me.” Draco fists his hand into Harry’s unruly hair and with a groan, he slides back into his mouth. He attempts a few practice thrusts to ensure Harry really did just give Draco permission to fuck his mouth, and then stops overthinking it.
“Would you be disappointed in me?” Harry looks at the photograph, but his parents stay silent as they turn, kiss and beam, turn, kiss and beam.
“Thanks for reminding me.” Draco spears his fork into a prawn, aggressively. “Thursday used to be for other things. If that can’t happen without Pilchards—”
“Tell them whatever you tell Ron and make sure they know I’m fine with it. They’re going to start worrying otherwise and I don’t want mum turning up dabbing her eyes with a hanky and wailing about not having grandchildren even though she’s already got loads.” Ginny pauses. “I don’t—I’m not ready, Harry. Not yet. Not to tell them about me.”
“As you asked so politely.” Draco kisses Harry before pulling back, a dark look in his eyes. “Let’s get out of here before I fall on my arse.”
.” Ron’s cheeks are red with anger, his expression furious. “Don’t put words in my mouth. I just mean you’d have told me. We’re supposed to tell each other everything. We’re best mates, we’ve fought wars together, we’ve worked alongside one another as Aurors for years. Don’t you think I deserved to know?”
“Please don’t,” Draco replies. There’s a note of panic in his voice. “Potter here doesn’t need to hear about my sex life. He might be forced to put me in Azkaban again.”
On Saturday morning, Draco makes his way to the shop clutching a ham and cheese toastie and a hot chocolate from Madam Puddifoots. Despite it being completely inappropriate breakfast fare, he woke up with a niggling headache that hasn’t dissipated, and he needed the walk. After a long night on Quick-Match with Griffin, Draco worked well into the early hours of the morning trying to find a fix for Harry’s wand. Depressingly, his research proved futile and he suspects the time they spend together is going to be far shorter than Harry was likely expecting. The answer seems quite simple. The damage to the wand is irreparable and fixing it would take a miracle.
“Good lord.” Draco stifles a yawn. “Thank fuck I’m still single and attractive, or at least I will be once the stench of Azkaban has been scrubbed from my skin.”
“You didn’t get new gloves,” Harry murmurs. He touches the necklace, the surface smooth beneath his fingers.
Despite everything Molly and Arthur said to him, Harry can’t help but remember how much older Arthur seemed, how tired Molly looked. Some days he wants to scream and rage, but on his calmer days—like today—he doesn’t hate or judge them. Even now, even after everything, if anything ever happened to Molly or Arthur, Harry’s heart would be broken. He would hunt down anyone that harmed either of them. He loves Molly and Arthur still. That hasn’t changed, even if it would be easier if his affection for them could just go away. He doesn’t want Ginny to lose her relationship with her family. He knows how much it hurts.
The evening has a strange, surreal quality to it. Harry didn’t expect coming out to be like this. The initial weightlessness was freeing, but he never expected it to be so fleeting. He wasn’t prepared for Draco’s revelation or the crushing panic that followed. It dawns on Harry how irrevocably his whole world has changed. Anything he does from here—all those things he wanted to explore—are crimes, in the wizarding world. His whole career has been based around preventing crime and now he’s committing one simply by existing. He’s not even able to be gay like everyone else, his position a footnote, an overlooked clause. He just wants it all to go away, to find space to breathe.
Harry takes a breath when there’s a lull in the conversation. “About Malfoy’s new bloke,” he starts.
but it’s the same thing.” Harry shrugs, helping himself to a beer and taking a long swig. “They couldn’t do much else, with the law the way it is.”
“You never said.” Draco’s eyes widen and his voice wavers, a splash of pink rising in his cheeks. “Why wouldn’t you tell me?”
“Maybe. Bulstrode and her protests, Jordan and his obsession with queer Americana and Muggle balls, Granger back at the Ministry. There are people determined to change the world.” Draco shifts closer to Harry, their bodies touching as they watch the clouds. “Maybe Millicent’s right. One day we’ll just be two old queens, saying
The kiss happens with such speed, it almost catches Harry off-guard. It’s nothing like the slow, exploratory kiss from earlier. It’s the kind of kiss that reminds Harry of their night out in London and being at Malfoy Manor. It goes straight to Harry’s cock, his body surging against Draco’s as he pushes his hands into Draco’s hair and deepens the kiss. He falls back against the nearest wall with a thud, the brilliance of being free to do whatever they want pulsing through him. The anticipation leaves him breathless, Draco’s hot, searching lips making everything warm. He’s a single man. They both are. They’re not outside, they’re miraculously not fighting anymore and there’s nothing stopping either of them.
I don’t know anymore. I like this rough kissing idea. I bet that gets you hard, or it should if he knows what he’s doing.
He brushes his fingers over the photo of his parents and watches as they turn, kiss and beam up at him. He wishes he could ask them if they still love him. He wishes he could talk to his mum, just for a second. He thinks about trying to find the Resurrection Stone again, about sneaking into the Ministry to see if he can hear Sirius behind the Veil.
“Both.” Draco sits back in his seat and presses his fingers together as he watches Harry. “It’s interesting that you have to clarify what I mean. There are so many options, aren’t there?”
Draco shakes his head. He can suffer the indignity of wearing burgundy and gold if it means more mind-blowing orgasms might be on the cards.
Draco nods and sends his mug of coffee to the kitchen with its industrial concrete surfaces, bricks and brushed steel. The cold décor mingles with the warmth of Harry’s magic, the chatter and laughter from outside and the lights that flicker in the living space like flames.
“There’s a reason I’m telling you all of this.” Draco rubs his temple and for the first time Harry sees how tired he looks.
“You enjoyed working with trainee Aurors and people always need to brush up on their magic. Even Gringotts constantly turns talented witches and wizards away because they don’t have strong enough spell casting abilities. We’re not like the Muggles with their pens and computers. Have you ever been on the Gringotts trading floor? Currency Conversion and Statistic Charms all over the damn place.”
The witch’s quill moves rapidly in the air, taking detailed notes. Harry knows from his experience disciplining junior Aurors that a note-taking Magical Person Resources employee in a meeting is never a good sign. He looks down at the piece of parchment and swallows thickly at the exact copy of Draco’s letter from the day before.
At around ten that evening, Draco’s Quick-Match Quill vibrates eagerly which is a sure sign of trouble. With a sigh, Draco taps the Passion Parchment which flips open to the next blank page.
Harry makes his way quickly inside, orders a pint of water, chips and some bread. He knows he’s dangerously close to saying something to Draco he’s likely to regret, and he resolves to take it easy on the wine. It’s one thing being open around George and Lee, it’s a totally different thing being open around Draco.
a rule to break. All he wants is a quiet, normal life with a Crup and the warm arms of someone he loves—whatever the law thinks of it—wrapped around him.
“Not exactly,” Ron replies. Harry turns to find himself confronted with a sheepish looking Ron and a very uncomfortable looking Draco. “I thought it was only right he should be here,” Ron continues. “I invited him myself.”
Kingsley stares at Harry, his expression grim. “If there is any truth to the rumours—any truth at all—it will ruin you professionally. You can’t be so inclined and remain an Auror. It’s a criminal offence and that can’t be overlooked, not even for you. Even if the law itself is desperately unfair, it is still the law.”
“I’m—” Harry’s voice is heavy with want, his mouth forming unspoken vowels on Draco’s skin. “Shit, I—”
. “A few hours ago, you were pretending not to give a fuck about me and making stupid comments about the weather. The next thing I know you’re moping around on my doorstep like a lost Crup, now you’ve got the nerve to tell me
“I can only imagine,” Draco murmurs. Yoga isn’t exactly his poison either, but the image of Harry stretching in loose trousers has its appeal. “Then you came back.”
He takes his glasses off, rubbing his eyes. The revelation that Draco Malfoy is one of the people Harry’s been avoiding thinking about has left him unsettled, and more than a little angry about the way his own team are clearly not observing the strides made by Hermione and others. With a sigh he casts the spell Hermione devised so they could contact one another easily at work. As he waits for her to arrive, he glances at the paper again, the text blurry without his glasses, and the memory of Malfoy’s mutinous expression sending another wave of guilt crashing over him. He should have been there on the night of the arrest. He never would have allowed someone to be arrested for an intimate moment in a Muggle area the general public never frequent at night.
Malfoy. “Marriage just isn’t for us. Loads of couples are happy without getting married. You’ll have to tell your mum, though. She’s been on at me for years and—”
“You’re so strange.” Draco shakes his head, but he looks fond enough that Harry doesn’t believe him.
“Not quite,” Harry murmurs. He runs his tongue over the head of Draco’s cock, then pulls back, giving him a cheeky grin. “What I had in mind involves you facing the other way, actually.”
“No pressure, then.” Harry grins. He reaches into Draco’s bedside drawer, knowing by now exactly where he keeps his lube. “How do you want it?”
sex before, Malfoy. You invited me round to fuck—dead romantic of you by the way—now you’re being noble again.”
Instead of feeling like time is racing on without him, Harry’s reminded how young he is, how young they all are. Thirty-two is nothing, not for a wizard, not even for a Muggle. He’s got friends, magic, the tentative flushes of whatever’s going on with Draco, and he’s not nearly as alone as he thought he was when he returned home to Grimmauld Place earlier that evening. The chill in the house ebbs away and everything already seems bright and alive with possibility.
“I love you too.” Harry clears his throat, his voice rough. He rubs his eyes and sits forward, watching the sunset. “What happens now?”
“I wouldn’t have left you for anyone else, you idiot.” Harry swallows, thinking of the times he called Draco a coward for not being able to admit what was happening between them. “I’d never have sent that stupid letter if I you'd just talked to me and told me that’s what you were doing.”
“Bisexual. I go out in Knockturn a lot. It’s how I know Malfoy. Earless knows all about it too, has done for ages.”
“I’d hardly say we’re friends,” Harry replies. He keeps his voice level. “I helped with his case. Does it bother you?”
“Yeah. I've had fun.” Harry watches Lee on the dancefloor, doing something that he now knows is called vogueing. He’s learning bit by bit, excited to find out more about Knockturn's bars and the secret lives of his friends that spend time in them. “We’ll come back?”
“Your secret’s safe with me.” Draco waves a dismissive hand and turns back to look out of the large windows.
“Don’t they have spare owls for staff?” Draco can’t believe Harry gives his owl a day off. They’re bloody
“Can you?” Draco’s breath is harsh and ragged. “You can’t be in charge of this like everything else in your life. Did it ever occur to you I might have precious little interest in being fucked by you? Perhaps
“Well it’s not right, is it?” Harry huffs. “He’s your dad, he shouldn’t say that sort of thing to you.”
Harry stands and faces his Ministry colleagues. He makes a speech about Hermione’s work and friendship that comes straight from the heart, and it’s a wonder he doesn’t break down in the middle of it.
Draco looks as though he wants to say something else, but in the end he doesn’t argue. He leaves the kitchen without so much as a backward glance, the thud of logs indicating he’s doing as Harry asked.
“I know.” Draco hates being reminded that he can be a selfish prick. It tends to make him defensive and he swallows back the urge to snap back at Harry. He knows he should have put a stop to things long before he did.
“With difficulty. I’ll tell you another time.” Hermione’s expression softens and in one quick step she’s across the living room and holding Harry in a warm hug. “Oh Harry,” she sniffles. “
“Dull, but I managed to get everything finished with time to spare before you arrived.” Draco pushes open a door, and gestures for Harry to go in first. “After you.”
“Clearly.” Draco’s expression is tight and pinched. “So fine you were drinking your godfather’s fusty old Firewhiskey during the day.”
Harry gives a nod to Lee and Draco, not missing the way Draco’s eyes flash as he takes in Harry’s attire. He’s been told before—by Hermione and Ginny admittedly—that he suits his Auror robes, but he can’t work out if Draco agrees.
Harry laughs, the mood between them easing just a little. “I think I’m going to leave the Ministry be for the moment. George said I could work with him at the shop. Just until I work out what’s next.”
If I told you that, we might not be strangers anymore. I wouldn’t want to say anything that might compromise your wanky air of mystery.
“Yes, of course.” Draco nods in an attempt at innocence, but the hunger in his expression says otherwise.
“As you were,” Draco replies. In for a Knut, in for a Galleon he supposes. “Stop being so considerate, Potter. It doesn’t suit you.”
is. Seeing Harry in the flesh in his shop today put things into perspective. It’s a lot easier to have an illicit correspondence-based affair with someone when they’re not standing in your shop looking sad about their wand, arranging private consultations and calling them
sound like they’re going to spend Saturday fucking. In truth, he would clear his diary for far less than a wilting wand when it comes to Harry.
“I’m here to help you with your paperwork.” Harry hands Draco a stack of official documents when he opens the door.
“Maybe in a bit.” Harry stands close to Draco, the heat of his body already making Harry feel more tethered. The fact that Ron was the one who invited Draco just makes it even better. He’s not sure Ron’s going to be up for lots of long evenings sitting around sharing war stories with Draco, but it’s a start. A bloody big start. An open, public support of Harry’s choice of partner at a party with plenty of people that would prefer to see Harry start a new life anywhere else but wizarding London.
“Astoria made things easier,” Draco replies. His voice is low and thick with emotion. “She was the only person in our world I was truly open with before the law changed. My parents don’t count, because they dragged me kicking and screaming out of the closet and then tried to shove me straight back into it. Astoria was different. There was no laughter, no judgment. She never once looked at me oddly. Some people do, you know. When they find out.”
“No.” Harry’s chest tightens, and he changes the topic of conversation quickly. “You had a nice holiday?”
“I think you need to leave, Harry.” Arthur’s voice is dull and heavy with resignation. He sits in his chair once again and Harry sees for the first time how old he looks, how worried.
“What choices are you making now?” Harry turns on his side to look down at Draco, drinking in the sharp, angular lines of his face and the cloudy grey of his eyes.
Harry looks at his friend, his chest clenching. Hermione does look more frazzled than usual, a quill stuck in her hair and her fingers stained with ink. He knows how late she works, how tirelessly she gives the Ministry so much of her time. Ron’s been away for three months working with the Magical Congress on dangerous potions infiltrating American cities, an area he specialised in after the war, eradicating many of the illegal brewing activities in England. Harry doesn’t have the foggiest how Hermione manages to work round the clock and raise Hugo and Rosie single-handedly too. Harry decided a Crup was too much like hard work last week. He resolves to do whatever she asks.
“I love you too. We all do.” Hermione tucks the duvet around Harry and the sound of her pottering around the room soothes him. As he drifts to sleep he’s sure he can feel her fingers in his hair, her voice quiet and warm. “It’s going to be okay, Harry. I’ll make sure of it.”
The tension that crackled and sparked between them all night moves from lingering looks and loaded comments to pure, unfiltered physical contact. At least it’s unfiltered for Harry. He can’t help but notice that Draco’s hands stay very firmly in safe territory, despite clutching Harry hard enough to hurt. He’s not entirely sure why Draco’s holding back but he’s not the smug, arrogant tosser he was at the Manor. Harry’s surprised to find he almost misses it. The way Draco carefully avoids pushing things further is driving Harry up the fucking wall—literally
“Some people do. Including the Ministry.” Draco helps himself to some soup, sipping it off his spoon. “You can’t make a magical house of this age and size compatible with Muggle technology. It would take years. I’ve conducted the necessary filters and spells required to have a functioning television in one of the bedrooms upstairs. That’s where I watch films.”
“Good?” Draco slides his arm around Harry after the necessary Cleaning Charms are cast and they both nestle together in the warm bed.
Somewhere between the first drink and the sixth, Harry falls asleep on the sofa. It’s pitch black when the sound of someone Apparating into the living room wakes him from a fitful sleep. Immediately alert, Harry grabs his wand and stumbles to his feet.
“Not really.” Draco’s reply pulls Harry from his thoughts. “I knew who I was long before I met Astoria. I was living as a gay man, albeit secretly. It was still illegal in our world then, of course.”
“You should.” Draco’s lips smile against Harry’s skin before he makes his way down Harry’s body. He murmurs a quick Cleaning Charm that makes Harry shiver. Even Draco’s magic feels good.
Ginny narrows her eyes. “I hope you haven’t been in cahoots with mum over this daft marriage idea. I’m too young.”
plays over and over like a song caught on loop. Draco might have had limited success with wizards, but he’s not completely naïve. He knows what invitations for coffee, a nightcap or a flat viewing mean. An invitation like Harry’s from one
Everything begins to slot into place. Unlike most of the staff who have specific subjects to teach, Harry is more likely to be found swanning around Hogsmeade in his Quidditch leathers one minute and teaching students how to defeat a Boggart the next. On one balmy summer evening after meeting with McGonagall to discuss starting his own apprenticeship in wandlore, Draco happened upon Harry in a small clearing, cooing over baby Thestrals and whispering to them in a low, soothing tone before disappearing off into the Forbidden Forest. Probably foraging for Blast-Ended Skrewts, knowing Potter. It’s exactly the kind of ugly thing he would find charming. It makes sense he would start his life at Hogwarts as a mini-Hagrid, literally and figuratively.
“I know enough to understand things have changed. You’ve changed.” Harry glances at Draco. “You’re pissed off.”
“You could always remind them you saved the world. I reckon that should get us at least a couple of flaming sambucas.” Lee flicks his wand, turning the tip of it into a quill. “It’s time for a team name. Any ideas, Harry?”
“Yes and no.” Harry closes his eyes and hums briefly to a song that has the dancefloor in a frenzy. “I suppose you’re right. It could be worse.”
“Of course I do,” Harry lies. He didn’t have a clue there were any gay bars in wizarding spaces, but then he doesn’t have much cause to go to Knockturn nowadays. It’s a security risk, and his face is so familiar it puts people on high alert. The lesser known Aurors and Unspeakables that can monitor the area inconspicuously are responsible for policing illegal activities there. “I’m afraid I can’t change that. You’ll have to exercise caution if you go anywhere the Aurors have jurisdiction.”
“Do I?” Ginny gives Harry a broad smile. “Does she talk about lesbians a lot too? My brother should buck up his game. Stranger things have happened.”
Draco’s body comes alive as he moves inside the hot, slick channel of Harry’s mouth. Harry seems to like it rough, and Draco tugs his head so he can watch his cock sliding in and out of Harry’s mouth. It’s blissfully, brilliantly good. He usually prides himself on being able to fuck someone slow, deep and long but with Harry everything is different. When Harry takes control back and grips Draco’s backside to pull him in, the white heat of his orgasm tears through him with a speed that almost takes him by surprise. His legs tremble from the effort of holding himself upright and Draco moves off Harry to collapse onto the bed.
The memory of the moment comes flooding back to Draco and he groans at his own stupidity. He can remember licking his lips, deciding
“Because there wasn’t a better alternative. Anything more progressive would have been impossible.” Hermione takes a seat and glares at Harry. “If you had listened—”
“You no longer have the authority to access the Head Auror’s office. Your things will be packed and dispatched to an address of your choosing. You can—”
Harry clears his throat, glancing at George who gives him an odd look. Harry takes a breath and shoves aside the feeling that he’s treading on eggshells. He stops trying to second-guess what Lee and George want him to say and decides to be frank. This isn’t a meeting with Robards or the Aurors. Lee and George are his friends.
Draco’s career options were not what they might have been, had things been different. He knows he’s been lucky to get a job he enjoys that pays reasonably well and has a connection to the magical world. The small firm with its tiny office above bustling Liverpool Street crowds might not have the grandeur of Gringotts, but it suits Draco very well. He likes being able to go for lunch in a place where he can lose himself on a street full of Muggle strangers.
“What kind of things?” Draco asks a little breathlessly. He meets Harry’s gaze and tries not to react to the heat behind his eyes. “I’m not going to teach you how to say anything like
“Not exactly.” Draco spreads Harry open and slides his tongue lightly over Harry’s hole. The move takes Harry by surprise and he curls his hand into a fist, tugging at the sheets.
It turns out Draco’s methods of getting Harry to be quiet are incredibly successful. Not that Harry’s quiet, exactly. It’s difficult to stop the pleas that fall from his lips as Draco works his tongue over Harry’s most intimate of places. In the end, Harry stops trying to be less obvious about his pleasure. Draco seems to enjoy every sound Harry makes. Each groan and
it generally means there’s some big evil looming, and we all know how that turns out. I’ll take a few more years without excitement.”
“There’ll be none of that. You’ve been nothing but trouble,” Draco mutters. The last thing he wants on a perfectly pleasant Monday morning is to deal with Quick-Match. He points a finger at the quill which gives him another insolent, feathery flutter. It curls in on itself and turns in the ink pot in an agitated fashion. With a resigned sigh, Draco taps his wand against a blue book. “
“You could have done, it’s no more than I deserve.” Draco frowns at Harry. “I wasn’t making any noise. I didn’t wake you, did I?”
, Malfoy. I’ve been trying to shove this down, pretend it wasn’t there, hide it away from myself—not to mention everybody else—for years.”
Draco purses his lips, a flicker of amusement in his gaze that Harry can tell he’s just dying to keep hidden. “Terribly exciting. Weasley will be thrilled to hear the Galleon is performing well against the Dollar.”
Harry reaches across the desk and helps himself to a quill, countersigning the documents. When he’s finished, he puts the file on Draco’s desk. “Don’t forget to send those to the Ministry.”
Instead of the frantic fever of the previous night, the kiss is slow and steady. Passion flares through Harry, bright and hot in his chest. The knots in his stomach slowly unwind and for the first time since he started kissing Draco again, he enjoys it without any inhibitions. He takes in the breathy whimper as he tugs Draco’s lip lightly between his teeth, the slide of their tongues together dizzying. Having time to kiss Draco and knowing he’s going to stick around reminds Harry of the long nights that would stretch into morning and the slow tease as they would draw the hours out for as long as possible.
“I will be when you start fucking me,” Harry replies. He bites back a groan at the slick, cool sensation of lube between his buttocks and the thick, blunt pressure of Draco’s cock against his hole. He wets his lips, thinking of the response when he asked
“I wasn’t that brave,” Harry replies. “I wasn’t ready to tell your mum and dad either. I wouldn’t have told them at all if I didn’t know the stupid story the Ministry gave people was full of holes. I had to tell them. Just like I had to tell Robards. It wasn’t my choice. I lost the option of keeping it to myself the minute Pritchard went snooping through my desk.”
“I thought things had been blissfully peaceful.” Draco gives Harry the hint of a smile. “Should I open the champagne?”
Harry yanks off his glasses and shuts Draco up by kissing him firmly. His hands shake as heat pulses through his body. His sudden arousal overwhelms him, sharp and intense. He wants to show Draco, wants to prove
“Fine.” Draco slams the door with a flick of his wand and leads Harry into the living room. He sits on the edge of the padded coffee table, facing the sofa. He puts his arms on his legs and leans forward, clearly trying his level best not to make a snide comment. “Go on, then.”
“Afternoon, George.” Harry rubs his hands together trying to warm them, grateful to see a friendly face. He’s surprised when George pulls him into a fierce hug.
“I have some.” Draco wets his lips. “I wouldn't do anything rash, however. There's a blond at the bar giving you the eye.”
or make a stupid joke about lesbians, if he had any jokes about lesbians. Something to lighten the mood.
but he pushes it firmly to one side, focusing on Ginny. She’s the one who makes him safe, and happy.
sex. But this is something different, something that makes Harry feel as though Draco wants Harry in every way. He’s quite happy to keep fucking Draco and to be fucked in every possible position, with all the magic or none at all and he wants Draco to know it.
as he puts it. His whole mood is more energised than usual and he seems in his element, chatting and laughing with people Harry doesn't recognise before going to change his outfit.
“Oh.” Harry rubs his cheek, thinking. It’s all so stupid, the heartache of the last year could have been so easily avoided. “The thing is Malfoy, you already were.”
Draco finishes lighting the candles and gestures to one of the large sofas, mercifully oblivious to Harry’s staring. “Lucky for you I don’t have any plans, so I suppose I can entertain you for a while. Unless you’re here on official business?”
As he sips his hot chocolate, Draco’s mind flickers to his upcoming meeting at Hogwarts. It’s strange, thinking about going back. If he tries hard enough, he can picture his younger self sitting close to the Great Lake and listening to the waves lapping against the banks, straining for the sound of Merepeople singing. With a sigh, Draco looks up at the white sky which already looks as though it’s preparing for a snowstorm.
The combined pleasure makes Harry cry out as he twists and bucks on the bed, his whispers and pleas falling into the darkening room around them. Everything else melts away and it’s like they’re flying again, up in the sky where nothing can touch them. Harry pushes Draco back when he gets closer to the edge.
.” Draco rolls his eyes and sits up, moving over Harry and sliding down his body to put him out of his misery. “I don’t know who told you that you’re hung like Hippogriff but—”
“Yes.” Draco’s lips curve. “It really wasn’t all bad, Potter. I had a tremendous amount of fun. I worked at Gringotts and kept my head down during the week, then I went to Manchester during the weekends. The Aurors weren’t half as interested in trying to weed us out as they have been since the law changed, so they never bothered with any of the bars outside of London.”
“I bet you do.” Harry rolls his eyes. He picks a marshmallow out of the glass, licking the gooey stickiness from his thumb in a way that should be indecent. “I was surprised you didn’t push harder to get on the team. You could have played. You’ve always been good at Quidditch.”
They’ve been naked together before, but Harry’s never really had the chance to look at Draco’s body quite so openly and doing so makes his mouth water. Draco really is gorgeous, from his toned, tight arse to his ridiculously Malfoy-ish hair. It’s not the lithe lines of Draco’s legs and torso Harry’s most focused on, though. His eyes keep flicking beneath the light trail of hair that leads to Draco’s cock. He knows what it looks like. He’s had it in his hand, in his mouth. But seeing it half-hard and heavy between Draco’s legs leads Harry’s mind directly to other things he could do with it. The other things Harry desperately wants him to do.
“You’re a fine one to talk,” Draco mutters. He glares at Harry, who finally yanks his eyes upwards again. “Why didn’t you tell me you knew?”
“No, not really. Things just built up, I started thinking about Sirius.” Harry shrugs. “It’s okay. It’s better, now you lot are here.”
“Surely the great Harry Potter isn’t afraid of a few Thestrals?” Draco can’t help but be smug about finding the chink in Harry’s armour. “I suppose they can be rather intimidating.”
“How’s your wand?” Away from the crowds, they stroll towards the castle to collect Harry’s things before going into Hogsmeade for the after party at the Three Broomsticks.
“Changed my mind.” Draco breathlessly tugs Harry’s jeans down, practically salivating as Harry’s delicious cock springs free from his pants and trousers. “If that’s okay.”
“Not nearly as dreadful as I expected,” Draco agrees. “Do you want to come to the Manor afterwards?”
“Well.” Draco wipes Harry’s come from the corner of his mouth, his eyes shining with mirth. “If I’d have known that’s all it takes to get you to come on command…”
Harry snorts. “Are you kidding me? I wasn’t checking out your arse if that’s what you’re worried about.”
“Not yet.” Draco shakes his head. “Granger thinks they’re going to sweep it under the rug. I expect they’ll ask you to sign off on an official story that won’t be the
“I couldn’t agree more.” Even now it surprises Draco when he finds common ground with Harry. A shared opinion about hot chocolate and coffee feels like a small victory.
“Not even I’m that nosy.” Harry holds up the book. “You left this out. I didn’t know you used Quick-Match.”
“I’ll try to contain myself.” Draco finishes his food and puts his napkin on the table, taking a sip of his wine. “Don’t start snooping around our bars, just because I’ve piqued your curiosity. They’re the few places left in the world that wouldn’t welcome Head Auror Potter with a fanfare. If you want to see what it’s like, you can ask me. I’ll take you. I’d suggest you use a Glamour, for your sake as well as mine.”
“Yeah,” Harry replies. He decides quizzing Malfoy about his interest in Lee can wait. “I’m not going to barge in on their weekend plans. I really am fine. I’ll be perfectly happy here doing the garden. I promise.”
“Say something.” Draco’s voice is quiet and he presses into Harry again, another smooth, deep stroke. “Harry?”
“I was thinking.” Harry settles on the sofa and reaches for Draco when he looks like he’s going to sit on the armchair. “Do you have to be so far away?”
“Don’t I?” Harry’s voice is calm but there’s a hum of tension in the air. He’s worked in interrogation for long enough to know when he’s being goaded. He stands and moves close to Draco, until he’s backed against the wall. He puts his palm flat beside Draco’s head, taking in the flash of his eyes and the way his breath becomes unsteady. “You’re so full of shit. I’m not sure what you think you’re going to achieve by riling me up.”
“Is it so hard to fuck indoors, like normal people?” Harry sits back, closing his eyes as he tries to steady his breathing. This shouldn’t be happening.
They gather Harry’s things into a small rucksack and make their way back out of the castle, into the icy winter air. The fresh snow is crisp beneath their feet as they leave Hogwarts behind and make their way at a steady pace towards the school gates.
“Isn’t it?” Draco shuffles his forms, to indicate the conversation is over. Nosy-parker Potter isn’t half interested in Draco’s love life. He might not have had boyfriends, but that doesn’t mean he’s
“It doesn’t bother me that you want to. The fact you can’t keep your hands to yourself around me is quite flattering.”
“I imagine not,” Harry mutters. He tries not to think too closely about the implication behind Draco’s suggestion that he
“Don’t get dressed on my account,” Draco murmurs. He puts the photograph down and moves close. For one heart-stopping minute, Harry thinks Draco is going to kiss him. Instead, he reaches around Harry to pick up the cologne. “Is this Muggle?”
Draco had no intention of signing up for Quick-Match, the hottest new craze in the wizarding world designed to offer a solution to all romantic woes. Draco is attractive, wealthy, he has his own business and he’s worked hard to become a better man than the child he used to be. As evidence of the time put into reforming his character, last year Draco even appeared on the bumper end-of-year
“Hopeful,” Harry corrects. “It would have been a bit of a bore to get things going then having to go back to my room in the dungeons. I’m with all the bloody Slytherins.” He winces. “No offence.”
Harry swallows. It’s the second time in as many weeks that Ginny’s mentioned how rubbish London is. No matter how hard he tries he can’t picture Ginny holed up in the shadowy rooms of Grimmauld Place, helping Harry entertain their friends in the way Molly and Arthur do with such generosity. Like marriage, the conversation about living together—and where—is one they both seem content to put off.
“The only things I know about you, I’ve heard second hand.” Harry gives Draco a lopsided smile. “Not to mention I don’t always see eye to eye with Hermione.”
“Fine. I’ll help you fix your light.” Draco arches an eyebrow at Harry. “You could have just asked me round for dinner.”
“I will.” Hot tears prick at the back of Harry’s eyes as he imagines everything falling apart. He wonders how he looks to Kingsley, hot-cheeked and on the verge of tears.
“I see.” Draco’s voice is low and surprisingly comforting. “If you want a bit of advice, stop trying to fight it. It’s better when you do.”
. He begins to speak urgently. “I agree with you, Harry. About the legislation, about the unfairness of it all. It’s one of the reasons I’m so keen to see someone like Hermione become Minister. But she’s not there yet, and until she is it is imperative that you choose your battles wisely.”
“Isn’t everyone, Earless?” Lee winks at George and Harry laughs. Draco returns to the table, sitting next to Harry and putting down a tray of shots.
Harry laughs and the sound warms Draco’s skin. As they sit close with their legs pressed together, it occurs to Draco that Harry doesn’t just look good. He also smells fantastic. His cologne is rich, leathery and expensive. The underlying sweat from the exertion of dancing calls to mind other things that might make Harry sweat. Draco looks briefly at Harry’s lips, a steady pulse of unquenchable desire making everything unsteady.
“We thought you might be,” Ginny replies, cheerfully. “With Hermione gone and the fact you’ve been avoiding me. That’s why we came.”
. Draco looks at the ring he always wears on the third finger of his wand hand which is also his wanking hand. He didn’t think for one moment about the possibility a random wizard would know the old pure-blood family crests. Trust nosy-parker Potter to have done his research.
“Then what is it?” Draco can feel the swell of Harry’s cock, heavy against his thigh. “You definitely like it.”
“Was it expensive?” Harry doesn’t sound like he cares, his mouth pressed against Draco’s neck and his breathing ragged.
“Yeah.” Harry’s body responds to Draco’s proximity, the closeness making him dizzy. He itches to put his hands on Draco’s slim hips, to pull him close and enjoy the burn of his kisses again. He wonders what Draco would say if he asked to be taken, right here, right now. “Ginny gave me some fancy gifts when she got her first payment from the Harpies. It’s from Liberty’s. I liked it so much I’ve used it ever since.”
“Shut up!” Harry’s anger gathers inside his chest, a white-hot rage that leaves him breathless. “Don’t twist it all around. That’s not what it was. We were never
“So what?” Harry glances across at a young man who gives him a saucy wink. With a jolt, Harry turns away without so much as a second glance. “Auror.”
“Mmm.” Draco makes a noncommittal sound. “I had my suspicions you know. No idea why. Wishful thinking, perhaps.”
“I’m here with him.” Harry gestures towards Draco when there’s an expectant lull in conversation. “With, err. Malfoy. I’m not here to cause any trouble. I’m not with the Aurors anymore.”
Harry drops onto the bed and props himself over Draco. He gives him a slow kiss, before grabbing his clothes and heading towards the bathroom. It gives Draco the opportunity to have a good ogle at Harry’s naked backside which is just as appealing as the rest of him.
“It’s the way they make you ashamed, like you have to hide—” Hermione stops, her expression fierce. “It’s more than losing a job, it’s
“You seem very invested in this garden of yours.” Draco moves behind Harry, placing his hands on either side of Harry and brushing his lips to Harry’s neck. “Which is a shame, because I was going to ask you if you wanted to come and not watch a film at my house later.”
“I know.” Draco tears off some of the piping hot bread in a basket next to Harry and uses it to gather some of the juices on his plate. “I don’t eat like this every night, before you start making assumptions.”
Harry slips off his robes before sitting, thankful he had time to put on nice jeans and a jumper underneath before he left the house.
Harry really doesn’t want to have this conversation in a small, cosy tearoom. He just wants to find out if Ginny’s going to dump him for not proposing. He couldn’t care less about Draco with his fancy slippers and strange art when he’s out here in the middle of nowhere, still buzzing from a brilliant flight.
“I’m used to it.” Draco shrugs. He gives Harry a wry smile. “Besides, I haven’t been with many hand-holding types. Just you.”
“I did, to a point.” Draco shrugs. “I tend to attract men who enjoy topping and it’s not as though I don’t find it pleasurable.”
“That’ll be nice.” Hermione relaxes, seemingly satisfied with Harry’s response. “I never thought I would miss this office, but I really think I’m going to.”
“It can do that,” Draco agrees. He thinks of the first conversation with Griffin and looks away from Harry’s steady gaze. He wishes he was better at knowing what Harry was thinking, when he gives Draco one of those unflinching looks. “I planned to live like a Muggle after the war.”
“I’m not telling you anything of the sort,” Kingsley scoffs. “Your personal life is none of my business. However, I don’t think making a formal commitment to Ginevra would do you any harm at all. You two seem happy and you said yourself, you’re not the sort of man to overthink things. Why delay the inevitable?”
“I don’t want to be in love with you still.” Harry’s voice is broken, and he pushes Draco’s open shirt off his shoulders, watching him shake it off completely and drop it on the floor. “I don’t.”
“I get it.” Harry pokes Draco in the side. “If I haven’t already been obvious enough, being fucked into the mattress by you is my new favourite thing. I’m more than happy to indulge you.”
“Me too.” Harry’s reluctant for the night to end but he needs to brief the Aurors on a new case in the morning. It’s important he’s alert, not drowning himself in coffee. “I’m not close enough to walk. We’ll need to find somewhere quiet so we can Apparate.”
“What an arsehole,” Harry blurts out. He’s a good mind to go to Paris and tell Lucius Malfoy that in person. He winces when Draco raises his eyebrows at him. “Sorry, but it’s a bloody awful thing to say.”
Harry studies the bars with their blacked-out windows and a shiver passes down his spine. Even though he's not fastidious about rules and regulations, he's been firmly on the right side of the law since the war. He had unshakable faith in the power of legislation to make a difference. Finding himself in this strange new place in the shadows of Knockturn Alley just by virtue of being gay sits uneasily with him. It heightens the creep of shame that still niggles at him on occasion before he chases it firmly away.
“Sod off, you don’t know a damn thing about it.” Draco rifles through the papers, his forehead etched in a frown. “Don’t try to compare my life to what you have with that pretty Weasley of yours. You couldn’t begin to understand what it’s like to try to meet someone when the law forces you to live in the shadows.”
“Okay. Have fun in the Brecon Beacons,” Harry adds. The light in the room dims and he finds himself speaking to a cold, empty fire.
The door closes behind Harry and he’s plunged into a sensory whirlwind. The room is darkly lit, but there are plenty of people inside and the floor shines and glints with the reflection from a huge mirror ball magically suspended in the air. Disco music hums and twists around them, the songs unrecognisable to Harry. He peers behind Draco who grouses over a small entrance fee which seems to be an unexpected levy—
“Thanks.” Harry gives Draco a small smile and takes a gulp of his tea. It’s perfectly warm and sugary. He has a bite of his toast, glancing at the folded paper. “Has it made it into the
“Getting better.” Draco’s expression softens into the first genuine smile of the evening. He turns to Harry, the flicker of happiness fading. “The irony is I only left because I wanted to make things better and I ending up making such a bloody mess of it all.”
“I know about Gin,” George whispers. “Nobody else does, but she told me.” He pulls back. “How are you getting on?”
“Really?” Harry snorts. “I can’t see that suiting you for one minute. Magic, Malfoy. It’s in your blood. Not in the bollocks way your old lot used to think about it, but because of
as punishment. I can’t imagine being gay is all that popular with Voldemort’s lot, if your own parents can’t get their heads around it. Don’t talk to me about my army. Things would be a lot worse if you’d had your way.”
“I couldn’t give a toss, Potter. Do you want to fuck me or don’t you?” Draco’s refractory period is usually a little longer, but from the desire that makes his body ache, he’s certain this is what he wants.
“I could make that coffee now.” Harry breaks the silence. His voice is low and soothing, like cool water on a burn. He catches Draco’s lips in a slow kiss and it’s inexplicably tender.
Ginny sniffles and scrubs her eyes with her hands. Her shoulders get tight and she stares at Harry. “When?”
“No.” Harry shakes his head. “We’re not engaged. Ginny isn’t interested in all that. She says she’s too young, and it would spoil her roast potatoes.” He laughs. “I think she was joking about the last part.”
Without sending a reply, Draco leaves his bedroom and makes his way downstairs to grind his coffee beans, determined to push Harry to the back of his mind once and for all.
Somewhere between paragraphs the writing gets blurred and Draco’s eyes grow heavy. After another few moments of struggling to read, he closes his book and curls closer to Harry.
“—I think you mean Pritchard.” Harry hides his smile behind a napkin. Pritchard does look a bit like a pilchard, now Draco mentions it.
, he thinks, as people congratulate him on his speech and tell him what a wonderful asset he is to the Ministry.
Draco nods his agreement. He’s so dizzy with the night and the sounds of Merlin’s Kitchen slowly filter back into his consciousness. The powerful vibrancy of the magic all around them ebbs away until the room feels like any other.
Harry huffs, sitting back on the sofa and folding his arms. It might not have been the most intimate of visits Harry’s ever had with Ginny, but it’s not like Harry needs sex every week—or even every month. He’s not that fussed about sex—despite what his wanking habits may suggest. It’s another reason he and Ginny are compatible. They laughed loads and went flying every day. Malfoy doesn’t know what the fuck he’s talking about.
“You had your cock in my arse half an hour ago,” Draco points out. He’s enjoying seeing Harry squirm. “That seems more intimate.”
“I’ve been thinking a lot about your peculiar ways.” Draco moves closer to Harry, giving him a look that chases Harry’s breath from his lungs.
Harry can never be fully relaxed with Draco in public. Even if he took the enormous step of leaving the Aurors voluntarily, the same would still be true. Any public intimacy whatsoever could lead to either one of them being arrested as long as they’re in the wizarding world. Harry is unlikely to be locked up for long, if at all, but Draco has a very different history. Without Harry at the Ministry his sanctions could be worse.
“As if I would.” Harry’s breath hitches, Draco’s implication pretty clear despite his evasiveness. “I thought you didn’t like it?”
Ginny shrugs, the movement sending ash into the room. “I thought you were checking in on him, to make sure he’s okay after Azkaban.”
“Oh.” Harry isn’t sure he’s ever met anyone that doesn’t care about marriage, apart from Ginny who flinches at the mention of it. Molly’s always on at him to pop the question and even Hermione dropped hints the other day about how nice a ruby ring would look with Ginny’s hair. “Even if you were allowed to?”
“It’s fine, Harry. Shush, it’s fine. Oh darling.” Hermione sounds like she’s crying too, her arms tightening around Harry. “It’s going to be okay, we’ll speak to Robards.”
Harry, when he spent most of his time professing how much he loathed him. Still, he’s had a long, hot summer and the benefit of hindsight to realise he might have protested a little too much. Nobody in Draco’s life has ever challenged him quite the way Harry has. The one upside to chatting to Harry through an anonymous dating service is that Draco can at least be honest about it on Quick-Match. He can say things to Griffin he’s not sure he would ever be able to say to Harry’s face.
“Yeah. Until tomorrow.” Harry takes Draco’s offered hand and holds on for a beat too long. “Hey, Malfoy?”
“It’s different now. Everything’s different.” Draco pauses. “You’re a good man, someone who possesses the kind of courage I’m not sure I’ll ever have.”
“You weren’t far off,” Harry mutters. “I came to Paris to talk to you, after the photos came out in the
.” Draco’s hand tangles in Harry’s hair as he makes his way down Draco’s body. He unbuckles Draco’s belt and pushes his trousers and pants down to his thighs, finding Draco hard and leaking.
“I don’t think he’s going to thank me for anything,” Harry replies quickly. The thought of going somewhere like that with Draco sends his heart racing. “He blames me for being in prison in the first place.” He pauses, his brow furrowing. “Who’s Millie?”
“Me too,” Harry says, sincerely. “I don’t think he’ll be in any rush to go back to Azkaban, that’s for sure.”
“Liar.” Harry yanks off his glasses and leaves them on the side. He moves towards Draco, crowding into his space until he’s backed against the kitchen counter. “You didn’t just come here for conversation.”
.” The book flies from his shelf into his outstretched hand and he opens it up, glancing out of the window where the cool, crisp bright of the afternoon filters softly into the room.
With a growl of annoyance, Draco turns on the shower to wash away the sleaziness of it all. He shoves his head under the steady stream of water, relieved that the noise calms the vibrations from his Quick-Match Quill.
“That, and other things.” Draco frowns, considering his words carefully. “It’s taken me a year away to realise those are my issue, not yours. I can’t change the fact that you made good choices and I made bad ones, no more than I can alter the things I was raised to believe as a child and the shame that caused. I need to focus on the choices I’m making now, as an adult.”
Harry’s taken back to the day in Draco’s study when his insides twisted and rolled, his desire to be close to Draco and his unshakable curiosity leading him back to the Manor. He recalls the way Draco looked at him then, the expectation that Harry would judge him for his personal life. It seems like so long ago. It’s hard to believe how much has changed in such a short space of time.
“I can’t believe it.” Ginny’s cheeks turn red and she shakes her head. “How on earth does Hermione get away with it and not you?”
“I was wondering about telling the boys,” Ginny says. “George knows of course, but I thought I might tell Ron. Perhaps Charlie and Bill. I don’t know about Percy, he’s a right Snidget about things sometimes.”
“No.” Harry laughs, brushing his lips to Draco’s neck before moving away again. “I can think of better things to look at during sex than Percy doing the Thestral Hop.”
Harry had always imagined Draco’s reformed character was driven by necessity as much as anything. Being in the Muggle world and finding acceptance there was bound to alter the views he used to hold about the superiority of wizards. Last night Harry realised for the first time that Draco’s reasons for making alterations in his life go far beyond his experience as a gay man. Draco’s grown up, pure and simple. For all the posh clothes, snarky remarks and the way he continues to lord it over people sometimes—he’s not had a complete personality transplant—Draco Malfoy in his thirties is a world away from the spiteful, entitled teenager Harry remembers from Hogwarts.
“I dunno.” Ginny shrugs. She waits for their food to be placed down in front of them, before smearing one of her scones with lashings of clotted cream and jam. “They’re so fusty, those laws of yours.”
“How typical that your mind would go straight to pornography.” Draco gathers his excess soup on another piece of bread. “I suppose you won’t believe me if I tell you I like arthouse cinema?”
“Do you use it?” Draco tries to feign surprise and isn’t sure he manages it. He’s tired. Very, very tired of pretending. “I can’t imagine the great Harry Potter needs a matchmaking service.”
“Bars, clubs, drag nights, music, saunas. All sorts. It’s all much more open in the Muggle world. I imagine it was far harder when it was illegal in the Muggle world, too, but even then people managed, wizards and Muggles alike. We’ve been here all the time.”
“Liar.” Draco looks Harry up and down, the warmth behind his eyes unmistakable. He holds up a bottle. “I brought wine.”
Harry pulls a face. “No. He didn’t think it would be right, with Molly and Arthur expected. He’s still not sure he would be welcome, plus half the bleeding Ministry are here.”
“Well.” Harry clears his throat, rooting around in his pocket. Part of him wants to Apparate away, panic welling in his chest.
“Yeah.” Ginny smiles, her face lighting up. “Doesn’t she just? She wants to talk to you later. Something about a protest. She made badges.”
“So brave,” Draco taunts. Despite his tone a flicker of surprise and uncertainty crosses his face, his lips twisting as if he’s fighting a battle within himself. “So
“They’re very enthusiastic.” Kingsley laughs under his breath. He clears his throat, something obviously on his mind. “There was one thing I wanted to raise with you.”
“Someone?” Draco sounds surprised and intrigued. He seems to have shaken off his earlier malaise and he props himself up on his elbow, watching Harry.
Harry goes to the bathroom and cleans his teeth, splashing water on his heated face. When he gets back into the bedroom, Draco is under the duvet, blinking at the ceiling. Harry gets into bed, the quiet in the room both awkward and not. It seems weird cuddling up to Draco the way he would with Ginny, so he props himself up on his elbow and looks down at Draco, whose eyes are closed.
Harry tries to cheer up, but his mind keeps returning to his conversation with Kingsley and the claustrophobia that comes with trying to breathe underwater. As much as he appreciates the new, buoyant quality the night has taken on, he hates the idea of leaving one lie behind to dive straight into another. He’s always prided himself on being forthright with people. He closes his eyes and swallows, the oppressive weight of staring into an uncertain future pulling him down once more. The options clamour together in his head, each one screaming out for attention. Part of him thinks he should get out of the Ministry and fight for what’s right, but he’s always believed that change is best accomplished from the inside.
“You sound just like McGonagall.” Harry grins. “I thought she was going to have kittens. I decided it was best not to mention I was flying a Hippogriff at the time.”
As Draco moves onto the bed, the hot silence gathers between them, and Harry is so ready for something, anything. He pulls Draco over him and kisses him soundly, sliding his hands down Draco’s back and pressing his fingers against Draco’s hot skin.
“I don’t.” Harry cuts Draco off before he can finish his sentence. “I want you to get whatever you want to say off your chest and then you can piss off and let me go back to bed.”
“You’d be surprised. Your involvement was the only thing that stopped father from throwing me out of the house immediately. He’s remarkably deferential to Aurors these days.” A hint of wry amusement creeps into Draco’s voice. “I might have given him the impression you were just a Port-Key away, ready to come bounding to my defence like a lion cub.”
“Rumour has it wrong. Malfoy here can tell you that.” Harry shakes Flint’s hand and winks at him. “A handshake doesn’t mean I won’t enjoy beating you at Quidditch again if an opportunity arises.”
The first breach of Harry’s finger is so good, Draco tugs his bottom lip between his teeth to avoid crying out. He doesn’t give a Kneazle’s whisker about being loud, but there’s still a small part of him that would prefer not to give Potter the satisfaction. With a sigh of pleasure, Draco lets the new sensations overwhelm him. It's no more intimate than the way Harry sucks and kisses Draco’s cock, leaving it slick with saliva. It's strange at first but not unpleasant. To the contrary, Harry clearly knows what he's doing, reaching nerve endings Draco didn't even know existed.
The shoulders of Harry’s colleagues begin to press against him, elbows digging into his belly, arms digging into his chest. A dizziness overcomes him as one, singular thought stands louder than all others.
as he puts it, but he’s alright. He probably shouldn’t shag anyone—witch or wizard—in the middle of a Muggle park, but I don’t care that he’s gay. Not at all. It’s not for me to say what’s normal and what isn’t. Not doing anyone else any harm, is it?”
“Okay?” Draco sounds slightly uncertain and Harry wonders if for all Draco’s posturing, this is something he hasn’t done before. Something that, like Harry, he’s fantasised about but never had the person to try it with.
Draco does as requested, sliding back and then pushing into Harry again. The stretch and burn dulls but there’s still something so intense about being fucked in this way. It’s like nothing Harry’s experienced before but as he gets used to the initially strange sensation he begins focusing on the pleasure. A hot, hungry force gathers and burns within him and his need becomes an ache that goes far deeper than simple desire. Harry is glad it’s Draco, doing this. Glad it’s someone that will stay in the bed with him after, kissing and talking through the night.
“Thanks.” Harry grins. He sobers and considers Millie’s suggestion that Harry’s interest in Draco might not be a one-way thing. “He’s been doing this for so long and I’ve got no idea what’s going to happen. If things go to shit he won’t want another mess when he’s just got over his own. The timing is all fucked up. If I had a year to get used to it—”
Ginny breaks off mid-flow and gives Harry an anxious look. “We don’t have to do any of that, of course. We could just stay here.”
“I have zero interest in rooting through piles of your underpants—” Draco glares at Harry, stopping mid-sentence. “Why did you clean your room?”
“Obviously not,” Harry replies, tightly. There’s something so illicit about the idea of going to a gay bar. A gay bar in Knockturn Alley, of all places. Confusion and guilt mingle with an unmistakable thrum of excitement he hasn’t felt in a very long time. “We do my thing first. Beer and kebabs.”
“I just want you to be happy,” Kingsley replies. His voice is gruff. “It’s the very least you deserve after everything you’ve done for the rest of us. Don’t choose a path that’s going to make things difficult for you.”
Harry doesn’t need telling twice, taking off his joggers and pants quickly enough that it’s a wonder he doesn’t knee Draco in the stomach. His eagerness seems to amuse Draco, but Harry really doesn’t give a fuck. Maybe someone who’s horny as fuck and quite happy to let Draco
Harry nods. “We’re saying there was no authority to arrest you because you were in a Muggle park. The conviction should be completely quashed, and you’ll be released as soon as the papers are processed.”
Eventually they reach Draco’s spot on the south coast, miles and miles away from London. With unspoiled beaches and cresting waves, flying close to salt-spray and surging headlong into the coastal winds reminds Harry of his trips out to Azkaban. They find an inconspicuous spot to land and walk together into a nearby village where they eat delicious, hot pasties for lunch and have two piping mugs of hot chocolate each. When they get back to a secluded part of the beach, they kick off again and speed through the air. It’s the furthest Harry’s flown in a long time and by the time they get back to Grimmauld Place, they’re both exhausted.
, there are some risks worth taking. The fact that Draco’s willing—at last—to take that chance too makes his body warm. “What do you want from me? No jokes, no lies. Just the truth.”
“Thank you for asking, but no.” Draco glares at her, and Harry stifles a laugh. “This and that. I haven’t decided yet.”
“Yes.” Draco sits back in his chair and rubs his eyes. He was so engrossed in his book, the story combined with the warmth of the heating charms almost led him to forget where he was. “Not that you strike me as the sort to care about interrupting people.”
insinuating himself into my personal business, I might as well find other ways to entertain myself.” He lifts his napkin to his lips and dabs them. “To take the edge off.”
It's not the night for tenderness or slow lovemaking. Harry chases his orgasm and knows Draco is doing the same. His fingers drag down the wall as Draco fucks him and with every thrust, he grunts and pushes back for more, deeper, harder, faster. He palms his own cock until Draco pushes his hand away and brings him to a bone-shaking completion.
At the same time, it’s an anti-climactic moment. Harry can’t reach across to squeeze Draco’s hand, or thank him for trying to protect Harry from his own unflinching honesty. He can’t slide an arm across the back of the seat and lean close to Draco, whispering something that’s just for them. The realisation that even after sharing his secret with his friends, he still can’t be openly affectionate with Draco settles heavily on Harry.
“You haven’t?” Harry had assumed this was Draco’s place, a bit like putting on mood music or lighting some candles. If he had a massive bed and cinema room, he’d probably use it to have sex in too. “I thought it was somewhere you used. With other blokes.”
“I know.” Draco moves from the window at last, sitting back on the sofa. He crosses his legs and stares at the fire, not looking at Harry. “But I didn’t want you to come to Paris—”
. He knows and he’s still here, hard, wanting and not running off back to Hogwarts. All the times Draco refused to let himself hope come spinning back to him. Sinking to his knees is almost an act of reverence, his mouth eagerly seeking out Harry’s cock, determined to bring him to the height of pleasure. His heart sings and it seems as though Harry’s magic swells through the room. Draco has learned the art of magical empathy over six long years of training. He can feel every tick and hum of a wand, every flicker and pulse of magic. He usually needs to hold the wand, to try to gauge its mood, its core, its soul. With Harry, he just needs hot fingers pressed against damp, sweaty skin. The magic fills the room, every quiver and shake of it, the steady, solid heartbeat of Harry Potter’s magic occupying every corner of the shop.
“If you’re worried about security, confiscating wands would be a far better idea than searching us,” Draco says.
“Don’t be obtuse.” Merlin’s Kitchen is excessively shit and nobody in their right mind would buy a property above a nightclub. Draco can’t imagine Potter without outdoor space.
The room is full of Harry, and Draco realises that he’s experiencing more than just the thrum of music from the club below. There’s an undercurrent of magic that fills the bedroom that has the same familiar energy as the living room before it. The magic just exists in the whole space with such assured ease that it must be why Draco didn’t notice it immediately. It’s only now, with Harry’s rising pleasure that Draco picks up on its fizzes, whips and cracks, the shimmer of light in the corner of the room, the way wards flex and spin, the twists and the turns.
“I’m right about a lot of things.” Draco keeps his eyes carefully trained on their surroundings. “Can we go home? I’m sick of not kissing you too. I’d blow you in the toilets if I thought we’d get away with it, but that Auror twink definitely has his eye on you.”
“Are you back for good?” Draco stops himself from pointing out that not caring about the opinion of strangers is probably easier when most of them just want to get your signature on a sweaty beermat.
“You’re so enlightened all of a sudden.” Draco’s tone is teasing and the glum mood in the room lightens. “It probably helps your girlfriend turned out to be a lesbian.”
You want him to get on his knees and suck you off, don’t you? Right there, with half your clothes on because you can’t wait to get upstairs.
“I see.” Draco’s voice is icy. “I don’t mean to be indelicate Potter, but don’t you think it would be better to find comfort in the living rather than the dead?”
Ginny considers the question. “I don’t want to tell them. Not yet. I’m happy here with the Harpies and Millie. Mum’s always so
A sensible man would have closed the conversation and never spoken to Griffin again. Either that, or they would have revealed their own identity at once. Unfortunately, Draco is not a sensible man which is why he’s been chatting to Griffin, daily, ever since. Convincing himself he hates Harry is becoming harder by the second which makes the whole debacle even more wretched. Griffin—
Harry stops in his tracks when he sees Draco. His relaxed expression shifts into something intense and hungry. “You found some joggers.”
“In part. Because of Azkaban, too.” Draco looks at Harry, his face pale. “They want me in prison. Me, more than most. You know that as well as I do. It’s not as though I need to be caught
When Draco doesn’t respond, Harry opens his trousers and shoves them down. He wraps his hand around Draco and falls back against the wall with a thud, sucking in a breath when Draco strokes him just so. He rubs his thumb over the thick, blunt head of Draco’s cock and arousal pulses through him at the thought of taking it inside his body. He doesn’t have much experience with cocks, but he knows he likes the way Draco’s feels in his hand.
“I can see out, but nobody else can see in.” Harry moves behind Draco, his breath warm on the back of Draco’s neck. “The light comes through them, just like normal windows. I can’t open them, mind. There are skylights to let some air in when the weather’s nice.”
.” Draco lets out a long-suffering sigh. “I’ve been dying to know what Harry Potter thinks about when he’s getting himself off.”
“Yeah, it’s my room.” Harry watches Draco poke around, the nosy fucker. “I told you I needed some interior design tips. Maybe you can recommend some fancy art, so I can take old Walburga down. I put her in the room at the back that never gets used, but I still know she’s there. She doesn’t half give me the creeps.”
Not noticing anything strange, Ginny nods. “Yes, that’s the one. Harry does the pub quiz with George and Lee, don’t you Harry?”
Draco doesn’t need asking twice. He moves his hand from Harry’s hair, muttering another lubricating charm. He wraps a slick hand around Harry’s cock and thrusts into him. He takes his time, using Harry’s body to give himself every last bit of pleasure. He makes sure Harry doesn’t come, getting the position just right but making sure it doesn’t take him over the edge.
Harry thinks about Draco on his knees in cruising spots. He wonders what sex has really been like for him, if he’s just assumed a role other people decided suited him. From the little Harry can gather, many of Draco’s sexual encounters have taken place in the shadows and cracks of the city. When people disguise themselves as potential partners and then chuck you in prison when you show interest in doing anything sexual, it’s bound to make a person cautious about sharing their desires. He recalls the anger in Draco’s voice when he turned the tables on Harry in the Manor, and wonders if Draco expects him to want to do things a certain way because it’s what he’s always been used to.
Harry shoves Draco back against the wall and Draco goes easily, his back landing with a thud on the damp bricks and his breath leaving him in a huff. Harry never wants the kiss to end, never wants to break this moment where the rest of the world fades away into oblivion. He chases away the voices that crescendo in his head—
“Did you stay because of my owl?” Harry’s stomach rolls at the idea that his desperate attempt to get a response from Draco might have been the final nail in the coffin. “I only sent it because I didn’t know what else to do. I hoped you might respond, but you never did.”
When he gets downstairs Harry is wrangling with his magical coffee machine and digging around in the cupboards. His hair is damp from the shower and Draco takes a moment to appreciate the lean lines of his body and the curve of his backside.
“I got your usual.” George stands and gives Harry a quick handshake, sliding in next to Lee to give Harry the seat next to Draco.
“Honestly, I’ve always thought Parkinson was a bit of a twat.” A fierce protectiveness takes up residence in Harry’s chest. “She doesn’t know what she’s missing out on.”
Harry holds Draco’s gaze for as long as he can. When Draco catches his lips in a heart-stopping kiss, Harry closes his eyes, gives into the moment and imagines he’s opening his arms and soaring through the air.
“Splendid, thanks so much for asking.” Draco definitely sounds like he’s smiling now, and it gives Harry a little thrill to know he’s lightened the mood between them.
Harry steps back and leans against the wall next to Draco. He folds his arms, avoiding meeting the young Auror’s eyes again.
“It became difficult for him at times, a single man living the life of a confirmed bachelor with connections to known homosexuals.” Kingsley waves a hand. “It was never anything more than hearsay but when people sought to remove Albus from his office, they offered a highly persuasive argument that he wasn’t fit to hold his position as a guardian of young children on account of his rumoured preference for other wizards.”
“If he can put up with us all for long enough.” Ginny retrieves a couple of packets from her rucksack. “He’s certainly not flying back to Wiltshire or trying to Apparate after one of my Hungarian Horntail cocktails. We brought eggs and bacon for breakfast. We got them from a farm in Abercynllaith, the bread and butter too.”
“I don’t know.” Harry stands, awkward and so utterly charming it eases Draco’s bad mood. “I should go.”
“Erm,” Harry says. His eyes have that hazy look about them and he can’t seem to stop watching Draco stroking him, the head of his cock poking out of Draco’s fist. “What?”
“You do that.” Hermione glances at Harry. “I wanted to let you know I’ve applied for a secondment to the Magical Congress. It’s a six-month placement. After that, me and Ron should be able to settle back here for good.”
“I haven’t spent that long on a broom in ages.” Harry stretches his aching limbs with a laugh. “Now I know why.”
“You can’t tell anyone.” Ginny’s face is flushed, tears running down her cheeks. She clutches Harry’s arm tight enough to bruise. “I know you think it’s awful—
“I’ve been trying to work up to a big reveal all week,” Harry continues. “It’s why I went to the shop on Friday, but you were closed for lunch. Not that there’s much revealing left to do.” He smirks and gives Draco’s crotch a pointed look.
“Don’t be daft. I’m fine,” Harry lies. “I’m not calling for sympathy. Kingsley reckons they’ll keep it hush-hush so the press don’t get wind, but Robards is going to have to tell Ron why they got rid of me. He still thinks we’re together. Everyone does,” he finishes miserably.
“I didn’t want to hide. I never wanted that.” The fury rolls off Harry, crashing over him in waves. “I hated sneaking around, pretending to go our separate ways after work and dancing with everyone who asked at Ministry events because you couldn’t bear to be photographed too close to me.”
Millie squeezes Harry’s shoulder then slips inside and shuts the door quietly behind her. Harry watches her leave before tipping his head back and staring into the starry night.
Harry pulls on his boots and closes the door to the Manor behind him. He makes his way down the drive, the stones crunching beneath his feet.
Tucked away in a dimly lit passage at the arse end of Diagon Alley, Merlin’s Kitchen is unquestionably the worst nightclub Draco has ever been to. Because nobody bothers to update the lighting charms, the neon sign outside winks at punters like a sleazy date. The hurriedly erected metal barriers and disorderly brickwork suggest the club was put together with all the finesse of a drunken Troll. Inside is even worse, with sticky floors, the scent of piss that wafts across the booth closest to the loos and the tangle of people at the perpetually crowded bar. The name, which Draco supposes is meant to be quaint, reflects the fact Merlin’s Kitchen is guaranteed to be hot, sweaty and uncomfortable, even on the coldest nights.
? Kingsley’s comments are strangely settling, the revelation sending a burst of hope through Harry that clamours uneasily with his fear and shame. It makes him think about his conversation with Draco about the Thestrals. It offers him a strange sort of comfort as he recalls Dumbledore’s kind smile and the way he always encouraged Harry to forge his own path and have faith in his convictions. Harry shakes himself from his thoughts, aware Kingsley is waiting for a response.
“Did something bad happen?” Harry’s stomach rolls, the thought of someone doing anything to Draco filling him with sadness and rage.
“Mmph.” Harry swallows, his throat bobbing. At last Draco feels as though he’s got the upper hand back. “After we can—when—err—
humility, but he can’t deny that the sense he’s about to get a lecture from Potter rankles. Any flicker of pleasure he gained from being trusted with precious Harry Potter’s wand disappears entirely.
“Oh.” Draco sips his coffee, wincing as it burns his throat. “I didn’t know Puffskeins could write letters.”
of breath, relief coursing through him. He sits back and blinks at the wall, his thoughts spiralling. “I didn’t mean to push so hard. I just wanted to stop lying. Ron knows there was something going on with us, and Hermione too. I haven’t said anything explicitly, but they’d have been blind not to see it. They asked me about it, loads of times.”
“Yeah, all that self-flagellation sounds brilliant.” Harry shifts closer to Draco, watching him stare at the blank television screen. It seems like he’s going to clam up once more, but after a momentary pause he carries on talking.
Draco responds by quickening the pace of his hand, using his free hand to squeeze the fleshy globe of Harry’s arse. He digs his fingers in—hard—and it makes Harry shudder with pleasure. Their kisses get more uncoordinated, punctuated by every bite and whisper. It doesn’t take much time for Harry’s orgasm to knife through him, a searing pulse of pleasure. The heat of his climax ebbs away as Draco jerks back from the kiss to catch his breath, spilling over Harry’s fist. Not caring about the come on his fingers, Harry pushes his messy hand into Draco’s hair and urges him into another kiss. They stay like that for a long time, touching one another with warm, sticky hands until the kisses lose their urgency.
“Yes,” Draco agrees. He gives Harry one last, long look, and then moves away entirely. “I think you are.”
“Evening, Head Auror Potter.” Lee winks at Harry. “Very official looking this evening. Not planning to arrest Malfoy again, are you?”
“It’ll be even funnier when you show me your porn.” Harry grins, resting the back of his head on his hands. “I’ve been dying to know what you watch.”
“Yes. In a minute.” Draco moves his fingers down Harry’s stomach, drinking in the heat of his skin and the damp beads of sweat. He wants to taste every inch of Harry’s body and determines to do so before the weekend finishes. He circles his fingers around Harry’s cock and gives him a slow stroke. “Do you want a hand with this?”
about it, according to father. It’s been around since the eighteen-hundreds, although it went through long periods of closure. It was boarded up at the height of the two wizarding wars. Too risky, I suppose. The Unspeakable is newer. A few years after the second war it sprung up out of nowhere in a spot that used to house an abandoned apothecary.”
, which inevitably turns into several bottles of overpriced Sancerre and getting sucked off in the loos by a Muggle who talks too loudly, smokes vile cigars and runs his own hedge fund in Mayfair. Draco barely remembers their names, despite the business cards he’s collected on the off chance he fancies being bored to death again. He should probably just
“Nothing.” Harry shakes his head. “I’m not sure I will, not now. He’s probably going to speak to Hermione and Ginny first. I need to speak to Arthur, Molly too. They’re bound to get wind that something’s up soon, with Arthur working at the Ministry.”
Draco shrugs off his blazer and hangs it next to Harry’s coat, revealing a silky blue patterned shirt. He doesn’t bother to take off his boots and the heels tap smartly against the wooden floor as he strides past Harry in slim-fitting trousers, heading for the kitchen. He looks like he’s going for an expensive dinner, not dropping in on a former lover unannounced.
After he’s scrubbed his skin sufficiently to remove the last remnants of Potter-related debauchery, Draco dries off and pulls a face at himself in the mirror before dressing. He looks decent, a bit more flushed than usual admittedly, but otherwise relatively unruffled. He makes sure his shirt is crisp and ironed to perfection and buttons up his waistcoat. He gives himself a last once-over to check there’s nothing in his outer appearance that reflects his inner turmoil. He made the mistake of scheduling a quick meeting with Harry to run a diagnostic spell on his wand, largely to check if his instincts are correct. The last thing he needs is for the ever astute Harry to pick up on the havoc his cock has been causing Draco of late.
Harry climaxes, sticky and wet inside Draco’s body. He slips out and the emptiness makes Draco groan, his own cock still hard, untouched and desperate for some kind of friction. He begins to wank himself off before his hand is covered by Harry’s and
. Imagine what that’ll do if it does ever come out. Those Ministry arseholes might not think much of it, but think of that young, gay wizard knowing he’s going to be alright because he’s just like Harry Potter.”
“What’s that?” Harry pokes at a mushroom vol-au-vent. He hates mushrooms. “Is Robards snogging Rosmerta again?”
“If you say so.” Harry casts a Cleaning Charm without a sound and grins when Draco’s breath falters. “Does that turn you on?”
“Does the idea of going to Knockturn make you uncomfortable?” Draco’s expression is unreadable, his gaze steady.
.” Draco traces one long finger down Harry’s chest, his voice low. “I’ve noticed how you’ve been looking at me since I arrived. Don’t be coy.”
“Thanks.” Harry and Hermione make their way upstairs and Hermione busies herself while Harry gets ready for bed. “Are you staying?”
Harry thinks back to Draco’s case, chewing his food thoughtfully. “You were arrested on a Thursday.”
“Brilliant.” Ron’s smile widens and he points to the dancefloor. “You should get out there instead of moping around here eating all the food.”
. Eventually, they go through the small arch and into the main space where Harry can take in everything properly.
He yanks Harry over him, kissing him with a fierce eagerness. He can taste the muskiness of his own sweat on Harry’s lips, the saltiness of pre-come. After a breathless moment, he puts his hands on Harry’s chest to push him back.
“Believe me, I understand what it’s like to lose everyone you’ve loved.” Draco’s voice is tense. “You’re not the only one who misses people. My family might not be dead, but they may as well be.”
Draco is about to remind Pansy as much when the atmosphere in the club shifts. The poppy beat of the music becomes less intense, and the people gathered on the dancefloor stop dancing. A steady hum of chatter gets louder and a group of Hufflepuffs next to Draco and Pansy begin to whisper urgently to one another.
It’s not that they harbour any ill will towards one another anymore, but they’re hardly friends. Even if the sharpness of past acrimony has softened, Harry still has the capacity to wind Draco up like nobody else can. To make matters a hundred times worse, he’s also handsome. His atrocious dress sense has improved over the years and in casual jeans and midnight blue jumper, with his shock of dark hair, distinctive green eyes and his firmly set jaw, Harry Potter is as depressingly attractive as anyone Draco has ever met. It’s a damned inconvenience.
“Cheers, Sirius.” Harry closes his eyes and swallows back the tears that threaten. “What would mum and dad say about all this? I reckon you’d know what to do.” His voice dips into a whisper, falters and breaks. “I wish you were here.”
“I’ll see what I can do.” Harry laughs. The conversation lulls and he takes a breath, deciding it’s better to be unburdened than to let his thoughts fester for too long. “Kingsley came to see me today. He wanted to warn me that people are talking about me taking a personal interest in Malfoy’s case.”
“Hullo.” Harry stands, putting his hands in his pockets and giving them both an awkward smile. “It was nice of you both to come tonight. Are you off, then?”
“I’m nothing of the sort,” Draco grouses. He sincerely hopes Zabini and Nott have had the good sense to secure an outside table and several bottles of something expensive.
.” Draco is starting to get a sense for what makes Harry tick, the softness of shared clothes and conversation after a shag and a shower, the care he wanted to take before using his fingers. He wants to see if he’s right. “Did you mean it?”
“Loads of places.” Harry holds up a hand to stop Draco from interrupting when he makes an aggravated
Draco doesn’t rummage or rifle. He doesn’t take long and he pulls back from Harry’s mind after no time at all. Without a word, he pushes Harry back against the wall and kisses him fiercely. Harry sinks into it, giving himself over to the moment. He yanks at the knot in Draco’s robe and lets himself be turned to face the wall. With a low groan, he presses his fingers against the stark white walls and Draco flicks his wand to vanish Harry’s clothes.
, Harry.” Ginny gives Harry a watery smile and the tension snaps out of his body, leaving him aching with relief. He’s so tired. So tired of fighting the desperate itch beneath his skin, of pushing back the questions in his mind.
“Doubt it.” Draco guides Harry towards the Floo. “Let’s go to mine, assuming you’ve seen enough for one night.”
“Very.” Harry contemplates Draco, as if he’s trying to work something out. “I always wanted to be an Auror, but after the war it was like a jacket that never fit right. No matter how much I kept adjusting it or trying to change things, I never felt comfortable in it. I hate what’s happening with my wand, but it gave me the push I needed to leave the Ministry.”
“I wish.” Harry shakes his head. “I can’t just make laws by myself. I’d have to lobby for the law to be changed and that wouldn’t exactly be discreet.”
“This.” Harry wets his lips and tugs at the knot in Draco’s robe, using it to pull Draco close. “Please fuck me. Just…fuck me.”
“I didn’t know.” Harry swallows, seeing Draco’s opulent cinema room in a whole new light. He thought it was a vanity project, somewhere for Draco to relax. He never considered it was connected to Astoria.
“I’m usually the receptive partner.” Draco takes a breath, his words oddly clinical. “Does that suit?”
“Yeah, they are.” Harry blinks at Draco. Heat crawls across Draco’s skin and he sincerely hopes the flush in his cheeks isn’t visible. “You’ve been paying attention.”
“Obviously.” Harry rolls his eyes. He watches Draco straighten and a warm tug of arousal curls in his belly. Draco in Quidditch leathers is really something. He clears his throat when Draco catches him staring. “I still reckon I’d beat you to the Snitch.”
“Because you left before I could. Pretty glad I didn’t to be honest. I’d have felt like even more of a knob when you fucked off to Paris.” Harry breathes out through his teeth, looking back down at the floor. His anger dissipates and he’s left sad and deflated. “Have you said everything you wanted to?”
“Your thoughts.” Harry stops stretching, shoves his hands in his pockets and shoots Draco a broad smile. “You stopped working on my wand ages ago.”
“Then why are we here?” Harry doesn’t look at the letter in front of him. He can’t. He’s sure his guilt is etched all over his face. He’s never been particularly good at hiding his emotions, despite his years of Auror training.
“I don’t know what the fuck you’re planning to do.” Draco snorts. “I didn’t think you’d try to get yourself off against my thigh, for a start. That was unexpected.”
“Ten points to Gryffindor.” Draco flicks his wand and Summons a bottle of booze. He uncorks it with a pop and drinks it straight from the bottle, handing it to Harry as he swipes the back of his hand across his mouth. “It’s illegal to be an openly gay Auror. As long as you’re in that job it’s a crime, whether you’re in public or private.”
“That’s not how they think.” The fact Harry was in a position of authority when the raids on Knockturn intensified sits uneasily with him. “Some might, but a lot of them are good men.”
“Not a problem,” Harry murmurs. His gaze flicks down to Draco’s lips. “This person from school, is this the one that you’ve been fantasising about? Some French bloke told me he’s great in bed.”
“Read what?” Nerves grip at Harry, fear building within him as he looks around, half expecting to see the
“I have somewhere to go. It’s fine. I won’t be alone.” Harry swallows and gives Molly and Arthur one last look. “Thank you. For everything. I’ve loved…loved being part of your family. I’m…I’m sorry I’m not the man you wanted me to be.”
Harry’s voice cracks and he clings to Hermione tight enough that it’s a wonder she doesn’t complain.
“I’ve got a new flat and everything.” Harry waves his hand towards the back of the club. “Upstairs.”
“Come on, you’re fine.” Lee laughs under his breath and urges Harry through the crowd to a table. “Most excitement we’ve had here in ages, people are bound to stare.”
“The rooms aren’t very tidy.” Harry hasn’t dusted properly for the last couple of weeks. He keeps his home nice as a rule, but cleaning’s been the last thing on his mind lately.
Draco rolls his eyes. “I’m trying to make conversation. As entertaining as it might be to sit here glaring at one another, I’m afraid it could get boring after a while.”
A flicker of surprise crosses Draco’s face. “I’m not interested in Weasley’s sloppy seconds.” He stands to the side, nevertheless, giving Harry a suspicious look as he pulls off his jacket and kicks off his shoes.
With a scowl, Draco hands over his outer robes and the entrance fee, watching his expensive cloak float across to a dusty Muggle clothing rail as the money
“I’ve seen Robards snogging Rosmerta after one Ogden’s too many, before he got all hoity-toity.” George winks. “Your secret’s safe with us.”
“Wilting,” Draco reiterates. He leans back on his desk and contemplates Harry. “It may surprise you to learn I’m not an idle gossip. I’m not about to go running to the
With a warm laugh, Harry gets back to the job at hand. He takes Draco in his mouth again and this time there’s no hesitation. It’s clear that Harry has a goal. It’s a welcome relief because Draco’s certain he would vastly prefer long, lazy hours of orgasmic bliss to being wound up until he’s ready to climb the walls.
“Pardon?” Draco holds his hand up when Harry begins to repeat himself. He got it the first time, he just…needs a minute.
“It’s getting late.” Draco reaches to check his watch. It feels like a dismissal, and Harry’s stomach drops. “You should stay,” Draco finishes.
“No idea.” Ginny swallows. “You’ve got to be careful, Harry. I’m in a little bubble here. Morgana and half the team are into other witches. It’s different for you. The Ministry, the Aurors. I can’t imagine they’d be sympathetic.”
,” the witch breathes. She clutches the beer mat bearing Harry’s untidy scribbles to her chest with a contented sigh. “Oh.” Her gaze lands on Draco and she frowns. “It’s you.”
“I’ll miss you too, but it’s not for long.” Hermione gives Harry a soft smile. “You and Ginny might have all sorts of news for us by the time we get back.”
Draco answers by closing the distance between them and sinking into another blissful kiss. The weight of the last few months of agonising over what he should do lifts from him, rising like a phoenix from the ashes and disappearing into the clouds. He opens his mouth eagerly to Harry, pressing against him and holding him close. As the kiss deepens, Draco shifts their positions, so Harry is the one with his back pressed against the bookcase. He catches Harry’s lips in a searing kiss, their tongues sliding together, slick, hot and urgent. With a groan of pleasure, Draco slides his hand underneath Harry’s jumper and finds the buckle of his belt. The movement makes Harry hiss and buck closer to Draco. There’s a rough urgency to every movement, the clink of metal and the way Harry drops his head back and gasps for breath.
For now, Harry’s keeping his head down and trying to focus on mending relationships with those closest to him, which is why he finds himself at The Burrow on a cold Friday evening.
“Oh yeah.” Harry gives Draco a strange look and then holds out his hand. “Call me Harry. Isn’t this Malfoy and Potter business getting a bit old?”
“I might as well have been, the way your lot treated me,” Draco replies. He stands, holding out his hand to take Harry’s wine from him. “Supper should be ready by now. I tend to eat late. Care to join me?”
“My own training center?” The idea gives Harry a small seedling of hope. “What if nobody bothers coming?”
“I promise.” Harry means it, too. Seeing Hermione and knowing she doesn’t think differently about him has settled him enormously. He knocks back her potion and exhaustion crashes over him. “Love you, ‘Mione.”
“Got it.” Anticipation thrums through Harry and he slicks his fingers, pushing Draco’s legs apart and adjusting his position for the best access.
Draco winces, because he can’t exactly answer that truthfully. He also can’t help but be insulted at being described as
“I’ve no intention of stopping.” Harry’s voice is thick with desire, and it sends a flash of pleasure through Draco. “This…plenty of men, you said.”
“You didn’t.” Draco gives Harry a firm look. “Any ultimatums were all in my head. No matter how eager you were to tell your friends, you were remarkably patient, considering.”
With a groan, Draco closes the Passion Parchment and ignores the vibrating Quick-Match Quill that suggests an onslaught of incoming messages.
“I thought we could go for a cream tea,” Ginny suggests. “I love hot scones with jam and clotted cream. It’s worth all the extra training to work off the cream.”
“Why do you think I’d want to go somewhere like that?” Harry’s heart thuds in his chest, his stomach churning.
“And when you find something that suits you, you keep it?” Draco gives Harry a slow, questioning smile.
Draco drops back on the bed and waits for the shower to start. The words he would never say out loud to Harry spin around his mind and he closes his eyes, a small smile tugging at his lips.
“Take it however you want.” Harry refuses to let Draco see how much he unsettles him. He tries to imagine Draco’s life after the war, taking another tiny sip of his drink. “I can’t imagine living like that. To be split down the middle, constantly watching your words and making up stories about places you went, things you did and people you met.”
“Morgana’s a lesbian and a Muggle-born.” Ginny gives Harry a sharp look. “Who the girls sleep with doesn’t impact their flying abilities. She doesn’t take kindly to people trying to spout pure-blood politics during practice.”
Harry dragged Draco to see Dumbledore’s portrait after getting permission from McGonagall to visit the school out of term time. She was a little surprised to see Draco, but she didn’t seem to give two hoots about what the
“Yeah.” Harry shuffles his feet awkwardly, fighting back the heat in his cheeks. He gets why Ron of all people thinks Harry’s gone mental. If the tables were turned and he found out Ron was getting off with Malfoy, Harry would probably think he was under the Imperius Curse. “I know it’s weird. Everything’s changed.”
The truth of it hits Draco like a hex. He really doesn’t have anyone better to do. No one comes close. He can tell the startled realisation is etched all over his face by the way Harry’s eyes narrow when he pulls back momentarily.
“No.” Draco gives Harry a humourless smile, his eyes flashing with something unreadable. “You’re going to make this as difficult as possible for me, aren’t you?”
“Queer?” Harry doesn’t say it with a spit and a hiss like some people do. He says it like it’s part of him. He opens his eyes, blinking at Draco. “Dunno. The press is bound to get wind of it eventually. I don’t care what strangers think about me.”
“I don’t know.” Harry shrugs. “I don’t want any unsolicited Evaporates, but it was fun, wasn’t it? I won’t be able to have overnight visitors at the school during term time and they’re also dead strict about when staff can stay elsewhere. I had to get permission from McGonagall for this weekend.”
He stops. His body begins to adjust to the unfamiliar sensation and it’s not quite so uncomfortable anymore. A desperate hunger crawls through him and he wriggles experimentally, pushing his arse back towards Draco.
“Were you fucking me around?” A hot wave of jealousy rolls over Harry and he curls his hands into tight balls, his stomach in knots. The idea that Draco might have found someone else occurred to him countless times, the images conjured by the society pages leaving him nauseous. “You had a better social life in Paris than England, by the looks of things.”
“Shut up, will you.” Exasperated, Harry removes his glasses and cleans them on his jumper. The sight of him without them makes Draco’s breath catch because there’s something so intimate about it. He remembers Griffin complaining about glasses getting in the way of things and another flush of heat warms his skin as his thoughts travel to other, unwelcome places. “I’d be a right idiot if I didn’t reinforce the need to keep this confidential. Not because you’re—well,
“Does this mystery man have a name?” Part of Draco wants to hear Harry say it because there’s part of him that still doesn’t believe he has the power to make Harry look so unabashedly happy.
