“I’m sorry,” he said expressionlessly. “May I ask you a question?” “Of course,” Harry said, turning to face him.
Then he blinked. Swallowed hard. Laughed out loud. Draco felt lighter than he had in years. He would burn the others tomorrow, he promised himself. For now, he was going to enjoy his party.
Draco recoiled. “You—you’re—”
“We’re here, and Gregs,” the third man answered. “What’s going on?”
They came at last to a sturdy wooden door set into the wall, which had turned from wood paneling to stone at some point. Harry watched as the woman carefully unlocked the door using the key around her neck. As she opened the door and entered, he slipped in after her.
Suddenly, Lucius started, looked around with overexaggerated confusion. “Oh my! Where oh
He had been counting silently in his head ever since Kingsley had dragged him out of the flat he’d shared with Harry.
Now he didn’t even have the comfort of knowing that his work as an Auror was helping keep the world safe. He had all but quit that job because it felt like too much.
Draco closed his eyes and started counting down from one thousand. Again.
“Shut up!” shouted the second man, and Draco fell silent. “If you’re not going to tell us anything useful, we’ll do the talking and you can just listen. Yes,” he crooned, stepping up to Draco and running a finger down Draco’s pale cheek. “You’ll listen like the obedient little pet you are, or I’ll put something else in your mouth. Something even bigger...”
, I know the general idea. I just didn’t think it customary to date someone when all you’re really interested in doing is shagging them.”
watch my tone with you.”
A thought struck Harry. “Ron,” he said, turning to his friend. “Have any Aurors been reassigned or fired from Azkaban recently? I imagine if Lucius was sending post on someone’s watch, they would have been reassigned at least, if not outright sacked.”
He hung up quickly and stared at the phone for a long moment. “
“Draco Malfoy?”
. Could they mean Malfoy? He pressed his ear even more firmly against the wooden door, but just then another crowd of people entered the hall, talking and laughing loudly, and the man’s response was lost in the noise. Harry cursed silently to himself and stepped back from the door. Just in time: it opened suddenly and a man exited, pulling on a jacket and heading towards the exit. A woman followed him more slowly. She seemed deep in thought as she closed and locked the door behind her with a delicate silver key. Then she moved farther into the Manor, fingering another key hanging on a chain around her neck.
“Shit, Malfoy, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean…”
“How does it feel, to be back in England?” Harry said finally, a little awkward as they walked down the stairs.
“Of course, the castle might hold unpleasant memories for you, given the events of your seventh year there,” he said, each word heavy with meaning. “How do you think you’ll—”
, he reflected wryly, pushing himself into a seated position. His head protested again.
Harry left him there, sitting and looking at the misty water, a small smile on his face.
The grove was huge, a spreading circular building meant to mimic the traditional woodland groves of old. Harry knew it was even bigger inside, but despite this there seemed to be hundreds of people standing outside, waving and calling to him. Some were holding up signs that hollered things like: “We love you, Harry Potter!” “Harry Potter, marry ME!” “Harry is our hero.” As the carriage bumped its way through the throngs of people, Harry felt like he was swimming against the ocean’s current, waves of sound crashing over him again and again. Several flashbulbs went off all at once and he saw Rita Skeeter’s sickly smile as he passed. He hoped suddenly, fervently, that he wouldn’t faint, then chuckled at himself. He had faced dementors, Death Eaters, the Dark Lord himself – but this wedding was threatening to undo him. He wished everyone would stop
“You misunderstand,” Lucius interrupted smoothly. “I don’t want to know what you say. I want to know
, at least until I know what this is about.”
There was a brisk knock at the door and Draco started back violently. “Occupied,” he said automatically, his fists clenching. How long had he been sitting here? Harry was probably looking for him. Trying to breath past the panic building in his chest, Draco stood up quickly and shoved the letter into an inner pocket in his robes. He took one more look at himself in the mirror, smiled (guiltily, his traitorous mind supplied), grimaced, and yanked the door open.
Or somewhat true, he supposed.
, I have a clue to where Draco might be,” Harry said grimly. “What if this portal only works for limited windows of time? I have to find out where it leads.” He met her eyes. “I’ll never forgive myself if I don’t.”
“I answer those letters in my office because I thought you didn’t like thinking about the Ministry,” Harry said with a small laugh. “I was trying to help you feel more comfortable.”
and laughing at Draco’s snide remarks on the Seeker’s form. They hadn’t talked much about the events of the past few days. Harry was relishing just being near Draco, and Draco seemed to feel the same way, although Harry had caught Draco watching him a few times with a sort of sad, calculating expression. They would have to talk soon, Harry knew.
“What?” Ron asked, taking the paper from him. He read it, and Harry watched the other man’s eyes widen. “Malfoy’s Trace?”
. Not one single fact, however innocuous, would pass his lips about Harry while he drew breath. Draco had never been brave, he knew that about himself. He had always prioritized his own safety, and the safety of his family, over the rest of the world or any sort of morality. That was why he was such a terrible person, and why Harry was probably relieved to be rid of him. But that was also why he would not say anything, because his own safety was gone, finished, probably forever, but his family –
, Harry thought in horror. He watched as the three men hurried up the stairs, wondering if he should follow them. Then he looked back at Draco. He couldn’t leave, not when he had just found him.
Harry looked at him, a question in his eyes, but Draco put his hands in his lap and looked down, not saying anything more. After a moment, Harry picked up his fork and pushed more rice onto his plate. “You and your mother, both,” he said quietly. “I’m alive now thanks to two of the three Malfoys.” He chuckled, taking another bite. “Fancy that.”
“Always a pleasure to serve you,” she said, directing her face to Harry even though her words were clearly meant for Draco. “That will be five galleons, please.”
“Is everything ok, Hermione?”
He was scanning the prisoner’s faces, feeling sickened but looking for Draco.
Harry was still very weak from blood loss and residual spell damage, but the next time Hermione came to visit, she brought Ron, Neville, Luna, and Ginny along with her.
“No,” Draco gasped. “No, he won’t. I won’t let him die. You—you
“We’ll have the place to ourselves,” he said, getting to his feet. “Come on.”
“Yes,” he said shortly, and rose to his feet. Draco stood too, his eyes suddenly going wide and fearful.
“I went by Ron and Hermione’s last night,” Harry said casually, and watched as Malfoy froze, the apple halfway back to his mouth. “Viola’s quite the talker, isn’t she?”
Lucius was sitting behind a massive wooden desk, looking down his long nose at Torey Edwards, who was chained to a chair before the desk. Dementors ringed them on all sides, their shifting, shadowy forms seeming to rustle menacingly.
He was so caught up in his excitement that he didn’t register that the door, usually spelled shut when he arrived, was slightly ajar. He pushed it open and barreled through, then stopped when he saw another Auror standing in the hallway right in front of Malfoy’s cell. It was a stocky man who Harry thought was called Richmond, or Ritchie. He was pressed up against the barred door, saying something in a low voice that Harry couldn’t quite hear. His pants seemed to be loose around the waist, sort of open in the front.
“You poor sod,” he said, almost kindly. “I paid him to tell you those things to see how you’d respond. Didn’t even have to pay him much, when I told him it was to fuck with a Death Eater.”
“Mr. Potter! Mr. Malfoy!” he exclaimed with a broad smile. The tip of his wand was glowing with a bright green light that Harry recognized as a recording spell. “Harold Rose with
“I’m to bring you to the Master,” the wizard said calmly. “Stand slowly and put your hands behind your back.
“Yes, we do,” he said firmly, and stepped up to stand beside Draco. “I’ll be careful,” he said with a disarming smile to the older man behind the desk. “Just give me a calm one and I’ll hold on tight. And Malfoy can give me some pointers,” he said with a smile at Draco, who looked away quickly.
“Hermione’s here too,” he said quickly once they were in the hall. “Where do they take new prisoners?”
This second kiss was like flower petals unfurling, like wide open fields, like sunlight on deep water. Like a journey just beginning. Like home.
Draco didn’t realize he was talking to her softly under his breath until Potter moved up right next to him. He stopped quickly, embarrassed, but Potter only smiled.
“Harry, we both know you won’t,” he said with a half-smile. “I’ll come with you.”
“What if you’re wrong?” Harry whispered. “Am I so predictable?”
“I assume you’ve both seen it?”
“First of all, if you can’t afford a lawyer, the Ministry will provide you one of their legal staff who are highly skilled and incredibly ethical,” Harry retorted. “Second, excuse me for thinking that your boyfriend would want to help you, clearly –”
She looked back at him for a long moment, then sighed and nodded. “I’m coming with you,” she said firmly. “Luna, go back and fill the others in. I don’t know where we’re going, but if we’re not back by midnight, come looking. Ok?”
Fortunately, every time Harry had brought it up, he had dropped it again almost immediately. Draco was fairly certain this was due to his own total inability to respond properly, and felt embarrassment curling in his chest. It hadn’t yet come to Harry having to force him into anything, but Draco harbored no illusions: if he didn’t get his act together soon, Harry would do what was necessary.
and close your eyes—”
Draco couldn’t breathe. Couldn’t think. Before he could muster any kind of action, Kingsley looked around and met his eyes. The Minister’s dark eyes were strangely vacant, but when he saw Draco he stood quickly.
He realized he was crying, but he brushed the tears roughly aside and pulled out his wand. “Stupefy!”
Then he stood, slowly, and pointed his wand directly at Harry.
“Thank you for taking care of her,” he said carefully to Ron and Hermione. “I am in your debt.”
“Fine,” he growled. “I don’t know why you both trust him all of a sudden, but fine.” He shoved his wand into a pocket of his jumper and resolutely turned his back on Draco. The other man didn’t move, but Harry saw his eyes close briefly.
“Yeah,” Harry agreed happily. “I love those stories.”
Harry nodded and pulled up the hood of his invisibility cloak as Hermione withdrew a small vial of Polyjuice Potion from her pocket. She downed it in a single gulp and transformed before his eyes into a mousy little man with a huge mustache.
“He’s my
“It’s just…I don’t know. It’s
“Why?” The question was out of his mouth before Draco could stop himself. He pressed his hands against his lap, desperate to know, dripping with shame. “How can you trust me?"
Distantly, he wondered what Harry would think of all this, but he pushed the thought away. Harry was certainly done with him, he had made sure of that. He couldn’t dwell on the past.
He would, he assured himself, after the semester had ended. Right now, between final papers and assignments, he barely had time to sleep, let alone dispose of suspicious objects. Even though now he was fairly sure that Harry would hear him out before calling the Aurors. Maybe. Almost certainly. Draco took a deep breath. He was being foolish, and he wouldn’t put Harry in that position. He would wait until classes were done and he could get rid of the letters safely.
Harry jerked back as if the other man had slapped him. He didn’t know what question he had been expecting, but it had not been that one. “Um…sleeping?” He tried to laugh. It came out as more of a gasp. “What, Malfoy, do you mean –? Like…sex?”
Taking a deep breath, Draco slid his finger between the wax and the parchment, taking care not to ruin the seal. Neat, spidery handwriting filled the several pieces of paper tucked within: a list of books, a suggested list of supplies, and instructions for reaching Platform 9¾ on September 1.
about a horse, you’re
Malfoy raised his head at that. His eyes were red and his hair was wild, as if he’d been pulling it. He glared at Harry so fiercely Harry almost took a step back.
“I said: are trainers ok to wear?” Potter was dressed in blue jeans and a dark red T-shirt that made his dark skin look like it was glowing. Draco swallowed.
“It’s too late,” he said, and his voice was so resigned that it made Harry’s heart hurt. “They’re on their way. I understand, of course.”
“He did,” Harry confirmed, grinning back. “Sometimes people can surprise you.”
“Everything will be alright, Mr. Malfoy,” Riley replied absently, his gaze fixed on Potter’s motionless form. “Just a few more minutes, now, and everything will be alright.”
(See the end of the chapter for
(Also, P.S., I hope you and your families and communities are safe and ok. Sending a lot of love to all y'all. Drink some water. Give yourself a hug.)
“Alright, Potter?” he asked. Harry grinned back and pulled him in for a lingering kiss.
Draco flinched back, unthinking. He hardly realized what he had done until he saw Lucius’s eyes widen imperceptibly. The other man drew his hand back with a thin smile.
“I’m not going to fight you,” he said carefully. “Although I could. I know this place, this language, this land better than you. You would catch us in the end but I would make it very, very difficult for you. And you would have to obliviate a lot of Muggles. A lot of Muggles,” he repeated, staring into Harry’s eyes.
He broke off at Hermione’s small gasp and felt anger flare in his chest.
They walked side by side into the store, and Harry felt his breath catch in his throat. The store looked exactly the same as it had all those years ago when he had come here with Hagrid. Then, he had been beaten-down eleven-year-old hardly daring to believe that his life had changed forever. He had been overwhelmed at the quality of the robes—fabric finer than anything he had ever touched, let alone been allowed to wear.
. Images rose up in his mind’s eye: Harry’s face, twisted with hatred; wands flung out, spells flying, pain blossoming across his chest; that first evening at the castle, they were both so small, a hand offered in haughty friendship, and denied.
“If you think – for one minute – as if I don’t think about – as if I don’t wish
Draco didn’t meet anyone else between the alcove and the dining hall. He was slightly taken aback to see Potter still talking to Hermione. It felt as if hours had passed since he left, although the candles on their table had burned down only slightly. As if his return was some sort of cue, Hermione gave Potter a quick hug across the table and turned to Draco with a hesitant smile.
“You may be of some use to me, yet,” he said musingly. “I don’t think I will kill you today, but make no mistake, Draco.” Here, he stood again, glowering down at Draco seated on the other side of the desk. “You are no son of mine.”
Which was why, the next day, he was unsurprised to find that he was looking forward to seeing Malfoy. So much so, in fact, that he hurried through all of his morning work and was heading down to the cells a full hour earlier than normal. He had more leftover lasagna today, which he knew Malfoy loved. He was excited to see the other man and tell him about Viola and Rose’s latest game, in which one of them pointed at you and said “Stupify” and you had to collapse and make funny noises while the other one tickled you. He was excited to hear Malfoy laugh.
“I understand,” he said. “How long do I have to get everything in order?”
Draco couldn’t deal with that either. So he waited in another chair – chained, this time, and gods, he hadn’t missed
Two questions; two reminders of his own failures. Absently, Harry reached for the glass of firewhiskey by his wand and took a deep swallow.
, Harry found himself thinking, then caught himself. Of course he did – the bastard had been living in Madrid for years, making Miles’s life hell and then kidnapping his daughter. Harry shook himself mentally and grasped his wand more firmly in his pocket. This was a hardened criminal he was about to confront. He couldn’t get distracted with things like accents and voices.
“Bathroom. Now.”
“My most sincere congratulations, Harry Potter!” the man exclaimed happily as he approached their table. “I remember well the first time I saw you as a boy, with those terrible relatives of yours, and now here you are, our savior once again, extending the hand of peace and friendship across the divide of the war, your own suffering notwithstanding, I applaud you – oh! I applaud you! – for your dedication to our cause –”
“Good to be back,” Harry said, returning the smile. His attention, however, was fixed on Malfoy, who had also risen to his feet but was standing back, as if wary. When he caught Harry’s gaze, Malfoy flushed and looked down.
Suddenly, angry shouts rose above the jovial chatter. “Kill the Death Eater!” “Dark Lord scum!” “Save Harry Potter!” Harry felt Malfoy tense beside him and was already reaching for his wand as three Aurors he hadn’t even seen beside them strode toward the disturbance. Two other Aurors flanked them and started ushering them toward the carriage that would take them to the reception, but not before Harry saw a spell fly through the air and narrowly miss Malfoy. It hit an unlucky witch instead, who fell to the ground gasping.
“So,” he began, finally focusing on Draco. The other man’s shoulders were still hunched, and he was grasping the paper-covered robes like a drowning man clings to a lifeboat. “What was that about?"
The letter ended there, no signature or anything. Draco took a deep breath.
“I’ve always hated black olives. You just haven’t noticed.”
Malfoy nodded slowly. “What about it?”
, thought Draco suddenly, rotating slowly in the air.
Confused images filled his mind. Arriving at the horse barn, seeing the old man greet Malfoy like a long-lost son, and reveling a bit at the feeling of being in the background. Watching Malfoy gallop away – absurdly graceful, it was unfair, really – and lifting his hand to wave as Malfoy wheeled his mount and started thundering back across the grass. He remembered thinking, in that moment, that Malfoy’s smile seemed to light up the gray, cloudy world. He remembered laughing at himself. He remembered grinning.
“Oh come on, Potter, like you would have cared? Like you would’ve even believed me?”
Harry shouted, but Lucius hung onto his wand and Harry felt a bolt of something like lightening shooting up his wand arm as the spell was –
Harry put down his chopsticks too. He arranged them carefully on the table so that they were leaning up against his plate just so. He took a deep breath.
“I want you to understand why I took Viola away from him,” he said firmly. “I’ll give you my memories, you can look at them in a Pensieve. And you have to watch them before you decide whether or not she’s going back there. Do you understand?” His voice was cold, and Harry was suddenly struck by the fact that Malfoy was asking him if he, Harry, understood terms of surrender, even though Malfoy was the one with a wand pressed to his throat. Scorching annoyance flickered in his gut. Fucking Malfoy.
“I guess not,” Harry said, chuckling. He pressed his cheek into the top of Draco’s head. “I like it, though. Talking with you.”
“Up and at ‘em, sonny boy,” he growled. “We’re here for your daily exercises.”
Viola nodded, suddenly sober. “Are you coming?” She asked in perfect English. Harry hadn’t realized she spoke English that well.
He sneaked a glance at Potter, careful to keep his head still. The other man was waving casually, smiling broadly with just the right mix of wry and joyful that made it look like he couldn’t believe his luck, walking down this hall between hundreds of strangers, his lifelong enemy’s hand clasped in his. Draco realized he was staring and quickly snapped his eyes forward. He arranged his features into what he hoped looked enough like a smile for the cameras flashing somewhere off to their left, and lifted his own hand in a tentative wave.
Still, something kept him from burning it – fear, but of what? Of the man who had raised him with an iron fist? Of Warden, watching every spell he cast? It wasn’t like the message said anything particularly dangerous, he reflected yet again. To any outside observer, it was just a father congratulating his son.
Harry had sat back down in his chair by the bed. He squeezed Draco’s hand again. “There are no easy answers,” he said. “I’m just glad he won’t be able to hurt you ever again.”
He took a breath, suddenly desperate to change the subject. “Draco,” he said, and the blond man looked up at him, eyebrows raised. Harry suddenly felt self-conscious. “What?” he asked.
Harry furrowed his brow, stepped forward. “Draco,” he began. “Draco, I’m not a hallucination. I’m real, I’m here, and I’m going to get you out.”
Almost without realizing what he was doing, Harry stepped forward and held out his hand. They were supposed to be old school chums, weren’t they? The audience would expect some kind of civil greeting, if not the tearful reunion of two separated lovers. He half expected Malfoy to smirk and turn away, but the other man met his eyes again quickly before reaching forward and clasping Harry’s hand in his own. Malfoy’s palm was cool, but shaking ever so slightly. Surprised, Harry tried to meet Malfoy’s eyes once more, but his gaze was focused again just past Harry’s right ear. Still, he didn’t pull away.
The crowd inside was slightly more restrained than the crowd outside, although Harry still blinked as several flashbulbs went off all at once. The Druid beside him still had a hand on his arm; she seemed to be waiting for something.
“Kingsley says that Malfoy attacked you,” she said carefully, watching him. “I don’t know the specifics, but you went into the bedroom and we heard shouting. There was a huge thump, then Kingsley started calling for backup. When Ron and I got there, he was bending over you on the floor and Draco was on his knees in one corner.” She swallowed. “Kingsley had cast a carcerous spell on him, he couldn’t move or talk, but he was watching you, Harry, and his eyes –”
Hermione nodded sharply and strode toward the reporters. Harry could hear her voice, bright with false gaiety, as she expertly intercepted them, and he thanked the universe, yet again, for Hermione’s constant presence in his life. He walked quickly to the bedroom before anyone else could pull him into a conversation.
was a huge map of the United States and Canada, the British Isles, and Western Europe. It spread across an entire wall and was crisscrossed with shimmering threads in hundreds of different colors. Small, neat labels marched alongside the outlines of nations, some cities, and a few regions colored in teal or gold.
In which they get married.
of him.”
This wasn’t something he had anticipated when Kingsley had approached him about the marriage. It was one thing to prepare for sleeping arrangements, but quite another to find something to talk about over breakfast.
“Good, I think,” Harry replied. “Ron says she’s settling in pretty well. I know she misses you, though,” he added awkwardly, realizing that he hadn’t been to Ron and Hermione’s house since Viola had moved in. Malfoy huffed a laugh.
From where he sat in the middle of the floor, Kingsley Shacklebolt looked up and around blearily. “What –? Ugh,” he said, rubbing his head. “Where are –? How –?”
“Lost cause, a hopeless coward, absolutely spineless,” Snape was saying. He looked up suddenly and caught Draco’s eyes.
“I...I understand,” he said slowly. “I messed up, that night, with Kingsley. I should have trusted you, I should have listened to you, instead of getting angry. I was so angry, Draco, but not at you – gods – I wish –” He stopped. Tried again. “I’m so, so sorry, and I understand if you never want to see me again but I’m going to get you out of here anyway. Ok?”
Harry shot him a questioning look, but Malfoy didn’t look up. “Mm-hmm,” he replied, flipping the first pancake. “Well, great then.”
“Thank you, Potter, you can go now,” he said, with an air of finality. Harry felt as if he was being dismissed, and fought a sudden urge to chuckle.
“Oh, sure, right,” Harry said quickly, coming around the table and peering over Draco’s shoulder. “You’re in school again! How was the first day?”
“Just…I was just about to go back in…” he started, but Weasley shook his head sharply. Moving with a catlike quickness that Draco wouldn’t have credited him with, Weasley’s hands shot forward and grabbed the collar of Draco’s dress robes. Draco suddenly found himself pinned against the far wall of the bathroom, the other man’s hands pressing painfully into his neck.
Now, he seemed to be in his office. That was strange. Why was he lying in a bed in his office?
They returned to the farmhouse to find Viola and Ron playing tag in the front yard. Ron waved an acknowledgement but didn’t stop chasing the shrieking little girl. Malfoy strode into the house, suitcase in hand, without a word, and Harry followed him, suddenly unsure where to be. He lingered in the sitting room, listening to Malfoy opening and closing drawers. A little while later, there was the sound of a shower running, and Harry guessed Malfoy had realized this might be his last chance for a shower for a while.
He hadn’t, of course. He’d stayed. Soon, though, he would be leaving, and it felt good. Good things behind, good things ahead. He threw the Floo powder into the fireplace and stepped into the flames.
“No. Neither did I.” He clasped the bars in his hands, wishing he could clasp Malfoy’s hands. “I like you, Malfoy.”
“Oh no, don’t worry about it,” Harry said, relieved. “It’s good to communicate about these things. We’re in kind of a strange place, right? We need to make sure we’re on the same page, even if it’s awkward.”
They were at Malfoy Manor.
“Who – who did this?” he breathed, looking up at Harry as if Harry would have the answer.
of the disapparition spell seemed to cut through Harry’s skull.
He trailed off suggestively and Draco closed his eyes, turning his face away. The man grabbed his jaw and pulled his head back so they were eye to eye. “Look at me when I’m talking to you, you little –”
Harry started to head toward a table in the back, but turned quickly when he realized Draco was no longer behind him. The other man was still standing, frozen in the doorway, his gaze fixed on Clara, who had not looked up. Confused, Harry hurried back to his side.
“Here you go: American pancakes!” he said with a flourish, helping himself to the top two. Malfoy took two as well, mimicking Harry’s movements exactly as he put first butter, then syrup on his plate. They each took a bite at the same time.
—his pulse was strong. Draco realized he was cradling Potter’s head in his lap. His hands, where they had touched Potter’s head, came away sticky with blood. Draco forced himself to breath. Riley would find a healer. Someone would fix this.
“Actually, it means I want to end this,” Draco shot back, and threw the jeweled egg to the ground. It smashed into hundreds of tiny pieces with a hollow
Malfoy’s eyes snapped up, his gaze panicked. He took a step back. Harry raised a hand.
– of pressure finally releasing in a delicious breath. Malfoy –
. It was his mantra, and let him shut everything else out to focus only the task at hand. Right now, that meant picking his top three floor plans to show Harry that evening.
The Weasley girl was walking hand in hand with Lovegood and reached Potter first. She immediately launched into a whispered tirade that Draco couldn’t hear over the din of other guests talking and eating. He took a bit of his salad to give himself something to focus on, and looked up a few moments later, bland smile plastered on his face, to find Ginny Weasley glaring at him over his water glass.
Malfoy started up and whipped around, his eyes going wide. When he saw Harry, though, his eyes narrowed dangerously.
It was like Dumbledore all over again.
Draco stilled his shaking hands and stepped back into the party. His eyes immediately landed on Harry, who was now nodding and smiling along with several Ministry officials, but who met his gaze across the room with a broad smile. Almost as if Harry was glad to see him.
“A full pardon?” he breathed. “Fuck, Minister, I really didn’t think that would work!”
“Really,” Malfoy said blandly. “That’s quite a statement.”
Before he got a chance to wonder further, however, a door set into the wall behind the large desk opened and the Minister of Magic walked through it. Kingsley Shacklebolt was every bit as imposing as Draco remembered. Dressed in dark blue dress robes, his dark skin seemed to glow, enhancing the weak light cast from the lamp on Warden’s desk. Draco tried not to lean back or sink down in the chair. It was difficult, however, when the leader of the wizarding world was looking at you as if something unpleasant and slimy had crawled out from under his bed. There was a long moment of silence before Draco realized they must be waiting for him to say something.
“She’s not even as bad as my mum,” he said confiding. “Don’t even get near her today unless you’re holding a centerpiece.”
There was a long moment of silence. Then Ron lowered his wand.
Still, he managed to pull himself together for the first few meeting of the day, and even sent several messages asking for reports and updates. The courier owls came back bearing scroll after scroll of parchment: a new agent had been identified to take over the covert mission in Norway, but she needed the proper clearances; Kingsley needed an updated list of Death Eater-adjacent groups for a report; the Daily Prophet was asking for another interview. Harry could feel himself getting more and more consumed with his work, and let it wash over him gratefully. The tightening in his chest was a familiar companion; it reminded him that he was needed, that he was doing something important. He might be in the dark about his relationship with Draco, or even with Ron for that matter; he might be so tired that he felt on the verge of collapsing if he weren’t pulled so tight – but at least he was defending the world against dark magic.
Malfoy’s eyes flickered to him, then came to rest back on Harry.
The line shortened rapidly. Everyone in this class was experienced enough that a boggart hardly seemed to phase them. Draco was only a few people from the end of the line now. He waited breathlessly, hoping against hope that Shaver would step in front of him, or class would end, or that he would suddenly gain the ability to physically sink into the floor.
“I don’t know what time it is, but I am starving,” he said heartily. “How about some dinner?”
It could have been hours or days later, but finally, someone came for him. A tall, reedy wizard entered his cell without a word and silently cast the spell to make the chains on the chair retract. Draco startled at the sudden change but didn’t make any more movements. He watched the other man warily.
“Malfoy,” Hermione responded coolly. “You look like shit.”
Hermione’s face was pinched and worn. She looked as if she hadn’t slept in a few days which, if Harry knew her, she probably hadn’t.
Harry felt anything remotely like sympathy for Malfoy abruptly fall away, and he led him to the cells in stony silence.
“Terrible,” Harry groaned around a mouthful of soup. “Fucking Norwegians setting themselves up another Dark Lord, and now we don’t even have an undercover agent to keep an eye on things.”
“You’re – it’s –” he breathed. Then he was kissing Harry, and Harry was drowning in it, it was so good, so
He was just about to pull out, sickened, when the scene changed dramatically. Narcissa Malfoy was there, lying in a bed and looking pale and haggard. Malfoy was sitting by her head, holding a small crying, wiggling bundle and staring at his mother. Miles strode in and bent over Narcissa, caressing her cheek tenderly.
“Thank you,” he whispered, and then laughed to himself. Who was he thanking? The sofa he and Pansy had bought when they moved in? The bookcase he had built himself, without using any magic, during his short-lived but passionate “live like a Muggle” phase? The TV Harry had given him as a birthday present, beginning the tradition of Friday movie nights that just kept growing?
He would be arriving in a carriage, as would Potter, as scripted in the traditional wizarding wedding ceremony. When he had been declared presentable, the two employees who had taken him from Azkaban grasped his arms again and the three of them Apparated again, this time to a field where two winged horses grazed on the new spring grasses and a huge carriage sat waiting, looking more like a frosted wedding cake than a vehicle.
Finally, Draco trailed off into silence.
Harry threw himself into work. There were always new cases to take on, new victims to question, new perpetrators to track down. He was a busy man with a full schedule and terrible work-life balance. It made all kinds of sense that he would be too busy to go visit one specific prisoner in one specific cell. The case had been solved, Viola’s custody battle had been won, she was settling in quite well with Ron and Hermione, according to Ron’s stories, and the Ministry could handle Malfoy from here on out.
“That’s right,” he said more loudly. “You’re a lost cause, a hopeless coward, absolutely spineless. Did you really think I cared for you? Respected you? How could I, when you never thought for yourself, when you followed your father into hell with nary a backward glance, when you
Malfoy accepted it without hesitation this time and drank it down. “Got anything else in there?” he asked, eyeing Harry’s lunch bag. Harry laughed and tossed him an apple through the bars, which Malfoy set about demolishing.
“Absolutely,” Hermione said, her smile trembling. “Let us know if we can do anything.”
“I wondered if I’d find you here.” Weasley’s words were slightly slurred. Draco felt his stomach clench.
“Me too,” Harry said fervently. “Can I get you anything, Minister? Water, or tea, or –”
It wasn’t even that much of a stretch, he consoled himself, examining his own face in the mirror. The makeup spell from earlier seemed to be holding – he couldn’t see the dark circles beneath his eyes, and his hollowed cheekbones still held a magically-induced healthy pink glow. Had he really only left Azkaban that morning? It felt like years had passed. He was so tired. He found himself wondering how much longer the dinner would stretch, then reminded himself that this was his life now: constantly being watched, judged, scorned. In Azkaban, at least there had been a modicum of anonymity, a pretense of impartial treatment. Now, even that was gone.
“Excuse me!” An annoyed voice behind him yanked Draco from his memories and he stumbled forward, out of the doorway and into the classroom. He was trembling, he realized, and his heart was beating violently. Gluing his eyes to the floor, he walked quickly to a desk at the back, praying that his eyes were playing tricks on him, that the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor was not –
,” he said finally, hating how plaintive his voice sounded.
“Why do you always promise the parents that we’ll find their missing kids?” Ron fumed a few minutes later as they walked down the hall. “This is an old case! She’s been gone for a year, the trail’s gone cold, we’ll be lucky to find her corpse, and then Hathaway is going to be beating down our door because you promised him something and Robards is going to be pissed at you.
“One thing we both know, Potter,” Malfoy replied grimly. “Is that I will
“She’s got lots to say,” Malfoy said, still a bit wary, but his eyes brightened. “What was she on about last night?”
“How is she?” he asked quietly. Hermione nodded.
And a small, pale boy also being fitted with robes had smugly asked him if his parents were “our kind.”
Draco ate his own food slowly, aware of his stomach as it accepted the finest food it had been given in years. There must have been some kind of spell on the salmon, though, for although it was rich and buttery, and the mashed potatoes must have been made with cream they were so fluffy, he didn’t feel nauseous at all. At least, not because of the food. After the first question, Potter had remained focused on the plate before him.
Elias nodded, making a note. “I’ll look into that.” He glanced up at Harry. “I assume the court date will be soon?”
Warden’s office was austere. No space wasted on things like pictures frames, or family photos, or paint. Just gray walls, a single desk holding two neat stacks of paper, and a cushioned chair in which the small woman now sat. Draco had been shoved into the room’s only other chair, an uncomfortable metal contraption not unlike the one deep inside the Ministry of Magic: the one he had sat in while the Wizengamot sentenced him to fifty years in Azkaban. This chair, too, had sprung to life as soon as he sat down, cinching his wrists to the chair’s arms with thick leather cuffs under Warden’s sharp gaze. Lest anyone doubt the strength of the cuffs, lines of shimmering steel could be seen where the leather had been reinforced, and Draco was certain they contained spells he would be hard-pressed to undo even if he had his wand. The cuffs were much more comfortable than the iron chains at the Ministry, however. Draco had to admit he appreciated that.
As Draco turned her, his thoughts were focused on Riley—what had gone wrong with Riley’s spell to provoke such a reaction? What had he been trying to do?
Harry ran his hands through his hair in frustration. “So your colleagues have told us,” he said lightly. “What I need from you, Mr. Bogrod, is a solution.” He nodded in Draco’s direction. “I want my husband and I to be on equal footing as regards our mutual accounts. Draco Malfoy is a free man; he needs to be able to access funds even when I’m not with him.”
“Well now, Mr. Malfoy – I see it’s your lucky day.”
Slowly, slowly, Draco opened his eyes. Gray eyes met green in a wordless plea. Harry took a deep breath. He had to get this right.
“No,” Draco mused, hanging up another ornament. This one was a miniature lion that roared silently and pawed at the air. “He had strengths in other areas.”
Ron peered at him over the rim of his glass. He raised his eyebrows.
“I’ve never been one to bow to the inevitable,” he said instead. “Especially when someone is being so
from the morning after the party:
“Malfoy?” A loud voice said suddenly behind him. “What’re ye—” and then Hagrid was there, his arms full of leafy boughs and flowers and blessedly empty of Harry’s body. Draco stepped back reflexively, his fists clenching against the suspicion in Hagrid’s words.
“No!” Harry did laugh now as the weight of their misunderstandings came crashing down on him. “Gods, we’ve been so blind, haven’t we! I’ve been so blind.”
Malfoy was on his knees in the cell, his mouth wrapped around Rich-whatever-his-name-was’s dick.
Harry walked and walked with very little idea of where he was going. He couldn’t really think about anything beyond the waves of nausea that were crashing over him every few moments, followed closely by waves of pure self-loathing.
“That’s great, Ron,” Harry said gratefully. “I’ll explain it all to Robards if he tries to make trouble. And once we’ve watched the git’s memories, we’ll get her back to her dad right as rain.”
Torey was wearing Hermione’s thinking face. “We had to say something specific to get here,” she mused aloud. “Maybe we have to say something else to get where we need to go? Or do something?” She looked up at the dark Manor.
In which Harry makes a decision
Draco touched down on the deserted front courtyard. He supposed all the students were still having breakfast after the welcome feast and the Sorting the night before, and was grateful that no one saw him looking around awkwardly before he found the small niche in the inner wall with his own name on it that was clearly intended for his broom. He stowed the broomstick, then turned to face the large front doors. And froze.
“Shut up!” Harry snapped, and stepped forward once more. Draco flinched back and Harry felt a wave of magic hit him like a physical blow. He had just enough time to think –
“Absolutely, yes, couldn’t be happier,” Draco responded quickly, reaching out to take the other man’s hand and shaking it solemnly. He kept his face in a mask of polite attentiveness as Dedalus went off again about Potter’s many virtues. By the time he bobbed away back to his seat, Dedalus was smiling again and Draco’s hands were clenched into fists beneath the table. He had only a moment’s peace, however, before the tall witch swept up to him and clasped him by the hand.
“I hope she forgets me quickly,” he said matter-of-factly. “I would hate for missing me to ruin her childhood.”
“Reconciliation is all well and good, Harry,” Hermione began. “But tying your entire future—the rest of your life—to Malfoy…”
“What if we can’t get back here?” she whispered back. “We have to see what we’re up against.”
Harry reached for one of Draco’s hands and grasped it. Draco squeezed back, but would not look at him. “Thank you, Minister,” he said. “I will let you know if I want updates, but I’m feeling quite tired now, if you wouldn’t mind...?”
? Send you back where?”
in a way that place never had.
“Thanks for the soup,” he said. “Sorry for the noise.”
, Harry thought with a twist in his gut. He couldn’t help but feel a twinge of sympathy, though, as he watched her hold back tears and saw how gently Malfoy held her.
“I’m teasing you, Potter,” Malfoy interrupted, the flirtatious smile fading to be replaced by a look of deep exhaustion. “You know I’m a hopeless tease.” He closed his eyes and leaned back once more. “I’ll see you in two months.”
“He said yes?”
–” Weasley’s breath was coming fast now, his face growing even redder beneath his auburn hair. “I will hunt you to the ends of the earth, Malfoy, and I will make you wish you were back in Azkaban. No one will protect you, no one will stand up for you, and I will not let you die until I have made you pay. Do. You. Understand.”
to me, to ask me for my perspective and then to
“Yeah,” Harry said. “Maybe.”
With a smile that he hoped looked less grim than it felt, Harry got to his feet and turned to see Malfoy already standing. The other man’s gray eyes were determined above a smile that would hopefully look less pained in grainy newsprint. Drawing a deep breath, Harry took one final look out over the crowd of guests. Hermione was waving, smiling, beside a sullen Ron who nonetheless gave Harry a thumbs-up. Harry smiled back, then turned to Malfoy and again clasped hands. The noise was nearly unbearable now.
“And now, I would like to know who I will be teaching in this prestigious Advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts class.” Shaver spun to face them all again, beaming. “When I point to you, please tell me your name, your class year, and one thing you hope to learn from me this year.”
Draco flushed and bit his lower lip. Harry suddenly realized how that had sounded.
“I’m sorry,” he said quietly. “I…forgot myself. It…it will not happen again.”
“You don’t say!” said the third, but he didn’t have time to say any more because Harry cast three quick “Stupifies” from beneath the cloak and all three men fell down, motionless.
“Is this ok?” he asked quietly.
That first meeting, they compared notes. Neville silently passed Harry the front page of the
Looking back on that night, Harry could not quite remember how everything had gone. He could remember the broad strokes, of course, but small details were fuzzy, or gone completely.
There was a wall and a closed door between the sitting room and kitchen, so he couldn’t see anything that was happening, but he could hear Elena clucking over the state of someone’s shoes. Then he heard the child’s voice again, complaining about something, and then the voice that was Malfoy’s but
Draco Malfoy was sleeping in his bedroom.
“Yes, thank you Dedalus” Potter replied. Draco was quietly pleased to note that the other man’s easy confidence appeared a bit ruffled. He had already taken a bite of the salads set before them, and a bit of salad dressing caught the light on his lower lip. Draco looked down quickly. “Thank you for coming, it’s a pleasure to see you.”
Harry felt something large and ugly rise up in him: the same feeling he had gotten when Draco had calmly asked if he should beg for his own money from Harry’s vault.
“I’ve been back in England for months, Potter, and it’s been terrible.” Draco looked up at the stars and smiled suddenly, his eyes crinkling. “But things are looking up.”
It was difficult to remember, however, as Weasley bore down upon him. The other man’s breath smelled strongly of firewhiskey and his face was flushed.
Ron agreed, bemused, and he and Hermione walked back to the end of the hallway, where Harry could see them conferring in hushed tones. He turned back to the cell, feeling a bit left out, only to find himself on the receiving end of an uncomfortably astute stare by Malfoy.
“Good afternoon, Minister.” His voice caught in his throat but he inclined his head. It was odd how comfortable the formal motion felt; after four years of having even something as casual eye contact punished by a sharp slap or a hex, he wasn’t sure he remembered how to interact with people in the wider world.
“Not to worry,” the Auror, who he didn’t recognize, spoke over him. “She’ll be attended to, and the troublemakers will be identified and removed. Not to worries, sirs.” Harry hated being spoken over, treated like a child, but he noticed Malfoy’s cheeks had gone even paler and nodded quickly.
“That will do nicely,” Harry said firmly. He smiled disarmingly at the stunned goblin. “Please draw up the required forms now. We’ll wait.”
“And you admit that you’ve been keeping her here, without her father’s knowledge or permission?” asked Ron. Malfoy nodded again.
“Look,” he said through gritted teeth. “I don’t know what sob story that wanker told to get you here, but she is safer and happier with Elena than she ever was with him. He may be her father —”
He waved his wand casually and a large box floated out of a closet behind his desk.
He remembered finally being told that he could see Draco (“He’s on some pain spells, a little woozy, but conscious,” said the Healer with a smile. She looked tired. Harry wanted to hug her). He remembered walking into Draco’s room and seeing him lying there, pale against the white sheets, but smiling. Harry smiled back. They didn’t talk, just smiled, and Harry grasped Draco’s hand and would not let go.
Harry remembered how Ron and Hermione had disappeared for long months after finishing Hogwarts. She had wanted to go to Australia to find her parents, and Ron had gone with her because, as he said, he couldn’t imagine making her do that alone. They had never told Harry what happened on that trip, but they had come back sun-tanned and beaming, hand-in-hand and ready for the next chapter of their lives.
Then they both spoke at the same time.
The emergency portkey deposited them on a hillside overlooking a vast swath of Spanish countryside. Madrid was visible on the horizon as a hazy collection of tall buildings, but the land that swept away from their feet was rolling and open. About half a mile away, a small, slightly derelict farmhouse nestled between a field of hay and a large garden. Two thin horses grazed in a pasture that extended along the front of a wooden barn set behind the house. There was no other movement.
Malfoy was crying, Viola was screaming, and Harry had never felt so utterly, horribly helpless in his entire life, when the scene changed again —
“Alright, Malfoy?” he asked softly. Malfoy jerked back as if he had forgotten Harry was there.
Draco bit his lip. “I want you to,” he said carefully. Harry beamed.
“It’s settled then,” he said, beaming, and turned back to greet the next guest. Draco sat back in his chair, picked up his wine, and took a long sip, letting the warmth spread through his belly.
He had asked Harry about the scars on the back of his hand one afternoon, and Harry had told him about Umbridge’s punishment from fifth year. He had cried, a bit, remembering how alone he had felt. Malfoy had listened quietly, then reached through the bars to put a hand on his arm. They hadn’t spoken about it since.
Ron looked thoughtful. “I haven’t heard of anyone, but I’ll ask around,” he said, nodding. Harry gave him a wan smile and turned back to Hermione.
At Harry’s silence, Ron nodded. “You look like hell,” he said frankly. “And I’m just—I’m worried that being married to Malfoy isn’t helping.”
He blinked hard and focused on the paper in his hand. It was a floorplan, one of several that Harry had left for him to look at over the last few days: possibilities for their new flat, provided by the Ministry. Draco had been putting off looking at them – every time he thought about the Ministry, the nausea spiked – but Harry had mentioned it this morning over breakfast and Draco did not want to keep anyone waiting.
“What would you say if I told you that I am poised to rule the wizarding world, as Lord Voldemort intended, and that I want you by my side? My son,” he said quietly, and reached out a hand to stroke Draco’s cheek.
Luna beamed at Draco. “Hello,” she said simply. Draco, remembering her kindness at their wedding feast, smiled back far more genuinely than he had so far that evening.
Elena wiped her eyes and waved them off, having apparently accepted the story that Harry and Ron had arrived via bus from the closest town and were going to leave with Malfoy and Viola the same way. They walked for a little while, until the farmhouse had disappeared from view and they were along in the rolling grasslands. Then Harry held out the empty soda bottle that was their portkey.
“I understand,” he replied slowly. “And if we agree to this, you and Viola will come with us quietly now, and you’ll tell Elena something that doesn’t get the Muggle police set on us.” It wasn’t a question, but Malfoy nodded.
“Mr. Malfoy,” Kingsley said, inclining his head in greeting. “Mr. Potter.”
“See you later, Malfoy,” Harry called back over his shoulder.
Harry shoved Malfoy in with a little more force than was strictly necessary, and the barred cell door banged shut with a satisfying crash.
“Wait,” said Malfoy quickly as Harry was turning to leave. “The memories.”
“Lucius Malfoy is in Azkaban,” Harry said loudly, firmly. “It is my understanding that no one can send letters from inside Azkaban, is that correct Minister?”
Miles Hathaway: British expat, Squib, and the father of a missing six-year-old girl. A six-year-old girl who had apparently been kidnapped by none other than Draco Malfoy.
Frowning, Draco went to close it. What he saw in the room, however, made him freeze.
“Drop your wand, Lucius,” Harry said firmly. “Come with me quietly to the Ministry and we can see about getting you a reduced sentence. Just Azkaban for life, instead of the Kiss.”
Harry saw red.
“No,” Harry raised his eyebrow in a question. “What have they done now?”
The words died on his lips as he got a good look at Malfoy’s face for the first time since the ceremony’s end. The other man was bone white, jaw clenched and eyes wide. He was breathing shallowly, quickly, like a cornered animal. His hands, as he brought them together to clasp them in his lap, were visibly shaking.
“I mean, not that I don’t care about—this.” He waved his hand vaguely at Draco, and the other man nodded.
“Well what does it say, Harry?” Hermione asked reasonably. She was perched on the couch, Ron sprawled on the rug at her feet, her dark hands tangled in his red hair. Mutely, Harry handed her the note. “Tomorrow,” she breathed, and Ron shook his head.
“Alright. Be careful,” Harry said with a glance over his shoulder. “If I’m not back out here in 20 minutes, get out of here and come back with the others.”
“Viola, cariño!” came Elena’s voice from the kitchen. Harry realized there must be a side door that led directly from the end of the driveway to the kitchen. “Ven por acá, que estás sucia –”
“Firewhiskey for me,” Harry said, and Draco nodded quietly. “Two,” he amended, and Clara sauntered back behind the bar. Harry turned to Draco, but stopped short at what he saw in the other man’s face. They sat in silence for long minutes until Clara returned.
Then Draco heard what Boggart Snape was muttering, and felt stomach turn to ice.
“I take offense to that, Harry.” Luna Lovegood appeared at Harry’s shoulder, a heaping plate of food in her hands. Her long blond hair was twisted up in a complex series of braids held in place with sparkling flowers. “I prefer to think of myself as a butterfly.”
, the letter continued cryptically.
Harry had many more questions – how long had Draco been living here? What was he doing here, in this Spanish farmhouse in the middle of nowhere? Had Elena ever seen a child named Viola? – but he had decidedly exhausted his limited supply of Spanish. Ron, too, seemed more intent on eating biscuits than in conversing further. They sat in companionable silence for several minutes, Elena bustling around the room tidying up and periodically popping into the kitchen to check whatever was cooking. She set a copy of that day’s newspaper on the arm of the sofa by Harry’s hand, indicating with hand gestures and smiles that he could read it if he wanted to. Obligingly, he picked it up and scanned the incomprehensible Spanish, to Ron’s great amusement.
“Oh, that,” Malfoy said, waving a hand dismissively and leaning back against the wall so that he was no longer looking at Harry. “It turns out my copious charms aren’t quite enough to balance the drawbacks of dating a prisoner and – how did you so eloquently put it earlier, Potter? – a ‘convicted Death Eater.’ Good in kink, dull in practice, I suppose.”
that, or even what business it is of anyone besides
“We’re picking up books and school robes for my husband, here,” he said, resting a hand on Draco’s back in what he hoped looked like a fond and familiar gesture. “He’s starting his final year of Hogwarts in a few weeks.”
Ron was looking at him, one eyebrow quirked. Harry suddenly felt defensive. “What?”
“You have it,” Draco responded, not meeting Harry’s eyes. His voice was wooden, as if he was repeating something from rote. “‘The Malfoy fortune shall be held in trust by Mr. Potter until such time as Mr. Malfoy is deemed suitable, by the Ministry of Magic, to handle his own financials once more.’” When Harry didn’t immediately respond, Draco rushed on. “Of course, I understand, and will do whatever you think is best—”
“What would you say,” Lucius continued, gaining volume. “If I told you that I am not only followed, but
Draco laughed and followed Ron into the garden. The Burrow looked like something out of a fairy tale. Strings of lights stretched from roofline to garden fence, bathing a circle of flowers in a sweet golden glow as twilight began to descend around them. Chairs, many of which were already occupied, had been set up in a circle around the flowers. Draco spotted Harry at once and made his way over to him with a parting nod to Ron, who remained on the outskirts, bouncing Rose and cooing to her in loving nonsense.
“That’s it,” Harry shot back. He turned to go, then turned back. “Except – are they feeding you?”
“The dementors were stationed on our hall,” he was saying, as Draco served himself another helping of chicken. “After the war, the Ministry mandated that they only guard the most dangerous prisoners. As you know.” He nodded toward Draco, acknowledging Draco’s time in Azkaban, and Draco felt his heart swell. Talking with his father like this, man to man, as equals, had never happened before. It was intoxicating.
“I’m leaving,” he said quietly, and spun on his heel. The
“Nothing a little make-up spell can’t hide, mate,” he said with a wink. “Your fella will be swooning, no doubt about that.”
Something in Malfoy’s voice made him turn back to look at the other man. Malfoy was still watching him blandly, but his hands had clasped into fists.
Malfoy turned his face away, staring at the opposite stone wall of the cell. “Because you’re attracted to me physically,” he said in a monotone.
Harry had told Draco he was on his side. Had told him that he didn’t have to worry because he was safe now: safe from dark wizards, safe from Azkaban.
“—might as well tell me what I want to know,” Lucius’s voice was saying. Harry felt like he was about to be sick. It had been so long since he’d heard that cruel, calculating voice. It also hadn’t been long enough. “I can and will force it out of you, and it will be much more painful for you.”
Harry pushed back from his chair and took a breath. He hadn’t thought about Malfoy, down there in one of the holding cells, in days. Had it been two weeks since Miles’s trial? Since Malfoy and Elias...
“No, not at all. Yeah, it was my choice,” Harry responded, grinning. “I guess I just realized how much I needed a rest. I’ll probably go back eventually, but…” he trailed off, then shrugged. “Going to take it one day at a time.”
It was completely blank, but as he looked at it, words began to appear as if they were rising out of water. Draco felt his stomach clench. It was just like –
“Yes,” Harry nodded. “And Malfoy —"
Malfoy looked…perfect. Far more perfect than someone who had just been released from prison, drunk at least five glasses of wine last night, greeted hundreds of people, gone to sleep well after midnight, and hadn’t even had anything to eat yet this morning had any right to look. His hair was combed nearly away from his face, and his cheeks had a healthy glow that Harry didn’t remember from their time together at Hogwarts. He was dressed in light slacks and a long-sleeved button-down shirt in a dark red color that made his long fingers look even paler. The overall effect was someone who was ready for a business meeting, and although he was standing on the other side of the kitchen island, Harry wouldn’t have been surprised if the other man had been wearing dress shoes.
“Do what?” he asked, looking down his long nose at Harry. Harry wanted to eat him.
OMG IT'S DONE!!!?!?!?!
“I’m not your enemy, you know,” he said suddenly. Draco tensed, but Shaver continued. “Just here to help the students learn how to defend themselves.” Draco turned slowly to face him. Shaver was watching him with a crooked smile.
“We want to return her to her father, you heartless bastard,” Harry snarled, pushing past Ron. “What have you done with her?”
, including cursing anyone, taking more than 24 hours to answer any correspondence from Azkaban or the Ministry of Magic, or giving any public indication that this marriage wasn’t a pure love match greatly desired by both him and Mr. Potter.
These words seemed to unlock something in Draco. With a small cry, he collapsed against Harry’s body. Harry realized the other man was crying silently, tears running down his cheeks and onto Harry’s shirt. He was shaking his head, clearly unable to speak. Harry ran his hands down Draco’s back over and over again, rocking back and forth. “It’s ok, it’s ok, it’s going to be ok,” he said, again and again, a quiet croon over Draco’s silent sobs. “I’m right here, I’m not going anywhere, I’m here.”
Potter was a better actor than Draco had given him credit for.
“I don’t know what Warden told you,” he began. “I don’t know what Shaver thinks he’s doing, and I don’t know what Kingsley has to do with any of this, but I promise you, right now: to me, you are my husband, full stop.” He squeezed Draco’s hands. “No strings attached, no conditions, no catches. No sending you back to Azkaban if you annoy me.”
“No one is calling Kingsley,” he said firmly. “Ron, I believe Draco.”
“I...” Draco stammered. “I think...”
Harry tested his weight on both legs, then did a few experimental knee bends. “Seems to be. Why?”
“Well, you taught us all those spells fifth year, didn’t you?” Neville said brightly. “Dumbledore’s Army!” He laughed. “I learned more from you than I did from any other Defense professor, hands down.”
, Harry thought. Quidditch was safe. He launched into an overview of the best matches that had happened so far with a feeling of relief. Malfoy listened intently with a small smile on his face, periodically replying with prompts or comments. He even gasped at Harry’s play-by-play of the Hollyhead Harpies’ winning goal against the Lexington Lightnings, and shook his head appreciatively when it was done.
“We’ll take her,” Hermione said as she and Ron rejoined the group, as if Harry wasn’t pressed up against the bars with his wand pointed at Malfoy’s throat. Both Harry and Malfoy looked around.
“It may well be,” Kingsley responded slowly. “At the very least, you would return to serve out the remainder of your sentence here. Another forty-six years, Mr. Malfoy. You would not be a free man again until you were sixty-eight.”
“It’s good to see you, Riley,” Draco said with a smile, grasping the other man’s hand warmly. “I’ve –” he swallowed around a sudden catch in his throat. “I’ve missed you, and this place.”
They came to get him just after dawn: a tall middle-aged witch and a short, round man from the Ministry, flanked by Warden and two stone-faced Azkaban guards. As the guards patted him down, Warden went through a list of things he wasn’t under any circumstances to do, on pain of
“If you say no to this offer, Mr. Malfoy, you will not only be throwing away your own future, miraculously restored to you; you will be spitting in the face of the entire wizarding world. Again.” An onlooker might have thought Kingsley’s voice was kind. “A crime of that magnitude, on top of the crimes already charged against you? I would say that might warrant a second trial, wouldn’t you, Warden?”
Draco had looked back around at him, and was staring at him in disbelief. Harry stepped closer and Draco flinched, nearly imperceptibly.
” Lucius crowed. “And you had no idea, did you Potter? My Imperius spells are nigh undetectable now, and I can maintain oh so many of them at a time. Isn’t dementor power a treat?” He waved his wand airily and Kingsley did a strange little pirouette in the middle of the room. “Say something to our guests, Minister, won’t you?”
Harry pushed his chair back from the table and stood up. “Let’s go,” he said, and grinned at Malfoy’s stunned look. “I’m not kidding—let’s go! What else are you going to do with your first real day of freedom?”
Draco sighed with relief, a smile spreading over his face. Harry smiled back.
Draco stepped back out into the hall, already hoping he could find Harry and share this buoyancy with him. As he walked back toward the living room, however, he noticed that the door to the bedroom that they now shared was slightly ajar.
“Will foster her, yes,” Hermione replied, unfazed. “She’ll have a friend in Rose, we’ve got the space, and our status as war heroes can only help the case.” She paused for a moment as she seemed to realize to whom she was speaking. “That is, if it’s alright with you.”
“What do you want?” he asked sharply. “Here to give me more useless updates on my case?”
Behind Harry, Draco gave a little moan. Harry did not turn around.
“Yeah, I did,” Draco said now. He swallowed hard. “And the Dark—I mean, Vol—” He bit his lip. “He did
But Narcissa had died in childbirth, and Miles had been left with a newborn child and Draco, who had apparently become more and more difficult to live with after his mother died. “He would go into his room for days at a time and we wouldn’t see him at all,” Miles recounted. “Then, suddenly, he would burst out, shouting that I was ruining his life, and try to steal my car keys or something. Viola hated him, always crying when he was around, trying to get away. Of course, he hated her too – seemed like he felt she had killed his mother. And that was even before his drinking problem began to really show itself.”
“How. Dare. You,” she bit out. “You would make demands on your future husband, the hero of our time, before the wedding vows are even exchanged? Is this really how you want to begin your life together? With unreasonable requests, tension already forming, thanks to you?”
“Thank you, Fera,” Kingsley said. Draco thought he detected a hint of annoyance in the Minister’s voice and wondered distantly if his old self would have smiled at that. “That brings to me to my purpose in coming here.” Once again he stopped, seemed to gather his thoughts. This time Warden didn’t say anything. Draco got the impression she was hanging on Kingsley’s every breath. Draco examined the floorboards in minute detail. “The idea has been put forth,” Kingsley began, “that one step to take toward a reunited society could be a personal union to mirror the reunion we hope to see in the wider world. In other words: a marriage between someone who fought against Voldemort and someone who fought for him.”
“It’s not like we’re losing much, though, right?” Draco asked, almost desperately. “I mean, like you said, our marriage has been a sham from the beginning. It was never meant to bring peace, it was meant to make us both miserable. And that –” He shook his head. “Neither of us needs that. Right?”
Harry barked a laugh. “Where on earth did you get that idea, Malfoy? That I’m only interested in shagging you?”
“I guess you can take care of yourself, Mr. Potter,” the other Auror said jovially. “We’ll see you there then.” The two of them moved off, toward the grass where the woman still lay. Harry grabbed Malfoy’s hand again and walked, perhaps a bit more briskly than was necessary, the rest of the way to the carriage.
“Malfoy,” Harry said, then stopped, at a loss. Malfoy didn’t budge.
“Yes.” Draco’s voice was strained, but Harry thought he could see a small smile tugging at the corners of the other man’s mouth. “Thank you for ending the conversation…when you did.”
Still fuming, Harry looked down at Draco, who was shaking his head quickly.
“I’m not fussed that you haven’t been spending as much time with us, mate,” he said, setting his pint down carefully. “I’m a grown adult, not a spoiled little kid, however much my actions might be borderline childish.” He grimaced, and Harry knew this was an apology for how Ron had acted in their apartment. Before Harry could say anything else, Ron was talking again.
They made small talk for another few minutes before excusing themselves and continuing to circulate, leaving Harold Rose scribbling away with an air of slight disappointment.
“What else are you hiding?” he snarled. Draco put his hands up in front of him in a placating gesture. They were shaking.
“The castle looks good, don’t it?” Hagrid asked, stumping toward the entrance to the Great Hall. Looking around at the entrance hall, Draco had to admit that it did. The stone was glowing gold in the morning light, and there were already flowers and leaves adorning many of the walls and staircases.
“I stand by it,” he said with a grin. “Just wait until you try my specialty: banana chocolate chip.”
“Percy heard Kingsley telling another Ministry official that Draco was going to a special holding cell for dangerous criminals until they could set up a trial. He hasn’t been able to find out where the cell is, though, and Kingsley has refused to give further details as a security measure.”
“Ah,” Malfoy said noncommittally. Harry was suddenly very aware of his own tartan pajama pants and threadbare white T-shirt, and busied himself with taking out flour and measuring cups.
Another blast of ice water hit him, and Draco gasped, tugging uselessly at the chains binding his wrists to two huge iron posts set into the basement floor. Lucius had installed these shortly after he had imprisoned Draco: an option for his torturers if they wanted easier access to his body, or wanted, as this one seemed to, to torment him with icy water without electrocuting him fatally. They wanted him alive, it seemed, although Draco wished they would change their minds.
“I got word on your trial,” he said quickly. “July 13. You’ll be notified of the exact time closer to the date.”
They peered into one of the newly-lit windows together. Harry was momentarily afraid that someone inside might see Torey’s bushy black hair peeking over the windowsill, but the people inside were too busy speaking to each other to notice black hair out the dark window. Harry didn’t recognize either of them, but Torey/Hermione gasped.
Ritchie glared at him for another moment, then pushed past him and stalked back to Malfoy’s cell. Malfoy was still crouched on the floor where he had fallen when Ritchie had released him. He was covering his face with his hands.
“You really might not go to Azkaban, Draco. Hermione’s been working on something —”
At some point – it must have been very late – Kingsley had come back and they had Apparated somewhere else. Draco kept counting. He didn’t try to ask Kingsley if Harry was alright. If he was, and he hadn’t come for Draco, it meant something very precious and very fragile had been broken beyond repair, and Draco couldn’t deal with that at the moment. And if Harry wasn’t alright...
The sun had moved several inches by the time he laid the floorplans carefully on the coffee table, stood up, and stretched his arms over his head. His stomach rumbled and Draco headed to the kitchen, meaning to see if any of last night’s dinner was still in the cupboard. He had only gone a few steps, however, when a small black owl flew in through the open living room window. Draco tensed, but forced himself to accept the scroll calmly. If it was from the Minister, he would put it on Harry’s desk. Simple.
a Death Eater,” Malfoy started hesitantly.
, Harry thought grimly.
She was. As soon as Draco stepped through the door, Viola launched herself into his arms and would not let go. They spoke together quietly in rapid Spanglish as Harry helped Hermione set the table. He kept looking over at them with a warm, blossoming feeling in his chest. Draco looked back at him at one point and then quickly away again, blushing.
After the first course was finished, one of the Druids approached their table with a long scroll. Draco remembered this from other weddings he had attended during his childhood – well, mainly he remembered rolling his eyes as the lengthy marriage certificate was read in full, witnessed by everyone in the hall, then signed by the two newlyweds. It was a long time to wait between the first course and the rest of the meal, especially for an eager child. He eyed the scroll in the woman’s hand, hoping that she was a fast reader. His stomach seemed to have woken up after a long sleep.
Harry considered not going back to the cell, making Malfoy wait all night, but he reasoned that if he got the memories tonight then he wouldn’t have to see Malfoy again the next morning and he could get on with the business of getting Viola back to her father with no further ado. Malfoy was still standing at the barred door when he returned. He stood motionless as Harry approached him, wand outstretched. The silvery filaments came quickly from his head, as if he were pushing them out, wrapping around Harry’s wand. He twined them gently into the vial and stoppered the cork.
“I love you,” he replied, and they pulled gently apart. Ron held out his hand and Viola took it. He picked up her small suitcase with the other hand and nodded at Harry. “All right?”
And then it was over. With a jolt, Harry found himself standing once more before the Pensieve, the dark Auror offices quiet around him. He realized he was breathing hard, fists clenched, and there were tears running down his face. He hadn’t even realized he’d been crying.
, he read in his father’s neat hand.
Finally, as they sat together on the floor of the bedroom, Draco told Harry again – in between sips of water – how he had thought that Harry was part of it all, watching him constantly, judging him, finding him wanting, regretting everything. With a guilty rush, Harry remembered his own thoughts from earlier that evening, how he had been regretting marrying Malfoy, but not for the reasons Draco was describing. He also felt a cold rage building in his gut at the idea of Warden, Kingsley, and other Ministry officials talking to Draco without Harry’s knowledge, writing their own stories about his and Draco’s partnership without letting Harry in on it.
“Yes, you do,” Harry said loudly. He stepped back, staring at Draco. “Why are you letting everyone treat you like this? Why aren’t you standing up for yourself? Gods, the Malfoy I knew at Hogwarts wouldn’t ever let people walk all over him like this. He had some self-respect –”
Ritchie glared at him for a moment. “You can’t prove anything,” he snarled suddenly. “It’s his word against mine –”
“Yes, what is it?” he asked irritably, sitting up and turning to face the door. When he saw Harry, his expression hardened. “Ah, Potter. It’s been a while.”
Draco inhaled deeply. Squeezed Harry’s fingers. “So do I,” he said softly.
“What’ll it be?” she asked, smiling at Harry.
“We’ll take care of her, sir, no worries at all,” one of the Aurors said, pushing Harry and Malfoy along. “Got to get you to safety, now don’t we! All’s well, all’s well.”
Luna nodded seriously and stepped back. Harry smiled gratefully at Hermione. “Thank you,” he murmured as she stepped up beside him. She rolled her eyes.
“You can put those down there,” he said, indicating a table beneath a portrait with a nod of his head. “I’d invite you to stay and help me decorate, but I daresay you’ll be wanting to get to class!”
“Or getting blown yourself,” said another, and all three laughed crudely. Feeling like he was grasping at the last straw, Harry followed them.
“You’re incredible,” Harry breathed, and turned back to the house.
life married to a man who hated him, who had every right to hate him...
“A tad unoriginal, isn’t?” Lucius asked mockingly. “But then, Potter, you always were incredibly predictable. I got the idea, of course, from what the Dark Lord did with Sirius Black, and from there it was only a matter of time until you followed one of my people here. And now...” He spread his hands. “You are surrounded, and it is high time, Potter that you bowed to the inevitable and died already.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Still third-wheeling, I see,” he said airily. “Tell me, Potter, have you ever thought of getting a family of your own, or do you plan to leech off of Weasley and Granger for the rest of your life?”
“Oh Draco,” Harry said sadly, and stepped forward and hugged him.
“What?” he asked, his mind clearly still half in the scroll.
Draco’s head snapped up. “My mother saved your life too?” he asked incredulously. “When?”
“Want to try that last bit again, Malfoy?” Ron asked, casually swinging his wand back and forth by his thigh. “Or are you ready to give up the girl and come with us quietly?”
“Malfoy, what alerted your Trace? The day that Ron and I found you and Viola?”
“You’re familiar with the concept, I assume?” he asked with a mocking grin. Draco rolled his eyes.
, she had laughed. Wondering whether his new husband’s silence was disappointment or disdain, Harry couldn’t help but wonder also what kind of an entrance they would make.
All of these little details that reminded Harry, over and over again, that Draco was gone. That he, Harry, had betrayed the fragile trust they had built, and had let Draco be taken from him, and now could not find him, no matter what he and his friends tried.
Harry realized he was staring and shook his head as if to clear it.
He glanced quickly at Draco, whose face had gone ashen. This was clearly news to him as well.
But he stepped back from the bars and sat down on the cot, leaning his head back against the stone and closing his eyes.
The slender wizard, whom Draco had not noticed leaving, returned soon after they sat down with plates of food and a pitcher of wine. Lucius spread the food out on his desk and they ate together, just the two of them. Draco could almost imagine that they were back at the manor, although his mother’s absence was a sharp ache in his chest. He watched his father closely for signs that he was thinking of her, but Lucius took another bite of bread and continued talking about his time in Azkaban.
It turned out that the money clause in the marriage contract was tied to the rest of the marriage contract in its entirety. One clause couldn’t be changed without complicating the rest of the contract, including their actual marriage, which was out of the question. Draco had to give credit where credit was due: someone in the Minister of Magic’s office knew their magical legalities.
Draco leaned forward, hating the way his heart began pounding at Potter’s questioning look. “Excuse me,” he murmured to the Druid, summoning all the deference he could. “Would it be possible for me to get a copy of this?” He swallowed as his courage failed him. “If it’s not too much trouble,” he added hastily. The Druid’s eyes held a question but she nodded. Draco put pen to paper and signed his name, then clasped his hands together beneath the table as she walked away amid the delighted babble of the guests. It was done, witnessed and signed in the traditional two forms. Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed Potter watching him and took a gulp of wine in hopes that the other man wouldn’t demand an explanation for his strange request.
Malfoy shook his head, still not making eye contact. “I’ll be here. At least I think I will.” He looked up briefly, almost disinterested. “Do you happen to know what they plan to do with me now?”
“Draco,” Harry said gently. “Please look at me.”
“Nothing,” he repeated. He leaned back in his chair, suddenly seeming far more relaxed than he had a few moments before, and scooped up another helping of guacamole. “This place is terrible.”
“Shit!” Ron exclaimed, reeling back. “These new interns really need to learn how to temper their message spells.”
Draco’s shoulders tensed but he took a deep breath, seeming to gather himself.
, Harry thought with vicious triumph,
Ron’s grin widened and he stepped fully into the door, leaning comfortably against the frame. “How about the Cradle? I’m dying for some foul Muggle beer.”
it so much?” Ron hissed. His eyes were gleaming, and he didn’t even look up as their waitress approached them again with their appetizer. “His dad tortured my
“You did not,” she responded sternly. “You never sat your NEWTS, and the Battle occurred before you even had a chance to finish your classes. Marrying Mr. Potter-Malfoy is all well and good, but having a diploma is vital for when you begin applying for jobs.”
“What do you want?” he asked again, but the intonation was different.
“Me? What –
“Get away from me, you utter clown,” snapped Draco. He pointed his wand at his head again. “
He instantly regretted it. Warden’s hand flew to her wand and before he could react he felt the curse hit him, twisting his muscles into knots of fire. He let out a pained grunt, barely noticing as she walked across the office to him where he still sat bound to the chair. He noticed, however, when she clasped his chin in her hands and yanked his head up, her cold, furious eyes meeting his.
Harry sat straight up in bed and immediately cried out in pain. Another voice cried out too, to his right.
“All right, P—Harry?” he asked, making as if to rise from his chair.
Draco paused for a moment, holding his own Floo powder and looking around the room. He and Pansy had made this place a home. It wasn’t the upscale flat he and Harry had once shared, but it had been
“Love, I know you’re not with him. I trust you. I promise.” He raised a hand and laid it against Draco’s cheek. “I’m never going to jump to conclusions without talking to you first again.”
Then Warden’s hand struck him across the face. “You will not laugh in Minister Shacklebolt’s face, prisoner,” she spat. “One more display like that and I’ll throw you back in your cell to rot and find someone more suitable to marry Mr. Potter.”
and for what? Because you were too spineless to even be a good Death Eater. Well, let me tell you, boy –” He was advancing on Draco now, and Draco felt himself backing up slowly, wand still raised. “It was Potter who was the key, Potter whom I swore to protect, Potter who had the strength and the courage to do what you could never do. I cared for Potter. I respected Potter. And you?” He looked Draco up and down with a sneer, then spat at him. Draco felt hot spittle strike his cheek and he stumbled backward into a chair. With a gasp, he felt his feet fly out from under him and he sat down hard on the classroom floor, a rushing sound in his ears. Snape – his mentor, his protector, his friend – had never cared for him. It had all been a ruse to stay close to Potter. Potter got everything in the end. Potter deserved everything and he, Draco, he deserved nothing, not even someone who would look out for him –
“Maybe not before, but now, yes. Malfoy. I would’ve believed you.”
He looked up wretchedly at Snape, expecting – deserving – more, but the boggart was changing before his eyes. Draco had a moment to wonder at this. He had never seen a boggart change mid-fright. Then he realized who it was changing to and felt his stomach clench again.
“Listen you –” he snarled, or began to snarl. He didn’t get a chance to finish because then Harry was upon him, wand drawn, lasagna in its Tupperware forgotten on the floor.
“I’m coming!” Pansy shrieked, skidding along the wooden floor in her sheer stockings. She was a vision in a long, pale cream dress. He laughed when he saw her.
“She slept well,” she answered, with a softness in her voice that surprised Harry. “And she and Rose – she’s our daughter – have really taken to each other. She won’t talk to us much, but she ate a good breakfast and she’s with Luna now.”
His tentative optimism did not dissipate in Advanced Charms. Professor Flitwick nodded to him briefly as he came in, but that was his only sign of recognition. The other students in the class – a mixture of Slytherins and Ravenclaws – pointedly ignored him, which was absolutely fine as far as Draco was concerned. Being ignored, as he had learned in Azkaban, was much better than being hurt. This first class of the new year was mainly reviewing theory, which Draco appreciated. It had been quite a while, but everything felt like it was sliding into place around him. In fact, as he walked to the Great Hall for lunch, he reflected that this might be a very good year.
“It’s not for you,” Harry said grimly. “It’s for her. And for every child who’s ever been hurt by the people who were supposed to take care of them.”
Harry expected Malfoy to lash out, but instead the other man snorted a laugh and looked at Hermione appraisingly, a half smile playing at the corners of his mouth. “The brightest witch of our age, ladies and gentlemen,” he said grandly. Then he leaned forward, his face sharpening.
“No, it’s…It’s really nice,” he said quietly, and gave Harry a small, slightly strained smile. “I’m sorry, I’m very tired…”
He remembered sitting in St. Mungo’s with very little memory of how they had all gotten there as Healers bustled in and out. “He’s badly wounded, dehydrated, malnourished, and in shock,” one of the Healers told him when he asked about Draco. “But he’s stable.”
“What did you think about? In Azkaban?” When Malfoy didn’t reply at once, Harry pushed on. “I mean, what did you think about wanting to do? When you got out, I mean. What’s something that you’ve been wanting to do for four years?”
’s latest attempt to stir the pot.” He sank into one of the living room’s other chairs as Harry took a seat beside Draco. Kingsley rubbed his face with both hands and sighed, then looked up at both of them.
...AAAAND then I fucked it all up again :-P Hope you enjoyed the taste of domesticity and loveliness. It'll come back soon, I promise!
Harry didn’t know what to say to that. He took a breath.
“I—I didn’t know that you remembered that,” Draco said quietly. He looked up, searching Harry’s face. “How do you know that I recognized you? I might just have been clueless and thought it wasn’t you at all."
“On par with joining a terrorist organization when you were sixteen because your daddy told you to?” Ron cut in. Draco’s shoulders tensed.
“It’s too late for that, Malfoy,” he said, throwing a grin over his shoulder. “I want to see Draco Malfoy on horseback and that’s all there is to it.” Draco sighed and followed him.
“It just got delivered. Sorry, mate,” Ron said softly, handing him the front page. Harry swallowed hard, prepared for the worst.
But Draco was watching him, his face guarded, clearly waiting for his polite withdrawal to be acknowledged. With a sinking feeling, Harry realized he didn’t even really know how to talk to this man, who had grown up in a manor, had made choices Harry would never understand.
“She learned it from me, Potter,” Malfoy said in what sounded for all the world like fond exasperation. “Now, go on – what did Weasley do?”
“Thank you for coming, Lovegood,” he said sincerely. “How’s the buffet?”
Draco wasn’t here.
Draco nodded and lay back against the pillows. He closed his eyes. “I’ll kick his ass if he tries,” he said, and smiled crookedly. Harry chuckled and rose to leave again.
Nearly an hour passed before Draco gathered himself and sat back on his heels. He told Harry, softly, not meeting his eyes, about how Shaver had been continuing to single him out during Defense classes, how every time he used him as an example for a hex or a jinx, Draco felt like he was back in Azkaban being tortured, powerless to stop it, powerless to do anything but scream. As Harry silently got him a glass of water and tissues, Draco told him about Warden’s threats and Kingsley’s suspicions and feeling like he was constantly on the verge of a misstep that would send him back to prison, wondering how he deserved to have gotten out in the first place.
Malfoy nodded and looked down, his face seeming to close again. When he looked back up, it was back to the expressionless mask.
There was a moment of complete silence. Then Miles
Once he has made up his mind, it was quick work to get out the Pensieve — a smaller version than Dumbledore’s, a newer model— and pour the silvery memories in. Harry took a deep breath, tried not to think about the fact that he was about to essentially stick his head into Draco Malfoy’s brain, and dove in.
He sounded different in Spanish and slightly deeper, rougher, but it was unmistakably Malfoy’s voice. And the child – could it be –?
Harry smiled back, and it was like a second sun had appeared in the sky.
Harry nodded again. Malfoy rolled his eyes, put upon. “Come on then.”
“I will clear my schedule at once, my gallant knight,” he replied, waving airily. “And pine away the hours till we meet again.”
which, according to Draco, actually had some interesting points about a certain potion. Harry hadn’t paid much attention to the details, but he had loved seeing Draco talk about potions with that fire in his eyes. The other man had become so much more comfortable around Harry over the past few weeks, once they had finally talked and he had realized that Harry wasn’t out to get him. Harry drifted towards Draco and Luna, meaning to join their conversation, but he was waylaid by two Ministry officials wanting to wish him well on his new position at Hogwarts. When he looked around again, Luna was talking to Kingsley Shacklebolt and a thin, reedy wizard who Harry vaguely recognized as one of Kingsley’s assistants, and Draco was nowhere to be seen. He must have gone to the bathroom, reasoned Harry, and went to get another plate of food.
“I’m sorry,” Draco said, and Harry could practically see his clenched fists through the table. “What…how…what can I do? Can I do anything?” he asked, a little desperately.
The owl flew away without waiting for a response, and Draco examined the seal on the parchment. His heart leapt. His own name was written neatly about a coat of arms bearing a lion, an eagle, a snake, and a badger. It looked so familiar, so safe—
The comment from that morning hadn’t even been that bad, but it left a lingering foulness in Harry’s mouth that was only exacerbated by the news later in the day that a Ministry covert opps agent had been discovered and tortured by Norwegian dark wizards calling themselves “Neo-Death Eaters.” It was unclear how much of the mission had been compromised. Harry dropped his head into his hands and resigned himself to working late yet again.
They had both looked to him when Hermione mentioned a sponsor, but Harry had shaken his head vehemently.
. Harry had never heard a human being make a noise like that.
?” Ron burst out, apparently no longer able to contain himself. “Harry, he
“Soy Elena,” the woman informed them, ushering them towards a faded purple sofa. “Draco volverá muy pronto. Queréis algo de beber? Comer?”
“You recognized me,” Harry answered firmly. He remembered that moment so well: the fear, the pain on his face, Ron and Hermione tied tightly next to him, Draco leaning down to stare into his eyes. He remembered Draco’s shoulders tightening, had felt sure that death was coming for him at last. Then Draco had shaken his head.
It wasn’t enough. Nothing would ever be enough. Harry headed for the door. He needed some air.
The roar of the crowd met them as they entered: two hundred friends, colleagues, Ministry officials, and celebrities had been invited to this more intimate gathering after the public ceremony. They all stood now among row upon row of tables laden with candlesticks, flowers, sparkling stars, and ivy twining around creamy white plates awaiting food. The soft sounds of a string quartet emanated from the room’s corners, but all eyes were on him and Potter. Draco swallowed hard and hoped he wouldn’t throw up.
They didn’t speak again until Harry plopped a plate of steaming pancakes down onto the table, flanked by a pat of butter and a small jug of maple syrup.
“I haven’t yet had the opportunity to congratulate you, Mr. Malfoy-Potter,” she said, clasping his hand in both of hers. “It is a joyful time indeed.”
“And the Weasl—I mean, Ginny—she’s on the team now?” he asked incredulously. Harry nodded.
Harry nodded. For a moment, neither of them spoke. Then Harry said: “Friends?”
“Just—please don’t feel like you always have to defend me,” Draco said finally, and bit off a piece of tandoori chicken.
Harry was tired.
The only other people in the room were Lucius and Torey/Hermione. This was their chance. Harry could hear Torey’s labored, terrified breathing. Slowly, Harry raised his wand.
Malfoy scoffed and stepped back from the bars until he was sitting on the narrow cot. “I know, I know, I’m going to Azkaban. Very original, Potter. This must be hugely satisfying for you.” He lay down, facing the wall, and Harry left without another word.
“I see a Death Eater menacing the Chosen One,” said the first student, nearly spitting with rage, at the same time as the second one said: “We’re Gryffindors. Of
They approached the front door, watching for any signs of movement, but there were none. After a long moment, Ron shrugged and rang the doorbell. It echoed inside for a long moment.
Harry took off his glasses and rubbed his face absently. He hadn’t been sleeping well. In the brief time he and Draco had been sleeping together, he had become accustomed to having someone else in bed with him. To having his husband in bed with him. His stomach clenched.
He cursed himself for awkwardness – when had he forgotten how to talk to people? Then again, how did you thank someone for being your required joining ritual witness when every member of your family was either dead, imprisoned, or not speaking to you? How did you acknowledge that someone had risked their reputation to stand next to you at a public ceremony, without seeming too dramatic?
…Draco resolutely pushed that thought away. There was no time. He needed someone who knew medical magic, and who might listen to his explanation before immediately contacting the Ministry. A face flashed into his mind, improbable but possible. Where was the Floo powder?
Draco froze. His entire body seemed to tense, like the air right before a storm. Harry didn’t know what to say, so he didn’t say anything. He just held him, for long moments.
“Yes,” Draco responded, a small smile tugging at the corners of his mouth as if at some private joke. “Good to take things one step at a time.”
“Five galleons,” he said helpfully, thinking perhaps Draco hadn’t heard Madam Malkin’s request. Draco nodded.
Harry cursed inwardly. “Yes,” he said viciously. “What, did you think they’d offer parole to a convicted Death Eater?”
“Torey Edwards, at your service,” Torey/Hermione said, inclining his head. “I work in Accounting and am always leaving little bits of mustache hair on my desk.”
Draco looked oddly grateful as he nodded. “Of course not. When works for you?”
“Mr. Hathaway,” Harry began. “We’ve found your daughter and taken Draco Malfoy into custody –”
“All finished,” it said in Elias Cho’s smiling voice. Harry took a deep breath and headed back to the cells.
This was more food than he had
“Granger,” he acknowledged with a sharp nod. “Your hair is looking much better these days.”
“Dear friends,” Mr. Weasley began, stepping up between them and spreading his arms wide as if he wanted to embrace the garden, the crowd, the evening. “It is such a joy to be with you tonight, to join in the eyes of the Old Ones and the Grove’s Kin my daughter, Ginevra Weasley, and her beloved, Luna Lovegood...”
“Yes. Yes of course.” He shook his head as if to clear it. “It’s just – does Madam Rosmerta still...?” He trailed off, and Harry nodded slowly as realization hit him.
, Harry reflected, looking over the notes from their interview with Miles.
“Para empezar,” she said, smiling and gesturing to the food. “Comemos más con Draco.”
“Maybe we won’t be married anymore, but can we still be friends?”
“...Can take Rose,” Hermione was saying to someone as she rushed past him. “I need to take the cake out of the oven, and
Harry met Kingsley’s eyes. “And I think
She seemed to deflate, air leaving her lungs with an indignant
“Of course, I am available any time you like,” he said formally, turning back to his scrolls and parchment. Harry felt a twist in his gut and hoped he didn’t sound too desperate when he said – “Let’s go now then!”
Draco felt several pairs of eyes on him. He kept his own eyes fixed on the floor.
2. Trans rights. Trans rights. Trans rights.
“I…but I finished my seventh year,” Draco stammered. She couldn’t have forgotten.
, I want to see you again so badly.” He squeezed his eyes shut. “I’m so selfish, it’s such a selfish thing to want, because you’re far better off without me. I don’t want you, because I want you to have someone else, someone better, someone – someone
He never knew, for example, how he had gotten from his position lying among formerly-Imperiused wizards to kneeling beside Draco’s fallen form. Suddenly, he was just there, cradling Draco’s head in his lap and snarling “Stay away” when anyone tried to get too close. When the Healers arrived, he remembered Hermione leading him away. Ron, Neville, and Ginny crowded around him, and Luna held his hand as they watched a Healer examine Draco, her brow furrowing. Everything else – the dozens of wizards coming out from under the Imperius curse, Kingsley conferring with Hermione in low voices, Aurors dealing with Lucius – all of that happened in the background, slightly blurry to Harry’s mind.
“I understand, of course,” he said quietly, and Harry wanted to hit himself.
It went on like this, working back through time. Viola got smaller and smaller and more and more vocal and happy. Malfoy, too, got louder and snarkier, and his face filled out so that it was merely narrow and chiseled instead of gaunt. Harry knew he was seeing starvation and abuse in reverse.
Elias wrinkled his brow and glanced at Draco. “Do you have any idea why he wants her back so badly? From what you’ve told me, he resented her presence in his life.”
Harry pushed back from the desk and rubbed his eyes wearily. It was a strange, unsettling feeling, knowing that Malfoy was up to something but having
The owl flew off into the night, leaving Harry lost in thought. He headed back out to the kitchen, meaning to apologize for bringing up Narcissa in the first place, but Draco had moved to the couch and was perched on the edge, his eyes downcast.
She and Hermione ducked behind a wall while Harry threw the invisibility cloak over himself. Not a moment too soon: in the next instant, none other than Colin Fairchild himself turned the corner. He glanced over his shoulder, clearly trying to look casual and failing miserably. From where he was standing, Harry could hear him muttering.
“Saving your
“Ron, it’s something I agreed to do because I thought it would help,” Harry said, a little desperately.
It was time for the send-off.
“It is,” Harry agreed solemnly. “I hope the rest of our food comes soon – I’m starving.”
He had to move. With a light touch on Potter’s arm, Draco excused himself and walked, somewhat blindly, toward a side hallway that he hoped held the bathrooms. He fancied he could feel their eyes on his retreating back, and kept himself from running toward the exit only with an extreme exertion of willpower. Only when the hallway’s dimness – startling after the brightly-glowing hall – had encompassed him and he had shut the door of the men’s room behind him did he let himself relax.
He was just starting to gather his things when a tentative knock at his door made him look around. Ron Weasley’s unruly mop of bright red hair was peeking around the doorframe – Ron’s eyes tentative beneath it.
“I have heard that, yes,” Draco said seriously. “And I’ve also heard that sometimes friendships blossom into incredible romances where both people are equal members of the union from the beginning, and respect and mutual trust abound.”
Draco clenched his fists and breathed out.
It ended with the wave of four wands, and bands of metal that appeared around their ring fingers – Malfoy’s a pure silver inscribed with curling snakes, Harry’s a dark bronze with leaves cut into the metal. Then they were walking hand in hand, this time down one of the other paths that led toward another door that took them back out into the midsummer afternoon and into a cacophony of voices, shouts, cheers, and ringing bells. Flowers filled the air and songbirds burst from the ends of wands to fly above their heads. Harry heard Hermione’s laughter and Ron’s gruff voice close to his ear: “Congratulations, mate.” He turned to give his friend a smile but they were already making their way toward the line of port keys arranged in the field that would take select guests to the reception. He would see them soon, he knew.
“Ah, yes. You work for the Ministry of Magic…?” Malfoy was looking at him inquisitively, and Harry realized with a start that he had no idea how much, if anything, Malfoy knew about him anymore.
Without letting himself think too much about what he was about to do, Harry folded Draco into a large hug and pressed a lingering kiss to his cheek. He felt the other man tense, then immediately relax into the embrace, his surprise at the kiss betrayed only by a light gasp.
“That’s very sweet, Malfoy, but it’s not just you we want,” drawled Ron. He drew the wand out of his pocket just enough to allow Malfoy to see it. “Where’s Viola?”
The carriage stopped before one of the grove’s entrances. Harry knew there were three other entrances spaced evenly around the circular structure, and guessed that Malfoy’s carriage would be pulling up to the entrance directly across from him. He had never actually been to a traditional British wizard wedding before – Bill and Fleur’s had been much more in the French style, which was closer to Christian Muggle weddings – but Ron and Hermione had filled him in, Ron drawing on personal knowledge and Hermione drawing on her extensive research.
“You do,” Draco replied, and kissed her on the cheek. She swatted him away.
Malfoy didn’t respond, but the flash of realization in his eyes was answer enough. Miles chuckled darkly as he came fully into the kitchen.
, he thought savagely.
“Ron,” Hermione hissed. “Draco also called me to
“The party?” he asked in a small voice. “That wasn’t to test me?”
For their part, Harry and Ron mostly stayed in the sitting room.
“Draco,” Harry said, a breath, a relief. “I’m glad you’re still awake. I – I have something I need to say.”
“Come, Draco. Sit.” Lucius moved back behind the desk and motioned to a chair set before him. “There is much to discuss.”
Harry exchanged a look with Ron and saw his own anguish mirrored in his friend’s eyes. Hesitantly, Ron reached out and patted the crying man on the back.
“What can I do?”
“I heard you and Elias. After – um – after Viola’s trial,” Harry shot back, suddenly feeling like a huge creep. “Um...were you not –?”
He did not have to wonder long. Just as he opened the large refrigeration cabinet to see what there was for breakfast, he heard the bedroom door swing open. Harry took a deep breath, grabbed an opened bottle of pumpkin juice, and made sure he was smiling as he turned around. “Good morning,” he said brightly, waving the bottle vaguely in Malfoy’s directly as he reached for two cups. “Sleep alright?”
He did so, and felt a thread of coolness slide
Ron was looking at him pointedly, and Harry finally nodded.
No, there was a light on beneath the bedroom door. Harry knocked hesitantly, unsure of his welcome, but the door swung open immediately. Draco was standing behind it, still wearing the clothes he had been in that afternoon. His hair was wild, though, as if he had run his hands through it over and over. His eyes were fixed on the floor.
“When?” Harry growled and Draco flinched.
“And what do you want me to do about that?” Malfoy snapped suddenly, his eyes blazing. “Keep entertaining you on your lunch breaks for another month before I’m thrown in Azkaban for kidnapping?”
to what I say –” He broke off. Swallowed hard. “Then I don’t think this marriage will work.”
Suddenly, the dragon swooped down and began encircling them ever more tightly. Harry could also see one of the phoenixes and several merpeople, whose protruding eyes looked even stranger in the flickering candlelight. Everything else was obscured in mist, the din of the guests receding by the minute. It was just him and Malfoy in a swirling world of sparkling fog –
Harry had essentially been on vacation for nearly a month.
He dropped to the floor, trying to make sense of what he had just read.
“That’s a nice idea, Minister,” Draco said quietly, eyes still fixed on the floor. “Why are you telling me?”
Draco took a deep breath and lowered the letter to the bed. It was folly, pure and piercing, to keep this letter. If he was discovered with a letter from an Azkaban prisoner (and how had Lucius even gotten the letter out of Azkaban in the first place?), to say nothing of a former Death Eater, he didn’t imagine even Harry would be able to keep him from people like Weasley. Hell, Harry would probably put him back in Azkaban himself. Draco harbored no illusions about the nature of their relationship. Potter was kind, considerate, attentive – but only because he had to be. There were appearances to keep up.
“I’d say that warrants investigating,” Harry grinned. “Luna, Neville: you’re both incredible. Now, does anyone feel like a sandwich?”
“Get out of here, rat. I have to piss.”
“I didn’t want Oliver to get in trouble! Sure, he was a tough kid to understand sometimes, but I had grown fond of the boy. And he did look so like his mother.” Miles had signed and dabbed at his eyes with a handkerchief. “I thought he would bring her back. I kept trying to reach out to him to let him know I still loved him and nothing bad would happen to him, but he never responded. Finally, I’d had enough, went to the authorities in Madrid. They told me that he’s actually a war criminal, and that’s when you two got involved. My Viola! Kidnapped by a Death Eater!” And he had broken down crying again. They hadn’t been able to get anything else useful out of him.
do, even though you hate me. You could be here, because you’re you. But you can’t be here, because I’m me. It’s me. I’m not –” He gulped. Tried again. “I’m beyond saving.”
He did want an explanation, though.
“You do?” Both Ron and Draco spoke in unison. “Why?” That was Ron.
“It really only started getting good recently,” Lucius mused. “Although you two have fairly boring pillow talk. Sickening, really. I began to realize that Potter really seemed to be falling for my disappointing son, though, and that gave me my best idea yet.”
“Not if I have anything to say about it,” Harry shot back. He grabbed Draco’s hand again. “Stay close.”
In which Harry and Ron have an overdue conversation.
in the first place.”
Malfoy fell back a step, but his eyes narrowed in confusion. “Hold on —
Harry stepped quickly back. Draco’s expression was unreadable, but he followed Harry into the Three Broomsticks with only a moment’s hesitation. It was, indeed, quite empty. The only other inhabitants were several students studying in a corner, two old witches chatting over mugs, and Clara the barmaid polishing glasses behind the bar.
It had felt difficult to concentrate on things during his sixth year of Hogwarts, too.
“Because I always know what you’re going to say, Potter,” he said, sounding bored. There was nothing bored about his eyes, though, trained avidly on Harry’s lips.
As soon they mounted up, Draco realized that Potter, for all his famed talents at battling evil wizards and defeating the Dark Arts, was a terrible horseback rider. Draco hadn’t doubted that the other man had never ridden, but he was unprepared for Potter’s utter and complete lack of either bodily coordination or the ability to follow shouted instructions. They must have made a comical pair, Draco reflected: he and Lady circling Potter and Lancelot, with him giving tips and instructions and Potter doing nearly the exact opposite.
Harry put up a hand, nodded. “I know. And I promise you this, Malfoy.” He stepped closer. “Miles will
Bogrod bustled off, his eyebrows nearly disappearing over the round top of his bald head. Harry sat back with a sigh.
He signed a few papers in the dim front office and Warden handed him a wand. It wasn’t his wand, of course—that had been lost after the Battle of Hogwarts—but at least it was something, even if it did include a special tracking spell that would let the Ministry see every spell he cast until they decided he had earned back society’s trust (Warden’s words). Then he was walking out of the massive iron gates between the two Ministry employees: a free man.
“I don’t remember the last time I’ve been able to meet someone new and
Harry woke slowly. Light stung his eyes, so he squeezed them shut. After a while, the light was less bright. He opened his eyes carefully, ready to snap them shut again if needed.
As he approached the door, though, he heard voices raised in laughter: Elias Cho. Harry stopped in his tracks.
He broke off, suddenly afraid he would start crying. Draco’s face, drawn and pale, seemed to hover in front of him. Draco’s shoulders, tensing as if to protect himself. Draco’s hands, trembling.
Lucius nodded, clearly delighted. “Oh yes, I’ve been planning it for years. At first, I assumed that once I got Draco out of Azkaban, he would work tirelessly for my release and I wouldn’t have to resort to such underhanded measures. That didn’t end up happening, though, did it, Draco?” His face clouded over with anger and he made a sudden motion with his hand toward Draco, who flinched back violently. “So weak. Such a disappointment,” Lucius said sadly. Then he seemed to remember his story. “I still wanted a spy in Potter’s house, though, which is where my letters came in. They were charmed, you see.” He twirled his wand between thumb and forefinger while the Imperiused witches and wizards watched in silence. “Delightful little eavesdropping spells, but not very useful when my son was sleeping alone.” He sighed again and Draco shifted uncomfortably next to Harry.
He wasn’t sure what prompted him to ask the next question—perhaps some small vestige of his former life, when things like this wouldn’t have happened. Or maybe the illusion that since he seemed to be important again, they couldn’t hurt him. “Is it possible for me to see Mr. Potter before the ceremony?”
“Really? Malfoy?” he had asked.
. He would not think about Crabbe’s screams. He would not think about the scorching heat against his skin. He would not think at all.
After the first disorienting moments of falling through space and time, Harry landed hard and looked around. He was standing on a deserted street corner in what felt like the middle of the night. A moment later, he recognized it as the corner of Miles’s street in Madrid. There was the small bar where he and Ron had gotten lunch the first day they interviewed Miles. The fact that it was closed now indicated that it was very, very late.
Draco turned back to him, eyebrows raised.
. Draco couldn’t make his brain work. People were staring at him. Someone on the other side of the classroom tittered.
“How to defend myself, sir,” he said finally, feeling a small surge of satisfaction at the barely-perceptible widening of the other man’s eyes.
Harry nodded as the man looked up at them tearfully. “We’ll get her back for you,” he said firmly. “That’s a promise.”
Then the scene changed and Harry was standing in Miles’s flat. He was confused, briefly, because it looked like Miles was standing over a pile of dirty laundry and yelling at it. He kicked it and it grunted. Harry realized with horror that the pile of dirty laundry was actually a person. It was Malfoy, lying curled at Miles feet, clearly trying to protect his face by burying his head in his arms. Miles kicked him again. “Fucking Death Eater faggot,” he said spat. “I know you’re hiding money from me. I know you are! Tell me where it is.” He was holding a bottle, the brown glass shining in the light of the one lightbulb.
“After...after Christmas,” he said, his voice trailing off at the end. Behind Harry, Kingsley snorted inelegantly and Draco flinched again, although his eyes remained fixed on Harry.
He pushed open the bedroom door. “Kingsley, what’s going on?”
Potter’s genuine smile was like a flash of sunlight peeking out from behind clouds. He chuckled warmly. “She’s really something, isn’t she?”
Malfoy’s eyes widened. “How — What do you want with Viola?”
“Old friends – um, that is, from school – ah...” Ron trailed off, gesturing helplessly.
Kingsley nodded. “It’s not pleasant,” he replied, also quiet now. “When you broke the egg, it broke the spells, but all that power had to go somewhere. It seems to have all channeled back into Lucius Malfoy at the same time, which is an enormous amount of magical stress on any one person. He...” Kingsley hesitated momentarily. “He won’t be doing magic again, that much I can tell you. It’s possible he won’t wake up again either.” He spread his hands. “I don’t know more than that, but I will ensure that you stay informed, if you want to be.”
A smaller note fluttered onto the bedspread, and Draco picked it up, confused. It was a personalized note from the headmistress herself.
With a sigh that was nearly a sob, Draco bent forward into his father’s arms.
“She hired Clara a few years back to deal with serving. Rosmerta usually sticks to the books now, unless things get really busy. She was never quite right after –”
An uneven square of early afternoon sunlight crept wearily across the floor by Draco’s feet. It looked like he felt: insubstantial, immaterial, trapped in a slow progression through space. He shook his head, amused at his own sour thoughts. Here he was, sitting on a comfortable couch in a light, bright, well-appointed flat that was, in some ways at least, his own. He wasn’t chained in a cell, or being forced to perform horrendous acts under threat of personal or familial harm. He was free, at least in theory.
idea where he was. It made Harry miss Hogwarts. Back then, Malfoy had always been just across the Great Hall, or at least visible on the Marauder’s Map.
horse.
Draco found Harry’s hand and grasped it tightly. He squeezed once and felt Harry squeeze back. He wondered if Harry was thinking of their own wedding – the one they had already had, or perhaps the one they might have someday, if they decided that was something they wanted to do. Who knew what the future would bring?
Draco did not run. He did not scurry, or bow his head. He walked, slowly and calmly, to the door and let it swing closed behind him. He walked carefully down the hallway until he found a shadowed alcove a few feet from the hall’s mouth. Then, and only then, did he let himself press his back against the wall and close his eyes, taking deep breaths and wishing he could sink into the floor.
“None of your concern, Mr. Malfoy,” Riley said quietly. “Everything will be alright.”
“Nope,” Harry said happily. “It’s Sunday, and Kingsley gave me a few days off so we could get settled in anyway. Anything else we have to do, we can do tomorrow.”
Before Potter could say anything, however, the second course appeared before them, signaling the beginning of the receiving line. Sure enough, several people were already approaching their table, headed by a small man in brilliant purple robes.
the rest of the wizarding world. Now he knew that Harry was on his side.
They decided that Hermione would stay out in the dark grounds while Harry went in under the Invisibility Cloak to get the lay of the land. “If you need me, shoot red sparks out a window,” Hermione said as she checked to make sure the cloak was covering him completely. “I’ll be circling the house, watching for it.”
After a long moment, Ron sighed and shook his head, but Hermione stood and clasped Harry’s hand. “We know you do, Harry,” she murmured. “And we’ll be right beside you.”
“Hermione told me they all say the same thing,” Harry said, remembering the hurried conversation the morning before the wedding. There had been so much to go over, the contract had seemed like the least of his worries. “Everything was happening so fast—I didn’t think it was that important to read.”
“All right, Malfoy?” he asked quietly, leaning solicitously toward him for the benefit of their guests. Draco nodded quickly and found he didn’t have to go so deep for a smile this time.
The bathroom was empty. Draco shut the door behind him and waved his wand, muttering “Lumos” under his breath. The end of his wand flickered and sparked, but settled into a warm glow a moment later. Draco checked his reflection out of habit, and saw with relief that his make-up spell was still holding. He had taken to using it every day, but was always slightly concerned that it wouldn’t last the full day, especially with his wand behaving more and more erratically.
“She didn’t deserve that,” he cut in quickly. “Even if she — even if she
Malfoy was regarding him with what seemed to be apprehension. Harry snapped his mouth shut. “Sorry,” he said sheepishly. “I’m just impressed whenever anyone looks like a human being before noon on a Sunday.”
“I still would’ve kicked his arse,” Harry said with a grin. “Somehow I can’t really picture that git singing.”
“We will,” Ron agreed. His mouth quirked up in a crooked grin. “Unless Malfoy’s right beside you. Then, I’ll be standing as far away as I can while still in range to curse him if he tries anything.”
Harry finally came back to himself beside a large lake. At some point, mist had come down, or drifted up from the earth, and it seemed as if he were the only person in the whole world. A small wooden bench faced out over the water. Harry sank down gratefully, casting a wordless warming charm. He wondered what time it was. He wondered where Draco was. He wondered if Draco hated him even more now, and put his head in his hands with a low moan.
“Actually, Ron, I haven’t been talking about work or the news at meals much at all, these days,” he said quietly, realizing the truth of his words as he said them. “I don’t like to bring it up when Malf—when Draco is around.”
Malfoy’s eyes widened. “Lovegood?” he breathed. “She won’t – will she –?”
“Do you host gatherings like this often, then?” Rose asked with practiced nonchalance. “I would assume, Mr. Malfoy, that you would be very busy with schoolwork, and that Mr. Potter would be busy with other projects…?”
“Let me make one thing quite clear, Mr. Malfoy,” Kingsley said softly. “This is a marvelous opportunity for you, but you are not yet a free man. You may never be a free man, for you are not coming to this marriage as his equal. He is the Boy Who Lived, the hero who saved us all. You, on the other hand, are the defeated, the broken Death Eater, the enemy. You will be the one who will have to demonstrate what you can bring to the wizarding world, after tearing it apart. You will be publicly atoning for the sins of multiple generations, and you will have everything to prove. And everything to lose.”
“Well, because you’re my husband,” Harry answered slowly, seeming to think deeply about the answer. “And because I can tell you’ve changed. You’re out of Azkaban, this marriage saw to that. Why should you keep being punished?”
“That’s wonderful! I wondered if she would ask you. I went back for another year after the war, and so did Ron, Hermione – a lot of us.” Potter stopped quickly, clearly realizing that the year he was talking about had been Draco’s first year in Azkaban. But Draco nodded quickly, moving them both past it.
“I’m in love with you,” Harry said, before he quite knew that he would. As soon as he said it, though, he knew it was true. Bone-deep. Miraculous.
“Ah, Mr. Malfoy,” he said smoothly. “Perhaps you would care to explain why you have been corresponding with a convicted criminal and hiding his responses in your closet?”
Harry swallowed the words that wanted to come out – wild words like “You are beautiful,” and “Please laugh again,” words that couldn’t be allowed to emerge. “She loves you so much,” he said instead, and Malfoy ducked his head, no longer laughing.
“Nothing,” he said quickly, glaring up at the oaf challengingly. “I’m just here to finish my seventh year.” He swallowed hard, knowing that if Hagrid accused him of anything untoward, his year was over before it began.
Draco supposed it was revenge for his Weasley slight. He had promised himself he wouldn’t ever mention Azkaban—after all, it wasn’t like he had grounds for complaint. He was a Death Eater. He couldn’t look for pity, and he didn’t want Potter to feel like he was asking for it.
He’d thought he was getting into some kind of rhythm – getting numb to it all, perhaps, or at least progressively deeper into his wine – when he saw long blond hair floating towards their table. The last time he had seen that hair, it had been flying behind Luna Lovegood as she battled Death Eaters in the halls of their school.
He did. “Eat good food,” Malfoy said quietly. “See the sun low in the sky. We were only allowed outside at noon,” he added quickly, seeing Harry’s questioning look. “It’s been four years since I’ve seen a sunrise or a sunset. Ride horses, listen to music—”
“Potter. How – how is Viola?”
Malfoy sagged, his eyes closing briefly. “Thank you.”
“Hay gente aquí para ti, cariño,” Elena said, suddenly very close to the door, and then the door swung open and Malfoy stepped through it. He stopped, his eyes flicking back and forth between Harry and Ron, and Harry saw his hand spasm briefly, as if about to grasp a wand that was no longer there. His face was an unreadable mask.
“What are you talking about?” he asked, a note of desperation creeping into his own voice. “I mean, I’m happy to pay for things for you, of course, but don’t you have your own money?”
, Harry thought with fierce satisfaction. The other man was indeed watching him, had not moved from his place at the table. Slowly, he raised both hands.
He left Harry lying on the ground for long moments as he scrambled to grab a handful of the powder from an urn beside the fireplace. “Incendio,” he whispered, and lit a fire in the grate. There was so little time.
It was mid-afternoon, sunlight streaming into the kitchen. Malfoy was standing at the stove, stirring something in a sauce pan. A much younger Viola sat at his feet, playing with a ratty stuffed lion. “Does Admiral Covington want any pasta?” Malfoy asked Viola seriously. She looked at the lion, then at Malfoy, and shook her head solemnly. “Ok,” Malfoy agreed easily. “Would you like any pasta?” He looked over his shoulder quickly as he said it —
They walked quickly down the hall and up the stairs, Draco tugging on Harry’s hand to direct him to Lucius’s office. Harry was sure their feet must be visible beneath the cloak, but they didn’t pass anyone else.
That day’s check-in, as usual, had been disappointingly brief. It was maddening, Harry reflected, to know exactly what information you needed – where Draco had been taken – and to be so thoroughly stymied on every front. If Kingsley knew of any kind of timeline for Draco’s trial, he was keeping it to himself, giving the excuse of lowering the possibility of press and publicity. No other Ministry employees knew, or admitted to knowing, anything.
Harry held up a hand and she stopped abruptly, watching him.
“Not an equal member –” Harry began, utterly lost. “Send you
“I think these memories will be important in the case against him,” Harry said slowly. “Do you mind if I come back for them tomorrow?”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “It’s not my fault your cooking skills leave so much to be desired,” he snapped, but Harry noticed his eyes were slightly softer. Wordlessly, he filled a cup with water with a quick
They hired a lawyer whom Hermione knew from school. Elias Cho was charming, likeable, and completely single-minded when it came to children’s custody cases, according to Hermione. “He’s about as far from a Malfoy as you can get. He’ll be perfect.”
he thought bitterly.
“Hola!” she said seriously, waving from the doorway. “Soy Viola, mucho gusto.”
Narcissa was pale and drawn in the next one too, but standing tall and straight before a judge who was muttering in Spanish. Miles was holding both her hands, looking delighted, and Draco stood behind her, his face an expressionless mask. Then Narcissa was bending over Malfoy, who was lying on the ground under a bridge, shivering and sweaty. A man’s voice, Miles: “Do you need any help, my dear?” And Narcissa looked around, her face lifting with terrible hope.
know,” he began, “that we don’t actually like the idea of parading ourselves around in front of reporters and that it’s our
“That’s interesting,” Ron drawled. “Who’s that then?”
Harry and Torey/Hermione reached the Manor’s front doors without incident. Harry could see Torey/Hermione trembling. He was sure they would encounter some kind of anti-intrusion spell at any moment, but so far there had been nothing. Under the Invisibility Cloak, he peered into the darkness. The Manor looked deserted, dark and forbidding against the night sky, blotting out the stars.
“Mr. Malfoy,” Shaver said softly. Slowly, Draco looked up. Shaver was holding out a hand to him, as if offering to help him up off the floor. Draco shook his head silently and stood up slowly on his own. Shaver watched placidly as he picked his wand up off the floor where it had fallen and walked back to the desk where his bag was still stowed.
, then I don’t know what to tell you, except that you must not know me well at all.”
and I was only doing what’s mine to do –”
“Sorry it’s a mess, I can clean up some tomorrow,” he finished, somewhat defensively, then cursed his own inability to stop talking. Malfoy still hadn’t said anything, and Harry found it impossible to tell what he was thinking behind that pale, expressionless face. Judging him, judging his house, probably. At least you could always count on Malfoy for that. Harry was just about to say something else – he had no idea what – when Malfoy finally spoke.
“I – Harry – I mean, Potter – you – I’m—” He twisted his hands together miserably. “Gods above and below, I’m so sorry—”
He was running through these questions in his head as he opened the door, and was slightly disappointed to see that the living room was empty. It was late. Perhaps the other man had gone to sleep.
Harry was completely lost.
Severus Snape was standing before him, shaking his head and muttering to himself. Draco had a fleeting moment of confusion and looked around. Was the boggart seeing someone else? Shaver seemed thrown off as well. He looked back and forth between Draco and the boggart, and moved to stand.
“No, no, please Malfoy, teach me how to do magic! Otherwise I might just —” He mimed nearly dropping the vial and catching it at the last second. “Oops!”
“No. No, you don’t talk,” he said firmly, and suddenly his words were not slurred at all. Draco breathed in carefully, his eyes never leaving Weasley’s face.
“You weren’t so bad yourself,” Malfoy replied, his voice unmistakably
“Sorry,” he said quickly. “I’ll answer this in the study. You don’t have to worry about it.”
. Potter was alive. Potter made him dinner sometimes. Voldemort was dead. Draco knew this, he
Harry felt like someone had punched him in the gut. He knew that he and Draco weren’t married, not in a real, emotional way, anyway. He knew they weren’t even really friends. It made sense that his lifelong enemy wouldn’t want to discuss his dead mother, or the terrors he had experienced in prison. Harry had overstepped.
“Nothing,” Ron said slowly. “I’ve just never seen you look like this before.”
“Neville,” Harry said, hoping he sounded better than he felt. “I’m – fine, I’m just –” He cast around for an explanation and came up empty. “Resting,” he said finally. He looked back at Neville, suddenly confused. “What are you doing here?”
“Touching,” drawled Lucius. “But I’m afraid your time is up, Potter.” The door banged open and more dementors poured in, followed by dozens of other witches and wizards: all the other people Harry had seen in the house that night, along with several others who had arrived more recently, he guessed. Bringing up the rear was:
Somehow, the prospect of a Diagon Alley trip seemed to make Harry’s next day go by much more easily. Ron was out of the country, meeting with a group of Russian Aurors in Switzerland’s neutral territory, so Harry didn’t even have to worry about their next awkward encounter. He realized, with a sinking feeling, that he was starting to dread seeing his best friend.
“Ah,” Harry said lamely. “I guess there wouldn’t be.” He felt like he was tiptoeing across thinning ice, knowing that the wrong move could be disastrous. They had to live together, after all.
Even Hermione’s warnings had not prepared Harry for the din that ensued as the Druids’ song grew louder and faster, guests began banging fists on the tables, and misty magical creatures erupted from the floral centerpieces. A cloudy dragon soared overhead, flanked by two phoenixes and a unicorn. Farther down the hall, merpeople swam through the air, hair billowing around their heads as if immersed in water. The rafters of the hall were nearly invisible through a thick cloud of pixies and owls, which were hooting in time to the Druids’ song.
“Yes, ma’am,” Draco responded quietly, following her towards the back where mirrors lined the walls. Harry perused the shelves, not wanting to intrude as the magical tape measure flitted back and forth and Madam Malkin wrote quick notes in a ledger. Before long, Draco was walking back toward him, hands full of a paper-covered bundle, and Madam Malkin was beaming from behind the counter.
, Harry thought suddenly.
Malfoy’s thin, tired face wouldn’t leave his mind for the rest of the day, though, and neither would his words. “
Defense Against the Dark Arts was next. Much as Draco was dreading that class, he found himself unwilling to stay in the Great Hall a moment longer than was necessary, and left as soon as he had eaten what he could stomach of lunch. He could always find a spot to sit and wait until class began, he reasoned. A broad window ledge a few halls away from the classroom was blessedly empty, and he curled up against the window frame, hoping that no one would pass him.
“I think the state was paying him some kind of child support,” Malfoy replied. “At least, I remember him getting checks in the mail sometimes, getting all gleeful and talking about going to the bank. If I had to guess, I’d say that someone finally figured out Viola was gone and stopped sending him that money. That explains why he’s so desperate. He could never hold onto money.”
“Oh – yes, of course,” she replied, seeming to catch herself. She turned to Draco; Harry could practically see each piece of her smiling mask reassemble itself. “Right this way, Mr. Malfoy. Slytherin colors, I assume?”
In the end, the party came together very quickly. It felt like Draco blinked, and suddenly he was no longer sitting stiffly on the edge of Harry’s couch, but standing stiffly with his hand on Harry’s arm, greeting party guests with what he hoped looked like a real smile. Every so often, Harry would look over at him with a brilliant smile of his own, squeezing his hand or leaning over to press a quick, chaste kiss to his cheek. Each time he did, Draco felt his heart beat a little faster.
“Malfoy,” he said tenderly. Draco closed his eyes again, his jaw tight. “Draco,” he said again. “Please look at me.”
– and counted.
“Why the fuck would he care, Potter?” Malfoy asked, opening his eyes again and staring at him in confusion. “I certainly can’t afford to hire my own lawyer. I assumed the Ministry would provide some hack who would pretend to try to get me off and get paid a little extra to do a bad job.”
She broke off. Harry felt several emotions warring for prominence in his gut.
“I’m a friend, Mr. Malfoy, to you and to your dear mother,” Riley said firmly. “Just sit quietly now, and soon we can notify the Minister that Harry Potter has died in a tragic accident. Horses can be so unpredictable, can’t they—”
“You?” The shock in Malfoy’s voice was palpable. “You’ll – you’re saying that you and Weasley –”
Harry shut his eyes with a groan, trying to block out the light that seemed to be sending tiny daggers into his skull. He hadn’t been conscious of drinking that much last night, but the hangover was definitely present.
“Oh, alright,” he said finally, and Harry signed in exaggerated relief. “But you can’t ever wink at me like that in public again.”
Bogrod re-entered the room with several pages of parchment covered in spidery writing. He explained the changes quickly, then Harry signed and initialed at the bottom of every page. It was done.
“I wasn’t – I didn’t –” he started, but Miles strode forward and punched him squarely in the gut. Malfoy doubled over, heaving.
“What – How –?”
“What, Hermione?” he asked softly. “How did he look?”

Harry realized, suddenly, that Malfoy’s smirk belied the fear in his eyes.
, you start to feel a little more informal with them.”
“Our marriage...” Harry said slowly. “It...it was never meant to bring peace? You arranged the whole thing?”
Fortunately, McGonagall seemed to understand. Her eyes, as she squeezed his hand, were kind. “It was an honor, and my sincere pleasure,” she said firmly. Then, as if it was the most natural thing in the world, she continued, “And of course, we would love to have you back at Hogwarts for your final year.”
“The hospital? With what money?” Miles shook his head. “Give the baby to me and keep giving her water. She’ll recover soon.”
, Harry thought. He nodded back. Slowly, carefully, they crept forward and Harry pressed his ear to the wood.
The sound of the front door opening made him sit up. He was just shoving his glasses back on his nose when Luna came floating in, a bag of groceries hovering behind her.
The fact that just thinking of stepping into a room full of witches and wizards watching him on Harry’s arm made him want to sink through the floor was completely beside the point, of course. He knew that, sooner or later, he would have to start attending dinner parties. It was just still so soon, not even a full month since he had been in Azkaban, and the last dinner parties he had attended had been hosted by his mother and attended solely by Death Eaters and the Dark Lord.
“Mr. Potter is eager to assist in this reconciliation project,” Kingsley replied promptly, perhaps grateful to be back on scripted ground. “I imagine he also fondly remembers your school days together and knows that the two of you, once reunited, can forge a partnership that reflects the very best of the wizarding world.”
had known to send a reporter this soon after they had arrived. Still, he had to say something.
. He had to think. Who could help Harry? And who would believe him when he said he hadn’t done it?
“Now, where shall we start today?” mused the first man as all three circled Draco menacingly. “Why not with a classic?” He pointed his wand at Draco and said, almost casually: “Crucio.”
Then Draco leaned forward, deepened the kiss, and gave an answer, then another, then another.
Harry. That doesn’t sound like someone who was trying to murder him, does it?”
“And mine,” Harry said firmly. “And the gaps that I’m sure I’ll find in the surveillance footage. And the prisoner’s memories, and very likely his answers under Veritaserum, should it come to that. Anything else you want to try?”
, for gods’ sake, they’re full of shit –”
He was getting agitated again. Without thinking, Harry reached out and clasped Draco’s hands in his own. Draco inhaled sharply but did not pull back. His hands were freezing.
Hermione had looked up at Kingsley’s voice as well, and exchanged a confused glance with Harry.
Malfoy nodded once, his eyes now fixed on the floor. Harry shook his head vigorously.
Draco smirked back at him and picked his chopsticks back up. “Now eat your dinner, dear, before it gets cold.”
“It would,” Bogrod answered with a nod. “But I think you’ll agree that to add someone else to your private accounts, especially someone with Mr. Malfoy’s…
“Ok,” Harry said, grinning back and feeling for the first time in a long time that everything might turn out alright. “Ok, great. And you know, sometimes friends go on dates. After one of them has maybe gone to a bit of therapy and gotten a little less volatile and prone to jumping to conclusions?”
Pansy snorted and threw her handful of Floo powder into the flames. She stepped into the fireplace and was gone.
He seemed to be the only person in here for the moment, which was just as well. The man looking back at him from the wide mirror across the opposite wall didn’t look like he could stand to make much more polite small talk. His jaw ached from forcing a smile all evening. Draco took the opportunity to check that his dress robes were still falling correctly, half spinning away from the mirror so he could see his own back. It was such a familiar movement, and one that he had not used in so long, that he again, for a moment, felt as if he had stumbled back in time and was in the bathroom at one of his mother’s many social functions, taking a quick breather before returning to the role of dutiful heir.
Malfoy shook his head. “I have to stay here for a while,” he said. “Mr. Potter needs my help on a case.” Harry snorted but Malfoy didn’t look up. “I’ll be thinking of you, though, and loving you. You know.” It wasn’t a question. Viola nodded. Leaned forward and wrapped her arms around him, buried her face in his neck.
“Interesting,” came Miles’s voice, and Malfoy spun around so quickly he hit his hand against the counter. The older man was standing in the doorway. He had clearly been listening to everything. “This man of yours – he wouldn’t be Álvaro Perez, would he?”
It didn’t take much, these days.
“Excuse me?” Malfoy said, looking at Harry disbelievingly. “My
“Well, when you almost single-handedly free three-quarters of the Ministry of Magic from the thrall of a crazed, murderous criminal, I think that counts for something,” Kingsley replied, still smiling. “Not to belittle your own efforts, Mr. Potter, or those of Ms. Granger,” he said, inclining his head to Harry, who shook his head with a laugh.
“Oh – do they?” Draco suddenly felt like he was back in the Manor’s secret room, bringing food to Lovegood and Ollivander and avoiding their too-knowing looks. Lovegood was looking at him again now, her gaze suddenly shrewd. She leaned forward.
“Forgive me if I don’t have the same blind faith in Granger as you do.” Malfoy shook his head. “Even if it’s not Azkaban, it’ll be back in exile, unable to see or be near any magic users ever again –” He broke off. Harry realized he was trembling.
“Seize him,” Lucius said calmly, advancing on him. “And take the man in the chair down to our most uncomfortable cell. I’ll be attending to both of them personally, as soon as the dementors return from –”
When they landed a moment later in the Ministry of Magic, Viola gasped and sat down hard. Then she looked up at Malfoy and started to laugh, talking so quickly in Spanish that Harry couldn’t catch a word. Malfoy laughed softly in response, and Harry suddenly realized he’d never heard Malfoy laugh without malice before. It was almost nice, if anything Malfoy did could be nice.
“Liar!” shouted Miles, and whirled away from Malfoy, towards another corner of the room where, Harry saw with horror, Viola was crouched and cowering. He advanced on her and she whimpered, watching him through wide gray eyes. Harry could see her chest rising and falling rapidly. “Maybe you know, my sweet one,” he crooned.
It didn’t look like the Dark Lord’s fall had changed that.
, he corrected himself hurriedly. He laughed a lot, actually, in these conversations with Malfoy. They were, in many ways, the best part of his day.
“Can you blame her?” Draco said, just as quietly. His eyes were fixed on the table.
“I told you, I was taking a walk and I got lost,” came Torey’s gruff voice. It was trembling slightly. Either Hermione’s acting skills had improved, or she was terrified. “Don’t know why you had your men grab me like that.”
“Yes,” he said, keeping his head motionless and his eyes fixed on her. She was bent over a spell book open on her lap, brow furrowed. A few strands of hair had escaped her neat locs, giving her a slightly frantic look when she glanced up at him.
A young-looking Gryffindor sitting near the front of the class raised his hand. “Did you fight in the Battle of Hogwarts, sir?”
Harry shrugged, feeling defensive. “I dunno,” he said grimly. “Kids should be with their parents. Isn’t a little bit of hope worth something?”
He didn’t love continuing to lie to Harry, either. If only he could be sure that Harry would be on his side – would listen and give him a chance to explain before calling the Ministry – but Draco knew he couldn’t be sure of anything. Harry had been so kind to him so far, but Draco harbored no illusions as to where his husband’s true loyalties lay. If it came down to a decision between supporting Draco and supporting Kingsley and the rest of the Wizarding World, Draco knew he wouldn’t stand a chance.
“Yes. Yes, of course,” Draco responded quickly, doing his best to smile back. “Thank you. And thank you again for being my witness. I – appreciate what that meant. For you.”
“Hermione,” for the first time in
Harry considered this for a moment. Loathe as he was to admit it, Draco did have a point about controlling their own narrative. Not that he wanted to be in the business of public fame – but if the Wizarding world was determined to publish stories about his private life, at least they could be true.
“I know, I know,” Ron said harshly, running a hand through his hair. “I know you have a savior complex, I know you have to be married to him, but do you have to
In which Harry and Draco do some shopping.
“Woah, back up,” he said firmly. “This is none of your business –”
Harry could feel Draco’s back knot up through the fabric of his shirt. This had to stop.
There was no one else in any of the holding cells that night, and the basement of the Auror wing of the Ministry was silent. There wasn’t even an Auror on guard duty at the moment, but the spelled door only opened to a registered Auror’s spell signature, and there were surveillance spells webbed along the ceiling. It was cold and dark, shadows dancing at the edge of Harry’s
“Yes, yes, we know where it is,” Harry cut in breathlessly. “Luna, please – what did you hear?”
“But the teaching,” Neville said, chuckling. “You enjoyed the teaching?”
“You’re welcome, Malfoy,” Harry said. He checked his watch and cursed. “I’m late,” he said, standing up quickly and pushing the chair back. Malfoy nodded, his face returning to its impassive mask.
Harry wondered. He took another bite of naan.
“How are you my love?” He asked quietly. She didn’t reply, just turned her head away from him and closed her eyes.
It was impossible. His father was in Azkaban – Draco had seen him led away, had been taunted by the guards with vivid descriptions of whatever new brutality his father was facing. There had been no headlines (“Death Eater Escaped!” “Lucius Malfoy Released!”) as there would have been had he disappeared. Draco repeated the words to himself and felt his stomach clench. He couldn’t tell if his body was reacting to the knowledge that those words could not possibly be true, or the possibility, however small, that they were.
They gave him until the end of the day. Malfoy disappeared into Elena’s room, and Harry could hear them speaking in rapid Spanish through the walls, although he couldn’t tell what they were saying. Malfoy reappeared and made several phone calls from the kitchen landline. Harry caught words like “me voy” and “ayudarle con el huerto” that made him think Malfoy was finding someone else to help Elena with her farm.
“Harry,” Draco began hesitantly. When Potter looked at him, he remembered his place and drew his hand back from where it had been drifting to the other man’s arm. “I appreciate your efforts on my behalf, and of course I’ll do whatever you think is best. Do you—” He cleared his throat. “Do you really trust me? With this?”
Until next time, friends. Take good care!
He was still debating it the following Monday as he finished his breakfast in the Great Hall. He usually ate breakfast at his and Harry’s flat, but things had been a little tense since the party. It was probably his own guilty conscience, Draco told himself. Harry had actually seemed very attentive during the night of the party. Every time Draco looked down at his plate at the table, his eye fell on the silver ring on his finger and he remembered how Harry had played with it absently as they listened to the band. Almost as if they were really in love.
being put in that kind of position!” Hermione snapped, rising from her chair so quickly that the spell book on her lap crashed to the floor. She didn’t even flinch or bend down to pick it up, which told Harry all he needed to know about how angry she was. “I did
In the warm, golden light of morning, Draco turned and saw Harry Potter curled up behind him, a strong brown arm thrown over his waist. The other man seemed to be fast asleep, but as Draco looked at him, his eyes opened. Those green eyes. Draco wanted to fall into them, to be swallowed up by them, to swallow them whole. He smiled, tentatively.
Counting had stopped working a long time ago. Draco shuddered as another blast of icy water hit him and a high, cruel laugh filled his ears. He had stopped trying to keep track of his father’s cronies days (
“Need any help calming your pet, Harry Potter?” drawled another one, a tall boy who looked like he was in fifth or sixth year. “Teaching him a lesson he won’t forget?”
Harry nodded back, and Ron and Viola walked away, making their way to the exit from which they could apparate. Viola looked back once and Malfoy blew her a kiss. Harry felt a lump form in his throat.
Lucius had died a few months after the Battle of Hogwarts.
“Nev and I have been casing the Ministry, trying to see if anyone is going to a new place for any reason, but we haven’t seen anything yet. It’s early though, Harry,” she added quickly, seeing Harry’s face fall. “Dad’s also agreed to let us know if he sees anyone acting differently. He’s all but retired now, he can be anywhere in that building and just say he’s visiting old friends.”
Draco nodded. “Yes,” he said carefully, “but not only that. Harry, I love you –” Harry’s heart leapt at the casual way he said those words, but Draco wasn’t finished. “—But you can’t go for my throat every time someone tells you something bad about me, that they say I’ve done, that they say I am.” His tone was mild, but there was a hardness beneath the words. He was watching Harry closely. “I was on the wrong side of the war, Harry, and I’ve done things I’m not proud of, but if you can’t trust me enough to
Some time later, they broke apart. “We’re never going to get this done if we can’t focus,” Draco said in mock disapproval.
Draco took a deep breath, checked to make sure he had everything he needed in his bag, and turned on his heel. The now-familiar smells of the apartment were immediately replaced by damp earth, crushed grass, and the scent, barely perceptible on the wind but unmistakable, of cinnamon and spice. Hogwarts.
