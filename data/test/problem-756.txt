“Smug prick,” Potter says, but the words lose all bite when he snuggles in closer and slings an arm around Draco’s torso. He feels completely boneless and relaxed, a reassuring weight against Draco’s body.
If I’m honest, just thinking about that, Draco getting together back with Astoria, makes me kind of jealous. Only because I don’t have anyone waiting for me like he has. Sure, there are probably hoards of girls wanting to be with me, but only because of what I did and not… not for
, thank you, Mr Malfoy! But… I only have payment for the foot ointment and the rosemary,” she says, indicating the bread and cabbages on the table beside you.
The following day you’re twitchy and nervous, but at the same time oddly calm and focused on the task at hand.
“Kiss me, Draco,” Harry repeats, his voice needy and begging, and Draco surges forward, missing Harry’s mouth in his haste, and the kiss is sloppy and wet, too much teeth and tongue and they can’t find the rhythm, but Harry doesn’t care, he just wants Draco close. He slides his hands under Draco’s top and whispers “Let go.”
“I recognise the smell of these,” he says, deeply inhaling the scent from the jar of little yellow flowers standing in front of you.
Harry felt his cheeks grow hot. He had to remind himself that this was just a show, and Draco was a little too good at acting.
…” she thought for a bit for the right word, not too crude, she knew how sensitive the humans could be. “
“It didn’t mean anything, and you still felt the need to do it?” Draco’s voice is a weird mixture of scornful and saccharinely sweet.
You can’t answer, you’re too focused on his fingers circling you, on the sensation as one of them breaches you.
“I have to say that discussing my sexual habits was not what I thought you had in mind when you brought me here. And it was definitely not what I had in mind when I came with you,” Harry says and then licks a long stripe from the base of Draco’s cock to the tip, smiling when it twitches violently in response. Even if Draco seems collected, his body is severely betraying him.
He even grabbed my hair, which stung a bit, but I liked it, I think. Or I wouldn’t mind if he did it again, or if he did it harder, or if he used it to hold me still and fuck into my mouth.
Harry gaze softened and he stoked Draco’s cheek. “Tomorrow, love. I don’t think I can wait anymore to finally have you in my arms.”
“We need to dry these if we don’t want to get sick,” he tells you when he notices you’re staring, then he cocks his head to the side. “Or perhaps it’s a sin to be naked in the same room? Perhaps it’s better to die rather than to defy the Lord’s will.”
“So, Mr Malfoy, there’s no way around this, but I’m afraid I have some bad news,” Healer Goodwin says, her face schooled in a professional manner, but her eyes are kind and sympathetic.
After a week of barely any sleep and no word with Harry, you’ve had enough. You corner him after breakfast, in the garden shed, where it almost happened the first time. There’s just the two of you. Brother Mark and Brother Matthew, who usually tend the graveled paths and weed them out, haven’t arrived yet.
“Yeah,” Draco sighed, leaning back, away from Harry’s personal space. “But I guess I’m not nearly drunk enough, because that rejection really stung.”
Right, so you can call me a hopeless plonker because today I almost set fire to the kitchen. It’s embarrassing, really, but I was baking and cooking at the same time, and of course I forgot to put on a timer for the cookies. I didn’t really notice the smell, or realise what it was, before it was too late. But it wasn't the cookies that caught on fire. No, I managed to put my oven mitt on the stove and
Harry obliges at once, and when he’s on his back, the sight of Draco makes him gasp. He looks almost wild, hair messy and tousled, cheeks flushed and chest covered in splotches of red. And the look he gives Harry is almost too much to handle, he looks at him like he’s the most precious thing in the world, and Harry has to close his eyes on the pretence that he needs to adjust his position.
Behind her, Blaise is trying and failing to suppress a giggle, but Pansy looks like she’s about to stomp over to Ron and strangle him with her bare hands. Perhaps an
So I was cooking us dinner, and Draco came into the kitchen because he recognised the smell. And of course, Draco being Draco, he said “What did you do?” because
You tip your head back, allowing him to continue further down. “She did offer payment for it but I didn’t accept it.”
, or, if he thinks about it, he’s not sure he’s ever heard Draco laugh like this at all, like he’s got no care in the world.
Harry squeezes Draco closer, kissing him on the neck. “I liked it a lot too,” he whispers, and Draco relaxes into his embrace. Harry lets his lips brush Draco’s skin again, smiling when Draco
“Taking advantage of being famous, I don’t like that. I don’t want any special treatment, I’m… I’m just like everyone else.”
“Not at all! Although I would say it is highly unusual for a pilgrim to enjoy his stay here for as long as he has,” he says, his lip curling in distaste. “I am more displeased with the reports I’ve been getting that your alliance has taken a rather inappropriate turn.”
They’ve just got back to Draco’s after abandoning the mandatory Friday pub trip. It only took one subtle but well placed hand on Harry’s arse while the two of them were ordering a new round for the others. Then everyone got so distracted when Harry announced that the drinks were on him that sneaking out was an easy task. Once outside, Draco pressed Harry up the wall, shoved his leg between Harry’s and pulled his earlobe into his mouth, and Harry got so turned on, he was ready to skip getting home entirely. At that moment he didn’t care if anyone were to come out and see them, the way Draco claimed him was nothing short of intoxicating.
Harry flung himself back onto the bed and closed his eyes, trying to get himself under control. He knew, he
“Mr Malfoy, I have a question!” a girl with a cheeky grin shouted from the back, jumping up and down with her hand up in the air, and Draco gave her a confused nod to let her know he was listening. “I was wondering, is Professor Potter as annoying at home as he is at school?"
This is so much worse than when he thought he was going to die initially, because it was one thing suspecting what was wrong with him (or knowing, really) and what the outcome would be. But to have it stated to him in no uncertain terms, and on top of that having a lifeline thrown at him only to be yanked away again, makes him feel like he’s been hit by a Bludger. Repeatedly.
He’s surprised to hear a knock on his door, and even more surprised to find Potter on his doorstep. Draco blinks at him, the roots around his heart swelling, constricting.
Draco stares at her, fury pumping through him. Her cheeks are flushed and her eyes are brimming with tears, and she’s actually panting.
Malfoy paused, and Harry tried desperately to keep his eyes on Malfoy’s face and not on his pink nipples and shiny skin and
“Forgive me,” he mumbles, “I didn’t…” He doesn’t say anything more, clearing his throat instead and turning his head to the table in front of you. You feel guilty for letting your distractions ruin his lesson. “And these are…?” he asks, pointing at the bundle of herbs hanging from the ceiling, breaking the silence between you, and you let your shoulders relax.
Draco scoots forward, both of his hands grabbing Harry’s hair to press himself as close as he can, his heartbeat a steady rhythm against Harry’s chest.
love, he thinks as he slides his fingers through Draco’s soft hair, tugging a little the way he knows Draco likes. It’s just Harry and his foolish heart wanting more than Draco is willing to give him. Because he knows Draco doesn’t do “
Malfoy to put his cock in him, he’d brush them off as a crazy person. But it doesn’t feel crazy at all. It feels just right, like they were supposed to end up like this, and he realises that never in a million years would he’d be able to let Draco go, to be indifferent about him.
“Harr-ry!” Ginny suddenly shouts at a deafening volume into his ear, and he recoils, squinting at her. “Whoops, sorry!” she says as she flops down beside him, but doesn’t look sorry at all, based on the crinkling of her eyes due to the obvious smile she’s trying to hide behind her hand.
Your bag is almost full with white and blue flowers. Harry has delicately helped you put them into two pouches to keep them fresh until you have returned, and now you’ve both decided you’ve earned a break. There’s a little stream winding its way through the undergrowth, next to which you’ve spent countless hours sitting by yourself, but this is the first time you’ve wanted to show it to someone else. You have a special place that you’re especially fond of, where the stream turns and there’s a little fold where you can sit hidden from sight. There are thousands of wind-flowers scattered all over the ground, lighting everything up like tiny suns. Harry lets out a delighted laugh when you get there and promptly sits down with his legs folded under him. Your heart swells at the sight of him, and you know it was the right thing to do, to show him this place that means so much to you.
“Can the two of you shut the fuck up?!” Harry said, surprised at his own words and the force behind them. “I need to think.”
“And—and you?” Draco managed to get out just before Harry’s other hand pressed against his neck and turned his head so their eyes met.
“Thank you, Mrs Baxter, that is awfully thoughtful of you, but I’m afraid I took an oath to never be physical with a woman when I chose the path of light, and I’m honouring that oath still.”
You notice you laugh more around him, and even when you’re not with him, your chest feels like it’s filled with a blazing light, filling up every forgotten corner inside you and chasing away the darkness.
“Do we need to prepare something else, go over details, or should we start examining this place?” Draco said as the silence stretched on.
Draco is such an expert at sucking Harry off, and soon Harry starts moving his hips in tiny thrusts upwards to meet Draco bobbing his head, and Draco lets him, going faster and faster, sucking harder and circling a finger lightly around Harry’s hole.
Harry had to shake himself, and to his horror, he saw that Malfoy had caught him staring, because there was no mistaking what that particular smirk meant, or the way Malfoy’s eyes travelled up and down Harry’s own body. He turned his head, happy that his blush wouldn’t be visible since he was already flushed from running.
(which Harry had figured out was basically hard liquor with various spices, taken in tiny shot glasses after you had sung a little song) and Draco was a bit flushed from the alcohol, his eyes open and clear. Harry had tried to hold back on the drinking, partly because they were still on an assignment, but mostly because he didn’t want to lose control around Draco and accidentally blurt out his feelings.
Although Draco is making things a bit easier by staying away from most social events, and when he’s around he never stays long. But still, there’s that constant gnawing feeling inside Harry of rejection, of almost having what he wanted but have it taken away from him.
His words make you moan, the internal image of him so arousing as instinct takes you over and you rock back to meet him.
Draco reluctantly sat down as well, crossing his legs and trying once again to catch Pansy’s eye, to no avail.
You try to focus on the words, so familiar, you know them all by heart and they’ve always managed to soothe you, but tonight they slip past you unnoticed, because all you can concentrate on is to get Harry’s attention. You miss his presence beside you, miss the way the heat from his body is a comfort to you, miss seeing his lips moving from the corner of your eye.
And now here Harry was, lying beside Draco, watching his sleeping form, unsure how to proceed. He really wanted to wake Draco up by kissing those gorgeous lips, or by letting his lips slide along the entire length of Draco’s spine, but something made him hesitate. He wasn’t really sure Draco felt the same way about him. It was obvious he enjoyed Harry’s company, but what if he found out that Harry was head over heels in love with him and had been for quite some time? What if he only wanted some casual shagging? What if his only reason for taking Harry to bed had been that it was convenient, them being two single gay men living in close proximity without much other company? Most of all, Harry wasn’t sure he could deal with that particular conversation at this particular moment.
“That’s a sin, Harry,” you say, your voice sharp as a whip. “What you did. It’s a sin, it’s against the Lord’s will.”
! Fuck, I love—” Harry starts, but cuts himself off when Draco pauses for a fraction of a second, as if he’s choking, making Harry realise his slip. “Fuck I— I love when you do that,” Harry corrects himself, and relief fills him when Draco picks up his movements again, tentative at first, but soon enough he’s going faster again, up and down the length of Harry, taking him deeper with each thrust, and Harry has to focus on controlling his stuttering hips, until—
” an angry voice suddenly barked out behind Harry, and both he and Malfoy froze. Harry slowly turned around, and was not at all surprised to see Ms Allen standing in the doorway to the yoga studio, hands on her hips and a scowl on her face. “What the fuck do you think you’re doing? Do either of you think this is appropriate behaviour
He pushes himself off of Harry and nudges him to turn around on his front, to which Harry obliges without protest, moaning as Draco doesn’t waste a second to part his arse cheeks and lick a broad stripe along the whole length of his crack. Harry gasps and flings his hand back to grab Draco’s hair, his other hand clutching the sheets as Draco licks again, pausing at his entrance and flicking the tip of his tongue at Harry’s rim. Forehead pressed to the mattress, Harry lets it swallow his moans as Draco continues to lick and suck and leave biting kisses along his hole. Draco tugs at his hips to get him up on all fours, and then slowly works one finger in while he kisses the small of Harry’s back. He’s really excelling at this, Harry fleetingly registers, he’s clearly enjoying how much Harry enjoys it.
After Draco collapses at Pansy’s he’s rushed to St Mungo’s, and it only takes one look at him and the bloody flowery mess on his clothes and a few questions from the Healer on site for them to diagnose him with the Hanahaki Disease. They send him home with some potions to relieve the pain and open up his airways, something that looks and smells similar to the herbicide his mother would use at the Manor. It helps a little bit initially, but then it gets even worse, so he stops taking them. Better to ride this out than try to suppress it, he should’ve thought of that. He knows that there are no shortcuts in this.
Harry quivers at the way Pansy ominously returns her attention to him and Draco. She practically has a sign over her head saying “Done with this shit”, and part of Harry is impressed with both Ron and Draco for daring to take the piss out of her.
Draco froze, his eyes widening comically before flitting around the room to finally land on Ron, who seemed to try to make himself a permanent part of Harry’s sofa. After a split second, Draco leaned back into the hallway, not meeting Harry’s eyes once. “Wait, what’s that? Oh, no! I see Head Healer Patel’s patronus, oh this can’t be good, I really must be off.”
A faint flush appeared on Draco’s cheeks, but his voice was casual when he spoke. “Would I notice if I lived with an erumpent and it suddenly disappeared? Of course I noticed, Potter, don’t be daft.”
“But if anyone asks, it was during a very romantic dinner underneath the stars and you were down on one knee.”
like it,” Draco hissed, sliding his hand down Harry’s back and letting it rest on his hip, gripping around his hip bone and yanking him closer still. Harry gasped as he almost toppled over but managed to sling his arm around Draco’s waist and turn the gasp into a laugh. Somewhere in the distance, a voice was speaking but he couldn’t hear a thing for the buzzing in his ears. “You are the worst, Draco Malfoy,” he said as besottedly as he could manage.
“Oh, come on, Harry, you can’t deny that you and Malfoy have been at each other’s throats ever since we started school. I guess it was inevitable that it morphed into attraction eventually,” Hermione said with a flick of her head, making her look very much like the teenage bossy know-it-all she used to be.
“You know, you should focus on breathing slowly and calmly,” he said, furrowing his brows to a look of concern. “Soothe your mind.” He turned to the front again and folded himself forwards, palms against the floor, and as planned, his shorts rode up a little bit, exposing the bottom part of his buttocks. Malfoy made a strangled sound beside him and Harry bit back a snort.
“— of marrying me, so I can keep fucking this glorious arse of yours? Once in a while of course, because I like it when you’re the one doing the fucking.”
“Savoury sage,” you tell him softly. “It’s quite the cure all; it’s used for every imaginable injury and malady.”
It turned out to be the latter. When Harry turned around, Draco was standing in the bathroom doorway, his anger emanating off him in waves and Harry was surprised there wasn’t a thundercloud over his head.
Harry’s eyes rolled up towards Draco, pinning him in place. His voice came out low and rough. “Do you even know what I’ve been going through since the club? Before that?” Harry threw his hands out to the side and stalked towards Draco, who squeaked at the sudden movement. He stumbled backwards and his knees gave out beneath him when he hit the couch. Harry threw himself on top of Draco and pressed him back into the cushions.
Harry would gloat at the fact that Blaise gets stuck with this task, if it weren’t for the severe breach of privacy and the prospect of having Blaise babysit him and Draco for the unforeseeable future.
Not five minutes later the two were drenched and walking down a slippery, slowly flooding staircase to who knows where.
Malfoy yanked up his pants and trousers and pulled the handle to flush the loo. “If you don’t want company, you know there’s a lock on the door,” he said without so much as looking at Harry. “Scoot over, I need to wash my hands.”
Harry nods, because he knows Draco will make it so good. He loves Draco being in control, trusts him completely to take care of him like this.
He turns around, his eyes somber, but there is hurt in them as well. He keeps quiet, and somehow you get the feeling he’s been waiting for you to do this.
The words go straight to the very core of Harry, pooling deep in his belly, making him screw his eyes shut so tightly he’s seeing stars, and then he’s coming as well, louder than ever before, while Draco keeps whispering encouragement into his ear, his hand firm on Harry’s cock, slowly milking every drop out of him.
“Well, just go down there and do something! Surely they must be able to accomodate the Boy Who Lived?”
You find that the wounds on his shoulder are shallow, so you leave them to dry, moving on to examine the ones on his chest. He shifts on the bed to allow you to untie the rest of the tunic and open it up, uncovering the entire expanse of his torso. You bite your lip to keep from gasping, but his eyes are closed and he doesn’t seem to notice. You need to remind yourself that this is a strictly professional situation, and it is highly inappropriate of you to be staring at his body like this, but how on earth are you supposed to be able to concentrate with all of his exposed skin in front of you?
“Oh, did I not mention?” Draco sounds ridiculously smug and if Harry wasn’t so bonelessly spent he’d pinch him. “Since dating you means there is a lot of time for special occasions, I bought some new ones.” He waves his wand and a paper bag with pink tissue paper comes zooming towards them, smacking Harry on the forehead. Draco snickers and pulls out one of the wrapped items, biting his lip as he hands it to Harry. “So, for the next time, would you prefer daisies or sunflowers? I also bought a spare of your favourites just in case, because honestly, the way you go at them I knew it was a matter of time.”
, so when Draco looks up at him to gauge his face he just nods to make him continue. Draco’s thighs are quivering from holding himself back as he’s slowly rocking further inside Harry, and it’s something almost unbearably tender about the way Draco takes his time, making sure Harry’s adjusting to him.
You realise he’s genuinely worried about finding a body here, so you turn around, smiling gently and comfortingly at him. “He did. But he wasn’t alone, and the monks that lived in the monastery at the time buried him in the graveyard after.”
Twenty minutes later, Draco stood leaning against Harry’s desk and staring into the distance while the last students filed out of the classroom. He was exhausted. He’d been so nervous that the students would be hostile towards him or inquire about what he did during the war, but they had mostly asked him relevant questions about his work, interspersed with silly anecdotes, like the time Harry accidentally blew a hole in the wall when he was teaching them how to cast a
“Well, I guess if he fell for it, everyone else will right?” Harry’s face drooped a bit at Draco’s statement.
Three days into their holiday, Draco felt like he had found some sort of new normal and started to find his place in the group, as well as a normal way to act around Potter. It was difficult to share a room with him, but Draco found that if he stayed in the living room long enough into the evening, Potter had often already gone to bed when Draco came up. Since he wasn’t in the mood to expose himself more than necessary, both figuratively and literally speaking, he also always made sure to be clothed, even though sleeping in his pyjamas was extremely sweaty once his cooling charms had worn off. The others had initially looked baffled at his choice of wearing long sleeves and full length trousers even on the beach, but accepted his explanation about his pale complex and sun protective charms not being sufficient enough for him to not get a severe sunburn.
It took a moment for the chattering to die down, and Draco cleared his throat again to regain his composure. “Right, where was I?” he muttered, taking out his notes from his pocket and rifling through them.
“Because you look so bloody hot in them. The way they hug your hips and the way they show off your arse. And when you get hard your cock peeks out of them.” He leaves open mouthed kisses along Draco’s jaw and throat while sliding his hands in under the elastic of the top. “And the way they make you look like an innocent angel and a complete slut at the same time makes me want to rip them off you and do filthy things with you,” Harry growls into his ear, and Draco moans, grabbing Harry’s head to bring their mouths together in a sloppy kiss, their tongues sliding together.
Harry couldn’t stop staring. It wasn’t an extravagant gift, money-wise, but the thoughtfulness and the effort it must have taken Draco to find this for him was astounding. The game was almost mint condition. Draco must’ve gone back to the store to get a better look, and then found it in another store, because the one they’d seen had been old and battered. The gift made something stir in Harry, something he hadn’t allowed himself to think about before, and he wasn’t sure he was ready for even now.
“Okay, are we done?” Ron sighs. “Have we sorted out why everyone is here, so we can sort out why the two of you are… like
It’s getting increasingly hard to breathe now, he can feel the vines tightening around his chest, his lungs, his heart, and he needs to struggle for every scrap of air. He flops down on the floor as well, sitting opposite Pansy, his head in his hands.
They decided to eat outside. Ebba told them that the weather was usually unpredictable this time of year, but since they had a roof over their veranda, they decided to risk it.
Draco makes a strangled sound, like a deep sob, and Harry lifts his head to look at him. His face is wet with streaming tears, but his eyes are clear.
Draco’s stomach turned at the way Harry was smiling and leaning gently against this other man. How could this be happening?
He purses his lips disbelievingly and tilts his head, giving you a sharp look. You feel like shielding yourself from his gaze, it’s far too invasive.
Draco swallows. He’s decidedly avoided thinking about how things will be once everyone else finds out about him being sick with love, how they’ll pity him for his weakness. But Potter’s words make these thoughts come nearer, clawing at him, demanding access to his mind. “I guess.”
You tip your head back to hide your self consciousness, and Harry doesn’t waste a second to cover the expanse of your throat with kisses, his stubble rasping over the delicate skin, working his way up to your ear.
Harry would rather eat one of Hagrid’s rock cakes than confront Malfoy about what he’d heard and ask him to tone it down. The morning after had been embarrassing enough, with Malfoy smirking knowingly at Harry when he caught him blushing.
“Which is why you should’ve told me!” she hisses, and Draco is getting increasingly convinced that she might make the process short for him and strangle him before the plants have done their work.
He quickly yanked his underwear up the last bit to cover his private parts, because even if Neville had seen them countless of times when they were sharing a dorm, he didn’t much fancy his friend seeing him in this state. Though he realised that it really didn’t make much of a difference when Draco and Neville entered and watched him lying sprawled ungracefully on the floor: he’d never been more embarrassed in his entire life. What would Draco think? What if he regretted the whole thing now? Harry looked up at them, and even though they were upside down to him, he could tell Neville’s smile was amused, but he couldn’t decipher Draco’s mood.
“Listen, Draco—” Potter starts, and Draco knows immediately what’s to come, and he knows he doesn’t want to hear it, knows it’ll only make everything worse. But he’s too weak to protest, so Potter continues. “You know we said, when we started this… this thing, we said that we’d only keep it up as long as no one caught any feelings.”
A pleasant ocean breeze greeted Draco as he stormed out of the cottage, slamming the door shut behind him. If you could call the pathetic sound the thin wooden framed mosquito net made a slam.
“Sorry,” he said, trying his best to focus on her, which was hard since he thought he saw Draco going pink, a thing he loved to watch. He cleared his throat. “Sorry, I think I was somewhere else.”
He opened the kitchen cupboard to fetch himself a plate, only to find it empty. Thinking that he would give the git the benefit of the doubt, he started searching the other cabinets as well, but he only found pots and a grimy cup that was missing its handle. There wasn’t a single plate or even a whiff of a bowl anywhere. Of course. Of bloody course.
The next morning, Harry had signed up for a yoga class, and he was prepared. When Malfoy strolled in, again in those low slung joggers with apparently nothing else under them, Harry knew he would take the place beside Harry’s yoga mat, even though the room was practically empty with only two other participants and the instructor. And sure enough, with his signature faux innocent look, Malfoy crouched down beside Harry to roll out his mat. Harry did not notice how the fabric of Malfoy’s joggers stretched across his arse as he bent forwards, or the graceful way he folded his legs underneath him to sit down in the lotus position. Malfoy turned to Harry, blinking serenely.
“Yes, Weasley, could you please stop trying to get cheap laughs so I can focus?” Pansy says, rubbing her forehead tiredly. “So, you’re saying this curse is still active in your family?”
“Do you recognize that area at all?” Draco didn’t and said as much.  “Then I guess we’re following them, right?”
“It most certainly is not!” Draco says, affronted. “Though to be fair, it’s considered to be very old fashioned, so most families have found ways to lift the curse for the younger generations. Except for a few families. And, well, it seems that mine belongs to one of those few.”
“I didn’t like it either. I didn’t push too hard, did I?” Draco ran his fingers over Harry’s face a little frantically, checking his temperature, down to his neck and wrist to check his pulse. “I know your experience with Occlumency is decent, but then, only against someone who was sharing the same link and had an equal disadvantage. Against others…you aren’t as proficient....” He summoned a calming draught from his bag and a bottle of water, wordlessly handing them to Harry.
Ten minutes later, he’s sitting at the table again and making funny faces at Rose, whose delighted laughter takes away at least some of the pain.
Harry sighed, and with what he hoped was an apologetic smile, he turned to Ebba, who was staring at them both with her mouth hanging open.
“Honestly, if you’re that impatient then Legilimency isn’t for you. It takes a long time and a lot of effort to master,” Harry said with a fond smile on his face.
had been her plan all along. How could he have been so foolish as to think that she worked in those simple ways?
“Fuck, Harry,” Draco says on an exhale, capturing Harry’s lips again, pressing himself even closer. “Tell me, tell me what you want to do with me. You know I want to give you everything. Anything you want.”
And that’s it. They hug each other, and as he waves goodbye he thinks that it might take him some time to get over all of this with Draco, but that he needs to learn a way to cope with it. The worst part is really not knowing what even went on with the two of them. Maybe he should just talk to Ron and Hermione about it? Maybe he shouldn’t try to go through this alone, but take help from those closest to him. He’s tired of keeping them in the dark anyway.
But Draco had been the one thing that had made him feel safe. Draco had been so careful not to hurt him, he could see the tenderness in Draco’s eyes as he tended to him once they got back, and now Harry had fucked it all up and shouted at him. God, he was such an ass. He knew how much Draco hated his reputation and how much he’d changed. These last weeks preparing for this assignment, Harry had even thought he felt something else, something deeper, but how could Draco forgive him now? Harry had thrown all that back in his face.
“I didn’t love him,” he says, so quietly that you almost can’t hear it over the rushing of the stream and the chirping of the birds.
Shit, I’m so nervous. I can’t do it today because I sent an order out by owl for home delivery. But tomorrow maybe.
“I’m so sorry, I hope I’m not intruding!” Ginny said, to everyone’s protests that she was more than welcome. “I managed to take a break from Quidditch training camp and I really wanted to hang out with you guys!”
“It’s not dangerous, Harry. I know it’s unnerving, but we only need to find some shelter,” you say, thinking hard. And then you remember: “The Hermit’s hut.”
, I already know that! But I also want to be a good and supportive friend so I guess I’ll just have to put up with it.
“For what it’s worth, Harry, the only person you need to seek the approval of is the Lord himself. And I believe He loves you.”
“I think you still have that wound on my hip to look after,” he says instead, and you realise you’ve been idling in your task because you were too busy staring at him.
Potter made a noise almost like her prey when she sank her fangs into them, a strangled, garbling sound. Well, except for the death anxiety of course. “
for me, Potter”, and “no one will fuck you as good as this”, until he stills and his cock finally throbs its release inside Harry.
They both turned to Hermione again, who had managed to compose herself, even if she was still letting out the occasional giggle.
(which came as no surprise to Draco who was used to Harry not always being able to gauge how powerful he was).
He regards you for a long time, making you squirm in discomfort. “I think I know now why you reacted that way,” he says eventually, and then continues walking, not saying anything more than that.
Maybe he’s upset with me? I bet he wishes he could escape this flat to go see Astoria in person or something (I mean more than what he’s obviously seeing of her when he gets outside to spend his free hour), because I can’t think what I did to make him upset with me. Or maybe he thinks (realised) that my snippy remark about her is because I might be interested in her as well?
You laugh fondly against his lips. “There’s barely any light in here. And you don’t even have your glasses on.”
When night comes you wait until you hear that everyone around you is sleeping, and then you slowly, quietly slip out of your bed and out of the dormitory. You have at least three hours before Matins, before someone will notice you’re gone.
Luna continues to smile at him, and he’d describe it as knowingly, if it weren’t for the way her eyes seem focused on the air around him rather than his face.
“What’s so damn funny, Hermione?” Ron said. “Harry just told us he’s — nope, no, I can’t say the words, it’s too appalling.”
“Good. And I would like to add, and this is not my professional opinion but my own personal one: would the two of you please be so kind as to work on your communication? I know it feels like you’re out of the woods now, but I’ve talked enough with Miss Parkinson and from what I understand you’re both thick headed like trolls. Don’t let it ruin something good, okay?”
Harry shrugged, trying to sound casual. “It was Hermione’s suggestion after I asked her for an ingredient that would make the texture of the hair a little… rougher. Not as sleek and shiny. Easier to shape.”
Malfoy’s angry demeanor, flushed cheeks and shooting-daggers-eyes changed immediately upon seeing Ron and Hermione there. He looked like a balloon that had suddenly deflated.
You mostly keep to yourself, perfectly content with eating, sleeping, praying, studying the medical arts and taking care of the monastery garden with all its flowers and herbs, because you know you don’t belong here, not really. You know you’re not like the others, that you crave something different to them.
“So, er… that’s how we ended up getting bonded on this mission,” Harry concluded, looking up at Robards who was sitting with closed eyes, pinching the bridge of his nose.
Soft hands come to tangle in Harry’s hair again, and with a sigh Draco says, “I just didn’t know we were having sex with other people.”
Harry moved, almost unconsciously, under his arm and he felt Draco tug him back. He looked back at his hand and at Draco, confused.
“Need I remind you of what the bible says about such alliances?” he says, cutting you off. “And need I remind you of what happens with those who disobey the will of the Lord like that?”
Even for a clergyman, you lead a quiet life, Brother Draco. You rise in the middle of the night for Matins, you eat your breakfast in silence, you attend all the prayers throughout the day, and you never stop to think about the comforts of your old life outside the monastery.
I noticed there are a lot of spots on my ceiling. I haven’t counted them yet though, but I’m trying to find some patterns in them. So far I’ve seen a cauldron, a dragon and Crookshanks. Draco told me I’m going insane when I showed him. Bet he’s just jealous he doesn’t have spots on his ceiling.
“What— What was that?” Harry eventually dares to ask. He realises his voice is hushed and placating, like he’s talking to a wounded animal. Which isn’t far from what Draco reminds him of right now.
You prepared your satchel earlier and hid it in the garden shed, and after retrieving it you sneak off to the gates, praying that they won’t make too much noise as you open them. The Lord’s will, it seems, is on your side tonight, because they glide open soundlessly and allow you to slip out unnoticed.
“Is this…? We don’t have to if…” he says, his voice trembling, and you know that you wouldn’t be able to stop even if you wanted to. This is the moment of no return, the moment that will forever change you, because you’ll never be the same after this. You’re about to cross a line now, and you don’t even want to look back.
“Oh, is that right, Malfoy?” Harry said, leaning in closer and into Malfoy’s personal space. “Well, as far as I remember, I had the same effect on you. I recall a smashed glass at our OWLs. So let’s see who manages to distract the other the most.”
to participate in this… this blasphemy! It is beneath me to taint an ancient tradition like this, I am not sinking to those levels quite yet thank you very much,” Draco sniffed, angrily pulling at the hems of his poofy sleeved shirt.
It takes two weeks before Draco appears in Harry’s shop, under the pretence of looking at a new broom for himself. As soon as the customer Harry’s tending to leaves though, Draco pulls him into the back room and presses him up against the shelves. And he doesn’t apologise, because he wouldn’t be Draco if he did, but the way he kisses Harry slowly, softly, speaks more than words ever could. And Harry doesn’t apologise either, because he wouldn’t be Harry if he did when he believes he’s in the right, but he hopes it’s telling Draco enough that he closes his store early to go back to Draco’s.
“Nothing,” said Harry, to let Hermione off the hook. “I’m just happy to get to spend my birthday with the people I love.”
He was reading the same paragraph for the fifth time when the door opened and Malfoy stepped out in a cloud of steam. Harry tried not to look up, but when he inevitably did, he nearly lost his bearings, because this time, instead of having it draped over his hips, Malfoy was wearing his towel wrapped around his hair. And instead of having a towel to cover his crotch area, he was wearing tight white briefs with red roses on them and a matching crop top. Harry didn’t know where to look. Certainly he couldn’t look at the way Malfoy’s hip bones were protruding, and the way the fabric hugged his package, leaving absolutely
“Yeah,” Harry said. “I guess you didn’t hear me come in, so I assume that’s why you’re… this informal.”
Then, with a horrible gurgling sound, everything stops, and the room goes entirely still except for Draco’s wheezing breaths. He’s on his knees again now, bracing himself on his elbows, head slumped forward, and he sounds like he’s in pain. Harry can’t see what’s wrong with him, because he’s still frozen, numb the way just before panic threatens to take over him, convinced that Draco is about to die and there’s nothing he can do about it. He’s just managed to summon the courage to ask Draco if he’s alright, when a dark red substance trickles out of Draco’s mouth, and then a thick green leaf follows, then another, and another. Harry stares at them, at the blood splattered around them, horrible in their devastating beauty. He doesn’t know much about plants, but this is one of the few he recognises.
It takes a while for Harry to come down from his rush, to have the world outside of his and Draco’s bodies return to his consciousness. Draco has at some point slid out of him, and he’s lying beside Harry, one leg slung over his hips, his face buried in the crook of Harry’s neck, still panting hotly against his skin. Harry’s arse is sore, and his muscles are aching, but he’s never felt this relaxed in his entire life. He heaves a deep sigh and strokes Draco’s thigh in slow circles, turning his head slightly to be able to draw in Draco’s scent. He’s just about to tell Draco how wonderful he feels when Draco breaks the silence.
Your face heats at his words, but you’re too gone now to really be embarrassed, aren’t you? You’ve gone this far, you’re naked and alone with him, and you’re letting him touch parts of your body that no one else has touched, ever.
He made it to the door when, suddenly, behind him, he heard, “Thank you. I know you’ve got my back, I don’t think I could have done that without you.”  His heart swelled and he turned to look into clear green eyes.
He tried to drag Harry back toward the direction they came in but his vision was dimming and suddenly the world faded to black.
“You’re in love with me,” he repeated, more like a statement now, or maybe a confirmation to himself.
“Mhm… Could you… could you show me the best way to do that as well? Just so I don’t screw up, of course.”
“Hmm, and here I was, thinking I was the early bird, but I guess you beat me to that as well, didn’t you?”
And of course that’s when Draco came by my room and overheard me. He made that “oh no Harry is finally losing it”-face, and it looked like he had to struggle to not laugh right in my face. Needless to say he didn’t seem to think it was that brilliant (neither did I but of course I’d never tell him that), and he pointed out that if I want to impress girls maybe I should write something more “significant” (what's
Harry looked at the white stockings Draco was wearing, and at the ribbons with pom pom tassels around the knees.
Draco’s face is closed off, his defences up completely. “I believe I am entitled to set the rules in my own home.”
This morning when Harry woke up Draco had already left, but there was a tray with breakfast waiting for him in the kitchen: apple juice, porridge with raspberry jam, and two soft boiled eggs with soldiers, along with a note that said
Draco decided to chime in, since he was the only one not in a couple and eager to get out of playing. “I agree. I mean, we’re not in school anymore, are we?”
Her posture softens at his words, and she turns to him to take his hand tentatively. “Draco, you know that love is—”
Harry blinks at Draco, who looks composed now as he vanishes the mess on the floor and the spots on his shirt, stroking a stray strand of hair from his face with a hand that is not quite steady.
That was it. That was why he was hurt. Not by your implied rejection, but because you let him down, you judged him after you’d told him he could trust you. The realisation makes your throat constrict in shame, forcing the air out of your lungs.
You hold your breath, trying to think. But your mind isn’t working properly, you only know that you can’t regret it, because how can you regret sharing the best moment of your life with him?
“Look at me, Draco,” he says softly, caressing your cheek with his thumb. “Are you really sure you want to do this?”
“It’s fine,” Draco answers, tears brimming his eyes. “You can’t help it. It’s not your fault, Harry.”
This threw Draco off, and his anger and resentment was instantly replaced with sheer astonishment. “You haven’t?”
“If that means meeting other people, I need to take a shower first,” Harry said, “I wasn’t made for this kind of humidity.”
”. He does casual sex, and even if it’s recurring, and even if he’s requested they’re exclusive, he’s still not ready to call it anything more than this.
He helps you carry them all outside, scooping up the dirt and watering the tiny plants with fresh water from the reservoir. They cower under the spray but soon stretch up, looking like they’re turning their faces to the warming rays of the sun and enjoying themselves. You laugh quietly to yourself at the thought of them as miniature human beings, and when you look up at him he’s smiling, his face open and joyous.
The dance floor is packed with people. It’s hot and sweaty and Harry can’t dance for shit, but he wants to be close to Malfoy. Harry feels himself constantly drawn to him, and he wants Malfoy to dance up to him, wants to grind against him. But Malfoy keeps his distance, the bloody tease. Based on his smug smile, he’s obviously noticed Harry trying to catch his attention, but he never approaches him, never makes a move. It’s extremely annoying and not at all what Harry had imagined when he agreed to tag along, and eventually he gets tired of feeling like a Hippogriff trying to do ballet and gives up.
Harry looks sheepish, but remains clutched to Draco, and Goodwin adds, in a much gentler voice, “It’ll only take a few minutes.”
“Mate, are you okay?” Ron’s hand lands on Harry’s shoulder, and Harry has to take a deep breath to keep from sobbing.
“It didn’t feel wrong,” he tells you quietly, and deep down you agree, but you can’t tell him that, can’t voice that thought out loud, because who knows where you’d end up then.
Draco could meet Harry’s eyes. “I can’t pretend to be a man who can’t keep his hands off the object of his desires when all I’ve been doing this entire time is stopping myself from tracing my hands all over you and mapping out every inch of your skin. Thinking about the job is the only thing stopping me from wrapping you up in my arms and taking you far, far away from here.” Draco closed his eyes. “I thought I’d be able to get through it after earlier, I thought when you were so repulsed by the very thought of being bonded to me, to anyone, that these things, these feelings would just naturally take a seat to the task at hand but…” Draco lifted his eyes and levelled Harry with as honest a look as he could muster. “I can’t pretend with you.”
Maybe Ebba had been right, Harry thought as he slipped his tongue into Draco’s mouth and felt a thrill of excitement at the moan Draco responded with. Maybe they didn’t need any love predictions. Maybe this was all the solstice magic they needed tonight.
Ron was now spluttering, frantically looking around the room for any sort of help from someone, and that was enough for the truth to register in Harry’s brain.
“It’s something with an H, but I don’t remember either, it’s been ages since I used the books on magical ailments as light reading,” Hermione says. “Hang on, Harry, let me go get one of them for you.”
Draco’s bottom lip is caught between his teeth, and for the first time for as long as Harry can remember, he looks unsure.
He doesn’t finish the sentence. Instead he falls to his knees and starts coughing violently, his entire body shaking as he retches and writhes on Harry’s carpet. Harry’s completely frozen, with no idea what to do. It’s like everything is happening in slow motion and he sees the scene from outside: He’s on the floor, with his trousers and pants still around his ankles and his shirt bunched up over his stomach, while Draco sounds like he’s having a seizure, like he’s going to burst at the seams.
Draco barely sees anything on his way home, it’s Pansy who’s leading the way, steering him in the right direction through the crowds of Muggle London. It’s too painful for Draco to Apparate and the Floo is suffocating enough even if you don’t have a veritable greenhouse situated in your respiratory system.
“Fiance? We were never engaged, AND I broke up with you five years ago for being a possessive, controlling, manipulative bastard!” Draco spat. “ Or are you so delusional you forgot about that?”
It’s the truth, isn’t it? He knows what’s wrong with me, he knows how it will end, and he just —” he gulps for air, and now everything smells sickeningly sweet, “ — he just told me we should end it, like it was… like it was nothing to him.”
He smiles shakily at you, looking relieved, and then he joins you on the bed again. He pours a generous amount of oil onto his fingers and brings his hand down between your buttocks, massaging your rim, making you hiss with pleasure.
“Oh, I think there are some things that can still be uncovered.” Granger’s flushed face and glassy eyes showed that she’d obviously had quite a bit to drink, and Draco suspected that the heated look she gave Weasley wouldn’t be so apparent under normal circumstances. It still gave him the distinct urge to vomit.
It was the kind of kiss that, had they not been in Harry’s hallway, it would’ve led to other things. Harry’s body responded immediately, and he desperately wanted
“Oh, bravo, Weasel, ten points to Gryffindor.” Pansy inclined her head in Ron’s direction and clapped her hands in mock applause. “And then you chose this moment to spill the beans, very clever. I’ll have you know that
“You know, I’ve been thinking on it,” Draco said, hands pressing upwards and out against his face in thought, “and maybe we need to look at this from a different perspective.”
You were sent to the monastery for education, to learn about the great predecessors and their way of thinking, to honour the family name. But you quickly found life as a monk freeing, the endless rituals and the monotony of it all liberating you by dulling the flame threatening to rise up from the embers of the sinful thoughts of your youth.
“Strutty’s missing!” Neville exclaimed, unnervingly reminding Harry of his younger self when he’d lost Trevor the Toad.
Draco watched him get up and walk across the room to the parchment and bring it over. “Merlin you’re rubbing off on me,” he groaned, throwing his hands up to cover his face. “Any other time I would have called you rude for it.”
“Always stampeding around like an erumpent in an apothecary,” Draco says, and Potter laughs, a little hysterically, like he’s startled that Draco is talking to him at all, and for some reason it makes Draco relax, like he’s evened out the playing field.
He’s surprised at how firmly he utters the words, because he’d rather not have them in his mouth at all.
“Yeah, I think Harry’s not entirely keen on this either, but you don’t hear him complaining, do you?” Weasley chimed in.
Today I did the exercises after breakfast, because I thought I’d be alone. But of course Draco managed to leave his room just as I was doing the final  squats. He stared at me for a full minute, asked me “what in the ever living fuck” I was doing, and then accused me of disturbing his morning with my loud grunting. I would’ve kicked him if my leg wasn’t so sore. I know that wouldn’t be the best thing to do to the flatmate that you’re stuck with for an unforeseeable future, but at that moment I didn’t really care.
He sighs deeply, looking like he’s trying to remember something. “I really thought this was heaven. I thought I’d go there if I tried to do penance for…” he starts, but trails off.
“Who is that?” He whispered in Draco’s ear, punctuating his statement with a kiss on the cheek. He felt Draco lean into his touch and a small sigh leave his lips.
“From me. I made it. Or, well, I got Hermione to help me make it because I famously suck at potions.”
The visitor’s chairs in the Healer’s office are, quite impressively, even more uncomfortable than the ones out in the waiting area, because why would you want some cushioning for your bum when you’re about to receive the worst news of your life?
Draco stared at him in wide-eyed shock and horror. “My god,” he said in a tone of pure astonishment “You’re insane.”
Potter blinked (even if she’d live to be a hundred years she would never get over how weird the motion looked with only one set of eyelids). “
Digging into the rest of the meal was worth it, even if the outfit he’d picked earlier felt tight afterwards.
His eyes are dark, the irises a tiny sliver of green around his wide pupils, his breath coming in short bursts. You swallow, your eyes never leaving his.
I think I’m getting the hang of this guitar playing thing. I’ve almost learned an entire song (that I didn’t write myself). I played it for Draco, and I think he liked it, even though he’d never admit something like that. But I noticed that when I sang,
You don’t know how long you’ve been sitting there when you suddenly hear someone approaching, thundering through the thick undergrowth. Not an animal, someone human. You don’t dare to hope, but you look up anyway: a small ball of fire is weaving its way between the tree trunks, and behind it is:
But somehow, Harry’s warm body next to his and his calm breathing lulls Draco into sleep, because the next thing he sees is a nurse smiling brightly at him as she reads his chart, telling him that he can go home whenever he wishes to. Harry helps him pack up, his clothes wrinkled and his hair mussed, but his eyes bright whenever Draco meets his gaze.
Draco just nods dumbly, while Potter leans in to kiss him again, softly. Then he flashes Draco another one of those bright smiles as he turns and walks through the door.
“Do we have to? I mean, how do you explain going undercover on assignment and coming back like this?!” Harry laughed at Draco’s perplexed expression.
Harry snorted. He knew that with five older brothers, it was inevitable that Ron knew how to get to the front first. He looked around the room, trying not to tear up at the sight of all his friends gathered around, sitting on each other’s laps or perched on tables and armrests, all looking expectedly at him.
After a second’s hesitation, Potter said something to the other man, in those awful flaccid sounds of their language, and she flicked her tail impatiently.
“I haven’t been able to stop thinking about you all day, and I had to leave my friends after lunch to lock myself in one of the toilets so I could relieve  the pressure.” The words tumble out of Harry in a rush while he wrestles with Draco’s trousers to get them off as fast as possible. It’s hard to concentrate on the task with Draco’s erection directly in front of him, straining against the flower printed fabric.
Fixed that broken door to the kitchen cabinet. And I started sorting through my photos to put in an album.
His hands are still holding you, resting on your hips, and he’s so close that you can see all the tiny freckles scattered across the bridge of his nose. Your breath comes in short bursts; you can’t seem to draw in the air properly. You swallow again, and his eyes follow the motion, then come to rest on your mouth. He licks his lips.
“I just don’t want us to get confused.” Draco sounds like he has to gather a great amount of patience, like he’s explaining something extremely complicated to a five year old. “Spending the night is a slippery slope towards—”
Draco took a deep breath to summon as much courage as he could to leave this with some shred of his dignity. “Let’s not do anything we’ll regret tomorrow, shall we?” he said, pushing off from the wall and returning inside, focusing on putting one foot in front of the other and not running away from there.
Harry even stayed when the residues of the wilting flowers started leaving Draco. He held Draco in his arms as he heaved and gurgled it out into a conjured bowl, stroked his hair and kissed his clammy forehead afterwards. And even though Draco was mortified to have Harry witness these gross bodily functions, it was soothing to have him there.
Harry made an involuntary and highly embarrassing sound, which made Malfoy look at him with a smirk.
With an exaggerated clearing of her throat, Healer Goodwin sets up a Dicta-Quill and starts casting, ignoring Harry standing a few feet away from her with his arms crossed over his chest, and instead focusing on the lights and patterns that her spells are causing. “So, Draco, how are you feeling?”
“Well… the trust issues are one aspect of why I wanted to wait. But also…” Draco starts, turning away again and curling in on himself slightly. “I’ve used other things, as you know, and I’ve even started it a few times… I mean, to have someone… but… I’ve always backed out, because I couldn’t shake that thought of someone getting stuck inside me, and… it made me tense up so I had to put a stop to it.”
You feel your cheeks heat, and you feel his gaze on you as you reach out to take the cloth off the gash, and you notice that his breathing has become shallower, quicker. When your fingers graze the skin on his hip he gasps, his stomach tensing, and you can see goosebumps appearing.
“So if you’re in love and you’re spending all of your energy buggering the life out of your supposed significant other - why aren’t you going out and eating with them?”
”Our tests show that your roots go deep, which is why you’re having trouble moving now. This usually only happens when this condition has reached its late stages, where the patient can barely talk without flowers falling out of their mouth, a stage that you haven’t reached yet, obviously. So I’d say that the reason the roots inside you go so deep is more likely because the object of your love is someone that you’ve known for a long time. Possibly since childhood or early adolescence.”
Draco drew his feet up from the water, putting them on the rock to rest his chin on his knees. “Why do
But, yeah, he’s my boyfriend now, we’re together, and I can’t honestly remember being this happy before. I keep laughing all the time, because like I said a month or so ago, he’s still a prick, but he’s a damn funny and adorable one. I’m honestly a little nervous about how things will work out between us when we get to move freely outside again, but I think it’ll be fine since we’ve known each other for so long. We’re trying to take things slow, but it’s hard (no pun intended) to have him around all the time and being able to do all the things I want to do with him. (Mostly kissing. Draco is a really good kisser, and every time we try to watch the telly we end up snogging on the sofa (and sometimes more
I tried to teach Draco how to play Backgammon today, but he kept getting annoyed that I kept winning, even though I tried my hardest not to. He’s such a sore loser. He tried to blame it on the pieces not being sentient, but, yeah no, he’s just a sore loser.
“You know…” Harry said, thinking about Draco and his antics, from his obnoxiousness to his thoughtfulness. He thought about how Draco always seemed to know when Harry was down and needed a pick me up, or when he instead needed to be left alone to brood until he’d snapped out of it. He thought about how, despite their initial fears that it would all go to shit when they were teamed up as Unspeakables, they worked together well now, because they had become so good at reading each other. He smiled again, more genuine now. “He has his virtues.”
You understand at once that this was the wrong thing to say: he stills under your hands in an unnatural way, and when you look at him, his eyes have darkened and his face has closed up. You wish you could take it back. However uncomfortable you were before, it’s nothing compared with this unease.
Stretching your hand out, you carefully graze the dried silvery green leaves with your fingertips, imagining you’re touching him instead, before you quickly extinguish that thought from your mind.
Draco uncapped the bottle with an expression like he expected something foul, but when he sniffed it, his features softened into surprise.
“This smells exactly like the one I used to have. Or, well,” he said, taking another whiff, “not quite the same. Did you add horsetail to it?”
Right. So, I… don’t really know what to say. Or write. I’ve never kept a journal. This was all Hermione’s suggestion, to help me keep the days apart during this Ministry mandated lockdown because of the Crup Flu magidemic. I don’t know, maybe it’s a good idea, all the days are starting to blend together, so. I think this is… day 12 of lockdown. Maybe I should add that to the top? Right okay I did that. Good. Great.
The hour was late, but the May air was still warm as Draco stood outside the club to take a breather. He’d really meant to only stay for a bit at Luna’s vernissage, to support Pansy who was nervous about being introduced as Luna’s girlfriend, but had ended up staying late enough to tag along to the after party. All the free wine at the art gallery had made Draco pleasantly tipsy and now he was feeling nostalgic as he watched his best friend through the window, dancing with her girlfriend. Pansy and Luna were a couple who, if you were just presented with the idea of them, seemed ludicrous, but seeing them together, they just… made sense. He’d never seen Pansy so comfortable around anyone, and it made his chest warm at the thought. He smiled to himself, then glanced to his right when he noticed someone moving towards him.
And right now I want to go into the living room and bring up the weather or something else stupid just to annoy them.
being used on Muggles and other victims during the war and it would’ve scared him. But I managed to make him a bit lighter so I didn’t sprain myself. (Good thing I have magic now, I distinctly remember dragging Dudley home after that dementor attack before fifth year, I had a sore back for weeks after that!)
have some self control Harry and stop making your friends uncomfortable), I got up and started doing my daily work out. It’s week two of the fitness challenge, which means 20 each of push ups, crunches and squats.
Hermione looked thoroughly exasperated, arms folded across her chest. Harry was strongly reminded of McGonagall and wouldn’t be surprised if Hermione started tutting and tapping her foot. “I’m sorry boys, but did this
You’ve missed him so much, missed being like this with him, so open, so vulnerable. Those stolen moments while you were still in the monastery were a mere shadow to this, and suddenly, you need so much more, you need to have him close, closer, as close as possible.
Harry is running up the stairs, taking them two at a time. His muscles are sore and he curses the fact that it’s virtually impossible to apparate into the fourth floor of a Muggle building. The entire day has felt like wading through treacle and he can almost swear that someone hexed the clock in his classroom to go slower. Or maybe it’s just the fact that he’s been desperate to go home since he arrived at uni this morning. Because he knows that Draco’s waiting for him at home. And he is painfully aware of what Draco is wearing.
A few days ago he had a massive attack in front of Potter, and he’s been feeling exceedingly ill ever since, frail and decrepit. His vision is starting to get blurry, and at the same time he’s sensitive to bright light: it’s hurting his eyes, feels like it’s burning into his brain, leaving gaping holes with burned edges. He’s not been able to go to work, instead he’s been cooped up at home with the curtains drawn, trying to remember how it felt to breathe normally.
It takes a little longer than you expected to find it, because every time the lightning strikes you need to hold Harry and whisper encouragement in his ear until he stops shivering. You’re almost ready to give up because you’re so tired and out of breath you just can’t go on, but suddenly, a dark silhouette emerges through the curtain of rain, and you yank Harry’s hand, pointing your free one towards the hut. He nods and you both sprint as fast as you can, thinking that any shelter the hut can give you will be better than this deluge.
Anyway, then I started joking about how I’m so horny all the time that I’d even be willing to have sex with Chad Michael Murray, and gladly so because that’s how hot he is and that’s how horny I am. Draco thought I was super funny, and he said he’s also extremely horny all the time, that even yesterday when I was touching myself was distracting to him, even though he’s straight as well.
You try, you really try, but everything’s changed after this. You’ve always despised those who fall for the Tempter's tricks, those whose faith isn't strong enough to resist temptation, but now you know, there is no definite right or wrong. The Lord intended us to show love, didn’t He? So how could it be wrong to love someone as much as you love Harry? How could it be wrong to feel as good as you do when you’re with him?
First I thought I’d flip him off, but then I said that it was too bad he thought so, because I was thinking that the winner would get a blow job, to help with motivation. And suddenly he was very interested in playing.
“And now?” he says with a sarcastic little half bow, which doesn’t really have the desired effect since he’s obviously already hard, his cock straining underneath the fabric of his trousers, tenting them.
He sighed, scrubbing at his forehead. Potter must’ve figured it out by now. Famously oblivious though he was, he must’ve realised what it meant that Draco ran away from the party after Pansy’s
“Would you like to do the honours?” Harry looks up at Draco’s words: his thumbs are hooked inside the elastic of his skimpy knickers. They’re barely covering his cock, half of it is peeking out, the glans already exposed and glistening with precome. He regards Harry from under his fringe in mock bashfulness. “Place them where you want them.”
“The Hermit’s hut. Long ago, or so I’ve been told, there was a man who used to live here,” you say, stroking your hand over the wooden panels, rough with neglect. The ceiling is so low you almost hit your head on it as you step further in. “He was originally a monk, but for some reason, he wanted to live on his own. So he built this little house for himself, with enough room for one person.”
“Right,” Harry said with a tight smile, not mentioning that he knew damn well where his old set was (buried deep in a box in his attic because he was sick of losing to Ron all the time). “Thanks,” he managed to grind out, hoping it sounded sincere.
Harry can’t figure out what it is about Malfoy that makes him return to him again and again. It was the same in school as well, right from the start. Of course, back then Harry was convinced it was because he hated Malfoy so much, and had every right to do so. But there’s no animosity between them now, and yet here he is, obsessing over the git once again.
“Are you doing yoga or are you practicing some kind of… live show?” Malfoy said as they got into the warrior position again, wobbling slightly on his back foot.
Draco flexes his fingers. It’s still an unusual but welcome sensation to have them respond immediately. “They feel fine. A little stiff from underuse but much better than before.”
He heaves a deep breath, almost like a sob, and you turn around, surprised to see tears in his eyes. You kiss him again, trying to pour every confusing and exhilarating feeling into it.
And it’s easy talking to her, Harry finds, now that they’ve grown out of their awkward teenage selves and have some distance to it all, not seeing the world in black and white. She’s surprisingly funny, with witty comments about the game and herself and Harry, and Harry finds himself utterly charmed by her: time flies by while her broom lies long forgotten on his counter. So when she asks him if he wants to have dinner with her that evening, “for old time’s sake” and “while she’s still in town”, he doesn’t see any reason not to. He could use a distaction, and he needs to start dating for real anyway.
“I never realized how comforting windows were,” Harry murmured, looking at the walls, “but not being able to see outside really messes with the mind, yeah?”
And, well I feel really stupid now. When she told me that I’m probably at least bisexual, and probably always have been, so many things fell into place, and when I look back at them now I’m shaking my head at how stupid I was. It started with her reminding me of Cedric, and how Draco and I used to
Everything after that was mostly a blur of blond hair and warm skin as their bodies moved together towards Draco’s chambers, while Harry’s arousal threatened to devour him.
to find out what Professor Potter wants for Christmas,” he continued, looking even more pleased with himself. “Professor Potter, when will we learn Legilimency?”
Draco’s eyes rolled back into his head, not only from Harry’s nip at his hip but also the surprising genius of his newly shirtless lover. One hand tangled in Harry’s hair as the other reached to help him unbuckle his belt. It was slapped away and once the belt was undone, his pants and trousers were unceremoniously ripped down his legs and thrown over the back of the couch. Harry nipped at Draco’s thighs, prompting him to spread them wider in anticipation. Draco’s shout seemed to echo throughout the room when Harry swallowed him down whole without warning.
The silence was deafening as every eye turned towards Draco. He tried to smile in a friendly way, but it felt like he was only pulling up the corners of his mouth into a grimace. He shouldn’t be this nervous. He was used to people judging him for how he had acted during the war, and Harry had promised the students wouldn’t give him a hard time, but even so, he was petrified.
Draco’s breath hitches, it’s almost imperceptible, but Harry notices, oh he notices, and that gives him the courage to continue.
I’ve never held another cock besides my own, but it was… exciting? It felt sort of the same but different? Also the fact that I was holding a cock, but I only felt it in my hand and not
Draco folded his arms across his chest, lifting his chin. “I have no idea what gave you that impression, Potter, but—”
Potter’s taken aback at the sight of him, the hand rubbing his neck falling to his side when he looks at Draco.
“Not yet, but— “ Draco starts, but gets interrupted by his stomach growling loudly. “Well, apparently I’m starving.”
Draco nodded, eyes bright, his bottom lip disappearing between his teeth. Harry couldn’t wait to suck it into his mouth again.
Harry tries to focus on what Draco said before about the curse and how it works. Sure, this had been the first time Harry had been the one fucking Draco, but there’s something else. There’s something niggling at the back of his head, trying to get his attention. Unfortunately he can’t think properly between his friends' constant bickering and worrying about how effectively he’s managing to keep his naked body hidden underneath the sheets.
“Draco. Draco, please.” Pansy is by his side now, throwing her arms around him, rocking him slowly, her tears wetting his cheek. “It’ll be fine, it’ll be fine, love,” she whispers.
Healer Goodwin scoffs, but it sounds gentle somehow. “Well I’m afraid I have to ask you to wake him up, because I need to cast some diagnostic spells.”
While Harry sets to the task of lighting the fire you examine the rest of the cabin. There are a few kitchen utensils left: a little pot, a kettle, a plate, a bowl. Everything for one person only. You remember how Brother David told you that the monks decided to keep the things inside this cabin, should anyone need it some time, and that whenever someone passes here it’s customary to leave dry wood for the fireplace and mend any damage to the house.
“Oh, but you like it,” Draco said, and there was a rasp in his voice that Harry hadn’t picked up on before, and it sent shivers down his spine.
(not to mention that he wasn’t even the one trying to kill me), stop being so dramatic) has become one of my best friends, but I guess that’s what happens when you’ve lived through a war.
And there’s Draco’s breath in his ear, their bodies moving together, Draco slowly pushing inside him while whispering sweet filthy things into the hollow of his throat (
“I want you, Draco, I hope you know that. I hope you know that I would endure all the punishment in the world to be with you.” You see tears gathering at the corners of his eyes. “But the one thing I can’t do is share you. Not with anyone. And I know… I know you’ll never give Him up. So I must leave. For your sake. And for mine.”
“Okay,” Draco said, rather breathlessly, in an attempt to get back on track. “Do we have a question that has to do with Mindhealing or its purpose?”
If you weren’t so offended, you might hear what he’s actually saying with those words, but you can’t focus because the indignation is flaring up inside you, the anger and disgust at what he did.
Harry grunts in frustration, because obviously Draco is not letting this go. “What’s the problem? It was
“Come, join me,” he says, grabbing your hand and yanking it, making you lose your balance and fall straight into his lap.
Harry launched a Stinging Hex that left a red welt on the side of Alex’s face. “Also I’m able to resist forced persuasion through legilimency, I can resist the fucking Imperius Curse, you idiot. Read a history book.”
Harry sighs and returns to kissing Draco’s body, because he loves the feel of Draco’s skin under his lips, and he doesn’t have the patience for his nonsense right now. He reaches the waistband of Draco’s boxers and slides them down. “Yeah? Well here’s another thing that came up and I think I’d like to focus on that instead.”
“They took him in a few hours ago. Pansy called Blaise in a panic, and Blaise told Ron about half an hour ago, and Ron told me. I think it’s something really bad.”
Suddenly he saw Harry spring into action grabbing the man's wand with one hand and hitting him squarely in the solar plexus with the other, sending him to the floor in pain. He kicked him in the gut for good measure and before Alex could turn he had his wand trained firmly on him.
Draco straightens up slowly, twitchy, and then falls to the floor on his back, slinging an arm over his eyes. He’s still panting, his chest heaving with the effort of breathing, and Harry doesn’t dare to move. He wants to comfort Draco, cradle him, stroke his cheek and make sure he’s not in pain anymore. But that’s not the kind of relationship they have, that would be far too intimate in Draco’s opinion, Harry knows that much. Because not only does Draco not do love, he doesn’t do weakness either.
Draco’s mind goes cold and clear. It’s like he’s a vessel that only takes in all the impressions around him, the soft humming of the atmospheric charms, the harsh light above him, Pansy trying not to collapse beside him. And at the same time, none of these really register, there’s only the movement of Healer Goodwin’s mouth and the words she’s uttering.
“Fuck, Draco, you have to stop scaring me like this,” she says, shoving his shoulder as if to chastise him, but there’s no malice behind it. Only worry. Sorrow.
“Well, well, well, if this isn’t my lucky day,” an all too familiar voice said right in his ear, and Harry snapped out of his mindfulness. “First I get to spend a week with the
“So it seems,” he says, looking defensive, but then his face softens. “Except…” he says, breaking off.
Harry snorts and a single tear slides down his cheek. Draco lets his hand move from Harry’s hair to wipe it away, cupping Harry’s cheek. It’s unexpectedly comforting to comfort Harry.
He lets out a sigh of relief and then he starts moving, tentatively slow at first. When you don’t protest he picks up speed, dragging himself further and further out before pressing himself in again, and it’s so good, so uncontrollably good, everything is this moment and this feeling of him inside you, filling you up so completely. His hand keeps travelling up and down your back, until he reaches around you and grabs you in hand, and you moan loudly, bucking into it with abandon. You’ve never wanted anything as much as you want this, now, here, never felt this burning desire about anything, ever. Your vision turns blurry and you squeeze your eyes shut, feeling a thousand fires inside you, every single one of them lit up by him, by his body, his laughter, his eyes on you and you’re not sure you will endure the flames, but if this is the way you go then so be it.
There’s still something Harry can’t quite grasp with this thing, and so he thinks about their situation for a while, because, well, there isn’t much more else he can do right now.
Harry pulls Draco closer, laughs against his lips and lets himself be guided into his own home while Draco quickly strips off both of their coats and scarves, tossing them carelessly to the floor.
Rooming with Potter meant that they made up one of the cooking teams as well, and now Draco was standing in the kitchen, at a loss for what to do.
Sorted out my wardrobe today and organised it. I’m thinking about giving some of the clothes to the war orphans charity shop.
Draco slumped, fidgeting with the hem of his shirt. “Shit, I should’ve taken the bait and laughed it off as a drunken mistake,” he mumbled, almost inaudibly. Then he straightened up. “No. You know what, Harry? Okay, I’ll admit I’m still a bit drunk. But not much. Only enough to get rid of my inhibitions. Only enough to go after what I want.” He looked straight into Harry’s eyes, his chin tilted up in defiance.
“Well, you have to understand that this is all very hypothetical because we haven’t gone through with many cases this severe. But the roots go deep and are an integral part of your body now, so in the very unlikely event that you do survive, removing them will leave you empty, to be blunt, which will affect your bodily functions such as breathing, circulation and mobility.”
“Yes, Potter, a date. You know, where you get to know each other and flirt a little and if you’re lucky you get laid at the end of it.”
, that you could use your fame to an advantage here. Make them bump you up to first class or something.”
“This isn’t the time to go into it,” Draco said. “It’s nearly eleven, Harry. There won’t be any way for us to test the theory if the hostages in question aren’t even awake to show it.”
“Well, the most common way, one that people use to this day, although no one takes it very seriously anymore, is to pick seven kinds of flowers, and then put them under your pillow. And then you’re supposed to dream about who you’ll end up marrying.”
Draco inhales deeply, forcibly relaxing his shoulder. “I just— At school I would never have dared to believe that this could ever happen, I— “ He swallows, his Adam’s apple bumping Harry's shoulder, and then, with a trembling voice, barely above a whisper, Draco says “I wanted you so much back then.”
“I thought we had that planned already. We pretend to be engaged to be married, madly in love because you’re under a love potion so I can get in contact with the persons responsible for the more shady things happening here,” Draco said while rummaging around in his suitcase.
Alex snapped his fingers and a blonde wizard similar to Alex in height and build entered with Harry by his side.
Draco stills, and Harry wishes the earth would swallow him whole right now. The seconds tick by slowly as Draco draws back a fraction to look at Harry.
This makes Goodwin laugh, high and clear, and just then Harry walks in with a tray laden with food. She takes a quick look at it and almost drops her chin, but manages to hide it from him. “Well, Mr Potter, I daresay that they outdid themselves with the food. I expected some heated cauldron cakes or a half eaten box of Bertie Botts, but fresh omelette and bacon? I didn’t even know they could make that. And is that treacle tart?”
“Pertinger. Shirley Pertinger,” the girl answered, batting her eyelashes. “My mum told me you see a Mindhealer to… deal with trauma and… stuff,” she mumbled, blushing furiously.
Heat rises in your face. Who else has heard you? Who else might have figured it out? Has Matthew figured it out?
He squeezes past you to examine the fireplace, and you try hard not to notice the scent of him drifting to your nostrils, heightened by the dampness.
“Should I be worried the first thing I’m thinking about after having sex is whether or not our stalker has noticed we’re tracking them?”
I don’t really know why I reacted so strongly to that failed bread, but I just felt like a deflated balloon, like all air went out of me because of that stupid sourdough. And one second Draco was patting my back in a mix of pitying and comforting, and as I turned to him he gave me this awkward hug (I already know Draco isn’t the most natural hugger due to his strict upbringing) and when I accidentally angled my hips towards him I could feel that his cock was stirring. Or maybe I was imagining it? Either way, I started rubbing myself against him. (Oh god, that makes me sound like I was dry humping him like a dog, I really wasn’t, honestly. I was just moving slightly against him and he gasped and we both started sort of rutting against each other and suddenly my hand was inside his pants and he was unbuttoning my jeans and we did it right there in the kitchen.)
And part of Harry thinks that they shouldn’t be doing this: it will complicate things, they’ve both had plenty to drink, this should be wrong. Except that when Draco presses his naked body closer to Harry’s, he’s never felt more sober in his life. It’s like his mind goes strangely crystal clear when he feels Draco’s already hard cock brush his hip, like he’s gone into some sort of hyper reality when looking into those mesmerising grey eyes locked with his. And he realises that he wants Draco to look at him all the time, that he wants to hold his attention, that that’s what he’s wanted even as an angry teenager.
Harry doesn’t have time to listen to her last words. Instinct takes over and he turns on the spot to Disapparate, not caring about the Statute of Secrecy or who might see him. His only conscious thought is that he needs to be with Draco.
Draco sets his jaw firm, looking away from her. She’s like a bloody badger sometimes, once she’s sunk her teeth in you, refusing to let go until something snaps.
, and eventually Harry had resorted to casting a silencing spell. But what was even more embarrassing was that Harry’s body had responded to those noises, and if he allowed himself to think about it, he wanted to hear them again, wanted to be the one to make Malfoy sound like that.
They began with a sun salutation, and as Harry semi squatted and raised his arms, his top rose a bit. He smirked when he heard a sharp intake of breath to his left. He turned his head slightly and smiled at Malfoy.
She heaves a great sob and turns her face away, biting her lip. He wants to tell her that it’s alright to cry, that she doesn’t have to be strong for him, but he knows that’d only make her angry with him.
...I’m pretty sure we need to go through this person’s suite to get to our suspect.” Harry pressed his ear to the door and held Draco back before straightening up again.
Harry blushes and sets the tray down, crawling into bed again after a quick assessing look at Goodwin. She purses her lips like she’s about to tell him off, but her eyes are kind.
Potter just laughed, his eyes crinkling at the corners, and if Draco hadn’t already been gone for the git he’d certainly be in danger now.
“Hi,” a voice said, and Draco’s heart leapt to his throat, hammering so wildly it felt like it was trying to get out.
You try not to think back to how it felt to have his skin beneath your fingertips, feeling his warmth and watching the life return to him. He looks at you, his gaze unwavering, but guarded. There’s something he’s refraining from telling you. You clear your throat.
Harry had a hard time keeping his eyes off Draco, who was wearing a beautiful flower crown that Ebba’s friend Saga had made for him while they were preparing the food. Harry had been given one as well, but he doubted he looked as good in his as Draco did. With the sunlight shining behind him, and the purple and yellow flowers adorning his white blonde hair, he looked positively ethereal. They’d been drinking beer and
Nüwa stifled a yawn with her tail and tried to look as interested as possible, despite being bored out of her mind. When this human had arrived, with eyes like a green reed frog, she had been flattered when he asked if she’d be willing to answer a few questions. And after she’d got over the initial shock of being able to actually
notice the way his arse perked out, or how his shirt rode up to expose his stomach, because his brain was occupied with the unexpected closeness, and not at all wondering if there were other parts of Malfoy’s body that smelled like that if one were to bury one’s nose against his skin. Finally, Malfoy apparently found what he was looking for, and he let out a contented little sigh as he came down on his feet, shaking his hair out of his eyes. He turned to Harry, and his eyes widened exaggeratedly into a look of faux surprise.
He worries his lip between his teeth, looking around the dark room. What little light is out there barely comes in through the dirty windows, but your eyes are getting used to it and you take the opportunity to take in his presence. He’s drenched in rain, water dripping from his chin, his hair sticking up at odd angles, and you smile at how it still manages to be unruly even when soaked. He gives you a quizzical look, but you just shake your head, biting back an ever wider grin.
Pansy smiles at him like the cat that got the cream. “That’s what you get for being a nosy bastard.”
Ginny was really rather friendly and lovely, and Draco noticed that she tried her best to make him feel included in the group by dragging him along on excursions in the area. But he still had trouble liking her, for the mere reason that she had the one thing he desperately wanted, the one thing he’d never have. It didn’t help that her behaviour was the exact opposite of his own around the other Gryffindors. She kept laughing all the time, always so carefree, and she was breathtaking. Even Draco could admit that, despite never having been attracted to a woman in his entire life. Potter was obviously smitten with her still, after what should now be their second year together since the war ended. He kept tickling her, playfully picking her up all the time, which she was apparently delighted by, but also seemed a bit self conscious whenever she caught Draco looking at them.
“I—” Harry starts. He knows he should take it back, tell Draco that he meant it in a platonic way, but he finds that he’s entirely unable to, and suddenly the words are rushing from his mouth, almost tripping over each other in their haste to get out.
The knocking became more and more frantic, and Harry started to panic. He couldn’t have Neville find him like this, naked in Draco’s chambers. It was more than obvious what they had been doing.
“What do you want, Draco?” he says, firmer now. “Do you want to tell me what a sinner I am? Do you want to tell the Abbot about what I did? Tell me what you want!”
But he’s not, he thinks, looking at the stunning mess in the basin. He hasn’t been for weeks now, though he’s been able to hide his predicament from everyone long enough. Except, of course, from Potter. But he can’t think about Potter, because every time he does he feels a new stab of pain in his chest, a new set of seeds taking root, growing and breaking out of him.
Mouth dry, Draco stared at the empty bottle of firewhisky pointing at him ominously. He looked up at Pansy who was regarding him deliberately, her eyes darting ever so quickly to Potter, and Draco realised that this was what she had conspired for with the other girls. For some godforsaken reason she’d probably planned for him to take Dare so she could force him to do something embarrassing in front of Potter and the rest. He had to avoid that.
“All right, gentlemen,” the clerk (apparently named Steven) said, “you’re all checked in now. Here are the keys to your room, and here’s a list of all the activities we have available. The pottery class is especially popular and will fill up quickly so if you want that one, don’t wait too long to book it. We also have couples treatments, such as massages or facials, and of course, the main thing here is the couples counselling. Please fill out this form together, and it will automatically match you with the most suitable counsellor for your needs and your personalities. And please, don’t hesitate to ask if something is unclear.” Steven upped the brightness of his smile even more, now resembling a light bulb more than a human being.
Draco flopped the down on the couch and pulled Harry up for a hard kiss, all tongue and teeth, nipping at his lips, tasting the pre-come in his mouth. “Bed. Now.”
. She smirked at Potter as she unwrapped herself from Malfoy’s arm, sliding over to Potter and rose so that she was eye level with him.
He couldn’t decide if what he felt was humiliation or disappointment. Probably both. He’d never thought Pansy would do this to him, to sell him out like this just to become a part of the Gryffindor Gang (and honorary Ravenclaw).
“Only for a while. And then Flora’s dragon necklace reminded me of you, and that got me hard again.”
You’re confused, unsure what he wants to say with this. Of course he doesn’t regret it, he’s always been the bolder of the two of you, hasn’t he?
He studies you for a while, regarding you silently. Once again you get the feeling that he can see straight through you, uncover all your secrets. “Not even if you left the monastery?”
Harry tries to think straight, but it’s difficult while looking into mercury eyes again, and the only thing present in his mind is how he wouldn’t be opposed to watching Malfoy dance.
“My mind was being forced, and it’s sick! The people that are doing this are sick! How could you just sit there and do it to me!”
At least Draco helped me with answering questions. He was sitting out of sight, just to the side of the fireplace, and he kept writing good answers for me and making the words float in front of him, so it didn’t look weird that I was looking to the side. I always become either a mumbling mess or too hostile when I’m giving interviews, but thanks to his upbringing, his work at the Ministry with Muggle-Wizarding relations, as well as his charitable work for war orphans, Draco knows more about the politics of things like these.
“I’ll have to open my own flower shop?” Draco tries, and Goodwin draws her mouth into a clear attempt to smile.
He felt Draco shudder in response, fingers dancing frantically on his shoulder as he struggled to come to terms with it.
You fetch Harry water, and you feed him pottage, and you tell him about the life and the routines of the monastery. He’s weary, but he listens attentively to what you have to say before he drifts off to sleep.
He felt incredibly pleased with himself as he cut up some oranges to make himself freshly squeezed juice, but his mood was instantly ruined by footsteps descending the stairs. He knew those footsteps, knew all too well who they belonged to. And sure enough, a moment later Malfoy entered the kitchen, dressed in a tank top and grey joggers that hung low on his hips, exposing the skin just above the waistband as he moved.
“You have your assignment, go figure it out. Dismissed. And Malfoy…” Draco turned back towards Robards.
You sit up and kiss him, cutting him off. “It’s not. Not if it was out of necessity, out of survival.”
caught on fire surprisingly well. I sort of panicked and just wanted to get rid of it so I threw it away and of course it landed on the kitchen table. Which wouldn’t be so terrible in itself, if it weren’t for the stack of newspapers that it landed on. So, well it was a disaster, really. I got so frantic I forgot the
Harry wasn’t sure if he was flexing his buttocks deliberately, or if they looked like that all the time when he was walking. Then Malfoy’s words caught up with him. “Date?” he managed to choke out.
Draco chuckles complacently and places his index finger under Harry’s chin, tilting his head up. “And then you had to hurry home. To me.”
“You’re home early,” Draco answers from the sofa where he’s sitting, long legs crossed in front of him and a book in his hands that covers his crotch. It’s more of a simple statement than a question, but Harry hears the satisfaction, hears that Draco knows Harry skipped class to come here and that it makes him immensely pleased. Instead of his usual white, Draco’s wearing a dark green shirt, no doubt to make Harry wonder what’s underneath, the absolute prick.
After ten rounds, Harry felt like he might faint from the exhaustion, but was pleased that he’d managed to win every round except for the seventh one where Malfoy had “accidentally” tripped him. The whole group was standing at the foot of the slope, all breathing heavily and gratefully accepting the water bottles that Ms Allen was handing out. Harry took a large gulp of water, but choked on it and had a coughing fit when he spotted Malfoy grabbing the hem of his sweaty shirt and peeling it off his body, his muscles moving invitingly as he did so. This wasn’t the first time Harry had seen Malfoy’s bare chest, they’d been on this training camp for three days now, but he’d never been caught off guard like this. Eyes watering, he reluctantly let his gaze wander over Malfoy’s body: his pale skin, the drops of sweat gathered in the hollow above his collarbones, his pink nipples drawn to tight buds even in the warmth of the mediterranean sun, the fair hairs below his navel, gathering into a trail running down until they disappeared under the waistline of his running tights, his hip bones jutting out, creating a little gap between them and his abdomen, a gap where one could easily slip a finger or two inside, just to feel the soft sensitive skin under one’s fingertips and —
She waited, looking to the side to not scare the man, while Potter spoke to him. His shoulders dropped, and he seemed to settle a bit, but was still tense when she rose up and tentatively stuck out her tongue. Very slowly, she moved towards him, and wrapped herself around his forearm. It was definitely uncomfortable with the dark magic in his skin, but she tried to ignore that, tried to dig deeper, to detect what was underneath, the flow of his energy, his pulse. And after a moment, when he had relaxed enough, she could easily detect it, ticking underneath her. It wasn’t as rapid a pace as the rabbits and mice she was used to feeling, but slower, steadier. Calmer.
The other week they tried it with Harry on his hands and knees, but once Draco had pushed the head of his cock inside, he’d sunk into Harry a bit too quickly and it felt awkward, not at all how Harry had imagined it. But Draco noticed Harry tensing up and withdrew without comment or trying to persuade Harry to keep going, instead replacing his cock with his tongue until Harry was like soft clay in his hands.
He knows what he has to do. Draco won’t do it apparently, so it’s up to him. It’s only fair to both of them to end this, but mostly to himself, his own heart. Because how can he keep trying to make Draco want more than what they have when he’s in love with someone else? Harry’s always been so good at protecting others, but this time he needs to protect himself.
“Fine. I’m— I’m fine,” he garbles as another wave of flowers pours out of him, blood stained and mockingly beautiful. “I’m… fine.”
You don’t know how to feel. Guilt and satisfaction are chasing each other’s tails in your head. Your body is completely boneless, and you’ve never felt this good in your entire life. This is the most intense experience you’ve ever had: lying here with Harry sleeping on you, his skin against yours, is nothing short of true bliss. But Leviticus clearly states that what you just did is an abomination, you’ve been told your entire life that loving another man is a sin, you’ve fought those feelings for so long.
Draco ran a hand through his hair, letting his head rest against his palm. “Because…” He took another deep breath, but it didn’t help, he still didn’t have the courage to look directly at Harry. “Because I thought you’d figured out how I feel about you. And I thought, why would you want to kiss me when you have a wonderful girlfriend, if not to mock me for those feelings?”
Harry nods silently, looking terrified, while Draco has to fight hard to keep from snickering. “Yes, Healer Goodwin,” they say as one.
“How so?” asked Hermione, who was perched on the kitchen counter and looking through her work notes.
Ebba let Draco take the handle with an encouraging nod, and he started to turn the handle with so much force that the entire bowl almost tipped over.
significant than a message for people to stay at home and keep distance?!). I flipped him off but he just snorted at me and turned away. I think he muttered something like “Honestly, Potter, how big can your head get?”
“Of course we’ll help you, Neville,” Draco said with his gentlest voice, the one he used to soothe students plagued with exam anxiety. “I’m sure Strutty’s fine, but we’ll join you as soon as we’re decent.”
“What are you doing here, Potter?” Draco says, because he’s not entirely sure he wants Potter here now, seeing him like this. “We’re not—”
“Well, I…” Potter still seems nervous, and he takes a big gulp of air before he speaks in a rush, “As far as I can tell, it seems that someone has developed feelings for someone. And… it doesn’t seem fair to continue this then, does it?”
“Yes,” he breathes, because he doesn’t have the strength to deny a direct question like that, not now.
Draco’s breath tickled Harry’s ear, his body pressed close, one hand resting on Harry’s shoulder. Harry turned his head, making their noses bump, and forced out a chuckle.
Ron straightened up and threw her a sharp look. “Hey! The ferret and I have a very trusting and mature friendship!”
And four days later, after Draco had cooked him dinner as a thank you for the shampoo, after they had somehow ended up in Harry’s bed and Harry had slowly and carefully slid the rose covered briefs off Draco’s body (because “these are
But, you think as you follow him into your chamber, at least in this life you’re not hiding from yourself anymore. You’re true to yourself, you’re true to him, and you’re true to the way the Lord created you.
“Draco…” he repeats, sounding like he’s tasting your name, and you find you quite like it in his mouth. “A dragon, then. Not an angel.”
think about Potter in terms of beauty, he’s only a good shag (or a bloody fantastic one if someone was pointing a wand at him).
. I know it’s not fair to throw this at you right now when you have so little time left. I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to burden you with this. I know you’re in love with someone else, and I… I don’t expect anything from you, I know that you don’t feel the same way. I mean obviously you don’t because you’re so in love with this other person that you’re dying from it!”
When Draco stated that Alex Selket was Falmouth Falcons’ best Seeker through all times, Harry had shoved him with his shoulder, but as he was a bit tipsy he’d lost his balance and fallen against Draco. Draco had caught him in his arms, holding Harry up and pressing their bodies together, and Harry had felt his stomach swoop, like when he was diving on his broom. Draco’s face had been so close, but before Harry could summon the courage to close the distance and kiss him, Draco had beaten him to it.
“Thank you,” you manage to whisper, every part of your body tensing, ready to take flight or to yield to him, you’re not sure which.
He gives you a long, hard stare, and then he casts his eyes down. “You told me I could trust you.” His voice is so small, you have to strain your ears to hear the words, but they hit you as if they were screamed.
“I had to do enough to be believable. Are you okay? I promise I didn’t mean to see anything I saw, I tried to hold back, I did.” Harry still looked a little pale, “You were incredible back there, mimicking the effects of the implanted commands while still maintaining control. I’ve never seen anything like it.” Draco ran his fingers through unruly black hair, he wasn’t even sure why he was doing it. He just needed to comfort this man that had been his friend and had trusted him. He just hoped Harry wouldn’t hate him when this was all over. “Harry, are you okay?”
He’s particularly offended when they’re hawthornes, since that’s one of the flowers he knows the meaning of intimately, having researched all there is to know about his wand and its heritage and powers. Try as he might to block it out, all the different symbolic meanings flow through his mind as if on a loop:
And… and then we sort of ended up having sex. Not… not full on penetrative one’s cock up the other’s arse, but… some friendly hand jobs sort of. I don’t even know how it started, or, well if I think about it, it was that we were goofing around and I accidentally brushed my hand against his crotch, and… I could feel him through his trousers and he was hard and getting rapidly harder. And then I heard myself say “Would it be super weird if we wanked each other off?” and he shook his head vigorously, and before I knew it we had both shoved our pants and trousers down and were
Draco whined at Harry’s declaration and latched his hands onto his hips. A loud groan left him as Harry descended upon his neck with bruising bites and kisses. Draco pushed down on Harry’s hips, grinding his hardness into the answering one he found there. The vibrations from Harry’s growls against his neck had Draco melting into the couch. He was pliant and warm and didn’t want it to stop, but there was a slight prickling at his conscience that made him lift his hands to push at Harry’s shoulders.
You don’t answer, you’re too occupied remembering how to breathe, how to not collapse in a heap on the ground.
Harry woke up slowly to the sound of birds chirping outside the window. He squinted at the daylight slipping in from a gap between the curtains, stretching with a yawn before he started fumbling for his glasses. But his nightstand wasn’t where it used to be. Confused, he propped himself up on his elbows, rubbing at his eyes and looking around him. Where was he?
And afterwards, when they’re lying sprawled out on Draco’s bed, their bodies cooling off and Harry’s semen drying on his stomach, Harry still doesn’t know what he wants from Draco. He only knows that he definitely wants this,
“You shouldn’t even feel guilty about what we’ve done! If you feel guilty it should be because you made a promise of chastity, not because you love — I mean not because you want to…” he says, his voice breaking at the end and he looks away, clenching his teeth.
“Harry, we’ve been friends for a while now. I believe we’ve developed a certain level of trust working together. What is bothering you?”
She motioned with her tail to keep him talking, concentrating on the man’s - Malfoy’s - pulse again. And then she felt it, with no uncertainty, what she had seen before in his behaviour, could sense it in her entire body, so much that it almost made her dizzy, almost made
You can’t let it happen again. This must be your ordeal of fire, this must be the Tempter testing you. It’s laughable how you always imagined it would be so simple, an obvious temptation, like a sumptuously rich meal tantalising you. But of course, He doesn’t work in those obvious ways, does he? Of course you were to be lured in gradually, so you wouldn’t notice until it was too late. Well, it’s not too late now, you’re on guard now, and you can’t,
“Well I didn’t… I didn’t tell them it was you, but… I guess they’ll find out soon enough anyway, right?”
Potter stilled, and after what seemed a lifetime and a half, he cleared his throat. His voice was soft but a bit unsteady when he spoke.
You look at him, trying to overcome your embarrassment at stating your wish so clearly. “I am. I’m really sure.”
“You’re not asking me why I didn’t tell you about some ancient curse that threatened to get us stuck to each other?”
and, ironically - considering how they started out in their formative years - Draco has managed to create a safe space for Harry to explore and discover all the new ways to have sex. With patience and intuition he’s guided Harry through some of it, and Harry’s been so eager to try out more with Draco that he’s started to notice that his uni work has been suffering a bit lately.
“I can’t believe you asked if he was taking the piss.” Harry’s giggles developed into full-blown laughter. Draco’s lips twitched and eventually, he was laughing as well.
be a bonus, but I’ve also missed seeing your gorgeous arse in those running tights terribly, and I thought this was my best chance.”
“I know,” Harry said, untangling Draco’s arms from his sleeves before he started working on his own shirt. “I didn’t want to scare you, but I had to play the part.”
Draco looks up at Harry extending his hand towards him. He’s smiling, but it’s a bit shaky around the corners, and when Draco looks more closely he notices that Harry’s hand is trembling. And he realises that Harry’s afraid too. But he’s asking Draco to take the leap with him, into unknown territory. Together.
His last conscious thought is that he wishes he didn’t have to put her through this, make her hurt like this, before his knees give way and everything goes black as he passes out in front of her.
Even if he annoys the hell out of me most of the time, at least he’s great company. I never thought I’d be friends with Draco (who would have?!), but I’m really grateful to have him around and that we get along so well together now that he’s not a racist git. I mean he’s still a git, but at least he’s not racist. We’ve had a lot of talks about our past since we became flatmates a year ago, and we’ve talked about it more lately, when we’ve had trouble sleeping and such.
The vines around Draco’s heart flex at the sound of Potter’s voice, and when he looks towards the door, sure enough, there’s Potter standing in the doorway, looking like a lost crup. Pansy draws a breath beside him, but he gives her a glare and she keeps whatever she was about to say to herself.
. But their frantic snogging came to an abrupt halt when they suddenly realised they weren’t alone anymore.
“Yeah, but, we could get married and not… tell anyone. Just to get unstuck. And then I could propose to you again, properly this time. And we could plan a wedding for show, so your parents will be satisfied. With the added bonus that we’ll be able to have sex however we like.”
Draco removes his fingers and shifts a bit on the bed, murmuring a lubrication spell, and then Harry feels it; the soft hardness of Draco’s cock nudging at his entrance. Draco’s brows are furrowed in concentration as he’s lining himself up and then slowly pushing himself inside Harry, and Harry hisses at the intrusion, at the sting of it, but somehow it also feels so
Malfoy was slow to answer, he was biting his lower lip, looking at Harry assessingly. “I usually save them for special occasions. So no, I don’t think so,” he said finally before leaving Harry alone on the sofa, confused and achingly hard.
When you go to bed that night, you have trouble sleeping. You shut your eyes firmly, trying with all your might to concentrate on breathing calmly, but there’s a restlessness in your body, and you only see him in your mind. You toss and turn and sigh, and you desperately try to ignore the reaction your body has, but it won’t do. You clench your fists so tightly your nails prick your palms, and you chant through seven Ave Marias and three Pater Nosters before you’re finally able to fall into a fitful sleep.
Harry groaned. “It’s worse than I anticipated. He’s always complaining about how I leave stuff all over the flat, but he’s way worse than me.”
Potter chuckled, shuffling closer, and Draco’s palms suddenly felt extremely sweaty. He tried to wipe them as discreetly as he could on his trousers.
You start cleaning his wounds, and you try not to notice how surprisingly smooth his skin is, how dark it looks compared to your almost translucent hand washing it. This pilgrim must’ve travelled far, judging by the looks of him with his unshaven face and tanned skin.
“So fucking crass,” Draco scoffs, but when Harry wraps his lips around the crown of his erection to suck lightly at it, he hisses in pleasure, his hands coming to tangle in Harry’s hair. “Oh
Pansy’s knees buckle and she slides down, right there on his doormat, while bringing a shaking hand to her mouth. “He did?”
When they reach his flat, Draco is exhausted and sweaty, and he lets his cloak fall to the floor without bothering to pick it up and hang it even though he knows it’ll get wrinkled beyond recognition. What’s the point anyway? Who cares if you’re impeccably dressed when you’re a hair’s breadth from the afterlife?
So after slowly eating what Harry brought him, Draco lies back against the pillows again, Harry curling up beside him. But when Harry begins snoring softly in his ear, Draco still has trouble sleeping. He’s drowsy from the food and the late hour, but his brain can’t settle down. He’s still afraid, terrified of losing this, of making himself vulnerable only to be let down. Is it really worth it?
With a tentative glance at Harry, Draco drags himself out the tiniest bit and drives back in again, and Harry almost loses his mind at how amazing he feels, how inexplicably good it feels to be stretched around Draco’s cock like this. It’s better than any toy he’s ever used, so much softer but rougher at the same time. Draco does it again, a little bit further this time, a little bit faster, and Harry can’t help but let out a moan, which makes Draco smirk in a highly pleased way. Then, he starts fucking Harry, still slow and measured, restrained, and Harry loses himself in the sensation of Draco’s cock sliding in and out of him, of his hands holding onto Harry’s hips to guide his thrusts.
Draco strokes his palms over Harry’s thighs, up to his arse, strangely tender, and Harry looks down at him because he loves to see Draco’s soft pink lips wrapped around his cock, sliding up, up, up.
Luna’s question makes Harry splutter his coffee all over himself, and in a panic he checks to see whether Ginny and Pansy heard her too. Thankfully, Ginny is in the middle of a reiteration of her latest training session, and Pansy is looking at her in awe. Harry turns to Luna and laughs as heartily as he can. “What are you —?”
Draco nods, grabbing Harry’s biceps and spinning them into darkness. Surprisingly they land outside Harry’s flat, and Harry wonders fleetingly if it means something, wants to ask why Draco brought them here this time. But Draco is standing so close behind him, undulating his hips slowly against Harry’s arse, and all other thoughts disappear. It even takes a while before Harry manages to open the door, because he’s so turned on that his hands are trembling.
Potter seemed to relax at the words, probably because Draco hadn’t told him to sod off. Yet. He shifted slightly. “Bit uncomfortable, isn’t it?”
He waves to Ginny and Pansy and struggles to put on his coat, that he apparently managed to turn half inside out when he arrived. The air is cold and crisp when he steps out onto the pavement, his breath leaving traces in the air in front of him. He rounds the corner and there’s Draco leaning against the wall, one foot propped up behind him. Just like that first time in the club he’s smirking knowingly at Harry, and Harry feels like when he’s on a broom, doing a daring dive. He slows down, because he wants to look at Draco, really see him, all confident and glorious in front of him.
“I think you’re right, Neville,” he said as he waved him off. “We’ll try our best though. And… We’d appreciate it if you… didn’t mention this to anyone. Not yet, at least.” He glanced at Harry, who nodded.
“Whatever you’re willing to tell me,” he says, sighing and then frowning a little when you take the dressings off the deeper wounds on his stomach.
“We are, but only under very specific circumstances. Firstly, it must be believed that the anticipated benefits would outweigh the risk of having the patient’s mind penetrated in that fashion.” Oh dear Merlin, he’d said “penetrated” in front of all the students, why had he used that word? Nevermind, he couldn’t undo it, and if he gave them any sign he knew its indecent second meaning, things would be even more awkward. He had to power through this. “Secondly, there has to be a third party present to ensure that the therapist only accesses the memories relevant to the patient’s healing. It is also fiercely debated whether this kind of treatment is actually helpful for patients who are so traumatised that their minds are trying to protect them by locking away these memories.”
He doesn’t finish his sentence, because he doesn’t know how to. Instead he heads towards the door, a mumbled “bye” thrown over his shoulder, and when he turns back to wave lamely, he notices that Draco is rubbing a hand over his sternum this time as well.
“I mean he’ll do anything to save someone’s life, including yours. Just,” she gesticulates with her hand, “tell him he needs to confess his love for you and you’ll be rid of this.”
“Yeah, I know, it came as a shock to me, too,” he said, which made Hermione spray her tea all over the table and collapse in a fit of laughter and coughing. Ron smacked her on the back repeatedly until she straightened up again and wiped the tears from her eyes.
“Right, right. Thanks Pansy,” Harry mumbled as he carefully peeled the tape from the paper, both so he wouldn’t tear it and so he could busy himself with the task instead of thinking about how Draco was holed up in St Mungo’s on Harry’s birthday.
“Where are we?” Harry asks behind you, startling you out of your thoughts. His breathing comes in heavy bursts and it makes you aware of how close he is, how much he smells of the rain and the woods, how his body heat radiates towards your damp and shivering skin.
Draco had known it would be a bad idea to go on holiday with Harry Potter and the rest of his Gryffindor cohort. He’d known that he’d be deeply uncomfortable most of the time, known that he’d feel entirely out of his comfort zone to be spending two weeks in a cottage by the beach in Cornwall. And yet, he’d agreed to go anyway. Because Pansy had only been dating Luna for two months and was still unsure about how well she fit with Luna’s friends, and Draco loved Pansy more than anyone in the world. So when she’d asked him to come with for moral support (“Please, Draco, I can’t be the only Slytherin among the war heroes! Please please pleeeeeaaaaase!”), he couldn’t turn her down.
Draco looked over his shoulder to acknowledge he’d noticed his new companion, and Potter gave him a tentative smile as he gracefully climbed up on the rock to sit cross legged beside him.
“No. We decided we’re better off as friends, and that we should break it off before we grew wary of each other.”
Malfoy grinned in a most predatory way, looking Harry up and down while leaning back against an olive tree. “I’m sure I have no idea what you’re talking about, Potter.”
“What do you mean?” Harry said, peeking out of the door before he remembered that this wasn’t his own room, and he was wearing a dressing gown that clearly wasn’t his.
“Do you feel it too?” Harry said, staring at Draco writhing underneath him. “It’s like… everything is magnified.”
He has no idea who this person that Draco wants instead of him is, and even less how Draco could go on being fuckbuddies with Harry when he wanted someone else, but he’s not sure he wants to find out. Everything’s a mess, really, and he doesn’t know how to sort it out since he can’t really talk to anyone about it, so he tries to just move on one day at a time. The way things usually go.
But something’s wrong. The dull ache in his chest somehow transforms the chuckle into a cough, and suddenly he can feel something growing inside him, from that spot close to his ribs: moving, forcing its way up. It tickles and burns and irritates his throat, he needs to clear it, and that’s when it happens: as if in slow motion, a tiny flower falls out of his mouth, onto Potter’s bottom lip, then down onto the white sheets. Draco stares at it moving through the air, stares at it lying there on his bed. Innocently rounded white leaves formed like a soft star, with greenish stamens. It looks like the essence of purity, except for the blood stains splattered around it.
Now Harry and Draco had gotten together before at pub nights, ministry functions, etc., but this week was different. Everything was more intimate and Harry’s heart really couldn’t take it. He had finally had enough come Friday and his control snapped. They were having a few drinks at a club after dinner when all of a sudden Harry felt a hand on his thigh and he froze. Now, this shouldn’t have startled him considering they’d been trying to touch often, just to get used to the familiarity,  but this one caught him off guard. Draco’s hand was closer to his crotch than it had been before and he wasn’t looking at Harry. He followed Draco’s line of sight and spotted a well-built man eyeing their table. Harry wasn’t sure what was going on, or even if their act was convincing enough, but he wasn’t willing to risk an early discovery. He slipped his hand under Draco’s chin and turned his face towards him. He slid towards Draco in the booth, tangling their legs under the table.
You both start tugging at each other’s clothes, discarding them as you move to the little bed. When you both collapse on it, you have the entire expanse of Harry’s naked body in front of you, more beautiful than you remember it from your previous visit here. You reach out, sliding your hand from his clavicle, over his sternum and down to his stomach, and you can’t stop your hand from playing with those hairs, running your fingers through them, scraping your nails lightly against his skin. Harry hisses and arches his back, his hips bucking towards you, his hardness giving a little twitch.
“Breathe, Harry,” he says gently, and Harry exhales on a rush, realising he’s been holding his breath in anticipation of what is to come. Draco leans forward to stroke the hair out of Harry’s face, his hand lingering warmly on his cheek. “You need to breathe to relax, darling. I’ll take it slow, I promise.”
The students all laughed again, and Harry said “Hey!”, but when Draco looked over at him he was smiling fondly.
“Draco, hi,” he heard Neville say breathlessly after Draco opened the door. “I’m sorry, were you sleeping?”
The bed is not much more than a slab of wood with four legs under it, beside a cupboard where you find a pile of blankets. You turn around to hand him one, and the vision in front of you makes you gasp audibly.
Malfoy shrugged again, waving his hand dismissively. “Yes yes, well, mystery solved, now please leave me to my uni work.”
,” she said with an exaggerated glance over at Potter, “thank you so much for offering, I appreciate it. I just think
I am so fucking sick of this fucking book club and the constant talking about fucking Astoria. It’s always
Ron gave Harry an apologetic look. “Sorry, Harry, I’ll tell Ginny off for moving in with Parkinson,” which really was only half the reason Harry had ended up being flatmates with Malfoy.
“Harry…” you say, but you don’t know how to continue, how to explain the turmoil inside you. The longing, the loss, the guilt, all of it a confusing mess spinning around inside your head, day and night. You’re so very confused, so very tired.
When you open your eyes, Harry’s watching you with a thoughtful expression, sucking his bottom lip into his mouth.
“Ow! Why’d you do that?” Harry yelps as his shin starts hurting and he can feel a bruise blooming on it.
“I don’t need a bloody potion to want Draco Malfoy, you fucking moron. He’s brilliant, and witty, and fascinating as hell. Maybe you missed all that when you were trying to own him for his pretty face and gorgeous arse, but I suppose that’s your loss because he will NEVER be yours.”
I’ve decided to cook him his favourite meal and tell him over dinner. That way, if he gets angry with me, at least we’ll have something nice to eat.
And you shouldn’t do this. What you’re doing is a sin, an abomination against the Lord’s will, but his skin is so soft, his body so warm and firm and
Draco started a book club with Astoria this week, and they’ll be discussing the books through fire calls. He asked me if I wanted to join them, but I couldn’t even get past the first few paragraphs. I’m not really an avid reader during normal times, and right now my ability to focus is severely lacking.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Ron told her, making Harry look up at him with a grateful grin. But when he did, Ron didn’t return his gaze: he was staring at Hermione and the two of them seemed to be having a silent conversation. Harry looked between them in confusion, and after a moment, Ron looked like he’d had an epiphany. “Ooooh. You’re right, Hermione, how did I not see this coming?”
“Ah, hello, Mr Potter. I’m Draco’s Healer, Sadie Goodwin. I’m afraid I have to ask you to leave this bed while I run some tests and diagnostic spells.”
“Took you long enough,” Draco drawls, but there’s a glimmer in his eyes as Harry approaches leisurely, and Harry is far too gone, he realises as he fits himself in front of Draco and puts his hands on his hips to tug him closer. Draco has put up warming charms, and it makes Harry feel like they’re in their own little safe bubble.
He tries not to think too hard about it. Of course, it hurts, like tiny knives scratching their way from his lungs and up through his throat, constantly drawing attention to what is happening inside him. But he needs to put the thoughts about the blood aside, how it’s leaving him along with the petals, because of this impossible, stupid
“Yes! Yes, give the poor man some space to think!” Ron hastily said, his expression amix of relieved and frantic.
Draco woke slowly, he was seated in a padded chair of some sort, his arms tied behind him. He opened his eyes and saw that he was sitting in a room very similar to the one he and Harry had had their “session” in. He looked around frantically for Harry but couldn’t see him anywhere. Panic rose in him and he began testing his bonds, scanning the room for anything he could use as a weapon once he’d freed himself. Then his blood froze as he heard a soft laugh behind him.
“Yes, I recall. And it was tough for a little while there, but then I realized something. Some people just don’t know what's good for them. I was only trying to help you, Draco, keep you safe. You didn’t need a job! Between us, we had plenty of money and all that work!  Day in, day out, with people who might want to hurt you or take you away from me? Don’t get me started on your friends, that Blaise asshole definitely wanted to get into your pants, and Pansy, she hated me, always telling you not to listen to me. I know what’s best for you, what foods you should eat to keep you nice and trim for me, what you look best in, and you have to admit, my taste in decorating and entertainment is just better than yours darling. I was only doing what was best.” He spoke so sweetly as if what he said should be obvious to any child...or pet.
You walk for what feels like hours before you realise you’ve passed this particular tree before. You also realise you have no idea where you are, or where you’re supposed to go. You close your eyes, trying to focus on breathing deeply and not letting the fear take you over.
“As best we can, love.” He intertwined their fingers and kissed the back of Draco’s hand before they entered the Head Auror’s office.
, the thrum of their magic twisting and turning, filling the room with crackling energy, until Draco came with a shout, his arse clenching around Harry’s cock, pulling him over the edge too.
“I can’t believe— “ He cuts himself off, pulling in even closer to Harry, and Harry knows it’s out of embarrassment. Regular Draco is the opposite of an open book, always guarded and keen on keeping his feelings a secret. But post orgasmic Draco is always more talkative and free-spoken, and Harry knows that if he’s still flustered it must mean it’s something he’s embarrassed about.
The staff on duty had tried to get Harry to leave Draco’s bed but he’d staunchly refused, arguing that he was the very thing Draco needed to recover, and once the Healers had confirmed that Draco was in fact recovering, and rapidly so, they gave up and left them alone. Although one nurse insisted that Draco needed more space and had transfigured the bed into a double. Which hasn’t really made any difference since Harry’s been plastered to Draco’s body ever since, only leaving once to go to the bathroom, during which Draco missed his presence more than he’d ever be willing to admit.
All your life, for as long as you can remember, you’ve been inside your head, always analysing, contemplating, observing. But the time you spend with Harry is the first time you’re in your body, the only time you’re truly present.
But having to fight to get any air at all into his lungs makes it hard to scoff. And it’s hard to scoff at the way those beautiful petals are bathing in blood. His blood. There’s so much fucking blood.
“Yeah I think that’s the one, but I can never remember the name of it,” Ron says once everything seems to be in order. “Hokey pokey? Hibbernasty?”
“There’s a difference between what Draco wants and what he pretends he wants,” Luna says, smiling like she thinks he’s being adorably stupid. “But please make sure you don’t wait too long. I think he needs to hear it.”
Potter shifted a bit, like he was uncomfortable. She must be close to the truth then. But why did he want to keep talking to her so much?
“Oh please, Potter, I’m merely fetching a glass,” Malfoy said, pressing himself so close that his arm brushed Harry’s before he reached up towards the cupboard. Harry’s head was still turned to him, and suddenly he had his nose full of the smell from Malfoy’s armpit, and Harry almost lost his bearings. It wasn’t that the smell was unpleasant at all, but rather… enjoyable? It was like a concentrated essence of Malfoy’s smell, musky and sweet, and Harry felt a tingling sensation in his spine, spreading forwards to his belly and down lower. What the fuck?
“I’m sorry! I accidentally knocked the bottle over when I was pouring it out. I promise I’ll get you a new one.”
The parchment then recorded only one set of footfalls moving hurriedly away from their door. Apparently, Harry had been right about lurkers checking in on them and that made Draco eternally grateful they had ignored their inhibitions and gave in to their desire for each other.
Draco blinked, confused, and turned his head towards Potter. He was so close that it would’ve been hard for Draco to focus on him even if he’d been sober. Which he wasn't. And neither was Potter, apparently. Very much apparently. Because why in Merlin and Morgana’s name would he be standing here, basically
Someone is coming up behind you on the gravel path, a little too slowly for it to be someone walking, a little too fast for it to be someone working on it, and it surprises you to hear Brother Matthew muttering “You miss him terribly, don’t you?” when he is finally within hearing distance.
“Right, it’s settled then. We both find ourselves a suitable partner for the night, or for the duration of the trip, even, and we make sure we sleep in their rooms. You’re not half as dim-witted as you look, Potter, I’ll give you that.”
Ron nods, scratching the side of his nose with his wand, which makes the potatoes fly up in the air and crash down into the pot, splashing water everywhere. “Shit!” he says, aiming his wand at the mess to siphon the water from the cupboard doors.
Draco’s eyes are shooting daggers at him. No, not daggers. Icicles. “Assuming there will be a next time.”
“Did you think about me today, Harry?” Draco pants in between kisses. “Did you think about me in these knickers and what you want to do with me?”
I don’t really know what went wrong with Ginny and me. I mean, we were happy, sort of. We liked each other’s company, she always knew how to make me laugh, and the sex was great. But there was always this feeling that there was something missing, apart from the things I mentioned yesterday, and I still haven’t figured out what that was.
She tuts, but lets it go as the oldest child starts examining your supply of dried chamomile, and she promptly leaves, leaving a welcome silence behind her.
“You’re both dismissed,” Robards said. “I want a written report by tomorrow, but be sure to make it short. Now please get out of my sight.”
So, I probably won’t be writing as much now, because I’m a bit occupied at the moment, and I don’t really mind right now if every day looks the same, because as long as it involves being with Draco, I think I’m okay with that.
“Harry,” you breathe before you crash your lips together, with such force that you press him up against the door, making him gasp. His hair feels so familiar sliding between your fingers, and your heart leaps in elation at seeing him again, having him close once more.
A boy in the third row raised his hand and Draco nodded to him. “Are you allowed to use Legilimency on a patient?”
The first time I took it in my mouth I got a little too eager and I gagged a little, but I noticed that if I did it with a little more patience I could fit more and more of him inside me. But it was hard to go slow, because Draco kept making all these amazing sounds, and I wanted to go faster to make him sound like that even more, because
He sits down on the bed, looking up at you with shiny eyes. There’s so much adoration in his gaze that you feel exposed in more ways than one, you have to look away again. Then he tugs gently at your hips, and you answer by straddling his lap, capturing his lips with your own, because you can’t tear yourself from him. He runs his hands along your back and it makes you shiver, it grounds you, lighting up every inch of your skin, and when he grabs hold of you to lie you down on the hard bed, you follow him, pliant in his arms.
Two days ago we were watching One Tree Hill and we started talking about how hot Chad Michael Murray is, because hello, he is, anyone can see that, straight or not. (Draco didn’t agree though, he thought that James Lafferty, who plays the brother, was way hotter, which is completely wrong, but to each their own I guess.)
“Harry,” you say, and something stirs inside you. It feels familiar, like coming home, like breathing. “Harry.”
Draco couldn’t swallow him fast enough. He wanted Harry to use him and tear him apart piece by piece. He wanted this to last forever, but soon Harry's hips shuttered and he let go with a long groan and a few curses. Come spilled over Draco’s lips as Harry pulled out and slid down to lick and kiss the last traces from his face.
Slowly, he slings his leg around yours, hooking you closer, looking at you questioningly, but you can only nod, you’re too gone for words, too wrapped up in your desire. Then he reaches down between you, taking both of you in one hand and you gasp so loudly it’s almost a scream, your head tipping back of its own will. He takes the opportunity to kiss you right below your jawline, his mouth hot on you, his hand wrapping firmly around you and the hardness of him pressing so deliciously against you, and all you can do it try to remember how to breathe, because all else is forgotten: your family, the monastery, your own name, God himself.
“Yeah. Yeah, you’re probably right,” Harry said, feeling relieved. But when he glanced over at Hermione she didn’t look entirely convinced.
Draco pulled away, turning around to trap the warm, familiar sensations that had sparked in his chest before they caught fire and spread lower. “A couple in love,” Draco managed to get out. “A couple who can’t keep their hands off each other.”
Anyway, after the interview (that went smoothly all thanks to Draco) I started a sourdough base. I’ve looked up how to do it the proper way and bought special flour to get the best results. Draco laughed at me. Bet he won’t laugh when I have delicious bread and he doesn’t.
Draco took in the sight of Harry, flushed face and chest heaving, eyes unfocused and watering down the sides of his cheeks. “Harry,” he took a step back and pulled Harry’s chin up so their eyes met. “No one is in your head. I’m not. It’s just you...He’s...He’s gone.”
You wait, because you’re not sure if he’s angry with you or if there’s something else that makes him shut it in.
It’s such a marvelous thing, coming inside that warm velvety softness of Draco’s mouth. Harry’s driven almost mad by how good it feels when his cock pulses its release while Draco’s still moving up and down the length of it, only slower now, allowing Harry to come down from his rush. Harry lets his head fall back, his hand in Draco’s hair relaxing, and Draco draws off. When Harry looks up again Draco’s wiping his lips with the back of his hand, and Harry scoots forward, leaning down to kiss him. He loves to taste himself on Draco, loves to know there’s some traces of him left. But this time, Draco turns away, his hand curled into a fist, covering his mouth.
He didn’t have much of a hand in it himself though, shut away as he was in his broom shop, hiding from the world among twigs and tools and broom polish. It started when Ron went into Auror training and eventually became partnered with Blaise. Everyone was surprised at how well they fit working together, and how fast they became close with each other. Harry most of all because he had only ever seen Blaise as a smug twat, prancing around Hogwarts, living off his mother’s money that she’d inherited in shady ways. But as it turned out, Blaise was a very thoughtful and generous person, and he had the same sarcastic humour as Ron, and once the two of them were friends, it soon became natural for everyone to start hanging out together. Suddenly house affiliation didn’t matter, old prejudices were thrown out the window, amends were made and apologies expressed.
Draco is quiet, breathing measuredly, a flush creeping up on his neck. Harry bites his lip so hard he almost draws blood to suppress his giggles.
Then he grabs you and kisses you hard, fast, and you can taste the desperation on his lips, before he lets go as if burned and turns, walking away in long strides before you even have the chance to catch your breath and call for him.
“Fuck, Harry,” Draco pants wetly, his body pressed tightly to Harry’s. “You’re hard again. You’re fucking unbelievable.”
“Are you alright, Malfoy?” Harry said as he, with a sigh, went into the downward dog, glancing at Malfoy, who quickly turned his face towards the floor. It was hard to see properly, but Harry thought he could see Malfoy flushing. He got into the warrior position, arching his back a little more than strictly necessary to accentuate his arse.
“Okay, fine, I can take a hint,” Potter says, flashing Draco one of his most dazzling smiles that would’ve made him weak in the knees if he weren’t already lying down. Not that he’d ever admit that to Potter, who proceeds to rake a hand through his soft messy curls and then stretch his entire body with an exaggerated yawn.
what we’re doing here, we’ve been doing it for months now and it’s working fine. You don’t have to bring it up every single time,” Potter says, his voice sounding a bit subdued, his back towards Draco while he’s buttoning his trousers.
“Thank you,” Harry said, smiling at them all. “Now, as you all know, we have Mindhealer Draco Malfoy with us today to tell us about his work. I want you all to behave and
of him. And to have this intimate moment with Draco, to know that, despite their past, he’s happy that Draco’s the first one to be this close to him. It’s so arousing to Harry that he finds himself hurtling towards his third orgasm for the day. Draco shudders over him, hips jerking in tiny movements and he takes Harry’s cock in his hand, stroking it slowly but firmly.
I know I have a lot of things I could take care of, like organising my wardrobe, or fixing that broken cabinet door in the kitchen, or sort through my photographs, but… I don’t feel like it. I assumed that having this massive amount of time I’d actually get things done, but it’s just making me
“Hey! Can the two of you calm down? If you keep squirming around like that I’ll be forced to see more of Harry’s bum than I’ve ever had any desire to.”
I had burned myself pretty badly on the oven mitts, but he took care of that as well. I don’t know where he learned those healing spells, he’s probably known them since he was a child, but he cast them on me and my hand got really warm, in a nice way. It was like his magic was wrapping around me and soothing the pain, more than the actual spell, it was like it was
Harry nods, unable to speak around the lump of affection in his throat, and then he gasps as Draco’s finger, slick with lube, circles his hole.
Oh who am I trying to fool, I’ll let him have some anyway. If only to keep him from nagging me about having a taste. He can be so fucking persistent.
But really, I realise I should’ve done this sooner. The time leading up to this quarantine has been very strange, and a bit stressful with all the uncertainty. And writing is a great way to sort out my thoughts and stuff. Imagine if I had done this during the war. It would’ve been impossible though, because of safety, should anyone find my dairy and see the things Ron, Hermione and I got up to. And also, I wasn’t the most mature human being at the time and would’ve probably considered it to be “too girly”. Well, past-Harry, there’s nothing wrong with things for girls, or things that girls like for that matter (actually, as long as people do what makes them happy anyone can do what they want. The concept of things being for girls and boys only is a bit ridiculous. Like keeping a diary).
Harry growled into his neck. “Stop me now if you don’t want this, otherwise I’m going to absolutely obliterate you tonight. I want you so badly.”
inside him without waiting for him to adjust. When Draco starts to fuck him roughly, holding him down while he pounds mercilessly into him, Harry isn’t sure he’ll ever meet someone who can give this to him, and it doesn’t take long before he’s coming violently onto the sheets, his groans muffled by the mattress against his mouth. Draco keeps fucking him like a machine even after Harry has come, panting things like “your arse was
“Yeah, er, I guess you have a point. I just… I think, since we’re going to live together, we need to establish some… rules, or guidelines, on how to dress properly,” Harry said, shifting in his seat to cross his legs.
It’s Pansy’s voice, charged with fear, with panic; her fist against the wood of the door, pounding, pounding, pounding. Or could it be his own head? He’s not sure, everything is foggy, like he’s wrapped up in cotton wool. But he needs to reassure her.
Draco scoffed, shaking his head. “And to think I usually defend you when people call you oblivious.”
“So, how’s living with Malfoy going?” Ron asked, while making sure his carrots were being chopped correctly and flicking his wand at the stove to light the fire.
Draco let out a dry laugh and grabbed his hand with more force than necessary. “Oh, darling, why didn’t you say so earlier?”
Draco scoffed. “Right. Perhaps you want to hear me say it? Is that it? Do you want me to admit how pathetic I am for pining after you for the better part of a year despite you having a very lovely and beautiful girlfriend? Because I am well aware of how pitiful that makes me, Potter, no need to worry about that.”
Slowly, Draco continues thrusting in and out of him before he stops and drapes himself over Harry’s back, leaving tiny huffs of breath over Harry’s skin. Harry is still catching his breath, and when Draco draws himself out, Harry moans at the loss of his cock filling him. His legs are trembling and he needs to lie down, so he collapses on the bed, onto his own come that has gone cold by now, but he doesn’t care. Draco lies down beside him and Harry rolls over slinging a leg over his hips, still panting. They lie like this for a few minutes, basking in the afterglow, and Harry is so bonelessly satisfied, so wonderfully exhausted that he’s starting to drift off. But of course, Draco nudges him.
“No, Draco says, his voice sounding odd and he clears his throat again. “No, I must’ve— There must be something caught in my throat.”
“Well, I guess I keep forgetting since the house elves always took care of that at the Manor. And at Hogwarts as well,” Malfoy said with a shrug.
“I have no idea what you mean,” Harry said, arching his back as far as he could when he went into the upward dog for the last time. “Unless — mmm, that’s the spot — “ he said as he bent into the downward dog, “unless you find this… distracting?” He made sure to push his bum out as far as he could when he did the half lift, and Malfoy growled lowly. Harry folded himself, happy that this position made it impossible for Malfoy to see his grin, but gave him what Harry knew was a glorious view of how flexible Harry was.
In truth, Harry didn’t think he could handle drinking. It would have been nice to think they could drink the Bond issue away, but years of therapy and training had taught him it wouldn’t be a wise choice.
“Yes, well, the feeling is mutual, you sentimental old man,” he said, laughing at Harry’s indignant squeak.
“We need to go back. It’s almost time for Nones,” you say instead of examining what this aggravation is.
“Uh, yeah, thanks Malfoy, I appreciate it,” he mumbled, glancing up when Malfoy sauntered off towards his room, the twin dimples above his arse moving tantalisingly as he went.
Harry draws a shuddering breath, sniffling. “Yeah. It is,” he whispers. He brings a hand to wipe his cheeks. “Shit. I’m so sorry, Draco, I shouldn’t have said anything, I shouldn’t have told you that I love you, but I—I do. I think I have for a while now. I just came back from a date where all I could think about was you. And… I know it doesn’t help you, but maybe at least it’s nice to know that
Ron leaned forward and patted him on his hand. “There there, I’m sure it’s just a phase or something. Soon you’ll be reminded of what a git he is, and then you’ll snap out of it.”
Ginny eyed him in astonishment, swiping a stray strand of hair off her face. “Don’t even think about it, Draco,” she said. “I’ll be taking the couch of course, since I’m crashing your holiday.
Scurrying around hotel grounds early in the morning with an ache throughout his entire body wasn’t Draco’s ideal post-cotial routine. He wasn’t sure it was Harry’s either, but here they were.
Draco wishes he could say that he has a snappy retort for her, but he becomes as much of a mumbling mess as Harry, which only makes Healer Goodwin look insufferably smug as she wishes them a good night’s sleep.
I told him that if my first efforts at learning to play were so awful, maybe he could do it better. And of course he already knew how to play, because why the hell not? He played an old traditional wizarding song, some sort of ballad about a maiden who was so beautiful she was pestered by all the men in the village and had to take refuge in the woods. Eventually her parents sent another girl to her to chaperone, and to help with householding and such. And in the end they realised they had fallen in love with each other, and they lived happily ever after in the woods.
Harry turns his head and spots Ginny talking animatedly with Pansy Parkinson, a common sight these days. Luna stands beside them, looking in awe at some new spells that Daphne Greengrass, who works in product development at Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, is showing her.
“I know you’ve been fucking, what other ways are there?” Ron says, making Harry wish the ground would swallow him whole right now. Or at the very least that Ron would shut up. “No, wait,” Ron continues, “don’t answer. I prefer living in oblivion.”
“Aaaaahhh,” Malfoy sighed while Harry tried his best not to look at his dick. “Whoever said there’s nothing better than sex has clearly never needed to pee that badly.”
Harry approaches him silently, feeling Draco’s gaze on him the entire time, knowing by the slight tilt of Draco’s head how delighted he is with the effect he has on Harry. With a sigh, Harry drops to his knees in front of him, letting himself be bracketed by Draco’s thighs and looking up at him in eager expectation.
“Draco…” he starts, and everything around you both has faded away. There’s only you and him now in the world, only his eyes on you and his lips forming your name and you want to stop time and be in this moment forever, want to pretend that this is something you could do.
“Oh come on, Potter, you know you drive me up the wall sometimes,” Draco said under his breath, but something told him that the girls in the front heard him, because the looked at each other with wiggling eyebrows before they collapsed onto their desks in fits of giggles. Draco’s face heated when he realised the double entendre.
“Okay, well I’m off then. See you around,” Harry says, trying to smile but it feels a bit like a grimace. Something feels off, the way Draco suddenly seems like he has trouble breathing, his chest heaving rapidly in short movements. “You alright?”
He refuses to dignify her with an answer, but of course, that only makes her more persistent, and she changes tactics and rounds on him. “You know what your problem is, Draco? You’re a coward. You’re too scared to put yourself out there and admit to Potter that you’re in love with him. You’re so fucking afraid of rejection that you’d rather die than risk it!”
Carefully, Harry opened the box to see if the content really matched the exterior, and when he’d made sure it really did, he had to pause again to blink repeatedly against the sting in his eyes. Then he picked up the black plastic box, twisting it in his hands. The room was silent, probably because few of them knew what this was.
Draco smiled. “Wonderful—feel free to elaborate when I can properly hear you, yeah?”  Harry shot him a simpering smile in return and then continued down the stairway, wand out and ready. No doubt the suspect had already heard them, along with the alarm.
Anyway, we’re better off as friends. Even if she does tease me about how I can never hold onto any girl for longer than half a year, tops. It’s not a very flattering look on her to be so smug about that she’s still the girl I’ve been together with the longest. Maybe once this disease has a cure I can start dating again and find someone nice.
“I… I see,” you say, trying to swallow. “Is there something wrong with that? Are you displeased with our work in the garden or with the medicinal plants?”
