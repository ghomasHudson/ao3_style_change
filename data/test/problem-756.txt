Harry scoffed. Trust Draco! But Harry had his answer; Draco wanted to get a drink with him – or he wouldn’t have claimed that Harry’s offer couldn’t be withdrawn.
“Take her to the hospital wing…” Said Harry - firmly, as he bent down beside Headmistress McGonagall. A lump of familiar guilt was twisting in his gut. “I’ll sort everything out here with Professor Flitwick and meet you there.”
Draco: "Harry! You defeated Voldemort. You brought peace to hundreds of people, gave them justice for their lost family and friends. You prevented thousands - millions of deaths from happening, and you gave everyone that survived a future. I know I can't stop you feeling bad for the lives that were lost - just like I won't ever stop feeling guilty for my part in the war, but you have to see the light too ... or it will destroy you - living in only darkness."
made a great difference, but he still hated thinking back on them sessions.
“Bloody hell Draco!” Harry panicked for a moment before mentally slapping himself. He’d just have to bite his tongue and remove Draco’s top!
“Not a spell Master Potter, Elf magic!” Kreacher answered.
Harry pushed past Draco to get to the door, but Draco put his hand on it to hold it closed.
-Ginny is shouting, pointing at Draco accusingly.
Looking down at the leather lanyard with the shrunken vial attached, he tried to blink away a few stray tears… Fucking hell! Why was he getting emotional over this…?
When the Vault was opened, Draco was in total shock. The Vault was bigger than the Malfoy's was. Harry went inside and filled his magical money pouch with Galleons, Sickles, and Knuts, while Draco glanced around. There was the money of course, pilled high one side. As he looked at the shiny mound enviously, a few coins fell out of nowhere adding to the pile. There was also hundreds of items: Photo's and Portraits, jewelry, clothes, boxes of unknown items, and  books    to name a few things.
-Draco once agian - to the shock of the students, helps Harry correct his potion.
He was currently marking the fifth year Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff homework that had been handed in today. He’d set them homework before the holidays – to list three counter jinxes and explain them and their function – and he was currently reading Miss Briana Payne’s.
“Then don’t.” Draco said, sitting in a chair opposite Minerva’s desk.
Perhaps the high expectations on Draco to be what his father deemed ‘a Malfoy’ prevented Draco from a normal childhood? Malfoy senior had raised Draco to walk in his father’s shoes, and Draco – as himself or on the parchment as Tau – had mentioned a few times, that he had never done things that Harry would have expected a child to have done; Draco had never been allowed to get messy or dirty, had never been allowed to read books that his father deemed as ‘silly’ or ‘childish’, had never been allowed to cry or show his emotions, and he’d never been allowed to do anything that didn’t please his father and his father’s expectations of a ‘
Draco just followed Harry with tears streaming down his face, broken sobs rocking his chest, and the pain of over ten years’ suppressed emotions and every ounce of guilt he carried drowning him. Draco had giving up right now, and was at Harry’s mercy. They walked to just beyond Hogwarts gates, and then Harry pulled Draco to his chest and disapparated them both away.
“Course not!” Harry shook his head, pouring two glasses of the tawny coloured Whiskey. He handed a glass to Draco before sitting down in the arm chair opposite him. They both sipped at the whiskey, and Harry felt a slight burn as the sweet flavour slipped down his throat. Draco looked around after his first sip, and over at the food. “Help yourself. I didn’t know if you had eaten or not. I didn’t bother with dinner tonight personally.”
…Oh yes, he was definitely playing with fire.
-Harry and Draco at an orphanage, see a tiny blond haired boy playing alone.
“Why not. I need to make a stop at Ceridwen's Cauldrons anyway.” Draco agreed. “Miss Briana Payne has exploded more cauldron’s already then Longbottom did during his entire school, and Mrs Allaway promised to order in some potion ingredients for me.” Draco explained, and Harry wondered if he was using his need to visit Hogsmeade to avoid the truth – that yes, he would very much enjoy having a drink in Harry’s company.
Molly: "Harry, you're like a son to me dear. No matter what you do, we would always forgive you for it. In this case though, I don't think you've done anything wrong, except leave rather rudely perhaps."
-They slip away from their friends, towards the cover of trees, and start to make out.
Harry paused to collect his thoughts. He remembered Draco trying to break up him and Ginny, being a dick, and ... practically begging Harry to be with him instead.
“I’m going – Merlin.” Harry muttered in good nature.
Hermione: "Harry, focus!"
Draco: "Potter! Stop that and eat your toast."
Harry loved teasing Draco; the wavering between pure-blooded bullshit and the real Draco was adorable! Harry was positively gushing inside, but outward, he would show no more than a smirk. “What’s your secret chérie like then?” Harry asked as if he was regarding the weather.
Harry: "Will you let me smack your arse?"
Harry: "Harry!"
Hermione: "You don't typically have a ball for Easter, and I obviously didn't know McGonagall was hosting one, but it makes sense. Houses have been mingling more and swapping tables at breakfast. Easter, also called Pascha or Resurrection Sunday, is a religious holiday commemorating the time Jesus Christ - god's begotten son, rose from the dead. He offered his life to redeem all mankind of their sins, all personal sins of these who repent. It symbolizes new birth, hope, and renewal ..."
Draco followed Harry, the question regarding solar lightning forgotten, and he watched as Harry browsed the books. He wanted to ask Harry about the elevator, ask him why he didn't take the stairs and instead choose to put himself in an uncomfortable position, but he didn't feel right about asking him here – it wasn't the time or place.
“Thank-you.” Harry nodded and made his way to the en-suite.
The two men stared at each other in a silent ‘you will, I won’t’ argument, eyebrows raised in stubborn belief of their own opinions, neither backing down.
“Thank you, sir.” Samuel nodded. They walked until they were about to go separate ways – Samuel to catch desert in the Great Hall, and Harry to the dungeons. “Sir?”
“I can imagine!” Draco wrinkled his nose, glad that the Slytherins had more poise. He contained his humour though – it was slightly funny but Harry looked stressed enough.
Harry is the last one in the common room, so Draco approaches him. Harry shakes his head to reject him agian, but he bites his lip like he is thinking about it.
Draco thought about it before smiling smugly.
Harry sat at the kitchen table and continued to mark the student's essays for his defense against the dark arts class. Sipping his coffee, he finished another essay and was just about to start on the next one when an owl swooped in through the opened window. It landed on the table, preening its pretty brown speckled feathers.
Draco spat, then he nearly knocked Harry over as he spun around and left the room - slamming the door shut behind him. Neither of them had noticed the radio's sudden appearance, or the date and time clearly displayed as: Saturday September 5th 1998, 6pm.
Harry knew that Draco was confused, it was expected, but he could also see the appreciation in coin-grey eyes. He was relieved to have something to direct the focus away from himself, even if he was curious about his own gift… that could wait a moment.
Damn It! Draco cursed. He just wished that Harry would leave; he needed time alone to think, and he couldn’t think straight in Harry’s presence.
-Harry's green eyes meet silver. He hesitates before walking away in the other direction.
Harry: "Tries not to smile* "Who?"
-Harry kisses Draco in sixth year common room - everyone there, before dragging Draco into his room.
Harry knew he should have ended the conversation there, dismissed the boy and made his way down to check on Draco – Merlin only knew how much he wanted to, but it could not be said that he didn’t care about the students.
“What is she like in your lessons?” Draco asked, drinking eggnog from his crystal goblet. He’d noticed a change in Miss Payne – both in her behaviour and grades, but then he only taught her potions.
“Oh, I do. Doesn’t mean he wasn’t an arse hole.”
The only difference between Tau and Draco, seemed to be in their confidence and willingness to be open in terms of personality. Tau wrote freely for the most part; among his jovial words, his joking taunts, and the way he alluded to things or acted with a laughable arrogance, he allowed his true personality to shine through.
Harry’s thoughts were interrupted however, when Draco’s steps halted in the doorway of the Three Broomstick pub, just as they were entering – Draco’s hand was still on the open door and Harry almost walked into the back of him.
“No!” Harry interrupted again. “I never got anything from them. I never got to celebrate Christmas with them.”
Harry: "See you in Herbology!"
-By the great lake: Draco cups Harry's cheek tenderly.
"Just have to wait a while for my order to come down." Harry's voice made Draco jump.
Ron: "It's Friday September 25th, 1998."
putting your hands out when you fall. That's what it is like for me - trying to change the part of myself I hate, its embedded as instinct. I don't need - nor want you too save me Potter. If you give me a second chance ... I only ask for patience from you while I work it out. I can't promise I won't be an outstanding cock-up agian, but maybe we come to an agreement at least?"
Draco: "Why? No one else would, in fact, they would ostracize and admonish you for even speaking to 'Death Eater scum'."
“You certainly enjoyed it though.” Harry said, standing in the way of the door – preventing Draco from closing it.
Draco was getting exasperated trying to explain it to a brainless Gryffindor.
-25th September 9am, Draco walk into Herbology and avoids Harry's eyes.
“Yes. I think Graves is letting his emotions run this case. I was just there; he is determined to find a reason to have the boy arrested but his attitude suggests he blames Minerva.”
“So, if I choose for you to let it go, you will?” Samuel asked with caution.
Well I'm about to turn up the heat
"Oh, okay then." Harry nodded, but Draco heard the disappointment in his voice. It
That was the other thing, Draco was using his surname more often again… but fuck! Why was he concerned about names when he was in his underwear in the bathroom brushing his teeth, and Draco had let himself into Harry’s private rooms?
They had shared deeper desires with each other since September 7
Harry: "Isn't this supposed to be yellow?"
It wasn’t just the coffee that was making him restless though, but the bomb of thoughts, feelings, and memories that had gone off inside him. The more he got to know Draco, the harder it became to deny the truth of who Tau actually was. It was so blindingly obviously, and yet, he still wasn’t ready to accept it. Soon - soon he would find out without a shadow of a doubt, but right now, Draco had just agreed to the tour.
Draco sat on the opposite couch, obviously in agreement to the oath. Harry almost scoffed – Draco’s curious nature was something alright; the guy could be so easily baited with a bit of gossip or the most hush-hush of secrets. Somehow the suspense of what Harry was about to say had sobered Draco from his own frustration and pain – well, enabled him to bury it again, and Harry strongly suspected it also had to do with the fact that the attention was no longer on the blond, but on him instead.
Harry waited for well over an hour for a reply, but non came. His eyes were growing heavy, and he knew that he would fall asleep shortly.
What would he do if it
He reached into the draw and pulled out the copy of Tau’s Le’Amortentia profile: Thirty years old, five-foot-nine in height, grey eyes, blond hair, pure-blood.
Draco had returned to England because McGonagall had written to him and asked that he teach potions – that she was in urgent need of a potion’s professor. What had shocked Harry the most, was that McGonagall had kept in touch with Draco after the war – initially the first letter was regarding his return to Hogwarts for a re-do of seventh year, but he had declined. McGonagall had been rather persistent, but Draco even more so. Their correspondence just never stopped after that. Draco had mentioned a few times, in his letters to the headmistress, that he was studying under a French Potions master’s tutelage, and had told her a few years ago that he had finally acquired his own master in potion - and had become a potions master now himself. Draco had agreed to take the job as potions professor because the headmistress had been kind to him, and he’d wanted to used his new skills for something.
Harry once again nodded. This actually didn't sound too bad, and he found himself gaining an interest as he started to relax. "How do you pick a ... chérie?"
Harry laughed. Warmth filled his stomach and he shook his head at how Draco was so … well, so Draco!
“Mr Malfoy, you will eat that food or I will bind you–”
“I’m sure?” Draco nodded, expecting Harry to let go of him now.
“What brings you to this conclusion? It’s a very serious accusation, one that will have to be handled with upmost care and caution. I cannot simply confront Mr Avery without further proof.” Said Minerva, but her tone suggested that she believed them and was hoping they had more to go on.
-Standing out side 12 Grimmauld Place, hands held tightly together.
Harry falls in to the common room chair exasperated.
-Blaise now leaning against the tree.
- 20th September 8am breakfast, Harry biting his lips, staring at Draco across the Great Hall, and Ginny's words going unheard again.
“Could have fooled me.” Harry chuckled.
Potter. You’ve never done anything wrong in your life. You weren’t there. You weren’t- You didn’t see what HE did, what he made ME do! You have no idea what it’s like-”
Draco pointed to a small box, wrapped in red and green stained paper – it currently sat on the coffee table between the two armchairs across the room. Draco had planned on just leaving it there for Harry to find, planning on feigning indifference and passing it off as unimportant – just a gift, nothing more. Harry obviously hadn’t noticed, but Draco had an unexpected desire to point it out just then.
-Ron waving his hand in front of Harry's face and sighing.
You know my darkest secrets
-Draco runs after Harry, stands in front of him, and won't let him pass.
They share a sweet kiss - quick but telling. McGonagall gets everyone's attention, nodding to them to take the floor.
“I scared it?” Draco whined in incredibility, his eyes wide in disbelief. “Father said they’re vicious, bloodthirsty beast!”
“What can Kreacher do for Master Potter?” The gravel voice of his house elf asked as he appeared with a ‘crack’.
to come out – there was no
Harry wondered if Draco was himself right now, or at least close to his real age. He seemed calmer, more mature, but he was still dubious of Draco’s state of mind.
Hermione: "There you are, come on or we'll be late for Herbology!"
“That Chimera didn’t look friendly!” Draco whined in obvious incredulity. “Where did it go?” Draco suddenly sat up again in fear, looking around in a desperate need to reassure himself of his safety, but Harry gently pushed Draco back down.
cracker with Miss Munson that caused the interruption. They didn’t usually pull the crackers until pudding, so it was premature, but the girl shouldn’t look so whipped.
It took a while to convince Draco to side along with him - Draco didn't want to to be 'escorted like a child', but they eventually arrived in the more bustling Diagon Alley. The first thing Harry wanted to do was visit Gringotts Wizarding Bank, so he took Draco's hand and of  they went. Harry had some money on him, but not enough for the stuff he would likely buy in Homely Abode for his home - 12 Grimmauld place, or other things that might take his fancy.
ask Minerva to assist him, but Draco would have the better chance of getting through to Silas as an ex-death eater, and as Slytherin’s head of house. It all came down to the fact that Draco
“Draco!” Harry interrupted, knowing he’d misunderstood completely. “I, I’m just not sure what it is exactly.” He admitted, feeling almost contrite as he bit his lip.
Harry: "Do you remember-"
-Flashes of their most recent battle play out around them like a hologram, but then good memories of the last four months do too.
“His mother will keep her trap shut when her options are to do just that or to see her son thrown into Azkaban.” Harry calmly explained,
have Pancakes and ice-cream when feeling under the weather!” Draco insisted. Sometimes his mother would even ask the house elves to spread a little chocolate onto his pancakes too. His father would complain that Mother spoiled him, but he let her do it regardless… his parents loved him.
-Eyes met as they kiss lovingly, parting for the start of term feast.
“The bathroom is just outside to the right.” Harry pointed. “The towels are clean. I’ll initiate the oath of silence and explain everything once you’ve fixed yourself up a bit.” When Draco went to argue, Harry held up his hand and added. “I refuse to talk to someone with snot all over their face!” His lips curled into a slight smirk.
“Harry?”
“No! I mean, no, I just needed…” Harry could have slapped himself; he was a terrible liar and this felt all kinds of wrong. Luckily Draco seemed to accept it though.
Draco and Harry were sat in the Three Broomsticks,  both with a tankard of warm foaming Butterbeer, and mid conversation.
Harry shouted, and ran down the hallway.
Neither of them knew that sleep wouldn't happen agian for while - if at all, so they went to sit on the new couch, with one of the new throws over them. The throw was magically enchanted to warm up when necessary, so they were snug into each other, Draco's head on Harry's shoulder, as Harry played with his hair.
Harry: "Just a headache!"
He was giving himself a headache; that kind of thinking was far to complex for his mind and he wasn’t ashamed to admit it either, but there was the other thought Tau had given him.
Draco – blankets – top – Kreacher – Draco – blankets – Draco – Top!
-Memory: Dancing at the ball together.
-At Draco's bedroom door, but can't knock, so he screams and storms away pulling his hair.
Just as Harry went to pick up what looked like an old muggle radio - with a digital date and time, another hand snatched it from his grasp. Harry looked up to find a certain Slytherin - with Platinum blond hair and silver eyes, tossing the device between his hands. Blaise, and Pansy behind him - like always. It was Draco! The annoying twat that had tormented him and his friends for seven years; the tosser that had gotten swept into the hurdling waves of war, joined the dark side against his will, and had become a death eater. Despite the war being over, Draco was still a mammoth size prat.
-Draco looking at books with Hermione but getting bored.
Harry was tempted to just plop his butt on the edge of the desk, but this wasn’t his classroom so he sat in the chair as instructed. He felt a little strange sitting in Draco’s chair, and quite a few of the sixth year Gryffindor and Slytherin students frowned between him and Draco. Draco regained their attention quickly and continued as if Harry hadn’t just interrupted them – which made Harry all the more curious; he expected Draco to complain about his timing and tell him to piss off to be honest – maybe not quite in those words but to that extent, not welcome him in and offer up his chair.
The scratching of the quill filled the room as he replied to Tau.
“He doesn’t – He just – I think he must have done that years ago. I really don’t think it’s something he still does. If I had to guess, I’d say he did that not long after the war. He probably just wanted to remove the mark… nothing else.”
Draco sighed in relief – for the fact that Harry would check on Miss Payne, and because Harry was no longer in his presence – and opened the door to return back into his classroom.
Draco: "Alright Potter ... I can accept that."
“Together.” Draco agreed.
Draco: "Harry wait up!"
Tuesday the 1st December 1998
Harry was rather surprised at the way Draco had been received by Mrs Allaway. The greying older lady smiled at him, pottering about quickly to make sure he had everything he needed, and she even patted his shoulder before they’d left. It was nice to know that Draco had friendly acquaintances.
-Blaise throws an apple at Draco, who crunches into it like a boss
Harry knew that Graves wouldn’t have the same liberty that he did when it came to the minster of magic himself, but it would remind Auror Graves to think carefully before he tried to fuck with him and his own. He smiled warmly, as if this was an everyday conversation between them.
Draco ignored him this time in favour of greeting Mrs Allaway and attending to business. Harry remain quiet until they were exiting the shop, only speaking to say goodbye to Mrs Allaway. Once the door closed behind them, Harry turned to Draco.
“Yes sir!” Matthews nodded.
Draco: "I mean ... That's lovely Potter, you'll all be very cozy together."
Oh I just know there's something bigger out there
“Well, you were spectacular!” Minerva smiled momentarily, before her face returned to it normal stern expression. “I dare say we haven’t seen the last of him though. Mr Avery and his mother will not be best pleased when he makes
-Images of Draco at home when Voldemort lived there.
“Yeah. Kind of.” Harry admitted, but he said no more. What could he say?
Harry: "I'm also struggling to recall what I've learnt Headmistresses, It's not just Malfoy. With all due respect , we came to you for advice not bias judgment. You're the headmistress, we assumed you would want to know if two of your students were being affected by a curse, and we trusted you to address this matter professionally."
-Seamus stands up pointing at Draco accusingly with hatred.
Draco sat among the teachers that had stayed for the Christmas holidays, at the far end of the frosty-blue decorated table – adorned with miniature ice sculptures and floating candles burning in silver holders – and he found himself unable to stop glancing across the table at Harry as he spoke with Minerva.
“Yeah?” Harry turned. Draco had rushed in behind him.
He was ashamed to admit – even if it was just to himself – that he needed Draco to be there when they viewed the memories. He’d been thinking about precisely what memories to show Mr Avery, and just the thought of them unsettled him. Yes, he’d grieved for the lives lost in the war, learnt not to place the blame so heavily on his own shoulders, and spent years in therapy, but his flashbacks and emotions simply failed to understand logic and reasoning; it wasn’t logical to lose his mind to visions when he thought back to certain events, and it made no sense because he’d been through all the motions towards recovery… but it didn’t matter! His head was fucked up, and he knew he’d need the support when the time came. Worst case scenario: he’d have a flash back, and Mr Avery would take advantage of his lack of awareness and attempt to kill him. Best case: he’d be slightly affected and he’d have Draco there for support.
“Draco?” Harry frowned, watching Draco’s face contort with discomfort, pain, and in confusion.
“He is
Ron: "Death eater scum! Piss off back to you're murderous family you traitorous wanker!"
Cause it's about to get rough for you
“Okay.” Draco nodded, his eyes drooping as fatigue took over his ailing body.
“I’m still reeling from what Silas did. I can’t believe–” Draco shook his head, unable to finished his own sentence. There was a cold wind of uncertainty regarding Mr Avery that he didn’t like leaving unchecked. The boy was corrupted, ignorant, and dangerous with his opinions and beliefs. Draco hoped that Harry could get through to the boy, but he was worried.
He couldn’t help but feel his smile grow; Harry still had a habit of skipping meals – much to Minerva’s displeasure, and for a moment, Draco wondered when that habit had actually started.
Draco used a charm to send no less than ten large snowballs speeding towards Harry’s face, and while Harry deflected them with a shield, Draco used the distraction to free his feet.
“Yep!” Harry replied, promising Draco of his discretion and secrecy. Their shared weaknesses were only between them, and that had somehow brought them closer as friends. A blushing smile was still on Harry’s face as he lowered the fresh coffee onto the table.
“I found her a book on abstinence and told her we didn’t stock the book she wanted.” He struggled to get out his words. “She …. She left in such a hurry, throwing the book down on a shelf on the way out.”
Situated on his bed comfortably, a mug of steaming hot coffee on his bedside table, Harry wrote to Tau using his magical Parchment and Quill.
Harry nodded again. Molly finally made him return to the Burrow, and they had a nice chat over tea. Molly just asked that Harry was careful, nothing else. She was okay with whatever Harry chose just as long as he was happy and safe. She never even accused him of being at fault for his brake-up with Ginny, telling him agian how much of a son he was to her; if her children weren't talking to each other, she still loved them all the same, and that included Harry.
“Are you ashamed of your secret chérie?” Harry asked, leaning in closer to meet Draco’s face in the middle. “Maybe this person is unintelligent and moronic… wait! Is your secret chérie a squib?” Harry threw the bait… Draco caught it!
Harry and Ron quickly checked their notes, Hermione was working with Neville agian at the back - so they couldn't ask her. Just then Draco turned to face them and snicked along with Blaise.
He waved his hand setting the fire in the hearth alight, the orange glow revealing his private chamber at Hogwarts. His heart rate settled with the visual proof that he was safe in bed, but his stomach bucked and sent him racing to his en-suite.
Spoiled yes … … but in the material sense.
“Just making sure you know that I’m not judging you.” Harry said, then he realised they were attracting onlookers outside the coffee shop. “Walk with me! We’re attracting attention.” Harry then started to walk, hopeful that Draco would follow him.
Harry’s voice, now coming from
He ran, leaving Draco standing there berating himself for being so mean, so callous, and so cruel to the boy that already had so much on his shoulders.
He left his empty cup on the dining table, went to the small box room to gather a list, and then left his chambers. He had to go and speak to Draco about a few potions he would need in two weeks-time; It wasn’t quite lunchtime yet, so he would try the potions classroom first.
“Sorry to be bothering you Master Harry Potter sir, but Potions Master Draco Malfoy be requesting you. He is sending Cloval to tell you, that he is needed you urgently in the potions classroom.” Cloval explained.
Draco walks up to Harry and Ginny, and starts throwing insults - causing Ginny to get off Harry's lap and retaliate.
Ron: "You're staring agian!"
Harry: "Draco!"
They would wink at each other, lick their lips,  eye fuck, and whisper seductively to each other in passing.
Draco never wandered from his side, still eating his way through far too much sugar and chocolate. Then, about half-hour later, Harry noticed the warning signs of fight about to break out across the Hall. He set down his cup and went to deal with it before it escalated.
.” Harry smiled as he walked them out of his class room. They waved and hurried off to Charms, their “Bye Mr Potter”, echoing through the corridor.
The Great Hall was already decorated for the Christmas holidays, students excited about going home for the festive season while they enjoyed breakfast. It was Saturday December the eighteenth, a week until Christmas, and the train would be leaving Hogsmeade in a few hours to take most of the students home.
“Don’t be -- sorry that is. I was just grading. What did you want to discuss?” Frowned Harry, watching as Draco lowered his coffee and taped the side of the mug with his ring index finger in thought. Harry sipped at his own coffee and waited.
“Oh, do be quiet Potter!” Draco said. “I’m not going to listen to you put doubt into my mind any longer. Padfoot is a kind, generous, and wonderful wizard!”
“Thank you, Harry.” Draco almost whispered, but it still startled him from his thoughts.
Worried that he had ingested poison, Harry quickly took off after him.
“I meant it you know.” Harry started. “You deserve to find someone and they would be lucky to have the real you in their life, but you need to be yourself Draco. No walls, no hiding behind defensive anger or becoming a jerk because you’re afraid. Find the courage to take the risk. I know that’s hard for you to do, but you’ll be stuck alone if you don’t.” Harry then smiled at him, a brilliant smile that gave Draco courage.
Oh, yes – Draco’s fidgeting, that slight blush along his pale cheek bones, and the way his pure-blooded vocabulary failed him made this all worth it. It was rewarding watching Draco Malfoy lose that pure-blooded mask of his.
Harry just watched him go, standing there utterly perplexed and confounded.
…They might be crazy things, but Harry loved the way Tau’s mind worked. His philosophical and theoretical way of thinking was intriguing and intelligent. He respected that about the man, and found it an attractive trait…
He gestured for the boy to take a seat near the front, to the side opposite Miss Payne, and just as he was about to rebuke Silas for his tardiness, a loud sound of stone hitting the floor echoed in the silent room.
Harry nodded with a smirk, “Thank you! I really do appreciate it.” His smirk morphed into a small smile.
Draco: "Wait, your own place?"
Harry laughed as he held his side, falling sideward to laugh into his bed as tears of mirth fell from his eyes. He rolled onto his back, still laughing at the new question he had been asked by Tau-Draco.
Harry flew across the great lake on his Volant 360 racing broom. The wind rapidly killed his drowsiness, and the thrill of the ride gave him a boost of energy. The volant 360 was made for stunts: better grip, flat top for wind surfing, charmed seating for excellent comfort, and over thirty built in safety charms. Harry would have tried out a few more daring stunts, but he wasn’t dressed in suitable clothing - he was in jeans and a t-shirt - and he didn’t need to burn off his renewed energy when he had more planning to return to.
Harry returned his half glass of milk to the bedside table and carefully constructed his reply.
“Please! Just do it.” Harry begged… he just hoped he was wrong.
Harry: "What's wrong?"
Harry looked pointedly at Draco, willing the man to understand that he deserved forgiveness and freedom, but Draco just stared at his mug. Harry could see him discreetly biting at the inside of his cheek, his breathing increased ever so slightly, and his glossy grey eyes closed for that moment too long. Harry couldn’t help but rub his thumb over the back of Draco’s hand, but he stayed silent – waiting for Draco to find his voice.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I think he just remembered that he had the dark mark.” Harry explained, not sure that was all it was.
“You’re talking about the Philosophers stone, aren’t you? I remember reading about that.”
“Of being turned down?” Harry asked. Draco just nodded. “If he’s smart then he won’t. If he does then he is a fool that doesn’t deserve you!”
-Rude and explicit content mentioned, but no
“I will hold you to that.” Draco smirked. Somehow, Harry got the impression that Draco didn’t quite believe him.
“You can change your mind you know; you don’t have to do this.” Draco was still concerned that Harry would have flash backs. He’d come to care a great deal about Harry.
Harry was expecting something like this, but It
Harry lifted his left hand in slight panic, and managed to use wandless magic to explode the head halfway towards him. Using his wand, he tried to imprison Draco in the snow that he was causing to build up and around his legs fast.
Can you handle what I'm 'bout to do?
Harry still wanted to check the bedroom however, to see if the parchment had been left out. He doubted he would be so lucky, but the fact that Draco only had an en-suite gave him the perfect excuse to quickly glance around Draco’s bedroom, and it seemed a shame to waste the opportunity to check. He wasn’t about to go snooping around, but a quick glance wouldn’t hurt.
“That’s it?” Draco’s disbelief was a façade. Harry knew that he was asking a lot from the blond with the simple request of being on first name bases - to do so implied they were friends. Harry had learnt a lot about pure-blood customs, and the customs of those in higher standing in the wizarding world. The use of first names were reserved for loved ones and close friends, or for those you were trying to manipulate.
“Ten points to Slytherin … just don’t tell Mr Malfoy that, I’ll never hear the end of it.”
It was a very controlled marriage contract, and as the Lord of Black and the Lord of Malfoy at the time had overseen Narcissa’s marriage to Lucius, Harry had to claim that a breach had occurred as the new Lord of Black. There were certainly many breaches, including ‘love and honour thy wife’, ‘keep from harm’, and Harry’s personal favourite, ‘the alliance between families Malfoy and Black will hereby grow stronger with the matrimony…’
“What’s wrong?” Asked Harry, frowning at the abnormal pale complexion Draco was suddenly sporting. He looked like he’d seen a ghost.
Throwing himself backward on to the bed, he just heard that loud 'POP!' as the radio appeared. Saturday 19th December 1998.
“Have a good night Potter.” Draco said instead, nodding his head once.
Harry: "I'm sorry Dray, I didn't mean ... I just-"
“Why not send Mr Longbottom?” Draco asked, looking down the table at the herbology teacher and head of Hufflepuff House. Neville Longbottom looked up upon hearing his name, but Minerva answered Draco’s question before Neville could speak.
Harry could almost hear Draco chanting –
-Lessons begin, gossip travels of Draco with Harry, and then ... Potions lesson. Draco walks in smiling at him.
Draco nodded and looked to be contemplating his next question before he asked it. “Would you be comfortable sharing the trigger of your episode that day, with me? I don’t remember mentioning the war.”
“None of your business!” Draco kept on walking, he refused to make eye contact with Harry. If it wasn’t for the fact that he enjoyed Harry’s company – usually, he would have stopped their meetings because the black-haired prat wouldn’t stop questioning him about Padfoot.
Harry was still squatting In front of Draco a few minutes later, still on the floor, when the man finally calmed down enough to
Draco: "Nightmare?"
He was simply staring at him during breakfast that Monday morning, and he couldn't have given two flying fucks what other thought.
“I’d like that. Will you be okay getting back? It a long way down to the dungeons.” Harry frowned slightly as Draco wobbled.
Draco was looking at him, waiting for his answer, and Harry caught the way his eyes flicked down nervously… Was Draco nervous? Harry then saw the blond swallow as he made eye contact with him – uncertain maybe? Harry smiled at him, making his decision.
-They step off the train holding hands - leaning into each other. They walk slowly to the carriages - both seeing the thestrals awaiting order. Harry stops to pat the muzzle of the nearest one, their eyes met before he turns around, back to the warm of Draco's silver eyes. They share a sad, knowing smile before climbing up into the carriage.
Harry smiled bitter-sweetly as Draco left the room - with the whiskey still in his hand too. Whether or not Draco realised it, he’d managed to calm the blond down and get him to stay for a drink. It felt good – being able to help in some way, but Harry now had to share some of his own demons. Perhaps he should take advantage of his more Slytherin qualities…
Hermione: "Hear what?"
“What do you call him then? You must have some name for each other if you’ve been talking for three months.” Harry asked as they walked back to Hogwarts, trudging through the November snow.
Harry: "Right now, I just want to know what was wrong earlier."
He had planned to make a quick, but elegant, rush to his bedroom, but he’d almost tripped as he caught Draco standing there in his living-room, taking in the sight and gawping at him. He smiled shyly, “I’ll just… Give me five minutes,” he stuttered, and ducked his head as he disappeared into his bedroom.
The bear sized snowball, that Harry had only managed to move about a foot in Draco’s direction, rapidly melted! A huge wave of freezing water poured down over Harry’s panting, exhausted body. Harry was both literally, and metaphorically frozen to the spot in a shivering mess.
Yes, it was definitely 6pm that Draco intended on arriving. He had ten minutes until he showed up - to decided if he should prepare coffee or not as well, but Harry found himself frowning at Draco’s handwriting instead. It looked very familiar the way his O’s looked like small hair curls, or the way his M’s looped in the middle, but he couldn’t place why it looked so familiar. Maybe it was familiar to a student’s handwriting, that would probably be it.
Draco nodded, but he was coughing an awful lot. Harry rushed to get him a glass of water, which Draco took gladly. The blond then scurried like a frightened mouse back into his sophisticated composure - slamming his mask back into place and trying to hide his embarrassment.
Love to all my readers,
His tears ran with the warmth of the water, another allegory for his life perhaps – that his pain and his past, would always corrupt any happiness he found in life.
And for a second, before his thoughts were interrupted by Mr Sayer, he couldn’t stop the thought about how time had gone so fast during his snow battle with Potter this evening…
As the students on Harry’s team were ready to clout Draco, Lilium, and Josephine in red snowballs, Draco was starting his own count down.
-Draco's tear falling as he tells her how others treat him.
Draco ducked when Harry sent a charmed parchment bird at his head. Draco laughed, grabbing his own wand to retaliate, and as Harry ducked out of the way of the dancing jinx he smiled. The smile that the blond wore was one that Harry hoped he would see more of. That smile was Christmas come early, everything Harry would ever need, and as light as air.
I'm here for your entertainment
Maybe Tau had no family, which would explain why he berates Elliot for leaving his. If Tau was alone, maybe death eaters forced him to do things he wouldn’t otherwise do. Maybe he had no choice yet still blames himself for being a ‘coward’, for not refusing. Maybe they killed his family, or held them hostage, or both, and then forced him into following them. Maybe-
There had been no reply to his last message. Draco was obviously ignoring ‘Padfoot’ too... but why? What had changed that Draco would no longer talk to him or ‘Padfoot’? Surly Draco hadn’t figured out that they were the same people… right? No, that wasn’t possible… was it?
Draco managed to get to his wand, and he cast a few cleaning charms to clear up the sick. The smell was going to make him gag at any rate, but Harry would hopefully appreciate it at the very least – at least he might, when he’d calmed down, but Draco had no idea how to help him do that.
Malaise had run a back ground check on Harry before he had left Le'Amortentia, and she had informed him that certain crimes such as murder, child abuse, rape, and pedophiles for example, had to be listed on the profiles. Harry knew then, that his secret chérie was no murderer, or it would have said as much.
Where there's beauty beyond your dreams
Harry had promised, which meant that – if Tau and Draco were one in the same, that he’d promised that to Draco. He still didn’t know for sure if Tau and Draco were one in the same, but there were so many similarities.
“Don’t look at me like that.” Harry defended himself – his hand held up. “I did warn you.”
Harry nodded.
“Why are you avoiding me?” Harry asked, almost too causally, but there was hurt there.
cinnamon. He would eat it for Harry… Harry made him feel special. Harry cared about what he wanted.
“Well, what did you do?” Harry asked through his own laughter, gripping at his side.
Harry: "Why do I always have to dance first?"
Samuel nodded, hopping of the bed, and seemed in better spirits.
Draco: "You are damn it. You're leaving!"
Those metal doors opened of their own, making Draco jump. Harry walked inside the strange metal box… did he expect him to follow?
“This is a medi chain potter, or as the French call it, collier de médecine d'urgence. It is common in France, for those suffering seizure, allergies, or other ailments that need a close supply of potion, to wear one of these containing said potion.”
It was certainly something that he’d spend the night pondering.
“Still rubbish at Potions Potter … Harry.”
Harry eventually opened the door - looking an utter mess, and beckoned Draco inside.
Harry smiled lovingly at that notion. What would it really feel like to return ‘home’ to a family that wanted you, that loved you, that was all yours?
It was nearly 5pm now, he really should go down to dinner in the Great Hall… but he wasn’t hungry. He really wanted to take a shower, climb into his pyjamas, and leave the homework marking for tomorrow. With any luck, he might have something more intelligent to respond to Tau with after his shower.
“I knew he was a difficult student, his file was shockingly heavy, but I must admit I didn’t really read it all. I wondered if it was exaggerated due to his placement in Slytherin, and that his father’s been in Azkaban since the battle of Hogwarts. I decided to judge his character based on my own observations. It doesn’t look good for him I must say: always in detention, constantly losing house points, fighting with other students including those in his own house, and I’m always receiving complaints from teachers and students alike.”
“Your gift?” Harry had started to blush in his neck again, he could feel it, but he chose to ignore it.
gift to be honest."
“I’m sorry.” Harry apologised. “You’re right, it is something that I get defensive over. It’s a left-over symptom of the war, and a condition that cost me a job in the auror department…”
“Why not?” He shrugged again, ignoring the use of his surname, but Draco leaned closer and whispered into his ear.
-She points her quill at Harry.
Draco gulped his tea down, holding it so tight like he thought it would be stolen from him if he didn't, like it was all he had - his hands shaking. Harry rose from his chair, cup clinked down on the table, and he hugged him. Draco sobbed, eventually putting down his cup and standing to hug Harry.
Harry slowly went and took a seat – another sting of hurt jabbed at him from the lack of hospitality; no offer of tea or coffee, no pleasantries or general greetings. Harry
I'll do it too
“I’m happy to. Do you have the Malfoy vault records by any chance; we’ll need them to prove that Narcissa didn’t receive her thirty percent?” Harry asked, suddenly remembering.
“You had to start that damn snow fight, didn’t you? If I recall correctly, and I
Harry: "Dray ... do yo feel uncomfortable around my friends?"
“If you’re sure about this then… I was thinking about adding some of mine.” Draco looked up at Harry. “My memories that is. I saw him … torture and … kill his followers, others too, but if … if…” Draco took a deep breath and exhaled. “If it helps then you’re right, it will be worth it.” Draco closed his eyes.
"Yeah, I placed an order a few weeks back," Harry explained as he moved closed to the checkout, "I've come to collect it if that's okay. It's under the name Teddy Tonks."
Harry nodded.
Harry paused, remembering how a couple of his students last year had handed in a twelve-inch paper with just a long list of uses. It was for a shield charm likewise, but the students had obviously copied each other, and in the long list of creative uses, included shielding them from bullies, against unwanted suitors, and against someone’s flatulence.
Harry suddenly remembered Tau’s words:
“TOP!” He practically shouted when he found one, rushing back to the bed.
The reported finally stepped aside looking defeated, and Harry wasted no time running after Draco.
-Stomping back to the 8th year dormitory alone, he runs his hand through his messy hair.
Harry didn’t lose his smile, but he made a mental note that he needed no more fire whiskey tonight. He’d dated enough men to know how it goes: you get drunk, you kiss, maybe shag, then wake up regretting last night. He really didn’t plan on doing that with Draco; it would be so awkward if he had a one-night fling with a work colleague, but it was on his mind - no doubt about that.
Cause it's about to get rough for you
Harry wondered if Draco had ever been able to bare himself so openly to another before – or to allow himself to let go so emotionally, but he was glad that Draco was finally releasing some of that pent-up emotion. The masks Draco hid behind were preventing him from letting go of the past, and they were preventing him from forming relationship with other people – be that platonic or otherwise.
“Yes?” Harry stopped and turned around. It looked like Draco had started to read his short letter.
“I assume you both have something to discuss that couldn’t be mentioned
-Monday 26th October - Charms class, Draco walks in and catches his eyes briefly before taking his seat.
. He noticed that it was a purple-blue colour, and the nails literally had ice on them. He was quite frankly shocked, startled and near panic as to what to do, but as he stared down at the frozen hand in his own, it suddenly returned to a normal colour, and the nails started dripping where the ice was now melting.
Their eyes met, and Draco felt his heart beating like a bucking broom. They were so close and sharing the same air. He couldn’t tear himself away … but he had too! He had to step back, but Harry fucking Potter was staring at him questioningly with those unique and rare emerald eyes of his... and then Potter let him go.
“I don’t have time to–” Harry cut himself off as he growled in frustration, running a hand down his face.
“I’m not sure.” Harry admitted, gently squeezing his shoulder. “But I’m sure that Madam Pomfrey will have her fixed up in no time. I’ll take you back to Gryffindor tower in a moment, I just need to speak to Professor Flitwick quickly.”
Miss Payne arrived first, at half past seven, and she started brewing the Murtlap Essence that she had struggled with before. It was a very simple potion for a fifth year, mostly made up of strained pickled tentacles of Murtlaps, but the girl had managed to screw up the order and the stirring. He hoped that she would gain confidence by completing this easier potion successfully.
“There’s nothing wrong with using a dating service Draco! I’m not judging you. I’ll see you tomorrow right, at twelve?” Harry asked. He was praying that Draco wouldn’t panic and flee, avoid him because he though Harry would take the piss or something.
Draco: "Of course. Wouldn't right if we ceased all rivalry now would it?"
Before Draco could answer, the radio 'popped' onto the table. Harry tried to grab it, but it was too late. Not now, not right as the damn interviewer was due!
Harry went to direct Samuel towards the Great Hall – planning to lead the boy with a hand on his shoulder – thinking that Draco would be there eating dinner, but Samuel shook himself free and a loud ‘ARRK’ sound erupted from the boy’s mouth like the honk of a goose. Samuel covered his mouth with both hands and looked positively horrified.
Harry: "Too much?"
“What’s wrong with this. It’s what I usually wear.” Harry frowned, looking down at himself.
“You were quite rude, and dare I say,
“Good morning Master Potter Sir…” The old house elf bowed as he appeared with a ‘pop’. “How may Kreacher be a serving you this morning?”
“Mmm” Harry nodded. “I need to go and speak with Minerva this morning, but I wondered if you fancied getting a drink in the Three Broomsticks after lunch?”
him, but he just didn’t understand why he wouldn’t admit it. Why wouldn’t Draco allow himself to open up to that possibility? What had change?
"Yeah, I think so." Harry answered, still unsure but happy to move on and get this over with.
“No.” Draco answered. “I have not seen the golden boy this morning. Perhaps he overslept.” Draco doubted that: although Harry liked to stay in bed, he was usually awake at the crack of dawn. He had been looking out for him that morning, watching the Great Hall doors and hoping that he would appear for breakfast.
“Right,” repeated Harry.
“How?” Draco whispered “He’s smart, he will have cast another spell so that you cannot reveal the last spell he cast, he will be hiding amongst the students, and the train is about to leave.”
"He'd never ask for something so expensive," Harry continued, "but we know he'd love to have one from the Volant series. He stares at the models in the windows and talks passionately about them. We thought about getting him a Firebolt or an earlier Volant model, but he deserves a Volant 360 and the latest model will last him longer. I know he'll take good care of it – he does with his Nimbus, and It's not like I can't afford it. We don't usually spend so much on him, but this year Andy gave me the go ahead."
Harry blinked, he remembered to smile and nod politely, but he forgot how to use his voice. Either his ears were failing him or she sounded far away and airy. He was still shocked at her creepily cheery mannerism however, her strange appearance, wide dark-blue eyes that never blinked, and her big white teeth that beamed at him framed by her far too happy smile.
-Saturday 6th March. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Draco, Blaise and Pansy go to a muggle theme park.
-They don't leave each others hold - wanting to stay like that forever.
Harry smiled and chuckled, he really like this guy, but he had a lot to contemplate.
"He was, yeah…" Harry paused as he heard the shrill voice of a frazzled mother, demanding her son come away from the window as they had lots to get done, "…but he wants to practice. Hufflepuff have some great players this year…" Harry had to pause again, to let a herd of giggling girls pass by with their Christmas shopping. He found himself pressed up close to a warm body… Draco's body – unchanged, unlike his glamoured facial features. Draco's hand gripped his shoulder as the man glared at the 'impertinent' females.
Draco: "Never mind then."
Knock – Knock – Knock!
“You’ll only laugh at me.” Harry flipped his arms before sipping his fresh coffee.
Harry screamed in anger, about to use another spell on Draco, but Draco quickly used the shield charm.
Harry: "I mean ... I'm screwed aren't I?"
A part of Harry was timorous and reluctant; he
"I can do that." Draco nodded. He was glad that Harry had moved on with the conversation, that he'd calmed down and accepted his help, but what was left unsaid was like the dragon in the room; it was unmissable, hot and blazing for notice, and it wouldn't be easily removed.
I am afraid that I cannot elaborate my answer, but yes, I have questioned my sanity many times. The most I can give you, is that I have experienced things no one else could see or hear – real things, but being the only one made me feel like I was losing my mind.
Merlin, who knew Draco could be such a sap? It was all rather confusing, and the mess he had landed himself… Well, not really knowing what to say, he quickly settled on sending a short message and Christmas greeting, before darting into his bathroom:
Harry then heard Draco stirring awake, the quiet groans loud in the silent room. He quickly placed the book down on the floor to check the man was alright.
“I don’t know Mr Potter.” Said Reece Leonard, who was fidgeting nervously and clearly worried about his friend. “She was drinking from that cup…” He pointed to the orange cup still on the floor, the remains of the liquid splashed over the stone. “…I think she took the wrong cup though, because I remember her putting it down by the brain cake and it’s still there with her lipstick on it.”
-Harry falls onto his bed at night, twiddling his wand.
Ginny: "Get lost Malfoy! Come on Harry, he isn't worth it."
Harry put the parchment to the side and plumped up his pillows. He called Kreacher to bring him a glass of milk and honey, and a glass of water for the night. The milk would help him get to sleep after too much caffeine, and it would also tie him over until breakfast.
Sunday, 27th September 1998. Harry smiles at Draco as he enters their common room.
"With the student numbers finally increasing, I'm am looking forward to great year." Headmistress McGonagall informed them all with a warm, excited smile. Harry tore is eyes away to look at the headmistress instead.
-Harry chases after him, but he painfully pushes him away - not really wanting to.
“Do you do that a lot?” Draco asked, mild concern flickered in his eyes over his coffee.
Once the unpleasant and disconcerting sensations of apparition had passed, and their feet had firmly reconnected with solid ground, Harry felt Draco’s warm body abruptly leave his hold. The man looked confused – possibly angry, as he surveyed his new surroundings through tear blurred eyes.
“It’s Harry. How are you feeling?” Harry asked, but then he felt rather stupid; he remembered Poppy confirming that Draco had developed the symptoms of hallucinations and childlike behaviour – would the man even be in the right state of mind to sufficiently answer that question?
-Harry and Draco stand watching their friends together, laughing, sharing stories, and deciding what to do next. Harry turns to face Draco, sharing as much love as they could force into one kiss.
-Draco looks at his dark mark, then at his appearance in the bathroom mirror. He frowns and runs from the room to find Hermione.
“What the hell are you on about Potter!” Draco snapped.
Madam Pomfrey excused herself, quite happy to leave Harry dealing with the unstable Malfoy. Harry nodded, and returned his attention to the man. Draco responded better in Harry presence, and Harry didn’t quite know how he felt about that. Radiant, that Draco trusted and preferred his company? Bittersweet, that Draco only clang to him because he wasn’t mentally unstable? Perhaps he should feel more aggrieved that Draco only wanted him when he was ill.
murder or torture someone through
“We can’t be that boring sir!” Carlton Anderson stated, a Gryffindor with shoulder length brown hair pushed back from his face.
Minerva nodded and levitated Camellia into the air. She thanked him before striding out of the Great Hall. Mr Leonard went to follow her, but Harry quickly used a sticking charm on his feet.
Harry was manipulating Draco’s incoming snow attack, planning to send the growing snowball straight towards the blond the moment that Draco let up with his current spell. He thought he had it all sussed out, but before he had a chance to enact his evil plan… Draco flicked his wand up, smoothly ending one spell and immediately casting another in such a quick succession, straight at the very massive snowball above his head.
Draco: "I wouldn't be kissing you otherwise."
Harry: "I'm not half as brave, or as okay as people think. You should know that."
Harry chuckled as he started his story. If he made it sound a bit more impressive by omission, then … oh well.
"Ah, well, once you have chosen your possible secret chèrie- an anonymous person that piques your interest, someone you would like to correspond with, we will write to said person to see if they would like to hear from you. We'll send you a package if they agree to be your chérie, and you will be given a magical parchment that has a partner piece. You'll be able to communicate via that parchment to your secret chérie directly, but there are rules. You must not share your real name, give personal addresses, or share any other information that gives away your identity or location. These are the pre-terms set between you both, that you both wish to remain anonymous and do not ask or actively seek out such information. Apart from that, what you wish to talk about is indubitably private between you both. You can talk about hobbies, feelings, general daily things and dislikes for example, and it is like a secret rendezvous between you are your chérie, and not even Le'Amortentia is privy to what the two of you talk about. The idea is that you feel comfortable knowing your identity is assuredly concealed, but also granting you and your Chérie the means to discover each other on a much deeper level in privacy. If such a time comes to pass in which you no longer wish to communicate with them, you can let us know and we can kindly reject them on your behalf. Likewise, if you both decide you wish to meet, we will arrange for you both to meet here in the safety of one of our meeting rooms."
Harry:  *Nodded* "It reminded me why there are less student at Hogwarts this year, why the carriages were't as full ... and of all the people i'd failed.
Random students appear again, and Draco moves to avoid them - finding himself turning down the wrong hallway.
The radio hovered behind them; far to engrossed in each other, they didn't notice.
Draco chuckled and shook his head. Harry found himself mildly jealous - Draco even chuckled elegantly, it was soft, breathless and warming, where as his own was deep and rough.
Planning, for Harry at least,
“Padfoot? Does he have remarkably huge feet – troll feet?” Harry asked, once again containing his laughter over Draco’s reaction. Harry remembered Draco asking about his feet in jest before, in one of their first messages to each other when they had first chosen their pen names.
Harry rolled his eyes and went back to testing the food with his wand – shaking his head in disbelief. Draco was certainly a massive puzzle; no one could simultaneously insult him and show concern for his well being in the same breath the way this man could. That was another conundrum though, that Draco even cared about him at all.
Draco: "Why, me off course!"
-Images of his mother and father when he was a few months old play out around the room, capture his attention.
The written part of their charms N.E.W.T.s was over, the parchment in front of them flew magically to the desk up front , and they were dismissed. It was over, Harry and Draco had finished all their N.E.W.T.s. They were now free adult, about to embark on a journey called 'the rest of their lives'.
"I best get going Harry," Draco announce as he stood up, "I'll visit Diagon Alley in the morning and catch up with you when I get back."
"Potter! You're rambling." Draco interrupted him. "I know what I'm doing."
Draco: "Very well. *He turned to Harry* Think about it Potter, I'll find you when term starts."
“Where on earth did you–?” Draco asked, still in shock at the way Harry had handled Auror Graves.
He berated himself.
“Listen Potter. I just wanted to say I’m sorry. As you so kindly put it, I did indeed act like a ‘prat’ yesterday. We have to work together. It would be nice if we could at least be civil.”
That pesky radio silently appeared again, flickering slightly, but it had just enough magic to send golden waves through the school one last time. As the radio started to play it's final song, Harry and Draco were too busy kissing.
I really do hope all my readers are all enjoying this story so far. This chapter was both fun and hard to write. Please, please leave comments so I know what you like and what you don't XD it helps me create better stories, and it really does encourages me to post new chapters sooner.
“Harry, I’m fine really I-”
Harry chucked; he was getting lots of history lessons today it seemed and-
Harry chuckled; he knew exactly what that translated to: Let's change the subject because this is getting awkward, but I am impressed that you can even remember all of your adoptive family members.
He put his mug of half-finished hot chocolate down on his bed side table and sighed, before reaching into his draw for that familiar magical parchment and quill. He wouldn’t expect Tau to respond this late, but writing was much better than letting his guilt twist and fester – he needed the distraction; his mind was trying to dig up old guilt at the lives that had been lost because Voldemort wanted
-Draco's hands run though Harry's hair
Harry said nothing else, he simple walked over to the small kitchenette, and with wandless magic he started boiling some water for the coffee.
“Don’t worry Mr Bartlett,” Harry spoke on the way down, “if it’s what I think it is, then they only last about twenty minutes.” He was hoping to re-assure the young boy, which judging by the slight relaxing of his stiff posture, he’d succeeded. Something was bothering Harry though… if Samuel had
-Thursday 4th - 3am. Making tea in Harry's room, after both young boys wake due to more images of death and abuse. Small tired smiles shared, and loving hugs.
Harry’s head flew up to face his bathroom door, hand pausing with the toothbrush, wondering who was knocking at…
“Nightmares?” Draco asked. Harry just nodded. “Oh, come here Potter!” Draco ordered; it burned his eyes just looking at Harry’s state of dress. He stepped closer to the raven-haired man.
Harry drifted deeper, his mind lulling him into slumber against his conscious desire to do so, but it still painted the sweetest of images. A long body leaned over him; buttery-blond hair tickled his cheeks as the grey eyes got closer to his face. So close. He could also feel the gentle breaths against his lips, and he could feel the phantom pressure against his lap as the body lowered the last few inches to sit there. Harry licked his lips in his semi-slumber. The phantom pressure - pressing a chaste kiss against his own lips, drove him to pull at that thick buttery-blond hair … but his hand grabbed at nothing but air, and it smacked down into his left check and nose instead.
Draco: "Radio huh? I never took It Potter! And for your information ... I didn't do anything."
Harry laughed agian, but Draco knew that laugh. It was the 'funny you should mention that laugh'. Harry palmed it off with a single word, 'later.'
-Images of Draco being chosen by the hat for Slytherin.
-Draco tickles Harry, and they fall of the bed laughing.
Harry: "Shut up Malfoy!"
Hesitating at first before finally sitting down on the chair he'd bumped into, he sighed in resignation. Why did he let Ron and Hermione talk him into this? He supposed, he'd only accepted to come because it was rude to decline a birthday gift. Although ... he secretly felt that this was the worst gift he had ever received - It was an invasion of his life choices to be frank, and his friends never left well enough alone. Yes, he wanted to find love, but he wanted to find it like a normal human being and not through some strange magical dating service. Hermione, especially, invested far too much of her time worrying about him and his future, coming up with crazy idea to 'get him laid'. It was almost as mortifying as sitting here waiting to be set up with a date - surely this was for desperate, insane, unattractive people.
Ginny: "I love you Harry. After everything we've been through this year, I'm glad it's finally over. I'm glad we get to be together now, are you?"
Draco chuckled into Harry shoulder, and Harry pulled back with a small smile. He squeezed Draco’s shoulder. “We both hide our pain, our grief and our guilt. As misplaced as half of it probably is, it still hurts right?”
older now and with ages came maturity … but he’d never have expected this from Malfoy of all people. Was Malfoy scheming and up to something? He had wondered why Malfoy would accept the potions professor job and move back to England, when the last Harry had heard, he owned a book store in France and was living with his mother there.
He retched into the toilet bowl. Whisky burnt fifty time hotter – like acid, when it was coming back up. He cursed himself for panicking that he was still a Horcrux. Tom, Voldemort… he was gone! No one was in his fucking head! No one!
Harry: "So, no orange with red?"
"What age range would you be happy with in a partner?" Malaise smiled affably, her wide blue eyes peering up at him over her purple spectacles as she leaned over the parchment.
blowing up cauldrons, but she could brew potions to ‘exceeds expectations’ level when she concentrated. This year she had increased her penchant for explosive errors, but she had also become careless and nervous. It wasn’t like her, and it would be best for her head of house – Neville Longbottom – to know that something was off.
Sitting at a one long Hogwarts table in the middle of the Great Hall, decorated spectacularly in a winter wonderland theme of silver and blue, were seven merry teachers, and twenty-seven joyful students. Everyone was tucking into their Christmas dinner and talking cheerfully between mouthfuls of turkey, stuffing, and roast potatoes, over the sounds of silverware on brilliant white plates.
Harry drew the Mannaz shaped rune on the bottom centre of the parchment and run the quill feather over it, watching as glimpses of a past memory surfaced as the words vanished. He shook his head, not wanting to think about a certain diary from his second year at Hogwarts.
-Draco nods to the beat.
-Teachers shake their heads sadly.
The fact Tau seemed to hate Elliot’s treatment of his family, well… that spoke volumes of Tau’s own loyalty to family. So far, Harry hadn’t gotten the sense of Tau having anyone close to him. Tau always seemed to be alone, or at least, his writing portrayed it that way.
Ron, Hermione, Draco, and Harry sat at a table finishing their drinks - discussing the interview due to start in 10 minutes.
“What does this have to do with me?” Asked Harry, suspecting he knew which way this was leaning, but he wanted to see what Draco had concluded himself. He hadn’t really spoken to Silas Avery since that day in Draco’s potions class – when the boy had demanded to know what he had been doing in the class room six weeks ago, and they tended to avoid each other in the halls and such.
Draco: "Fucking Hell!"
“Today, I overheard him talking to Mr Korbin Fraizer-”
“Yes?” Harry turned his head, suddenly aware of coin-grey eyes on his face... on his lips.
