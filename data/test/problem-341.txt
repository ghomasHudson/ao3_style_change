He tossed his rubbish, selected the Ministry package from his list, and entered the white door that appeared beside him. It closed on its own, creaking before it silenced the echoing sounds of the crowd and nearby traffic. Now, in the dark of Subspace and the path to his next destination, a quiet classical theme played. The cold caressed his face as he skated down the path in time to the adagio tempo.
Harry kept the wince off his face. “Thanks. I’ll just check my desk and head over there. And there’s nothing interesting about my chocolate choices!” She’d already gone.
Avoiding the canteen, Harry headed out of the Ministry to grab food and a coffee from a nearby stand. He saw the Daily Prophet on the newspaper stand beside it and braced himself for the worst. The cover, at least, was Harry Potter-free. He grabbed a copy and paid for it along with his meal. He went back to his desk to eat and review its contents. From front to back, he didn’t find a single mention of himself. It made buying the damn thing kind of worth it. He tossed it back in the bin and wiped his fingers clean.
He wanted another drink to flush the want that lingered, despite the turn, that made his body run hot. He reached for the leather cuff around his wrist and turned it over and over until the feeling passed. He stayed in place, the conversation replaying as he ordered another drink. Even after the cocktail, he couldn’t identify where he had gone wrong.
Telling her opened the box. Breathed life into the very things he’d keep at a distance. But the clock over her shoulder made clear that Harry was now almost an hour late. He might not show at all. And suffering, like wine, was better shared with friends. He’d already spent the past week in half a state of disbelief; that was admirable enough, and outside perspective could be helpful. He straightened his posture.
“You can wait for him out there. Might want to grab a beverage or something. It can take a while, depending on what we find.” Harry nodded, glancing back at the door they’d taken Malfoy through. He thanked the man when he got his ID back.
Potter remained in his dreams. In one, he watched Potter press his hands against a cactus until blood dripped on the skulls at his feet. Sometimes there were snakes: hundreds of them curving out from the rocks, the sand, the leafless bushes and fruitless trees. Their tan bodies blended into the landscape and the whole of them shivered and blurred, a mass drawing closer to Potter’s tired frame. They struck him soundlessly, but with violence. They pierced his neck, circled his wrist, an ankle. The rest came in waves, the force of their mouths and bodies twisting Potter's figure like a marionette. In other dreams, the tattooed lines on Potter’s body ran the course of his veins, creating jagged branches like the deadened trees of the desert, of Draco’s ancestral home.
Harry lay awake long after, his blood and body slow to settle. He’d woken in this place nearly every morning the last few days, his body a comma to Draco's full stop. Something in him had been reaching. Drawn to the body in his arms. But for what.
“I asked if you had plans for the next few hours.” Harry spoke at his reflection, fumbling more with a particularly obstinate strand. “I was going to explore a little, pick up some souvenirs while we had some free time. Figured I’d open it up, in case you need anything or just wanted to get out for a little while.”
“Well, yes, but this one in particular… I had some things I wanted to think about. Without, er, distraction.”
Harry’s hands clenched. “So do lots of people! Charity funders. Teachers. At least rotate us. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m late for work.”
Harry squeezed him tight and nodded back. Harry sat down first, his back sprawled against the curve on one side. Draco lay back between Harry’s legs and against his chest. Like this, the water lapped just below his chin, the bubbles tickling his skin.
The next morning, for the first time since getting home, Harry did not make it to the Ministry early. He didn’t wake up until well after ten. He jumped into his robes and tossed the files in his bags. He could organise them when he got into the office.
Harry leaned in a little further, ducking his head. “I didn’t know you’d quit. If I had realised it sooner—”
Didn't he see how impossible it was otherwise, whatever this thing was between them? If Harry'd thought of Ron from the start; or worse, their exchanges before and during the War? Insurmountable barriers. Surely Malfoy didn't really mean for Harry to face all that again. For the lines to be drawn always between them.
“Sounds nuts, man,” Dave said, sitting back. “My family grew up in Denver, and it freaked us the fuck out when that happened. School’s supposed to be safe, y’know? Or at least it was. Not really so novel now.”
Harry relaxed and didn’t even mind when Ron knocked out a bishop. “Now that I can do. With any luck, it’ll be the only thing I have to say to anyone all day.”
Though that wasn’t entirely true. Hermione had found comfort in his presence, once he’d finally given her the time and space to share. Teddy was a healthy, social child. And for how horribly things had blown up, he’d even seen Malfoy come out of his shell with Harry’s quiet support, his attention through the crowds and streets.
“I see. Do I wait here, or?” There were no seats on this side of the processing area. Further out, past the desks, he could see a welcome lounge.
“Never could back down from a challenge,” he said. A wind ran through the street, then, carrying the smell from the coffee shop they’d gone to for souvenirs yesterday. It smelled warm, like hazelnuts. Standing where he was, Harry caught the increasingly familiar hint of mint from Malfoy as well. It was easy, in that moment, to imagine the Malfoy he’d never known. One that wasn’t burdened with a hateful upbringing and then a tarnished past. Who needn’t hide behind wealth or Manor walls or towers made of paper. Instead he could just be a bloke on this street full of neon lights and rainbow coloured pavements, enjoying an overpriced biscuit with a mix of friends. With Harry.
“You have three years to get those credits,” Malfoy eventually said. Harry threw up a careless hand.
“Until he made it clear he wasn’t who I thought he was. I thought he could understand what it was like. That we’re not who everyone thinks we are. That he could see me differently. But I’m just ‘Harry Potter the Great’ to him as well.”
Of course she did. He smiled a little and reached out to grab her foot and squeeze. She gave him a small smile back.
He didn’t join Harry in a leatherworking shop. “I’m a vegetarian,” he explained. “And the smell of hide will…” Malfoy didn’t finish the thought, just ran a hand over his face, paling, and walked away to sit on a bench. Harry kept his exploration brief and got a new wallet for Ron. Then he sat with Malfoy and watched the traffic pass until the blond was ready to go.
“Isn’t that the point of a cocktail hour.” Harry tried not to wince at the watered down mouthful of his drink. “To talk to people?” He handed over Malfoy’s glass.
Harry took several fast steps away from them. It never ended well when he engaged. His temper had only somewhat softened with age. But then his feet slowed. One of the items he’d modified the night before had been an early one: journalists. He’d softened it to, ‘journalists that don’t schedule meetings in advance (and Rita Skeeter, ever).’
Malfoy’s eyes narrowed a moment beneath his fringe. It still needed a cut. Malfoy also did a poor job of avoiding the other pedestrians, occasionally checking shoulders with black clad figures focused on their iPhones, and flinching away when others got too close. Harry’d read about the iPhone during his research before the trip—just released and all the rage apparently.
“Agree with you on that one, East Bay,” Vickie said, moving on to her dessert. “Not much is safe now. It’s like what that Professor Something said in Session 2 yesterday, about the interference of all this Muggle tech with our Apparition and portkeys. The satellites and stuff. I hate to say it, but I think he really proved my point about…”
“Hm.” A couple brushed past Malfoy as the trolley started to come into sight, and Harry didn’t miss the minor flinch. Under the guise of leading him towards the opening door, Harry put himself between Malfoy and the crowd. Malfoy swallowed. “Well, if we end up in one from England I will not be impressed.”
“And my favourite godchild,” Harry said, squeezing Teddy tight. He planted a quick kiss on Teddy’s head before tossing him onto the couch cushions. “Is your stuff all set?”
Draco reached up to cover Harry’s hand. He bent his head, hesitated, then kissed the seam where their hands met.
“More like family, I think,” she said after a bit, though it didn’t come out like a compliment. “See one another at holidays. Faff about the weather until the punch kicks in. Like Percy.”
“This is your place?” Harry’s head tilted back so far Draco wondered how he didn’t slip on the pavement, well and truly covered as it was in a layer of snow. Maybe the bags held him down.
Company policy permitted refusal for delivery. Potter’s response should have felt like a gift. When the Ministry inevitably sent another one, Draco could send it right back, no contact required. Only then he wouldn’t know why Potter looked so exhausted. Or what he was doing in the desert, bouncing between broken homes at the edge of good and... not. They were talking now. He could ask—
Not that technicalities meant anything to the people they’d hurt. And the ten year anniversary was just half a year away. Feelings were probably coming back for people. Harry focused back on his book. Voldemort’s followers had been terrible people, but Harry had seen and arrested many other terrible people since then. Sometimes with Malfoy’s help. He didn’t know what to do with that, so he imagined The List and let the thought fade away.
He stood, his gaze rising slowly toward the bullpen entrance and the lone desk he knew occupied the space beside it, to the left. The piles of paperwork on its surface and surrounding areas far surpassed Harry’s own. They obscured any view of the white-blond haired person seated there. Harry’d seen how the paper protected its occupant from the taunts the Aurors often threw his way. Aurors were visual like that. Liked to see their target before striking.
“Those two are the worst,” Harry said, flipping his book back up. “But I’m still taking the compliment.”
Draco didn’t have to check that Potter was right. The whisper of the Dark Lord didn’t linger anymore. For the first time in years, he felt alone in his body. More like the Draco Before.
She caught it with ease. “It has actually. We're doing Christmas on our own this year. Things have been so busy, figured we should reserve a few days for ourselves."
“Come on,” he said to the Deniden and reached for his wand. Then the compound pulsed. Every door and window shattered outward, the light grew brighter, and Draco’s Mark
Potter shrugged. “Something like that. Some places are easier than others.” He stared at his hands. “Those things, they take something away. Houses are supposed to be safe.”
“So d’you work with Draco? I know, like, fuck all about how it works over there, but everything just seems so small by comparison, I imagine you all know each other.”
About sixty feet away from them were several fully nude people, ranging from solidly in their thirties to seventy-somethings. None had ventured into the water, though a few had their feet dancing in the seemingly freezing waves that slid up the shore. Instead, most were laid out on blankets or making castles in the sand. Harry blinked several times before he took them for real.
Draco huffed at his nerves and that damn confidence of Harry’s, reaching for a water biscuit. "Only to tell you off."
When he started down the hallway toward the condo, he paused at the familiar redhead seated on the stoop. Ginny caught sight of him and gave a little wave.
For a moment, Malfoy’s face was stunned, unmoving. It remained that way until the music changed. A group beside them cheered and pressed past them toward the dance floor.
“Albert, it’s that kind of insight that’s keeping your arse in the lead these days.” Jenkins laughed in a sharp, loud bark, then slapped the wall beneath his hand so hard it shook off Harry’s desk calendar. Harry reached over to pick it up and press it back into place. Yes, it confirmed, he had been home for less than a day. He went back to sorting the reports, well aware the show would end when they noticed their audience had no interest. They bantered a little longer over him, flexing some high-level arrest or another, before returning to their seats.
Vickie snapped her fingers at him, nodding her head several times. “Yes, you’re right. I remember that. It was right around Columbine.” She turned to Harry and Malfoy when she explained, “Tragic No-Maj massacre at a school in Colorado. These kids brought guns, tried to make a bomb. Shook the nation.” She frowned, spearing into her fruit. “Anyway, I remember they mentioned it in our training, they talked about a battle at Hog… wash? Hogarth?”
Draco pressed their foreheads close, his eyes drifting shut. “This. I was so sure that you’d never… I’ve tried to be a realist about things. Our prospects. And I’ve had a theory actually.”
“Indeed," he said. Any of the other responses on his mind would get him fired. Robards let his seat tilt back further, both hands on his chest now.
Draco came up to the bed so quietly, Harry didn’t face him until the blond strands were visible over the top of his book.
“They did not! Oh, I’ll be so upset, especially when they wouldn’t let me put ‘Posh Git, Extraordinaire.’” The distance between them disappeared as Harry crowded beside him, grasping Draco’s hand to pull it back away from the tag.
Then he heard it. A shuffling of the curtain. A grazing against the wall, likely Malfoy’s knuckles reaching for a towel. Harry’s breathing slowed further. Malfoy was moving at least. For a while longer, only the sounds of the shower running remained.
“Ah yes.” She grunted with the effort of tying up a bag of practice jerseys. “And to show off how important ethically sourced furniture is to you.” She snorted. She’d seen the Prophet article, then.
He closed his eyes against the torturous images her question conjured. Only that made it easier to envision the dimples in Harry’s lower back, the things Harry would whimper (and in what breathless tones). Draco forced his eyes open wide. “No. And bad guess.”
Draco stood up, but made no further sound for a long time. Harry's leg cramped from the effort to hold himself still. Then the bed dipped with Draco’s added weight, and Draco's back pressed against his. The tension bled from him.
Harry moved closer, lingering near the outskirts of the group until someone mentioned they had about two minutes to go and should start getting ready. Harry did another sweep across the horizon, his bag tucked close to his side, then made his way over to claim one of the umbrella spokes. When one minute was announced, Harry caught the sounds of running feet. Malfoy was moving toward them quickly, a suitcase in his hand. Thirty seconds. Harry saw some of the others drawing tighter together when they recognised Malfoy, some muttering sounds of disbelief. Malfoy had slowed then, avoiding anyone’s eyes. No one made room when he reached them.
Years ago, she’d have called him on it, burning after the War with the conviction she’d never again let him pass things off as ‘fine’ when they were going to shit. Now, she’d have nodded, taken a seat, and dug into the platter herself. It was 2010, after all. They were thirty. Lots of things were going to shit.
This was what he’d wanted: the only thing tying him to England had gone. He almost looked across the bullpen, but covered his eyes instead. No, he still had to be here for Hermione. He couldn't leave yet. He'd owl the Spanish Ministry tomorrow.
Wetting his lips, Harry stepped down the hall and paused in front of the door. Sliding a palm along the wood, he leaned against it to listen for any other movements. The shuffle of a curtain. Clinking personal care items.
The day after speaking with Harry, Robards called Malfoy back to the Ministry. He offered Malfoy a job: not with the CRAPI Department, but as a full Auror, to begin case work immediately if he wanted it. Harry wasn’t there for the meeting, though he’d been fairly creative in the excuses he considered to go in. Beyond handing over everything he knew to Robards and later, Internal Affairs, they agreed it was best that he take some time off work for a while. Robards was grateful for Harry’s honesty, but also troubled, and while he wasn’t going to take punitive action against him for sitting on his information for so long, he had to do something. So he sent him on administrative leave. Harry penned the letter withdrawing his application to Minister Salas himself. Spain was not the solution, really.
She shook her head and refilled it again. “There is something else I hoped you could speak to Teddy about when you take him today.”
“What did you pick?” Harry asked, tossing his tote into the corner and pulling out the few jumpers he had not yet worn.
Lifting his head from the pillow, he took in Draco’s formal, seated position on the chair in the corner. Harry slumped. Draco had dressed in his usual ensemble of softly coloured jumper and trousers. Beside him, on the desk, sat two breakfast trays. Draco’s gaze focused around Harry’s knees. The openness on his face had gone.
At some point, Malfoy stepped into place beside him. The realisation came slowly. One moment, Harry was staring eye level at the window. Then, against the dark impression of a blue apartment tower, the window reflected a set of eyes back at him below strands of familiar blond hair. Harry stared at him, surprised he was allowed to.
Skating closer, Draco paused at the threshold. The employee manual forbade a courier’s entry into unoccupied homes. That probably included skeletons like this one. He reached for the package in his bag, then stopped. The nape of his neck hummed. The cans had stopped moving.
“Yes,” Teddy answered, at the same moment Andromeda’s voice clearly said “No” from the kitchen. Teddy’s ears flattened as he let his teal hair darken to black, his eyes shining the same brilliant green as Harry’s. Harry scritched at Teddy’s ears.
Potter tapped his wand in a steady beat under Draco’s jawline. His hands smelled like earth and iron. “Does the Ministry have any idea you're delivering packages? Because I bet they don't. And I doubt they’d like it.”
“What’s different about this, then?” Harry had a theory. He didn’t track people around the world without some ability to understand them. Even so, he wanted to test it first.
They listened to the short tour, but skipped the walk through a narrow, crowded showroom to wander back to the bridge. Harry leaned against the railing. When Malfoy stepped beside him and crossed his arms over the edge of the suspension bridge, his arm rested near Harry’s. Together, they eyed the sea extending before them.
“So how’s Luna, then?” he asked, dropping the collected bludger into the case she offered. He’d seen some press coverage about the two of them in one of his Quidditch mags. He’d have asked about it at The Burrow this trip, but she’d been too busy to attend any of the brunches.
Harry stamped out the cigarette and made his way back into the club. The atmosphere had clearly shifted. The lights were darker, but the strobes beamed brighter, beacons in a roiling sea of skin and sweat. The tobacco and liquor ran through him, pulsing with the music. Harry could be anywhere, in a place like this. Anyone. They were variations of the same thing, whatever the country.
Harry stared down at the board. The warm wood of the squares reminded him of the sheen on the Spanish Minister’s desk, when she’d made the offer. He blinked a few times to clear his mind. “Spent the last two days debriefing with the Spanish Ministry and their public relations department, I’ve talked it to death: but it was killer. No distracting me to eke out a win, that’s cheating!”
“It’s nothing personal. As you said yourself, this is the last conference before your continuing education credits are due. If you don’t go to this one, it’ll take you three months before the next qualifying conference is held in Belgium, and I’m sorry to say that not even you can work with a lapsed Auror certification. They do give you three years to get all your credits, Auror Potter, and there have been plenty of conferences in that time. No one to blame but yourself on this one.”
“Don’t get him started.” Malfoy’s voice washed over Harry’s spine from somewhere to his right. Harry stood a little straighter. Dave waved Malfoy off, tapping at the screen.
"Speaking of liquor," Hermione said, squeezing Harry's shoulders as she passed him. With a flick of her wand, the dark cabinets in the corner flew open to let out a steady line of bottles and silver accoutrements. The items assembled themselves neatly behind the makeshift bar. The three of them had put it together last year from a desk Harry never used. Hermione surveyed the stock and asked, "What sounds appealing? I've just enough cherries left to make you that old fashioned you like. Otherwise, we’ve been partial to an Earl Grey Martini lately."
The news broke by the end of the week. The Prophet gave the story front page coverage with an exclusive Harry’d given to the two blokes he’d spoken with the week before. He got final say before it went to press, and they’d argued a bit about the phrasing for his role, but the end result suited him well enough.
“What are you doing here, Malfoy?” At Draco’s silence, he took a step closer, nudging Draco’s shoulder with a boot. “You kicked my face in like this once, you know. I could return the favor.”
“Is that why you joined International Operations?” Malfoy didn’t look at him as he asked, but Harry felt his full attention run down his spine.
Robards paused, mouth bunching, then said: "Auror Malfoy will be joining you. The Ministry is going to room you together at a nearby Muggle hotel. The rates there are completely obscene, so we won’t be covering your food."
He laughed, even as the corners of his eyes started to sting. “Why are you apologising? I’m the prat that’s left you alone all this time. To deal with everything. When you needed me.”
He drew some pictures in the condensation of his beer mug. “It was fine. Actually, I—” He checked Ron and Ginny to see how engrossed they were in their argument.
“If you really liked me, you’d have taken your time getting undressed,” Draco said, pouting now as a lone finger slid lower, past Harry’s stomach. “Let me get over my nerves first.”
“They most certainly do. There’s an island out in that bay, Alcatraz, and they used to put all their worst criminals on it. Muggles, as far as I know. They no longer use it—some people managed to escape once, and what’s the point of a prison that isn’t as inescapable…” Malfoy looked at him, and when their eyes met something tightened in Harry’s chest.
When he heard of their plan, Ron had immediately scoffed, but relented in helping once the food was ready. “Are you serious? Doesn’t this just validate everything I’ve told you about that place for all these years? And Harry, you are lucky you’re my best mate, because I cannot believe you knew about this and let it go.”
Harry watched, then said: “So, there’s a chance I’d actually have to see him wearing them. Or worse, after the fact.”
“So I didn’t make it up?” He traced the curve of Harry’s cheek, nestled beneath his glasses. His voice left him whisper soft.
“I thought we could start small,” Harry whispered, meeting Draco’s eyes in the mirror. “But you say when we go farther.” Keeping their gazes locked, Harry trailed his hands hands lightly over Draco’s and waited. Draco pressed back into him. Harry could see his focus turning away from their reflections, then drawn back. He wondered how long it had been since Draco stood to stare at himself properly. Looked at his reflection and really saw what was staring back at him without the filter of memories and regret.
“But,” Ron said, picking up when Hermione failed to continue. “We think we should find our own place. The Ministry bit... I don't know if I'll ever agree with it. But thuiking about it more, it wasn’t really her job that was the problem. It’s her work habits, and what it means for our, uh... our family. Hopefully, someday." He looked at her, as did the rest of them.
Harry nodded. A few feet away, the group had split into couples, Vickie and Dave off and chatting to the side down the hill a bit. Vickie’s hand lingered on Dave’s shoulder. Harry put his hand in his pocket before it did something dangerous, like wrap Malfoy up in it.
“Thought I’d see what the fuss was,” Malfoy said, his words laced with tequila. When he let his lip go, it shone, another beacon, a lighthouse calling Harry home. Harry moved closer, hearing the whisper with which Malfoy added: “The second floor is full of mirrors.”
Here, he watched the scorpion retreat from the magazine. Its measured steps settled several times on dark lines along the wooden grain. Except it wasn’t the grain. They were runes, a series of them, trailing the edge of a circle. A casting circle.
“It’s a good colour,” Harry said. His hand reached for some of the strands. It matched the flush on Malfoy’s face. Warmed him, like all those jumpers. “Nice, isn’t it?”
The city sprawled before them, sparkling with light. The newly built highrises, made almost entirely of glass, glittered as cars passed in and out of the city along winding skyways. Further out, over the water, clouds hung low, and fog reached like fingers toward them. Each breath felt cold and clear.
Harry went home without the files from his desk. He’d thought about it, a lot. That counted, certainly. Malfoy wasn’t at his desk when Harry left, which made it easier. He took the Floo to Diagon Alley, facing the crowds to get some details from Gringotts about how to transfer his accounts. Afterwards, he opted to walk home.
The Deniden. Two glasses later, sprawled on his mattress, it came to him in Luna’s whisper-soft voice.
The clock said 2:36 a.m. when Harry looked again. He pressed the heels of his palms against his eyes until colours formed in the dark, a kaleidoscope of sparks.
Checking his pocket again for his wand, he traveled through Subspace and braced himself at the exit. Just ten more minutes, and he’d return to his crap but uneventful life.
Harry swallowed his gratitude. Malfoy’s silence either meant: one, he’d been asleep when Harry woke up to the once more single king-sized bed, his body half curled around the other man, or two, Malfoy had been awake and was definitely, absolutely, Not Going To Talk About It. Either route worked for him. Even if he could taste the lingering mint on his tongue, and his eyes kept darting to the juncture of Malfoy’s neck and right shoulder, where he now knew a small collection of birthmarks could be found.
had been her undoing. (“I’m too much of a reader for languages,” she’d said in a huff. “That’s what it looks like!”) They made quick business of dinner, Harry and Ron both nabbing seconds, before settling into the living room for Wizarding Chess.
Other than forgetting the List, like an idiot. This was exactly what happened when he Got Involved. Maybe he’d make a portable version of it when he moved to Spain. Though, he supposed, he wouldn’t really need it there. Strangers at a bar were never that complicated.
Harry wondered if he was still asleep. Auror Robards sounded far away, like he’d whispered to Harry in a wind tunnel. It wasn’t possible.
“Not really. It’ll be nice to have those two gone from the bullpen. They drove me mad with how they’d talk over my head for ages.”
Pansy was to blame. If she weren’t running late, she would have been there to remind him that while it was fun to
Ron wiped the steam off his face, but kept the wry twist to his mouth. "Ginny said she comes home more, so she deserves the welcome home. Something about the principle of the thing, blah, blah. Didn’t think you’d mind, truth be told.” Ron paused to check Harry’s face. His cavalier tone ebbed a little. “And I got that new one just for you. Seemed poetic, for a man of the law."
Draco pulled a large box from the bag. He had to widen his knees to keep it from slipping off. “I see. I’m supposed to give you a card, when you didn’t even wrap my gift?”
“Isn’t it, to save a life?” Harry asked. The edges of Malfoy’s mouth drew down for a moment. He looked away to the crowd behind them, his back almost touching his reflection in the window.
“Naturally, Ron asked me what job, and Susan just told him.” Hermione trailed off, gesturing large with her hand before shaking her head. “We came back here and had a terrible row. I want to say that I wish I had cut her off or something, or distracted Ron. It would have made everything easier for a while longer. But at the same time—the two of us can’t keep dancing around it: what I want to do with my life puts me at the Ministry. It’s been years. And Ron is going to have to accept that. Or not.” She stared at the contents of the carafe.
“Auror Malfoy submitted his resignation to me last Monday. Surely you’ve noticed his desk’s been empty? It’s been a blessing to get the eyesore of all those papers out of sight at last.”
Pansy’s sharp laugh echoed, and she gestured to the bartender. At his inquiry, Draco conceded that yes, mistakes had been made, and the martini should go. This time, he ordered champagne.
“For a bookstore, maybe. Or one of those cozy hipster coffee shops that are springing up all over New York.” Pansy adjusted her tie, pulling it down until she could undo the collar and top button of her shirt. “Whatever your place was zoned for, it’s still twee. And Charlotte agrees with me.”
The assistant blinked at him a few times, brows raising. “Of course, Auror Potter. Unless something…” He turned toward Malfoy’s desk.
Harry watched, noting the same elegant movements that had opened the bags of letters were now shredding that napkin.
Ginny turned to him, face flushed and still aglow from the game. She scanned his face and her smirk grew a little wider. “Pretty effective that way, I’ve found.” She started to peel off some of her kit, the leather smell heavy in the air, then bent down to collect some of the warm up brooms. As one of the junior members of the team, sorting things after the game often fell to her. “Though in my defense, I’d have had a harder time trying to schedule it while you were in town. It was nothing personal. Timing just worked out better that week.”
He took their cards and turned his back on them. “And I better not see any nonsense about my humility in tomorrow’s paper!”
Harry stared at his mug. The details hovered at the edge of his tongue, ready for sharing. She’d given him the go ahead. “No reason in particular. Just considering. I thought it might be interesting for Teddy to see more of the world before he’s at Hogwarts. It’s supposed to be good for children to travel while they’re young.”
In front of him, Malfoy didn’t look at anyone. He’d taken out a book—black header and white background, from what Harry could see—keeping only a slightly stooping posture all the while. This close, Harry picked up on something else. A cologne, maybe, or shampoo. It smelled expensive, somewhat minty. Harry followed it forward and stopped just before colliding entirely with Malfoy’s person. He tensed, but Malfoy didn’t turn around.
“I didn’t know it was you.” A thousand responses had come to mind, but Harry settled on that. “When I got your first memo. I didn’t know the CRAPI Department was yours. I thought it was Jenkins playing a joke."
When he stepped out of the Floo and into the Ministry Atrium, Harry almost turned right back out again. No fewer than five people had the latest Daily Prophet under their arms. Today’s cover story featured, in full colour, center of the page, a looping picture of Harry purchasing a Bounty bar from a news stand. Above it, in all caps, the headline said,
Harry scoffed. “It’s not like they’re subtle about it. Maybe a bit when I graduated the Training Program and got seated right between them—Robards had to have done that intentionally—but I think they went back to it when they realised I wasn’t going to interfere.”
“Please tell me you’re not going to leave that sopping cotton dressing gown sit there the whole time,” Draco muttered after a while, his feet pressing the discarded clothing away from him. Harry snorted.
He grabbed his wand and cast one spell, then another. Nothing. He looked back for the Deniden, but it had disappeared. He ignored the panicked thought brushing the back of his mind.
“No.” Harry held her gaze as he took a large bite of churro himself and spoke around it. “Can’t make it.”
“He’s with me,” Harry said, and there was only a quick meeting of eyes before that horrible hooking sensation reached into Harry’s stomach and sent them off. The trip lasted long enough for Harry to wonder what the hell he’d done that for. Maybe Robards—he’d need his support during the application process for the Spanish Ministry.
Harry frowned at the chess board. Not many good moves. “It’s no good if I start making exceptions, that’s a slippery slope right back to where I started.”
Harry stopped listening. Malfoy’s hands struggled with the applesauce container, once he went for it. His fingers kept slipping from the aluminum foil, interrupted by the small tremor they had. Harry reached over to take it, opened it, and offered it back. Malfoy left it so long Harry almost just kept it.
Malfoy watched his progress. He swallowed. “Not… all the time. There’ve been a few moments where I—” He briefly gazed at Harry’s face. “Where one could possibly—” He sighed, heel reaching the peak of the hilltop. “Where I could forget for a little while. Just, be Draco Malfoy, conference attendee, not
"Good, because that's all you'll be eating," Ron said as he stirred the bubbling contents of a pot. "I only made enough for two."
Ginny had never seemed to share the full extent of Ron’s disdain, though she’d teased Harry enough about his Auror robes and declined most of the Ministry’s parties. Then again, if Harry were being honest with himself (and he was a few drinks in by this point, and abandoned by
Harry turned to him, green eyes visible now and piercing the sizable region of Draco’s chest that he’d occupied for days. “Oh.”
There were a few other groups, a lot of people in their late twenties, like him. Mostly friends, he guessed, based on their appearance. Then again, his research had said work attire here tended toward the casual side of things. So who knew, maybe they were meeting for work.
Harry nodded back. His smile turned his mouth just so, the way it did when he was thinking. Draco’d seen it last week, at the end of the night. When Harry, almost as close he was now, had spoken into the limited air between that he had only just realized Draco had some height on him.
“It makes sense,” Malfoy said, voice quiet. “Anonymity is a powerful thing.” For a moment, he let his hands rest on Harry’s chest, a light pressure, dancing against him. They dragged down, then pressed harder, and Malfoy used the leverage to push Harry back a step. “But there’s a difference between Harry Potter catching a break and Draco Malfoy getting one.”
Flemings’s ridiculous eyebrows shot up, exaggerating his already comical, if worn, features. “Everything. He
“It’s kind of funny,” he said, as they waited in queue for bacon sandwiches. “The only time we go in together is your last week at the condo.” She and Ron were moving out that coming weekend. He’d helped them pack. It seemed an appropriate penance to him, even if they argued it was what friends normally did.
“Five galleons says the view is shite,” Malfoy said, casting a cooling charm over them both. Harry wiped his skin where it itched from sweat, the dancing touch of Malfoy’s magic.
Ron nodded, turning off a sounding timer. “We put your books and things in the hall closet. Figured you’d get to it whenever you came back, decide where everything goes. We were going to shop around this weekend to replace some of the furniture, actually, but you could come along since you'll be around. Be our peacekeeper in the homeware stores and all that, relationship traps that they are."
“Please form a line: form a line please. Families to the right. Individuals to the left.” A MACUSA officer amplified his voice as he walked around the group, his uniform navy blue and militaristic. “Welcome to the United States. Please form a line.”
“I didn’t know half of this stuff! I mean, the things I did know weren’t great, but they didn’t rise to this.”
On Friday, before heading home, Harry had to stop back at his desk to pick up some of his other qualification materials for the interview in Spain. Definitely not to see if Malfoy was still in (he wasn’t).
When the cashier heard their accents, he took it on himself to educate them about the place. “This city has always been a mix of magical and No-Maj communities.” The cashier’s beard was as thick as his head and coloured in long rainbow stripes braided together. He had a few lip piercings that clinged together as he spoke. “San Francisco’s a city of industry, you know, and things always get weird this close to so many power lines above and below ground. Especially with the network of trains we’ve got now, and all the mobile phones and interwebs flying around. Messes with the ley lines and natural energies.” He packed their bags up into some cloth totes with the store’s logo painted on it.
Harry looked over the schedule. The first day offered nothing but a series of lectures. He made an effort for the first session, powered by the caffeine rushing through him. He was doodling by the second half of it, and the session that followed. He spent most of the third reviewing case notes he had placed among the conference binder’s pages. The DMLE was using them for trial next month and had a number of questions about how to interpret his chicken scratch handwriting. The other attendees around him were rapidly taking notes—he didn’t have to worry about his own frequent writing giving him away.
International portkey travel to the United States occurred only from a few designated, pre-approved locations and times for easier MACUSA monitoring. He was scheduled for the one out of Ditcheat at eight p.m. Since he’d been there before, he Apparated to the designated point, grabbed dinner at the nearby inn, and took his time wandering from the square to the portkey location. His lungs filled from deep greedy breaths of the fresh air as he walked, the energy of a new destination already buzzing in his limbs. When he reached the designated tree in a nearby field, he could see the crowd of people further out mingling around a large, overturned umbrella. He scanned for the familiar blond head of hair, but Malfoy wasn’t there yet.
“That’s brill.” Harry frowned as he lost his first piece. Ron’s little pawn gave it a savage blow. “You’ll have to let me know when those get set, I’ve got an Auror or two I’d be glad to get blue-handed.”
“He felt very clever at the store,” Hermione said, walking over to hand them each a drink. “I was partial to a literary one myself, but he convinced me we needed to have your interests in mind.” The pair of them shared a quick look.
“Great.” Draco started down the road. A worn fence stood a few feet high on either side of him, wrapped with barbed wire. At the top of each vertical pike hung a skull. Cows, in some cases. An elf. At least two coyotes. Several he would not acknowledge as human. At the end of the fence, the Deniden sat, its feet curled into the empty sockets of a thestral skull. The tips of its wings glowed soft and golden in the dark and reflected off its milky white scales.
At the end of the dancefloor, near the base of the stairs, he caught a breath of mint. It stood out, delicate, against the heady musk of the dancers around him. Harry scanned the crowd for the nearly white-blond hair. Took a few steps before he lost the trail. When Harry turned around, though, he froze. A man in Malfoy’s clothes stood where the dancefloor met the stairs, arms crossed as the length of him leaned against the wall. His face, though, was rounder: the same fringe falling in his eyes, but wavy, and a dusty rose colour. Harry’s feet drew him forward. He meant to turn away, to step by. He saw too late that he’d reached out, his hand hovering, reaching, between them.
Harry had just nodded at her, his arms squeezing both of them tighter. She nodded back, and the three of them had stayed there until sunrise. The Burrow was quiet when they returned. They put Ron to bed. Hermione showered. Harry had breakfast. And then Harry went to his training, and the days repeated themselves.
“She’s right,” Ron added, directing the various takeout boxes toward the bin. “I imagine it’ll keep the office plenty busy to work through all the matters you’ve put together so far. You can leave the rest with ‘Mione’s office, they can close it out.”
“Harry?” Harry looked up from where he had been watching the dance of Draco’s fingers. “Can you do it? I…”
The man blinked up at him. “Good morning! Welcome to the Best Coast, gentlemen. First time in the city?”
“I think this fabric is nicer than anything I own. I’m supposed to wear it around my neck?” Harry pulled it out and stretched his arms wide to dangle it this way, then another. “Or do I cross it over like a shawl?”
He threw it back with a little curve. "How are you? Has the Christmas crisis of 2007 been resolved?"
Harry narrowed his eyes at Ron, something clicking into place. "Be there to supervise, you mean, if that doormat is any sign of your decorating sense.” He looked back at Hermione. “Did she really take that old thing we used to have out there? I nearly thought I had the wrong apartment. The bookshelf still had some life in it at least, but the doormat’s nonsense."
At the Auror pub nights Malfoy never went to, Harry had asked at some point what exactly the Central Repository for Accurate and Probable Information was. Jenkins and Flemings (among others) considered this question hilarious.
. It doesn’t change anything. Who I am doesn’t go away because you don’t want to see it. Trust me, I’ve tried.” He took another step away. “Willful blindness got me where I am. So yes, you, all of us, need to keep an eye out. All these sessions, they’re meant to highlight the power of observation, being seen. Wealth hid my family and so many others for years as they supported the Dark Lord, blood supremacy. What power does the Ministry have against ancestral homes larger than its office building, ages away from anyone or anything? There’s no accountability there. But things are changing. With Muggle technology and our magical abilities, we can see so much more. What’s a Knockturn Alley with recording charms? An estate in Wiltshire with overhead infrared scans?” Catching his breath, Malfoy shook his head.
Something about the answer drew Malfoy even closer. Harry could feel the heat off him now, the press of his thighs slotting into the inside of Harry’s knees. “The deal they made with my mother, you mean.”
She tossed her hair back, shrugging just so, as if her sex life were some sort of mystery between them instead of the aperitif for every weekly lunch. "Maybe. But I wasn’t going to turn down a little more time with you, was I?” She filled her plate with water biscuits and cheese. “Where would you be, if we had cancelled, anyway? Stuck alone in that twee little office of yours?”
“And when you came back from San Francisco, did you go through any kind of check with the local Healer? For potions, Imperius and the like?”
They did not. They were in a shining wooden one from New Orleans. The crowd followed them in, forced them close, but Harry kept Malfoy’s attention on him at first, describing how jazz lingered in the air down there, how everything was amplified, the heat in the food, the strength of the drinks, how every laugh came from deep down in your chest. Harry tried to pay attention to San Francisco, once they were moving. The crowds continued to be young but posh looking. He counted two Starbucks. But his attention kept darting to Malfoy and his impressions of things. What made his eyes widen or his mouth quirk. It seemed like everything. They were far afield from London and Wiltshire: even more from the world that Malfoy had known. And he seemed open to what it had to offer him. His eyes were light, reflective.
“Yeah.” Harry watched Malfoy put two sugars in his cup, then lean in toward him. He wondered if Malfoy had been aware of this morning’s accidental cuddling as well. Harry had definitely woken with his nose brushing the other’s hair, his breath very near that little collection of birthmarks again. He needed to speak with Robards about future rooming situations.
“It’s nothing very serious, but Teddy’s had some of the children teasing him lately. He won’t talk to me about it, but his teachers have reached out to me and noted he’s not quite as spirited in class as usual.”
Harry remained at the top of Kite Hill. People tried to walk their dogs in the area, even this late, though something in Harry’s expression seemed to make them wary and turn back the way they came.
“You have pets?” Harry asked, as they wandered through a set of organic foods for Kneazles. Malfoy nodded, picking up several varieties.
“You’ve been around a few weeks now. Your blinders can’t be that good.” She took another step to stare closer at him when he remained silent. “When they fight, Harry. Where would Ron sleep after they fight, if I took your bed back? Surely you’ve heard them.”
“I really hate this.” Harry nodded in penance, letting his mouth wander and press at his right shoulder, the juncture of his neck and the birthmarks there, then back, repeating his attention on the other half of his body.
Harry wiped off his hands on his jeans. “I don’t know. And—” He dug for it, the other reason, past the grey eyes, the lingering taste of him somehow identifiable despite a tangy beer. “I’ve also got a case at the office I’ve been putting off. I think it might be better for me to wrap that one up before I leave. To make it a clean break.”
Malfoy smiled, warm even in the overcast light. “Exactly. You become an unknown. Wear a disguise.” He inclined his head, glancing at Harry’s Glamour-lightened hair. “Work in the dark. Operate out of something that seems like something else.”
“It’s okay being here when there’s a crowd of us, but honestly? I feel like I’m getting a bit old for this. Like—” He gave the bartender a bright smile until he wandered off, then he pressed back into Draco’s space. “—why am I paying so much for a drink I could make for a quarter of the price at home, where no one could see any of the embarrassing things it leads me to do?”
Harry swallowed down the black coffee. This morning’s sessions were all focused on ethics—the most important and most boring of topics. He flipped his folio to the appropriate page. Three hours to go.
“Next!” A grim looking man with salt and pepper hair waved Malfoy forward. Malfoy handed over his Auror identification, and the official gave it a scan and entered into the system before Harry caught a brief flash of red. The official waved over one of the officers. Harry strained to catch what they were saying, but heard only enough to understand Malfoy was being asked to step into another room. At least Robards had not been exaggerating. Harry watched them walk Malfoy away, then stepped up to the same official.
Taking in the relaxed curve of Malfoy’s shoulders, the ease around his eyes, Harry nodded. “Seems tough, to sit around staring at nothing for days. By yourself.” Harry clasped his hands back together after using them for emphasis. “Again, not for me.”
Harry shook his head and pulled back the edges of the tissue paper. He shifted in his seat when the green cashmere came into view and thumbed the light fabric between his fingers. Draco sucked the inner side of his lower lip between his teeth to keep himself in place.
“Whatever you think of my theory, Pans, we must agree to disagree. Having Harry’s friendship is already more than I deserve.”
Beneath his fingers, Harry could feel Malfoy’s tongue twitching on the other side of his lips. The blond strands wrapped in Harry’s other hand spilled soft and liquid over his knuckles, his palm. This could be so good. Harry closed his eyes as well and dragged his fingertips down Malfoy’s mouth, his throat. Harry's hand settled over Malfoy’s fists between them. He needed a signal. Something to mark the transition.
Harry crowded him, the want rising at his fluster. “That’s the wonderful thing about travel. People everywhere else don’t care. They don’t know. We’re a footnote in their textbook.” Harry nodded to Vickie and the rest of the group, barely in sight now. “My first mission overseas, I sat in the meet up place for fifteen minutes before I realised I had to actually introduce myself to people because they wouldn’t just know my face.”
The conference tote hovered in his line of sight, and after a moment of debate, Harry picked that up as well. Might as well do some review while he was out.
“If dying would bring them back, I would do it.” Draco’s voice had been low, until now. A confession. Here it rose clear, toneless. “I looked for the spells, anything in the books the Ministry let us keep. But it won't. And I couldn't give them a life in Azkaban—my mother handled that. Even the Dark Mark’s nearly gone. It's almost worse, without—” Draco’s body coiled inward, his legs drawing up and in. His voice was muffled, thick and low. It wasn't soft: it was aching.
At one point, the same sandy haired bloke from earlier that morning stepped up to Malfoy and the dark haired woman at his side. Harry considered joining in, but his internal Hermione pointed out that if anyone asked for his opinion on a single thing that had happened so far, he wouldn’t have an answer. He packed up his food and headed back to the space. There was a happy hour planned for later that night. He needed to take in at least one of the topics if he had a chance of speaking with anyone.
When Harry stepped through the doors into the appointed conference room, he saw Malfoy seated near the middle of the first row.
“Have fun at the conference?” she asked, wiping some of her hair back off her face. It didn’t do much. He watched the strands bounce back into place, wild around her. She caught him staring and tilted her head. “Are computers going to take over the world, or whatever Robards feared?”
“Really?” Malfoy pierced him with his gaze, his posture lounging but his hands strung tight. “Then explain how it was me saving those cases for you and your expert team of Aurors.” He took a step closer.
Malfoy’s head arched around the doorway, a grimace stretching his already thin lips into a narrower line.
This was Harry’s chance to go to the conference without him. To get the time he needed to think things over. Malfoy’s name flashed in his mind, a hazy scribble on The List.
Harry nodded, fingers digging into his palms. His hand still felt the press of Malfoy’s body against it. Harry shook it out.
The water slowly stilled. In the quiet that followed, Harry caught onto some murmuring, followed by a rise in voices. He looked behind him toward the door. Hermione and Ron were home. Carefully, Harry wrapped himself in a towel and Vanished the contents of the tub. The voices grew louder, angry. Whatever peace he’d managed in the bath left him, replaced with a sense of unease. He walked toward the second door, which led out into the main room. He stilled, catching glimpses of their voices still, but the sounds disappeared once he crossed to the hall. He paused in the kitchen to toss his To Do List in the bin, then entered his room. Without tripping for once, he stepped around the boxes he still had not unpacked and collapsed into bed, willing sleep to come. The conference started to creep back to mind, but he pushed it aside.
When they stopped out of the shop, Harry leaned over and said, “You think it’s all those iPhones or the weed that’s interfering with his Apparition?”
Draco’s hands slid around Harry’s neck and shoulders until he could press his face into Harry’s hair. The lithe body in Harry's arms grew heavier, loose. Harry walked backwards in small steps, guiding Draco along with him. He was careful not to let them press too far apart. The forming intimacy relied on contact, like Draco would remember himself without the warm body against him. To take him out of himself. Harry flicked out the light. Then, at the bed, Harry crawled back on to it, but took Draco’s hands before he did, leading him around and under the sheets. Draco laid on his side, and Harry curled around him, pulling him back into Harry’s chest.
Draco settled his arms in front of him so he could interlace his fingers. “This is it. Bachelor’s Eve.” Draco cleared his throat. “Just the two of us left.”
“This is not the Gryffindor common room. You have a guest.” When Harry didn’t respond, Malfoy continued: “‘Modesty is a virtue’? I mean you should get dressed in the bathroom.”
Steeling himself, he walked through the doors, gazed fixed forward. He breathed through his mouth, avoiding any possible hint of mint he might catch. That could make the next week or however manageable. Jenkins and Flemings weren’t at their desks yet, and he was glad for that small mercy. Might be worth coming in early more often just for that.
“Actually, there is,” he said, turning to face them. They looked stunned at his address—he'd never spoken with them before—then recovered enough to get their quills and cameras ready.
Thirty minutes later, Harry convinced himself to walk through the lobby again. Malfoy’s table sat empty, and he had already split the bed by the time Harry stepped into their room. Harry felt the familiar tingling of a stare between his shoulders when he closed the curtains. He kept his gaze averted, waiting until the lights were off before he dared look over. Malfoy seemed fixated on the book in his hands, a small Lumos glowing on the pages from his wand. Malfoy’s head and shoulders emerged from under a much plumper cover set than the one on Harry’s own bed, and Malfoy’s robe covered his arms, the oversized collar curled around his throat. He seemed comfortable there—a stark contrast to the uneasy study he’d made downstairs.
He began to pick up on Malfoy’s tenor. Something like words, a steady tone interrupted by the occasional breath, hummed through the wall. Like a chant. Harry leaned in further until his cheek flattened fully with the door’s cold surface. He cast a silencing spell on the air conditioner. In the ensuing silence, the words struck him clearly.
He couldn’t look at his arm. It had to be dissolving, on fire, the way his nerves screamed along his bones. He struggled to breathe, to open his eyes. This had been a terrible mistake. He should’ve stayed asleep. He should’ve stayed in the damn Manor.
Harry re-read the note, glancing by habit now over to Malfoy’s desk. Empty again. On either side of him, Jenkins and Flemings leaned back in their chairs to stare at him.
Potter didn’t speak for a while after that. He cast an Aguamenti to fill the glass, and they took turns getting their fill. The fire was mostly embers by the time he said anything else. “They’re not murder houses.”
) outing for furniture shopping with Ron and Hermione. The cover stories still kept coming. The first week had featured a series, each day recounting a different case he’d been a part of with International Operations: the recent arrests of political agitators in Spain; a Mer trafficking ring based near Florida in the United States; a cell of Dark wizards trying to resurrect ancient Mayan leaders from tombs in Honduras; a group of MagiScientists along the E.U.-Russian border coordinating to spell humanitarian aid packages to amplify hostile emotions in whomever opened it. The Prophet failed, of course, to address the crucial fact that Harry had not been the sole or even primary person on these investigations—they had all required teams of at least five other people. He remained grateful the Prophet’s circulation did not extend beyond the U.K.’s borders. The other Ops members would never let him live it down. The next week had covered some of the unsolved cases he’d been kept home for, ending with his previously least favourite story:
“Auror Potter.” Harry looked over at Robards’s assistant, smiling near his elbow. “Head Auror Robards would like to see you this afternoon, if you’ve the time. 2 p.m. works best.”
Harry looked down at the files, the CRAPI Department typeface visible across their fronts. “I mean, the hard documentation is, but—”
“You think my gift is lovely?" Harry asked. Draco looked over his face, the openness there the same combination of enticing and torturous as ever.
Harry pushed through a lingering dream about flying to open his eyes. The bed had again been divided. The sheets were drawn, but the bed for Malfoy was empty. Harry sat up and strained to hear anything beyond the loud hum of the air conditioning unit. Once his eyes adjusted, he stared down the hallway reflected in its mirror. The bathroom door suddenly opened, and Malfoy stepped out in a long sleeve shirt and pyjama bottoms, a towel scrubbing into his hair. Within a few minutes, Harry could feel the curl of heat and humidity reach his feet.
They paused at the threshold to Harry’s bedroom. Harry’d returned to the master after Ron and Hermione moved. There was plenty of space now to navigate around the bed. But they’d explore that later. Harry squeezed Draco’s arms through the dressing gown he’d put him in, his breath ghosting over the cloth collar to graze the small hairs curled at the back of Draco’s neck. Passing Draco’s side, Harry leaned forward to swing open the bathroom door, then led them through the vanity as well. He’d kept the lights off for now and, before Draco’d arrived, drawn the curtains over the small half-circle windows near the ceiling.
Stretching out his next drag, Harry considered where he could bugger off to tomorrow to avoid further conversation. If anything, the weekend had confirmed his instincts from years back: Malfoy was Not His Problem and too much of a bother regardless. Like it mattered what Harry thought of his penance. Like it made a bit of difference. Over the last few days, Malfoy seemed like he might have understood that. That their lives weren’t defined at seventeen, whatever England might have to say about it.
Given the extent of the misdoings, he tried to contemplate how the DMLE had not picked up on the issues during their case prep. And then reviewed Malfoy’s sixth folder. The file was dedicated to the longstanding relationship and history between the two Aurors and one of the leading prosecutors for the DMLE—the same prosecutor that had taken their cases to trial. So working near Hermione in her department turned out to be a blessing in disguise.
“Colour me surprised.” Malfoy looked at him, face open with a flash of interest. “Two connections in twenty hours, you did listen to some of those sessions.” He turned his face back to the lighthouse. “No prisoners, you’re right. Though here, the tower isn’t functioning as a point of authority. At the centre of a circular prison, the tower is meant to be that, the ever watchful eye. The prisoners, exposed completely to its gaze, are supposed to look at it and assume a guard is always there watching them, to catch them in wrongdoing. And there is. They get caught often enough. Until eventually, you don’t even have to staff the tower. By then, there’s always someone there in the prisoners’ minds, holding them accountable. Remarkable, in concept.” Harry recognised this Malfoy, the one that appeared when addressing some of the speakers and other attendees at the conference. Someone different from the pompous boy he’d been at school, but bolder than the withdrawn man at the tip desk. Someone new.
Harry stared a moment longer, then said “right” because he couldn’t think of anything better. That case took a few weeks to solve, but the information had been spot on. The Monday after the case closed, he went right to Malfoy’s desk and hovered until Malfoy paused what he was doing.
Harry circled the furniture, arms swinging with his steps. “Moving is a big change.” He unbuttoned his jacket, and Draco followed the inches of skin that appeared. “I’ve been telling myself I’d move out of old Grimm for almost a decade, but who knows now? Thought turning thirty would cause some kind of panic or epiphany, but here we are.”
Malfoy hmm’d at that, but when Harry turned to look at him, Malfoy kept his gaze out and down. There were three seals now rolling in the surf. Harry asked: “And you think you’d like something like that? Is that what you mean?”
He pressed his forehead into the door with a slow exhale, cursing himself. He was being an idiot. Malfoy had grown up posh. That was probably just how he bathed. For hours. Luxuriating. Seemed like the kind of thing you did when you were rich.
Malfoy’s stern expression melted away into something softer. The edges of his mouth curled into a small smile. “I know. Robards told me you were coming.”
“How’s that?” Harry picked up a sparkly pom and tossed it between his hands. Malfoy gave him a look, and Harry added another couple poms, doing an alright job of juggling them.
“And that doesn’t bother you at all, does it?” Malfoy asked, pulling Harry back to the moment. “To work for an organisation that looked at my family at the end of the War and thought a few years of solitude on our family estate was punishment enough?”
It took two Dreamless Sleep to knock him out. Through the haze of the next morning, he ignored his deliveries pile and wrote a note to Pansy about where he was going and what had happened. Probably, it was nothing. Potter would be there or he wouldn’t, and the package would cease to be his problem in either case. But this way, at least, someone would notice he was gone. Someone that wasn’t his boss.
The grey eyes widened under the bright light of the shop, but Vickie interrupted the moment with a dismissive wave of her hands.
Draco snagged at the fingers tugging his shirt out of his trousers. The teasing look dropped from Harry’s face at whatever he saw when he looked up.
The St. Clair had hosted every Bachelor’s Eve since the beginning, the high ceilings and perpetually drunk clientele providing cover for their interhouse mix of post-War revelry, the unguilty celebration of a bunch of twenty-somethings being unwed and untied and young and alive. Until person by person, the members of their group settled down and stayed home, leaving only Draco and Harry now. And Pansy, “maybe,” whatever that was supposed to mean.
Harry took it and summoned over one of his bags as well. Draco pulled it from the air. The weight settled into his palms as the spell lifted. Much heavier than his gift to Harry.
“You tosser, there’s no typo, I can’t believe you!" He flashed his eyes up at Draco and made to pull the bag away, but Draco moved faster this time.
"First, you’re always welcome, obviously," Hermione said, leaning her head back over the couch to get a look at him. Her hair fanned with her in a wide wave of curls, and she had a smudge of red ink on her nose. “Second, it would never be a surprise if you told us when you were coming home.”
Pansy smiled. “Much obliged, Pots. Just for that, I’ll be sure to correct Charlotte: you’re not nearly as yuppie-looking these days as she said.” She kissed the air beside his cheek, took the bag, and disappeared around the bar, the sweetness of her perfume trailing in her wake.
He’d been looking at Harry’s hand. He looked up at his name. His eyes were still that lovely grey. Something unwound in Harry’s chest. Despite the defiant tilt of Malfoy’s head, he’d sucked his bottom lip between his teeth.
Closing his eyes, Draco listened to the space around them. That pulse he’d felt, the call to the dark, was gone. The walls and the floors weren’t silent, just steady. “So you’re fixing them?”
Harry waded back to the bar and traded his drink for a fresh one before exploring the rest of the floor. About half the place had convention attendees—everyone else appeared to be Muggles enjoying a drink. Passing the lift bank they’d arrived in, Harry crossed the other half of the space. The tables were lower, arranged for meals, but a contingent of the attendees were gathered at the far end near the windows. He recognised Malfoy’s blond hair among the crowd. Even against the other blonds, his was the lightest. Malfoy’s posture remained tall, distant but curved toward his companions. Open, almost. Harry scanned the group’s faces. Whatever conversation they were having, it was serious. All of them looked serious under their glasses. It looked quite posh compared to the Auror pub gatherings he kept dragging himself to. More civilised. Less anti-Malfoy. He joined some conversations on the fringes. Looked for anyone as disinterested as he was.
Malfoy scanned his face, then met his eyes and held them. “Remember what we talked about, at the happy hour? How the current evolution of policing, maintaining order, is surveillance? Well, how do you get around, accomplish things, in a system where everyone’s watching?”
“I do trust your judgment, Harry.” Andromeda stood and called for Teddy to come down. “But his problems will still be waiting for him when he gets back.”
“That’s Baker Beach,” the guide said, stepping beside Harry and the others that had remained in place. “And those are No-Majs, mostly. It’s a very liberated area, San Francisco, even the non-magical parts. Just the other day I was wandering to one of my favourite markets and stumbled on this whole carnival full of people in leather, if they were wearing much at all. Devices I haven’t seen since I studied Medieval History right there out on Folsom Street. These are incredible times, the new millennium.”
The media was not the only group eager to see him. He managed about ten feet at a time before a Department head wanted his opinion on some upcoming legislation, invited him to their next get together, or asked for an autograph (“For a friend, of course, Auror Potter”). Harry told them all to get in touch with his assistant, Ms. Crookshanks, who would
He blamed it on the novelty. Since the trials, Draco had seen Potter only once before. The lights in the Soho bar made it hard to see, but Draco felt Potter’s magic in the air. It filled the space, danced along the bodies that moved around him. Draco didn’t understand how Muggles couldn’t feel that power. Taste it, like Draco could. He nearly worked up the courage to approach him, after a few drinks. Potter’d testified for the Malfoys. They’d swapped saving lives. Surely they could share a drink in a Muggle pub. But he’d waited too long. From his corner, Draco watched Potter fall into the arms of a redhead too well dressed to be a Weasley, and too broad to be Ginevra. The pair left the bar together, and Draco returned alone to the Manor. A few months later, Potter would be gone.
Harry did a sweep around the room for a sign of Malfoy. Surely he wasn’t going to leave Harry entirely alone today. “I do. We’re in the bullpen together, though he mans the tip desk. I’m focused on field work mostly.”
“Mm.” She closed her eyes and took a deep breath. “I didn’t tell him, so much as he found out.” She groaned. “We went to Ginny’s game on Friday and everyone was there, so of course we all went out to dinner after, had some drinks. We got to talking, and Susan Bones was there. She’d heard about the offer and congratulated me, right in front of everyone! Said she hoped I’d take the job.” She grimaced, pausing for another sip.
So instead, he’d been sitting there alone for a good thirty minutes with his cloudy, terrible drink, eating too much seafood and counting the string lights over the bar instead of acknowledging that maybe, some small part of it could have been that at the time he’d ordered, he'd wanted to focus on something fun, anything at all really, rather than the tightening grip of anxiety that had been growing beneath his ribcage since he sat down. Like the sinking despair he’d filled with inching up to the peak of a roller coaster he rode once with Hermione for a Ministry-sponsored Muggle Education Outing. “It’s always worse before the drop,” she’d said.
"Why do you know what my trainee thinks about my office?" At her knowing smile, Draco ignored her for the entrance way. The wreath above it looked sparse this year, more twig than brush. Had they replaced the one Dean had accidentally set on fire the year before? Still looked better than the curtains nearby, though, which never quite recovered from the time Finnegan chundered on them on Bachelor’s Eve 2005. Or the carpet, with stains dating back to the first Bachelor’s Eve and fluids they’d all sworn never to speak of again.
The rest of the group made plans to check out the second floor. Harry waved them off with a vague promise he’d join them, then navigated around the bar until he found a stool along the outer wall. The large glass panes separating the interior from the street had been pulled wide open: if he reached out, he could touch the people passing by. The cardres of young men in little to nothing. The almost Amazonian drag queens with large, brightly coloured hair and shoes as tall as Harry. He had to hand it to this place—for being so constantly grey and cold, it shone with colours. He resisted the urge to touch, but leaned toward the street and let the cool wind wipe the flush from his face.
“Wait here.” Harry kept a hand on Draco all the while, but walked around him to mark out its edges, the various handles, the few steps up. Hoping that all his luck would meet him here in this moment and keep him from tripping into an unflattering death, he lowered first one foot, then the other, into the bath, the water lapping over his knees and making his own dressing gown cling instantly to his skin. “Okay, there’s a few steps you’re going to have to take before you reach the bath’s edge. Take my hands… Perfect… and now feel your way up and over. I’ve got a steady hold, I’ll catch you before you fall, I promise.”
Harry slowly stopped cleaning his lenses and put the pair back on. That red circled conference date, the one bit of freedom getting him through, seemed to mock him now. What kind of break would it be if
Where Barcelona and Madrid always smelled of spices, this place hummed with music. He stopped by a number of tents offering local art or jewelry, but a bit beyond that, a group took turns dancing to blasting hip hop. At the next corner, a musician played drums on a bucket to back up a recorded jazz track. Crowds of other tourists moved with him around the groups. He stepped along with them, pausing for the occasional local shop between chain stores. In one of the storefronts, he saw his reflection as others rushed past. Just one of a thousand faces looking in that day.
“We should… We should sleep,” Draco said, chest expanding every few seconds with breath. Harry nodded, even as his hand curled further into Draco’s nape, his toes curling at the sound Draco made in response.
When Harry and Malfoy got in the hotel lift from their floor later that evening, three other people followed. Harry settled into the corner, and Malfoy kept nearby, settling a few inches away. Harry could feel the small bounce of Malfoy’s leg as they went up the next ten floors.
“I think I’ll manage,” he said, already dipping a skewer with three bits of bread into the nearest cheese pot. “I can eat more than you’d think.”
“Back at last, Potter,” Auror Jenkins said, an arm resting over the wall separating their desks. Oh, the fun just kept on coming today. “Finally catch those political bastards down south? Took you a while.”
Draco flinched. “No thanks to you.” The words scraped out of his throat. Merlin, he needed some water.
“Weren’t going to—? You were right. I don’t know ‘Harry Potter’ at all.” Harry looked up at Draco’s tone, the disbelief on the blond’s face. “I’m not sure what I find harder to believe: that you were observant enough to see what they were doing, or somehow so completely altered you could ignore it.”
The dining area of the Matterhorn Restaurant, done up in pale wood and tiles with bright, hanging lights and country flags, reminded him of an Alpine lodge he’d stayed in during a disastrous attempt to learn snowboarding. A broad woman with a kind face showed him to the bar area, per his request, and seated him. She stepped away once he’d asked for whatever beer and fondues she liked best, he wasn’t picky.
The words echoed in Harry’s mind long after he slumped to the floor and released the spell. He caressed the wood between them, a terrible pulling reaching his heart through his spine. He should have been here sooner. He should have come after him right away.
The first time one of Malfoy’s memos had landed on Harry’s desk, he thought it was a joke from Jenkins—that Harry’s
Malfoy stilled his leg and ran a hand back through his hair. It had a natural wave when it was wet, Harry’d learned that morning. The blond used a charm to straighten it out like it was now.
Malfoy stared at Harry once he took them down the street and to a concrete barrier in the middle of Market Street. Cars and buses flashed close on either side of them, and the others around them pressed close as they spoke into their mobile or to someone nearby. It smelled like exhaust and cigarette smoke today.
Malfoy shook his head, arms crossing as he looked over the various kiosks and duty-free shops. “Not allowed to.”
“Even if I considered myself the most attractive, likeable bachelor in the world, Potter, there’s no universe in which I would lower myself to someone as willfully ignorant and indifferent as you’ve become. Now kindly piss off because incredibly, I’d rather look at anyone—any
The game lasted three nail-biting hours, and the Harpies clinched the win just so by capturing the snitch. Harry and Teddy watched the stands empty out from their box, then headed down to the pitch with the other families. Teddy ran over immediately to the children of the head coach, training broom bouncing with his steps. Harry watched him, the way he moved without self-consciousness, without hesitation. He was nine, and he acted it. No dark cupboards or chores or crazy prophecies making him older than he needed to be. Harry hadn’t entirely failed him as a godfather.
Harry left work early. Immediately, actually. One glance at his desk calendar and he was out the door, eyes burning with the effort not to stare Malfoy into the ground and demand he keep his arse home. Didn’t he know that Harry needed this more—it wasn’t just his credits, it was his
Harry drew them over to a narrow coffee shop they’d smelled from halfway down the block. There was a long queue, so they shuffled slowly toward the entrance. Malfoy read out loud from the sign that explained it was a former coat room for the theater beside it. “Is this whole city full of things that aren’t things? Like that house that’s a conference centre, and now this place?”
For a long while, Malfoy didn’t respond. The resounding bass and heat from the crowd started to press in the longer they didn’t speak. Only when the last drops of his drink disappeared down his throat did Malfoy finally curl his body further toward Harry’s, eyes cool this time. Blue, then red, under a passing strobe light.
Ron started banging around the pots, his back to Harry. "That's almost a month.” Ron tasted something from the largest pot, stirring up the fragrant herbs and tomatoes, then turned to wave the spoon in Harry’s direction. “Can you handle being home for that long?"
“Hey, Harry!” Above them, at the top of the stairs, Dave and Vickie waved as they walked, several others behind them. Harry felt Malfoy’s exhale near his neck, the clearing of the man’s throat. His grip tightened on the hair in his hand before letting it go. When he looked back, the round face and rosey hair were gone.
Malfoy’s hands paused, half into the bag, then carried on. “No need,” he said, his voice the same low timbre as before. "Only doing my job.”
Harry’s smile fell away. He pocketed his shells and stood. “Yes, I can see it now. ‘Saviour Blesses Public Park with the Chosen Ass, Encourages All to Embrace Body Positivity.’”
Guilt flashed in Hermione’s eyes before she looked down. “I didn’t realise the two of you had caught up when you were home.”
Malfoy’s gaze on him lingered. After a beat, he nodded. They took a few steps over the dirt and climbed the hill.
“Among other reasons.” They stayed there for a while, watching some of the other attendees step up and order drinks. Harry could see Malfoy’s gaze flickering over to one table in particular.
“Excellent, excellent. And Auror Malfoy? Hopefully he didn’t cause any trouble?” Harry let his chair fall back down to the ground. What a question.
“He was so upset, and I asked, ‘how could you possibly be so surprised, of course this would be the next step.’ I suppose I expected some of the feelings had simmered, you know, with my work in Magical Beasts. And I tried to explain how much more I could get done, the good we accomplish, being involved at that level. He couldn’t believe I was even considering it. ‘What about the Malfoys,’ he said, ‘and all the other deals that office has made?’ So I told him that if he couldn’t wrap his head around it, maybe he needed some space to think. Usually he’d just go in your room—sorry about that—but this time he up and left. Ginny came by to pick up a few of his things yesterday, and I’m not—” Her voice began to crack. “I’m not sure what's going to happen.”
Harry just needed to do a better job of showing Malfoy the way. His way. That would sort things. At least for their last day together, before reality beckoned them back (well, Malfoy at least). A parting gift from Harry before he embraced the life fully for himself abroad.
Harry rolled his eyes, leaning into the touch. He watched Draco’s Adam's apple bob as he swallowed. “That’s very presumptuous of you.”
“How about we get lunch tomorrow,” Harry said, digging his hands into his pockets. “If the bake sale can spare you.”
“The weather,” he would have told her. A reasonable response, given the icy sleet covering most of London’s pavement, but not his best lie.
Whatever energy had fueled Malfoy through his speech left him then, too. His back and knees curved as his body slouched.
Hermione curled her feet beneath her and listened while Harry summarised the offer from Minister Salas and Robards, his decision to go to the conference, and the events while he was there. By the end of it, she was frowning, her fist pressed into her cheek as she rested her head.
Draco pulled away from her fussing, hitting his back against the bar. “I can’t believe you, I have to work with her, and how am I supposed to do that now? And if Harry ever shows up, I reserve every right to toss his gift for you into the Thames.”
“I’m glad to hear it. I know it must have been unpleasant for you. So I decided to get you a token of my appreciation.” He flipped through the files beside him, then handed over a thin one. Harry checked it over, then opened it, reading and then re-reading the words.
Harry didn’t think much of it, taking another step. The couple inches Malfoy had on him were distracting. Not a marked difference, but he had to lift his head and arch his neck just so to meet the man’s stare head on.
The pamphlet said it would take anywhere from four to seven days for his credits to process. He’d reread it in the room, killing time before going to the portkey station himself. Up to a week in that office. Passing
Robards waved the response away, his other hand resting on the swell of his stomach. “I don’t care about the timing, that's no bother. This conference might be good for you, actually, given the shift of things. Cases are going to be a lot less on the ground in the future, and a lot more staring at screens and charts, if the policy papers are to be believed. Keen observation skills will still be important, but the means are changing. Not that it'll solve everything to sit on our duffs, but—" He whirled his hand in a small circular gesture, trailing off.
The shutter of a camera sounded as soon as he approached the Ministry. Of course it did. He always forgot about the damn papers when he came back after too long. Harry kept on past the coffee shop, his stomach making a mournful whine when he caught a sniff of freshly baked goods. The man in his periphery didn’t look like anyone from The Daily Prophet’s usual rotation, but Harry still lifted up his briefcase to block the next set of shots. They were always more enthusiastic the first few days after he returned. He'd told the team to hold off on publicly announcing the arrests, hoping he'd have a few days unnoticed, but it had been a flashy case the Spanish Ministry was eager to advertise as a swift success, even if they'd needed foreign aid to finish it.
“—I thought maybe we could just go to mine? Or yours? You’ve mentioned your place is close to here, haven’t you?”
“Fine,” Malfoy said, put out at the prospect. “I left my galleons in the hotel room. Remind me when we get back.”
“One bake sale at a time. A man has limits.” Ron looked at her, raising his eyebrows some for emphasis. While she lifted her eyes to the ceiling, seeking grace, she was smiling when she finally looked back at them.
Fair. He stood and crossed to the side of the wall directly opposite her and sat back down. He held his hands open for her to toss the ball. “And what about you?"
The Harry they returned to lacked any trace of his prior bravado. As well as any bathing or sense of duty toward the pile of takeout on the living room table and kitchen island.
“Ah,” Harry said, crossing his hands to avoid fidgeting. This is what people did. Friends did. He just needed to listen.
Draco sniffed. “How undignified.” He slipped for a moment, and he squeezed Harry’s fingers tightly between his own. “And a disturbingly fast answer. I’m going to pretend that you didn’t come into this with an alibi so readily at hand.”
“I can’t forget. Whatever the continent.” Harry reached for him and placed his hand over Draco’s chest. He'd seen now that it was smooth beneath the jumper. Unmarred. Slowly, giving him time to pull away, Harry pressed a kiss to Draco's shoulder.
Auror Flemings leaned over his own folded arms from the cubicle on Harry’s other side to ask: “Aren’t those the ones that wanted to blow up that Muggle sports thing? Like a World Cup match, but not Quidditch?”
He didn’t make it to the Ministry’s block before the photographers found him. There were two this time. He wanted to assume they’d been in the area to cover something important, like a visiting dignitary, but knowing his luck, they’d been waiting for him. Maybe someone at the Ministry was leaking his itineraries. He’d have to check in on that.
“Is that a Chelsea bun? I’d love some.” Draco blinked up at Harry’s hand reaching to the plate. At some point in Draco’s mini-crisis, Harry had crossed the room to him. After biting into one and holding it between his teeth, Harry took the tray from Draco’s hand. “Drinks,” he asked, settling into the middle of Draco’s couch.
Minister Salas’s offer came to mind. Looking over Ginny’s head to the door, where Hermione and Ron were hopefully making peace. The reasons to stay kept disappearing.
“Doing great. George is going to open another location up in Hogsmeade this year.” He watched Harry move another pawn and clicked his tongue. “I’m working on a truth bomb. Sort of a play on a Sneakoscope, 'cept it blows up and dyes everything within a few feet blue if someone’s telling a lie.”
The venue reminded him more of a converted home in Little Whinging than a government building or conference centre. The walls had been painted a butter yellow, and the white paint was flaking off the buttresses that lined the seams of the walls. The stairs to the upper floors were wooden and well-worn. He expected them to lead to a set of bedrooms rather than the main offices of the organisation putting the conference on, some local MACUSA affiliate. The other attendees didn’t seem as surprised. He assumed it must be a San Francisco thing.
Harry grinned and walked over to the kitchen island, baggage trailing behind him. "Hope you didn't make dessert. I overdid it at a panaderia near my quarters in Barcelona.”
near the top where she’d be sure to see it on her next visit. The items blurred and shifted, then arranged themselves into a clean column of evenly spaced lines.
“I considered leaving this morning. Before you woke up.” Harry looked up, and Draco gave him a flickering glance before turning to look down the hall. “Until I realised how suspicious it would look for me to show up alone and early for a portkey.” He seemed to mean it as a joke, but his tone failed to carry it. Harry helped himself to another piece of toast, considering.
“I don’t want you to misunderstand. What you saw, I—People make clear what they see every day, when they look at me. I’m the Boy Who Lived, in my own way. Just... instead of someone’s son or daughter. Instead of their parents.” At this, Harry tried to roll over, but Draco wouldn’t let him, his spine stiff and unyielding.
Malfoy Disapparated the moment they landed in Ditcheat. It was raining heavily, and a stream of voices casting Impervius sounded around Harry. He just sighed. It felt appropriate. Cathartic. He waited for the lingering remains of the crowd to disperse, then removed his Glamour. He dug his glasses out of his pocket and put them back on.
Malfoy looked at him and inclined his head to concede the point. “It does seem rather like something you’d come up with.” This was followed by a small smirk, and Harry squeezed his hands to keep them to himself. “Though the guide said this was the third lighthouse to be built on this coast. I have to imagine those people, coming onto this land and view for the first time, were rendered a little speechless.”
Harry’s eyes fluttered closed for a moment before he reached down to remove Draco’s fingers. “None of that. Yet, at least.” He lifted the hand to his mouth and pressed a slow, wet series of kisses to each knuckle. “Your turn.”
Harry leaned on the back of Pansy’s former chair and took in what remained of the food spread. The suit he wore showed of much better quality than usual. Draco’s fingers still tingled with the urge to fix Harry’s tie.
By nightfall, the Ministry package was all that remained. Waiting so long was a risk—who knew what that place looked like at night—but going during the day had been no walk, either. He’d take his chances.
“We’re going to Kite Hill, you’ll love it. Great views, and it’ll sober us up a bit.” Dave patted Harry’s shoulders. “Oh, Draco! You’ve got to come, too.”
He cast the same charm on himself once the sun began to set. There were still blocks to go before he reached the restaurant, and the air had gotten sharper on his face and hands. Another benefit to life in Spain: significantly warmer weather.
Draco turned to him, intrigued, but Harry’s face had disappeared behind a deep drink from his glass.
of all people, couldn’t get much worse), even if Ginny had been bothered, Harry wouldn’t have noticed.
“Potter,” he shouted. The skulls wrenched free of their posts and moved forward in a jagged line through the front door of the main house. A loud snapping rang behind Draco, and he crouched just in time to miss the Do Not Enter sign flying swiftly past his head. “That almost hit me, you arsehole!”
Harry gave her an equally cheeky smile in return. “So you told Ron you’re not going to The Burrow for Christmas?”
Harry remained as he was, bent over the side of the bed, while he considered. The physical distance had to go, if his memories from the night before weren’t completely bollocksed. Harry lay back out on the bed, then turned onto his side to face the windows.
“I’m sorry, Potter—the bloody light is broken and I was too focused on improvising for my shower this morning. I forgot about the lock. And I guess I assumed you weren’t such a heathen you’d barge right in.” Malfoy ran water over one of the hanging hand towels, then muttered a charm over it before pressing it into Harry’s hands. The cold cloth instantly sent a shiver through him, followed by relief. Harry sighed.
That could not be what this was about. Harry lifted a shoulder. “It was fine. Nothing eventful. Lots of surveillance theory.”
Draco nodded eventually, steps taking him to the drink cart in the corner. “Certainly.” He shook himself back to the present. “And do make yourself at home.” At the suggestion, Harry winked and stretched wide, sliding an arm around the back of the couch.
Except apparently, Potter had moved. The desert that enveloped him overflowed with dried brush and towering cacti, patches of small orange flowers and darker orange outcrops of stone. The mailbox had no box at all this time: just a sign that warned
She threw her purse on the nearest barstool. “Zero. That's how much I care.” She looked over the platter and array of hors d'oeuvres, the people pressing in against their few reserved seats. “Where’s Pots? Don’t tell me he bailed when he heard about everyone else.”
“Hey, Malfoy,” Harry said, raising his voice to carry around the bathroom door and down the hallway to their bed. The bathroom fan was loud, but Harry made out the familiar tones asking ‘What?’ a few seconds later.
“Here you go. Sure it’s just you that’s going to eat all of this? I’d imagine just a few scraps of bread could fill you right up.” The woman—the owner, he’d learned—set out a pot of oil and two more with cheese, followed by an artful display of meat and bread. The scents warmed him down to his bones.
“Listen, whatever it looked like, it wasn’t bad. Dark magic—” Potter grimaced, then started again. “Things like hateful feelings, acts of malice, even just a selfish disregard for other people—they leave something behind, like a mark or a scar. It can be on the land, or objects. Even people. I mean I’m sure at the Manor—” He stopped again. Draco kept his face neutral, even as its long marble corridors framed his vision, and Potter carried on. “Anyway. Ever since the war, I can just… feel it, that lingering. And those places, they can’t move on while that imprint remains.”
“Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go,” he cried, circling the kitchen. Harry caught him on the second lap and tucked him under his arm.
Malfoy adjusted the shoulder line of his Auror robes. “Yes, well. I wasn’t going to help anyone hiding away in Wiltshire.”
A few months passed before another late night, another unsolved case, led to another distinctive memorandum in Harry’s inbox. That time, he didn’t open it. He walked the distance between their desks, set his elbow on one of Malfoy’s paper towers, and waved the memorandum until—for the first time in years—he stared into the light grey eyes of Draco Malfoy. The colour matched the bags set below them. It shocked him into a few seconds of silence.
“Come now,” he said quietly, rubbing circles into her back. It always worked with Teddy. “Ron will come around. He always does, in the end. It's just... a rough spot. Something he'll need to consider for a bit, once he's calmed."
Malfoy shook his head, watching a couple of cars get into an aggressive honking match with distaste. “Not in particular.” When Harry didn’t say anything, Malfoy added: “It’s been years since I’ve left the country. The last time we went anywhere worth shopping from, we—” Malfoy shook away whatever thought he had and said instead: “I don’t have anyone specific in mind.”
She waved that off. “Please, we both know those anonymous owls are ninety-nine percent hogwash. He did his house arrest. Doing all that manual labor should probably count as extra punishment. I can’t imagine having to read that much public nonsense and gossip.” Her next gesture almost sent the yoghurt carton flying again. Harry shrugged. She was well and truly going now. He’d been gone too long. Things were clearly building. “And did they have to give his Department such a ridiculous name? ‘The CRAPI Department,’ honestly. It’s at least unkind to the public.”
“Thanks for not giving up on me,” he said, pulling the blanket up around her. She seemed small again, in the middle of all their things, the bed meant to fit her and Ron together. She smiled at him as her eyes fluttered closed.
“You’re having me on: they do not,” Harry said, stepping a little closer to squint into the darkening distance.
“You can always pick out the gunners at these things, can’t you? Five bucks says they have a question after ten minutes or less.” He nodded his head toward the front row. Malfoy was still in his seat, front and centre, though a dark haired woman with similarly sharp features had taken a seat beside him. Malfoy had a few to go cups around him again, like the night before at the lobby.
It had been his compass for almost six years. He looked over “Destiny,” the events themed around him. Not everything had to go.
His observations of Malfoy’s habits after that were just a product of their proximity, really. Malfoy’s desk sat just to the left of the entrance to the bullpen, when you walked into it. Harry couldn’t help if it was always there in his periphery as he came and went. And over time, passing the same bit day to day, one would be bound to notice little things (well, not
“The lighthouse is partly keeping the peace, watching the sea for dangers, of course, but it’s also a sign of comfort. The fishermen caught in a storm, the swimmers along the coast. They want to think that someone’s looking out for them. Will notice when they’re in trouble. Which is why they actually do keep it staffed around the clock.”
“Potter,” Flemings said, slapping Harry on the back. “You’re a bit of alright. We don’t care what any of the other Aurors say. We know at the end of the day you’re one of our own.” Harry schooled his face to keep back the twist of disgust his mouth longed to form.
“You can piss off now, Malfoy.” Potter’d leaned back in the chair, the heels of his hands pressed hard against his eyes.
"And I've told you,” Harry said, pulling away to grab his wheeled baggage. “This is the best way to avoid any unwelcome surprises." That, and nine times out of ten, he forgot to ring ahead. Once a case was solved, he closed out any and all loose ends before facing the trip back to England. So, his return remained as much a surprise for himself as for them. Seemed fair, on the whole. As Harry shut the door, Ron waved off the remark and crossed the large open room to the kitchen.
“Not all of it. Sharon, the owner, lives on the first two floors. The third is rented to a pair of uni students. I’ve got the top.” He waited for Harry to pass through the gate, then locked it behind them and led him through the dead garden plants to the entrance and up the stairs.
She scowled. “Yes, I can see how Draco Malfoy riding the Chosen Dong would blow the Earth’s natural alignment or whatever, launching us all into the moon.” She stood at his sigh, ignoring the few eyes her heated statement garnered. “Well, if that is all, I am actually leaving you. I’m meeting Charlotte shortly, and I’m already late because I’ve indulged you enough as it is.”
“Wait, Pans.” Draco stood as well, cornering her between the bar and their chairs. None of the several scenarios he’d hypothesized for the evening accounted for her absence. The pit in his chest nearly gutted him as it returned in full force. “You’re not leaving. You can’t.”
Harry nodded. He spoke next in the same quiet whisper Draco had used earlier, his free hand reaching for the knot of Draco’s tie. “You’re welcome. We should’ve gotten you one back when you graduated, but.” Harry’s thumb wandered over the dip in the fabric and brushed against the skin above Draco’s collar. Another breath, and the finger pressed further before dipping slightly into the space between shirt and skin.
Draco didn’t say more than was necessary throughout the afternoon. He followed Harry’s lead through the warehouse full of Muggle arcade games; the science museum’s gift store; the bird-laden pier leading to a collection of sun-bathing seals. At points, his hand curled into the bend of Harry’s arm. If Harry looked at the hand, or looked at Draco while he did it, the hand would disappear. But after a while, it would find its way back. At each withdrawal, Harry could steady himself. He’d offered Draco the out, the mindset to another life. He couldn’t make him take it.
It felt, for a moment, like the ground had gotten even softer and his right side was sinking slowly into the mud. The raised voices from the other day lingered in his mind. He’d spent the three days after mostly confined to work and his room. He took a few steps toward the kids, almost groaning when it didn’t change the pressure he felt on his chest.
“Yeah, yeah,” he laughed, taking his time to collect it. He trailed her for a while after, noting how her arms had firmed up in the last year. He kept himself out of punching range.
At the doorway, Draco braced his legs on either side of the frame and resisted the pull. He could see Potter now. His dark-haired figure faced Draco, but he focused downward, his body bent forward. His hands disappeared into the rippling surface of another circle. It looked like oil, dark and viscous, and it had stained up Potter’s arm and neck. Around him, the tendrils placed their collected items at the circle’s center. The items sank at first. After a minute, though, they sank only partly. Then they stopped sinking at all.
“Well, I’m glad to hear it. Mostly.” She gave him a brief look of disapproval before setting out in front of him. “And I’ll catch up with you at home.”
Harry laughed—the brilliant one that arched his neck and rang deep between his broad shoulders—and Draco was glad for it. Otherwise, his slightly shaky hands would give him away as he lifted off the box top.
“Until he told you there was no difference.” She phrased it like a question, but it wasn’t. He frowned at her.
Harry took his glasses off and cleaned them to avoid knocking things off every surface in swinging distance. "But couldn’t he just wait for the next one?”
“You took the Mark, Malfoy. No, wait, that’s not, I’m not saying that to punish you. I told you it can happen to people, too. The circles and the hands—they’re meant to pull out the dark in these places. And it worked, in case you hadn’t noticed.”
Malfoy kept with him as Harry navigated the crowds, and he stopped when Harry did to pull out a local map. Too many Muggles for a Point Me spell, he figured. The man didn’t say anything until they stepped through the large glass doors that led out of the building. It emptied them onto a cement pavement near the water. A large bridge passed overhead, and the air felt frigid, briney, under an overcast sky. Harry could feel Malfoy staring at him.
Harry let his hand slide down around the door handle. Malfoy hadn’t locked it the other day. In whatever state he’d returned in, he might not have locked it now. He tried to turn it, breath held tight. The door knob stopped: locked.
“It’s Potter, isn’t it?” In trouble, clearly, though Merlin knew what the fuck Draco was supposed to do about it.
“You know how highly I think of you, Auror Potter. You’re an invaluable member of our team, incredibly perceptive, and relentless in finding the truth. But if all you have to give me to defend Auror Malfoy is documentation he provided you, I’m afraid I have to move forward with investigating these charges.”
He almost skated over the snake. He stopped short, just barely. It coiled in the middle of the lane around the limp body of a jackrabbit. Then the image shifted. The creature that replaced it didn’t react to Draco’s string of curses. It just stared at him, pale eyes unblinking. Its scaled body shifted colours like an opal in shades of salmon, mint, and sapphire. White wings rested against its back.
His hands were numb by the time he stepped into the hotel lobby, even after the warming charms, and he considered picking up some tea from the lobby cafe when he saw Malfoy’s curled figure at a table in the corner. Harry moved closer to a wall to get a better look at him. Several to-go cups and half-eaten pastries sat on the table. He had the same book as earlier, open now, though he wasn’t reading it. Malfoy pushed his fringe out of his eyes and observed the crowds going in and out. He seemed to shrink if any of the other patrons moved too close to him or a conversation grew too loud.
Malfoy busied himself zipping up his jacket, cheeks flushed from the cool wind and (more likely) embarrassment.
The wooden stairs had faded centers, worn from years of trodding feet stripping the varnish. As they passed the breakaway to the third floor, a television blared loudly. It faded once they reached the stoop of Draco’s place. In the quiet, only the sound of their breaths and Harry’s rustling bags, it took Draco two tries to get the door.
They dropped in a windowless hall of beige tiles and walls. A large clock on the wall made the time difference clear. It was only a little after noon here. Malfoy staggered forward, having been off kilter by Harry’s pulling when the journey began. Harry caught him before he could hit the ground, and his fingers registered the softness of the jumper and warm body underneath. Malfoy’s eyes flashed when their gazes crossed again, and he pulled himself free of Harry’s grasp.
“Me?” Draco tried to sit up, but his body refused. He settled for a stern gaze. “You’re the one with the murder houses and dark rituals. My assumptions are very, very normal.”
This one had lived a life. His dirty clothes were nothing to the necklaces that wound his neck or the rings that covered his fingers. They ranged from thick to thin, bone white to black and purple, matte to shining. Ochre lines ran along his skin beneath from the rings’ edges, peaked past his collar and sleeves. The shadows beneath his eyes were nearly as dark.
“What… are you doing here?” The wings began to flutter. Loose sheets of paper fell free of Draco’s desk and arced in the air. Pens rolled off his side table. Then the Deniden’s eyes glowed emerald green, and Draco knew.
After a long breakfast and a Pepper Up potion, Draco rang his boss to request extra deliveries for the next two days. Policy dictated three consecutive delivery attempts before returning a package for nondelivery. It did not require that the package be the first one out.
Malfoy gave him a side eye, then piled the napkin bits together. A few more people were making their way into the bar.
“Do you have any clue how impossible it is to hear you in there over that noise? And I won’t have you yelling at me.” Malfoy’s eyes flitted over to the mirror, Harry’s reflection there, then away. Malfoy switched sides to lean against the furthest edge of the doorframe. “You were saying?”
Malfoy did roll his eyes then. “Nevermind.” He fell into pace a few steps behind Harry, content for now, it seemed, to let Harry take the lead. Malfoy said nothing when the front desk asked how many keys they wanted for their single room, or on the lift up to their floor. When he walked into the hotel room itself though, and through the short hallway to the sole king-sized bed, he let out a long sigh. “There’s one bed.”
On the whole, Harry concluded the Headlands would be a lot more impressive if he hadn’t already taken a tour of the Irish Isles. Having felt the rush of miles of green hills rolling out before him, no civilisation in view, cliffsides had a high standard for comparison. Still, the views of the Golden Gate Bridge and the sprawling city would make for a nice story for Teddy. Ensconced as the city was now in low hanging fog, the brilliant orange of the bridge partially visible, the scene seemed like the gateway to another world. He took several photos, easily familiar with the appropriate spell for magical picture taking, even if he had to be discrete about it at a popular viewing spot. And when they returned to the bus for their next stop, Harry rather liked the curving drive along the seaside. Beside him, Malfoy’s hands gripped deep into the fabric of their seat cushion. No matter how often Harry pointed out something for the view, Malfoy refused to turn his head.
“Sorry, Parks, I meant to get it wrapped, but I was in a bit of a rush to get here. It was Charlotte’s idea.” He pushed his glasses up. They were terribly smudged, and the warmth of the restaurant had caused them to fog. Draco pressed his hands into his pockets. If he didn’t, they risked doing something reckless, like tracing the flush of cold along Harry’s cheeks and nose.
“Thanks,” Harry said, giving them each another once over before heading back toward Robards’s office. The unease he’d woken with was growing. He should have stayed up all night if he had to. He should’ve finished those files. As the assistant waved him through, and Robards stood to greet him, Harry tried to steer his thoughts in another direction, to the encouragement Ron and Hermione had offered.
The smile disappeared into a thin line. Malfoy’s gaze was flickering from Harry’s right eye to his left, unable to face on one or the other for too long. “I was surprised. That you actually showed up. You didn’t seem pleased about the news.” He ran his fingers over the rippled edges of the bar napkin. The centre had darkened from the condensation of his drink. “Thought I might show up by myself and MACUSA’d turn me right around.”
Harry grabbed a seat in the lounge with the clearest line of sight to Malfoy’s door. Then he pulled out one of his Russian conversation books. He got through asking for coffee, directions, and the restroom before he tried to figure out what the Russian word for Death Eater would be. The words lingered, sticky. It’d been a while since he’d heard that term. The other Aurors were more creative with their taunts for Malfoy: they never pulled out that one. Technically, none of the Malfoys even had that designation in their official records. The family never went to trial, and the terms of their deal with the DMLE had included guilty pleas for less serious crimes, like trespassing or misuse of magical items, in exchange for opening the Manor up to the Department and sharing everything they knew about Greyback and all the other Death Eaters still on the run.
Before he could stop himself, Harry said: “Nah, I can speak for him at least. He just sits up there to focus. He gets distracted otherwise. Good notes, if you need ‘em.” The man said nothing else, though he gave a small nod in acceptance.
The vibrations were getting stronger. Harry could see the shake in Draco’s hands. “As I’ve already explained,” Draco said, voice hushed but forceful. “I can’t do it
She laughed at him. “Oh, I know, Harry. I brought it up exactly because you wouldn’t ask. You do realise that even friends talk about the bad things going on in their lives, right? It’s not just relationships that can’t survive when you pretend everything’s alright?”
“I was thinking about staying a little longer, actually. I was going to head out next week, but something’s come up. Could keep me here for a few months, if I let it.”
Potter nodded toward the corner where it shifted into view. “It’s not mine. You can’t own a Deniden, they’re meant to warn Muggles away. I’ve just been following him where he goes. He can feel it, too, in these places.”
Harry leaned over to jostle him a little. “Of course you’d like it. It’s like one of those—oh, what was it called—the panoptic tower,” Harry said, face lighting up with the connection. “Not a perfect analogy. No prisoners, obviously, but it’s in the spirit.”
Two more days of work; then, he’d get to see Teddy. And start his campaign to get Andy inclined toward Spain. That had to be enough to get him through.
Harry raised his shoulder a bit while he took a drink. “I wasn’t lying about the credits, I really did forget. But he did indicate my coming along would smooth over the whole, er, whatever you called it.”
“I have things to do here.” Potter stared down into the bowl long enough that Draco thought he’d been forgotten. Then Potter added: “I’ll go back when I’m done.”
“I keep everyone’s secrets except yours, Potter, I couldn’t tell you if I wanted. Though the many properties you are inexplicably gifted from dying members of our society… is noteworthy, to say the least.”
There was nothing left to do after that. He was fine at Transfiguration, but he rather liked the bed as it was.
But who was counting. Harry added the polvorones next, trying not to crush the beige, delicate biscuits between his fingers. He already felt the weeks stretching out before him. “After that, I’ve got a conference to go to. Completely forgot about my continuing education requirements, so I have to shore that up before they let me back in the field.”
“Sorry about that, Potter.” Robards swept into his office and his seat. When he looked at Harry, his gaze flickered to the chair. Harry rocked back a little further. If he wanted obedience, he should show up on time.
Harry kept his focus on the carpet all the way back to his desk. He couldn’t shake the impression he’d left something back in Robards’s office. The office air was muggy, almost thick. He slid the file into the top shelf of his filing cabinet, after unlocking it. It wasn’t very orderly, but kept anything he needed to reference in the long term: some of his notes on the unsavouries beside him, his last round of credits. He closed it and locked it back up, his heartbeat pressing in his ears.
“Well, you still have to sign for it. None of my business what you do with it after.” Draco floated over the release form and a quill. Potter considered him.
"Just what I said. I want you to stop following me. It’s distracting me from—” He forced himself not to cringe. “From my work. And it’s sharing a lot of information with enemies of this country in a manner that’s interfering with the safety of all of us. Including me. So if you’ll just give me your cards, I’ll pass them on to my assistant, Ms. Crookshanks, and we can start arranging proper interviews or press releases once in a while. But otherwise I’d appreciate if—actually, I insist that you start focusing on something else. The people of this country need to know about more than what candy bar I like to eat, for Merlin’s sake.”
Harry stared at his reflection in their room’s bathroom mirror. His curls, wet and clumped from his shower, hung deep over his forehead. He used the towel to rub away the moisture and make the mess look at least somewhat intentional. Not that it mattered. It was just a bit of shopping. Maybe with a colleague.
To England, Draco understood. He wouldn't know what that was like. Anyone that would have wanted him there was dead or had fled. He’d made his peace with that.
Pansy paused in the middle of removing her coat to stare at him. The moment passed, and she shrugged the coat off entirely. “Well, he’s very late.” When she picked up a shrimp from the display, it drooped in her hand. “So, this is what it’s down to, then? Wasn’t so long ago Bachelor’s Eve was so stuffed with single men we’d have half the bar to ourselves.” She ate the shrimp after one more dubious look. “What did we start with, twenty-five?”
“Your favourite grandchild,” Teddy corrected, peeking over the edge of the couch. A headband with charmed cat ears sat on Teddy’s head and twitched under Harry’s observation. The attack came only a moment later, Teddy springing himself over the furniture in a quick burst. Harry feigned a miss, then clutched him tight.
His hands dug into the small pouch of potions he kept with him until he found the hangover potion. Closing his eyes against the bright sun peeking around the dark curtains, Harry threw it back. He felt his stomach curdle shortly after the potion settled and just as his dinner seemed likely to come back up, everything suddenly had a tingly relaxed feel to it. Harry changed and gathered the briefcase of conference materials, only then thinking to check that the other half of the once more single bed was empty. Of course Malfoy hadn’t woken him up. Except that meant Malfoy had woken up first. He hoped that for once his subconscious had kept its hands to itself.
Pansy was looking at him again. Her steely gaze always had a certain weight to it. He flicked at the shining edges of the gold wrapped gift on the bartop. The wood had been polished so smooth, the box made several rotations before it stilled again, moving slightly toward her. A distraction.
Slowly, Harry’s eyebrows rose. Draco extended a hand, remembering his manners. “You can take a seat.” He spelled the fireplace to light. It glowed a soft blue, shining off the decorative orange tiles that surrounded the hearth. “I’ll get us some glasses.”
The leave kept Harry away from the media circus that engulfed the Ministry that Friday. And over the weekend, he enjoyed sharing the adventure with Andromeda over breakfast. Took Teddy to Ginny’s next game. But he still slept poorly, that day and each day after.
The next morning, as they walked along the table of breakfast foods, Malfoy frowned and parsed through the collection of parfaits. This seemed as good a time as any, so Harry helped himself to a few pieces of toast on the nearby tray and said, “You can turn the lights on next time.”
Harry shrugged, assuming his appearance reflected the last few days. He hadn’t slept much or made any decision about the conference, but he had shaved, gotten a haircut, researched some interesting places in San Francisco to explore, and made significant progress through the paperwork pile on his desk. “If I hadn’t already promised Teddy an afternoon of flying before Ginny’s game, I’d take you up on that offer. Compromise on coffee?”
The lightness in Draco’s chest faded. Of course. Bachelor’s Eve was meant for a raucous gathering of unattached celebrating in a stupor of booze, not two blokes sharing a dinner and drinks like it was a date or something. This, Draco,
Merlin, it sounded like a Regency romance. He settled on a mumbled “before last week” and drank the rest of his champagne.
“Potter? You’re here?” Malfoy’s gaze ran across Harry’s face, lingering over his forehead. Malfoy shook himself out of it. “I didn’t—”
It took Harry a few mindless jabs, but he managed to find and press the lion-shaped doorbell without looking away from the doormat.
If the tease landed, Harry’s face didn’t show it. “Just some advice,” he said, almost to himself. “From a friend.”
Harry made a face. “Not my thing at all. Though I suppose you’d have plenty of time to do that here. Sitting in that tower staring at the same old horizon all the time.”
Harry felt again the dark silence of The Burrow when Shacklebolt shared the news. He’d arrived early to join the family dinner, a few months after the last of the memorials. His kind face had seemed pained from the outset, his formal robes holding him back from his usual casual rapport. He waited for dessert to announce that the Malfoys were cooperating with the DMLE: that there would be no trial, just an out of court agreement bartering house arrest for full cooperation in the location and prosecution of Voldemort’s remaining comrades in arms. The news seemed to suck the house of air, a cold contrast to its usual bustling energy and warmth. Harry had stared at his plate for most of the speech. At least until Ron’s powerful slam of his plate and steps out the house snapped him out of it.
Malfoy gave a barely audible “Mm” in acknowledgment. The doors dinged, announcing The View Lounge before opening. Malfoy waited, so Harry stepped out first. Catching his reflection in a nearby mirror, Harry reached up to adjust a curl, then headed through the short hall to the larger bar area. It had only a few patrons so far, but all of them were dressed in a combination of dark, fitted jeans and sleek clothes. He gave his hair a strong rub to scatter the waves further.
Eventually, she went back to collecting some of the other brooms. “You’re still single, I assume? Figure I’d have read about something by now, otherwise.”
Harry lifted his chin. "I'm sure." He took a biscuit as well and cocked his head. “Does Charlotte really think I dress like a yuppie?”
"As anything,” Robards said, eyes narrowing. “Someone thought they were very clever and submitted his portkey paperwork with the Death Eater affiliation noted. MACUSA continues to be extremely sensitive to terrorist affiliations. The damn thing took my weekend and half this week to get it sorted, and believe you-me, there will be consequences once I find out who it was.” Robards stared at his closed office door to the bullpen beyond it.
Robards inclined his head. “My first inclination was to keep him back. Would’ve been a lot easier to just say no. However, Auror Malfoy made me a convincing argument that this conference is particularly relevant to his department, and I am inclined to agree with him, in this specific case. As you know first hand, some of the information he’s identified has been invaluable to our cases over the last few years. He'll only be more useful if he can catch on to some of these new surveillance techniques."
Harry glanced at Malfoy, then over his shoulder at the bathroom. Something tugged at him, something familiar, but it passed.
“Me neither, Potter, but you always were the exception.” With a pinched smile and a flick of his wand, Malfoy set his own luggage on the desk and started unfurling hangers of clothing from his bag. A slow train of clothes made their way to the closet at the front of their room. Rather than risk any further collisions, Harry excused himself to the bathroom and turned on the shower.
Hermione grimaced from her set of files. “I’m with Ron on this one, Harry. I would have said something to you a lot sooner if I’d realised it was getting this bad.”
Harry sank back into his seat. The files seemed to stare back at him, as they had most of the week. As they had from the bottom drawer of the file cabinet where he’d left them (and forgotten them, really) for ages. It made sense, he reasoned, in some horrible, twisted way that they’d mean fuck all the minute he started to pay attention to them.
Harry started to take a drink, then changed his mind and leaned forward. “Malfoy’s The CRAPI Department? Entirely?”
She laughed, throwing her next one with enough force that it knocked some wind from him. "Exactly. Will you make it to The Burrow?"
Malfoy turned away and walked over to the nearest queue. Harry followed him, not forcing further conversation. From a quick survey of the room, Malfoy already had the attention of a few of the security officers. His portkey timing was probably still flagged, if Harry had to guess. When Harry made eye contact with any of the officers, he kept it until they shared a nod. Confidence could go both ways, but he typically found it lowered suspicions in places like this. The officers looked mean on purpose.
"Impossible," Harry said, setting his box down on the island worktop and Accio'ing a few dishes from the cabinets. “‘Weasleys don’t cook for two.’ A wise woman said that once.”
“Gin, I know what you’re doing. You could have just said things are good but you’re debating some things. I wouldn’t have pried.”
“Before…” How to put it? The pressure of a knee against his own beneath a table. The weight of a stare over his form. A hug that lingered longer than usual.
Pivoting past the visitor’s entrance phone booth—it locked him in one place for too long—Harry headed toward the public loos. He patted down his robe pockets for the token sewn into a seam near his chest and jogged to the furthest stall of the men’s. The man couldn’t follow him into the Ministry Atrium from here. When the men’s room door opened again after him and a few cautious steps echoed on the tile, Harry clenched his fist. A choice gesture itched in his fingers. It would take only a moment to flash it before flushing himself. But he imagined The List, the reminder not to engage, and the impulse subsided. At least until he stepped out through the Floo and into a crowd of Department leadership arriving as well.
Draco had become more daring the last few weeks, finding his own initiative between them. Rolling his shoulders to ride along the shiver in his spine, Harry let his hands slide down to Draco’s and then lead them back up to the edges of his dressing gown.
“I ordered breakfast,” Draco said at last, waving one of the trays over to Harry with a light flick of his wand. “I thought you might be hungry.”
Harry put their drinks down and shuffled down the couch to close the distance between them. Harry’s heart clenched at the sounds that left her. The last time she’d been like this… It had to be years ago. After the War. Her failed efforts in Australia. Though she must have cried since then. Just, not to him. He put his chin on her head.
She flicked a hand at him, shaking her head as she headed down the hall. “Coffee is exactly what I was referring to. Even my trust in you has limits, Harry, and one of them is booze before brooms with my only grandchild.”
Robards bent forward over his desk, his fingers clasped. “Have a nice weekend?” For such a chatty question, his tone seemed grim.
Harry did not do that. He returned a sleeping Teddy to Grimmauld Place, made his excuses to Andromeda, and passed through an empty living room into his bedroom. Hermione and Ron were either asleep or out. He rested against his bedroom door, once he’d closed it. All his boxes still sat everywhere, cluttering up the floor and closet and tops of his dressers. The room had seemed to shrink, the walking space for him narrower, the area too small for his things. He tried to start putting things to rights, but fifteen minutes in, he pulled open one of his drawers to see some spare clothes of Ron’s and slammed it shut.
Harry spoke into his ear, the warm breath curling down Draco’s neck as Harry slotted them chest to chest. “I’m quite thick, I’m told. When it comes to feelings. According to everyone who realized before I did.” He drew the edge of Draco’s ear between his teeth and pulled. “But I’m a quick study.”
“I most certainly can. And I didn’t want to tell you, because I knew you’d be a boor about it, but I actually have other plans this evening. I’d hoped you’d be too distracted with Pots to notice. Some Saviour he is.” She shrugged on her peacoat and pulled the edges of her bob out where it caught in her collar. “Now get out of my way, or I’ll be forced to beat you in front of all these people.”
the spongy brown thing said. A familiar roar sounded on the other side of the door, but he checked the apartment number again anyway. Still 701. He shifted the bakery box against his hip. Even wrung out from adrenaline and the portkey home, he still swore that for the past six years, there’d been nothing but a worn grey plastic doormat where this sassy novelty now—
“Oh, interesting. Wait a second.” Dave leaned in to get another look at Harry’s name tag. “Harry Potter, Harry Potter,” he whispered to himself. “That name sounds so familiar. Vickie, where have we heard of Harry Potter before?”
In his revisions, he’d left Draco Malfoy on The List. He’d crossed out the epithets and the ‘sodding.’ Striking him entirely hadn't seemed right, though, either. The loss of the barrier, the restraint: it wouldn't do to remove them now, not when just the sight of him
“Afternoon,” Harry said, handing over his identification. “I’m actually here together with that gentleman you just pulled aside, Draco Malfoy? I work with him at the Ministry of Magic. There should be something, actually, that indicates that.” Harry nodded toward the official’s computer. He looked Harry over, then spent some time reviewing something.
Harry looked over the open binders spread on the bed, the notepad already covered in notes, the hotel dressing gown Malfoy’d put on. “Right. I’ll catch you back here, then.”
“Well, my connection in here is terrible.” Dave put his phone away. “I swear, wasn’t there something a while back about some psychopath attacking a school? Somewhere in the UK? Right around there. Or am I crazy?”
Malfoy gave a single nod and looked down, his hands stilling. "Right. No, that’s—” He straightened, swiping his hands to rid them of any lingering sand. “Better. How it should be.”
“Are you busy for the next few hours?” Harry listened for an answer, then jumped when Malfoy peered around the edge of the open bathroom door.
Harry didn’t bother sitting when they reached their seats at Ginny’s Quidditch game. Teddy was already on his feet and jumping near the rails, so Harry kept close in case he needed to stop a fall or answer questions or tease him. Their box was reserved for players’ families: Ginny hadn’t taken back his seats when they’d broken up. He could’ve purchased new ones if forced to, but then Teddy wouldn’t have the other players’ children to hang out with. Worse, it would put them in the middle of strangers who would inevitably be more distracted by Harry than the game. This kept it an experience he could share with Teddy whenever he came home, to give Teddy the Wizarding childhood Harry imagined for himself sometimes. And it felt good to see Ginny play and be settled on a team. It had taken so much longer than they expected for her to move off the reserves. Their condo had burst with the elation of her immediate placement after graduation with the reserves for the Falmouth Falcons, and a picture of in her uniform had sat at Harry’s desk. But after a few years, as the spot on the reserves roster continued, he’d turned the picture around. It reflected only disappointment by then, little helped by an injury that side-lined her for half a season. Though you’d never know it from watching her now. She flew like she’d never done anything else.
Draco’s brows rose. “Have you never read a murder mystery? People are always offing relatives to get their inheritance early. Or at least threatening bodily harm until the will changes.”
The problem had been, Harry’d made the wrong assumption. Malfoy, for all his philosophies of observation, clearly didn’t get how freeing foreign perceptions could be. He'd had a taste. He saw the potential. He just startled easily.
Hermione rolled her eyes at him, and when she punched his leg, he pushed her back. “Tosh. I’ve been sulking for days by myself, thank you very much. It’s refreshing to focus on someone else’s problems.”
And Harry, his eyes practically glowing, traced down Draco’s face and back again with his gaze. “Yes, well, you’re very discreet aren’t you?”
He returned to their empty hotel room once he finished his drink. The maid service had draped Malfoy’s peacoat over the chair in the farthest corner. Harry’s gaze wandered the stitches of the seams, that hint of mint brightening the room. He reached for it, hand pivoting at the last moment for his own jacket on the other end of the chair. A dine-in menu lay on the room’s sole desk. Malfoy could fend for himself if he was hungry. That group upstairs would probably get some food while they were up there.
“I very clearly pointed up the street when we left the bar and said, ‘that ’a way.’ You have eyes, you could see the curve. Aren’t you Aurors supposed to be in top shape or something?” Dave paused to help Vickie and a few of the others along. He kept his eye on Malfoy as well, as he’d continued to fail to look the right way when they crossed streets.
Their shared breaths echoed in the dark. Draco’s sped ahead of Harry's own. Hurried. Hitching a few times until Draco seemed to become aware of it himself and purposely slow it down. Harry returned to his place behind him, nose pressed into the valley of Draco’s ear and hair, hands settling along the dressing gown belt on either side of Draco’s hips.
“Being alive. Free. Having friends. Being your friend. I thought I couldn’t ever get more happiness than that.”
“Let’s go.” It wasn’t until he reached the lift that Harry put it together. Their room hadn’t been served yet. The sheets had still spilt haphazardly over the bed.
Draco indulged in the need to swallow as Harry’s thumb avoided his Adam’s apple and brushed along his clavicle instead. The shudder passing through him was obvious.
“Will you gents be ordering any drinks?” The bartender leaned forward on the bar in front of them. Harry pulled back.
The next morning, Harry rose early to set the pot for Hermione and display her gifts from San Francisco. He went back and forth on being around when she woke up. She liked her morning routine. Thanks to his sleeping habits, he didn’t know how it changed when she was upset. He compromised on leaving her a note offering to meet up for lunch, if she felt up to it. If that wasn’t the right approach, well: she’d let him know. After their discussion, and a few more dives into the cocktail mix, she’d let him know a great many things she’d been thinking the last few years. He needed to keep his hair shorter. It started to curl when it went past his chin, and curls made him look too young when he needed to exude authority. The cologne he wore worked well, but he only needed one spritz, not three. His formal robes were flattering, but maybe a shoe with a heel would be helpful so he could be a little taller in the photos.
The stories amplified Harry’s already insistent need to get out of England as soon as possible. And not just for his conference in six days (
He headed straight for the master bath once he reached the empty apartment. The strangeness of doing so didn't strike him until he tripped over one of Ron’s shoes on the carpet. Which led to the decidedly feminine clothing and accessories spilling over from the nearby wash bin. And the spread of books and discarded pages on one side of the bed. The framed photos of them kissing near a lake. Under a willow tree. A bit of vertigo, of stepping into something foreign and intimate, hit him fast, and he quickstepped through the vanity and bathroom and closed the door behind him.
She shrunk into the seat, looking miserable. “I know.” She avoided his eyes and swirled the contents of the pitcher. “You were in a state, though. Avoiding us. I didn’t want to add to anything.”
He’d done this. Whatever he could tell himself about Malfoy and the office, he couldn’t put this on someone else.
each time he came in or left. Maybe he’d turn in some of that holiday time. Spend a week with Teddy, let Andromeda do some traveling. He swallowed back the ache. Maybe he’d just spend the night at home and then head to Spain early, do some sightseeing before the interview. Just because he couldn’t work out of the country didn’t mean he couldn’t leave. His things were still mostly packed anyway. Ready to go.
Andromeda focused her dark eyes on him, her fingers squeezing the handle of her mug. "Isn't my nephew on that list of yours?"
He felt a familiar tingle at the back of his neck that told him he was being watched. When he looked up, he started. Malfoy’s papers were gone. The man, though, was not. He bent over a stack of files, fringe covering his eyes. Today’s jumper was a faded green. Harry swallowed and set his bag down.
“Strange, to put it so close to civilisation,” Harry said after the white noise of the crowd had quieted back around them, and his heartbeat stopped ringing in his ears.
Robards considered him. “They’re senior enough that I don’t have much reason to question their judgment.”
Harry shook his head. “Not in any specific terms. I feel like, it'd be fine either way. If I stay home for a while, not a problem. There’s a restaurant I’m quite keen to try nearby. And if I get a case abroad, I get to avoid helping you move.”
Harry eventually stood and stretched. More coffee was needed before he could progress to the next set of files. It’d taken almost four hours to get through the first. As he cracked his shoulders, he saw the Auror bullpen had filled up now.
green. Totally different. “But it is a lovely colour,” he said, tugging the gift out of her reach. She was going to crunch the paper.
“No colours this time,” Draco asked. The sight of a Deniden was not supposed to be comforting. He’d take the familiarity, nonetheless. After he spoke, the Deniden turned away. Its gaze fixed toward the main house and the farthest right corner of its deck.
Potter’s face soured. “Whatever. Don’t deliver any more of those to me. They could send a thousand, and I’d burn every one of them.”
Malfoy handed over his goods to the cashier. “No.” His gaze flickered over to Harry, his mouth going drawn. “I’m still in Wiltshire. Just not at the Manor. There was an old parsonage at the end of our land, past our stables. I made it one of my projects during my house arrest. After I got my N.E.W.T.S.”
Harry set his fork down. “Is this what we’re going to talk about all lunch? Because if so, I have plenty of tedious topics to focus on at my desk, thanks.”
Harry set his luggage down on the floor. “Doesn’t bother me to share with another bloke.” When Malfoy looked at him this time, he kept doing so. His gaze didn’t quite meet Harry’s eyes, but got close.
Harry avoided eye contact as he left the lift, almost barrelling past Susan Bones when she tried to catch him on his way.
Once they were out of sight, Harry closed his eyes and indulged in a brief fantasy of walking into Robards’s office with a tidy report about some of the tactics that likely got those two their arrests. The backdated warrants. The bribes Jenkins liked to give. The pair of them took a whole portion of The List that Harry kept only in his mind: the bit he couldn’t risk sitting out there publicly for anyone to view. But he wasn’t Getting Involved. He opened his eyes and finished sorting the last of his receipts.
Downstairs, Harry disappeared into the crowd of people walking the pavement. The restaurant he’d booked would take about forty minutes by foot, the front desk said, and he had a few hours to spare before that. Spain lingered in his thoughts, Minister Salas echoed in some of the brunette women in power suits passing him by. Except he could taste the salt in the air here, see a city arching toward the sky with towering buildings in stone and glass. Compared to the cathedrals of Spain, the castles of England, the city was emerging, flowing with new ideas and a significant number of blonds per capita: he saw them everywhere. Twisting the scarf a little tighter around his throat, Harry walked on.
“Of course, of course. You should have said something.” She stepped back. Once they were out of the way, he waved the door closed. Hermione swiped at her eyes with her jumper sleeves.
Beneath them, the city hummed. Cars passed and honked. A dog barked vaguely from somewhere north. Harry longed for his glasses, something to keep his hands busy. He had nothing here: an empty hill in a foreign city.
“To be fair to Harry, public charity events are on The List,” Ron said, his chin resting in his free hand. “And Harry’s not a lump on a log. He’s doing things. Godfathering Teddy. Landlord to us, letting us live here in sin. Being an alright Auror, supposedly, even if he spends more time solving other countries’ problems, but no one’s perfect.” Ron dodged the biscuit Harry threw his way with practiced ease. “You can’t be mad when it means he isn’t there to save the pixies—”
He focused on the hallway closet instead. Unpacking his room would be a waste anyway: he’d probably be moving soon. Maybe. He couldn’t think about it here. His head was starting to hurt. It took him all of an hour to sort through the closet. The former bookshelf had held mostly folios from his International Operations training and language textbooks, as well as some of the knick-knacks he’d collected from his travels. An ornately carved owl in Italian Alabaster, wings spread wide in mid-flight. An exaggerated Victor Krum model from Japan. The owl stayed in his room. The books and other items went out to the shelf reserved for him on their new bookcase.
Draco nodded. He had mentioned it the year before; a few rounds of salted caramel martinis gave him the recklessness to be more available in front of Harry. Or at least, to try again when his attempts in years prior had failed. But Harry had again seemed uninterested at the time—had not been paying much attention at all, in the midst of an arm wrestle with Blaise (Harry lost horribly)—so the resurrection of the information now, well: it was surprising.
As he worked further toward the north end of the city, he saw the homeless population was also much higher here. He paused several times to hand them some of his cash, or to buy a few some warm coffees. For a sleeping man and his dog, he cast the strongest warming charm he knew.
Harry rocked onto the back legs of the guest chair in Robards’s office. The Head Auror was late, which was annoying—Harry’d cut his lunch with Hermione short to make it back in time. He’d done fine, that morning, it turned out. She appreciated the chance to think things through (and loved, loved,
It took a little over fifteen minutes before they saw a large sand-coloured hill peak out of the middle of the residential area, and Dave gave a hoot.
Reaching over to his file cabinet, Harry began to pull out the various CRAPI Memorandums. Once they started to cover his desk, the mint followed, even after all this time. He pushed them to the furthest end of his desk to help his focus. He’d also forgotten his file cabinet was forever extendable (and just how long he’d been ignoring the messages). He leaned back in his chair once the drawer was empty. Five stacks, each five files deep, were arranged along the length of his desk and the furthest cubicle wall. He sighed.
“Good,” he said to himself, eyeing the clearly marked road to the nearest house. It was more of a compound, really, once he adjusted to the evening light. Brick buildings in varied states of decay spotted the grounds. Between them, clothing lines stretched, empty and ragged. The buildings surrounded a two-story house with broken windows. A large wooden deck traced the exterior, its guard rails fallen in along the left side. On the roof, someone had spray painted “Bewear!!!”
Malfoy continued, gathering steam: “Do you know how many people I sent that first memo to before I let it touch your desk? Everyone’s. Every Auror in that office got it first, and I just kept hoping that someone would take it seriously. That if I got through the program, didn’t make a fuss; if I never looked above my station or unrepentant; they’d look past the Malfoy name to my actions. But that’s not how this works. We can’t escape who we are. In that whole office, it had to be Harry Potter who finally saw my tip for what it was.”
In the lingering silence, Malfoy kept rubbing his hands together. Harry watched the movements. Artful, if unsteady. If he were a suspect, Harry wouldn’t say anything. Nervous ones always filled in the gaps, if you gave them the time.
At this, Harry turned to look over his shoulder, and blinked at the crowded scene. Only a moment ago, the space had been nearly empty. Now he saw the sky had transitioned into shades of pinks and red. He wondered how long he’d been standing there, his drink sweating and untouched in his hand.
“You don’t think I’m interested in how the magical community secures and maintains information?” Harry asked, quoting the bit he’d finally read of the conference materials the night before.
“It’s a tip,” Malfoy said. His hands had folded into his lap. For his pastels and stillness, he could have been a painting, one of those impressionist ones Harry’d seen during his last case in France.
“Nervous?” Hermione asked, once they entered the lift doors. Harry leaned back against the lift wall.
Harry left early for his portkey Wednesday evening after putting on the longer-lasting Glamour he always used when going overseas. It corrected his vision, covered up his scar, and gave his hair a little warmth, appearing dark brown rather than ebony. He felt lighter as soon as it washed over him.
“Fine.” Limping, but trying to hide it, Potter walked over to the deck and sat in the chair. Draco felt the ropes disappear. Potter still didn’t trust him. He made no effort to hide the wand still held at the ready in his hand.
“The witches out in the Haight have all but left across the bay now. Berkeley, Oakland, you’ll find a lot more over there. Here, you just can’t rely on things the same way. I tried to Apparate to the shop the other day and found myself on that street corner across the street. Finally caved and got myself a Prius.”
A short man in a green suit and the bushiest beard Harry had seen since Hagrid blinked into view. With a wave of his hand, a fold out table appeared with a colourful array of binders and documents laid out in a row. Leaned against the front legs of his table was a sign. Welcome to the Second Annual Auror Conference for the Theory and Application of Magical and Emerging Surveillance Technologies.
It should have been his first stop that day. None of the other packages in his queue matched its importance. Still, he slid the charmed roller blades onto his feet and delivered several others first, mostly personal correspondence or documents of court, for names he didn't know. Then he lunched on a bench by the Santa Monica pier and watched tourists fly (and mostly fall) on a modified trapeze. They had all kinds of flight, Muggles. They could reach the stars in the guts of the metal birds that roared over his flat every night from the airport. But none of that matched the
But he’d known, hadn’t he? That something was off. Malfoy’d just made it so easy to ignore. He was quick with excuses.
To his complete lack of surprise, Harry had no problem saving a seat for himself and Malfoy in the very front row. No one cared to sit there if Malfoy was gone, it seemed. His own preferred seat was already spoken for. Back in magical company, Harry had no qualms about hovering four cups of coffee along with him, assuming Malfoy could use the usual jab of caffeine that Harry needed most days. He set out the requisite number of sugars and cream—Malfoy’s foods were consistent. The morning speaker only got two slides in before Malfoy slid into the seat beside him, avoiding his eyes.
Draco’s thumb ran back and forth over his name. When the question reached him through his haze, he nodded. “They got my name wrong.”
Harry almost snorted his first mouthful of stew at Hermione’s flustered expression. French had been the first language Harry picked up to qualify for International Operations, and she’d initially tried to help him.
