Potter raises his eyebrows like he’s been caught, something along the lines of, ‘I hope he didn’t hear that!’ written all over his face.
"I do, quite," Malfoy agreed softly. His eyes darted back and forth between the two boys, rapid and calculative. Harry did not know what the point was, as not only had he heard them, but Albus' chest was completely bare.
," Draco quipped, and leaned forward to lick his tongue into Harry's mouth. They groaned collectively and their tongues danced together while their lips tried their best to stay in contact. A hand ran down the brunet's back and a finger tapped on his spine, twice, four times, six.
"Then go commando," Harry says, follows it up with a deep chuckle, "Merlin knows you love being a lewd little shit. You've still got cum on your robes."
“Don’t look now,” someone muttered, “but is that
, Potter. It always has been," he sighed, his words sending shivers of contentment through him. Reaching behind himself, Draco grabbed onto Harry’s hair, tugging on it roughly to force his head up. “I think I told you to
Additionally, the blasted letter from earlier decides it's time to make itself relevant again by plopping to the ground next to the blond, who is scowling quite heavily now. The only upside to this situation is that his Wizarding radio has run out if things to say- but even that is quickly overshadowed by the pain that shoots up his spine when he tries his damnedest to sit up.
She slows to a halt in front of Fred and George's old shared bedroom, currently occupied by sweet little Harry and a couple dozen mysterious experimental potion stains marring the floors and walls. The twins were a right nuisance but she can't say she doesn't dearly miss having them around all the time.
the possiblity that Malfoy was... you know... participating in sexual intercourse. Can you blame him? Who'd ever want to shag the ferret face?)
"He's not as bad as he used to be," Harry says again, more to himself than to the others.
hi, everyone! it's been a while. i've not been feeling particularly hilarious lately, so there's been a significant gap between me writing this chapter and the last. nevertheless, i wanted to make the story progress so here's a ~slightly humorous~ update to the series
He bent down, bracing himself against the back of the loveseat and thus effectively trapping Malfoy in place. Malfoy, who had gone especially rigid, a sliver of fear breaking through the cool barrier of his gaze, could only stare back at him.
"Vanessa Thornberry? Now
"POTTER!” Draco interrupted, screaming as he came all over himself- his lithe body jolting and his cock spurting thick white strings of cum on his stomach as well as his mirror. Harry held his sides firmly, even as his own orgasm threatened to overwhelm him. He all but collapsed from his climax, continuing his strokes lazily inside Draco wet heat. He felt his own spunk dribble out the sides of his lover’s hole while he slowly straightened up, sliding out gently as the blond spun around to face him, leaning heavily against the abused vanity. Harry kissed Draco deeply, gripping his face in one hand, arse in the other as the latter wound two strong arms around his shoulders and drew him in impossibly closer.
weird," Lucius says tightly, "And it is not the Potter spawn! Lord, Draco, where on earth do you get these irrational ideas from?"
Draco’s breaths came heavy, “Potter-
To be honest, Draco thinks as he removes one of his hats, he’s a bit flattered. Potter’s romantic preference based solely off
"Uh huh... so Quidditch, right?" Harry settled back in his seat, crossing his legs to mimic the way Malfoy was seated, "Reminds me of some good times... beating you, that is."
! Why else had Draco been so irreparably spoilt and starry eyed toward his beloved Father throughout his childhood following the first disappearance of the Dark Lord? The Evil Man's presence severely clouded his followers' senses of judgement and righteousness, goddamnit!)
Said ears were now flushing with shame and mortification. He had been about to pull one off to Malfoy. To Malfoy pulling himself off! To him, all over again!
. Harry watched with morbid fascintion as the white, bubbling saliva dribbled slowly into the dark pink depths of Draco’s hole. The blond keened loudly, back arching and arse thrusting upwards. Harry watched his saliva roll faster into his opening and felt himself grow harder than he'd ever been in his life.
If, however, the source of the noise does end up being him... well, Dudley's awfully bored anyway. It'll be fun to chew the twerp out, despite the hour.
"Pathetic," the blond spits, and Dudley's heart is pounding, truly terrified for once at what seems to be an enemy of Harry's, armed and dangerous and in his kitchen, "I shouldn't even be wasting my time with the likes of stinking vermin like-"
"Bet you think you're so special, don't you, Potter?" Malfoy snarled, his voice sounding oddly squeaky in his adolescence, "Lording your so called victory over the heads of your dunderheaded followers as if you haven't won it with a few cheap tricks?"
To Harry's reawakened outrage, Malfoy spit up in his face, "Try me, you filthy bastard-"
"No I'm not mad! I'm just... Malfoy? Really?"
"Hey!" Harry groans, "Also, yes."
"You want more? I could give you more," the brunet managed to get in, between big gasping breaths. Drops of sweat were visibly beginning to roll off the bridge of his nose and onto Malfoy's face, but the blond did not scowl.
"I'll just-" he looked up at Jacobson, and quickly looked back down again, "I'll just leave."
"You wanna fuck me like this?" comes a different whisper, far more breathless than the first. The next bit is too soft to overhear but it's something along the lines of, 'right under the family's noses?'
thank you for reading!
"No, not pubes, PWBBs!" Ron says seeming quite happy with himself.
"Mr. Harry Potter, Sir."
please leave me a comment if you can! any feedback makes me real happy :)))) my twt is @dracominnie if you'd like to be friends!₊*̥(* ⁰̷̴͈^⁰̷̴͈)‧˚₊
Strangely, this felt more perverse to Harry than watching the man bugger himself to climax. Following a sleep-softened (or perhaps post coital) Malfoy as he padded barefoot through his own home seemed very personal, for some reason.
Harry's throat closed up with emotion, as well as pure
"Harry! He's going to kill us!" Dudley shouts in a panic. After all, this boy was an enemy of Harry's and his, both.
Before Harry could try and get his head around it, the wards shimmered again.
Harry kissed Draco.
Molly presses her fingers to her lips. No doubt, that has got to be dear Harry with her littlest one, Ginny in there. She shakes her head, a small smile on her lips, and listens in again, just to be sure.
dinner-"
"I thought they were!"
Harry kissed him again, Draco’s lips parting under his own like the petals of a blooming flower. He groaned, and ran his hands over his lover’s warm, pale body, shudders quaking the blond’s frame as he did so.
"Probably," Harry adds as an afterthought, "he's
, thank you, Potter, for ruining absolutely everything- and trudges towards the washroom.
However amidst all the panic, Ron couldn't take his eyes off the bucking blonde and his best friend going at it like two Crups in heat. Not with the way Malfoy's lust-darkened gaze held him petrified at the doorframe.
Then, he spit.
It made Harry more upset than he had anticipated.
"Heavens, no!" he said earnestly, "I just saw the great oaf bust through the door just before we finished. I'm sorry I didn't tell you, baby."
s. Ron was really hoping he'd get a look at the ferret's face turned towards him in shock and anger.
Malfoy's eyes are still hard, and his lip splits into another fantastically mean sneer, and he snaps, "Fine, Potter, make it quick," before strutting out of the room.
Belatedly, it occurred to him that Malfoy's cock twitched and quivered like an arrow at the sight of Harry's photos.
Sliding his hand to the back of his head, he gripped his hair as tight as he could without feeling bad about it, and thrust into Draco's mouth. Stars exploded in his vision, amplified only by the guttural moan that vibrated in the back of Draco's throat.
"Fuck," Draco said as they separated once again, "oh, fuck.
(which, in itself was quite significant, thank you very much). Well, you can't really blame her; it's not like
for Harry.
“So you’re saying you haven’t been exclusively fucking blondies like him ever since Ginny?”
"I'm sorry if I interrupted you and your... friend earlier," Harry said, untruthfully of course, while barely managing to keep the bitterness out of his tone.
"-that way!"
(See the end of the chapter for
Reluctantly, he broke away from his lover's lips and felt around for the light switch. It was easy enough to find, and a minute click sounded before the room was bathed golden yellow light.
Harry had been putting far too much trust into last night's 'visions' as well, he realised, because what were the odds of Malfoy having major hots for him all this time? The whole fiasco was becoming suddenly ludicrous.
Harry's jaw dropped open in shock. He scanned the room again, in a whole new light. Every child bore some resemblance to him or Ginny in colouring, he reckoned, but it was true that none could truly and surely be identified as his.
"We're not here to arrest him," Ron placated, holding out his palms in surrender.
This being the third time Harry had attempted to get himself off to vision-Malfoy, he had no qualms about how hard or how fast he thrusted into the tight circle of his fist. Not when Malfoy was using his free hand to rub at his knob through the silk of future-Harry's shirt.
"Alright," Harry placates, "so maybe I'm a little partial to blondes."
Glad that Malfoy had chosen to love him, in his own twisted way, till their hourglasses would come to a still.
"What are you doing here, f-" he stops, once he's in the kitchen doorway. The figure standing before the cabinets is far too lean and too tall to be his cousin, "-reak?"
"A salad will suffice," Malfoy states haughtily, like he's placing an order at a restaurant, "without onions if you will. A glass of wine would be nice, but I doubt this Muggle pigsty of a home will have it."
"George... and Fred, too," he gasped, a lump rising unbidden in his throat, "this means we're in the past after all."
, oh Merlin, he was still here! "but your house elves told us Auror Potter gives you rewards for being a 'very good boy', and then came the screaming, and then, well..."
Perhaps his quest is futile after all, he panics, trudging towards the hat section and picking one up— midnight blue with black trim, and rather pointy. A bit too last-year for his taste!— and studies it wearing the calmest expression he can muster. Potter already has his sewer-water colored eyes upon Draco’s prize—hair. All is nil!
Gremly's bored expression did not change when he replied with, "Exactly."
“I just assumed…” he trailed off.
The blonde finished swallowing his sip, and very gently put his cup down on the table. To his credit, he had barely reacted.
After that, he pulled his robe loose and let it drop to the floor beneath him. Harry's eyes strayed over to him and stuck, like bees to a flower.
To his pleasant surprise, Harry found himself touching down on sweet land after no longer than a minute. They were at a place he recognized well enough, if only by sight: an attractive apartment complex at the heart of London, just a few blocks down from Harry's own.
And the vision faded away.
"So that'll include Draco Malfoy," Hermione says carefully, and Ron's eyes bug out. It's almost like a switch has been flipped, and it would be funny, really, if Harry weren't so baffled at the sudden change in gears.
"Y-you're not allowed to do magic outside of school," Dudley tries, desperately grasping onto the singular morsel of knowledge that protected him from Harry's hidden wrath, "you'll be expelled!" His slight triumph at the end of his little outburst is quelled quickly by the second sting in the same spot, stronger than the first. He yelps, and rubs his backside woefully as the blond sneers down his nose at him again.
Harry coughed, but Draco would not back down before anyone except for his parents. "Harry was giving me my birthday present. Weren't you, baby?"
"Oh, shit," Harry groaned, unable to help himself from cupping his own dick through his sleeping pants. Malfoy's neck was long and pale, arching back elegantly to reveal his throat. His fingers flinched again as he lifted his hips up off the toy slightly before sinking back down on it with a guttural moan.
He kissed her head, and tucked the pink blanket more securely around her body.
"Fuck me, Potter," he said, his head lolling to the side. Harry watched as beads of sweat collected on Malfoy's top lip. He marvelled in the way his pink toes curled, and his hips began to jutter.
"Hermione Point," Ron grumbles, and Harry nods in acknowledgment. Every fancy phrase to pass either Harry or Ron's lips earns the speaker a Hermione point. It's been their own little variant on the Hogwarts House point system ever since the war had ended and they had realized they missed Hogwarts, very much. Harry's confident he's going to win the Hermione Cup this year.
"I believe he means P.W.B's, Harry," Hermione says fondly, and ruffles Ron's hair, "That's a Hermione Point for making inappropriate-sounding acronyms. Oh Ron, this is wonderful!"
Molly sets the basket down on the floor, and the snitch printed jumper she'd given Harry last week for his seventeenth birthday winks up at her from atop it. Several years of raising seven rowdy children have sharpened her senses and she tiptoes closer to where she thinks the sound came from, making sure to avoid the creaky floorboard in front of Ginny's room.
Harry's waving a hand in Ron's line of sight, fruitlessly of course.
Malfoy's body gave a delicate shudder, and before Harry knew it, his towel was gone, putting gleaming ivory skin on display for the world to see. Or rather, just for Harry to see. And perhaps for the kinky spirits.
"Fuck you," says the other person who's got a regal male accent, and there's a wet noise that Molly doesn't want to believe is a kiss, "let's get the fuck out of here. You owe me a set of underpants, the responsibility to keep me warm on the way there cause all i've got is this stupid old robe," he lowers his voice as if it makes a difference, "and your tongue up my asshole."
"Definitely
"I'm leaving! Merlin, get your knickers out of that massive twist," a deep, unknown voice responded.
Molly Weasley hums to herself while she carries a yellow wicker basket full of laundry up the stairs and into the hallway.
the boys will definitely meet in the next chapter! please leave me a comment if you can! any feedback makes me real happy :)))) my twt is @dracominnie if you'd like to be friends!₊*̥(* ⁰̷̴͈^⁰̷̴͈)‧˚₊
?" Malfoy exclaims again, and Dudley recoils. This seems to be a trigger of sorts, "We are not
"No," Harry replies, even though the question was a rhetorical one, "and neither has Ron, I bet."
"Oh, er, Dudley," Harry says, suddenly the awkward teenaged stick he's always been and not the wondrous daredevil who has quelled the beast that is the mysterious Malfoy, "I suppose you wouldn't... like a salad?"
"I was
But after the humdrum of the engagement and the whole 'I've got a fiance(é)!' phase had worn off, it was all a flurry of tedious wedding preparations, robe fittings, ring shopping, endless planning, and Hermione's penchant for ridiculous, overambitious ideas.
Harry could only stare after the man, jaw dropping slowly open in confusion. He felt the beast in his chest rage and claw at the walls of the Draco-shaped hole it resided in. The loss of the blond's pliant body was doing wonders for no one, clearly.
A tea set appeared on the coffee table in front of them with a slight clatter that made Harry jump. He was getting really sick of things suddenly appearing out of nowhere.
"Want you-" index and middle fingers disappeared into the no doubt velvety warmth that was Malfoy's hole, "I won't- won't tell. I won't ever tell anyone, ever. Promise. Just- please, Potter."
"Terence, Higgs, whatever- leave my house and allow me to attend to my guest."
The bangs grow louder as he approaches the kitchen. Typical of the freak, Harry, to be stealing food at midnight.
Mentally, he applauded himself, because his reflection showed him looking much more calm than he felt, especially when Draco’s mouth curved into a sly little smile.
old  to be a shell of the elf it once was, but Gremly just seemed a bit fed up of everything around him.
Malfoy's son looked almost exactly like him, the only differences being his hair and the way his nose turned up instead of going straight down in a slim stroke like his father's. He had the same eyes, the same pointy chin, and the same little twist to the corner of his mouth that made him look like he were about to say something nasty even if he really wasn't.
"Stingy as all hell, that one. Eh Potter?" Higgs shot a suggestive grin towards Harry, but deflated immediately in the face of the sour glare he was met with, "Right then."
"Young Mister Malfoy returns home tonight from a rather taxing dinner party," the spirit informed him, and Harry nodded in acknowledgment. Though he'd only half heard him, no thanks to the way his eyes seemed to want to do nothing but run up, down and all over the long, lean lines of Malfoy's damp body.
A wide eyed, scandalized Molly presses her ear to the door once again urgently, ignoring the mildly concerned look her daughter shoots at her before dragging herself off to the loo.
"You know where he is," Ginny replied, her voice thick with bitterness. Future-Harry did not look surprised.
Horrified, Harry began patting himself down, and was shocked to see that his body had developed the ethereal glowiness of his spirit companion.
"This is mad talk," Ron squeaks, and the shock of both his best friends (one of them being his fiancée!) having opinions so drastically at odds with his own shocks him back into his perpetual state of hunger. He picks up his no doubt cold turkey sandwich and continues devouring it, as he should, "Hermione, I know all this planning is stressing you out, and you must be in a fragile headspace at this moment, and I forgive you. But from you, Harry? Are you sure this isn't just your... little
"They're a perfect delight," future-Harry said, and shrunk in the face of her renewed fury, "I mean, they are. If I didn't have work, I'd be very happy to look after them instead. But you
"Fucking hell," Harry said, in what could only be described as a sigh.
"This is simply not done," Draco mutters, pulling on a set of lovely plum coloured robes that he had originally hated with a burning passion.
"...not yours," the Grim rumbled, and Harry froze.
He watched lazily as Draco tugged silken sheets over his nude body before slipping in beside him. Once settled, he drew his arms around him, resting one palm atop Harry’s chest. It tickled when his fingers played with the dark curls there, and he smiled against the feeling.
first off, i'd like to say a great big thank you to everyone who showed so much love to this silly little fic! i'm so, so happy that you all liked it so much!
"Oh, Harry, Harry, oh, I love you so much don't stop, fuck me, god yeah, fuck me harder baby, love you, love you, faster, fuck me please please please please!"
Harry’s throat had already gone completely dry several moments ago. He gulped, and reached out a hand, loosely circling Draco's working wrist in his palm.
Draco freezes mid blasting curse, lowering his wand sullenly as the radio keeps prattling on about Potter like he'd single-handedly brought blondes (the superior hair colour, really) to glory. He scowls, reclining back against his velvet headboard and stroking a hand up his cock that had been wilting rather sadly, no thanks to all the interruptions. Nothing is going to stop him from wanking this morning, especially not
"What, like in Star Wars?" so the blond menace
"Daddy," Draco says, striding towards the desk slowly, "You're curling."
The word echoes horribly in the vastness of the corridor, but he refuses to let himself be embarrassed of it in the privacy of his own home. What kind of monstrous child chooses a nickname for his or her parent at the wee age of one- or two if they're slow- and does not keep it up till the end of time?
, Ron had thought, but he really should have at least
"Yes! Yes! It looks exactly like Harry Potter!
And Harry shuts him up, somehow, grabbing him by his bony ankles and hurling him forward so that his legs come to bracket his waist.
"Who the fuck is this?" Malfoy yawned, and yelped when Harry's palm smacked his arse again.
"Merlin," Malfoy but his lip, pale brows creasing hard while he squeezed away at his cock, fingers pumping at a furious pace as his legs began to tremble oh-so-delicately.
Harry bit back a scream, squinting into the light as it slowly faded down into something more bearable.
Harry laughs at his friends' antics, and spares Malfoy another brief thought. Once a prominent figure in his life, albeit negative, and now completely disconnected. He wonders what it'll be like to interact with Malfoy without the crippling pressure of the war and the constant apprehension towards how he was about to compose his next 'yo momma' barb. Or punch Harry's face in.
He remembered now, how the promising fight had been broken up by an exasperated Angelina ("Come on, Harry, we've got a party to get to!") and Harry had abandoned his rival without much preamble, managing to get in a nasty scowl while he wiped the saliva off his face. Malfoy had risen up on his elbows to glare back at him, but did not follow, instead choosing to remain where he was panting and wheezing.
"M'foy?" a sleepy voice calls from the hallway outside the kitchen and both blonds freeze. Harry walks in wearing overlarge pyjamas; his horrible hair rumpled impossibility more than usual, and his glasses askew. His eyes are soft with sleep.
hello! :-) this is a spin on the classic "party games" trope! my only problem with it is that imo i find it annoying to think that the houses would all just... come together and get sloshed, play seven minutes in heaven togther, or whatever. hence, this story was born.
Draco nods, "Well enough. What were you doing down here in your night things, though?"
"Mate," he said gravely, with the air of someone who had seen and lived through hell. And he really had, come to think of it.
Ron really wanted to draw some attention to himself at this point, but-- oh damn it all!-- it was too sweet! He hadn't seen Harry looking this happy in forever!
Malfoy may not have turned ugly, his hair may have stayed that beautiful shiny blond and his skin may have been clear as a baby's behind- but his eyes were nothing more than two dark holes drilled into his skull.
"But Master Draco is being very good, Aurors!" Mippy nearly sobs.
Harry was sweating in places he had no idea he
Cautiously, she presses an ear to the weathered door.
"Good dream? Bad dream?" Ron quips, collapsing onto his roommate's bed, fully dressed in his Auror robes.
"Cor, he's here. Out! Get out! I've told you a million times already and you are starting to get on my nerves!"
The blond is on him before he can blink, and he lets out and embarassing sort of  whinny as the wooden tip of the stick pokes into his flesh.
on his fingers with the fervour of a starving man. At Harry's salty sweat coating his digits.
"Both of what you just said sound exactly the same."
"Any sugar? Milk?" Malfoy inquired, and Harry noted carefully the way his fingers hovered over the creamer before he’d even agreed.
"Fuck, yes just- just like that. Pretty little mouth like yours, wasted on the shite that comes out of it," he continued, squeezing the shaft of his dick with one practiced hand while the other reached further below to squeeze his heavy balls, pink and ever so slightly fuzzy with minute blond hairs. Like a wicked little peach, ripe for the taking.
Harry shivered as he stared at Malfoy's relaxed face. Wondered what had happened to leave him so hollow.
(See the end of the chapter for
"It is certainly not him," Lucius sniffs, taking the frame and placing it gently next to a photograph of Draco at two years old, already bashing fellow out-of-frame toddlers over their heads with a teething ring and a nasty expression. It's great to start building character at a young age.
"But who is he?" Dudley asks again, "What's he to you? What's he
He thought back to the Malfoy he encountered every once in a while at the local Tesco. The twenty-one year old with broad shoulders and soft, tumbling hair. His deep rumbling voice and the haughty aloofness that had replaced his childish hotheadedness.
There's hissing and mumbling. There's wet little sucking noises and there's a slap. If she hadn't guessed what was happening before, she'd definitely have known something was up from the way the rickety bed (Fred's she guesses, it's closer to the door) bangs against the wall.
"Sexy dream?" he continues with an ill-fitting leer in Harry's direction, causing him to scowl darkly, "Come on! Give a man some details!"
"You are the highlight of this marriage, and I love you, Draco," he responds.
disgusted, but also more turned on than he'd ever been in his life. He found himself mentally agreeing to every rhetorical question that escaped Malfoy's dirty mouth.
Harry slid out of Draco almost completely, and snapped his hips hard. The blond stuttered forward, with another loud moan a fierce yet playful look in his eyes boring into him as he caught his stare. He eyed his lover’s body in the vanity, his pale limbs and rosy nipples, his toned torso and his hard cock that was flushed pink and practically leaking against his stomach.
"You were
And if he could kiss Malfoy right then, even if the man hexed him, hit him, cussed him out and tossed him out on his arse afterwards- he'd be alright.
"Not your children. Only two."
Yes, Ron and Hermione are finally getting married. Four and a half years of sexual tension and three more of passionate dating had lead up to that fateful day. Ron on one knee with a little velvet box in his shaking hands. A tearful Hermione startling everyone else in the restaurant with her pitchy "YES! OH MY GOD, RONALD, YES!!" And Harry sitting at a back table Polyjuiced into Uncle Vernon (eurgh) passive-aggressively initiating a collective applause ("Clap your hands, you worthless buffoons! Don't you lot ever watch romantic movies till the end?").
that are no doubt going to stem from this broadcast will be doing favours for absolutely no one. Not even Potter deserves that. Draco Jr. begins to twitch back to life under the constant attention from its most loyal companion- Draco's right hand- and he hums, running his fingers through the damp blond curls at its base. Natural, of course.
He let out a lengthy sigh, Malfoy's face, like broken crystal, still swimming at the forefront of his mind. "The Ghost of Christmas Future," he acknowledged, turning around to find himself face to face with a large black dog- not nearly as friendly-looking as Sirius had been in his animagus form. This Spirit was closer in likeness to the Grim they had learnt about all those years ago in Divination.
"Is it that weird little picture of Potter again?" Draco sneers.
She stops, abruptly, startled by the muffled voice that, seemingly unintentionally, finished the lyric for her. It's barely six in the morning and none of the kids should be this coherent before ten during their vacation.
"Yeah, I don't think you should go to Potter's wedding," Draco eyes the portrait frame again, shiftily, "or be around Potter at all, for that matter."
a little bit of delay before this one, but oh well. this is a draco centric chapter!
"Pubes?!" Hannah Abbot shrieks as she walks by, nearly tripping over her heels in the process and scuttling away as soon as she recovers. Harry grimaces; they really need to get a new gathering spot. Smack in the centre of the Ministry cafeteria is a horrible place to be discussing Harry's fondness towards:
With the acute hatred towards gingers and mudbloods in mind, he had joined the Dark Lord's mudblood destroying regime (before belatedly realizing how horrible an idea that was, damn you, 19 year old Lucius), as well as strengthening the ever present blood feud with the painfully ginger Weasleys. While he resents passing these ideals onto his son, he does not in the slightest regret conditioning Draco into hating those insufferable Weasleys. Merlin knows Arthur is still a raving nutter and his bleeding cow of a wife is no better-
Slowly, he raised himself off the sofa and began stalking over to Malfoy. The blond sat rigid, except for his frantic foot, hands clasped gently. The milky white skin of his collar peeked out over the neckline of his robe, bones visible, but not skeletal.
"Don't you 'hey Gin' me," Ginny said softly, dangerously, "Where the hell have you been?"
now, the reason i am writing this is to acknowledge the fact that this work has been reposted to another site without my permission! :-(
A professional rosewood reception desk sat close to the lifts, adding a rather hotel-like  touch to the whole place. The clerk sitting at it was the only aspect of the room, so far, that had not served to make Harry even more nervous than he'd already been. The fellow had a rounded, cheerful looking face and big, bright eyes.
"Where's Al?" future-Harry asked slowly. Harry caught Teddy shaking his head in the background.
“Bed?” he asked, and dragged Harry over to the aforementioned place without waiting for an answer.
"Whossit?" Ron asked through a yawn. He was hoping it was Nott. That fucker was always just kind of quiet when they went to see him, and he even served them biscuits sometimes which were honestly better than Hermione's (not that he'd ever tell her so).
It's not like Harry wasn't nervous. He was dead terrified of being wrong, of finding out that last night's visions had been nothing but mere dreams, or latent fantasies he hadn't even known he could have. However, Harry was a Gryffindor, and charging into difficult matters head first was basically his life motto.
“You've been such a tease,” he told him, digging his thumbs into the crease between his cheeks and spreading them. Draco's hand had long since returned to join its mate at the edge of the table, rings clacking noisily against the wood.
"Gross!" Ron yelped, and the pair turned to face him again, "This is news to me, mate."
Dudley nearly falls out of the tree when Harry leaves the bed-- butt naked and rummaging in a drawer for god-knows-what-- and for the second time today, he's caught off guard by the appearance of a throbbing pink cock. A cock! Harry's girl is not a girl at all!
"We talked about it just this morning."
About a dozen Gryffindors circled him, their wands drawn and a Lumos beam shining down on his face from each. One would think it was easy enough to see a person with
He doesn't even put up a fight, being too shell-shocked to speak, and makes his way back up the stairs. There's a dangerous felon in his house! And he knows it's time to put on his detective cap and find more information on the mysterious arsehole--
"You still want me, though," Draco pointed out, bending to let Scorpius down.
here?!" the brunet practically squeaked, burrowing his flaming face into his palms. He was sitting cross legged now, covers bunched unpleasantly about his entire lower body.
"It must be the blondeness," Draco said, "Ta, Pansy. Come on," he added this bit addressing Harry as he tugged him along.
Ron's blue eyes are wide and looking at him in a way that makes him wonder if he's grown another head. The third member of the trio continues fervently jotting down names on her list, her sad apple pie lying cold and forgotten in front of her. Lunch time should really be renamed 'mucking about because it's the only time of the day you can avoid doing your work and feel alright about it' time.
What's a 'Muggle'? The way the blond practically spit the word out leads Dudley to believe it's not a very nice thing to be.
their fingers had to touch right then. There were no errant sparks of electricity, Harry noted, but the part of his hand that had met with Malfoy's seemed to retain the lingering ghost of his touch for several moments afterward.
With an air of finality, the connection fizzled out, taking Harry's heart with it. Dejected, he scuffed the toe of his sneaker against the mirror-like surface of the floor.
what he was doing here? What a pillock,” he groans as he looks back at the salon. A sizeable lineup has accumulated outside the building, and many of them appear to be in the first stages of lightening their hair. What a mess.
"Merlin above, the blondes have got him wrapped around the ends of their silky pale hairs," Ron wails.
"I know what you did that day, Malfoy," Harry allowed himself to smirk down at the other man, "I know exactly what you did in the Slytherin locker room."
It took a long while for the tiny house elf to open the door of Malfoy Manor.

He tried to think of how it would be, if he and Malfoy were eachother's boyfriend in the present day. He imagined them doing normal, boyfriendly things, like getting caught by a parent without it being a nil operation on Harry's end, or Lucius Malfoy and the possible risk of a stray Cruciatus on Malfoy's.
“Theo said what!”
"Gremly has Master Draco's best interests in mind, and according to those interests, Gremly is suggesting Aurors Weasley and   Watson to leave before they see something they very much do not want to."
"I don't
"Fuck, look at you," Harry hissed, mussing his hair again, before reclaiming it in his fist, "
Next, his wizarding radio blares up, indicating that it is not, in fact, 11 AM at all. It's actually 8:30 in the morning, and a lovely vacation sleep-in wasted all because Draco couldn't be arsed to turn his alarm off. Or close the window. And to top it all off is the most ridiculous of news segments coming from the drasted thing:
," Watson pointed out.
He must have touched his sweet spot, because Malfoy suddenly jerked hard, eyes rolling back into his skull and lips curving up into a dopey little smile. "Oooooh-" he groaned, looking- odd as it was- adorably happy, "right there."
?" the blond's lips curl in a savage sneer, unlike anything he's ever seen, far meaner than any of his friends'. The boy reminds him of Piers in the way his face is pointy and pinched with an air of distinct meanness, but he's not ratty like Piers. He looks less like he's putting on an air of haughtiness and more like he's been born that way: with a platinum spoon in his mouth.
Draco's, Lucius observes with a huff. He allows the hems of his dressing robe to plop back to the carpeted floor as he twirls in his palms the snakehead cane that encases his wand.
"Mate!" he yelps, immediately jumping to his feet and starting to pace the room like a madman. Harry's smile doesn't waver in the slightest.
"Nasty," Harry said fondly, grabbing him firmly by the sides of his face and tipping it upwards while simultaneously forcing him to crouch a bit, "Open up."
"Cheers," the man nodded, before he was pushed rudely out of the way by a rather dishevelled Malfoy.
Harry expected to have felt something, anything at all, at the knowledge of having been promoted to such a high rank in the corps. The desolate state of his prophesied private life however, prevented him from such thoughts.
Harry did not allow himself to get his hopes up at the brief display of love and wellness in this dystopian household. Rightfully so, it seemed, because Teddy was standing at the kitchen door, the baby still in his arms and an anxious look on his face. Harry was sure his godson had had to take matters into his own hands and had sent little Rosie down to break the argument up.
Malfoy pecked him sweetly (O Merlin!) on the lips in response, and extracted Harry's hand from where it was carding delicately through his baby-fine blond hair. Their fingers laced together as if it were second nature.
Blinking twice in succession, he shook the disdainful and eerily Malfoy-esque voice out of his head. Cor, he had to be going mad.
Lucius coughs again, and pushes aside a small frame that lay face down on his desktop.
Smiling, Harry obliged, spitting roughly into Draco’s pretty hole before bending low over it.
The door flew open.
"Oh for God's sakes, stop ogling my boyfriend!" Harry cried.
Thus, with Narcissa currently indisposed and completely unbothered about the situation at the hands of a strawberry mimosa ("Oh, Lucius, darling let the boy a live a little. I'm sure it will turn out to be a fleeting crush and nothing more."), Lucius sits in his study, anxiously toying with a toucan feather quill, waiting for his son to bring his illicit lover to his bed. He could, of course, confront Draco verbally beforehand, but who was to guarantee that would work at all? Or that Draco would even tell him the truth?
. Who says that?"
Harry pondered over this for a moment, but inspiration only struck him once he was passed by not one, but two sweaty, teenaged Weasley twins, both brandishing beaters' bats and wide grins.
please enjoy! ^^
It was a frustrated sleep that took over him, but the darkness proved to be a much needed reprieve regardless.
Auror in charge of the Slytherin's weekly checkup, which in turn meant that Malfoy was the only Death Eater ("ex") that he had to check on.
"And I DON'T LIKE EAVESDROPPERS," he says a fair bit louder before dropping his tone again, "but Malfoy? Ridiculous."
Draco's palms were splayed firmly over his back, fingers spread wide so as to feel as much of the brunet as he possibly could. They trembled, and Harry smoothed his own arms over the side of his neck, the line of his shoulders and the silk of his flaxen hair. Over and over and over again.
Draco struggled against his restraints, the conjured rope digging into the soft skin of his wrists. There was no doubt it would chafe. Damn. His legs, too, were bound securely to the legs of the remarkably uncomfortable wooden chair he was forced to sit in.
Harry did, do something, that is. Bending over Malfoy’s sweet arsehole, he pried his fingers out of it and lowered his mouth instead.
Harry, to his utter mortification, was not only
"So I was thinking... we could get Malfoy to wear one of the shirts with the poofy sleeves!" Hermione calls out victoriously, "he's awfully skinny, and-"
Malfoy's eyes fluttered open at last, and what Harry saw in them, or lack thereof, made him reconsider some of his earlier comments.
What?
"And we're inviting everyone from all kinds of Houses!" she says cheerfully, jotting the idea down onto a bit of parchment lest it abandons her.
But Number Twelve... Number Twelve was dusty. The halls were a bit damp-smelling, they were mostly a disgruntling shade of maroon and Kreacher had not greeted him at the door again today, as per custom. But it was quiet- and none of the furniture was making subtle-unsubtle hints about marriage at twenty-one, and that was
How had he ever survived without this?
"It's always big Auror Potter for you, isn't it? Too high and mighty to bend down and spend time with his insignificant little family?"
Malfoy looked significantly more skittish as he flipped through the journal now, fingers jittering as he flew past every page adorned with Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry. Like an amateur criminal in the act, his eyes kept darting to the door, the walls and the vast bookcase before returning to his twisted masterpiece of a picture book.
The aforementioned Plan-B that Draco has in mind, is to buy himself a brand-new array of headwear. Who said self-preservation can’t be sexy? It’s practically Slytherin’s motto, anyway.
"Come off it Ron, please? It'll be such a fantastic way to burn old bridges and build new ones! Possibly nice ones. With lovely colour-shifting streetlights. Overlooking a gorgeous blue sea, perhaps..." Hermione sighs, euphorically, while somehow continuing to write on her parchment.
how it is for me, Gin."
A suffocating fear took over Harry's senses. "I'm not," he stammered at the Grim. Cleared his throat. Tried again, "I'm not a complete bastard in the future, am I?"
Bending himself at the waist in front of the vanity, he braced himself against the edge of the low dressing-table in front of it. He stuck his arse out far enough to show off his lovely little hole, as well as a glimpse of his soft, pink sac.
a name I haven't heard for a while around here," Ron says, amused, and a flustered Harry grapples around on the cluttered bedside tabletop for his glasses.
The blond then quickened his pace, walking briskly into a room that looked to be a study of some sort. After a lingering look at his wand, he cast a silencing spell and a locking charm at the door in quick succession. Harry's cock had certainly recognized that particular combination of spells, and began its rise to attention.
story). But he will not- absolutely will not tolerate his son, proud heir to the Malfoy line and fortune,
He shuddered at the force of it, barely able to keep his eyes open long enough to watch the thick, seemingly endless ropes of Malfoy's cum spurt onto the lovely green shirt he had on. Never heard the way he sighed after he'd come down from his high, lonely once again without his imaginary lover. Never noticed the way the world around him swirled into darkness.
Once approaching the heavy oak doors, he raps on one with his knuckles- once, twice, "Daddy?"
"I'm starving. And this disgusting hovel barely has anything decent for me to eat!"
Grey eyes rolled back into his skull and he- Harry could not believe he was witnessing this with his own two eyes- he
His own eyes, apparently: Draco had only seen it about three times but it had been quite evident that it was a tiny little painting of a... somewhat buff Potter in his underwear. Jesus H. He really doesn't want to know anything about it, and Lucius, thankfully, does not seem inclined to share.
“I’m happy to hear that,” Draco whispered back, his voice deep and husky, like the first sip from a bottle of firewhiskey. A nimble hand rose to curl at the base of Harry’s neck, tugging gently at the soft curls that resided there. The smile on Draco's lips was one that Harry could feel against his skin.
before. Who was to say he'd be welcomed into Malfoy's home with open arms after years of near anonymity?
Ron snorted, "Yeah. Jumped off a six storey bridge chasing a dark wizard. Came out all right but Kingsley's let him off for a week for violating rules of safety or something," he scratched his head, "didn't think about the fact that someone else'd be assigned to Malfoy though."
“Excuse me!” Draco says. He very well can’t outright insult the man, given the fact that his friend Theodore is currently going out with him. They’ve been friends since they were in nappies, in fact, the child whose head he’d been bashing in, in the photo on Father’s desk was Theodore. He could hardly ditch the man simply because he liked to stick his cock in questionable orifices; Gryffindors, to be exact.
He did not need to wonder long, though, for Malfoy paused with a hand on his hip, thinking. Once he'd decided on whatever he had, he threw one of the towels to the floor (where it conveniently vanished), and strolled his way over to a handsome dresser.
"I want you to marry me, Ginny," he made his way to the bathroom, "Why? Because we're in love."
"Hermione Point. Nice," Harry acknowledges, and Ron ducks his head in thanks, "and no! That's bollocks."
“Oi, Malfoy! Come to the wrong store?”
The wizarding radio plays the final lines of her favourite song.
"Are you Harry's boyfriend?" he blurts out sincerely, and Malfoy's lip curls. He may not be terrified of the blond's very presence anymore, but shouldn't have been stupid enough to assume he's harmless.
. A small whimper escaped the blond and he rubbed himself against his pristine sheets, still turning pages rapidly.
"Moving on," Draco says uneasily, "I came here to discuss the contents of this letter I recieved earlier today, via a very rude owl."
The Muggle lights in the kitchen flickered on, bathing the room in the sort of fluorescent whiteness that you simply couldn't achieve with candles. He cringed at the crumbs on the floor that grew far more visible in the light, but was quickly rid of the emotion as the first little brown head toddled into the room.
"Mister Harry Potter is not being seen," the spirit informed him, "He is being invisible and transparent like the dwellers of the afterlife, only for tonight."
He wanted to see Malfoy again, he knew. The Grim probably knew. Hell, maybe all the Spirits of the Afterlife knew- but Harry wouldn't put it into words no matter the provocation.
He quickly realizes, however, that he was really quite hasty in deciding to be
The door opened softly, and in walked future-Harry.
As he takes a few assertive strides into the store, however, he realizes the interior is not what it should be. Gone are the polished marble floors and Corinthian columns, the scarce display of actual products that allow the tailor shop to appear very obviously upscale. Instead, Draco seems to be standing inside a well-established yet ordinary shop.
"Must've been the whiskey," Harry murmured, toddling over to the bathroom whilst promising himself, for the twenty-ninth time, that he was never to drink again.
The blond cast a surreptitious glance at the Gryffindor locker room before striding into his own with a grace that Harry honestly envied a bit. He and the Elf followed Malfoy into the now deserted Slytherin lockers, where said teenager had already chucked his shirts off and thrown them into a handsome little laundry hamper.
Draco stared quietly at Harry, grey eyes darting over his face. "What?" Harry asked, starting to feel a little uncomfortable.
"Potter's on leave right?" Watson asked, "Did something stupid again?"
The remainder of his thought remained unspoken as he and the Grim floated behind Malfoy during his walk.
By the time he was in his pyjamas and slipping under the covers, he'd gone through dozens of proposals in his head, each growing more passive aggressive than the previous.
Cursing softly and repeatedly, Malfoy peeked at the door again before jostling his arms into the sleeves of the silky garment. A sticky noise sounded from him briefly separating his bare arse from the leather upholstery, smoothing the overlong shirt over his buttocks and under the tops of his thighs.
"Come on," he said, pulling out and tugging Draco up by his hair, "get up. Sit where I told you to. And..." he paused to allow a shaky Draco to sit down on the toilet seat, "open up."
Dudley could not have been less interested in their... friendship dilemma.
now, Weasel- hey!" the prat interrupts himself when Harry reprimands his teasing with a sharp smack to his bum, "It's true! He wouldn't look away! What's he doing here anyway?"
Faster than wind, he pulled his strings loose and slid his trousers down to his thighs- no underpants- revealing a sight much like Harry felt at present: a cock flushed red, positively bursting with blood and jutting out beautifully from a thatch of springy blond coils.
’s. “I want you, Draco. I want you so much- I want your, your beautiful face and your,
instead of
Slowly as ever, Malfoy opened his eyes again and slid out of bed. He was completely naked, which did not come as so much of a surprise to Harry as it irked him. It meant Malfoy and his amazing talking lump had had sex together.
thank you once again, sweet!
His words made heat pool and swirl in Harry's gut. He smirked, "We'll see about that. What
There comes a ridiculous amount of noise from behind the doors before his father's voice calls, "Come in."
speaking?"
'sexy dream'," the brunet groans and lies back down. He's still in his boxers (sleepwear, he says to outsiders, lest the Prophet catch wind of it and have a field day. God knows they wouldn't hesitate to make a front page spread titled 'High and Mighty Potter Wears Tighty Whities To Bed!') so he's technically allowed, by law, to burrow back into his wonderful, warm duvet and forget about the world. He resists the temptation, "The worst dream. A nightmare of astronomic proportions."
"Probably," his friends add in unison.
"You lot really need to stop doing that out of the blue," he grumbled, pouting, "it's really inconsiderate. And disconcerting."
With a groan, he hoists himself out of the beanbag in front of the monitor, tossing his PS2 controller aside carelessly. The door creaks only slightly when he eases it open and tiptoes down the hallway. He's perfected his stealth technique, of course, from the times he and Piers have snuck out late and stolen Dad's car out of the garage and into the town.
"Alright," Malfoy grumbled nonchalantly. All was silent for two whole beats, before the blond practically screeched into the phone, "HOLD ON, YOU SAID
"Shouldn't we be giving him some privacy? You know, for his, uh," Harry said most articulately while painfully aware that him ogling this man's arse unawares to him was the very opposite of allowing him privacy. Still, he watched as Malfoy spelled his book open, naked as the day he was born. His shoulder-blades jutted out nicely, and his broad back looked strong without taking the leanness away from his physique. Two perfect globes of arse rested below his pinched waist, and Harry wondered if they were as soft as they looked. He was loathe to admit to anyone that he wanted desperately to sink his teeth into the fleshy mounds of Malfoy's bubble-butt. No, he was going to be keeping that thought to himself, thanks.
"Is Harry home?"
, Harry thought, shocked at the private musings of his own treacherous mind. He'd forgotten all about them, however, when Malfoy kicked his trousers off entirely and spread his legs wide open, pale limbs parting like the red sea to expose the puckered little ring of flesh hiding behind his lovely bollocks.
"This...?" the two look at eachother again, "Is Malfoy."
Future-Harry's head snapped up the second the word 'whore' started to form on Ginny's lips. His eyes came alive, even more than they had around the kids, but with plain fury instead of a smile.
It was a wonder Malfoy's secret had been able to stay as one for so long, and Harry wondered how their fates would have played out if he'd figured it out back then. Perhaps they would've had more than just their awkward non-greetings at Tesco.
No one quite knew why, but it wasn't bothering anybody: rumor has it that Malfoy was a right nightmare, not that Ron knew. He'd never gotten Malfoy.
And on that note, Malfoy came, white shots of his seed spurting onto his fancy bedsheets in thick strings and globules. His whole body shuddered with bliss and twitched with sensitivity as Harry's thrusts only sped up, and soon after, he was coming as well, deep into
friends?"
"Gah!" Malfoy cries out, retracting his hand from the afforementioned curls as if they burned him. The motion, unfortunately results in him toppling over the edge of his bed and onto the floor in an extremely undignified heap of bare limbs.
Harry blinked, very calmly, up at a ridiculously chiselled man. Said man had blue eyes, and dark hair that curled at the edges like Scorpius'. His nose was slightly upturned.
He didn't bother to hide his moan as Draco pulled back and sunk down again. Harry's cock hit the back of his throat, the slick heat of Draco's mouth madly erotic around him. He shut his eyes briefly, but promptly reopened them because he
Harry turns to the enchanted window with a huff, squinting as the sunlight stings his eyes, "Half a Hermione Point for articulacy. And I don't know what you're talking about." But he has a feeling that he does know, and that's a concerning thought on its own.
"Look at him!" Lucius exclaims, all but shoving the portrait of a- yes that's Potter half naked, all right. And he's rubbing up quite suggestively against an old broomstick model, "Does this look like Harry Potter to you?"
"Dada! Papa!"
"Fuckfuckfuck Draco-" groaned the man who was
Harry proceeded to forget himself, undoing his far-too-tight trousers with fervour and shoving a rough palm into his pants, fingers connecting with the damp heat of his-
"Fuck," Harry cursed, stomping over to his bed in the darkness and flopping down onto the soft mattress of it. He was well aware that the vision had been fake. Malfoy secretly harbouring major hots for him? Him, as in Harry? Impossible.
With no small amount of effort, the blond manages to slip into one of his many silk dressing robes- not before casting another disdainful look towards his
In dark brown and beige colors, however, it was still very drab as far as interior design went. He found himself thinking about Malfoy's stylish flat in London, where he'd seen him ride a dildo with Harry in mind. It felt like ages had passed since he'd seen that particular vision.
Oh it was traumatic all right.
“He seemed awfully desperate to get his hair dyed,” Hermione says thoughtfully, “I’m almost certain it was because of your ‘Blonde Thing’ as Ron called it. I could hardly believe it, I mean could you imagine Malfoy being anything
"I'm an adult, you bumbling idiot. I can do whatever I want," he turns back to the cabinets, rummaging through one before clicking his tongue and banging it shut.
--after a good night's sleep, of course.
"Star... wars?" Malfoy snaps, and the suddenness of it frightens Dudley to bits, "Your cousin- does he carry the centaur gene in his blood?"
What he sees in the room is, well, shocking. And makes him think.
on his tastebuds and God, he was eating Malfoy. He was making out with his arse and he
, morning indeed, Jacobson," came the slight sound of Malfoy's rumbling voice, heavy with sleep. Shamefully, the blond's gravelly tone shot straight down to Harry's errant cock, which gave an enthusiastic twitch at the return of its new favourite person. "Good, however, it is not," Malfoy continued, "pray tell me: for what reason have you decided to rouse me at the ungodly hour of... eight?"
"Mmm, yes- oh, you know exactly what to do with those hands, don't you, you naughty little thing? Play with yourself all the time do you, hmm? Do you think of me when you do it, Al?"
"Put it in me," he whispered rather loudly, bucking his hips up into his fist and sticking his fingers deep into his arse.
"It seems you are in luck after all, Mr. Potter," he smiled back, "that will be penthouse number sixteen, Sir."
"Heavens," Draco says faintly, rubbing his eyes wearily with his pointer and middle fingers, "they've gone round the bend."
"I can't believe you're just allowing us all to be collectively tortured with poncey, frilly uniforms but decide it's time to put your foot down when it comes to inviting a kid who made one too many 'yo momma' jokes in school."
He extended his arms, and Harry gladly fell into his embrace, kissing Draco’s brow, his nose, and finally his bow-lips with fiery abandon as the blond attempted to feel him up and battle with his flies simultaneously. Even through a layer of thick denim, Harry could feel the heat of his bare skin as well as every drag of Draco's hard cock against his thigh.
(Of course he would have noticed more warning signs if it weren't for the blurring effect his anger seemed to have on, well, everything).
"You can barely see them-" says the soft whisper again, barely even a voice. She moans, "there- right there, ohhh, you've got the fattest cock i've ever seen."
Harry's heart stuttered for an honest moment, before he realized the blond was only reaching out to customize his tea. Not to say 'blast it' to self control and snatch the other man away so he could have his wicked way with him. No, if Draco Malfoy could spend Merlin knows how long into the future secretly lusting over Harry, he could surely bear to control himself in front of him right now.
Malfoy muttered with his eyes closed, as if he were saying Grace before a meal. Then, he reached into a drawer.
he'd feel safe with here, it was nancy Neville Longbottom, although the twerp would likely kill the both of them on accident whilst attempting to cast a
"Mippy," Gremly warned gravely.
Just not like this.
He whimpered while suckling on them, head bobbing as if his fingers were a cock he was ordered to suck to save his own life. All too quickly, the blond had exhausted his skin of his rival's essence and he pulled off with an obscene wet pop.
Malfoy hissed, fisting a hand roughly in his sweat-loosened hair, "Yeah, you wanna, wanna touch me down there? You wanna finger my arsehole, Potter? Know you'd like that."
. He wanted that for himself, he wanted it.
"The babe," it said, addressing the infant in Teddy's arms, "and..."
"Okay, Vicky was bad," Harry admits tightly, "but-"
Harry shoots him a venomous look out of the corner of his eye, "He attempted to murder the Headmaster and smuggled dozens of people from the- dark side- past high level magical security who killed him in his stead."
Ron had no idea how Malfoy's face (Malfoy! That was Malfoy!) retained its... lewd expression while one of his most disliked school rivals was watching him in the midst of getting his arse plowed. And to add to that, the one who was
"Close your mouth," he told him softly, silver eyes gleaming as he smiled, "it's unbecoming of you."
The dim, slightly musty hallways of Number Twelve were a welcome reprieve from the chaos of having to answer to questions about marriage, marriage,
!" he growls, and up close, he's infinitely more terrifying. His eyes are like molten steel, and currently flashing savagely at him. He's an inch or so shorter than Dudley, but he still manages to look at him down his nose by tilting his white head back. His skin is perfectly unblemished, and in the face of his panic, Dudley wonders if he uses the M-word to keep himself looking good.
The intuder rounds on him, eyes flashing with alarm, silver and unnatural in the moonlight. He's got white hair- no- not like Grandma Winona's, but not anything he can exactly call blond either. It covers his head in endless tufts of downy white, straight and sleek, cut short enough about his head but falling in loose strands over his brows. He's wearing a starched shirt and pressed pants, like he's going to a wedding or a funeral, and not sneaking around in an ordinary kitchen at arse o clock in the morning. What tells him for sure that he's not normal, however, is the long stick he's got pointed right at Dudley's heart. His feet go cold.
Instead of answering the question Dudley says, "Harry, who is this?" in a tone far too high and rushed.
“It’s true,” he says, more to his peers than to Draco, “Theo told me he’s always jumping to mad conclusions on his own.”
Harry walked through the doors and into the handsomely furnished lobby, feeling awkward. The dark gleaming floors were polished to a shine, the walls were ornately decorated and there was a sizeable aquarium along the wall that housed several species of colourful magical fish.
He finally stopped however, and looked at his son, eyes growing warm, "Alright then, Scorpius. Albus. Good night."
Dudley knows his mouth is open, and he doesn't bother to close it.
"Alright, remembering that made me feel better for sure," Harry informed the Elf truthfully, "could we leave n-"
Ron is thankful that he can't quite remember the precise feeling of Malfoy's silver gaze piercing into his own, lips parted in a moan: "Oh, Harry!" or "Oh, Potter!" or something of the sort.
With the slightest bit of hesitation, Draco pushes a door open and enters the far-too-large room. Lucius Malfoy sits calmly at his (very ostentatious) desk with his fingers authoritatively steepled in front of him. He's wearing a dressing robe similar to Draco's own, and his hair...
Harry’s mind is doing cartwheels while Malfoy and Dean squabble in the hat aisle of
Unfortunately, sleep did not last long, and Harry found himself awake in the dead of the night with a house elf glaring down its nose at him. Said elf was not Kreacher.
Her hair, no longer even close to flaming red, hung from her head in thin, carroty strings. Frown lines marred her face instead of smile ones, and the bags under her eyes were smudged black- whether from fatigue or makeup, Harry didn't know.
Anyway, nothing much worse than that had really happened afterwards. He and Hermione had stepped into the fireplace and Flooed to the ministry in a flurry of green flames, kissed eachother goodbye at the main floor and gone their separate ways. Like normal.
'At least most of my family is happy,' Harry consoled himself.
Malfoy panted deeply like he'd done after the fight from earlier, his body relaxing slowly and gradually as the tie came undone and the toy grew visibly more uncomfortable for him to sit on. He vanished it swiftly, and swished his wand again to rid himself and his book of bodily fluids.
"What're you doing down here, Malfoy?" Harry rubs his eyes and the blond backs away from Dudley (much to the latter's relief).
"-and hold onto your shaving charms! Anonymous acquaintances also reported hearing of the Chosen One's fetish for hair- downstairs!"
"Hullo," Harry greeted, trying and failing to keep the acidity out of his tone.
Because remember that little thing about it being the worst day of Ron's life? Well, he'd nearly forgotten about that. And bad things always catch you when you're off guard.
"Be turning your eyes over there," the spirit instructed him, and Harry considered ignoring the little menace just to spite it. Curiosity won out in the end, however, and Harry found himself looking down at two familiar heads of hair: one jet black and the other snowy white.
Suddenly, there came a muffled shout from somewhere upstairs and a thump. Ron really saw red then, forcing the elves apart, sending them toppling away from the door and onto their arses (sorry, Hermione) and charging up the stairs two at a time.
The Grim remained looking at him expectantly.
Teddy rushed over to pry the baby out of Ginny's arms and took her into his own. The smile that she gave him in return looked more like a grimace than anything Harry had ever seen.
It was true, ever since Harry had gotten Malfoy about thrice in the rotation, he'd personally requested to be the
"Look at those gorgeous freckles on you," Harry mutters, "wanna fuck you for hours."
"Mister Harry Potter will be seeing soon," the Elf said cryptically, "he must be keeping in mind that I be the Ghost of Christmas Past."
"We had to come here for a parole checkup on account of Harry's absence from work," cut in a new voice--
...!"
"So, Potter," Malfoy said conversationally, crossing a bare leg over the other and thus, throwing Harry's mind completely off topic, "to what do I owe this pleasure?"
"We talk about nothing!" the blond bellows, whipping his wand about forebodingly, "We haven't talked in days, and every time we start, you just flip me over on your dinky old bed and-!"
"No buts, Harry, you know I'm right," Ron says with an air of finality and Harry, for lack of a better thing to do, sulks back in his covers while his roommate smirks down at him like the cat that got the cream.
of 1997 that was used to relay information on current events during the war.
"Bollocks!" Malfoy's voice returned with a boom, and Harry perked up to listen to it. The man was panting like he'd returned from a jog outdoors, "I forgot to tell the bloody man to let him- shut up!- let him up, Jacobson- I told you already, it meant nothing! Take your bloody stuff and shove it up your-!"
"I'm not his
He moaned loudly when their lips touched, his body quivering under Harry's as he scrambled to get his arms around him.
"I know," Draco nods gravely, "I had anticipated we'd be sharing an opinion regarding this. Do not fret, Daddy, I'll draft up a polite refusal-"
"VANESSA THORNBERRY!!" Harry shouts, leaping out from the comfort of his bed and wrapping his arms around himself reflexively, for whatever reason. He's panting hard and searching fervently for the aforementioned woman, only to find a rumpled bed, a blurry Ron Weasley at the door and a Wizarding radio playing- you guessed it- 'Hips Don't Lie' at a tinny pitch.
They moved back into the kitchen where the children, recharged from their sugary desserts, all pounced upon future-Harry with vigour. Teddy hugged him, and passed him the baby.
“News? What news?” Harry asks with a frown. He hopes to Godric it’s not
! Oh, what a disaster he'd landed himself in!
Bobbing his head so he was fucking him with his tongue, Harry used his free hand to massage the top of the blond’s thigh, to run over the side of his flank and give his cock a teasing little
"What's a Muggle?" he asks.
to come in now. If not for the standard monitoring process then because of the suspicious information you've shared with us--"
"Charming, aren't ya?" he said lightly, but at least he'd released his jaw now. "Alright then, if you want to get down to business, we'll get down to business. Can't have the Slytherin Prince
And like magic, Harry's expression went gooey again, "Aw, it's o-
"Malfoy!" the brunet cuts him off, and all of a sudden, his hands are on his shoulders and his expression is tender, "Go back upstairs, and wait for me, alright? I'll get you your blasted salad and we can talk all you want," he says softly.
"Coming Mum!"
Maybe it's got something to do with the memory of his face soft and pliant after his orgasm, or the letters on his shirt that read "POTTER 07" in gold-- but Dudley's not very afraid of him anymore.
The two freaks turn their gazes towards Dudley slumped against the wall and sweating buckets.
"What- who cares?" the blond huffed, dragging him through a door to their left. If Harry guessed correctly, it was the powder room closest to Arabella Black's bedroom. There was no way to tell for sure though, because the door was slammed shut as soon as they were both inside, shrouding the couple in darkness. Luckily, every room in Number Twelve was now squeaky clean, thanks to one Draco Malfoy. He wouldn't accept having to fuck in a dusty room when push came to pull which, if you knew him, happened pretty much all the time.
with fervour each time he thrusted and clenching it tightly in its sweet heat each time he made to pull out. Harry saw him bite his lip, actively trying to hold back, but despite his best efforts he couldn't help but let his moans escape.
Harry's smiling at the boy's ridiculous order- it's certainly not a request- and Dudley knows that if nothing else, this was definitely proof that his cousin is truly a freak. A crazy freak.
"I'd say you ought to get out and date some more," the redhead says thoughtfully, and at the sight of Harry's scowl, adds: "except your perpetual type is Pretty, Blonde, Bitchy women. Capitalized."
There was a certain refinedness to the way he behaved. The way he moved, and spoke, and even how he looked. Of course, Harry had always known this; he had chalked it up to his snobbish upbringing, and it had made him want to do horrible things to him. While that may still be true, the impolite feelings they invoked within him now were of a completely different nature.
Bringing it close to his face with steady hands, Malfoy shut his eyes and inhaled its scent deeply. While exhaling, Harry thought he saw his delicate eyelids flutter. The blonde's body twitched almost imperceptibly, unlike his cock, which gave a hard jerk upwards at the indirect stimulation.
"We're just here for his weekly parole checkup," Watson elaborated calmly, "It's usually Auror Potter's job, but he's off today."
Merlin, he wanted to fuck him.
The Grim would have rolled its eyes if it could. Instead, it put on an expression of great disdain- for a dog, anyway- and the scene began to swirl.
"Oh!"
“Stop! Stop, Potter,” he pleaded, and Harry halted his ministrations immediately, “I’ll cum all over your hand if you keep at it like that. I need… I want your cock in me.”
Oh yes, the ethics of separating Draco from that damned pool boy in an echo of his late parents' actions. Of course, Lucius' affair had been completely justified: his lover had been a pureblood, although male, and both he and Lucius were perfectly capable of producing an heir together. Of course it was unjustified.
Their heads whip around to face eachother.
Harry had never seen Malfoy's cock in a properly flaccid state before now, and he had to admit even that was pretty. It had a certain heaviness to it that looked lovely in light pink against his ivory skin.
Gracefully, he turns around to face the group. There’s nothing unusual about Potter’s expression as his eyes light up in recognition. Perhaps it’s because the lovelorn tightness of his jaw has been ever present in Draco’s vicinity. He’s never known him any other way.
"He's a... friend. And he's--"
"Fuck you, Malfoy, you wouldn't know a fair game if it spanked your arse and called you a fairy," fifteen year old Harry snapped back, and Harry mentally high-fived himself for a comeback well delivered. He, too, looked alarmingly young in this moment: all knobbly knees and lanky height. His hair was just as untameable as ever, and the shadows under his eyes reminded Harry of darker times. Seeing himself so small, he wondered how he'd managed to brave the weight of all his responsibilities on his two narrow shoulders.
"You really need to stop doing that," he grumbled, and sighed in irritation when yet another exhausted player bustled right through him; a Slytherin this time.
That night, Dudley hears the soft banging noises again and asks himself: sex or stealing food? He decides to be optimistic and go with the latter, and tiptoes down the stairs much like yesterday. There he is, Malfoy, peering into cupboards again, but this time, he's in a large red jersey and silky pyjama pants instead of his funeral clothes.
"I had to work overtime," future-Harry retorted, his tone slow and firm, as if he were speaking with one of the young children in the next room. The unspoken 'obviously' rung in the silence between his words, "being Head Auror isn't easy work."
Floating closer to the blond, Harry studied him. Malfoy lay on the right side of his bed, while the left remained occupied by a lump that Harry had to force himself not to feel jealous of. After all, his own choices were the ones to land them in their respective situations. Future-Harry, with his loveless marriage, his all-consuming job and his absent son. Ginny, with the same lack of love, and a bitterness that had seeped into her blood itself. And Malfoy, with this-
'But he's not following me around and being a menace. And it's not like we don't know eachother already, so...'
"s fill the air and Dudley wonders if falling from a two-ish storey tree is fatal.
"W- what?" Harry asked it, because this spirit was a total arsewipe, and he wouldn't put it past him to have read his thoughts only to make a scathing remark.
son is practically living with that Slytherin whore anyway!"
There's a grey lump where his cousin sleeps under the covers, and it's uneventful for a while. Dudley's about to leave when the covers shift and scuffle.
Surely this was not a normal reaction to have in case of one finding out he's got himself a stalker-- no matter how sexy of a man that stalker may be. Merlin.
Draco has his chin held high as he makes a beeline for the doors. He has no choice but to commence with Plan-B on the pathway to evading Potter’s perverted gaze. Granted, he is feeling pretty good about himself after the absolute number he’s done on the other man just now. It really can’t be helped that his hair quite literally refuses to be damaged; that’s quality for you! He is, however, still going to blame his predicament on Potter, because why ever would he deny himself the pleasure?
He was led to a sitting room furnished in pleasantly cool blue tones. Malfoy gestured towards the sofas, silently offering Harry a seat, which he took. Malfoy sat on a loveseat towards his right, before gazing resolutely out of the large glass doors that brought sunlight into the room.
Wizarding artwork from that time period?" Hermione says, seemingly in one breath, eyes bright and cheeks aflush.
And shoved them in his mouth. Harry might have squeaked at the suddenness and the... well, the shock of the action, but any such noise was drowned out by the guttural moan that rumbled in Malfoy's throat.
The blond, seemingly unsatisfied by what he'd seen, flopped onto his overlarge bed with a frustrated huff. A pale hand (so much like the one Harry could still see fervently pumping his cock, everytime he closed his eyes) rose up to stroke at the smooth skin of Malfoy's tummy, fingers sliding languidly over the bumps and crevices created by the muscles there. His chest was flawless and unmarred by a certain collection of curse scars, to Harry's utmost relief. His nipples were rosy pink, and peaked as of now.
"Scorpius! How did you get here so fast?" he asked exaggeratedly, and bounced him in his arms causing him to giggle, "Did you fly, like Auntie Gin'? You did, didn't you!"
“Tell me you want me-” he panted. His voice was a serenade of highs and lows, climbing to its peak every time he managed successfully to touch his prostate, “tell me- what you want to do with me. I’ve been so- awfully naughty, haven't I Potter?”
There it is again, a raspy little chorus of profanities, no louder than a distorted whisper: clear signs of a rookie silencing spell. If the walls of the Burrow were any thicker, Molly wouldn't have even heard it.
"It's a person with no magic," is what Harry answers, at the same time as Draco says: "A horrible disgrace to the universe. So severely inferior to our Great Kind that it sickens me just to be the presence of one."
"Merlin," Draco gasped, drawing away from him once again. Grey eyes were blown wide with lust, and they bored into Harry intensively, drinking in every detail of his face with the fervour of a man stranded in the dessert. His large, warm palms rubbed wide circles into the small of Harry's back- searching, feeling- and after a moment of that, his eyelids fluttered shut. "Merlin," he whispered again, like a prayer.
One: that is
be a better father to his only offspring. Ever since he's been rid of the dark fog that the second coming of the Dark Lord had passed over his mind, he's been able to revert to the doting father that he'd been throughout Draco's first ten years in the world.
Draco looked up eagerly, pink lips parting and tongue rolling out in anticipation. He held his shirt open with his hands as Harry jerked himself off till he came with a shout, his eyes screwed shut.
"Uncle Harry-y-y-y-y!" came an excited cry, followed by the sounds of tiny feet bounding down the hall.
He hovered closer in disregard of his manners, and found exactly what he had subconsciously hoped for. Pictures of himself.
tell me you'll let me do what I think you are."
Since the situation cannot possibly get any worse, Draco breaks the wax seal of the drasted letter and peers at the gold lettered contents of it.
Harry could only nod as he stepped into Malfoy's home and closed the door behind himself. The decor of the place was, as he vaguely noted, similar to the bedroom he'd seen last night. Of course, he could have made a more accurate comparison if he weren't too busy studying the way the silky fabric of Malfoy's robe had moulded itself to the cleft of his pert arse.
"I want you."
.” He complied with a smile, allowing to himself be dragged up the length of his lover’s back. He adjusted their positions so that he had his chin hooked over Draco’s shoulder, and their eyes met in the mirror- green on silver.
“Weasley. Congratulations on the wedding,” he offers graciously. The redhead honestly looks like he’s not sure what to do with the comment. “I was shopping around for hats, as you can probably tell, before you began to antagonize me within earshot.”
infatuated! It was a healthy rivalry-!"
Suddenly, he realized just how strongly he wished he were with Malfoy instead right now.
No, in this scenario, Draco Malfoy did have his face towards Ron, but in orgasm rather than anger or even recognition.
The line of saliva on his cheek cooled as he watched Draco halt before his vanity. He seemed to analyze his reflection in the mirror for a brief moment- the flawless skin, the rosy cock that stood impossibly hard between his thighs- before his gaze flicked to meet Harry’s in the mirror.
"Fucking
Wails of mortification sounded from the other side of the closed door and Malfoy's face bore a tiny half smile. Harry had still been laughing from Malfoy's comment, before he realized it was definitely more literal than it had sounded.
"No, it's about your 'fondness'," Ron air quotes this bit, the devil, "towards PWBBs!"
It stilled obediently, and Harry allowed himself to marvel in the differences between them. The coarse dark hairs on Harry’s knuckles versus the pale creaminess of Draco’s strong, but bony wrist, spattered with translucent blond hair. Two of his fingers remained, unmoving within the pucker of his sphincter. A third, however- his ring finger- had slipped out of the slick opening, and rested passively against a smooth buttock.
Someone chuckled, thank the Lord, and the charm was removed one wand at a time. Lo and behold, even in the face of a million blinding rays of light, Draco was correct in his approximation. Eleven students, all in scarlet robes surrounded him with Potter standing at the centre directly in front of him. He was smirking, arms crossed over his chest in a way that made his biceps bulge most
Molly startles and jumps away from the door at the loud voice that echoes over from down the hall. A door is flung open, revealing a sleep-rumpled Ginny Weasley still in her puffskein pyjama pants and muggle band t-shirt that she went to bed in. She groggily pads over barefoot, missing Molly's horrified expression but not the creaky floorboard. The rustling in the twins' room only grows more frantic at all the noise.
The two men exchanged a bewildered look at the weirdly brash elf's tone. You'd expect a Malfoy house elf who's
"Hey there, Lily."
Dudley shouldn't be surprised that it's Malfoy, not really, but he can't help the bewilderment that tends to overwhelm him when he sees that mean little face screwed up in pleasure and staring up at his cousin with starry eyed
"I want to go where Al is," Harry told it, and the swirling stopped immediately.
Ginny stood up with a huff and stalked out the door. Harry would have greatly preferred to stay in the kitchen with the children, but the Grim pulled him along to the entryway where Ginny stood sternly with her arms crossed.
"Malfoy's already seventeen, so he's allowed," Harry straightens up with the appropriate foodstuffs he'd need for a ghastly salad dish.
"I thought nobody cared about wrinkly clothes," Harry chuckled, and was met with a half hearted glare.
"Merlin," the boy sobbed, "Lord, fuck, fuck me now, Potter I need your- in me I need to- I'm loose, I'm so empty, fill me up! Wanna, want you t- stuff me- full of your cock-" he was two knuckles and two fingers deep inside of himself now, back arching off the bench while his socked feet curved and his toes wriggled against the ground. They were printed with little dancing apples of different colours-
There were seven or eight of them in total, all of different sizes, but the same childish excitement bubbling within them. Harry couldn't possibly study them all at the same time, however the children all had certain features that stood out to him. A happy girl with wild brown hair who was giggling up a storm; a slight ginger toddler whose gaze was heavy with sleep, likely due to a belated afternoon nap; a young girl who looked intelligent, and held herself with purpose- but whose eyes sparkled with joy. All members of the rowdy band of children heaved themselves up into the waiting chairs, watching the door expectantly for the adult who was bound to arrive any moment. Harry suspected she was a certain redhead he knew.
-and kiss and kiss him till his lips lost their sensitivity and Potter's face was flushed blossom-pink from the attention.
Harry had never paid rapt attention to his own eyes (for it seemed like a fickle, Malfoyish thing to do), but even to him, they seemed unusually void of life.
Harry, oblivious to the blond's apparent dilemma, grinned at the clerk like an overexcited puppy.
His acrid tone makes Dudley shrink back a little more, "s-so... you're another one of the-
Harry did not tell him that he didn't mind at all. That he'd rather have it shouted from the rooftops and printed in the tabloids: that Harry Potter was completely gone for Draco Malfoy, and that he liked it. That he liked feeling like this: wanting something so desperately; something he practically already had, but was just barely out of reach.
Ron's anger comes seemingly out of nowhere at the git who was given yet another chance at redeeming himself, which he'd blown.
i really hope you like it! TT-TT it has three chapters, which i will be posting gradually
"Where were you guys?" she asked, hands on her hips and a playful expression on her face. "I had assumed people
"Mister Draco Malfoy be starting now," the Elf said prophetically, and before Harry could utter so much as a 'huh?', Malfoy shot a quick glance at the entrance, brought his contaminated fingers to his face again-
His jaw flexed as he prepared to snap a retort at her-
“Potter, it would do you well to stay away from my Father with that little predicament of yours,” he teased, “Who knows what could go down!” Truthfully, the advice is aimed half towards himself. Now that he’s rediscovered Father’s odd fixation on that semi-erotic painting of Potter, he wonders if he’ll see his own son as a rival in love, even if it really is a painting of the late James Potter. Father can hardly go bang the man’s grave, or he’d have done so already! Potter is really the only option left for him (and the two of them do look rather similar do they not? Draco will have to sneak into the study and check after this fiasco is over).
"Good Godric," Harry whispered in, oh, all right:
Harry realized he'd been hoping to have been mistaken, that perhaps it wasn't really about him. Maybe this was some other... strange Malfoy idiosyncrasy that he'd never caught wind of, and the blond simply went round tasting people's sweat on a day to day basis at random. The sound of his name on Malfoy's lips, however, drove that idea to the bin.
, Potter!"
If anything, future-Harry looked even worse than Ginny did. His face was almost skeletal with fatigue, and the deep purple rings under his eyes rivalled his wife's with fervour.
"What are you
While he fiddled with the buttons of the shirt, Malfoy propped his bare feet up on his fancy table, allowing Harry a clear view of the cock and balls between his long legs. As well as the lovely little hole underneath.
"Your obsession with Pretty, Blonde, Bitchy Women!" Ron exclaims, thoroughly exasperated, "And Malfoy's one of em! That's why you're being so-"
"We've talked about this, Malfoy. He's a Muggle."
Dear Mr. Draco Malfoy, and family:
(Ah, so that was warning number two for Ron. Oh well.)
Darkness.
Prefects Granger and Weasley grinned at that, their faces half shrouded in shadow and lit ominously with amber firelight. Warm tones were Draco's absolute least favourite for they not only clashed with his colour palette, but they also made frequent appearances in random Gryffindor hostage situations, as was currently being proven.
"No sign of 'im," he told her as he nestled the baby's head into the crook of his neck. His tone was pitiful, and Ginny's back was stiff as she summoned the plates.
"You know I can see fine up close, baby," Harry countered with a suggestive leer (EW!), and winced as the blond slipped the spectacles onto his face.
Harry pauses before 'Malfoy' thoughtfully, and Dudley can't believe his eyes when his cousin reaches a hand out and
"Potter," Malfoy drawled fondly, and somewhat teasingly, and reached for the round glasses tossed haphazardly on the bed somewhere next to his ribs, "can you even see me now, without these on?"
fucking Higgs.”
"Yes, I am," he says softly, and there's certainly a flush in his cheeks as he makes his way up, no doubt, to Harry's bedroom.
A quick tempus charm told him it was still too early an hour for human wakefulness, but sleep was the last thing on Harry's mind what with Malfoy taking up all that space up there.
"Uh," Harry said articulately, before giving himself a mental shake. No, for this, he'd have to turn his charm up to 70. (He'd have turned it up to a hundred but unfortunately, he doubted it could possibly go that high. Harry's charm was inconveniently limited to an estimated level of 72.)
Draco leaves the house feeling understandably vexed. His father's inexplicable revelations, the prospect that all Potter's were perhaps helplessly attracted to blondes...
Malfoy made a sudden noise in the back of his throat, and Harry's gaze jumped immediately to the cleft of his arse, now raised high in the air.
Ron smirks at Harry, who scowls right back, "And what's a P.W.B? Do I even want to know?"
When the blond began to finger himself open, almost gentle in contrast with everything else he'd been doing so far, Harry lost his composure and moaned aloud. The breath stopped in his throat and the entire universe shrank into the puckered hole between Malfoy’s legs.
Molly decides they've had enough fun for now. It's not like her giving the couple a stern talking-to will make them stop or anything.
(In Harry's defense, it was now eight thirty, a far cry from the far less godly six o' clock, which was when he himself had woken up. Containing himself had proved to be increasingly difficult in the hours that followed).
There was him, glowering at the lens after his first night out drinking. There again, Harry found himself blinking into the flash of the camera in a sheepish manner, lips pressed close together in an awkward smile. Then there was one of those strange Hogwarts photos: taken from behind while photo-Harry scratched his head idly, unawares.
The scene began to speed up like the very first one had, when he'd fought with Malfoy. Harry watched as the children laughed and chattered along with Teddy, while they sped through appetizers, pasta and started on dessert. None of Ginny's smiles reached her eyes, and future-Harry never came.
"He had hazel eyes," Lucius says huffily, "and better hair by a landslide. And he called me Lucy. Sometimes."
“Well, what was it?” Even with the dubious nature of the broadcast, surely there can’t have been something deluded enough to have given Malfoy the impression that… what had he even been on about? White blonde bush? Bush… “Ohhh God, tell me they didn’t…”
"Can't you just-" Malfoy choked out, removing his hand from his mouth and reaching down towards his arsehole with it, "touch me, Potter? Please? Pleasepleaseplease-?"
flying
"Entirely too much penis on him, I presume," Hannah Abbot mentions, passing by once again.
Harry winces. Yes, Vicky had been a grave mistake, especially when she'd gotten a server at
Harry's never wanted someone more in his life. Not Cho, certainly not Ginny; never before had he wanted to taste every inch of a person's skin, touch every mound and dip of their flesh with his fingers and press himself bodily against their naked form. He wanted to suck Malfoy, and to bury himself to the hilt within him. Wanted to fuck him silly and sloppy and into incomprehension. Wanted to kiss, lick and bite at every bit of skin presented to him and make him shudder and cum like he'd done in the locker rooms away from everyone he knew.
was a question that had just begun to tickle his mind before he found himself suddenly outside of the musty locker room.
"No! Of course we're not!"
"Liar," Harry declared, and a smirk twisted his lips once again. Draco decided that, at this point perhaps his carcass might be better in a kebab after all. It was a far cry better than a paper bag full of unwashed meat, which was looking to be a far more likely possibility now.
"Love- oh yeah- love having my cock inside you- baby- oh yeah, oh, oh, so hot so tight
"He had a thing for blondes," Lucius says wistfully, "until that ginger girl showed up and
"Auror... Watson. Hi," Harry flushed deeply, although thoroughly shrouded in heavy silk sheets, "Oh, man."
"Yes," Harry replied as well as he could, through his throat that seemed to have closed up on itself, "I'll do anything you want. Anything you'd like."
your childhood infatuation, Harry Potter!"
the plowing was his absolute MOST disliked school rival, who hadn't even noticed his best friend standing at the door yet.
(Yes! That's a real thing, no matter how much you'd like to argue otherwise,
Hermione’s still giggling as she rummages in her handbag, no doubt for one of her many lists. “I think he was listening to the news this morning,” she said.
"Bollocks," is all he can say in response. Articulate speech be damned when he's naked and on the floor, in a decidedly not-kinky way.
"Er, yes, hello," Harry stammered, and winced at himself, "Harry Potter, here to see... umm, Draco Malfoy?"
“Get up, Potter,” Draco commanded, softly. Harry obliged, of course, and watched the blond eye him for another lingering second before climbing off the bed. Stupidly, his insecurities began to creep up on him and he wondered if this was all just an elaborate hoax to get Harry to surrender to him.
"You look so gorgeous like that," says a whispered voice, followed by a pitchy whimper, "all spread out for me."
“Draco.”
"I s'pose that's why you've failed to notice the whole Ronald Weasley that's been in my room all this time."
(He really should have got it by then).
"Let's go back to the Shack," Harry says hastily, voice growing distant over the sound of the wind; they must have opened the window"I know you hate that dump, but I'll fuck your ass open on the coffee table and it'll feel just like the first time we..."
Harry didn't argue this time, instead opting to watch the blond who had flopped back onto his back and was now panting up at the sky, right there in the dry dirt in front of the locker rooms. His chest rose, fell, rose and fell again, and Harry watched as he closed his eyes, Adam's apple bobbing prominently as he swallowed his no-doubt dry throat.
It did not take Draco long to recover. Decisively pushing Harry off his lap, he stood up, turned and walked off briskly down the hallway.
"Eurgh, Malfoy!" Potter exclaimed and, in an unprecedented move, reached out to grab his Slytherin tie. If he had been a little more daft, Draco would pucker his lips for a kiss. He wasn't though; hence he only sat stiffly in his seat while the brunet used his tie, a symbol of his House, to wipe the saliva off his face. He released it and the soiled fabric fell back in place, a sorry sight.
However, Draco only sauntered over to the wall on the far right of the room. Harry lounged on his bed, trying his best to look nonchalant while his heart pounded in his ears. He could still taste him on his tongue, could feel the phantom touch of his warm hands all over his body.
"Ron!" Harry half-shrieked, blood flooding into his cheeks as his hands scrambled for purchase on the silk sheets, trying his very best to salvage what was left of his dignity.
He exhaled, squeezing too much paste out onto his toothbrush and looking himself dead in the eye in the mirror over the sink.
"Father," Malfoy's son said with impressive bravado, "good evening! You seem to be up quite late on this fine night."
"Lucky for you, we're not quite finished yet," Draco said, as she took her time kissing the air next to Harry's cheek and cooing at Scorpius.
"Oh, it's fascinating! Imagine all the gorgeous outfits! Ron can be in some of those dashing dress robes with frills at the neck! And you too, Harry."
“Look at him, he’s overthinking in his little bimbo brain as we speak,” says one of the men. The tall one that plays ball-foot. Oh, damn it all.
," he hissed, reaching out to run a hand through Draco's sweat matted hair once, twice, before gripping it in a tight fist. "Suck me, Malfoy. Let me fuck your pretty mouth like I own it."
"No, not-"
On the other hand, Draco has been seeing this same pool boy (speculatively speaking) several and frequently repeated times over the course of the month. Lucius does not want to pressure his son into marrying someone of his father's choice, as his own parents had done to him (and oh lord, was that a
not that bad anymore. I certainly haven't talked with him."
"Of all the bumbling things!" the stranger exclaims, seemingly affronted at such an accusation.
, that bitter mouth open in a delicate gasp and that forked tongue darting out to lick his lips. Even more baffling is when Harry pushes his ridiculously-- sizeable!-- prick into that impossibly tiny hole in a single smooth thrust that can only indicate days and weeks and months of practice. Only then does it occur to Dudley that his cousin and this posh blond terror could have been fucking in his old bedroom all summer while he was none the wiser.
started trembling again, "we talked about this."
'Malfoy loves getting his arse fucked. Malfoy loves riding dick. He's a dickrider. And the dick he wants to ride is yours-'
You know whose was?
"I'll take your word for it," Watson laughs, "come on."
if you're in luck, they may even give you permission to do so but please, PLEASE do ask!
The blond was on all fours, body angled towards the door, and he maintained agonizing eye contact with Ron, steel pupils crossing and rolling in ecstasy, but never failing to cycle back to the shell shocked redhead in the doorway.
Oh Gods! Draco picks up another hat, although he’s already wearing the first one on his head. (Blood red, bowl shaped, with a short brim. Pee-ew! This would do, if you wanted to look like you’re impersonating the ex-Minister of Magic, Fudge. May his soul rest in agony.) Feeling the paranoia rise, he plops it onto his head right onto the conical top of the previous one.
He watched as Malfoy panted and gasped, his strong hands with its prominent blue veins wrapping around the bobbing appendage and furiously beating it off, "Fuckfuckfuckfuck, what I'd, oh, what I'd do with-- ohhhh right now, suck my cock, Potter. That's it. Good boooy," Malfoy babbled. Harry's less favourable body part twitched at the words, completely unprompted. The blond's eyelids were screwed shut, light eyebrows pinched tightly together while his pale pink lips were parted in a moan. He seemed to be fantasizing intensely.
Malfoy raised his hand languidly, and rapped on the doorframe twice. The noises stopped in the split second before Malfoy tugged the door open.
The blond looked more or less the same. Older, yes, but in a refined sort of way. His hair was parted smartly to the side, and the creepy blankness of his eyes somehow helped enhance his features.
Of course, hoardes of silly
“Oh, for the love of—” he groans under his breath, “not
"-is OBSESSED with fair haired babes! That's right: grab your bleaching potions, ladies! It's time to go blonde!"
"I know exactly who you were thinking of when you did whatever it was that you had done," Harry continued, raising his knees and planting them on the edge of the seat, one after the other until he was straddling Malfoy. He'd stopped breathing, his face an inch away from his own.
"Jesus," Harry gasped, shifting uncomfortably in hopes that his own erection would simply give up and leave. Perhaps utter a 'whoops, didn't mean to bother you at this hour, mate! See you later, then. Cheerio!' No such thing had happened, of course, much to the brunet's dismay.
growing age), as well as the new and wholly unexpected displays of physical affection. Draco had practically jumped out of his skin when Lucius (overwhelmed with fatherly love towards his suddenly very grown up baby boy) had first wrapped him in a warm embrace. He had then proceeded to hold his own father at wandpoint, demanding answers to personal questions and ordering him to wait before him for an hour till "the Polyjuice wears off".
"Look who finally decided to show up!"
“What- what're you gonna do?” Draco panted. His wrist lay limp in Harry’s grip, and the brunet shuffled it upwards until he had Draco’s sticky, bejewelled fingers clasped firmly in his own. He dropped a kiss onto his soft bum and smiled.
“What are you on about, Ron, you nut,” comes— yes that’s Potter!— Potter’s long-suffering reply, “It’s all your fault this shite ended up on
Gunmetal grey irises turned languidly towards the lump next to him and Malfoy blinked once- so slowly that it came out looking truly terrifying. He then did it again.
"I know, right?" Watson said, shrugging his Auror robe on, "it's like Malfoy's not even on the checkup list anymore now that Potter's all..."
