Through her cooperation with the Headmistress, Narcissa Malfoy begins the preparations to fundraise for the new independent Hogwarts.
“I’m quite sure Muggles’ eyes aren’t this big,” Draco said, summoning the bowl of popcorn right out of Harry’s hands.
of him. It would be a party, and there would be plus-ones and friends of friends. But that wasn’t what he needed.
the current progress of the castle,” he announces. “Headmistress McGonagall will now continue to lead the reconstruction efforts. Judging from Headmistress McGonagall’s ability in leading the team to rebuild Hogwarts, we look forward to a new and completed Hogwarts in the future.”
Robards finally sits down and sorts through the files. While he waits for Healer Murie’s final verdict, he still needs to figure out
They both get dressed. Harry’s quickest, and so he runs away to the house elves’ temporary kitchen tent while Draco is still in the bathroom.
Draco falls to the ground with a mess of robes and Harry Potter in his arms. Luckily the grass around in the glade is soft and Draco is sturdy. Warm familiar lips descend upon his own as their bodies press together. Draco has the presence of mind to throw a quick privacy charm around them before deepening their
“I realised you never told me what you were doing on the weekend,” Potter grumbles. “Jamie showed me the merpeople. I think they still remember me from Fourth Year.” Potter pulls out a protego badge. “I forgot to say, I think it’s cute that you’re making badges again for everyone.”
Vaisey Owler’s head perks up at the sound of his name. “Oh, Draco! You’re here! When me and the team were heading back from practice, it felt like the staircases were off…”
“I’m sorry!” Jamie says, eyes red. “I just wanted to go to the Kitchens quickly, and I didn’t see them and couldn’t get my badge out in time…”
expect Harry to suddenly head his way. Harry’s ex quickly followed him; Draco’s old colleagues took a half step back.
Nolan perks up, making a questioning sound that sounds like a cute whine. His whole body goes rigid when Mr. Malfoy (?) places a hand on his forehead.
McGonagall gives Robards and the other Auror some time to stare before leading them away to her office. Madam Pomfrey is waiting outside.
The days pass as Slytherin House settles into the new routine. After Coates’ reprimand, the Defence, and Transfiguration professors pull Draco aside in their classes to tell him off about
And there’s the gossipy looks from the general student body. How tedious. From what he can hear from their not-quiet talking, they know he’s been in to see the Aurors, and that he’s been to the Hospital Wing.
,” Pansy scowls. “I thought you were dead in some back-corridor!” She pokes at him, and her lip curls as she pulls the tattered remains of his robes apart, revealing the bare skin underneath.
Harry narrowed his eyes, shifting his legs as he pushed himself up into a sitting position. “I’m handsome!”
Malfoy agreed and smoothly took the initiative to choose and book a place. Harry was relieved to hand the task to him—Harry wasn’t a restaurant-going foodie. He only knew some big family restaurants and didn’t know any places that were suitable for two single adult friends to go to.
Harry fiddles with the fabric. “Aren’t you cold? Draco gave me these, they have woven-in warming charms. Did you all agree to dress Muggle today?”
Granger and Weasley may poison Potter’s ears against Draco, but he can trust them to keep Potter safe. And anyway, Draco can easily keep an eye on Potter from the Slytherin table.
Flitwick’s spelled voice booms down the corridor, the man himself a small figure on the very far end.
“Actually, if you could obtain the work from the other classes, I would much appreciate it.” Draco lists Professor Garren and the professors for Transfiguration and Muggle Studies.
Inside Slytherin, the dormitories are redesigned into one single gender-neutral wing with expanded bedrooms and internal bathrooms. The common bathroom now hosts an indoor pool and a hot-springs-like area. The staircase is updated and internal lifts are also added.
“You can have my one later,” Harry says firmly. “And since it’s for you, you can share it with Nolan later too. I’m sure he’ll want to have a taste.”
for them. The students who are more receptive, and the students from the different Houses who we think will get along well together. In the Winter Break—most of you weren’t here, but we were actually able to play with the other Houses...it was just Aegis and Greyback who ruined everything.”
“ARGG!!” Greyback snarls. “When I get you...oh, you will wish you were dead.” His eyes glint with cold burning light.
Once Luna and Ginny arrived, they headed into the dining room. Draco had done the decorations, mixing elegance with warmth. Everything was neat and orderly. Harry and Draco’s seats were at the head of the table, while everyone else filled out the two sides of the table, with Hermione and Ron closest to Harry on one side, and Ginny and Luna on the other.
As Blaise and Felicity cast their spells, Hermione takes a look at the architectural details. The atmosphere is gloomy.
Harry laughs and hugs Draco’s scaly neck as Draco climbs up into the air and loop-de-loops and barrel rolls and flies in circles. Seeing the fun, the younger thestrals jump into the air too!
“Forget it, Draco, I’ll teach Astronomy to the first years tonight, you can teach Harry control instead. Take the dorm room.”
Draco breathes evenly. Magic flows through lines through the earth, and Hogwarts is built on a particularly active magical location. McGonagall is diverting some magic from those lines up towards Hogwarts’ heartstone in an amount that will far exceed Draco’s or Harry’s magic, provided that McGonagall maintains it for the entire duration of the ritual.
At first, Harry insists on changing into each outfit in the bathroom. But it soon comes to a point where he gives in and lets Pansy magic the clothes onto him. Muggle style, wizarding style, different colours, different fits, and everything taking even longer because Pansy always has to adjust the clothes to fit Harry’s frame.
Bartholomew’s jaw clenches. “Very well. Your questioning is done.” Without a word of farewell, he pivots on his foot and leaves via the Floo.
). His muggle wallet has maybe a quid left in 5p coins, and there are a couple of sickles in his coin bag. It’s
They work silently as Draco gathers fragment stone and sinks down new pillars down to support the remaining floors.
Blaise’s eyebrows rise in contemplation. He reaches out to stroke the wall. “Indeed, Hogwarts is sentient, isn’t she? Or—they? You’re
Harry lets out a sigh of relief when they step back into McGonagall’s office. If McGonagall and Robards hadn’t been there, Draco really could have been taken by the Aurors at this time. Once that happens, it would be much more difficult to get Draco out, especially if the Aurors immediately took him to Azkaban.
The thestral leader whickers softly to another adult thestral. The other adult thestral heads into the Forest, Harry’s eyes burning after it.
“Amazing!” Hagrid says. His hands reach out, as though wanting to pet Draco. “While the colour looks most similar to say a Swedish Short-Snout or an Antipodean Opaleye, other features make him look a lot more like one of Great Britain’s Hebridean Blacks!”
Minister Shacklebolt opens with some preliminary welcomes and opening words, and then moves to the agenda: “It has been two weeks. The Ministry has gathered an impartial team of expert magical theorists to analyse the progress thus far. The rebuilding of Hogwarts is highly sensitive. The foundations must be solid and thorough. Everyone, please do not obstruct their examination.”
McGonagall is standing by the front desk, Garren next to her. The rest of the tables and desks have been moved aside, leaving a clear space in the middle.
“Hermione, I don’t even sleep in the same dorm room as you,” Harry says. “Draco and Pansy will make sure I do my homework. I’ll see you tomorrow.” He darts forward and gives Granger a quick hug. “Hermione, don’t worry, okay? Can’t you
Draco grumbles. He lets his head fall to the ground and temporarily allows the thestrals to use his tail as an equestrian jumping obstacle. He should just turn back into a human and conjure up
“Now, I know it’s hard, but try to refrain from fighting others. If there is any problem, come to me and I’ll deal with it.”
“I’m not stopping you. Merlin knows that’s the most pointless endeavour in the universe. However, as your...
After the failed ambush, Harry has been more quiet and contemplative than usual, but he hasn’t said anything to Draco. Draco has ultimately pushed the issue aside: it’s not a look of Harry before he does something reckless
of painful apparation through Hogwarts’ wards, Draco drops the scum Aegis member to Pansy and the others. He apparates back to Harry’s side, transforming at the same time.
Draco, and the younger Slytherins inexplicably like Draco’s liveliness. Blaise doesn’t mind: it’s a lot less work for him.
“Ah, Pomona, excellent,” Flitwick says, trotting over to Professor Sprout, who is casting more water-impervious spells. Her presence has kept Hufflepuff standing: her magic anchors the rooms.
” and helping him into the silver-and-gold glittering water. His glasses were placed on the sink edge.
“The more important thing is Malfoy getting together with Harry, which would make us siblings-in-law,” Ginerva says with a complicated expression. “But seriously though, now that you have Harry and I have Luna, will you now stop acting jealous of me?”
Just as quickly as he transformed into a dragon, Draco is back in human form. Harry looks down (on accident!) and quickly looks up and away again as he gives Draco’s clothes back to him.
“I would like everyone to stand in a circle around what will be the castle,” McGonagall says solemnly.
when the school year’s exactly the same as ever?” Draco says lowly. He grabs a firm green apple, feeling the satisfaction of crunching into it.
Garren draws to his full height, gaze narrow at all the students around him. “Don’t loiter in the corridors,” he says, and leaves without meeting Draco’s eyes again.
His entire body didn’t feel real anymore. There was only the constantly rising pleasure, and the two cocks breaking him.
Hogwarts is a darling. Stones that volunteers put back not quite right automatically settled into place. The flooring was always perfectly aligned, and paintings that were originally in storage magically appear back in place. The Hogwarts ghosts move back in (“
...Nolan grumbles. It’s good that Potter knows the truth. But still! Nolan should hate Potter on principle! He stands up, turns around so his butt faces Potter, and lies back down on Mr Malfoy’s lap.
The wards settle and hold. The moment Felicity returns a, “Done,” over the connected badges, Draco strides over to the nearest Quidditch stand and the cluster of muggle-style wearing students.
Pansy, who has only recently awoken, holds a camera in her hands down on the ground. Dangerous dragon? What danger? Look at how docile and obedient he is! (Pansy will tease Draco about that later, and he won’t be able to refute because she has
“All teams have been tested and careful investigations have been done. The Slytherin team did not cheat. Rather than blaming others, I suggest you take this as motivation to train hard, understood?”
“—I’ll accept your change of topic,” Draco says magnanimously. He packs the chocolate apple cake up and puts it away. He then pushes the ginger treacle tart to the center of the table. There are two spoons on the side: the tart is to share. “Youngest first.”
A burst of loud laughter comes from the center of the common room, as the music changes to a track by Celestina Warbeck.
than happy to provide a dinner service right here.” He nods to the two kids. “They couldn’t say no to
straightforward. But Hogwart is old, and big, with its magic becoming more complicated and complex more and more as the years pass.
, Draco agrees. His hand trails against the staircase banister as he climbs to where the Astronomy Tower is beginning to take shape.
Draco folds up the letter, slipping it into his robes. He nudges the chocolates towards Pansy without comment, and strides out. He ignores curious eyes as he heads for the Forbidden Forest.
any of them. The food simply appears and disappears on the dining tables that Mr. Malfoy had organised.
Over the course of the next two days, Harry’s Christmas gift plans sprawl into being. He’s determined to do it right the first time and show everyone just how much he appreciates them. So in-between mealtimes with Malfoy, Harry rushes to discuss matters with Jamie and Blaise, he quickly follows Felicity up to the owlery, and he hurries around the castle, and carefully hides his gifts.
Harry tried to suppress his grin. “When did you start complimenting me? It feels fake. Unless you’re backhandedly complimenting yourself.”
Harry gets out, and barely has time to recover from the ride before Malfoy’s crowding him against the wall. Blood pumps, and the
The Halloween-set-up volunteer group returns at sunset. With all the Slytherins in attendance, they light the central fire pit and lay out the food that the house-elves graciously provided for their ancestors and passed loved ones and family. Wild magic and Hogwarts’ magic swirls through the air, laced with the scent of cold
Perhaps giving the assembly after lunch was a bad idea, as many students can barely focus during the afternoon classes. Some professors have smartly scheduled building-related content instead.
So instead, Harry’s standing outside Gringotts again. It’s a bit before Malfoy’s previous lunch-time, and Harry’s thinking of taking Malfoy down to Muggle London to a pizza restaurant that seems pretty popular. Pull out Malfoy’s chair, get the bill—
return to their homes as they currently are. But with his parents around, Malfoy Manor is not an option either. It’s not as though Draco can gather up the vulnerable students under his care and fly away.
But there’s no rush, no hurry. Harry has years to learn Draco, and vice versa. He learns more every day, knowledge refreshed anew and bright.
Jamie sits straight up. Magical construction! This is actually something he has a (tiny) bit of experience in! (Though, technically, the house-elves did all the
Granger’s face darkens with annoyance and barely suppressed frustration. She points her wand at Potter and ends his
All the people working in Harry’s inter-house alliance come, and they all bring with them a few more people. Some of the students who played with them during the Winter break also come. And some of the students who are/were friends with either Slytherins or the adopted non-Slytherins also eventually come.
Harry sucked in a sharp breath, and then immediately relaxed. This was how one of their common scenes started. The first time, Draco had found Harry overworking himself, proposed the outline of a scene, and said,
“How many students are there in Hogwarts, Harry? Grab a few of them and make them give some of their magic. Ask Longbottom. Ask Lovegood. Ask Abbott.”
Pansy dives into the mind of the tall Ravenclaw, who has the least resistance. The information she’s looking for comes up almost immediately—after mentioning it, the other student automatically started thinking about.
their fellow Slytherin Eighth Year. They’ve already slept in the same bed once. Why not continue to do so?
“Stupid! Of course, taking out the bottom floors would lead to the building collapsing! Why did they do all that? It would have been easier to just expel all the Slytherin students!”
“You left so suddenly, Alice…” Alice’s friend says upon arriving at the outskirts of the event. Alice Mistle has come out to greet her.
Draco greets the thestrals with a rumble, swooping around them. The little thestrals detach from the herd, neighing happily.
presence.” McGonagall’s face is calm. She sits down at her desk, and motions the Aurors to take the two remaining seats.
What can Harry say, when faced with the scene of Malfoy, Parkinson and Zabini all wrapped up together like that? While Harry is the only one sleeping alone...
“But unfortunately, I have no intention of leaving, so I cannot escort you back. You’re a tasty morsel to many in the Forest, Potter.” Draco rubs his temples. “Damn it, you’ll have to stay.”
been negotiated, after they had met at a Muggle munch in London. But these days, Harry let Draco manoeuvre it as he saw fit.
Draco adds, “If you thought I had purposefully poached Harry from you, you are wrong. Don’t we all know our history? Harry pays attention to me when
By the time dinner starts, Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick have arrived, taking a seat at the table with Hagrid and watching over the proceedings with relieved eyes.
Nolan places one hesitant paw on the quilts laid over the ground. When Mr Malfoy doesn’t reprimand him, he puts another paw, then another, until he’s standing on fluffy white.
Despite the situation, McGonagall has decreed that classes will continue. NEWTs and OWLs classes are prioritised. Most of the classes continue in the makeshift rooms, aside for potions brewing due to lack of equipment, ingredients and suitable workspace.
Under the eyes of the others, Healer Murie starts casting. He frowns, and then his brows rise as his lips purse. “I confirm that Draco Malfoy’s blood is no longer fully human.”
It means that the Slytherins won’t have to suffer in pain for long for the mistakes that Draco made.
Harry happily accepted it. He took off the lid, and his eyes grew round. There were neat little eclairs, each one coated differently with either dark, milk, white, ruby or matcha-milk chocolate. The decorations on top of them were exquisite and delicate.
Pansy and Blaise stay with him, because they never listen to him when he tells them to go ahead. Pansy keeps watch, while Blaise caresses the wall very peculiarly.
And Draco’s hands are firm, solid, and when Harry looks at him, he sees that fond look of love reflected.
In Draco’s eyes, magic shines. He can pick out all the fine weaves of magic. The magic of each Founder has a distinct colour, and despite the Slytherin House expulsion, traces of Slytherin’s magic remains.
Hitchly seethes. “Stand aside Potter! No one cares for your words! You weren’t the only one who fought in the war!”
Hermione’s expression darkens. “Yes. If what Malfoy told you is correct, then that may explain why, since Aegis’s beginning, they have done nothing about Greyback. I looked back over the news appearances, and in fact Aegis intercepts only minor dark wizards.”
Harry and Draco enjoy their romantic Valentine’s Day, which starts from breakfast with them feeding each other at the communal breakfast table.
“...I’m sleeping on the outside,” Harry finally crumbles. He waits for Pansy to get into bed first, before lying down by her side.
“I’m sure you know, Professor, given that you’re not an Auror despite your qualifications,” Draco says coolly. “When the Aurors are on your side, you call them. When they’re not, you
Sequoia gives them a curious look. “Hello, Alice’s friend. Are you neutral or chaotic? If you’re chaotic, you can join Nolan and Harley in their chaotic scheme to attempt to tackle Mr Malfoy. I’ll have you know though, it’s as if Mr Malfoy has eyes at the back of his head! Or like, he can smell us or something!”
When Draco returns to the Commons, Potter has shifted on his couch, and the firepit is a touch brighter.
It takes the two of them together to fix the thread of magic and reconnect the local temperature charm with the rest of Hogwarts’ magic.
“Next time,” Pansy said at the end of the night, after a tight hug, “Don’t hesitate to send me an owl!”
“So, Malfoy, would you like to go out for lunch?” Harry tries again. “I know this place in Muggle London, it’s good, I think you’ll like it.”
“Don’t give me that look,” Draco says, patting its flank. The thestral takes it as a cue to play around, and Draco indulges it. He pretends not to see Granger’s conflicted, complicated expression.
“Now shh.” Draco casts a disillusion charm around the both of them. The Professors have set up temporary safety barriers around the ruins, but no one is on watch.
Some of the werewolf students stir, but Draco then casts a quieting privacy charm around them. Making sure that Harry remains warm under the blankets, Draco rises, pulling on his cloak.
“You didn’t listen to a word I said,” Blaise sighs. He pats the wall, and the staircase magic patterns seem to even out a bit more.
’s turn to learn Harry’s new space. The changed wardrobe, the proliferation of photos of friends and loved ones, the growing stack of broomsticks.
Draco lets go of Harry’s hand, smiling coldly at Granger and Weasley. “Slytherin is separated,” he confirms. “The Wizengamot wishes to remove Slytherin from Hogwarts. Have you not calculated who is for and who is against such a manoeuvre in the assembly? This was going to happen. I simply made it happen on
Jamie had been worried—a lot of Slytherins had gone to magical schools overseas, but...his family wasn’t rich enough for the move.
A number of less prominent articles recall the petition to reinstate Slytherin again, stressing that Slytherin is necessary for a healthy Hogwarts.
Harry blushed. He tilted his head up to look at Draco. “Then I’ll give you a lot of hugs in the future?...Wait, you haven’t even said why you liked me!”
Harry’s eyes went round as Draco’s face descended. His lips were once again taken hostage by Draco. At Draco’s nudge, Harry’s legs parted, allowing Draco to slot their hips together.
office is on the Ravenclaw’s floor,” Draco drawls. His eyes snap to a couple of the other Hufflepuffs trying to sneak past him and Pansy. Draco raises his arm, and flames burst out, all the way to the other wall.
“Alright,” Nolan says. Nolan and Harley head out of the tent again, heading down to the Black Lake shore where window panes are being made.
“I’m fine.” Aster’s voice is thin and high, as though they can’t breathe enough air. “It hurt at first but it doesn’t anymore—”
Potter pouts. “Yeah, yeah. Just because you’re two months older than me doesn’t mean you get to boss me around.”
Draco snorts. “You and Pansy clearly have too much time on your hands, developing strange worlds in your mind. How about you help Pansy with the two-way mirror charms?”
: *flips her hair* Oh, today I woke up and felt like crushing you, don't think too much about it, okay?
Draco blinks calmly on the surface. “If it must be done, then it will be done. Now, we will have lunch in Slytherin. Will you and Weasley join Harry?”
“I was in the Forbidden Forest,” Draco says truthfully enough. He hasn’t told her about his dragon form because...she would have noticed if he had undergone the procedure for an animagus transformation, which he
Draco snorts lightly. “The matter is already known to the general public. Registering changes nothing as long as they don’t dare to ask for my blood.” He smirks faintly. “But this matter is not something they can arrest me over.”
The young Gryffindor, Alice Mistle, agrees first, leading the older Gryffindor boy to agree too. This prompts the Hufflepuffs to agree. Only the Ravenclaw students decline for now.
Draco keeps his face sombre, even though this is the first time he’s seen such an intense response. Whenever his father conducts this back at Malfoy Manor, it is much more subdued. Is it due to the number of Slytherins? Is it due to
Letters and business documents are arranged neatly on the desk. One of the Aurors pulls out a fresh sheet of parchment, and by cross-referencing Lucius Malfoy’s handwriting, starts to write a letter.
: You’re lucky I didn’t torture you, didn’t dangle you over a pool of inferi, didn’t bite you and chew you and spit you out, didn’t stick you in front of a dementor and make you relieve your worse nightmares…
Harry stares at Hermione and the agreeing Ron in disbelief. “Am I not allowed to have Slytherin friends? What happened to
“Why ever not?” Draco’s chest bubbled with how much he enjoyed this. “Your deep green sparkling eyes, your luscious curls, your cute cheeks, and your smile that could start a war and end a dozen more.”
in his superiority was that the beast is triggered by anger,” Draco says coolly. “And I was too scared for that.”
In the Great Hall, there are now square tables arranged across the hall, with individual chairs which have been personally tested by multiple students and deemed comfortable and suitable. Light fixtures, books in the library, the last floors of the Ravenclaw and Gryffindor towers all go in over the two weeks of the break.
Harry nods. The Slytherin entrance foyer would be a better place to stand and talk rather than the corridor outside. Once the door on the Slytherin side closes, Harry opens the entrance out to the corridor.
He goes back to his bed and privately opens the letters. The privacy charm rearranges the scribbles into clear words.
Draco smoothes down the already smooth front of his robes and leans against the thestral leader. “Potter,” he drawls. “How nice to see you again.”
Draco is talking idly to Potter when he feels something off. Mesa and Martin run back to him, and turn and face outwards to the Forest around them.
“Well, Grimmauld Place is open,” Harry says lightly. “I was thinking about cooperating with the War Orphans Foundation to use that space for something useful.”
He taps Blaise lightly. “We need to return,” he says lowly. The other students won’t do anything physical or
It takes til mid morning when Harry finally musters himself to go, after he cleans his house. Upon stepping into Gringotts, the lights flash and an alarm starts beeping, and three goblin guards swarm over to him.
Draco pressed his hand down Harry’s throat, catching at the collar of Harry’s T-shirt. “Do you like me, Harry?”
as well as Harry. One hand on Harry’s chest, feeding him Draco’s magic. Other hand neatly catches the orb rolling towards him. It starts pulling his magic immediately.
“And making a bigger window seat because, because,” Raven Flint says, folding her arms and nodding seriously.
,” Draco drawled. He released Harry’s hair in favour of pushing his back, forcing Harry to bend over Charlie, accenting the curve of his smooth arse. With this position, Draco was able to force his finger in. “How does that feel, Harry?” he purred. He pulled out and pushed two fingers in.
.” He tugs at his robes; the fabric falls smooth and flat over his chest, and Harry realises suddenly that Malfoy is taller than him.
Malfoy says lazily, “Nothing too major. McGonagall wants me to allow Garren to disarm me because I’ve taken over his wand allegiance. And yes, she confirmed that Hgowarts is sentient and considers me to be the Head of Slytherin.”
Blaise stands up, bored of watching the annoyed shouting of the Ministry team, who have just lost their expected break. He returns to Slytherin House to report back to Pansy. After that, he might speak with Flitwick about the professors’ plans for a new Hogwarts, and nudge Draco to consider other matters...
Blaise, taking his guard-duty seriously, nudges Draco subtly. They enter the Great Hall. The eyes of the students immediately turn to them. Ignoring the common students, Draco and the others arrange the seating of the Slytherins.
engaging in a shouting debate with you,” Jones says derisively. He looks with some yearning at Jamie’s bag where the packet of biscuits are now hiding, but then turns his gaze to Jamie’s classroom design instead. “Ottley, what’s that you made? It’s meant to be a classroom, not a concert hall.”
“Don’t be scared,” Draco coaxed, kissing the tip of Harry’s nose. “You’re handsome, and your cock will be handsome too.”
On Saturday morning, after breakfast in the Slytherin Commons, Harry finds himself staring uncomprehendingly at Malfoy.
Then, he grabs Aster to help him figure out how to weave in defence against physical attacks in the badges.
“Let us begin!” Professor Flitwick proceeds to write out a number of spells on the blackboard. In order to practice, he hands out tiny amounts of building materials: small stone fragments and woodchips among other things.
“Last night, a Gryffindor was found in possession of this soul orb,” Pansy says, lifting the jar with the broken pieces. Beside her, Draco obligingly shows an illusionary image of the whole soul orb to everyone.
“Good morning, class,” Professor Flitwick says in an upbeat manner, standing on his podium at the front of the classroom-tent. “Today, we will be starting a new topic that was not on the curriculum. Don’t worry, it won’t be tested,” he adds, much to Jamie’s relief.
“It must be nice,” Harry says wistfully. “They tried to teach us French back in primary school, but I wasn’t allowed to study.”
When they arrive home, Draco carefully removes their robes and hangs them up. He goes through his nighttime routine, stripping off the grime of the day. He strips off his clothes, puts them in the hamper and begins the automatic washing charm sequence.
While the Great Hall will host the dinner, in the afternoon students and visitors explore the grounds of the castle and the new gardens, and admire the castle facade.
“You better all go now,” Madam Pomfry says, her face twisted with worry. “Do keep safe. I’ll be here tomorrow morning.”
“...Don’t stay up all night playing with Hogwarts,” Draco says in a sleep-laden voice. “Tomorrow, you have homework
“But I want to see some self-study,” Draco says sternly. “Same schedule as you usually would. Are all of you staying back?”
Though, unlike Harry, Draco can feel his bond to Harry in his chest. He doesn’t need to be close to know that Harry is safe.
It was a gusty autumn day in London, and while the lunch crowd was just starting to peter out, the streets were still full of people. A small hunched-over man, in black robes with a deep hood over his head, hurried down Diagon Alley.
they seem to be saying as they swoop and swirl and loop-de-loop, just like how he showed them previously.
Minister Shacklebolt begins: “Good morning students and staff of Hogwarts, panellists, Wizengamot Member Griffith, members of the press. It has now been two weeks since Headmistress McGonagall took over the rebuilding of Hogwarts. While Hogwarts has now since been declared an independent school, the rebuilding of Hogwarts must comply with Ministry safety codes. The school must be solid and safe for centuries to come. The Ministry has regathered the impartial team of expert magical theorists to analyse the new progress. As Headmistress McGonagall contributed to the report of the prior Ministry team’s evaluation, Unspeakable Nightshade will play the analogous role. Please allow the team to conduct their examination in peace.”
He doesn’t tell them about all the other times where this injury transfer has happened. If Pansy’s right, and it
Pansy gasps, breaking the connection. She grabs his arm—the one with the Dark Mark on it—but she won’t find any left over evidence from that event. The dragon had healed it perfectly.
Harry secretly sighed in relief in his heart as the conversation moved away from trying to get him out to a public wizarding place again…
Draco quickly distances himself from Potter who’s digging himself into a big hole. Instead, he loudly asks Hagrid about the optimal feed for thestrals, meaning that Hagrid’s loud voice takes over the conversation all about thestral nature and food habits.
Yes, there are green tones, and the large Slytherin banner. There’s still the ornate throne-like sofas and the large window facing the Great Lake.
Ignoring the flushed embarrassment on Harry’s face, Draco lifts him and heads up the stairs. Harry remains quiet, not speaking until Draco sets him down on their large bed.
Room by room, floor by floor, the stone walls of Hogwarts rise. Arches and clear windows and stained-glass windows accentuate the grey stone. The towers climb out and up. Magic in each added component integrates into an increasingly large magical weave.
Draco has been awake for a few minutes already. But due to all the different ‘flavours’ of magic in his body, he has to sort through them and make them integrate orderly, like the group of misbehaving Slytherins they reflect.
“This better not be a trick, Malfoy,” Harry said, shifting closer again. “Also, I’m making treacle tart because I already have the ingredients.”
The Slytherins take a seat primarily on the side that would have been their original side in the Great Hall, but there is a blurring of green and yellow and blue and red robes.
Harry swaggers into Gringotts. He doesn’t mind the alarms, doesn’t mind the goblins’ menacing glares. For, just barely a few steps in front of him is Draco Malfoy himself. His heart skips a beat—at the surprise of seeing Malfoy so soon—before a grin comes over his face.
The students are separated; if he turns his head a little, he can just make out the slight shimmer of magic at the corner of his eye, shields that divide the four houses that Professor Flitwick has cast just in case.
Draco slowly reaches out and lays a hand on Harry’s knee. Harry’s leg twitches, and his gaze snaps to Draco.
Potter blinks. “And...um…” He frowns, green eyes distant as he thinks. “Oh! I should remember it next time? ...And not run away from Zabini?”
“Everyone, gather your homework! Act natural!” Draco orders. With Blaise’s help, they reset the Slytherin Commons, hiding away all the extra bookshelves and desks and tables and snacks and sofas and charming over the central firepit. A couple of first years pull out a game of Exploding Snap—Draco gives them an approving nod;
“Madame Pomfrey will override him,” Draco says dismissively. “Now go to lunch, your Weasley looks like his stomach is going to eat him inside out.”
The two sisters draw closer, talking to each other. Draco leaves them be, returning to his breakfast.
Even though everyone tried to hold back their interrogations, they still did so nonetheless. They asked about when the two got together, why Malfoy gave him a ring, was Malfoy the one who wanted to keep this all a secret (no), could Malfoy cook (yes), did Malfoy win all the arguments at home (Harry wins, okay?!!)...
After a long moment, Potter sighs. In a very quiet voice, he says, “Do you think there will be a third war?”
“Harry, he’s not worth your consideration,” Draco says. He lays a hand on Harry’s arm, nudging him to turn.

But he knows that his mother and father don't understand. In their generation, being a leader of Slytherin meant something different. They didn’t receive the injuries of the other Slytherins like Draco does...
. Secondly, the third floor was forbidden in my first year,” Draco says cooly, eyes heavy-lidded in an expression of tedium.
Harry grins when Draco hands it over. He scribbles a quick note to Hermione and summons a house-elf to deliver it.
Draco needs to be harder on them...after he makes sure they’re safely back in the Slytherin Dungeons.
They walk past her. It’s not Draco’s concern if she remains there for the rest of breakfast. There won’t be any other students leaving till lunch.
Draco’s smirk widened. “I should hope not, Mister Head Auror Potter.” He closed his book and stood up, strolling slowly towards Harry, his eyes darkening at each step. Voice deadly soft, he asked, “How was work,
Pansy writes down the changes and hands out the copies of the written schedule, and Draco notes down names of volunteers who will help with the Great Hall set-up.
Draco doesn’t have time to argue. The two of them rush to get dressed. In the clatter, Blaise and Harry wake up.
Harry comes with a full-body shudder. Draco continues massaging his prostate, eyes greedily watching how Harry’s taken by each successful wave of orgasm. Draco’s there to catch Harry before he slumps. Draco’s there to fix his robes and spell them—and the mirror—clean.
designs will collapse without proper understanding of the physics and magical matrix set within.” She points her wand at the large board in front of the makeshift classroom—classrooms that the fourth years and up, including Aster, have helped build under the tutelage of Professors McGonagall and Flitwick.
The Muggle pedestrians barely gave the two men a glance. The one man who did received a dark silver-eyed glare and quickly scampered away.
Malfoy looked back at Harry. “Very smart. To answer your previous question, I have a number of young cousins living in France. They love all the books by
Hogwarts gives the tiniest of satisfied wiggles, and vases filled with flowers appear all around the school.
Harry glances at what he’d just picked up. It’s a giant candelabra, and the light fixtures look like creepy eyes.
How did Draco let something as piddling as a group of anti-purebloods get to him? Maybe if he’s lucky, they’ll target him first and he can deal with them and
, very much, to speak with Draco again, she ends up being very busy with the persecution against Aegis. In the end, many Aegis members are imprisoned, albeit not sent to Azkaban, and all of them have to pay reparations for all the property they have damaged and complete community service.
“I can teach in one of the classrooms down here,” Flitwick says. “I’ll start tomorrow with the OWLs level class.” He leaves her with some more class notes and a,
Draco wouldn’t have minded a kiss to shut him up, but instead, he gets Harry’s arm in his mouth. Clearly, Harry’s “romance” switch is off.
fifth years for his badge project and takes them all to Severus’s office. The door to the office opens easily under Draco’s touch, charmed lights turning on.
Ron isn’t in the next bed over if Harry needs anything. They can’t chat into the night about everything and anything.
Draco tilts his head in acknowledgement. “Unfortunately, doing so suppresses all your other emotions too. Its side effects are as large as its intended effect. It’s not a feasible solution unless you want someone to waste away in listlessness.”
A foreboding fills McGonagall’s heart. She rises to her feet. “Mr Malfoy, Ms Parkinson, Mr Zabini, Mr Potter…”
“And yet Malfoy still calls me Potter.” Harry quickly then adds, “Well, I still call him Malfoy, so that’s even.”
“Nnnnnngg…” Harry moans. His hips make tiny motions, inviting Draco’s fingers in. Offering himself up to Draco. Draco pushes a third finger in.
Harry groans. “Don’t even mention that. Before the marriage, we’ll have to have an engagement party first...Tell me instead, are you two going to get engaged?”
The first time Harry sees Malfoy after the war is at the war trials. Malfoy is painfully thin and slight, boney and looking too stretched out and squished in. When Malfoy goes to shake Harry’s hand at the end of his trial, Harry suddenly realises that he’s
Granger flushes. “Of course not! But can you really say you don’t have any connections with, oh, the neo Death Eaters, or anyone else like that?!”
Malfoy’s hand does something in Harry’s hair, and his tongue does something in Harry’s mouth and Harry melts into Malfoy.
After Draco runs around for half the morning, he ends up with the same location he previously decided. 🤭🤭🤭
“It’s either Aurors or Aegis,” Draco says. “They clearly want me. So let them see if they can. It would be much too uncouth if they came here in an attempt to drag me out.”
When they return, Draco will have to soak all the temporary wands in a solution that will clear their entire history of usage, and then scatter them.
Meanwhile, Harry followed behind, eyes sliding down to those ankles and rueing the few-hours-ago-Harry who had the bright idea of putting Draco in joggers.
Draco rolls his eyes when Harry buries his head under the pillow. Leaving Harry be, Draco gets out of bed and pulls on some robes.
Aster smirks. That smirk drops a moment later. “Look, River. Do you want to work on this together?” Their words sound rather pitiful in tone, so Aster adds, “As a show of inter house-unity, it might even give us extra points.”
“Magic has advanced,” Draco says. “Does it not annoy you that the seating in the Great Hall has no backrest? And the fact that it’s a long
Malfoy stood still. While Harry was occupied, Draco Malfoy’s eyes swept over Harry’s form. His eyes darkened slightly when he noticed the dried paint on Harry’s smaller fingers, but this expression was gone by the time Harry snapped out of his calculations.
Not so far away, the flying thestrals and the giant silver dragon do not go unnoticed. Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws and Gryffindors come out of the tents, eyes widening at the sights. They call out their friends, and

Flitwick frowns. “Of course. This is unacceptable. Have a good evening, I’ll update you as soon as I can.”
Draco sits by Harry’s side; on Harry’s other side is Granger. The two glance at each other and agree to look away for Harry’s sake.
He lowers his voice and tells the Ravenclaws, “In fact, I have stepped down from the position as Head of Slytherin. I was only assigned so by the Ministry anyway, and as a Ravenclaw, it is really not suitable. Imagine if a Slytherin was the Head of Ravenclaw!”
He has already sent a short letter to his mother confirming that he is the dragon in the newspaper and that he is a weredragon and not an animagus.
Jamie smiles at Draco. “Good morning, Mr Malfoy. You said you’ll talk about the dragon later! It’s now later! Can we see?
Anger and fear of Draco’s safety mix in Narcissa Malfoy’s heart as she quickly strides to her study to write her son a letter.
“Yeah,” Ron pipes in. “You know me and my family sort of...forgot a lot of the old traditions, but Neville’s grandmother knows them, right?”
By the time Harry and Draco head over to Hogwarts, Hermione has already called all the old DA members to cast stasis spells.
Harry likes to work in the thick of things. Once McGonagall calls the end of the work for the day, he takes a short walk across the now-actual-corridors that they’ve created, albeit without a ceiling.
, the top of our fields. Be careful and mind the details! Hogwarts was not built in a day, and will not be rebuilt in a day!”
Draco surveys the Slytherins. “Unfortunately, beyond these measures, we cannot guarantee your safety if you leave. This may have been a singular incident. But equally, Aegis may have sent soul orbs to multiple people inside Hogwarts. If you don’t want to leave, tell me now, and we’ll organise the schedule.”
“Is your fault,” Harry grumbles. He throws an arm over Draco and presses their bodies together—Draco’s chest into the mess.
“Wow, wow, so smart,” Harry says with a mocking smile to the Aurors. “Do you Aurors ever speak to anyone else outside your department? Do the Unspeakables ever talk to you? Well, of course not, they’re better than you, after all. It’s understandable that you haven’t heard about the Ministry bill to remove Slytherin from Hogwarts. Since you don’t even know that, you also wouldn’t know what the Unspeakable department did. I suggest you return and gather some information first.”
After Harry finishes the bake, he entrusts the cake to the house-elves for safekeeping and rushes back to his room to shower and clean away the scent of baking which Harry suspects Draco would be able to smell.
The two of them enter the Eighth Year rooms. “Bed?” Draco offers, sweeping a hand to where Blaise, and now Pansy, are fast asleep.
Harry was so hot. Draco was so hard, it was painful pushing in only a little, pulling out again. Harry bit down on his own red lips, but he couldn’t stop his moan seeping out. His channel clenched down on the top part of Draco’s cock. His hips started to move, trying to pull Draco in more.
Zabini steps over, smiling faintly. “What Draco means to say is to not reveal any details about the Slytherin Dungeons, neither its location, nor its interior. And no sensitive information about any Slytherin.”
She sees them tuck the device at the top of the staircase. She sees how the device merges into the wall and spellwork.
Draco and Harry are indulging in some hair pulling during XXX activities. While main-universe!Harry is only using his imagination, alternate-universe Harry is implementing them in full colour~
He still has his warm over-robe on, though he has since unbuttoned it. The Gryffindor common room is smaller, but also cozy. Harry is surrounded by many Gryffindor students, now broken into small conversational groups.
After Harry finally disappears from view, Draco turns back to Hogwarts castle. In the same way that Malfoy Manor’s heartstone is located in the main hall, the center of Hogwarts is located in the Great Hall.
“Of course, I will also accompany you,” Pansy says. “We’ll need the floo in McGonagall’s office, it’s not worth it to waste our energy apparating all the way to Wiltshire.”
Harry is really the only person with reason to go to the Great Hall for meals. He declines going at lunch, but at dinner, he does go. Draco and Pansy drop him off outside the Great Hall where Granger and Weasley await.
Their conversation meanders around Nolan’s worship of Draco and cups of hot chocolate. Eventually, Nolan returns, and the other werewolves of all houses arrive. Harry eagerly serves everyone wolf-appropriate food, and soon, full and drowsy wolves pile into the large blankety nest.
...ah. Draco knows why. But he plays ignorant, answering no to all her questions. She finally casts a number of healing spells, hands him some dittany, and tells him on no uncertain terms that he’s to stay put in the bed.
Draco slowly sips his coffee and says, “I am not asking you to protect me. I must say, I was surprised that you didn’t stop Potter testifying for me at my War Trial.”
“—Therefore, I hope that the Ministry will be swift in dealing with the registration. The four Houses of Hogwarts will rise once more.”
Draco pulled Harry towards him and buried his head in his chest. Harry sniffed, breathing in the scent of butter from Draco. Draco’s hands rubbed Harry’s back, his body forming a shield between Harry and the world.
Despite Harry’s best intentions, when Malfoy reaches out for him, Harry grabs back, and they’re suddenly pressed together, and Malfoy’s mouth is on Harry’s and
Now, in this large, brightly lit, for-now-empty Great Hall, the four brilliant banners of the four Houses hang side by side in harmony.
Malfoy drawls, head tilting, soft hair falling back. Harry finds himself grinning foolishly, and tugs the blanket hard and pulls it up to cover his own mouth. Malfoy grins and leans over, tugging the blanket back. They tussle, and roll around, and they both tumble off the sofa.
Harry purses his lips. Ah. He does remember how the students from Dumstrang and Beauxbaton had surrounded Malfoy’s posse, regardless of gender. He remembers one of his suspicions that Malfoy was a veela, too, but unfortunately nothing came out of that.
with animals,” Draco says, pointedly ignoring Blaise. He glances at Potter on reflex. Meanwhile, his friends are leering at him, amusement in their eyes.
“This is the center of Hogwarts’ magic, the place where all four houses come together. Under here, the heart of Hogwarts lies temporarily hibernating. Or you could say it is like a coma—”
The Minister smiles slightly. “I received your letter. These two Aurors were coming down to question Mr Malfoy, and I took the opportunity to come along.”
Not long after, two groups converge outside Hagrid’s hut. On one side: the Slytherins, dressed up snuggly in thick cloaks, scarfs, hats and warming charms. On the other side: tall and spindly black thestrals, stretching their bony wings.
than wait for it to get worse,” Harry counters. He pats Hermione and Ron on the back and gives a big smile. “Hey and now you two can have a date without me interrupting you!”
quiet for us,” Hannah says, tea cup in hand. “Sprout came by on Tuesday evening and gave everyone a talk.”
, Harry finds. He wants to melt. He never wants to stop. He doesn’t know why he didn’t start this earlier.
“I saw that you stirred clockwise 5 times then counterclockwise three times, instead of seven times clockwise.”
. None of us want you here! You Slytherins should just fuck off, you’re lucky you’re all not in juvenile detention!”
Harry admired their hands side by side. Small hand, large hand. Brown hand, pale hand. The bronze rings glinted in the light, very eye catching.
Draco Malfoy gives her an empty look. He jumps, lightly landing on the stage. The moment his feet touch the wood, the four house banners appear, unrolling across the front wall—the ones that should only appear at the end of the year at the conclusion of the House cup.
Harry squeezes his eyes shut. He opens them again. “Still there,” he mutters. “Wait, this isn’t the first step in pureblood courting rituals… Or even the second….Don’t know about the rest, I didn’t read that far…”
No, he doesn’t, Draco decides. The advanced potions the Dark Lord used on Draco are beyond Potter’s Potions comprehension.
Draco Malfoy sits directly opposite Robards’s desk, while McGonagall, Pomfrey and Potter sit on one side of Robards’ office, and Charlie Weasley and Healer Murie sit on the other side.
, right there.” He clenched down when Draco wanted to pull out, he relaxed when Draco violently thrust back in.
Potter’s ears redden. “I don’t know if I’m the best person to ask, but doesn’t everyone know who Malfoy is?
Draco stopped dating after that. It was pointless. If, and when, the time came for him to have an heir, he’ll just find a surrogate. Even better—he’ll just incubate the child himself with the new medimagical technology.
Garren and Hermione continue to discuss the specifics and then move onto topics they could teach about, like science. Ron slumps, clearly bored. Harry listens quietly, if only so that he can warn Draco and the others if necessary.
: Does Charlie Weasley want to steal Mr Malfoy? NO! You’re not allowed! *hugs Draco around the waist*
Minerva cannot remember the last time she saw Garren use his wand. The man is fairly adept at wandless everyday spells.
Draco uncorks the vial and drinks it in one go. The warmth of the potion spreads, completely eliminating the last traces of the stunner. Draco hands the empty vial back to Aster.
This morning, there aren’t as many students at Hogwarts, as many of the older students have gone to Hogsmeade.
“If only others could see that Slytherins can have fun too,” Harry says, his eyes on the messy younger years. His slightly-cracked lips quirk up in a smile. “I still can’t believe we made you those robes.
going to teach us Potions instead of bowing and scraping to the students of the other Houses? No?” Draco sniffs and turns.
Blaise clears his throat. “Very well, we shall all endeavour to do better in the future, won’t we? The three of you should indulge in a Hufflepuff-ish hug. This way, neither Gryffindor nor Slytherin will be too overly offended.”
Anticipation builds in Draco’s chest. He unravels the folds in one motion and finds himself holding a set of robes. The outer long cape component is a deep green-blue, almost black. Damask-like patterns catch in the firelight, like the night sky, like nebulae. The inner robe shimmers with different greens, like scales and gems.
Nervousness unsettles his stomach, making him unconsciously shift to the edge of his seat. He knows how much work Mr Malfoy and Mr Zabini and all the others (like Potter...ugh…) have put into rebuilding Hogwarts. Nolan himself has helped too.
(also, I love people's suggestions of things that could be changed about Hogwarts. A lot of them coincide with what I have planned~)
Harry shifts back, closer to Draco. “So go away,” Harry continues. “Don’t come any closer, or I won’t
During the day, while his friends went to proper jobs, he was either sitting in his art room near the top of the house with its large charmed sun-filled windows or writing on the couch in one of his living rooms. Sometimes in the afternoon, he might pick up his friends’ kids if they ended class early, and sometimes in the evening, he had dinner with his friends and their families. Every Sunday, Harry went to the Burrow, which was the noisiest day of his weeks.
In the warm late afternoon, Headmistress McGonagall and Minister for Magic Shacklebolt take the stage, each giving a speech in turn.
Granger’s eyes go a bit starry, as most do under Blaise’s attention, even as she tries to maintain her suspicion. “I didn’t know you read it.”
And that’s how Draco (and Harry by extension) obtains a long ‘tail’ of students following behind him like little playful ducklings.
Alice Mistle wants to sneak out of Gryffindor, but Ben’s and Mary’s groups stay in the common room all afternoon and evening.
Draco beckoned him over. Harry went easily, handing Draco one of the mugs. But instead of drinking, Draco took both mugs and placed them on the coffee table. Then he placed Harry in his lap and peppered kisses over Harry’s face.
Despite becoming an independent school and thus receiving reduced funding, there is no problem with Hogwarts’ new income streams. Along with the tax-refundable charitable donations as coordinated with Narcissa Malfoy, Pansy Parkinson has also collaborated with McGonagall to make merchandise for the school, which goes very well among students, alumni, young children not yet at Hogwarts, and even witches and wizards from other countries who have never attended Hogwarts at all. Hogwarts is no longer be at the mercy of the British Ministry.
“Mr Potter, why don’t you hurry to your next class?” Garren says politely. “I need to speak with Mr Malfoy in private.”
Malfoy’s eyes surveyed the room. His gaze landed on a small soft toy sticking out from beneath the coffee table. Harry’s cheeks immediately grew hot when he noticed it.
Harry frowns slightly. He doesn’t know whether or not he should snuggle up to Draco. Now that they’re dating, it doesn’t feel innocent anymore. But he feels cold lying this far apart.
Harry deflated a little, but he was bolstered up again by Draco’s use of “we”. They went to get dressed together. Harry sat on the bed while Draco picked out their attire.
“Ah, darling, don’t think you can escape me,” Narcissa said pointedly. “You used to get along with Astoria Greengrass back at Hogwarts.”
Draco’s lips twitch in amusement and fondness when Harry looks back at him multiple times as Blaise leads him upstairs.
Michelle keeps her mouth shut. Slytherin has been getting cookies from the house-elves for quite a while now… She glances around a bit. Professor O’Conor is on the opposite side of the tent.
Unfortunately, Malfoy is sitting on the throne sofa by the central fireplace and clearly has no intention of saving Harry at all!
And unlike Greyback, Draco doesn’t think he’ll be able to obliviate all these Aegis members, and so he has to hold back his spells.
Hermione takes out a set of Omnioculars. “Based on what we know of Malfoy’s nature, he would not allow them to play like that without his presence, and nor does he like leaving Harry’s side. Malfoy is not among the students, ergo, he is very likely the dragon.”
Hermione gave him a sidelong look. “There’s more to being a good partner than being a good cook,” she informed him. “If he’s a good cook, are you going to marry him instead?!”
don’t know what Draco does. The public knows that Harry and Draco are together, but it’s not in Draco’s nature to flaunt Harry
The appearance of Greyback, Dark Wizards, and Aegis in Wizarding London makes its way into the papers. The atmosphere drops and tensions tighten across Wizarding Britain, and Hogwarts cannot escape it.
The two of them had been friends during their first two years at Hogwarts. Aster had taught them about nonbinary people have always existed amongst wizarding folk, and how they, along with trans magical people, used to be counted on for some of the more complex rituals and questions and as healers for the community. In turn, River Hall had protected Aster against the muggleborn and halfblood arseholes who didn’t think nonbinary people should exist or existed at all.
After Monday, the Great Hall no longer accepts any howlers. Yes, the papers are still speculating on Harry’s resort. And yes, Harry has gotten benign fan letters asking him
“Those dark blue robes you have should be sufficient,” Draco recalled. “A touch out of season, but the alteration to fit the new silhouette is minor. I can come over and do it for you.”
Harry and Draco are joined with Felicity and Pansy to continue to stabilise the underground levels. Blaise helps Hannah Abbott and Professor Sprout on the method to reinforce Hufflepuff, while McGonagall manages the other professors and older students to look after Hogwarts’ towers.
There is only enough to know that it was something made outside of Hogwarts. The device’s spellwork was too fine for a student. If it had roughly destroyed the spells on the staircases, Minerva
Draco has to force down his reactionary uneasiness. He should be confident in his own ability to protect the Slytherins and adopted non-Slytherins under his wing regardless of the situation.
Draco and the others follow the Auror who escorts them out of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and up to the Atrium.
It’s verbal, mostly. That kind of leery isolation. It is not the Hogwarts environment Draco was hoping for in the new year. The start has definitely been inauspicious.
Professor Richard Garren steps into Slytherin.  He’s not the first Ravenclaw to stand in the Slytherin Commons, but he’s certainly an
As a dragon animagus, Draco’s marriage prospects would go up. This ability to transform shows his magical power. Not only can he transform into a creature larger than himself, but that creature is also magical.
Harry protests being called Potter, but Draco continues to be serious. Sighing, Harry tilts his head upon Draco’s shoulder. “
. Different people write differently: from the structure of sentences, punctuation, and vocabulary, etc., and by analysing this data, it is possible to guess the author of the work.
It takes Draco a lot of effort to throw Pansy off. “Nolan was like a little thestral,” he defends, much aggrieved. His voice drops. “And after last night, it was the least I could do.”
“I’m not kicking you out.” Malfoy’s face is shadowed. “If you leave Slytherin, then it will be due to your own initiative.”
The elf slowly appears in view, standing at the corner of the room. “Young master Draco, your mother has tasked me with your safety.”
Draco raises an eyebrow. “Even if I did, would it stop you? Do you expect me to tie a chain between us?”
Draco’s magic runs lightly across Slytherin and Hogwarts. It’s not actually done yet. They still need to make the fine connections between the Slytherin Dorms and the Hogwarts castle, and as part of the new Hogwarts plan, they will be extending the Slytherin dorms up a few more floors, so that they’ll have one floor at natural ground floor height.
putting him on highly sensitive guard duty,” Draco says, meeting the eyes of the Seventh Years. “Tell me your concerns.”
Draco smirks in response. He hands a piece of meat to one of the meeker thestrals, who hasn’t approached Draco yet.  “That’s right, eat up, and get big and strong like your evil herd leader,” he tells it. He stares directly back at another thestral that’s being a bit greedy. “I have my
He’ll cast a healing charm later, so that no one else would see it. But for now, he could admire the image a flushed Harry made.
like a Slytherin? He’s been sitting at the Slytherin table lately. He sleeps in the Slytherin dorms. He plays with the younger Slytherins.
“You’re not as bad as Gardiner says,” Das admits. “See you later.” She turns and leaves with the rest of the second year Hufflepuffs.
and I have some more vague PWP ideas. And I’ll do my best to update some extra chapters at some unknown time 🙈
“Ahh!!!” Harry’s eyes become wet as Draco’s cock spreads him open. “It’s so big…Daddy...it’s so big…”
The blood doesn’t hiss. Instead, the moment the droplets hit the flames, they dissipate into shimmers of colours as bright as the day, as deep as the night. The circle completes, forming patterns that weave through the air.
“Let me feast on your first.” Oh yes, the hot grip of Harry’s arse, the erratic clenching as Harry’s body asks for
Draco’s eyes flick to the high table, but McGonagall is not there. Foreboding clenches Draco’s stomach.
Harry is following Malfoy and ends up in the Chamber of Secrets. There’s no Malfoy in sight, but there’s a
Draco’s husky voice made Harry shiver. Harry’s eyes lowered shyly. “Okay.” A teasing hand caressed Draco’s chest, following the lines of his scars.
The moon is waning, and the cloudy sky casts yet darker shadows. Sparse floating lights illuminate the path between Hogwarts Castle and the Slytherin House. There is no one else walking down the path except them in the glow of Draco’s
Harry doesn’t like it. “Isn’t that too drastic? I was thinking—that you could build an alliance with the other houses. Luna and Hannah and Neville are all really good people. I already talked with Luna, and she’s game to try.”
Draco wasn’t comfortable. He sighed, and was about to roll over away from Harry, when Harry touched his arm. The touch was too brief.
(Elsewhere on the grounds, Madame Pomfrey’s nose prickles as though she wants to sneeze. She frowns, wondering which student has secretly gotten injured this time. Is it Malfoy and Potter again?)
Harry is not in the room. The bonds reach out from his chest, even the hair-thin ones. Every single person is accounted for—Harry is somewhere in the Common Room.
Harry nods. “Yes. Everyone, you should remember to ask the other students about what they want out of a new Hogwarts.”
Pansy sucks in a sharp breath. "Does McGonagall know?" She grabs Draco’s arm. “Your weird wound transfer...Have you ever thought about what would happen if one of the Slytherins died?”
“She is now an indefinite visitor to Slytherin,” Draco says. “Michelle, go tell Blaise to have the house-elves set up a living space for your sister. It will be best if she sleeps in your dormitory. Show her around. Aster will give her a badge too.”
In the late afternoon, the sun still shining in the sky, he can feel their liveliness through the bonds.
The yule log burns out by the end of that night. And on the morning the next day, McGonagall requests Draco to her office via a letter delivered by a Hogwarts house elf.
“Right, we’ll make a new castle, even better than what the Founders could do,” Harry says carelessly. “Bigger and better than before…!”
Potter quickly turns towards a destroyed wall. “From what I remember...there are some special spells for fixing this. I’m pretty sure Hermione wrote them down…”
“You’ll either have to use Legilimency or Veritaserum to determine whether or not someone is sincere, Granger. Or you’ll just have to accept that our
Harry’s heart jumps to his throat. In the firelight, he can see multiple round objects slam into the silver dragon’s body and wings, sizzling as they suck up magic. The dragon snaps his body, hitting the soul orbs
Harry feels a little nervous as his private potions session with Malfoy approaches. He’s confused when Malfoy leads him
Now that it has been a few weeks since he spoke to his mother, Draco has calmed down. Sometime after his proposal with Harry, they sent polite letters congratulating him. He wouldn’t be surprised if they had initially tried to remove the engagement from the Malfoy Genealogy Book, and that only after failure did they slowly come to terms with the new reality.
Draco can feel the cracks appearing in Hogwarts’ magic. It’s most noticeable in the common areas of Hogwarts; in the Slytherin Dungeon, Slytherin’s magic dominates.
This won’t be the last time Draco sees everyone, and this won’t be his last time at Hogwarts. A Muggle London trip has been organised for all the students in the summer holidays, as proposed by Hermione Granger. Later, Draco will also have to return to Hogwarts to hand over the
While many of the younger Slytherins want to help out at Hogwarts castle too, McGonagall is only allowing seventh and eighth years to work. So Draco assigns them to self-study if they complain anymore—after all, who knows what further disruptions to schooling they would face? Harry feels like he narrowly escaped danger—thank goodness he’s an eighth year!
As each Slytherin mentions another property of the robes, a huge sense of responsibility wells up in Draco.
“Very good, I’m glad Maira has a good friend. Harry, why don’t you let everyone in to relax, I’ll settle Maira and Kim in first.” He takes out a small round badge, and not long after, the Slytherin entrance opens and a dark-haired teenager comes running out.
Although the visible pulsation of magic from the yule log and the blood sacrifice is gone, Draco can still catch glimmers of magic at the corner of his eye. Centered on the Slytherin Commons, Hogwarts’ magic has brightened and strengthened, fading as they go further up and further away.
The three of them walk in silence. When they enter the Slytherin Commons, Draco nods to Felicity, and then leads the two boys into the Slytherin Head Boy room that they use as a meeting space.
Thoughts turn in Draco’s head as he tries to convince himself that finding someone else fit does not equal liking them. Draco’s not the only one who thinks Harry Potter looks handsome! They were archrivals, archenemies! ...Except, they’re not anymore.
“You won’t regret it,” Draco whispered, kissing the skin by Harry’s ear. Harry was still wearing his pyjamas, so it was easy for Draco to reach in and pull out Harry’s half-hard cock. It was flushed and visibly grew in Draco’s hand.
Draco skims through the rest of the paper, but there’s nothing else interesting aside from the weather forecast for Samhain.
Harry’s eyes crinkle and this time lands a more successful kiss on the corner of Draco’s mouth. “Don’t you think the best plug is your cock?”
“Even general healing-boosting potions would struggle with the number and range of inflicted wounds,” Pomfrey adds. “
Draco reclines on a sofa, watching the students, both Slytherin and non-Slytherin, playing together. The fraction of non-Slytherins is still smaller than Harry would like, but to Draco, it’s already a giant change.
Draco sighs in exasperation as he summons Potter’s dropped books. “Potter, don’t be so embarrassed,” he drawls. “You’ll see a lot more salacious things in the future.”
Harry smiles smugly as he hands back the newspaper. “You know how the goblins took forever to serve me?”

He brings Malfoy more tiny potted plants (which indeed now live on Malfoy’s desk), and tins of fancy biscuits. After he brings tiny sword charms for the goblin guards, their pokes have become friendly instead of menacing, and the desk goblins all have a good laugh when Harry gives them chocolate coins.
“She has collected extensive evidence of Aegis illegally breaking-and-entering and subsequently ransacking multiple properties… She has also mentioned suing the DMLE for Auror discrimination in the lack of pursuance of the matters,” Inkwood says, his tone going a little sour towards the end.
Draco blinks. “Thank you, sir,” he manages to say. He’d been planning to do a Potions Mastery and then take over the Malfoy estates and companies.
If it weren’t for Draco would they have caught Greyback in a year’s time? Two years? Three? They’re just like Aegis, going from the low-lying rotten fruit and not daring to cut down the tree.
future career. With your Potter and Black vaults, and the Sleekeazy profits, you could afford to be a gentlewizard of leisure and philanthropist. But I imagine that does not appeal to you.”

Draco hides a smirk. “Don’t worry, we all know that Greyback is nothing without the full moon...well, I know he’s weak. Otherwise, why would he hide in the Dark Lord’s shadow? It's a good thing you killed him, Potter, or else Greyback would have become the Dark Lord's pet by now—”
Draco’s eyes scan over Slytherin Building again, noticing the fragments of stone jutting out unsightly, the portraits still stuck on Slytherin’s outer walls...He’s sure that if he flies up, the ‘roof’ of the Slytherin building will be the floors of the rooms above, flooring that is now
Harry’s heart starts to thud in his chest. “Actually, the reason I asked was because there is someone I—”
time for them given that they stop working tomorrow til the after the new year, forcing Minerva to wait before she can counter them.
Though it’s still a surprise that Harry is able to successfully make it given the number of times he glances at Malfoy, who’s working on the lab bench right next to him.
Bartholomew sneers. “We know. Her and Harry Potter...if only Shacklebolt didn’t become the Minister.”
Blaise inclines his head. “They have two weeks to show progress. Two weeks is more than enough to show them failing more than once.”
Narcissa draws to her full height. “Worry not, Headmistress,” she drawls. “For Aegis only strikes Death Eaters, known or suspected. Draco?”
Draco asks Hogwarts. He feels an affirmative pulse. He slowly withdraws his magic, encasing it around just Slytherin instead, following Blaise’s lead.
Hogwarts replies with satisfaction. Hogwarts becomes even more pleased when Blaise starts working out some of its magical knots that it didn’t realise it had.
Harry’s lips quirk up. “Hm. Are you sure I can’t come with you—” He steps close to Draco. “You look very good in these robes…”
Downstairs, the Slytherin Commons is lit with an enchanted predawn, the crackling flames in the central fire pit, and the candles on the giant Balsam fir. Piles of gifts surround the fir, and one certain Jamie Ottley’s already up and eyeing them. There are some other children awake too, but they’re chatting quietly and not nearly as obvious.
Harry looks away. “We...we fought. I forgot to ask them to come with me. Hermione took us to Garren to talk about
Draco moaned, his fingers tangling in Harry’s hair. “Fuck. That’s good. You’re so good, Harry.” His fingers teased Harry’s hair, sensations pouring across his skin.
They all leave the office. Narcissa farewells Draco and she and the Auror are escorted out of Hogwarts grounds by McGonagall.
Fire had rolled in Draco’s stomach. He stormed out of the Manor, seeing red. He transformed, alone, in the Malfoy Grounds, gritting his teeth so he wouldn’t scream.
Pansy huffs. “You’re being dramatic. Hmm...I would have known if you tried to hold a mandrake leaf in your mouth for months…”
Rose Datta nods along with them. “The fourth years got to learn how to make glass...but I learnt a bit too!”
Draco rubs Nolan’s head. “I know it’ll be painful. You can come with me, if you want to Change near me. Come, the moon will be rising soon.”
Potter nudges Draco’s hands away. “Hey, I’m not a little kid that needs someone to do up my buttons.”
No one from the Ministry rebuilding team is a Slytherin. With all the stone blocks and bricks required, they are not careful enough to extract out all of Slytherin’s magic.
Draco rubs his temples. As the Head of Slytherin, he is responsible for the wellbeing of the students under his wings. “On the weekend,” he says sternly. “Everyone here needs to go back and do their schoolwork, and
Draco curls his lips—showing off his sharp, sharp teeth—and speeds up to the clearing and lands as though he’d meant to the entire time. The thestral leader lands soon after, and starts nudging the foals toward him.
Charlie started wanking Harry in tandem with his thrusts. “Fuck, look at you, wanting my cock so badly. You’re so beautiful, Harry.”
Eventually, the number of diagnostic spells goes down and the panel and the Unspeakable gather together to discuss their results.
In comparison to the two previous Heads of Hogwarts, Draco respects McGonagall more. The antagonistic tensions between the Houses have been building for years. In fact, McGonagall is unlucky in being at the tail end of it. But at the same time, she could not stop those rising tensions.
The sudden tug of magic accompanied by a rushing wind makes Harry turn his head back to Draco again. In the place of the human, there’s now a big silver eyed white dragon. His wings flap lightly, large graceful arcs that block the sky, making him look even bigger.
Zabini hands Harry his bag. “The house-elves sent it over, I assume it still contains the work from today.”
“Yes yes!” Harry’s words dissolved into moans as Draco went faster and harder and deeper. His cock shook between them, flushed red leaking pre-come.
“Do you know who attacked Malfoy last time, a few weeks ago? And who messed up the stairs? Was it the same people?”
.” Draco glares at his unfinished homework on his personal desk and grabs his notes on the protective badges instead.
Harry hung his head, his heart beating hard in his chest. “It’s not that...It’s not a marriage ring, it’s a boyfriend ring,” he admitted. “Bronze for boyfriends, silver for engagement, gold for marriage, that’s what he said.”
In the Hogwarts Library, low voices murmur, parchments rustle, and quills scritch under students’ diligent hands.
Draco shakes his tail and slowly stands up. He walks a little distance away for safety, crouches, and then jumps into the air, wings beating hard, and takes the two of them for a ride, high up into the air.
Draco’s aware that Hogwarts’ magic is still spiking. He’s aware that people are spilling out the doors, that house elves are apparating students out.
,” Jamie says, happy that he has the ‘inside’ knowledge, “Mr Zabini says it because they don’t have any Slytherins on the building team! Don’t you remember what McGonagall said about needing all four houses to make up Hogwarts?”
that he is a weredragon, but rather disprove that he is an animagus. All through the years since he started attending Hogwarts, he has not undergone the procedure required to become an animagus.”
“Why are you all so weird?” a bunch of second year Gryffindors retort in passing. “You’re just jealous that we’re not sharing our cookies with you!”
,” Harry chokes out bitterly. He shoves Malfoy out of the room, and closes the door firmly behind them both.

“Fine.” He hands the plate over and stares at the box a moment longer. “Malfoy…” The moment he touches it, the box opens.
Malfoy’s voice pulled Harry back to the present. Malfoy had a slightly down expression that tugged at Harry’s heart.
The rest of Tuesday and Wednesday pass by much like Monday: with days split between classes and working on Hogwarts.
way…” Hedge is greedy and takes two biscuits, but Jamie decides to be the better wizard and allow him that transgression. He’s more mature than them, after all.
Tch, he already knows these two boys don’t match up to the smart non-Slytherins who have already come over to Slytheirn to play.
“Work first,” Draco orders them, crossing his arms. “Unless you can confidently tell me that you’ve all finished your assignments for next week already?” He raises an eyebrow, even at the older Slytherins.
After the bonding occurs, Draco feels happy and that happiness reflects back to him from Harry so much so that he...accidentally turns into a dragon!

do. This gossip, being much more interesting then yet another pair of students ‘secretly’ kissing in the corridors, spreads through the castle’s portraits.
“And oh yeah,” Harry turns to Hermione in particular, smiling. “Draco grudgingly admitted that your idea of having trips to Muggle London was good...as long as Professor Coates isn’t there with the Slytherins.”
“After breakfast,” Pansy repeats. “I’m sure Draco will be fussing over his own clothes at the same time.”
McGonagall gives the two Aurors an impassive glance. Her gaze softens a touch when she turns to Draco and Harry.

“Don’t lie,” Bartholomew scoffs. “Stand up. We’re escorting you out.” He strides forward, reaching for Draco’s arm.
Draco looks at him. His throat bobs as he swallows. His hand rises and rubs Harry’s hair. He can’t help it.
. Draco’s kisses were sloppy all over Harry’s face. Harry just closed his eyes and contentedly basked in it.
Harry straightens. Yes. I was thinking...the different Houses have class together, but it’s not that easy to talk and make deep friendships in class. So we should organise fun activities together. Show that we’re friendly, and that only Draco bites.”
Harry’s heart buoys up with the returned farewell. Seems like Harry’s going better than he first thought!
In the late afternoon, Draco keeps half his attention on the green-robed quidditch players practicing above the pitch, and half his attention on the protective wards he and Felicity have woven around the area, from the ground to high up into the air.
Draco’s breath becomes harsh as he hurries to their side. Magic pulses in his chest, running down that thin thread that connects him to them.
Harry turns his head, studying Malfoy from the corner of his eye. Malfoy is steadfast looking straight ahead.
Harry asks when Malfoy comes around with break-up gifts of new bakeware. Glumly, Harry puts them away.
“I can just live on my inheritance and Harry-Potter signings,” Harry jokes. “You don’t even need Malfoy money, I have enough to keep you.”
Unlike the first few times, there is no longer much pain at all. The dragon has become increasingly integrated, increasingly a part of who Draco
In the afternoon, just as Draco is about to head out with Nolan, Harley, Aster, and Mesa, he’s able to catch Potter returning with Blaise from who knows where.
“Ah, you probably heard rumours of what happened in second year...they’re probably true…” Harry says, glancing at the corpse.
Despite the coldness of late November, students from other houses sit arrogantly in their stands, wearing their robes in the muggle style—split open down the center-front and paired with a muggle uniform underneath.
“Pansy, have you noticed any particular unique properties of the orbs that we could use to bypass anti-accio spells or hiding charms?”
That evening, Draco receives an encrypted letter sent by an anonymous owl to Blaise—sent to Blaise because unlike Draco, Blaise’s mail is not being monitored by Aurors.
Draco bows his head. He can offer words, but they would be meaningless compared to those Potter misses. Potter’s actual friends really need to be here.
In which Narcissa and Lucius suffer the most surreal Easter where children barely younger than their son calls them ‘grandmama and grandpapa’ while those very same children call Draco ‘dad’ and ‘father’...
Harry pulls his hands back, rubbing his arms. “It’s like my skin is too small,” he says, lips turning down.
“Face it, Draco,” Pansy drawls with an exasperated smile. “You did this on yourself. You could have given up, made Blaise or me lead. But you didn’t.”

Hermione shuts her mouth, her heart aching. Harry thinks he can see Malfoy’s side...but then why can’t he see

is. This...this isn’t like the old days. Draco no longer wants to listen blindly to the hard words of his father, nor the cloth-covered-heavy-hand words of his mother.
McGonagall’s weary expression doesn’t at all change when she sees the accompanying Harry. “Good morning. Take a seat, both of you. Mr Malfoy, is there anything you'd like to tell me?” Her fingers pointedly tap the picture on a copy of today’s
“Hm.” Harry scratches Draco’s palm lightly. In his mind eye, he can see how things will slowly come together.
“I feel full watching you eat.” Malfoy’s tone was particularly deep, and his eyes indeed looked like he was eating up the image of Harry.
The Gryffindor team are sullen as they march into the Hospital Wing for Pomfrey to do an after-match check-up on them, glaring at Draco and the Slytherin team who are drifting over to him.
wizarding items. Luna Lovegood, his agent, fielded requests and most communications too, on both wizarding and muggle sides.
Harry laughs, but it sounds a bit pained. “I don’t know, I think Neville would be a better Head of Gryffindor if a student had to be picked. If Neville ends up teaching Herbology here, then he would literally be the best candidate for Gryffindor. He’s even taller than me, looks more like a hero should look like…”
Harry follows Malfoy, looking around curiously. Maybe if he had been an Auror or Ministry worker, he would know the restaurants around Muggle London, but he usually has home-made food, so he doesn’t.
Harry felt very embarrassed as he said, “But for the first time, I want to see your dick too…” He boldly reached out and cupped his hand against Draco’s trousers-covered-cock.
While Garren indeed doesn’t care for the Slytherin students, now that he has been forcefully relieved of that position, his gut feels uncomfortable.
“The Aurors didn’t expect that to happen! Kingsley is busy. There were more than just Greyback’s crew there…”
Harry pulled a face, just like Draco probably wanted him to. “I dunno, slime might be better than blood.”
Draco frowns at Pansy, and looks to the Professors’ table. Hagrid is talking avidly to Professor Flitwick. Hagrid’s now
Harry pouts playfully. “Why do you sound so evil, Malfoy?” He pushes against Draco’s chest. “If you got
“We want to see, too, Professor.” Hannah Abbot and Neville hurry over. “It’s our school too. We’ll be careful and stick together.”
Hermione’s eyes have narrowed, but the slightly off expression quickly disappears. “Harry, I’m glad you told us,” she says warmly. “It must have been hard. We won’t treat you any differently, right, Ron?”
Draco pokes Harry back. “Why the sad face? You need to be alert and protect me from the Ministry,” he jokes.
“At this point, is it going to stop the worst of them though?” Ginny scoffs, even as she pours a cup of tea for Luna. “No offence Harry, but a lot of us don’t really have time or energy to care about the Slytherins. But the
Draco turns and faces Potter properly. “Potter. The only reason I’m saying this is because you are now a Slytherin. You are a very important foil for me. Our contrast shows how great I am.”

And thus, every week, they met again and again. They had dinner, they had dessert, they played board games and listened to the Wireless.
“Everyone has finished eating now. Time to go,” she says pointedly. She frowns and leans in closer. “Your eyes have changed, a little. Do you need to...go out?”
But instead—never one to listen to Draco—Pansy sends a message to Blaise at the head of the group. From the front, Blaise nods and takes off with the Slytherins. Meanwhile, Pansy comes to stand by Draco’s side.
The NEWTs Charms class is orderly under Flitwick’s sharp eye. Right now, they’re practicing the new spellwork in pairs, when all of a sudden, magic is yanked out of Draco’s chest.
“It hardly hurts at all,” Draco says instead. He attempts to sit up, only to be pushed down again by Madam Pomfrey. “I need to change my robes,” he tells her. The way his robes are ripped, showing his skin underneath, is highly unsightly.
Inside is a suspension notice. For himself. He has only been un-suspended for a short while, and yet he’s getting suspended
On Friday night, after curfew, Minerva McGonagall does a round of Hogwarts castle. As usual, she hustles a couple of students back to their Houses and pretends she believes their excuses of “I was just at the Library!”
Pansy’s lips smile. Her eyes do not. “Go on. Tell her. And I’ll tell her about your sabotage with intent to kill Aster.”
“Yes.” She stops and waits for them to pass before climbing up the stairs again after them, escorting them out of Hogwarts.
“I love you, I love you.” Draco punctuated each sentence with a thrust into Harry’s hot, wet, tight heat. He wanted to go deeper, deeper,
“Ah! It’s morning!” Harry shuffles back and sits up. It immediately feels colder. Harry shivers and makes to grab a blanket.
Draco swallowed heavily. Harry was allowing Draco close. Draco had permission to hold him close, just for the night (so close to his heart).
While most students are in class, a crowd of outsiders gather in front of the meagre construction of Hogwarts.
Lucius ends up becoming distracted when Mr Parkinson arrives alongside Pansy. The two of them retire to Lucius’s office while Mr Parkinson tells Lucius in incredulous tones the business empire his daughter has created over the last less-than-a-year.
...Aster needs to apologise. It’s the least they can do. Even if the two of them don’t become friends again.
“I need to know what I’m working with,” she says. “As though I haven’t seen more. Fourth year, remember? Not to mention all those times we slept together…”
Draco nudges him with his foot. “I surely hope not,” he drawls, “It’s terrible for the British economy.”
Pansy glares at her jar of broken soul orb pieces. “They’re made from materials that can be found in other items.” She looks at Draco, lowering her voice. “Your parents might have information about how the original orbs were created.”
...Harry suddenly remembers that he wanted to ask Draco out today! Yesterday didn’t work out, but today was a new day! He turns apprehensively to Draco.
Someone attempts to strike while his back is turned. Draco dodges, while Potter leaps forward and snaps out a
In the Potter vaults, there are piles of galleons, then more piles of galleons (the piles keep growing: Harry has
Sighing at his fate, Draco entertains the young thestrals for a while until their next nap. Then, after petting them to sleep, he farewells the adult thestrals and heads back into the trees.
“I was wandering through the forest.” Draco’s lips curl up slightly. “I’ll leave you then.” He turns away and has only taken a few steps when Green starts following him like the lost Gryffindor she is.
Malfoy. Hermione wasn’t going to be hypocritical and stop that kind of talk when it’s clear that many Slytherins still walk around with that kind of self-importance.
Harry licks his lips, mouth parting. A mouth perfect for being Gryffindorish, and casting spells, and sucking cock.
Harry thought about saying what he wanted to say, but he ultimately shook his head, biting his bottom lip.
That night, Harry collapses into the big bed, exhaustion in every muscle and anxiety in every nerve. He falls into a restless sleep between Pansy and Draco.
At Malfoy Manor, Narcissa politely thanks Auror Inkwood once more for escorting her to Hogwarts. After Auror Inkwood leaves, Narcissa unerringly hunts down Lucius.
Harry, at the point, has just descended the stairs. His hair is sleep ruffled and his casual Sunday clothes are wrinkled. “Draco’s always an arse!” he shouts back.
Potter has a satisfied expression on his face as the other wolves slowly approach. They eat, eyes constantly flickering back to Draco, and they curl up on the enlarged quilt with their heads warily facing him.
“I need to work on the castle reconstruction with McGonagall, so I certainly won’t be transforming any time soon,” Draco adds pointedly. “After that, there are my assignments.”
“Wait!” Harry yells, dashing down the stairs. “What did you think I was doing?” He ends up with his face in Malfoy’s back, and it takes a moment for them to separate.
Harry shifts closer to Draco in bed. “I’ll teach you later. As long as you’re worse at learning the Patronus Charm than I am at learning Potions, I’ll be happy.”
Slytherin of mine will take such an attitude, dear Potter,” he says sternly. “If you really wished to increase your height, then we could break your legs and regrow the bones longer.”
*carefully taking notes of how the younger Slytherins get head pats: listening to Draco. Not listening to Draco. Acting spoiled. Pleading eyes*
Something is thrown at Harry. Harry automatically reaches out to catch it, realising one moment too late what it is as it yanks magic from him, faster than the previous soul orb did.
“It’s delicious, very delicious!” Ron immediately threw away his sense of embarrassment and pride. “I love your cooking very much, if I wasn’t married to Hermione I might have been married to you!”
After dinner, most of the students in Slytherin don’t want to do any homework, instead having already gone into “weekend mode” and discussing what they would do if they were put in charge of rebuilding.
. It was so big that Draco seemed to brush against Harry’s prostate constantly. Wetness sprung in Harry’s eyes. “Feels...so much…” Harry wasn’t sure he could take how good it was.
and a lump grows in Harry’s chest. Harry tries to think about anything else, like why Malfoy’s hair is so blond even though now he’s an adult, or why Malfoy’s hands look so enticing. But then Malfoy has to say, “
When Draco tugged his hair and forced him to turn his head around to kiss, all Harry could do was let Draco’s tongue dominate him.
Then, for a brief moment, the magic trace of a dragon appears in the magic weave, before dissipating in a glimmer. Hogwarts’ magic rumbles under Draco’s hand, warm and familiar...
Draco unburies himself from the books and papers. He blinks when he realises that all the Slytherins have gathered down in the Commons once more, standing behind Blaise.
Harry presses his lips together, his fingers hovering above the rings. His fingers curl together and pull back.
A loud clap echoes through the hall. McGonagall stands, and her voice carries, loud and stern. “The staff and I will discuss whether we should implement compulsory testing of
To many of the young teenagers, more people make it more lively. To some of them, a good friend may be better found in another House.
Harry’s brows furrow. A moment later, lube appears on his fingers, and he starts to tug Draco’s cock. It takes almost all of Draco’s concentration to remain still and not fuck that circle of Harry’s fingers. But his cock shows his enjoyment nonetheless, growing as it stiffens under Harry’s ministrations.
makes it easy,” Robards says, half sarcastic. “Auror Pembly, remove their disguises. Auror Clarke, take their pictures.”
Draco’s eyes were dark as the feelings of jealousy stirred in his stomach. He gave a small, self-deprecating smile.
Professor Flitwick pretends not to see it. For a greater cause, a little snacking in the classroom is nothing!
Nolan can’t help but slump slightly when he follows Draco to the North Wing. Mr and Ms Malfoy didn’t ask him to call them ‘Grandpa and Grandma’. It reminds him that although Harry has adopted him officially, Draco is still not officially his father.
night, courtesy of one Draco Malfoy, remained asleep. He was completely naked, not even bothering to put on pants.
Harry sits down on the edge of Blaise’s chair, his heart rabbiting in his chest. It doesn’t even make sense, it’s not as though he and Draco are strangers. They’ve both spent a lot of time with each other, including in bed.
“So what?” Harry sniffs, and carefully wraps the container with a Snitch-patterned cloth and a set of cutlery. “I can have lunch with you in an hour or so. I need to head to Gringotts to deliver this first.”
Harry’s secret domestic life with Draco was going very well. A few weeks later, on Sunday, Harry went to the Burrow as usual.
Some students take out their musical instruments and start to play: piano and violin and flutes, and some overexcitable students start to sing (read: Jamie). In the relaxed atmosphere, some students set up daring games.
“We met some Ravenclaws,” Draco says airily, taking a seat next to Potter. He accepts some of the paperwork Pansy hands him.
the way Harry’s body shudders with each fuck, he can hear the way Harry’s heart thuds, feel the harshness of Harry’s breath.
“I wonder,” Pansy muses in a voice that’s definitely up to no good, “if any of the other houses heard of our Slytherin Prince.”
“Now, are you two going to fuck or not?” Draco’s fingers slid across Harry’s thigh, down to his dripping hole.
As the youngest of the four, Harry opens his presents first. There’s a Weasley jumper (which Harry immediately puts on), rock cakes, books, and a fair amount of Quidditch paraphernalia. The second years have banded together to give him a matching hat, scarf and gloves. He receives a gold necklace from Blaise, and a book on courting traditions from Pansy.
“Hogwarts has been an institution standing for over a thousand years. It has weathered many events, and many upheavals of the British Ministry of Magic. Unfortunately, in the last few years, the British Ministry has been increasingly exerting their pressure on Hogwarts, from sending unrestrained dementors to Hogwarts, to placing criminals in positions of professorship.” McGonagall sweeps her gaze over everyone. “Today, I am announcing my intention to submit the formal registration for Hogwarts to become an independent school. I hope that past alumni may donate to the cause of an independent magical school that will cultivate intelligent, independent students.”
All the meat gets eaten up. Draco scorgifies his hands. Scorgifies Potter’s hands too, because he’s unsure whether Potter knows
. Maybe it was magic... It felt weird as his cock slowly split him up...but it was also good, knowing that it was
“Oh, you want to see a lawyer, do you?” Robards says. He motions to a group of Aurors. “Take them back to the Ministry, call their lawyers, and interrogate them.”
Hagrid’s eyes widen. “How smart!“ He looks at the paper again. “Headmistress, not many people have such light coloured hair.” He looks around the tent, where there are only a couple of students. It’s too early for most of them, given that it’s a Sunday. “Where is Malfoy junior?”
what they’re all supposed to be aiming for. And as for after the year ends...they’ll have to go into hiding if they want to get out of contact with him!
“That’s right,” Draco said, voice gravelly. “You’re so responsive, baby boy.” He leaned forward, dropping a kiss on Harry’s hair. Harry whimpered, arching his back.
Draco has no plans to lead her to the other students. Instead, he winds his way out of the Forest and then snaps a disillusionment charm on himself the moment he and Green are separated by a large tree trunk.
They arrive at ground floor, and Harry follows Malfoy with a feeling of impending doom. It’s all going to come falling apart...Malfoy will
“Enjoy,” Pansy says. She leaves Hagrid to marvel over the dragon, with a secret little smile on her face.
Gardiner if he wants, aside from his parole terms. More importantly, nothing to prevent Gardiner hurting Draco.
. There is no need to be too rigid.” He hands copies of the blueprints out to everyone. “I have also given this McGonagall. Draco and Pansy are in contact with experienced magical castle builders…”
“Let’s go.” Draco pulls Harry along with the last of the Slytherins. In the Slytherin Commons, breakfast awaits them.
Slytherin wins the first Quidditch match of the year against the Gryffindors, a match that Draco is forced to spend stuck in the Hospital Wing.
Unlike the main Hogwarts grounds, the Forbidden Forest technically isn’t covered by Hogwarts Wards. Not that it’s a
Draco rolls his eyes. “And Granger and Weasley will never let you marry anyone because no one is good enough for you.”
“You—you’d get thrown in Azkaban!” another Hufflepuff shouts. The sweat on his forehead threatens to drip into his eyes. How utterly unbecoming.
“Yes, and thanks for lying before.” Harry could tell that this particular side-alley was in fact still inside the Anti-Apparation Wards. There would have been no way for him to apparate out, and if it weren’t for Malfoy, he would have been cornered by the crowd.
Seeing the ordinary corridor makes Minerva annoyed. Sure, they cleaned up the scene of the crime. But that doesn’t negate the fact that Mr Malfoy disobeyed her orders. And that even
Draco rolls his eyes, but does so. Pansy’s heart beat is strong and steady, and Draco’s honoured to have her as his oldest friend.
There are conspicuous gaps left in the levels laid down so far. Also, while parts of the lower floors have been laid down, there is no ground floor yet. Anyone working either must levitate stones from afar, or ride a broomstick down.
Auror Hitchly raises his chin and smirks. “Mrs Malfoy, we know that you’ve been contacting other suspected households.”
There’s nothing for it, Draco will skip his first class—Potions—in order to fix it. He can’t in good conscience let any other Slytherin be late for class.
Harry on the head. “There, there,” he coaxes them. “Eat your breakfast, do your schoolwork, and help rebuild Hogwarts!”
He tried not to glance at Harry. He tried to do it under the guise of looking for traffic whenever they crossed a road. But then he met Harry’s eyes, and their fingers tangled, hands clasped, and Draco
Draco gives him a long, meaningful look, but Harry does not give in. “Don’t worry about it, Draco. I’ll be fine.”
“No, I’m not allowed to open my presents until tomorrow morning, so no one gets to open presents until tomorrow
“Class,” O’Conor says, hands behind her back. “As I understand it, Professor Flitwick has you planning out the new classrooms. For this class, we will work on conjuration and transfiguration of furniture. Then, in our next class, we will learn the permanent transfiguration spells that can be used to produce even stone blocks and how to easily join wooden structures without any nails nor sticking charms.”
Hermione gamely continues. “And when I said that Malfoy alienated you from us, well, we didn’t help either, did we? Maybe if we hadn’t, maybe we could have convinced you not to separate Slytherin.”
Draco stands tall and regal outside the Slytherin Commons. His light blue robes edged with silver detail highlights his height and austereness.
The wound in Hogwarts is not the same as the broken Vanishing Cabinet. It’s much, much, worse. Where Slytherin had been torn out, there is now the frayed edges of the magic weave. The edge that is starting to tear itself apart as the remaining Slytherin magic is repelled from the rest, making the wound even worse.
Draco doesn’t bother to argue with them. He simply defeats them and continues on the inspection with Blaise.
Anderson narrows his eyes. He snorts. “That’s right, this is all a farce orchestrated by the Headmistress. If Slytherin can’t be in Hogwarts, no one can be in Hogwarts?
“Hey, Draco,” Aster greets. They roll their eyes when Draco starts checking the potions. “I can look after your potions perfectly well, you know,” they say drily. “And Vaisey is right here to help.”
“Indeed.” Draco goes and prods some younger students. “Why don’t you help Blaise set up the Christmas tree?”
He emerges in the thestrals’ glade. Most of the thestrals are asleep, but they all rouse from their naps upon Draco’s arrival, their white eyes gleaming under the moonlight.
Narcissa has been trying to improve Draco’s reputation with that second article...but the first one is going to have the much greater negative impact.
“And while werewolves are now stipulated to be registered by the Ministry, weredragons are not. Correct?”
Multiple heads look up. Harry stumbles back as the sky fills with black bony wings and shiny white eyes.
Even before the War, Harry was unreasonably obsessed with Malfoy, prioritising him over Hermione and Ron. And now, Harry’s doing that again.
famous per-se, but to drive anti dark-wizard, anti-Death Eater, anti-“dark” creature sentiment. Letting Greyback rip his way through Diagon Alley plays perfectly into their plans.
of them work on Harry’s garden. They turn to look at him. Harry says something about getting them both drinks before quickly escaping.
Narcissa repeats her diagnostic spells. Of course, the damning result is unchanged. Exhaling, she returns to her seat. With a stiff jaw, she forces out, “Is it something about the
“This will be our future.” McGonagall looks over all the bright-eyed students, making a note of those who are not so happy. “As per Professor Vector’s calculations, the first step to rebuilding Hogwarts will happen tonight, at 6 pm. Everyone’s presence will be a key component. Let’s rebuild Hogwarts together.”
Despite the impending doom, Harry returns to Slytherin House in the evening feeling upbeat. He gets to have dinner sitting near Draco—Nolan claims the seat next to Draco, but then Harry gets to take the seat on the
. Hence, despite the fact that the machine learning models were not perfect, they were able to significantly increase the number of correct predictions. Hence, using machine learning to predict authors of anonymous fanfic is a viable method.
“That bastard,” Draco repeats. “Poor Mother, she’s been trying to arrange marriage for me with any pureblood witch of reasonable standing. Imagine the scandal.”
Draco raises one eyebrow, and smirks. “I must be quite popular, if you know my name,” he drawls. “I have no idea who
Draco’s own heart is left beating hard in his chest. Of course he can sense all the physiological changes in Harry, like his nervous sweat and his nervous heart.

do not use these. It affords us power for only a short amount of time. But the earth suffers. It is better to return that magic to the earth and allow it to replenish.”
The thestral leader sedately leads the herd out of the Forbidden Forest, while Draco is near the rear with the baby thestrals who are playfully running around.
My excuse for an episodic-styled this week is because I’ve been attending FujoCon 2021 🙈🙈 Seriously sleep deprived so any errors please tell me T_T
,” Draco hisses. He can feel his magic now racing down their bond, doing whatever it can to keep Harry alive. Somehow, Harry’s magic has dropped so low that his body has started shutting down, but there’s no physical injury. Something is very, very wrong.
going out, Draco and Felicity cast extra surveillance charms and wards around the Slytherin Dungeons before they leave.
telling everyone about his good boyfriend...but he wished he had told Ron and Hermione first, separately, so that they could have helped him against the rest of the Weasleys.
Since the very start of the year, there have been older Slytherins organised to help and tutor the younger students. Now, some of those tutors will have to be ‘promoted’ to teachers, all on top of their own work.
Now, Madam Pomfrey steps forward. “I confirm that, to the best of my knowledge, Mr Malfoy is not an animagus but instead has characteristics consistent with being a were-creature, in this case, a were-dragon.” She hands Robards a prepared medical report on the matter.
Draco let out a harsh exhale when his hips pressed flush against Harry’s round arse. His motions were slow, slow drag out, a gentle push in. Harry’s channel massaged him like an expert.
“Don’t follow me, go to sleep now,” Draco admonishes, nudging back one of the thestrals who has trailed Draco to the edge of the glade. “Look at your leader. She wants to murder me if I dare take you with me.”
Pansy, after collecting all the soul orb pieces, closes the lid of the glass jar and sneers at the groaning and stirring Gryffindors on the ground.
Harry’s bewildered by the whirlwind pace. A moment later, Harry is seated at one of the comfy sofas by one of the wall-side fireplaces surrounded by half a dozen second years and playing Exploding Snap.
Draco Malfoy sits with the other Head of Houses at the front. Professor Garren now sits with the other professors.
Blaise gently pulls the paper from Draco’s fingers. “Do you want to head back?” he says in a low voice.
The two of them bicker, completely excluding Granger and Weasley from their conversation who are unable to keep up with Draco and Potter’s rhythm.
), and when he catches Malfoy looking out of the window wistfully, Harry’s quick to ask him out for a Seeker’s Game, one-on-one, best out of three, and, “
. His robes look too small, straining at his shoulders and arms, and his height is sharply enhanced in comparison to the goblins surrounding him.
The wide-eyed look on Potter’s face is absolutely precious. “...Oh crap! I got Hermione and the Weasleys gifts ages ago, I forgot...But Hogsmeade...no, no, that won’t work…”
” The slice of pain across the side of Draco’s face hits a moment later. Heart beating widely, Draco surveys the Slytherin Common Room, but it doesn’t seem like anyone here is injured.
“Blaise has the biggest mansion,” Pansy promptly says with a grin. However, her smile quickly fades at Blaise’s serious expression.
“You’ll think of something,” Harry says cheekily. “Or maybe you’re just getting old, old man. Aren’t you like, two
The rest of the afternoon is bustling with preparations. This energy slowly calms down as everything is set up, and as day fades to evening.
Professor Flitwick has been kind enough to gather the work materials from the other classes on Draco’s behalf. Using these materials, combined with their own old notes, Draco supervises Potions in Snape’s old laboratory, holds Astronomy in the Head Boy room by charming the ceiling, while he and Felicity take over the teaching of Defence.
Unlike the late Dumbledore, McGonagall's more neat, and with a greater predilection to tartan, likely from her clan. A cat bed lies at the corner of the room, and there’s a new cabinet that Draco suspects is filled with Scottish whiskey.
Malfoy vanishes the potted plant (damn, Harry hopes it’s to his desk and not into nothingness), and pushes Harry out of Gringotts.
,” Draco retorts. “For example, my mastery. For example, the engagement party preparations, which will be happening next week, do you realise? Perhaps I’m simply not happy enough.
Nolan grumbles, but he obeys Draco and goes for a run...in what appears to be a star shape, in that he keeps running back to the clearing, then away again.
Nolan’s ears flick up. Sounds of footsteps across the crackly ground. Nolan jumps into his four legs.
Harry gives a very affirmative moan, head arching back and baring his neck. It’s too enticing; Draco immediately buries his head, nips the sensitive skin there. He can’t thrust as powerfully in this position, but he
Draco spelled them to all stand up. There were a couple of sherwani, from various eras, and indo-western styles with asymmetric cuts, English fabric, and a different silhouette. Unfortunately, Harry didn’t bring the undergarments that would have accompanied them.
Draco bowed his head. “Let’s try a combination,” he suggested somberly. “These sherwani are too cool for the current weather anyway. We’ll layer it with one of your robes.”
Harry shuffles out of the bathroom and sits down heavily on his bed, yawning. Everyone is there in the bedroom. Malfoy is already under the blankets, leaning against the headboard and pillows, and Pansy is reclining on top.
about people based on their blood—based on something they can’t control—then we’ll keep on making the same mistakes of the past. We’ll keep on hurting each other. Until what? Until there’s no magical Britain left?”
“Here,” Flitwick whispers, passing her a cup. It turns out to be a coffee mixed with a shot of Pepper Up.
“Good, Harry, you’re doing good.” Malfoy’s words twirl in the haze of Harry’s mind. “You look so fucking good, Harry. So fucking good on my cock. You were made for this.”
The next day, Harry came over with an armful of fabric. “I didn’t find any robes, but I found these.”
They bicker back and forth, until Pomfrey comes out of her office again and puts her foot down about Pansy and Blaise leaving.
Harry looks at him, grey eyes unblocked by his usual glasses. “Never. I’m glad we got Greyback...would the same thing work with the other groups? With
When Malfoy shows up again, Harry tells him he wants to turn the room in his own bedroom, and Malfoy says he’d learnt a spell that captures three-dimensional images. There are wobbly smiles on both sides, and their friendship is mended just like that. Harry is finally enticed over the grounds of Malfoy Manor where he and Malfoy pick up their seeker matches again, and the summer flies by.
Owls, firecalls, and visitors flood the Ministry wanting clarification, and press releases being given by Ministry officials quickly get inundated by questions that can’t, or don’t want, to answer.
Blaise speaks easily to the various visitors and high-profile members who have come, speaking just enough about the rebuilding process, just enough about how the students very much like the new Hogwarts, and have easily settled in.
for him. The two of them have a long history, don’t they? They worked well as enemies, and now, they work well as friends…
Harry’s eyes darted down. He pressed a hand against Draco’s bulge. Through the ridiculously thin cloth, Draco could feel Harry’s heat. “Can I?”
Harry put a finger in his own mouth, sucking lightly on it. “No? Bad idea? How long have you wanted me?”
“This is a good time for me to hand in the assignments,” Draco says immediately, taking out the Muggle Studies assignments from his first and second years.
Draco growls out rolling smoke...which the foals delight in prancing through. As the smoke dissipates, they wander back to Draco’s tail and try to climb it again.
Ron scratches his head. “The thing I don’t understand is why we haven’t heard about these Aegis raids. If they
, you agreed? I bet you agreed without even making him give you half his vault,” Pansy says, shaking her head in mock disappointment.
But that doesn’t mean Hermione’s willing to let Malfoy off the hook. If he does anything wrong, she’ll catch him.
?” Ron’s voice gets a little strangled. “While...you’re still in the room? Do they at least put up silencing charms?”
After making sure that Green is truly running back for the Gryffindor tents, Draco returns to the clearing and slips back into the blanket nest as though nothing is wrong, and pulls Harry closer to him.
are enjoying yourselves.” He glances down the table, making sure the younger Slytherins are eating their vegetables.
“I’ll get the fifth years to help,” Draco decides. “It’ll be good for their OWLS.” He gets up, and heads over to the clusters of fifth years to recruit minions for his plans.
The pad of Draco’s finger brushes lightly against the delicate metal of the snitch. The wings of the snitch flutter, and the snitch slowly flies up, hovering by Draco.
Nolan nods, and then Harry distracts him by trying to pat his head too. Nolan shoves Harry’s hand away.
climate,” Draco retorts. He curls his fingers, and forces himself to take a deep, measured breath. “Professor Garren has grievances with me.”
“Mate, first time seeing you voluntarily wear robes on the weekend,” Ron comments after gulping down some pumpkin juice.
Malfoy’s lips quirk. “Yes, yes, we still need work to lift you to Slytherin standards. Sunday night, all the better for you to remember ahead of Monday’s lesson.”
Festivities and games and chatter go right up to midnight, until Draco, feeling the pressure of being the Responsible One, puts his foot down and ushers everyone to bed.
...Nolan grumbles as Martin and Mesa flop half on top of him. He rolls back into his stomach and snuggles up the closest to Mr Malfoy.
In Draco’s shared dorm room, uttering the pass-spell will reveal a large map. He, Pansy and Blaise have been tracking all the appearances of Greyback’s pack and Aegis.
Harry tries to remain calm and keep a steady pace as he leads Draco and Blaise back to the main castle.
Harry nods. “Yeah, I suppose so. But you call everyone else in Slytherin by their given names.” He shrugs one shoulder.
Pansy dragged him out to dinner at a new muggle molecular gastronomy place, and as promised, they both tried hot ice cream tea, which went well with the cold weather. There was critique of the food, and there was nostalgic reminiscing of their teenage years.
Harry cleared his throat. “I’m used to drinking milk when the kids are here. Molly keeps some cows, and I go and milk them every Sunday.”
It was a cold, cold day when Harry appeared on his doorstep. Draco had given his address to Harry as a courtesy, a hope, but not a hope he ever expected to
“How lucky for Mr Potter to have a...friend...like you,” Garren says, equally insincere. He smiles benevolently, but his eyes remain cold. “I hope you remember to keep yourself in check, many people are watching you.”
...Though by the end of the two weeks of the Easter break, they inexplicably feel sad to see children go. The Manor becomes sad and quiet without them.
At Pomfrey’s annoyed look, Draco gives a lazy half smile. “Rest assured, I can deal with this myself. There are no problems.”
Harry snorted. Shifted closer, as his lips twisted in seriousness, and his eyes sombre. “Draco…” he murmured. “All those years ago...I didn’t think it was a big deal. People our age have casual sex all the time.”
He quickly stuffs the last of his food into his mouth and gets up, much to Hermione’s and Ron’s confusion.
Harry looks at him and tugs free from Granger’s grip. “I’ll see you and Ron tomorrow at breakfast, alright?”
The corner of McGonagall’s lips curl up coldly. “One person from each newspaper. Hand your wands to me, and I’ll allow you to take pictures of the aftermath. We have followed the Wizemgamot’s order, and the predictable has happened.”
Headcanon here, but I always thought that the hardcore (conservative) wizards in Britain would be effectively "pagans" and follow the super old traditions. All the miracles and magical things that a lot of religious figures do (regardless of religion)...witches and wizards can do them too....... (kind of like how science explains things, but like the magical equivalent).
With all the mess, Robards really needs to take a rest...but instead, he gets another headache due to the Sunday paper headlines and their accompanying pictures.
Potter wrinkles his nose. “Maybe.” He glances back at Granger and Weasley, who are looking their way.
Draco knows that his presence is making it awkward for Harry with his friends, so he pats Harry and goes to join the young students and thestrals instead, conjuring up jumping obstacles and toys. Some of the older non-Slytherins watch over their young siblings with nervousness, much to Draco’s amusement and gratification.
Hermione nods her head slightly, her emotions turbulent. How could Professor Coates do such a thing?
Instead of going up to his art room, Harry stopped by his rarely used study room instead. Inside there was a rarely used desk with a rarely opened drawer, containing Malfoy’s hawthorn wand which Harry kept forgetting to return.
((Now for those of you who know xianxia...what if certain mages can cultivate to become gods? In that case, being a god isn't so ~mystical~ at all...fairly standard, really, even if it might be very hard...So imagine Merlin ascending to godhood lol.))
“Not from scratch,” Luna says, her eyes already gazing somewhere no one else can see. “Combining the new with the old. Something blue, something borrowed…”
Slytherin’s entrance is no longer a blank stretch of wall. Instead, the opening entrance has been fashioned into two large sliding stone doors, framed with imposing stone columns with winding snakes. The proud emblem of Slytherin is curved into the centre of the entrance.

It was only this year that Draco started to care about the Slytherins. It was only this year that Draco personally, literally, felt their pain.
,” Nolan says pitifully. His head perks up a little when Harry pulls out the bloody meat from the picnic basket.
Alice smiles politely. “I don’t know what you’re talking about. Since you’re back, Harry Potter gave us some extra chocolate to hand out to those who weren’t here during the Winter Break.”
There is bright lightning, new soft and inviting sofas, and a little coffee/tea/hot-chocolate table. There are books and a scattered pile of old badges. There’s a warm fire burning at the fireplace.
Therefore, after breakfast, Draco in his Slytherin House robes and one acting-bodyguard Harry ascend the stairs to the Headmistress’ Office.
seems to think they have a magical connection (even though there’s no magic involved). And it goes well for a while—Harry loves how he can bake together with her, talk shop. And cuddling...Harry loves cuddling. But when it comes to sleeping—the euphemistic kind—Harry would rather not talk about it. He ends up disappointing her—he ends up disappointing himself. It doesn’t work out.
“—And your son has been earning a lot of royalties just by existing,” Mr Parkinson says jokingly. “All those dragon toys, who made them so popular? Not to mention the charmed devices available on commission.”
Draco grants them both, feeling both tired and helpless. At the same time, having them skip those classes, especially Potions, is beneficial. This way, Draco can ensure their safety
A-also….don’t question me on the vague bureaucracy and veto powers and the law 🙈🙈🙈🙈 It’s fine! All fine!
has been on Draco’s mind, especially after his conversation with Pansy that morning. The dragon blood in his veins means that his blood is no longer suitable for spells calling for human blood.
Harry’s face grows serious. He closes the ring box and stares at Draco. “Aren’t you forgetting something?”
The Saturday of Halloween begins with a lot of loud talking and excitement. Blaise is on the Slytherin volunteer team, because he’s charming and has a good eye for decoration. Meanwhile, Slytherin Commons is bustling with the rearrangement of furniture and wizardspace for their Samhain event.
. Secondly, perhaps the other professors should have thought to hold a Yule ritual too. How many years has it been since we’ve slowly forgotten the old ways? What happened to the old classes on magical rituals?” Draco’s lips curve up, but his eyes are not smiling. “Can we blame this entirely on the Ministry...or on internal agents of Hogwarts?”
Something similar is happening at Hogwarts. New afternoon classes have been established for all students one to learn about muggle history and culture—and not just arbitrary components of muggle technology—and another to learn about magical history and culture.
On Saturday morning, Draco finds Jamie drawing something. When he looks over, he sees a picture of a big ugly duck labelled "MR MALFOY" and a lot of baby ducklings all labelled with various Slytherins' names.
A burst of protectiveness flooded Draco’s chest. His cock hardened again, but he forced himself to stay still.
Malfoy’s eyes were deep, his tone had a hint of indulgence. “Your work has been translated into many languages. Congratulations.”
Harry’s about to retort when Malfoy’s tone catches up to him. Good sense exiting his brain like the free breeze, Harry leans backwards in the cart, closer to Malfoy, and winks. “I’m
The Defence Professor frowns slightly. “Ms Adams, if you recall, I detailed our entire course plan in the very first lesson of the year. Werewolves are
Harry tilts his head back into Draco’s hand, a grateful look in his green emerald eyes. “Thanks, Draco.”
The next day, Sunday, is the last full day of the Winter Break; on Monday, students who went home will be travelling back to Hogwarts.
“Hmm.” Draco smiles knowingly without answering. He pulls out some of the shield badges from his pockets and hands them out to some of the students—including Jamie—who are willing to head to the Great Hall for dinner.
As part of this, they need a lot of new glass. One of the Hogwarts alumni happens to be skilled at making glass, so some of the Slytherins are sent off to learn how to make panes of glass, both clear and stained, out of the sand from the shore of the Black Lake.
“Once a week is not enough. Send me your schedule and I’ll see what other days I can come by. Today, I have to leave at 10:30.”
“Are you sure?” Draco says. There is something delicious about stirring up this imaginary jealousy. A twist of fingers has Harry moaning.
It takes a few minutes for all the Slytherins to congregate. The upper years take the sofas, arranging them to face Garren, while the lower years sit on the carpet.
Draco’s chuckle was low and warm. His hands trailing down Harry’s sides was the only warning he had before Draco lifted him entirely.
“You little slut, you were so hungry for my cock even when you’re asleep. Dreaming of getting fucked, weren’t you?”
Harry’s eyes snapped open. He turned his head the other way and suddenly met blue eyes on a freckled face.
To the awe of the students, the block of stone floats over the Hogwarts site, aligning itself right at the center. The magic is so thick that it is visible to everyone present, pearlescent and glowing.
The events of last week, of the allegations that Aegis had attacked Hogwarts students, are brought back to the forefront.
“...I miss you,” Draco said truthfully. “I missed the shit we used to get up to.” He shook his head. “But I understand that your partner comes first, I
going back to your house. You don’t deserve to be a father!” Nolan retorts. “Go away! Why did you come here anyway?”
The little bow their heads sadly as Draco leaves them behind. The thestral leader takes them directly to a large fallen oak log.
Here, Hogwarts’ magic is strongest. Harry can also sense Draco’s magic filling in the gaps where Slytherin’s magic should be.
“It would be a lot more comfortable if there was more than one fireplace in Gryffindor,” Neville says wistfully. It has always been that the biggest, strongest group gets to claim the place closest to the fire on cold nights.
“Not useful. Where would one find all the relevant items and locations out here? Though of course, apparating elsewhere
It’s been two weeks since McGonagall officially took the lead in the rebuilding, and today, the Minister for Magic among others will be returning to Hogwarts to evaluate their progress. Since every student has contributed in some form to the rebuilding, they are collectively a mix between excitement and tension.
“Y-yeah.” Harry shakes off the tingling feeling. “I should have recorded that. Draco Malfoy thinks my
Draco and Felicity together have charmed snowflakes to fall from the ceiling, dissipating before they reach the ground. With Blaise and his team, the giant Balsam fir tree glitters and glows. Then, everyone takes their wrapped presents and places them under the tree.
They leave together, and Harry introduces Malfoy to the messier points of muggle food culture. Well—messy for Harry, when Malfoy insists on using a knife and fork on his hamburger, even going as far as to transfigure the plastic available ones to metal. (But then again, that’s what Harry likes about Malfoy, right?)
The Ministry End-of-War Anniversary event is in the evening. Plenty of time for Draco to lube Harry up beforehand.
They do: such that the Minister and the Aurors are together on one side, with Harry and Draco on the other.
Hermione shrugged. “I talked to Malfoy after Harry told us he was having weekly dinners with Malfoy.”
if you allow them to,” Pansy spits out. “I should make you feel the same pain that Harry did…” She sneers when Creevey shivers.
If Harry can pull all of them together in a room, Luna and Neville and Hannah, along with Draco—or maybe Blaise—then they would truly form some kind of rudimentary house
Harry opens one green eye, snickering. “Go to sleep, Malfoy,” he says in a sing-song voice. “Don’t stay up past your bedtime.”
But then Harry asked Draco yet another question, then another. About Draco’s friends, about whether Draco heard the latest Quidditch match between the Tornados and the Arrows, about what Draco learnt to cook.
The Gryffindor and Ravenclaw Towers now have gender-neutral dormitory wings, with separate shared and single suites (by the power of wizarding space), and enlarged common areas in line with the other two Houses. The Owlery has also been expanded.
It was inevitable that one day, Harry would find a steady, long term partner. It was inevitable that the two of them wanted to move in together.
They don’t step aside, instead stepping forward and pushing the Ministry team back. The Ministry team point their wands at the thestrals.
.” The sharp, deep tone tugs forth a burst of memories as the features resolve into a grown up Draco Malfoy. Malfoy yanks his robes back from the grip of one of the goblins. “It’s just
“No, you, don’t be sorry. But I’m not sitting at the Slytherin table anymore. Looking at Malfoy’s face...makes me want to punch him.”
The small werewolf settles into sleep. Draco gives them one last pat and stands up. After thinking a bit, Draco casts a one-way shield: it will allow the werewolf to leave, but prevent anyone else from entering the circle. The shield is timed to dissipate upon sunrise.
Hogwarts is his home. It’s not meant to look like this. Why didn’t they try harder? Why did this happen? Who were the damned people who put that Anti-Slytherin bill to the Wizengamot? Harry would like to throw them back in time to face off Voldemort for him!
“Felicity, lead everyone out!” Draco’s heart beats like a drum. The dragon rises dangerously close to his skin.
Draco’s smirk widens. “Too scared that you wouldn’t be able to beat me for the top position in Slytherin?”
Somehow, Draco and the Slytherins had established a kind of proto-loyalty bond that emerged naturally due to the responsibility Draco feels to the Slytherins, and the Slytherins’ loyalty in response.

He rests his hand against a stone wall. Under his hand, he can feel that it is a lot more stable and alive. After learning from Draco, he knows how to send a parcel of magic to Hogwarts. Hogwarts replies with a small pulse of magic, making Harry’s lips curl up.
So Draco acquiesced, and helped modify the clothes to Harry’s frame and the current silhouette. He enjoyed the process of taking the clothes
Harry seems to believe that Malfoy has changed. And on the surface, Hermione can see that too. But she doesn’t believe Malfoy’s core has changed. If she
, would Draco have killed Voldemort for him? Or would Harry have been pulled to the other side? No...Draco now is different from Draco before.
While the fact that Draco has been to the Ministry invigorates the discussion about whether Draco Malfoy is really the unregistered animagus, this news is overshadowed by the revelation that the members of Aegis have been held in the Ministry cells
Lucius is sitting in the Manor library, with the candles barely lighting up the thick books he reads.
“My muggle cousin liked chasing me and kicking me,” Harry says, shrugging. Saying it like it means nothing helps Harry feel like it’s nothing. It’s not important anymore, anyway.
When Harry opens up his bakery, there’s a rather handsome shop-outfitter who helps him set up. He comes by on the regular after too, and Harry’s suddenly struck with,
Right now, Minerva McGonagall, Kingsley Shacklebolt, and Filius Flitwick are circling the ruins of Hogwarts.
Harry’s stomach swooped, exhilarated at the easy way Draco held him. Harry quickly wrapped his arms around Draco’s neck, placing his head under Draco’s chin.
a hypothetical exercise. And if you’re afraid of the transfiguration reversing then you should practice and cast it
: *is conflicted whether he wants Draco to put them on because what if Draco looks way too good in them????*
Malfoy was attentive in listening, and showed no disdain for Harry’s profession. As such, Harry’s psychological defensive barrier went down and he eagerly told Malfoy all about his work—it also helped that Malfoy was the first new person who Harry
Draco pulls a face, because he can’t argue with that, and Harry knows that Draco knows it. “Then keep your arms there,” he orders. After ensuring Harry’s compliance, he nudges one of Harry’s legs over his shoulder, gripping the base of his own cock with the other hand. He thrills with anticipation as the head of his cock nudges against Harry’s arse. He exhales as Harry’s body opens up for him. Perfect. Like coming home. Draco runs affectionate fingers up Harry’s skin as his cock settles into the tight heat.
“As if I’ll let you go alone with those snakes,” Ginny says with a roll of her eyes. At the same time, she’s putting some slices of fruit on Luna’s plate.
“Why not?” A sense of reflexive indignation strikes Hermione. She has talked with Professor Coates about these trips, so a criticism of Coates, by association, becomes a criticism of Hermione.
In the next lesson, Professor Flitwick hands out some charmed paper that will allow them to draw blueprints just like the professionals! He shows them yet more spells they need in order to create a sketch and have it project into three-dimensions.
for him as the Head of Slytherin, let him do what he wants! Only when he fails will he acknowledge the words of his superiors and elders.”
Blaise’s charming smile disappears. “The Gryffindors think we cheated in the match yesterday. They’ve a petition to disqualify the Slytherin team.”
“Oh yeah, I keep forgetting about that...anyway, finally done? You can’t delay the seeker competition anymore, Draco!”
...This was exactly what Harry’s afraid she would ask. “I still remember your password when I talked to you last week…?”
It doesn’t take long for the younger students to gather with the cards to their newest game, imaginatively called Card-Fight. Everyone contributes to making various types of cards, but to make it fair, they’re all put together and randomly distributed before each game. Harry plops himself down right with them as they split up into twos and fours to battle it out.
The next morning is Saturday, the day of the first Quidditch match. Aster’s injuries have completely disappeared. Pomfrey reluctantly lets Aster leave on the condition that they come back for a check up every day for a week.
And she’s energised to counter whatever excuses the Ministry team will try to give. On Monday, she will fight for the students’ right to take over Hogwarts construction and build it the way it should be built.
Hermione’s eyes widen. “Non-assessed, open to all,” she mutters. “It would have to be after classes, or on the weekend.”
“Yep, that’s right, even though we’ve been dating for only two-ish weeks, I’ve decided to cheat on you with Hogwarts,” Harry says promptly, wriggling around.
And so, what is Harry learning these days? Draco’s body, for one. Draco’s cock in particular, and those
“Don’t defend me, Potter.” Draco channels the voice he uses on first years on the first night at Hogwarts. “
After swapping notes with his two friends, Draco learns that Pansy’s experience was along the lines of, “
Other small modifications appear overnight, like wide window seats, and a previously designated classroom magically turns into a student lounge room.
McGonagall’s eyes flash. Many of them are past Hogwarts students. One of them is Ben Taylor’s uncle. Not all of them are muggleborns, but they are all non-Slytherins. Respectable witches and wizards with masteries, businesses, even positions in the Ministry.
Harry’s smile turns bright and giddy. “Thanks.” He moves on, handing every person in Slytherin a gift.
Harry scoops up a bit of tart and a bit of ice cream and shoves it romantically into Draco’s mouth, before using the same spoon to take a bite himself.
“And Aegis can pretend they had nothing to do with it,” Draco says with a scoff. “But the second secret is why I didn’t die.”
Draco folds his arms across his chest, and the Hufflepuffs falter in their attacks. It’s clearly not working. Draco’s still standing.
Castles were historically built near stone quarries, and Hogwarts is similar—of course, “close” for wizards is different from “close” for muggles. Two members of the Wizengamot team go to the nearby quarry to cut up new stones.
McGonagall continues: “Very, very few parts of the castle were built by just one person. Instead, Hogwarts itself is a weave of all four of the Founders,
In the top drawer of Harry’s desk at Grimmauld Place is Malfoy’s thank-you letter from right after the War trials. There are also a lot of Harry’s old notes from trying to figure out Malfoy’s plots back in Hogwarts, little questions and clues that makes Harry shake his head and smile at his young, naive self.
Malfoy thinks all his contract papers and legislation compliance forms would be much too difficult for Harry to understand (“Bah!” Harry says.)
Harry holds Draco’s hand back for a moment. He straightens, his gaze becoming firm. “Hermione, right now, I’m a Slytherin. I
tone sounds and feels a lot like Nolan’s. The third year Slytherins move aside as Potter rushes up to Draco’s bed. Nolan glares at Potter, but Potter ignores it.
Left alone in the side-alley, Draco Malfoy’s gaze on Harry’s departing back turned complex. He took out a small compact that was his direct connection to Pansy Parkinson.
On Thursday afternoon, after classes, both Draco and Harry are called up to McGonagall’s Head Office.
McGonagall looks down on Hitchly. “Did I not say that you’re not allowed to call Mr Malfoy in for questioning?”
McGonagall drinks something that smells like extra concentrated coffee. “Mr Malfoy, Mr Potter,” she says heavily. “Take a seat.”
After eating together and washing the dishes, they tacitly went to the familiar living room. Draco sat down first and pulled Harry onto his lap.
Harry’s magic explodes out of the shattered orb, sharp and intense and a shade before overwhelming. It rushes, trying to find a home, trying to find its original home. Some of the puny Gryffindors cry out; portraits flee their paintings, and the weave of Hogwarts’ magic ruptures.
Draco raises one eyebrow in response. He summons his robes and pulls them on before picking up a piece of meat and handing it to the nosy thestral.
After Unspeakable Nightshade paints the broad strokes of what will happen, different members of the Ministry team step up to detail their particular focus, painting a picture of a dry, utilitarian castle of long corridors and identical classrooms, with Hogwarts artifacts displayed like a museum.
illusion of the castle upon the cleared Hogwarts site. Images of the inner rooms appear first, filling out until the walls of the castle appear. The lines and patterns and textures are too even to be realistic, but nonetheless, it looks amazing. Lee Jordan, the press representative, takes multiple pictures.
Harry has no idea how long they stand there smiling, but Harry’s smile must not be confounding enough, because Malfoy is all intent again on seeing Harry’s
“Go back to your common room,” Filch says, glaring, while his other hand holds out a piece of meat for Mrs Norris.
Harry nearly jumps when Malfoy touches his back to push him. They walk to a part of the mezzanine study floor where the seventh years and eighth years have gathered. The seventh years ignore him. Parkinson gives him a quick smirk that Harry doesn’t understand.
The adults give him space, but the little thestrals loop in the air—or try to, at least. One of them tumbles, and Draco uses the tip of his snout to nudge it upright. Thestrals, like winged abraxans, were not naturally suited for aerial acrobatics.
Harry knew this story very well. He had written it, after all. So instead of looking at the pages, his gaze would
hot chocolate, Malfoy makes it for us, can you believe it? And study time is structured too. Malfoy and Parkinson have set up this system where the older students tutor the younger students. Some of the younger students are trying to teach me sign language too...”
Draco gave a short tug on Harry’s shirt, just enough to make Harry’s eyes widen. “Should I kiss you?”
Harry carefully feeds the potion to Draco, but most of it dribbles out. He’s afraid of making Draco choke. He’s not sure it helped at all. Draco still feels just as cold.
, then combined with a dragon’s natural defense against magical and physical attacks, he’s confident he can take down his enemies without too much trouble.
Dinner tonight was at a refined Muggle Japanese restaurant. The decor was earthy wood and delicate flowers, and the music was soft and not overwhelming. Malfoy had already ordered a miniature feast for two. The waiters brought out numerous small plates with different dishes and a teapot of green tea.
The thestrals also come by. Draco gets up to greet them, but the thestral leader doesn’t let her herd play with him long, physically nudging Draco back towards the nest. Clearly, she’s telling him
Draco set Harry down on their bed. The lights were moderately dim, with dark corners and a soft glow just around the bed. The temperature of the air warmed up to balance each layer of clothing that Draco took off Harry.
“In light of recent events, our new topic is on charms for magical construction. I will teach you some fundamental charms, and then I’ll split you all into groups that you can design your own ideal charms classroom. Using the spells you’ve learnt, you will make small models, and the best design has a chance of being constructed in full size with the help of the seventh years!”
,” Harry blurts out. Starts to make a story about not noticing things, before he stops, and shuts up.
Draco lets the silence grow. And then he lets it extend some more when Potter starts getting shifty.
Draco turns to Harry. “I understand your loyalties are conflicted. It goes without saying...that you
Draco grimaces. He forces himself to take a deep breath and count all the bonds between him and his Slytherins. Right now, no Slytherin is in immediate danger nor pain. “I’ll be fine. Let’s go.”
The gossip’s torn between what actually happened though: either Draco was left a mess after being verbally ripped into, or Draco had been conniving and evil and
Nolan’s eyes go watery. “Mr Malfoy…” He runs between Harry and Draco and hugs Draco tightly around the waist.
enough for him to quickly head out to Tescos to buy some store-brand cereal and a tiny pint of milk for breakfast.
Madam Pomfrey’s brows crease. “Mr Potter, magical infusions must be done carefully. Magical rejection is even more disastrous than organ rejection—”
Outside, Blaise and Pansy are looking towards Hogwarts castle. In the distance, the Slytherins are hurrying towards them.
Voices came to a gargled stop. Those who were smart quickly swallowed their words. They could see that the overbearing Solicitor Draco Malfoy was clearly kissing someone against the wall. Several of them felt an icy chill down their backs when Malfoy turned his cold gaze to them. He did
But Draco is faster. His claws emerge, tightening their grip on the orb. Then, he starts to crush it.
“Come here,” Draco beckons him, patting the bed space next to him. “We’ll leave Pansy to sleep on the cold edge.”
, it starts rolling to him. It’s burning hot, Harry’s magic concentrated all inside. Draco’s lip curls up in distaste.
Harry cleared his throat. “Um. Malfoy. Sorry about running into you. I bet you want to be on your way.”
To Draco’s surprise, Harry came back. He thought Ron and Hermione would have reminded Harry that he had better things to do, but he was back. And he had an overnight bag too.
“Best not to have such a Map fall into Pansy’s hands...Morganna knows what horrors she could enact with that. No secret would be safe.”
Flitwick sighs heavily, and pats Draco on the knee. “You’re only eighteen. You don’t need to bear the world on your shoulders.”
“A date, we haven’t had that...well, except for how we go to sleep together every single night,” Harry muses.
“Draco!” Harry grunts as he pulls the fainted Draco towards him. There’s sticky blood on his arms and stomach. Draco’s face is pale, so pale, and his body is
While they looked down the side alley in longing, they did not dare to walk past Draco Malfoy to check whether or not Harry Potter truly left. If they did, wouldn’t that make Malfoy think that they didn't believe him? People
Blaise’s face is annoyingly calm...but Jamie’s face is mixed with nervousness and excitement. And Harry looks like he knows, his eyes urging Draco to come closer.
Harry’s mouth dried when Draco undid his trousers and pulled out his cock. It was so...pale. And big.
Greyback’s eyes narrow. His hand twitches. Draco slashes fire, just in time as Greyback launches himself forward.
“I want to see myself,” Harry says firmly. He starts towards the front stairs, not particularly caring whether or not anyone follows him.
“Fuck, that shit death eater!” she curses. She tentatively starts to walk back into the Forest, but keeps throwing glances backward to the way out.
Draco gives Blaise a disgruntled look. “I merely wonder why on earth your expertise could possibly be superior to mine.”
Harry goes first. “I, Harry James Potter, love you and I promise to love you always.” He stops. “That’s it.”
But the implications of that...Draco, the person who let Death Eaters into the school, who then caused Hogwarts’ destruction...
Pansy immediately understands. “In this matter, I’ve already coordinated with Madame Pomfrey, she’s safe, understood? Winter Break would be the perfect time to start.”
Yet, that time inevitably came. Harry slipped into bed on his usual side and wrapped himself up in his blankets like a burrito. Nothing was getting in nor out, and definitely nothing was going to be moving in-and-out!
“Yes. How surprising that I like to spend time with you.” Each of Malfoy’s words were even and measured, without a hint of a joke in his tone.
Draco stretched his legs out, plopping his feet right on Harry’s lap. Harry’s eyes widened further, his gaze darting down.
Draco’s magic washed over them in a rather good cleaning charm. “Well, I must say,” Draco drawled, voice curling into Harry’s ears. “Not bad, though I’ll have to compare it with your arse performance later.”
“This is your reward,” Draco says. He takes his fingers out, lines his cock up with Harry’s hole, and thrusts right into the warm and welcoming channel.
-like look that makes Draco want to sneer at, and Snape...Portrait Snape’s eyes are black and unreadable.
Harry’s heart leaps to his throat, turning slowly to Hermione. It’s past midnight, and he didn’t expect anyone to still be up. With the invisibility cloak in one hand and the map in the other, he knows full well how incriminating his looks.
Their first stop...is the thestrals’ glade. They stir upon Draco’s arrival. The little ones trot to Draco’s side, but Draco nudges them away.
He and Aster have only the most preliminary charms against ill-intentioned physical attacks on the protego badges. They’ve had to cast protective charms right onto the clothes. That
one would let the lamb cutlets marinate naturally, but realistically, Harry used a charm to help the flavours penetrate through. The coated lamb hit the grill with a loud
Having learnt his lesson, after Malfoy’s owl left with the reply, Harry immediately started preparing for dinner. Today, this meant making chicken stock and chicken ramen soup. He also prepared all the different components, so that serving it later would be quick and easy. And Harry decided to pair it with a strong hojicha tea. This way, Malfoy won’t give him that little smirk for serving milk.
“It’s very lovely, just like its owner,” Draco said as he slowly stroked him. His fingers and hand were bigger than Harry, so it felt a little weird. But when Draco did that little squeeze and twist, a traitorous groan slipped from Harry’s lips.
Someone sets up a gramophone playing traditional Christmas songs and students bustle around to complete the Christmas decorations.
The model baseline is how much we can predict using very simple strategies, such as assigning every work to the most prolific author. We can only consider our model successful if it beats the results of this baseline.
, why do they close parks?” Harry grouched when they exited the park, his cheeks flushed dark with the cold. “Let’s just go for a walk anyway.”
. How much magic does a dragon need to sustain itself? Not to mention all the bonds that Draco is constantly maintaining, and any injuries being transferred to
“Living in close quarters with you and your friends would have been tantamount to torture,” Draco replies.
Harry’s ear-tips go red. “Stuck up prat,” he grumbles. He lifts his head a little, and his gaze falls upon the downed Gryffindors. “Draco...what happened?”
Subtly, Draco nudges Blaise, and with good humour, Blaise goes up to speak with Garren and leads him out of Slytherin.
“Draco,” Pansy says, quickly walking up to him. “Some students spotted Potter walking out of the castle, and some of the Quidditch team spotted him by the Forest this afternoon.”
Harry slowly leads Malfoy into the house. Shows him the kitchen, the dining, the living spaces. The bathrooms, the bedrooms, the library (
“I don’t care,” Pansy tosses her hair. “Unless you want me to worry so much that I can’t sleep tonight and then I’ll come tomorrow morning, all ill and—”
Harry went up to the top floor of Grimmauld Place, where Charlie had set up a nifty and cosy little owlery. There were nooks and crannies of different shapes and sizes, hardwood perches and soft bedding. Water and food were dispensed on one side of the room, and on the other side, owls could do their business.
were the one waxing poetry about Ravenclaw girls.” The owls come at the perfect time, and Draco unfolds his Saturday
Clothes don’t transform with the person. To save clothes, the students have to strip before the transformation occurs. Draco casts a heavy warming charm around the area, so that Nolan isn’t cold as he takes off his clothes. Draco also turns around as the moon rises.
“If you...if you don’t want Professor Coates around, then that is fine,” Hermione finally says. “We can ask Professor McGonagall if the other professors can supervise us.”
Harry’s ears are hot. “Yes. Yes!” He grabs his toiletries and hurries into a bathroom, brain too fried to think about why Parkinson just exited one of them (because there are
“...” Longbottom is now dressed in clothing that looks a lot like his own (but more expensive) with a breakfast muffin in one hand and cup of coffee in the other.
If he goes to the Forest, he’ll be even further away from his Slytherins. They’re more important. Draco ruthlessly squashes the flame in his stomach, squishing into a tiny inferno and wrapping the dragon around it.
wand—flies from its wand hostler into his hand. In a heartbeat, the wand points to Garren’s chest. “You want me to respect you? Then defeat me.” Draco smiles cockily. “Go on, I’ll be benevolent and allow you the first spell.”
Pansy makes a face. She goes up and pokes Harry in the chest. “No, I’m simply ensuring that you and Draco don’t move at a glacial pace. I’m afraid everyone will know that you’re married before either of you even think about proposing to each other.”
Draco watches Potter’s receding back until he and Blaise turn away. Potter being suspicious is no surprise. He heads back inside the potions laboratory.
But Pansy and Blaise came, and Draco tries not to think about what kind of miserable fuck he would have been without them. And he doesn’t fault Greg for staying away—he knows Greg is happier working his community service hours than going back to school.
Potter retorts back at Granger, and looks directly at Draco as he makes his way towards them. Granger and Weasley are forced to follow.
Blaise and Felicity, at the head of the group, check the safety of the staircase first, before allowing the group to move up.
Professor Garren greets them at the door to his office and leads them inside. Hermione stares at all the books lining the bookshelves, her eyes brightening and for a moment, it feels like old times.
“—and so to build Hogwarts, you people need to add in Slytherin. Magically-structurally, it’s necessary.”
If Granger and Weasley are Potter’s overprotective parents, then Ginevra and Lovegood are like the annoying cousins of the same generation. (Except for when Lovegood makes odd older-generation-y comments.)
Draco summons the bottle of lube and slicks his fingers. He swirls one over Harry’s perineum, up, then down. Harry makes tiny shifting motions that Draco doubts he’s even aware of.
To be honest, tired overworked Robards is like my fave new thing to write hahahaha. For some reason, I just want to see him increasingly overworked…
Draco sinks his magic into the castle around him. It is different this morning, more rich and deep. The other professors must have conducted some strengthening yule rituals. He murmurs a quiet
Draco changed out of his robes, and into a sleeping robe. Harry had already gotten into bed, covers pulled up to his nose, green eyes sparkling.
That night, the thestrals remain on watch. There is nothing the Ministry team can do to the Slytherin building.
A mixture of worry and exasperation intertwine in Draco’s chest. The worry is eased knowing that his bond with Jamie is stable, and that the house-elves will also help keep him safe.
He takes Malfoy up to the attic—thinks, for a moment that maybe he could try and seduce Malfoy one more time, except Malfoy’s face is
tall as long as Harry stood a bit away from him. Hmm, six feet and...three inches? Four? Five? Harry’s neck tilted back as he tried to estimate.
While some Aurors get to be present—guards to various Ministry visitors, especially Kingsley Shacklebolt—Hitchly can only sit in the office as a desk Auror after his demotion. Not only does Hitchly have desk work, but he also has to study the new fairer laws and regulations that are being put forward.
: I won’t be marrying Aunt Pansy. Nolan, be nice to your poor dad, he’s currently suffering through NEWTs level classes.
It’s evening by the time the two of them return. Draco side-alongs Harry back into the Forbidden Forest and they walk the rest of the way. Any ‘injuries’ from their activities quickly fade away as Draco’s automatic healing takes over.
to some of the students brave enough to ask. Which is a shame, because there goes Pansy’s masterplan for selling exclusive Harry Potter signings.
Potter’s hesitant at first, and maybe to a human like him, a thestral’s teeth may look intimidating. But after Draco sternly tells them not to bite poor Potter, the foals take the meat out of Potter’s hands with exaggerated care, and one brave (or daft) foal even licks Potter’s hand, startling a laugh out of Potter.
The other students guiltily remember what they did last night. But there had been food, and a warm and safe place to sleep...why did the
Pansy, who did flee, dashes back. “Merlin, Harry! I’m so fucking glad you’re okay! Draco, where’s the soul orb? We need to take it in as evidence…” She grabs Draco’s shoulder, and whispers, “
Malfoy scoffs and taps Harry on the head. “Stop procrastinating. Look at that potion colour, it’s time for the next step.”
It’s a good thing that Draco doesn’t enter the bedrooms of the younger students, or he’ll be speechless at what he finds.
Flooing back to his study in Malfoy Manor, Draco stripped off his dark-blue solicitor robes and ran a hand through his hair. Harry Potter’s face bloomed in his mind, especially his hesitant expression when Draco was about to leave.
There’s a breaking sensation that Minerva McGonagall can feel. She turns her head to the front wall, knowing that she can’t stop what will happen next.
Draco holds his breath. Potter’s recent behavior suggests he’ll be sorted into Hufflepuff, though perhaps he has hidden depths that will place him in Ravenclaw. Wouldn’t it be so ironic if Potter resorted into Gryffindor again?
of study, because all the assessments due before the Yule break are being given out, and the Slytherins seem to not believe in the Homework Method called Doing It Last Minute.
One must say that Pansy’s efficiency, and the efficiency of those she contracted, is quite terrifying because on the next evening, Draco returns from some work on Hogwarts castle with the other Head of Houses only to find that Harry is hugging a large dragon plush in bed.
Jamie is quite sure that Professor Flitwick isn’t like Mr Malfoy who has eyes on the back of his head.
Harry’s eyes squeezed shut, lips parting, cheeks flushed. His cock throbbed in Draco’s hand, spilling under the water.
The student shrieks, turning around. It’s Mary Green, Gryffindor, wearing in black clothing with a camera in one hand and a
Harry’s lips seemed to feel every single movement. A coarse wet tongue touched Harry’s bottom lip. Harry’s mouth parted automatically, and to his shock, Draco’s tongue slipped inside. Harry reflexively reached out to grab Draco by the shoulders.
“We’ll have to set up surveillance charms around the corridors,” Draco says, scanning the corridor around them. The paintings are pretending they didn’t see anything. “Felicity might know some good charms for large spaces.”
“What Mr Malfoy did is not illegal,” McGongall retorts. “If the Ministry can prove that he separated Slytherin from Hogwarts, then so what? Hogwarts is not under the purview of the Ministry! And as the Headmistress, I
Harry only catches a glimpse of Pansy's knowing expression before Draco tugs his glasses off for him.
Pansy smirks. “What do you mean? I did nothing wrong at all. Also, you let Harry sleep in? You’re getting soft, Draco.”
, I thought it would be awkward if we slept with you,” she says. She points to the other door. “Your bed and bathroom is through here. And I have this—” She summons a large pillow with Draco’s image on it. “This has a Long Lasting Warming Charm.” Pansy sighs sadly. “I’ll have to use this as a replacement for you.”
“Fuck, Draco!” Blaise wraps his arms around Draco, pulling him away from the stairs. Draco bites back a cry of pain, but Blaise is much too good to miss it. He turns Draco around and tugs open his robes. Blood has soaked his inner white shirt red.
“Harry,” Hermione prods him, breaking him of his thoughts. “Are you even practicing? We have tests and assignments due next week, this is important! Don’t tell me you haven’t done them…”
Harry gave a short chuckle. “Hmm.” He pushed himself up and landed a short kiss on Draco’s lips. “Are you okay?”
“I don’t have to go home this Winter Break!” Francis says happily. He shows Pansy the letter has been clutching to his chest.
: *pats Draco's arm, very serious* Sorry, sir, but you can't play with us. Because you melt all the snowballs, no one wants you on your team
Draco knows that Charlie knows that Draco knows that Charlie wants to see Draco’s dragon form again, the
that Harry didn’t know more about Malfoy’s current going-abouts. All he knew was what Hermione once mentioned, a.ka., that during her job at the Minister’s Office at the Ministry, she had worked with him on some legal issues.
Something has shifted between them, as Malfoy returns to Grimmauld Place almost every evening. Harry grows increasingly enamoured by those late night days where they sit in front of the fireplace, sat opposite ends of the sofa, legs tangled under a blanket as Malfoy reads some large tome that shimmers when Harry tries to look at it (some secret Unspeakable thing that Malfoy always hedges about before diving into the way-too-jargony specifics, the wanker), while Harry reads 1890s cook books. Harry always quickly abandons his books, and teases Malfoy into chatting, and Malfoy always follows, no matter how disgruntled he may look. Harry doesn’t remember what they chat about, but he enjoys it immensely.
“I have Care of Magical Creatures with Hagrid on Wednesday afternoon, maybe you can ask him to let you join. Though be forewarned that the thestrals might come too.”
Draco’s cock hardened as he feasted upon the sight of Harry’s naked back and legs. The tip of his cock dripped precome, a vulgar pavlovian effect.
Oh, now one of the baby thestrals is running over to nudge Draco. It clearly wants Draco to transform so that they have a second dragon to play with. The students playing with the thestrals are also giving Draco pointed looks.
forte. Draco pulls a face and does his best. No time for pants, he summons a pair of trousers from his Hogwarts wardrobe, and manages to get them on just in time as Potter and Hagrid emerge from the Forest.
He bursts out over the Forest canopy, bright moon hanging overhead. He slows into a languid glide. It feels good to fly like this.
“He hasn’t signed the petition,” Blaise says slowly. “Felicity saw him heading up to speak with McGonagall. She expressly reminded me to tell you.”
Blaise holds back the distaste of heaving to crawl into the Hufflepuff Common Room. He spells his robes clean again once he’s inside.
There’s another two strikes against the wards, coming from opposite sides around the pitch. Then, more and more attacks occur. It’s not strongly coordinated, but the wards are already weakening under the onslaught.
That Harry knew that Draco would stop if he asked made Harry want to continue even more. Draco’s cock was hot and big, and Harry felt so stretched, but it didn’t
for them. He has to be proactive. The students from the other Houses—oh, let's not be so complimentary, as some of their actions have been clearly aided by Aegis—have forced his Slytherins to hide in their dungeons, have denied their ability to be free denizens of Hogwarts.
Every week, multiple Malfoy Owls also descend, carrying care packages for the grandchildren, while Draco gets nothing.
“It’s true,” Hermione said. “He’s a consultant with the Minister’s Office, though sometimes he also works with the DMLE.”
Snape glares at Harry, then glares at Draco. “Draco Malfoy! I should give you detention for your impudent actions!” he snaps. “Meddling in things you do not understand! I can look away from you befriending Potter, but this! Is unacceptable!”
curls up against Draco. Head on Draco’s arm. Arm over Draco’s stomach. Leg tangled with Draco’s legs. A certain part of him pressed against Draco’s hip…
Harry’s smile widens. He props his chin on his hand and says, “Who would have thought that you’re so good with children.”
