Hermione asked. "If it's never happened before, why is Dumbledore so sure he'll wake up?"
Harry looked up at Ron with a start. His friend's face was a deep shade of crimson, and his mouth was hanging open like a flytrap.
Draco slowly lifted his eyes from Harry's peaceful face and smiled regretfully across the room at Ron, his heart heavy.
"Nothing,'" Draco shook his head and turned to look into Harry's eyes as they walked. "You're just. . . gorgeous."
Hermione to hurry. He didn't know what to do. He felt tears burning in his eyes, and he tried to wipe them away, but he couldn't. Tonight was supposed to be happy.
Harry quickly sat down next to him again, grinning broadly, his piercing green eyes glowing. "What is it?" he asked, kissing one of his hands again. He couldn't stop himself.
Draco's smirk grew a thousand times wider. "Well, well, Potter. Aren't you the bold one?"
He agonized over the situation, wondering whether he had missed something, some little sign indicating that Draco had been silently suffering alone.  He couldn't think of anything. The Slytherin's thin, pallid cheeks had a touch of color in them now, and the dark, purple circles beneath his eyes had vanished,  and now, the shimmering silvery depths of them shone with life and new-found joy, a little mischievous twinkle catching in the light now and again.
"Yes? Who is it?"
Draco looked confused. "What?"
"Madam Pomfrey!" He screamed. Somehow, his voice seemed far away and distant, as if it were someone else's.
"Wait, where d'you think your going, young man?" Madame Pomphrey demanded, grabbing Draco's arm, "You have to rest!"
Draco shook his head a little. "No, I can't say it enough. I was so callous to the three of you. I had no right to say or do any of the things I did, and  . . . I'm embarrassed. So, I'm sorry."
"What? You were scared? Of what?! It was just a game of Quidditch."
Harry's grin broadened, and he swore he saw Draco's blush deepen when he looked back at him. The Slytherin was actually smiling. It wasn't a smirk or a self-righteous crooked twitch of his lips. It was completely and beautifully genuine. It stole Harry's breath away, honestly. Relishing this new-found confidence and feeling that he had a grip on something, Harry wrote another note on the crinkled, tired-looking parchment.
Still, seeing the two boys together, he couldn't help but smile. He had never seen Harry so happy in all the years that they had spent together, and Harry's girlish behavior made it all the more golden. Sometimes, he and Hermione shared a private laugh over it, but they had nothing but warm feelings of friendship for Malfoy in the end, despite all of the bad blood between them.
"Darling, are you alright?"
Draco doused his face with the cool water from the leaky faucet, gasping at the shocking sensation as the iciness of it made his cheeks burn. Breathless, he doused himself again, and then he turned the knob and looked up at his reflection in the bathroom mirror. He sighed. He looked hideous! Madame Pomphrey had been right to worry. His marble gray eyes were deeply set and rimmed in an almost velvety purple, while his cheeks were sunken and shallow. He looked almost as ill as the dreaded Hogwarts caretaker, old Mr. Filch. . .
Draco drew an unsteady breath and struggled to remember, furrowing his brow in thought. He couldn't remember much. He remembered boarding the Hogwarts Express, the confrontation with Ron Weasley and Harry Potter, and the uncomfortably awkward ride from the station. Damn it, the butterflies! Being around Harry again was almost unbearable. He felt bitter. He hated how Harry could so easily get in his head; how he could disable him with just a glance and a sultry whisper.
"Very well.  Come in!" The fat lady sounded tired,  too.
Draco's smirk softened and transformed into a look of awe and adoration. It was an expression that Harry found completely foreign on the Slytherin's face, and he giggled uncontrollably.
Draco laughed and playfully tousled Harry's messy hair before turning back to the Weasley twins.
"What?"
"It's my father," he muttered just barely under a whisper, his feet fixed to the stone floor.
Harry grinned back and sat up in his bed. "Hardly," he replied. "You going down for breakfast?"
"Why?" Ron demanded maliciously. "The slimy git deserved it."
As if prompted by Harry's own thoughts, the door squeaked open, and a handsome boy with white-blonde hair slowly walked in, his leather school bag tucked securely under his arm. Harry's eyes followed him longingly as the Slytherin took his seat, whispered a half-hearted greeting to Pansy, and listened attentively as she repeated the class assignment to him. He looked different today - strangely well-rested. The swelling of his eyes seemed to have gone down a little . . . Harry stared. He wasn't thinking. He was just looking. It was innocent, right?
Draco was almost half-inclined to walk, but he reconsidered when a sudden gust of wind made him shiver through his robes. Reluctantly, he walked down the platform and climbed into the carriage.
Draco sucked in a breath and wiped his nose on his sleeve.  "He hates me, " he sniffed. "He's hated me from the moment we met,  but. . . but I didn't.  At first,  I don't know...  I guess I was just infatuated with him.  I didn't even realize it,  and I was in denial.  When I finally understood what I was feeling, the feelings had already grown, and I didn't have time to deal with it.  I didn't know what to do!  I can't help myself! You have to understand,  Professor! There really is nothing I can do. How do you stop loving someone? "
Pansy grabbed his arm, "Are you sure you're alright?"
He was in love with a boy. Madly, head-over-heels in love with a boy, and he knew that they would face a heap of obstacles together. Not just Voldemort, but none-the-less, struggles just as challenging and just as painful. But which was the lesser of the two evils? He couldn't say.
What if he never became an Auror? What if his life turned out nothing like he hoped it would? What if . . . what if all he saw was nothingness. What if. . . ?
Looking down at Draco, he felt his stomach tie itself into knots, and he swallowed hard, his heart aching. Draco's skin had faded to a colorless gray. His face was bony and gaunt, and the circles around his eyes had darkened until now they were almost black. His hair looked more white than blonde as if all the life and color had left his body with his soul.
"Yes?" Professor Trelawney leaned in ever closer.
"Blimey, you look awful," he chuckled. "You get any sleep, mate?"
Lucius smirked coldly and pulled a folded piece of yellowed parchment from the breast-pocket of his waistcoat. He waved it through the air as if to taunt his son.
Ron followed Harry's gaze, and his shoulders slumped. "Oh, not again," he groaned. "Is she serious? How much are we really gonna learn from these bloody things?"
do you love him,  Draco? " Snape interrupted.
Harry struggled out of his Quidditch robes, doing the only thing he could think of. He wrapped it around Draco's violently shaking body and pulled him close, holding him tightly to his chest.
Draco spoke, and Ron was startled as he usually was by the softness in the Slytherin's voice.
Hermione's agitated voice broke Harry's concentration,  and he jumped a little,  looking at her questioningly over another spoonful of the pie.
The bigger boy jumped energetically out of the carriage. "Shove off, Malfoy, or I'll hex you this time." He spat back.
"'Mione," Ron swallowed hard and began to clutch at his throat as he sank back into his cushion, his body rigid with shock. "I can't fucking believe it."
It felt real; ultimately, that was what mattered the most. Draco felt happy. He felt perfectly content for the first time in years. He finally had what he had been desperately longing for, and now that he did, all of his previous concerns were melting away like the snow in early spring.
But, goddamnit! What did she mean by that?! Draco wondered, panicking. Did he know
"There you are," Madame Pomphrey's ragged breathing interrupted Draco's train of thought, and she slid her hands reassuringly across his shoulders, "C'mon, let's get back to bed now. There there, easy does it."
"Much."
"You're right." he sighed, "Let's go in."
"Harry, Draco, what happened? Are you okay?" She babbled, her eyebrows tightly furrowed as she reached out to give Draco a friendly touch on the shoulder. Her dark eyes widened when she saw his arm tucked into the sling.
"I love you, too."
. . .
Ron sputtered, but Hermione smiled instantly.
Trying not to overthink it, he sat down his quill before he could change it and began to fold the paper. He clumsily folded it into a unicorn shape and then pointed his wand at it again.
He was sitting in Potions beside Harry, who was staring at him with a horrified expression - along with the rest of the class. Everyone was whispering to each other. Professor Snape looked shocked, a completely different expression from the one he usually wore.
Draco met the angry Weasley's glare, but weakly. He attempted to stretch his lips into a challenging sneer, but instead, it looked like a bitter smile. His eyes, instead of surging with rage, were rather sinking with fatigue, rimmed in purple.
Ron watched him a moment, studying him thoughtfully before he stood and quietly approached him. He sat down across from Draco and then glanced down at Harry before a small smile began to form on his lips.
"Yeah. What of it?"
was one thing, but seeing them apart was another entirely. Harry was happy as could be, but deep down, something was troubling him, and he was determined not to talk about it. Draco, on the other hand, whenever he thought no one could see him, he would dissolve into tears of pain and anguish.
Harry nodded and gave Draco's hand another squeeze, trying to calm him.
"Bloody hell!"
He grabbed his wand from off the desk, mumbled another protection spell for extra measure, and then he tensely tucked the envelope into Bubo's snapping beak.
Harry scratched his scar awkwardly. "Well, erm, no reason. Just. . . yeah."
"Blimey, what is it?" Malfoy groaned.
Draco jumped slightly at the sound of his name, lifting his head with a start as he looked up in confusion. He shook the thoughts from his head with a toss of his silvery blonde hair. "Sorry, what was that?" he muttered with an apologetic smile.
. "a 'thank you' maybe?"
Boys.
"You don't know that, Ron."
, or did he just realize that his son was a "queer?" Draco could handle that much. But if his father knew
With that thought in mind,  he whispered, "He has his mother's eyes."
Harry didn't answer.
He didn't want his confession to be fresh on Harry's mind once they were around each other again for fear that the dark-haired boy would catch on. That was the last thing he wanted. He would crumble if Harry knew.
Draco swallowed hard. "I hate leaving you." he scoffed at how pathetic and whiny he sounded. Ashamed, he turned his back on Harry and retreated miserably to his table, eyes fixed on his black sneakers.  He hated himself. . .
Beneath the table, Harry felt Draco brush his hand and gingerly weave their fingers together. He smiled softly and glanced sideways at the Slytherin. He was sneering down at his plate.
Ron avoided his gaze, and Harry had an unsettling feeling that the "someone else" had been him.
Draco grimaced as he wrested open his tall, heavy window and helped the old bird up onto the grimy ledge. The sticky early September air suddenly filled the room as he watched his bird fly into the stormy, leaden sky, wings silhouetted against the looming clouds.
"Madam Pomfrey!" He shouted loudly, his voice cracking. "Madame Pomfrey?!" His voice boomed in the cavernous room, but no one came.
Ron signaled him over with his eyes, but Draco just stared back at him questioningly.
"Yes. Yes, indeed he has. And believe me, Draco. I most certainly will."
"Draco, you were very brave," Dumbledore reassured him as he left his desk and approached his students, the hem of his robes trailing on the floor behind him. "Very brave indeed. But you must be careful. Even inside Hogwarts, you are in grave danger. Both of you."
Fighting the urge to look up, Draco smiled down at his book; his pale white cheeks flushed a delicate shade of pink. All of the inky black words were blurred together as he slowly flipped through the pages, blending to form nothing but completely meaningless sentences and phrases. He just smiled. His cheeks began to ache, but he couldn't have cared less. His heartfelt lighter than feathers. He felt like he was soaring through the clouds on his broomstick. Draco wasn't familiar with this feeling. He'd dreamed of this feeling, wondering what it was like, and now that he was experiencing it, it felt like a dizzy dream.
"What?" Harry demanded.
He didn't need any more reminders of his fate. He had plenty of other constant reminders that he had to face every single day, and the biggest one of all stared right back at him in the mirror.
my letter?" he shouted, furious. "You took it and
This time, Draco looked seriously sick. "No . . ."
Severus Snape glared down his long, hooked nose at Harry with a snarling expression. "Don't you have somewhere to be?"
"Now go."
"Okay," Draco swallowed hard and nodded. "Okay, let's go."
Ronald Weasley with his headful of brilliantly red hair, shouldered his way over, his skin sheen with sweat. He gave Draco a strange but curious look, and Harry's smile broadened.
"As usual, Snape almost put me to sleep with his lecture." Harry joked, grinning adorably up at Malfoy. He stood up and tucked his book securely under his shoulder. "Today, I have no recollection of what the bloody hell it was about. Have you?"
Hermione looked baffled by Harry's apology.  She simply shared a glance with Ron and then took a reluctant sip of her pumpkin juice. Harry sighed and looked back down at his plate,  prodding his sliver of pie with his utensils.
"But he didn't harm Harry!"
"What kind of question is that?"
Dumbledore hummed in acknowledgment and then looked up at Madame Pomfrey hopefully. "Has Harry stopped by at all recently?"
looked at him. He could still feel himself trembling. He could still see Harry's emerald eyes locked on his from across the room, remembering how his heart had begun beating wildly in his chest. Enemies and friends never looked at each other like that. Never.
Draco's eyes fell, "S-sir, " he said slowly before gulping in air. "Harry. . . Harry isn't to blame. It's. . . it's just me." He wrapped his arms around himself for comfort. "He doesn't love me. "
Harry felt as though his heart were breaking.
Suddenly, excited voices stirred below, and Harry whirled around, instantly alert. He saw Draco tumbling down the stairs, his back twisted at an unnatural angle as he went, eyes rolled to the back of his sunken sockets.
Draco's blood was boiling, his face hot, his hands trembling with rage. "You
Harry had lost track of how much time had passed since the Quidditch match, and he had no idea how long Malfoy had been in the infirmary. All he knew was that he was tired. He was tired of worrying, tired of fretting endlessly over his crush, wondering whether he would ever get better. Just when he had begun to think that Draco had finally managed to get back on his feet, his condition had only seemed to get worse.
If Fred's smile were any wider, Draco swore that his face might have split in two. "Just one quick question before we go."
"He's been like this ever since Divination," Ron filled him in quietly, uncertain as to what details he was able to share. "You'll just have to . . . ask him yourself. And please, bloody take him! I'm not used to seeing him like this. Have no idea what I'm 'sposed to be doing."
Hermione looked suspicious.
Harry was all teeth and rosy cheeks. "I can't believe it."
Perhaps.
Harry squeezed Draco's hand comfortingly beneath his robe. "It's fine, Draco," he chirped, the sunlight glinting off the wireframes of his glasses. "You'll be up and on your broom again before long, and we'll face off against each other again next season."
Draco's lips twitched, but the ferocious sneer remained, his eyebrows furrowed deeply. He looked like a rabid dog. "I'm not leaving. I'm not moving a fucking muscle. I'm staying here, with Potter, and
"I'm fine, Potter," Draco instinctively jerked his arm out of Harry's grasp, leaving his flesh tingling where the boy's hand had rested. "Leave me be!"
"Good afternoon, Madame Pomfrey," Professor Dumbledore smiled kindly at the round little witch as he walked into the infirmary, hands folded behind his back, his half-moon spectacles nearly tipping off of his long, narrow nose. "How's our young patient doing?"
The chair Professor Snape had instructed Draco to take extremely uncomfortable, and he shifted uneasily, breathing shakily through his parted lips. Snape sat at his desk facing his student, hands folded in front of him, his oily face filled with self-satisfaction. Draco felt sick with dread. He had a nagging feeling that he knew what he'd been called here for.
Ron shook his head, "Look, you don't need to talk about that, mate. Not if you don't want to."
Draco swallowed hard, but when he did, he choked. He coughed so hard he felt his lungs might explode. Harry rubbed his back soothingly.
a mutual sentiment."
"Wait. What?" Draco looked at Harry in confusion.
Harry chuckled softly and shrugged his shoulders beneath his robes. "Honestly, I have no idea," his cheeks reddened visibly. "You've been distracting me."
Hermione shook her head, curls flouncing, but she couldn't hide her amused smile. "No, Harry. The rules are quite clear. It says he has to sleep separately, Harry."
. "Just don't do it again," Harry chuckled nervously. He frowned and extracted himself from Draco's arms. "What happened anyway?"
Draco smirked and turned to catch a glimpse of Ron's hopeful expression. "Sorry to disappoint, Weasley, but I won't be playing. I know you'd love to see me get clobbered, but I can scarcely get on my broom, much less fly it," he then added gloomily, "without smacking into a tree."
"He might, but it also might make him feel better. He thinks you're replacing him, Harry. If you tell him the truth, he'll know it's . . . different. You understand?"
Ron groaned.
"So," he began thickly, "it
Harry glanced over his shoulder for the millionth time at the Slytherin table.  Draco had his head down on the table,  and Harry felt a wave of compassion. Even if Malfoy was a slimy git like Ron seemed to think he was, Harry couldn't turn his back on him.  He would continue searching for answers,  but this time he wouldn't turn his back on his friends.  He could divide his attention,  couldn't he?
"Are you feeling alright, Draco? Maybe you should lie down through Potions. I'm sure Professor Snape will understand. He likes you after all." Pansy rubbed Draco's arm consolingly.
"Draco," he sobbed, "why? Why couldn't you hang on for just a little longer? We would've found a way. Dumbledore's brilliant! He would've thought of something. . . he would've. . ." Harry squeezed his eyes shut tight and cried. He climbed up onto the cot and sat for a moment, staring down at Draco's sickly face. His heart twisted and ached and felt as if it were exploding. It was a horrible feeling.
He would enjoy it. . . because as soon as he wakes up, his nightmare continues - just like it always does.
"You look bloody awful. Has old Voldy been swinging by the house lately?"
On Fridays, classes always felt particularly long and dull, but especially on this one. Potions class was quiet, besides the occasional whisper or giggle, which was immediately followed up by a sharp reprimand from Professor Snape. After giving the class that morning a curt greeting and a brief lecture on Pepperup potion, he set them to work on reading, giving direct orders to "stay focused" and not to "bother" him. Upon seeing Harry, he'd given him a strangely melancholy look that had left him feeling unsettled and a little uncomfortable.
When he looked at the ball, at first, he thought maybe the crystal was broken. But then he realized what it was. He saw nothing—only darkness. Every witch and wizard knew what that meant.
Draco's eyes momentarily strayed to Hermione, who was standing motionless by Ron's side, her hand resting reassuringly on his shoulder. She looked kinder than Draco remembered.
Ron bobbed suddenly into view on his rickety old broom, his pale, freckled cheeks a cherry-apple red. Hermione was sitting behind him, clinging onto him for dear life. She looked terrified.
Draco looked at Ron, who looked right back at him warily. Nervously, he extended his hand.
Draco carried on. "I mean, look at that. If I didn't have an appetite before, I most certainly do not have one now." he sneered in disgust.
!" Draco finally breathed, letting out a giant gasp of air. "Fuck, fuck, fuck. . ." He'd only just then realized that he had been holding his breath.
Dumbledore suddenly smiled, the corners of his periwinkle blue eyes crinkling. "That's up to you, Harry."
Draco briefly glanced up at him, mercury blue eyes flickering. "What do you want?"
"Master Draco?"
"Do it!" Harry laughed. "Please, you need to eat anyway. Madame Pomfrey would be very "displeased.'" He said pointedly, quoting Draco's words in his note that morning.
"That's bullshit, and you know it."
"Hm? Oh, nothing."
"Nothing, just a bit of Malfoy family drama. Nothing you'd be interested in,"
"You'd better shut it before I
Harry felt his smile widen gleefully, and he almost jumped out of his seat. Draco had walked into the room and immediately met his gaze. They shared a small smile, and then he began to hurriedly walk over to the empty Slytherin table before he could be seen. Harry watched him longingly.
"Alright then," he leaned forward. "And we're off!"
"What's going on, Ron?"
"It was just a joke," Draco whispered.
Harry grimaced. "Maybe. Sometimes."
Still no answer. Ron noticed a slight adjustment in Harry's expression. His lips curled downward, and his eyes narrowed, his face blanching as several tears fell down his cheeks. Ron grimaced and shifted uncomfortably, staring into the shadows wavering in the corners of the dimly lit room.
"Lost your appetite, Malfoy?" Someone whispered.
Draco had nearly made it. He'd almost slipped unnoticed into one of the back compartments when he was interposed by the sound of a Weasley's all-too-familiar voice.
Harry folded it into the shape of a miffler this time and watched it skitter across the dungeon floor. Draco held back a smile as he slowly scooped it up off of his leg and unfolded it beneath the table. Harry watched the Slytherin's mercury eyes crinkle as he read. He glanced briefly at Professor Snape, and he froze when he realized that the man was looking directly at Draco with a blank expression, though he obviously knew what was going on. Harry felt something fall into his lap again, and he gulped slightly. Snape's coal-like eyes fell on him, but he did nothing. Instead, much to Harry's surprise, he simply turned back to the scroll he was reading.
“Harry, you can call me Blaise. So, tell me a bit about what you need.”
The sensation of Draco's orgasm, the feeling of wet warmth that landed on his cock, along with the idea that he was responsible for that, that Draco had come because of him sent Harry over the edge he had been hovering for so long. Waves of pleasure raced in his body, he could feel his balls and his cock contracting, and his ears were buzzing, his sight gone black around the edges, in a never-ending moment of pure bliss. It could have been mere seconds or hours, Harry could not tell when he came to, slumping on Draco's front, both of them spent, sweaty and out of breath. At some point Draco had cast a cleaning charm between them, and Harry was grateful for the lack of stickiness.
But Draco could only let out a moan because at the same moment he felt Potter’s hand wrapping around his erection and starting to move. He leaned back for a moment, trying with all he had to keep from coming this soon, but he knew he would not last long. He passed his palm lightly over the bulge in Potter’s swimsuit before burying his hand inside and gripping Potter’s cock. He noticed with satisfaction that Potter’s hand faltered on his own, and moved experimentally upwards, circling the head with a firm grip. Potter was panting on his neck, and when Draco spread the precome gathered on Potter’s cock he stopped breathing altogether. Potter pulled back, batted Draco’s hand away, pushed his own swimsuit down, and circled both their cocks with his hand.
“No. Most of them are just pretentious old men who like making themselves seem wise and important. “
“Mhmm”, Draco nodded.
Draco leaned back startled. “Harry, what in Morgana’s name are you talking about?”
“Oh Merlin! This swimsuit… This should fucking be illegal!”
"I'm close, Draco, you're so good for me, this is so good... Come for me Draco, come for me"
Draco was going to throttle her. He made to turn towards her, but she was already up and heading to the water, hips swaying exaggeratedly. She was such a cow!
He looked down and he saw the head of his cock peeking out of Potter’s hand, pressing against Potter’s cock, he felt Potter’s other hand cupping his balls and rolling them in his palm, and this was his undoing. Suddenly the dam broke and he felt the tension which had gathered in his lower belly burst in his groin and then out. His knees gave in, and only Potter’s body was keeping him upright, his own body wracked by shivers all over, and then melting in Potter’s. Vaguely behind the rushing in his ears he heard Potter moan quietly, then grunt, and he felt wet warmth spreading on him. His cock gave another throb, and one last shudder of pleasure ran through him before his body gave out, exhausted and satisfied.
Draco looked at Apep and said, "Apep, go to the fireplace and lie down in the warmth for a moment."
Harry ventured to look back and was treated with a pair of pants that had just been buttoned up. Above those pants, that mouth-watering 'V' shape was still clearly visible, with six defined abdominal muscles above them. Those muscles looked just as hard as Hargrid's rock cakes, but probably tasted better.
Harry could no longer grumble, as Draco picked him up not much later. "Lie on my shoulders. You can also slit under my shirt if it's warmer, but you're probably way too big for that."
Draco got up and went to his first class today. He had a double class of Potions with Professor Slughorn. He longed for the days when his godfather taught the class. Draco appreciated the noble craft of potion making, but this feeling was nullified by the never ending chatter by Professor Slughorn.
Besides, Potter had suddenly become miraculously good at Potions. Draco couldn't have that. He couldn't stand all those years of hard work being wiped out by a green-eyed brat. No, Draco couldn't wait for the day he could prove that Potter was a cheater. Because there was no doubt about that. Potter had help, there was no other way.
"Good morning Apep, glad you didn't eat me."
“Mother says I should prepare to interact with the Dark Lord. That he would like to hear more about my progress.” Draco sniffed his nose inelegantly. He had an agitated expression on his face by now. His hands began to shake. “He terrifies me in Apep. I want to serve him and restore honor to my family. But I honestly admit it to you, I'm afraid of him.”
He undressed further and looked at Apep. The snake seemed to absorb every movement of its master. When Draco pulled his pants down, the snake suddenly turned one head away from him. The middle head seemed aware of its state of undress. The other heads eagerly looked his way.
Draco sat in the front, where he used to sit. He grabbed Apep and put him on the ground next to him. Apep behaved suspiciously calm. Draco took a good look at the snake, but couldn't find anything strange. There was probably nothing, Draco thought to himself.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Ahh," said Professor Slughorn unintelligently. "Willaby? Have you seen Mr. Potter?" He looked directly at Weasley.
, Harry thought with a blush on his cheeks.
Draco shook his head and settled on his pillow. Now he was really projecting his feelings. First Potter and now he was trying to force his own teenage hormones on his snake! It had been too long a day, Draco thought, closing his eyes and falling into a deep sleep.
Harry was still in his dark corner. He was talking to his other heads in his mind. He had reviewed the entire conversation. The feeling of betrayal was strongest. Harry could cry about his situation. His friends had been part of Dumbledore's plan to keep Harry under wraps for years. To control him. Now it turns out that his godfather died accidentally, not by a dark witch, but by a sixteen-year-old brat. The critical head was furious and his left head was making all kinds of plans to get revenge on the two Gryffindors.
Draco sat down with Apep on the armchair that was near the hearth. It was wonderfully warm there and Harry could feel the flames dancing on his cold skin. He hissed with happiness. Draco's touches along with the fireplace were divine. Elegant fingers glided gracefully over its black scales. His hard skin seemed to respond to Draco's touch, his scales seemed to rise slightly with each touch. As if Harry would also get goosebumps in this form. It didn't matter to Harry as long as Draco kept touching him.
"Come in, Miss Granger, Mr. Weasley." said Professor Dumbledore with a twinkle in his eye. "I had already expected you."
Ron took the hair out of a jar. He had three hairs between his fingers, but the jar was still open in his hand.
The blond boy looked at the snake in amusement. The snake was stubborn and almost arrogant. Somehow the snake reminded him of Potter: both were slim and agile, Apep's movements were as deliberate as Potter in a Quidditch match. The serpent's scales reminded him of Potter's black hair, the fact that these scales were sometimes upright contributed to this. The only big difference was that Apep didn't have green eyes. Apep had eyes like the Dark Lord, red, glowing like hot coals. Potter's emerald color was reflected in the shine of the bowls.
said Harry.
Hermione immediately reacted tense and said snarlingly, “Sirius was meant to fall onto Harry. Harry was completely unwise and would be disabled for a while. But in the end it was for the better: Harry blames Bellatrix for his death and his godfather can't slow us down anymore. He really was an unstable person.”
“No, his bed had not been slept in. But that does happen more often.” Ron said carelessly, his mouth still full of crumbs and saliva.
Draco was taken out of his musings by the entrance of Professor Slughorn. The professor went down the attendance list to check everyone off. Granger's hand jumped in the air by Potter's name.
The Headmaster turned away from the two students. Ron and Hermione hurried through the door, down the stairs.
Satisfied, he slid next to Draco. He enjoyed the praise he received from the blond master. Tonight he would go to Dumbledore as well and listen to the conversation. Because Harry agreed with his other two heads: he was no longer the gullible Gryffindor.
Harry started to laugh, that was pretty well said to a large snake.
“Do you see Severus? He's under control. I keep it with me during the day. You can milk his poison to brew an antiserum.”
"No, sir. But he'll show up again." said Ron Weasley carelessly.
I hope to post an update later today or tomorrow, then I will come with the promised part with Voldemort.
Draco walked over to his friends, Theo and Blaise. He explained to them that he had to go to professor Snape with Apep. He wanted official permission for Apep so he could have a strong case against the Huffelpuffs. His friends walked him to Professor Snape's chambers, then walked on to breakfast together. Before going, Blaise advised Draco to use the Feather Weight Charm on Apep so that he wouldn't become too heavy to carry. This turned out to work very well indeed, and Draco was secretly glad he didn't have to carry the six-foot snake constantly.
Harry looked up enthusiastically. He knew many secret passages that led from the castle to Hogsmeade. He was dying to show Draco the passageways right away, but one look at his master was enough to change his mind. Draco was exhausted. He was as well. So he did what any sweet, cuddly, yards-long snake would do. He gave Draco a gentle push with his head and slid off the boy. He slid toward the dorm, then looked back. He gestured with his heads that Draco should follow him.
"Well then, I will leave you to it!"
But it was important to Draco, and Harry was never able to say no to him, no matter how bored and frustrated he would end up being.
Draco scoffed dismissively. “Granger may be smart but she hardly has any wizarding propriety. She has always dressed promiscuously, even if she’s not as bad as most muggleborns. You on the other hand should behave better than that.”
“I am not ogling”, he insisted, “I simply happen to gaze at the sea. It’s what you do at a beach.”
With his too green eyes, and his dark stubble, and his complete lack of any sense of decency. Because there was no other way to describe the bathing suit Potter was wearing.
“You were, weren’t you?” Potter was blushing furiously and did not look directly at Draco and it turned out
Malfoy was a writhing mess underneath him, Harry could feel violent shivers going through his body, making him tremble in his embrace, and he himself was not that far away from being wrecked. He moved his body flush to Malfoy's, chests pressing against each other, and wrapped both of their erections in his hand, letting out a small hiss at the contact. The feel of Malfoy's cock touching his was maddening, Harry could almost feel it pulsing steadily and hotly against his own and his brain shut down completely, his mouth uttering words without his mind having any input.
And it was that which was a problem. Not only was he interesting and witty, but his hands kept travelling down Harry’s body taking more measurements than Harry remember anyone taking before, touching him more and more with each. So much so that if Harry didn’t know better he would say it was intentional. And despite being actually engaged in their conversation Harry could not for a moment ignore his cock, which was rock hard and straining in his pants. Malfoy had now reached his hips with his measuring tape and Harry’s cheeks felt like they were on fire, but he had given up trying to control his erection. Malfoy took one look of the bulge in Harry’s trousers and stepped a bit closer. He did not stop his description of the best little gelato shop near Piazza Santa Croce but he now had a small glint in his eyes and Harry was mortified.
“Come to the beach, Draco”, she said, “it’s just going to be us, you know, the usual group”. Well, the usual group they were definitely not!
Malfoy's pupils were blown so wide Harry could barely see a ring of grey around them, and his knuckles had turned white with how hard he was grabbing the arms of the chair. Eyes glued to the movement in front of him, he let out a small breathy moan and Harry snapped. He removed his hands from himself completely and buried them in Malfoy's hair, pulling him closer. Malfoy did not resist. Instead he opened his mouth obediently and pressed a wet kiss on the side of Harry's cock before licking a wide stripe from root to tip. Scorching heat surrounded the tip as soft lips engulfed the head, racing all around his body and this was everything. Harry had spent years fantasizing about this moment, ever since that single drunken kiss, and now it was here and Harry was losing his mind and he was so close and oh Merlin he never wanted this to end but he was not sure he could hold back any longer.
"But you know Ron," Harry responded, "he'll freak!"
"Answer me, " he whispered, his soft voice laced with venom. "Now. "
Draco smiled and closed his eyes, feeling the sun on his face.
"Hey, Harry!"
"Fine."
The house-elf, Wilky, was standing quietly in the corner, and it was staring at Draco with wide bulbous eyes. Draco felt his stomach churn, and he quelled the rising urge to be sick as the realization of what he was about to do began to hit him. Dumbledore's gaze shifted away from Lucius at last and descended on the two boys lurking in the shadows, his eyes softening. Lucius gradually turned to face them, his jaw set, his expression hard and cold like stone.
Ron stopped walking and glared over his shoulder at Harry.  "So says you. I think we've done enough talking for one night. "
Draco. . . with his pale,  pointed face and sickly,  sunken eyes?  Harry chewed harder.
Harry snorted at his face, and Ron gave his friend a quick glare. "Sorry,"
Ron untangled himself from Harry's tight grasp and shuffled eagerly back to his bed. Draco just stood there awkwardly, a pained expression on his face.
Ron choked, juice dripping down his chin. He sprang out of his seat and ran through the Hall. Hermione laughed to herself and shook her head.
He started scaling the steps when a sudden jolt of pain in his head made him freeze abruptly, a gasp escaping his pale lips. He grabbed the wet stone railing for support, his fingers turning white as he ground his teeth through the pain.
Harry was beginning to feel indignant, his ears a burning shade of red. "What's gotten you all up in a twist?"
"Stop worrying, Hermione! It's not even mid-year exams yet.  I'll be fine. I need to get to the bottom of-"
"What?"
Harry was late for divination. Again. He could feel every eye in the room training on him, but he ignored it and resumed his usual seat beside Ron by the window. He closed his eyes and sighed softly, enjoying the sultry breeze just barely filtering in through the open window.
"I dare you to taste it," Harry grinned devilishly.
Draco swallowed hard and took a deep breath. "N-no. Um, never mind. . . I think I'm going to be sick."
Ron was squinting into the crystal, his nose scrunched up as he waited impatiently.
"Draco? "
Ron frowned at his crystal ball, pouting. "Mine's chipped," he groaned.
Harry seemed anxious. "Look, Ron's my best mate. He always has been. It's just that I don't think he'll be very accepting of," he gestured meaningfully between himself and Draco. "us."
Laughing happily, the two boys ran through the castle, Harry intertwining their fingers.
"You know what," Draco shakily reached for his letter, folded it, slipped it into an envelope, and sealed it shut, "screw it. I'm sending it! I can't just second guess my spells. They're excellent! Not even stupid Granger could break them."
There was a stupefied silence until Draco turned to face Harry, who was staring at the twins with a flushed and bewildered expression.
"It will be over. Just give it a bit more time. In the meantime, live in the moment.
Draco stuffed his cauldron into his leather bag and ran his hands through his matted hair. "Oh, well, I'm fine, I guess. Never better."
"Ron," Hermione jostled his shoulder. "Quidditch?"
"C'mon!" Harry huffed. "Look, I don't know why, but I really feel like something's up, and I really want to find out what it is. I can't stop thinking about it."
"I'm not joking." Draco rebutted, laughing as he turned to walk down the corridor, his mud-covered robes swirling gracefully behind him.
Draco swallowed visibly. "What?"
"Why are you so obsessed with Malfoy anyway?"
"Wow," Harry swallowed hard, speaking barely above a whisper. "Well, um, I'll just shut up now."
She followed his wandering gaze to Malfoy, who seemed to be struggling for breath as students walked heedlessly past him.
"Oh, yeah. It was the family owl. But why is he sleepin' on the floor? Uh, not that I'm complainin'."
Hermione's shoulders fell, and she released his arm and said sourly,  "Oh, I don't know, Harry. Maybe he actually has a life of his own.  Does that ever cross your mind?  Stop wasting yours by sticking your nose in his. "
Harry, alarmed, followed Draco's gaze unblinkingly. "Fuck," he hissed, squeezing Draco's hand tightly as he pulled the Slytherin protectively into his side.
Narcissa glanced timidly over at her spouse, his lank figure silhouetted against the orange glow emanating from the fireplace. Tears stung her eyes, and her heart swelled with sympathy for her young son. Draco was still so naive. He was still a boy, yet his father had always retained such high expectations for him, assuming that he might become everything he anticipated him to be. Unfortunately for him, Draco was nothing like his father, although he loved him dearly and aspired to be like him. It just wasn't possible. Draco had always been different from him, although he would never admit it. He was born with a conscience and a respect for life, although his tongue had been sharpened over the years. His young mind had been polluted with terrible notions and opinionated ideas, believing the lie that purebloods were better than other half-blood wizarding families. In reality, they were all the same, united by magic.
Harry balanced them out at a slow, steady pace several feet beneath the cloud-line, but it was close enough that Draco thought he could almost reach up and touch them.
"What you see today is not absolute, and can change very quickly, which is why I am gifting each of you with your own crystals. You will return them to me at the end of the semester. Depending on your choices in the upcoming months, you could very well change your fate, so think wisely before you act."
Draco looked up at his mother and lied solemnly to her face, "I'm fine, mother. Just fine." The lie was bitter on his tongue.
Ron snorted back. "I wish they could."
Draco smirked back at him as he walked over. He braced himself. "Alright, here goes nothing,'" he slowly began to lower himself onto the bed.
For a moment,  Ron just stared back at him warily,  his tongue in his cheek as he mulled it over.  He couldn't say no.  They'd been best friends since the first year,  and neither of them was willing to lose each other.
When they saw Draco, they began to whisper and mutter suspiciously to each other. He heard a few things that made his skin crawl, and he scoffed loudly, sneering. Whether Harry heard them or not, he didn't know because the Gryffindor kept walking, pulling Draco closely behind him.
The dorms were smaller than the ones in Slytherin, but they were comfortable. Draco snooped around curiously, tracing the markings in the furniture and studying the photographs, posters, and Quidditch flyers cluttering the walls while Harry tidied his corner up a bit.
"Yeah,  just fine. "
Draco looked up at the Death Eater silently and then stared down at his folded hands, watching his fingers as they trembled.
Harry held his breath.
"Oh, water, water! Yes, water." Harry stammered instantly. He pulled out his wand and aimed it towards the pitcher sitting on the bedside table. "Accio!"
There would be prejudice, there would be pain, and there would be others constantly battling them at every corner, trying to tear them apart. Harry was tired of fighting, but he didn't care. What was one more battle if it meant he could spend the rest of his life with the person he loved? What was one more fight?
Harry felt a sharp pang in his chest, and tears pricked his eyes. He folded his arms on the table and buried his face in them.
The overhanging lights glinted off of the metal frames of Harry's glasses and caught in his emerald eyes, while his lips curled up into a repugnant sneer that any Malfoy would have been proud of. Draco could feel himself vibrating, his breath catching in his lungs, his expressions now quite out of his control, now fraught with emotion.
Harry tugged at Draco's sleeve excitedly. "Well, c'mon then! Hurry!"
"Ron. . ." Hermione scolded him like she always did.
"Good God," he choked, "my son. . ."
When his eyes fluttered open, his heart leaped in his chest. Draco's forehead was pressed coolly against his, the boy's beautiful eyes locked intently on Harry's face.
Dumbledore knew. Of course, he did. He always seemed to know everything in the end. Always.
"So, what am I supposed to do about it,  Professor? I don't want to die! The Dark Lord will kill me if he hears.  I-"
Draco nodded, "Alright. Ok."
He gulped in air, drawing in long, shaky breaths.
"And you," he chuckled quietly, looking Harry over with malicious eyes. "you will pay alongside him."
"Very good then, " and Snape, his black robes flowing dramatically behind him, led Draco out of the Great Hall.
This baffled Ron. Obviously, Malfoy needed help, but the Slytherin was determined to keep his troubling affliction to himself. The Pureblood was just as pompous and proud as he had always been.
From afar,  Professor Snape looked on.  Although Potter couldn't see it himself,  Snape now knew.
"Oh, yes,"
"Yes, Professor."
"What in the-"
Harry gulped as he glanced restlessly down the aisle, suspecting to see Percy Weasley or a Professor stamping towards them. But there was no one. He felt resentment, guilt, and uncertainty like a stone in his gut. He should've stayed Ron's hand, but he hadn't.
"Oi, Harry, c'mere. C'mon then. Come to me. I'm here, alright?"
With that, he set the open jar back down on the cluttered counter-space and walked back to his desk to answer Harry's perplexed questions.
"You don't, " Snape answered softly,  staring at the wall with hazy eyes as if he were lost in a distant memory.
Harry nodded and listened to the sound of her retreating footsteps before immediately kneeling beside the cot. He retook Draco's cold hand and pressed it to his lips.
Mr. Malfoy was standing at the end of the gallery, his tall, daunting frame towering over the students teeming past him into their classroom, barring the doorway into Transfiguration.
"I'm still a little weak. Have a bit of trouble getting up, y'know? Sometimes, my head gets a bit fuzzy, but it's nothing too serious. Other times . . . I get all cold inside, and I feel sick, but it passes after a while. And, as for my arm. . ."
George hesitated. "Never mind. Nothing." He stood and threw his wrinkled leather book-bag over his shoulder before turning to leave the room. "See ya later, lover-boy."
Draco reasoned. He ignored himself, his eyes closing, the voices in his head going quiet. . . He just needed some rest. It didn't matter where.
"I just. . . I just can't get him out of my head. I can't think about anything else. "
But then again, he looked more like a ghost.
"Bloody hell," he breathed huskily, as he gained his balance, his vision swaying.
The Gryffindor common room was still empty.  Dinner hadn't been over when they had left.  Everyone was still eating,  so naturally, the two boys could talk freely. Ron expected an honest answer.
Harry buried his face in Draco's white pajamas and took a shaky breath in. They smelled like him.
In a very small, strained voice, he said quietly, "I lose him. I lose Malfoy."
Ron pretended to gag, but he was smiling. "It happened that long ago?"
"Fuck you! "
Ron met his gaze, and the Slytherin tried to look away from him, but he was determined. Pushing back his chair, Ron made his way to the cupboards in the back of the classroom and began rifling through the ingredients, signaling for Malfoy to join him.
Draco nodded, his body tensing.
"I thought you wanted me to forget about him. "
The unicorn fluttered and shook his paper head.
Hermione giggled. "Yes, I don't even know what that is, honestly."
Draco stared wide-eyed at his plate before glancing as casually as he could over his shoulder only to greet the cold stone-wall. He heard scuffling foot-steps, and when he looked down, he swore he caught a glimpse of the shiny toe of Hermione's boot, but he shook it off.
"Well, okay then."
The pale morning light shone through the window, softly illuminating the shadowy interior of the stuffy little room he shared with the Weasleys. He slowly raised his hands and forced himself upright, rubbing his eyes before glancing around the room.
"I'm. . . worried, I guess." He stammered, scrunching up his face in frustration. "I can't really explain it. It's just, I've never seen you like this before. No one has. And that day, when I saw you on the train . . ."
Draco Malfoy gazed down at his ridiculous love letter with impassioned, tear-filled eyes, his fingers still tightly folded around his quill. His Eagle Owl was perched on the ornate desk beside him; head cocked as it waited quietly for Draco to make up his mind once and for all.
"Thank you, Granger," Draco said sincerely.
Harry nodded and reluctantly took a bite of his mashed potatoes. "That's what Dumbledore said."
Hermione smiled. "He almost wasn't,"
"No," she stammered, "I don't hate you."
"He's gorgeous," he helplessly murmured in awe.
Ron collapsed into one of the armchairs by the fire and pretended to take an interest in a book lying on the side table next to it. "It's just a question, " he replied innocently.
"True love lasts forever, " Professor Snape continued,  "it's a disease that feeds off of you until there is nothing left."
"No," Draco finally murmured, looking back up into the witch's face, "nothing."
"What is it, dear?"
Harry swallowed hard and raked his fingers through his disheveled raven black hair. "Yes, Malfoy and I are. . ," he stammered, struggling to find the right words. "A thing? Dating? Uh, I don't quite know. I'm not sure."
Draco shrugged. "It's
Draco's face looked ghostly white against his pillow, and the outline of his frame beneath the sheets seemed so thin Harry wondered whether he actually had any limbs left at all.
"What do you mean?" Suddenly, Ron felt a surge of anger, and he sat up, giving Harry a fiery glare. "Does he leave you? 'Cause I swear to god, if he tries, I'll smash the prick's snobby little face in. He doesn't deserve you, mate. At least, he doesn't if he hurts you again."
Harry freed his hand and stretched his cramped fingers, turning to Draco with a concerned expression.
saved. It would have been better for everyone if he had died right then at the doors of Hogwarts.
"You're not well, you git!" Harry shot back, his dark eyebrows furrowed fiercely, although his eyes were filled with unexplained solicitude.
"Alright," Ron glanced sheepishly at Malfoy's wounded arm again before backing out of the doorway and disappearing, his retreating footsteps tapping noisily against the winding stone staircase.
What just happened? Something felt. . .  different.
"Never!" They responded in unison.
"I am right," Hermione chirped.
"Together at last."
"Go on,"
Harry swallowed hard and tried to quell his fear. He couldn't quite shake the feeling that perhaps losing half of your soul was worse than losing all of it. "Professor . . . Will he wake up?"
"Are you okay?" he asked immediately, "Are you alright?"
Ron had turned such a deep shade of red, Draco thought someone might have cast a
As the carriage jerked suddenly into motion and began to roll down the path towards the castle, the young wizards hushed, no one daring to utter even a single word. Not even Harry seemed to feel up to the challenge as he sat stiffly beside Cho, his expression taut with discomfort.
Harry rolled his eyes, and Draco smiled. "You're cute when you do that," The Slytherin said brazenly.
Why did he care?
enly dry.
. . .
"I think Dumbledore knows me well enough to know we won't be paying much attention to the rules, Granger." Draco interrupted Harry, wearing a haughty smirk, and Ron watched uncomfortably as Draco slid his hand down the small of Harry's back.
Draco wiped his eyes on his sleeve and nodded vigorously, beaming back at Harry. "He said he didn't think it was safe. Says I miffed 'em off when I started loitering about with you and your little friends."
Harry chewed at his fingernails, suddenly feeling that knot in his stomach again, a hundred questions suddenly drilling holes into his brain.
Draco. Harry raised his eyes to scrutinize Draco's wan, pale face again, but when he turned to look, the boy was gone.
"Then what did you stay back for?"
"Only kidding," Draco assured him, "Only kidding."
"Cut it out, Ron,"
Draco turned to face him. "Yeah?"
Harry smirked. Now was his opportunity. "By the way," he said nonchalantly, "You wouldn't by any chance happen to have my robes with you, would you?"
"Ron, listen,  I'm sorry, okay?! " Harry hissed, "I'm sorry.  Really. "
Harry suddenly felt a wave of guilt. It was true. Not only had he been neglecting his schoolwork, but he'd also been neglecting his friends.  His best friends.
Severus finished grading the paper in front of him. He folded his hands on the desk, finally looking up at Draco. "I wish to discuss your involvement with Harry Potter," he started.
"Very well, thank you for your understanding," Firenze nodded.
Draco motioned to Blaise, who moved closer, causing Bulstrode to step farther back. They were close enough to whisper in private despite the crowd.
They kept close to the wall. They walked around the room, looking for a way out. The whispers caressing their skin.
"Don't play dumb, it's just us. You can't leech any power of off my name without an audience," snarled Draco, moving into her space.
"Merlin, Weasley, what the fuck?" he yelled. His head hit the wall as he was pushed by a fist around his collar.
"First name biases now?"
Greyback's eyebrows tightened in thought, smoke filing to the air. "My pack and I are heading out soon, I think I'll be back for summer."
"Pansy," Draco greeted as she took her seat next to him, his voice shook, he swallowed.
Daphne waved her off, "I've been here."
Severus nearly gasped in shock, his eyes widening.
The sounds of Theo's night terrors nailed into his ears. Crabbe and Goyle passed on tense smiles with too friendly voices. Pansy wouldn't look at him.
"What are you saying?"
So, Draco had to have a backup suggestion, a defense for his failure.
“Listen to me, you need to dry your face and go to dinner, okay? Can you do that for me? I can help her, I can, but you need to cover for me, okay?” Draco took Zabini’s face in his hands. Brown eyes met grey, panic met calm.
Draco's breath stopped in his throat. Draco tried to ignore the pounding in his chest. He tried to ignore the heat that spiked in his face and the twist in his stomach when Potter didn't try to slip a smile his way. Seeing Potter again after almost two weeks was like scratching an itch that only got worst. Draco had to talk to him, had to see him, had to have Potter around him.
"Thank you." Did he pass? What did he just agree to?
Draco looked around, the hour was late, but there could still be listening ears. Draco cast a silencing charm on them, to ensure their conversation stayed as confidential as they needed.
Potter grinned, but the smile didn't reach his eyes. They sat on the couch, Draco started to care for Potter's hand, and his bruised face, and his shoulder 'because it's a little sore, if you can look at that'.
"H…Hey," Draco whispered back, Potter was so close. His wand gently lit the little space between them.
The globe was smooth in his hand, heavier than he expected. His legs unsteady as he shoved himself up onto his feet.
Draco turned his thoughts away from the unthinkable, shutting them down and slipping into a distant place where he was untouchable, even to his own memories.
Draco didn't have a choice, Daphne was smart, she could probably outwit Draco if they were on equal footing, but he still had the advantage his status brought him. He would use whatever he could if she wavered in loyalty.
They were vulnerable now. Shocked in the sight of their own son spilling blood of his friend.
“You two go on ahead,” Draco's neck heated. “We can’t be seen together.”
Umbridge continued to batter Potter. Who wasn't going to tell her anything. She was wasting her time. Potter was strong. "Perhaps an Unforgivable will loosen your tongue," Umbridge hissed.
"I am, but I knew Daphne from when I used to teach. I wanted to pay my respects."
Draco stopped, he had pushed Montague too far. He was cornered, so he struck out with what he had. Draco turned, Montague was only clawing for information, throwing punches until he hit a nerve, but he was getting too close for comfort. Montague wouldn't stop. Draco had to win, right here right now. Win this fight so he wouldn't have to fight again.
His Lord sighed, "The Greengrass girl was responsible for her own actions. I'm to assume that if you had any notations of betrayal you would have found some way to alert me?"
Potter tried to meet Draco where he was as he brought his hands to Draco’s shoulders. Potter was slow in his motions, treating Draco like a growling dog, and who could blame him?
"Absolutely," he concluded, ready to leave.
"Move," she demanded, as if talking to a child.
The next bang was louder.
Draco wondered how Potter had realized he had forgotten the book, he hadn't noticed until now. Did Potter return later that night? Why did he even bother returning the book to Draco?
Potter bit his lip, looked down at his feet. "Um, sure. What's all this for?" he asked, motioning to the objects on the table.
That was a terrifying idea.
Draco slumped. He was so stupid. Draco had to smother this crush he had.
Draco now had a course of action, thankfully. He would have to tell Potter some version of the truth, but not enough to have the boy pity him. Potter would have to see him as an equal, not as someone to save. Merlin knows Potter didn't need someone else to be a savor to, Potter needed an equal. Draco could be his equal. Class ended, Draco was the first out of the door, acting as normal as possible, as if he was not thinking of making nice with the Dark Lord’s most dangerous enemy.
“How many lines?” he asked, ignoring the gab.
"Very well, you may begin," Firenze instructed. Draco had no idea what he was supposed to do. He just stared at the centaur, wishing for death. Professor Firenze raised his eyebrows. Draco slowly shrugged, the class trying to hush their laughter. "Oh, I see," Firenze realized, "The ash will not be hot, you have nothing to worry about."
"Shh…shh…" he whispered into her hair.
"How are you spending the break, Zabini?" Daphne provided, putting out her smoke on the bench seat.
"Potter," Draco pestered. Who sighed in response.
His back arched as his spine was blistering under the molten heat that poured into his skin.
Draco's eyes snapped to the door as there was a slide of wood on wood. Blaise walked in, a grinning Theo following closely.
"I don't know what to do," Draco sobbed. His cries shook his body, his gasps harsh and deep in both despair and surprise at his own tears.
"I said," the ghost's voice was so high pitch for someone who didn't have vocal cords. "What are you-"
"If I asked for questions, Potter, they are allowed. Surely you can piece that together, or perhaps Quidditch as caused you permanent damage," Severus dismissed.
"I'm sorry. You shouldn't have to worry about me-"
His surprise was distracted by a loud thud and the sounds of a girl screeching followed by crashing. He turned to see Pansy running at Bulstrode with a spiteful vengeance, even managing to topple the much larger girl in her rage. Pansy was a fury of fist, slaps and scratches as Bulstrode was forced to the floor. Draco could hear the sound of Pansy's fist from across the room where he stood.
The Greengrass's greeted their guest in the foyer. The guest slowed in line to be greeted by the parents of the dead. To give their useless condolences to people who were experiencing the most painful sort of grief. Daphne's parent's wore all back. Her mother's hair was perfectly immaculate in the twisted bun at the base of her neck. She looked so much like the daughter. With a cigarette in her hand and in pale blue robes, Draco could have pretended that Daphne lived to adulthood. What would she have been like as a woman and not just a girl? Would the upcoming war have twisted her into someone cruel? Would she have learned to fight with more than just her words? Would she have torn her soul apart to win, to see the end, to live?
Severus scoffed, rising from where he was leaning down to look at Draco. "Why?" he mocked, starting to pace the small room. "Why would you want to hurt Ms. Parkinson? It's not a question of why-" he started to yell.
Draco slipped his hand under his pillow, he pulled out his side of the two-way mirror he had given Potter last year. Potter's green eyes met his, illuminated by the quite white light of his wand. "Are you ready?"
"The haunted mansion?" he asked.
His wand returned to normal, Montague gasped of the floor. Draco laid his arm across his eyes, knowing that Montague would leave after Draco's cruelty.
"I should probably get new ones, you're probably a five in my book with my current prescription."
"Pleasure of you to join us, Malfoy," Professor McGonagall scorned him as he entered the class. He promptly handed her the note Severus supplied him before she further scorned him.
"Or the blood on my hands, neither one of those are good signs," Draco shrugged. They stepped out onto the balcony. Both instantly shivering against the high cold of the night. Potter wrapped them both in his cloak, standing close. Eventually, Draco suggested they sit. They leaned against the wall of the tower next to the large entryway. Potter rested his head on Draco shoulder. His hair tickling Draco's neck. A hand found Draco's. Potter was holding his hand. Draco's stomach would flip if he wasn't so sleepy.
"Yes sir?" Draco continued to mock.
When the Dark Lord killed an innocent muggle family in front of Draco. A mother and a father, before moving on to their two children, ending in him killing an infant.
How terribly inconvenient.
"What do you mean 'yeah'?" Pansy snapped.
"Of course," the answer escape his mouth before he could think. "Same time, same place?"
"Malfoy, we are taking this matter very seriously. We cannot have students attacking each other in the halls."
Draco thought back to him pelting Finnigan with his own fist. "I have," he defended.
"She's not your responsibility, you know," Daphne hadn't even looked up to know where Draco's gaze was held.
Draco mocked gasped, "I will have you know, Potter, that I am very humble. In fact, I would say that I am the most humble person I know."
He turned before he could enjoy the expression on Severus's face. Draco opened the door, only for a hand to harshly slam it shut. Severus was leaning into his space.
Daphne met his eyes. She was scared, they both were, but she was diving head first into icy depths with only Draco's word that she wouldn't drown.
"It's not like we would be able to talk to each other," Draco tried to make Potter feel better.
Draco continued to pet Bentley. Mafalda drew her knees to her chest, resting her chin on her knees. "Why did you ask if you already knew what happened?" Draco inquired. When Mafalda didn't answer, Draco spoke in a gentle voice, "What do you want to know?"
"I'm just trying to help you, Draco. You are in over your head, and you're too naïve to see that," Severus reasoned.
"Well, you are marrying into the right family then."
Blaise stood there, a nervous smile on his lips. "Can I talk to you, Theo?" he asked, leaning in for privacy, shuffling his feet. He probably wanted to ask why Theo never talked to him outside of classes, or never sat next to him for dinner, or why he didn't ask him to study together last night.
"Oi!" Draco cut off, silencing the jest. The two girls collapsed in laughter, clutching their stomachs and whipping tears from their eyes.
"Better than expected," Mr. Weasley eventually answered in a low voice. He was getting a glance of what Draco was.
With a forced smile Draco noted, "Merlin, Potter, you're only observant when it's an inconvenience."
"Very well, we'll announce the happy arrangement when we get back," his Lord clarified. Just like that? Draco makes one suggestion and suddenly the Dark Lord would follow through? Why? Was Draco already so easily allowed into the Lord's favor? Why talk to him in private? Why give Draco the first thing he asks for?
Alone. He needed to be alone.
The panic on Theo's face was terribly hilarious. He made motions with a variety of groans, shoveling toast into his mouth. He stood, hitting Draco in his shoulder, it was time for them to go.
Draco woke up with his hands around Blaise's neck. Strong arms were pulling at his torso, Nott was prying at his hands. Draco relaxed his body as he let go of Blaise and then allowed himself to be pulled away from the boy. His legs weren’t working. Draco felt cold sweat against his skin, his heart was beating in his ears, his limbs were heavy.
She cried softly as she registered what was happening to her. Small gasps filling her lungs with air as she took her last breaths. He held her up so that she wouldn't hit the floor, her blood dampening her hair. "Why…" she asked. "Why would you do this?" Her voice was so quiet.
"The Greengrass family, what is going to happen to them?" Draco asked what was truly bothering him. He had to see what would happen when he told the truth.
"Oh, please allow me," Draco insisted, rising from his seat instead of using magic. He carried the tray, pink, over to the desk before placing the tray on the desk. "Now, would you prefer six sugars or ten?" he doted, his teeth hurting.
The two continued their comfortable rare routine.
Potter didn't say anything right away, Draco's stomach plummeted. "I'll see you tonight, Potter. Be ready to work," Draco distracted in a shaky voice. Potter nodded, but didn't move his hand from Draco's shoulder. They stood there, just in front of the stairs, where anyone could see them. Draco stared at Potter, who seemed as if he was debating something. "Potter," he tried, "we should leave-"
With his chin high and his shoulders strong he moved in between the two girls. Pansy was malleable to the movement, allowing Draco the space. He stood in front of Bulstrode, looking up at her but not letting her size overpower his authority.
Mr. Weasley raised his eyebrows at Mrs. Malfoy's attempt at small talk. She wasn't one for unnecessary niceties. "We aren’t, but the kids knew Daphne. They wanted to pay their respects," Mr. Weasley explained politely.
She turned to Draco, "Now you can cry in front of me and I won't be able to tell anyone," she observed with another drag. A dry laugh escaped from Draco's chest.
The train sputtered to a gentle stop, the castle welcoming them. Their home in these troubled times. Draco watched as his companions filed out of the cart, carrying their luggage. Pansy reached out to him with her hand. Draco made an excuse, telling her he would meet them for dinner.
Draco slammed the door shut, his spell already stunning Crabb into unconsciousness when he turned around.
The silence continued. Draco's skin prickled uncomfortably at Severus's presence. Draco busied himself by walking to the tray on the desk. He warmed the tea, making Severus a cup. When Draco handed Severus his tea, he was shaking.
“You can guess,” Potter smiled.
His eyes opened then, he needed to remember this moment. Keep this night sealed in his heart. Potter had his eyes closed, he was leaning into Draco, one hand on Draco's cheek, the other on his back.
Should Draco warn her? What were the dangers he was warning her of? Pansy had only recently started eating again, teasing him again. There was such a fragile sense to her strength, if he dropped her, he was afraid she would shatter.
He had spilt blood. He had taken the life of one of his only friends while her parents watched. He had begun to actively plot in a war far too large for him to take up a banner. He was so young. He was still so naïve. What was his comfort worth to them? They would push him away no matter what he did. The truly merciful act would be to ensure Daphne's blood had not spilt for nothing. In order for her sacrifice to be worth of any use, he would have to become what everyone thought he was.
