“Oh?” Draco laughed. “
, and Draco knew Potter had been raised by wolves, but was that any way to speak to a defenceless animal who’d only lashed out instinctively when attacked by a creature five times its size? He was
, he wasn’t ready to give this up yet.
Draco’s kiss was bruising, and his hands, braced firmly at the base of Harry’s skull to hold him in place, felt like they might crush him if he struggled. Quite forgetting himself, Harry dropped the knife and melted into the kiss, pliant and languid, and his fingers skittered up and down Draco’s sides out of habit. He had the number of Draco’s ribs memorised by now.
Breathing heavily, he scanned the tower above—and saw Potter, leaned through one of the windows but too large to fit fully inside. He couldn’t make out details from this distance with his shitty human vision, but he was pretty sure the lovely red line now scarring Potter’s left cheek was his own handiwork.
Snape had nearly stabbed his quill through the parchment, so quickly had he scrawled his signature on the application—and then sent it sailing off to McGonagall for final approval as the Head of the Transfiguration Department. “I’m expecting smart decisions from you this year, Mr Malfoy. You’ve always been a clever student. Do
Draco took a breath, granting himself one final chance to come to his senses, then shifted from slick, straight trousers and a wool jumper over a button-down into a fluffy coat of pristine white feathers that nicely matched the cold marble balcony. He hopped up onto the banister, sighting the little Scops still making a wobbling attempt to gain altitude, then spread his wings and took off after it.
"Hey Hermione." He winced
Malfoy captures his lips briefly before pulling back, an obscene thread of cum stretching between their lips. It was disgusting, but so very very arousing. Harry couldn’t contain a throaty groan, his own prick fully erect and aching.
But he was halted mid-thought by a dark shape wilting on the floor against the corridor wall, legs pulled up protectively towards his chest, head lodged between his knees. The naked admission of pain reminded him so much of himself that he almost speculated that he was still sleeping, but this figure was still inside, the air hot and stuffy within the hallway and Draco choked on such air. This figure was quivering and soft sounds of desperate grief escaped him and Draco had never lacked such restraint, even while bleeding out self-pity alone. Treading cautiously closer, his grey eyes widened in broad surprise.
All through the rest of the day, Harry couldn't keep a certain blond haired Slytherin out of his mind but he carried on anyway, anxiously avoiding Ron and Hermione's vocal speculation about Malfoy's bruised neck. But inside, he felt darkly pleased and undeniably aroused at the sight of the marks that he had left to mar that smooth expanse of skin.
“Please” he begged again and felt Malfoy smirk devilishly against his skin.
He couldn’t keep from thrashing violently as Draco moved his hips down and words were lost to a continuous slur of moans.
"No problem... is there, er anything you want to talk about?"
glad that she hadn’t said anything.
He could taste the salty precome leaking from Malfoy’s cock and could feel that the other boy was getting closer to the edge, Harry was getting so turned on by the experience that he felt he might cum soon himself.
“It’s okay mate, you’re having a bad day I can tell.”
“What’s the first ingredient?” He whispered, breath ghosting over Malfoy’s ear. Malfoy shivered and slowly opening his eyes.
He heard Draco gasp and groan as he retracted, swirling his tongue around the end of his member before sliding back down again.
“Malfoy.” Harry breathed when the other boy’s face was mere inches from his own. With one movement they would be touching, with one movement they could be kissing. Harry was all of a sudden very aware of the heat thrumming through his cock once again. All of a sudden, a bed appeared in the room behind them. Harry wasn’t sure who had wanted it- probably both of them.
All the boys made their way down to breakfast together, and if any of the others paid notice to the bags progressively frequenting Harry’s eyes, none mentioned it, which is more than could be said for Ron; discreetly smirking into Harry’s ear about the furtively quixotic glances Seamus and Dean habitually shot each other, and Harry privately smiled to himself, wondering if either had noticed it themselves.
Draco sighed down at his work. Potions had always been his favourite subject but recently he had been finding it increasingly difficult to concentrate; his rehearsed looping inscription, bold and perfect, waning into smudges of grey fingerprints, and there were only so many free passes he could get for his past merit, only so many sub-standard concoctions that could be attributed to “family issues”- most other students had suffered losses greater than his anyhow, but he was dubious that a single other would agree that everything had made more sense during the war.
“No one is irredeemable, Malfoy.”
would be bad.
“Anything else?” Harry asked in a low voice.
“We need to talk.” Hermione said bossily strutting into the room and shutting the door behind her.
Sighing, Draco stood back up
"I think it's time for some payback" Draco whispered in his ear, his heated breathe sending shivers through Harry's entire body. And then Draco's lips were on his neck, rough and wet and bruising, making Harry arch his back in undeniable want. He moaned as Malfoy's teeth scraped against his skin and then whined as he was suddenly pulling away. Draco looked him over, smirking at what a mess he had turned the chosen one into before ripping open Harry's shirt. Harry gasped as sharp nails were suddenly cutting into his chest and Draco was kissing him roughly, biting his lips and chasing them with a hungry tongue. His chest burned, but it was an arousing kind of agony. Harry felt his body going weak but the ropes held him up as Draco released him and slowly sank to his knees, eyes never leaving Harry's shocked, wanting gaze. The sight of Malfoy kneeling before him was enough to send desire pulsing through him and he felt he could barely stand.
Harry felt startled, wondering just how they had found themselves in this situation, but on the surface he was a mask of cool composure and, curiously, he blew gently on Malfoy's neck, feeling him shiver against him. He slowly lowered his head and gently bit the skin of Malfoy's neck and heard a sharp intake of breathe at the contact. He raised his head and looked into Malfoy's half-closed eyes, his pupils dilated, making Harry's whole body burn with desire.
Unfortunately, Hermione chose that exact moment to walk in.
"What the hell was that?!" Harry yelled, his face turning redder than the communist manifesto.
Pausing for a moment, Harry considered her question. Well, maybe he had lost his mind, but when he was with Malfoy, it felt like anything but insanity. It felt like the opposite- everything was clear, and he knew exactly what he wanted. Which was to fuck Malfoy. He smirked a little at the thought before meeting Hermione’s eyes.
"Thanks again Hermione!"
problem.”
“Having a little trouble there?” A cool voice drawled. Harry spun around to see Malfoy standing there, the cupboard door closed behind him. Harry raised an eyebrow.
“It’s pretty obvious that something’s wrong, are you going to tell me or not?” he said, feeling pent up emotion seeping into his voice in the form of mild annoyance, and Harry, who had returned his gaze to the floor, stared back up at him, his green eyes erratic.
He supposed it was only fair of Malfoy to make him wait for it after Harry had abandoned him the other day in potions but it was so mean! Harry was so turned on that it hurt and every time he thought if Malfoy, he could barely keep from moaning.
“Hmm” Hermione said, looking thoughtful “did this person happen to be from another house?”
Harry was all for that idea, he could barely concentrate on the lesson anyway. He went into the store cupboard with half of the rest of the class but soon realised that he had no idea what he was looking for. He waited until everyone else had left before racking his brains to try and remember the ingredients.
His dark mood lightened as he remembered that Malfoy had said the same thing earlier and he smiled, imagining everything he could do to pay Malfoy back.
“What are yo-“ Harry began but he was cut off by Malfoy hushing him again.
Harry eyed her levelly and lifted one shoulder “could’ve been.”
But the way Draco had stared at him, the way he had let Harry read deep into his silver eyes made him feel like he was diving headfirst into the darkest recesses of his soul anyway. He stumbled and reached a hand out against the wall so as to stop himself from falling. He screwed his eyes tightly shut and exhaled sharply, trying and failing to force the fleeting retention of Draco's stunned, exhilarated expression out of his brain. No one is irredeemable. Was that true? Was Draco forgivable? He tried to recount everything the boy had done; bullying those weaker, calling Hermione names, killing Dumbledore. Harry's eyes shot open, that memory still hurt and yet, and yet, and yet- that lost look in his eyes standing beside his father, the absolute self-loathing bristling into anger when arbitrated for his part in the war, that wounded expression so many years ago when Harry had refused his friendship. His mind argued no but his heart sang a resounding yes and he knew, deep down, that if Draco looked at him again like he had just now, he might splinter.
Later that day, Harry was finally cornered by Hermione. It was her and Ron’s day off from prefect patrol and Ron had gone straight to the common room for a game of chess against Seamus, unknowingly surrendering Harry to violent interrogation. Harry hadn’t felt able to stomach another pitiful attempt at playing Ron, or Ginny’s unwanted advances so he had stayed in the dormitory, thinking that here at least he would be left alone. Oh how wrong he had been.
“Don’t be like that, “ she continued cheerfully “I’ve been nice so far, not mentioning a thing to Ron.”
“Hey Ginny” he said wearily as she sat next to him and inched closer.
He gaped as Malfoy disappeared round a corner.
He’d been staring at Harry for too long, jade now flashing from his skull in confusion and Draco glowered back before quickly returning his gaze to his own parchment. Even if he had wanted to reverse everything, it would be unmanageable. He had been irretrievably moulded to Harry’s desired shape, donned a black cape and malicious smirk all the better to fit the part of “clever villain” and now the whole world knew him this way. Proud, arrogant, immoral. But Draco had been imagined fully developed by the genius of an eleven year old- without any depth or complexity and so he had had to create his own.
He heard her calling his name out after him but walked briskly away, silently fuming. Malfoy was going to pay for this.
His smirk grew "Well, since you asked nicely maybe I can think of some other way to punish you..." he trailed off giving Harry a heated look that made his pulse race, and he gasped as Malfoy pushed him against the wall and cast a spell, conjuring ropes hanging from the walls. Harry's mouth fell open and Draco used his hesitation to swiftly tie his arms tightly onto the walls. Harry would've thought it would terrify him, to be tied up and at the mercy of his arch nemesis but all he felt was arousal, hot and heavy spiking through every nerve.
“Please” Harry groaned softly, very aware of all the other people just on the other side of the bookcase.
"Well well" Malfoy smirked "Harry Potter out after curfew, I should report you."
“Room of Requirement, 10:00” he said before releasing Harry’s member and stepping back from him.
Harry vaguely nodded. He honestly
"Thanks" he muttered, rubbing his wrists now circled with a thin red line. He was definitely going to hex Malfoy for this.
“Sssh” Malfoy murmured as he suddenly slowed down again and Harry couldn’t keep from groaning in desperation.
He awoke with a gasp. Finally breaching the ice-thin yet seemingly unbreakable surface of his dream like the breathless victim of a stormy sea. A violently and increasingly reoccurring stormy sea. Yes, less a dream or even nightmare and more a fierce tide of his most dreaded fears and worst memories, black tendrils of the past leeching colourlessly into his night-time vulnerability and drowning him in recollections and blood and death.
“Couldn’t sleep” Harry answered shortly. Hermione raised a suspicious eyebrow.
Harry stared at Malfoy unmoving for a beat before the words sank in. He could barely breath with how turned he suddenly was but his eyes darkened and he obeyed, sinking unsteadily to the floor.
Harry eyed him pleadingly "Come on Malfoy, please?"
“Maybe. Are you?”
Malfoy smirked at him. “Good.”
Malfoy smirked casually “does that maybe actually mean the Weaslette?” Harry scowled at Malfoy’s correct guess “And no I’m not hiding. I came here to get something from you.”
“Yes I’m sure.” Harry grinned, wishing it was true “Stop worrying about me, Ron’s getting jealous.”
“Honestly! That’s the truth” Harry insisted and she nodded grudgingly.
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Fine, don’t answer but you know I’ll find out anyway.” She grinned “I always do.”
"But why wouldn't I when it's so easy to do?"
Harry stared back, searching tirelessly through liquid silver, Draco’s furrowed brow for once unsteady, his gaze for once wide-open and Harry’s stomach clenched; shadows stealing through his veins, darkness winding around his bones. He took a deep breath and for a single moment, he let it.
“Valerian root”
"Yes please, if you wouldn't mind."
Harry tried and failed not to roll his eyes “couldn’t sleep.” He muttered.
Harry could already feel himself growing hard and moaned while pressing his lips against Malfoy’s neck. Malfoy traced a finger along Harry’s jaw but Harry seized his wrist, pinning it to the wall above their heads and holding it there. Harry bit Malfoy’s bottom lip and tugged it gently with his teeth before kissing him fiercely. He felt Malfoy shudder against his mouth as their tongues collided, battling for dominance. After only a few moments, Harry pulled back.
The common room was quiet when he walked in although not completely empty despite the early hour. Harry slid on to the coach and rubbed his tired eyes.
Harry’s eyes narrowed, finally grasping his senses and overcoming the helpless state that he had been found in (it was degrading enough to have been seen like that by anyone, let alone Draco Malfoy) but he said nothing, if only to ensure no further humiliation.
“I have!” he countered defensively but Ron just smiled at him
Harry didn’t respond but felt his cheeks go even redder.
“Stand up.” Draco commanded and Harry rose carefully, trying not to stumble without sight or the use of his arms.
Harry woke early to the earnest light of day filtering through his drapes, eyes fluttering softly open, but he didn’t move. Lying still in a curled ball of relief that he had reached morning after all, he coerced fleeting terrors of his disturbed sleep out of his mind, and tried to focus instead on the new day ahead. Moments slipped into minutes as he gradually felt the darkness uncoil from his ribcage and soon the shuffling of Ron and the others that he shared a dorm with drove him out of his own thoughts. He pulled back the curtains of his four-poster and the strained smile he wore became genuine as the prospect of another day filled with friends and Hogwarts and distractions lifted him out of his souring mood.
“Just go away.” He eventually murmured in a flat voice full of weary exhaustion and closed his eyes.
He knew he was saying too much, exposing more of himself than he should have, but he felt steady all of a sudden, even as he was falling through swirling emerald lakes, drowning in green tears that were not filled with loathing and lips that were not curved in spite.
“Are you okay?”
It would be terrible to desire for things to return to how they had been, but Draco couldn’t help longing for the time that everything had been coherent as clockwork, his own purpose defined in palpable lines of order and command, the weight of blame lifted by the Dark Lord himself, even if his dwindling authority was stained in fear and irrationality. But then it had turned out that Draco hadn’t been his father after all; morality not so easily extinguished by power and terror alone and he couldn’t stop the conscience his father had failed to beat out of him from his mind. But he had been able to control it. Decide every move acting on a false superiority and falser hate. But that was before Harry had saved him from the fire, before Draco had seen Crabbe’s body reduced to sifting ash and he couldn’t feign the hatred anymore.
Harry eyed it speculatively, he already knew Malfoy was good with his mouth but he was determined to outdo him, so he started by giving Malfoy a slow, leisurely lick. Malfoy’s hops jerked involuntarily and he released a soft moan. Harry realised that Malfoy must have spent the day in as much pain as he had.
“Potter?”
Harry sat down in a worn leather armchair, utterly exhausted from all this thinking, all this curiosity, all this confusion. He had never coped well in new, uncontrollable situations although he’d faced enough for a life time. He drummed his fingers nervously against his thigh, trying to let the warmth and chatter of the other Gryffindors drown out his own mind and misperceptions but nonetheless the most disturbing question of all started ringing unease in his ears. He leaned back and closed his eyes- when had the boy he had always known as Malfoy inexplicably shifted to Draco? The familiar darkness trailed an icy, searching finger up his spine.
“What did you say?” Malfoy hissed, keeping the pace impossibly slow. Harry could barely keep still or keep from screaming.
. He hollowed his cheeks, sliding his lips all the way down to the base of Malfoy’s pulsating member.
Draco felt something stir inside of him, not quite new but familiar, something different from the ache he carried with him always, different from the angst that overwhelmed him while lying alone in his bed, different even from the breath of relief that he felt in the cool night air as he breathed wind and for a heartbeat felt utterly and completely alive. He slumped against the wall next to Harry and sank slowly down until he was sitting beside him. He stared straight ahead at the opposite wall, hearing Harry let out an exasperated sigh.
Unconsciously, he licked his lips as Malfoy slowly unbuckled his belt and let his hardening cock spring free.
He effectively attacked Harry’s neck with teeth and tongue and heat. Harry wasn’t sure how much longer he’d last and Malfoy hadn’t even touched his cock yet.
“Dittany” he moaned and Harry rewarded him by trailing his fingers down Malfoy’s chest and past his stomach to the shaft straining against his clothes. Harry released Malfoy’s hand and carefully unbuttoned Malfoy’s shirt, nails scratching sharply against his skin, although he fell to his knees and traced the marks with his tongue afterwards.
She swiftly muttered a counter spell and the ropes disappeared, Harry quickly did his belt back up.
“Hey Harry!” He was jolted out of his reverie by Hermione sliding on to the bench next to him and observing him with thoughtful concern “You look ill, are you feeling okay?”
As Ron sat across from Harry and began piling his plate with mountainous heaps of food (“I need lots of energy for Quidditch practice Harry, quit smirking!”) Harry tiredly swept sleep-heavy eyes around the Great Hall and found that his gaze came to rest on Malfoy, pointed chin propped up on one hand and his grey eyes half-closed; slitted in what could only be exhaustion to the bare bone, and Harry pondered if perhaps he was not the only eighth year that had trouble sleeping. He wondered if Malfoy too was still haunted by the war, flashing images of smeared grey and red stealing through his unconscious. Or maybe Malfoy was just tired and Harry was overthinking things again. He half-smiled. Although Malfoy had slowly regained popularity after the battle and his father’s trial, sentencing him to Azkaban, Harry still felt acutely distrusting towards the boy- years of hostility and hatred inerasable from the crimson splattered portrait that had made up Harry’s life so far, no matter how hard he had tried to move on from them. Even Hermione was doing her best to embrace house unity and give him a second chance, although Harry knew that Ron’s deep-set reservations were equally, if not more, interminable than his own.
“Harry?” He started and looked up at his best friend’s crinkling blue eyes
He heard quiet footsteps approaching, getting louder and he tensed in apprehension and screwed his eyes tightly shut.
“I’m better than okay.” He said.
“Yeah I’m fine, just tired and definitely not looking forward to history of magic this afternoon.” He responded, almost laughing at her doe-eyed concern which seemed to continue to antagonize her about all kinds of trivial matters which, compared to what they had lived through, seemed particularly inconsequential.
“Do you not understand the meaning of ‘leave me alone’?”
Something felt different tonight. Draco could sense that something had shifted in the tenuous but oh so rigid atmosphere of the castle, in the frail, ageless web spun of magic and dreamers and him, the lone night walker. He supressed a shudder and moved on, he had never been afraid of the dark or the unfamiliar- it had always seemed to him that the worst of humanity was that which he already knew. His nocturnal wanderings had become somewhat of a ritual since returning to Hogwarts. Here he didn’t have big private room or a picturesque balcony to grieve upon, but the cold outside air tranquilised him nonetheless, at least enough to get through the endless days and nights of drifting pretence.
He suddenly realised how close they were, Malfoy's eyelashes were almost brushing his skin, he could feel every tiny movement his body made against him, and Harry was sure that it wasn't Malfoy's wand bulging against his leg.
“What took you so long?” Ron asked while distractedly staring at his textbook when Harry clunked his ingredients down on the table.
He grinned as Malfoy emerged from the storeroom with his own ingredients and glowered darkly at Harry. The look was angry and arousing, but most importantly- it promised payback.
Hermione gazed at him, eyes suddenly serious. “One more question” she said quietly.
Yet he still did not move because his skin felt thin as glass that refused to shatter and he wanted to, no he needed to feel the hurt swirling on the inside burn his outside too in ice drops that clung to his fair skin and seared in a divine kind of agony.
“What’s wrong?” Draco’s question sounded stiff, sympathy altogether a strange sound when passing from his usually smirking lips and Harry’s eyes widened in disbelief again.
Harry sighed as he got up and made his way down to the common room, internally praying that Hermione had the sense not to tell anyone about what she had seen- especially not Ron. Harry suppressed a shudder. Now
They didn’t have potions the next day, which Harry was for once disappointed about- it was their only lesson with the Slytherins and, thus, one of the few times he was sure to see Malfoy. But maybe it was good to not interact with him for a day because of one thing he was now certain. If he wanted to continue things with Malfoy, no one could find out. And that included Hermione.
Sorry for the wait, I’ve had to study for exams coming up *drone* but hopefully this chapter makes up for it. Thanks so much for the encouraging comments guys, they mean so so much to me!
Malfoy was there when he entered, lounging casually against the wall, arms crossed.
His eyes snapped open at Hermione's utterly shocked voice. Although this was completely beyond humiliating, he was deeply glad that he hadn't been found by someone less caring than his best friend.
He wished things would get simple again.
He felt Draco’s fingers slid over his throat and tug him forward and then something hot and wet sliding over his face. Fingers at the back of his head finally tugged the blindfold off and Harry was returned to harsh, vivid light.
Draco smirked and produced his wand, quickly flicking it and making both of their clothes disappear. Harry gasped as the cold air spilled against his skin and devoured Malfoy’s flawless skin and toned body with his eyes.
“Oh nothing” Harry responded innocently “I forgot what we needed but I just needed someone to jog my memory.”
"Er.. would you like some help there?" She feigned casualness but Harry could still feel the disbelief in her steady voice.
When evening came, Harry roamed the empty halls, trying to clear his mind while dodging the prefects that were carrying out their patrols. Hearing someone coming, he darted around a corner and closed his eyes until he heard them move away and released a breath he hadn't known he was holding. When he opened his eyes, he found that he hadn't avoided exposure after all but had run straight into another prefect. Draco Malfoy. All the memories of their earlier make out came flooding back and Harry felt excitement coarse through his body.
this much- since when did the inner workings of Malfoy’s brain begin to intrigue him so? Harry had always seen the world as separated into two; clear cut stripes of black and white without hazy lines or shades of grey. Good and bad, light and dark and Harry had always known where everything had fitted- him on one side and Malfoy on the other: opposites, rivals, perfect enemies and nothing more or less. So why now was Malfoy of all people making him question the very philosophy upon which he had based so much? The belief that he had applied to every decision ever made. It was as if Harry had been living in two dimensions, only now seeing the world in colour; the depth and shading all around him imperceptible until now. He could no longer tell what was right and wrong- if the distinction even existed or was just obscured in shadow.
"See you in potions Potter."
Draco turned to look at him.
“Alright…”she responded sceptically, eyeing him once over before finally allowing him to brush off her concern. She beamed over at Ron, who reached a hand over the table to lace his fingers with hers and Harry quickly turned away to discuss the Chudley Cannon’s past season’s luck (or rather lack thereof) with Seamus. And this was where Harry belonged. Wedged between friends at the Gryffindor table, debating thoughts on Quidditch strategy and spells and teachers, he glanced back at Ron, who had swiftly joined in his favourite topic of conversation, loudly defying the Cannon’s disgrace, his hand still resting loosely in Hermione’s. Yes, this was where Harry belonged, even if some things did take a while to get used to. Even if no matter how much contentment and amity he consumed, he couldn’t seem to fill this dark-edged emptiness inside his belly. Even if somewhere, deep inside he felt like everything was starting to spiral out of control.
He slid down to the floor, eyes swimming in molten pain. Tonight, he would die and tomorrow he would be reborn, but for now he let the ache consume him, flashes of silver whirling against his eyelids as he stripped down every slowly shattering barricade, one by one, apprehensive and fearful of what he might find. And when he woke tomorrow, he would be indestructible.
Eventually the tension left his shoulders and he sagged back against the bed, feeling his wrists finally being released as he gently pulled out of Draco, watching the other boys face for signs of pain before they both collapsed and Harry’s thoughts were once again lost to darkness.
“Of course I do but leaving you alone right now will just add to the never-ending list of unforgivable things I’ve done to hurt you.”
But then his train of thought was completely disrupted by Draco placing a hand on his chest and pushing him further into the mattress as he learnt over him.
Malfoy tilted his chin back arrogantly and when he spoke his voice was husky and low, the only indication that told Harry that the other boy wanted him just as much as Harry did.
But the sun inevitably began its steep climb and the crimson rays pricked his eyelids, even if dawn was still a far-off dream, so he began to piece himself back together into the proud, untouchable boy that the world knew him as and his joints hardly cracked as he stood and returned to elegance, the brittle but entirely resilient façade back in place. He strode gracefully back through the castle to his room before anyone had the chance to appreciate his exodus. Before anyone had the chance to feel the emanating waves of wretched misery, muted to echoing murmurs. Before anyone had a chance to clutch his nightly moment of weakness. Draco Malfoy had always been anything but weak.
slip out to Ron or even-“ she paused, an evil look in her eye “Ginny.”
Harry could barely contain his frustration but he knew that a whole load of people were filling the library and there was nothing he could do. He took a deep breath and got up to follow Malfoy out of the library. He would just have to wait for 10:00. Harry could hardly contain his excitement.
He grabbed Malfoy's wrists with his free hand and pinned them against the wall above their heads, only mildly surprised when the other boy made no motion to resist.
But perhaps Draco was more fortunate than most for at least he was no longer blind to reality while Granger and Weasley still looked at their friend with sightless admiration. But at least they had found each other (there is little solace in the shadow of greatness other than those they share it with) while he had been dyed in shades of indigo isolation; sought for his family name and then for the name he had made for himself yet set apart by the iridescent signature on his shoulder- vibrant emerald marking him, owning him, dictating who he was. But would Draco even have changed things if he could?
All of a sudden, the world dissipated into darkness. Harry blinked and heard a soft chuckle. He froze for a moment before he felt the fabric against his skin- Malfoy had blind-folded him. Harry’s heart rate thudded harder. He could feel his own prick straining against his clothes.
“And then?” Harry prompted, faintly caressing the outline of Malfoy’s pulsating member.
And then Malfoy was fumbling with his belt, allowing Harry's average sized erection to spring free. Draco eyed it intensely, a smirk still visible on his delicate features. Harry's eyes slid shut as Malfoy's mouth was suddenly on him and he let out a deep moan as Malfoy took his member further and further into his mouth and Harry briefly wondered how he wasn't gagging. But then all coherent thought vanished from his mind as Malfoy's tongue was swirling around his member, pushing Harry closer and closer to the edge. He looked down and the sight of Draco's mouth filled with his shaft sent him spiralling into a vortex of bliss. Distantly, he noticed Malfoy swallowing around him and the thought sent even more pleasure pulsating through him. Malfoy stood back up and kissed Harry passionately before pulling back and eyeing him thoughtfully. He smiled devilishly and gave Harry's cheek a gentle pat before starting to walk away.
“I told you, I’m fine not that it’s anything to do with you anyway. In fact, it’s just my damn luck that the person I least wanted to see right now happens to turn up. What are you doing down here anyway? I should probably report you, I bet Filch will catch me out after curfew now and I’ll have to clean the stupid trophies again, which is exactly what I need at this moment in my life and-” He stopped himself, internally cursing that he’d let himself ramble on as usual, and embarrass himself yet again in front of Malfoy. He ran a lightly shuddering hand through his unruly hair which did nothing to flatten it. Leaning back against the wall, he regarded Draco’s closed expression and lightly smirking lips with divulged irritation.
Harry cleared his throat, cheeks flaming. “Someone else couldn’t sleep either...” he said vaguely, hoping that he would throw Hermione off the scent of the ‘someone’ being a prefect.
Draco sighed again, trying hopelessly to pay attention to Slughorn’s drone but Harry had stared at him this morning, and even if it had been with aversion, those bottle green irises were an image he had tried and failed countless times to drive from his mind. The battle of Hogwarts had been about more than just the end of Voldemort for Draco- the scales had finally fallen from his eyes and he had seen things as they truly were, and always had been since that day so many years ago in Madam Malkin’s when he had first glimpsed the saviour and who would become Draco’s biggest rival.
Harry woke up bright and early the next morning, despite the countless hours he had lain awake, arousal and nervousness still simultaneously pulsing through his veins. He couldn’t deny the dark desire that Malfoy’s tactics had elicited in him, although he could’ve done without the embarrassing scene with Hermione.
Malfoy ground his hips violently, panting and groaning with wide eyes as Harry brushed something deep inside him, his cock already half hard again. After only a few more rolls of Malfoy’s hips, Harry was lost to blind pleasure, senses distorted and vague, he distantly heard himself crying out as he spilled his orgasm inside of Malfoy.
Harry glowered at her for what felt like a long time.
“Er… nothing” he replied despondently and Draco wondered if the murmured empathy wasn’t startling Harry as much as it was himself.
Harry found himself breathless and unable to form coherent sentences so just nodded silently.
“Payback?” Harry murmured and Malfoy nipped at his throat in response.
Hermione shrugged “That’s not
“Faster” he managed to stammer out, any semblance at a game lost to the wind with sense and coherency.
People slowly started filtering into the hall. He made sure that Neville and Ron sat on either side of him and Seamus directly opposite just so that Hermione couldn’t question him through breakfast. He couldn’t help himself from staring unabashedly when Malfoy walked in, though he hid his gaze with his hand, Something uncoiling deep within him when Malfoy shot him a knowing look. Suddenly Harry couldn’t wait until potions.
“Good to know.” Pansy smirked. “You better tend to him before he drowns in the bath. The Calming Draught I gave him was rather strong. Goodnight.” She Apparated away.
…” He pulled Harry into a loose embrace. “
Draco frowned. "Why do you need those jumpers when you have me?"
Harry heard the sharp pop of Apparition, signaling Draco had left for the office. He slumped against shower wall, hiccoughing and wrapping his arms around his knees. He stared down at himself, assessing the damage from last night. Deep bruises forming on his legs and hip. His head thudded against the bathroom wall. He should be upset, but he had asked for Draco to take him roughly. He sighed, standing slowly and washing his body robotically. Exiting the shower, he wrapped his body with the plush towel and collapsed onto his bed.
A small smile flitted across Draco's face. "After everything we've been through, I don't think I could be cruel to Harry if I tried." Draco chewed on his bottom lip slightly. "I love him so
“Okay.”
“Yes, I’m quite sure. There’s only three mild Lust Potions that would make your body feel hot like it did. Only one of them has coriander in them.”
Harry smiled, pressing ever closer. “I very much want to get out of here.”
“It’s brilliant really, she laces them with a bit of Euphoria — most potion-makers do, because who doesn’t want to be calm and happy at the same time.” Harry chuckled. “But she also adds a
"Then... how?" Harry breathed.
Harry placed his chin on the top of his hands. “Would you be so kind and get us four more shots of tequila?”
“No, it’s not.” Draco smirked. “I may have done the same. You have a type.”
“Why?”
Lord Malfoy stiffened. “I know of your family and financial standings,
“I… er…” Harry brought his thumb once again to his mouth.
Harry scowled. “Why does everyone want to watch me get drunk?”
Draco ran a hand through his hair, frustrated with the information that had been laid on his desk. His current case was falling apart and Cristler was already on his back about it. He hadn’t expected his witness to recant their statement. He sighed, staring at the clock. It was already past seven and he needed to send an owl to Harry saying he’d be late again. He leaned back in his chair, pulling a spare piece of parchment from a drawer in his desk when his office door opened.
“You’re a terrible fucking tease, Potter.” Draco ground out.
Pansy lifted the square to his face. “He would have much preferred an image of you in the bath.
The song changed and Harry lit up like a Christmas tree. “Dance with me?”
Harry took Draco’s hand, leaning in slightly. “I will if you will.”
“A few weeks ago.”
Harry slipped his arm around Draco’s waist. “In the living room, perhaps? Just to be comfortable.”
Harry leaned into Draco. “It’s because you’re extraordinarily good at your job.”
“At least you know that your parents were kind.” Draco countered. “That they did everything in their power to protect you. Look at my father, he sold me out for a shorter Azkaban sentence. If it hadn’t been for your testimony, I’d be there today.”
of Magical Law Enforcement worked through their investigation, but he couldn’t help wishing he could just get back to work. Bury himself in paperwork and come home to Harry. The dark-haired wizard set a plate of toast and bacon, then hopped up on the island.
“Practically silent.” Ron snorted.
“I see…” Quentin scribbled again in his notepad.
“Your fourteen citations say otherwise.” The blonde pinched the space between his brows. “You’ve experienced something traumatic on more than one occasion. You have nightmares – do not deny they don’t exist because I can hear you at night. You isolate yourself, yet you don’t want to be alone. The hyper-sexuality while intoxicated—”
“On the bed.” Draco corrected. “I don’t think it would be wise to do this on the carpet.”
Draco shot a feral grin at him. "Can I help you?"
“Sit.” He instructed. “We have much to discuss.” Draco and Harry sat respectively in the two chairs placed in front of the desk. “You’ve done some rather distasteful things in your life that I have overlooked, but this is by far the most idiotic. That betrothal to Astoria Greengrass has been in place since you were nine days old. What on Gaea’s green Earth would possess you to spit on that?”
Harry moaned again. “W-what do I do?”
“I see…” Harry stood, pulling a towel from the rack. “Let’s get you out of there before you drown.”
Draco and Harry tumbled through their Floo, landing heavily on the living room floor. Harry snickered drunkenly, shoving his hands beneath Draco’s t-shirt while the Slytherin undid the buttons of his shirt. The blonde groaned as he ran his blunt nails down his abdomen. Draco flipped them so he lay between Harry’s legs. Leaning back, he made quick work of Harry’s button fly and yanked the jeans off his slim hips, revealing the brunette had gone commando.
Harry blushed. “I may have looked into you… slightly…”
“To get into your pants, presumably.” Draco replied, curling their hands towards his chest.
“Doesn’t mean you wouldn’t read it.”
“You u-used my shampoo?” Draco hiccoughed.
“Congratulations.” He simpered.
Draco shuffled through his files. “The most ancient and distinguished.”
“He’s not. All he’s doing is giving you the time to deal with what happened.” Harry pushed the plate over, scooting himself closer to Draco. “We learned at a very young age to take the bad things that happen to us and put them in a box and shove the box into a dark place where we don’t deal with it. War can do that to children. It makes us very fucked up adults.” Draco snorted. “But we bring people into our lives that hopefully will let us cope with our scary boxes. People to lean on. Significant others, for example.”
“I don’t want to hurt you.”
not a color he fancied. He tapped the doorknob with his wand and entered the house. Apparently, the little note followed him, giving him new instructions.
“Because you are the ultimate Light Wizard.” Blaise said offhandedly. “Perfectly laced up and we, as Slytherins, want to pull the string and watch your undoing.”
“All the more reason to stay married to one another.” Draco replied. “At least it’ll give them nothing to report on if we’re some boring married couple.”
Harry shivered slightly, gulping down the rest of his drink. “Yes, I can.”
“Hooray…” Harry deadpanned.
“I know…” Harry looked down at his hands.
Draco looked him up and down. “A Muggle suit?”
“Harry is a grown adult. He’s allowed to explore his own sexuality.”
Harry frowned, looking down at his outfit. "Your Christmas present."
“I see…” Hermione pulled the two of them into an alcove. “He hasn’t told you anything a Reid, has he?”
“W-what?”
Lysander smirked. “My Father has never been very approving of anything.” He turned his attention back to Harry. “I hear you even spoke back to him. That’s very brave.”
“Wait?” Harry stopped her. “Why aren’t the Aurors coming tonight? They would come tonight. That’s the protocol.”
I did?”

no more visiting Potter. No more free treats either, and that was a tragedy, but if he absolutely needed to indulge the occasional craving, well he could probably convince Pansy or Blaise to file an Owl Post Order for him.

“It—it would be. Will be. But—” Harry licked his lips. “Maybe I don’t want it to go so fast. Maybe I want there to—to be less magic?”
Harry came to a stop just in front of the oven, leaning back against it. “Yeah, I know. It’s just—protocol, that kind of tripe, that’s all.” Draco was staring down into the sink at the toppled teapot, though Harry suspected his mind was elsewhere—like buried in the Department of Mysteries, locked away where no one would be able to find him this time, trapped in a deep, dreamless slumber. “It’s not urgent, he said. It was just a reminder. We don’t have to go right now—”
Harry ran a finger along the warm, familiar wood, pensive. “…I don’t quite know what to do with it, to be honest. I could put it away, I guess. Claim it was broken and get a new one, but…” He shrugged. “It’s my wand. The first one I ever got—one of my first real birthday presents. I got it the day I found out I was a wizard, did you know? I…I can’t bear to part with it, if I don’t have to…” He had so many memories with his holly wand—it had defended him, so valiantly, and even if it was Death’s wand, even if it claimed some manner of sentience and ached to be used to evil ends, Harry didn’t want to abandon it, to just toss it aside. It wasn’t as if his wand had
Bragge held his hands up defensively, easing back from his desk. “Your pardon, Mr. Malfoy—it’s nothing nasty. We’ll simply need a bigger space to work.”

changed things, it had, but really in a rather different way than he’d assumed it might.

like a Death Eater.
“I didn’t think you’d actually spill inside me…” Draco tried to ease up onto his knees—but it was far too soon, and he collapsed back onto Harry’s cock with a satisfying squelch.
The ratty red jumper had been quickly changed out for a scrap of leather poorly sewn together into something resembling a glove, and sometimes Potter would lay it across his drawn-up knees and invite Draco to perch there. Never one to miss an opportunity to glower down imperiously, Draco often took him up on it, and so passed the evening hours. Potter had even learned—through trial and many, many an error—where Draco would allow himself to be stroked and where would otherwise earn a swift retaliatory bite or scratch. He was no one’s pet, but a gentle brush of the finger along the feathery ridge over his beak felt
He was so caught up in his own thoughts he nearly bumped right into Mrs. Weasley, who was levitating a casserole out of the oven. “Goodness, Harry, do be careful!” she chided, then caught herself. “Oh dear, you’re red as a tomato. Are you feeling all right? It’s awfully stuffy in this kitchen, you should go out and get some fresh air.”
The banding station, it turned out, was where a bored-looking young man in an Eeylops uniform magically applied an engraved metal band to owls’ legs to mark them as property of a given witch or wizard. Potter was a smart man who liked his ears still attached to his head and not shredded into a bloody mess, so he declined several times over until Weasley insisted, “Someone could steal him, though! He sticks out like a sore thumb—and it’s free with every purchase over a thirty Galleons, and I’d say you’ve

Could he pop down to London at the weekends instead of pissing around Hogsmeade with the rest of the riff-raff? Even Apparition had its limitations, after all, and a fair share of risk for the inexperienced.

Harry had to admit, Draco knew what he was doing. The collar was a bit high for his comfort, and he was still convinced he was overdressed for the occasion—surely a nice set of trousers and suit jacket would have been sufficient—but he didn’t dislike the man he saw staring back at him from the mirror, and given the way his eyes darkened, like a storm rolling in, Draco didn’t either.
Draco lazily flipped through a two-week-old issue of
Potter lifted his head, brows knit in befuddlement. “Huh?”
“What’s wrong?” Draco asked, grey eyes hooded and wary.

Draco gave him a slow, patient blink that suggested he ought to choose his next words very carefully, as the implication Draco was bad at his job (where ‘his job’ had been instructing his own owl to fly to London and back inside of six hours) was bordering on offensive—and Potter held both hands up.

She stood there, hovering over him anxiously, as he unrolled the parchment and began to run his eyes silently over the contents. He could feel her practically vibrating out of her skin with worry, and she gave a little gasp when his shoulders slumped and he released a long, beleaguered sigh.
“Oh,” Draco said, a mirthless smile tugging at his lips. “I see what this is. There are worse places to work—so I ought to gleefully accept a position with a force I
Harry had warned Mrs. Weasley in advance that he would be bringing Draco along as his dinner guest, hoping she would pass the word around to Bill so he didn’t try to Hex Draco on sight again, but he could not have possibly prepared himself for the sight of Molly flinging herself at Draco the moment they’d stepped through the Floo, wrapping him in a crushing hug that he’d be feeling for a few days.

But no, the Wizengamot in their gracious magnanimity and grand wisdom had seen fit to direct him to return to Hogwarts and participate in the newly instated ‘Eighth Year’ course that McGonagall had established to allow former seventh-year students who felt they’d been deprived an adequate final year of education to get in one last hurrah. As his attendance was tied to his probationary terms, and since declining to return would have earned him a quick trip to Azkaban to share a cell with his father, here Draco was, talons curled around his favoured roosting branch as he peered from one of the windows out into the Courtyard far below.
They drank deep to Zabini’s memory—and even knocked back a shot to Crabbe’s—and a few drams later, Goyle was blubbering an apology and confessing he’d hid in the Hufflepuff Common room when he’d roused after Harry and Draco had saved him from the Fiendfyre, as the entrance had been left open, perhaps by students hoping others might find sanctuary within. “Didn’ even fight, I didn’ want to… Just wanted to be a part of somethin’…”

something. You can’t just drop in on someone’s winter break without warning them and expect to have your every whim catered to. Impromptu appearances strike me as something you pure-blood types would frown on.” He gave Draco a twinkling side-eye. “…Flying by the seat of one’s pants is rather Gryffindor of you, I think. Maybe we’ve been spending too much time together.”
He must have dithered too long with his silent inner whinging, for Potter lifted up onto his toes the few inches’ difference between them and closed the gap himself.
“Yeah, all right,” Potter said, easy-going like they were best mates taking the piss out of one another. “Who’d you talk to?”
one to talk. You’re ready to take heads off the moment someone disparages the good name of Weasley or Granger.” He then allowed himself a superior little smile. “Or steals your Snitch.”
He supposed, in retrospect, this would have been the perfect opportunity to leave off with this ‘study-partner-slash-tutor-slash-taskmaster’ business altogether and begin rebuilding the crumbling walls meant to keep Potter well out of his life, and had Draco been thinking beyond the next weekend, he might have done so. He would have seen that getting more involved with Potter,

An idea struck him, like a bolt out of the blue. A terrible idea—mad, Draco would say—that was either going to get him killed or kissed, but it was all he had to work with at the moment, so he decided to run with it. He’d been very good about not being

Instinct took over—the owl’s or the human’s, he couldn’t tell—and he began flailing and flapping, talons raking but only catching air, finding no purchase, and when he opened his mouth to scream, all that came out was the owl’s awful, rasping hiss. Jaws clamped onto his throat, pressing and holding until his lungs burned for want of air and the screeching hiss began to fade—

As expected, he was the first to arrive in the Owlery, and he took his time, entering through one of the highest windows and spiralling his way through the rafters. Most of the perches were empty, with many of the owls either being out on deliveries or hunting, and the few that remained only sparing him brief glances before going back to their naps or grooming.
Draco stared at him, deadpan. Right, this might take a bit more finesse than he’d anticipated. “…I
Draco’s response was to slip back into his owl form, hop up onto his designated perch, and turn his back to Potter as he fumed silently for the remainder of the evening.
Thenceforth, Draco came by fairly regularly in the evening after meals in the idle hours before curfew. Some days, Potter’s roommates were present, and others, Potter wasn’t around at all. But on the odd nights when Potter actually used his free time to put forth a bit of effort instead of sailing through his classes, he allowed Draco to join him, taking critiques in relative stride and offering treats freshly procured from the finest shops in Diagon Alley as thanks.

“…I don’t know,” he said, distractedly. “I expect his sycophants will be fighting themselves for the honour of hoisting him up on their shoulders and toasting to his atrociously expected career choice, with me an unwitting and unwilling tag-along. I’ll seem a poor sport if I don’t attend as well.” He pulled a sour, mocking face. “And naturally you’ll want me to make a good impression on my new compatriots, no?”
In a pique of adrenaline-fuelled anger and surprise, he lashed out with everything he had, and he screeched in triumph when he felt his free talon strike flesh. Potter yelped, and Draco was free. He took a tumble but managed to catch himself, soaring through one of the windows on the opposite side of the tower and transforming back before he’d even made it to ground level. He collapsed onto his knees as his feet hit the straw-covered ground with a sharp

Nonverbal casting was useful for stealth—but what happened once stealth failed you? What happened when they snapped your wand in half?

Still, Potter needed all the help he could get if he wanted to have a prayer of getting at least Es on his N.E.W.T.s, so to the Greenhouses they awayed, or the Owlery, or—on evenings when Potter’s roommates had other plans of their own—to Gryffindor Tower, where Draco would perch on Potter’s knee and harass him while he worked.

Though he wasn’t entirely sure he was going to be
“I do love our conversations,” Harry drawled. “The sweet nothings you grace me with are just what I need to hear at the end of a taxing day.” Draco rolled his eyes and fell back against his pillow with a disgusted huff. “…And I know. I’m done forcing myself to be what I’m not—but it’s not the easiest step to take, you know?”

“Don’t pretend you didn’t deserve it. I gave you all
. What the fuck do you
“And what do I get in return?” he asked, edging them back into corners he was comfortable occupying.
Draco stared at him, expression blank. “Do you have any idea how mortifying it is to be the only wizard at a party wearing slacks with your dress robes instead of formal breeches because you’ve got a great big silver cuff on your leg you can’t explain away?”
without humiliating himself before the blessed Saviour, it seemed.
Draco met his challenge with a fierce glare, biting savagely into a piece of toast.
it perfect.
“Widowed.”
orgy,” Harry explained, cheeks heating.
Suddenly, he was somewhere dark, and quiet, and Potter was gently setting him down on something soft, carefully stroking the top of his head, the way he’d been petting the little Scops only moments ago. “There, you can change back now, if you like. Er, assuming it
Draco had been halfway to the door, trying to tune out Potter’s rambling, but
Draco’s parents insisted on biweekly visits for lunch, and try as Harry might to get Ron and Hermione to come along and help make the tense meals a bit more bearable, they refused to be budged. “We’d die for you, mate,” Ron assured him with a clap on the shoulder, “but there are some sacrifices you just can’t ask us to make.” Harry could hardly blame them, but he really didn’t enjoy the meals, and he honestly didn’t think Draco did either, always bustling them back through the Floo before dessert had even settled in their stomachs.

Drats. There went his ‘succinct response’ strategy. He took a breath, practising his lines. If he couldn’t convince her to submit his application for him—weeks after the official filing date—he’d be N.E.W.T.-less and looking at, at best, a job slinging frozen treats for whoever owned Fortescue’s now.
barely fit alone. Besides, we’re going different ways.”
want to ‘just leave it at that’ when it came to what had been one of the most emotionally traumatising moments of his young life, but Potter seemed disinclined to elaborate. “Besides,” he shrugged, “I made my peace with his passing a long while back, and so did he.” He fixed Draco with a hard look. “So you’re not going to get me to hate you, no matter how hard you work at it.”

“The whole point was so we wouldn’t be underfoot with each other!” Harry sighed, ducking to avoid getting clipped in the head by a hefty bedside table arrowing for the attic.
“Don’t worry,” Potter groused, one eye pinned to Draco at all times, as if fearful he might suddenly find himself swooped upon otherwise. He carefully fit his little scroll of parchment to the Barred Owl’s leg, which it tolerated with a sleepy blink. “I won’t be demanding your ‘services’ again.” Draco gave a rough, rasping hiss that came out in a stutter reminiscent of chuckling laughter. “Dunno how you could be expected to fly anyhow with that stick up your arse.” He stopped laughing.

“Haven’t got roommates.”

Potter gave him a funny look, like he thought this was a trick question. Maybe it was. “To help me study, obviously. Think we’ve done this enough times you can tell I need all the help I can get.”
Father taught me that so…”
When weekends came where there were no Interhouse Quidditch games, Potter took to the empty pitch to join his friends in pick-up games of their own, straddling the handsome new Nimbus 2020 Draco had graciously customised for him. Bored without fresh post to snoop through or new owl treat flavours to sample, Draco would perch atop the empty Slytherin stands to take in these more casual games, the owl’s eyesight better than even the finest pair of Omnioculars.
Harry, however, hissed brightly, fisting the duvet as he huffed out a string of Muggle and wizarding oaths. “Now
thing a duelling coach ought to teach a student is to always be on their guard. You’d have been better off
-tying, Potter finally seemed satisfied with the job, placing three owl treats down on the knot, perhaps as a down-payment, and instructing, “It’s for Quality Quidditch Supplies, all right? It needs to get to them before closing, if at all possible. I know it’s a long trek—” Draco barely managed to stifle a squawk; how the fuck was he meant to get to bloody
“Not strictly, no. Our personalities tend to clash. Oil and water and all that.”
“Not without cheating, no, if we’re being honest. And I won my last duel against someone who was
Draco’s body seized, going stiff as a board, and try as he might to wrestle his muscles back under conscious control, Potter’s spell held fast. From the corner of his eye, he could see Potter approaching, squinting to make out his attacker in the dim lamplight. He held himself with a wary caution, wand still trained on Draco, and it was only when he’d gotten within a few feet—good
side by side—back across the front lawn, making their way to the front entrance. Students were milling around outside now, with no few casting wary, wondering glances their way, but Draco tried to keep his head up and not notice. Potter seemed to have no difficulty doing the same. Draco wondered if he genuinely
Draco.
The Dark Mark was still a nasty blotch on his skin, and Draco had to turn away from it. He’d stared at it enough over the summer holidays; he knew what it looked like. Thomassen reached over the desk and grabbed his wrist to tug him closer, studying the Mark with a frown before releasing Draco and leaning back again.
He’d spent so long seeking attention, now that Potter was offering it so sweetly, so casually, it was overwhelming.
By the time Potter arrived at the pitch, Draco had already taken his usual position perched on the railing at the front of one of the Slytherin stands. He was making no attempt at stealth, but this distance from where Potter and his friends were discussing the terms of the morning’s game down in the centre of the pitch, he doubted he’d be spotted too quickly.
to be a Death Eater, you fucking dolt.”
Potter slouched in his chair, just as creaky and threatening to collapse under his weight as Draco’s, and crossed his arms over his chest. “…Was just a thought. I’m not stupid.”
solutely not! Why on earth would you think such a thing?” He could hear the heat in her voice, and it was touching—they might’ve made a fine pair if he’d at all been enamoured of female favours and if she hadn’t been so devoted to throwing off the shackles of tradition.
Potter’s brows quirked as if they had a life of their own. “Weasleys’ Roasted Dragon Nuts.” Draco took a close look at the branding on the side of the bag, which clearly said

Harry’s lips quirked up on one side. “You won’t die for me, but you’ll kill for me?”
, and he absolutely didn’t want to share them with Potter. “I expect it shall go better now, though. All forty-eight or so hours I have left.”
“Well, seeing as our yearly shopping trip to Paris to clean out Place Cachée is, shall we say,
Despite his pitched fit, Potter managed to restore his parchment with an easily cast Mending Charm, though he kept it well out of Draco’s reach for the remainder of their time together. After gorging himself on owl treats, Draco didn’t entirely trust his flight capabilities, and he settled down on the window sill, lulled into a light doze by the soft scritching of Potter’s quill.
—everything was right with the world, so of course his morning was about to go to shit.
The next morning, Draco trudged back up to the Owlery, the Snitch safe and secure in his pocket. He gave a silent nod to Xerxes, who after a steady diet of treats from Draco’s hand had learned he was to accept no more letters or parcels from Potter, and quickly and quietly assumed his owl form. The Snitch in talon, he winged his way around to the Great Hall, slipping through the skylight along with the other owls making their morning deliveries to the students feasting below, and dropped the Snitch directly over Potter’s head.
(See the end of the chapter for
He threw an arm over his eyes. “…I never picked a side. I picked my family, and I did all I could to help myself and to help them, but that’s hardly the same. For all their sanctimony, at least the Gryffindors stood up for what they believed in. And even the Dark Lord’s most faithful

was his answer, right there. “Because we don’t get on,” he said instead, because simpler was always better with Potter.
, with several phrases throughout the text scripted in by hand. “‘I, [Harry James Potter], do hereby take on sole responsibility for the actions—including damage to persons or property—of my [Dragon / sp. Antipodean Opaleye], forthwith, on this the [21st of June, 1998]. I understand that, should I fail to maintain sound control of this animal, which I have been made aware is a Class [5] Dangerous Creature, all legal repercussions will be borne by—’” Harry shook his head, baffled. “I’m sorry,
so much furniture missing from your room…? How are you going to explain to them that you’re…you know?”
“I’ll be here if you need me, babe” Harry said and kissed him. He was surprised and grateful for Harry’s sensibility one more time. He needed to see his father on his own. He knew he would break and Harry would be there to hold him, but he had to be there for his mother first.
It had been almost two weeks since the last time he had dinner with his family. The Weasleys hosted a meeting every Sunday, but Harry had had to miss it because of his new shifts schedule at the muggle hospital. That’s probably why they have decided to do it on a Wednesday this time.
“Mr. Potter?” he asked.
“Not really” she sipped her tea calmly.
“Yes, apparently they would love to have you teach them something about wand-making” Harry was trying to tease Draco with his tone, but he was actually proud of his partner and happy for him. It must feel good to be admired after so long in the shadows, even if it was away from home “I’m aloud to go as your healer, since you need regular treatment” he added.
Six more chapters up!! I hope you are enjoying the story so far. I know these last chapters are a bit messy so if you have any questions I'll be glad to answer them in the comments.
“Here we are” he said while turning off the bike and hating the moment Draco’s body got away from his. He had spent the night with the blond in his arms, it should have been enough, but no, he kept looking for contact, craving for it.
“I’m so sorry, Draco. I got to distracted and lost track of time”
“Excuse me?”
“I am” his throat must have been sore since his voice cracked and he took another sip of water “My name is Alexei Nik…” he doubted for a way too long second. Curiosity, almost anxiety, was building inside Harry as he waited “Alexei Nikolayevich Romanov”
“Such manners. Your mother wrote to me last night. Harry here was feeding me up on your condition”
The library.
“Of course. The magic here needs to know you are wizards, it would not allow you in otherwise”
“I’m your healer, idiot. Of course I’m worried”
“Well, I have been thinking…”
“I’m sorry about earlier, by the way” Draco murmured.
His mother was smoking, like always.
“I’ll behave; I swear” he wasn’t entirely sure he could keep his word but he would try. Potter was a professional and he needed his services, that was it, nothing more, absolutely nothing.
“I know that, Potter” Harry hid a laugh and continued with the next book; he couldn’t even read the title in the worn cover. He had to turn the pages magically so he wouldn’t damage the document and read them with extra attention since the ink was faded, but he had the feeling this was not going to be of any help either “Who the hell is Tom Riddle?” Harry stopped mid-movement and stared at the blond in shock.
He wasn’t much taller, but remarkably bigger. The once thin, pale, ill-looking boy was now all broad shoulders and tan skin, impossibly green eyes behind a pair of way more modern glasses and the same messy, black hair. Time was a tricky thing: he was getting sick and Potter looked actually decent.
“It’s okay little prince, it’s just a treat” his mother assured him when she saw him frowning.
“I have not” he answered, ashamed. He was a grown man, for Merlin’s sake, he could not still be afraid of his mother’s rage.
“I don’t. But I feel like I should” the dark-haired wizard, who kept running his hand through his hair, sat by his side in the mattress “I had a nightmare. I think I know what Alexei meant by his family being…” he swallowed hard “If what I saw has something to do with the reality, I know why he felt so distressed. Harry it was horrible”
“Granger? Why? I mean, I’m sure she knows almost everything that’s ever been written, but you sound awfully confident” the healer was doing spells and changing his bandages.
He had to hurry.
“Harry” he called softly. He wouldn’t want to wake him if he was asleep.
Harry picked his own from the floor but after a couple more pages, he discarded it too. He stood up and decided he had to stretch his legs, urgently, so he searched his pockets until he found his cigarette’s case.
Draco woke up to something warm holding him. He was in his bed and he could feel the pain all over his body, but refused to open his eyes to know why. Images of yesterday’s afternoon flooded his mind. He had been working and then everything exploded. He had seen Potter, or maybe he had dreamed about it. It made sense, though. Everything made sense, specially the warm body against his own. He opened his eyes slightly, the light bothered him, but he managed to focus. He was laying on his side, cuddled up against Harry’s abdomen. The dark-haired wizard was sat, holding him with his head rested in the wall behind him, eyes closed.
By the time Harry pulled away, taking Draco’s ability to think with him, the blond had no idea what had they been talking about, nor did he care.
“Yes, he just passed out from a spell” he lied. It was better than the alternative.
“Have you been sighing and whispering my name while you work? Or was just basic complain about how annoying I used to be?” the golden boy was definitely ashamed.
“No, I think I have everything I need. Shall we go back?” he stood up and piled up the books with the intention of returning them, but an assistant, a young boy with freckles, took them from him, earning himself a smile from Draco.
“I know. Take your time to think over it, I’ve had mine. I’ll be in your guest’s room until is time for your treatment. Let me know if you need anything” Harry stood up and grabbing his stuff, made his way out of Draco’s bedroom.
Hermione was talking excitedly with Fleur and Molly with a huge smile on her face, she was almost shining. Ten minutes later, Andromeda wished them good night and left, reminding Harry to drop Teddy or call her if he needed to work. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley followed her in no time and Bill and Fleur were right behind.
Draco was debating between opening the veil and going back when he heard a voice. A female voice…no, a male voice. Familiar and unknown, soft and cold, alluring and revulsive. Draco had never heard something like that and yet he was sure he had spoken with it before.
“Very well. I’m afraid we only have available rooms in the
“I’m serious”
Draco was tempted to look for Harry, but he didn’t want to bother him more than he already had. Last night, when he had proposed they talked to Alexei, Harry had seemed reluctant, but when he had suggested to go to Russia to try to find something that could help the boy, Harry had exploded. Draco had never seen him like that. He knew it was dangerous, and that it was some crazy, risky idea; they were looking blindly for some reminiscence of a dark wizard and Harry had had enough of that already, all of them had. He knew that his health was not the best and that being near Alexei’s past could worsen the situation, but they were stuck, they had no more information and they were definitely not going to solve the problem by staying home drinking potions and reading history books.
He straightened a bit in the bed, facing the man who, seeing his expression, stopped the movie and shifted to look at him directly.
“Oh, Draco” she went straight to hug him “Thank Merlin you’re back. Are you okay? You look healthier, dear. Are you healed already?” she had been crying a lot lately. He could tell. He nodded towards the healer and hugged her back.
No, Prince was Harry’s pet name for him. Prince, or babe when they were alone. Never honey.
He stroked his newly cut hair and his beautiful face. He felt so guilty, he should have known it would be too much for him, he should have been prepared in case anything happened, he should have reacted sooner. Harry should have done many things but he was just worrying. He had never been more concerned in his entire life; not even when Hermione had had Rose; he had been prepared for that, he had made sure they were okay. He would even choose to go to Voldemort and die ten times more than going through this. That had been his decision, he was the only one who could get hurt and he had gone knowing what to expect.
“I thought Gryffindors were known for their bravery”
The former salon on the second floor was now his studio and there were two more bathrooms, for his guest’s comfort in the third floor; which was entirely for visits, including Teddy’s playroom, since the boy’s actual bedroom was in Regulus old chambers, next to his.
The squawk alerted Harry, but he wasn’t expecting the size of the damn bird when he turned to where Draco was looking at.
Aside from that it was actually a very nice room. It was big, really big, so Draco assumed it was a suit, even if it was a normal one like Harry had requested. It had a sitting area, a fireplace, a mini-bar, a huge bedroom and an even bigger bathroom with a hot and cold bath.
Once completely nude he added some salts and the water turned a soft blue color while the room filled with levitating bubbles that exploded into steam shapes, and finally, he went in. The hot water relaxed his muscles and the smell numbed his mind. Draco hugged his legs and rested his chin on his knees, letting the salts and fumes do their work.
What?!
“I’m good, it’s almost ready. Have some wine” the girl moved automatically around the kitchen and opened the small door to the bodega, getting a bottle and serving the two of them. “So, what have you been up to?”
“Bon appètit” Harry raised his glass in answer and started to eat, enjoying particularly the texture of the pastry, which made the Wellington one of his favorites. He was going to put his second fork-full into his mouth when a moan, that couldn’t possibly be coming from Draco, sounded next to him. He turned to find the wizard with his eyes closed and a hand covering his lips “Are you okay?” the other nodded but said nothing. Harry started to think he had imagined it when it happened again “Draco?”
Harry woke up too early that morning. They were taking a portkey to Russia that afternoon and he was already too excited or too nervous. The room was still dark and he wanted to fall back asleep, but he knew his body, and that was really improbable.
“Merlin, that elf knows you so well” he managed to say, breathless and Harry narrowed his eyes.
“Who are you?” Harry asked, once alone with the blond.
It was way smaller than the one in the Ministry of Magic but it had the same vicious vibe. A forgotten, doubtful place, full of things that someone said once and that could be or not be true. Blue and black orbs that contained the fate of someone who hadn’t asked to be prophesied, to be bound to a certain fate, like him. It made him instantly sick.
“Why? It was not his time. Why would you take him? Haven’t you taken enough from me already?” he screamed. He could feel his magic trembling under his skin, ready to explode and cause havoc.
Maybe there was an ulterior lesson he needed to learn out of that, something about taking nothing for granted or not giving up hope just because something seems difficult, but he had parked his hopeless positivism on a corner, next to his mother’s letter and his mind was focused on the proof in front of his eyes. It was a challenge to his brain, an attack on everything he had ever studied and that was not fair. He had had already enough to worry about for the next two lives and here he was, losing the balance on the only solid ground he knew: his work.
“If you really believed for a second that I was going to stay out just because you asked, you are more clueless than I thought”
he put it to his right and grabbed another one.
His body? No, not his body. His soul? No, that made no sense. What was he looking for again? Oh, yes, the library, answers, his boyfriend…
Yeah, he could definitely not do that.
“Your vessel? I had Alexei’s soul with me. Not yours” Draco answered, puzzled.
While the coffee brewed, the water boiled for Draco’s tea and the oven ended up the baking Harry picked up the cigarette package from the cabinet and took one out, but stopped himself before lighting it up. The addiction had come back, unfortunately, but he was set on abandoning it again. He didn’t need it. He was happy.
He was standing in the middle of nothing right now. Just a foggy, empty meadow. His sister was there. Same white dress, same ribbons, same messy hair, same smile.
“Excuse me?”
“I’m starting to think that we are all mixed in the same potion here” it was more like a feeling, an instinct, but Draco knew something was missing in all their equations “I think they are more connected than we think”
“Now you’re going to say to me that he tells you who he is dating or how much he pays for peaches in the market”
He was tempted to play with his wand and make forms out of the water, like he usually did, but he had been afraid to use it since the accident.
“It’s good to see you again, Molly. I hope Arthur is taking good care of you” it was Lucius who broke the silence. He had probably forgotten every bitter moment between them, but at the time, it was a blessing, as everyone managed to breathe again when Molly answered.
“Let’s get started”
“Should I dress the table or this a casual date?” Draco asked seductively, although, probably joking. Harry blushed anyway.
“Good afternoon, sleepy head” her mother greeted when she saw him.
“I’d love some breakfast, mom”
He turned off the sauce and went to clean the stuff he had used but Kreacher got in the middle, alarmed.
Harry laughed softly, and when he managed to relax, Draco found himself enjoying the experience of being forced to hug his healer that way.
“Mom, I’m fine, please, stop worrying so much”
“What about a bath, Mr. Potter?” he asked Harry while unbuttoning his shirt, flashing him a seductive grin. Harry swallowed hard. He looked as if he was about to refuse, so Draco insisted “Come on, I won’t eat you. It’s just a bath” he winked an eye and Harry sighed.
“I don’t want to hurt you” Draco had rolled his eyes, but smiled tenderly.
“Bullshit, he was watching the game” he whispered in Draco’s ear and they both laughed.
“That’s an understatement” Malfoy joked “But it was not your fault” he seemed conflicted about what he was going to say, but he swallowed hard and spoke “I tend to have panic attacks. I have since I was in school” he was not looking at Harry, but he could guess what the blond meant.
“Never mind, Harry. It’s just a portkey” he had said. But it was not just that. They still couldn’t trust Draco and that bothered Harry to no end.
“Dinner’s ready!” George shouted and they all gathered around the table. Their host was terrible at desserts, but he did great work with almost everything else. Out of all of the brothers, George was the one who had embraced his mother’s skills the most.
He was certain they had had a moment at dinner, interrupted by Harry. They had gone to his studio, where Regulus had asked them why they looked so flushed.
“Here, let me” Draco’s hands were shaking too, but he knew Harry was in a way worst condition than him.
“Potter?” he asked in an accusatory way.
“Tom Riddle. It says here he is the last of the Slytherin line. He doesn’t have a death date, so he must be alive, right? The thing is, it sounds familiar” oh, God. This was not a conversation Harry expected to have ever again.
“Too much wine” Potter had answered. From then on it was all very foggy. He had the vaguest memory of being studying something about the Romanov family from another book that approached every royalty in history, but that had very little information on the Russians since none of them had had any magical qualities. Same problem over and over again.
“Bed was not warm enough without you” he started kissing Harry’s neck and ended up biting his chin.
“Good morning. Glad to see you got some sleep” he made the move to stand up.
“Exactly. I can’t have you losing your head for me, the wizarding community would never forgive me” Harry laughed. Draco looked much better and was actually walking with a minimal limping.
“Coming” he walked, slowly, holding his side and containing the pain. Harry had given him a potion for the stiffness but it had worn out a couple hours ago and he had had no intention of standing up to get another dose or to do anything, for that matter.
“Merlin’s bollocks, Potter. What have you done?” Harry had had the indecency of laughing.
“This could be logical if we were speaking of you or even Rasputin, as he is the only wizard we know to be around the boy, but you are linked to Alexei, not him”
A couple minutes later the wizard arrived, followed by three stacks of books that he dropped on the table by their side.
“Well, I’ll leave you too to catch up so I can go home and shower myself. I also need to ask for the night free at the hospital. I’ll see you in an hour or two” Harry picked his stuff and gave Blaise a handshake.
When his eyes focused on the environment, Draco asked himself why he had not explored the house before. He encountered a wide space with wood floors and glass railings, a small pool or Jacuzzi, a bunch of beautiful flowerpots and a relaxing area with a wicker chestlong sofa and a couple matching chairs covered by a floating canopy. Harry was resting on his elbows, looking at the London view from the railings, the black pendant between his fingers.
“It’s okay, I needed the time to think, anyway. I just came to let you know lunch is ready” Harry looked surprised, but understanding washed over his expression quickly and he followed Draco.
“Yes, he is very professional and I don’t think he knows who your father is, if that is your concern. Anyway, I can’t promise he will get better, babe, and I don’t want you to get disappointed if he doesn’t” Draco nodded “I will try to help him too as soon as we get back, but you should write to your mother to inform her that he will contact her in case he accepts the case” the blond smiled.
“I did see. I was there too.”
Wentsworth had been, predictably, delighted to learn Draco was planning on taking his N.E.W.T.s and filled Draco’s arms with pamphlets for all sorts of career paths, urging him to reconsider Wentsworth’s previous offer to set him up with Administration Services—
. Seriously, what did you cast?”
Draco brought his fingers up to his neck, absently fumbling at his own tie, and nodded.
And now, Draco recalled that Potter had at one point had his own owl. A lovely Snowy Owl that had swooped into the Great Hall bearing fantastic gifts he shouldn’t have been allowed. What had happened to it that Potter was resorting to using school owls or borrowing friends’ birds to deliver his post? Had it died, then? He certainly spoke of it as if it were a dearly departed loved one.
“Draco—darling, what
“Yeah, he…does that sometimes. I think he’s got digestion issues.”

With Andromeda returned, Potter excused them to return to the Burrow just in time for dinner. Weasley refused to leave Potter’s side once they got back, insistent they listen to a Cannons game on the Wireless together. Why someone who claimed to be a fan of the team would want to listen to them being soundly trounced in real time was beyond Draco, but Weasley was an odd duck who perhaps got off on humiliation. It would certainly explain a fair few things.

Draco looked at him like he might be just a bit mad, raking him with a dubious gaze. “…I’m sorry?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Please, it’s nothing I haven’t seen before.”
Weasley frowned up at Potter from his seat on the sofa, a copy of
The top fell away, and Harry frowned. “It’s…a miniature broom?” He removed the little figure from the box, palming it.

or burying their noses in Horcrux and Founders research. Strange, but not bad. It just left Harry a bit tilted, the rapidity with which their adventure had come to an end, leaving them now trying to navigate the matter of calm, quiet domesticity, a concept with which neither of them was particularly familiar nor well-suited.
“Meaning I’ve already been staying elsewhere and am on my way home.”

Weasley didn’t bother waiting to learn how he ought to address Draco, though, instead just walking right over and reaching up, beanpole that he was, to try and pet him. Delighted at the audacity, Draco gave him a warning hiss, then nipped with intent to remove a finger—but Weasley jerked his hand back with a yelp, and that was almost as satisfying.
When Draco stepped out, skin warm and pink and hair darkened to straw-gold with moisture, Harry was practically bouncing on his heels, shoving him towards the wardrobe in Regulus’s room and reminding him to dress down.
“Then who did it?”

Harry gave him a shove, laughing brightly, and stepped around him and out into the fresh air. “We’re going to be missed. I don’t want to get caught by McGonagall with my trousers down when we’re meant to be helping out,” he said, largely to keep his mind from supplying helpful images to get him in the mood.
There were also apprenticeships to consider as well—work-studies and internships and everything in between. There would be a
So he did not say anything stupid like
Potter tapped his chin, thinking. “…Pretty sure Neville’s working there some evenings for his thesis, but I can ask after his schedule, find out which days he won’t be there. And if I run it past Sprout, we won’t be disturbed at least.” He nodded. “Yeah. Yeah, that could be good.” He gave Draco a superior look. “See? Now was that so hard?”
of it, not before breakfast at least.
Again, no elaboration. “
The Daily Prophet
Thomassen cocked his head a tick to the side. “You don’t get on with him?”
He was clearly not getting back to his nap so long as this interloper was hanging around, so he spread his wings and leapt from the tower, gliding around the property until he found his bedroom window, reluctantly left open on days he roosted in the belfry. His mother had complained about a draught, but he’d only told her to stoke the fires higher, in no mood to explain why he was whiling away his winter break in quiet solitude underneath a layer of feathers and down.
a challenge. “Take as many as you like—I’ll be back for the pouch tomorrow, if that’s all right.” Draco ignored him, already visually picking over the treats he could spot nearest the lip of the pouch and trying to decide which he would sample first. “Er…if you could, though, please don’t…you know. Don’t shit in it or anything, please.”

“What?”
He reached for the box, slowly so as not to spook, and took one of the rings for himself, holding out the other for Draco.

“Listen, if you aren’t going to punch me or curse me or write a tell-all and send it to the
Draco paused, looking him over. Potter was an utter chore to interact with, but for whatever reason, Draco felt compelled to defend himself, so interact they must. He recalled Pansy’s words, her firm conviction—though he knew she’d been defending herself and her own actions in the war as much as Draco. Still, he agreed with her, took strength in her cool logic. He sniffed, reminding himself not to sneer. It put Potter on the defensive and made him even more difficult than usual. “…I’m not a coward.”
“What?” Thomassen laughed. “Oh,
Potter’s shoulders relaxed a tick, though Draco kept him pinned with one eye—he liked fucking with Potter more than he liked these owl treats, and forced to choose between the treats and giving Potter another scar to go with the one he’d earned from the Dark Lord, he’d go for the latter every time.
He sighed. “Fine, if you
“I might just,” Potter said, too nonchalant once again. “But I might

He didn’t want to seem a coward, but that wasn’t happening. “…That’s quite possibly one of your
“Oh indeed. I probably know more about that stuff than you, actually.” The wry smile twisted tighter, curling in on itself. “But we in Stealth and Tracking tend to operate on a somewhat looser scale of morality than our friends on the front lines. So like I said, you’d be a decent fit.” He nodded. “We’d have to work on your team integration, probably”—Oh yes, because a bunch of seasoned Aurors were just going to
these days. Potter nodded again, smile gone a little soft around the edges now. “…Yeah, loyalty’s a good quality.” He raised a finger. “But you need more than family watching your back sometimes. I mean, I love Teddy, and I’d do almost anything for him—but I can’t exactly trust a six-month-old to help me take down Dark wizards, now can I?”
“Yes, we Malfoy men tend to look alike.” Draco replied.
Draco headed into his study. “Why not? On paper, you’re probably a much preferable option to whomever my Grandfather arranged for me.”
Draco looked warily at his grandfather. “Yes?”
“Is there some reason you two have separate bedrooms?” Pansy asked innocently.
“ Just this once.” Harry clasped his hands together. “Thank you.”
“I like it when you’re honest.” He rolled his hips, pushing Harry’s shirt up farther. There was a sharp knock at the door. “Apparently, I’m just not suppose to have you at all today.”
“Absolutely.” Draco smiled.
“And he isn’t going out of his way to work on your cases?”
Heading towards his own room, he shed his outer robes and headed towards the bathroom. Turning on the shower, he waited for the water to warm up. The night had been successful. He was sure that the public would eat up the farce that they were a happily married couple. The honeysuckle and lily-of-the-valley his mother had weaved into Harry’s wedding laurels were ideal, playing up his innocence and sweet nature. The dance had been perfect, the dip at the end and Harry’s flushed face would play well in the tabloids and the
“Hey, hey, hey…” Harry leaned in, running his hands up and down Draco’s arms. “I’m right here. I’m right here in front of you. I’m here in our flat. I used your shampoo. I’m wearing your clothes, you’d hate that. I’m here. I’m very much alive.”
Draco nodded. “In the liquor cabinet in the front room…”
“What do you want, Pansy?” He asked, slumping in the tub
“Vaguely…” Harry replied. “Everything is very vague during that time of my life.”
“I’m serious, Draco.”
Draco looked up from his paperwork and leveled his gaze at Harry. “He told me to take a few days and enjoy my new husband.”
“Would you like to make love to me?”
“You want to stay married?”
Rays of the sun shown brightly through the bed hangings around Draco’s bed. He awoke to find himself alone, Harry’s side of the bed cold and the sounds of the shower running. He stretched, enjoying the delicious soreness that accompanied it and slid out of bed. Catching sight of himself in the large mirror that hung next to his wardrobe, he ran his hands along the scars that
“Just got in.” Draco lifted the plate. “Thank you for dinner.”
Draco sighed. "It's because he's afraid I'm going to leave him."
Draco captured Harry’s head in his hands. “Blow in my face, Harry.” The dark-haired wizard blew lightly in his face. “Coriander, fuck… Did anyone give you a pink drink tonight?”
“Yes.” Draco said shortly.
“What was the state of the body, Mister Malfoy?”
“Yes, and I’ve already been thoroughly hazed for it.” Draco snapped his folder close. “Look, Granger, I have a full docket today—”
Draco pinched the bridge of his nose. “Only if we consummated the marriage.”
Harry ran the soap over Draco’s back. “I said technically, I don’t know where two of them are at present. Rinse.”
“But, you are quite official according to the Ministry.” Poppy stood, coming out from behind the desk. “What with having an Order of Merlin, and all. I don’t think I can get in trouble if I make an exception just this once.”
“Yes, he is.” Draco replied, opening a cabinet containing a record player. “And a fucking talented one.” He held out his hand to Harry. “
“Why haven’t I seen this before?” Draco gestured to the outfit.
Harry sighed as he pushed open the door to the Lilly Foundation offices. The light blue-grey walls were still plastered with photos of
Harry accepted the glass. “It’s not your fault.”
“Yes, Mother.” Draco replied.
"Ouch." It seemed to be the only reply Draco could muster. "What about you, Hermione?"
Harry sighed. “I promise I’ll visit Teddy.”
“Yes, you are.”
“No.” Harry replied. “It’s really nothing. We were just drunk, that’s all.I promise.”
“Again, you look fine.” He stared down at his pocket watch. “Stop fussing, our Portkey activates in two minutes.” Draco pulled Harry close, producing a silver spoon. “Remember, we are disgustingly in love.”
Harry smiled. “Because I am a descendant of the Peverells. Ignotus to be exact.”
“And proud of you.” Furey smiled wistfully. “I can’t tell you how many times I saw photos of your as a baby.”
. You of all people should understand that he isn’t punishing you.”
Harry shrugged. “When you’ve had a homicidal maniac chase you across Europe for most of your life, getting drugged in a pub is fairly low on the totem pole of what I consider dangerous.” Draco raised an eyebrow and Harry rolled his eyes again. “Would it let your solicitor brain rest if I let you look into this?”
“No, no…
“No spells.” Harry pressed a finger to Draco’s lips. “Just you.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “You stayed the night.”
“Kearns, Troughton, Scannell, Molyneux, Woulfe and Furey.” Ron replied. “One for each of you, they’ll rotate eight hour shifts. We’ll let you know if they are pulled out of the rotation.”
“Okay, fine...” Draco stood, picking up the plate and his attaché case. “I just want you to know that I would never hurt you like that on purpose. Intoxicated or not. As much as you think that I don’t care about you, I am concerned for your personal wellbeing.” He strode from the living room, the door to his office snapping shut.
“Mistress Narcissa, Master Draco and his guest have arrived. Shall I show them to the dining hall?”
“It’s not impossible.” Draco snapped. “You’re too good for it to be impossible.”
Harry tangled his fingers into Draco’s platinum locks, rolling his hips, driving the blonde deeper inside him. Draco growled, flipping Harry onto back again. He paused, grey eyes staring down at green ones. Harry pulled him down for a kiss.
Draco narrowed his gaze at Harry. “What does that mean?”
“I enjoy long baths.” Draco turned his gray eyes on Harry. “I was so afraid it was really you.”
“Shocking, isn’t it?” Harry smiled. “I think I might actually like you.”
“Fine.” Draco pressed a kiss to Harry’s forehead. “I’ll take the compliment. We should get going though, Mother is expecting us at six.”
Lydia pursed her lips. “There are a finite number of good looking wizards in this world, forgive your majority female staff for wanting to appreciate an excellent specimen.”
“No, Mipsy, bring them here.” Narcissa instructed. “And tell them to be quick about it.”
“H-how long?”
Draco pulled Harry into his arms. “
“I asked Harry to.” Draco replied. “I know that you all aren’t entirely fond of me or my family and I didn’t want our budding relationship to affect his relationship with all of you.”
“Well, look what the cat’s dragged in.”
Draco pressed his forehead to Harry’s. “
“Then there should be no issue with this marriage. Remember who I am, Lord Malfoy.” Harry lifted his chin. “I am Harry James Potter, Order of Merlin; First Class. Destroyer of the Dark Lord. I believe my social and financial standings make me a worthy candidate for your grandson.” Harry lifted his chin slightly. “And I love him. As unorthodox as we may be, I care a great deal for Draco. I have for a long time.”
Ron nodded. "
“Of course.” Harry smiled. “Sorry it’s just curry.”
“Goldschläger?”
“Oh...” Harry frowned. “I see…”
Marc set the photo back down. "That's your prerogative." He leaned against Draco's desk. "It's not like you can file anything anyway. Most of the clerks have gone home for the holiday."
“Wizengamot, ma’am.” Draco supplied.
Harry sighed. “Are you done?”
Master of Death.”
“Oh, Merlin…” Draco put his head in hands. “Not Thursday. I’m too old and too busy for Thursday.”
“To say that you were right,” Pansy quipped. “I make the impossible possible.”
Harry gasped, feeling himself be stretched once again by the magic. “Another one?”
“So, you are a homosexual.” Harry smirked.
“Thank you, I think…” Harry muttered, snatching another flute of champagne and downing it quickly.
“But I want you to remember that this goes both ways.” He tucked a lock of hair behind Harry’s ear. “You don’t have to hide your scary boxes from me.”
“Years
"Mum says it's the best way." Ron replied, munching on a biscuit. "You tend to have healthier babies if you don't know."
Ron quirked an eyebrow. “I thought the Malfoys were wealthy.”
A deep blush spread across Harry's face. "That was a tad inappropriate for normal conversation, Drake."
“To be fair, you were also, probably, three sheets to the wind.”
“I swear to Merlin, Potter, if you’ve vomited on that carpet…” Draco pushed the door open to find Harry on the floor in a tangle of sheets. His face was flushed and his breathing was labored. “Merlin, what happened?”
Draco strode from the bathroom, completely dressed. “I suppose that’s true. You can be very distracting.”
“Pleasure is all mine, Mister Potter.” The man with strawberry-blonde hair smiled. “Ruairi Kearns, sir. This is Oliver Furey.”
“I suppose only the people who can get close enough to see them.” Harry scrubbed the blood from his hands. “Even I don’t notice them and they’re on my face.”
Draco smirked, snapping his hips forward.
Harry rolled to face
“Oh, well then, I must absolutely make it for my charming husband.” He slipped his arms around Draco’s waist. “I’ll stop at the grocers on my way back from the Foundation office.”
“Harry, you
Harry blushed. “I just didn’t think the way he was talking to Draco was fair.”
. Not to mention all the Snake Bites Parkinson was pouring down your throat…”
"Just a healthy baby?" Harry asked, turning his attention away from Rose.
Hermione glowered at Ron. "A bit on the
Kearns nodded. “Definitely. You might look like a carbon copy of your father at first glance, but you are mot certainly your mother’s son.” He crossed his arms. “I bet when he’s angry with you, he tilts his head to the side, glares, and presses his lips into a thin line.”
Ron cleared his throat. “Sorry to bother you, but I wanted to introduce you to Kearns and Furey. They’ll be taking the daylight shifts, so they’ll be the ones out and about with you.”
Harry blinked owlishly at the blonde. “Seriously?”
Draco shook his head. "No, no. I don't want you to come like this."
Draco’s grin turned predatory. “Wonderful.”
“I’ll make sure he does.” Draco replied.
“I never liked him.” Hermione said quietly. “He reminded me of you. Arrogant, narcissistic, thought everyone should bow before him…”
“Devon is giving me four weeks of paid holiday.” He lamented.
“Because it’s made with cinnamon schnapps and
Narcissa lead the two young men down a series of confusing corridors. She led them into large study and shut the doors behind them. Draco’s grandfather sat behind a large mahogany desk. He looked stern, eyebrows knitted as he shifted through the papers on the desk. He looked like a much angrier version of Draco’s father, Lucius. His shock white hair was tied at the nape of his neck, a small pair of wireframe glasses perched on the end of his nose. He did not give them any attention when they stood in front of the desk. Harry looked nervously at Draco, as if he was asking if they should say something. Draco stifly shook his head. Draco’s grandfather gathered the papers neatly and placed them in a file folder and set them to the side of the desk. He looked up at the two boys, spending extra time sizing Harry up.
“You most certainly were.” Draco said matter-of-factly. “You were kneeling on a barstool, slurring your way through
“Fitted?” Draco offered. “It’s supposed to be that way. Just like that Burberry suit of yours.”
““Like Blaise said, Bambi-eyes. His smart mouth.” Draco pulled the dark-haired wizard close. “And that lithe body of his. He’s very flexible.”
Draco breathed, nuzzling his nose into Harry’s thick black hair. “
Flopping down at his desk, he set to work on the files he’d brought home from the office.
“Then you own a Deathly Hallow.”
Draco raised a brow. “They’re all senior Aurors.”
“I am also aware of that as well.”
“Yes, yes you will.” She practically skipped back to her desk.
"So that outfit," Draco trailed his fingers down Harry's chest. "Where did you get it?"
Harry smirked, tucking his head under Draco’s chin. “I’m quite tired of seeing photos of myself in
“Every Brit should have a healthy appreciation for Coldplay, Elton John, and Billy Joel.” Draco replied, sliding out of bed.
’ falling from his lips.
“Well, Grandfather wasn’t exactly approving of it either…” Draco sipped his champagne.
Harry chuckled. “Are you going to do something about it, Mister Malfoy?”
Draco “It wasn’t just my testimony that got you off with a slap on this wrist.”
Harry rolled away from the offending light coming in through the window. He hated how much brighter the sun seemed in the winter. His body deliciously sore from his activities the night before, he cracked any eye open to find Draco staring back at him.
“Quite honestly, he’s not all that secret about it.” Draco replied.
“No, he was in the shower when I left for the office.”
“I really should say thank you for breakfast this morning.” Draco rose from his desk.
Harry's breathing became shallow. "Say it again." He stepped closer to Draco. "Please, say it again."
“Doesn’t mean you aren’t sore.” Draco sighed.
“I-it’s not m-mine.”
Harry smiled as Poppy walked back to her desk. Once he was sure she was gone, he shot towards the stack with the most recent year date. He quickly scanned the February section and found exactly what he was looking for. He stared down at the certificate, his drunken mistake fully confirmed.
“I run a foundation and I’m independently wealthy.” Harry smiled. “I don’t necessarily ‘do work’ as you eloquently described.”
“What?” Blaise shrugged. “We’ve all thought about it. You’ve got Bambi-eyes, Potter. Slytherins are a sucker for anyone with Bambi-eyes. They’re always so innocent and we love to devour that.” Harry flushed scarlet. “It’s a serious compliment, Slytherin to Gryffindor.”
“Much too cultured.” Harry sighed dramatically. “But I shall solider on, for the good of the people.”
“He looks just like your father.” Harry breathed.
“I did this to you.” He set the plate down on the table. “I’ve hurt you.”
“Quent—” Ron groaned.
Draco feigned a gasp. “Don’t let your family know. I’m beginning to suspect they all think I’ve put you under some sort of Love Spell.”
Harry shrugged. “A while.”
Hermione sucked in a breath. "Full given name, someone's in trouble..."
“Because telling your grandfather that we got black-out drunk and then got married on a whim doesn’t seem like a stellar idea.”
Harry held up a hand. “No need, I will be fine, I just need to sleep it off. Goodnight, Malfoy.” He slipped behind the door to his room.
“First the Coldplay song and now Billy Joel?” Harry crossed his arms over his chest. “For the Ice Prince of Purebloods, you sure know a lot of Muggle musicians.”
“Are you ready Mister Malfoy?”
“Even after last night, as you slept in my arms, I thought I’d wake up and you wouldn’t be there.” Draco wound his arms around Harry’s middle. “Or that I’d wake up with a bloodied version of your body in my arms.”
Draco lifted his hands, turning them over and over. “You’re too good for me.”
Pansy walked briskly over to the brunette, circled him and undid the top two buttons of his shirt. “That’ll do, Potter. That will do.”
Draco smirked. “He does…”
.eleven.
“You are more than welcome Mister Potter.” Poppy smiled cheerily. “I’ll be at my desk if you need anything.”
“Well, perhaps my grandfather.” Draco said absently. “He wasn’t all that thrilled with the fact that I had married Harry instead of fulfilling the betrothal contract with the Greengrass family.”
“Probably. Would you like a towel?”
“Tea? Tea is the answer?”
Quentin glanced between Harry and Draco. “Then you and Mister Potter are bonded, as well as married?”
"Don't be, it's a good sore."
Harry suddenly sat up. “That’s it!”
“Not dirt, information.” Draco said slowly. “Information on his former relationships.”
“I would be ever so grateful.”
A slow smile crept across his lips. “Thoroughly.”
Hermione slapped him on the arm with the paper. “Shut it.”
“But you were drugged. You could have been assaulted or even killed.”
Draco chuckled. “That and I highly doubt that you would enjoy having carpet burn tomorrow. I know I wouldn’t.”
"Alright." Harry began to rolled on his stomach, only to have Draco push him back on his back.
Draco cleared his throat. “It was that of
He turned around. “Hermione!”
Harry shook his head, putting the book back in the liquor cabinet. “No, it’s not necessary.”
. It only seemed he was most interested in being seen with me rather than
“Then Granger is the only one thinks I’m legitimately in love with you.” Draco replied flippantly.
“My family will know by now.” Draco said solemnly. “We’ll have to go to my Grandfather.”
“Comfortable?”
“Er…” Draco started. “We decided to get married.”
Stepping under the hot spray, Draco’s mind wandered back to the night in the pub. The outline of Harry’s smile coming in and out of focus as he thought back to the song. The way he caught his bottom lip in his teeth. The way his chest heaved has Draco ran a hand down the center of it. How Harry’s blunt nails dug into his shoulders as he thrust deeply into him. He banged his head against the tile. Every time he tried to remember the night he and Harry got accidentally married, the only thing he could get to come back was the song in the pub and the sex they had afterword. Remembering the sex made him impossibly hard. Just holding Harry close made him feel aroused. Sighing, he washed quickly and exited the shower. Dressing quickly, he headed towards the kitchen. He poured himself a large glass of water and chugged it unceremoniously in an effort to calm himself down. Making his way back to his bedroom, he caught the sound a loud thump from Harry’s room.
“Who are you and what have you done with my husband?” He leaned in, wrapping an arm around Harry’s waist.
“Drake… D-Draco…” Harry curled his fingers around the bars of the headboard. “I can’t… I-I’m going… Uhn…”

“Of course, Narcissa.” Harry replied. “Then you will call me Harry, I am your son’s husband after all.”
“Your grandfather?”
Harry flushed scarlet. “You know what he meant by that.”
this morning…”
“You don’t belong to me.” Draco corrected.
“I know, this case has been crazy…” A slow smile creeped across his face. “Did you just admit to missing me?”
Draco rolled over, groaning. His head was pounding and every part of his body ached. He rubbed the heels of his hands into his eyes. Cracking them open he stared around at the room. It looked as if Valentine’s Day had thrown up all over the room. It was covered in pinks and purples so loud they made Draco’s head hurt even more just by looking at them. Sitting up gingerly, he let the awful colored sheets pool around his waist. There was a slight moment to his right, and he was suddenly hyper-aware that there was another individual sleeping in the bed with him. That there was another individual who was just as naked as he was, if the bare back staring back at him was any indication. Draco slid away from the sleeping figure only to have them stir. The figure moan slightly and rolled towards Draco. He sucked in a deep breath as he laid eyes upon just
