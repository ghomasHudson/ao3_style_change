As if all of them knew that the happy place they had been living in, would crumble very soon, and leave nothing more but ruins.
“Papa! Papa, it’s Harry Potter! You know, from your time at Hogwarts. Papa, you must do it! Go on, do it! You have to shake -”
“Why would she have Gillyweed in her pocket and how would she have gotten it from my potions cupboard?”
A few Slytherins, who were used to his little jabs at other people, and knew to take it as jokes, chuckled.
“What should I order at the Three Broomsticks later today?” Scorpius asked, with a mischievous smile sent Draco’s way. He snorted softly. The Prophecy Ball coloured green and purple, and then showed two words: ‘spiked Butterbeer.’
Laurentia looked around, but Cassie had put an invisibility spell around the three of them and it worked well. “Well, is there someone here?”
“Well,” Scorpius started enthusiastically, throwing an arm around Albus’s shoulders. “Let’s just hang mistletoe everywhere. Papa has admitted to liking Harry, to Neville and to all of us. I’m sure he can subtly manipulate Harry under a mistletoe and give him a quick peck on the cheek.”
Dinner was over. It had been interesting; many friends of his father had joined them. The discussions had been heated, like always. His father still thought Draco had no idea of what they were talking about. His mother shot him all-telling looks: keep this to yourself. Show no sign of understanding. Be the unhearing ears he thinks you are.
Astoria looked at her hands. “Yes,” she whispered, just loud enough for everyone to hear. A tear slid over her cheek.
After the joke shop, the five Malfoys met Ron Weasley and Mr. Potter in the Three Broomsticks Inn. The Malfoy children seemed very well acquainted with both men and did not have any scruples in talking to them. Draco Malfoy seemed tense in the beginning, but when he had been able to make Ron Weasley laugh, he relaxed considerably.
Potter’s eyes opened wide in surprise and disbelief. “You don’t – all right. We’re going to the beach tonight, Malfoy.”
Taken aback, Draco stood gaping for a moment before he could answer. “Only because there is no one else to take me,” he smirked then.
“What have you chosen for me?” he asked Cassie. She showed him a magazine of women’s hair models, a picture with the most intricate style he had ever seen.
“I don’t think girls would ever like you, brave or not. Your looks ruin every chance you would every get.”
“You look haunted,” Harry observed when Draco was through the labyrinth, immediately comforted by the few thestrals trotting up to him.
’, the proper way, as a goodbye song to the students that had to go back to their dorms. Draco’s reluctance and Potter’s, Pansy’s and Blaise’s glee, made the Weasleys keen to hear it too.
“Pick a flavour you like,” he said, while placing the box of tea in front of his guests. “I’ll go grab a few of my books, and then we can start, if you’re still willing.”
“I know you have been trying to set me up with Potter. No, don’t argue. I assume you have the help of Albus and his siblings as well.”
Scorpius coughed pointedly, but so subtle that only the Malfoys picked up on it being fake. Phi turned his head slightly to show that he had understood and continued babbling to Teddy. After about forty-eight seconds –Draco had counted to keep himself occupied as he was catching his breath- Draco turned away from Potter’s presence and towards Phi and Teddy.
“I don’t know, love. You are magically very capable, and you control your magic and emotions well enough, I suppose, but I don’t know which memory you could choose. Besides, it takes practice. Don’t expect to manage it in one day.”
Potter took a breath, cast a glance at the Malfoy children, who were all listening attentively. Except for Cassie. She was staring at Potter with a look of such unveiled disdain, that he flinched.
“Potter, mostly. And Suzanne. And you helped me when Astoria visited me, those months back. There is enough leverage between us.”
Potter smiled at him. “I’m sure that won’t be necessary. She was one of the few who didn’t fail horribly today, with the defensive spells,” he remarked.
Draco sighed and put his quill down, resigning to no more work. “Research, actually. Writing up a report.”
He is close. The Dark Lord is standing only a few metres away. If Potter would fire a spell, and his aim would be wrong, Draco could be killed.
Potter smiled brightly. “Don’t worry, I won’t. I know you’d rather kill me and end up in Azkaban than see any of your friends or family hurt. And I admire that, I do. If anything goes wrong, I’ll leave immediately.”
“It just shows how much you’ve improved the last year. Imagine how kind you can be when I’m done with you!”
After Potter’s nod, Draco stood up and took a breath. “We had a rocky start. Not only this year, but the first time we met. And all seven years at Hogwarts, I had this immense dislike for you. I still do, actually, but that’s just a Pavlovian response to your hair by now. Enfin, during sixth year, I hated you even worse, but mostly because I thought you were trying to save everyone but me and my friends, while we could have really used your help. Not that we would have accepted it, mind you, but that’s beside the point. During seventh year, I wanted nothing more than to see your ugly face, and to know that the war was almost over. Then you decided to almost die on me a couple of times, and I didn’t quite agree with that, but all right. The years after Hogwarts, I hated the amount of publicity you got, but I have to say that I hated it mostly because I knew you didn’t want it either. Then came Scorpius, shouting about his new best friend that had the best parents and was such a good flyer and who helped him in all his Defense homework, and I couldn’t really hate you anymore. And this year, dear Merlin, you just didn’t accept defeat, did you? No matter what I did, you just kept being nice to me and I just wanted you to walk away. But you didn’t, and now here we are. Discussing the romance of going to the beach.”
“I was gifted the remaining three Abraxans that were in Madame Maxime’s possession – why, I have no idea – and Miss Fletwock came to me to talk about my way of training Granians.”
“Of course! Yes, love, you should. Next time you visit him, I will give you some money, so you buy him decent food.”
Pushing the covers back, Harry revealed a thick, much too warm piece of clothing. It was red, old, with a faded lion printed on it.
“If I understand correctly, disowning can be reversed by the official family heir?” Potter asked absently.
Potter was seated next to Narcissa, who was on Lucius’s left hand, across from Draco. Draco had adopted a different air than usual, more relaxed while also more regal. However, after he saw that Potter and Lucius were both calm when they returned from the tour, he leant back in his chair and smiled at Potter, and kept smiling throughout the afternoon.
Scorpius sighed. “I do believe you, Cassie, you know I do. But I just don’t think it’s time yet. We should wait some longer.”
what they say about you, and you never did a thing. How was I supposed to just let that happen? So I went up to anyone that annoyed me and warned them that they should back off. One thing led to another, and then I had my first duel, with a third-year Hufflepuff. I won, so her friends went after me for revenge and that soon escalated to me fighting with about anyone in school. It only got worse after your trials. And if fighting is the only way I can help, then so be it. I can handle a few bruises.”
“No, Malfoy, no. I… You were right, last time we spoke of Pansy. Well, not entirely…” Potter laughed at Draco’s indignant face. “But about some things, you were right. So I had been thinking about that, and when you said that they were visiting you, I thought it might be a good way to make it up to them. And to you.”
Draco would be taken to Azkaban without further ado, if he got caught making one tiny mistake. Lots of people already thought that Draco had already overstepped when taking the job at Hogwarts. Some people already wanted him dead, when he decided to keep doing his shopping at Diagon Alley. Many people wanted his children gone from this school, gone from the United Kingdom. He couldn’t afford anything.
! How could I know, this was not in any of the books I read? This is such bullshit, I don’t know what to do, shit, should I… No, I shouldn’t. Shit shit shit,” James murmured to himself. At a certain point, he saw Mr. Malfoy rolling his eyes and sighing. “What?”
Draco sighed. “I don’t know if I’m the best person to talk to about this. I’ve been married, but it was largely arranged as a business deal. I’m not good with the emotional stuff, James.”
eyes. The gnarl he wore, displayed two canines that were much sharper than humanly possible. His eyes conveyed a look that one would usually expect on a predator lurking on its prey, as if he was preparing to rip Potter’s throat off.
“Before you brew the potions, I want you to write a three foot essay on a counterpotion of your own choosing. If you do not hand in this essay, you will not be allowed to brew the potion. If you do not brew the potion, you cannot make this year’s NEWTS, and you will lose five House points. I’d say that is enough reason to write this essay. And you know I don’t accept mediocrity. Now, the rest of this lesson, you have time to work on your essay. Don’t hesitate to ask questions or be critical.”
“You should have come earlier,” the Healer said, guiding James away, back to the stairs. They heard chattering voices and running feet, which materialised in Mr. Malfoy with six children turning the corner and striding their way.
“So a pureblood doctor that agreed with the need to get rid of a Squib for the family’s dignity, or someone Imperiused.” Scorpius sighed, cracking his neck. “Do you see why I’ve gotten a bit hopeless about the case? It’s just so… far-fetched.”
“No need for apologies, you aren’t the one that started this surveillance. In fact, during your time as Head of Aurors, it was easier for us, since we weren’t as heavily watched. I rather liked you as Head Auror.”
Aquila’s reaction was the most painful, however. She was looking at Draco’s hands, a desolate but calm expression on her face. She gave off the vibe that, for the first time in her life, knowledge and facts didn’t cut the deal. She then exhaled a silent breath, before nodding slowly and rubbing her hands together.
Aquila nodded enthusiastically. “He believes we should be responsible for it ourselves. If we are caught out of the Tower, then we are to blame for the docked points. Great man, that Flitwick.”
“Oui, papa m’a appris des Français au début, parce que c’est la langue plus élégante. Et parce que ma grand-mère vit donc en France. Mais surtout parce que c’est la langue dans laquelle papa peut s’exprimer le mieux. Il n’est pas, papa ?” Phi rattled. Draco quirked an eyebrow at Potter’s stunned look.
Because he was a professor, he was let in easily. The Ravenclaw common room was beautiful, with pretty blue colours and a friendly atmosphere. The students looked at him in surprise, some with a scowl and others with a smile. “Where is Aquila?” he asked one student who looked nice enough. The girl stood up and moved to the stairs towards the dormitories.
James pouted, but scooted backwards and sneakily took another glazed cookie from the griddle. “Phi wanted to wear something special, but he couldn’t find it,” he said with a full mouth.
Potter started shaking his head, standing up to face Draco fully. “Tell me everything you think is linked to this. Tell me everything that is out of order.”
Lucius smirked. “To be honest, I don’t know. She may be in it, but I doubt it. Why do you think she’s involved?”
Draco shrugged. “Astoria? She didn’t care. She was rather open-minded about Muggles and such, but in everything else, she was very much a pureblood snob. She used to say that Cassie couldn’t go to the Healers, because she had to learn the hard way to keep calm. She disliked Aquila for not being a Slytherin and ignored all her letters. She hated Phi when he lost his cool and morphed into the black-haired energy ball. Scorpius was the only one who could do things right in her eyes. She doted on him, spoiled and pushed him to his limits, while trying to turn him into one of her puppets.”
There, almost all students were present, reading, studying or having fun with their friends. They looked up when the first one started to notice that Aquila joined Draco in the dungeons. Slowly, it got silent.
George grinned wickedly. “Well, my young innocent girl. Those portraits are the most hilarious victims of a well-aimed prank. You wouldn’t know if you’ve never tried it. It’s worth the detention!”
“Every bit of body language tells an intelligent animal, like thestrals, something about the interaction between two people. These thestrals like me, I’m their boss, their owner, their herd leader. I’m the alpha male. If I show myself to be threatened by you, they will do something about it. If I show that I’m only slightly annoyed by you, they will drop you into the mud.”
“Magic,” Cassie singsonged, starting to grab the materials Draco would need to do his own hair. “Papa, have you showered already?”
McGonagall pushed a plate of biscuits in Draco’s direction, clearly irritated by his question. Draco just hummed.
“Nothing to be afraid of. They’re just dreams. I also dream of a boy, I don’t always see his face very well, and he’s under Imperius to torture one of his classmates. A girl he admired, I think, because he really doesn’t want to harm her. And I see Muggles dying by a… Well, I think it’s the Killing Curse.”
“So, in case you hadn’t deducted it from Scorpius’s lovely story, just now,” Draco drawled sarcastically. “I have not been present for the last couple of days. I am sure you all know what happened on Monday, so I will not reiterate. However, it did compel me to take a few days off. If you have any questions or remarks, please place them at the end of this lesson. I would like to begin with –“
Potter was chuckling throughout Draco’s objections, and full-out laughed when Draco tacked on his last argument.
“Yes, we do. Pansy and I had a little tradition of going out together every month. I doubt we’ll continue that, now that I live here. She was adamant about not ever coming here again, after the final battle.”
While McGonagall nodded quickly, Aquila looked at up Draco with red-rimmed eyes and a pleading expression. “Can I sleep in your room tonight? I don’t want to go to the Tower alone.”
“You’re Draco, I presume,” the man said, with a slight south-European accent. He held out his hand and Draco gripped it. “I am. Draco Malfoy, pleasure to make your acquaintance.”
A door squeaked, revealing Albus and Scorpius with their wands out. “Yeah, Cassie expected that none of them were smart enough to figure that out. We are a bit disappointed in you, though, papa.”
Again, Draco hummed, now with a proud expression. “I’ll be back tomorrow. Should I contact somehow for you, or bring you something?”
“You are trying to isolate yourself. You don’t let anyone visit unless they absolutely demand to come. You practically ignore your children. You pretend that nothing is wrong, while you are a day away from death. You push everyone away, just because you can’t admit that you are dying. I know that I messed up your upbringing, but I never thought I ruined your ability to think logically.”
The last part was in my head, but I couldn't get it out right, so it isn't of very high quality. Sorry...
“Where’d you get this?” he hummed, pulling the red Muggle hoodie close to his face and smelling the collar.
Draco turned to go back to Hogwarts, but Potter grinned and steered him to the other side. They reached a small restaurant, where Potter stood still and cleared his throat.
Phi was clenching his fists so tightly, his nails drew blood. Draco saw that his nails were sharper than usual, and his bared teeth showed long, sharp canines. Definitely not human.
“Harry, love – don’t look at me like that! – if you wanted some proper riding clothing, you could have asked. I have some spare sets. Come on.”
“Of course. Speaking of which, I have been experimenting. I now have potions that are stronger, better and work faster. They are also less addictive. If you’d want, I could give you those.”
An origami bird flew into the room then, landing on Draco’s shoulder. When he folded it open, he rolled his eyes.
“Yes, yes, you’re right, Head Mistress. I will see you this evening. Good luck in your lessons, Mr. Potter,” he managed uncomfortably. Potter arched his eyebrows at Draco’s manner of addressing him, but let it slide for now. Draco quickly went to his class room, where the large majority of his class was already waiting.
Jackie smiled at him. “There was something else I wanted to say. I admire you. You’ve always been cast away, been an outsider, ever since the war. And still, you managed to raise four children, who, might I add, are seriously amazing, and you’re Potions Professor here, and you’re better than our former professor. And the way you handled the debacle with Terence and Priscus. How did you manage to do all that, even with the Mark on your arm?”
Sharing a surprised look with Potter, Draco let his head lean back against the pillows and groaned. “Fine. Lily, you are wise and responsible and good, just like the others. Now go tell them so I can tell these adult-ish people what they want to hear.”
Also, don't hesitate to follow/contact/stalk me on Tumblr: i-am-and-proud. I looooooooove talking to people, so talk to me :D Yay, bye!
Draco smirked at him. “James is a lot like you, Potter. And you seem to forget that I’m quite good at riling you up.”
Phi crawled on Draco’s lap and stayed there after he had gotten his last present, a silver necklace with the official Malfoy crest on it.
“Well, at least keep the underwear. I don’t feel inclined on wearing them ever again, so they’ll be better off with you.”
The scribe looked up when he finished reading, and Draco chanced another look at the audience. There were people frowning now, and whispering all around. The members of the Wizengamot all seemed rather surprised.
The blue light shooting from his wand took some time before it became corporeal, as Draco kept his eyes closed and clenched his fist. When he opened his eyes and covered his frowning expression with a pleased one, the light moved some more and showed a large, wonderful Patronus.
At that moment, the door opened, revealing Lily and Cassie in bemudded clothing. “Scorp! We almost solved the labyrinth, but suddenly the hedges blocked our path and pushed us on the soil. It was really cool. Do you want to come?”
“It’s the people watching,” Potter nodded, realising what Draco was talking about. “That’s the best part of going to the beach.”
“Expelled? Malfoy, don’t you see? You were never expelled, and you got in a weekly fight with another student. Now, I know those were different times, but the principle is the same. If you weren’t expelled for everything you did, you can’t expect me to expel Terence and Priscus.”
Potter’s heart sunk. He may have read Draco wrong then, Pansy and the children may have been wrong. When Potter scooted his hand a bit upwards to tap Draco’s thigh, he had unwrapped himself from the five bodies leaning on him and stood up.
After rounding a corner and landing on one of the other streets, Draco pulled Potter closer and wound and arm around his waist. “You do know that I’m not just with you to get closer to George, right?"
This year, you might notice a boy who is not a student, sitting in this classroom. You may have seen him already this morning. His name is Ophiuchus and he is my youngest son. He may walk in and out of this room during the lessons, but I suspect he will not be any trouble. I expect all of you to ignore him and keep paying attention, even if he walks past you. Ophiuchus, you know not to attract any attention, right?” Phi nodded shyly, while some students turned around and waved at him.
Not quite sure about this chapter, but I just had to post a Christmas Eve thing. I hope you like it!
Draco dug in the wooden box, until he found what he was looking for. A small picture of two adults and a baby in their arms. They smiled at the camera, while they walked past. The baby was tugging on his mother’s hair. Draco was never allowed to tug on his mother’s hair. His father always said that it was for plebo– some difficult word Draco couldn’t remember.
Draco felt a smile grow on his lips, but it faded soon. “I’m not sure I have time today,” he said regretfully.
“I’m helping you! She loves it when people want her food, and you’re the only one who’s too polite to say that they are full.”
Cassie had been one of the longest Hatstall Draco had ever heard of. McGonagall and Granger had taken a long time to be Sorted, but even they had talked about Cassie being exceptional. The Hat couldn’t decide whether Cass was a Slytherin or a Gryffindor. To be frank, Draco thought she belonged in Gryffindor. He didn’t really see the Slytherin part; in his opinion, crying and begging wasn’t a Slytherin way of getting what you want. Eventually, Cassie had been sorted into Slytherin, but “only because she was nagging my magic off to make sure she got into Slytherin,” according to the Sorting Hat.
“A little bit of both,” Phi conceded. “When he’s hurt, he gets this really weird posture. His arms and hands seem relaxed, but they hang too still to be real. His shoulders are very stiff and his back is almost unnaturally straight. All his muscles are tensed, truly.” Ophiuchus shook his head unbelievingly. “But one emotion is so fun to watch.”
“It was a really bad one, then? It’s all right, I’m here now,” he reassured her. Together they walked to the living room, where Potter and Pansy were cleaning up, while Blaise was collecting his their things. Cassie didn’t even greet any of them.
He had always told me to be prepared for when the Dark Lord returned. He prepared me for obeying orders without asking questions and shutting off any compassion when necessary. I was sixteen when I took the Mark, and I was thrilled to be of service. If this would pave the way for my future ambitions, I would do whatever they asked. It only took a month or two before I wanted to get out. But they noticed my apprehension and threatened my parents if I didn’t do what was asked of me. My choice was made.
Potter held Draco’s eyes while he tried to control his breathing. “Fine. You can replace Smiths as guard.”
“No, that’s all right,” James growled. He slinked back to Mr. Malfoy, who wore an imperial expression with a hint of amusement.
“Be careful, or he’ll choke on his own breath,” Harry warned laughingly. “It wouldn’t be the first time.”
When Potter only shushed him, grinning widely, Draco enveloped him in a tight hug. He pulled away after a few seconds, but didn’t let go of Potter’s hand.
“Well, you always said that you chose the songs because they would help us in difficult times,” Phi pondered.
The world starts to spin in normal speed again and Draco again turns around to see the Great Hall. All students of Hogwarts flock together, mostly towards Ha- Potter. Even through the people crowding him, he keeps his eyes locked on Draco. It unnerves him.
“It’s going all right between me and Potter, thank you,” he bit out. “But I’m not sure whether I would like to talk to you about it.”
Jackie still refused to talk to him or his children, but Draco could live with that, since he had been the person to rat out his parents. The only thing he could do, was try to make it up to her.
Potter nodded, fully agreeing to that statement. “So your mum was a Keeper. I had never thought such a thing. But it sounds like a hassle to play a proper game.”
And so, Pansy and Potter seemed to be comfortable around each other, to Draco’s major surprise. Potter turned to greet the other as well, but was beat to it by an exuberant Blaise who was also a bit drunk.
“Before you drink it,” Scorpius said with a serious voice, only just before Draco took his first sip. “Have you kissed already?”
“Now, okay, the last is speed. The spell needs to be cast slowly. What kind of effect does that have? I don’t know. I don’t bloody
Tomorrow, Draco would find this Zarnel girl and ask her to show him what she could do. She might be useful for a little project Draco was about to start.
Draco smiled at them. “And Scorp, Cassie, I heard your Head of House has given you permission to enjoy some time with your father. Phi, you… well, you are always here. So, it’s fine, I guess. If that’s all arranged, I think it’s time for a bit of music.”
“You are a proud man. You know what you’re worth. If I know you the way I think I do, you would never fall for someone who wasn’t worthy of you. Someone who couldn’t stand up against you. Right?”
In the first split second, Draco thought it was a Dark Mark. Luckily, it wasn’t, but the alternative was not much better. On her arm was a black circle with a triangle through it, clearly a kind of gang sign.
I love the person who thought I was from Sweden because I used ABBA, by the way. That was a very good guess.
Pursing his lips, Lucius reached out to touch his son’s hand, but pulled it back before he could do so.
“That is for you to say. I wouldn’t mind if he slips in and out as he pleases, as long as he is silent and doesn’t disturb anyone. He could go around this afternoon, asking the other professors if he is allowed in their classes. If he is, perhaps he could listen in on them as well. If he isn’t, I’ll find something to keep him occupied. He’s a very easy child.”
Draco didn’t really have a choice: without doing anything, he was transported somewhere else. It felt like Apparition, but he was sure he wasn’t being Side-Alonged, and he definitely wasn’t Apparating himself. They landed in a dark, grimy hall that might have been a ball room in a faraway history.
Outside, Hermione found Draco leaning against one of the trees and staring over the vast nothing of the landscape surrounding the Burrow.
“It seems you were right,” Kingsley smiled. “Let me just cast one little diagnostic spell… All right, this seems fine. You can take it with you.”
The magic tingled again, and Draco knew Phi had changed his appearance, from the Hufflepuff boy he had pretended to be, to his normal, jet-black character. Before he could apologise, Potter cut in.
“Two.” Scorpius made sure to catch Albus gaze before continuing. “He does not and will never blame you for anything that your dad has done. Everything is perfectly all right. He still approves of our friendship and likes you for who you are. You are still the same person for him.”
Cassie was – as expected – not as shocked as the others, but there were fat drops sliding down her cheeks again, while she fiddled with the sleeve of her left arm and hunched her shoulders forward.
Draco smiled. “I know. I am about ninety-nine percent sure that Scorp sent you for this exact reason.”
Arthur was next in unwrapping his present, which was a Muggle Gameboy Draco had acquired somewhere and adapted to resist magic.
“How dare you throw that in my face? Did I ask for your intervention? And yes, I remember. I remember very clearly how you told everyone that I was just a boy. Only seventeen. Raised in an environment that didn’t leave me much choice. Say, Potter, do you want to know something about Pansy?” Draco sneered, with the most saccharine smile he could muster. His face twisted down to something foul when he continued. “People seem to forget she was just a girl. Only seventeen. Raised in an environment that didn’t leave her much choice. And for some odd little reason, she wasn’t defended by you. She has to live with the knowledge that no one would ever forgive her for what she’d done, because you didn’t see her for the desperate girl she was. And that is your fault. The people who died, aren’t, but Pansy’s being miserable for the rest of her life, is.”
ever act like that?” At Aquila’s shake of her head, he nodded. “Thought so. It’s just Cassie’s Gryffindor side then.”
The dungeons were done very well. They still held their threatening darkness, but it was less ‘evil’. The hallways were covered in forest green tapestries, which depicted scenes from the Tales of Beedle the Bard. Luckily, they hadn’t chosen the Tale of the Three Brothers.
As soon as Draco was able to relax, he had to admit it was quite enjoyable to be lying so close to someone else. It might also be because it was Potter, but Draco didn’t let himself dwell on that too much. He sighed when he realised that he was actually pondering how a relationship with Potter would be. He shouldn’t get his hopes up. Only a week ago, he was being observed by a reporter in Hogsmeade, who then wrote a less than flattering article about the two of them.
“Are you saying you like a replacement better than your own papa?” Albus laughed. Draco poked Aquila in the side.
“Potter,” Draco glared at him, but couldn’t help the corners of his mouth twitch upwards just slightly.
Rolling his eyes, Draco stood still to look at some older brickwork in interest, before moving again. “She is a Slytherin, Potter. A Slytherin-Gryffindor mix. She can get her hands on anything without anyone noticing. And if that’s not enough, she’s a Malfoy, so she can talk everyone into helping her.”
When Albus left to talk to some others, Draco sent Phi on his way as well. Scorpius looked at Draco with a questioning gaze. Draco merely signed for his son to follow him to a quiet spot with a bench. When Scorpius sat down, Draco turned his back on him and looked at his shoes.
He didn’t buy any presents, but it did get saucy. The Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes, the joke shop of George and Ron Weasley, friends, adopted family and family-in-law of our Mr. Potter, was visited by the entire Malfoy family. There, the children were given many free items, while George Weasley laughed ‘welcome to the family!’ He also had a private moment with Mr. Malfoy, from which Mr. Malfoy reappeared a bit nervously, but very gratefully. Did George Weasley give their relationship his blessing? Has he forgiven Mr. Malfoy for his actions, because Mr. Potter loved him so?
“I’m not sure that is a good idea,” Potter started hesitantly. Surely Draco wouldn’t want to talk about this, especially not with his children around. Besides, what would they need to discuss? What’s in the past, is in the past. And he knew the facts already.
Draco nodded. “Of course I do.” He frowned when he made a small mistake, but kept going anyway. When the intro was finished and Potter was listening with closed eyes, Draco started singing as well.
The few days after Draco’s trial, Draco had to divide his attention between Potter and his children. Cassie didn’t sleep in her own dorm, rather staying with Draco to catch up on sleep. She barely left his side, unless it was necessary, and the couple moments that Draco was
Harry nodded. “I understand. In a few days, he will get better, won’t he? This is just the bad part he needs to get through.”
The children had already gone upstairs, dividing rooms between the Potters, fortunately in the same way as Draco had planned – and had decorated the rooms accordingly. There was Scorp’s room with Albie’s right next to it, with a connecting door, and then Aquila, James and Phi. In the other wing were Cassie and Lily’s rooms and the master bedroom where Draco slept.
Draco balled the fist Potter’s present was in. It was a piece of paper, small enough to fit into Draco’s hand and not be seen. Draco felt himself shake. He walked up to his colleagues, said his goodbyes and left as quickly as possible. He saw Potter’s eyes following him one more time, when he opened the door, and then Apparated home.
as Voldemort once was. But you’ll be patient, won’t you? Well. You have been doing very well with dodging the questions about Rissa, but I am out of leniency. Tell us exactly what you did with her, or your daughter’s face will go through some severe changes.”
“Good afternoon,” Draco greeted the secretary with an easy smile. “I’m here for an appointment with Ms. Euripideia?”
“Get to the point, Mr. Potter,” Lucius interrupted icily. Narcissa shot him a look, before refocussing on Potter and smiling, less tight and more natural then when Potter had only just entered.
“You did, though,” Draco remarked. “You sent me letters every day, to ‘remind me of our love’. The last note said ‘Fuck you, I will find someone who treats me better than you do’. That was the moment I realised what a beautiful human being you actually were.”
“No, never mind. I’m right here, Tinky. Draco, you look lovely. I had almost forgotten you owned those robes! They look good on you, dear,” Narcissa said while she glided down the stairs.
“No, really. I had a feeling that something was about to happen. I also had it right before I was hit with the curse.”
“But I have never seen what it does to one’s heart. I have never seen someone die from it,” Narcissa remarked. She patted Lucius’s shoulder before moving into the room.
“It’s beautiful, isn’t it?” Potter asked. “Everyone should have seen this at least once in their life.”
“So, we’ll be brewing all kinds of potions, with the plants Neville has grown. And we’ll skip the use of enhancers. With a few spells that can be created rather easily by some people Neville knows, we can test whether the potion has the same effect as those with enhancers.”
Before Draco could answer, an indignant sound came from the doorway. “Excuse me?” Ginny exclaimed. "I’m more than ‘decent’, you incompetent broom sweep.”
Aquila grinned at something Phi whispered. “Papa,” she started slowly. “Do you see where you’re standing?” Her gaze travelled upwards, to the ceiling.
Draco huffed and stood up. “If you put it that way. Would you like something to drink? To get you started?”
Aquila petted her sister on the back. “Actually, she was the bait. Albus took it after Potions class when Scorpius was distracting you and I was standing on guard to prevent you from looking around at Albie. Cassie volunteered to be caught out, since she was most likely to get away with it. Which, apparently, she has.”
“He’s talking to your … maman?” Potter asked, hesitating at which word he should use for their other parent.
know that, but it’s not how it works. Come on, Draco, just remember the war. You wouldn’t have let children get away when you’re killing their parents, would you?”
“Since I know your dear Harry will come look for us in no time, we’re not going to stay here. Follow me.”
“If you don’t know by now that I love you, with all your stupid signs of affection, you are even dumber than Umbridge.”
The two Ravenclaw boys sat in chairs at the desk. Their parents sat next to them, on comfortable sofas. Priscus scowled and Terence held his back straight. They both seemed so sure in their case, McGonagall mused.
There was no answer for a while. The silence stretched so long, that Draco opened his eyes to see Potter crying quietly, gazing at Draco with an unreadable look on his face.
“You sure? I can arrange for you to get the newest Firebolts, you know. Or a very expensive bottle of Firewhiskey?”
“We are now entering the galleries. There are five large galleries and thirteen smaller ones. Portraits of every direct Malfoy ancestor, going back to the first known Malfoy to step on English ground. That particular Malfoy was called A –“
But their attic was difficult to reach. It was only accessible by climbing a ladder and worming your way through an opening in the ceiling of the fourth floor. The opening was closed off by a shutter that was locked from the inside. Cassie had somehow found a way to open the shutter from the outside, and thus, creating a safe haven for herself. Quite impressive, really.
It really was a masterpiece. It was made of Ebony wood. Not only was that wood beautiful and expensive, it was also used for lots of wands. Draco didn’t know much about wand lore, but he knew that Ebony wands mostly chose wizards and witches who were strong in their beliefs. He hoped one day he would own an Ebony wand.
Minerva stepped closer to hold Draco’s wand arm still. “You may be overreacting, Draco. You can’t speak Parseltongue either, you can’t open it, if indeed this is the Chamber of Secrets. Can’t you talk to us, tell us your suspicions? There is no hurry?”
“Papa, sing Jason Mraz! Will you do that?” Aquila asked enthusiastically. Scorpius grinned and nodded. Draco knew he would do whatever they asked him to do. He couldn’t deny them anything.
I hope I didn't bore you to death with this chapter, and if I did, welcome to the Kingdom of the Dead! I am your leader, and will bring our Kingdom to the greatest heights it will ever come to!
“If you weren’t begging, I suppose you don’t want this. I’ll eat it then,” Potter shrugged, raising the spoon to his own lips.
“Ophiuchus, raise your chin. You are still a Malfoy,” Draco chided him softly, as gently as he could. Phi made a sound like an agreement, and straightened his back. At the same time, he morphed into his Malfoy exterior, and became the perfect picture of poise and Malfoy strength. Draco’s mouth twitched up in a smile and Scorpius, at his right hand, smiled broadly at them both.
It was silent for a long moment, in which Potter wanted to take back what he had said, because this silence was the most awkward one he had had in a long while.
“Send your youngest back home, will you? Tell him to make sure no one else comes bother us.” Phi squeezed his hand again, but Draco tore it away, giving the slightest tap to Phi’s shoulder, signalling that he indeed go. Luckily, Phi listened without further prompting. However, Draco was sure he was going to tell Harry everything and they would come help him – in a safe way.
“Is this the story that Pansy and Blaise were never allowed to tell us because you couldn’t handle it?”
When the fireworks popped, Potter lifted his head from Draco’s neck and smiled, enveloping him in a tight hug.
Lily was standing with Albus, but Albus’s attention was rather caught by Manila, making Lily look somewhat lonely. Draco and Scorpius shared a look, after which Scorpius led Aquila towards Albus and Lily.
Prejudiced bastards, that Golden Trio. Not that it mattered to Draco. He could make his way to greatness through this Inquisitorial Squad. Sucking up to Professor Umbridge wasn’t difficult; she had the ego of a hippogriff. She just wasn’t as intelligent.
“Dragon Claw Ooze, James, upper left corner of that shelf. Draco, dragon. Come on, hurry up,” Mr. Malfoy urged. “The basis is almost done, and then we need to start immediately. I adapted it to work speedily.”
At breakfast the next day, Aquila decided to sit with her siblings at the Slytherin table. Matias gave her a questioning look when she didn’t walk towards the Ravenclaws, but started talking to his other Housemates. Albus walked to James and Lily a few times, and spoke enthusiastically and with glimmering eyes. Ophiuchus was clearly happy as well, because his hair was jet-black and his hands moved greatly when he’s talking. And even though Cassie looked tired and worn out, she added her own insights to the discussion Scorpius and Aquila were having.
“James Potter sent me a letter, telling me about how loyal you are and how much he loves you. Do you really think I would want you to tell Mr. Potter if I wasn’t motivated to do so by the Potters themselves?”
“You know what? Get out. If you’re going to go all ‘hurt and dejected’ on me, I’m done. I said no, and that’s my final answer. You’re not going to manipulate me into saying yes. Get out before I do something to you,” Neville growled, turning around to fiddle with the plant again.
“That was their conclusion last night. I’ll visit him this afternoon right after classes. Is it all right if I take Albus with me? He wanted to see him.”
“Last month, I have spent my free time researching and retracing the steps you described. I tested the potion, and it seems to work. As your aim was, it is a Healing potion, designed to remove scars?”
“Exactly,” Draco mumbled. “This entire year, actually. I haven’t had this much trouble since the year after Hogwarts.”
“I sneaked out when everyone had gone to bed. I needed to see you before I fell asleep. You always say to never go to bed fighting.”
“Being in a relationship means listening to one another’s suggestions,” he growled. “Let alone being eng- oomph!”
Ophiuchus was wringing his hands together and biting his lip. He couldn’t disturb Potter now, because he was in his own little world, and his brother needed to sort things out with Albus before Phi could come barging in to talk. He slinked back to the wall and remained there until he felt it was safe to come out again.
“Mr. Malfoy, calm down. Please, calm down. I know. I know you wouldn’t. I have known you ever since your marriage, and I know your children. Save your energy for your trial. I am completely and utterly on your side, and I believe that you are innocent. I will fight for you, Draco.”
They went up the stairs, Draco disapprovingly watching the accumulation of mud from Harry’s shoes on the floor. It was surprisingly quiet for a house supposedly housing seven children.
He bit his lip, closing his eyes and wrapping both hands around Scorp’s. His humming slowly developed into soft singing, the song he always sang for Scorpius, in the hope that Scorpius might hear it through his unconsciousness.
“I think we should honour the wishes of the Prince of Slytherin,” Blaise fake-whispered to his partner in crime.
Potter yawned a bit and let his head loll on Draco’s shoulder. “That sounds really good. You know, I’d be good at those things. I’m good at cuddling. And drinking tea. Pick me, pick me!”
“I think there are several parents that would do so, especially since the war,” Ron commented. “The real question is: would you take a Dementor’s Kiss for them?”
“At first, I thought this wasn’t going be important, you know. I thought the movement wouldn’t last, wouldn’t get much follow-up. And it’s like a frog in boiling water, you know. It’s just kept getting worse and worse, but in such small degrees that I didn’t really notice until it was too late. Suddenly, my family was involved. Suddenly, my children were targeted. And I just didn’t know what to do with myself, or who I should ask for help. Surely, I was too late now. And then I got arrested, and I knew that yes, it was really too late now. I was lost. But then you idiots came to the rescue, and I was fine again. I love you so, so much, but I thought I had lost you, and then I didn’t. I just. I didn’t know what to do, Potter. Last two years, I didn’t have people I could burden with this knowledge, because my friends and my parents wouldn’t be able to handle it. Just last year, I met you guys, and I realised that I didn’t have to take this like a wet cloth. I could fight back. Finally. I really want to fight back, I just don’t… know how.”
“Miguel, caring for pureblood traditions isn’t necessarily bad. Neville has told us how Draco isn’t a stuck-up snob. His daughter is friends with a muggleborn, and his son is best friends with Harry Potter’s son. I don’t think he’s still convinced of those ideologies anymore.”
“Because you may be a pain in the ass, but it’s something between us. They don’t have anything to do with it.”
“Months. The law says that the heir needs to send a formal request of reversal every day for three months at least. And formal requests, according to this pureblood law, is at least one entire roll or parchment, full of wordy sentences and nonsensical pleads.”
Gulping, he turns around. His father now stands in front of him. His eyes storm. He doesn’t say anything else. His mother looks at him, again all-knowing. She smiles, a small smile, but one that reaches her eyes. With a slow nod, she gives him all the love he needs at that moment. He sees his father swallowing. His mask breaks for a second. Then he turns around and marches away, commanding his mother to follow.
Draco scoffed. “What exactly do you think? Four of them are Slytherins, one’s a Ravenclaw and the others are relentless. They
“Is it the dress? Did you want something else? I’m sorry if that is the case, Cass. I can have Harky get a dress from the Lodge, if you want,” Draco assured her, fiddling with the edge of the bed covers.
“I may have ordered the romantic ride, but I figured you wouldn’t mind. I just threw around some money, but you must be used to that.”
“Because he is dramatic, hadn’t you noticed? He thinks there is only one option, which is usually the worst plan anyone can ever come up with. Everyone who tells him there are other options, doesn’t understand the complexity of the situation, according to papa. He is so self-destructing, it would be fun to watch, if it wasn’t my papa.”
“Also, if the diversion is too suspicious, she’ll leave a See-All with me, and then I won’t be able to do a thing. It has to be subtle,” Draco frowned. When Harry perked up with an apparent idea, Draco shook his head. “You aren’t subtle in the least, Harry. Let someone else do this.”
“Wha – yes, I do, but – James, don’t go searching through my stuff. I’ll get it for you. What do you need it for?”
“I merged the Malfoy crest and the most recent Potter crest I could find. You see, it now says ‘Malfoy-Potter.’ I wanted to try ‘Potter-Malfoy’, but it turned out that the Malfoy name can only be legally merged, if it is the first name, so there it is. Ehm, the snake is curled around the lion’s cubs, protecting them.”
“No? You don’t remember?” He saw Priscus’ nose twitch up in disgust. Bingo. Slytherin pride wasn’t the only pride at Hogwarts.
“He was a good enough man. I’m not much better than he is, to be honest. So yes, even though he wasn’t a good man.”
The chairman gestured to continue, so Doctor Selaminder faced Draco, smiled encouragingly before asking his questions.
“Don’t mention it. So, are you ready to come out with the other professors for a few drinks tonight?”
The music started slowly, with Draco making some dramatic faces and movements, fainting like a Victorian age lady, before he started marching along on the rhythm. Pansy catcalled at him, Blaise shouted that he wasn’t doing it properly, after which Draco glared at them and slid over to Potter.
Merlin, did everyone know? His children, obviously, probably Albus as well, Neville of course. Did Potter know? What if he did? They had flirted that one time, but –
Cassie clenched her fists tighter in the front of his robes, but Draco caught on her hands in his and intertwined their fingers.
“They’re terrifying.” She paused. “Papa assures me they’re just dreams, but it’s still scary, you know? I mean, I always have the same dreams. One of them is of a young, blonde girl in a slimy dungeon. She’s thin and pale, and no one feeds her. But for some reason, she keeps smiling and she stays optimistic to the other people in the dungeon.”
Draco laughed. “I don’t know, Potter. I didn’t read it. I took it off my door without looking at it. I’m sure I have it somewhere.”
“As we were saying, papa is unable to lie or say no when he has ice cream,” Cassie stated. “I will give you another example, to show that it is not just, as we call it, the ‘Harry Potter Effect’. Papa?”
is what’s wrong. I can’t go in there. They don’t want me there. They feel sorry for my children, but I shouldn’t go in. It’s so wrong. Just let me leave.”
But most of all, Lily wasn’t seated at the Gryffindor table. Draco let his gaze wander and saw her, a bit squirmy and nervous, laughing with Cassiopeia about something in the book in front of them. Their white-blond and bright red hair contrasted brightly as they pushed their heads together to whisper something.
The thing is, Potter didn’t want to be here. He just knew it would be terribly awkward, and there was no reason at all that he should be here. Alas, Draco was forcing him, and he didn’t have the heart to refuse him. Not after the evening they just had, with Neville and Hannah and the rest of the gang. They had so much fun, the Slytherins seemed to have fitted in perfectly, even though they were much sassier than the rest. Most of all, Draco had charmed the pants off of everyone. By embarrassing Potter a lot, but Potter could let that slide.
On the other hand, this chapter is much longer than usual chapters, so I figure that could make up for it.
“You aren’t talking about your nightmare, Potter,” Draco reminded him. Potter noticed he had a warmth to his voice that he had never heard there before, not even when Draco was talking to his children.
“Cassie, tell me what is wrong. We just agreed that keeping things from each other is the worst thing we can do, didn’t we? Come on, you can tell me anything,” Draco coaxed softly, until the tension in Cassie’s shoulders disappeared and she grimaced.
“Potter,” Draco sneered, trying to push Potter away from him, but giving up when it seemed he wouldn’t win anyway.
With the Owl Post came the weekly letter from Narcissa, and Draco took that as an opportunity to write his parents and friends a small note on the new development, so they wouldn’t be taken by surprise if
“Of course. For who else would I buy chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream from Ben & Jerry’s, and add some homemade chocolate sauce with caramel and pulverised cashews?”
“I was not obsessed with Potter. You know I tried to find out what he was up to, so I could tell my father about it,” Draco defended himself. Pansy merely raised an eyebrow, a poor resemblance of Draco’s impressive unimpressed looks.
“Well, at least he thinks Hagrid is scary enough to dress up as him for Hallowe’en. That’s something.”
“He won’t. We will all be here to help him and support him whenever he needs it. We love him, and that’s all he needs.”
Draco raised his eyes and looked at Neville, slowly calming down enough to see things more rationally.
“Well, what do you want to do?” Potter asked, knitting his eyebrows together when he saw Draco push away his plate.
“And you also said, at one of those evenings with Potter, that you might die sooner than expected,” Pansy frowned. “You tell us the truth right now, Draco, or I’ll call your mother.”
If they decided he was guilty, he would never get to wind his fingers through Jamie’s hair again. Or tease Albus with his relationship with Manila. He would never see whether Albus and Scorpius’s friendship would last. And dear Lills, he would never get to see that smile light up a room again. He may have just known them for a year – and Albus a bit longer, but never as well as he had gotten to know them this year – but they were so dear to him already.
Draco raised an eyebrow while he pressed the dough onto the griddle. “Again, how much contact do you think I have with Charlie Weasley? You’ve been talking about him like you think I see him every day.”
have been this creative. And I assume everything is correct, and entirely fleshed out? Of course it is. Salazar and Godric
“So? The same goes for you. And for many Death Eater children, and your Weasley friends, and Hermione. I’m not saying it was good, because it wasn’t, but I am saying that I am over it. My life turned out better than I could have hoped, I have four perfect children and a job I quite frankly enjoy. And as I said, I love the memories I have from before Hogwarts. My father really was a good father, you know.”
Draco nodded, not speaking because he was too busy withholding himself from buying the entire supply.
“Counterpotions can undo the effects of a charm, spell or potion, like Suzanne already said. As you may understand, a potion is easy to counter, because you just combine ingredients that neutralise the ingredients of the first potion. However, spells can be countered too by a potion. It’s a difficult process to invent a counterpotion, but it’s easier than inventing a counterspell.”
Someone garbles. Draco’s arm is by his side. A red liquid drips of the object in his hand. His view is blurred. The body in front of him collapses. Pieces of skin of the dead person start floating upwards, faster and faster, until the body is nothing but bones and dust, barely recognisable for anyone without deep knowledge of his face.
“No hurry?” Draco breathed, turning around with his hand clenched around his wand. “My children have not been seen in the Great Hall, in a period where I have been assaulted and my children have been hurt in the worst possible ways. But sure, let’s
“Sure. See you, mate. Draco, come here, give me a hug. That’s it. Enjoy your day, and ignore everyone who’s being annoying, yeah?”
“You sound just like your father, do you know that? Forgiveness doesn’t help, Albus! It doesn’t make it better. It’s weak. Your father, your entire family is weak.”
“Oh no, Malfoy, I’m not. But if you need my approval, I am more than willing to extend some. Just say the word.”
“Just tell us what is going on,” Cassie begged. “First, Dad comes back without papa, and hides in McGonagall’s office, and now
Phi leaned back against Draco’s chest. “At least we know your eyes are working correctly,” he giggled. Potter laughed.
Mumbling something or other, Draco took Pansy’s arm, but kissed her on the cheek before she Apparated them away.
“He was trying to get into your apartment, Dad,” Phi interrupted. “I had to come with him, because he was too afraid to go himself.”
“Dear Mr. Potter, you forget who you are talking with. Ms. Euripideia may be influential in official terms, but Lucius has many favours to call in. We can go a long way, if we all try,” Narcissa soothed.
He tugged his sister along to the bedroom, where one of the closets was filled with all kinds of decorations and items they wouldn’t need very often. When they appeared, Draco was busy with the cake. He was making a triple chocolate cake, using the fanciest chocolate he stored in his cupboards. It had three tiers, every tier another chocolate flavour. Scorpius preferred pure, Aquila loved milk and Draco indulged himself with the smallest tier made of white chocolate. Decorating it with Ravenclaw and Slytherin banners, an eagle and a scorpion and their names on the respective tiers, he had only just finished when Scorpius and Aquila themselves sneaked in, thinking they would wake Draco.
Then he made some space to create a make-shift stage, and sat Potter down on a barstool he brought from the kitchenette.
“Doesn’t it? Because frankly, I know the Malfoys, and I am quite sure Ophiuchus does not admire Voldemort.”
Draco gave him a resounding high-five and ignored the surprised look in Theresa’s eyes. “Why didn’t you tell me earlier, Jamie? I’m supposed to know these things!”
The musical was perfect. It was magical, in the Muggle sense of the word. Draco watched without once taking his eyes away. The break was entirely unwelcome, because it meant they were already halfway.
“My essay is a report of an extensive experiment. The experiments end today, at five o’clock. I need to measure the results and after that, I need to work those into a passable essay. That is why I don’t have my essay yet.”
So, I had planned this elaborate gesture for you, but suddenly I was walking again, so I kind of forgot about it. I didn’t, actually. I just had to find a new moment and a design a new plan. However, along with the batch of wood, there was something else. Less symbolic, and easier to understand for the common folk.”
With that, Draco marched everyone to the car. They drove to London, to the courtroom in the Ministry’s building. The security measures were a hassle with so many children in tow (none of which were listening, of course), but they got through soon enough. Harry led the way, obviously knowing exactly where to go and feeling comfortable in his former workplace. That allowed Draco to trail back and watch his family.
He hadn’t expected this to have been their outing. He also didn’t quite know how he felt about Potter taking him here, but he was certainly not angry. How could he, if Potter had taken him to see Severus’s grave?
“Of course. Let’s start at the basics, yes?” The barrister sat down while leafing through his papers. “To start easy, we will have to decide on three witnesses. I made a list of suitable candidates. Which ones would you prefer to have on your side?”
Draco caught his smug grin and elbowed him as a greeting. “Please don’t look so happy. You have done nothing,” he said casually.
“No. Same story. The location of his grave has been kept a secret from our family and other known Death Eaters, so that it couldn’t become our new headquarters.”
Last but not least, Scorpius knocked on the doorpost and stuck his head in. “I heard people walking around. Everything fine in here?” he asked. He didn’t wait for an answer, but just sunk down on the foot of the bed and closed his eyes.
“Mr. Malfoy? You said he will be all right, yeah?” Albus asked, having sat down in the second chair on the other side of the bed.
“Don’t do that next time,” Draco chided the youngest two, when they had caught up. Cass and Phi had claimed a table in a corner, where they could look out over Diagon. It was a good spot.
I'm late again, but you must be used to that now. I only returned from Tuscany on Sunday morning, and I'm leaving for camp tomorrow, a camp that I'm organising, so Sunday was dedicated to that, and the day after I return from the camp, I have two exams and an essay due, so this story wasn't one of my priorities.
“Well,” Potter said when the slice of cake was gone –mostly to Draco, of course, since Potter wasn’t very good at saying no- and Draco was eyeing the next piece already. “I suppose I should congratulate you. Fourteen, you are now?”
Soon enough, they were on their way to the beach, with extra vests in their bag to beat the sharp coastal wind. The path lead between rough cliffs and a heather covered hill, resulting in a rocky sand beach. There were several people sitting or walking along the waterline, seemingly just as content as Draco felt already.
Grinning, James came to stand next to him while Draco prepared a new cauldron for some simple potions. “Is there no leverage then?”
“Because everyone with the least bit of sense can understand that Metamorphmagi don’t have as much difficulty with becoming Animagi as normal wizards do. They already have lots of control over their appearances and their magic. Why should it be different in their Animagus form?” Draco reasoned. “You’ll still be young, but it would be less strange.”
“You could have told us explicitly to be honest. You can’t just pour Veritaserum in someone’s tea. I suppose you did that, Cassie?” Potter asked. “Where did you even get it?”
“Oh don’t be so nit-picky. The castle isn’t Christmassy enough. Perhaps we ought to do something about it.”
“You called me by my first name in the Chamber of Secrets,” Draco commented, taking a sip of his tea and shuffling through the newspapers on his coffee table.
“Good. Would you like to talk about your nightmares? Your fa-papa told me that it’s important to talk about bad dreams.”
I made those mistakes, I can tell my children what to look out for. I can help them in the right direction. Those mistakes, this Mark, is what has shaped me. I learned from it. So no. I don’t want people to forget. I stand by my mistakes. I had my reasons. I had my motivations, and they were good enough for me to do what I did. If I would be in the same position now, I’m not sure whether I would do it any differently. I
“Something wrong with Professor Potter?” Scorpius asked carefully, when they were walking through the main street of Hogsmeade.
Then, suddenly, Draco had a gift in his hands. Upon seeing the bucket load of chocolate, he started laughing. Scorpius scooted closer to see which flavours he had gotten and Draco popped a first piece in his mouth. “Best Christmas gift ever,” he grinned.
“No, of course. Don’t worry about it. Now, you said you were a classmate of his eldest daughter, of Aquila. What are your thoughts on Aquila’s relationship with her father?”
James laughed now. “No, not really. I don’t think I can handle such pressure right now. When do you think you can have the grades, if I may ask?”
Draco seemed to think about that for a second, before he closed the drawer and locked it tight, grabbing Potter’s hand and pulling him out of the office. In the hallways, he released Potter’s hand, but the smiles he kept shooting Potter were enough. They twisted through the dungeons, into hallways Potter wasn’t even sure were known on the Marauder’s Map, and ended in front of a heavy brass door.
Draco sank down on one of the chairs opposite of Potter. He would have wanted to sit on the sofa, next to him, but he thought he wouldn’t be able to have this conversation when being so close to him. It would be easier if they sat across from each other, so they would have to look each other in the eye and face the facts.
“Among others. As I said, I also have Abraxans, Aethonans and Granians at my stables near Hogwarts.”
Potter looked up from the essay he was marking, and smiled. “Hi Pans. I’m fine, thanks. How are you? Any particular reason you’re here?”
“Good, good. Luna – Lovegood, you know? – could perhaps take you in for an internship, if you would like to get some hands-on experience,” Draco offered, making Pansy giggle.
“I’m not just talking about your mother. I’m also talking about you. Since when do we not celebrate the holidays as a family?”
Draco was still looking at his children, and saw the immediate change in their faces when the new witness walked in. Phi’s magic was blazing around him, strong enough that an actual blue shine was visible. He was able to control it enough so nothing exploded, but it seemed a near thing. Lily and Cassie were both watching with their mouths open in shock, a deep crease between their eyes. Aquila had her eyebrows knitted together, but was mostly trying to keep Scorpius and James in their seats, just like Albus was.
The wooden box was still hidden under his bed. It was also still filled with scraps of articles, pictures and small merchandise items. He just couldn’t add to his collection anymore. His father already knew that he was fan of the Boy-Who-Lived, because he found the articles two years ago. But just last Christmas, his father had found him cutting out another article. He had been furious. Draco was forced to eat in his room every day for a week, and his father had ignored him for an extra week after that.
“As long as you don’t think I will be representing you as well. I am trying to make my own decisions and statements. I won’t be replacing you in every matter.”
“Oh please, Draco, get your act together. I don’t blame you for anything. It’s just Theresa that thinks you are doing anything wrong. And she doesn’t even know everything of it.”
Phi purred softly, sitting down instead of standing, and let Draco take a good look at him. It was obviously still a young panther, bigger than a cub but very clearly not yet adult.
how much he loves them. This trial is nothing more than an excuse to lock Mr. Malfoy up, just because some people think he wasn’t punished enough after the war. This trial is, like Scorpius accurately said,
“I’m going to move us to the sofa, if you’re all right with that. You can sit there, and I will bring you some Firewhiskey. Yes?” Draco offered. Potter just swallowed, still looking like a child who just saw their parents die. Sympathy filled Draco, and he smiled, while gently herding Potter to the forest green sofa in his living room. When Draco moved to disentangle himself to get Potter his promised drink, the man tugged on his wrist and looked up with such sadness and need, that Draco couldn’t leave him. He sat back down and collected Potter in his arms again.
It was a strange occurrence that they were still sleeping soundly, while it was already ten AM. Usually, they were running about the house the moment the sun peeked through the curtains, and by eight AM, the first tears were streaming down faces.
“Both a bit. I make sure my own bedroom is cleaned, and I try to get the children to clean their own, but Kreacher does the rest. I’m not sure I would be able to keep a house like this proper without Kreacher. I’d be too chaotic to do it on my own.”
Potter’s eyebrows rose, clearly surprised at the land they owned. “So how many acres do you own, approximately?”
Draco knew he had to move, he had to get his legs working, he had to run or at least try to ward off the snake. He couldn’t, though. He saw the jaws of Nagini opening, her fangs dripping poison. He saw her red eyes boring into his, so he closed them. Then he heard, in the deafening silence of the Great Hall – who knew students could be so quiet.
“I told you about your lying disabilities. But even without you blinking your eyes twice quickly when you lie, I would know that your toothbrush is red. You’re sentimental and nostalgic for the Gryffindor common room, to the extent that your ex-wife’s hair is red. It isn’t bad, it’s just… Interesting.”
“But I can’t.” He stood up and turned his back on Potter, looking at some books standing in the book case.
Lily nodded, sheepishly grinning but there was an odd glint in her eyes. She held on to Albus’s arm a bit too tightly for Draco’s comfort. James didn’t seem to notice; he engulfed them in a hug and gave them a scolding of his own.
Smiling awkwardly, Smiths shook his head. “I’m afraid not, sir. As this is a Red Case, the suspect is not allowed any unsupervised contact.”
“Harry, good to see you again,” Pansy greeted, giving him a fleeting hug, right after Draco. Blaise raised his eyebrows at Draco in a questioningly manner, and then gave Potter two air-kisses.
Draco answered with an absent hum –not denying it, but definitely not agreeing. They kept quiet for another ten minutes, in which Draco thought that Albus really was a lot like Scorpius, in the way he didn’t mind long silent periods for each to tend to their own reflection.
“Well, if that’s all,” Minerva interrupted. “We should get you out of here and call the Aurors. Draco, you need to tell me everything you know about this Chamber and the second entrance.”
Yup, I'm a week late again. But I promise, now I have enough time to stick to the schedule again. And there will be another chapter online today or tomorrow to make up for the missed week!
As Draco’s fingers deftly worked through Cassie’s hair, barely thinking about what he was doing, but sure that the result would be beautiful, he thought what he should say to his daughter next.
Draco heard Potter’s breathing hitch from time to time, eyes wide open in surprise and confusion. He smiled softly to reassure Potter.
“How was it, dear?” Molly asked him while engulfing him in a massive motherly hug. “Do you need anything? Fred, leave your sister alone! No Louis, it is not funny if you join in. Bill, George, would you do something about it, please?”
“Because, being who I am, I wouldn’t be allowed visitors. I would sit in my cell all day long, knowing that I wouldn’t get out again, and knowing that somewhere in the world, my children are continuing their lives. They wouldn’t be able to say goodbye, just like with a Kiss, but they would also know that I am still thinking of them and longing for them. The fact that they wouldn’t be allowed to visit, would make it worse for both them and me. Azkaban is the slowest, most painful and torturous way of separating people, especially for my family. Other prisoners still have visitors from time to time. I would see nothing but my walls, until I die.”
“Everybody, close your eyes,” Draco ordered. He was happily surprised in how easily everyone went along with it, apparently more than willing to clear the insecurities between their families.
When Draco ended, his children were wearing big grins, and Scorpius was –as he always did when Draco sang this song- blinking away tears and pretending he was fine.
“Potter,” Draco greeted, with all the dignity he could muster. Which was, admittedly, not much, seeing as he had just been caught singing ABBA and dancing ridiculously, by Potter of all people.
“Jackie, are you sure? It can’t be true, can it?” he heard someone ask. There was only a loud sob in response.
“I’m not entirely sure how it works. I think you should try to focus on how you look like as a human being, and how it feels to walk to two legs and such. Don’t worry if it doesn’t happen immedia-“
Draco shook his head. “Because, of all people, Phi is the one with the most experience in controlling magic. He knows best how to calm oneself to stop outbursts. Scorpius, stop shielding James. You’re making it worse.”
“I wasn’t supposed to win the trials, Potter.” When Potter seemed to protest, Draco held up his hand to keep him from speaking. “No, listen. I’m not saying I was guilty, because I’m
Phi’s answer wasn’t surprising. He affirmed it and explained that it mostly happened when he was very angry or when someone had offended his siblings.
“No, no, you’re always welcome. Of course you are. In fact, I had a little something for you.” Draco stood up to shuffle around in one of the closets. When he turned back around, he was holding a small package, which he thrust forward in Potter’s hands. “I thought you might appreciate this. It’s nonsense of course, but it reminded me of you.”
“To start, I’d like to say that it’s funny how we always seem to get closer in times of trouble. My… asshole-ness diminished during the war, because there were other things to worry about. And this year, everything just escalated, to the point that even
“A date. We walked around the Great Lake together yesterday, and then I asked a kitchen elf to make us hot chocolate and we spent the evening together in the library, studying. It was really cool.”
“Well, papa was just talking when I walked in, so I can’t tell you exactly what Mother said, but I’m sure it’s about the article. She wasn’t happy.”
Draco smiled faintly. Of course they had it bad for each other. And there was nothing wrong with that. He leant closer, revelling in the shock that registered on Potter’s face. Their breaths mingled, noses brushing each other and lips barely apart, when a loud banging on the door interrupted the moment.
“I don’t know, it’s a gut feeling. And last time I ignored a gut feeling, I was hit by a curse that almost killed me.”
Draco hummed non-committedly, eyeing Potter from the corner of his eye. Potter looked at the jumper he was wearing and back at Draco, before chuckling and opening his arms to invite Draco in.
George shook his head, grabbed a camera from behind his desk to take a picture, before handing Potter a vial of nasty brown liquid.
In the afternoon, Theresa arrived for their potioneering with a big smile on her face, telling Draco how happy she was that he had reappeared. Draco merely nodded before setting her on starting the potion.
“No, come on, Malfoy, don’t deliberately misunderstand. It was always the same story; you had been wrong, a disgrace to wizardry, suspicious, a pariah… It just got tiresome to get angry about it every day, you know.”
