“I need to go.” Face cast to the sky, day emerging as victor, now a dusty orange.
type and such, you'll be off, yes?" He lets his gaze linger pointedly on the tumbler in Harry's hand. "I'd like to retain at least one of my fine spirits."
Admittedly and arguably understandably, Harry considers penning a very firm letter to the manager of Iniquity regarding the sanitation of his mask and the myriad of health and safety concerns he's now forced to contemplate after the transportation of said mask in the surely saliva-filled mouth of owl two. Despite the immense satisfaction doubtlessly gained from the writing of such a missive, in the end, he merely flicks a
When he was twenty two he learnt forgiveness. Of others. Of himself. Actions and consequences of younger selves forgivable, irrelevant in present day. How what you thought you knew wasn't always the truth; simply a façade, a mask worn, not so different from his own. To move on, history had to be released and the slate wiped clean. Bend before you broke.
The weighted-licks land, slipping down his crease, grazing his entrance. "I'm going to fuck you, pet," this illusion of Draco-yet-not promises with a grunt, voice cracking. "And you're going to watch your arse take every last inch of it."
“He has a hold on her. He won’t let her go.”
But your side of the bed is still empty, and you still haven't shown up for work, and no one is there to turn to in the murky dark when the terrors of past threaten, too close to the surface. The Fiendfyre is back, like the dreams after the war. Except now, Draco, I’m forced to watch you battle it - as a man, not a boy - and lose.
"So the whispers on the streets were true" the man stated without looking up. Head hung, bearded and bedraggled, the only movement was of a thumb tracing hypnotically over the underside of a wrist.
. His mind is insistent. His body craves more. He knows he's doomed.
Before you were gone.
he’s hard and wanting.
“I've been waiting for you.” It never crosses Harry’s mind to say anything bar the truth. “Hoping I'd see you again.”
Harry's staring at him. "I'm not sure they are, Magnus," he says. "Unless you're hanging out with some very strange youth."
“Do not wait for me. Don’t come back till then.”
It’d been more than Harry had hoped for.
"You fucking cunt." The man's fist connected with the side of Draco's face as he tried to right himself, sending him sprawling back onto the damp concrete. A kick landed to his ribs, followed quickly by another to his chest leaving him winded. Curling into a ball as the blows fell, they rained down across his huddled form. Pain. Draco was used to pain. Used to the sweet sickness, the battle between his body's need to protect itself and his mind’s steely determination to never show weakness.
Him, whose eyes glint inky and dangerous under the black moon as he brings his hand to rest lightly at your waist, heat permeating through the layers of your dress robes.
Your hand is on your cock, spreading oil down the length. Superfluous: Harry's so loose you could fit four dicks up his arse, like the tail of a peacock. Still, it's the gesture that matters. Presage for your quivering audience that the principle attraction is about to commence.
A promise that Draco could never see fulfilled.
“Happy? Fucking
Draco returns on a night when snow lays heavy upon the ground and the sky is devoid of moon and cloud.  Harry sits like he's always sat. Waiting like he's always waited. The beauty of a life unconstrained by time or commitment. Harry is staring, unfocused, over the white rooftops of London when Draco appears beside him, any sound of advance having been muffled by the snow.
Is Draco only waiting for the platform to open?
"Eves uncle, what have I done?" Magnus mutters. The boy - young adult, whatever the fuck you called a 23-year-old puddle of hormones, love, and misplaced emotional vulnerability who spent far too much time on Mangus' sofa drinking premium spirits - is still gaping at him like a fish. A bewildered, slightly inebriated fish. "Close your mouth. You look like a stunned mullet," he says, enjoying the look of confusion that accompanies Harry's compliance.
It would have been enough, before. Still probably would be, if this was all he was willing to give. But the irrevocable craving sears carnal and inescapable and oh,
“It was sudden. One minute, I was in the bathroom, then a hand grabbed me, and I was gone.” He shuddered, the memory of that night fresh in his mind as if it had just happened. He remembered the smells, the aroma of food mixed with the slight stink of unwashed bodies, and how it had suddenly changed, replaced with the earthy odour of wet ground, the musty decay of rotting wood. How he had frozen when he had spied the human outlines hidden in deep shadows, and the all-consuming fear when their identities were revealed. “They weren't very happy with me. Abandoning the cause, and all that.”
An answer does ultimately come, eons later, an eternal war waged with victor drawn. "Truly, pet, you don't want to know," the man eventually says, as if this admission in itself is painful. Harry wants to protest, indeed takes a blind step forward, arm outstretched and fingers searching for the warmth he's only felt teases of, intent on offering some sort of confirmation. But his palm falls on empty air, gesture rebuffed, and Harry withdrawals his arm to his side, illogically hurt by the spurn.
. Alone, but so
“The taste of death” Harry murmurs aimlessly, pulling his glasses from his face in a vain attempt to dry the lenses. He drops himself heavily to the ground, uncaring of the wetness which instantly saturates his pants. He feels hollow, wrung out. An empty vessel needing to be filled.  Alive and physically intact, yet held together only by the frailest wisps of twine. Still. Draco had been here. He’d conversed with Harry, and hadn’t looked at him like he was insane, nor pitied him with knowing eyes whilst gently suggesting '
The black moon sends anamorphic light dancing across your naked flesh, the eerie glow washing out already ashy skin, distorting the jutting planes of your body. In contrast, he's shrouded in caliginosity, eyes dark and unreadable as they map up your arms, over your chest, down the line of pale hair that runs from navel to groin. They linger there, your cock jerking as his eyes seem to burn through your slacks. Hunger undeniable, as he steps forward out of the shadow revealing pants taut and straining.
"Circe's tits, you're so
Harry simply sat there, those eyes of his piercing even in the low light, a hypnotic force willing Draco to obey.
Pretend Harry does.
"It's a distance thing, darling." Magnus stretches, the hand not holding his whisky reaching to scratch a relocated yet still put-out Chairman Meow behind the ears. "Easier to keep you at arm's length. Lord only knows the horrors which would occur if you were aware of his true feelings. Spiteful, really. I'd love to have my living room back."
“It was after Father had cast me out. I was moving from shelter to shelter in muggle London” Draco relented with a sigh. “I had pissed off the wrong sorts - the muggle gangs that ran the streets - so I couldn't stay in the same place for long. The night they came, I had just found a new shelter.” A sad smile crossed his face. “They had soup to eat, and I remember thinking I hadn't eaten anything that delicious, ever. Hunger will do that to you.”
From a distance, one could think it was him.
Harry wines softly, shifts restlessly beneath you, and you're lost. You lose yourself to the cries of the crowd, to the mewl and huff of Harry's comedown, to the drag and clench and shudder and hardness of the naked body withering under your palms. You come with a hiss, hands gripping tight enough to bruise, mind going blank as your orgasm curls around your spine and explodes behind flickering eyelids, forehead falling to land in the cooling damp skin between Harry's shoulders as you receded from nirvana back into your body.
to align; the former hardly appearing the type to dabble in the darker shades of copulation. Harry has been wrong in the past, of course - learnt the face one wears for day has no determination on the one worn after dusk or between the sheets - yet contrary to whatever fantasies his heart conjures on the matter, his mind rejects the notion that the man Harry pursues through the glossy pages of the tabloids would have any inclination whatsoever to
I'm sorry. Please come back.
“How is it possibly your fault, Harry” Draco bit out. “Did you leave me wandless? Did you disinherit me? Oh, wait. Let me guess. You were Polyjuiced, and impersonating Dolohov. In that case, was the sex good?” Sarcasm dripped from his tone.
A cleaning spell washes over his skin, taking with it the tendrils of self-pity, dragging him into the reality of darkness and masks and aching, raw limbs. "I do hope you're back with me," the man says, tone firm, commanding, flickered with enough tenderness to yank Harry's lust to the forefront of importance. He feels the touch of fingertips over his arms, waist, legs, the removal of the constraints holding him immobile. Groans, as sure-hands guide him upright, holding him steady as he finds his balance on shaky feet, wand-calloused palms of Harry's lover rough against his sensitive skin.
interwoven with the sweet clamp of his arse around you as you start to fuck him in earnest, pulling back so that it’s just your tip left before slamming in, nails biting into the soft skin of his thighs. You drink in the sounds he’s making, the grunts and the whimpers and the garbled nonsense, the quiver of his muscles even as he pushes back to meet every thrust.
He swallows, fingers twisting the piece of threadbare cloth tied around his wrist. A hard leap. Gaze on Draco, he steps forward onto the path of unknown.
Either he leaves his body or loses his mind, for the next thing he sees are his legs hooked around the man's waist, his pelvis canted, fingers digging into the harsh lines of his lover's shoulders. If prep spells are cast, Harry misses them; the cock pressing insistently at his entrance is slick, yet the burn of muscle hurriedly stretched as he's filled completely with one agonising thrust threatens blackout. His head thumps hard as it connects with the wall, arse protesting with each shallow breath he takes.
“They do.” He winces as soon as he’s said it, can hear bitterness poisoning the words.
It was the first roof Draco had been under in three years. It was glorious.
be Draco by the sheer nature of the masquerade they wear.
. “Are you?”
. Slumping down, he curled his shaking form into a ball, arms wound tightly around his body, and shut his eyes.
"Right you are. You don't have the suaveness to pull them off." It's bitchy, Magnus knows, but Harry could act a touch appreciative for the help. "Let's move on. After the declaration comes the swanning."
When he was twenty two he learnt that it was okay to be happy in a world which was broken. Happiness didn't mean someone, or everything, was better. More that they had clutched at a bright spark in a sea of darkness and held on. The sharp sting of pain, the hypnotic crimson of blood - they were fundamental to the contentment that he now felt; fundamental to his happiness. He learnt there was only so far one could repent, before it was time to move on.
I survived the Dark Lord; I’m sure you’ll find sweet irony in the fact your absence is harder to weather.
“Oh god, you’re already drunk aren’t you?” Draco laughed.
He starts bucking wildly into Draco’s hand, long past caring how desperate and wanton he might look. It won’t be too much longer now. He’s throbbing with the need to come, vacillating between begging for Draco to make him come and pleading with Draco to stop.
“Yeah, me too,” Harry said, smiling. “I feel like a bit of an idiot. I mean, obviously, you of all people wouldn’t have judged me.”
She pressed her lips together, as if fighting back a large smile. “I think that will be very good for you.”
“I don’t want them to leave,” Teddy said, looking at Andromeda imploringly.
At some point the teasing stopped, and Draco was still.
He turned over possible responses—explaining to Draco that Harry hadn’t wanted to upset him, that he was scared and didn’t want to see that reflected in Draco’s face. But that would just lead to questions and a conversation that Harry wasn’t ready to have yet. In the end, he settled on simple and to the point.
“Harry, hey! There you are—I need you out back for a minute.” She grabbed him by the arm and dragged him out the back door.
“I still can’t believe that Garrett would make that trade,” Malfoy said, as they made the turn out of the gates to the castle grounds.
*          *          *
He bent over and put his face in his hands, sliding his fingers under his glasses.
“And for a long time, all I wanted was to make him happy. I wanted to show him I could do it—I could be the Malfoy he always wanted. I didn’t have to be a disappointment.
Harry didn’t react, a calm rage boiling through his body. He pressed harder, letting his magic flow through his wand, heating up the tip enough to hurt.
was a fluke. Just another example of Harry and Draco’s sheer bad luck. Apparently, when you mixed several forms of Party Pops together and then splashed the resulting mix over two unsuspecting souls, instead of any fun side effects, it had the ability to swap consciousnesses into different bodies. Cleanly. Perfectly. Without any other effect. And no one had any idea how long it would last.
Harry felt a light flush creep up his face. He knew he was going to have to come clean eventually. After taking a long drink, he mumbled, “At Draco’s.”
His body, which had tensed, ready to fight, slowly deflated. He felt like he should be happier to see the man but instead he was overwhelmed by the adrenaline that had so quickly flooded his veins. It was too many times in one day, and he was exhausted.
“I am yours,” Harry said, reaching up and cupping his cheek, expression intense.
of the people in this building.”
Now, there was yet another way he was different. And as much as he hated to give credence to anything the Dursley’s had ever said or thought, he couldn’t help remembering what they said about people like him. Dudley’s taunts about Cedric, the Muggle boys in the neighbourhood and their homophobic slurs, the choice words his aunt and uncle had for “poofs.”
“It sounded like a creak.”
Ginny strongly disagreed with him keeping it a secret and insisted everyone would be okay with it in the long run, but even she couldn’t promise that her parents would take it well at first. They were from a different generation. So, somewhere along the way, he’d decided to stay closeted. It was the easiest choice. His life was already so busy and full; he had work and friends and a family with the Weasleys.
Harry reached up to place it on the top shelf of the cupboard.
“I thought you were meant to be talking me into this!”
“I tried pairing them off yesterday, and it was chaos.”
Harry finished another page of the report before putting down his quill to stretch his neck, letting it crack back into place. The details were still hard to recollect—too many distressing events piled up on each other—but Harry felt lighter than he had in months, or maybe even years. Just knowing this was his last case, that this was the last time he’d have to go through and painstakingly write out all the details of another disturbing case, was enough to get him through.
Harry shook his head at the thought. He supposed stranger things had happened in his life. Before he could dwell on the thought much longer, he watched Emily, the Hufflepuff student who’d been so afraid on her broom the last two weeks, lift and descend perfectly. Harry broke out in a grin and flew to congratulate her. Maybe he could do this after all.
Harry didn’t move for a long moment, afraid to come out from under the thick door that was likely imbued with centuries of Black family magic, probably just as Dark as whatever magic he had been attacked by.
“You’re the best,” Harry muffles into the pillow.
“I think that can be arranged, Teddy.” Harry leaned down and pulled Teddy into a tight hug, before picking up his duffle and grabbing some Floo powder. He turned to Draco and nodded, giving the man a small smile. “Happy Christmas.”
Harry’s chest tightened. He scrubbed his hands over the stubble on his unshaven face as a wave of panic threatened to overwhelm him. When had everything got so complicated? After years of keeping everything under such tight control—doing the right things, staying the course—it was all coming apart. Draco had gusted into his life, toppling Harry's flimsily constructed excuses that he made even to himself. And like a house of cards, they were all coming down. He cleared his throat, trying to get a handle on himself. But as he walked street after street, the lump in his throat never quite cleared.
Harry dropped a kiss on Draco’s messy hair. He knew there was so much to worry about at the moment, but couldn’t find it in him to care about anything outside of that small bedroom in that shitty flat.
“Morning.”
*            *            *
boss,” Ron replied.
Harry made his way over to them, stopping briefly to say hello and hug his other friends. The music was already turned up, and more than a couple people seemed to have got an early start—if Seamus’s off-key singing was anything to go by. He waved to Mel and Jess who were at one of the tables along the wall; he’d stop by and talk to them more later.
Harry whimpers, his body shaking with the need to come, as Draco continues to stroke him in firm motions. He’s unable to stop the thrust of his hips again, crying out as his bollocks stretch from his body. But he can’t stop. His hips continue to rock, even as his bollocks are pulled painfully tight in the process as he chases his release.
“Oh, erm,” one student started. The others looked at each other nervously, but no one spoke. Harry found himself losing his patience. He still had to help Alder and get them started on their next lesson, and he was quickly running out of time.
Harry laughed at the boy’s single mindedness and cast a Tempus. It was a little after six, so Teddy had actually got a good amount more sleep. Harry, on the other hand, felt like he’d just been in a weird daze of a dream as every time he’d started to fall asleep more deeply, he’d been kicked awake. But he’d be back in his own bed that night, so he could sleep as long as he wanted. His chest tightened at the thought of going back to his empty house after this week. He was expected at the Weasley’s for Boxing Day, so he still had plenty of social activities on the horizon, but somehow that didn’t feel the same. Having people to wake up, to share meals with, to have lazy conversations with during the evening… it had been really nice.
Harry huffed a laugh before setting the beer mat back down.
But eventually, the weight of the door became too much. Harry pushed up, but his strength failed.
“Glad to hear it.” At least someone’s case was going well and might see some closure. They were really just wrapping up the loose ends at that point, once the trials were done, at least.
The last scene in Chapter 15 shows magical creatures, including house-elves and human-form werewolves, in captivity. While there will be no graphic violence (only a fight scene between the Auror team and criminals), the concept and imagery of the captivity may be disturbing. This scene/location will continue into the first scene of Chapter 16. (The scene in Chapter 16 will have Harry and Mel taking care of them).
“Not even Robards?” Harry asked, surprised. Of the two of them, Ron was more likely to follow the chain of command.
“Hey, Mel. Have you been seeing any initials?” he asked.
“What?” Harry put his glasses back on. “We knew this operation had been going on for some time from the letters, but he was involved this whole time?”
Harry looked up to see Draco looking at his jumper.
Harry then made his way over to Ron.
As Teddy ran off to the sitting room, yelling something incoherent about Santa, Harry rummaged through his duffle until he found his Weasley jumper from last year. He’d packed a few, just in case, but he usually wore the previous one on Christmas morning. It had become a bit of a tradition even when he just knocked around Grimmauld Place until it was time to go to the Weasleys’ for dinner. He was, of course, welcome anytime, but the noise and chaos got to be a bit much after ten hours, unused to it as he was.
It was still completely quiet upstairs, so after a long minute, Harry sighed and headed to the sitting room. He would give his boyfriend the benefit of the doubt for the moment and try to relax and enjoy the Puddlemere game.
Ron bit at his lip, looking to the distance. “I’d feel better if you got checked out.”
“All finished with your lesson planning?” Malfoy asked. He was already in his professor robes, looking nearly as ominous as Snape when he’d held that same position as Potions professor.
A few minutes later, Draco came back up the stairs, skilfully balancing a tray on a single palm with two steaming mugs, cream, and sugar bowls.
Draco pulls the red vial out of his pocket and uncorks it before holding it out. Harry only hesitates a second before downing it in one. He knows Draco will have done his due diligence to make absolutely sure it’s safe and from a reputable brewer. The potion is thick and sickly sweet, and it takes him a moment to force it down.
Harry watched as a flush slowly crept up Draco’s face as the realisation of what Harry was saying settled in. Draco turned slowly back to the mirror, the deep red flush creeping all the way to the tips of his ears.
Harry screwed up his eyes and shook his head. He didn’t. It was torture, but well within what he could take, well within what he wanted, no matter what his body screamed at the moment.
Waving her wand wide, she cast a H
“Oh,” Percy continued “Well, you should. I heard there’s a new wizarding dating app. You should try it out. I heard from the Director of the Department of International Magical Cooperation that his daughter used it and found her husband within a month.”
“This little furrowed rim of skin,” Draco said, his breath ghosting across the wet skin, as Harry struggled to hold still. “—is one of the most sensitive spots on the entire body. Thousands of nerve endings all ending right here.” Harry couldn’t agree more.
Harry nodded. Draco likely wasn’t wrong there. While the Malfoys might have escaped any real legal consequences, they were widely hated after the war. It had mellowed somewhat as a new generation grew up and came of age. But anyone who had been directly involved in the war wasn’t likely to forget anytime soon. Had Harry not been presented with such a drastically changed Draco several weeks prior, even he’d still have the same opinion of the man as he had during the war.
“And I’ve got a G that’s been in a few, an A and then someone referred to DS What have you found?”
“He’s in the Department of Magical Transportation, Floo Division. Honestly, this might be an even worse lead than Astor,” Harry added.
Ron flipped through the file. “She’s being held in the Ministry holding cells until the trial. I’ll set up an interview.”
“No, really—” Draco was turned toward him now. “There will be a lot of LGBTQ+ folks there, and it could be a chance for you to, I don’t know, be around some people. You don’t have to come out of the closet, or anything; it just might help you to be around people that understand.”
“Wait, what?” Draco sat back and raised his eyebrows.
Harry laughed. “You’re the absolute worst Weasley.”
Foxley was in his mid-twenties, had gone to Hogwarts, and by all accounts was fairly boring. His parents lived in Leeds and were a middle-class wizarding family with no known skeletons in their closet. While the other missing lead, Astor, wasn’t pure-blood, he definitely kept the company of that society. But from everything the Aurors had dug up on Foxley, there was no connection there either—his family was mixed.
Malfoy looked surprised but a bit smug.
“You remember what I’ve told you about being stubborn, right? If you don’t ask for help, I can’t give it to you.”
Draco nodded and worked on relaxing, taking in slow, deep breaths. Then, he felt the shift as his body calmed, his mind slowed. He took another breath and knew he’d be okay. “Green. I’m green, sir.”
“That’s over in Park Royal.” Harry pulled out his phone, looking up the London address on the Muggle internet. A map showed the building in an industrial area with train tracks crisscrossing the area. Using Muggle transport wasn’t unheard of in illegal magical operations. It tended to fly under the radar of most of the magical regulation departments, and a well-placed Obliviate solved any Muggle law enforcement issues. If anything, this address made Harry all the more sure they were on to something here.
A ding and another reply.
The street remained still and silent save for some echoing sounds of train cars in the distance, but Harry could feel the magic in the air as the numerous wards began to drop, one by one. Harry could sense how strong they were, and a sense of foreboding crept over him the longer it took for them all to be disabled. Someone had gone to great lengths to keep unwanted guests out of this warehouse.
“Ever?” Harry asked, surprised.
When they left some time later, they paused just outside the door. Harry wanted to say something, how Draco could call any time, how they could be friends, how he wanted to spend more time with him. But he couldn’t seem to get any of it out.
“I’m not afraid of hard work,” Harry said, defensively.
“Draco, I’m so happy for you.”
“Oh,” Harry replied, relaxing his stance just a little. He took a moment to really look at Malfoy, his eyes were sincere and he looked genuinely contrite. Harry hadn’t thought the man actually had it in him. “You’re apologizing?”
Harry felt a familiar lump in his throat growing—this time, though, not from dread or guilt, but from knowing that Ron meant it—that at the end of the day he cared more about Harry as a person. Harry cleared his throat and took a deep breath. “Thanks, Ron.”
“I think Harry should make his own decisions,” Hermione said firmly. Harry shot her a grateful smile, even if it did nothing to derail the conversation.
“Work has been busy, sorry.”
Most of the others seemed to be holding their own as well, and Harry finally found Bradbourn duelling a younger witch along the far south wall. It looked like he’d lost ground, and he had been pushed back mid-fight.
His mind wandered as he towelled off, his work woes quickly forgotten as he wondered what Harry would have in store. Harry had told him that if he was good, maybe he’d get to come this weekend. That wasn’t a promise, but Draco knew his husband well. And after a week in chastity, his first week, Draco knew he had some fun in store for him. This was the longest he’d ever gone, and every nerve ending felt on high alert after a week of fucking, of teasing, and absolutely no contact to his cock.
“Yeah. It’s, well… not going. We’ve got nothing.” Harry was sure to never get into too many details with his family, confidentiality and all, but Ron and he often discussed the broad strokes of their cases.
“Fuck, shit—” Draco holds his hand out in a panic as slick lube drips down his arm and pours off his fingers onto his and Harry’s legs.
“Okay. I’ve got it.” He settled back into the sofa. At least his body was happy about that choice, even if his mind couldn’t stand not being up and moving around. “Well, I’d offer you tea, but this stubborn houseguest is forcing me to stay on my sofa.”
It wasn’t until they had attended a weekend retreat for Ginny’s Quidditch team that it had finally come to a head. The Holyhead Harpies players, their significant others, and families had all been invited to a fun weekend away before the start of another season.
“So, the yoghurt thief,” Harry said.
It’s so much more intense. Normally, it would take some impact play or nipple clamps before Harry’s nipples would be this sensitive. He continues to moan and squirm as Draco plays with his nipple, twisting, pulling, pinching it hard.
Harry breathes a sigh of relief as he very carefully closes the door. The twins finally are down for their nap, James is busy with his game again, and Harry is determined to break Draco and his dry spell.
cast, wands collected, and we cast
And then she slowed down, started to tire. He watched as she cast a spell, her arm dropping slightly from the exertion. The spell bounced off his shield, easily repelled. He waited. When she cast again, he made sure to watch her arm. Her spell glanced off the shield, and with lightning speed, Harry dropped the shield and sent a powerful stunner her way. Magic rippled out from the force of it, gusting across Harry as he felt it move across his skin and hair.
“Malfoy,” Harry said before dropping a wet kiss to the top of Draco’s cock. “Shut up and let me have my way with you.” And with that, he wrapped his fingers around Draco’s cock, pushing back the foreskin and then, careful to cover his teeth, slowly took Draco in.
“No idea what you’re talking about,” Draco replied with a gleam in his eye.
Harry’s eyes flicked upward and Draco could see him replaying the conversation, looking a little less sure when he met Draco’s eyes again. “But you know I’d never—”
Harry fell back on the pillow and covered his face with his hands, mortification creeping in. He knew there was a gap of experience between them; he was very aware of that. But he wasn’t a child.
Malfoy turned, brows furrowed. “No, that can’t be it.”
Harry felt himself pulled back and shook his head to clear his thoughts.
“Go take a long thorough shower, cast a vision-correcting charm, and meet me in the playroom.”
Harry grabbed the bowl of stuffing, piling some on his plate before passing it to Draco.
Harry sighed. “What’s your name again?”
“Show off.”
Sometimes Harry would sit under Draco’s desk, Draco’s cock heavy on his tongue, his mouth keeping him warm. Other times, Draco would put him on the wall, casting a spell that chained Harry in place, flogging him on his breaks from work. Once, Draco had Harry simply kneel on a pillow, naked and legs spread, for the duration—there only to be at Draco’s beck and call, even if he was never needed. Draco hadn’t touched him once, and Harry had remained rock hard for the entire afternoon.
“Yes,” Harry answered thinking of his seventh-year lessons an hour ago. Watching Milo perfect the Jones Misdirect had been amazing. The whole class had cheered Milo on. And Harry loved watching everyone else’s progress, as well.
Draco looked up at him, his eyelids heavy, before grasping Harry’s sides and pulling him closer. Harry closed his eyes and tried to let go, forget about everything else and get lost in the moment—in the soft moans, the gentle caresses. His heart clenched with just how much he cared for Draco, how much he loved him already. Harry knew what their relationship had been turning into over the past few weeks, but he still found himself surprised at just how deep it ran.
“Okay, Jacob. I’m going to immobilise your leg so that we don’t do any more damage to it on the way to the infirmary.” Harry looked at the student for confirmation. Once Jacob nodded, Harry cast the spell. Fortunately, he’d picked up a few essential spells from his years playing professionally. He wouldn’t trust himself to do the mending, but he could at least get students to and from the infirmary safely. Hiding a grimace, he hoped this wasn’t a skill he was going to be using with any sort of regularity.
Harry moaned loudly above him, and Draco grabbed Harry’s hips, pressing them back, holding Harry still as he ran his tongue up his cock from root to tip. He dipped his tongue in the slit, tasting the pre-come that had gathered there, before wrapping his mouth just around the head, teasing it with his tongue until Harry was panting and whining.
As Draco approached, drinks in hand, Paulo leaned in towards Harry, his muscular back flexing through his fitted robes. “Ah, Harry we must get drinks soon and watch a game. Box seats for the team of your choice.”
Harry ignored him, putting his glass on the coffee table as he beelined straight for the door. This whole night had been an absolutely terrible idea. What had he been thinking?
Once Draco’s thigh and calf relaxed, Harry moved to the other leg, slowly undoing the ropework. The sensations were as arousing this time around, but Draco was too relaxed, too floaty to react much. He sighed as his leg was released, shivered when the rope grazed a sensitive part of his body, but his body stayed pliant, calm.
“You don’t look so hot yourself,” he replied once the pain in his side had dulled to an ache.
Draco must get the sense it’s not going down smoothly because a moment later, he’s got his wand out, conjuring a glass and filling it with water before pressing it into Harry’s hand. Harry takes a long drink to clear the syrupy potion from his throat before saying his thanks.
“—I started thinking about wizarding pubs. So I checked out the other competition, and frankly, the pub scene in wizarding Britain leaves a lot to be desired. So I thought, well, I could bring what I know about trendy Muggle pubs into wizarding London.”
Harry thought about the frenzy of reporters hanging around the Ministry and decided a trip through Diagon Alley wasn’t on the top of his list of things he wanted to do.
Harry sat down on the edge of the bed. The strain of the day was hitting him, and the potion was wearing off. He found his eyes were drooping shut and he fought to stay awake. It was a losing battle, so he toed off his shoes and laid down on the bed, resting his head on one of the pillows. A faint trace of Draco’s cologne, woodsy and a little sweet clung to the pillows, and Harry couldn’t stop himself from turning his head into it. He inhaled deeply, letting a sense of peace settle over him, and fell asleep almost immediately.
Draco’s eyes widened momentarily. “I didn’t mean that as an insult! I always liked Dobby.”
“Next Thursday, so we’ll need to move quickly on this.”
Determined to feel all the spots that he’d likely missed in their drunken hookups, Harry took his time, unable to stop a full-body shiver as his hands travelled up his sides, along his firm stomach, across his pebbling nipples. Draco let him go on like that until Harry finally threw his head back with a moan, unsure how much more self-teasing he could take.
*          *          *
“No, it’s fine. I was just being paranoid.” Draco smiled.
“Right. Yeah, I remember that. The pepperoni was good,” Ellis added.
Draco groaned as he watched Harry’s fingers wrap around his cock again, but this time, instead of light teasing touches or the firm pull of an edging hand job, Harry held it in place as he sunk down and wrapped his lips around it.
Draco shifts slightly and Harry inches forward, sitting back on his heels and letting himself relax into the plush rug under his shins. He makes sure to keep his arms behind his back, even though Draco likely wouldn’t know if he moved. That’s not the point. Harry wants to submit, wants to do his boyfriend’s bidding.
Harry opened his mouth to warn him, but couldn’t get anything out before Draco had centred himself in front of it. He braced himself for Draco’s reaction. Harry had no idea what his friend would see there. Like Harry, he’d worked through so much of his baggage, but Harry knew there were still wounds there that would never go away. Draco froze, his eyes widening as he looked into the mirror. A series of complicated emotions passed over his face, and then he put a hand over his mouth.
They shared a look before leaning in to read the new words.
“You know,” she continued as she walked back around the table. “Agnus’s son is gay, and I think he’s single.”
Draco sighed. “I knew it would likely come to that when I had the idea. I just…”
Harry let out a surprised laugh. “What?”
“Green, sir.”
“That’s true,” Malfoy replied with a frown.
Harry nodded, surprised at her candidness.
It took him far too long to work out what she meant by the question. And then, when it clicked, he vehemently denied that was the problem. She didn’t continue to press but asked him to think about it.
“You and me…” Harry looked back at the mirror, and then with a jolt it hit him. He spun to face Draco. “Wait,
“Justin?” Harry whipped his head around. “He was not.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Well, no, but you sure sound like you’re afraid of failure.”
Harry walked back into the office with two mugs of tea, careful not to upset the parchment spread out over his desk. Mel was muttering quietly to herself as she jotted down notes in her notepad. They’d been at it all day.
The lift dinged and he dragged his feet to his office. Mel was already there, hunched over some paperwork at her desk.
Where he’d expected to see crates for transit, illegal potions or artefacts, there were cages. Some were small, but many were as large as a room. Numerous cages filled with living, breathing beings—magical creatures and beings of all shapes and sizes.
Harry nodded. He’d had very much the same thought.
Laughter broke out on the far side of the training room where Higgins and Perry were sparring.
There were two registered Floos at Malfoy Manor: one in the ground floor sitting room and one in Lucius’ study. Neither showed any activity for the previous days. Narcissa had told the Aurors that she had left the Manor grounds and apparated directly to her gardening club. Lucius apparently preferred to travel by Floo, wanting to avoid the long walk of the drive in order to apparate outside of their very strict wards. The records showed that no one had gone in or out that day.
“Yes, I now see I should have just got you a pint and been done with it.” Draco nudged Harry’s knee with his knee and winked.
The woman shrugged. “Don’t see why not. He didn’t even bother to get his post stopped.”
“Thank you, Auror Potter. Unfortunately, the SSC squad has no new information. An Avada Kedavra would be the most likely candidate, but even though that wouldn’t leave any traces on the body, we’d still pick up residue in the room—particularly with that powerful of a spell. All of the tests we ran onsite showed no spell residue beyond the embedded household charms and a few low-level charms that line up with Mr Malfoy’s wand results and previous spells.”
“He wasn’t removed from the wards, was he?” Harry asked.
Malfoy huffed out a laugh. “Merlin, let’s hope it’s not on purpose.”
Harry’s in a mood though, so he simply smiles and keeps up the slow circular motion as he swirls his tongue around the head of Draco’s cock. Usually, this is Draco’s game—the slow teasing and building of desperation—but Harry developed an appreciation for it over the years. Plus, he learned from the best.
“You won’t let anything happen to them,” Ron said. And he was right. Harry would protect them with his life. “I’ll send help as soon as I can—just take care of them as best you can.”
“In August. Probably the second week—it was right after we went to that new restaurant just a few blocks outside of Diagon Alley.”
Draco finally pulls off with a pop and sighs. “Too drunk?”
“They are but they’re still sentient,” Hermione answered, as she cut a piece off her roast.
“Can I at least start going through the evidence while I’m just sitting at home?” Harry asked. There was no way he was going to be able to sleep away the next few days now, knowing what he did.
Monday morning found Harry buried in case notes and evidence as he flipped through yet another file of a witch connected to Ernest Foxley, the missing wizard from Floo Regulation. Even though they had pulled the files during the previous week, Mel and Harry were still making their way through them. They’d been working day and night on the case for nearly two weeks, and he was pretty sure his blood pressure was reaching unstable heights. There weren’t enough solid connections, so everything just felt like drudgery—pointless work that was leading to nowhere. Mel was looking like she was in the same boat, given her generally greyish complexion as of late.
“I think I might finally believe you,” he looked over at her with a small smile. “But just don’t tell anyone yet, I need to do this at my own pace.”
“Hey,” Harry replied, voice rough with sleep.
The week might have started off rough, but this moment was perfect. It was all the sweeter for all the struggles they’d gone through for the past five days, with Harry and Draco learning how to be responsible caretakers and Teddy learning that they weren’t only there for his every whim. Harry knew he’d still spoil his godson in the future; he just couldn’t help it. But he also hoped that going forward, he’d be able to provide Teddy with some structure, to be an adult that he could learn to look up to. He also really hoped that Andromeda would trust them with Teddy again for longer stays. This week had been special.
“Now eat something, you’re too skinny,” she said with a warm smile.
Harry nodded, feeling a bit overwhelmed to hear his feelings mirrored in Malfoy’s sentiments. It had felt completely out of control at the time, but all the other players and the coach just kept telling him it came with the territory. Harry didn’t remember any of the other players being unable to walk through Diagon Alley, however, or having to spend every waking minute in a polyjuice disguise when they weren’t home. Or being afraid for their friends and family members as private addresses were leaked to the public.
Have you forgotten that?

You ignore whichever man has spoken, choosing instead to slide your tongue once more into the slick, gaping hole in front of you, sucking lightly at the puffed ring. Harry exhales loudly, debased groan echoing in the taut silence; you hear a twin gasp, muffled, from one of your voyeurs.
Somehow, the prospect of falling wasn’t so damning, as long as he fell with you.
," in his ear.
Lee Jordan is slouched against the side of the couch the twins have claimed. Clad only in a pair of jocks, clothes lying discarded to the floor, the low light catches the slight sheen of sweat covering his chest, throwing tan skin into relief. His hand is slid beneath his pants, waistband stretched over wrist, fingers loosely skimming trapped hardness.
You tilt your hips up, urging him deeper, faster, his face buried between two pale, rounded globes, your insistent hands in his hair insurance that he doesn’t stop. Somewhere along the way, in between garbled pleas and breathy grunts, you realise that it’s him; the Wizarding World’s fucking
“Long story short, they decided that I wasn't entitled to the mark. Their solution was acid. Humorous, really, that muggle haters would stoop to something so muggle. Perhaps it was an analogy for what I had become.” He paused. “Have you ever seen human flesh disintegrate? Smelled the astringent stench that emerges as you’re forced to watch skin and fat, muscle, sinew, be devoured by such a formidable foe? Have you ever
Draco could have commented that it was in fact Potter who boasted the legendary scar. He could have screamed at him, cursed him for his family's downfall, his mother's pain and Draco's demise. Asked him how dare he show up, looking as filthy and fucked as him, when Potter had had the world on a platter.
Potter stepped closer to him, and fuck, Draco hadn't been looked at like that for a very long time; like he wasn't just a piece of meat. "When did you get so humble?"

It is one thing to wish for the unattainable. Another to have it presented in a naked, shuddering heap on your lap.
Plastic and rubber and pungent, bitter wrongness; numbing, stinging, filling his mouth, unable to be dislodged.
The darkness is creeping, and this oblivion promises to taste the sweetest.
And now you weren't.
and whilst you may not be the first, you sure as shit want to be the last.
"A what?" he asks, momentarily distracted from the earth-shattering revelation of Draco's affection.
“It fucking does. Tell me, Draco.”
There’s comfort in familiarity. It was this familiarly that called to him, when seconds or minutes or hours later, his home - his sanctuary - appeared before him. His hideaway under the overpass, blankets ratty, threadbare, grimy but
"You're in my bed, Potter, and I'm close to passing out." Potter made no indication that he had heard Draco, continuing to obsessively stroke his wrist, so he threw caution to the wind. If Potter had wanted him dead, he would have been dead, and Draco was long past caring what others thought of him and how he chose to survive. Instead, he shuffled over the compacted dirt floor and collapsed beside his once-enemy, pulling a smelling blanket over him to ward off the cold. "You don't flinch when you see me. People normally do."
Eventually he found his way to his feet, propping himself against the cool stone of a building. He lent his face against the brick, letting the cooling damp soothe his throbbing head. Morning was coming, and Draco needed to get back home, lest some unsuspecting muggle find him and complicate his life even more. There was a reason he was banned from the shelters scattered around the city. The price for showing his face at any one of them again would be death.
Harry's trembling, pressing his arse back needily against your pelvis, whimpering when the leaking head of your cock brushes his entrance, and you know you cannot prolong
Harry seats himself beside Draco. Rear on the stone, legs over the edge, their shoulders brushing with the movement of Draco’s hand. It feels like the first contact he’s had since Hogwarts, unfurling something inside him he hadn’t known was clenched. Despite the distant shutters enclosing Draco’s eyes, his telling silence, Harry still feels a connection to him. A tether, a pull, drawing them closer.
Draco.
Once, you confided how I’d saved you, too. Gave you a life you’d thought impossible. I told you then, and I’ll tell you now: you’re more than capable of defying fate on your own.
"Better," the voice concedes, and Harry remembers with a jolt that although he cannot see more than the light-speckled black veiling his eyes, the other man can. "The sooner you learn your place for the night, the sooner we can begin to play." He sounds like a cat stalking his prey, this other man, addictive and heady, toying with Harry before going for the kill. He can feel the air move around him, the electric caress of another body stood just out of range. If he reached out a hand, it would connect with the others.
A teenage delusion, assuredly. But you’re seized with irrational bitterness until an impatient huff wrenches you from your jealousy and you conclude that
"Or if you're after a more formal tone, something along the lines of-" he delicately clears his throat, before proving his new-found genius for improv with:
Fuck it. Let the destruction fuel you. You've come too far now to turn away, and despite the fact that you think you could lie here forever with his lips on your skin, you’re all too scared of losing this one glorious opportunity. Your hands come to rest at his waist and abruptly you push him away, smirking as he lands with an exclamation in a heap on the ground. He can take it, has taken worse. You slither off the bed and crawl towards him, basking in the way his eyes lower and head slumps back, the slight opening of his still pant covered legs. With a predatory leer, you grab them and pull them off, an obscene whine audible as you note the lack of underwear.
His mouth opens and closes several times before he manages to speak, and when he does it’s barely a whisper. “Potter,” he says, and his shoulders hunch even more. His eyes are flickering to Harry and away again, each time landing on a slightly different spot. It’s as if Draco can’t quite believe he’s real, which is something Harry understands. How long has he waited for confirmation of his own illusion? Draco’s hand moves forward slightly into the space between their two bodies before he hastily clamps it back down at his side. “What are you doing here?” he eventually questions.
Your groan is audible when he unexpectedly drops to his knees and presses his face audaciously into your crutch, inhaling in a way that makes you shudder with awkwardness and indisputable lechery. You throw your head back with a moan as his fingers come to land on the waistband of your pants, pulling them down with no heed to the expensive material. They pool comically around your ankles, leaving you clad only in a pair of jocks which strain around your cock’s passionate bid for escape. His breath is hot against your length; a glorious, prodigious,
Now, when Harry pictures farewell, Draco’s beside him.
The chains - manacles, cuffs for all Harry knows - jangle again. He's sure the man is doing it on purpose, a sound meant to put him on edge. It's working, although if it's trepidation the man's after he'll be disappointed. Harry's filled with plenty of distress, a fucking cornucopia of

You hold him like that, and you wank him – clumsily, fervently, certainly not your best  – but that’s all it takes before he’s coming, head thrown back and arse constricting around your dick, smearing the mirror with streaks of cum. He’s beautiful like this,
"You will not let go of the handles. You will not close your legs. You will stay as fucking still as humanly possible, or so help me Merlin, I'll strap you to that Judas Cross in the public room and let every sadist in England have a turn at your back."
Using the wall to support himself, Draco made his way to the mouth of the alley where he took stock of his surroundings, noting with grim pleasure that he wasn't too far from his bed. Fifteen long minutes later and he was rounding the bend, overpass in sight and below it, his refuge. Ducking under a concrete beam he jerked to a stop, confronted with the sight of another person sitting against the supporting pillar of the bridge, a ratty blanket thrown over their legs.

“What did they do?” Gritted out, between clenched teeth.
That’s all the proof you need, and you close the tiny, infinitesimal gap.
"Pants."
The man is beautiful.

The pendulum swings. Years pass in the rise and fall of respiration.
But not tonight. This, right now, you and him. Raw, unrefined, passionate and desperate. That's what you need.
So when the taste of rubber leaves his tongue, it's Draco who removes the obstruction. The sweet, earthy salt of human skin comes from Draco's fingers, as Harry obligingly lets them fill his mouth; as if he has any choice in what this man feeds him. That recedes too, into what feels like an eternity of emptiness until it is replaced, perhaps somewhat hesitantly, perhaps even gently, with a primal musk and bitter hint Harry would know anywhere. A mere tease, a drop, across his lips and tongue before it too is abruptly gone, but belonging to Draco nevertheless.

Harry just grinned, and Draco looked down to see two perfect lighting bolt cuts on his thighs. A fitting end, both having given something that had been forced upon them a new meaning.
Harry knows this exterior as an old friend. Has walked the path of pale stone too many times to count, the crunch of pebble underfoot now synonymous with the crack of a cane, the hiss and rub of rope, the smell of sweat and blood and cum, this anonymous stage for base needs and primal instinct.
- carding through Fred's hair as the other twin sucks his brother off. You can hear Fred from here. Whimpered groans dampened by the obstacle of cock, a huff of breath exhaled. It's a mesmerising sight: identical bodies stripped, uncaring of company. You watch Fred. Fred watches George. George watches you. A hedonistic cycle you'd abandon yourself to in a heartbeat, if you could ever bring yourself to leave Harry's side.

Make sure you read the final chapter before this; I posted them at the same time.
Narcissa looked at Harry, her own demeanor held together by a single thread. “You’re not alone, Draco. Not anymore.”
"Help me, Magnus," Harry blurts, eyes more than a little wild as he fixes Magnus with an imploring look. It's pitiful, all of it: the semi-pissed, tousled Harry, the endless conversations of Draco; Magnus, himself, and the fond exasperation he feels towards the younger boy. He feels himself thaw slightly and that's it. He's fucked. Despite the resentment he outwardly portrays at somehow finding himself in the position of a rather underqualified therapist slash love-guru, Magnus can't deny he wouldn't be opposed to finally seeing the pair together - he's always been a whore for a gay-ever-after. Indeed, he predicts he'd feel somewhat smug at his hand in the whole thing. Never mind the added bonus of a cease in Draco-related, Thursday eve winging.
So gone he almost misses the resonance of his name ripped brokenly from between gritted teeth as he's followed into euphoria.
Flight.
Harry.
Then there’s Draco. The boy who had not exposed him, nor readily acquiesced to a desperate tyrant, drunk on fictions putrid and sweet - willingly naive for an illusory ending.  Instead, he’d walked away. A boy, who, in the end, had been
Harry cries out brokenly and Magnus turns, taking in the desperate clutch of Harry's fingers around Draco's hips, the breathy moans, the hiss of dragonhide against denim, the fact that two men were rutting in Magnus' chair and seemingly on the brink of orgasm.
-  have the strength to stray from the past.
The key was to never give a reaction. No tears, no screams. No begs to stop when blood was trickling down his legs from his brutalised ass.
Harry sighs. Changed or not, Draco’s still bloody hard work. His fingers slide unconsciously under the string around his wrist, worrying it back and forth. “Are you happy?” He regrets the question immediately; Draco’s fists clench and his expression turns incredulous. It’s the most animated Harry has seen him since...
Draco’s voice was quiet. “Yes.”
“I’ve been falling for a long time, Draco” Harry murmured, an unintentional mimicry of his own personal dilemma. “But I think you can catch me.”
In a show of what may be kindness but is more probably a selfish attempt to stave off instant climax, the man stills once Harry's impaled, eyes squeezed shut in concentration or content. Under the mesh, his chest is beaded with sweat, hair sticking to the curve of his neck, pants pushed haphazardly to mid-thigh, utterly indecent. "Merlin's scrotum," he mutters, and Harry's surprised by the laugh that bubbles from his mouth, how the motion seems to quell an inch of the fire in his arse. He wriggles cautiously, testing.
"You're still here" he stated.
You made me feel loved. I'd never understood, before, the power those three words held. I had thought myself beyond hope; you showed me I’d simply been waiting for you.
. Now, in the endless cycle of day and night, he weeps for the children they had been. What they’d had, gullible to the belief it could never be lost. Hope. Purpose. Drive. The conflagration of emotion. Each other.
I’m sorry. Forgive me.
Harry's low whine brings your attention back to him. Spine dipped, arse raised; beautifully, irresistibly, shameless. You slide your hands down oiled thighs, stroke the sensitive flesh on the inner side, palm his balls before tugging the wrinkled skin. His moan is guttural and you dig your fingers into the rounded globes of his arse cheeks, thumbs either side of his crack. Pulling him open, exposing him, revealing the quivering hole of musk and debauchery for all to see.
“I care about you.”
"He's Draco Malfoy," Magnus comments lazily from where he's sprawled in a chair by the fire, an amber-filled tumbler loose in his grip. This is approximately the 394th time he's had to listen to Harry's grouching, and whilst at the start he did honestly attempt to listen, it's now at the point where the odd comment or sympathetic hum is all he can muster. Centuries-old, and this is the pathetic low he's come to fall on.
"No. You've simply lost your mind after being a self-imposed hermit for so many years.”

Down, not across, and the skin tears easily under the sharp edge. The other wrist, and now the blood is flowing, running in free-form rivers down my palms, twisting between my fingers.

'. I'll have a hard time not jumping you myself."
He feels exposed. Under scrutiny. The centrepiece of some convoluted art installation, waiting to be declared unworthy or inspired by the fortuitous roll of the dice.
It could have been minutes, hours, weeks, an eternity; at some point between then and now, Harry finds he can smell again. It's sharp, abrasive, a bouquet of aromas bombarding him from all sides. Every mote of fragrance burns his nostrils, and he sucks it in hungrily, headily, desperate for the scent of life, affirmation of the dissipation of naught.
What it felt like to submit.
Your hand on my knee. The brush of fingers against my back. Breath on my neck, arm around my waist, your warmth keeping me safe whilst we slept. Soft words and even softer lips; your voice. I didn't realise that loving you encompassed so much.
Harry knows it wasn’t them who’d renounced what they’d had. It was him who didn’t - still
From the far end of the street, a figure emerges.
"Have you been good for me, pet?" the man murmurs in Harry's ear, voice like sex and velvet and all things wanton. Harry can only whimper, high and needy, beautifully depraved and yet disgustingly pathetic; how he's fallen to such levels with mere sound, taste, smell. The stranger laughs lowly, Draco's laugh in Harry's mind. "Look at you squirm. You've been enjoying my game, it seems," he continues, "although for someone chained as you are, you manage to writhe rather delightfully." Harry hears something he can only describe as a licentious purr shudder from his own lips, and the man laughs again. "Utterly shameless, aren't you? I bet I could make you come from nothing other than my voice if I so desired to see you blow your load inside your pants." Another broken groan, the sound of a button pulled through denim, the rasp of fabric moved over bare skin. When faux-Draco speaks again, it's with a tinge of amusement. "It appears I should probably stop talking."
“It doesn't matter” Draco hurried, placating.
“Narcissa was right, Draco, when she said you weren't alone. I promise, we will do something about her situation. We just need some time.” Harry’s voice was gentle, muffled against his hair.
"Walk forward until you touch the wall."
Harry moved, and abruptly Draco was pulled into a soft lap, Harry’s arms winding around him to hold him tight against his chest. Draco stiffened briefly before yielding to the embrace, his head coming to nestle in the warm crook of Harry’s shoulder while he was rocked as one might an upset baby. He breathed in the now-familiar scent of Harry, letting the heat which permeated the worn cotton of Potter’s shirt soothe him and dry his tears.
At the sound of Harry’s voice, Draco pulls himself away. “I fell. It’s nothing.” He’s not even trying; that’s the part which hits Harry the hardest. With strangulation marks around his neck, a black eye and bruised cheek, the man who’d always had a snarky retort - who’d never let another see him weak - was now proclaiming ‘
"Lovely bird you have there," Harry settles for instead, throwing The Manager a bland smile and reaching for the scroll, uncurling the parchment with a slight yet awfully sarcastic flourish of his wrist. He barely glances at the contents before signing his rights to all aspects of human decency away with a scrawl from the ink-dipped raven feather proffered by The Manager, who barely entertains more than a smug twitch of his lip throughout the small power struggle. Harry's not concerned about the waiver; he's signed more than one since he began attending such libertine establishments, but his inability to faze The Manager is somewhat disconcerting.
You look back to the mirror. He’s been watching you, anything but discreet. A grin settles across his mouth. Your heart skips a beat.
Your cock is hard and flushed. You've drawn this torturous prelude out far longer than usual. Wanting Harry begging for it; wanting your audience desperate themselves. It's all part of the game. You, Harry, on display for whoever has found their way to the room that night. Oh, you enjoy it - there's no doubt about that. Revel in the eyes fixed on your every movement, the hitched intakes of breath, the slap of palms against cocks, the knowledge that it's you and him they're jerking off to. That's where it ends for you, however. Flattered ego and narcissistic delight, yet nothing further profound. But
“Potter”, you manage to choke out stiffly once the silence becomes unbearable. “Harry,” you amend, and the name feels foreign on your tongue.

“Hey.” Harry’s voice is ragged and low, yet it carries easily on the still air, noise ill and out of place in the silence. Draco flinches, head jerking up, body seizing and seeming to curl upon itself. He stares at Harry. There’s an emptiness in his eyes Harry recognises from his own, a dullness he knows reaches to the core. Draco’s hair is long, past the line of his shoulders, tall frame still slim.  He appears well dressed, clothes tailored nicely if not a little lose, although the stark whiteness of his shirt only emphasises the gaunt shadows under his eyes. There’s also a fragility to him. An unseen haze which lingers. He looks as if the slightest wind would break him; or perhaps he’s already broken.
His feet touch down with a creak from the old floorboards. The kitchen blinds are drawn, dust motes floating lazily in the few weak strips of dawn light managing to penetrate the slats. He goes through the motions of tea making in a trance, mind only pulled from thoughts of Draco when an absent gulp from the mug promptly scalds his mouth. “Merlin fuck,” he splutters as the cup slips from his fingers, hitting the floor.  It’s stupid and ridiculous, but he can’t stop the brief conviction
Draco glances between him and the biro with apprehension. “No, Potter. I don’t tend to carry stationary in my pockets. Unlike you.”
He hears his stranger reposition, ground himself.
He falls asleep faster that night than he has the last sixty-four.
The house is too quiet in your absence, and I keep making tea for two. I miss you.
“I prefer my actions to go unrecorded.” Draco straightens his robes unnecessarily. “Although nothing you need to worry about, Potter.”
He had failed the light, he had failed the dark; and in turn they had both cast him out.
His muffled groans when he finds what he was looking for; as if that tiny, tight hole of debauchery and musk was ambrosia, straight from the Gods.
“There isn't anyone good left. That’s what the war achieved; the destruction of anyone pure. They shouldn't have died in vain.”
When he was seventeen he learned that the pain of punishment carried far beyond the walls of his home, or even past the dank filth of the streets where he had been cast. That it wasn't contained to the beatings, the jeers of other, the agony of degradation.
With a strangled curse that has your balls drawing tight, Harry shudders and spills his climax to the floor. His untouched cock smears sweat and fluids on the ground as he convulses on your length, whimpers caught between red lips dragging you to the cusp of your own culmination.

, for you. Still would. But you've gone, and the dark that had receded temporarily in your presence is back, its ever demanding hunger even more irresistible, the compulsion to cut, to bleed, a seductive temptress.
Eleven also happened to be the year he knew punishment. The abuse his mother took nothing compared to the bite of a whip or the sting of a hex; failure to be perfect had its consequences. Rules and regulations no joking matter as a Crucio was cast.
Harry regards the new owl, which has retreated to the relative safety of his second favourite candelabrum, possibly to either calculate the exact angle required to shit on Harry's head or as instructed to ensure the preservation of its original colouration, from above the rim of his glasses. He thinks the club is taking the whole owl thing a tad too far. Indeed, Harry himself had found owl one -
“Draco. Please. Tomorrow.” He can hear his neediness; doesn't care.
For a fleeting moment, you let yourself imagine what it would be like if you let yourself submit. Just once. Just for the night. To bite down, and feel the smooth rubber of a ball gag lodged between teeth. The burn of raw wrists which have fought against course rope, the ache in your shoulders from having them bound above your head for too long. Feel the trickle of blood as it runs over clammy skin. The pull of the cuts it originated from, put there in pain and lust; begged for with a whimper which couldn't be denied.  Know what it felt like, to stand bare before a mirror the morning after, fingers skimming over the weals made by another's hand, feel the hitch in your breathing and know that tonight, you would plead for more.

“We will make him.”
One. Two, three.
Harry shatters. The coup de grâce, and with it the intoxicating nihility he craves. He's feral, floating, flying.
It’s amazing; the best you’ve ever had. The best you’ve ever felt. But you knew it would be from the start. His and your conclusion was never going to be ordinary.
"Sir," The Manager greats in tones of honey and oil and draped velveteen, a voice Harry is occasionally known to imagine whispering instruction in his ear, even if the body behind it does little for his lust. This body, at least, to be more precise; the air around the man undulates ever so slightly, and although it has crossed Harry's mind before to enquire about the need for disillusionment, in time he's come to accept it. The Manager gestures Harry inside, closing the door behind him with a soft click and regarding him with eyes far too sharp in the plush luxury of the room. "Mr Potter. A pleasure to see you, as always. Please take a seat, old bean."
"- so uptight," Harry continues, and Magnus murmurs in response, not entirely sure what he's replying to. 1879 had been an excellent year and the last of that particular reserve. "Every time I try talk to him, he makes a quick escape and gaps it out the room."
“Twenty-seven days, Potter.” Draco’s voice rasps on his name. “Near a month since I’ve last been.”
, an exhaustive cross-examination presented all in the name of one supposedly unforgettable night of depravity. A two-hundred-and-twelve-answers-long dissertation of the various ways, positions, soft limits, hard limits, turn-ons and turn-offs in which Harry James Potter resolutely does not hope that Draco Malfoy, in some octuré play of Fate's dice, is a man behind a mask.
The letters arrive at precisely eight forty-three on the eve of March Second by the way of tawny barn owl through a carelessly ajar window. Upon spotting Harry slumped, languid, at his oak dining table, the owl gives a small hoot before proceeding to drop its cargo directly onto the glossy pages of Witch Weekly, obscuring the airbrushed face of Draco Malfoy and near giving Harry a paper cut to the nose. Delivery complete, the owl retreats to a beam near the apex of the ceiling, possibly to await further instruction, contemplate the exact angle required to shit on Harry's third favourite chair, or engage in any number of obscure things owls are known to do when passing time, none of which Harry knows of himself, although suspects are destructive in nature.
"Surely not," Magnus fake-gasps. By the dirty look thrown at him, he's overdone it. Serves Harry right, the scotch-decimating cretin.
You know you should move, get up, return the favour. You want it,
"Look at you, filthy fucking whore. No better than dog shit, certainly smell like it. Well go on then. Suck it, dick pig."
+++++++++++
It was your name he breathed. You're certain; sane.
“It’s okay, Potter. No one expects you to be happy.” Draco’s voice is soft, palm ghosting across Harry’s jaw.
Iniquity has taught him much over the past seven years; he'd unearthed himself within the shadowed haven it offered, unknowing until then he'd needed to be found. It was in their alcoves where he discovered what he needed, what it meant to want something different than others. What it felt like to bend until he broke and then be rebuilt whole.
"Take off your shirt."
The snap of a whip hisses through the air, echoing thunderous and sharp in his ear.
Then you snap your hips forward, entering the sweet clench of Harry in one single stroke, hitting home as a hedonistic cry drawn forcibly from between his gritted teeth rings in your ears.
Down, not across: an instruction.
and conquering every inch of himself until he's reduced to nothing more than the sharp cut of bitter and only a flicker of what it meant to be Harry.
Fuck.
He is fire and ice and everything in between; numb, hypersensitized. The constant scent of citrus is his only alleviation from the utter ruination of mind and body, the single thread of sanity proffered to navigate the callous, cimmerian maze of sensation. He longs to cry out, would plead on bleeding knees if his voice could utter anything more than broken whimpers.
this, want and demand and long for it. Desire and deprivation, you devour sensation like the starved deviant he swears you're not.
It's worse than the platform of purgatory, the killing curse, crucio; any and all pain gained and survived, ever felt.
The hands on him moved, one rubbing soft circles on his back, the other cupping his knee.
A crash sounds from Harry's direction. Magnus turns his head just in time to see Mrs Chonk artfully sidestep the crystal decanter she had just knocked over, leaping with as much grace as a rotund cat of her size could from the drinks cabinet to Harry's lap.
His feet, encased in black combat and laced to the shin, are muffled on the polished kauri floor, even the wood here unwilling to divulge clues of the walker for trespassing ears with intent to harm.
Draco bows his head slowly in agreement, the shift in shadow throwing his cheek into relief and highlighting sickly, discoloured bruises. He realises his mistake as it happens, jerking his face back into gloom. Too late, however; Harry had already seen. How could he
Harry.
To be beaten and bruised. Degraded, destroyed, rejuvenated. Flung into euphoria over and over, a high that lulled the harsh bite of the cane into a soothing caress. A trance that offered escapement; the fogged mind of abandonment. The care that came after the blows had rained down, heady needs fulfilled.
A promise that set Draco’s body alight.
When he was seventeen he knew desperation. To please. To do what was expected. To do what was right.
’ in its direction, watching smugly as the spell obliterates the ceramic. The glow of the sun is growing brighter around the edges of the blinds and he can hear the outside world slowing waking up,  can feel his body shutting down in return. He’s not quite ready for bed yet, though. Not ready to part with the day that’s brought him closer to...
If you won't come to me, will you let me come to you?
Next, his least favourite bathroom. The one with ‘
Time surely advances, yet for Harry it's meaningless. Unable to track the passing of the clock, calm himself with the sound of breath inhaled and exhaled, be reassured by the steady thump of his heart.
Please don't be alarmed when you see me. I'm sure the wounds would have healed by then, although Pansy seems to think they’ll linger. For now, they help keep the image of you clear; your memory tethers me until the time where reality can.
So when with a low growl he tugs your jocks down and engulfs your aching cock in one go, you lose it. Hips buck, hands fist in the sheets. A hiss which distorts into a cry when you feel his tongue tracing the underside vein before delving into your slit echoes through the room, leaving no doubt to the sincerity of your pleasure
." Harry's imitation of Draco's upper-class drawl leaves much room for refinement. "Why can't he just bloody call me Harry?"
“It’s going to pour down,” Draco announces, and Harry realises Draco’s evaded his question. He’s right, though. Within seconds the clouds are opening up, dispersing their pressure in thick, fat drops which shatter loudly against the concrete. Harry’s drenched instantly - Draco couldn’t have fared any better. There’s no point in seeking cover, and anyway, he likes this weather. The cold, bone-deep wetness which seems to seep into his very core, igniting senses even as it dulls nerves to a dangerous point. It's in moments like these, Harry never feels more inconsequential. Mother Nature raging crude destruction, his body alive with his own mortality, it's what he's always desired. What he fights to achieve.  A flash of lightning momentarily illuminates the pallor of Draco’s face and his brows pull down into a frown. “The taste of death, which dance along light,” he intones lowly before shaking himself. “I’ve got to go.” The storm gathers closer to where they stand, rolling overhead . “Lucius doesn't deal well with this.”
"Of course," Harry repeats somewhat sarcastically, but Magnus continues, undeterred. It's sound advice. He can remember a number of delightful hats worn over the course of his life; usually discarded in a frenzy by some saucy minx. Hats pull. It's proven.
"Your magical signature, Mr Potter," The Manager answers knowingly, eyes warming a fraction as he settles himself behind his desk. "You can rest assured your face is quite unidentifiable. Enthralling, isn't it, how the little quirks of nature and fate govern completely the recognition of others." He clears his throat with a low chuckle. "But I doubt you're here to entertain the musings of one such as myself. If you'd be so kind as to sign these, please, then we can get on with the eve's proceedings." The Manager pushes a small scroll of parchment toward Harry with delicate, olive-toned fingers, perfectly manicured nails glinting under the warm light of the room. Unfortunately, as he is occasionally known to do, Harry's overcome by the instinctive urge to be a giant cock and query whether the nails came with the faux-body or if he did, truly, have someone waiting on him hand, ass and foot. He's gearing up to, deliberating whether to mention the owl sanitation issue whilst at it because, really, if he's going to be a prick he may as well notch it up to cunt and make a decent scene, but a ruffle of blue catches his eye and he makes the mistake of looking over only to make rather intense eye contact with an extraordinary owl of azure complexion. The bird hoots, possibly aggrieved, however one can never know for sure. In Harry's experience, one hoot sounds much like the other, so he feels free to interpret hoots however the hell he wants; in this instance as a warm hello to an old comrade.
He had failed the light, he had failed the dark. And now, he had failed Harry Potter.
I love you. I’ll see you soon.
His coming breaks the strain of your audience. Unintentionally, unthinking, you seek out pale blue and orange hair, knowing one or the other will be breaking - squandering your will to the perverse need to witness twin uncome by twin. He's looking right at you, connect in a second. You watch, helplessly lost in the feeling of Harry and the sight of George, as he stiffens, hands tangled in Fred's hair, and empties himself into his twin's mouth.
"Don't move." The voice is closer this time, stricter, a command. Even as hand inches closer to wand, Harry can feel his will crumple against the directive in the unknown man's tone. It's definitely a man, there's no mistaking the low tenor and rasp as anything but, and even though on some level Harry knows it must be his elusive partner for the night, his fear is a visceral foe. "I'd stop making for your wand, if I was you," the voice comments, still closer, gaining on him. "Of course, it won't do much in here, but it would be ill-advised to anger me this early on in the evening, wouldn't you agree?" A pleasant threat, dangerous all the same. It's what Harry signed up for, after all, isn't it? Submission and dominance and no-holds-barred, complete abnegation for an unknown stranger behind a mask; he hadn't factored on not having his sight, however.
“I already fucking have!” He shouted, pulling himself off and away from Harry, moving to stare out a grimy window. “I already have.”
Harry stilled. “I can’t remember, Draco” he said, woodenly. “I guess it got lost in battle.”
He’s vaguely aware of Draco stepping away, moving around the room. He’s too tired to lift his head, so he just listens as Draco shuffles through items on the table.
"Muddy blue which looks like it has tendency to shift to purple is not aquamarine you idiot!"
"Oh this is very good, Mr. Malfoy! So far, it seems like you'll be the only student to successfully brew this potion. Oh, such a lovely color."
, he had his very own wand again.
"All right. Night, Malfoy." Potter ran into the chambers to join his friends, looking somehow relieved.
Draco's eyes snapped open. Had he just heard Potter whisper his first name? And had the boy even been aware of it?
He needed to get his wand back.
"Yes, I understand, Potter." Draco sighed. It really was a mutual act. "All right. Whatever you want, Potter."
"Hm? What is it, Tenebrus?" Potter stroked the beast's bat-wing.
"Um, thank you, Malfoy, for the...dinner." They both laughed mildly. "Well, I guess I'll go back to my room, then." Potter stood up from the bed and touched the door's handle.
"I'm coming! You left me alone yesterday! I'm coming with you whether you like it or not!" Potter grabbed Draco's arm tightly. Draco didn't have time to argue so he took Potter to Side-Along and Disapparated straight to the Manor's gates.
After the incident, Draco was excused from the class. Professor Slughorn failed to fix his mother's wand. The damage was too severe.
Pity, because finally he knew the suffering that little Potter went through.
Potter avoided Draco's eyes by running his own emerald gaze along the gloomy corridor. Studying the new side of Hogwarts castle where they – the Eighth years – were provided with living quarters.
"Breakfast!" Potter broke eye contact. He dashed out of the common room.
Draco approached timidly. He stopped when the beast's white eyes directed at him. Draco swallowed. The Thestral tilted its head when it saw Draco. And then it moved forward. When the beast arrived at the spot where frozen Draco stood, it patted Draco's blond head with its jaw.
"T-thanks." Potter blushed. He grabbed the scarf and buried his nose into it, inhaling. "You smell like vanilla."
Right as scheduled, at nine that morning the Minister of Magic, the Head of Aurors, four Aurors, a personnel from the Department of Magical Transportation, two Unspeakables and two Wizengamot members arrived at the manor. They moved the dark artefacts from the dungeon to the wide gravel driveway, where magical containers awaited to carry the artefacts. They stopped at four o'clock because Draco had to go back to Hogwarts. They would continue to process the rest of the artefacts on Sunday. Before returning to Hogwarts, Draco visited his room and rummaged inside his closet to find a green scarf and then checked the wards in every spot of the manor until five o'clock.
"So if only a Black who can put the portrait down, why didn't your godfather do it, Harry?" Draco asked after his mother told them about the way to get rid of the Walburga Black portrait.
It was only lips touching lips, but Draco felt his blood boiling inside, his body tingling from head to toe.
"Tenebrus!" Draco called out. He looked around but none of the larger creature could be seen. He called several times, and he was almost despairing when he finally saw movement from the inner forest and Tenebrus showed up. "Tenebrus! I need you to take me to Malfoy Manor. Can you?" Draco walked one step closer toward the Thestral.
"Well, what do you want? Why were you hiding there? Actually, why were you hiding at all?" Potter added, steadied his breath.
flew around the boys.
Soon as they arrived at the entrance hall, Draco's stomach dropped. There was a lot of evidence of nasty hexes around. They could hear yells from the heart of the Manor.
"Conceal…how?" Draco eyed Potter's grip on his wrist.
Right on time, just before the Headmistress reached the gargoyle, Draco called out to her.
A wave of magic sparks expanded from the spot of Draco's palm and extended forward, revealing a hidden breathtaking panoramic view. An extensive glass house stood above a spacious freshly-look neat lawn. White fences surrounded the area. From the entranceway laid pebble pathway that lead them to the house. On the left space of the pathway, a white-wooden bench surrounded by colourful flower bushes was installed. In the centre of the scenery was a two storey house with glass walls stood from the ground to the roof. To call it a cottage was an understatement.
." Potter walked toward the door to the exit.
"What? No. No, Ron decided to join Hermione in her room." Potter tilted his head, watching the blond cautiously. There was some sort of emptiness in Potter's voice.
Out of the corner of his eye, Draco saw the Hogwarts staffs were beginning to leave their seats. Draco rose to his feet and walked to the front of the hall.
"Why?" Potter looked up at Draco, curious.
"You won't know until you try it." Draco lifted his eyebrow.
"Oh, so it has a name." Potter dropped his eyes to the box, breaking the eye contact.
“Auror Potter, Auror Shaw,” he said, catching his breath. “We have a problem. Ernest Foxley from Floo Regulation has gone missing.”
Draco huffed a laugh. “I suppose I’ll have an extra punishment to look forward to then.”
The embedded levitation charm in them will keep his wrists and ankles from bearing the weight of his body as he floats a few feet above the ground. The ropes will keep him strung tight, unable to do much more than wriggle his torso. His head isn’t supported though, so he has to alternate between holding it up and dropping it back when it becomes too tiring.
Malfoy snorted from the table over, and Harry narrowed his eyes at him. Malfoy was still making his way through the stack of parchments. How did the man already have papers to grade? Harry imagined him making the students write essays on the very first day of class and decided that seemed likely enough.
Harry looked at Arthur, who simply shook his head fondly. “So, tell us about the job.”
“Potter, I promise if I wanted to fuck with you, I would do better than stealing your yoghurt of all things.”
“No way. He had no interest in it. He said if I wanted to make a huge mistake and get myself killed or arrested that was my business, but he thought the whole organisation was a bunch of idiots. We actually fought about it a lot.”
“Closing my legs, sir.”
A few more tugs, and Draco was coming all over his hand and the floor. He relaxed, letting Harry set the pace and use his mouth, use him. Draco was his, too.
Harry stood up and let out a long breath, before apparating to an alley near Draco’s flat. Everything continued to feel surreal—the Muggle buildings, the street lights. He made his way to the front door and up the many flights of stairs, fluorescent lights flickering overhead, before coming to a stop in front of a nondescript door. He knocked.
“Professor!”
He tried to convince himself it was enough, but he knew deep down he was lying to himself.
Harry reaches an arm behind him taking a swipe at Draco. If Draco was more sober, he probably could dodge it easily, but instead, he simply watches Harry’s hand hit his forearm and registers it after the fact.
“We’ll be sure to explore that more later, then.” Draco chuckled softly, trailing kisses away again and pulling Harry’s leg off his shoulder before running his hands up and down his thighs. Harry was too worked up to even be concerned about what was coming next, reduced to a babbling mess. He could hear his voice and the words coming out, but nothing made any sense.
Harry’s heart fluttered at the idea of Draco putting all of Harry’s presents under the tree, but then he saw Draco’s sole gift and realised that would be the only gift he’d be receiving that year, having no other family to speak of. Harry put Andromeda’s present on the nearest stuffed chair and gathered the rest, tucking them behind the chair to open later.
Draco raises an eyebrow. "Nice foreplay, Potter.”
Harry sighed and watched as an expression of sadness fell over his face. It was no matter, he thought, stepping back from the sink and over to the toilet.
“What does it want?” one of the students shrieked.
Harry left on his pyjama bottoms and pulled on the thick deep purple sweater that sported a tan sorting hat on the front. It was a bit of a strange choice, but he liked the colour. Plus, it was still better than the jumper in glittery gold with a unicorn head that he’d received the year prior to that. George had flat out asked his mum if she was running out of ideas as he opened his present to find a Doxie on his own. Molly had declared that each year was to have a theme since there were so many children and grandchildren, which Harry took as, yes, she was running out of ideas.
“Right.”
“Don’t you worry about your flatmates?” Harry asked, remembering the two stoners with whom Draco shared his flat.
Draco feels his body heat up—it’s been too many days already. He pulls Harry’s shirt over his head as Harry unbuttons Draco’s, making quick work of it. Draco runs his hands down Harry’s bare chest, over his tight pecs, his abs, before slipping his thumbs in his joggers, pulling them down as Harry kicks them the rest of the way off. They get Draco’s clothes the rest of the way off and Draco grabs his wand, quickly cleaning and prepping Harry with a couple of spells as he lubes himself up.
Harry grabbed it and scanned the contents.
“I’m sure I don’t need your help.” Malfoy huffed and then, hitching the strap to his leather satchel higher on his shoulder, turned and strutted out the door, leaving Harry to grind his teeth in frustration.
He got to his bedroom and opened the wardrobe looking for something to change into. Normally, he just threw on the first thing he saw, but he remembered too clearly that uncomfortable feeling from the previous day. He cringed as he pushed through his Muggle clothes that were shoved to the one side of the wardrobe.
Draco’s brain was still fuzzy and his body limp when he felt Harry start to undo the rope, winding it around and around, slipping it through the knots and turns. The last bit was unravelled from one of his legs, and Draco sighed as Harry straightened Draco’s legs and massaged his muscles.
Harry continued to tease with feather-light touches as Draco fell apart.
“Er, well, both,” Hermione said, leaning toward him. “But Harry, you know that we love you no matter what, right? You could have talked to us about it. Not that you have to! Just that we’re here for you… if you want.”
Harry made his way shakily back to the lift and down to his office. He saw Perry and Higgins down the hall but just nodded to them and entered his office, closing the door behind him and leaning against it. He took a moment to let himself take a deep, shaky breath and try to calm down his racing heart. God, he hated this. Not knowing who to trust, being forced to lie to his colleagues at the Ministry. He closed his eyes. It was all so much like the war. Too much like the war.
Harry shivered.
“Yes, yes, you’re ‘just friends,’ and it’s ‘not like that.’ I heard you at lunch,” she replied as she lightly shoved him back toward the changing room. “You’re still getting the jeans.” Her eyes gleamed as she broke out in a big grin. “Keep these on and try on the shirts.”
“Oh my god.” Harry scrambles into a seated position, his hands hovering over Draco’s cock. “That doesn’t look good.”
*            *            *
He then turned back to Noah, who looked wind-swept and highly frustrated.
,” he replied. “Certainly, I must be allowed to change a little in two decades.”
“Sir?”
“And Astnor, and a whole laundry list of others,” Ron replied with a grim expression. “They’re going away for life—no question about it.”
Draco adjusts his stance, slipping his hand between them and wrapping his warm fingers around Harry’s cock. Harry throws his head back at the sensation. He’s so close. Draco picks up the pace. His breathing becomes more erratic, and Harry can tell he’s close too.
“Hmm,” Draco stills his hand on Harry’s cock. Harry freezes, making sure not to buck up—fighting against every instinct in his body to do so.
“You going to be able to stick around after dinner?” Ginny nudged Harry’s elbow.
A hand on his arm stopped him, and Harry stopped to turn back to Malfoy, who was looking at him earnestly.
“This is your body. You tell me what you want me to do.” Harry watched as Draco’s green eyes widened. He wasn’t sure if Draco was surprised that Harry was going through with this, or if he was just really excited at the prospect. Either way, he clearly was interested in this new proposition.
Harry knew he had the knowledge—several years playing Seeker for the Falmouth Falcons certainly gave him that—but actually putting together lesson plans and seeing them through for a full year was intimidating. He didn’t really feel like they should be leaving him in charge of anything, let alone so many students. He barely felt old enough to be a teacher, really.
“I didn’t fly perfectly the first time,” Harry said, trying to rein in his frustration. So far, the class had been a bit of a debacle. Trying to help nearly forty students at once was proving impossible. He couldn’t help but wonder at the logic of having two houses per lesson. Surely, one would be more manageable. He didn’t remember his classes being quite this large when he had been a student, either.
If Harry didn’t know better, he’d have sworn Malfoy was enjoying himself. Harry had to admit this hadn’t been the worst way to spend an afternoon. He finally had some company for once and even got some work done, freeing up his evening. So, Harry followed Malfoy through the castle, out the castle doors, and to the greenhouses.
“I’ll be at your home soon, don’t you fear.
“How should I know?” Harry replies as he finally grasps his wand. “
“Now?” Harry asked. “Are you sure you don’t want some help?”
“Fine, but I’m calling a cab,” Draco said, pulling out his phone. Before Harry could protest further, Draco was already giving someone on the other end of the call an address.
“I can close my eyes if you want,” Harry offered.
Harry huffed a laugh. Draco had no doubt that Harry knew exactly what his thoughts about that were. He ran a hand through Draco’s hair, tucking a stray strand behind his ear. “I need a few minutes to get cleaned up. I’d like you to go up to the attic and wait for me exactly like this.”
“Higher.”
“Just a few. For now, I’ve made copies and put them somewhere safe.”
Harry allowed himself to relax. Draco didn’t seem like he was going to bring up Harry’s weird behaviour from the previous day. So, Harry worked on being as normal as possible. Well, as normal as it could be with the two of them out to lunch. It was strange being so close to the other man. Most of their youth had been spent hurling insults from half a classroom away. The only times they’d been closer had generally ended in some sort of bloodshed.
“Right now look again, and try to figure out which one is missing.”
“What is it you’re missing then?”
Harry nodded, but deep down he knew this was a fool’s errand. Lucius had been too careful, too good at covering his tracks. The address they’d found had been an anomaly—one piece of evidence Lucius or his counterparts overlooked. Harry doubted they’d find another.
“How’d her first interview go?
Draco pulls on his pyjama top and blows out the candles. Just as he starts to put the candles away, he hears the Floo sound downstairs. No one should be calling this late. With a frown, Draco heads quietly downstairs to see Molly Weasley’s head in the flames.
Harry can’t see anything through his glasses and the water but hears Draco letting out a stream of curses. “Where’s my fucking wand?”
Harry hesitated for a moment, his brain short-circuiting on just how terrible of an idea this probably was. But, in the end, he only had so much self-restraint. With a deep breath, he threw a wandless locking charm followed by a wandless silencing charm at the door.
“Let them see. Let them know that you’re mine.”
“We were just wondering,” Opal said. “Did you really get fired from the Falcons because you were, erm…”
Harry begs and pleads as Draco continues to work his cock back up to full hardness. He’s soon babbling for him to stop again, his nerve endings shot as pain and arousal thrum through his veins.
Teddy came running back in, pulling the jumper over his head while still in motion and running headlong into the door. After a yelp and a bit of tugging, he managed to get it on. Since he was still growing, he regularly got ones with his initials, needing a new one every year. This one was a warm umber with a bright gold “T”.
“I've never had this problem before, Professor. I’ve been flying since I was seven years old!” Alder crossed his arms, narrowing his dark brown eyes at Harry.
When he opened the door, Draco was still in the same position.
Draco let go of Harry’s hand and started folding the edge of his napkin back and forth. “They know it’s me, though?”
Draco threaded his fingers through Harry’s hair. “I was cleaning. You’re the one who stopped me.”
Hopefully, Albus and Scorpius haven’t managed to do anything requiring another trip to St Mungo’s in the last ten minutes. At this rate, he’s surprised they aren’t qualifying for some sort of frequent patient status.
“What?!” She jumped off the table, eyes wide, and tackled him into a hug. “Really?”
“Just use a spell!” Malfoy replied. “They’ll see us.”
He scanned the room. Scott was fighting back two wix with flourish. The man might have spent his days analysing potions, but Harry had to admit: he could duel.
They both know this game well. Draco is in charge here, and any attempt from Harry to change that, to control it, will only be met with more toying.
“I want to show you something. I’m not sure— no promises on whether there will be anything of use, but could you meet me at the Manor Friday morning?” Draco asked.
“It’s raw poultry, Harry. I don’t think you understand how disgusting this is.” Draco pulled out his hand, looking white as a sheet before grabbing another handful.
“Anytime, dear.”
“It’s fine,” Harry said, opening his own and taking a bite. His stomach grumbled immediately. He had hardly eaten since Tuesday.
“Borrowed,” Malfoy corrected. “We’ll put it back before Longbottom even notices that it’s gone.”
“Why aren’t you running your drills?” Harry asked as he came to a stop in front of them.
Harry felt his resolve quickly crumbling under the intense stare and grabbed Malfoy’s arm, pulling him towards the door. “Erm—nope. Sorry, Neville. Hope you catch the person!”
Mel leant back in her seat and looked at him for a moment. “The letters didn’t have much. One of them talked about needing to talk to A before they moved forward on something. Another mentioned a meeting, but no address.”
. He only kept people around that were useful,” he said, his lip curling in distaste. “I suppose Severus was probably the only person that came close to being a friend. Otherwise, his allegiances were always to whoever had the most power, whoever he could get the most out of.”
Decision made, Harry rushed to catch up to him. “Sorry. I couldn’t help it. Apology actually accepted. So, you really weren’t taking my yoghurt?”
After a minute, Draco finally huffed loudly. “For fuck’s sake.” And then Harry felt Draco’s arm wrap around him and pull him close, lips brushing his forehead a moment later.
“Oh, love, we’re just getting started.”
“Like that?” Draco asked, his voice low and gravelly, before laying another kiss, another lick.
“Yes,” Harry replied. “It’s been a long time since the war. It’ll be fine.”
Draco smiles. “No, I meant that things will get easier—the nightmares and needing us there all the time. They won’t need us to tuck them in soon. James barely wants it now, even.”
He’d still been heartbroken. He loved her even if it hadn’t been physical, but he knew she deserved something better, so he let her go.
Harry shuffled to the side of it to open the door and then levitated the plant to Malfoy’s shelf, tucking it behind his other food to keep it hidden from view.
“Right,” Draco said, pausing before taking another bite.
“I feel like there’s a story there,” Harry said with a laugh.
“Are you sure, though? I know you haven’t dated much, and how hard it is with you being in the public eye,” Molly continued.
A few hours later, he slowly woke from his nap, feeling significantly more lucid. The nap seemed to have helped both the drowsiness and the residual pain, and Harry felt like he could probably manage the stairs again. He gingerly stretched, slowly swinging his legs to the side of the bed before standing up. He was definitely feeling stronger, but he was still unsteady on his feet. Spell damage often had a frustratingly slow recovery, particularly for someone as impatient as Harry.
“That’s good.” Harry fiddled with his coaster, wanting to ask so many more questions.
“Sorry—it was a dumb idea.”
“I’m sorry that this happened to you, and we’re here to help. We speak English so we’re using a translation spell to communicate. We’re with the Aurors, and we’ve arrested the people who did this to you. You can leave the cage if you want—no one will hurt you here. Medical help will be here in a little while.”
Draco paused. “Let me know if this is too much okay?”
Noah looked down and bit his lip. “I’m not sure it’s going to work, Professor.”
“Are you okay?” Harry twists around, eyes large.
“Thank you,” they said in a strong accent that Harry couldn’t place.
Realizing he was still staring, Harry cleared his throat and went back to his lesson planning. A few more professors came and went while he got through his fourth and third-year lessons. While his youngest students were chomping at the bit to start learning Quidditch, they had far too many flying skills left to master first. His third years, however, were ready for the fundamentals, so Harry decided he’d introduce a basic Quaffle game in the next lessons—no Snitch or Bludgers just yet.
A small tremor vibrated off of Draco. “What else?”
. “You put your number in?”
Draco finally spoke. “I shouldn’t be surprised. Really I shouldn’t.”
“Unless you think there’s something embarrassing in there, in which case I absolutely insist you open them all immediately,” Draco said, eyes lighting up.
“What?” Harry couldn’t hide his surprise at that given what he’d told him about the situation.
“That would be great, Paulo. Draco’s a fan of the Arrows, but I'm more of a Wasps man these days.”
Normally, he did well separating work from his personal feelings about the suspects and victims. Years of being on the job had made sure of that. But it seemed that old wounds ran deep, because he was finding it difficult to care about finding the person responsible for Lucius’s death.
“Yeah, god,” Harry pants out. “Like that…”
Draco giggles and tucks into Harry’s chest.
As if in response, the creature snorted, a plume of dangerous green smoke coming out of its mouth. Harry and Mel stepped back instinctively, but the smoke hit an invisible barrier at the bars of the cage and billowed along its edges before dissipating.
Harry chuckled. “Okay, will do.”
“I’m okay, Naomi,” he replied.
“So, how do you like it?” Draco asked, nodding towards his half-empty glass.
He opened his mouth to tell them to stay on the ground until he was back and had an immediate flashback to his first and only flying lesson. Nope, he was not going to make that mistake.
“Yeah,” Harry replied, returning the smile.
Draco huffs a laugh and moves over to Harry, bracketing his hands on either side of Harry’s hips. He leans forward, his breath ghosting across Harry’s lips. “Is that so?”
There was a light, wet pressure on the skin around his hole, setting off every nerve ending in Harry’s body. A moan escaped his lips. Then there was a breath, air teasing the surface, just shy of too much, and Harry’s muscles flexed involuntarily, nearly pushing Draco away with his leg.
“Let’s go celebrate, then,” Malfoy said, shuffling his stack of parchment back into a neat stack. “Grab a drink in Hogsmeade?”
“Well?” Draco asked pointedly.
“You can do it, pet,” Draco says firmly. “I’m going to work you through this and the rest until we hit five or you safeword.”
“Hey,” he said as he approached.
“There are what? Ten students in that class?” Malfoy waved his hand dismissively. “Besides, it’s not too far from my classroom.”
“Professor, look!” Opal yelled, pointing at the distance.
Harry stifled a laugh. He was glad his neighbours couldn’t even see his house let alone snoop on him, but in his line of work, thank god for nosy neighbours.
Draco continued to toy with his oversensitive cock, alternating between faster strokes and slow long tugs. Harry continued to babble through his sobs, his hips pistoning side to side as his cock tried to escape its torture.
The students shifted slightly and looked to their neighbours.
“Hey,” Draco said, reaching out and tangling his fingers in Harry’s messy hair. “You don’t need to.”
Harry felt his face heat, but he couldn’t look away. He found himself staring at Draco, the way he leaned back on the counter behind him, arms crossed as he laughed at something the man said. He was wearing a similar outfit as the day prior, just a plain coloured t-shirt and fitted jeans. This shirt was emerald green and clung to his shoulders and his stomach. As he turned around and started mixing the guy a drink, his shirt rode up just enough to show a slip of skin and the band of black pants. The inconsistent thumping sound he’d heard the other day coming from somewhere upstairs was back and seemed to mirror the jump of Harry’s heartbeat.
Ewan moved slightly closer to Draco. “So how do you know each other?”
Draco pulls out, startled, and then loses his balance, his knee slipping on the edge of the bed. “Shit!” They apparently moved around a bit more than he realized. His arms flail in circles as he slips further off the bed.
“Fine.”
Once he’s started to settle, no longer crying out pleas for Draco to stop and pulling against his restraints in vain, Harry feels Draco switch hands and fleetingly wonders if he’s getting tired. Draco continues to work him for another minute, until Harry’s gone soft, no longer whimpering. Then Draco stops.
“I had to stop Riley from making a truly atrocious cocktail in a pitcher that they were going to inflict on your guests.” Draco handed Harry a tall amber cocktail with a cherry floating amongst the ice. For Lila, Draco had what appeared to be the same cocktail she’d been previously drinking, and then had something clear with what looked like mint leaves floating in it for himself. “I think Beele broke your ice maker again too.”
Harry shrugged, a smile playing at his lips. “Maybe.”
Harry laughed and lifted himself so that he could slot between Draco’s legs.
Malfoy started laughing.
Later that afternoon, they stood at the burgundy door of the home of one Abner Astor.
He tried to fight down the flush that he could feel creeping up his face, but she just laughed a little harder at his embarrassment and pulled him tighter.
Draco looked like he was enjoying himself… in the way one might enjoy a good movie. A bit of Harry’s stubbornness kicked in, and he changed technique. After all, Draco said this was all about learning one another, right? He tried adding more pressure, happy to hear a moan from the other man at the change. Then he swirled his tongue around the tip and traced it along the vein, and Draco shuddered beneath him, another moan escaping his lips.
People stare.
I won’t give up on you. This is not our denouement.
Harry jumps, dropping his thankfully-yet-not-surprisingly-empty tumbler (although Magnus still winces as crystal meets carpet), and whips his head around comically. Draco's standing in the doorway, elbow supported casually against the frame, a smirk playing on his lips. To be fair, Magnus can see the attraction: fair hair framing fair skin, sharp lines of his body highlighted by skintight pants and a vest Magnus would swear were dragonhide.
Muscles tensed; body strung out and taut, all you can do is squeeze your eyes closed and
The silence hangs, indulgent, serene, and it takes Magnus several glorious moments of reprieve to understand he's severely fucked up. Indeed, when he raises his gaze warily and with a touch of resignation from the ginger-tufted triangles of Chairman's ears, Harry's staring back at him, panic and excitement warring across his face, mouth popped open in an O.
He seems to realise this; takes in the close bodies and the air of menace. Indecision wars across his face, twisting his features, until he ostensibly makes a decision and clasps a sure hand over your forearm.
"He likes it rougher than that, he won't break." His voice is gravel, white smoke in the night, heavy and tangible on your tongue. "Look at him, greedy little slut. He's practically begging for your cock. Stick it in him, he makes the lewdest little sounds. Don't you, Draco?"
It had been, and a most excellent arse at that, among other things. "So, Draco," Magnus says, refusing to acknowledge whatever it is being insinuated, truth or not. Far better to stick firm to the belief Harry's continued presence in his flat was making an awful dent in his sex life. "He's a strange creature. Reminds me of the fae at times. Beautiful, cunning, with a hefty dose of arrogance." Rather like himself, come to think of it. Definitely paler. Magnus should probably suggest a good fake tan.
His voice is the only thing you need, the blank void of blindness turning every stranger's touch to his. He enables your depraved desires, revels in the filthy, the debauched. Uncages the licentious, shameless miscreant that claws inside you.
"Reckon you'll survive, though it wouldn't be a loss if you just gave up and fucking died. Better think about who you run that mouth to next time, you little faggot." The man spat at Draco before turning and leaving, his hands thrust deep within his jacket pockets.
Down the leather curves, attention sweeping from shoulder blades to inner knees, staining the sensitive flesh of his arse and thighs maroon in an instant. The strikes are sharper here, burning. Blood welling just under the skin, broken capillaries unfurling like roads across barren land, a map of the flesh already explored. A beacon for further pain to descend upon.
Then the sound of a match being struck reaches his ears, the scent of igniting phosphorus, burning wick, melting paraffin soon following, and the sliver of recognition is abandoned for the promise of "
Draco nods slowly. “If I can, I will.” He pulls himself from Harry’s grasp and starts back the way he came. In what feels like seconds he’s lost to the torrent of rain. Before long, Harry is once again alone in the night.
Harry’s pulled back by a gentle thumb brushing his wet cheek, and he knows he’s been crying.
Draco pulled his head away from Harry’s shoulder, leaning back so he could study his face. “Isn't this why you left? What you ran from?”
What happened to that boy?
Beautiful. Competent,
You make your way through the crowds slowly. They move for you, step aside, the stigma that surrounds you still evident even after all these years. For once you welcome it. Embrace it, because it means you get to him just that little bit faster.
"You are gay," Magnus points out helpfully, "meaning you're near-required to write one. How about:
sustaining his desertion.
I told you at our wedding that I'd follow you anywhere.
It's the fairytale ending, his happily ever after, El Dorado and Eden and pots of gold at the end of rainbows. Unattainable. Unreachable; the entire sub-section of un's witnessed over the course of 7,852 sunsets to sunrises and points of the meridians. It would be far too many silver linings for Draco's and his own predilections when concerned with the art of
"About the same time I started selling myself just to stay alive" Draco blandly stated, not welcoming the reminder of his past. "Probably round the point you gave up. Now if you’ll excuse me, I'm going to go wash the spunk from the last three years out of my ass."
There's something in the sound of his tone. A familiarity which grates along Harry's subconscious, an articulation his mind insists he should know.
You know that's what will happen; an altercation that will leave you changed, a paradigm shift of sorts. How are you expected to carry on with the day to day of life, knowing what it finally feels like, to be with him? Every previously held assumption and belief extirpated in an instant, because never, in all your fantasies, did he ever want you in return.
, time passing in a disjointed haze measured by every panted breath and burning lick on your hyper-sensitised skin, languidly edging lower.
“Death Eaters. How many are still free?”
For a few long moments, Harry thinks he’s dreaming. Either that or hallucinating, a cruel trick of the psyche. A mirage, for surely he’s a drowning man forfeited to the sea. A wayward wanderer, thirsting for water. Mind providing him with the illusion he so perilously craves, for even his sanity has taken pity on the delusions of a broken fool.
When Draco woke, Potter was asleep beside him. He had slumped in his slumber, an arm thrown out and his sleeve scrunched, exposing the patchwork of scarring that laced up the pale underside to the elbow. Fresh cuts were layered upon old, creating a haunting sort of artistry. If it wasn't for the medium, he would call it beautiful.
Potter's words resonated through his frayed mind. It was true that Draco had paid for his mistakes at a considerably higher price than others. His father's wrath as a child when he did not live up to the Malfoy Standard. The punishment when he failed to befriend The Boy Who Lived. Draco's pathetic inability to receive higher marks than a mudblood.
Potter look at him, and for a second his eyes lightened before they quickly fell flat again. "Does it matter how I survive, Malfoy?"
Today has been one of the worse since you left. This facade of sanity is hard to maintain, and I don’t know why I persist.
Keeps you alive.
Perhaps it’s because Draco ignites his dormant saviour complexion. Perhaps he’s right to say they’re the same.
Privately he thinks Harry should just tell Draco how he feels and go from there. That, or jump him in bed, nude. But his advice for the former has already fallen on deaf ears, and he somehow doesn't see Harry going for the latter. "You need to start with a grand gesture," he says instead, attempting to sound sage. "Something that clearly states your intentions. Something that screams, 'I'm here, I'm queer, and I want to fuck your brains out.'" Harry's brow crinkles, and Magnus hastily continues. "Among other more romantic things, of course. If I were you, I'd start with a horse. Draco seems like a man who'd appreciate a good gelding." Or he had at Ascot anyway, the snobby trollop. "Ride that beast right through his gates and up to the front door. When Draco appears, clearly enticed by your entrance, recite a poem and gift him with..." Magnus flounders briefly, before saying the first thing that comes to mind, "a pair of wrought-iron candelabras. Added points if you can find a matching set of napkin rings for his mother."
under Draco's compliment. Except it doesn't come from Draco;
For a paramount moment, everything was right.
“Why?”
A wretched wail pierced the oppressive silence, the noise echoing through the still house. Instantly, there were hands on him, calming, soothing, reassuring. But they were the wrong hands, callused and masculine, not the soft smooth touch he craved, the ones that had held him night after night, cleaned his wounds, comforted his mind and body. He let out another sob, and suddenly he was crying in earnest, his body rocking and shaking and heaving in a way it hadn't since he was a child, nose running and tears streaming down reddening cheeks, letting the futility, his worthlessness, enclose him.
It's the sanest thing Harry's said all evening; one only had to look at Magnus' current company. He resists pointing this out however, painful as it is to hold his tongue. Whilst fantastic to stray from the topic of Draco Malfoy, he's not sure a debate about modern lingo is the topic to do so with. Especially considering Magnus' 'proof' doesn't really do much for his argument. Unfortunately.
“I’m sorry.” Potter sounded earnest.
“You said it yourself. Death Eaters still roam free. He’s not the only one, far from it. Nothing will ever change, Harry. As long as there’s good, there will be bad in the world.”
"Of course he did," Draco answers, interrupting whatever denials were on Magnus' tongue. "Any self-respecting warlock would. And I was sent by Blaise to retrieve the sweater he left." He holds up an olive cashmere jersey; Magnus suddenly finds the top of Chairman Meow's head very interesting. He can feel the smugness radiating from Harry's direction. "So, Potter," Draco near-purrs, his change in tone startling both Magnus and Harry, if the latter's jump is anything to go by. He drops Blaise's sweater and stalks forward, demeanour cat-like, a suggestion of sway to his hips. "What was this I heard about you, gothic renaissance, and fabulous Raven hats?"
"Er, okay," Harry says, still appearing dubious despite Magnus' frankly brilliant explanation. He takes a large gulp from his tumbler, either to steady himself or buy time. "Not sure about the poem thing, though. Seems hard." He scrunches his face. "And, well, a bit gay, to be honest."
It’s enough for the Dementor to slide away. Some warmth sweeps back into Harry’s body and he lets out a deep breath. A bar of chocolate is pushed into his hand and Harry smiles up at his uncle.
Days later, Harry gets another anonymous package. He opens it and finds a small book about snakes inside. Harry shivers as he remembers the snake in his dream last night. To large and old to be natural, slowly swallowing Harry’s body after Voldemort had killed him, making it impossible for Harry to return to the living. Sometimes Harry things he’s still dead, that all this is a dream. But then he wakes up screaming in his bed and he knows he’s still alive.
I took out my invisibility cloak and started to look in all the usual spots. I searched the library, in the hope Draco would be there still trying to find a way for me to breath underwater. I searched our favourite spots around the castle, I even tried the Prefect’s bathroom and Myrtle’s bathroom. Only Draco was nowhere to be found. It reminded me of the dreams I used to have in second year. You remember, the ones in which Draco kept disappearing as he’d never excited. It scared me. In the end, I sat down in an alcove and cried myself to sleep.
Draco and Hermione were in the Entrance Hall. They had received a note from Hagrid about the appeal of Buckbeak. He’d lost and Buckbeak was to be executed at sunset. We all agreed we should go and see him, but I’d left my invisibility cloak in the passageway under the one-eyed witch when Nott and Crabbe saw me in Hogsmeade and I hadn’t been able to retrieve it. Draco and I both made sure neither professor Snape nor professor Lupin saw us anywhere near it, knowing we would be in big trouble if they did. So Hermione went to retrieve the cloak while Draco and I joint our friends for dinner.
“And I love you too, even if you are the idiot that brings Slytherin blood into the family,” James continues.
“He was bleeding, Harry. And he still wouldn’t stop scratching. Ron was just trying to help. I think he said something in the line that all will be okay and Draco just snapped.”
Harry closes his eyes as he pictures Draco cutting stems in at the kitchen counter, placing the flowers with care into the vase. Harry had watched him do that a million times and it never bored him. It was one of their routines that helped Harry to stay calm, to forget all the horrors they had gone through.
I was allowed one visitor per day for the next few days, so I only saw Hermione. She kept me up to date with my schoolwork and even gave me her notes. She also told me that they were sure the Sorcerer’s Stone was still safe. She, Ron and Neville pressed their ears at the locked door of the third-floor corridor every time they passed it to check that Fluffy was still growling inside.
Harry scrapes his throat and that puts a stop to the snugging. But they still stare at each other. Is this truly what it looks like when people are in love? Is that how Harry looks at Malfoy? Harry hopes it isn’t. That would make everything even worse.
Harry chuckles. “It’s not as if he can hear you,” he jokes. And that is the worst part of all. By Harry’s silly action, Draco hasn’t just lost one friend. He’s lost four. He must hate Harry for doing this to him.
There are no lights on in the house. Harry closes his eyes for a second before he opens the back door. He steps into the kitchen and turns on the lights. His dirty coffee cup from that morning still stands in the sink, accompanied by his plate. There are no other dishes or any sign that someone else lives in this house.
Harry sits down on the top of the stairs. He was a fool, thinking that some company would cheer Draco up. He should have taken him home when it was clear Draco wasn’t feeling well. Why did he stay and let Draco suffer? Just because he wanted to spend new years with his friends. Isn’t Draco supposed to come first? It’s just a stupid clock ticking down to midnight, just like it does every night. They could have just ignored it. So why did Harry insisted that they go to the stupid party? It clearly wasn’t helping Draco get any better.
“You don’t mind. Tomorrow everyone will know about this. It will be in the papers,” Harry stutters.
I also asked him why he was so sure back then that Professor Snape had switched sides, but he didn’t want to answer that. He said it was between him and Professor Snape.
They both stare at the ceiling. Harry wonders if Pettigrew is still in Hogsmeade. Will he go after Sirius or Neville if he gets the chance? It’s been weeks since the last sighting. Silently, Harry had hoped that Pettigrew would have moved on and would leave his family alone. Harry hasn’t found a way to stop him yet. But he will. He can’t have that animal cause even more pain. It’s enough that he betrayed Neville’s parents and caused their deaths, and that he disabled Sirius in the way he did. He won’t get that chance again, to do harm like that. Harry will stop him before Pettigrew comes close to Harry’s loved ones.
What Draco didn’t know was that Moaning Myrtle had another friend, one she told all about Draco. Draco would only learn about that a year later when Potter and his friends would be dragged into the Manor.
On the day of the match, Marcus placed my Firebolt on the breakfast table. Most students loved how the other house stared at it jealously. Marcus was most pleased with Wood’s disbelieved reaction. They are both so determent to win the cup this year it’s has become a dangerous rivalry. I believe professor Snape had to stop the two from fighting in his class the other day. Wood thinks it’s unfair I fly a Firebolt, that it gives Slytherin an unfair advantage. Diggory, the team captain of Hufflepuff is a lot nicer. He came by to congratulate me on my new broom. He even apologised again for not realising I fell off my broom when he caught the snitch in our last game. I told him it was fine as long as he would lose all his other games. He laughed and said he couldn’t promise anything.
So as soon as it was eleven I made my way over to the Quidditch stadium and found a place at the back of one of the stands. And then the game started. Draco was good. Stealing the Quaffle from the Gryffindor team and scoring some good points. But then everything went wrong. One of the Bludgers kept aiming for him. Whenever the Beaters whacked it into a different direction it would just change direction in mid-air and shoot straight for Draco again. Draco had to manoeuvre hard to avoid it. I was glad Draco was so skilled on a broom, but I was scared for him.
I jumped to my feet and said I needed to see Hagrid. Hermione and Draco ran after me. They both voiced a why in unison. And I told them it was a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around with illegal dragon eggs? Draco cursed when I had stopped talking and said the one thing I was afraid of, that they had used the dragon egg to get information on how to get past Fluffy.
* * *
“I’m fine,” Harry says and turns his back to his brother. He can’t look at him and see the pity on his face. It will make it all real.
“Why not?” Harry asks.
My heart did some somersaults when I saw who had stepped into the shop. My dreams had done his sharp pointed features no justice. His hair was even lighter than I could remember and was styled sleekly to the back. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a person that beautiful and couldn’t help but smile. I wanted to step out of the cabinet to greet him when I saw that he was not alone. A man with the same pale, pointed face and identical grey eyes followed Draco into the shop. I think it was his father. He snapped at Draco to touch nothing and Draco turned away from him. I don’t think Draco’s father would be kind to me if I would show myself so I stayed hidden.
The car stops on the driveway, and Neville and Luna step out. Luna moves the car seat so Draco can get out.
The rest of the next two weeks went by in a blur. We went to class and I either studied with Draco or Hermione for our exams. The days were getting hotter and I was happy that the dungeon stayed nice and cool, making it easier to study there. I told Hermione, Ron and Neville and they just complained that the west tower was sweltering hot.
Headmaster Dumbledore asked me if there was anything I wanted to tell him, and for a moment I thought about telling him about the voice I had heard saying it wanted to kill. But I remember that Hermione had said that hearing voices no one else can hear isn’t a good sign, so I decided not to tell him. And maybe I should have asked him if he knew if I was somehow related to Salazar Slytherin. Or told him that the children and even some professors at the school are consciously avoiding me, afraid I’ll go after them next. But I said that there was nothing and after that, I was allowed to leave.
‘It’s nice to talk to somebody who’s also deaf,’ Draco writes. He bites on his bottom lip and Harry can’t keep his eyes off it. He wants to know what it’s like to bite Draco’s lip. And fuck, he needs to stop thinking like this. They are friends. Draco isn’t gay and he’d only just made some friends. Harry can’t be the reason why he loses them all. Including the only other person he knows that’s deaf.
“You still want to pretend that you don’t fancy him?” Hermione asks when Harry sits down next to her. She already has a book on her lap, as if she never left for the holidays.
“What are you smiling about?” Neville asks. “You’re dreaming of winning the Quidditch cup again.”
“Of course we’re going to beat them,” Harry says. “That isn’t the issue here.” He pushes his hair that is still moist from his shower out of his face. “We need to come up with a way to help Malfoy.”
Harry takes one last look at Draco. He smiles that private little smile that he only used to do around Harry. But now it’s directed at Greengrass. Harry swallows and runs out of the Great Hall. Footsteps follow him, but Harry doesn’t stop. He runs out of the school, past the hedges and onto the path towards the Quidditch field.
Myrtle wanted to know why I wasn’t dead and I told her we would discuss that some other time. She got upset about that and snapped at me ‘Than what do you want this time’. I asked her where she had seen the pair of great, big, yellow eyes when she died. Myrtle pointed vaguely toward the sink in front of her toilet and Ron and I hurried over to it to investigate. It looked like an ordinary sink; the only thing standing out was a tiny snake on one of the copper taps. Myrtle said the tap has never worked when I turned it. Ron suggested saying something in Parseltongue. I didn’t know if I could since I only managed to do it when faced with a real snake and I’ve never tried otherwise. But after a couple of tries, I managed to say ‘Open up’ in Parseltongue.
The next day I went to sit with him and Zabini for breakfast and tried to talk to him again about him staying awake to make sure I’m fine. Zabini agreed with me that Malfoy did need some sleep and he helped me convince him to stop trying to stay awake all the time. From then on I kept eating breakfast with them at the Slytherin table. I still have lunch and dinner with Hermione and her fellow Gryffindor’s, but it’s also nice to spend more time at my own house table. I think Zabini, Malfoy and I are becoming friends. It’s making things a little more complicated because Ron and Neville can’t seem to forgive Malfoy for all the teasing he did before, but he has changed and hasn’t said a bad word about or to me in the last two months. I didn’t tell Ron and Neville about him staying awake to keep me safe and how he saved my notebook and cloak (that they don’t even know about) from Nott. Ron and Neville not knowing that might make it harder for them to see that Malfoy is trying to be my friend, but I’m not willing to tell them. Only Hermione knows that Malfoy sacrificed his sleep to keep me safe and protected my notebook while I was in the hospital wing, and she still thinks Malfoy must have read my letters to you, but he said he didn’t and I’ll believe him until there is prove otherwise.
Hermione has been having a hard time. People keep teasing her about being the thing that Viktor Krum would miss the most. Ron is being all jealous about it. He keeps giving Viktor dark looks from across the Great Hall during meal times. And it all became worse when the Witch Weekly came that week. There was a large article about the lovers of the champions. A large portion was about how I had seen very upset when my boyfriend was being held captive by the Merpeople. But since everyone already knows that Draco and I are inseparable nobody paid it much attention. No, the worst was how it named Hermione as Viktor’s secret lover. The article was mean, naming Hermione plain and trying to catch a famous wizard for making up for her own faults. Pansy was quoted in the article, saying that Hermione is ugly and that she would have had to use a love potion to get Viktor to fall for her. Hermione is pretending she’s fine, but I know her and she’s struggling with all the negative attention she’s getting.
The practical for potions was the hardest because we all had to make a potion by ourselves, with no help from our usual partners. Professor Snape kept breathing down my neck while I tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness Potion. Draco was working on the table next to me and he kept giving me reassuring looks. I know he was acing his practical. I tried really hard to remember all the tips he had given me, but I’m not sure if my potion came out any good.
“Just a friend?” James asks. “That’s why he was still here, alone. All your other friends already gone.”
“He used to be my mother’s best friend,” Harry tells Draco. “They are still friends, but they aren’t as close as they used to be. Uncle Sirius says he loves my mum and hates me because she chooses James instead of him.”
“What if we make a deal,” Harry starts. He looks back at Hermione who now swirls their potion around before adding some powder.
‘We’ve been over this a million times. Start REMEMBERING!’ Draco writes. ‘You need to feed them to a Venomous Tentacula. You lure the Chizpurfles to the plant with the Lumos Duo Charm. This works because the Chizpurfles are attracted to magic. Then you wait for the plant to eat the Chizpurfle. It will spit out the carapace when it’s done.’
“I’m good at that,” Harry jokes. He rests his head on Draco’s shoulder. “Wish it would stop soon. I don’t want to die yet. Not until I’ve stopped him once and for all.”
Harry freezes in his track to the door. He looks towards the bed with a trembling lip. He doesn’t say anything, and Draco knows it’s too late. Nothing he says now will change Harry’s mind, and that is for the best. They are over and done. Only Draco can’t let him leave without him knowing that he’s sorry for all he’s done. For hurting the one person he loves more than anything else in this world.
Harry doesn’t stop. Doesn’t even reply to Oliver’s shouts. He needs to find Neville and stop him. He can’t lose his brother. Neville is the fucking ‘Boy Who Lived’, and Harry is going to make sure it stays that way. Nobody is killing Neville today. And especially not that rat Pettigrew.
Zabini came by on the weekend, saying he was sorry and that he wished that he had helped me before things had gotten this bad. He said he had told Professor Snape that he thinks Nott did this to me. That he and Crabbe had been laughing when they had come back to the dormitory that night. And that they had cleaned blood of their shoes in the showers. Zabini also said that I had made Malfoy nervous and that Malfoy had sneaked out of the dungeon to warn Snape. He had never seen Malfoy look that scared when he came back to the dormitory, and Zabini thinks I should thank him when I would see him again because I could have died if he hadn’t made the professors look for me.
“I can’t tell you what to do,” James starts. His eyebrows draw together and he leans a little closer to Harry. “But if it’s true, and Draco doesn’t want anything to do with you now that he knows you’re gay, you need to leave it be. Even though you have a massive crush on him.”
But back to the prediction. We had to go and drink tea and then read each other's tea dregs. I first took a look at Draco’s, which told us he was going to suffer but be very happy about it. He joked that it was always a hardship to be with me, that I made him suffer every minute I wasn’t around, but that he never been this happy in his entire life, so it was all good. Hermione told us to stop being gross, that not everyone wants to know about our sappy love life.
“They won’t let him see me,” Harry says. His shoulders drop and he stares at his broom.
“Yes, I love you,” he says.
Draco’s lips slide from Harry’s mouth to his neck. Teeth scrape over the skin as Draco pushes Harry’s stomach to the floor. Harry feels a sharp pain when the teeth break his skin and warm blood trickles down Harry’s throat. Draco keeps pushing inside Harry while his lips cover the wounds on his neck. The legend of the vampire student comes back to Harry mind and he can’t believe he never connected the dots. Draco never wants to go outside when the weather is nice. He’s touch is always cold and he hardly eats any food. Nobody knows his parents and even Harry’s father mentioned that he thought the Malfoy name had died out years ago. Even though they did had a Malfoy in their class, a good looking blond according to Sirius.
Harry makes it his mission to get to know Malfoy better. He asks him for help with his potion homework one day when they are both in the library. It is the start of sweet smiles and trips to the library to do their homework together. Ron calls Harry a traitor for falling for a Slytherin. Both Harry knows it’s just banter and that Ron doesn’t mean anything by it. Harry has forgotten all about the crazy vampire legend. One day Draco leans in close and places his soft cold lips on Harry. Harry’s heart skips a beat and he can’t stop smiling for days. They join each other for breakfast or dinner, breaking the hostilities between their houses. Nott ignores them all, but Hermione finds a friend in Pansy and Dean and Blaise share painting techniques like it’s the most natural thing in the world.
“You need to forget about him, Harry. It’s clear he’s forgotten about you,” Neville says.
Harry pushes Neville to the side. “Don’t be an ass,” he says. “Just because I’ve got a crush doesn’t make him gay.”
“What is wrong with me answering for us what we want?” Harry asks. “It’s not like I would tell you something Draco hasn’t already agreed with.”
"WHAT?!"
"Oh, I do mind." Harper laughed, and it sounded ugly. The other two joined in bad synchronization. "Think we fear you, eh, Malfoy." The younger Slytherin spat at his name. "Tch, look at you now. No one's on your side. No more minions, Malfoy? Poor Malfoy. You're just nothing but a defenseless traitor. Traitor of the Dark Lord and the Wizarding World. No one wants you here, Malfoy. You're pathetic!"
The Slytherin blond boy blinked for the third time.
"Come, Potter." Draco walked them to his private dining room and called Tippy to serve Potter dinner.
"Out." Draco repeated, then walked to the door. Before he opened it, he called over his shoudler, "In case you want to go back to your room, I've charmed the door to let you in if you ever wanted to hide in here again." And Draco left his room to head toward the forest.
Potter was mumbling something. So fast and vague that Draco had to ask him to repeat the words.
"Can I move tomorrow?"
He waited until bedtime and then braved himself to visit Potter's room.
Did Potter have nightmares every night? Draco let himself sleep embracing the other boy.
"Calm down, Potter. Take a deep breath. You can control it." Draco whispered into Potter's ear. "You can do it. I'm holding you now. You can do it. Shush, calm down…" The boy in his arms had stopped struggling. Draco heard as he tried to even his breathing between sobs. To encourage him, Draco slowly moved his hand up and started to run his hand through the dark hair, massaging the scalp gently so as to not startle the boy. He kept running his hand through Potter's hair until he felt that the boy had calmed down enough. The wild magic surrounding them simmered down, right up until Draco sensed a faint scent of spring – and then it was gone.
"I…I…I was in Grimmauld Place and suddenly it went chaotic so I went back to Hogwarts but no one opened the gate for me. I didn't know where else to go so I uh, somehow Apparated outside the Manor and when I tried to open the gate, it let me in." Potter shrunk under Draco's stare.
Draco interrupted his laugh. He planted his eyes on Potter's face, waiting until the dark-haired boy made eye contact with him. And when he did, Draco grabbed his shirt and he kissed him.
He arrived at the class just as Professor Slughorn entered the room. Today they would work in pairs. He saw all the Eighth years and Seventh years were already self-paired. This meant he would work alone. Which was fine by him. Actually, it was better, because then he could concentrate on brewing without the disturbance of an incapable partner. Like Potter. He checked who the dark haired boy's partner was and found himself smirking when he saw Thomas was the partner. They both sucked in Advanced Potions.
"Yes. All in perfect state." Draco stared at Harry for a few second, and then rolled his eyes. "It's not the reason I invited you here, Harry, nor the present I've promised you. I was just checking this place. Been a year I left it." Draco snapped his fingers over Harry's face to erase the confusion frown on the boy's face. "Do you like the ring, Harry?" Draco asked when Harry had his focus fully on Draco.
"Easier to live that way than your way, Mr. Perfect." Potter snorted.
"So, er…does this mean dinner at Great Hall is a no today?" Potter ducked his head, trying to hide his red face as his stomach rumbled audibly. Draco had held the boy back for almost two hours. It had to be almost six now. Draco could have said that Potter could take his dinner in the hall but he knew better. He knew Potter felt responsible for the gossip about him that had flooded the student body, and if Draco took his dinner in the hall, it would be unbearable.
"Look!" Potter showed Draco his left arm. His flawless, smooth left forearm. Without the scar of Death Eater mark and its toxicant dark magic.
"What now?" Draco looked down at his wand. "Oh, it must be because you're here, Potter! You're distracting me!"
"Haven't finished yet, you two? Anyway, guess what, Filch found Harper in the dungeon," said the boy.
"Why did you hide it here? Why didn't you keep and use it?" Draco lifted his head slowly to see Potter.
Harry turned his face to see Draco and all he did was staring at the blond open mouthed.
Draco let his hand fall to Potter's lap. For a moment, time stopped around them, and they were staring at each other.
Draco gasped.
"I can't believe it! Don't tell me that's your potions essay parchment, Potter!" Draco stared at the parchment laid on the bed in disbelief.
"Er…is Headmistress McGonagall in her office right now?" Potter asked the gargoyle. The statue opened his eyes and closed them again.
Draco, Potter and the ex-Death Eaters Disapparated to the Ministry of Magic.
"Harry! Where have you been? Are you all right?" Granger ran toward Potter.
"Same as we had tonight, Tippy. Now go." Draco sat on the opposite chair from Potter.
"How do you know about the cupboard?" Potter seemed suddenly afraid.
"Yes, it's time. We've been doing some research and been prepared for this." Another dark wizard showed a hostile face. "To, once again, resurrect the Dark Lord!"
Draco and Potter stepped on the raising stair that brought them to the office's door.
"W-well, I…intended to lend him my wand just before he took it from me…" Draco blushed visibly.
"Potter!" Draco called out as they walked out from the greenhouse. Potter slowed down his steps, waiting for Draco to catch up with him. "So, tomorrow, right?"
Draco's proposal was followed by a horror scream from Lucius who was just stepped into the Receiving Room. Harry turned his head toward the senior Malfoy and Draco was so shocked by the sudden and unnoticed visit that he froze in their inappropriate pose. Narcissa appeared beside her husband and glanced at him amusingly.
"Potter, we're heading to the forest." Draco stated.
"You better hold me tight, Malfoy. That is, if you don't want to fall from above in the air." Potter laughed when Draco clutched onto Potter as if his life depended on it.
A wizard student without a wand.
"A corporeal
His scarf really suited those beautiful eyes, Draco thought.
It was four sharp and the class was over. Draco tidied his parchments, quill, ink and the book then reached down for his dragon leather bag, only to find nothing. He looked down, searching for his bag. He was sure he'd put it just beside his bench. He looked around his desk but couldn't find it.
"But…I don't understand. I mean, this ring. Isn't it a ring of…of…" Harry tilted his head up more and furrowed, thinking hard of something.
"Let me see you hold it, Harry." Dumbledore's portrait ordered. Potter reached for the wand in Draco's hand. The wand stilled in Potter's grip.
"Potter, I believe it's yours." Draco handed Potter the parchment as the boy reached the door handle.
Draco saw Potter but didn't call him out. Instead Draco doubled his speed until they both walked side by side. When they arrived at their chambers, Draco walked Potter to his room.
His senses returned full on when he heard something from afar. He rose up abruptly in alert. He was in the Forbidden Forest, possibly noon at its peak, alone, and without a wand. He gulped. He better- No, he had to leave the forest now!
"It's my mother's. It's powerful but, it's not the same… Doesn't quite understand me."
The days went by in a blur, and Draco was getting more tense with each new day. He hoped his father would have secured and sealed all their rooms and valuable possessions at the Manor when Saturday came with the Ministry parade.
When they arrived at Draco's wing, Draco pulled the other boy by the arm against him.
They ate silently in the blissful peace of Tuesday evening, in Draco's room.
They were in Draco's room now. Dinner was forgotten. They had gone back to the Scottish Highlands to hide the Elder Wand again, this time under Draco's hand, but the wand was once again showing its refusal to be abandoned there. Now, the Deathstick, of which the legend said that murder was necessary in order to gain mastery of it, looked content in its new master's presence.
"It shocked me!" Potter waved his hand.
"Ready?" Draco had Harry nodded firmly. He bit his bottom lip, unsure if he'd do it right without hurting Harry.
Draco's right hand slipped from the stick. And at the same time, he felt a shock in his left hand.
Suspicious.
"Fix yourself, Potter." Draco gave the example by pulling out a box of truffles from the box. Opening the lid of the assortment box, Draco enjoyed his favorite assortment while watching the dark-haired boy eyeing the box's contents.
"Uh, shall we go then?" Draco took the green pouch from his trunk and slipped it safely into his pocket.
Refreshed and feeling better, Draco sat on the unoccupied bed. His scarf was on it. He grabbed it and brought it to his face. It had a faint smell that was Potter; fresh meadow and a hint of Potter's scent of magic. Ah! He remembered. He wanted to know how magic had smelled. But even thinking about it again now, that had been the first time he had found a magic that could create a scent. If a wizard or a witch with very strong magic like Potter had their own magic scents, how come he had never been able to smell the Dark Lord's or Dumbledore's? Or, was it only Potter who had a scent to his magic? If so, why was he only noticing it now? Unless…he had always sensed it but hadn't been aware of it? He did smell spring around sometimes. That's why he liked Hogwarts, because it had a spring scent which he'd thought was the product of a charm that altered the Hogwarts atmosphere. Just like the ceiling's charm in the Great Hall.
"Come for me, Harry." Draco whispered over Harry's bottom lip and nibbled on it. A big moan answered him. Harry opened his eyes and staring at Draco intensely that it almost broke Draco's control.
Draco inhaled deep, trying to control his emotions.
"Oh, Harry, stop looking at us like that. We're fine with you two together." Granger squeezed Potter's arm. Of course, both Draco and Potter were shocked by her statement.
They ate in silence.
Draco gave Potter's door a soft knock, and he didn't have to wait long before the door opened and Potter stood in front of him.
Draco casted Tempus, and saw that there were still twenty-five minutes left before the Advanced Potions class began. He was leaning against the wall of the Quidditch pitch, chewing a sweet n' sour green apple he'd picked from the fruit bowl on the common room. He didn't really feel like attending class. One skip would be fine. He'd already mastered all the potions of the advanced potions book anyway. Besides, it would only cause him harm if he tried to do today's potion with his mother's wand. The potion they would brew today needed wand work and he doubted the wand would collaborate long enough for him not to kill anyone before the end of the class.
hover on the spot, Potter's stag running it. "What is your
." Potter said and a narrow beam of light shone from the wand's tip.
"Being trapped in the Manor for a year has definitely corrupted your mind, mother, if you're befriending Potter now." Draco saw his father smirk at his words.
"Finally, young Malfoy. We've been waiting for you. Didn't expect you this soon however. Tch, pity, the fun should end so quickly." The Auror gave Lucius Malfoy a distasteful look.
"Oh, Draco, ahhh… D—" Harry threw his head back. Hands were clutching the silky white sheets so hard they might tear. He arched up as Draco moved scandalously inside him heavenly times.
"Wait a minute," Millicent said, "Now if I recall it again, the scarf was kind of just like yours, Draco. "
Draco broke the kiss with a gasp. He stared at Potter with a hundred questions in his head.
It was really good luck that there were only nine students in the returned seventh-year boys. Not to mention he was the only Slytherin boy to return to Hogwarts that year.
"There's the cave! Come on!" Potter ran inside the dark cave. Draco followed behind, entering the damp and now dim cave. Potter had casted
Secretus Prisma: made up chambers.
"Wait! Malfoy…" Potter held the door and stepped inside Draco's room without invitation.
." Potter took a step forward. His eyes locked to Harper's viciously.
"Yeah. After hearing from you, I think I'll give it a try." Harry trailed Draco's neck with his fingertips. He added, "And don't say that you are right."
"I'm fine." Draco clutched his wrist still and began to walk toward the chambers.
Potter did the biting-his-bottom-lip thing again. It was starting to disturb Draco, in an odd way he couldn't describe.
"So, Potter, what are you going to do after Hogwarts?" Draco asked chattily.
"Oh, nothing serious. I got hit if I made mistake. Just normal, Malfoy." Potter shrugged.
"Where are you going?" Potter looked at Draco with his hand holding a sweet half-way to his mouth.
Draco must have forgotten to set the alarm because when he woke up, the sun's rays were piercing through his royal-green curtains. He also noticed his arms were full of Potter's body. He didn't remember having him in his arms last night.
"I don't need your protection, Potter." Draco however, stood fidgety at the way Potter was looking at him. "Why you don't want everybody around you?"
"Yes, mother. I'll visit my cottage today. It's been a long time since the last time I checked it." Draco prayed his mother wouldn't ask if he was going with someone.
"Wear it. At least your neck won't get chilled out." Draco walked pass the still boy. Without looking back, he called, "Come on, Potter. I'm starving!" The blond heard a shuffling movement behind. He pulled a smirk as Potter appeared beside him. His soft scarf was twisted around Potter's neck.
"What in Merlin's name are you doing here?" Draco stared down at Potter with intimidating eyes.
"Potter!" Draco felt panic start to rush within his veins.
It was ten minutes before nine and their first class on Tuesday. Draco had never woken up this late before! In the best record of Hogwarts, Draco cast cleaning and refreshing spells on himself and dressed, grabbing his bag and running toward the Advanced Potions class in the dungeon. Meanwhile Potter dashed out, back to his own room, to do the same.
Tonight, Narcissa demanded Potter to join them at dinner because tomorrow he and Draco would return to Hogwarts. For the entire time, Potter ate clumsily and once in a while stole glances to Narcissa. Draco's suspiciousness toward his mother increased. There must have been something with them both. Before dinner Draco asked his father about it and Lucius scorned and left him when his mother spotted them.
Bless Merlin, as soon as he sat in the Great Hall at dinner that day, Icarus came with a letter and a small package. Draco gave his eagle owl a treat after he secured the letter and package into his robe pocket.
Potter obediently slid the platinum ring back down. He studied Draco's face before saying, "Merlin, Draco. For a moment there I thought you looked panicked. What's wrong with having a wife in the future?"
Last night, Draco couldn't talk to Potter to ask what the boy had said to his friends. But this morning, he had to get to him. So right at seven thirty Draco sat in the common room, waiting for Potter.
"Stay away from him!" Lucius tried to stand up.
"Dragons taking over the Wizarding World." Draco opened his potions book and started to read the serpent poison chapter.
"No, I'm fine. But thank you, Malfoy. Um, see you tomorrow then?" Potter looked like he was considering Draco's offer at first.
They were both lost in thought.
"So, I guess I'll see you in Herbology, then?" Potter rubbed the back of his neck.
Summer had come. Draco and Harry sat in a compartment with Granger and Weasel. It was their last ride on the Hogwarts Express, so they savoured the last trip from Hogwarts to Kings' Cross in peace.
"Malfoy, it's seven! We better hurry! I'll take a shower in my room and I'll come here again, okay." Potter dashed out of the room.
Draco looked deep into Harry's eyes and waited for few seconds. He lowered his head and kissed Harry in tender gesture. He let his lips lingered against Harry's until the boy began to kiss him back passionately. Slowly Draco began to move once; drew out few inches and then pushed back in. The motion was rewarded by a low moan. Draco repeated the movement and each time the speed accelerated. Low moans soon began to change to throaty moans of high pleasure. Impatience calls for his name between gasps and moans grew as Draco released his mouth from Harry and planted it to every inch of Harry's writhing body.
Potter unfolded the parchment and studied the…
"You what?" Draco gave the dark-haired boy a wide-eyed look.
"She's not my girlfriend." Potter snapped.
"Draco..." Husky whisper from Harry brought the blond up to the surface of the build-up heaven.
They'd been walking without stop for almost three hours now.
The Eighth years were parked at the Secretus Prisma chambers on the West wing, halfway to the side of the fifth floor, near the staircase leading up to the Ravenclaw common room. The chambers consisted of twelve rooms with double four-poster beds with a personal bathroom each. Separated by a long cozy common room, the left side were the boys' chamber and the right side was the girls'.
"Draco!" Narcissa snapped sharply.
And then Draco gasped.
"Yes." Potter replaced the unique wand into the wall's crack.
Draco exhaled a big sigh. He grabbed his green cashmere scarf from the bed and draped it to Potter's neck.
He let out a scream and bolted. The black horse-like beast was now face to face with him. From the corner of his eye, Draco noticed the Unicorn had risen up from the ground and was now standing firm. The Unicorn ducked the side of its head against Draco's cheek.
"The Drawing room!" Draco ran to the source of the cry. Potter followed close behind.
Draco thought for a moment while checking his body, looking for something available for Potter. And then his eyes fell on his middle finger. He snapped his head to look up at his mother.
"Take off your robe, Potter." Draco asked Potter in a singsong tone.
"Bollocks," Potter said between his laughs, "It's just funny to hear you say bollocks. So un-Malfoyish!"
Draco threw his bag and robe to the desk and then lay down on the unoccupied bed. His mind was wandering from the Daily Prophet to Potter. Today's events with Potter were a big confusing to Draco. He thought about his attraction toward the dark-haired boy in the past seven years studiously.
"All right…" Potter handed the wand to Draco.
"Woh! That felt good!" Potter stretched his body then took a seat beside Draco on bed. Draco eyed him.
Draco pulled out the wand from his pocket and showed it to the portrait.
When they had entered their chambers, Potter was welcomed by Granger in the common room. Draco didn't stop to watch their reunion and walked straight to his room. He thought Potter would come to his room afterward, but he waited until dinner time and no one had knocked. So Draco left his room for the Great Hall for dinner. When he walked out of his room, Ron Weasley was coming out of his own room. Draco gave him a brief glance and he saw the other boy looking at him with the same flat expression as his. Draco moved a bit faster to out walk him and he noticed Weasel slowing down so they wouldn't meet on the way to dinner. When Draco arrived outside the Great Hall, he saw students gathered at a corner. He intended to ignore them and enter the Great Hall but stopped when he heard Weasel's yell.
"Yes, you can't. But this wand," Potter raised his wand to show it to Draco, "was once broken."
"Harder! Try harder!" Potter encouraged Draco.
Fifteen minutes later Potter and his two friends appeared on the common room.
"It hurt!" Draco managed to say with his clenched jaw.
"Oh please, don't deny what is obvious, Harry. And yes, Malfoy, we know you two shared your room too many times to count. Besides, Harry wearing your significant ring is a huge giveaway, Malfoy." Granger looked at Draco and Potter as if they were children caught with their hands in a cookie jar.
Draco took out the wooden box again from his trunk.
"All right, let's go back to the manor. After a quick shower." Draco buried his face to Harry's hair and nuzzling on it before they rose up from the white sofa.
"Well, I didn't think you'd want your wand back. Besides, its damage is…bad enough. I didn't think it could be fixed in any way. But your mother's wand is broken just the same as mine once…"
"Mind if I try breaking it?" Draco smirked. He needed something to relieve his bad mood.
"Malfoy, I can't go in! The gate didn't let me!" Potter stood before the wrought-iron gates.
Potter's hand slipped through Draco's hair; his other hand planted on Draco's neck. Draco himself tightened his arms around the other boy. If they kept doing this, in no time Draco would master the art of kissing. And as if reading his mind, Potter murmured how good Draco was at this. Draco broke their kiss and looked at Potter, scrutinizing him carefully.
"Tomorrow, eight o'clock sharp outside the Manor, Harry," Draco said and bid the boy goodbye at the train Station. And then he got inside his car and drove home. He couldn't wait for tomorrow. When Draco arrived at the Manor, his parents welcomed and congratulated him for his perfect N.E.W.T.s score.
"Yeah, all right." Draco returned to his bed and slipped into one side of it. He looked beside him and saw Potter lying back in his méridienne sofa.
"Um…" Potter released his grip and put his fingertip on his chin, thinking.
"Bloody Merlin!" Draco cursed himself mentally. How could he have forgotten about it at all! Now, how to explain it to Granger without giving away his forgetfulness? Wait. Was that why Potter had been acting weirdly these days? Did the boy think Draco gave it to him?
"You did it again. So, can you, Potter, fix my wand? Are you positive my mother's wand can be fixed?" Draco asked. "Look, Potter, I know this isn't your fault at all. But I just…" Draco bit his bottom lip, staring at Potter's emerald eyes, pleading him. And then Draco's eyes fell down below Potter's face. A green cashmere scarf was wrapped loosely around Potter's neck, covering the Gryffindor's chin. Potter followed his gaze and when his eyes fell to the blond's scarf, he gasped.
"You're brilliant!" Potter looked at Draco in admiration and smiled widely at him.
. To create even an incorporeal one is generally considered a sign of great magical power. Now, let's see your
"Late dinner, Potter." Draco pulled out a plate of French toast and two glasses of water.
"What?" Draco gave his mother a clueless expression.
Draco stared at Potter, considering the idea. Though he wanted so much to stay at the manor a little longer, Draco's logic won over it.
Ah, now Draco remembered. The boy's father was a Death Eater. Several times
June came quickly, and before they knew it it was the N.E.W.T. week. Seventh and Eight years dominated the library that whole week. They all looked tense, stressed and totally off the whole time. Even Draco had to calm and encourage Harry that he would be able to sit the exams and pass them. He even promised a good gift if Harry passed his N.E.W.T.s.
"Go on, take some. You haven't gotten your dinner, have you? There…" Draco put the truffles box on his lap and pulling out the rest of the wooden box contents.
"Draco?" The elder man tilted his head slightly.
to the four wizards, binding them with the magical rope.
Both boys swallowed hard, almost audibly. Since they were both too shocked by the revelation of their current state, none of them dared to move or take their eyes off the other's.
If it was human, Draco could say that the beast had just arrogantly ignored him. The beast whizzed again, vapour rising from its nostrils into the cold air and slowly it turned his head back toward Draco. Draco gulped. Slowly, the beast padded closer. Closing his eyes, Draco thought this was his last chance to breathe. But the terrifying things that he thought would happen didn't come. Draco opened his eyes and blinked. The beast, the big murderous-looking beast, put both its front legs by the fallen trunk and in one blink, the heavy trunk was thrown several feet from the Unicorn.
Hermione. Who
When he was six he knew fear. How it licked through his body; the paralysis that took root in his limbs and kept him frozen like a marionette, just as much a puppet on a string. Curled fetal-like in a dark corner he cowered, head hidden and eyes shut as his father yelled words that he couldn't distinguish. If only he was brave enough to protect his mother; courageous enough to do something other than fervently wish he could close his ears as easily as he could shut his eyes. Even in the safe clutch of darkness, fear found him. Although, it wasn't the threat of the boogieman which made him sleep hidden in his closet, blanket held close.

Harry.
“Draco” Harry took another calculated step toward him. “Cut me. Scar me. Bleed me. Make. Me. Bleed.” Each word was accentuated, words that had been spoken before now taking on a new meaning. It wasn't desperation this time that fuelled the need to cut. Or it was, but a different sort of desperation, a game to be played, the pain Draco gave taking on a sweet edge, the blood not a redemption, but a medium to explore.
Harry looked like he might be sick, his face pale, his normally vibrant eyes dulled. Long moments passed, the stillness only punctured by the sound of a dripping tap off in the distance. Finally, Harry spoke.
"Don't be like that, Potter. I'm sure you'd look charming with a bird on your head."
He wonders if he could persuade Jace over.
You've been with men since that, of course. The nameless bodies used to sate an itch; relieve the tension. None have ever come close to this: this intensity and need which leaves the room heavy with a palpable urgency.

He fears he's already gained an asterisk beside his name in their black book, and it would be an unfortunate turn of events to suddenly find himself barred from tonight's provocatives. A coil of anticipation unfurls itself along Harry's spine at the thought of what awaits him this evening, arousal digging heady talons into his vertebrae until he's completely overwhelmed and near begging from mere fantasy.
Magnus surreptitiously rearranges himself in his chair, deducing that particular train of thought was one best left for when one of the three was not sitting, slightly plastered, in his living room. Or for when all three were. Restraint, admittedly, has never been one of his virtues.
," the man mutters, voice strained.
“Draco.” Harry's voice had changed, the name coming out husky, warm. Needy. Lust now burned hot across his features, intertwined with something else, flanked by something equally primordial. “Draco” he said, and it was almost a purr. “Cut me.”
A boundless tempest of citrus battering his body, lemon woven through every mote and dust and flicker carried on the air, permeating in totality the sum of Harry's entire being. He swims in it, could bathe in it, roll himself up in it and wear it as a cloak. Delicate, overpowering, subtle, callous, it tangles and chokes through his olfactory passages, claiming
And lemons.
In the distance an owl hoots, and Harry’s reminded of what he’s lost. The joy the sound used to bring, the comfort. Inside his jacket, his fingers curl into a ball. What he’d give to stroke her feathers one more time. When he turns back, Draco’s regarding him with an expression Harry can’t place. “Potter. Are you okay?”
You watch him dance.
Draco's reached Harry. He climbs onto the chair, lithe, pressing his knees either side of Harry's hips so he's straddling him, fingers coming to rest on his chest.
Your fingers tremble as they trace the boundaries of his visage, unsteady under the growing certainty it is indeed him. Unidentifiable, your ass; it's not easy to veil features fantasised about since youth now you let yourself look.
Draco snorts. It is an undignified noise, something Harry couldn't imagine the Draco of Hogwarts emitting. But they aren't the children they were at school, are they? Harry's existence is proof of that. Even more so is the fact he’s standing here with Draco under the anamorphic light of a waning moon, and Draco isn't running. Isn't throwing curses.

“Two weeks,” Draco repeats. He’s walking away already, managing to merge into the rising dawn despite black robes. Harry wonders, as Draco disappears the same way he did previously, why he doesn’t simply apparate?
“Harry” Draco whispered, and it was meant as a warning. Yet his body betrayed him, and it came out as more of a moan.

forearm; the one that will forever mark your ostracism from the wizarding world. Still, he either doesn’t realise or care as he pulls you through the throng and out the door into the cool, damp of night.
The words left his mouth unbidden. “I would rather be here with you, Harry, than living in a world you refuse to inhabit.”
"Not helping," Harry mutters under his breath, and Magnus barely resists the temptation to mention a certain other beautiful, arrogant boy. He does so love watching Harry splutter red-cheeked denials of 'what... no... I never said Jace's arse would look good in a thong!' (Ascot, 6 months or so ago, an indecent amount of vodka), throwing timid looks over his shoulder as if Draco would hear the truth in his protests and make a fuss. Harry certainly has a type, and Magnus will admit it's an...
Before him was a big tree trunk, looking freshly collapsed to the ground, and apparently hit a creature, trapping it underneath. So moment ago, perhaps Draco had been awakened by the sound of that collapsing tree. He rummaged into his bag for a wand but stopped as he remembered it was broken.
Draco liked the feeling of kissing Potter. He could say that he was addicted to Potter. There was this funny but pleasant sensation flowing through his body when his lips touched Potter's. And then when Potter slipped his arm around his neck and the other hand through his hair, like now, Draco's mind was focused on those seductive touches. Also when he explored Potter's mouth and sucked his tongue, it felt like he was drinking Superior Red wine. He could have done this forever if he hadn't remembered that they were supposed to be returning to Hogwarts. Reluctantly Draco broke the kiss. He looked deep into the emerald eyes before giving Potter one last brief kiss and then released him.
"Concentrate hard on one happy memory." Potter whispered into Draco's ear. Draco shivered. If Potter kept doing that, Draco wouldn't be able to concentrate at all. "Concentrate!" he whispered again.
At Herbology classes that day, they pretended they didn't see each other.
"Morning was so hours ago. My stomach informs me that it's lunch time." Harry spoke without releasing the finger from his mouth. Draco chuckled at the act and looked at Harry in adoration.
"Oh I insist you to try." Draco pulled Potter's hand.
"Malfoy, it's me, Potter." Draco vaguely heard the familiar voice. He couldn't see clear in the dark. Draco's heart was beating aloud and fast. But when he heard
"Eating," Potter answered emotionlessly.
"Um…yeah," Potter whispered between lung-fulls of air.
. Though, he hoped much he could make a corporeal one. Between two practices, he would break off for a while and venture around to check the plants. Until today, he had found fifty-two types of plant and some other materials to use for potions brewing. The forest was rich with potions ingredients. That's why Draco loved the Forbidden Forest. He wondered how many plants he could find if he wandered deeper into the heart of the forest.
"What?" Draco snapped in annoyance.
"Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy, I hope you have a good explanation for this." The headmistress stepped on the stairs toward her office, followed by the two boys.
Draco lifted his eyebrow elegantly.
As they finished their breakfast, Draco put on his warmest outer. He eyed Potter taking his spectacles beside the pillow he'd used to sleep last night.
"Dunno. Never saw it like that before. There, Tenebrus, we have to go now." Potter patted the beast but it wouldn't go away. "Uh, I think it likes you."
EX-DEATH EATERS SEEK THE DARK LORD'S APPRENTICE:
A third year Slytherin boy walked into the Great Hall and approached closer to his side of the table.
"Magic." Potter chuckled softly. "Professor- well, ex-professor Lupin gave it to me."
The gargoyle groaned in dismay and revealed the stairs toward the Headmaster's office.
And Potter touched Draco's lips with his.
Thursday morning came and that day Draco had planned to work with his potions formula. He let Potter sleep the whole day and ordered Tippy to provide anything the boy needed, and to inform Potter that he was working with his potions and didn't want to be disturbed. The whole day Draco worked in his potions lab on the ground floor of his wing. At dinner he decided to stop his experiments, returned to his room, took a shower, then joined his parents in the master dining room.
"B-but Harry, are you sur—"
"Potter?" he called. "I thought you'd sleep in my room?"
Reluctantly Draco let go of Potter and climbed down from his bed. When he'd stood away from the bed, Potter spelt the bed curtains close. So the boy didn't want his friends knowing he was here. That made Draco smile happily, somehow. Draco put on his robe and went opened his door.
The place they were searching for was revealed right before their eyes.
since his third year. The Gryffindor boy was looking back at him. Draco looked away with his wand hand dangling at his side.
"W-wha-" Potter woke with Draco's voice.
"What?" Draco repeated, getting more annoyed by the second.
"Oh, that." Potter grinned at him. "I have a better idea than telling you what it is."
"No, you can't." Potter noticed Draco's shock. "I know your father needs it. There are still a lot of ex-Death Eaters who have fled into hiding seeking for revenge from your father."
"Tenebrus?" Draco kept his eyes on the beast.
"Yes, mother." Draco blushed.
He kept walking deeper into the forest until he'd reached the permitted boundary line. This was as far as he'd ever explored the Forbidden Forest. As he found "his" tree, he threw his back against the big trunk.
!" Draco yelled in anger, turning his body to face Potter.
"If…that's all right with you, can I…" Potter sat up.
"They came with the Auror, bringing a legal letter from ministry. I had to let them in." Draco's father eyed the Death Eaters one by one.
Potter stopped.
"I don't understand why you didn't sit on the head chair, Malfoy. Didn't you say you're the Manor head now?" Potter asked as they walked back to Draco's wing.
"About what?" Potter straightened, looking tensed.
cast, Mr. Harper."
"Harry," Draco stroked Harry's hair tenderly, comforting him, "Relax…Take your time. I'll wait for you."
"They is very well." Tippy answered cheery.
"What are you going to do now?" Draco stared at Potter who was standing before him.
"What is Master Harry Potter wanting for dinner?" Tippy bowed.
"She was very scary, Malfoy!" Potter squealed.
"And just how did you think I'd wake you up?" Draco raised his eyebrows.
Draco sat on the bed and listened to Potter explaining the cards game and played along with the boy until lunchtime. They stopped the game and went to the Great Hall for lunch and then got back to Draco's room to play another card game. Silly games, Draco thought, but fun to kill the time.
