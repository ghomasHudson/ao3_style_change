Malfoy rolled his eyes and sighed again before moving over to Harry's bed and sitting down at the opposite end so they were facing each other. "I just started thinking about how you wouldn't have ever done any of that stuff in the tomb if the test hadn't made you. Or...if I hadn't made you. It feels...I feel dirty and kind of sick thinking that I forced you to touch me like that."
Harry frowned but didn't decide to the pursue the matter. Their flight to Paris was short, and hopefully by then, Malfoy would have relaxed enough to realize the plane wasn't that bad. He just needed time.
"A sabbatical, Potter?" McGonagall said in a clipped manner. The Headmistress stood behind her desk, one hand laid on the edge of it as if supporting herself to keep standing as she took in this news. "You have not worked here long enough for a sabbatical. And in the middle of the term. I cannot allow you to...finding a replacement on such short notice, I-"
Harry rolled his eyes and pushed his backpack farther into the overhead compartment before holding out a hand for Malfoy's messenger bag. Despite both bags having Undetectable Extension Charms on them, they had gotten through security easily and much faster than some of the other passengers. Of course, this was due to Malfoy's quick thinking for a Confundus Charm on the guards. It didn't take a genius to know that a guard pulling out a broomstick and cauldron from a small bag would have been cause for alarm and almost certainly some memory charms.
They both looked up, and Harry frowned. That couldn't be right. There were still half a dozen passengers to go before them. Well, maybe one of them had been going to the Leaky Cauldron too.
"People approach me because I'm famous. But, the real friends I have are the ones that stuck around even once they realized I had no clue what I was doing half the time and still liked me for who I was underneath the fame." He reached out and stroked two fingers over the back of Malfoy's hand. "You could have some of the greatest experiences of your life if you let people in."
Potter took a long drink and was smiling when he lowered the mug. "It's rather good. Who taught you to...to..."
Draco felt awkward. This was one reason why he had kept it all hushed up. After the war, he had wanted to be alone, and he had succeeded. Donating some of his family's fortune had been a effort to help somehow since he felt guilty for not helping in the battle at all. And then, somehow, by writing the letters and sending out the money, he had grown to find he seriously meant the condolences he wrote in the letters. It had broken him to write some of them, realizing that if those people had still been alive, he would have liked to get to know them in the post-war world they were building.
Draco thought about it for a moment. "Maybe he chose to be buried somewhere he admired? I mean, the Ancient Egyptian wizards were known for their architecture, potion advancements, and, of course, clever spells put on tombs to prevent grave robbers." He paused and then closed his eyes in frustration. "I bet anything," he said, opening his eyes again to glare at Potter as if it was his fault for his revelation, "that Slytherin modeled his tomb after their example. It would be like him to devise a set of traps and puzzles you have to be cunning to get past."
Hesitantly, Susan nodded. "More than you could ever imagine." She turned back to the man standing on the other side of her bike, which Draco now noticed had
"I can't believe it," Susan said as she hugged Potter. She pulled back and glanced at Draco. Thankfully, she made no move to hug him and simply shook his hand instead. "What are you guys doing here?"
Harry didn't even register the police cars as they whisked past in pursuit of the car. He was completely focused on Malfoy, whose eyes were wide with shock as he breathed heavily. His head was turned to stare at the street as if still processing what had just happened. He slowly looked back at Harry. His gaze darted to survey their position in which Harry had pulled him flush against his chest, and the blond blushed and stepped back.
It appeared that sometime during the night, the pillows between them had gotten shoved aside. Malfoy was now lying flush against Harry's side, his head resting on Harry's shoulder and one of his hands splayed gently on Harry's chest.
Malfoy shook his head again, and tears formed quickly in his eyes. "It's not the topic exactly," he said softly. "It's my anxiety. It's just the stress and worry over everything that's happened in the past few days building up all at once. I feel the urge to cut sometimes when it gets this bad, but I've been good about not doing it for a few years now. I just put pressure on my wrist to do something with my hands and quell the urge."
Harry's amusement with the handcuff situation quickly became muddled with frustration after Susan had Apparated them back to their hotel. Simply walking down the street to find stores in which to buy canned goods and the like for their trip into the desert was suddenly difficult. Since their left hands were bound and the chain did not reach far enough to walk normally, they only had two options. At first, Harry had walked backward in the street, putting on the expression of mischief as if he were doing this on purpose. After he almost tripped over a dog though, he and Malfoy had agreed it would be best to walk one after another. So, Harry walked slightly behind Malfoy, feeling very much like a dog on a leash.
As Harry set aside another graded essay, this one marked with a 'P', his gaze traveled to the open letter on the corner of his desk. It had arrived from Malfoy at breakfast that morning. It read:
"They're almost, I don't know, four times faster than a Firebolt. It'll get us there much faster." Harry didn't know why he was pushing for them to go on a plane exactly. He had never been on one either. He just knew that Uncle Vernon had taken a few business trips abroad and had always seemed to be in a better mood when he returned, congratulating no one in particular on such a feat of engineering. Harry suspected he did this to try to impress upon Harry how wonderful practical things like Muggle science were compared to the "silly magic tricks" wizards used.
Potter scrubbed a hand over his face, and Draco could practically feel the stress pouring off of him in waves. Or maybe that was his own, because the whole situation Susan was describing sounded like mostly guessing.
To his relief, Potter didn't respond. He only set the knife aside and then angled his hand over the bottle to let his blood run into it. Once it was nearly full, he withdrew his hand and wrapped it in a handkerchief.
"Well...according to legend, this cloak was given to Ignotus Peverell by Death himself," Potter explained, buttoning his bag shut again. "He used it to escape Death for a long time until he finally took off the cloak to join Death. I guess the legend has something to it if we used it to fool a different version of Death."
Susan's gaze fell to the table, and she gave a jerky nod. "I read that about the horcruxes in that tell-all book Hermione Granger wrote last year. Voldemort did come looking for more of Slytherin's possessions during the first war. That's...that's why my family was killed back then. They were all part of this group, and they refused to help him find the pyramid. He slaughtered everyone who was here, and the group only still exists because a few members were in hiding abroad. We're far smaller than we used to be. My whole family has been a part of this group for generations. I could only become a member after I was of age, so I came here right after the battle at Hogwarts."
"And as for showering," Harry continued. "We don't know how long Susan will leave us like this. Working together to do what we would normally do separately is probably what will help change the mark to show us getting along more."
"Talk to you?" Harry asked. For a singular second, he was confused. But seeing how nervous Malfoy looked, he realized almost instantly what the man was getting at. "Oh. You want me to
This made Harry's heart swell with a mixture of hope, happiness, and despair. While having their feelings out in the open could be exciting and lead to an actual relationship, it also meant there was no more pretending. And just because Malfoy was feeling these stirrings for Harry didn't mean he ever wanted to act on them. So, Slytherin would be forcing them to admit things they weren't ready to confront and maybe never wanted to pursue. The thought of Malfoy having feelings but not wanting anything to do with Harry made his heart clench painfully. Well, more painfully than it already was, because he was experiencing a large sense of loss from not having Malfoy in bed next to him.
As the bikes passed them, headed further into the city, Harry gasped, and he felt Malfoy go rigid next to him.
"Well, what would help?" Harry asked seriously, because Malfoy looked more stressed and overwhelmed than he had ever seen him. "Can I do anything?"
But that didn't change the fact that having Potter fall on top of him, one of Potter's knees between his legs and their hips and chests pressing together, those green eyes staring into his with their mouths almost touching...all those feelings had come rushing back like a torrent burst from a dam. And he hated it. Those feelings would not win. They couldn't, not with their lives at stake with the prophecy and the fact that Potter would mock him endlessly if he ever found out Draco had had and maybe still did have feelings for him.
But, as much as Harry was focused on Malfoy, his attention was suddenly pulled to the walls of the chamber. Whereas the previous two chambers had had smooth and blank obsidian stone walls, this one was etched and painted from floor to ceiling with Egyptian-style images. All of them depicted pairs of males in various states of undress and sexual positions. Clearly, Slytherin had wanted his prodigy to have no excuse or lack of inspiration for this task.
Emblazoned on the back of every jacket was a large black badger, its claws being drawn through a tall letter 'H'.
Draco moved back closer to the table but did not sit as Susan nodded and said, "It's about what you've both shown through those actions. Bravery to face Voldemort. Cunning to find a way to help without sacrificing reputation. And just countless other things that I know about you both. Granted, Draco, I didn't talk to you much in school, but word got around. Regardless of how you've changed since school, I know there was a time when you thought like Slytherin himself. Don't snort at me, this is important. Thinking like Slytherin and Gryffindor may just be the things that keep you two alive and help you succeed where others didn't."
"This." Harry pulled a length of silvery fabric from inside his bag, shook it out, and tossed it over them both. He pulled Malfoy down so they were both crouching by the wall, the Invisibility Cloak now successfully hiding their feet as well. As long as the Anubis statue wasn't enchanted with seeing powers akin to those of Mad-Eye Moody's magical eye, then he and Malfoy should have successfully vanished from the room.
Draco shrugged and turned back to the cauldron to stir their hot chocolate. Steam was starting to rise, so he knew it was almost ready. "Possibly," he said as he added a dash of cinnamon. "And it's possible Gryffindor was also obsessed with ancient civilizations. I think that's where the Mayan Empire was located. They were pretty revolutionary and did brave things, I'm guessing. Plus, their temples and such were built in the jungles there."
Merlin, why hadn't he suggested they take a shower together to save time and water? Malfoy wouldn't have gone for it, but it would have made it exceedingly clear what he wanted. Which...right, he couldn't have. They absolutely had to make the mark change to ensure their freedom sooner rather than later. And that meant working together, which Harry was sure also meant trust. If Malfoy suspected him of having seen him naked, those walls would go right back up and hostility would resume.
Draco blinked away the spots from his eyes and he peered around. Susan had been right about the prodigies entering some sort of enchanted mirage realm. Around them was miles and miles of sand, only sand. No Sphinx. No pyramids of Giza. No Cairo.
letting it be known, especially to Potter, that despite disliking him, he had simultaneously had a crush on him throughout school. He had tried to ignore it during their school years, hiding his feelings behind snide remarks and well-chosen spats that acted as defensive walls. But, he had had to face those feelings during their fourth year when Potter was made to compete in the Triwizard Tournament. He had hated the way his stomach twisted during every task and only relaxed when he was sure the black-haired boy was safe. It had only gotten worse in the following years when he had been forced to push even harder against his feelings when he worked for Umbridge, became Voldemort's puppet, and then watched Potter be led into the viper's pit of Malfoy Manor. It had culminated in Potter's apparent death at the Battle of Hogwarts. His own heart had stopped for several beats upon seeing the limp form in Hagrid's arms. He had nearly shattered.
Malfoy's eyebrows drew together. "Yes, Potter," he snapped. "My mother's. But, that's not the point. It-"
They went to Gringotts in silence, and they both withdrew gold from their vaults. They exchanged about half of it for Muggle money, including British pounds, French francs, and Egyptian pounds. Apparently, Potter somehow knew from the Muggles he had lived with that a lot of flights to Africa often had a connecting flight in Paris. Draco barely glanced at the Muggle money as he put it away in his bag. He had never handled Muggle currency, and it felt like a loss to have his heavy galleons changed to paper.
"It was easy to hate you," Draco explained. "The possibility of...of loving you or anything like that...it's fucking terrifying."
But...maybe the answer wasn't magic at all. Muggles panicked like this too, and they managed to calm down without magic. So, Harry thought of a different someone, someone who was good with showing love and support and had comforted him in the past without magical quick-fixes. He thought of a mother, of Mrs. Weasley. What would she have done? Talked. Reassured him. Hugged him. Fed him triple servings of whatever she had made for dinner. That's what she would have done. But how could he apply that to this situation? His relationship with Mrs. Weasley was astronomically different than his with Malfoy.
Harry was already shaking his head by the time Malfoy finished speaking. "No. There is no way we're doing this. It's mental."
Harry knew they had barely scraped the surface of Cairo. It was a huge city, and any amount of secret wizarding shops could be hidden practically anywhere. How long would it take them to find a lead? Earlier that morning when it had become apparent finding a wizard in Cairo was not as easy as they had hoped, they had discussed a plan of switching back and forth between scouring the city and exploring the tombs on different days. Eventually, they would find something promising. They had to.
He was being stupid. What he was feeling...it was just a reaction to Malfoy's behavior. He didn't have actual feelings for the man. It was just him searching for affection, although in the unlikeliest and dumbest of places, when he had had none since Ginny.
It was a knife that Malfoy had produced from another pocket. Harry stepped back in alarm, his fingers itching to reach for his wand. But, he watched in amazement as the man drew the blade across his palm. Bright drops of crimson blood pooled in his hand, and he tipped it to spill a few drops on the map, in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
Just then, a hand closed around his and tugged him along through the throng of people. It was Malfoy, and he had a vice grip on his hand as he tore through the crowd. Harry was sure several people were shoved out of their way with a more tame version of a Hurling Hex.
Draco was vaguely aware of the sound of a door closing as he magicked his pajamas and day clothes to switch places so he was now wearing cargo shorts and a t-shirt and the pajamas were folded neatly on the bed beside his bag.
Harry used magic to heal Malfoy's arm before going any deeper into the pyramid. As soon as the statue had frozen, a door at the other end of the room had appeared.
. He wasn't helping with Draco's resolution to squash and bury his feelings. On the contrary, he was beginning to wonder if Potter wasn't totally as oblivious as he had thought him to be in school. Men did not just hold another man's hand like that. At least, not in his experience. They didn't feel his grip tighten in fear at more turbulence and begin to stroke their thumb across the back of his hand to calm him. That was...something different. Had Draco been so transparent with the whole zipper fiasco that Potter had put the pieces together?
Harry was sure he knew what she was thinking. She had successfully survived all seven Weasleys and seen them out of Hogwarts only to now face the possibility of inviting one of them back. She and Filch would have their work cut out for them with a Weasley on staff.
Draco gave an unsatisfied grunt and slid the vial of blood and his pocket knife across the table. "Let's find out where we're going."
Draco felt like he was suffocating, his ribs being crushed under an invisible boulder. "I...I..." He swallowed, knowing he was trapped, and he took a step back. "Y-yes." He shook his head. "But no one was supposed to know!" He pointed at Susan accusingly. "How do
It was infuriating how unconvinced Potter looked at that moment. Because he needed the man to believe it so he, in turn, could convince himself. Draco didn't honestly think that was how the prophecy worked, but it had to be influencing them somehow, right?
As it advanced, Draco continued backing up. All too soon, he found a wall at his back. Now he understood why the pairs of prodigies whose skeletons were strewn across this very room had failed. One blow had nearly dislodged Draco's shoulder. And with how the figure was holding the staff, the green gash in his chest was almost impossible to reach.
Susan nodded. "But, I can help with what little I do know. And that is that it's in the desert somewhere."
Susan huffed. "Look, I just know what's been told to me, which is what Hufflepuff herself was told. Slytherin couldn't tell her the pyramid's location because it's literally impossible to find unless you're meant to find it."
Harry closed his eyes and listened as Malfoy muttered an incantation to vanish his clothes and then laid his wand down on the vanity counter. Then he was being tugged gently in the direction of the shower until his feet hit the side of the tub and he stopped. The curtain shut with a swoosh.
Malfoy shook his head, and the color in his cheeks became even more pronounced. "The test was only passed because it was consensual like the snake said. I wanted you to touch me. I just..." He swallowed thickly and closed his eyes. He was now pressing his thumbnail hard into the skin of his wrist.
Harry softened a bit. "I know. And that's what you need to decide. I want you to make a decision you feel good about. I'm just worried you're making rash decisions based on two men who died thousands of years ago."
"The plane looked bigger from the outside," Malfoy said. "I didn't realize how many people they would cram into it either."
"Harry? Draco?" She quickly tugged off her helmet. It was Susan Bones, a Hufflepuff girl who had been in the same year as Harry and Malfoy and who had been a part of the DA.
Thank you guys for all the lovely comments on this story so far. Also, did no one catch my tiny Hamilton reference in the last chapter?
A mixture made of relief, annoyance, hope, and anxiety all at once swept through him as Potter outright ignored him and opened the door. The man's silhouette appeared on the other side of the curtain.
"Both of you have your wand hand free," Susan said calmly as if this was his chief worry at the moment, which it most certainly was not. "You two will go back to your hotel in town and spend the next few days gathering the food supplies and whatever else you'll need for the trip to the pyramid. I'll check in every night and see if the mark has changed favorably. Only then will I remove the cuffs."
Potter just frowned, and Draco bristled even more as he stared at him, the man's gaze raking his face. "Whatever," Potter said, obviously unconvinced by this excuse.
"You stayed here?" Potter's eyebrows rose over the top of his glass as he took a drink of butterbeer. He lowered the glass. "I wouldn't have thought you wanted to stay when you could be in your cushy manor."
Malfoy pressed his lips together in a thin line and narrowed his eyes. The man's expression was wiped a moment later though as the bus gave a terrible lurch forward and he braced himself with a hand against the wall to keep his chair from tipping over.
"I didn't know what it was. If you found a memory with your mother's name on it, you would have watched it in a heartbeat too."
Right away, Harry knew this couldn't be the great Salazar Slytherin. Obviously, from the decorations in the burial chamber, which included many silver silk draperies that had been embroidered with hundreds of intricate emerald snakes, it was Slytherin's final resting place, but that stumbling structure of bones was not the founder. And then Harry recalled what Susan had told them about the tomb.
Harry turned his head just a bit to look at him. He was staring pointedly out the window, and while Harry couldn't see his face, he noticed the man's ears were pink.
"So, maybe we should figure out where we're going tomorrow," Draco suggested, turning back to Potter. "The prophecy mentioned something about vines and a jungle. I hope that doesn't mean the Amazon in Brazil."
Draco nodded. "I know. We'll just have to think of another option. Let's just figure out where we're headed first."
"Oh," he said. He shook himself mentally and nodded, trying to keep his expression blank. "Didn't know it could do that. That's a good thing to know, I guess." He took another drink of water. "So, you, uh, got the potion made?"
He couldn't help but want to touch the blond again though as a blush tinged the man's cheeks a dusty rose. But he refrained, reminding himself that pushing people into talking about things before they were ready often led to disastrous results. Instead, he bent and picked up his bag. "Should we go on?"
"No, just listen," Potter said. "I argued with Dumbledore about how the prophecy meant I had to kill Voldemort. But, it didn't mean that. It
"Even so," Draco said, "we still don't know where the pyramid is. You said Hufflepuff didn't even know, so that means you guys don't either."
Harry's eyes snapped open as his heart gave a sharp jolt. He looked around wildly. Slowly, he came to realize he was safe, years and miles away from those images of Voldemort.
They set off again and only stopped for lunch and more water. Draco simultaneously felt like their wandering aimlessly was both futile and productive. The pyramid wouldn't appear until the time was right, but also walking helped keep up the illusion that they were going somewhere and had a destination.
Harry Potter sat in his office, the torches in the room casting long shadows over his desk and burning low as it neared midnight. Still his quill scratched across the parchment before him. The essays from his second years on how to produce a proper Shield Charm had to be graded before the morning. He had already left them a week late as his stress had mounted in the previous fortnight.
"Close your eyes," Malfoy said. He wasn't blushing this time, but rather his expression was taut and closed.
Then why had he acted the way he had in the clothing store? He could have left Malfoy to deal with the zipper. Malfoy would have just stripped the jumper off after a few more minutes of failed attempts and then opted for different clothing. He had done just that anyway. But, for some highly illogical reason, Harry had found himself unlocking the door and entering the changing room, even knowing Malfoy could have been in a state of undress. Then he had helped him as if Malfoy were a child. And then...he had lingered too long, caught on those eyes of bluish grey.
Draco pursed his lips and ignored him, instead looking up at the silver cobra and waiting for the instructions.
"I can't remember," Draco mumbled, though now that Potter brought it up, he was almost sure they hadn't since Draco had stormed off to the pyramid before giving them any time to eat breakfast.
"I forgot you had that," Draco said, straightening once Potter had pulled the Invisibility Cloak off and stuffed it back in his bag. He couldn't help but feel they had cheated the task. He was grateful for Potter's quick thinking for sure, but it didn't feel like they had fulfilled the task like they had been expected to. Other pairs before them wouldn't have had an Invisibility Cloak handy. Granted, he was sure the Disillusionment Charm would have worked if either of them were skilled enough at it.
Draco rolled his eyes. "I know that fairy tale, Potter. Whatever you want to think, it worked, I guess." He started off for the other archway, Potter following a few paces behind. He tried not to pay any attention to the few skulls and femurs he stepped over on the way to the door. It seemed very few pairs had made it this far. Would there be more skeletons in the final task's chamber? Or would it be empty and untouched?
"She stored it how long ago?" Harry asked, obviously stalling. For what, he didn't know. But he was tired and didn't want to hear about prophecies and marks on his arm.
Susan half-stood to lean over Potter's arm and get a closer look at the lion and serpent, both of whom were still glaring warily at each other. The animals hadn't changed position since that night in Potter's office when he had agree to work with Draco.
"Yes, and I also have had a few thousand years to think over the matter, wondering why Godric never came to me. I am still bitter. I want to reunite, but I also want an apology first," Slytherin said. "So, tell Godric, when you find him, that I will be waiting for him in the room where it happened." At these words, Slytherin's ghost began to dissolve back into smoke.
Draco sat at a booth near the back of The Three Broomsticks, his fingers absently tipping a vial of his blood one way and then the other for something to occupy his nerves while he poured over the papers in front of him. The vial was only filled halfway as he had left room for Potter to add his blood. He didn't like the idea of combining his and Potter's blood, but it was necessary to find the tombs. At the very least, they would have to use their blood twice in this manner, and he didn't fancy having to cut his hand open multiple times to do so. And the vial also provided a mess-free way to combine their blood.
He drank more of his water while he continued to people watch. It was rather unsettling how easily Muggles seemed to get along without magic. Granted, everything seemed more inconvenient and they didn't know they were missing out on so much.
"The past few nights," Potter began slowly, "I've thought about how your cock would feel in my mouth."
A little jolt of nerves shot through Draco's stomach as his hand was pushed away from his cock and Potter shifted his body back from Draco's a little. Then Potter closed his hand over Draco's cock at the same time that his other hand moved to cradle his balls.
Harry raised an eyebrow at the same time that his stomach churned into a tight knot. Prophecies, he hated prophecies. In the summer that had followed his fifth year, while mourning the death of his godfather, he had found some tiny solace in knowing that since the entire Hall of Prophecy had been obliterated and all the records destroyed, he had maybe saved some people from hearing prophecies about themselves and becoming trapped like he had felt after hearing his own. But, of course, memories of prophecies still existed. He just hadn't anticipated another about him.
Slytherin's head was the last thing to disappear, and he gave a wan smile. "He'll know what it means." Then he was gone.
As they ate dinner, Draco was the most quiet of the three, only speaking up at choice moments as Susan and Potter talked. Again, he was grateful for her presence since it meant Potter wouldn't be solely focused on him. But, as Potter recounted the story, he also had brief moments of panic until he realized quickly that Potter was changing or omitting a few parts of the story. The man told the events as if the pyramid had simply appeared to them at dawn one day with no mention of divulged secrets of mutual attraction. And graciously, he recounted the pyramid as only having two tests inside, completely skipping from the banshee and Anubis statue challenge to Slytherin's burial chamber.
A black metal shackle fastened itself around Draco's left wrist. Looking at Potter, he saw the man wore an identical one on his left hand as well. A chain of maybe two feet in length connected the two cuffs.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Look, I don't know what you're playing at, Potter, but this isn't funny. Stop smirking! You're mocking me. Just because we...we held hands..."
The steaming water on his back seemed to loosen the tension just slightly, but it was enough to bring down a barrier. He began to sob, holding his hand over his mouth to stifle the sound and praying that the rushing water would be enough to cover any sound that escaped his fingers.
Harry winced but neither moved nor said anything. Malfoy's eyes were shut, and he was shaking. Struck by a sudden idea, call it an urge or something else, Harry laid his free hand over the blond's that was clasped so tightly onto him. "Breathe, Draco," he whispered.
Draco made it through most of the clothes, sorting them into stacks of what he wanted to buy and what he wanted to leave behind. But, he hit a problem with a zip-up jumper Potter had suggested. What the hell was wrong with it? As much as he tried, he couldn't get it to zip correctly. The teeth wouldn't catch, and the pull would simply slide up, connecting the two halves oddly as if he had simply pinned the fabric together with a brooch. Zippers on trousers were no problem since the bottom of them were sewn in place. But putting the pull into the bottom rest to properly connect the teeth was quickly frustrating him.
Potter was staring at him as he seemed to put the pieces together. "This could take a long time," he said.
He showered quickly, being extra careful not to tug on the chain and present an opportunity for Malfoy like he had had. Granted, Harry thought, maybe it wouldn't be such a terrible thing for Malfoy to see. But he didn't jerk on the chain and was soon stepping out of the shower with a towel wrapped around his waist.
"The thought crossed my mind," Malfoy said as he closed another loop of the dais. "But I'm not sure how much that would help."
"Potter, are you alright?" Malfoy asked in a tone that suggested he had asked this same question already. Harry was only then aware of what was happening. Malfoy was sitting on the edge of the bed near Harry's hip, and he was grasping both of Harry's arms. Whether to shake him awake or to hold him down from thrashing, Harry wasn't sure which.
Draco felt it too and looked down at his arm, which was suddenly warm. The mark was changing. As they both watched, the lion and serpent relaxed and bent their heads together so their foreheads touched.
It didn't take them long to find their way back out of the pyramid and to their tent. As soon as the doors of the pyramid closed behind them, it vanished. The landscape around them shimmered, and the Sphinx and the edge of Cairo reappeared in the distance. Though they had walked what felt like hours through the desert initially, it seemed they were only a mile or so away from the Sphinx.
Draco shoved his hand away, and again his face flushed, but this time it was in anger. "What the hell are you doing?"
The door opened to reveal Draco Malfoy. He had not changed much in the two years since the Battle of Hogwarts, which was the last time Harry had seen him. True, his face looked a little thinner, more drawn. But Harry knew that was the effect of grief. He himself had grown thinner in the time after the battle, having lost a multitude of great friends that night. It was no surprise that Malfoy would look similarly thin after the passing of both his parents that night as well.
The bus squealed to a stop, and Harry collapsed back onto Malfoy. Their hips rammed together, and his mouth was now only an inch from his. Malfoy flushed pink before roughly shoving him off and jumping to his feet. Before Harry could even stand and grab his backpack, the edge of Malfoy's robes was whipping out of sight through the door of the bus.
When they stepped over the threshold, the archway sealed itself behind them and the banshee opened her mouth. The shriek that came from her was magnified by the chamber's stone walls.
Thank you guys for waiting so patiently for this chapter. It was a bit tricky to write, which was partially why it took a bit longer than the others. But, I like how it turned out, and I hope you guys find it worth the wait!
"You have to calm down," Harry said, and he absently flexed the muscle in his forearm. It was tight with the burning sensation. "You can make it through this."
Draco's mind was a mix of emotions both during his shower and long after Potter had gotten dressed back in the main room. They were now sitting together on the floor, both of them brewing potions in their travel cauldrons to prepare for the coming journey to Slytherin's tomb.
They sat in silence for several long minutes, and Draco only stopped turning all the information over in his mind when the roar of approaching motorcycles reached their ears. Looking over to the far wall, Draco saw the other bikers from town drive straight through the solid stone wall as if it were made of water. They parked their bikes and climbed off them, looking in Draco's and Potter's direction and talking excitedly.
They fell back into silence, and Harry was somehow both content and bored as he simply listened to Malfoy shower. It was only the sound of rushing water and the opening and closing of bottles of body wash and shampoo, but it was relaxing.
"That's all perfectly normal," Harry said, frowning in thought as he realized just how lonely Malfoy must secretly feel. It reminded him of when he had lived with the Dursleys before he had ever known about Hogwarts. "I lost a lot of wonderful friends that night too. But...you can't cut yourself off from ever feeling a real connection with anyone ever again. Ron and Hermione were how I got through some of the darkest periods of my life."
Draco turned around from where he had been watching the barista make a smoothie and found Potter standing in front of him. "Oh, uh, yeah, I said I wasn't hungry."
"I would want to suck every last drop from you," Potter said, and now Draco could hear a husky breathiness to the man's tone. Was he becoming aroused too? Was Potter, right then and there, nursing an erection for him? "Then, I would bend you over, spread you wide..."
Draco shivered and swallowed, preparing his response while the rest of his body immediately went cold. This was a trick. A terrible trick from the prophecy. Potter did not really have feelings for him. He just couldn't. And it was cruel. Because Draco both did and didn't want Potter's feelings to be real. If Potter's feelings were real, that meant they had a chance...a chance for love...and for heartbreak. There could not be love without risk of pain, and Draco didn't want any more pain for the rest of his life if he could help it.
Harry had not replied to this letter either, but he also didn't burn it. By now, he was well aware that his doing so was what triggered the mark. He didn't understand it. It made no sense. But, he had a vague idea that if Malfoy had the same mark and the animals were fighting more due to Harry's avoidance of him, somehow they were connected. Somehow, Harry was the Gryffindor lion, and Malfoy was the Slytherin serpent. And he did not like the implications of what that might mean.
Potter glanced at Draco questioningly before shrugging. "We haven't planned that far ahead. Right now, I think the goal is to get a hotel room and rest."
"When Slytherin cut ties with Hogwarts and the other founders, he came to Egypt to study the more pure magic of the Egyptians. The pharaohs were often a line of pureblood wizards who also valued pureblood as blood of the gods or whatever, so Slytherin came here to work with them. Hufflepuff never agreed with Slytherin on blood status, but she was the most forgiving out of the four, just wanting peace between her friends again and hoping Gryffindor and Slytherin could mend their relationship, so she sought out Slytherin to try to bring him back to the school. It didn't work, but Slytherin and Hufflepuff became friends again. They kept in contact over the years until Slytherin requested she return to Egypt when he was on his deathbed. He told her of a great black pyramid he had built and hidden in the desert. Only a certain priest knew how to access it, and had made an Unbreakable Vow with him to kill himself inside the pyramid after he had performed Slytherin's burial rights so he could never speak of it. So, even Huffepluff didn't know where this pyramid was or how to access it. But, she did swear to Slytherin that she and her own prodigies would protect it for generations from those seeking to find his great tomb and rob it." She leaned back a bit and shrugged. "That's how the story goes at least, passed down through the generations of our group."
Susan ended up Apparating them back to their original hotel and gave them each another hug before she left.
"I thought for sure that bloke with the 'flying carpets' would be a good lead," Harry said before plucking the topmost square of lamb from the skewer with his teeth.
In his half-asleep state, Harry had thought Malfoy was referring to the Dark Mark, which clearly meant he was out of his mind to suggest Harry had one. He had gone back to bed, and in the morning, he reread the letter to realize exactly what Malfoy meant. So what if Malfoy had the same mark as him? Harry wanted nothing to do with strange marks or Malfoy.
Apprehensive and highly annoyed that Susan seemed to know a lot more about their life-threatening quest than they did, Draco growled as he took her hand. As soon as Potter grabbed her other hand, they turned on the spot and disappeared with a soft 'pop'.
And hadn't Harry expressly told himself that he would not act on these stirring feelings? Of course, that was rapidly changing. Every moment that he spent with Malfoy just further proved that the man had changed for the better since their school days. And then Susan had revealed that information about Malfoy's generous anonymous donations to people that Harry thought Malfoy would have sooner agreed to hug a manticore than even shake their hands. He was stunned by these actions, and this revelation of them had only made Malfoy more attractive in his eyes.
Draco looked from the dagger to the statue, thinking it was just too simple that the dagger would fit neatly into the hole in the statue's chest. He glanced back at Potter, though he was careful to keep the statue in his peripheral vision. "This thing is going to come to life when I touch this dagger, isn't it? Don't smirk. I don't like this. It seems too easy."
Potter wrapped his arms around Draco's waist and rested his chin on his shoulder. "You want me to do it for you?" he purred in his ear. He stroked his fingertips over Draco's lower abdomen.
He and Potter exchanged a wary glance, and then Potter laid his right arm on the table, outstretched toward her.
Harry laughed at this, but he quickly stopped when he saw Malfoy's expression darken. He shook his head. "I meant every word and action in that room."
"We should be able to get all our errands done by nightfall," Malfoy said as they took two seats at the back of the Knight Bus. He had summoned it there with his wand hand and a loud bang as soon as he had seen Harry headed down the main street in Hogsmeade.
"I think that you need to understand something about prophecies," Potter said, and his expression darkened slightly. "Something you probably didn't pick up from reading a book on prophecies by some witch or wizard who's never been the subject of one. Something Dumbledore told me when I first heard the prophecy about me and Voldemort." He exhaled and held his gaze. "We have full choice over how this plays out."
But four more essays later, when the clock on the wall chimed midnight, there was a knock on his office door.
They decided to stay put now that Slytherin had communicated with them. There seemed to be no point to keep walking when they had their instructions. Despite this, Draco kept brushing off Potter's efforts to talk about Slytherin's words. Instead, he took out all his notes on the founder to review them yet again. He knew they wouldn't help as they didn't hold any clues to what challenges awaited in the pyramid. But, Potter left him alone while he was reading the documents, so he read them. And then reread them. And again. He only stopped when the sun set outside the tent and cast a green light over the expanse of desert. Once again, Draco heard the Parselmouth's whispered command.
Draco looked to where Potter was pointing at the statue in the center of the room. For a moment, he wasn't sure what he was looking at either. There was something shimmery floating in front of the statue. Warily, and keeping his eyes open for any signs of sudden movements in the shadows, he walked toward the statue.
Malfoy closed his eyes tightly again and breathed out hard through his nose. "I don't like small spaces," he ground out finally after a few more breaths.
"We used to. Do you honestly think this is still hate? I think we've been pretty civil, almost friends, during this whole prophecy thing."
"N-nothing. Go away, Potter." He was struggling against his tears again, which felt physically painful to withhold. His throat was burning from the effort, and talking only made it worse.
The plane jerked from turbulence, and Malfoy, already knocked out from the potion, slumped forward. Harry instinctively reached an arm out to grab him before his face could slam into the seat in front of him.
At the same time, Harry felt as though he had changed dramatically in the last two years since the war ended. Maybe Malfoy had too. At the very least, maybe they could come out of this as friends.
Harry swallowed and took a few steps back from Malfoy and the dais. He turned so his back was to the other man. "Tell me when you want me to start."
"Quit refusing!" Malfoy snapped, holding his injured arm to his chest. "If I die because you're too stubborn to do this, Gryffindor and Slytherin won't be the only ones warring for eternity from their tombs."
They both stopped just outside the tent. A gigantic brilliant green and black pyramid was now standing a mere thirty feet from their tent and blocking out the rising sun.
Malfoy shrugged. "About time to be getting up anyway. Dawn just broke." He paused and glanced away. "Along with Slytherin's voice again. Same message as last night."
He set the pensieve in the middle of the desk and picked up the vial. His heart was hammering. He didn't want to hear what the prophecy said, even though he knew from their matching marks that he was already tied tightly into the prophecy regardless of how much he resisted. But, in his experience, prophecies meant danger and running around the country trying to find horcruxes and almost dying more times than he could count. As he tipped Narcissa's memory into the pensieve, his own memory flared with warning as a flash of Trelawney's prophecy rung in his head from that day five years ago in Dumbledore's office.
After making sure he had everything he thought he needed, he locked the door and left the castle. His stomach was churning with a strange mixture of dread and excitement as he walked back into Hogsmeade. He hadn't thought himself capable of the latter emotion in this situation considering how he had reacted to the news of the prophecy the previous night. But, he had spent much of his adolescence always working toward a goal of some type: protecting the Stone, stopping the Heir of Slytherin, conquering Dementors, completing the Triwizard Tournament tasks, leading the DA, hunting horcruxes, defeating Voldemort. There had always been something for him to do, another step laid out for him to take. And when the war had ended, yes, he had had the tasks of talking to reporters, supporting his friends in the recovery, and learning how to be a professor. But now, two short years later, everything felt like routine, and if he was being honest, a bit purposeless. Without Voldemort and Death Eaters to fight, everything seemed mundane. Not that he was complaining! But...this new prophecy...a clear path laid out. It would be a lie to say it didn't feel good to have a purpose again. And yes, he realized he could die during this journey too. But, surely, it was not possible for this path to be any more dangerous than the one that had led to horcruxes and a final battle with Voldemort, could it?
A stray thought crossed Harry's mind as his body finally gave way to sleep. Malfoy had blushed a lot that day, turning from pale white to a dusty or even bright pink when Harry had been close to him on two occasions. Did Malfoy have real feelings for him?
Draco narrowed his eyes. "Yeah, and how exactly do you know about it? Who is this group you're with?"
It took a solid ten minutes of Malfoy pacing, mumbling, and running his hands through his hair for Harry to get the answer out of him. And when he did finally confess what the serpent had instructed him to do, his face was the reddest Harry had ever seen it. He was sure a Gryffindor banner would have paled in comparison.
Cold swept through Harry as he jumped to his feet and drew his wand. His hip rammed into the desk in his haste to stand up, and the stack of ungraded essays fell to the floor with a thud and a hiss as sheets of parchment spread out over the stone floor.
"How did Voldemort know about the tomb?" Potter asked. "It seems only Slytherin, Hufflepuff, and this priest knew about it."
Any reply Draco might have given died in his throat as Potter chose then to run a single fingertip along the vein on the underside of his cock. It was just one stroke before Potter returned to the regular rhythm, but Draco felt like he was vibrating.
"And you." Draco was startled out of his thoughts by Susan addressing him suddenly. "I know what you did after the war. Donating all that money to help families recover from the war."
Phineas spluttered, "I am saying no such thing! We must think though of Gryffindor. Brave and noble, maybe, but also arrogant and boastful, wasn't he? He would not have kept his love a secret."
The figure of Thoth stepped down from its short dais and stalked toward him. The beak of the ibis snapped - either in warning or challenge, Draco wasn't sure.
"I know that," Malfoy snapped. "I just..." He swallowed thickly. "Do you have any potions that might help?"
"Good," Potter murmured in his ear, though his heart was beating so loudly just then that he wasn't sure if Potter might have yelled it.
Harry reached out to squeeze his hand, but Malfoy jerked out of his grasp and pinned him with a glare. Harry held up his hands in surrender. "Right. I'm sorry. We'll talk about stuff afterwards."
Harry opened his eyes to find himself staring at the plastic blue-patterned shower curtain. The chain leading from his cuff to Malfoy's disappeared around the edge of the curtain, keeping it open a few inches. He sat on the closed lid of the toilet just as the water was turned on in the shower.
He did, however, pack much more than he would have for a simple trip abroad. Soon after the war had ended, he had asked Hermione to make him a backpack with the same hidden storage capabilities that she had bestowed upon her beaded bag. Now was the perfect time to put it to use. He packed his Firebolt, his broomstick servicing kit, the invisibility cloak, the sword of Gryffindor, a small travel cauldron, vials of ingredients to make basic healing and calming potions, and a book about the basics of Ancient Runes from Hermione that he had never read but assumed he would need if he was to search for an ancient tomb. He used a spare change of robes to cradle the potion vials, making sure they wouldn't shatter during the journey. He also packed some Muggle clothes, but he would need more when they went shopping that night. Most of his were for cold weather and were, therefore, definitely not suitable for Egypt during the day. But the jumpers and jeans would come in handy for the cold desert nights. He hoped they would not have to endure many, but he knew from experience it was best to be over-prepared.
Potter laughed. "You look about as relieved as I feel. Just kind of too tired to express it. And starved." He looked sideways to Draco. "Did we eat today at all?"
"Please, be careful out there, you two," Susan said, turning to them as soon as she had Apparated them to stand in the shadow of the Sphinx. Her eyes were full of worry. "I know you can do this."
"I just need a leave of absence," Harry cut in. He had known she would not receive his news well, but he had seen no other way to fulfill the prophecy. He couldn't juggle classes, curriculum planning, grading, and hunting who knew where for lost tombs all at the same time. Even devoting week days to Hogwarts and weekends to tomb hunting would stretch him too thin and keep him running back and forth. It was one or the other, and considering the latter would kill him if he put it off or refused, well...there was no option.
"Most everything I did between the ages of eleven and eighteen seemed impossible," Potter said, which Draco thought was completely unhelpful because he knew outside forces had intervened many times to save the Chosen One from expulsion or death.
Malfoy rubbed his freshly healed forearm as he looked around the still chamber. "Yeah, well, thanks."
"No, you're going to be fine," Harry said softly and slowly. Yet he was thinking quickly, wanting to diffuse Malfoy's stress and his own pain as soon as possible. And, despite his own pain, being a calm anchor while the other person was panicking was essential, he thought.
Draco rolled his eyes. "So, you didn't decide it was worth making up with Gryffindor until he was on his death bed?"
Harry felt a twinge of guilt with what he had said back at the cafe. He had acted like his actions on the previous plane had simply been the product of his desire to stop his own pain. And, though Harry tried now to convince himself that that was the truth, he knew it wasn't. When he had seen Malfoy's panic attack, he had started to worry for the man again. And in that moment when their hands came together for the first time, he had felt something else stir inside him, something he couldn't easily write off as nothing. He wasn't sure exactly what it was. Protectiveness? Vulnerability? Desire? Maybe all three. Whatever it was, he had felt it before. That same something had built in him all of sixth year when he had been falling for Ginny.
Draco lowered his hand from his mouth and used all his control to help stop his voice from breaking. "I'm fine," he said, though he sounded anything but fine. "I'll be out in a bit. Just go back to what you were doing."
"Bellatrix and Rudolphus didn't have any children. I inherited everything from them when they died in the battle. I just hadn't gotten around to going through their vault until recently." Malfoy gave Harry a hard look, his eyes narrowed in annoyance. "I haven't felt like going through the mess you left."
"No, Muggles use them all the time. We can find something different." Seeing that Potter was about to argue with him, he quickly said, "Let's just find out where the first tomb is."
Potter led them to the bed he had used the previous night and grabbed the two pillows and the comforter there. Then he moved to the other side of the room and tossed the pillows and blanket on the floor next to Draco's bed.
Malfoy released him and sat up straighter, and now Harry could see the mark on the inside of the man's arm. The Gryffindor lion was burning bright red just like the serpent had on the plane.
Draco sucked in a breath and closed his eyes in bliss as Potter fondled him. Potter struck up a rhythm that quickly had Draco breathless. With each pass of his hand, he ran his thumb over Draco's slit, and Draco was sure Potter was actually going to pull his soul from his body whenever he did orgasm.
"Ah, I am interested in what the third test was for you," Akil said. "No pair has ever made it that far, and it is the only test that changes based on the Slytherin prodigy."
Malfoy whipped around to face him, his expression tight even as his eyes were wide with fear. "What?" he hissed between labored breaths.
Susan immediately agreed and after a brief discussion about where they wanted to eat, she Apparated all three of them plus the bike to a side street in Cairo. They walked only a block to reach the restaurant Susan had suggested. At that point, Draco was just grateful for food regardless of what it was.
"Malfoy-" Harry began, looking over to his companion to see how he was reacting to this new pain and state of their mark. But, Malfoy didn't seem to be examining his mark or aware of the predicament at all. Rather, he was crying. Or...no. He wasn't crying, but his breathing was coming so fast and hard that it was plain to Harry why he had mistaken it for sobbing.
Making the decision, he carried the cauldron, ingredients, and carefully concealed Sleeping Draught vial to his nightstand. He set up the hot chocolate to brew and set the potion vial behind the cauldron where Potter wouldn't be able to see it.
Draco scrubbed a hand over his face and turned away from them, moving instead to pick out clothes for the day. Potter hadn't even given him time to change out of his pajamas before letting Susan into the room.
Malfoy came to a sudden halt on the street corner, and Harry rammed into him. He caught the blond around the waist before he fell from the force of the collision.
Draco yawned for the third time since Susan had knocked on their door and Potter had practically dragged him out of bed. As much as he wanted to be freed from Potter, did it have to be dawn when it happened? He had been exhausted after staying up and brewing those potions, and Potter had the nerve to wake him up when the sky was still pink with the flush of the slowly emerging sun.
Whatever Harry had expected to be inside, it was not a half-clothed, walking and cursing skeleton that was trying to shift a silver cauldron out of its path only to have both its arms fall off at the elbow and clatter to pieces across the floor. "Fucking Ra," it grumbled, its jawbone clacking as it spoke.
After the battle, he had disappeared. He had lost his parents, his godparents, an admired teacher and mentor, and several close friends all in one night. He felt like he could not bear any more hurt, and he had sworn from that moment on to never allow anyone to become close to him again. Having attachments was just a set up for heartbreak.
Draco gripped the scepter like a lifeline, anger and embarrassment pulsing through him as he watched the smoke rise from the platform, now free. How dare that stupid priest suggest he wanted Potter and was denying himself the man so badly that the tomb had turned it into a personal challenge for him. He liked Potter, but the priest had just made it sound like it was his greatest and darkest desire, and he didn't think it was. Was it?
"You mean our chances of survival depend on a stone triangle deciding it wants to be seen?!" Draco hissed.
Susan shrugged, looking troubled. "We can't say for sure. There's very little documentation downstairs because the prodigies would arrive, learn what they needed from us, and head off into the desert. Sometimes, we'd find their bodies weeks later, somehow already reduced to skeletons. Other times, there was nothing to find. Probably some died from dehydration or hunger, and others probably made it to the tomb but couldn't get past the tests. Either way, yes, I think it was because they just couldn't work together how they were supposed to. That's not even to say how many pairs didn't even make it to Egypt."
"The first two tests are the same for everyone, but the third test is self-aware. That chamber adjusts itself to test the prodigy by offering something the prodigy wants but adamantly denies himself or herself out of pride, fear, or another emotion."
Harry turned to glare at him. The other portraits of past Heads were murmuring to each other, except a few. Snape's was glaring sideways at Phineas, and Dumbledore's was nearly in a fit of giggles. "What?" he asked, not even sure himself whether he was addressing Snape or Dumbledore.
"You don't have a point! This prophecy is trying to mend the past and the future. Don't you think it a little odd that you suddenly have feelings for me now that we're tied up in a prophecy about love between Gryffindor and Slytherin? We heal the rift between them to fix the past, and then the prophecy forces us to fall in love to bring the houses together for the future. Don't you get that?"
It was obvious to him that the mark must refer to Gryffindor and Slytherin, but he had no clue beyond that of its significance. Godric Gryffindor and Salazar Slytherin, two of the Hogwarts founders, were known to have grown apart and become rivals after a series of disagreements on the running of the school. So, that must be why the lion and serpent were pictured fighting. But, why show up as a tattoo-like mark? Why on Harry? Why, period?
Knowing the only way to find out and get his anxiety to lessen from sheer anticipation, Draco walked through the doorway, closely followed by Potter. They found themselves in a chamber lit with more green fire braziers along the walls. As soon as they were both inside, the archway behind them turned to solid black stone. From what Draco could see, there also wasn't any door leading out of the chamber.
Harry grinned and gave a soft laugh. "Yeah, maybe he will. But, I can die with the memory of you wanking off in a tomb."
"The cuffs are invisible to Muggles, so you won't draw attention going around town. And don't bother trying to remove them yourselves. Only I can take them off."
But Potter's footsteps did not retreat out the flap of the tent to make the fire. Rather, they drew closer, and a prickling sensation ran down Draco's spine. Before he could turn over or say something to stop the other man from doing whatever it was he thought he was going to do, the covers were pulled away, exposing his back to the chilly morning air. It was short-lived though as Potter slid into the bed and tucked the covers back around them both.
Susan took a deep breath and sighed, her shoulders slumping. "I'll explain everything. Just hang on." She turned away, glanced up and down the street, and then took out her wand and muttered a spell. Her motorcycle shrank to the size of a toy model, and she bent to pick it up and pocketed it. She straightened up, stowed her wand out of sight, and held out her hands for each of them. "I'll Apparate you to headquarters. I know you can't right now, but I can take you."
They were both silent, hands over their ears, and watched as the Anubis figure looked slowly from side to side. He scanned the room and then approached the banshee. With one strike of the flail, the banshee exploded into a blast of wind. Then she was gone, and the statue slunk back to its alcove, which turned back to solid stone, leaving the chamber empty.
Draco nodded, and he knew that somehow they were completely in sync about what had to happen next. He took another few steps back, drawing out more distance between him and the statue as Potter moved to stand in its path. When the statue was a mere foot from Potter and its eyes were still wholly focused on Draco, the blond tossed the dagger up into the air. It arched downward, Potter caught it, and before the statue could shift its attention to the new wielder, he had rammed it into the slot in its chest.
Draco shook his head, and she looked momentarily crestfallen until he said, "I don't think I can handle that many people right now. It's been a long day. But we can get dinner, just the three of us. I'm sure they'll still love to hear the story from you later."
"The Chamber of Secrets was meant to be hidden so well that the other founders wouldn't be able to locate it," Draco pointed out. "But Slytherin had a flair for the dramatic and flashy. If there was ever a place to splurge on something, it was his tomb. It'll be hidden, sure, but it'll be obvious it's his. Maybe it's invisible. I can't imagine he
"Oh my dear Merlin!" Susan nearly screeched as she jumped off her bike and tossed her helmet aside. She sprang at Potter and gave him a tight hug before, to Draco's surprise, doing the same to him. She pulled back, grinning broadly. "I've been watching the horizon off and on since you left. You guys did it! And in hardly any time at all, too."
Again, Potter nodded, though it was solemn as if Draco had just revealed a great burden to him. "So, I guess we're headed to Egypt and looking for some really old stuff with snakes on it."
"Regardless of how you feel about the task," Harry said after forcibly pulling his thoughts away from imagining what Malfoy's moans and soft sighs of pleasure would sound like. "You're going to have to do it. There's not a way out of it."
Malfoy's hand tightened on the vial, and for a moment, Harry was sure he might break it. But then the blond thrust the bottle into his hand. Upon examining it, Harry saw it had a label with Narcissa's name and a date that would have put Harry around three years old.
"Well, compared to the other tasks, I'm counting this one as just a smidgen easier," Harry said, barely refraining from rolling his eyes. "There's no immediate threat of getting bludgeoned to death at least."
"You said to meet tomorrow," Harry said, very slowly lowering his wand to his side as the blond stepped into the office and shut the door.
Draco felt an insane prick of jealousy at this revelation, and he immediately scolded himself silently for it. He had no reason to be jealous, especially not of a dead boy. He swallowed. "Well...fine. So, you're bi. That doesn't mean your feelings for me are real. It's absurd. We hate each other."
Both men suddenly grinned at that statement, sharing in the amusement since Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs were absolutely full of snakes and it would not be nearly as easy to locate the tomb as Potter had insinuated. But their shared moment was gone just as quickly as it had come as both adverted their eyes.
"W-what are you d-doing?" Draco said between shaky sobs. But even though his tone sounded a bit combative, he didn't fight Potter. Instead, he curled his fingers into the fabric of the man's t-shirt, clinging to it tightly.
He knew he was running out of options. He had no choice but to meet Malfoy the following day, but he'd be damned if he went willingly. And in some sort of weird rebellion, he didn't wish to give in to the sleep that was hounding him. Sleeping would mean surrendering to the next day where he would meet Malfoy. If he stayed up and did distracting work, like grading, it would slow the progress of the night.
Draco took the vial back and pressed the cork into place. He gave it a few tips back and forth and a swirl for good measure. He set it aside and began to gather all the documents into a stack.
He was lying in bed, his dinner twisting unpleasantly in his stomach as he stared up at the canopy of the tent. On the other side of the tent, he imagined that Malfoy was feigning sleep as well. He couldn't see the blond through the darkness, but his side of tent had gone unnaturally still and silent. No rustling or steady breathing that told of deep sleep. They were likely doing the same thing: each lying awake, dreading what Slytherin's words meant.
Potter uncorked the tiny bottle and picked up the knife. Staring at his hand as he made a small but deep incision, he said, "That's why you didn't flinch when you cut yourself last night."
Stupid Potter. And stupid bus for not using a Sticking Charm to adhere their seats to the floor. How hard was it to do that to make sure the passengers weren't thrown around like sacks of dragon dung?
Then movement caught his eye, and he nudged Malfoy and nodded in the direction of the wall adjacent to them. Another archway had opened, but instead of presenting a way out for them, it was letting something in.
He gave his bun another stab. He hadn't eaten any of it yet. It was only sitting there in front of him because Potter had made him order it to get food in his system.
Eventually though, sometime around one in the morning, Potter sighed after corking the last potion vial. "I'll take the floor."
"I don't hate Andromeda or the Weasleys," Draco said waspishly. "If you had a father like mine, you would have hated anyone he told you to hate. I even came to believe that I hated them myself for my own reasons. It wasn't until sixth year that I started to see how I really felt. I didn't want to kill anyone. I started to see through the lies. And then I saw our classmates and teachers at the battle, completely ready to do what I could never do - lay down their lives for a cause they believed in. And I could never do that because I didn't know what I believed. Potter, I've done a lot of thinking these past two years. I still don't like Muggles or the Weasleys and I've never even met my aunt. But, no, I don't hate them."
Malfoy was still breathing erratically, his eyes shut again and a sheen of sweat shone on his forehead. "I have to get off this plane," he said. "I can't breathe."
Draco sighed and picked up his messenger bag and his own hawawshi from the take-away bag they had gotten from the restaurant next door to the hotel. He sat across from Potter on the floor and took out the world map and the vial of blood. He handed both to Potter before unwrapping the foil on his food. He began eating the spicy dish. He probably should have gotten his without the chilis.
Harry nodded, fighting to keep his expression blank for both of their sakes. Talking dirty to Malfoy while he touched himself was extremely enticing. It would give him an excuse to let his own mind wander and imagine what he would like to do to the blond if given the chance. Granted, it would also be torture. He might succeed in turning Malfoy on for the task, but he was definitely going to arouse himself and not being able to do anything about it or touch Malfoy would be excruciating.
Susan was still smiling, but as she looked between them, the grin faded from her face. "You two hate each other. There's only one reason you'd both be here together." Her gaze shot to Potter's arm, and she snatched it, pulling it close to examine the prophecy's mark on his inner forearm. She sighed and dropped his arm. Turning to her companion who was watching with his eyebrows raised, she said, "We should get them to headquarters."
Hurriedly, Harry stood and pulled up his pants, his attention focused solely on the doorway in case anything came running down the stairs at them. Malfoy was soon at his shoulder, a bit pink-faced and still out of breath as he fastened his trousers.
He tugged a hand through his hair and blew out a breath. This was not how this was supposed to be going. Barely one day into their journey and he could feel himself growing weak under a mere glance from Potter. And Potter didn't even know it! If he did, he would surely have heard about it by now.
Draco's hands curled into fists, his face on fire now. He wasn't sure if it was anger or embarrassment because he was feeling plenty of both just then, most of it directed at himself for getting caught, not Susan.
His face flushed involuntarily as he thought over Potter's actions of holding his hand during the flight, leading him quietly off the plane once they had landed, and sitting him down at the first food place they saw in the airport. The man had made sure he had food and water before walking off, saying he'd be back in an hour with a potion for Draco to take for the next flight.
Eventually, Harry drifted off to sleep. The sun from their hours of walking had drained him of his energy, so what could have been a sleepless night of agonizing 'what if' wondering was mercifully taken from him.
As the serpent went still, Draco growled. "What, that's it?" He turned to Potter, who he knew was waiting for the translation. "Magic won't work on whatever is beyond this doorway. Something about a tool being provided and an attention undivided."
Instantly, Harry felt like someone had just taken a beater's bat to his elbow and shattered all the bones there. He gasped, and so did Malfoy, both of them clutching at their arms.
Potter laughed and climbed back out of the shower. Draco heard his shoes squelching with every step back into the main room.
"Yes, I gathered that much," Harry said, his voice tight and waspish. He had just stated they would die himself. He didn't need it repeated. "Ok, let's say that we did this, go looking for their final resting places. I thought Gryffindor was buried in Godric's Hollow."
It didn't take them long to get out the map and vial of their mixed blood and pour a few drops onto the parchment. Their blood did not move as far south as Brazil, but instead colored in the lower portion of Mexico, stretching from where it touched the Pacific Ocean just above Guatemala, along that shared border, and ending at the tip of the Yucatan Peninsula where it jutted into the Gulf of Mexico. The whole colored in area was about the size of Draco's thumb.
Once they had boarded the plane and it was turning onto the runway for takeoff, Harry handed Malfoy the small vial of Sleeping Draught he had brewed in a janitorial closet at the airport. "Remember, just take a little for now."
The statue was completely unfazed. It didn't turn or look in Potter's direction at all. It's hollow eyes never left Draco's face. Even when Potter jumped in front of it again to slash at its head, it didn't acknowledge him.
He watched as Potter poured a few drops of their blood onto the map. The blood behaved just as if had the last time they had used it, sliding across the parchment and then sinking into the map. Again, the whole country of Egypt was soaked crimson. No words were added next to Slytherin's name, no indication of city or landmark to go to.
I have increased the rating to M for suggestive content. Things will likely become explicit in later chapters.
His initial impression was that the room was empty except for a single statue. This didn't ease his nerves at all. Where was this enemy going to come from? Was it hiding?
Malfoy was nibbling on a mushroom from his own kebab. "Honestly, me too." He sighed as they walked down the street, still headed deeper into the heart of Cairo.
"Seems like it. That's the past the prophecy is referring to. Best I can figure is the future refers to getting the current houses here to work together. But the past portion would come first seeing as if its not done now that the prophecy is activated or whatever you want to call it, Gryffindor's and Slytherin's ghosts would seek some sort of revenge."
Potter knelt behind him almost immediately, and Draco wondered if he had been gradually moving closer to him as he talked. But this anxious thought was driven from his mind as Potter pressed his torso against his back. A thick, very hard and very large erection pressed into the base of Draco's spine. From what he could tell, it seemed Potter had taken off his pants but graciously left his underwear on. Draco was aroused, but he wasn't sure he wanted to have penetrative sex with Potter. Not...well, not yet, anyway.
"Ok, so..." She began, sitting down across from them again. "I think, and they agree with me, that we can't let you guys just head out."
Malfoy gave a sigh of relief even as he frowned at Harry. "Good choice, Potter." He straightened and clenched and unclenched his hand as if to work the tension from the muscle of his forearm. "We need to make a plan. Do this as fast as possible to get out of each other's hair."
Malfoy stopped moving from where he had been trying to shake Harry's firm but not hurtful hold from his arm. He stared at him as if unsure he had really just heard words of encouragement come from the other man. "You don't know-"
No book or fellow teacher he consulted over the next few days had been of any help. After the initial burst of pain, the mark had lain dormant, a simple black outline of two animals grappling with each other. Perhaps, the design was what both troubled and intrigued him more than the mark's sudden appearance. The image was that of a serpent and a lion in battle with each other. The lion's mouth was open, its paw frozen in a downward swing to strike the serpent that had wrapped its tail around the lion's ankle.
"I think he'll find this a little more important than lunch," the man called Derek said, crossing his arms over his chest.
But, Harry of all people should have realized that magical marks could not be ignored, and neither would Malfoy be ignored. After burning the letter, more pain had erupted in his arm. Upon inspection, the lion's paw had moved and was now scraping the serpent's face with its claws. And when Malfoy sent another letter every day, becoming more and more persistent about their meeting, and Harry burned them too, the mark and the pain got worse.
"Well done," Slytherin said, but though what he said should have been praise, he sounded almost bored. "I trust your journey was satisfactory."
"What?" Draco repeated, his voice higher this time. "That's insane. We're adults and can make our own decisions about when we're ready."
"Most likely," Harry said. He looked up the dim staircase. "Might as well face it. It probably won't hurt us." He started up the stairs with Malfoy just a few steps behind him and distinctly heard the man mutter something about how he 'didn't like conducting his life based on probably's.'
"I thought about how smooth and soft that skin there would be, about how sweet your cum would taste." Potter's voice had suddenly grown more confident as he talked.
Harry stepped aside so Malfoy could ascend the last stair and speak in Parseltongue to the serpent. Instead of speaking back to him, it simply bowed its head in respect, and the door swung open.
Draco had already come to that conclusion. He knew he would have to think like Slytherin to make it through this pyramid of puzzles, but he hadn't expected to be asked to not use magic. What kind of tool would be provided?
But barely a minute had passed when a distinct pain erupted in Harry's forearm, and he inhaled sharply. It was directly where the prophecy's mark was located and was burning fiercely. It was not like the stabbing pain he had experienced when he had refused to answer Malfoy's letters. Rather, this one was burning as if someone was pressing a white hot brand to his skin.
"That's great, and - oh!" She slid a long thin package off her back and and handed it to Potter. "I forgot. We have a couple tents at headquarters that we don't use too often. You can take this one. Don't worry, there's plenty of room for both of you. It's magically expanded inside and is enchanted to keep out sand and scorpions and the like."
Harry swallowed thickly and forced himself to pull the curtain back shut, effectively making Malfoy disappear from sight. His pants were suddenly tight with a growing erection, which made him silently curse himself. That wasn't how he had wanted to see Malfoy naked, not when the man didn't know and clearly didn't want it either. He wanted it to be consensual, and he wanted to be naked with him.
Potter actually had the nerve to roll his eyes and laugh. Somehow, Draco knew Potter wasn't going to forget this revelation in a hurry. But, Potter had turned back to Susan. "So, that's why you believe we'll succeed."
"Why didn't it work?!" Malfoy yelled, his hands over his own ears. He was mere inches from Harry, but the volume of the banshee's wails made it seem like he was on the other side of a Quidditch stadium.
Resolved to get to bed within the next few minutes, he crouched down and began to gather the fallen papers.
Harry smiled, enjoying this picture of a completely relaxed Malfoy asleep in bed with him. He carefully reached up to brush some stray blond hairs away from the man's face. And then, caught by a sudden urge, he tipped his head a bit to plant a single soft kiss to Malfoy's forehead.
Malfoy nodded, but was seemingly distracted by another thought. "But that only takes care of half of it. 'What is seen will perish by the jackal.' There's...maybe it's referencing another Egyptian god like Thoth back there. I think Anubis was the god of death, and he was depicted with a head of a dog or a jackal, I think."
Susan frowned, looking as if she might have spoken in confidence without thinking of reasons to back it up first. But, she didn't take long to answer his question. "Because it was our generation who defeated Voldemort." She looked at Potter. "You beat Voldemort, which many thought to be impossible. You figured out his secrets, followed clues left behind, and destroyed him and his horcruxes."
Susan pressed her palms against the surface of the table and splayed her fingers as she sighed. "I'll explain it all. Let me start from the beginning. This group I'm a part of is called
Draco frowned, but he supposed he couldn't argue with that. Death of loved ones often had a way of making people reflect and realize things they should have done or said while that person was still alive. After all, he had had many moments like that when reflecting on his parents' deaths. "Fine. So, will you make things right with Gryffindor now?"
Draco swallowed again, this time trying to work some saliva back into his mouth so he could talk at a normal tone again. Now that he was coming down from his high, he realized it was time to move. But part of him wasn't ready to leave the intimate moment just yet. "Maybe..." he said and had to swallow again. "We can-"
Draco forgot just how quickly a dose that large would act, and he lunged forward to take the mug from the man's hand before he dropped it. Potter's eyes were rolling back, but before he was dragged into a deep sleep, Draco could have sworn he saw a look of utter betrayal flash across the man's features.
"That's-" Draco started. But his whole mouth and throat felt suddenly too dry to get out the words as Potter nuzzled his neck. Maybe his heart would just burst from his body and kill him so this confusing torture would end. At the same time, he found himself wanting to lean back into his companion.
"I would fuck you," Potter said, and Draco heard him blow out a heavy passion-laced breath. "Just absolutely fuck the hell out of you. And, god...I'd love to tie you up, fit you with a chastity cage, and just ram you full of my cock until you're whimpering with pleasure."
Susan came back a few minutes later, and Draco was glad to see the other bikers headed toward a set of steps leading underground. He didn't want to deal with more people and more overwhelming information just then.
"You're claustrophobic? And you didn't say anything?" Harry exclaimed, though his voice was still low.
"Yes, I'm afraid so. But, we still have some means of magical transport available to us. I took the Knight Bus to get here. It only travels in the UK though, and based on the prophecy talking about desert and jungle, I think we're going pretty far abroad. There's always brooms, but-"
When he made to move out of its reach, he found it suddenly blocking his path. One step to the other direction, and it was there again. For a hunk of stone, it seemed to move much faster than Draco thought was even magically possible somehow.
They brewed late into the night, and Draco wondered if part of the reason for doing so was that they both wanted to avoid the rapidly approaching problem of their sleeping arrangement.
"Yeah, well," Draco said and cast a glance around for anything to focus on besides Potter's face. "I didn't need all that money. Nobody needs that much money. It was just sitting in the vault being useless anyway."
Draco stared now, and from the combined heat and disbelief rising in him, he thought he could have punched the other man just then. "You're remembering this
Harry wanted to say something as Malfoy rummaged in his bag and pulled out a pair of pajamas. But, what would he say? If he apologized like he wanted to, it could lead them on a path of even more awkwardness and annoyance. That wouldn't help change the mark so Susan would free them. So, he kept quiet even though inside he was raging at himself for having upset Malfoy.
In the center of the room was a wide plinth just large enough to hold what Harry could only assume was a coffin. But, it didn't look like any coffin Harry had ever seen. It was made entirely of glass, and it was filled with white smoke. As the smoke swirled and shifted inside, it allowed for glimpses of a tightly bandaged body within.
Ten minutes later, Malfoy walked out of the bathroom in pajamas, his hair still a bit damp. Harry couldn't help but think this freshly-showered and tousled look made the blond look even sexier than usual. As it was, Harry had barely restrained himself from looking over Malfoy's entire body while in the shower with him. But he had known it would have been inappropriate and much unwelcome in that moment.
"I currently can't Apparate," Draco explained, though he did so begrudgingly. The other man would discover it for himself soon enough. "And I don't think you can either."
Draco nodded against his neck, feeling he was about to burst. He only needed a few more passes of Potter's hand and he would be there falling over the edge into bliss.
He knew it had been brought on by the accident on the bus. Or maybe it had started with the scars on Malfoy's wrist. He wasn't sure, but either way, it was infuriating. He found himself
His mind was churning too fast now and it was adding more blurred and anxious thoughts every minute. It was as if someone had set up a whirlpool in his head and decided to chuck wet-start fireworks, dragon dung, and a Howler in it. The most negative things he thought about himself, attachments, and recent events of the past few days swirled around in a fast, loud spiral that seemed to drag him deeper and deeper into despair that he couldn't entirely explain.
He laid his head back against the headrest of his seat as the plane picked up speed. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Malfoy take a gulp of the potion, push the cork back into place, and slide it into the pocket of his jeans.
After a few seconds, Malfoy's grip loosened, and to Harry's amazement, instead of pulling away, the man slid his hand down to Harry's wrist. He slipped his fingers inside Harry's loosely closed hand, gently teasing the fist open as if asking permission.
Our job is to control magical crime in Cairo because the Egyptian Ministry of Magic doesn't have the best auror program. And frankly, our group has been here much longer than any Ministry of Magic has."
At the same time, he didn't see why asking that question was even needed right then. The snake had given the instructions, and it wouldn't change them. It was best to just do as told. The sooner the third task was completed, the sooner they could leave the pyramid.
The bus wasn't very busy that day, and Harry hoped this would mean they would get to London soon. His experience with riding the Knight Bus had not been the most pleasant. He didn't wish for his stomach to get even more twisted with the jerky movement of the bus. "We still have to figure out how we're getting to Egypt. We should do all our errands today, rest, and set out first thing in the morning. A plane would really be best."
Draco gasped, imagining that. He almost had the urge to bend over himself to help the image have a firmer, more vivid grip. Part of him wanted Potter to stop, because an urge to speak was clawing at his own lips and he was both fearful and excited about what he might say.
After they had both finished their lunch and as they were discussing where to head next, the roar of several motorbikes and the sight of people scurrying out of the street made both of them look around. Coming up the street toward them were half a dozen motorcycles, all bright canary yellow. Their riders wore matching yellow jackets that Harry thought must be sweltering in the sun.
"So, basically, we need to take a month's worth of food with us," Draco said, "and hope that that's enough time for us to figure out how to draw the pyramid out of hiding."
"Sorry!" Harry said, trying to push himself up. He was on top of the blond, and it was harder than he would have thought to get up when the bus was moving and bumping so ferociously.
The bikes turned a corner, and Harry was worried they might lose them. Hell, where was Malfoy too? He had apparently lost him among the crowd.
But Draco knew there was no arguing it. The chain was simply too short for them both to sleep comfortably like they had intended. So, he moved to let Potter into the bed. Then he instantly snatched one of Potter's pillows and one of his own and stuck them between them.
Harry's ears felt like they may shrivel up, and he couldn't blame them. Even with his hands clasped over his ears, the wailing was already giving him a piercing headache. Could banshees kill with their voice alone? He couldn't remember right then, but he was convinced the answer was yes. If a statue didn't come kill them, maybe the harsh vibrating of his brain against his skull would do it for him.
Draco should have felt relieved at this explanation, but instead he felt disappointed. Why on earth was he disappointed?! Had there been the smallest sliver of him holding out hope that Potter actually liked men and had done all those things out of some type of feelings for him? The idea was ludicrous, of course, but that didn't change what Draco was feeling.
The pain in his arm instantly lessened, and after a moment, it was gone. It was replaced by a gentle warmth, and as Harry watched, the mark changed yet again. The lion and serpent both closed their mouths, successfully hiding their dangerous fangs. The snake uncoiled itself from the lion's limbs, and the lion lowered its striking paw to the ground. Now, there was a sliver of space between them, the two animals staring warily at each other.
Draco slumped back against him and barely refrained from whining when Potter withdrew his hand from his cock. A quick glance back down revealed that Potter's knuckles had been painted in a strip of his cum. Before Draco could think to offer to perform a Scouring Charm, the hand had disappeared out of sight. Then he heard what was unmistakably Potter licking his fingers clean.
Malfoy gave an almost imperceptible nod and let go of Harry's hand. "Yeah. Maybe just turn away and...and just...say stuff that'll...help."
"What do we do?" Malfoy shouted in his ear. "How are we supposed to make it not see us? There's nowhere to hide. I was never good at Disillusionment Charms."
He picked up his wand and quietly sent his stag Patronus bounding through the door of their room. With any luck, Susan would be awoken by the stag's message and come soon to uncuff them.
But Draco didn't have time to reflect on how lucky it was Potter had thought to bring it. The statue pulled away from Potter, seemingly disinterested in the other man.
"Uh, yeah!" Draco said. Panic had gripped his chest at Susan's words to Derek, and it was evident from the look on Potter's face that he was experiencing something similar. "You said the 'next set of prodigies'. We aren't the first ones?"
"So," Harry said as Malfoy paced in front of the archway yet again. "You just have to cum on a dais in there?"
"Maybe they were all in on the secret and kept it all hushed up," Harry said. "Just because you all refuse to believe the affair could have happened doesn't change the fact that there is a prophecy saying it happened and the rift has to be mended."
"Probably," Potter agreed. He took another drink of his own water. "But, I expect it's also a test. I just wish we knew what exactly he wanted us to do to prove ourselves or whatever."
Harry didn't really care that Malfoy took the window seat. What bothered him was that the man looked about as fidgety as when Moody had turned him into a ferret. He knew from overhearing conversations between his aunt and uncle that planes made plenty of people nervous. Some even fainted or vomited. He was praying that Malfoy would not turn out to be one of those people.
As he opened the vial of blood and made to tip it over the map, Potter said, "We could go on a plane."
Dumbledore's grin widened. "I think it positively perfect, Harry. Another prophecy where the power to overcome the darkness is love. Your greatest power once again, Harry. Love."
He knew what he wanted him to say, knew what it might be now that Potter's arm was wrapped around his waist. But, he wouldn't believe it. He wasn't sure he'd believe it if Potter said it a thousand times, because this prophecy was messing with both of their heads. Draco had had feelings for Potter before this all started, but Potter surely was under the influence of this great love prophecy that was trying to make them be together so they could heal the rift between the two founders.
Harry smirked behind Malfoy's back once he had lowered his hands from his waist and the man had turned away. "Why'd you stop?"
A vague answer had come a few nights ago via a large eagle owl that had rapped on his windowpane at two in the morning until he awoke and let it in. Bleary-eyed, he had untied the letter from its leg. It had gone out the window before he could even unroll the scroll of parchment. It had read:
After unzipping the jacket and tossing it onto the pile to be left behind, Draco gathered the items he was buying, slipped back into the mask of icy indifference he had perfected at Hogwarts, and walked out of the changing room.
Potter's hand didn't even miss a beat, and he kissed his neck. "Yes, if. If you want that at a later time, I will look forward to drawing new sounds from you."
The snakes' mouths closed and they went still as stone again. Then the doors groaned slowly open as if pushed by an invisible hand. The tunnel beyond turned to blackness just a few steps inside.
Instead of following this simple request to be left alone, Potter stepped forward and batted his hands away from the zipper. "Look, it's not that hard." He easily fitted the two halves of the zipper together and slid the pull up to the top fluidly. "There." He smiled, staring straight into his eyes while his hand lingered a second too long on the zipper.
"Not every attachment ends that way though," Harry said, exasperated. "You're building up all this fear around something that could be great if you let it." He continued in a rush when Malfoy opened his mouth to argue back. "You think I'm not scared?! That I'm not terrified that if I open up to you that you might just walk away and hurt me? Because, guess what, I have the same fears as you. But, I balance those out by reminding myself that to the same degree I can feel pain, I can also feel happiness. And life is full of both pain and happiness no matter how hard you try to avoid the former. Without the pain or risk of pain, at least, you can't truly appreciate the moments of happiness. So...I'm willing to risk it. I'm willing to risk opening up, maybe even giving you my heart, and having you shatter it."
Draco shook his head. "I don't want to talk about this right now. We have an enchanted pyramid to survive and a pretty irate spirit to free and talk to or whatever. Let's just get this done so we can get out of this desert."
"I drift through the other realm while the tomb is unoccupied and wake in this form whenever there are prodigies attempting the tests." The skeleton adjusted the white linen wrap around his waist as he stood again.
"And if that doesn't work," Draco continued, "we'll just have to go around to the known tombs and see if we can find any clues that we can connect to Slytherin. See if there's anything that could have inspired him."
Harry maneuvered Malfoy off of him gently so as not to wake him. Once the man was safely lying beside him in a position that Malfoy would be fine waking up in, Harry looked at the ceiling and blew out a slow breath. How much longer would they be tethered together? Less than a day had passed since Susan cuffed them, and Harry was already feeling much more for the man than he would have ever thought possible. If he had to endure another day of such close proximity, he wasn't sure he would be able to keep his mouth shut or his hands to himself.
Susan slammed her hand down on the table, causing both Draco and Potter to jump. "I am trying to protect you. I don't want to be cleaning up your bones weeks from now." Tears shone in her eyes as she glared at them. "One of you give me your marked arm."
to fulfill this prophecy now that we've heard it either. Granted, our choices are fulfill it or die, but death is still a choice."
"You look like you saw a ghost," Potter said, concern knitting his eyebrows together. Then he seemed to realize the state of the fire and began coaxing it back to life to resume cooking their sausages and potatoes.
"Maybe." Potter slid his hand down to Draco's neck and brushed his thumb over his jaw now. "But Slytherins are about determination and ambition, are they not? That's motivation for bravery too." When Draco turned his head away, he continued, "Is that what got you so upset? Thinking about how scary attachment to me could be?"
"Yeah, that's us just working together so we don't die," Draco argued. "Or have you forgotten that line of the prophecy?"
They got dinner, which was surprisingly easy to eat given their current predicament. They sat across from each other, both their left arms laid casually on the table so the chain didn't pull at either of them. Harry kept watching Malfoy from the corner of his eye, but the man never spoke or made eye contact with Harry.
"Potter, it's only paying attention to me," Draco said. "'Attention undivided.' It'll only pay attention to one of us."
It raised the staff to strike, and, seeing the gash briefly unguarded, Draco made a jab at its heart. But several things happened at once. The dagger met the gash at the wrong angle and deflected off the gemstones. The staff came crashing down on Draco's wand arm, and Draco both heard and felt a sickening snap. He sank to his knees, cradling his broken arm, and the dagger fell from his hand, clattering to a halt between the statue's feet as the staff was raised again.
Draco huffed and put one foot on the first stair. Honestly, knowing what he knew about Salazar Slytherin, he half expected a king cobra to come slithering down the wall and bite him before he could even blink. But, nothing happened. With each step, his anxiety grew as he expected to come face-to-face with their first challenge at any moment. He led the way higher into the pyramid, the only light coming from both of their wands and the only sound that of their feet and breathing.
much," she said. "Back then, they were making up all the rules as they went. They didn't have textbooks and years of scholarly research to learn from. I'm sure Slytherin wasn't sure his enchantments would hold after his death and he might have suspected loopholes in the concealment spells. I'm not sure. I'm just telling you what you need to know to be prepared. Hufflepuff was told that only a Slytherin prodigy would be able to find and open it. It should reveal itself to you if you both work together. But...I have to warn you. Once you set out to look for it, you either find it and free his spirit or you don't come back. Years ago, one of our group tried to accompany the pair on the journey. He made it a mile with them before he was suddenly transported fifty miles south and the prodigies were nowhere in sight. On his way back, he claimed to see them as a mirage on the horizon. And the best we can figure out is that there's an enchantment in the desert that takes the prodigies and puts them into an in-between realm of mirage as well. They only reappear fully when they've died, which means they were trapped, not able to find their way out of the desert no matter what."
in that pyramid. It doesn't change the fact that I don't want any attachments. It was all just heat of the moment stuff. Nothing has changed."
"Anyways," Susan continued. "Every time the prophecy is retold, a record of it appears on a shelf we have downstairs. When the next pair of prodigies has been marked, meaning one of them has heard the prophecy to activate it, our orb record shatters. We've been on the lookout for you two since it shattered a few weeks ago, making frequent trips to town because we know you can't Apparate. We must have missed you at the airport earlier this week."
This silence continued all the way back to the hotel and was only broken once they had entered their room and set down their bags.
Draco shrugged a shoulder, not looking up at him as he gathered the last bit of rice on his plate with his fork. "Same one or different is fine with me. As long as we have two beds."
"Whatever your secret is," Potter said, and Draco could tell he was being the most genuine he had ever seen him, "I will not judge you. Or laugh at you. You can trust me that it will never leave this tent. Ever."
The plan forming in his mind was a bad one, if not incredibly stupid and rash. But, he needed time away, time to think without Potter around. Maybe, if he could put some distance between him and the man for a bit, he would be able to consider things with a clearer head and realize his feelings for Potter weren't really worth exploring further.
"You're not trying on underwear," Potter pointed out. He raised an eyebrow. "Unless you're saying you go commando, in which case that's far too much information."
written across the body in slanted black calligraphy. "Derek, tell River I've found the next set of prodigies and you all should meet me back at headquarters after you've finished lunch."
Potter pulled off his pajama shirt casually. Draco's face flushed, and he had to hastily turn back to his bag and make a show of putting his things away while he waited for Potter to change.
By lunchtime the next day, Harry was almost certain there couldn't be a single owl within all of Cairo. The city was noisy, dusty, and littered with debris. If there had been a wizard within twenty miles, surely they would have done some magic to help tidy the streets. But...that wasn't necessarily true. There had to be wizards around somewhere. Bill had worked in Egypt, and Cairo was the largest city in the country. This had to be where the Gringotts was located. But where? Was there a whole Egyptian version of Diagon Alley hidden behind a merchant booth? Anything was possible where magical concealment was concerned, Harry reminded himself, which did nothing to boost his spirits.
Potter frowned. "About the same amount of land to work with as we had with Slytherin's. Do you think Gryffindor's tomb migrates too?"
Susan motioned to the nearest table, and they sat with Susan on one bench and he and Potter on the other across from her. "I know this is a lot to take in," she said slowly. "But, you're already here and have the marks and everything, which tells me you guys have figured out a bit of the prophecy."
Draco suddenly regained his ability to move, and he sat up quickly, pulling away from Potter. He turned so he was looking at him now, and he knew his own face was red, but for once it didn't matter to him. He was angry, angry at Slytherin and this prophecy crap. "You're talking nonsense, Potter. You don't have feelings for me. It's just the prophecy playing with your head."
Draco laid down first, drawing the bedclothes over himself. He stared at the ceiling for several minutes while listening to Potter trying to get comfortable. The chain kept tugging sharply even after Draco's arm had been dragged off the bed to hang over the side and give Potter more room. After a while, Potter huffed in annoyance.
Harry pushed himself forward and snatched both of his wrists, now holding them apart. "Stop," he said firmly, and it was this that made Malfoy meet his gaze, looking startled. "Stop touching those scars. If this conversation is making you so upset that you feel you need to cut or even harm yourself in the slightest, let's stop. I won't bring up the topic of us or those challenges or anything romantic again."
Could he possibly be attracted to Malfoy? That was absurd. Maybe...maybe it was a side effect of the prophecy. Since Gryffindor and Slytherin had been lovers, was the prophecy trying to make history repeat itself by bringing the two houses back together in a more intimate way? The original love affair brought into the present with fresh blood? But that didn't make sense either somehow.
