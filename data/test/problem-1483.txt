"Right, of course, you're the only son of-"
At first, Harry wasn't sure who'd said it. He didn't know if it was him or Malfoy or both of them at once. Maybe just a thought, a warning in his head.
"Ah yes, professor?"
"Oh, erm..." he'd left his crumpled up ideas for products lying around, "Sorry about that."
"You thought I didn't notice you staring? I didn't want to do this in there because it would cause a scene, but I can't believe you care that much about my teeth."
After not knowing for sure if the other one had been able to retrieve DNA at the Greengrass's until they were already outside, they talked through their procedure for Mrs. Fawley.
"The night he was murdered, Potter, say it like it is."
"Really?" Malfoy challenged.
"I'm a big fan when they GET THEIR HEADS OUT OF THEIR ARSES AND PLAY THE GAME!"
The only light was provided by the windows, which spanned the entire ceiling, but it was pouring rain outside, so they weren't doing much.
The logical solution was to owl Malfoy and call the whole thing off. He hadn't gotten an owl again after Hedwig, though, and the ministry ones were all busy doing more important things. He could call. That's what he'd do.
Ron groaned and turned over onto his stomach.
"Why are you calling, then?" she asked. "Are the nightmares..."
"Not if you don't want me to. They won't either." Ron and Hermione nodded their agreement after a lot of pointed eyeing from Harry.
Harry couldn't help but laugh, and the others joined in.
The only exit other than the door was a window off to one side that hadn't been opened in a long time. He flicked a tissue off the sill and tried to pry it open. It wouldn't budge. He got out his wand and tried an Alohomora. Nothing.
"Having people to confide in! People to have fun with. People that feel like family."
"Sure am. You a Legilimens or something?"
Malfoy gave an obnoxious fake gasp.
"No different." He said it really slowly, like he was turning the words over and examining them for flaws. "You think we have that much in common, that our relationships with people from Hogwarts are 'no different?'"
Finally, he managed to find his voice. "Alright, well, erm... to the apparition point, then!"
"Fine. See you at eight. At Close Maggiore." He kept shaking his head as he walked out and when the door finally shut behind him, Harry immediately fire-called Ron.
That, Ron snatched out of his hand and uncorked, chugging the contents down. Within a minute he was through with the side effects and looking much more agreeable.
Smiling ever so slightly, Hermione said, "I haven't seen you this... engaged with anything in a long time. I think maybe a project's good for you, and I think you probably know that too."
"Merlin no, Potter. What do you take me for?"
"They say what?" Harry demanded.
This couldn't happen. The shop was Fred and George's favourite thing in the world. It was their creation, their lives' work.
'So what now?' Hermione's words tumbled around in Harry's head. He'd spent the last few months falling arse over tea kettle for Draco Sodding Malfoy, and there was no going back now. He'd committed crimes, he'd lost his job, and he'd mourned the death of a loved one and the first chapter of his life. Now was a time for new beginnings, now was a time for moving on.
Have you spent your life dreaming of a date with Harry Potter? Now could be your chance! The young wizard is looking for someone to settle down with and welcomes anyone to fill out the questionnaire attached below to apply. Answer for an opportunity to be chosen as Harry Potter's Lucky Lady!
"Ah. Perhaps."
"Hogsmeade trips!"
Malfoy laughed with him and it felt strange. Good-strange, but still strange.
He when his father was murdered, he was engaged to a new girl via his instructions that he'd never met before, but who was Pure-Blooded and would produce him an heir. The wedding was called off.
d) Elf-made Wine
He turned off the machine.
Malfoy and Ginny broke out laughing again and Jerome looked like he was caught in the middle of something he did not want to be a part of.
Harry remembered his Glamour was still in place and dissolved it wandlessly, defeating the original purpose of the 'misunderstanding.'
"Well, don't you look ravishing?"
"Yeah."
"How bad was it? You two didn't fight did you?"
Malfoy laughed. "Right, me in New York."
"Today at 4. There are only three candidates left to test and two of them live in New York." Harry put the plates in front of Teddy and Malfoy and took one for himself along with some of the coffee Malfoy had made.
"Excuse me?"
Malfoy's shoulders were draped in a large black cloak, a red bat seal pinned on one side of his chest.
"Not him, just you. He has to wait outside."
"We what?"
"Just barely. I've been trying to make myself come see you but it was..."
It would have looked odd if Harry had left quickly, so he sat by her bedside and waited. She was much older than the last time he'd seen her. Her hair was grayer and her face was sunken in. She didn't look much like Neville anymore.
Malfoy shook his head at him and walked to the door.
When they got back to Price's apothecary, Malfoy told him he'd better prepare to be impressed. They'd let go of each other's hands a long time ago but he could still feel the tingling and Teddy was still staring at them both skeptically.
"What if," Seamus said, "we take the Nipple Twister idea and market it as part of the WonderWitch line? That could sell, right?"
"Ha, you wish."
"Astoria," Malfoy said.
"Well, I was thinking maybe a Quodpot game."
"Oh, abstergo. It's slow progress, but I'm getting there."
He dropped one off with Verity, who was cleaning out the Pygmy puff cage, and her wistful sigh was enough to make him laugh. He took the other two into the manufacturing centre, where he'd told Malfoy they should meet.
"Well that's—" Malfoy hesitated, flicking on the windscreen wipers to clear away the bugs crowding his vision, "that's bullshite."
Malfoy rolled his eyes. "What happened to the rule-breaking Gryffindor I knew and hated."
a) The latest football game
"Nnnngh, Potter-"
One step at a time. It was going to be a weird night.
"I don't have a lot of ideas," Harry admitted quietly, sensing that a change of subject might be necessary.
"Why are you even asking for my advice, Harry?"
He dragged Teddy downstairs to meet Malfoy for breakfast at 9. He rolled his eyes when he saw Harry.
"Yes, Verity. Is there a problem?"
Ron showed up at Grimmauld place that night and started pacing immediately.
"Treat it as practice, then. You've never had a steady relationship since Gin."
"Could be interesting," said Luna. "I've always wanted to lay an egg."
"Right, sorry, mature. But Merlin, the nerve of that boy. Did you see the way he was looking at me? Like a kicked puppy. Like he wasn't the one to break it off in the first place."
"I'll distract her," Malfoy said. "You get the fork."
Malfoy spent most of the meal trying to explain to Harry why he wanted to find his father's murderer. It wasn't unbelievable to Harry by any means. The second he learned that his parents hadn't died in a car crash and someone named Voldemort was the reason he'd been living with his horrible aunt and uncle since he was one, Harry had been patiently (and sometimes not so patiently) waiting for that moment in the Great Hall when he killed him.
• • •
Neville grabbed Ginny just seconds before she would have gotten her hands around Kreacher's neck, restraining her with minimal struggle.
McGonagall knew he was an Auror, she'd helped him prep before he was hired. She also knew that it'd been his dream for more years than he could remember.
They stood there in the dark for a moment before Harry whispered, "Lumos."
"Our Harry forgot to mention one key detail. Puddlemere is not playing just anyone, oh no, they're going up against The Ballycastle Bats."
"And yet you're going to make us get there an hour early just to sit in the stands and freeze our arses off?"
"What do you mean?"
She didn't exactly have the kind of style that he'd want for a house, but a joke shop was right up her street.
"Agh."
"You know Glamours wouldn't have been allowed in the restaurant."
"I'm not obtuse, Potter. Besides, it's just how it is for all things, a person does something bad and the punishment feels a thousand times worse."
"Right, sure."
"Best day of my adult life."
"Hermione, do you remember when you told me that how the public views something is all about how it's presented?"
Malfoy snatched it up, thumbing through the pages quickly. "This is barely anything." He was right, three pages, uninvestigated, open and shut. "They found the DNA of two people near the crime scene and there was no investigation. No witnesses, no cameras-" His voice was getting closer to shouting with every word and Harry cast a silencing charm.
"Horribly Gryffindor song." He made a face at the cover. "Greatest hits my arse."
"I didn't know you could dance, Harry," said Luna.
c) somewhere in between
"You actually watch television?"
"Er... no?"
Harry shook his head but didn't disagree. He focused on the lights and the beat thumping and the feeling of being completely lost in a crowd, with only Draco Malfoy knowing or caring who he was. It was exhilarating, even if it was just for a moment.
"Oh!" she said delightedly, clapping her hands together. "Was that funny? I didn't mean it to be a joke."
Harry went shopping for dress robes that would suit him that weekend. At least if he messed up his dancing, he wouldn't look horrible.
"Potter, that won't be possible."
"Don't. Say it. If you say it, then it's real, and it's something I have to deal with."
b) Pumpkin Juice
"So I'm emotionally connected to my fathers killer? Great."
Harry jumped, taking another step back for good measure.
"Inconsiderate—"
My favourite dessert is
e) Ice Cream
"Potter, stop that."
a) Gryffindor
The woman's name was Alicia Baldwin and according to Ron, she'd answered every question the way Harry's ideal partner would. The only problem was that Alicia was a gold medal-winning ballroom dancer. The good news was that his reputation for being a terrible dancer had been mostly kept out of the papers. She wanted a partner who could dance and that was perfectly reasonable, but Harry couldn't. Yet. He was half-convinced Ron had done this to mess with him.
"Fifth year."
"What do you mean about not getting it to blow up right?" he asked Seamus.
"Yeah, okay that's fine. Look, what happened? If you didn't fuck Malfoy then why are you freaking out? Is it because you wanted to?"
Not an original owner, not the only person currently competent enough to manage the store, but just what it was left with.
"Pardon?"
"I could run a few diagnostic charms if you like," he offered. "It looks like a spin on the Midas jinx, but I hope for your sake I'm wrong."
There! See, that was the outrage he was looking for! If only she wasn't a couple of portkeys away, he'd grab her up and spin her around in a circle.
"Fuck you," Malfoy said with a laugh.
"You're a great, big oaf of a man who can't follow simple instructions! So obviously you didn't mean to! Hire a professional, Potter, how hard is that? But no, it had to be you who was almost suffocated by orange rubbish cause you were too busy singing Magic Works and dancing like a first year! What if I hadn't been here? What if it'd created a coating around your head? You'd die, that's what! If no one got up here in time—and believe me you, that manager of yours wasn't coming up any time soon—you'd be dead."
It seemed like the end of the conversation and Harry knew he should say something back. When he thought it over later that night, he realised he could have just said, "Goodbye" or "See you then" but he wasn't hours past the event and regretting every second as it was happening so, with the considerable pressure so respond he said, "I like you too."
They looked at each other, and Harry swore he could feel the weight of that statement simmer in the air.
"I can't let you do this."
"Harry, you do realise how late it is, don't you?"
Harry might have found a solution to The Problem. This was what Hermione had taken to calling his love life, naturally. As was typical, she acted like the answer should have been obvious to him all along, even though it wasn't. Harry was also pretty convinced she never would have thought of it if the events leading up to the Idea hadn't happened exactly as they had.
"Not why do I need to get used to it; why is it true?"
Harry tried not to stare, but he just couldn't help it. He wondered if he should say something or if that would be worse than just letting her keep it there. She didn't take well to teasing so he couldn't go about it in a funny way. What if she was offended? Every time she smiled at him, instead of feeling warm and fuzzy, he just focused on the green stuck in her teeth. What if she tried to kiss him? Would it still be there? When they were outside and had finished their meal, she said something that shocked him.
"I'm glad I didn't. What was that anyway? Some type of Auror field training?"
Harry almost laughed at that because not all curry tasted the same and so surely there would be something she liked but he didn't and instead suggested she get one of the House salads which she did.
"Four hundred and thirty."
"Potter, between the dinner with the Shaw's tonight and seeing Gibson on Monday evening, we have a full four days in New York. We aren't wasting it doing whatever it is you Gryffindors imagine is relaxing."
When they made it back to the hotel and Teddy went inside to take a shower, Malfoy asked him how he thought everything was.
"All I really know how to do is make things blow up..."
"We could say we're courting."
It's not easy facin' up
She lead Harry back to where they'd been having tea. He sat awkwardly and pointedly ignored the splotches of colour rising on her cheeks.
"If you want to save this shop—and I do not doubt that somewhere in your... heart..." he said that like he's originally intended on a few other choice words, "you really think that's the best plan—then you'd do well to listen to my advice. I've saved twenty-five businesses this year and shut down another thirty. I know what I'm talking about. Clean up the orange gunk, open the doors on time, and for Merlin's sake, get some new products in here. Anything you have left now," he gestured to the shelves full of dented boxes of Everlasting Eyelashes and Nose Biting Teacups.
Verity eyed Malfoy appraisingly and then looked from him to Harry and back.
"None."
A little old woman was sitting at the head of the room, and she tapped her gavel just thrice, waiting in silence for everyone to look at her.
Ron and Ginny stumbled into the room sheepishly, Ginny trying to stifle her giggles while Ron looked mostly apologetic.
Malfoy smirked at the face he must have been making. "What? We're outside. Don't tell me Potter's become a rule-follower since Hogwarts. Sure you don't want one? Granger's not around."
Malfoy patted him on the shoulder rather harshly. "Cheer up, Potter. In just a few short weeks you'll have this crusty old dump all to yourself."
Ron stopped pacing and met him with fiery eyes. "No, I haven't bloody talked to Malfoy. I've been talking to Hermione about the ethics of a memory charm on Patricia Gibson. I don't know and I don't care what you've been doing, but if it gets out that you've been testing DNA without approval, you'll never get a moment's peace again."
"That's what that one woman said when she discussed why the Ministry had chosen you. The least biased, actually, was her wording. Considering our history..."
ATTENTION ALL ELIGIBLE WITCHES
d) Rural areas
Then Malfoy was gone with a pop, and Harry was left staring at the empty space where he'd been. He wondered why this felt like such a win, when only moments ago he'd wanted to do anything that would end with Malfoy gone.
d) Soda
"I've been there before, as a child. My great aunt Walburga used to live there."
Harry was about to respond saying that obviously, them being closed was Malfoy's own fault, when suddenly Malfoy began pointing one of his obnoxiously elegant looking fingers at the products downstairs.
b) Type-A
"Oh no," she stopped him. "My private one, I insist."
"Are these from..?" He pulled away from Malfoy to run his fingers across the scars lining his skin. Harry hadn't ever wondered if it'd scarred before. There were three pale white ones crisscrossing his chest and a few thinner ones that only took up a few centimetres.
Harry couldn't help but notice how much less he liked the look of this Malfoy than the other one.
"Harry, who are you kidding? When it comes to you, you're always obsessing over Malfoy. Get some sleep."
"Half four in the morning."
"Weasley sent me here."
Harry stared at him blankly.
Ginny went all red at that like Harry hadn't seen her do since she was in third year. Interesting.
"No, I meant my reaction to your Problem. I still think it's stupid and that you've come up with an idiotic way to solve it, but you've done a lot for me and I shouldn't have been as offended that you thought I was romantically inclined towards you."
"It'll be the blood that's your dad."
"Shove off," Harry said again and Teddy shrugged and pushed Harry away so he could get up and turn off the lights.
"I still don't know why you're doing this, Potter, but thanks."
"The good news is, it's more modified than I originally thought. Everything in there has a solid surface layer of orange, which is transmissible by any and all touch," he emphasised this with a stern look directed at Harry, "but it's removable. With ample charm work and preparation, there should be a minimal loss."
"Find yourself a new girlfriend, Potter?"
"Go to sleep, Potter."
Malfoy arrived at 6 with takeaway and wearing tight blue jeans. He looked like himself again, Harry was glad to see.
"There is no way anyone needs all these Flavours," Malfoy said.
Draco had given him 3 things to work on. Well, not so much given as yelled them at him. It still counted.
b) Average
She winced and Harry thought it was a reaction to his words before she blew on her tea and settled her expression into something more business-like. "Right then. I suppose I should ask why you want to do this now."
Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day
"So this is what all the Auror training is good for."
"Really?"
Alicia laughed and grabbed Harry's arm. "Looks like you have a sense of humour, I think we'll have fun tonight."
Malfoy's smirk turned into a reluctant smile. "Maybe."
"Oh Merlin." Harry didn't read the paper much anymore. "What're they saying?"
"My dad's hugs!"
"The wizarding world still hates you."
"I'm just monitoring your progress. It is my job, after all."
At a quarter to six, Harry floo-called Hermione to fill her in on the events of his time the day before with Malfoy. When he was done, her eyes were wide and she was leaning forward in interest so far into it was like she was just a few centimetres from his face.
20 minutes later, they were out in the hall, each of the ones old enough to have wands attempting to cast and the younger ones looking on in awe and occasionally managing to get a turn.
"Come on, you won't even stay for a bit?" Neville turned imploring eyes on her. "We could pop in a film. Or do something fun. A cake! We could bake a cake."
Harry sighed to himself and got dressed. If she quit over this, Hermione would kill him.
Malfoy stood in the doorway, looking at the office with a sneer. Harry felt weirdly defensive of his progress, so he was already on edge.
"Pfft."
"Mrs. Malfoy?"
"I think he deserves to know."
"I still want to know why, though."
Harry blinked, startled. He'd been sure Ginny was going to go for it.
Harry nodded unthinkingly and let himself be lead back. He'd have to owl Hermione to apologise for missing dinner later, but he'd see her tomorrow at the Burrow.
"Good."
No colors anymore I want them to turn black
My Patronus is a(n)
Harry jumped, turning to where she'd pointed.
This meant the only thing left for fixing was his relationship with Malfoy. With Draco, fuck he had to get better at that.
He went on to tell Malfoy about various absurd or strangely specific crimes he'd heard about or witnessed the arrests for and Malfoy listened intently.
Before Seamus could respond, Ginny wandered in, presumably to see what all the ruckus was about.
"I'll shove the payment up their fucking arses!"
When Harry was getting ready to leave, Hermione asked if he was planning on seeing Malfoy again. He was pleased to tell her that he was, even though he left out the fact that it was for testing DNA, not a social gathering.
Daphne called for the house elf who escorted him out and Malfoy followed not five minutes later. His eyes were red and puffy but he held up a handkerchief like the one Daphne had used proudly.
b) Taking a nice walk
Was this it, a confession of sorts?
Harry snapped closed the Malfoy Murder Mission file he'd been not-really-examining, but instead of this giving Ron the impression that he now had his full attention, it made him snatch it from Harry's desk.
The question came at a time when Harry finally had an answer. Ron had owled that morning to say there was an applicant who had answered all the questions perfectly and Harry told Malfoy this.
Did he?
"Okay?"
"My apologies," Malfoy shouted back. "It's just your boss is an idiotic—"
Ron immediately clapped his hands over his ears, miming a gag. "Oh, that is rank."
b) Slytherin
"You sure about that? I think Potter might be here to see me."
She meant Harry. Malfoy nodded and Daphne opened the door. Most of his view was blocked by the people in front of him, but he could see a king-sized bed and a tiny woman laying down in the middle of it. She was so pale she nearly blended in with the sheets.
"Pansy thought it'd be good fun. Being the kind of thing our parents would frown upon made it all the more appealing, I suppose. Blaise and... and Crabbe had managed to find some beat-up old thing in the forbidden forest that we could drive. No idea how it ended up there, mind you, but we all tried it out. I took a liking to it more than the others."
"Hilarious. Someone's having you on, Malfoy."
Malfoy spent the next half hour waving his wand around, making annoying faces, and sighing. Every time he did so, Harry grew more on edge.
Malfoy put down his beer and stood up. "Save it for something that matters to you."
"Fine. Whatever. But it's not like that with me. I still talk to my friends because I care about them."
"Sorry to bother you, Mrs. Longbottom. I'll show myself out."
d) Never
"I honestly doubt he'd let me anywhere near his hair."
"Oh we're not, we don't-"
A blood malediction was nothing short of a life sentence. It would be for her child too, if it resurfaced there. Harry couldn't imagine what it must have taken for Draco to walk away from a woman he loved because having his child would doom her and the baby both.
Malfoy's lips thinned into a flat line and the heat of his glare could be felt even across the distance between them. "No, it's not likely."
Malfoy insisted they eat at the table he had near the edge of the patio as they "could at least pretend to be civilised, Potter."
"Sure thing. It's a martini with a twist, by the way. You'll have to make her another one."
Harry tried his best to kick Malfoy under the table, but he was already consumed with murmuring to Ginny and Oliver about something that was making them laugh loudly and Jerome look uncomfortable. Distraction came in the form of Dean and Seamus. They looked happy to be there, both decked in dark muggle suits with red piping and joined them at the table.
"Do you think it's biologically encoded in us to care about our parents? Even when they make bad choices and force us into a life of darkness... are we still wired to love them?"
Malfoy got out of the cab and met Harry's eyes. Fuck, Harry wanted this. He tried to mentally will Malfoy to leave.
Dean snorted. "And the shop, I'm assuming. You'll need someone to work on the designs for the packages too, I bet. I could do that."
Malfoy tilted his head, considering. He'd slowed down slightly, but they were still moving fast enough that sand and grit flew into Harry's eyes as he leaned out his own window to look at the passing scenery.
f) Loyal
Malfoy exited the shop and Verity and Harry stood staring out the front window at the street until he was long gone from sight.
"I'm not being an arse," he said like an arse would.
"The Cannons haven't won a match in years," Harry told him.
• • •
Inside Wheezes, Verity was arranging some dung bombs on a shelf. She smiled as they walked in, and Harry cast a quick Tempus.
Malfoy grinned at him and leaned in and whispered, "See, I told you it was a better song."
"He works in my department."
"He has always had a peculiar relationship with him. I tried my best to protect Draco, but he wanted his father's praise more than anything in the world. He would have gone on to marry and have children, all to please him. He took the mark for that same reason."
"What're you talking about?"
"If only he was bludgered before every match," Malfoy said. "Then you could explain how he flies the rest of the time."
"No that's not-" he shoved the invitation at Malfoy and then took the list of names out of his pocket as well. "I copied down the names from your list and I did some extensive and possibly immoral research. 24 of the 27 people who could have killed your father are going to be there."
I would consider myself
"Harry," Malfoy said slowly as if sounding it out. His posh accent made it sound like another name entirely, so different from when he'd said it with a sneer.
"Sorry, no. I think I'd best go to bed."
f) I gave up
"Well some people have alibis, you see." He sat on the edge of Harry's desk and picked at an invisible thread on his trousers. "And I already suspect someone over anyone else."
"Er.."
"Yeah, whatever." Malfoy threw his powder and disappeared in a swirl of green flames, calling out "135 Kennington Lane," as he went.
He appeared with a pop, taking in the room around him and sighing.
"It's... the taste of my mum's cooking. And the lights on the trees at Christmas. It's hot summer days by the black lake and late nights when we stay up playing games in the Ravenclaw common room."
"Christmas presents!" a little girl named Olive shouted.
"I heard you and Hermione met for coffee."
Ron frowned at this. "Harry, I thought you dancing with Malfoy at the Ball was your way of coming out. We all did."
"Sorry, sorry," he said.
He heard a large thwap from behind Ron's, and waited a moment before opening it up.
He had one more sample to test, though, so he could know for certain if they'd found Lucius Malfoy's killer, or if they'd messed up somehow. He looked over at the flowers that were waiting on the counter by the machine, and then he realised he didn't have to test anything at all. He already knew.
'Mortlapp, Motley, Moxy, Mungo,' Harry snorted at the huge file. 'Murphy, Muterlog, Muval, Muyop.'
"Sounds brilliant!" said Harry.
When he sat a plate and mug of tea in front of her, Ginny took a long sip and sighed. "I take it back. Maybe we'll use the imperius so all you do is cook for us, and the rest of the time we can keep you in the cellar with Kreacher. I could live with that, I think."
"I can't even get a wisp!" a fourth-year girl complained. She'd been brought along with her mother and really only talked about how much her heels hurt and how bad she was at defensive magic.
He had less than a square metre of the floor clear, and he already felt like giving up.
"Wait-"
"I'll choose to take that as a compliment."
"Not a one."
He flicked on the light in the bathroom and pissed, then looked in the mirror. His face was drawn, his eyes were red and puffy, and his hair was somehow messier than usual. There wasn't anything to be done for it, of course. He washed his hands and left.
Looking around the room, Harry baulked at the dust covering every single surface. It seemed like it hadn't been used since Fred had died, maybe even before Harry's 7th year.
"Still."
Malfoy's hand stilled. "You came all the way here to ask me that?"
"What?" Harry was irrationally worried that he'd done something wrong and that now Malfoy would leave for sure.
"No. Well, a bit. Her portrait is still hanging in one of the hallways. Nasty woman, always shouting insults and complaining. We've got her covered up with a curtain but she isn't pleased about that either."
Across the room, he thought he saw a glimpse of white-blond hair that he recognised, but as soon as he looked, it was gone.
Ron looked over his shoulder and booed.
a) Rational discussion
Ron's brow furrowed. "Why not?"
"You sure you aren't hiding cooking skills somewhere in there? Or maybe a house elf at your flat?"
"Without a job, Harry, without something to get you out of bed each day, you'll fall apart. Who will look after Teddy then? And Barkley? This is your whole life we're talking about here."
Harry nodded morosely, focused on the way the dust specks seemed to float in the air around Malfoy's head like fairies.
Ginny gave him a big thumbs up and grabbed Oliver to join them.
Harry walked around it slowly, taking in the simple frame feeling like a fool as he pulled on the door handle gently and bent down inside. The silence was stifling as he closed himself in, but then Malfoy the key in the ignition and they were sailing smoothly down dirt roads.
c) Ravenclaw
"It's good manners."
Malfoy sighed deeply and this time when he exhaled it wasn't full of smoke. "Potter, when a wizard becomes head of their line, they are the oldest surviving Male on their family tree."
Malfoy wiped his eyes and smiled. "You've gotten good at taking attention away from yourself. Like tonight."
"Potter- Harry, I'm going to ask again, why are you helping me?"
"I dunno, it's your life, I figure there are gross bits."
Malfoy had given him his phone number and told him to call. Harry hadn't been thinking logically about this. He'd just remembered the look on Malfoy's face when he'd talked about his dad and felt the urge to do something about it. What was he gonna do, anyway? How would he get the file? Was what he was doing illegal? It had to be. But he was only solving a crime, what was wrong with that? It was his job to solve crimes. Crimes he was assigned, not ones he picked up off the street.
"That's rich."
Not knowing Malfoy outside of work and sometimes-Teddy context proved to be a problem later in the day. Clos Maggiore didn't have a table available at eight that night. He tried to find a way to talk to him through a coworker, but he was already off work. Harry checked the time. Shit, almost six. He barely had two hours to fix this.
"So that makes us Ron's?" Neville asked.
"Really? What is it then?"
Fine. If this was how Ron wanted to do it, this was how it would be done. It was out of Harry's hands, anyway. Now he just had to wait.
Hermione snorted, shifting in her seat. "Choose away. You start acting like a great big baby whenever Malfoy's around."
c) Cities
"And from there?"
"It was yours."
"Why not? In fact, you could meet Professor Burnes right now if you want to. He's the head of our fellows program at Ilvermorny."
"Fine fine, I believe you. Look, I might have convinced Malfoy to go to the ball alone. If it wasn't for whatsername I'd suggest the same to you."
They were useless at keeping secrets from each other. Bloody married couple.
"None of us read that day's. It was too painful."
The music was slow and most people had taken up a Foxtrot, a dance Harry recognised but could not replicate. Amber lead him through the steps, pointedly ignoring every time he stepped on her toes.
"Tell me now," he said. "It is the one."
"You alright, mate? The kids are just inside, mum's watching them and Hermione's talking with Angelina. You seem all jumpy."
Her eyes were impossibly bloodshot, and her hair was tied up in a knot. That was all he could see of her except for the overlarge shirt that he knew said, 'Let's all just keep our fingers crossed and hope for the best,' scrawled across the chest. It had once been George's.
"Bloody saviour complex," he said, and he stormed out.
Ron and Hermione had introduced him to one of their friends from work. Maria was a sweet Medi-Witch with a gap tooth that had never been corrected. This became important later.
• • •
Suddenly, he grew more serious, thinking about the possible repercussions of all this. "What am I gonna do, Verity? What if he says the shop has to close?"
"Ron's got an early shift tomorrow, and he passed out feeding Hugo on the couch. Why'd you call?"
He laid back on the work table, a muttered, "Fuck," the only sound he made until late that afternoon.
"Cuddling my cat."
Harry was pretty sure he was blushing to the roots of his hair. "Well, that's not erm... that's not it. I'm not gay." He went back to the machine and studied the pattern of the two signatures he was on.
"Wait, I forgot to give you my address."
"And Mr. Malfoy, a future fellow perhaps?"
"Yes he was.. very dear to me."
"I saw him. He chatted up every woman who so much as said hello. Stole like three of my dance partners, though, so not a bad bloke in my books."
"I'm not really sure. To an extent, I think. Maybe Hermione would know."
"Merlin, do you really think so?"
Malfoy kept looking at him without saying anything and Harry didn't know how to fill the silence of if he was even supposed to. Finally, Malfoy spoke up.
He imagined a young Sirius dancing around his room at Hogwarts with his dad, Remus, and Peter. They were having fun, singing loudly and off-key, his mum was standing in the doorway grinning at them making fools of themselves.
b) A kneazle or cat
a) Butterbeer
Is that what they were now? Friends?
Harry woke up the next morning like he always did, the remnants of his nightmare still lingering in the forefront of his mind. Tonks was being tortured, shrieking as Teddy was ripped from her arms by a version of Nagini that inexplicably had six heads.
"The debtor may petition for a replacement if and only if the following instances occur—"
"Better mine than hers. Besides, she's got two kids already without needing to parent me. Three, if you count Ron. "
Had the employees done something to it? Maybe they'd converted it into a lounge, or a staff kitchen, or a sex dungeon.
According to Malfoy, no one of high prestige would be there for at least another two hours, but Harry wasn't risking it.
"Come on in." He lead Harry to the bar where he was busy cleaning up. Everyone was gone and he offered Harry a beer.
"Fuck yes, I will."
"Er... just that, really. You're trying to get it to work using a spell, but anyone who buys the product will expect it to work without an incantation, yeah?" Seamus chuckled. "So you've got to interweave the enchantment with the material."
•  •  •
"He's barely a baby."
He opened the pouch and found the promised amount resting inside. It only took him a moment to think of a completely ridiculous way to spend it. In fact, he only allowed himself that much time, because anything more would have been affected by reason.
Neville laughed, nudging Luna and Dean until they looked at whatever was so funny. Harry's face heated, but he pretended it wasn't happening.
"I thought you weren't sure about this."
"I know you want me to ask what they are, Potter. I'm not going to."
• • •
Harry found himself smiling, not entirely sure why.
"Oi," said Harry, "it's not exactly his fault, is it? You'd be dazed too after getting bludgered."
Malfoy slid with him, looking grateful.
"Oh piss off."
Harry smiled flatly at Teddy and pushed his plate closer to him so he'd take a bite. One he did, Harry answered his question. "I got a Portkey for 4 p.m. that will land in America at 11:02 a.m. their time. Once we're there, Malfoy and I have to find some people for a project, but that won't take long. We can spend the rest of the time exploring.
"So," said Harry, mostly to stop the silence that had settled around the table, "you're Malfoy's boyfriend, then?"
Occasionally, Harry would hear the speaker on the bottom floor blast a staticky welcome message for visitors, but those moments were few and far between. Verity didn't come up to check on them like he thought she might, so he and Malfoy developed a rhythm all of their own.
"You know what the worst part is?"
Luna did not seem fazed by this, and she simply took a seat on the couch, fanning her large stripey-green skirt out around her and calling, "Kreacher."
"It would break Mrs Weasley's heart to lose this too, even if she doesn't know it. We can't do that to her."
"You mean the best team after the Falcons?"
"Well? Did you find it?!"
They couldn't have been more than 12 and 10 respectively and they approached Harry with the kind of wide-eyed reverence that bothered him in adults but amused him in children. Luckily, they were far enough away from the movement that he could hear them.
"Maybe. You'll have to give it a little time if you want to know everything, though."
"You really want to own a joke shop for the rest of your life?"
Malfoy handed him the drink and continued wiping down the bar. The question popped into his head again and he thought there'd be no better time to ask.
Harry looked at Malfoy and they shared a nod. Malfoy's eyes were tired and his face was paler than usual.
He dragged her into the kitchen by the arm and pushed her into a chair next to Ron, who was scarfing down food at a pace almost equivalent to his usual gusto.
"You can come out now!" He called.
"Fine, floo then."
"Oh, happy, are they? I'll bet, yeah. The absolute fucking wankers."
"Shut up."
"There's no way you could know."
There weren't many handholds, but he was able to hold on to the window ledges and start down the side.
"Is it true that you could produce a Patronus in your third year?"
"Couldn't have guessed," Harry told her.
"I'm just saying. I've seen the way you-"
Malfoy laughed. He actually laughed a full-bodied thing that shook his frame and made his eyes water. "You're shitting me! You thought Weasley set us up as the answer to your love life? You just told me you're not even gay!"
"As soon as you learn to stop giving them. You're embarrassing yourself."
He put them, in side by side, and looked at the reading. "Both of these have remarkably similar magical signatures to you..."
That was at least until he was spotted by the children of a couple who were somewhere over near the bar.
The phone beeped and he knew she'd hung up. He was lucky she hadn't yelled his ear off for waking up a new mother. As he fell into bed,  he thought about Hermione's opinion. For that night at least, there was no getting out of obsessing over Malfoy. He was Harry Potter, after all. That's what he was good at.
Mr. Parham chuckled and lead them to the door. "Come again any time, I did so enjoy your company."
"Well it was very nice meeting you, Mr. Parham."
With a sigh, he looked at the orange gunk admitted that he should probably wave the white flag and get a team to clear out the rest of the office. It felt wrong, somehow, letting strangers invade Fred and George's space, but he knew it would have to be done in the end, and putting it off wasn't helping anybody.
"Careful, Potter!" Zabini called when he had almost caught up with him. "That one's a man-eater."
Harry laughed. "She's not wrong. You're still friends with Parkinson, then?"
"Quite right," Ron said, finally sitting down himself. He'd surprised everyone after the war by getting invested in Healing too. Hermione actually hadn't looked much into Mind-Healing before he'd convinced her.
"Mate," he said, "what the hell are you waking us up for? The sun hasn't even fucking risen."
"If you wouldn't mind, I need to use the restroom," Harry said, planning on excusing himself so he could distract Patricia with a firecall in order for Malfoy to make an escape.
A house elf opened the door and lead them into a room where Daphne Greengrass, a woman Harry vaguely remembered from Hogwarts was waiting for them.
c) Playing Quidditch
"A Patronus," Harry told them, "is the warmth of the fire after you've been out in the cold. It's your best friend smiling at you from across the great hall. It's the feeling of flying and the stars dancing in the sky above you."
The game ended 8 to 2 in the Red Sox's favour and Teddy grouched about it until they got to the hotel where they got some kababs from outside.
"Hermione would kill me for this, she really would."
"Well no, see, the one on the right, the blood, that one is similar to you in energy strength and it signifies a strong genetical bond. The other isn't similar to the first any more than most would be, but it also has similarities to yours in energy strength and emotional connection."
Malfoy scoffed and looked at Teddy for support but he just shrugged. Harry wasn't going to give up that easily.
Harry looked at Malfoy, noticing the careful way he was tracing the ring of water his glass had left on the table.
"Thanks, it was my mum's."
"Just because you're sad no one's ever wanted to do that to you..." The rest of the sentence he didn't hear, but Harry snorted and went to his room to change into something more Quidditch-Appropriate.
"You want to come in? I have Firewhiskey."
e) Get revenge on my enemies
She snorted, meeting Harry's gaze for a brief moment. Her face reddened and she leaned back against the mostly-empty stand behind them, cupping her hands around her mouth to holler, "Keep playing right like that, Wood! At this rate, you'll win me a bet!"
As they walked towards the stairs, they were led past countless empty display cases, and Malfoy's eyebrows rose higher at each one.
"You know, I think I will join," said Lee, sitting. "It'd be a lot harder to see your lovely face from across the pitch, wouldn't it? Though I suppose Omnioculars have to be good for something."
"Wow. That sure does sound like a party. How would we even get the DNA?"
"For tea, I'm sure we'll manage a free moment."
your final dance "Abstergo!"
Mrs. Fawley smiled at them both and patted Malfoy on the hand. "I have to go, but owl me if I can ever be of any assistance."
"Other way around. Pansy got her hooked on it and she forced me to get one. Said it would be better than owling."
Harry didn't respond and Ron deflated and sat down next to him.
"We've come to keep you company," Luna said, bouncing over and greeting her with a kiss on the forehead.
The image was funnier than he liked to admit. The only real pizza Harry'd had growing up had been leftovers from the cafeteria or a birthday party but back when he, Hermione, and Ron had all been living at Grimmauld place, it was a nightly occurrence.
Ron walked in a few minutes later, looking much more refreshed.
Now Malfoy just looked terrified. Not like, 6th year terrified or anything, but his face had paled and his eyes darted to Harry's face and back to Ginny once. Actually, Harry was quite sure that if he hadn't spent years studying all of Malfoy's expressions in school when he should have been studying for potions, he would have missed the fear entirely, but it was there.
"I thought you might say that. The mission is over, though, and you won't be interested in furthering the other aspects of our relationship."
"No sir."
"Now come on, there aren't any two flavours on this list you wouldn't be able to tell apart."
"What?"
"We got all the samples! With the parents so relaxed without their kids around, nice touch, by the way, even the most reserved ones drank."
Harry smiled as Draco crawled under the covers with him. His feet were cold and they sent pricks of ice up Harry's legs.
As for the actual logistics of the grand re-opening event... Harry groaned. He'd need to talk to the Prophet to get the word out, and he'd ask Luna to run something in the Quibbler too, though it'd reach considerably fewer people. Then there was figuring out the date. Malfoy had suggested the start of December, and he could write to McGonagall to figure out the nearest Hogsmeade weekend to that so they'd be sure to get some business.
"Then lets go to the lab."
Harry had been too focused on staring to bother feeling offended.
"But er... Malfoy."
"I can show you my Ministry Identification."
Lorelai was nice and plenty funny. She was pretty too. Her hair was long and black and her red dress looked nice with her dark skin tone. She was taller than Harry in heels, though, and he wasn't sure how he felt about that.
b) Warm places like the beach
They were both quiet for a few moments.
"Hardly." Here he scoffed and Harry took a step closer until he was only a few centimetres from touching him.
Lorelai found him hiding outside the doors of the room where the auction was being held. He was waiting for the bidding to be over so he could go in and thank everybody again before leaving.
Malfoy huffed out a laugh. "I see. Well, you've still got time. I've seen shop owners who were worse off and still managed to pull it together in time."
"Honestly," said Ron, "you'd think he had spell damage or something the way you were speaking to him."
"Hmm, let's see. If you lose, I want..." Lee looked around the stadium, presumably for inspiration.
"Oh lovely, Harry, you're here. Ron made some bacon and eggs if you haven't eaten."
Harry took the letter from Neville and flipped it over so he could scribble on the back.
The only remaining untested Candidate in London was Protheus Longbottom, the now-dead daughter of Enid and Algie. After briefly considering paying a visit to Neville, he realised the family connection between them was very slightly too distant for accurate results and he'd have to either visit Augusta or Neville's Parents.
In the cab, Malfoy said, "You're an asshole, you know?"
"But you'll still report it, won't you?" Draco looked unsure. He wasn't yelling anymore.
"What was the bet, exactly?"
Hermione fire-called to tell him to come over for breakfast again the next morning. He repeated his usual efforts to get out of bed and arrived just after 8. The kids would already be up since it was a Wednesday and Ron had to be off to work earlier.
"So I guess we're going to New York," Harry repeated.
"We'll find time. I'll recount my whole week. If not tomorrow then Sunday."
"But I can't get it the first time," the girl said.
"I got one for you, Amber Potalski."
"Oh!" Malfoy shouted, and Harry felt his rushing surge of relief that his careful politeness had finally evaporated. "Well if you don't like what I've been doing, maybe I should change it up a bit!"
Before Harry had moved in, you couldn't see much from the grounds of Grimmauld place. After the war, he had started to feel stifled in the old house and had insisted to Ron and Hermione that fixing up the back garden would help. It had, in a way. He should get Neville over here to check on the plants again soon. The song faded out and another one started up he didn't recognise as well.
"Dinner," he decided finally. "You're buying."
"That's a fairly large part of the business model."
Most men were wearing elaborate outfits of mesh or chains and Harry was pretty sure that's why the officer had stopped him at the door. Was this some sort of BDSM club?
Harry decided to break the silence by asking Malfoy about his job at the bar.
"I'll kill you," Ron mumbled. "You-know-who might not have been able to finish the job but I could do it."
Harry got the impression that Malfoy hadn't told the woman the whole story and that he was relying on something other than tolerance to get the sample. Possibly a memory problem.
They talked about Malfoy's family and the war reparations and how sorry they were to have missed some of the big social events since. When Harry tried to slyly ask why they'd left the country in the first place they just blathered on about needing a fresh start and Malfoy kicked him in the shin.
Luna sat back, looking only mildly disappointed. "Why don't you come take a seat beside me, Ginny? We can talk about the shop some more."
"Yeah but they're not all friendly. I've got one by my work table that's a right arse."
"Draco?" Blazer guy asked. He was still standing somehow and holding his wand at the ready.
The song ended and everyone clapped for the band. Harry took a grandiose bow, despite the applause not being for him and Malfoy dragged him back to the table. Harry looked towards the exit as he was pulled and saw Alicia. She looked close to tears and she slammed the door to the room shut behind her, though Harry couldn't hear it over the new song playing.
"You need to keep them occupied with conversation while I take a look around to get some samples."
"I am now."
Malfoy rolled his eyes, sniffing disdainfully. "Alright then, chop-chop. I need to do my preliminary viewing of the shop so I can make an initial assessment."
"Ha-bloody-ha. Malfoy's going to be so ruddy pleased with himself when he sees it. I told you to hire a professional," he mocked, scoffing and breaking off a bit of crust.
Harry snorted. Right. Only, was he? "Ron, is Malfoy gay? Like actually?"
"Brilliant, could you swab it, I'm a little.." he gestured to his hands where he was mixing a drink.
"You have to use it often on unsuspecting doormen?"
"I never took you for being shy."
"Sorry, sorry," Malfoy said once he'd composed himself, "Harry doesn't drink, of course. How could we forget? Tell me, how do you two know each other?"
"An invitation to the Ministry Valentine's Award Night for me and a plus one."
There was no way to save the situation, even after trying a few less technical moves. Alicia refused to cooperate and when Harry spun her and she fell over his misplaced foot, she got up off the floor and ran from the room.
She relaxed noticeably, and Harry did too. Usually, they started with the other stuff and Hermione would accidentally-on-purpose mention Ron later and pretend she didn't care how he was doing. Their breakup had been messy, and Harry still didn't really know why it'd happened.
Malfoy worked his jaw, and his fingers flexed on the steering wheel again.
"I know what a solicitor is; I'm asking why I need one. The letter didn't mention this."
When he got to Hermione and Ron's flat, they were waiting with breakfast. The kids were still asleep and wouldn't be up until Ron woke them later. This was their system on weekdays, usually minus Harry there with his head between his arms.
"What?"
The door to his office slammed shut behind him and Harry sat back in his chair. It was strange, but he'd been worried Malfoy wouldn't talk to him again after the previous day. Now he knew that there was no getting rid of him, even if he wanted to. He kept rolling the words around in his head, though. After all, when had he ever needed Malfoy for anything?
"You should really dispose of excess product when it's past the expiration date."
f) Lead a calm, normal life
"Shut up. We erm... fuck, I don't know. We're both into blokes!" he said triumphantly.
"And that's that."
"No, just..." he looked around, "transfigure that quill into a stone or something."
Seamus tilted his head to the side and squinted at it, then showed it to Neville, who frowned.
Malfoy's eyes bugged out of his head, a laugh escaping his mouth just briefly. "You're kidding."
Zabini stuck out a hand and, after a moment's hesitation, Harry shook it. He didn't hold much against Zabini, after all. Despite being one of Malfoy's cronies, he'd never done anything all that bad to Harry and his friends, even if he was an arse.
"When you get the science behind it-"
"Nah, I can't stand the stuff."
Suddenly he was rushing towards the ground, bright orange only inches from his face before he was yanked backwards, reeling to catch himself as the sudden action rocked him and whoever saved him back and forth as they fell out into the hallway.
Someday I would like to have
"Since sometime around July of last year."
Harry just gaped at her for a moment, and then he shook himself, an idea springing into his head clear as day.
Harry wondered what Malfoy had been like as a child. Sure, he'd known him at Hogwarts, but like a real, proper child. Around Teddy's age, first starting to have any semblance of a personality. Had he always been so prickly, so severe?
I drink
Verity had a small smile curving her lips when Harry looked at her, but she quickly hid it.
a) multiple times a year, as much time or money as I can
• • •
"Shove off. I mean with what you say. Even when you're trying to be rude or professional, you never hide what you're thinking. I'm just saying I like that about you."
"Er..." Harry wondered who all 'we' was, exactly. "Yeah, yeah come on."
"All right, mate. Give me the questionnaires and I'll go through them."
"Why are you laughing? You're the one who bloody set me up with him. I agreed to take out anyone you sent me."
"Answer the question."
Now was not the time nor the place.
Malfoy didn't say a word, but he flipped Zabini the two-fingered salute and pushed open the courtroom door, waiting for Harry to walk through before he shot two whispered spells over his shoulder.
•  •  •
A creature tha feels threat'ned, Hagrid would have reminded him, doesn' respond well ter sudden movemen'.
"Potter there were 40 people in the room when my father was killed, any one of them could have left DNA behind and the killer might not have. And that idea's stupid regardless."
"There we go. Easy does it."
Malfoy raised an eyebrow at them and asked, "are you guys together?"
Narcissa strode down the hall towards them and offered Draco a flat look. "Darling, I'm a grown woman, I can take care of myself.
"They're all different, though."
. . .
She tilted her head to the side and said. "Martini with a twist."
"The place was made for Slytherins!" Harry protested.
When he looked at Teddy sprawled out across the couch, he was reminded that he was his only family now. Him and Malfoy, who was passed out in a chair across from him.
"When I first opened the case file for the Malfoy Murder Mission, I knew a few things. Number one, there were two samples of DNA from the crime scene and Number two, Narcissa Malfoy had been absent on the night of the murder so there were no witnesses. Then, I learned a few more things. I learned that Narcissa cared for her son more than anyone on the planet and that she'd do anything to keep him safe, even from her husband." He ticked this off as three on his fingers. "I learned that Draco was engaged to Astoria Greengrass after the war and only broke it off because of her health, even though she was the only woman he would have been happy marrying. I learned that he then got engaged to a new woman he'd never met in order to produce an heir upon marriage, an engagement that dissolved with his father's death. I visited Finnley Shaw in New York and learned that he was close with the Malfoy's when they were young, and he wanted to keep the killer's identity from Draco as well. I wrongly assumed this made him the killer. I tested DNA sample after DNA sample that all, yes all, came up negative, and I learned that no matter how pureblooded the pureblood DNA was, it was never as close of a match to Draco's as the original DNA had been. And finally, upon visiting Narcissa, I learned that Draco was right in his estimation about how much she cared for him. She wanted to keep Draco from knowing the identity of his father's killer because it would only hurt him more. Why would this information hurt him? It wouldn't if it weren't for the fact that the killer was-"
"They're hardly my people. Look, Luna's right there and she's certainly one of yours. And you dated Dean."
Daphne softened but shook her head. "It would be too much for her. I'm afraid you'll just have to come back at a better time."
Malfoy laughed and shoved his arm. "You didn't have to embarrass her like that. I saw you dancing with those other women, you weren't terrible."
He shook his head, stopping in his tracks when he made it to the kitchen and saw his housemates there, Ginny perched on one of the countertops, a box of savoury biscuits in her hand, and Ron stirring some eggs around on the hob.
"Maybe. We'll talk first, though."
Harry rolled his eyes and shoved Malfoy with his elbow. "No, you prick. The murderer was pureblood. It's clear from their signature. Anyone with magical parents going back three or more generations is a candidate."
"Shoot."
The next song crackled through the old speakers and Harry had to admit he liked this one better too. Well, admit it privately, at least. I see a red door and I want it painted black...
Sorry, think Gin needs us here. The Firewhiskey wouldn't do him any good, either.
He approached the machine and held out a hand for the hair Malfoy had taken to keeping on his person. Harry wasn't sure he'd want the hair of Voldemort if it existed, but maybe this parent-murderer/child relationship was different.
c) An owl
"That's what I tried to tell her. Granted, it might have been rather hard to hear me as I was two floors away at that point. You wouldn't believe the lack of security in that place."
Harry nodded once and Robards opened the door.
"Basic self-defence, it's mostly muggle, really."
"You're an angel," he said, feeling halfway dead.
"Well, I've got some things in place. Er... plans to put them in place, really."
It was the next day that he decided he needed a break from all the orange. He'd been going at it for hours, casting the spell over and over again, and was putting a strain on his eyes.
"I delivered, didn't I? Despite the fact that it's eight o'clock in the goddamn morning, are you or are you not eating a sausage right now. Is it or is it not on a stick?"
Ron's face was blank and his words, though cutting, came out like he was commenting on nothing more interesting than the weather.
Ron came into the room without waiting, already halfway through his sentence. "Mate, what's this in the Prophet about you and Malfoy?"
When he got there, Draco let him in and led him to his mother with only a, "She thought you'd come by again."
"Have you mentioned any of this to Ron?"
Verity seemed to be fighting a heavily punctuated eye roll, but she eased Elton off her shoulder and into Harry's hands.
"You mean neither is from the killer?"
It was catchy, really, and he found himself bobbing his head to the imaginary beat as he cast rhythmically at the room.
"No Potter-Crazies."
Draco sighed and reached over to scratch Barkley's ears.
"I'll consider every option."
"And why is that? Because a war bonded you together? Because you were in a giant castle away from home for the first time and you had to find some way to not feel lonely?"
He knocked on Draco's door and there was a long pause before he answered. He was fully dressed but his hair was wet and he was drying it with a towel.
"Read through it and take out the ones you don't like."
It was just him and Malfoy then, talking in his gardens about their lives and the war, talking about Malfoy's father. It was them laughing about Malfoy's horrible job and Harry's messy habits, and it was them arguing with each other over every single thing they could without taking it too far.
Once he got it back in his lap, he shook the whole thing and pulled out a card.
e) Cunning
Harry visited Ron and Hermione for dinner on Tuesday night. He was still feeling jet-lagged and this might have made his account of the trip somewhat less coherent than it usually would have been, but they still grilled him on it unreasonably hard.
"Potter."
"Are you suggesting I stay the night?"
"Those were just names, silly. And besides, there are very few witches who want their left nipple to be on fire. At least, none of them have admitted to it."
"It came as a surprise?"
"And," Ron continued, "You have to do that speed dating thing Mione's been talking about. Maybe the questionnaire will help you get rid of people more quickly. That was always your problem, right, judging people in such a short amount of time?"
Quentin's wand gave a spark and he grinned.
"Right."
"We— we can't just give up," he insisted, looking hopelessly between Ron and Ginny, the confidence draining out of him.
Malfoy's eyes were cold, but with his hair all out of place and his chest heaving, he looked the most human Harry'd ever seen him.
Ginny's mouth curved up ever so slightly at the corner. "You're a shite baker."
He cleared his throat. "Er, I take it you and Astoria aren't together, then?"
What would Ron have had him do? Give up talking to one of his best friends until he pulled his head out of his arse and got back together with her?
He got Ron a t-shirt that said "I ❤️ NY," and Rose and Hugo race cars that looked like a Taxi Cab and a Police Car respectively.
He was waiting outside the bar the next day when Malfoy got off work. Harry had checked the times online.
It wasn't much later in the day when she kicked him out. Maybe he should go visit Andromeda. It'd been a while since he'd been over there. He used to go all the time to visit Teddy, but then he'd gone off to Hogwarts and Harry'd started to only stop by every month or so to bring her flowers — Andromeda, of course, though the vendor called them Pieris. That was before her memory started to go as well. Everything from how clean she used to keep the house to what she talked about changed. She still had moments of lucidity, but it was so hard to be around. She'd grown to be like family to him, and he'd already lost enough family.
"I dunno. I guess I'm willing to try anything if it'll lead to some kind of breakthrough."
"To er, to Grimmauld Place."
"First date."
"Oh Finnley, don't get carried away. These boys don't need reminiscing."
She started looking around the stands and then cried out, "Malfoy!" triumphantly.
Teddy was getting ready to graduate and everything felt like it was changing but for once he wasn't scared or holding onto the past.
"I threw him in as the absolute worst. That way, every woman from him on you'd at least give a chance."
Harry closed the call.
She paused, looking at him. "Are you really doing this for Mrs Weasley?"
"How long do you think it takes to shower?"
"Is that a bet?" Lee asked, delighted.
"Go ahead, out with it. What do you think's actually going on here. Therapise me."
"My love life."
"You think it's some type of gesture to initiate a romantic relationship." Harry didn't ask it like a question, it wasn't really.
"Sounds it."
"Cheers," he said.
"You know he likes you, right?"
"And I gather I can't just ask for a replacement."
"Well." Malfoy looked at Harry again, and he realised with a jolt that Malfoy was asking for guidance. That somehow—at least compared to how he felt about the others—Malfoy trusted him.
"Are you sure the bar isn't set too high?"
He pushed himself up onto the sink and through the window, careful to avoid cutting his hand on any glass. At the last moment, he ducked back in to grab a tissue and shoved it in his pocket.
"Is he even gay?"
Harry flopped back in his desk chair and threw the folder on his desk.
c) Someday in the far future
Malfoy snorted. He was clearly drunk at this point. "If it was, then at least I'd have an excuse for feeling like this. At least I'd have an excuse for wanting to get back at whoever did it, rather than thank them for doing us all a favour when they killed him."
"Er... what do I need that for, exactly?"
"What?"
They both turned to him, and Ron looked faintly amused.
"Hmm? Oh, it's an article describing 20 Surefire Ways to Woo Harry Potter. Beats me why they'd need the extra 19 if even one was actually going to work but—"
Malfoy huffed. "Remember when I asked you the question about stealing electricity? Weasley and I have a long-going bet that we know more about muggles than each other. I was trying to win. Apparently, Granger has taught him a few things."
"So they're... they were friends, then?" he asked.
"What about school?"
Something occurred to Harry as they walked up the stairs. "If you knew who I was and if you don't want us to have your DNA, why'd you let us in?"
"I know, I was hoping it'd get you to quit."
"I should probably go now. Lots to do."
Harry groaned, lying back and trying to get swallowed up by the cushy rug he'd bought a week after he'd officially moved into Grimmauld.
"I was organising something to help a friend. I needed to find out who'd been there"
"It's not so much getting people there that's the problem as it is having anything to sell. With both Fred and George gone now, we're at a shortage of ideas."
"Malfoy," he said. While his voice was confident, Harry noticed the way his eyes flicked around the room before he said it, like he was checking to make sure no one else was in there. "But you may call me Draco."
"Bullshit, Potter! Since when have you ever cared about morals?"
"After lunch today I cracked open the old case files. They didn't even check out the scene when your dad died!"
"Oh. I need to talk to your mum."
Malfoy skipped to the next song.
"life-threatening circumstances for which Mr Malfoy is the direct cause; substantial and well-documented proof of assessment bias; or Mr Malfoy's untimely demise, upon which his immortal soul does not remain as a magical portrait, contactable spirit, ghost, or ghost-like being."
"Yes!" Harry said again.
Malfoy cleared his throat, averting his eyes and scanning the room. Harry supposed that was his version of polite.
Harry went to his own bed and collapsed back into it. If it was that obvious to a 15 year old what Harry was thinking, what about everyone else?
Dean and Seamus shared a look and then raised their eyebrows at the other occupants of the table, two of which were being huge gits, not that he was naming any names.
"The numbers are even."
"No form?"
Everything seemed to be going fine otherwise and Harry couldn't have predicted any possible problems. Hell, if all had gone well, he might have even gotten laid that night. That was until halfway through the meal when Maria got a chunk of spinach stuck between her teeth.
"She's too weak to see you."
"Harry? Are you all right?"
"It'll take hours. At least forty, likely more, if you want to do it safely. And you should." Again, he pointed this at Harry, who was honestly quite offended. Of course he would be safe! He might've been sorted into Gryffindor, but that didn't mean he was completely reckless.
"I see."
d) no kids
The man smiled and put his hand on Harry's arm. "Let me buy you a drink."
"Yes, the Prophet loves making me look just like a runway model."
"Waiting downstairs. He was getting restless so I told him to pick the place while he waited for us to get back."
Hermione rolled her eyes and handed him a stack of parchment.
He stacked the photos and forms, reshrunk the box, and handed it to Ron.
Well they were. But that wasn't why he'd called.
He was out the door before Harry had even made it down the steps, but Harry chased him out of the shop and down the street, pushing past witches and wizards in his way.
After he downed it in one sip Malfoy nodded and pushed it aside, grabbing his hand and pulling him to the dance floor.
Neville taught at the school too, and they'd finally reconnected. He and Luna were a package deal now, and Harry found it really nice.
He'd never in his life seen someone look so devastated. Mr Weasley wasn't doing well either, but he was strong for her, and for all of his children.
"Fuck off."
They finally climbed the steps and walked a bit along the balcony until they came to a set of bright orange panels and a blue door reading, 'Messrs. Fred and George Weasley. Incredibly Impressive Upper Management.'
"Er... that's quite alright."
Malfoy tapped the tip of his nose and pointed at Harry. "Got it in one."
"Why not?"
"A professional, Potter! Does that word mean nothing to you?"
"You're next, Gin!" he shouted. She usually preferred a few minutes to compose herself so she could pretend like she hadn't been crying this time, after all.
He kept kissing her and waiting for it to get better. Maybe it did because the next morning he woke up in her bed.
The walk back to Grimmauld place was cold and quiet.
Hugo blinked at him and Harry stole him from Ron's arms and rocked him back and forth a few times before Hermione pointed at his high chair. "He needs to eat even if you don't."
"Not a problem, The Problem with a capital P."
It was 3 a.m. and Harry hadn't warned Malfoy he was coming.
"You really think Wood will let a single quaffle pass him? The man's unstoppable, and I should know."
"I'm 6'7"," the guy he was still pinning mumbled.
The men frowned but Harry didn't care why. There was no use pretending he'd stumbled in here on accident. Malfoy wouldn't buy that anyway.
"I'm sure we have nothing to worry about there."
•  •  •
a) Smart
" 's a shame really." Seamus sighed. "Divorce is so hard on the kids."
Verity raised her eyebrows.
"Teenagers," Harry said and Malfoy agreed. They weren't much better themselves when they were his age.
b) A lot of Harry Potter themed things
"My apologies." She drew out her wand and reparo'd the cup before setting it on the table with shaky hands. "What has he told you? Please spare no detail."
Harry felt a small smile curve his lips.
He walked out, slamming the door behind him.
"You okay, Harry?"
"For the charm," he said slowly, like Harry was a child. "The one you're using to clear the room. What's the incantation?"
Harry grabbed Teddy from their room and lead him to the lobby where they waited for ten minutes before Teddy started to get antsy. It was another ten before Harry got annoyed too.
Draco had already lost one parent. He wasn't going to put the other one away.
"Potter. You're certainly looking worse for the wear."
"I'm not going to see him again."
Jerome looked to Malfoy anxiously and then back to Harry but didn't answer. Luckily for him, Malfoy did.
"You know, you deserve to be Potioneering. I might have taken a peek at your former professor. Severus was well regarded across the entire field."
"Sorry," Harry murmured, but it took him half a minute more to look away.
He wrote to the six candidates asking for a small transfigured object so he could "test the effects of Pure-blooded DNA on magic longevity." Only four responded with an object and two others, both internationally located wizards which explained their absence at the Award Ceremony, opted out.
"I'm not following." Malfoy cleaned out a glass and filled it with beer, handing it to the maybe-6thformer
"I used to work there."
He didn't think it would be a good idea to tell him how much better it looked when it was all wet.
"It'll pick up soon, I'm sure of it."
McGonagall's eyes twinkled. He wondered if that came with the job.
"Ah. Right then." Ron blinked at him, then gave a stiff nod to Hermione and turned out of the room, leaving the paper on the arm of the sofa.
"Yes sir."
Harry stopped to breathe. "You want me to stop?"
Malfoy rolled his eyes, scoffing. "Are you really so completely and utterly—" he cut himself off, and Harry guessed he should consider himself lucky for that.
"So, will you come? I've got Butterbeer or Firewhiskey if you'd like. I mean, you don't have to, or anything. I'm sorry, you shouldn't have to feel like you're obligated, because you're obviously not."
"Oh please, Harry's fine. I care about the charity so I couldn't exactly turn it down."
"Exactly!" Ginny slapped the fork out of Ron's hand so she could steal a bite. "Walburga hasn't threatened him even once since he got here. It goes against tradition."
"Well, that's because you're oblivious. You fancy him, admit it to yourself if you can't admit it to me."
Peter was stalking down the aisles towards him at record speed. Harry grabbed his clock and three it on, making a run for it and taking the file with him. Hopefully, Peter hadn't recognised him.
She was quite willing to talk with Harry about his contributions to the wizarding world, the reason he hadn't worn a glamour this time and the reason she'd agreed to meet them. She kept making suspicious glances at Malfoy and curling her nose when he spoke. She truly was reformed and seeming more and more likely to be the murderer by the minute if you ignored what had happened with the Shaw's.
"Something more impactful," Ginny said. "Something that's really worth it."
Falling asleep wasn't so hard when you did it next to the person you loved.
"He's heard me say it enough by now, it just hasn't stuck with him."
"You are always so kind," Ron murmured.
He stepped back and within seconds Neville was stumbling out of the fireplace, followed closely by Dean, Seamus, and Luna.
"Yeah, I thought so. But do read it over, I've seen newspapers from after you show yourself in public. It's never good."
Fuck he hoped he'd let him.
b) a few times a year, what I can spare
"You're up earlier than usual," Harry pointed out.
"What's this?"
"A ringing endorsement."
"I just have a feeling."
He flipped the machine back on. Without Malfoy in the room, he could test the samples and figure out if Ron had really done it. The door opened again and he turned around, expecting to see Malfoy, hoping he'd realised he'd overreacted too. It was Robards.
Harry'd warned her to be on her best behaviour, but he figured this might be as close to that as she could get.
Malfoy huffed he sat down but he told Harry the basics.
Jerome laughed. "His boss, really."
"Just shut up," Malfoy said and pulled him back into a searching kiss. His mouth was hot and slick and his tongue felt like magic.
"But sir," he put a hand on the man's arm, trying to reason with him, but he was suddenly grabbed from behind by an unknown person who tried to throw him on the ground. He responded instinctively after years of Auror Training and threw the assailant back.
"Muggle-lover, nearly considered a blood-traitor, whatever you want to call it. That's why I suspect he might have done something to my father. His family threatened to disinherit him more than twice a day but here he remains, the only surviving member and in possession of all their inheritance.”
"Her," Draco said.
Ron laughed and shook his head. "Yeah, he's a bit of a ponce about the whole thing."
"We have stuff to do tomorrow. We promised Ron and Mione we'd watch the kids for their date night."
Would you help me? I don't know anything about this rot, and I need at least a dozen new products within the month."
I smoke
He tested Finnley Shaw's first, thinking it highly likely. It came back negative. No need to panic, this wasn't implicating his best friend just yet.
'Daniels, Darth, David, Daxley, Dealby, Point Me!' Harry hadn't spent much time in the stacks but he was pretty sure Point Me would fall under P, right next to Potter. He took the little card out and read it over. 'This is the section organised by last name. If you are looking for (d) Death Eater, check under known associates of (v) Voldemort."
"Can I ask you a question."
Harry could see Malfoy better now. He was wearing a gray waistcoat/jacket set-thingy and matching trousers — muggle clothes, Harry was surprised to see. He had a silver wristwatch on one arm and his hair was gelled back, though not as severely as during their Hogwarts days. He'd heard Hermione and Ginny call men jaw-dropping before but he'd never actually felt his jaw drop when looking at one. He wasn't sure if it was the clothes or the hair, or if it was just the combined effect of seeing them on Malfoy of all people, but jaw-dropping was the perfect word for it.
He still looked unsure.
"Good day, Auror Potter. Make sure this isn't the last time I address you as such."
"All right, Harry?" Luna asked.
open response:
b) Firewhiskey
When Harry walked in, Ron was lying in bed with a pillow over his face, the drapes drawn and the smell of booze thick in the air. From the room next door Harry could hear Balanced on a Broomstick blasting at top volume.
"Working on your unauthorised project, Auror Potter?"
f) Other (please specify)
"That's all different."
Harry rolled his eyes. Malfoy wasn't what it took. It was all the sleep deprivation that was making him so "calm" as Ron put it, and he told him so.
"You said there's DNA? Maybe we can use Avenseguim or-"
Harry ground his hips against Malfoy again and they both moaned.
He was working up the courage to ask when the hell Malfoy had learned to drive when he spoke instead.
Seamus nodded mock seriously while Ginny began slapping Ron on the back, turning his cough-muffled laugh into some actual choking. "She's a genius, isn't she, and I don't think we tell her enough."
"Now."
"I'm doing this for me, then?"
"Potter," said Robards. "You shouldn't be in here and you know it."
Harry looked back to where he'd been seated before and saw a woman leaned back elegantly, a smirk on her cherry-red lips. She had on a pair of sunnies in the same shade, and flaxen blonde curls pinned neatly atop her head.
The sort of Pet I would like to have / do have is
"I'll see you at 10 tomorrow morning for our last day in the city and our meeting with the Gibson's."
The award ceremony really was over. Fuck, he hoped Malfoy had gotten all the samples.
Harry set down beside him and looked at him closely. He seemed pissed off.
They arranged to meet for lunch which would enable them to swab her cup or utensils for saliva. Harry asked how likely it was that Malfoy would be able to convince a professional potioneer that he was qualified for an apprenticeship and Malfoy only scowled at him. The bigger problem though, was that neither one of them wanted to have to split up and they had to make up a lie about why Harry was with him.
"Relaxed. Content. If Malfoy's what it takes for you to seem like you're not half-dead all the time, then Merlin help me, but I'll survive."
It would have shocked younger him to hear those words coming out of Ron's mouth, but now he'd already accepted it. He fancied Malfoy. He really did. He'd gone and cocked up the whole thing, but he fancied him.
"Hi, I'm Jane Cannolen! I'm an Aerospace Engineer, I like surfboarding, and my favourite snack is celery with peanut butter."
d) Fruit Trifle
Before Harry could respond, Alicia was pulling him out to the mostly empty dance floor and putting his arms on her waist. The music was a basic four-step waltz but Harry kept tripping over his own feet. Laughter erupted from the tables nearby.
"You, my friend, are perfect." He spared Elton John a tiny grin.
"Why are you here?"
"And with me?"
"Aw, too bad."
"Shouldn't you be devoting all your time to your vapid fangirl hunt?"
"—to Gringotts Wizarding Bank automatically. Furthermore, in order to ensure proper economic success for the whole of Diagon Alley, unless the owners of the property can prove that the shop is still profitable by December 31st, 1999, it will be foreclosed. The Ministry is happy—"
"Sounds perfect," he said. "Up for it, Potter?"
Harry glamoured himself and then Malfoy made him wait until it was exactly 7 before he could buzz the intercom.
They sat down and Malfoy offered her a smoke. She declined by saying she'd quit many years ago so that was out. She also apparently didn't drink caffeine which was discovered when she asked if Harry wanted a cup of tea but claimed she wouldn't have any herself.
He pulled out the swabs from his pocket and gave them to Malfoy. He had brought 40, just in case there were any mistakes, and gave all but 10 to Malfoy. The rest he would use whenever he saw the opportunity and he had other ways of getting DNA if the suspects weren't drinking.
"Sorry to bother you, but, I have a question."
b) Multiple times a week
They planned to label the samples as well as they could but put numbers on the ones they couldn't identify and use a Pensieve later to clear up any errors.
"I thought you said you were a PU fan." Ginny's eyes weren't on the game anymore, and they hadn't been for a while now. They tracked Lee's movements as he stood up and leaned on the railing.
He arrived at the flower shop and opened the door. The sweet scent filled his nose and overwhelmed his senses. He hadn't been in this shop for a while, but he used to buy lilies here for his mother's grave, and before Andromeda had gotten older and he'd gotten busier, he'd taken her Pieris Japonica, the flowers from the Andromeda shrub. What he was picking up now was Narcissus, the intention of which should be quite clear.
Harry gritted his teeth, annoyed at the expression on Malfoy's face which clearly indicated that he thought Harry was lacking in all forms of intelligence.
Malfoy laughed for real this time. "I suspect not."
"Barkley would eat it."
So did Harry.
Zabini spotted him and clicked closed what looked to be a muggle cellphone, stuffing it into the pocket of his robes. He then smiled in his wide, disarming way, teeth gleamingly white, while straightening up his spine. He was certainly handsome—more so even than he'd been at Hogwarts, with his cool brown skin and high cheekbones causing a stark contrast to his azure attire—and Harry felt himself flush involuntarily.
"Oh Er... abstracting electricity is a crime, sorry. I've heard of that case and the sockets weren't for public use."
Verity didn't make any indication that she recognised him, though it was impossible that she wouldn't have, and he seemed to relax infinitesimally.
Though Harry could no longer hear him, he got to watch as Malfoy's pale face grew redder and redder, making him into a very gratifying shade of scarlet.
Harry nodded, but when he briefly met Malfoy's eyes, he felt more out of his depth than he knew what to do with.
"You take that back, you fucking—"
a) More Harry Potter Paraphernalia than anyone I know
"Oh, I have my ID here somewhere let me just." He patted his pockets but the man stopped him.
He didn't bother checking whose it was because it would take ages to uncover the little plaque sitting on the front, but that didn't matter. Once he got the surface back to normal, there was a product design right in front of him.
He called Malfoy inside and they sat on the couch to drink. Malfoy continued speaking, for whatever reason, and Harry couldn't find it in himself to make him stop.
"Ah, good plan."
They both froze.
"In the flesh."
"Oh I don't think-"
"No, Potter, seeing as this exact spell has never been done before, I'm not actually trained in the art of breaking it."
Harry did know. He could tell by the tone of Ron's voice that Ron knew too. Ron, the pureblood wizard who'd had a grudge against the Malfoy family since before he came to Hogwarts. Ron who would have had access to UnBottled Blood. Ron who was his best friend, sitting right in front of him.
Harry groaned and squirmed around on the bed.
A female trainee in the front row called out, "Smooth," but she and a few others were laughing.
Fortunately, he was used to dealing with public embarrassment and he just flipped her two fingers. Unconventional, but it played out in his favour.
"Why wouldn't I be?"
He really hoped this was worth it. He put it in an envelope and owled it to the Prophet before he could think on it a second more.
"It's tea."
Harry went to bed that night with that face still fresh in his mind, tossing and turning. Ginny's brown eyes welling with tears. It was better than Ron, at least, because most of the time his just looked dull, like there was nothing going on at all.
"We're visiting your mum."
"It was in the Prophet, thank you. Gran got me a subscription a while back."
Malfoy picked up a roll of parchment and scanned it over, his expression illegible. "You've put a lot of effort into this."
She mumbled something else to herself, but when Harry asked, she shrugged it off and started laughing again, so he did too.
"Let me at him!"
"Shove right on off, thanks."
"If you meet the right person, you won't care if they don't check all the boxes in your stupid questionnaire. If you try to compromise what you want to happy with someone who's just okay, though..."
Everything else was much the same, and yet Harry took a moment to get his brain to work, too busy staring at the sharp angles of Malfoy's pressed muggle suit and the way he was staring right back.
"We don't know yet, dear. Eat your breakfast," Hermione said with a pointed look at Ron. Harry figured the kids would have gotten it eventually seeing as they were in the room, but he didn't mention that.
"It's nice," Malfoy finally decided, nodding to himself.
My Hogwarts House was
Harry coughed sharply.
"Pfft. And I'd do it again. One of the things I'm most grateful for in this life is that I don't have to hang onto my past." He paused. "If that's what you want to do, Potter, I won't stop you. It just isn't for me. Goyle was... well, I wouldn't exactly call him a good friend, but he was decent. And he would never have wronged me. I'm glad to know he's alive, but, frankly, that's all I need from him. No more contact necessary. Not everyone is you—not everyone wants to go back to their Hogwarts days."
d) other (please specify)
Harry huffed out a laugh. Wasn't that a thought. He'd been wondering the same thing himself, really, and he still hadn't found an answer. Was he going to sign on with Robards in the spring? Was he going to try for anything at all?
It was clear that the way to pretend it never happened, in this case, was to find more candidates. While waiting for Ron to go through all of the results, Harry got back to working on the Malfoy Murder Mission.
"A new book," said another.
Malfoy nodded and picked at his egg-roll. "She's always been there for me. Wouldn't let me out of her sight after the war."
They'd spent a while drinking as one big group, but then Ginny had pulled Lee up to the bar with her for some food and Ron had followed Astoria when she saw some friends she wanted to talk to.
"Well, that doesn't help at all."
Malfoy helped him pick a scarf for Hermione as well as a photo album that had the New York City skyline across the cover in Red, White, and Blue that he thought was just the right side of tacky.
"Revenge has never-"
"Well," said Verity, "I don't suppose you've seen it before."
"You're sure? Blood was pretty important to your father."
"Help me out here. It's Malfoy? He's why you did all this?"
But he couldn't, could he?
"Right, sorry."
He rang Malfoy at 8:20 a.m. on his way to work and left a message to call him back. There, that was over with.
"It's not too late to tell me to leave," he said.
"You're too charming for your own good. Try turning it off some time just to see what happens."
"Only the special ones."
"Where do you live, anyway? Are we walking or apparating."
They were about four floors up and he really hoped Malfoy had made it out by now.
"Ha ha, very funny."
"All play."
"Hey!" Verity shouted from down below and they both quieted. "Would you two shut it, already? You're scaring away my customers!"
"You traitor!" Ginny turned to Harry. "We only let you sit with us because you promised sausage on a stick. We're not letting you corrupt the group."
Harry said nothing, just stared at his friends in mild horror—wondering if they were going to embarrass him, or if Malfoy was going to embarrass him, or if he was going to embarrass himself, wondering why he cared—until the kettle began to whistle and Ron levitated it away from the stove towards their growing stack of collectables mugs.
"You've got to at least have an idea of who might have done it."
Less than a day after Harry left Ron in possession of the Potter Problem questionnaires, there was a knock on his office door.
Alicia said, "oh yes. Harry and I love dancing."
a) Bertie Botts Every Flavour Bean's
"I work at a Bar too just to make rent. Dealing with the jerks there isn't half as bad as the Ministry."
"What about Malfoy?"
"What the bloody hell are you doing?" Ron muttered.
"This isn't helping."
Daphne didn't seem to think it fit to respond.
"She was just really worried about... you know." Harry wasn't sure he did but he didn't pry. "Any news?"
Harry leaned forward just a breath and froze, waiting. But when their eyes met, the stillness was broken, and Malfoy yanked away from his hand, tearing their gaze.
Malfoy scooted forward and picked up the toy between two fingers with a grimace, throwing it down the end of the hallway. "Fetch, you ridiculous mutt."
"Not really."
He groaned and she pushed his feet off the table again.
c) other (please specify)
"What the fuck."
"Fuck," Malfoy said and Harry nodded.
His father had gotten released from Azkaban thanks to a willingness to report fellow Death Eaters after only serving 3 years of his 10-year sentence. Malfoy had been engaged to Astoria at the time, despite not being in love with her. He did love her dearly as a friend, though, and wanted to marry her. They stayed engaged for two years after his father got out before Malfoy learned that Astoria's mysterious illness wasn't going to get better. He couldn't stand the thought of putting her through childbirth when it would kill her, so he'd called the wedding off as his only real reason for marriage was to produce an heir. He regretted it now because she'd gone on to marry another man who didn't love her and had had a child anyway, taking more energy out of her at the later date than it would have if it'd been Malfoy. He hadn't been back to see Astoria before Harry had gone with him.
The kids nodded eagerly and Harry took out his wand.
"It's late."
"No. Missed you. Want to-" he broke off in a yawn- "talk."
"Come back with me."
Harry turned back to Ron who was raising his eyebrows. What were they talking about again?
"Good, good. Remind me later, I have a question about one of the plants in my garden I think you could answer." Neville nodded and Ron moved to where they were seated with the wine. Alicia pushed away her glass.
Malfoy called back while he was giving a lecture to a group of incoming Aurors. Normally, Harry wouldn't have even brought his phone into work, but he was anxious to get this over with and so he answered, forgetting to take off his Sonorus before he'd already pressed 'accept call.' The trainees could hear his side of the conversation.
"Ah, right. Poor, helpless, six-foot-four Andrew."
"Yeah, the bloody owl was making a racket trying to get this rag in."
My favourite drink is
"Do you still have that list with you?"
They got beer— lemonade for Teddy— and soft pretzels at Yankee Stadium and sat down. Once the game had started, Teddy and Harry had to explain the rules to Malfoy. Teddy was a bigger fan than Harry had realised and he'd apparently spent the year listening to his muggleborn friends talk about it.
It was drawn on a Magi-board—another one of their inventions which allowed two people to write on separate boards while seeing what the other person was doodling—with lots of little labels and, of course, the bloody awful orange stuff.
"Don't be ridiculous. I made friends so I'd have allies."
d) Never, I'm a vegan
"That's where you live?"
"I think I've figured out a way to fix this."
There was a note of humour in his voice that Harry hadn't heard in far too long.
Hermione had prepared notes for him which came in handy considering he hadn't thought to prepare and knew very little about the medical aspect of the topic. Since Hermione was a mind Healer — she'd gotten interested in it after helping to restore her parents' memories after the war — she knew what she was talking about.
"Did the symptoms remind you of anyone?"
d) Hufflepuff
She patted the seat. Harry was on her other side, and Ron was next to him, with Lee taking up the other end.
"Bollocks. You love it here."
No, don't let this magic die
g) other (please specify)
e) A dragon
"Well, it's been an evening," he said.
"They're very handy for chasing away Kelpies," Luna supplied, carefully combing Neville's hair forward with her fingers and then nodding at it, satisfied.
"Erm..."
"What? Put an ad out in the Prophet: Dear reader, did you kill my dad? I'm sure that would work splendidly."
He propped his chin up on his hand shaking his head. "Well, first of all, how the hell are you supposed to talk to someone without seeing them? I mean, at least with the floo I don't have to wonder what they're thinking the entire time. And I have to rehearse over and over before I call so I sound like an even moderately competent professional! I can rewrite an owl as many times as I please. The whole phone thing is a waste of time."
• • •
"Positive."
"I'm not that bad! I'm dateable!"
"Sure. I'll make a reservation for eight." He had agreed to go out with anyone Ron sent him, after all.
"Well nothing, really. It's just that... well, you're the chosen one, aren't you? You could do anything. Be an Auror, a professor... even play for Puddlemere United if you wanted to. Hell, with all the magical energy you've got thrumming through your veins, you could imperius the whole Ministry and make any changes to the Wizarding World that you want."
She shrugged, but it was clear there was something else.
He'd gone through them all and there wasn't a sign of Malfoy. He was almost positive protocol was to file under surname, but he decided to check under L for Lucius, too. And then, when that didn't work, under D for Draco.
"It's now 10:15 am," he said, looking at his watch as he walked, turning back around to scream at them, "which means you're spending valuable business time with the shop still closed!"
"Ah, the famous Harry Potter. I've heard a lot about you."
"Don't let Weasley hear you say that."
Malfoy sniffed, tilting his head consideringly.
He took a deep breath. "The Ministry wants to close Wheezes."
e) I don't enjoy exercising
"Bats have the quaffle — oh, lucky that didn't last long — Wadcock, yes that is her real name ladies and gentlemen, you can trust that I asked, is back in possession — passes it to Bricks — not half as smart as one if you ask me — and the Puddles score!"
"Fuck revenge I don't care about revenge, I want them off the streets, I want my mother to feel safe in her own bloody house!"
The Greengrass sisters lived a few kilometers out of London, within apparating distance, and Harry and Malfoy arrived at promptly 3 for the DNA collection. Harry realised he probably should brief him on the plan before they entered.
He cleared his throat and cast a sonorous.
"Pfft? Don't pfft me. I'm not saying anything that isn't true."
"No, I'm kidding. So what do you like to do?"
Harry shoved a jumper off the couch and threw the pizza on the coffee table. He hadn't changed much about Grimmauld place since he moved in, but the house-elf heads were gone and the couch was much more comfortable than any furniture there'd been previously.
They'd set him up with a nice witch they knew from work, or Ron's fantasy Quidditch league, or that Hermione had met in line at the grocery store and tell her they had the perfect person for her. When that person was Harry Potter, though, it all went south. Even the possibility of finding someone had started to seem like it wasn't worth the effort when it came to the number of leaked interviews to the press and sobbing women on his doorstep when they realised he wasn't going to call back.
"No, I just mean... if you think they're going to scream at you to get out or something, they're not. They aren't like that. Maybe they used to be, but anger just doesn't seem to hold with them anymore. Not since George."
"I'm not gay!"
"You think Muggle-borns and Pure-bloods should live side-by-side harmoniously but a girl has one physical flaw and you-" Here she broke off to start crying.
"Oh."
Malfoy grabbed the empty cup out of his hands and took the other two as well. When he was out of the room, Rosier smiled at Harry.
"And if I win?" Ginny asked.
Harry really wasn't sure. He busied himself with the next test.
A woman approached him at one point and he remembered her name from the list, Amber Potalski. She was a Pure-Blood that had married a Half-Blood and that made her a suspect for the murder of Lucius.
It was Saturday evening and Harry never came into work on Saturday's but at least if they went now, Malfoy wouldn't have to wait any longer to know the truth.
"What are you two on about?"
Malfoy walked back into the room and nodded to Harry. It had worked.
"Not one for crowds?"
He stormed past Harry back the way they'd come, pointing at empty display cases on the top floor. "Bad for business, tacky, loss of revenue, useless!"
"You first," Malfoy said.
When he got to them, he stood regally by the railing for the pitch, his face not betraying anything he was thinking.
e) other (please specify)
"Yes, right here." Malfoy pulled a crumpled bit of parchment out of his robes and handed it to Harry. The list had more than forty people on it!
Orange. Orange everywhere. The desks, the walls, the floors, the ceiling... not a single thing free of the explosively bright colour. It was like he'd never seen orange before that moment, and he'd spent a lot of time in Ron's bedroom during the summers between Hogwart's visits.
Teddy needed to go back to Hogwarts soon, but Harry didn't think it was time just yet. Plus, he'd made other plans.
Ron put his hands up in surrender. "I hear ya mate. It'd be fine if you were, though. You know that, right?
"You know, what we're betting on, what the stakes are. Pretty typical stuff, my friend."
Malfoy, Malfoy, Malfoy.
Malfoy snorted but then replied, "Yeah, right. How about Clos Maggiore?"
"Well that's... that's," he was going to say unfortunate, but he settled on, "Thank you. I didn't mean to—"
"Oh, Gryffindor too?" he asked, shaking it.
"We tested the most probable ones. What are we gonna do, go through every single person who was in the vicinity?"
In the end, she gave him a few spells to try, and he showed up at Wheezes very early the next morning to cast his first modified vanishing charm.
"I'm not gay."
Harry rolled his eyes. Malfoy wasn't wrong. "Still. You could have convinced anyone it's what you're interested in."
"Yes, no, I know you're right. I do. What do you have to do to stop it?"
"Fuck you, Harry!" Ginny shouted back, and he decided that was confirmation enough she was awake.
"So I guess we're going to New York, then," Teddy said, without a hint of enthusiasm.
"I'm going to shower and change," Malfoy said. "You and Teddy should meet me in the lobby in a few for dinner."
"You sound disappointed," she said cheekily.
Chains smiled, "in a few minutes we will be."
"That's the best part," Seamus said, cracking up, "you never do."
"Except bringing a Slytherin to Grimmauld." Ron was eating his eggs straight out of the frying pan with a fork, and he exchanged a knowing glance with Ginny.
Ron slapped his hands over Rose's ears and she giggled. "Mione's already thought it through, mate."
"See, I'm not so sure about the whole adult part."
Lee stared at her, and then he snapped out of his reverie and said, "Whatever the lady wants. If that's seeing me without clothing, well..." Ginny blushed. "Sure I'd prefer other venues, but I have no complaints."
He gave her a tired smile. She was going to make a wonderful Mind Healer, that much he was sure of. He was glad she'd found somewhere to study further and that she was happy, but he missed her terribly.
Malfoy rolled his eyes, but Harry was working up to his point.
"I'll be twenty next year!"
Harry examined the samples again. It didn't make sense. One was clearly Lucius, the blood, but the other was such a small sample, the only read he could get off of it was pureblood, and related to Malfoy. Like that helped. Except maybe it did.
Harry arrived at the bar Malfoy worked at and was told he wouldn't be in that night. Apparently, he only needed three nights a week to supplement his ministry salary and Thursdays weren't one. The barman was friendly enough, so Harry stayed for a pint and reviewed his notes.
"What's the paperweight for?" Malfoy asked.
They both stepped forward so they were out of the way of new arrivers and Harry stuck out his hand for her to shake. "Hi, I'm Harry."
"Well, Pansy's made it practically impossible to get rid of her. Crabbe's..." He cleared his throat like that was all he'd wanted to say, but when he spoke again his voice came out more slowly, pauses where it might have broken if he'd let it. "Goyle doesn't have a permanent address, but I get a postcard every couple of months telling me about his new favourite foreign food or a landmark he found particularly thrilling. Nott still comes around to Blaise's place on occasion, but he was always the quiet type, so there's not much to report on there. And none of us have heard from Millicent in years. Last I knew, she and her parents were holed up somewhere in Scotland, but there've been rumours that she fled the country since then."
"What's wrong?"
Ginny slammed her palm on the table and pointed at Harry. "Yes! There is absolutely no way the Bats lose. In your sad fucking face, Potter!"
"Sorry?" Harry sputtered, choking on a laugh.
"Are we okay?"
d) Never
"Yeah, what's up?"
She blinked at him. "Are you leaving something out or have your accounts suddenly been drained?"
"Hi, I'm Harry Potter. I have a reservation for eight?"
"We got to talking."
"Harry I think if you're having fun, there's no harm in it just, don't let it take over the rest of your life, okay mate?"
The woman was approaching them before Malfoy had a chance to invite her, propping one arm up on Malfoy's shoulder and jutting out her hip. Harry saw the way Ron's eyes trailed up her long legs and felt an irrational pang of concern on Hermione's behalf. It wasn't like they'd promised to one day get back together or anything, but Harry had kind of... assumed that they would.
"I don't know. Maybe it's because he was a death eater, or because we were enemies at school, or even just because we've started to become friends and I like it. I don't want to ruin it."
Zabini sighed once, letting out a puff of air. "I'll be presenting your case. I thought that would be fairly obvious, my apologies."
He accidentally stepped on Malfoy's finger as he got up and apologised quickly at the hiss of pain, backing up all the way to the orange panels outside of Fred and George's office, leaning against them as he stared openly at Malfoy.
"Who's that?"
The next morning they got up early so they'd have time to visit a museum before the baseball game. Harry kept zoning out as Malfoy explained the pieces in that posh accent of his. Teddy nudged him in the side to tell him they were leaving about 3 times before he got his attention.
"Fuck."
"Chin up, mate. It isn't all that hard. I'll send them to you ready to be swept off their feet."
Hermione let out a slow sigh. In the background, he could hear the news, blasting something or other about the Labor Party, and Hermione's mum humming to herself like she always did when she was doing the ironing. She didn't have much of her memory back yet, but she'd nevertheless grown very close to her new British neighbour who invited her to tea twice weekly.
Malfoy fished a pack of cigarettes out of his pocket and offered one to Harry. He shook his head in reply. There was no way Malfoy would have passed the questionnaire, not that it mattered, seeing as he failed to meet even the very first technically unspoken yet distinctly implied criteria: female.
The ball was on a Friday and it started at 7 o'clock. Because of his nervousness, Harry'd spent most of his day at work practicing steps while finishing up his reports. He had to go into the lab at one point to consult on a case about an illegal bonding and the room made him miss the Malfoy Murder Mission. And okay, maybe he missed his almost-friendship with Malfoy himself too.
"It's huge! We can't need more than three bloody pages.
They finished the pizza without any complaints out of Malfoy, though he admitted he'd never actually had it before that night. "What did you think a house-elf would have cooked up something like this? Can you imagine my father phoning a muggle takeaway?"
Looking back at the panels lining the outside wall, he realised that they had once been windows. Even Chudley Cannons would have dismissed this as tasteless.
"If checking all my boxes doesn't make a person my soulmate, what does?"
He was supposed to meet with the Ministry's hack here at half eight. The owl he'd received had instructed him to arrive fifteen minutes early, go down to Level 9, take the stairs to Level 10, and head towards the third courtroom. When he got to his stop, Harry was the only one left on the lift. Everyone else had gotten off a few floors earlier, leaving him to brave the way alone.
Harry's stomach was in knots. What was in the office that she didn't want them to see?
Malfoy half-laughed. "Yeah, I've got one for work, but I get all kinds of nervous trying to use the bloody thing."
"I've got to go, sorry."
"Yes!"
They talked briefly about their respective interests, but when Harry made jokes at his own expense she didn't take it well. So she wasn't one for teasing on a first date, that was no problem.
Malfoy took Alicia's hand and kissed it and Jerome shook it after. "Pleased to meet you, Ms. Baldwin." They smiled hard at each other.
Malfoy just frowned.
Malfoy looked positively horrified.
He cast another Tempus. 8:56
Malfoy almost smiled when he saw Harry seated and took the seat across from him. The food wasn't great, but it was edible. They ordered a round of chips (to share), some type of Eggplant Casserole (vegetarian, for Malfoy), a soup that was mostly just beans and corn (Harry), and Treacle tart (divided and shared). Harry was pretty sure his eyes must have lit up when he saw the Tart on the menu because Malfoy scoffed at him but ordered it anyway. Harry also made sure they both got pints and it all worked well to make Malfoy look less absolutely-fucking-devastated.
Harry looked too and saw Malfoy was missing one of his loafers.
Ginny made a face.
Two days later, Malfoy was knocking at the door to Grimmauld Place. It was past 9 and Harry'd been working out to ease his mind before bed. He opened the door to let Malfoy in.
Malfoy twisted his lips. He was over-thinking this. He coughed and Malfoy rolled his eyes but brought him a beer too and Harry grinned. This was way more fun than at the Leaky.
"Just making an observation, Potter." She gave him another pat on the shoulder and swept out of the hallway into the main room.
It was a simple question, but Harry wasn't sure how to answer. "Fred, Remus, Tonks. Hell, there were so many. More than most people realize."
"After the war.. when there were funerals every other day and people were grieving constantly, I was in the paper a lot for attending funerals. They never wrote about the people who died, just about how brave Harry Potter had shown up to pay respects."
"Be here tomorrow at 9 am, sharp. Don't be late. I haven't ever tolerated lateness from my other clients, and I won't tolerate it from you."
Sighing, Harry put his head in his hands.
"Go through it without putting your trainers on new pine."
Ron shrugged easily and grinned at him. "Still set you up. So, what do you talk about?"
"What would you know about muggles? You told me the other day you'd never had pizza."
"We can't know for sure he did it, yet."
The car jerked a bit but Malfoy quickly righted it, stifling a sharp cough.  "You... you do. Sure."
He was not whinging.
Have some fun with it, she said. How the hell was he supposed to do that?
"Well us you know, your friends, and.. the papers."
e) Driving
"Pardon?"
They all turned around in their seats at the voice, and Lee Jordan laughed delightedly, bounding down the stands towards them.
"No, that won't work. It has to be an object of significance to the person, it can't be dead skin cells or their blood."
"I do, sir. I'm sorry."
He out the paperweight into the machine and waited. This one seemed to take longer than usual. He could feel his palms sweating. The screen flashed the magical composition and he compared it to the one of the killer.
"She was younger than me, of course, but she was always very smart. I'm glad to see Draco's grown up like she wanted. Not like that father of his raised him."
"I didn't say that."
"We should rest. If we don't want to crash at dinner tonight, we need to get on New York time."
"He's not a product, Harry, he's a pet. But yes." She shrugged, the rainbow puffball rising and falling with her shoulders. "It's just a modified Crinus Muto. Fred and George taught me when they were still struggling to breed them fast enough for the demand."
The next morning, Harry let himself pretend he hadn't just made one of the dumbest decisions of his life for exactly three minutes.
"Afraid not."
"And yet you don't act a day over fifteen."
"Hey, that's private!"
He read through, mumbling as he went. "Non-smoker, sure, sure. Non-drinker," he crossed it out. "I don't really care about that, Mione. I drink."
"How so?"
"No, we're discussing how you're too much of a pig-headed—"
Barkley raced after it and Draco stood and grabbed the pizza box, gesturing for Harry to follow him outside into the Garden. The sound followed them out. I see people turn their heads and quickly look away, like a newborn baby it just happens every day
He was humming to himself as the bacon cooked when Ginny finally stumbled in. She was wrapped in her fluffy polka-dotted dressing gown, glare so pronounced he was sure he'd still be feeling it tomorrow.
"Ah."
Malfoy stood and nodded, stalking to the floo and disappearing into it resolutely. It felt too fast, too all-consuming. But the house was finally quiet enough for him to hear everything else.
"I know that." Malfoy looked down at this.
"I've accepted my fate. Why can't you?"
Harry considered her for a second. Hermione had told him that she'd been hired earlier in the year because of her interest in charity. There was no logical reason not to let her keep flirting, so he did.
Why did that make him nervous?
She'd stopped struggling, but she shook her head, Neville finally releasing her.
"AND AS FOR YOU, YOU DODGY, HALF-WITTED, ARSEMONGER — " Lee continued.
"Sure, if I ignored the fact that you're an utter wanker who thinks being gay is the end of the world, won't help me find out who killed my father, and that you've been empty inside so long you've forgotten what it's like to feel anything, then I'd have thought you're fucking perfect."
He left and Harry looked at the paperweight Ron'd transfigured to a chair and back. Harry stuffed it in his pocket.
"Usually when something like this happened, they'd clean it all up by the next day. It was his first time back since... you know... and he spent the entire morning in there alone. Around noon there was this huge boom and we all rushed up the stairs to find him storming out and slamming the door behind him, work-suit completely covered with the stuff."
"Look at that packaging—it's all ripped. And the charms keeping your damn Sticky Trainers sign spinning have worn out ages ago! Do you like it when I'm being a professional, Potter? Because it's in my professional opinion that you should shut down this shop tomorrow if not sooner."
"Mm. Yes, I suppose you could say that. We weren't a warm family or anything, but we were close. My mother in particular made it her business to keep track of every little thing going on in my life. She's still that way, actually."
He must have been done, because Malfoy's mouth snapped shut, and he stormed down the stairs.
They were sitting facing muggle London and with the trees that used to block the way gone, the lights below twinkled like fairies. Harry pulled his jacket tighter around him.
"What?! What is it?" he said.
"Yeah. Yeah, no, I know. Sorry." Harry forced himself to look away. "Do you use phones too?"
a) Shorter than average
"Harry," Ron started, taking his hands and assuming the male dance position despite Harry's complaints, "you'll never learn in 9 days, you're a hopeless case and you always have been." Ron spun him around in a circle and Harry tripped over his foot.
"the time I went to Cancún and almost got fined for underage magic. Who knew their laws were different there?"
"Wicked," the younger one said. Harry smiled at the boy. He reminded him a bit of Fred, without the fiery-orange hair.
Malfoy snorted. "Where's Teddy."
He silently cursed Seamus and dug through the stack for something that would be less mortifying, unearthing one with a Centaur on the front, poised to shoot an arrow, and another that was shaped like Rita Skeeter's grinning head. He wished he'd paid more attention in transfiguration.
When Rosier finally finished his cup, Malfoy offered to take it to the kitchen for him.
"No really, that's-"
"Verity and I are waiting to see if the effects change over time. Fingers crossed we feed one to a canary and it turns into a small person."
"Malfoy wanted to have sex with me."
"Why?"
Everything started when Hermione begged him to speak at the Fight Against War Orphan's Depression auction because she'd overbooked herself. He wasn't against helping out the charity, he'd started it himself — with Hermione of course — but no matter how many times he had to, he still hated public speaking.
"Alicia. You've dressed up. Usually, when there are photos of you scattered about they're.. well." She smiled again.
"Is that an action one?" Seamus asked.
"Alright. I'll trust you."
"Well there's good news and there's bad news."
"Yes, well, I don't have to run my schedule by you now, do I?"
"I know."
There was one more thing that Draco had said was a problem and even though Narcissa had said that Draco would be negatively impacted by the knowledge of who killed his father, Harry couldn't stop himself from wanting to know.
"Hmm, let's see," said Harry. "I could either have you, the man who hates my guts and is probably going to give me a bad review regardless of how well the shop does, or I could have a fan. Now, I'm not usually one to take advantage of fame, but that seems like a pretty easy choice."
"We could put a tracer on."
Perfect, just perfect. There was no way Malfoy wouldn't try to sabotage the shop somehow, but Harry had to find a way to prove it.
Malfoy placed a kiss on each of his knuckles and Harry drew his hand back so he could make him look at him.
Harry thought about what it was for him, warm summer nights playing quidditch at the burrow, Hermione's smile when she looked at her children, Rose's first steps, Malfoy's almost jokes that came more frequently every day, Ron's cheers when he watched the Cannons, Barkley's condescending look when Harry pretended to throw a toy, Hogwarts where he always felt at home, and cast. All around him wands lit up. Across the way, a dragonfly danced out of a wand and circled around his stag. The children on the ground beamed and the sixth year boy responsible for the corporal laughed in delight.
"You're brilliant," Malfoy said.
"Fuck, Potter, what are you doing?"
They said they'd name her Andromeda and call her Andy for short.
Harry laughed and dragged Malfoy outside where they could find a cab. No way were they going to Apparate without Splinching. Flooing, too, was out of the question and not just because of his robe choices. Hermione would have applauded his decisions for once, though she'd left much earlier on to get home in time to tuck the kids into bed.
"No."
"A little too exposed for us."
"Surprisingly."
"I... because I'm... I can't be into Malfoy. I can't. If I'm gay then... then I'll deal with that." He would, he'd find a nice boy and settle down and people would get over it. "But if I'm gay for Malfoy, if I'm gay with Malfoy, that's something else entirely."
"I've been basically living as one for the past 14 years, Potter."
Harry looked down at his hands. There were only two samples left.
Harry shared a grimace with Ginny who graciously stopped flirting with Oliver Wood for a second when she heard that. He decided to use Alicia's introduction as a distraction from all the awkwardness.
She nodded again and cleared her throat, voice coming out even more gargled when she spoke again. "Your inspector will report back to the Council on the date of December 31st, 1999 regarding your success. Due to the nature of your fame, the prominent location of your business, and the necessary preclusion of a biased assessment, the inspector whom the Ministry deems most impartial will be assigned to your case."
She stopped fussing with her cup and son and focused entirely on him. "Harry, if you come out just to court him, and then it doesn't work, or your relationship ends badly, I don't want you to regret doing this. You shouldn't be doing this for him."
"I don't know. The shop was your investment. Maybe a part of you feels like you'll be really losing them if you let it go. And maybe you're tying up your feelings about the war in it all too. I have no idea what I'm saying, really. Don't take it too seriously. I haven't gotten to the Emotional Grievance Over Your Best Friend's Dead Brothers' Shop Foreclosure portion of my studies yet."
"You're kidding."
"How do they work in front of dementors, then? I'd be terrified." a boy, Jacob, he'd told him, said.
They were the rejects, and so was Harry.
Malfoy was in a mood from when the Portkey landed to when they checked into their rooms. Harry and Teddy got a room with two queens and Malfoy got his own space which Harry followed him into once Teddy got settled.
"It's a very hard charm. Most grown wizards can't."
"At a pub? Salazar, that can't be a coincidence."
When he got into the room, he looked at Narcissa and said, "Do you want him to be here for this?"
Malfoy gaped, sputtering. "They're... a very popular band!"
"You okay?"
He scratched at his head, giving Harry a grimace. "Rough luck, mate."
He'd been depressed— not suicidal, never leave your bed depressed, but depressed all the same— and something was finally clicking back into place in his brain. Maybe it would take a while, but now that he knew what the problem was, he could fix it. Probably with lots of therapy and medication. Hermione would help him figure it out.
"No offence, but I do think it would have been favourable to have gotten an answer to your previous question before asking me out."
There were a few tense seconds where she just looked back and forth between him and Malfoy, and then she stepped away from the shelves, leading them towards the grand staircase.
"—to send an inspector around to monitor the shop's proceedings and send back reports on the patronage, net income, and potential for growth. If this letter has been received by mistake, please contact..."
b) Nice
The kids all looked at him sadly and a few were brave enough to come up and say goodbye, even in the presence of their headmistress. Before they all left, Harry made sure to give the sixth year boy who'd gotten the dragonfly and the fourth year girl both congratulations.
He had a point. Harry loved finally feeling like he was at home. He loved teaching kids like the now fifth-year girl he'd learned was called Sam and the boy Brian who'd cast the dragonfly. He loved watching new kids learn and grow and teach each other. His life was finally where he wanted it to be.
"Feelings."
He high-tailed it to the kitchens where Malfoy was busy making the drinks waiters were taking around on trays.
He and Draco joked about maybe adopting another kid. Harry'd always secretly wanted a daughter.
After brunch, they took the Subway, as per Teddy's request, to meet up with a Potioneer who was famous in the States for inventing Hangover Eradicator which was as brutal and effective as it sounded. Malfoy was interested in talking with her because, as he finally admitted, he really had been trying to find an apprenticeship somewhere in the UK without any luck.
"That's all that's important to you? Having allies? Lackeys?"
"What'd you do that for?"
"I saw your statement in the paper. Normally in a situation like this, I'd overlook your recent transgressions as stress, but here you are again."
Harry put out a hand, watching it land on Malfoy's like he wasn't the one controlling it, stilling the anxious movement of his fingers on the mug. Malfoy's head jerked up, eyes meeting Harry's like a cornered animal. How had Hagrid taught them to deal with this again? It was slipping his mind at the moment. Harry tried to steady himself, but all he could do was freeze, hoping he wouldn't scare Malfoy away, wondering how he'd never noticed the soft curve of his ear before, the small scars carved along his neck. Lean in, said a voice in his head. See what they might feel light against your lips.
"Ah the bloody Malfoy thing, you know."
Harry grabbed him by the feet and began pulling. He was used to this, and he knew by now that gentle coaxing, threats, and even the promise of bacon would fail. It was brute force or nothing.
"You really believed I was dumb enough to think I'd get contacted by my past twice in one month with no explanation? A man like me plans for these kinds of things, Harry."
"And every single fucking thing about you annoys me."
"Not too bad, yourself?"
His big breakthrough came the next Tuesday when Harry was finally able to remove enough orange rubbish off the floor to reach one of the desks.
The sound of her laugh echoed strangely against the stone fireplace.
a) A crup
"Ah. You caught me."
Harry sighed. "What do you want?"
"That you should try to contact Goyle."
They were far enough away now that the others probably wouldn't hear them if they spoke, but that also meant that Harry felt compelled to say something to break their silence.
"I've been spending the last 10 years trying to get the Aurors the proper funding. Do you know what a thing like this will do to us if she goes to the press? The ministry will eat me alive, my position as Head Auror will be compromised. Figure out an excuse and we'll see if I won't have to advertise in the Prophet for a new Auror."
Malfoy eyed him critically, lifting off the lid and sniffing it.
a) Butterbeer counts.. right?
Malfoy whined and grabbed Harry's hand, grinding against it. Merlin, Harry felt himself start to lose control.
I already have one or more ▢
When Harry got to Courtroom Three, he paused at the sight of a familiar face. Blaise Zabini. What in Merlin's name was he doing here?
Harry looked around the empty sitting room—the brown sofa Hermione had told him was hideous but was more comfortable than his own mattress, the rows of pictures on the wall that Dennis Creevey had given him after going through Colin's camera, the old rug in the middle of the floor that Harry'd bought because it reminded him of the Gryffindor Common room—what was Malfoy seeing as he took it in? Was he thinking about how Harry was attached to the past again?
"Do you think you could teach us how to do that?" one little girl asked.
"Yeah, I guess since he's never thought of me romantically, he's never held me to the same standards some people do."
"Of course. Now, why did you invite me over?"
Harry rushed to them and pulled Teddy into a hug. He was nearly 15, but he let Harry hold onto him without protest for once.
The last bit wasn't strictly true. He'd realised after coming back from New York that Hermione forcing him to present on depression was her way of getting a point across to him.
"I realised the main problem I was having with this whole thing was thinking like a person instead of thinking like an Auror. I might not be one anymore," he quieted the noises of concern from everyone, "but that doesn't mean I was any less brilliant at my job." Malfoy scoffed at this.
Malfoy was sitting on the sofa when he got back, his hands folded neatly in his lap, eyes landing on Harry immediately as he stepped in.
"I know. But it'd be nice, yeah?"
There was a small smirk on Verity's face, and he took a brief moment to wonder what house she'd been sorted into at Hogwarts. He'd assumed Ravenclaw up to that point but...
"How could you tell?"
Mr. Shaw flicked the main light back on.
"Right."
The way he said it was purposeful and Harry laughed out loud until Malfoy joined him. They laughed until their heads bent together and tears were streaming down their cheeks.
"Malfoy."
"I suppose when you're not getting affection from parents—sorry, shite. I didn't actually mean to sound like an arse there. I was just thinking out loud."
They got to the home of the suspected killer that Saturday afternoon, three days after they went over the evidence. Malfoy had owled the man, a Mr. Joseph Rosier, before they arrived as they were apparently old family friends. Harry didn’t bring up Moody seeing as Malfoy wasn’t his biggest fan.
"Come on, Mione, we're adults. We can handle it."
b) Once or twice a week
"Please, I insist."
"Accompaniment for the evening."
They could only test two at a time so it was slow going but they stopped for breaks every once in a while to eat some of the food. Malfoy had brought fried rice and egg rolls at his request which Malfoy characterised as "terribly pedestrian," but Harry was pretty sure he enjoyed.
So dance "Abstergo!"
When Harry woke up the morning after Hermione begged him to cover her speech, Harry would have rather done anything than get up. He sat there till he was almost late for work before rolling out of bed and throwing on his Auror Uniform.
