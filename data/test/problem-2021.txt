Harry could tell Draco was scowling right now, "The record label decided I would have a larger audience if I told the world I was straight- because they were aiming for the market of females."
Being the tallest, Justin slung his arms over the two Ravenclaws. Like they were childhood friends, they reminisced over the years and the first time they arrived.
"Excellent! we now have our three champions! But in the end only one will go down in history. Only one will hoist this chalice of champions, this vessel of
"I was going to keep Potter as my own, Draco." His snake, sly sound still scared him. "But, with what your family had done to help with my cause, it is only fitting I repay their loyalty ten-fold." A swish of his wand, and Potter was set free. The shackles unclasped on their own, and Potter fell to the floor with a small, pathetic, weak grunt.
"He's incredible, and I'm not revealing his name because, he doesn't want to be in the spotlight." Gasps surrounded the studio at the first pronoun used, nobody expecting Draco Malfoy to be in love with a male.
Putting his trunk up, Harry noticed the boy was already in his Hogwarts uniform, however, it rode up when Malfoy had to go on his tip toes to put the trunk in the compartment. Pulling something out of his pockets, Malfoy put this weird thing over his head and had circular orange things covering his ears.
It was four years later, their second to last year in college, that Draco had finished the rehabilitation programme and had been clean for so long. "Hey." Draco whispered to Harry, holding him closely when he came back from his last session.
“No Harry, I’m sorry. This is a life or death situation, and I just abandoned you.” There was a pause then a whimper. Suddenly, Draco had the blonde clinging tightly to his arms. Nuzzling into Draco’s neck, the boy squeezed the other tightly, to the point he slightly lifted Draco off the ground.
When the food reappeared, Draco looked at it like it was Mount Everest and he had to climb it with no safety equipment. It had been a while since he'd had that much food on his plate. Starting to eat, he firstly cut off a part of the chicken and used his teeth to tug the piece off the fork, sighing at how good it tasted.
thing. Like how some father and sons have fishing, or bird watching, or dare-devil stuff like skydiving, they had basketball. They had always shared basketball.
you been!” Molly shouted, stopping all four boys in their tracks. “No note, car gone!” Fred, George and Ron still held the bread in their hands looking at Molly with wide eyes while Harry stuffed the food in his back pocket, “You could have died! You could have been
Oh, Harry was right: he couldn’t have been more right. The food was delicious to consume with it all melting in his mouth. And the fluffy insides of the potato with the texture you would expect cotton candy to have.
Harry was now on eleven flowers, all with different meanings: red rose (love), apple blossom (trust), acanthus (The Finest of Art), Amaryllis (pride- not just in your potions work), borage (bluntness- which you have a lot of), a white camellia (You're adorable- Draco was tempted to punch him for that one), pink carnation (I'll never forget you- although sweet, Draco did feel the need to gag so he made the motion to Harry who laughed), Coriander (hidden worth- this had Draco blushing every time he looked at Harry that day), edelweiss (devotion- to your family and to your friends), Hyssop (sacrifice), Lily (beauty- Draco thought 'I know I am' in his head until he read the note talking about the inner beauty not outer).
“How do you know my name?” Harry asked, walking cautiously to his bed. He didn’t take his eyes off Dobby either, reaching for the book on his table in case it was needed.
shorts (Draco almost threw up then and there in the shop), but they were very comfortable still. And, underneath those, were some very light pink tights that could be mistaken for beige in dark lighting. His shoes, that he was extremely grateful for, were red Doc Martins and a perfectly matching belt down to the loops that were (finally) shiny black.
However, he soon found out when faced with rows and rows of trays full with food for cooked dinners. The roasts looked coated in honey, making Harry’s mouth water. The golden glow of the Yorkshire puddings, right next to the luscious gravy. Almost a full chicken on the table that looked practically like the meat could fall off the bones. Harry thought that the food may be even better than the food at Hogwarts.
When the music played, Harry assumed he'd be taking the first role as the other boy wasn't even looking at the lyrics- maybe this was a song he already knew. "
“Get ready to face Malfoy mate.” Fred continued and got out of the way so Harry could hold Hedwig’s cage.
Not once has Harry gone on a date, had sex, looked at someone else romantically or sexually, or been himself since that divorce. People would call what Harry did a mid-life crisis, but he calls it the worst mistake he will ever make in his life.
"It's here Hannah. It says 'it is the Victorian flower meaning preference'. So, the person has a preference for only you then." She wriggled her eyebrows which Draco did laugh at.
He turned his head, and the blonde removed Harry’s glasses to place them atop his own platinum head. One arm was thrown over him but Draco didn’t mind. In fact, he looked at Ginny directly to see her with a frown on her face at the display and smirked.
“You will stay at that stove all day and cook for our guests later. Am I clear?” It was Petunia, his aunt, who spoke. Her shrill tone wasn’t surprising to Harry because she’s never spoken to him in any other way.
Finally, the train came to a stop blowing its high-pitched whistle. Everybody scrambled off: everyone in the compartment somehow staying together.
Finally, he also visited Maria and Dean- and obviously the Weasley’s. With Dean he felt a sense of family and familiarity he didn’t know he missed until he had it back. Baking with Dean and his mother, having a water fight in Dean’s back garden, sitting and watching TV like they were a family.
"H-heal me, p-please?" Mumbled Potter as he rested the shirt he had on in his lap, forcing his hands to not cover his body up. Nodding, Draco took his wand, watching the skin reform and the cut disappear like nothing had happened. The whole process took about an hour to do. It was in silence since Potter was reluctant to speak, but it wasn't a thick silence at all.
Draco assumed it was the final day, because twelve flowers make a rose bouquet. There was no note with this, just a two-word piece of paper strapped to the side of a sunset purple orchid. It was definitely a weird looking plant was Draco's conclusion. It had a stem that looked like wood and two flower petals that looked like perfectly semi-circled leaves. 'Gryffindor Table' was what the note read and the girls grabbed onto an arm each, squeezing it tightly.
Out of the shadows, a strange man emerged from the corner. His clothes baggy, hair thin and one eye missing, replaced with one that follows you everywhere. "Bloody hell, it's Mad-eye Moody!" Said Ron.
Draco was walking down a hallway back from the Black Lake when four people came up to him, giving him Narcissus Flowers. By the time he reached the Gryffindor common room, he was one flower short of a bouquet. Finally, he opened the door to see people in a circle, giving Harry room, who was holding the last flower. "Draco Lucius Malfoy," Draco could tell how nervous Harry was, and it was incredibly cute, "Will you go to the ball with me?" He asked and Draco forgot the flowers existed when he dropped the bouquet and launched himself in Harry's arms.
There was no Neville Longbottom to give a pep talk. But, when Harry opened his eyes, he could only roll out of Hagrid's shackled arms when Dolohov yelled "Avada Kadarvra!" From the crowed, hitting Hagrid Square in the chest.
"You forfeit all right to my heart, the place in that bed. You can sleep in your office instead!" That was when Harry realised, it wasn't
“No I am not joking Mister Finch-fletchely." he said, "Though I did hear an excellent one over the summer about a troll, a hag and a leprechaun who all go into a bar -"
"Heaven forbid someone whisper your part of a scheme!" Screaming, Draco noticed the flames in the room becoming more as the letters were pumped into them like a hose for a house fire. "Your enemy whispers so you have to scream!" He yelled once more, so much passion behind it, his heart was attacked by the flames of the fire.
mum." James commenter and Lily hit him with her ringed hand. And she continued to do so until they were both out of the gym.
“Incroyable Zabini. Mon accent fait aussi des merveilles pour moi. Comment allez-vous avec les dames et messieurs?” He smirked as Blaise turned his head to talk with Nott who laughed at Draco’s comment.
"Porcupine!" Exclaimed Draco to Terry, "Mouse!" He hugged Justin just as closely. He had missed them both so deeply over the summer. Since his family had moved to France, Draco wasn't able to travel back and forth as much as he liked. Furthermore, his mother was still trying to get him to go to Beauxbatons. Thankfully, his father was determined for him to stay at Hogwarts arguing 'you wanted him at that school in the first place' and 'he has a life there' and 'he's happy!'
"Also: there was talk of another album circulating, but apparently, you've turned it down?" Harry reached his house but, he stayed seated in the car listening to the radio wasting a lot of diesel as he did- this better be worth the £100 I'll spend later Malfoy Harry mentally scolded.
Shaking, I stood at the top of Malfoy Manor. I had to, there was no other way out, but down. I had to, he had to, he had to.
“Nah, she’s been talking about meeting you all summer.” Brushed off Ron, “You get used to it.” He sighed, putting a carrot or two on his fork.
The flower actually came with about two blossomed, and two still as little buds. Two leaves with zig-zag outlines perfectly moulded the flowers into their pond-flower shape.
Down in the closest, most frequently family-used living room, Draco put on the record-player and snapped his fingers, a House-Elf immediately popping in. "Yes?" The elf said, who was named Acidy-
In the Great Hall, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang had their own seating on wooden benches (which Draco thought the girls would complain about). At the Gryffindor table, Harry and Draco were sat side-by-side with Hermione and Ron opposite them.  "And now the moment you've all been waiting for, the champions selection!" The blue flames grew red and a piece of parchment drifted from the Goblet, "The Durmstrang Champion, Victor Krum!" And nobody was surprised, "The Champion from Beauxbatons is... Fleur Delacour!" Draco cheered loudly for his friend, "The Hogwarts champion... Cedric Diggory." Draco had no clue who that was, but politely clapped still.
. So lost in the moment, Harry only just realised that the blonde was kissing him back just as passionately as he was. About that kiss, Harry loved that Draco put his whole body into it. The blonde grabbed Harry by the waist and behind the neck, moving his head back and forth as they kissed.
"Draco!" He yelled back over the noise and they shook hands. Harry's hands didn't feel anything like the ones that touched him before.
First to arrive was Durmstrang. Their boat emerging from the water, large enough to stretch from one end of the black lake to the other. Their coats were made of fur, looking extremely heavy, but all the boys carrying them like it was as light as the Hogwarts robes.
"Ready, Dragon?" She asked Draco, them both standing a meter or so away from the Black House. It belonged to nobody at the moment. Sirius Black was in jail for murdering the Potter's, Walburger died, Andromeda hasn't been seen in forever, Aunt Bella is in Azkaban (and rightfully so) and Regulus past. The only person eligible to be at the Black residence is Narcissa and Draco Malfoy.
His eyes connected with Harry and for a moment the world stopped. But then he remembered he was supposed to be mad at Harry, and almost all of him still was.
"Well, the Mudblood will be killed. But this one," He started laugh making Draco still like he was playing a game of freeze tag as a four-year-old. But remove the fun. "Will be special, made an example of, shall we say. As for the Weasley, he will go to a reform Centre: for Purebloods who were stirred in the wrong direction by their pathetic, filthy parents."
"There's 'Mione, see ya' mate." Ron clasped him on the shoulders quickly and rushed off to his date with the tail end of his waist coat flapping running to catch up to the girl looking around for him.
Drink in hand Draco clicked his fingers and this boy called Damien handed Harry his own one. Damien walked off, going to the refreshments table to grab another spiked punch for himself. Surprised, Harry's cheeks turned pink at the quick obedience to a small gesture.
"You're actually here." Harry cupped Draco's face, suddenly noticing how un-wrinkled his hands were and he brought one hand to his face to feel no wrinkles there either. He let out a delightful laugh, brining Draco into a kiss that shone golden lines around them.
He opened the folded paper, and a red rose fell from it. His eyes fell to the wonderful flower in his lap. The heavy fragrance wafted in the air around him and Draco couldn't help but take a deep breathe in. It's long, spiky, green stem as fragile as glass. The petals as fragile as broken glass fixed together like puzzle pieces.
People say that was the turning point for the Dark Lord's win. Draco believes it was Dumbledore’s problem.
“No, no-Er, that wasn’t it at all!” Stammered Harry, turning red as he waved his arms in denial, “It’s just, I-uh, don’t like the fame… I just wanted to know if it would be a problem.”
“You hungry?” George asked looking at the stuff Molly prepped for dinner that day. He ripped off bits of bread and threw a piece to Ron, and Fred to Harry.
“Yes they do. I’m sorry if I do not bow down to you, but there’s no need to use your friend to ask such a bigoted question. Your fame does not faze me, as your mother saved the world with her love. I do not mean to offend you with such a statement, only stating the truth. It was not you who rid us of You Know Who, it was Lily Potter- who I am told was a lovely woman.” His formal voice sounded so practiced and robotic. Ron turned red in anger, but Hermione smiled, taking Draco’s side. Meanwhile, Harry was flabbergasted. Never had someone spoken to him in such an even (slightly hurt) manor.
“They believe you put your name in. Why you would do that is definitely not something I could see you doing.” Draco said and Harry waved him over to lie down beside him.
Draco gazed at the Black Lake from the crumbling Bridge. He marvelled in the sunset and the free wind blowing through his hair that needed washing. He felt someone walk up beside him, and Draco put his hand on the person's. They looked out to the Black Lake together, ready to face the next step in grieving, in surviving and- most importantly- in living. They were going to face this together, no matter the lies or distrust they've had together. This was now and that was then.
Although, Hermione was the only one thinking logically, "You could have died! What in Merlin’s name were you thinking Draco Lucius Malfoy!" She scolded, however, she tightly hugged Draco nonetheless.
"Miss Delacour, give the boy a chance to breathe." The tall woman spoke in English, walking up to Draco. He hugged the Headmistress; she patted him on the head.
"Oh I can boost your ego more, if you like." He cleared his throat. "Your eyes are so hypnotic and shine like the moon." He'd heard that before. "Your hair is the brightest blonde ever that I just wanna run my hands through it." And that. "And you're beyond beautiful. I've called girls beautiful before, but you. You are gorgeous." That was new. It was so new that Draco blushed quite profusely.
"We kept it secret, because we knew how everyone would look down at us. That our emotions didn't count, because they would only see the Son of a Death Eater, a Slytherin and the Golden Boy. The world would've disapproved, but you were my world Potter. You were everything I ever had- that the silver lining was golden instead.
"That's it Harr!" His did whooped and Harry brightly smiled at him- they were practically the same height.
"Ok, like this?" Unprepared, James watched as Harry faked left then perfectly sunk a two pointer. Harry smiled. No matter the pressure he felt, he still loved this sport. It was always
The flower was an apple blossom. To the stem was a note, which Su read out loud to him and Abbott before he could see it.
“You will never believe what your sons did this morning.” Commented Molly, dropping the apron she had wrapped around herself. “Your sons flew that car of yours to Surrey and back last night.” Her voice was scrutinising as her harsh gaze looked between the twins and a red Ron.
“Bed- both of you: I’m going to freshen,” Draco commanded. Seeing the state of his best friend, Ron nodded saying a goodnight to Harry and leaving.
"Yes, well, you made that clear when you kissed Weaslette on that staircase." Harry went to talk, but Draco continued, "Or when you didn't grab my hand at the Manor: I was a hand reached away from you Potter... and you just left me there- again!" Harry felt the tears well in his eyes because their failed relationship was his fault, "When I told you I was forced into the mark and you decide to Potter Sempra me! You called me a 'freak of nature', that I 'wasn't human'. That I couldn't have emotions and I will only ever be known as a Death Eater." Draco's hot tears flooded his face but he struggled on anyway, "Do you know how hurt I was? Do you know that Blaise had to sit with me for a week alone in my room because I wouldn't stop crying?"
"Try saying that five times fast?" And Fred and George did, just loud enough for Draco having to stop himself from laughing.
10 minutes later. The wards around the house alert the two that someone had entered. Peeking over her book. Arianna smiled as she quickly put down her book and ran towards the front door.
"Found you," the man said. When he was about to shoot a spell at him, Annie came pulling the man's arm making the hex went to the wall. Punching the man right on his jaw, and pushed him away from Arianna.
"I'm worried that one day she'll kill your cat while doing that," Ashton said to Draco, and Draco silently agrees. He may
"It's from my father, is it?" Arianna asks after hearing Draco stutter, lowering her head for making her mother sad.
"Arianna, my dear granddaughter!" Narcissa cried seeing her granddaughter like this, so does Lucius.
"G'night Uncle Az," Arianna said before coming down from her wolf's back and flop to her bed, bouncing a few times, and then sleep. Verendus comes next, jumping into her bed, circling the other edge, and lay down.
"M... Mommy is hurt, Grandpa! Help! There's someone who wants to hurt us!" Arianna yelled when the door burst open. Now two woman is standing at the door, both of them are pointing their wand at Arianna's face.
Now here she is. Sitting in one of St. Mungo's hospital room where her mother stay. In her hand was a crystal pendulum that her mother always wears she know this pendulum means something to her mother.
"Welcome back Mother!" Arianna reply, taking Cepheus away from her lap. Arianna quickly helps Draco with the bags.
"You take another sandwich off that plate! I'll hex you! Now go to your date with your husband or I have to make you go!!" Draco says. Pushing Aziel to the front door.
"Didn't think this was your scene Malfoy." Potter and Weasley said, coming up behind him being constantly dimmed to then sparkle with light from the dangling beams above them.
Without a second thought, Harry jumped from the opened window to grab tightly on to Ron’s hands. Ron tried hard to haul him up, but Vernon was evidently stronger by the way Ron was half falling out of the window. Next was George, who latched onto Ron’s shoulders. It helped, but Harry was definitely going to fall into the prickly bushes if either let go.
When they made it around the corner so people from the Great Hall couldn’t see, Draco sighed stopping where he was. “Seven hells, she is the definition of annoying.” He leant further into Harry as he sighed again.
. There was no one else of board, so the boat carried on sailing further and further away, getting smaller and smaller as it went.
Leaving the compartment, Harry couldn’t stop the smile on his face and he dreamily sighed when off the train. The birds chirped higher, leaves were a brighter green and the trees danced to the tune of nature. Hermione’s nose was stuck back in the book. She murmured a phrase, but French didn’t sound the same. “What do you make of Draco then?” She asked, snapping Harry from his thoughts, “Ron?” She supplied, suppressing a giggle as she looked at a flustered Harry.
"I suppose, you are wondering why I called you to my office month before our lessons?" Harry didn't verbally reply, but nodded his head and stood in front of the desk. "You need, to make Mister Malfoy fall in love with you, before Christmas break." There a debate, a very long and heated debate (more one sided heated wise), until Dumbledore convinced Harry it was for the Greater Good.
At Hogwarts, Dumbledore, McGonagall and Professor Flitwick stayed at the school together. In his opinion, if Snape was there instead of Dumbledore then he would love it a lot more. Normally, he would be found in the library reading through its extensive collection of books. Some of which he had read previously at the Manor: ‘Defeating The Dark Lord’, ‘Boy Who Lived Biography’, ‘Dark Arts 101’, ‘Secrets to Potions: advanced’, etc.
"She's all yours, mate." He put his hands up. Opposite them, Dean was asleep while Seamus tried throwing Berty Botts into his mouth (five out of ten isn't that bad a score).
They laughed afterwards, in the car. Fred managed to drive them above the clouds and George hit the dashboard in celebration. “We knew something was up when you didn’t owl back.” Ron commented first, still grinning like a Cheshire cat, “I even got an owl from Malfoy, telling me you haven’t sent him a letter.”
“I see. Not to be rude or anything, but this isn’t a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom.” Harry looked over to the door and he knew he was paranoid it would open any minute now.
Terry's skin was darker than his natural mixed colour because he went to Spain for about a month (what you can do in Spain for a month Draco had no clue) and Justin's hair had grown a lot longer so it could now be tied up in a bun. It looked quite good.
It's Gryffindor Draco, and it's a very large stretch considering Dean didn't live in Wiltshire. Please, keep that in mind x
"You're JOKING" Exclaimed Justin from across the hall. He has always been an awkward person with a hidden bubbly and exaggerated personality.
“Oh don’t sound so surprised, you’re here early as well,” he drawled back, and he could tell they were literally biting their tongue to hold back a reply. “I do apologize for last time, the stomach flu isn’t the best way to end a meeting.”
“Are you sorry?” The cafe chair creaked, and he opened his eyes to see Potter staring at him intently, arms resting gently on the table. “Because I don’t think you are. I can think of one- no, two, literally only two good things you’ve ever done in your life, and I can tell you only did them because they’d benefit you too.”
“Brilliant.” The door to the pub swung open, something in Potter’s eyes growing dark when he saw the new person coming in the door, and Draco resisted the urge to spin around and see who it was. “It’s getting a bit late and I’ve got training tomorrow, you alright with heading out now?”
was hearing about the horrors that people - no, that children, had to go through during the war. The only sound is the light scratching of what had to be Rita Skeeter’s Quick-Quotes-Quill against parchment somewhere in the audience section behind him, and he’s staring at the marble floor as if he could force it to open and swallow him whole by sheer will alone. Then someone coughed quietly, Draco isn’t sure where, and it was like a spell had been broken: some members of the audience and the
The owl, a large Great Horned with wide eyes that seemed to see through to his soul, had followed him throughout the house by hopping between windowsills, tapping impatiently on the glass panes of the study. “I’m coming,” he muttered, stuffing the parchment back into the envelope, message facing outwards, and crossed out the
For the first time in a long time, Draco was speechless. “All the stuff you said about my parents, Hermione, Ron and his family, none of us ever did anything to you except exist, which you seemed to take offense at. You called Hermione that vile name, you were always rude to Ron because he wasn’t from the same sort of family as a conceited prick like you, Malfoy you sent a bloody snake at me when we were twelve! You helped Umbridge torture students! I bet you’ve actually been in Neville’s nightmares because of how much of a fucking monster you are, you’re one of the most awful people I’ve ever met, Malfoy, and I do mean that.”
on the front of it. “Here.” He pushed open the window, holding out the letter and flinching a bit as the bird snatched it with its yellowed beak. It seemed to shoot him an impatient glare before gliding away, vanishing into the afternoon sky with a silent, single flap of its wings, and Draco watched it go with only a slight turn of his stomach.
, every possible scenario he had run through was thrown out the window; in fact, the only coherent thought he could form was
, it really wouldn’t have ended well, and I’ve got no idea why he did it but he lied, to everyone. He single-handedly saved my life, and I’ve got no doubt that he’s the reason I’m actually sitting here right now.”
The clock on the mantle showed half-past three in the morning, and yet here he was, still awake. The trial flitted in front of his eyes like a hummingbird, hovering in flashes of color and a frantic pulse before vanishing again. He can still feel the tens of gazes trained on a healing bruise along his jaw from the attack just outside the Ministry, feel the manacles tightening on his wrists as the leader of the
He could feel their eyes looking him over for a few moments, long enough to make him uncomfortable, before they spoke again. “You were afraid to speak in court because of him, isn’t it. You lied to your parents, to Bellatrix, because you lo-”
dissolved into conspiratorial whispers. “No,” he breathed, and the what-ifs ran through his mind faster than anything ever had: they’d question his motives, his reasons for lying to Bellatrix and for saving Potter, for not killing them when he had the chance, for letting them live when their death would have benefitted him so much, then his - his
That was the question, wasn’t it - it wasn’t about whether he did awful things, everyone already knew the answer to that, it was more about whether he felt some remorse about any of them.
” Before it had finished the first word he had to clap his hands over his ears, the sound almost deafening in the small room. He swore the furniture was shaking. “
“Hey Amber, hi, oof, you’re going to squeeze me to death.” Potter sounded a little strangled even as they smiled widely, letting out a relieved sigh as she loosened her hold. The girl was wearing all black, button-up crisp and her apron tied cleanly around her waist. “Sorry it’s been so long, I am working a full-time job now so I can’t just lay about all day. Is it your mum cooking, or is it Amrith’s night?”
“Sort of.” Their words hung in the air, hovering before a breeze whisked them away, and Draco let them sit until they spoke again. “A lot of my actions have gotten people killed. My existence has gotten a lot of people killed, actually.”
and pointedly ignoring the article written about his trial, when the large black-and-grey speckled owl tapped impatiently on the glass of his window with its beak and made him jump. The sound startled him, much more than he’d care to admit, and he turned the envelope over in his hands after taking it from the bird. There was no family crest or identifying image stamped into the wax seal, nothing interesting or different about the parchment, and after gently opening the letter he tossed the owl a treat from the jar on his desk. It took him a few read-throughs to decipher the messy, looping handwriting, and the lines slanted up to the right corner of the scrap of parchment.
”, fingers holding the rim as the water stream flowed from his palm, setting the cup down after it was three-quarters full. Merlin, his hands were shaking enough to splash some of the liquid onto the tabletop. When he raised his head Potter’s eyes flicked over to the auror on Draco’s left, and he waved his free hand in their general direction. “This is Aedan Firethron, he’s with the aurors. I’ve apparently been assigned a guard for the duration of the hearing.”
Aedan quietly slipped into the chair next to him as Potter sat up a little straighter, and Draco could see their eyes beginning to light up with a fire reminiscent of their early days at Hogwarts. His traitorous heart skipped a beat. “Are you sure it was the flu, Malfoy?” they snapped. “Or did you just poison yourself to waste my time?”
Potter seemed to pause for a moment before returning the smile, shoving their hands into the pockets of their robes. “Works for me. I’ve, uhm, I’ve got to get going, auror stuff, but I look forward to hearing that you’re cleared of everything. See you around, Malfoy.”
Potter had left - Draco wasn’t sure when, or how he felt about it, but their chair had been neatly pushed into the table and their funny cup with a lid was gone. Aedan was in the same spot as before, reading through a small black notebook with his brow furrowed, and they looked up as Draco gingerly sat down in the chair next to him. “He had a meeting to attend,” the auror said, nodding at the empty space across the table. “He sends his apologies, and said he’d owl about a better time, after you’re well again.”
; the only things that were different were the lack of Hogwarts aesthetics in the room, his black jumper had replaced his school uniform, and there was no Potter storming in to slice his skin to ribbons and leave him on the floor for dead.
Draco was admittedly curious as well, but he knew her theory wasn’t correct. Potter wasn’t - he wouldn’t do something like this for attention, he hated all the fame he got from something that happened before he was even a toddler.
“Yeah yeah, you’ve already used that line tonight,” she replied impatiently, waving her hand. “Look, Draco I just - I don’t want to watch you get dragged down by his stupid hero antics, alright? I told you a long time ago that this- this
“With you it does.” Ignoring his help she straightened her dress and choker, fluffing out her bangs and hair, nodding towards the muggle in their midst. “What are we doing with him? Can’t just let him go.” At that, the man’s eyes grew wide and he struggled, muffled sounds escaping past the cloth gag, Pansy’s lips curving up into a predatory smile Draco hadn’t seen in a long time. “You know, rivers are running pretty wild this time of year, could make our lives easier.”
She shook one out, mumbling a spell, and the end glowed. “I did, you just drive me up the fucking wall.”  He watched her take a long drag, blowing the smoke out in a hazy cloud reminiscent of what few muggle celebrities he had seen, and she sagged against the bricks opposite him as if all the fight had left her. “Why are you still so stuck on him, Draco? He’s tried to kill you, you’re on complete other sides of the wizarding world in the most literal sense, he doesn’t even pretend to tolerate your company, last I checked. I just - I don’t get it.”
He flinched at the memory of it, closing his eyes to get away from the desperation in hers and opening them quickly when Potter’s dead body appeared in the darkness. “It’s not going to be like that,” he tried, and she rolled her eyes, digging in her small clutch only to pull out a pack of cigarettes he didn’t know she still carried. “I thought you quit.”
“Oh, and a menu. He hasn’t had Indian in years, needs a bit of a refresher on how good it all looks.” Draco looked up in time to see Potter wink up at Amber as he said it and she giggled, lightly swatting their shoulder with her notepad.
“He wants to meet me for dinner next week.” Draco stared down at the cobblestones beneath his feet because he didn’t want to see her mouth press into an irritated line again, brushing some tiny shards of glass from his trousers. “Something about ‘catching up’ like we’re old friends. And, before you say it, the owl was sent this morning. Not a mistake. Seems like he still wants to try being friendly.”
Potter shrugged, and he swore there was a shimmer of light surrounding their head. “I didn’t do much. You - when you’re actually released, free to do whatever, send me an owl and I can buy you a couple drinks. It’ll make us pretty much even.”
“It’s some robes, put them on and pop the hood,” Potter said in an urgent whisper, his eyes still on whoever just walked in. “Quick.”
They only met his gaze for a moment before they shifted it down to their hand, where the concealment charm had been put back in place. “Why didn’t you testify? You did nothing wrong aside from the same stupid stuff me, Ron, and Hermione did, everything was under the threat of death for you or your family. They wouldn’t have found you guilty from that.”
There was no change in Potter’s expression when he brought up Aedan, not that he’d been expecting one, and he stayed standing when the auror took the cup and settled into the chair diagonal to the Boy Who Lived. “He is the easiest assignment I have had in a long time,” they commented, silently mimicking Draco and filling his glass, the water moving much quicker from his hand. “You are Harry Potter, yes? You spoke at Draco’s trial.”
Draco nodded, still keeping his head turned as he looked at the next letter, held by a cross-looking Snowy owl. Even at first glance he could tell this was from Pansy; it had her signature, excessively-looped cursive on the front, and the edges were creased as sharp as a knife blade. He broke the deep purple, stamped seal and pulled out a short yet vaguely threatening invitation to a celebration dinner, her treat, scheduled a few days after his meeting with Potter. Her written goodbye made him roll his eyes, swearing she would give
He scoffed, adopting the smirk that used to feel more like a second skin but now felt unnatural. “I’m flattered that you think I could slip myself a potion that sneakily, but you’re wrong. I was vomiting for the next few hours after our little meeting, Potter, perhaps you’re the one actually trying to get rid of me.”
. Draco hadn’t thought it possible, but he was digging himself into an even deeper hole than before.
“Fuck,” he whispered. His knees shook like they were about to give out from beneath him. Aedan knew, now there was someone else that knew how pathetic he was and they were waiting outside, alone, at a table with Saint Potter. It wasn’t that Draco didn’t trust the auror; they didn’t seem the type to tell his secrets to the world, but the fact that there was a chance that his carefully-made front could come crashing down at the Boy Who Lived’s feet like this - Merlin, it made him want to vomit for real. He very delicately made his way out of the stall, leaning heavily on the bathroom’s walls as he did, and he was very thankful to be alone because when he raised his head to the mirror a choked sob slipped from his throat.
He saw them do a double-take before leaning back in their chair. “You’re early,” Potter said, seeming somewhat confused. Draco noticed they were reading the same book, the title still not appearing familiar, but he watched them put the paperback down without marking their page; that level of attention directed his way sent a warmth flowing through him for a moment.
The Boy Who Lived blinked, sighed, then took a sip from the water glass resting near their hand. In the silence that followed he could feel Aedan’s questioning look directed it at him, and he knew it had to be because the disdain in his voice didn’t match the three years of longing they knew he was hiding. “Hermione and Ron told me this was a bad idea,” they finally said, and the resignation in their tone made his insides twist unpleasantly.
Wearily pushing up on the armrests to stand, Draco nodded at them. “Thank you,” he said quietly, rubbing at the red marks circling his wrists, and he turned towards the exit just in time to see his mother approaching him as Aedan backed away a bit. She looked as distraught as he’d expected, and he avoided her gaze for fear she’d see something reflected in his eyes.
They shrugged and stood, grabbing their jacket and draping it over their left arm. “I’ve said everything that needs to be said.” Draco felt frozen in place, watching as Saviour Potter made their way out of the witness seats and brushed past his chair with a side glance, most likely going to a seat in the back of the audience section. This was the closest they had been since that time in the manor, and the faint smell of their cologne, something warm and familiar, drifted into his lungs and clung to his insides like thorns, making him swallow hard and shift his gaze to the floor again. He wasn’t - he hadn’t been ready for this, to see
Draco delicately separated the cups, keeping his gaze down, shaking his head and holding out one to Aedan. “Water is fine for me, thank you. I’ve been drinking far too much tea lately.” He mumbled an “
Draco silently raised an eyebrow at the obvious affection between the two of them, moving back again to give them some space. A jealous, pathetic side of him wondered if this girl was why Potter and the Weasley girl didn’t work out but he immediately dismissed it; she was far too young, definitely didn’t fit their shoulder-length-hair-older-brothers-always-about-to-cry type of girl the Chosen One always seemed to chase after. He’d know, having spent so many years watching them from afar.
Once they were close enough to start becoming a threat he threw out his free hand towards them with a silent, wandless
The morning after that fiasco of a hearing, Draco received an owl for the first time since the war had ended. He had been sitting at the desk in his room, attempting to read whatever trash they decided was worthy of printing in
“Me?!” they said indignantly, sitting up a little more. “He’s the one that hasn’t picked up the menu because he’s been talking so much!”
“My apologies,” the man said as he sat down carefully, and Draco’s ice-like gaze flicked back up to their face as they took a breath. “I haven’t - I’m afraid I have been terribly rude, let me start over and introduce myself. My name is Aedan Firethron, I am from the- the auror department, with the Ministry of Magic. As you said, the Ministry has been - for lack of a better word, reviewing, your family’s mail, and they found the number of Howlers and threatening messages rather concerning, especially the amount addressed specifically to you, and it was requested that you have a guard because of it.”
“Draco listen to yourself! He’s what you used to be, he’s got all the power and admiration of the whole wizarding world behind him, he’s just leading you on until he gets what he wants!”
A tear openly slid down his cheek before he could stop it and Draco quickly brushed it away, managing to give them a small smile. “Thank you.” If what they were saying was correct, he’d be free: no more threats, no more Ministry around every corner, no more worrying about what would happen to his mother if he’s gone. He’d get the chance to properly grow up, like they said.
“So, you’re right about the fact that he’s been an absolute nightmare for a while now.” He expected it but Potter’s words still hurt like a soft punch to the gut, making him wince silently. “Literally from day one we were sort of at each other’s throats, I was famous because of what happened to me, he was famous because of his family name, and I didn’t know that going in so I didn’t - I wasn’t scared of him for it or something like that, I’m not exactly sure. But. He did save my life, like I’ve emphasized for the past fifteen minutes, and we’re really - really, we’re kind of even, I’ve done some stuff to him too. I - I’ve accidentally used a spell to basically stab him, I’ve left one of his best friends to die in a room of
Ignoring his blush, Draco cleared his throat. He decided not to answer, because in his head Draco thought it would be very rude. (You're always thinking of your next fucktoy and acting like a neanderthal to notice those with actual intelligence.)
“RONALD WEASLEY! If you are not up in the next five minutes, Fred and George will drag you down those stairs!” Molly shouted. In the living room, Percy and Draco were in a deep conversion about the ministry and Harry was sleepily huddled into Draco.
And us doing that, requires trust. The first step to that..." the blonde took the deepest breath ever, "You can roam freely about the Manor, but no going in the East Wing: that place will always and forever be, off limits. And yes, you can go into any room you please. That includes my bedroom, my study, my personal library or even the kitchens." He knew how much Potter enjoyed the company of House Elves, "Now, it's time for you to show you're willing to trust me." Never had Draco said anything so softly to anyone before.
"Just because you want knew shoes and cufflinks." He rolled his eyes at his father's smirk as he bounded off to the hotel room.
Hannah said she wanted to work at an Orphanage for abandoned little witches and wizards, because she knew someone who was orphaned because of the war and took them in.
"Alright, whatever. Well, I'm going back to my hotel room." Laughed the blonde boy, kissing Harry on the cheek and leaving with the jacket still firmly on his slim frame and tall figure.
Soon, Harry was smothered by Draco who squeezed him tightly. “I’m so glad you’re alright.” Whispered Draco, breathing in the comfortable and safe sent of his best friend.
He made his way down the steps, passing Blaise who just stuffed a piece of paper in his pocket. They exchanged a nod in greeting, because Draco saw Blaise’s mother and his sisters (one older, the twins at the age of 9 and a toddler).
“With all respect Professor, I am not sitting in that room pretending everything is sunshine and rainbows while my best friends are Merlin knows where doing merlin knows what!” His tone clipped and sharp, glaring at McGonagall while she glared back. Eventually, the woman gave in leading the first years to the entrance.
“Oi! I’m not that bad!” Harry nudged his right arm hard, close to knocking Draco off his shoulder. Whining, Draco made a noise he wouldn’t admit to later, also brining his head back to Harry’s shoulder that the raven-haired boy couldn’t refuse.
"Yes, but I've got to go- I'll call you when I land." He held the phone closer to his ear to be able to hear them properly.
Harry got a letter from Draco after a few hours. Smaller than he thought it would be, because he could only see about two lines of words, if even that. It was when he opened it he panicked. Sitting at the Weasleys, Harry shot up, jumping to the floo. Hermione and Ron followed without question, Bill, Charlie and Percy coming too.
It's Gryffindor Draco, and it's a very large stretch considering Dean didn't live in Wiltshire. Please, keep that in mind x
"Food it is then: can you walk?" Draco knew Potter was thinking something along the lines of 'im not a child!' Or 'Fuck off, Malfoy!' It was somewhat unnerving to see a nod that didn't even ruffle his ghastly hair.
The month leading to the Tri-Wizard Tournament, Harry and Draco grew very close. Quickly, Harry got over his denial for crushing on Draco Malfoy at the mock-Quidditch game set up by Oliver Wood (Gryffindor Quidditch Captain) and Bradly Summers (Ravenclaw Quidditch Captain). Harry didn't feel like participating after seeing Draco ask Wood if he could play Seeker. It was a month into the school year when it happened- by then, Harry knew he really, really liked Draco but hadn't quite come to terms with it yet.
"Because, Ronald, I want to make them feel welcome!" She hit him lightly on the arm, but looked up from her book for the first time since the morning.
Harry gestured to the seat, “Why don’t you sit down?” Dobby looked at Harry like an angel. His eyed went even wider and his head lifted like he was praying.
It wasn’t long until the invisibility mode stopped working and Ron panicked. He swerved the wheel, took his foot off the pedal and was sure they were seen but that was after the fact. They managed to make it on the rail track, hovering atop the lines wondering where the train was.
She cleared her throat and made Abbott restrain Draco's arm as a joke as the blonde groaned, tossing his head on the table.
"I do, so follow my lead. I'll be the male roll first, then you can try." He said, a sweet smile on his face. The lesson was more fun than an actual lessons. Throughout the hour, the boys laughed and joked while dancing elegantly; Draco even led Harry as the female, even though ne didn't actually mind.
"Because, it's fun to watch people at these after parties." He did a nonchalant hand gesture, "I only wore this pink shirt to show my girlfriend I was gay." Draco did a bad lip reading of Theodore Nott, talking to two sisters in the corner. Openly, Harry laughed. "Seriously though, I'm never going to see half of these delinquents again: all here for nameless faces, pointless cock and conversations." Harry was tempted to point out that Draco was a delinquent for smoking.
Sheepish, Harry hung his head in shame. Draco rolled his eyes, but- of course- Harry didn't see it."
James laughed, "You forgot about the party. Oh, have fun, lad." He patted Harry's shoulder while laughing.
Since his mother had secretly set up a different account and was slowly transferring money into it, Draco didn’t feel anything was much different minus going back to that loveless house his mother tried calling a home.
Surprisingly, it was crowded with people, mostly middle-aged women. There was a line outside of the door, also all women, also all carrying books. The exact same books used for Defence that year too. “It’s a bit crowded in there Arthur; do you think we should look in the normal shop instead?” Asked Molly, keeping Ginny close.
"No, you're sleeping in my room with me-" His cheeks turned bright red at what he insinuated but his voice never lost its controlled tone, "-You will have the bed, and I will sleep on the settee. No arguments, Potter." Looking to the floor, Potter nodded.
By the end of the first task, Draco was the first to tackle Harry in a bone-crushing hug. "Thank you." Harry whispered in Draco's ear, nuzzling into the blonde's shoulder. And the next day, the newspaper was released, titled 'Boy Who Loves?' The main image one of Draco and Harry in an embrace, another of the two cuddled up. A final one, with Draco kissing Harry's cheek. Instead of being annoyed, the two blushed at all the comments people said and at the article in general.
That song had to be his all-time favourite; nothing could change his mind. Dressed in black ripped jeans, Draco tapped his boot-clad heals against the arm of the sofa and rested his old MP3 on his chest that was a black crop-top. It was striped white and black along the arms and in the centre was a detailed skull with a rose being held by its decaying teeth.
"You showed me feelings I've never felt before. As a kid I wasn't shown love, compassion, empathy. You taught me those things Potter. But you also taught me hurt, emotional hurt. That loving someone can be saint-like, but almost as terrifying as knocking on Devil’s door... and he answers. You were my forbidden fruit, but I just couldn't keep away from you.
asked for that divorce. Silent sadness in the night had began to dissipate, and the volcanoes simmered to dormant. He may not be living, but at least he's surviving.
Draco sighed, slipping the jacket over his slim shoulders: his build very slim and some would say feminine. Then, his father walked into the room dressed in one of his finest suites. "She spent an hour sorting through your clothes, we really need to go shopping sometime, Draco."
Draco’s face softened, placing a hand on Harry’s shoulder after faltering because he wondered if he should or not, “Please forgive me in jumping to conclusions: my sincerest apologies Monsieur Harry, Monsieur Ronald.” Harry smiled and looked at Draco’s hand on his shoulder and blushed once more but for a different reason. Quickly, the boy moved his hand back to his side.
The faint noises of the Aurors and the Healers were nothing more than background noise. The man he was holding was captivating every look, every sound of his attention.
"It was because of that album, that I lost the person I love. This song, will be the last song before my break from recording. Music is my passion and I love it, but it isn't worth sacrificing the person I love for." There were multiple awe's from behind the microphones.
"Glad to know you are familiar with your place in society, Potter." Superiority enveloped Draco's personality so well Harry snorted a laugh.
"Oh, my Walkman?" Draco smiled. "It plays music on the cassette in the middle." (Draco opened it up, pulling out the 'cassette') "that then plays through these" (he tapped the headphones with his index finger) "do you... wanna hear?"
“What... who are you?” He edged towards the weird creature, who, on a second glance, looked quite friendly.
"The date night?" She twirled. Harry looked to his dad, smirking at the fact his dad was in trouble. "I don't know what you're smirking about, young man." There was a pause, like something was meant to click in Harry's head but it never did.
As the song processed, so did their confidence. Facing each other, their smiles couldn't be wiped off their faces by anything at all. In that moment, it was just them. And they didn't even need to know each other’s names to be able to look at someone and just
"But seriously, you have an amazing voice. You’re a singer, right?" Harry was very enthusiastic, more so than he was about basketball.
But there was definitely a high level of excitement rippling through everyone on the table (but a few). After all, they are the house of the brave, courageous people. This was their thing! "If the champion chosen isn't from Gryffindor..." Ron shook his head, deciding to not finish his sentence.
“Right dearie, step into the fireplace, throw the powder at the floor, and day Diagon Alley! You have to pronounce it clearly though dear.” Molly instructed and Harry nodded along taking in the information. Just as he reached for the powder, Draco interfered and went before him to show him what and how to do it. And Harry, somehow, messed up saying two simple words of ‘Diagon’ and ‘Alley’ together.
After Draco had died, people began to listen to the blonde. The amount of original potions and methods for them there was in that mansion was impeccable. One that changed the Wizarding World was permanent Wolfsbane that only lost affect during the hours of the full moon. Another was a quicker and cheaper way to make Veritaserum. A final one enabled gay couples to carry children, changing a genders body part depending on their sex so they were able to produce a child without a surrogate.
“Are you a celebrity in the muggle world too, Potter?” The snippy question slipped out before he could stop it, and he flushed as their eyes turned hard. “Sorry. Habit. I... I can’t wait to try it,” Draco corrected, ducking his head and staring down at his feet as they walked down the road. Only a few cars had passed them, probably locals, and he knew that this small village was probably the first time in their life the Boy Who Lived could actually blend into a crowd, whereas Draco’s expensive dark green turtleneck and black blazer would push him outside it. “Anyway.”
that had started filing out of the pews, making their way in their direction. “There is nothing you can possibly say under
“...I don’t understand.” They were staring at him with obvious confusion and Draco’s anxiety skyrocketed further. “I really do think you could’ve said anything, anything that was true no matter how ridiculous it would’ve sounded, and you would’ve been released. Voldemort lived in your house for a while, if that’s not threatening and blackmail I don’t know what would be, what could you possibly say that’s considered oversharing?”
Their emerald eyes moved up to meet his own, and the searching way they gazed at him made Draco want to take a step back. “Yeah - I mean yeah I do. I blacked out for a minute, and then I ended up at this train station, Dumbledore was there, and we talked for a bit, but basically, he told me I had a choice, about coming back or not. I think the - the option I chose is pretty obvious, I came back, it felt like I got run over by the Knight Bus a couple of times but it was better than just staying dead, you know?”
“-and the only thing he said was, ‘I can’t be sure’”. The familiarity of their voice dragged him back to the present and Draco surfaced from the nightmare with a soft, sharp breath in, lifting his head to find Potter’s eyes still trained steadily on him. “That’s it, that’s all he said the whole time me and Ron and Hermione were actually in the manor. By this point we’ve spent nearly a third of our lives dueling and playing each other in Quidditch and taking classes together, he had to have known it was me. If he had just said something like, ‘yeah, that’s - that’s the boy who lived, right there’, his family’s honour and prestige would’ve been returned, he would’ve been Voldemort’s favourite, he’d have been a younger Bellatrix basically, but still all he ever said was ‘I can’t be sure’.”
“He is called Saint Potter for a reason, Pans, he loves to go and save people from themselves.” Watching a happy couple across the room converse quietly, a new-looking diamond ring flashing on the girl’s hand, Draco shifted in his chair to mimic her posture, leaning forward. “He invited me to coffee, during the off days of the trial. Twice.”
“Shit.” She looked at him then back towards the main street, and the shadows on her face looked deeper than before. “Well. I suppose if anyone could confess to a murder and get off, it would be him.”
“Hey,” they repeated, nodding towards the booth bench across the table. They’ve got a bottle of beer open in front of them, some muggle brand most likely, and he slips off his jacket before sitting down. “What do you want to drink? It’s a muggle bar but they’ve got Firewhisky and that sort of thing.”
Their hands, looking much more worn and used than his own, appeared on the table not far from his glass. “After the trial the Minister pulled me to the side and asked for an individual statement.”
“I hate you,” she snapped back, and then she sighed and gave them a tight hug. “Mum misses you, stop by after close sometime so we can all catch up.” Then to Draco’s surprise, Amber pulled him into a hug as well, her head not even reaching his shoulders, and he hesitantly returned it before she stepped back, smile mimicking Potter’s. “It was lovely to meet you, Draco,” she said with a wink before turning away to go back to the kitchens, and his heart skipped a beat because it sounded like she meant it.
“Anyway. You almost got killed?” Draco silently cursed and looked down into his drink, pressing his fingers tighter to the mug, and he could feel the anxiety starting to settle into his bones again. “Hey, Malfoy, what happened? You can’t just say something like that then not explain yourself.”
“No, you’re right, he did, she’s just the reason I was even given a fighting chance. I was more - it was more like giving context, really.” Then Potter glanced in his direction, and Draco hated the way his traitorous heart picked up its pace. “So the Snatchers, after they’d got us all tied up, they’d apparated us to Malfoy Manor. From what I remember it was kind of like Voldemort’s base during the beginning bits of the war, where all the Death Eaters would hold meetings and plan, that sort of thing. Bellatrix Lestrange, she was a lot like Voldemort’s second-in-command, and I think she was Mrs. Malfoy’s sister too, so she was in the manor when the Snatchers brought us in. We got really lucky because Voldemort was out doing something else, so the moment we showed up they called for Bellatrix, and she took one look at me and Ron and Hermione, and even with my face all swollen, she could just tell that we were school age.”
As they paused to take a breath Draco closed his eyes. They were right - he was a bully, riding the high from his family’s wealth and bloodline as an excuse to torment everyone he had ever interacted with. He also would admit to himself, albeit hesitantly, that he hadn’t really changed since his school days. He had grown quieter, but a Ministry-imposed solitude would do that to anyone; his few conversations with Potter, with Aedan, even his own mother, still carried the cruel undertones they always had. Brief flashes of memories came and went, of their second-year duel and bickering in the Forbidden Forest and interrupting the final meeting of Dumbledore’s Army, and the same bit of fear from the hearing started to seep up closer to his chest.
Confusion flicked across their features for an instant before it vanished, and the auror took a deep breath, gazing at the fingers laced together in his lap before looking back up. “Harry Potter himself asked for an audience with the Minister, where he requested a guard for you. He said that he believes the wizarding world is more of a threat to you now more than you ever were to them, and that he’d even pay whatever it would take to assign a decent guard for the length of the trial. I am... I am not from this country, I am here with an exchange program, and the Minister suggested I do it because I did not know anything of the crimes you or your family are accused of.”
Taking another large, desperate sip to stall for time, Draco hesitated. If he hadn’t been drinking, if Potter wasn’t sitting across from him in that damned leather jacket looking as if he had just strolled off the Quidditch pitch, if the lights in the pub hadn’t been so soothing and secretive, he wouldn’t have let the conversation turn to this at all. “I had...” He searched for the right words, and his heart was starting to push violently against his ribcage with every beat. “Ulterior motives, I suppose you could call it, for misidentifying you when the Snatchers brought you in. I knew that after you spoke about that at the trial I would be questioned about my intentions, and I wasn’t prepared to discuss that with the
to remove most of the tea from his sweater. “You just caught me off guard.” He stood up, brushing past her after only the lavender tea’s smell remained on his clothes, eyeing the three owls hesitantly. “What are these all about? None of them look familiar.”
because Draco hadn’t killed the Dark Lord in his sleep like he had been given the chance to so many nights before, and his imagination went into overdrive. Their paling skin, a stark difference from the black ground of the Forbidden Forest, chest still, limbs limp and askew on the floor as blood slowly stopped circulating and that had been so close to being the last way he would see them anymore -
There was a moment of silence, then the witch whose voice he would hear in his sleep tonight started speaking again. “Our next round of questioning will be with the accused, Mister Draco Malfoy, in order to verify Mister Potter’s recounting of events and offer his own explanation for certain situations during the war. Because of his alleged crimes, talent for potion-making, and family history, the
from on their parchment, the robe was drowning in whatever it was Potter had used, and despite a voice in his head telling him he was acting like a schoolgirl, he wanted to bring it back to the manor with him.
“Fine,” he and Potter snapped back in unison, sitting down hard, and he could see Aedan’s eyes narrowing suspiciously.
“Hey, Amber, can I have my regular?” Potter’s moving now, passing him to wander down the aisle, and she’s pulled out a small notepad from her apron. “But with chai instead of tea, it’s a bit chilly out.”
Shaking his head he quickly blinked away any remaining tears and splashed a handful of water on his face, letting out a breath as the tremble in his muscles decreased a bit. After a few more breaths like that the shaking had calmed enough for him to manage to lift his head and stand unsupported, and then he waited until the nausea all but disappeared before moving again.
expected. The next day there’s a second session, and the morning before then I had an auror appear at the manor spouting heroics about how he was my Ministry-assigned guard.”
Draco froze, and he swore that his entire life flashed before his eyes. “I... I was scared of what I would say under
from Hogwarts, he just hadn’t realized it until now, it had taken three years and far too many interactions for it to register.
“Absolutely not.” Potter ducked his hand under hers to shove the bills into the front pocket of her apron, shaking his head, but there was an easy, relaxed upwards curve to their lips. “You keep it. Use it for something good, or else.”
“Great. Okay, well, see you around then.” Harry waved awkwardly before apparating with a quiet pop, and Draco collapsed back down onto the bench, burying his face in his hands. They knew, they had to know what they were doing and it was payback for everything he had done when they were children, this leading him on was intentional and he deserved it and he wanted nothing more than to be reading up on the roof of the Malfoy manor where if he looked over the gutter he could nearly see himself sprawled out on the grass below; certainly that wouldn’t be as painful as whatever game this was that the two of them were playing.
“Many of your former peers have claimed that Mister Malfoy has terrorized you and your friends on many occasions during your time at school, potentially starting the moment you first set foot on Hogwarts grounds. Is there any truth in those claims, Mister Potter?”
“I know.” Draco risked another glance over at them and their face is unreadable, eyes distant as they stared out, and the sun is nearly gone from the sky. “Sometimes I think the living, the surviving of everything - sometimes I think that’s worse.” The words sank into his gut and the memories surface again, this time of icy, pale fingers and the deafening crackling of fire taller than he is, greedily engulfing the very air he needed to breathe, and then they both spun into the crystalline image of Potter’s - Harry’s - dead body in the Forbidden Forest that haunted him endlessly.
Draco waved a hand dismissively, turning back towards his desk and picking up the paper again. “It’s a muggle place, surely it can’t be too dangerous.” And if the mysterious sender really did want to finish him off, he might thank them first.
There was a moment of silence in the room, and Draco felt as if it would smother him. “Mister Potter,” someone said, disrupting the quiet in an irritatingly bright tone, and he recognized the voice with an inward groan. It was the same witch that had been leading most of the trial, and he resisted the urge to roll his eyes as she cleared her throat again. “Do you have any ideas as to why she concealed such... essential information from He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?”
glancing between him and Potter, speaking behind their hands. Head lifting a little more now that he didn’t feel quite as persecuted, his eyes sought out Potter’s emerald ones, again steadily holding their gaze for a few breaths.
the same snark he’d give to Snape? Did he not understand the consequences of this hearing? The witch didn’t seem satisfied with the answer, her smile slipping as she leaned forward in her chair. “I understand your reservations, Mister Potter, but as you said earlier, you have known her son for your nearly ten years of schooling together. He must reflect at least some of her ideals, yes? And I presume you’re familiar enough with Mister Malfoy to take a - a stab in the dark, you might say.”
A wave of quiet laughter traveled around the room, and he could picture Saviour Potter’s stupid, polite smile that Slughorn loved being flashed in the witness box. His eyes followed along a faint, spidering crack in the granite in front of him. “Mrs. Malfoy was told to come and check, to make sure I really was dead, um, and there’s literally no way she missed me breathing. So she kind of - she crouched down, almost like she was hiding me so no one could really see what was happening, and she asked me if Draco was still alive at the castle, and I had just seen him so I told her the truth, I told her yes. Next thing I know she’s up, she’s standing up and still kind of hiding me, and she looked him - she looked Voldemort right in the eyes and told him I was dead, she lied straight to his face. I’m pretty sure that if he had sent anyone, literally anyone else in his little camp thing, to come to check on me or even like double-check her work, I would not be sitting here right now. I bet she would’ve been murdered right after me, actually.”
“Draco?” Aedan’s voice was filled with concern and Draco quickly wiped at his eyes with his sleeve, mouth still burning with the remnants of acid. Of course, of course it was him, his own guardian angel. “Are you okay? You have been gone longer than expected, it’s been nearly fifteen minutes. We got worried.” How had it been so long, it didn’t feel like he’d been breaking down for so long... His heart was pounding hard against his ribs at the threat of being found like this, caught being so pathetic he was sitting on the floor of a muggle bathroom and
Saviour Potter paused to take a deep breath, eyes flicking over again, and this time Draco didn’t bother trying to hide his staring. “Mister and Mrs. Malfoy came running the moment Bellatrix started her screeching about who we might be, and she told them to get Malf- Draco,” they corrected quickly. “So he came into this grand-looking room the Snatchers had apparated us into, and they’ve got Ron and Hermione off to the side, Bellatrix has got this hunch that I’m, well, that I’m Harry Potter, so she’d taken it upon herself to keep track of me. I could barely see anything, I’d shoved my glasses into my pocket just before they’d got us and my face was puffed up enough to force one of my eyes closed, um, but there was a bit where she pushed up my hair, made him look me over, like really look at me-”
- they didn’t like men, didn’t like him, didn’t like war criminals, it would never be anything more than that. Harry’s the one that breaks the stillness after a few minutes, the sky a glowing pink. Somehow the sounds of the city have faded around them. “Have you ever killed anyone, Malfoy?”
Draco held up a hand to stop them, standing up suddenly. “I would like to go home now,” he said stiffly. His head was spinning from the fast movement but he couldn’t stand it, he couldn’t let them finish their thought and feed the false hope that lived inside of him. “Please.”
around the room in an attempt to hide its contents from his mother, not that he expected it to help, and then he took a deep breath before breaking the wax seal.
and be damned to Azkaban for the rest of his life than watch them get hurt anymore, but Potter just sat there, staring out at the mess with only a hint of apprehension on his face. An unrecognizable voice in the audience section behind him was shouting loud enough to nearly drown out the other noise, going on about the real monster in the room.
The morning after his charges were cleared, three things happened all at once. First, his mother officially apparated back to Malfoy Manor with her normal excessive flair and zero warning, trunk landing in the entryway with a loud thud that made him nearly jump out of his skin mid-swallow; second, three different owls came down the unlit fireplace in a loud whoosh, settling onto various perches on chair backs and sculptures around the grand hallway, their large eyes following his every move; and third, through really no fault of his own, he spilled the tea and completely soaked the front of his only maroon-colored jumper.
Everyone was quiet for a moment, the sounds of the other customers and baristas bustling around the shop filling the silence, until Draco decided to speak up. “So,” he started, speaking slowly to give himself time to choose the right words, making sure to keep his tone neutral. “If I may ask, do you remember anything from your most recent interaction with the killing curse?” He expected them to talk about the spell bouncing off, or he dodged it, or it hit some limb and St. Mungo’s had to work some magic on it to make it more normal.
Draco didn’t know what he was expecting to see at the muggle cafe, but when he stepped through the door his eyes were drawn to a secluded table with only one person sitting at it. It took a moment for him to realize what he was even looking at, and when it hit him in the gut like McGonagall’s
Draco was starting to spiral into yet another panic attack, fingers digging into his thighs so hard the muscles in his hands were starting to cramp. Would Potter be able to fight this Ferlet guy off if he did get found out? How stupid would that be, declared free by the Ministry then killed off by one of their employees. He froze when there was a hand threateningly placed on his shoulder, holding his breath, then there was a string of curses coming from the auror and the hand left.
“If it was an invitation from someone that wanted to cause me harm, why would the Ministry actually allow it through?”
The witch smiled again, but this time it never reached her eyes. She looked at her papers and cleared her throat softly before speaking. “Excellent, thank you Mister Potter. During our preliminary discussions, you mentioned that the Malfoy family helped protect you from He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at multiple points throughout the war. One of these times serves as a sort of character testimony, discussing actions of one of his parents, and the other directly involves the actions of Mister Malfoy himself, is that correct?” After a short nod from Potter she continued. “Would you care to tell us about those, maybe starting with the Battle of Hogwarts and the character witness, then moving into the one discussing the Snatchers incident?”
, and they froze, bound and gagged by conjured ropes, and Draco turned his attention back to Pansy. “Do you understand?” he asked even harsher, leaning into his arm more this time, and her grip on him seemed weaker. “Pans-”
Well fuck, now Potter was making him cry, small trembles of shock and relief traveling through his body as a few stray, silent tears slipped down his cheeks, falling onto his fingers that were painfully contorted together. And, despite it all, there was a part of him that wanted to smile when they admitted to not hating him after everything that had happened.
“Perfect, grab me if you need something!” She was immediately waved to another table, hair bouncing behind her as she walked, and the door chimed as another couple came in. “I’ll be with you in one second!” Amber called over her shoulder, bending to listen to the table, and Draco turned his gaze down to the food.
“Well.” They spoke and it pulled him from the small trance he had been in, his eyes refocusing and quickly shifting from their face to the chipped wooden table between them. “Really, I’m here to ask about Hogwarts. You probably won’t give me an answer but I want to try to understand why you were so awful back then, just as some closure for everything.” At their words a chill started to creep into his limbs, the same
- Draco forced the choir of voices ringing in his ears silent even as his chest threatened to close in upon itself. “I will not take the
“I know what I want,” Draco said calmly, and they both looked at him as if he was speaking in tongues. “Lamb biryani and a butter naan please.” He held out the menu and Amber nearly snatched it from his hand, giving Potter a pointed glare.
“Mister Potter, I do have another question for you, something that was brought up to me by some of your former classmates at Hogwarts.” In unison both pairs of eyes flicked over to the witch as she rifled through her stack of parchment, pulling out a sheet from the middle with a wider smile than before, the rest of the room drifting back to silence. The same stroke of concern for his mother’s safety reappeared, this time on his own behalf. “When you announced you were going to be speaking at Mister Malfoy’s trial with the Ministry, some... concerned parties reached out to me on your behalf, in an effort to negate any peace-making attempts you may be attempting. They assured me that they hold no ill will towards you, Mister Potter, or Mister Malfoy, but they wanted to make sure that the
“Boys.” Warned Arthur from the seat of his armchair. They continued their game (games) of exploding snap.
“It makes you uncomfortable? I might die, because you’re no help at all, and you’re complaining that it makes you uncomfortable?” Draco’s face hardened and he packed his bag, “Draco- I didn’t mean-” But he couldn’t finish because Draco was already gone. One week to the task, and Harry drove his only help away. For that time, the blonde hung around with Zabini and Nott- Harry felt incredibly guilty.
The twins had run inside already and had bumped and pushed their way through many people to see what was going on. Standing outside the shop was Maria and Dean who Draco eagerly dragged Harry to; they were still hand-in-hand as Draco was determined to not let Harry go again.
side. Because that's what Draco was now- in a cage; in a rut; whatever you wanted to call it. Several padlocks scattered on the steel door, also being heavily layered with locking charms to keep him from, from breaking beyond repair.
It was them. When he caught Harry’s eye the fury in his gaze made Harry take a step back and Draco thought that was a damn good choice! While Molly was scolding Ron, Draco fumed while Dumbledore, McGonagall and Snape spoke to the two. They spoke on how stupid the boys had been and how to use a thing called common sense. Draco added a comment that they need to be told the definition first getting a small but quick smile from McGonagall and a warm look from Snape.
He told his brain). They found themselves at the fence and they both lent against it, Draco a little further over just so he could lean his head against Harry.
"Right..." Justin wearily said. "If you're done harassing Draco, could you possibly sit in silence?"
His mum and dad knew about the seventeen girlfriends he's had. James pinned it as the 'Potter Charm' and Lily scolded Harry for it, saying he needed to consider others feelings more.
Had it really been six months? Draco didn't know, didn't want to know, didn't care even. Everything so far had been floating endlessly in a limbo of numbness. No pain but no pleasure, no anger but no euphoria. Honestly, it may have been the best he'd felt for a while.
“We’re happy to oblige mum.” Fred said, running up the steps with George just behind him. They heard the tap running and then a scream from the bedroom. Draco prayed that whatever they did didn’t destroy any of his stuff.
"Whenever I had free time, I should've spent it with you, I should've held your hand more and brought you flowers- thank fully I'm making up for that now. My righteous- I know, big word for me-" he smirked in Draco's direction, "thinking caused a good, strong, impeccable man like you to walk out my life." That caused more gasps and talking but their friends quietened them down to listen on, "The mess I made haunts me every time I close my eyes and I thank you for letting me clean up the mess I made.
Harry knew who wrote that article, anyone who knew Draco's best friends (which was very few) would know who wrote that article. Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini had co-written it, just to spite him. Could Harry really blame them? He deserved it.
That was what led the two to stand on the Bridge to Hogwarts. Harry with his head leant on Draco's shoulder, Draco with his head rested on Harry's. During the war, Draco lost his father and his mother killed his Aunt Bellatrix defending Draco.
Sitting in his house with his two sons and two daughters just outside the glass window having a water fight, Harry smiled. "You alright darling?" Asked Draco, bringing in two glasses of fresh Coca-Cola from the fridge. Gently, Draco put down the drinks and sat next to Harry, throwing an arm around his long-term husband so said husband could lean into him.
"Alastor Moody." He viciously wrote on the board before turning to the class full of Gryffindors and Slytherins. "Ministry malcontent. And your new defence against the dark arts teacher. I'm here
Draco chuckled and turned to them, having to tilt his head up a bit to look them in the eye, "I'm here for the drugs, idiot." The other two could understand that: being on the football team gave them many privileges, apparently, one of those privileged allowed them to smoke on school grounds or at school parties.
"Potter, keep your eyes open, yeah?" He tried talking to the man and when Potter wouldn't look at him, he gently tapped his cheeks a few times. "Listen to me, Potter. Say something if you are listening you blubbering idiot." He grunted- that was all Draco could get out of him at the moment. "I need you to take your shirt off, so I can heal you." He added quickly, seeing the panic rise. "Don't worry, I won't do anything you don't want to: I can just heal your face and arms, and then I can run you a bath. No offense, but you do stink." He said as a joke, mumbling to himself he was an idiot for joking right now.
"Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!" Draco repeated, bouncing about the dorm room at six am. He forgot grace all together, due to the fact that Beauxbatons was arriving in four hours! All lessons were cancelled for that day and the next, so the two schools can settle in.
"Well then I am too." Harry surprised Draco by linking their arms together and squishing further in so the length of their arms touched.
anyone possibly listening “I just think you need to know that ah, I’m gay. I don’t want you to feel uncomfortable.” I start to ramble. “If you wanted to get reassigned I’m sure McGonagall would let you-” until Harry stops me mid sentence putting a hand on my knee under the table “thank you for telling me. You should know it doesn’t make me uncomfortable at all. Any one it does is a right git if you ask me.” He tells me grinning ear to ear.
Draco had a long ride ahead of him thinking of catching up on some much needed sleep Draco had barely closed his eyes when his door slid open.
Glancing at Hermione I see her looking out the window lost on some imaginary journey that likely has to do with the book she is clutching.
"It looks as if he has done this before. Surely he can afford new robes for himself. He doesn't seem the time to reuse his old one does he?" Hermione questions. "He has the dark mark. It's likely he hasn't been able to find anyone to let him into their store much less to sell him quality robes." I surmise. Hermione nods her agreement.
Of course, Potter would be returning to Hogwarts for his final year. To finish his education, to see old friends one last time. All noble reasons undoubtedly. Draco cannot help but shake his head and chuckle under his breath. Saint Potter.
Harry comes around to the other side of the snitch facing me. He is concentrating on trying to get the snitch before I do. He is close enough that I can see him subconsciously biting his lip as he goes through his options. My blood sings at the way he looks right now with his hair windblown biting his lip with a blush still covering his cheeks from the chill in the air. He looks as if he has been thrown out into a storm. Or like maybe he was up to something a little more...intimate.
"Good morning to you too." I grumble and with only a small amount of mortification I pull myself closer leaving my head in the soft spot between his neck and shoulder. "Do you want to talk about it?" Harry asks me whispering again into my fine hair and I shiver. I think my heart might very well stop when Harry pulls me closer still. One hand falls to the back of my skull. His fingers run through my hair over my scalp.
Potter thinks on this tapping his finger on a full bottom lip. I release a breath I hadn't realised I was holding. I lift my eyes from his mouth to the rest of his profile. It's not that I ever had time to openly study his features before, but I am suddenly acutely aware of his side profile from my angle beside him, from his brow, to his nose, to the point of his chin. The hair close to falling into his eyes is black as a ravens feathers. The bow of his lips, the slope of his neck are smooth and angular.
"come on, Draco. Stop waiting around and grab your broom." he doesn't give me a chance to reply as he soars in the air making loops and zigzag a. I halt my steps to watch him for a moment while his back is turned. He is a brilliant seeker. He'll he is probably the only seeker that presents a real challenge. With a snort, I throw myself onto my broom and fly up to meet him.
A glance up from my table has me looking in the direction of the Gryffindor table. Staring directly at me Potters green eyes again bore into my own. Smirking I raise an eyebrow nodding my head in the direction or Granger who is still rapidly jabbering in his ear. Potter holds my gase a moment longer a slight smile forming on his own lips before he turn his focus to his friends. I feel my heart rate slow though I hadn't noticed it speeding up. Shaking my I wonder about this new lodging Mcgonagall was talking about.
Laughing, I glance over my should at him from the wardrobe. That's sad, Harry, now when you lose, you won't have the Captin to blame." I tease him. Harry barks a laugh "you wish Draco, just you wait and see." The laughter that escapes me is free and full of light. "I think I'm finally done packing. I'm exhausted. I think I'm going to turn in." I mumble, yawning. Harry nods "yea, I am too. This day has been two days long."
The night has made me bold. I'm about to take a significant risk. I take Harry’s hand and pull him to a sitting position. “It was only a nightmare,” I whisper “your okay now, Harry.” I graze the back of his head.
"What is this Quidditch business you were going on about?" I ask him, but Harry's grin has me shaking my head. "there is no Quidditch business, is there?" and Harry laughs. "you said for me to entertain you. So that's what I'm doing. Let's go before someone catches us." and with that, we silently race for the exit.
"As you know we asked you to come back here if you wished to finish your education because a lot of you never got to take your O.W.L's. With this we have decided that due to your circumstances all 8th years no matter your house will be sharing a new common room we have created from what was previously the room of requirement. We want to expand house friendships. With that said you will share a room in your common area with someone of a different house than your own. I will call off the pairings then you may meet with your roommate at the extra table we have set up for all 8th year's to est breakfast and dinner."
“I don't recall the carriages being so cramped before.” Malfoy chortles and turns to me. “yes, well we were quite a bit shorter then weren't we.”
With a grateful look, I nod my thanks and continue eating my fill. I cannot remember the last time I ate a full dinner was. Harry gives Weasley a scolding look I've never seen before and do not want to be on the receiving end of. Weasleg groans in defeat nods at Harry and looks at me. It's quite comical seeing Harry try to get Weasley and me to talk civilly.
Potter wants to know where Blaize and Pansey are? I cannot decide if he is suspicious of if he truly is only curious. Oddly I cannot bring myself to feel any anger at his bold question.
As we leave our room, Harry is rushed by Granger and Weasley. "let me see your schedule, Ron, and I have quite a few together." but her face soon falls, "ah well, that's too bad, Harry, we only have potions together." then she turns to me "good morning Draco. What classes do you have?" suppressing a smile I hand her mine. "we have potions and arithmancy. I thought I was likely the only one taking that class in our year nobody's mentioned it." she says, chuckling.
I cannot seem to fall asleep. The days events keep replaying in my mind. Instantly my heart starts to race and I glance beside me to the blonde laying in the bed beside mine fast asleep. Draco grumbles in his sleep and throws the cover off of his shoulders. I can see a thin sheen of sweat on his exposed collar bone. Draco whimpers. He tosses around in bed. He starts to yell. I quickly cast a silencing charm on our room to keep the others from hearing. I don't think this is something he would want the others to know about. Even in sleep he is doing his best to muffle his screams.
"well, at least we will be able to bounce our work off one another, eh?" I smirk at her. Granger nods enthusiastically and takes Weasley's hand, telling Harry bye and Heading down to breakfast. "well, let's go get some breakfast." I look at Harry and smirk, "are you always this bossy with your friends, Harry." his answering smirk sends shock waves through my body "you have yet to see how I treat my friends, Draco, sure you can handle it?"
"where are the rest of the family?" Ron shrugs indifferent "gone to make sure Ginny gets a good spot on the train." raising an eyebrow Harry noticed the train had not actually arrived yet but didnt bother to mention this to Ron. Harry doesn't blame them for keeping their distance after his break up with Ginny.
"Look I'm sorry, if you want to ask McGonagall to put you with someone else we can go to her." Potter rambles in my ear as he sits down next to me. Signing I shake my head "It wouldn't do any good I think she planned this if you ask me." Potter raises an brow "what makes you say that?" I don't stop the huff of a laugh from escaping my lips "granger and parkinson, zabini and Beasley, you and I. I honestly think she paired the six of us that fought the most up on purpose."
His words play through my head a second time. His voice so quiet and yet firm is the same as it always was if a bit deeper. The one noticeable difference is the lack of malice in his tone. Ron steps out of his stall mouth once again hanging to the floor. A breathy laugh escapes me before Ron can utter a single syllable. "come on Ron let's get back to Hermione."
I glance at the clock to see there are only 2 minutes left of class. Storing my things away a make for the dining hall. Harry is already sitting with Ron and Hermione when I enter. I take my seat beside him “your mightiness?” I enquire quietly as Hermione and Ron chatter. Harry’s answering smirk sends my heart racing. Theirs a new look in his eyes. A sparkle that wasn’t there before. “What, to much, your highness?”
This chapter took a while and I am sorry but I hope you like it. It's a bit longer than the last but I'm going for a sort of slow burn so stick with me please, thank you!
Struck by a thought I grab a small piece of parchment writing quickly before folding it into a small plane and sending it in the direction of the Gryffindor table.
"I won't pull away not unless you want me too, not until you're ready." I tell him. Draco nods closes his eyes and his body relax slightly. I can feel his minty breath on my skin where his mouth sits just slightly ajar. He pants, taking uneven breaths. "Follow my breathing." I tell him making him meet my eyes again. "That's it." I tell him as he matches our rhythms. Slowly he calms down and I start to release my grip on his head when he lets go of my wrists only to lay his hands over top of my own.
With almost no embarrassment this time I breath a small laugh "No, I would in fact like to stay in this bed all day." Harry's chuckle rumbles in my ear. "I would like that very much, but I am fairly certain Hermione would have my head if I miss class."  Sighing I nod my agreement. Pulling myself up I smile "I have not slept that well in a while." I tell him as I stand up and march for the bathroom. Harry smiles full and bright "I am glad." His smile falters a fraction. "I haven't been sleeping well either. Though I'm sure you already knew that from the night before.
I move to the bathroom to change, leaving Harry to his business. I pull off my clothes swapping them for a pair of silk plaid sleep trousers and a soft grey t-shirt. Slipping out I lift my eyes and see Harry standing by his bed shirtless. Keeping calm I go to turn out the lights. I make my way to bed sliding lightly under the soft bedspread. "good night Draco." Harry mumbles "good night Harry." I whisper back.
I turn off the shower reaching for the closest towel to wrap around my hips and step out. I nearly have a heart attack to find Harry also standing in bathroom lazily brushing his teeth. "I hope you don't mind I heard you turn the shower on and thought I was safe." Lifting the hand I threw to my chest I laugh "you only nearly scared me to death," I come to stand beside him to brush my own teeth. "I thought it was moaning myrtles job to haunt bathrooms." Harry barks a laugh at that and grins at me through his mirror. "Not this bathroom. At least I hope not."
Draco's eyes are shining with unshed tears. He looks at me asking a question with his eyes that I answer with a small smile. Draco and I let go of each other only long enough for him to take my wrists again. I am pulled farther onto his bed. Quietly, though my silencing charm is still holding, I lay down beside him. I reach behind him to the covers he had previously thrown off, my arm hovering over him with our faces only inches apart.
I wake up from fevered dreams of Harry and I that I do not soon want to forget. I think about pulling the dream from my mind to revisit later but decide not to. Something like that can only be lived once.
I know he can probably feel my whole body shaking because he holds the embrace just a little bit tighter, and then we pull away. Shortly after, we're let into class, and I find myself taking the seat just behind him. Harry has the parchment he never got to reply on flat on his desk, scribbling away. Once he has finished, he passes back quickly for me to read.
I glance in Malfoy's direction before flipping it over writing in my own quick text and returning it to sender.
I swear I can still feel my face burning hours later. I haven't blushed like that in...well ever, I think. I just couldn't stop the train of my thoughts when he said that. His pale blonde hair was flying in the wind, untamed by those gels he used to use, and his face had color to it, making him look so much more alive. It had me feeling a particular and surprising way. I've only ever dated women. Then there was my crush on Cho. I mean, of course, I've thought about...that in the general sense, but I've never thought I might experience it. Ron and Hermione always said I was obsessed with Draco, but it was because we hated each other, right? I couldn't have other feelings for him, could I?
I wake up very warm and..., I'm wrapped in someone's arms? I'm in a tight embrace with my face pressed against the soft fabric of a t-shirt. It smells suspiciously of mint. I crack an eye open and look around. My heart rate quickens, and I have to regulate my breathing. Draco Malfoy, the boy who has hated me for all of his life, has me crushed to his chest, sleeping soundly.
The second is Draco Malfoy. He lingers near the closest animal and gently rubs it's skeletal head. With a light hand he brushes his fingers over what could have been it's jaw. I notice his shoulders tense slightly. Without turning Malfoy swiftly lifts himself into the carriage. Before I give myself the chance to better think on my decision I mumble an excuse to my friends and tell them to go on ahead in an already waiting carriage.
Mcgonagall continues unaware of Draco coming to her defense. "with that unfortunate business out of the way I would also like to speak to the 8th years privately about lodging. 1st-7th year please eat and then you are dismissed. I hope you have a wonderful year." The feast appears before us all and everyones voice echo's off the walls as they talk what they did over the rest of their break. A few bolder students even discuss the battle. I'm not particularly hungry but I take a fee things to push around my plate as well as my favorite green apple I will save for later.
Once again, I am surprised by how comfortable I am around them when we are not fighting. "Well, if you ever want a study partner Granger, I'm always available." Weasley, standing beside Granger, visibly stiffens, but she doesn't seem to notice, "I may have to take you up on that Malfoy, thanks!" Potter glances in my direction after Granger turns to Weasley. "I don't think you know what you just asked for, mate." but he smiles and clapping me on the shoulder.
Potter uses Ron back in the doorway. As I turn to step into my own compartment I'm frozen in place by an all too familiar voice.
Many students gasp backing away at the first sight of the decayed creatures. I notice only two farmilar people not shying away from the beasts. The first is Luna Lovegood. She was the one who informed me I had in fact not gone insane the first time I saw them as she can see them too. One can only lay eyes on these winged creatures who have not seen death.
"wondering about anyone of interest are you, Harry?" Ron quizzes me lifting a brow "any special witch we should know about?" he grins menacingly. "Ron, " Hermione gasps "Harry would tell us if he had a girlfriend!" glancing Harry tilts her head curiouly "wouldnt you?"
I have a secret. A secret I usually never let myself think during the day and sometimes during the night, but in a night like this it is pulled to the front of my mind unbidden. I'm hopeless in love with Harry Potter. I try to deny it I tell myself I should sneer and say hateful things. I should want to fight him and get him in trouble, but I don't want to do any of those things.
What have I gotten myself into? I cannot help but ask myself this question as I sit in my dorm during my free period and wait for Draco to get out of his last class. When did he and I become so friendly? We only saw each other for the first time since summer yesterday, yet it feels as if I've known him my whole life. I guess have, though, haven't I? Who's to say our fiery rivalry couldn't just as quickly be an equally as passionate friendship?  I leave our room and sit in the common area on the love seat when a parchment plane lands in my lap.
She forced a smile, glancing down at her parchment stack then back up to Potter, who was still sitting comfortably in the witness area. “Unless you have any other statements to make, Mister Potter, I believe we have all the information we need.”
Potter was silent for a few moments. Draco could feel their gaze shifting to focus on him. “I want to know why you did all that stuff,” they said finally, and the coldness of their voice nearly made him flinch. “No, actually, I want you to wake up and realize how fucking awful you were to everyone that didn’t worship you, that’s really what I want.”
“Didn’t really realize you were so eager to get sent to Azkaban and see your father again,” they replied calmly, looking at him with a curious expression, and Draco’s traitorous heart skipped long enough to make his next breath catch. “Shacklebolt said that unless new evidence comes to light they’ll be releasing you at the next session, free of all charges. Something about expert witness testimony.”
ran a little questionnaire through the Ministry, literally all the aurors want you and your parents in Azkaban. Who really sent the bodyguard, Draco? You can’t be holding out on me, you’ve got to be smarter than that.”
Potter looked like he wanted to protest, then bit his tongue, covering his right hand with his left for a moment, and Draco watched as the skin was revealed without the concealment charm over it. The center of it was scarred, looking like it’s just beginning to fade from a raw, red color to a healing pink, and the longer he stared at it the worse he felt because there was nothing natural about this mark, not about any of their marks. “Merlin’s beard, is that - are those
, there to make a proper first impression. They wanted to meet in three nights, at some pub named The Lion & The Snake in some village just outside London, and the irony of the name wasn't lost on him.
“I think that’s wise. Leaving instead of trying to fight again,” he said softly, and Potter looked uncomfortable. “For Merlin’s sake Potter I’m not calling you a coward, I’m saying you’re only nineteen and already died to end one war, no one would blame you for not wanting to die for a second one.”
So they wanted there to be a next time, despite it all, and something inside him settled with a quiet purr. The inside was surprisingly spacious, a few tables and booths lining the walls, pictures of various plants and landscapes framed around the room, and he awkwardly stepped up to the empty host podium. From what he could see, they were the only people in the restaurant. “Hello?” he hesitantly called, instinctively taking a step back as someone peeked out from a side door where he assumed the kitchens were.
Instantly it flew out of his hands, transforming into a mouth that screamed at him, hovering in line with his shoulders as it spoke. “
He kept his comments about changing the wards to himself, holding the restaurant door open for her with a slight bow, and he silently cast a concealment charm over the blossoming, reddish-purple mark starting to form on her porcelain neck. “Yes, mother.” She didn’t need to look at him in order to give his head a healthy smack with her purse and he winced, smiling despite the new ache in his temple. It felt good - it felt like he was normal again, and he found it easier than expected to push the trial, Potter, all of it out of his mind for the rest of the night.
