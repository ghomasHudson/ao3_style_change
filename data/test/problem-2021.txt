Harry stares at him with such intensity that Draco’s insides begin to tie themselves in knots. All at once, he steps forward, threads his fingers into Draco’s hair and kisses him hard. Startled, Draco freezes, unable to do anything but stand there and be kissed. Harry’s mouth is warm and firm against his, he smells wonderful, he tastes of tea and mint and Draco wants this, he does, but something just doesn’t feel right.
“Well, don’t leave town,” Draco says, and the lightness of his tone makes Harry feel even crosser. “You never did answer my question about the restaurant.”
“Indeed. Happy.”
As Corrie, Danica and Ida do the same, several fine, gold numbers float towards Eilish and tangle in an elegant spell that Harry has never seen before.
“I suppose I’ll have to wait another day,” she says, helping herself to another piece of her father’s specialty dish, pumpkin and pilchard pie.
“Well, that’s what I told her,” Ron says airily, scratching at his nose and doing an excellent job at letting Harry know that he’s lying through his teeth. “You know ’Mione, though… she enjoys it.”
Harry takes an involuntary step back when the drying charm hits him and sneezes violently.
Feeling rather pleased with himself, he pays for it with a handful of coins and then Apparates on the spot back to the kitchen at number twelve, half-eaten sandwich still in hand.
Momentarily intrigued by the latter image, Harry hesitates, but then gives in.
“Some sort of tinctures that Shan and Esmee want to give to their wedding guests,” Draco says, peering into the topmost crate. “I only came down to wait for you but apparently my services are required as a packhorse.”
Five minutes later, they step out onto the ice, Draco gripping Harry’s hand for dear life as they make their first faltering glides. There is a lot of wobbling and not a lot of grace, but Harry doesn’t care; it’s ten o’clock on Christmas Eve and the street is deserted. It’s just him and Draco, the shimmer of colourful lights and a sheet of ice that wants nothing more than to send them crashing into a heap. It’s glorious, and he is exhilarated, pulling Draco along beside him and laughing when he swears and promises vengeance.
Draco smiles and swings onto a roundabout, making Harry grab the seat underneath him.
“Maybe you could diversify,” he says, thinking out loud. “You could sell art supplies. Rose loves all that stuff.”
“Those look like bills to me,” Alison says. “Money stuff, maybe.”
By the time the
Laughter ripples around the room and Harry flushes even harder but he stands his ground, folding his arms and grinning sheepishly and pretending not to notice Draco’s startled expression. Only pretending, though—they both
He doubts Potter will be there, seeing as he’s apparently now a full-time hermit, but he steps into the shop anyway, squinting as his eyes adjust to the dim light after the brightness of the midday sunshine. The next thing that hits him is the smell, a musty, pungent mixture of fur, feathers, mud, sawdust and rotting fruit; the first inhalation makes him screw up his nose in distaste, but after a few slow breaths, the aroma softens and seems to settle around him in a warm fug. The place is much bigger than it looks from the outside, stretching right back from the street in a bulging pear shape, shelves and cages lining every inch of wall and climbing right up to the ceiling.
“I will.”
“When did this happen?” he asks, turning to the old lady. “Did they take anything else?”
“More than I’d like,” Draco mutters, dropping to his knees on the wet path and levering himself under the back of the bus. “I’ve learned to fix most of the things that go wrong, but sometimes…”
“I’m your mother, I just know,” she says, and then turns to him, aghast. “I’m so sorry, Harry. That just came out. I know I’m not your mother.”
At twelve-thirty on Friday afternoon, Draco strides into the Magical Menagerie, ducks the dangling snake and drops a paper bag onto the counter.
“I’ll help,” Harry promises, and not just because Ida’s Christmas biscuits are the best biscuits he has ever eaten.
got one of those,” Harry says, frowning.
Luna sighs and pulls her notebook from her bag, turning to the pages with Harry’s and Draco’s pictures and staring at them. Running her fingers over lines and lines of plotting in purple ink.
?” Deb asks, slamming into the office with a stack of files and staring between Harry and Draco with a look of pure confusion on her face.
With swans and children retrieved from Mrs Purley and everyone warmed from the inside by mugs of hot chocolate, Draco heads back to Sage while Harry and the others make their way to the Burrow. They tumble into the house, windswept and shivering, and are immediately set upon by Molly, who takes away their damp coats and pushes cups of hot apple juice into their hands. Everyone seems to be in high spirits, including Louis, who has been invited back for a second round of Sunday lunch insanity.
Friday morning is cold and frosty with a wind that seems to sweep Diagon Alley clean. Harry strides over the cobbles towards Borteg’s and allows it to blow through him, snatching away his anxiety and suffusing him with a new sense of purpose. Yes, he tells himself, all but flinging his arms out like a mad person, bad things have happened, but today is a day for action. He can feel it, and he is ready to come back strong and set to work. There is no use sitting around feeling betrayed, and there is certainly no time to mope about how he has buggered things up with Draco. Again.
“I’d better go,” Draco says, putting on his coat. “Make sure my mother is behaving herself.”
“We know about men,” Ida says with a rather naughty smile.
“I’m not trying to rescue you,” Harry grinds out. “I’m trying to yell at you, but you keep interrupting me!”
“If you think you look any less ridiculous than me, Harry Potter, you are delusional,” he says crossly, yanking open the door of the cabin and stomping out to William’s battered Land Rover, usual stalking gait hampered by the newness of walking in stiff rubber boots.
The cupcakes are admired at length before anyone actually takes a bite, and then there is silence as everyone chews thoughtfully.
“Very... efficient,” Harry adds, and Draco smiles; he can’t help it.
“What the actual fuck are we going to do?” Harry mumbles.
Fortunately, the weather remains dry and clear, and they are able to finish their work on the garden, tidying up the plots, burning the pruned branches and using tiny touches of magic to make the whole thing look quite beautiful. Inside the cabin, they sweep and scrub and polish, making the sink sparkle and the floorboards gleam in the sunlight. Draco carefully restores the clothes they have borrowed to their original forms and Harry uses his strongest cleaning spells to strip and remake the bed. They shrink and pack away all of the bits and pieces that are special enough to make the return journey with them—pebbles from the loch, an empty bottle of Gertie’s beer, a large cheese from William’s farm, and several other small items, including the trout-shaped tape measure, which Draco insists on having. Harry lets him get on with it. He doubts it will be missed.
The red curtain is open today, and Harry heads through to the front of the bus without losing his balance once. It’s possible that Draco has chosen straighter roads today, but he thinks he might just be getting used to it.
Inside, the wood-panelled hall is bustling with people, some looking for their seats, others handing out paper programmes or chatting animatedly with the parents of their children’s classmates. Every now and then, a teacher with bauble earrings or tinsel in their hair pops their head through the curtains and looks around, and at the side of the stage, an elderly lady is playing carols on the piano. The distinctive smell of school floods Harry’s senses and surrounds him in a bubble of nostalgia that is almost potent enough to make him long for his school days.
Harry looks over to where Rose is chattering away to her dad and paying no attention to them.
Luna looks up. “Casanova. Not Neville.”
“Molly, I have no idea what to say to that,” Harry admits. “The thing is, I didn’t come here to talk to you about Draco. Well… I did, but not in that way. Oh, god, do you mind if I go back outside and come in again?”
There is a sigh of collective disappointment from the group. The charter, drawn up by the merchants of Diagon Alley in the eighth century, is serious business and absolutely not to be trifled with.
“Isn’t this still your time?” Pansy asks, stifling a yawn as she glances at the clock above her head.
“I’d ask what I’ve walked into but this seems about right,” he says, slamming the back door behind him. He grins at his mother. “Sorry I’m late, Mum, has the stress sent you over the edge?”
“He is my swan and we are both doing our best,” he says, expression daring any of them to disagree.
“I’m good,” he insists. “You get back to your starving customers.”
“I take it that you three do not want your ice cream, then?” someone says, emerging from the dark hallway and into the bright sunshine that bathes the tiled entrance hall. “Hello, Luna.”
“This one, obviously,” Harry says, pulling up the other chair and uncapping a pen. He adds a red cross to the section of the map representing Mr Jennings’s shop. “So… a third crime scene.”
“If you insist,” Draco says, and Harry can hear the smile in his voice.
“When have I ever forgotten Ida?” he demands, looking at Harry as though daring him to comment.
Draco laughs too, releasing clouds of white breath into the night. The black sky is already lit by streetlamps and shop windows, but when they turn the corner and into a narrow lane, Harry is pleasantly startled by a riot of decorations. In the distance, a vast Christmas tree towers above them, draped in soft blue lights and topped with a flashing star, while strung over their heads is a network of tiny white bulbs, interspersed with the twinkling shapes of presents and snowflakes and reindeer. The whole street is aglow, filling Harry with festive spirit and a warmth that almost makes up for the fact that he can barely feel his fingers.
“They’re not shoes, they’re spats,” Draco says. “He wanted to look his best. He’s never been a ring bearer before.”
Draco glances at him, one eyebrow slightly lifted. “I see. That’s the conductor’s seat, you know. Are you looking for a job?”
The grace isn’t really what surprises her—Draco has always been graceful, even when he was being a whiny, spiteful teenager at the same time. No, it’s the way he seems to have forgotten himself for a moment, lost himself in the imagination of a little girl and the music that always reminds Luna of an article about dancing tomatoes her father once ran in the
Felicity smiles. “I’ll just get that sack for you.”
“I didn’t want to wake you. The biddies told me about your dramatic turn.”
“They will be sending someone to patrol the street,” Florean says. “Help is coming.”
“It starts now, doesn’t it?”
“The eclipse, you mean?”
Harry, Hugo, and Mr Borteg follow Draco to Sage’s biggest window, where the light from the lantern illuminates an unusual ripple in the glass.
interfering,” Draco says, and a tiny, crooked smile ignites something in Harry’s chest. “But I think… perhaps you’re wanted, too.”
“No reason,” Harry lies again, looking at Draco’s dishevelled hair and cross expression and deciding to keep his smile and his fingers to himself. At least for now. “Is it really that bad?”
A smiling nurse meets them at the entrance to the children’s ward and introduces them to every patient, including the ones lying motionless beneath floating bags of sleeping potions. The sight of them and their gathered families makes Harry’s festivity waver, but the excitement of the rest soon brings it back to full brightness, and he finds that even the parents and siblings of the sicker children seem lifted to see the gifts and cards and chocolates from the residents of Diagon Alley.
“Upstairs,” Eilish says, pointing. “He knew it was only you, so he went up to fetch some string for us.”
“Juice,” Hugo announces, handing his plastic cup to Harry and then grabbing it back with such force that the whole thing slips out of his reach and bounces onto the table, where the lid comes loose and allows purple liquid to spread out over Rose’s artwork.
“Not exactly, but I think—”
“Crimey?” Draco repeats, eyes bright with amusement. “Are you sure your brain isn’t poaching in there?”
“You say that like you think those essays are going to get any better,” Harry laughs, sticking Stanley’s masterpiece to the wall.
“Would you like me to take the little one?” Mr Borteg asks.
“That swan is a menace,” Narcissa says, turning to watch Needle as he settles in the middle of the floor and tucks his head under one wing. There’s something in her tone that means Harry doesn’t really believe her words, but he’s not about to argue with her. “Draco is in the kitchen if you want him.”
“If I don’t slip on all this ice and knock myself unconscious, yes,” Draco sighs, shifting the crates in his arms and setting off over the frosty cobbles.
Harry glances around at the sleeping village one last time, and then they are gone.
“Can we get postcards, Luna?” asks Otis, tugging at her hand.
“Probably. I’ll go in a minute. Here, drink your tea.”
“Aha,” he mutters, eyes settling on the teapot. He leans over and removes the lime green cosy.
“Alright, alright, pull yourselves together or it’ll be Movement to Music for both of you,” Sam says.
Confused and shivering from the cold, he ducks into the shop and grabs his notebook.
“Uncle Harry, do you want a jelly baby?” Rose asks.
“I have a few things to do,” Draco says mysteriously. “Still, we should be alright. They like to do their Christmas shopping and then they like to wander around in the church, looking at all the lovely architecture and lighting candles for anyone they can think of. It usually takes a while.”
“Did you really just tell the editor-in-chief of the Daily Prophet to go and fuck himself?”
“I’ve heard it once or twice,” Draco says carefully. He wants to step closer, to say ‘calm down, take a breath’, but Harry’s ire is written through every line of his body and all he can do is step back, lean against the counter, and listen.
“Shan and Esmee are doing what Shan and Esmee do best,” Florean says. “Making delicious chocolates. Perhaps I’ll go over there and help them.”
Harry smiles to himself, thinking of Eilish, Danica, Ida, and Corrie, of Audrey and Thora and Mr Barleycorn, wondering what they have chosen to do with their busless day and if they know just how much their driver cares for them. He hopes they do, and he has the very strong suspicion that they care about him right back.
“Leave it alone, Luna. I’m sure he can take care of himself,” he snaps, and she can see his fingers tightening around his quill until it threatens to break.
Mrs Purley gives him a dubious look. “Are you sure you don’t want some help, love?”
She wonders who’s next.
“I never forgot about it,” Shan says, catching his confusion and adding. “The cameo. I never forgot. And neither did she.”
“I told you that you wouldn’t like it,” Draco says.
“You are here on behalf of Ms Granger, gentleman,” he says, and though his tone is every bit as cultured as Mr Fortuna’s, his words are soft, almost sighed out into the enormous office.
“I’d better go,” he says, stuffing his hands into his pockets and heading for the door.
“What a wonderful thing to do,” says a tired-looking lady, rising from her seat beside her daughter’s bed. “Linnie has to stay asleep until the antidote is ready,” she explains. “She was bitten by a Polynesian Nailserpent in October. She’ll be so sad that’s she missed Christmas.”
For long seconds, they stand motionless, grass waving around their knees as the wind sweeps through the countryside. Then Draco sighs.
“My what?” Draco asks, not quite ready to let his guard down again.
“You can bring a friend or a special person if you like,” Rose says earnestly. “We have extra tickets because Mum’s the Queen of the PTA.”
Letting out a long, controlled breath, he wraps his arms around his knees and tucks himself in tight. He’s going to go back, because he promised Eilish and because he is not the sort of person who runs away from his problems. All he has to do is not think about it.
“You’re… not quite as warm as me,” he murmurs. “How do you do that?”
“I’m going to kill Ron,” he mutters. “Okay, I’ll take Hugo to the Burrow and then I’ll come back.”
Draco switches off his omnivox, throws on the new Celestina record and slumps back into his chair. His heart is racing and he feels hot, as though someone has sucked all the fresh air out of the room.
“I never said I hadn’t heard of Shakespeare,” Draco says, passing the deerstalker back to the man behind the stall. “I was merely expressing confusion as to why you were quoting Mark Anthony for no good reason. Here, how about a hat for you?”
Needle ambles across the stone flags on his big, flappy feet and inspects his crate, which also seems to have been moved from the main shop floor. Kettleworth watches him uneasily.
“I’d better go, too,” Harry says.
“Okay. I’ll have this, and whatever chocolate goes in it, please.”
“Speaking of psychics, has anyone seen Clara?” Mr Pike asks.
“It’s only a matter of time,” Harry mumbles to himself, pushing open the door and sighing with satisfaction when the bell tinkles softly above their heads.
“That was easier than I expected,” he says, grinning.
Kettleworth smiles. “She’s had a pretty long time to forget.”
When the quizmaster calls a break and everyone rushes for the bar, Harry stays where he is, staring at his empty glass and wondering just what kind of an idiot makes grand statements about love and then falls headfirst into it without stopping to draw breath.
By the time darkness falls on the next night, Harry is prepared. He writes the questions he wants to ask, the things he wants to say, on the back of his hand in ink. Draco stares at his pebbles as he answers, but when he turns to leave, he smiles, lit from behind by the sunrise, and grabs Harry’s wrist.
“Never both?” Draco asks, and Harry has no idea whether he’s being serious or not.
Draco rolls his eyes. “Yes, it’s shocking that I remember the names and personalities… if one can call them that, of your ex-boyfriends.”
There is no response from the swan, but a passing family slows to stare at him.
Harry grimaces. “Don’t you start. The new one is a Quidditch player, apparently, and I am not going out with him.”
“Thanks. Anything else?”
“She seems to have plenty of customers,” Harry says, thinking of the intriguing range of people he sees approaching her shop from his window.
By the time they step into Diagon Alley, the sky is almost dark and the lamps illuminate the cobbles in warm, creeping pools. They wind in and out of late afternoon shoppers and point out the windows and storefronts that have already been decorated for Christmas.
Harry laughs, and then falls silent when his mind flicks back to the distillery, silvery eyes in the dark and the realisation that somewhere among his friends on Diagon Alley is a traitor. He watches his teammates at the bar, faces lit by the multicoloured baubles on the pub’s Christmas tree. They’re going to come dead last, and it doesn’t matter at all. Harry breathes.
“Well, there was that time you left her in Windermere,” the lady says.
He keeps his eyes closed as he breathes slowly and allows every muscle in his body to relax, but when, after ten minutes, the feeling of longing is, if anything, more intense than before, he sighs and heads to the bathroom. After a hot shower, a hearty breakfast, and an admirable attempt at domestic organisation, he steps onto the Knight Bus with a large box of Molly’s practise cupcakes. On realising that all six biddies are wearing their coats and hats, Harry asks,
Ron shakes his head. “No, just wanted to check you were coming to Mum and Dad’s for Sunday lunch.”
“I want you,” he says, breath hitching in his throat.
“Just go.”
Draco stares at the water and pushes out a long breath. “Fuck the lot of them.”
“They’ll be fine. They’re good people. I think you owe them a few apologies, but I’m sure you can cope.”
“Good for her,” Horace says when she returns to him and explains. “My first magic was taking all the water out of my grandfather’s swimming pool… while he was in it. A little bit of fire is a lot more easily fixed.”
“I opened the one with the fruit,” Harry says, staring down at the deluge of papers.
Needle, happy to avoid his strigine enemies, waits in the street with Timothy while Harry places a firecall to Hermione’s office.
Harry stares at him for a moment, fingers tapping against the polished wood of the counter.
presents.”
“I’m not good with all this secret stuff,” Timothy admits, Labrador eyes full of anxiety.
They turn to peer down the alley, just in time to see a man fleeing from the direction of the fountain, face furious and robes torn. Harry sighs, practically tasting the inevitability of it all.
“Yes,” Harry tells Mary Ann, and beside him, Draco is heaving a beleaguered sigh. “I had to make sure I got the best band for the job, didn’t I? It’s not my fault they’re always taking my picture.”
“Well, like everything, this event has evolved over time. It started to attract magical people who wanted to get away from everything and just enjoy the spirit of Christmas. It became quiet… atmospheric. And when everyone started to grow older and have families of their own, they couldn’t stay up all night on Christmas Eve any more, so it moved.”
Harry smiles, heart speeding. “You know, I think there is.”
“Well, let them look,” he says eventually. He rests his head against Harry’s, breathing in the warm scent of his hair. “What you have to realise is that these people are mad.”
“That swan does not look sorry at all,” Harry says under his breath.
“Really?”
“Did he?” Luna says absently. “That’s nice.”
“You’ll have to wait and see, won’t you?” Harry says, and then they are whipping through space and reappearing in a deserted corner of the city and Rose is jumping down onto the pavement.
“I’m terrified,” she says, dropping the needle onto the next record and flicking off both omnivoxes. “Not really,” she adds, smirking. “Sounds like fun.”
, he thinks, getting to his feet and brushing crumbs from his clothes,
“Well, that was special,” Draco says flatly. “I think the last time I was hexed by a first-year... I was also a first-year.”
“Come back to mine?” Harry asks, sticking his tongue out for another snowflake.
“Not that I wasn’t terribly, terribly concerned,” Ron says, “but I wanted to check you definitely weren’t coming to the quiz tonight. Only, we can have eight people on a team and if you’re not coming, I’m going to invite Percy.”
“Careful,” she murmurs, but he doesn’t seem to hear her.
“Not a hitch,” Shan agrees, and then grins, looking at her new ring. “Well, maybe one.”
“It’s… ‘rather too young to be allowed’ and ‘comes in a very nice bottle’,” the man reads, voice stretched thin with the stress of pleasing a difficult person.
“This is really happening to me,” he mumbles, feeling as though his heart has swollen impossibly and is lying smashed up against his ribcage.
“Because he’s… well, look at him,” Harry says, indicating Needle, who is now stretching out his neck to eat the plants from Mr Jennings’ window box. “He’s a bit odd.”
Draco raises an eyebrow. “You’ll ruin your lunch.”
When Mr Jennings walks in, followed by Sophie, Needle hisses loudly and Draco feeds him a grassy treat under the table. He sits down with his horrible toffee-tomato sundae and looks around with such calm curiosity that Harry wants to get up and tip the cold slimy mess over his head. Fortunately, Florean takes that moment to tap his long spoon against his knickerbocker glory and call the meeting to order.
Draco thinks she should have the sense to leave his ducks out of it, but then Pansy has never been the most sensible of creatures. There is something about his nicely-maintained pond and its raft of black and white Muscovies that she finds inexplicably hilarious, but it’s only when she’s consumed several glasses of champagne that she likes to bring sex into the equation.
“Come on, Harry, we just want to hear about your new boyfriend,” Deb says, grinning. “Or… what did they call him?”
“One Sickle into the tin, love,” she says, indicating the donation pot on her trestle table at the edge of the ice. “I’ve got tea, coffee, hot chocolate and crackleballs.”
“The point is,” Eilish says, “don’t give up on him. He might have a funny way of showing it, but he’s pleased you’re here.”
He finds Mr Borteg behind the counter, polishing invisible smears from his till with a soft cloth. Harry hangs back in the doorway to watch him, intrigued to notice a new addition to his usual dark outfit in the shape of an orange woven bracelet.
“Hi, Uncle Harry. Why do you have feathers on your coat?”
“Good heavens,” Eilish murmurs, shaking the trumpet violently until something falls out of it and drops onto the floor.
Draco shakes his head and then looks around. Harry follows his eyes. Surrounded by vast, craggy hills, the village of Strath Kinna is barely more than a scattering of stone buildings and a single, uneven road. Several houses crouch at either side of the Post Office, and fifty yards or so along the road sits a little grey building with a slate roof and a sign, swinging violently in the wind, that declares it The Old Trout Inn.
Granger protests but Harry and Draco are already halfway to the door. When they leave her, she is sitting on the floor with her arms around her daughter, mumbling words of praise into her hair.
At five minutes to twelve, everyone begins to pile onto the old bus, Sam at the wheel and Deb sitting beside him with a clipboard, checking off the name of each child as they board. Eliza has so many ribbons in her hair that Luna cannot count them all. Gareth is wearing his dressing gown backwards. Several of the little ones have swapped parts of their pyjama sets to create multiple mismatching ensembles, and Luna cannot help but admire their creativity.
With a huge effort, he walks away, out of the kitchen, through the dining room and into the street. The cold winter air blasts into his face and he groans, unsure if he wants to throw up or burst into tears. When he tries to take off his coat, he realises that he’s been clinging to his broom the entire time and he just about resists the temptation to throw it across the room. Instead, he flings his coat onto the rack and seizes the broom, sweeping savagely at the parquet floor until he longer feels as though he’s about to collapse.
Pansy sighs. “Poor Draco. Your head is so full of useless things.”
“Probably,” he sighs, but when he reaches for more words, he comes up with nothing.
,” he says triumphantly, picking up a tall green bottle with an impressive drawing of a trout on the label. “It’s an Islay, it’s definitely younger than it tastes and I think it’s a nice bottle. What do you reckon?”
“I don’t want to…” Harry begins, but stops, realising he doesn’t know how to finish that sentence.
Harry suppresses a smile. “Well, I suppose I could, but Molly made these because she’s practising for her son’s wedding tomorrow. Actually,” he adds, lowering his voice, “I wondered if I could ask you all a question about that.”
Molly frowns, turning to look at Fred and seeming startled to see only one twin looking back at her.
“How do you know it’s a him?” Draco asks, as Harry carefully surrounds the spider with a charm that will give an accurate measurement of his leg-span.
Draco watches him for a moment and then stalks out of the shop. That’s fine, he thinks. He doesn’t need to know anyway, and he absolutely, definitely won’t be coming back.
“Kindly go and fuck yourself,” Harry says, copying his posture before he realises what he’s doing.
“Don’t you dare say ‘complicated’,” Harry warns, and beneath the fury surging in his chest, something like electricity crackles in the air between them. The combination is so confusing that the next words are out before he can stop them. “Don’t. Your life isn’t complicated. You have no life.”
“That’s the spirit,” Mary Ann says. “If I can face the world in my flowery nightie then you can put on your posh designer pyjamas and help us raise some money for the kids.”
Harry laughs, and something inside Draco breaks open, flooding him with warmth.
“That smells brilliant,” he says, expertly catching a small rabbit and tipping a potion into its mouth.
Several people throw coins into the metal tins and Florean smiles.
“Don’t be so bloody dramatic,” Draco says mildly, earning himself a poke in the arm from Mary Ann, who does not appear to be able to take her eyes away from Harry.
“Draco, what on earth are you talking about?”
He decides against pointing out that this is at least the third time Harry has made this suggestion today, and instead finds a very reluctant smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. If he and Stanley are struggling with the temperature, he knows that Harry is in hell. His skin is flushed and his chaotic dark hair is flopping against his forehead, temporarily beaten into submission by the humidity. The air in the bedroom is like soup, and even with their best attempts at magically bringing freshness into the atmosphere, there is nothing much to be done beside flopping naked on the sheets and waiting for the madness to pass. According to Poppy, who reads the
“Everything will be alright in the end,” Eilish says, patting his hand.
While Corrie, Eilish, and Danica examine the contents of Ida’s bedside cabinet, Harry hangs back in the doorway. Relieved to see some colour in her cheeks again, he relaxes, taking out his wand to remove the Notice-Me-Not spell, and then hesitates.
she adds silently.
“It’s that virus,” someone says, and they sound very certain about it.
Harry looks at the swan, who is now standing by Draco’s side and looking up at him adoringly with little black eyes.
“It was brilliant,” Caroline declares.
Feeling dubious, Harry obeys, and the moment his hand touches the polished wood, an outline appears, followed by a soft click as the little compartment falls open. Inside, an improbably wide selection of fruits are packed into the small space in a riot of colour and delicious, heavy scents.
Reluctantly, Harry releases Draco and attempts to ruffle his hair back into place.
“Maybe she fell over him,” Corrie says, indicating Montague. “He looks guilty.”
He doesn’t reply, but his voice finds her as she nears the top of the stairs.
“Of course it was. Now, how do you plan on putting a stop to the speculation about your love life?”
There is a mumble of satisfaction from the group, and, without a word, they move as one to surround the chair by the fire, leaning this way and that to allow Horace to make his way through. He sits with care, tucking his outer robe around himself fastidiously, and then looks up at Luna with a silent question.
“That’s not fair,” Danica says, and the others nod vehemently.
“Yeah. Well, you and Hermione are our experts on all that stuff, and if you’re not there, we’ll be at a bit of a disadvantage. Percy’s read a lot of books, though, so it makes sense to pick him next,” Ron says.
open at page two.
“We should celebrate,” Draco says, already reaching for his shoes.
“Yes, Sam, I put
She nods, shifting against him to secure herself. The paper bag in his pocket crackles and her eyes light up.
“Harry Potter,” he says, reaching into his bag. “Have you got a moment to—?”
“Because,” Harry says, biting into a chunk of sausage with a happy sigh, “this is good, honest German food, and your restaurant only serves tiddly bits of fancy fancy with ‘jus’ and ‘foam’.”
Narcissa smiles to herself and slices delicately into a piece of turkey.
“With the weird floating things in it,” Harry sighs.
She loathes leaving a blank space on anything from an exam to a market research survey, and Harry knows that by the end of the evening, there will be an answer to every question, even if not all of them necessarily make sense.
“Don’t worry,” she says, dashing into the house and leaving Harry alone in the garden. “You’ll like this one.”
I mentioned that Marie was trying to explode my brain with some of these prompts... this one was the most impressive of all. Sure, let's have a bonfire on the 23rd of December. For what it's worth, all the weird shit that goes on in this chapter is, according to my research, based on real festive tradition. Batshit brilliance :)
Draco sighs. “No, you don’t. They are working because they all care deeply for their community, of that I have no doubt. But they’re pulling together like this because
Gathering all the loose leaves and stuffing them into her bag, she wanders down the rickety staircase and makes tea and toast, for which she gently pulls her father away from the press and out onto the balcony, where Mr Abernathy has perched hopefully, waiting for attention and leftover crusts.
Finally, Draco grips his hips and urges him to move. Harry closes his eyes and allows himself to be guided, rising and falling and rocking in a rhythm so slow that he wants to cry with the intensity of it. Draco’s fingers dig into his hips, holding him firm and pulling him down onto his cock again and again. Tension vibrates through every line of Harry’s body, making his muscles ache and his skin slick with sweat, but he pours himself into it, staring down at Draco and frowning to see him holding his wand.
“Hang on, what?” Harry demands, pulse quickening.
“Over here?” Harry asks, indicating the wall where Rosa’s picture of Draco, Professor McGonagall’s Christmas card and his own drawing of Stanley hang in pride of place.
“For me,” Draco says, straightening up and trying, in Harry’s opinion, to look taller.
“It’s from a film. My dad has all the songs for the record player.”
Hermione abandons her newspaper with a roll of her eyes and picks up her copy of
“Hello, Draco, have you come to join in?” Eilish asks brightly.
“Mummy, can we go on the big purple bus now?”
“Mr Malfoy, we are only letting family members see the patient at the moment,” says a weary-sounding woman, and Harry looks around, finally spotting her. “Are you a family member?”
“Long story.”
“Last night,” he sighs, trying not to blush. He’s a grown man and if he wants to sleep next to another grown man, he shouldn’t be embarrassed about it. But he is, because six people are looking at him and he doesn’t think he can hide in his soup bowl, however much he might want to. “Draco and I… we’re together, all your suspicions are true and you were right all along, I’m an idiot, and… a Merry Christmas,” he finishes, lifting his wine glass and frowning when everyone, including Narcissa, starts to laugh.
Harry’s heart lurches. “Excuse me?”
“Thank you,” he says, yawning. “How did you sleep?”
Harry wants to resist; he wants, in the politest way possible, to tell Esmee to mind her own business, to stand up and walk out of the flat with his dignity mostly intact. He tries his best, but Esmee’s encouraging smile is too much for him, and the words just come tumbling out. He tells her everything, from their work together on the investigation to their talk in the distillery, finishing with an account of the incident at Sage that makes him want to hex himself in the face. Esmee listens in silence, nodding and only occasionally interrupting him to cough into her handkerchief.
Luna sighs.
“I don’t know, but he had very tall hair.”
He opens his eyes. The shop is empty. He can hear Mr Borteg muttering away to himself in the back room, and the door is still closed. Puzzled, Harry leans over the counter just as a knobbly orange bill rises up to rest on it. Needle’s little black eyes peer up into his and he ruffles his wings in a way that tells Harry he is very pleased with himself.
“And you can wear this,” Corrie says with a triumphant grin, shaking out a scarlet knitted object and giving it to Harry. “Fresh off the needles!”
Needle wags his tail feathers and reaches out to chomp on the hem of Mr Borteg’s long jacket.
The female painter pops up inside her stall, hands already covered in smears of colour. “No, sorry. Haven’t seen him since yesterday. Hey, you’re the spider guy,” she adds, beaming at Harry. “Your little girl was awesome—it was really cool to paint something different.”
“How could you?” Jean demands. “We’ve been friends for forty years.”
Instinctively, they step away from each other, an action which, for some reason, causes the old lady to burst into laughter.
Harry smothers the unwanted thoughts in the kiss, tasting the loch on Draco’s mouth and running possessive hands over his cold, wet skin. Draco’s tongue is hot against his, stealing Harry’s breath, strong fingers grabbing his hips and pulling him closer, tighter, under the water. By the time they draw apart, Harry’s heart is racing and he can barely feel the pebbles beneath his feet. The light from the setting sun glimmers over the loch, scattering soft ribbons of pastel rainbows all around them that trip over the surface of the water and paint their wet skin, while the cold wind whistles through the valley and fills Harry’s senses with the heavy scent of approaching rain.
“I don’t know, but I doubt he’d last long with Juno around,” Draco says.
Pansy tosses her glossy black hair and flounces over to her seat.
Astonished, Harry stares at her and then at Draco, who is edging around a line of traffic with a rather hunted expression on his face.
“Well, it’s my stag and I’m glad she’s here,” George says stridently. “It’s not fair that she should miss out on the fun because she’s a girl.”
He doesn’t hear Mrs Purley’s response and he doesn’t need to. He knows what it is about Draco, and it’s
“What are those?” Harry asks, enjoying Draco’s pointless exasperation.
“Was it me? I bet it was me,” he mumbles.
“Are you alright?” Ida asks, and he looks up.
“You’re not going to let that go, are you?” Draco sighs, stepping out into the Saturday morning crowds and holding the door open for Harry with his foot.
Harry sighs. “No magic. Not for that.”
Harry stops hopping and stares at him, heart thumping. “The place in the photograph?”
“They’re perfect, thank you,” Luna says. She sets down the crate and picks out a wooden spoon and a metal ladle, smacking them together in rhythm and producing a satisfying clanging sound.
“Yep,” he lies. Again. “I just don’t want to go out with anyone right now. Is that alright?”
“We have discussed this. You’ll see when we get there,” Draco says, eyeing the box with interest. “Is one of those for me?”
“What do you mean?”
Ron looks down at his candy cane-patterned jumper and shrugs. “You haven’t seen yours yet, mate.” He glances at Draco, taking in his sober outfit of plain trousers and a forest green shirt. “I think your mum went to the shed with Dad and Angelina.”
“I have this. It’s real gold,” Draco says suddenly, producing a heavy fountain pen from his pocket.
“Improvising,” Harry says, and before she can protest, he plonks the tea cosy on her head.
“Actually, you’ve been invited for dinner at Sage. That’s Draco’s restaurant,” he says, and Arthur makes an excitable little sound.
“When my father died, I signed it all over to the Ministry,” he says, catching Harry’s look of astonishment. “No, I’m still not their biggest fan but I made them sign a contract promising that they would use the money for useful things, not for pointless bureaucracy and certainly not for wars.”
Harry laughs, certain he’ll do no such thing, but when Draco pushes into him harder, and then doesn’t stop, he loses all control of the noises he is making. It is far from the first time that he has been fucked by Draco and fucking loved it, but there is something about what’s happening now that feels different. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re safe, peaceful, and unlikely to be interrupted. Perhaps it’s something more... perhaps the way Draco strokes him, slides inside him and holds him protectively all at once. Harry doesn’t know, but he knows that he can’t hold onto this feeling for much longer, and when Draco urges him to turn his head for a kiss, he cries out and comes all over himself, the sensation of release so powerful that he almost wants it to stop.
When he opens his eyes again, the rain has eased slightly and Draco is no longer next to him. Startled, Harry sits up bolt upright and feels for his wand, only to find it missing from his pocket.
“I set this up so I could hear if Esmee needed me,” she explains.
As he pours the tea, Ron appears with a flailing Hugo in his grip. He straps the little boy into a wooden highchair and ruffles his curly hair.
Luna waits, because she knows, and so does Sam, who shoots her a glance that clearly conveys the message, ‘don’t say a word’. She mimes pulling a zip across her mouth and he does the same, but it doesn’t matter, because a split second later, Draco’s glimmer is sputtering and his fingers are gripping the sheet of paper a little too tight.
“My mother still takes the
The fifth card depicts a beautiful but bleak forest of bare trees, and inside, he is surprised to see the name at the bottom.
As he takes back control of his derailed meeting, Harry continues to write, keeping half an eye on the twenty pound note as it travels around the room. He wonders if he’ll get it back.
Harry groans and rubs his face with both hands. “I’m starting to think that both of you know me too well,” he says, getting to his feet. He takes a deep breath. “Erm… I’m afraid I have to be off now. Thank you for the lovely dinner and I’ll see you all very soon, but I have to… I have to go.”
“What?” Luna asks innocently, making no effort to intervene.
“Because he’s Harry Potter,” Eilish whispers. “We know who he is.”
He hopes she’ll be pleased to see him, and then he stops and shakes that idea from his head. Molly is always pleased to see him; she’s delighted to welcome any guest into her home, and Harry is rather counting on that fact. Whether Draco sees the whole endeavour as helpful or unwanted interference is another matter, but he has to try, and he has to do it now, because the stile is cold and hard and he can no longer feel his backside.
“But we have these,” Draco says, examining the pile of presents. “They’re rather scuffed up, but then that’s what happens when you throw things into a sack and then shove them under your floor.”
That sigh sits heavily in the very pit of his stomach, taking root there and seeming to stretch out soft, aching tendrils to wrap around his heart, spine, and thighs. Closing his eyes, Harry splays himself on the sheets in an indolent sprawl, arching his back and almost vibrating with a jittery blend of frustration and warm anticipation.
“Of course,” he says, folding his arms. “This is the first Christmas we aren’t going to spend on the bus—I can’t believe you’d even think I wouldn’t be there.”
Delighted, Stanley holds himself neat and still while the decoration is spelled to his shell in a sparkling spiral. The boys hold him up to admire him and he can’t wait to run back home and show his new look to all his favourite people.
“Don’t stop,” Draco murmurs, and Harry hesitates only for a second before abandoning himself to it, losing himself to the slide of Draco’s cock inside him and tipping back his head to watch the stunning, swirling colours of the Northern Lights.
“How dare you?” George hisses, sticking his little finger out from his cup and slurping loudly. “I am a man of fine breeding and impeccable manners.”
“Don’t ask,” Harry advises, and William says no more on the subject, but he is still grinning when they reach the farm.
After a moment, he tempers the little smile and it disappears. “I see,” he says gravely.
“Single-use crystal balls?”
She looks up from a rather involved stretch on the arm of Corrie’s chair and regards Draco with her head on one side and her ears twitching. After a moment, she sneezes and then settles down to sleep.
“Well, we never open the restaurant on Christmas Day, but we’re always busy the week before, so there are lots of wonderful leftovers in the kitchen,” Draco says. “We each make up a plate and then we go up to my flat and watch a murder mystery on television. Mother likes Agatha Christie.”
Harry leans down, pressing his face against Ida’s and his fingers against her wrist. Her skin is paper-thin and cold, but her breathing is steady and her heartbeat strong. He nods, and there is a collective sigh of relief that fills him and makes his eyes sting. Ida smells like humbugs and flowers and her long hair is loose, fanned out around her like a halo. She also appears to be wearing her nightclothes, which would certainly explain why she is so cold. She could have been here for hours.
“Good friends are hard to find,” she says, cutting him off with such a gentle tone that he immediately feels remorseful. “Enemies who become friends are even harder.”
The source of the familiar smell now becomes blatantly obvious as Harry finds himself staring at an enormous fire, crouching on the river bank and licking at least twenty feet into the air. Around it, people are talking quietly, drinking from mugs and throwing pieces of wood into the flames as though concerned the whole thing might fizzle out at any moment. As he steps closer, a wall of heat hits him and forces him to close his eyes, tip his head back in submission and wait for his body to adjust. He inhales deeply, drawing in the aroma of burning, crackling wood and a hint of warm, spicy food that makes his stomach growl.
For now.
As they reach the top of the alley, ready to make their way back down, Deb turns around at the head of the group and yells, “Let’s dance!”
He opens his mouth to speak and finds that not only has it turned completely dry, but that he has forgotten everything he wanted to say.
Draco drops his head to Harry’s shoulder and exhales against his jumper. “You won’t be surprised to know that I couldn’t stop thinking about you.”
“They might be lost,” Caroline says knowledgably, smoothing down her pyjama shirt so that the tiny Sorting Hats are displayed to best advantage.
“That’s right. We flipped a Sickle for it. She was disappointed not to get you lot, but her side has the pet shop and the florist, so she’s happy enough.” Shan glances wearily out of the window. “If she doesn’t come home with an iguana and half a forest, I’ll be surprised.”
“Did I know that the swan had come back?” Harry asks tentatively.
“I can’t see him,” Natalie says, stretching up on tiptoes and squinting down the street.
“Like I said, it’s complicated.”
“Who asked you?” Caroline snaps, looking as though she is about to burst into tears.
A second, riled by the group, takes out her wand and attempts to disarm Draco. She fails, partly because Draco’s wand is tucked away in his pocket and partly because her command of the spell only allows her to produce a brief flash of red light that makes her squeak and run away.
Enough is enough, Harry thinks, steeling himself for another attempt at capture. All he has to do is get it into a cardboard box and take it to a suitable place. A place where swans are free to bite other swans and everyone can keep their fingers. He’s being public spirited, really. And swan spirited. After all, nobody wants to be pelted with pears. The fact that it’s almost three o’clock and he has to go into Muggle London anyway is just a bonus.
“It can’t be that bad,” Harry laughs, moving his arms around in a way that reminds Luna strongly of the Giant Squid that lives in the lake at Hogwarts.
“Fire breathers are people, too, Draco,” Harry says, kicking up snow and smiling to himself.
Hugo sneezes, blinks in surprise, and then resumes wailing.
“Do I?” Harry asks, cradling his cup of tea and tucking his feet up under him.
“It’s not… weird, or anything,” he says, flushing again. “I just liked reading about what you were up to. I’ve always been…” He stops and takes a breath, composing himself. “I don’t think I’m wrong in saying that we’ve both found each other interesting.”
“We need to get outside,” Harry shouts, raising his voice and ushering everyone out into the street, where they gulp at the clean air and attempt to brush off their clothes.
,” Ron adds, pulling off a pretty good impression of Mad-Eye Moody.
Humbled, Harry watches him go and then walks slowly back through the house and to the table.
Draco puts his eye to the telescope and smiles. “I don’t care.”
“You never really liked any of the other ones,” Ron points out. “I don’t know why you put up with it all these years. If it were me, I’d have told you to bugger off by now.”
By the time the NEWT results are posted, they are back in Strath Kinna. Two weeks of odd jobs, excellent chips and perfect peace lie ahead of them before they have promised to meet Ron and Hermione at the Burrow, and Draco is doing an almost faultless job of pretending he is not at all anxious about the prospect. When two large Hogwarts owls swoop down to the water’s edge, he leaps to his feet, leaving Harry stretched out in the sunshine by himself.
“Whoa…” Benny breathes, pulling up next to her and all she can do is nod.
“Can we do the teapot dance?” asks Benny, and she turns to him with a smile.
For a long time, Harry says nothing. A slow smile spreads across his face. “Fine,” he says at last. “Let’s look at the catalogue and then I’ll order you one from our avian breeders.”
I hear that Draco was seen rolling around on the floor of the Magical Menagerie yesterday—confirm or deny?
And alright, he has to go back, but he’s here now and he feels so good and his hand is just perfect around Harry’s cock, just like that. Every nerve ending seems to congregate where Draco touches him, rushing hard and hot and tingling and chasing out every last bit of prickling discomfort until all Harry can feel is need and all he can hear is the sound of Draco’s breathing, slightly ragged, against his face. The cool air from the window lifts his hair from his hot forehead and whispers a soothing ripple around him. Draco presses tightly against his back, stiff fabric against bare skin, hardness pushing into Harry’s back and making him groan with desire. He pushes into the tight fist around him, jerking his hips shamelessly. Draco has seen this before, many, many times. He likes to watch Harry come, almost insists upon it, and he knows as he starts to lose control that those eyes are all over him.
Mr Borteg retrieves his santa hat and makes his way behind the counter. “Very well.”
“Speak for yourself,” Thora mumbles.
Hermione smiles and leans down to hug him. “Thank you. Rose, put your shoes on.”
Mr Borteg’s ghostly eyes fix upon Harry with such sternness that he almost takes a step backwards.
“When Ron gets hurt doing Auror stuff, they always let me in,” Harry offers.
Draco drains his cup without a word. He gets to his feet, fiddling with the tie of his cotton robe and meeting Harry’s eyes slowly. “I’m going for a shower. Are you coming?”
“I didn’t even see it. Hermione was horrified. She just kept saying ‘oh, god, Harry’ over and over. Ron kept making me toast, because apparently that solves everything.”
“You can be anything you like, Luna,” her father says firmly.
“Yes, please,” Harry says with a yawn. His previous crotchety exhaustion has drained away to be replaced by a new sort of weightiness that wraps around him and threatens to pull him down in seconds. “Don’t die. I’ll be very angry.”
“Why is he wearing his boots?” Winston asks, frowning. “It’s not snowing.”
“I can already see in the dark,” Draco says loftily. “I am exspecional. Excessional.
Someone knocks the wireless up a few notches and puts on a virtuoso performance of an old Celestina Warbeck hit, while Otis stands beside them and quite convincingly pretends to accompany on the piano.
Mr Borteg hurries out of the distillery. “All of the kits are safe,” he announces, seeming to sag with relief. “I have tested every single still and barrel now, and they are all undisturbed.”
“I wouldn’t dream of it,” says Harry, who hasn’t written anything; Jean hasn’t yet told him anything he doesn’t already know.
“That was impressive,” Draco says to Shan. “I’ve never dared to repair my mother’s jewellery. It’s all so delicate and I feel as though I’d just make it worse.”
“I did, but I tried not to!” one declares, screwing up his face.
Ginny looks around for her mother and then grins and gives him the finger.
Draco lets out a humourless snort. He unwinds a section of string, wrapping it around his hands and pulling tight until his fingers turn white.
“What are you doing?” Luna asks.
“Molly, I was in there the other day in my jeans and no one batted an eyelid. Please come. Ron and Hermione will be there, too. I think it’ll be really nice.”
Draco pauses, remembering the warmth of Harry’s skin beneath his fingers when he’d offered a reassuring touch. The fury in his eyes as he’d paced the shop. Draco breathes.
Draco sits beside him, wet coat pressing against Harry’s legs and forming a damp patch on his jeans. He says nothing, instead gazing at this complicated man who cannot skate to save his life.
Draco smiles. “So... you wanted to?”
Harry looks at him, heart speeding. “Excuse me?”
There had been more, and there had certainly been images more unsettling, but all Harry can really remember is the handshakes. The one he had never accepted on his first day of school, the ones, begrudgingly and perfunctorily given after Quidditch matches, the strange, tentative one offered for the return of a wand, and the most recent: cool, strong fingers wrapping around his and pale eyes bright on his in the cab of the Knight Bus.
“Don’t people ever call to say anything normal, like ‘can you play my favourite song?’” Harry asks.
“Okay. Then why do we need to do it?”
“I don’t pretend to be an expert on these things, but doesn’t a stag night usually come immediately before the wedding?”
Harry freezes, feeling as though all of the air has been sucked out of the bus.
“So… you have a swan now,” Harry says, unsure if it’s a question or not.
“We should introduce ourselves,” Harry says.
Pretending offence, Harry sweeps through to the table, where all four ladies are buttoned into their coats, with various handbags, walking sticks and dachshunds gathered around them. Next to Danica’s teacup is a small, delicately-meshed silver cage. It has a little handle for easy carrying, a miniature water bottle strapped to one side, and seems to be stuffed full of dangling ribbons, little wooden toys and seeded treats. Somewhere amid the colourful jungle, Harry can just see the bright eyes and twitching whiskers of the mouse.
“You’re barking up the wrong tree there, love,” Shan laughs. “I’m eighty-three and very happy with what I’ve got. No offence, Harry.”
He leans over to store the rest of his grapes on the dashboard and the question slips out without his permission.
Mr Borteg lifts one pointy shoulder in a shrug. Harry shrugs back.
“It ruined my best trousers yesterday,” Mr Jennings says, and for a moment, Harry frowns, trying to imagine how one of Florean’s excellent wafers could do such a thing. “Tore a hole in the knee.”
By five-thirty, he is beginning to weaken. Already wondering what kind of gossip he has missed out on, he almost catches himself dashing out into the snow to find a copy of the
“No,” they say as one, grinning at each other as they push open the door of the travel office with a rattle and step inside.
Harry flashes her a grateful smile and dumps his purchases on the counter. He begins another loop of the shop, picking up boxes and putting them back down. On the last shelf by the door, he spots a shiny red object and picks it up. There’s a slot for coins and an empty glass-fronted section.
Hermione leads the way down to the kitchen without bothering to light the stairs. “The one whose mother is a chef at an Indian restaurant.”
“He has,” Draco says under his breath, and then drops his face into his hands when the biddies exchange gleeful glances.
“Oh, god,” Harry whispers, already feeling the heat of arousal wrapping around the base of his spine. “Fuck, Draco… I can’t…”
“Well, nothing for a while. I’d almost given up. But yesterday...” Ginny shifts on the bench and pulls out a letter that looks like it has been read and folded and re-read many, many times. “She wrote back! She said she’d looked me up and asked me if I’d like to fly with them during training next week.”
“Oh, god…” he whispers, tipping his head back and letting the water saturate his pale hair. “Oh, fucking god… yes-yes-yes-yes-yes…”
“So, where have you been?” he asks when she returns, mostly for the benefit of the listeners. “The Viper Pit? The Million Galleon Club? Madam Exclusive’s Exclusive Retreat for the Exclusive?”
“There’s nothing surprising about us,” Eilish says, combing through her silver grey hair with a gnarled, ring-decked hand. “We’re here every day.”
“Anything?” Draco asks, walking into the room and wrinkling his nose.
“I’ll look out for that,” Harry says. “What else?”
“Well, we have plenty of those,” Harry says. “Is there something in particular?”
“Count the ways, love,” Jean laughs bitterly. “We’re all connected here.”
He smells like wood shavings and tea and something that tugs at Draco’s stomach. Mildly alarmed, he ignores it and casts around for another question.
The ladies giggle and Harry just soaks it up. He glances at Draco, who chooses that moment to glance at him, and the bus fires a single pomegranate into the chandelier.
“Different,” Hannah says after a moment.
Fred consults an imaginary list through imaginary spectacles. “You know, I think we do.”
“I don’t know,” Pansy says, examining her nails. “I’ve never read it. Apparently, it’s bonkers.”
“Are you going to listen nicely?”
“You could say that.”
“Somewhere for the biddies to go every week while you have a break,” Harry explains, suddenly self-conscious. “A way for you to have time off from the bus. You know, time for a life.”
“The jumper?” Draco repeats, eyebrows knitted.
“Have you lost your mind?” he mumbles, blinking in surprise when his earmuffs slide off his head and land on Harry’s chest.
“Oh, good. Can I sit on your sofa?”
“Harry, neither of us has enemies on this street,” Draco says, dropping into a crouch against the wall and stroking Needle’s feathers. “I hope I don’t have any at all… not any more.”
“Otis, you don’t get it,” Caroline says, voice anguished. “I’m nearly ten and I haven’t done
Harry lets out a long breath and folds up the letter, head spinning.
Harry groans and closes his eyes. A split second later, they fly open again. “Dinner!”
“I am the manager, Malfoy. If you’d like to speak to Bill, the owner, you’ll have to wait until tomorrow.”
“I don’t read that rag, young man! Won’t have it in the house!” Mr Fortuna interrupts. “If you want my memory, though—” He rummages in a nearby cupboard and produces a small glass vial. “—you are entirely welcome to it!”
“Oh, look,” Draco says with enviable nonchalance. “Here comes Officer Kettleworth of the MLE. Perhaps you’d like to… ah, he’s gone.”
“Do you have to fuss?” Draco sighs, pulling the lever that compresses the whole bus to allow it to slip between two heavy goods vehicles. “You’re like a mother hen,” he adds, voice seeming slow and distorted in Harry’s ears.
He turns his tea mug this way and that on the table, like he always does when he’s thinking hard.
“How long?” Luna asks, wondering if she’s about to be treated to some fast mental arithmetic.
“He is with us when we are buying underpants,” Lee puts in, lifting his empty glass. Charlie fills it.
Mary Ann and Harry are bending over something small held between them while Draco is reading the
Harry rubs at his glittery face and then wipes his hands off on his jeans. Needle tips his head onto one side and then the other, inspecting the sparkles. For a minute or two, there is silence in the distillery, and Harry listens to the soft, muffled sounds of the shop, the footsteps of Mr Borteg and the tinkle of the bell above the door. He breathes slowly, detecting lemons and wood and the slightly damp aroma of swan. This is a strange moment, there’s no getting away from that, but it might also be the first time he and Draco have ever spent time together without making fun of each other.
“I wouldn’t.”
“What?” Harry frowns, wanting to reach for him again already. “Why not?”
“Right, that’s it,” Molly says suddenly, reaching for her oven gloves. “I’m getting the chickens out before they go dry. If George wants cold dinner, that’s his choice.”
“Alright. I’d better call Ron, he’s been at the office all night, trying to see if MLE can get at them through official channels,” she says. “I’m sure he’ll find something.”
“Of course we’ve got the full range of crackleballs,” the magpie says with another cackle. “Can’t risk running out on Christmas Eve. You’d better go and give those owls their breakfast before it’s time to open up.”
She smiles at him and nudges Shan, who is picking up chocolates with silver tongs at the direction of a lady with an elaborate feathered hat.
“Yes. Stop fussing,” Harry says, grinning.
“I’ll pay,” Harry insists, gently dislodging Juno and grabbing a handful of coins from his pocket and scanning the list again. “Unlimited day ride with a cup of tea. I’ll have that.”
“That’s not a magpie,” Harry mumbles, squinting around at the dark bedroom.
“Harry?”
,” he mumbles, aiming at the weakest part of the door and casting with a calm steadiness that Harry envies.
“Everyone, this is Derek,” he says to the other ducks that night as they crowd around the newcomer. “Derek, this is... everyone. Please play nicely.”
By the time the week is out, however, he has run out of luck. Despite his and Draco’s best attempts at discretion, it has not escaped the other students’ attention that former enemies Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy appear to be friends. It has not escaped Harry and Draco’s attention that no one seems to be very happy about the situation.
Luna isn’t even a little bit surprised by his perceptiveness; so often, children just know things. Still, she feels slightly sorry for Harry and Draco for being outsmarted by an eight-year-old who thinks green vegetables are his mortal enemies.
“You were encouraging him, weren’t you?”
“You can have it when you stop being a fusspot and come skating with us,” Harry says.
, that he is just one step from losing himself completely, it could happen at any time, and the sensation of being constantly on edge is almost more than his heart and his mind and his body can endure.
“Ladies, give me your ages,” Eilish says, raising her wand.
“Do you want to rephrase that?” Ginny asks, eyebrows raised.
“He played all of us very well,” Draco says darkly. “All that ‘oh, I’m so vulnerable and shaken up’ routine. Sophie’s going to be
“Oh, god, he’s had two,” Bill says. “Has he had two?”
“Do you honestly think I didn’t consider that?” Draco sighs. He lets go of Harry’s hand and leans into the bus to turn on the headlights. “Can you see how the water curves around the crag there?”
“A most wonderful employee,” Fred declares, looking much happier to be back in his own clothes.
“Should we look at the scene?” Harry asks, reluctant to see what the thief has done to either business.
“Are you alright?” Danica asks, sharp eyes fastening on him.
“We saw three magpies and a big spider!” Rose says, taking off her coat and hurrying to stroke Kingsley as though he might disappear at any moment.
“Who’s having ice cream?” someone asks, slamming the office door behind them and adding: “Sorry I’m late.”
“I’m not annoying you,” Draco says. “I’m browsing.”
“Shakespeare, I think,” he says, and then burrows further into his blanket. “If it were Muggles attacking us, I bet they
“Well, they are pretty difficult to tell apart,” Ginny says, looking over her shoulder just in time to see Louis drop his end of the table on his foot and swear loudly in French.
“Isn’t he nice?” Audrey beams at him and then turns straight back to her chair, slamming it with multicoloured spells that seem to be doing nothing but making it smoke slightly.
Harry enjoys Louis’ confused expression for a moment, and then starts to pile roast potatoes onto his plate. He eats slowly, thinking of Mrs Purley and the mysterious thief and feeling thankful that Diagon Alley is so much more than a collection of businesses; it’s a community, a family that will be rallying around her right now and throwing everything they’ve got at getting her back on her feet. Tomorrow, he’ll talk to MLE and give Mrs Purley a hug and do something useful to help, like organising a collection to replace what she’s lost. Right now, his place is here, with people who measure spiders and dance like chickens and eat astounding amounts of sausages.
“Maybe,” Draco murmurs, and hope sparks deep in his chest. He has to talk to Harry.
He looks around, assuring himself that this part of the loch, at least, is hidden by the trees and that none of the locals will see anything they don’t want to. Once satisfied, he tugs his scratchy jumper over his head and flings it aside. The sun and the breeze are a caress against his prickly skin, and it isn’t long before the rest of his clothes join the tangle of wool on the ground.
“Stills, Harry,” Mr Borteg says, almost in a whisper. “The character of the spirit is a mere hostage to the decision of a quarter of an inch this way or that.”
Draco agrees that Stanley has, indeed, had a bit of a time. “He’s fine. He’ll be asleep soon,” he says, already feeling the familiar weight of a weary beetle pressed against him.
The cabin is almost completely dark, and Harry immediately begins feeling around the walls for light switches but finds none. The floorboards creak under their feet as they move around, Harry managing to stub his toe on something extremely solid a fraction of a second before Draco casts
Harry looks up in surprise. “I brought stuff from home. But this is much better.”
Harry shivers and gazes down Diagon Alley, suddenly aware of just how long it is.
They make their apologies and retreat to their usual table, while Gertie makes a fuss of removing her coat and bustling into the kitchen. She returns with their food so quickly that Harry suspects she has been saving two portions especially for them, and he accepts his plate guiltily.
Two elderly ladies regard him with interest from their armchairs and Harry, feeling rather self conscious, glances around at the interior of the bus. In daylight, the violet walls and ceiling seem even more vivid and the endless pictures of grey cats now make a little more sense. Juno herself now leaps onto the luggage rack and curls up on a pile of brightly-coloured raincoats.
“I’ll take him if you like,” Danica says. “He’s got spirit.”
“Please stop guessing,” Harry begs, and Esmee smiles.
“You aren’t wearing your pyjamas,” she says, suddenly filled with anxiety.
Rose gasps and stares up at Harry, distraught. “Uncle Harry! You didn’t hurt the swan? You didn’t?”
“Anyway, this is where the cabin is,” George says, sliding a glossy photograph into the centre of the table. “Angie wants to hike up that fell but I’ve got quite a few other ideas.”
“Have you come to dine with us at last?” she asks, eyes alight with amusement.
Harry starts to get up from the bench but to his astonishment, the swan merely bobs its head for a moment and then continues to reach for the bread.
“Really?”
The green eyes flash behind the glasses. “Nope. You’re not browsing, you’re not buying anything, you’re just being a pain in the arse.”
“He’s mad,” Ron says, but there’s admiration in his voice as he watches Florean skating out into the middle of Diagon Alley, grey waves swaying behind him.
Harry and Draco emerge from the distillery on Saturday afternoon to find Mr Borteg poring over the
The clock on the wall ticks mockingly, reminding him that it is only twenty minutes past eight in the morning and Draco Malfoy has already ruined his day. And he doesn’t care if that sounds ridiculous and dramatic, because there is no one here but him, and besides, it’s the truth. He’s spent the last decade wondering about that idiot, thinking he might have seen him in the street or in the queue at the Apothecary or hurrying into a Muggle sandwich shop, and now he’s everywhere.
“It’s still the best way to travel if you ask me,” Eilish says.
“You don’t sound surprised,” Harry says, and her smile widens until all her gold teeth are visible.
“I like you… I mean… I like it,” Harry mumbles, and just when he thinks he’s going to burst into flames, Draco whips the curtain shut with a slash of his wand and steps close, threading his fingers into Harry’s hair and kissing him hard.
“You won’t tell Ron and Hermione, will you? I mean, not until they come home? I really want them to have a good day and we both know they’ll come running back if they know something’s happened.”
“Yes,” Esmee says, coughing into her handkerchief and granting Harry a watery smile. “I was just about your age, too, and I’d given up on all that romantic nonsense. Then I met that noisy little woman who wouldn’t give up on me. That was fifty years ago, and I have only one regret.”
“Oh, no, this alleyway is too narrow! Breathe in, everyone!” he whispers, hand coming up to grasp the imaginary handle and not realising his mistake until Juno lets out a surprised little sound and there’s the scrape of wood on wood, and someone is coming towards them, backwards and stretched thin in the rearview mirror.
“Really?”
Charlie emerges from the living room. “Did someone call me… Kingsley,
“Thirty, but…” Harry mumbles, frowning.
William glances between them with interest and shrugs. “Aye, they’re a bit flighty, ye ken.”
For a moment there is a wonderful, delighted silence. Luna, Deb and Mary Ann exchange triumphant glances, Harry and Draco continue to stare at each other and the two teachers in the entryway look on with interest. When something crashes to the floor in the corridor beyond, everyone seems to snap back to attention. The teachers grab up their things and scuttle out to deal with the incident and corral their students, Draco retreats back to his own chair and pretends interest in Deb’s magazine once more, and Sam shuffles his papers and attempts to retake command of the room.
“Are those Christmas cards?” Danica asks.
Harry clears his throat. “I was just wondering about that man,” he lies. “Maybe he was brought up by racist, horrible parents, and they were brought up by racist, horrible parents, and it’s just a whole…”
“No,” Harry says, fishing around for a plausible reason for his bad mood. The woman at the Orisha stall waves at him and he waves back, irritated by her amused little smile. His eyes flit around the snowy street until something snags—something that blends almost perfectly with the snow on the fountain. Almost. “The swan’s back.”
Harry laughs, lifting his hands to press against his heated face. Luna pats his shoulder in commiseration. He doesn’t suspect her for a moment.
“I think I will write a letter,” she says, scrambling to her feet and clattering over to pull up a seat at the big oak table.
To his irritation, the two women seem to have shifted in their struggle and the action is now blocked from his view by the corner of a building. He returns to his desk to find that Pansy has left the Prophet there, open at page forty-two.
Luna stares at her friend. “There’s a little bit of Slytherin in you somewhere,” she says, and when Ginny grins, she grins back.
“That was your news update for the hour, there will be more at seven fifteen. In the meantime, Draco has seen fit to join me, and he has brought a friend! More on that after the Minotaurs.”
“Don’t be mean,” Eliza pipes up, clutching onto her cup and her raggedy stuffed dog and peering fiercely at Benny. “I like Harry, too. I think he’s… marbellous.”
“Ah, Harry. I failed to notice you there. My apologies.”
“Of course you do, I just meant… I know Draco from a very long time ago and it just surprises me to hear that about him, I suppose,” Harry admits, suddenly feeling rather at sea.
Harry’s eyebrows lift under his fringe. “Seriously? Ernie Prang, who used to drive the bus?”
Harry snorts. “I think I’ll take that as a compliment. Good luck.”
Potter smiles slowly. “Crocodiles like to swim.”
“That’s a bad Needle,” Draco says, peering down at the swan, who is poking his head out from behind Narcissa’s robes. “He can come with me now. I’m going to open up in a minute and he’ll be sad if he can’t wander around and nibble at people while they eat.”
“Aha,” Draco mutters, drawing close to the window of Cherish and peering inside. “That might just be the one.”
Potter sighs. He replaces the lizard in its tank and turns slowly. “Not really, no.”
“You need to pick him up and hold him like this,” Daraja says, selecting a green sphere and cupping it in her hands. “Let your mind be clear. Then focus on a single image, one that is important. He will guide you in the right direction.”
“She did, but it didn’t matter. Someone like her disappears and five more spring up to take her place,” Harry says, and Draco stares at him as he paces, imagining reporters growing up out of the gap left by Skeeter like some sort of vile journalistic hydra.
After a startlingly delicious breakfast and an even better morning soak in the copper tub, Harry heads home, with a great deal of reluctance, to change his clothes and ensure that number twelve has not crumbled in his absence. He finds an owl waiting on his living room windowsill with an official-looking letter, which he takes into the house and reads by the fire.
“Oh, good. Then you can help me find one,” Draco says, warming to the idea.
“Were you successful?” Mr Borteg asks, but Harry barely hears him.
His eyes meets Harry’s through a fall of pale hair and hold steady with such intention that Harry flushes all over, breath coming quickly now, heart racing out of control as Draco stares and strokes and envelops him in soft heat, rhythm and caress, and he comes with a whimper, hands flying up to cover his face as he tightens and twitches and empties himself into Draco’s mouth.
“Mrs Purley, Reuben, Mr Jennings, Jean, you, Mr Borteg,” Harry recites. “Six people. Is there anything significant about the number six?”
“Nope,” Harry says flatly, and he grabs Draco’s arm and pulls him inside.
“And I am not having a nervous breakdown, so you can stop pretending to be concerned,” Potter says, pulling gently on Brenda’s lead. “This has been interesting and everything, but I promised I’d have her back by one o’clock.”
Gertie gives him a brief, rare smile and then turns back to business. “Mrs Callaghan from Rose Cottage wants her gutters cleaning out. Are youse interested?”
“You thought she wanted...” He pauses, snorting with amusement and then emerging from beneath the towel, mouth stretched into a grin. “You thought she wanted to have her way with you.”
“I can’t quite believe you’re here,” Draco says, abandoning his receipt. “Was my mother nice to you?”
“I’ve seen him,” Tom laughs. “Though I’d like to know, if you’re looking for him, what’s in the box?”
Realising that he is blocking the shelves, he walks slowly around the shop, inspecting beautifully boxed chocolates, shiny bags of treats for children’s Christmas stockings, and a collection of hand-moulded animals so realistic that he almost expects them to move. On the next shelf over, he finds a range of treats that do move. They are new, and he spends several minutes poking them with his wand as instructed by the neatly-written sign and watching cogs spin and gears click. It seems almost impossible that any of it can be made of chocolate, or that anyone could bear to eat it.
“Okay,” Kettleworth says, scribbling in his notepad. “What about alibis?”
“Yeah,” Harry says, bringing his hand to his face and pressing it to his hot skin. “I think I’d better go.”
“Wow, you were brilliant!” Harry says, crouching down and hugging her tightly. “You were the best blue tit I’ve ever seen.”
When Harry steps back into the street, the lights are glimmering all around the windows and Draco is talking quietly to Needle.
“Are you tired of waiting for me?” Draco asks suddenly.
A muffled “Booooo!” comes from the children.
Just a few pages on, there is the picture of Ginny with her Quidditch hero, Jayne Cavendish of Puddlemere United. That one had been a challenge, but Luna had been able to pull together an ‘accidental’ meeting between the two women with a little help from the
“I remember everything,” he says and Harry groans inwardly, embarrassment prickling at the back of his neck. “And you saw me. You shouldn’t have been able to see through that charm, Potter. Why are you always the exception to every fucking rule?”
“What’s a Drenglebacked Gloonpuffer?”
“We know,” Harry and Draco mumble as one, Draco’s eyes catching Harry’s and seeming to glow with amusement.
“Really, Harry? I’ve heard it’s marvellous. Count me in…. that’s if, er, what do you think, Molly, love?”
“Hermione thinks something weird’s going on with you,” Ron admits. “She thinks it’s important that we ‘maintain regular contact’.”
“I think we’re going to find Ida.”
“Yes,” Harry says quickly, “Like your lovely potato gratin. We should have that soon.”
“In that case, you should get it,” Harry says, fingers pressed to the cold glass as something warm and aching takes up residence in his stomach.
Perhaps a gift for goat noises isn’t a fitting talent for a Malfoy. As far as Harry is concerned, that just makes it even more brilliant.
Wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist, Harry closes his eyes tightly and focuses on his destination.
“Maybe you can cook for me some time,” Harry says with more boldness than he really feels.
“He didn’t bite anyone,” Draco says brightly. “And Mrs Purley seemed to like him. She tried to feed him a sandwich.”
“Oh, good,” comes a familiar voice, and when Harry turns around, Florean is nowhere to be seen and Draco is standing right behind him wearing a long green scarf and a weary expression. “An enormous snowman made of ice cream, do you think? A lake of strawberry sauce?”
“So fancy, and she doesn’t bother to mow her lawn,” Corrie whispers as they leave the bus and head cautiously over to the house.
Humming with satisfaction, she pulls out her quill and begins to write.
“Well… I don’t know. I might consider it an early warning sign that there was something very wrong with you,” Harry says, shrugging, and when Draco merely blinks at him, he gives in and places a minty chocolate snowflake cupcake on the dashboard.
Esmee wraps her cardigan around herself more tightly and gives Harry a significant look.
“She’ll want to see us,” Eilish says.
“Harry,” someone calls, and he squints through the rain to see Jean on her doorstep. “Have you got a minute?”
“You said ‘poisson’,” Hermione says. “That’s a fish.”
Draco flicks the cork away with his thumb and pours the oil into his hand, sitting back to stroke a shiny trail over Harry’s chest, his belly and his cock. Harry watches him, drawing up one knee and inhaling the fragrant scent of the oil. It smells fantastic, like wood and spices and leather, and seems to settle and spread inside him until he feels relaxed enough to sink right through the bedclothes and onto the floor.
Harry groans, the sound barely audible above the storm of giggles filling the office.
Not for the first time, Harry silently deplores his lack of tact. “Right. Sorry. What I actually wanted to ask you is whether you ever get stock in sacks like these,” he says, showing Mr Jennings his half of the sample.
At the sound of these words, several people shudder and look around, as though expecting the dread creature to materialise and drop from the sky.
The grass is cool and damp against her feet as she walks slowly along the bank of the stream. Her shoes were discarded hours ago, along with her cardigan, and now she shivers slightly in her sleeveless dress, bag bumping against her thighs with each step.
“See, he’s clever as well,” Grace’s friend whispers, and both women nod approvingly.
“I wasn’t born yesterday, Draco,” Potter mumbles, jabbing at Draco’s feet with spiky bristles until he steps backwards and almost right into the enormous snake. “I’m not giving you material for your show, and I don’t believe that you’ll suddenly stop annoying me if I do.”
“Who presents this man?”
Harry stops. Turns. “It is what it is? That’s your excuse?” He smiles slowly and shrugs. “Why don’t you go and fuck yourself?”
Potter stares at him for a moment, and then: “If you must know, they’re busy. They have lives, Draco. Ron spends almost all of his time at the Ministry and Hermione is taking care of their child and trying to run her own business at the same time. Rose is driving them mad because she’s dying to start school and she doesn’t want to wait until September, she also has chicken pox, and for some reason, they are trying to have another baby.”
“Presents are for Christmas Day,” Danica says sternly.
“Yeah. It’s supposed to make you look thinner and make your skin ‘glow’,” she says, and Harry feels rather than sees her vicious air quotes.
“Because he seemed sad lately,” Sophie says, eyebrows knitted. “Everyone’s on edge with all this stealing going on.”
“Right. Which chair do you want?” Draco asks, sitting in the one nearest the map without waiting for a response.
“I’ll be there,” Harry promises. “And I’ll ask the others tonight. I’m sure they’d love to come.”
“I’ll come with you. I think I could do with a bit of fresh air,” he says, fishing in his pocket and pulling out a handful of greenery. “Come on, Needle.”
“I did it in two and a half minutes,” Ron tells Draco, who stares at him and says nothing.
Stricken, Rose stares at the spider and then at Draco. Harry, too, stares at Draco, wondering why he would introduce the possibility of spidery confusion into their lives. All he knows is that this is Draco’s problem now, and he’d better be the one to fix it.
“Maybe because she thought I looked responsible, unlike people who Apparate off to the middle of nowhere without a moment’s thought,” Draco snaps back.
“Yes, he’s very handsome,” Draco says, adding with a small smile: “And I’m glad to hear that.”
“Hello, Horace,” she says, offering her hand to pull him in. He takes it, and with one hard tug, he and his enormous bag are safely in the room. “How are you?”
“I’ve listened to your show. I was listening yesterday.”
“Boring,” Rose sighs, just before Florean casts a silencing charm and turns to them expectantly.
Something about her reminds Harry sharply of McGonagall and he feels a twinge of guilt, knowing that she will inevitably, some time soon, realise they are missing, but then he remembers Trelawney and the Slytherins and the
Something about the collective sigh from the group tells Harry that this isn’t the first time they have heard Thora’s opinion on the subject. He hovers by the curtain, waiting, and wondering if Draco’s silencing charm isn’t at least a little bit because of Thora’s rather grating voice.
Harry stares at him. “Do I want to know?”
He walks slowly, boots crunching on the grass with every step. He can already see the house in the distance and he smiles to see the smoke curling from the chimney indicating that someone is definitely awake. At the dry stone wall that forms part of the boundary of the property, Harry climbs onto the stile and lingers for a moment.
“I can sew, I can knit, I can embroider,” he says with a little shrug. “I can wrangle wild swans. I’m multitalented.”
“Don’t…” Draco manages, somehow pulling his features into line for a fraction of a second and then losing it again, suppressed amusement spilling from his lips in a cascade.
“My mother…?”
“Your birthday, idiot,” she says, grinning. “It’s today.”
“What’s his name?” Harry asks, taking his seat at the table just in time, as the bus whips around in what seems to be a complete circle.
“I was just a bit surprised,” he says lamely, as she regards him with amusement and then walks away.
“He bit that lady’s bracelet and it exploded,” Rose says, helpfully illustrating the point with her hands.
“Well, yes, I did say that, but maybe that’s not what I really meant,” Draco hisses, turning now to meet his eyes.
“He has. He says she’s
“It’s a mess, but there isn’t much to see,” Draco says, opening the door and holding it open for Harry and Timothy.
“Can I have a humbug?” Harry asks, deciding to chance his arm while Draco is obviously thrown off balance.
“Shall I dry them for you, Jean?” George says, struggling out of the crowd behind Harry. “I’ve got just the thing.”
“Thank you very much,” Harry says, following them to the fireplace and holding out the pot of Floo powder.
“I thought we were leaving Harry alone?” Harry asks, knowing it’s pointless.
“Prefect!” someone hisses, and before Stanley knows what is happening, he is being placed on the cold floor and the boys in green ties are scrambling in all directions.
Harry laughs. “Molly made it. She makes us jumpers every year.”
Narcissa’s mouth flickers at the corners in a smile so like Draco’s that Harry has to look away.
“Any pyjamas,” Luna says. “But guess what they have to be?”
He stares at her, fingers gripping the arms of his chair. “Oh? And I’ll owe you what horrible favour, exactly?”
“It’ll be freezing,” he says. “It’ll probably knock the breath out of you. But you’ll feel better for it, I promise.”

She accepts her dish of ice cream and settles in her seat. “I take it we have some news?”
She clicks off air and skitters a paper bag across the desk towards him. Draco opens it and draws out an apricot Danish. It’s his favourite breakfast treat, and the only way Pansy knows how to apologise.
Harry smiles and decides not to engage. “It’s beautiful, isn’t it?”
Draco laughs. He leans beside Harry on the wall of the bridge. “I’m not sure where even to start with that,” he admits. “A man about town?”
“Are you really going to sit here and just wait and see? I’ve watched you fight a dragon, Potter, I think you can handle the Daily fucking Prophet.”
As far as Draco knows, Potter is an unremarkable mad person who is friends with just about everyone, works in a glorified pet shop and, if the gossip columns are to be believed, has had affairs with everyone from Ginevra Weasley to old Tom from the Leaky Cauldron. If Draco is completely honest, he has no idea why everyone is so obsessed with the man.
Harry walks slowly through the crowds of weekend shoppers, sipping his mulled punch and stopping whenever he feels like it to look at anything that catches his eye. With a vague intention of proving to Esmee that he isn’t one of those young people who leaves everything to the last minute, he has made a list of potential Christmas presents and stuffed it into his coat pocket. In reality, however, he has been wandering around for over an hour already and has failed to buy anything but a cup of hot punch and a bacon sandwich.
“She knew something, didn’t she?” Harry asks suddenly.
Draco opens his mouth to protest—at what, he’s not quite sure—but Potter is already stomping back down the street with his small-not-small crocodile in tow. He watches them until they are out of sight but he doesn’t follow. Instead, he rubs at his wet face with cold, numb hands and sighs before Apparating back to the Manor in search of warm, dry clothes and a distraction. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to matter what he tries, all he can think about is Potter and his stupid crocodile. He flops back onto his bed and stares at the ceiling, letting out all his breath in a messy rush. He knows when he’s beaten these days, and he’s more than that. He’s completely fucked.
“Ron, I do like Avi,” Hermione says, voice raised in frustration. “The point I was making was not ‘I don’t like Avi’, it was that you shouldn’t criticise Harry for being a doormat when you might as well write ‘welcome’ on your forehead.”
Draco blinks. Harry lifts an eyebrow and then turns away, carrying his lunch over to the counter and leaning there with the air of someone who is completely unconcerned about whether or not someone else wants to order some slightly fancier straw.
Draco says nothing, which Harry thinks is wise, because he is clearly trying not to laugh. The next customer through the door stares openly at the velvet suit and becomes so distracted that he struggles to remember what he came in for. When Jean bustles in to see if they are nearly ready, she turns quite red with the effort of keeping her thoughts to herself, but Mr Borteg doesn’t seem to notice. He shuffles through his prompt cards and mutters to himself until it’s time to go, and when he leaves the shop, Harry, Draco and Rose laugh until they are breathless.
“Oh, don’t tell him off,” Miss Lister says, slipping her bracelet back on and bending to stroke Needle. “He didn’t mean any harm, did you?”
“Why don't you put the lights up?”
“I don’t know,” Harry says, but he tells him anyway.
Mr Borteg looks up from his inspection of the Orisha cube, still holding the little object between spindly finger and thumb.
“What kind of person is jealous of sick children?” Draco demands, getting out of his chair and pacing the flags.
Esmee gazes at the cameo for long seconds and then tucks it away, glancing at the door as though Shan might burst in at any moment, and Harry supposes she might.
“Do you think so?” Rose asks, chewing her lip.
“Hello,” he says, smiling at Corrie, Ida, and Eilish and finding an admiring look for Danica when she takes up her chair and gives him a shrewd little nod.
“This is amazing,” Hermione says, walking through the bottom deck and looking around at everything: the chandelier, the tea set, the quirky armchairs and the paintings of Juno.
The four of them clink glasses and Ron excuses himself to collect the shepherd’s pie from the oven. Harry stares at his wine without really seeing it, feeling as though he’s been knocked off his broom in midair. He doesn’t know what exactly is surprising about this feeling, but it’s almost too much to contain, and Marius’s warm laughter beside him makes his heart hurt with longing, closely followed by guilt. He seems like a nice man, and it’s certainly not his fault that Ron and Hermione are relentless and that he is keeping things from them.
“I’m not... interested,” he says at last, adding grandly, “And I am leaving now.”
“He was a bit strange, actually—the Egyptian man,” he admits. “He was very nice but he would only talk in whispers because he thought there were goblins in the walls… listening.”
Draco grants him a serene smile and then turns to watch the bonfire. “Yes. And so is forcing someone to put up a tent before they get married, but I imagine that both things have their place in the world.”
“I’ve heard that one before.”
“Aye, most of it,” the man says. “She’s always been stubborn. My mother’s known her since she was a bairn, ye ken, and she’s always liked to do things her way. Don’t tell her I said that, though,” he adds, eyes flicking to the bar and then back to Harry. “I’m William McIntyre.”
“Nothing in the notes, but yesterday, I’m pretty sure he was the only person who missed the wedding. He wears boots that could easily have made those prints…” Harry gnaws on his nail as he thinks. “And he does sometimes get cross with kids in his shop.”
As it turns out, Draco has no plans to make this easy for him. At ten o’clock, he stalks into the shop with Needle and by quarter past, he is perching on Rose’s desk and making a nuisance of himself.
, Harry thinks, but he doesn’t say so. “So you all… come and ride on the bus and Draco just drives you around?”
“Mm,” Harry says, blinking in the darkness and walking very slowly in the direction of the cabin.
The rain is pounding against the roof and windows by the time Draco seems satisfied with his work, and it is all Harry can do not to grab him and pull him down onto the hearthrug where he stands. All of his weariness and discomfort have dissolved and he feels as though he could do anything.
Harry follows his eyes over to the set of little pigeon holes and sighs. “Forms to fill in, so you can get a passport or a driving licence or insurance... look, shall we buy something to eat?”
“She’s beautiful,” he says, and Eilish beams.
“Black,” Harry says with a grin.
“That’s just horrible,” Harry says, and a murmur of agreement travels around the table.
“Well, it’s not the first time I’ve been accused of that,” Lee says, shuffling his wizened form into the studio and thrusting a sheaf of parchments into Draco’s hands.
“No,” Harry says, rubbing his hot face with both hands. “After the war... everything was supposed to be different. It was supposed to be about acceptance... forgiveness... starting again. God knows every speech I had to make said so. And yet here we are... we find a little bit of peace and it gets ruined. Everything’s... aren’t you fed up, Draco? I’m fed up. I’m extremely fucking fed up.”
Ron blinks. “Of course not. Harry, tell Hermione I didn’t forget my child.”
“Where are you going?” Harry mumbles, frowning and reaching for him.
Harry laughs. “That’s me. Listen, doesn’t it bother you that no one we spoke to yesterday saw anything on either of these days? Nothing suspicious at all?”
Harry laughs. He can’t help it. Around him, his family continue to discuss his need for a young man, nice or otherwise, who is classy and respects his mother. Resignedly, he eats his roast potatoes and pretends he can’t hear them.
“Does she?” Harry asks faintly, feeling as though he might just be descending into madness.
“Hermione gave me this thing for the bath,” he says, knowing there’s no way out. “You drop it in and it fizzes and throws out all this stuff. It honestly didn’t occur to me to look in the mirror before I came out.”
“I think you’re rather missing the point,” he says, sea green fading to palest peppermint and clearly betraying the anxiety that he doesn’t want to show.
Draco’s eyes slide down the street to Jennings’ Quills, where the windows are still thick with soot.
“Please stop worrying about it,” Draco says, and his voice is so kind that Harry’s words of protest disappear into the cool air. “There must be more things that link these people.”
“Why wouldn’t I be surprised?” Harry asks, grinning.
“No, but that strange man from the joke shop will sell you a powder to do it!”
had nothing to do with this, but Mr Malfoy, I distinctly remember telling you that you were not permitted to enter the patient’s room yesterday.”
Harry laughs. “In one way or another, yeah. Sometimes there’s Jesus, sometimes there’s a jellyfish.”
of it, do you know how long it would take to buy a piano?”
“What sort of an accent is that?” Draco wonders aloud.
“That is a very negative attitude, Marmaduke,” Esmee reproves, and Mr Jennings sighs.
“You need to put some paper at the bottom,” Harry advises. “The fire needs to—”
Harry opens his eyes, taking a moment to adjust to the swooping feeling of their Apparation. Through the driving rain, he can just about make out a familiar red, green and yellow logo, and the sign that reads:
“She’d never know,” Ron says with confidence. “It wouldn’t be my first time having two Sunday dinners.”
?” Harry repeats, irritation spiking in his chest.
Draco’s eyes catch his over the table and he shrugs, mouth flickering and pulling Harry’s along with it. He has no idea what is wrong with his family but he loves them, and that’s all that matters.
“I’ll drink to that,” Harry mumbles. “Something warm, preferably.”
They stand in the shallows, barely breathing, as something gargantuan rises slowly from the depths, spraying them both with cold water and sending up a hiss of spray so fierce that Draco has to close his eyes. When he opens them again, the Giant Squid is towering above the surface of the water, tentacles tracing slow arcs through the air. Just above the great eyes, dripping and gleaming in the first weak rays of sunshine, is a willow-patterned beetle wearing six tiny snowboots.
“We heard everything,” Danica says. “He’s just cross now. He’ll calm down.”
“Of life?” Harry guesses, accustomed by now to reading between the lines.
“He is with us when we soar on our brooms,” Ginny says.
“Absolutely,” Timothy says, amending his notes. “Were you there on your own?”
“No,” Harry says, knowing that if he stays even another minute he’ll do something impulsive and stupid. “I can’t do this, Draco, I just can’t. I’m sorry.”
“I was just coming to look for you,” he says.
… my nephew had it,” Harry manages, opening one eye. Feeling renewed sympathy for the little boy who had had no idea what was happening to him, he struggles into an upright position. “Has anyone got any Pepper-Up?”
charm against his throat.
“She’s been here since four,” Draco says, and he suppresses a yawn, which Harry immediately catches.
Harry stifles a smile and continues to write, attempting to get down all the important points even as everyone talks over each other and digressions are frequent. He’s not the most natural note-taker but it feels important to offer something to the process, to take back a little bit of power from a person who doesn’t deserve it, and to stand with his friends in their time of need.
Harry looks at him, ignoring his pleading expression and the snowflakes on his eyelashes.
“Actually, Professor, I was just about to leave. I don’t have any lessons this afternoon and I was going to have lunch in Hogsmeade with—”
“And Draco,” Luna adds, and Harry’s glimmer roars around him.
“But that means someone is letting it into the Leaky Cauldron from the Muggle entrance
“Seventy-eight countries so far,” Harry says, shrugging. “But you don’t really see them properly when you’re working, and I do work, whatever you might think. Thing is, I’ve barely travelled here at all. I haven’t even been to Scotland for anything except school.”
Luna nods. “Alright.”
Harry thanks him and leaves, knowing he’s said all the wrong things. No doubt Draco is charming everyone on his side of the street without even trying. When he enters the café, Mrs Purley’s bright smile lifts his mood effortlessly.
Draco drops the parchment and leans back in his chair. “That’s the part you would focus on? Not the sharp objects and the exploding mammals?”
It all makes sense. All of it, even the part where he’s having sex with Draco Malfoy on the top deck of a magical bus while the sky is lit up in swathes of green and blue and gold.
“It’s so nice to see you all,” Molly says, poking at the kettle with her wand to make it boil faster.
“Never?” Hermione asks, sounding scandalised.
“He’s been great. We’ve had some very rewarding conversations.”
When the shop door swings open, Harry draws his wand and hurriedly collects all the pearls before they create a tripping hazard.
“Get them involved,” Ginny says. “Kids love doing anything a bit weird. And not only that… no one can say no to a child rattling a bucket at them. You’ll probably make enough for a whole orchestra.”
“We need to start immediately. Harry, can you spare her?”
“I have to go,” he says, and there’s a tug in his voice that makes Harry both disappointed and relieved. “They’re seven hours ahead. I’m supposed to be speaking at this ridiculous conference in about twenty minutes, and I think we both know I can't go looking like this.”
“I don’t know,” she says, leaning back in her chair and crossing one leg over the other. She shrugs, letting one of her vicious-looking shoes dangle from her toes. “You look a bit pathetic this morning.”
“I can see why you didn’t want to miss that,” he says at last.
Harry grins, tucking a strand of pale hair behind Draco’s ear. “He could try.”
“That’s true.”
“You know what makes me sad, Draco?” Pansy says, and he groans and flops back into his chair.
“Okay. We could go for a walk,” Harry suggests. “All the lights are on in London and it looks really nice.”
In these moments, Draco is a vibrant sea green, and he is only growing stronger. Volunteering seems to bring out the best in him, and Luna doesn’t know why everyone seems so surprised by that fact. Doing nice things for other people is good for the soul, and being terrified and angry all the time… just isn’t. As far as she can see, it’s simple, but then she has so often been told that she doesn’t see things the way that other people do.
“Why do you give a fuck about this?” he demands. “We were fine without you and we’ll be fine again once you’ve lost interest.”
“The evidence does seem rather compelling,” Mr Borteg says, but Harry barely hears him.
Nonplussed, Harry gazes into the window, too. “What are we looking at?”
It’s still raining heavily when Harry leaves the house the next afternoon. After a moment’s hesitation, he grabs an umbrella from the stand in the hallway and heads out into the street where he stands, uncertain, for several minutes, letting the rain bounce off the fabric above his head and fighting the sudden urge to scurry back inside.
“Life? Existence? Or something more specific?”
“I can see perfectly well,” Corrie insists, and Harry smiles to himself.
“It’s only impossible because you’re thinking about it too much,” Harry puts in.
“It’s Lancashire hotpot,” Harry corrects. “Angelina chose this because when she went to play for Lancashire, she sort of fell in love with it. It’s a proper northern dish.”
“In which case, perhaps it’s Reuben
“Is he alright?” Harry asks as they walk to Borteg’s without the need for discussion.
“You stole it,” Harry teases. He coughs, scowls, and soothes his sore throat with a gulp of hot tea.
“There is no doubt that they are strong, but this is a great loss,” Mr Borteg sighs.
“They sent me grapes,” Ida says, holding up a large bunch and a scrap of parchment. “Grapes, and a note saying it might be best for me to sell the house now.” She screws up her face. “They know I don’t like grapes.”
“The bus,” Harry repeats, fingers slipping on the bar. “Would you like me to go and make it less visible?”
“Nice dress, Potter,” he says as he steps into the Magical Menagerie the following afternoon.
Draco bites his lip. “Does it matter? I bought them and I used them. My customers said they were very nice.”
“I know,” Hermione says, picking up the bowl of cheese and hugging it to her chest. “It’s just that when you do something like that I feel all…” She shrugs wordlessly.
“Any news, lads?” Jean asks, appearing in the doorway of Eeylops.
The pub is busier than the deserted, rain-swept street had suggested, and Harry finds himself wondering if the entire population of Strath Kinna is now contained within these four walls, taking up almost all of the small round tables and consuming plates of delicious-smelling food. Several of the diners glance up at the sight of Harry and Draco, only to return to their meals with barely a flicker of interest, something which Harry finds rather refreshing. A gentle murmur of conversation hangs over the whole scene, wrapping Harry in a rather wonderful sense of serenity.
Draco smiles and closes his eyes. Harry watches him for a moment, heart full and light.
Harry peers up the street, squinting against the morning sunlight. Every window in sight is covered in thick black dust, and he can’t imagine that the shops at the top of the street have escaped Mr Jennings’ attention.
Rose giggles and Harry smiles at them both from behind the counter. When Mr Borteg had first agreed to this unusual arrangement, he hadn’t been worried, but he certainly hadn’t expected an instant friendship to spring up between the clever little girl and the bizarre, brilliant man. They make an odd pair, one all bright red hair and giggles and the other a walking Halloween decoration, but they share a pure, burning sort of curiosity that makes them nothing less than kindred spirits.
“I can’t,” Eilish says brightly from somewhere near his left ear.
“Daddy’s out looking for bad potions,” Rose says, looking up from her book.
Pansy drops the needle onto the record and stares at Draco and Harry in turn. She picks up her pastry and takes a bite, brushing icing sugar from her lips.
“The two of you are… oh, dear.”
“I’m afraid she will be returning to the Ministry after today,” Florean says regretfully. “I suspect they think someone like her is a little bit high level for our situation.”
Without the help of heels, Shan has to reach up on her tiptoes to kiss her new wife, but Esmee reaches down to her and they meet in the middle, pressing their lips together and then dissolving into giggles. Behind them, there’s a rustle and a whoosh and a cloud of frost-bright butterflies swarm into the air, fluttering with jingling wings and then settling gently on the arch of poinsettias.
She shakes out the blanket over her knees. Harry reaches out and strokes the soft wool.
“Er… no,” Harry admits. “I’ll take all the help I can get, though.”
“Not really,” Luna says, not bothering to hide her amusement. “You’re rarely away for long enough to miss anything.”
“Draco,” she’ll declare, curling into his side with her stiletto heels tucked up onto yet another velvet banquette, “you’ll never find anyone to fuck if you sit there looking like you’ve forgotten which drawer you keep your balls in.”
“We’ve been listening,” the lady in the green coat says brightly.
Mr Jennings fiddles with the catch on his wooden box. “I’ve started another collection but I was wondering… how many times does this have to happen before we’re all just essentially moving our money back and forth?”
As he tries to remember the words to the next verse, the bus comes to a halt and Draco pushes the curtain aside, standing and staring at them all with Montague at his heels.
“Shall we have a glass of wine?” Hermione says, and Harry takes his seat at the table and allows her to fill his glass without a word, because he’s in love with Draco, and ten thousand Mariuses couldn’t turn his head now.
“Oh my goodness,
“And where, pray tell, are your coats?” the old woman demands suddenly.
,” Rose sings quietly, getting out her drawing of Needle and sharpening her pencil crayons.
“Where did she get it?” Luna asks, intrigued.
“Sorry to interrupt, but I have to run out to the market,” Harry says, and both men look at him as though startled to see him standing there. “Does anybody need anything?”
“Shh,” she says, looking like a very tiny but very stern librarian. “Listen nicely. You might even be in it.”
“Oh!” Mary Ann gasps and quickly presses a button, leaving the courtyard in silence.
Draco looks up at her, small smile weary but genuine, and then his eyes flick to Harry and Luna is temporarily blinded by the surge of scarlet and green light that results. The pulse of longing that stretches between the two of them is intense enough to leave her breathless, and when she glances at Sam and Mary Ann, she is bewildered to see them engaged in conversation as though nothing so momentous is happening right in front of them. Sometimes, people are… strange.
“Aren’t you going to?” Victoire asks, pouring gravy over her potatoes.
“It’s... it’s to wrap around things that are fragile for when you want to move them around, like if you’re moving house or if you’re sending them through the post,” Harry explains, trying to keep his voice down. He has the feeling that gossip spreads quickly in a place like Strath Kinna, and he doesn’t really fancy being known by all the villagers as ‘those two lads who don’t know what bubble wrap is’.
“Have some faith,” Draco says. “Everyone here is working as hard as they can.”
“It’s for Rose,” Harry says, grinning.
“Does she know how you feel?”
“Oh, but you are not!” she declares, holding up a spindly finger. “You seek companionship, truth, loyalty with Draco Malfoy, but this will only lead to misery... the spirits have foretold a different path for you, my dear, and should you stray from it...”
Harry leaps into its path and manages to gather it, squirming, into his arms just in time. The puppy plants enormous black paws on his shoulders and matter-of-factly sticks its nose into his ear.
“He’s back,” Draco announces, striding into the shop and sending the little bell almost jingling off its fastenings.
“Well, she is rather… has she been here long? We’d better go and say hello,” Draco says, catching Harry’s wrist and urging him towards the house before Ginny has time to reply.
Harry sits up straight. “I didn’t pay for that toastie.”
“Marvellous. Now, where do you want to go?”
It’s painfully clear that he is trying to hide his surprise, and Harry rather irrationally wants to smile.
“I don’t know.”
“She’s really pretty,” Benny mumbles, staring up at Ginny, who just grins.
“Five more minutes,” Francis nods, looking rather perky for someone has essentially been talking to himself all night. “I’ve got that Neptunians record on. Seven and a half minutes long, it is. Good on them, it’s a brilliant coffee-breaker.”
“Didn’t you pay attention in Muggle Studies? That’s a twenty pund note, that is.”
“Of course we know. You’ve been acting very oddly,” Hermione says. “And then there was the cat hair, and the fact that you’re out all the time even though you’re not doing a campaign. We know you, Harry.”
Her words go straight to Harry’s chest, twisting his heart and making his next words catch in his throat.
Harry doesn’t need to be asked twice. Before five minutes have passed, they are sitting on a bench with food and hot punch, comparing notes.
Mr Borteg glances at his feet with interest but says nothing as Harry dries his socks with a spell and laces up the shoes, all the while balancing Hugo against his hip.
“I know,” she says, “but if I could find a way to raise the money… would you consider it?”
Harry heaves a theatrical sigh. Beside him, Draco looks at the floor and smiles to himself. Luna slips a hand into her bag, squeezes her notebook hard, and hopes.
“Okay, but...” Harry says, just as Draco hurries out into the street.
Draco sighs. “Well, you know... at least for tonight.”
“Why do they always listen to you?” Draco grumbles, shrugging on his long coat and winding a grey scarf around his neck.
He can still taste his cherry-chocolate-almond ice cream from the day before, and as he takes off his coat, stokes the fire and heads behind the counter, he wonders if he will ever go back to honeycomb and fudge sauce. It’s still delicious, but he feels different somehow. Clever old Florean.
“I heard youse’re leaving,” he says. “Thanks for all youse’ve done.”
After all, no one has tried to reach him with an owl, not even Professor McGonagall. Owls can find anyone. They always found Sirius. Harry sighs.
“Fine,” Draco says, and though his tone is light, his expression is rather satisfied. “And I don’t want to talk about how I came to be here. Deal?”
“On fire?” Harry asks, looking around for a parent to confirm this statement.
“It’s nine-thirty in the morning, of course I’m not,” Draco says, but he indicates the immaculate garment bag draped over the chair next to him. “I’ll be ready. By twelve o’clock. Not ten past,” he adds, quirking half a smile in Deb’s direction.
“Some company would do her good,” Shan says, voice tinged with exasperation. “I’ve got her upstairs in the flat, drinking Pepper-up, but I think she’s got cabin fever already. She’s got books and all sorts but you know how she gets when she’s bored.”
Harry grins. “I think that’s probably the right answer.”
Draco regards him solemnly. “Noted.”
“You don’t want to know,” Draco says drily, and Tom looks even more curious.
“Timothy just owled me,” he explains, holding up the parchment with its Ministry insignia. “Mr Jennings has been charged, processed, and sent to the holding cells for the night. If I write back and tell them about the mess he left behind, they might leave him in there until Boxing Day.”
“Indeed. What do you want to do?”
“There’s more,” Draco says. “Felicity suggests a vote. Florean institutes major planning protocol, i.e. six votes needed to defeat the motion. Motion defeated.”
“I think Needle knew something was going on,” Draco says suddenly. “There was no sound, but he started up the most dreadful hissing and crackling. That’s what woke me up.”
By the time the last of too many funerals has been held, Harry is exhausted. For more days than he wants to admit, he lies on his bed in the topmost room of the Burrow while the sun creeps in through the window, blazes over his skin, melts into blunt colours and then darkness.
and then she turns up, and…”
“Neither is that.”
Harry sighs, gulping his tea and pulling his feet up onto the chair in an attempt to make himself as small as possible. He watches the rain hammering against the window, feeling like a tiny island in the middle of the vast kitchen. He won’t be on his own for long, though. Bill, Neville, Ron, and Lee will have to drag themselves out of bed for work soon, and the others are unlikely to hang around for long after breakfast. Everyone has responsibilities, and no amount of Dragon Spirit will put off schedules and meetings and children.
Harry wrinkles his nose. “That’s… yeah. I didn’t know either, if it helps.”
With the rescued presents stored safely in Sage’s pantry, Harry and Draco go to help Mr Borteg but find the shop empty.
He asks, of course, about Potter’s campaign of madness—why he’s wearing a top hat, why he decided to walk all the way to work backwards, whether or not Brenda will be making a reappearance—but all too easily he finds himself making more prosaic inquiries about Potter’s plans for the evening, his family of Weasels, what kind of sandwich filling he actually likes best.
“Let me help you find that whisky,” Harry offers, and the customer follows him over to the shelves.
“It’s just me, then,” Draco says eventually, emerging from his hiding place and crossing his arms.
“We like you, too, Harry,” Luna says, smiling at him.
He holds Stanley still and looks around, waiting for inspiration to hit him. His eyes settle on Draco’s inkpots and he smiles. Putting a finger to his lips, he reaches for his wand and slides lower in his chair, letting his arm drop and casting as carefully as he can. He holds his breath, waiting for Draco to look up and ask him what the actual fuck he is doing, but as the lids slowly unscrew themselves from the pots, his eyes don’t leave his marking.
“Yes,” Harry says, watching as Needle flings his paper cup into the air. “All birds are delightful and all people who like them are incapable of committing crimes.”
It’s always so easy to believe that she doesn’t need any help from anyone, and he knows that as soon as everything is back to normal, she will hate the fact that she made herself so vulnerable, but Hermione Granger-Weasley is mortal and fallible and sometimes she needs a good friend to carry the load for her, even if it’s just for a little while.
“I’m going to bring you a menu so you can see what we actually serve,” Draco says, reaching out and pulling Harry’s hand away from his mouth. “Stop it.”
As the comforting smells of roasted meat, herbs, and gravy fill the kitchen, the family mills around happily, sharing news over hot cups, helping where they are permitted, and searching out bits of gossip for trade. Harry doesn’t like the way Ron, Hermione and George keep looking over at him and then whispering, so he does the mature thing and pretends they aren’t there. He sits at the table beside Rose, who is beavering away at some extra work for her maths club, which Hermione proudly tells him is completely her own choice. Like mother, like daughter, Harry supposes. Then again, he has watched Rose work many a time with her tongue poking out of the corner of her mouth, just like Ron when he’s filling in forms.
Draco glances at him cagily. “Excuse me?”
“I can see that,” Draco says, wondering why in the name of all that is logical he is having this conversation. He could just leave. He could just close his mouth and walk right out of this shop. Potter would think he’s an idiot, but Potter already thinks he’s an idiot and he has no idea why it matters anyway. “The thing is,” he says, because apparently he is still talking, “when someone is a shut-in, they’re usually just in one place. Shut in.”
Pansy trails into silence for a moment and Draco hurries over to the window, carrying his omnivox with him.
Unfortunately, his attempt at explaining as much just seems to make the ragged man crosser, and Stanley flees before the broom, clacky shoes echoing on the stone. He runs around the little room three times in panic before the door swings open and he scuttles to freedom. Out in the corridor, he runs until his legs are aching and the tinsel is slipping from his shell and tripping him up with every step. Finally, tired and feeling very sorry for himself, he tucks himself into the skirting under a wooden bench and crouches there, wondering if the tree has its sparkles yet and wishing he had never run away from home.
“No, you cannot. They already like you better than they like me and it’s ridiculous,” Draco snaps, pulling a sweet from his pocket, crinkling the wrapper obnoxiously and stuffing it into his mouth.
Draco’s voice catches Harry’s attention the moment he and Rose emerge from the Leaky’s brick archway and he looks around, eventually spotting him outside the Apothecary, where Reuben is stacking crates into his arms.
“He’ll be confused when he wakes up, but at least he won’t sting Stanley,” he says. He eyes the beetle with such sternness that Draco has to smile. “Don’t play with wasps.”
“Sleep now,” he murmurs, just as Harry’s eyes fall closed and he allows the wave of contentment to wash him away. “I missed you.”
Harry smiles back and says something, anything; he has no idea because his friends have finally chosen someone who seems wonderful in every way, and all he can think about is Draco. About his stash of
“The front door, I think,” Jean says, scowling. “I put a better locking spell on it but those things have never been my strong point.” She brightens. “He didn’t get into my till, though, did he?”
“Delivery day,” Harry interrupts, shaking his head. “They were all round the back getting the barrels from the cart.”
Her best friend of all, of course, lives with her in the tall, happy house at the top of the gentle slope, and she turns instinctively, just in time to see a shower of green sparks from the attic window. She smiles and pulls out her wand, sending up an identical shot of sparks in return. He is well, and now he knows that she is, too. Some people have wondered—often when they think she isn’t listening—why she doesn’t move out and find a place of her own. It’s been more than two years since the end of the war, after all, they say; she has a job and most of an education, but Luna doesn’t care. Her father is happier when she is around. His colours glow in rich, golden shades of yellow when he knows she is safe, and she doesn’t think she could stand to see him so pale and frightened again.
“... garden’s a state, ye know... needs a firm hand... and there’s a hole in the roof that’s in dire need of some attention. Two strong lads like yourselves should no have a problem. I’ll make sure youse are fed, ye ken,” she says, regarding them shrewdly. “Proper hot meals at the Trout, none of your junky rubbish.”
Thursday races by in a flurry of festive activity, with the biddies hunched over Christmas cards and Draco adding yet more decorations to the bus in between picking up flung fruit and shoving it into any compartment he can reach. Harry is quickly assigned a variety of tasks including, but not restricted to, tea-making, keeping the idling engine warm, and attaching tinsel to the wriggling forms of Juno and Montague.
“Relationships between… people… are far from my area of expertise, Harry,” Mr Borteg says, offering him a fountain pen made from gleaming onyx. “In this case, however, I imagine that a conversation or two would benefit both parties.”
Draco frowns. “It’s not quite as simple as that.”
“The cabin’s yours, then?” Harry asks, sipping his pint.
“Why not?” Harry asks, in spite of his better judgement.
“He’s still got all his boots!” he says, astonished. “I can’t believe they stayed on.”
Something about the man’s earnest expression tickles Harry and he has to turn away for a moment. Behind the bar, Tom is grinning like a loon and not helping one bit.
People are looking, and Draco can’t blame them. He thinks Potter is pretending not to notice, which just makes the whole thing even more bewildering.
“Daddy touched a big bone,” Rose announces, and Harry bites his lip hard to suppress his laughter.
“Nowhere special,” Draco says, nudging the bus in front of a large coach. “Just the usual evening out—fire, alligators, that sort of thing.”
When Draco lowers himself to the floor beside him, he just sighs.
Draco makes a pointless swipe at his hair as the wind whips it in every direction.
Draco looks up from his seat at the end of the Slytherin table and meets Harry’s eyes wearily.
“And finally,” he says, master of ceremonies mask firmly back in place. “You must construct a shelter, without the use of magic, for when you inevitably displease your wife and she makes you sleep in the garden without your wand.”
“No,” Harry says, and his eyes definitely aren’t stinging. “It’s romantic. She’s going to be really happy.”
“Coffee fudge,” Draco says, and she looks up, feeling his eyes on her. “His favourite.”
Professor Trelawney often used to say that Luna had all the makings of a true Seer, but she was wrong. Luna isn’t interested in predicting the future. She lives in the here and now, partly because it’s the best way, and partly because you never really know how much here and now you’re going to get before you’re over and done with.
, she writes, picturing the imaginary Mr Scruton as a tall, dandified man with a velvet top hat and a cloak for every occasion.
Draco says nothing, but his smile is bright in the darkness.
“All of the above, probably,” Draco says crossly. “I’ve never tried before.”
“You’re deplorable, the lot of you,” Draco mumbles, and then he shoves his buckets at Harry and drops casually into a series of loose, fluid spins that look utterly effortless until he slightly loses his footing on the cobbles and has to perform a complicated little leap to steady himself. “Cobbles are not made for ballet,” he says, taking back his buckets, but he smiles when several people from the crowd break into spontaneous applause and throw yet more coins into his bucket.
“What are you reading?” Draco asks, smiling at Harry as he passes on the way to his chair.
Despite his inefficiency, he feels oddly serene as the snow falls softly around him and dusts the shoulders of the skaters on the ice. He stops to watch them, hands wrapped tightly around his hot cup, and smiles to himself at the memory of Draco’s attempts to stay upright. Harry sighs, and his breath sends spicy steam spiralling into the cold air. It’s all so clear now, and though the weight of it makes every step that little bit harder, Harry doesn’t care. He loves this inexplicable man, with his terrible jokes and his stalking walk and his pure, unashamed reverence for his mother. He loves Draco, and it feels comfortable and brand new at the same time, like hearing your favourite song after years of self-imposed silence. Idly, Harry wonders what sort of song Draco would be and then stops when there’s a rustle and a brief count and then the sound of perfectly harmonised voices.
“What about Granger and the Weasel?” he asks after a moment.
“I’m not scared of you,” Ron says.
There’s a pop and a rustle and Draco crawls out just in time to see an explosion of silver glitter from the engine. The shimmering particles seem to hover in the air for a moment and then rain down all around them, covering the path, the back of the bus, and Draco. Wearing the weariest expression Harry has ever seen, he pulls himself into a sitting position and sighs, letting the glitter waft around him and stick fast to his wet skin.
After lunch, William heads out to the Land Rover and returns moments later with a small wooden crate, which he places on the floor next to their table.
“So do I,” Danica says, and the others cackle delightedly, while Corrie slaps her friend on the shoulder with a knitting needle.
“Did you?” asks a little girl with long black plaits, eyes fixed on the bag of books.
“But it’s not… dark?” he asks, and the woman meets his eyes steadily.
“He’s in
“In that case, I say we make a run for it,” Draco says, making Harry turn to him in surprise. “I can’t get the bus any closer without blocking the lane for everyone else, so let’s just get inside and dry whatever needs to be dried when we get there.”
“Carmella had her kittens,” he says, breathing hard. “I couldn’t leave her until I made sure they were all out alright. I’m so sorry. You both look beautiful.”
He lets himself in at the back door. When Hermione sees the bunch of carrots, she beams and hugs him, treating him to a mouthful of hair and a wet spatula to the side of the face.
It is, of course, a work of art. The lacy exterior, designed to melt only in the mouth, is a riot of glossy dark, milk and white chocolate, with dashes of vibrant orange and caramelised nuts. He can smell the spices already, and the desire to shove the whole thing in his mouth is only outweighed by the knowledge that doing so will make him feel extremely sick.
“Shut up,” Draco mutters, gently dislodging the swan from his coat. “Needle, be good.”
“See you all tomorrow,” he calls, watching them disappear into the night.
“Why don’t you make your own cakes?” she asks, and Corrie sighs loudly.
Harry glances at Kettleworth, wondering if he will continue to resist Jean, or if he will do the sensible thing, which is ‘as he is told’. Jean is a lovely lady who will do anything for anyone, but she has a core of steel and has faced down many a stronger opponent than him over the years. To his relief, Kettleworth nods meekly and Harry gestures to him.
Draco hands him the coin and he examines it in disbelief. “I used to have one just like this.”
Harry blinks repeatedly, waiting for the world to come back into focus.
“Look at that! Good as new!” Ron says, grinning.
As he speaks, it finally occurs to Harry that he is quite a bit more comfortable than usual, and that is perhaps because his spring-loaded metal conductor’s chair has been replaced by something wonderful. Setting down the box, he scrambles to his feet to examine it.
“I’m sorry for causing so much trouble. Again.”
“I did not expect that to happen today,” Draco admits.
“Maybe half of one,” Draco says, letting himself in to the empty restaurant and holding the door open for Harry. “I have no idea how long it will take everyone to make their way up here and I thought a locked door might send the wrong message.”
Draco files the information away for later and turns to look at Harry.
Draco smiles but says nothing. Seconds later, they turn a corner to find a beautiful, frost-covered village set out before them. The snow might have turned to slush in London, but here, every building, wall and hedgerow is covered in pure, sparkling white and the ground beneath their feet glitters in the midday sunshine. Without the shelter of multiple tall buildings, the bitter wind slices around them, making Harry grateful for his hat, however ridiculous it might look.
**~*~**
At the sound of Harry’s footsteps, he turns and smiles.
“Where did you spring from?” he demands, hand now uncomfortably warm. “And how do you know about this stuff?”
Draco doesn’t have an answer for that, and good grief, he’s glad Pansy isn’t here.
“There’s nothing wrong with him,” Harry insists, lowering his voice. “I’m a bit blindsided, though; couldn’t you have given me some warning that he was going to be here?”
Draco shrugs and levitates the packages up through the trapdoor. “Maybe.”
“Wring its neck, did you?” laughs a passer-by in what Harry thinks is a very stupid hat.
Jean shrugs. “It was late. Everyone was at home or in bed. I didn’t see any use in raising a fuss. Oh, don’t look at me like that, Harry. I’m a tough old boot.”
“What shall we do with it?” Danica asks, edging round the table and kneeling beside Harry with impressive nimbleness.
“I’m an idiot, aren’t I?” he mumbles, and Esmee laughs. And coughs.
Perhaps he should tell Pansy his suspicions and just send her into their studio. Wind her up and let her go, so to speak. He’s done it before, and the results are always entertaining.
“It’s one of us, Florean,” Harry says, getting the words out as quickly as he can. “Someone from the street is doing this.”
He hasn’t yet seen any ducks in the Magical Menagerie, which means that Potter will have to order one in. Such an undertaking will buy him some extra time in the shop, and one more duck in his collection won’t be any trouble at all. He doesn’t know why he hasn’t thought of it before.
Harry glances at him, frowning. “I know.”
my mother and didn’t learn how to make bits of fur disappear?”
“You’re listening to the breakfast show with Pansy Parkinson and... oh, here he is,” she says, looking up and eyeing him speculatively. “Draco has arrived at last...”
He sighs. “She’s given us a lot of stuff... you know... food and things.”
To his astonishment, Draco reaches out and touches the back of his hand to Harry’s forehead. The contact makes him shiver and he takes a step back, pretending offence.
Harry draws his wand and freezes the wasp in mid-air with a spell that tastes like burnt metal. He picks it up carefully and propels it towards the forest.
