Harry hesitated.  “If it’s okay.”
“It disbanded.”
It was a joke. No one laughed. A camera clicked. Then another. Click, click, click.
“World’s gone to shit, hasn’t it.” It wasn’t really a question, and Malfoy still was steadfastly not looking at him. “Did you ever think we would come to this? The fact that we’re even discussing Fudge as Minister of Magic makes me—well. It makes me think I know how you must have felt fifth year, when you said the Dark Lord was back, and no one would fucking take it seriously.”
“I meant,” Harry said.  “I’m not used to . . . being sick.”
“They all merit mentions!” said Savage, still too loud.
Draco had been a child.  A child, and Harry had forgiven him so long ago.  He’d not forgot—Harry was never going to forget; it shouldn’t be forgot, neither by Harry nor by Draco, but Draco had changed.  He’d changed so much, into the person who had told Harry it was immoral to Polyjuice into someone without their permission, the person who said that Ron was a good man, the person who’d done everything he could to make sure child-Harry felt loved and safe.
“Oh, ouch, yeah.” Yin winced. “How do you deal with that? Are you the ‘make sleep happen at all costs’ sort, or the ‘sleep isn’t happening so I might as well learn every magical language that exists’ sort? My partner is that latter. Do you really need to know Old Elfish? I ask you.”
“Yes.”
him, and that wasn’t weird.  It was perfectly normal to want to sit by someone you liked. People did it in school all the time.
“Of course, I know how it looks,” Malfoy went on. “Ex-Death Eater and wizard wunderkind meet once more, arch enemies back to school, an epic rivalry for the books. It’s poetic; it’s justice; it’s like a story. I get it. The press eats it up.” Malfoy moved to the window, on the other side of Harry, looking down on the green. “I’m not here for that. It’s not redemption, and it’s not payback.” Straightening, Malfoy turned back toward Harry. “It has nothing to do with you, or the war. I’m here to make a life. I want to move on.”
, and Harry hated it. He hated it. He didn’t know why he came here.
Harry heard himself make a high, tight sound.
Draco’s eyes widened, soft surprise colouring his features, but then it was tucked away swiftly. “Of course,” he said, leaning in to kiss Harry’s again. “Of course, you like it. You’ve never been anyone else’s darling before, only mine. You’re only mine. I’m going to make you feel so good. You’re going to feel so good, Harry.”
“In my—in my arse. Fuck me hard again. Like you were before.”
But now Harry was considering it, and Malfoy didn’t like him.  Malfoy didn’t
Harry cleaned up again, considering giving up.  Instead, he went back into the kitchen and got another sandwich and another glass of milk, then brought them out to Draco.
“Fuck.”  Malfoy gasped for breath.  “Fuck.  You prat.”  Malfoy pushed him.  “I don’t want to
“I don’t know why the Board is willing to look the other way,” Harry said. “Maybe they’re trying to hide the problem so that funding from mixed blood and non-magicalborns doesn’t get withdrawn.” Harry went on, putting his mouth close to the mic again, creating the ugly reverb. “Or maybe, they’re signalling to Old Blood that blood purists are welcome here.”
“Oh, yes, I love—” Draco cut himself off.  “I mean, I like it well enough.  I’m—don’t make any jokes about Ravenclaw; you already said I ended up in Slytherin.”
Harry sucked for a messy moment, and then it came—too thick and too hard into his arse, thrusting without any gentleness or finesse, and Harry moaned. He moaned with the slight pain of it and the onslaught of pleasure, the way it immediately was methodically fucking his guts. Harry moaned more as it fucked, drooling over Draco’s cock.
“Plenty of women can enjoy ze aesthetic appeal of a well-made body,” said Fleur, “no matter the sexuality.”
someone tied to me. Not in that way. I want someone who is their own person, who doesn’t need me to—to save them, or exist for them, or be their everything. I want someone who exists for themself, and who loves me . . . just for being me.”
“Are you sure you can’t help?” Harry said, since that was the reason he’d come to Hermione initially.
“Good.” Teddy headed toward the door. “Makes you wonder why it’s called a Phoenix, doesn’t it?”
“I was trying to catch the Snitch,” Harry said.
Kavika gave a little nod. “And why didn’t you say that?”
Harry pulled Malfoy by the wrist, only letting go when they were in another part of the room, and Malfoy tried to wrest away. “What are you doing?” Malfoy demanded. “I had that under control.”
“She would fight in a war,” Malfoy said. “She would never start one.”
Harry was loud, louder than he’d ever been from touching himself, and the orgasm felt like it ripped through him forever. He kept catching glimpses of Draco’s rising prick, and it made him come harder, and then the dildo eased inside again, and he thrust back into it.
Harry never knew what to do around crying.  Probably he should move closer, pat her shoulder or something, only he didn’t know Mrs. Mulpepper very well.  She might take it the wrong way.  It might make her cry harder.  She might hug him or something, and Harry didn’t know what to do with hugs that weren’t from Hermione, Ginny, or Molly.  Strangers were always trying to hug him, ever since the war ended, and it made Harry intensely uncomfortable to be touched so familiarly.
Harry took it out and handed it to him.
Harry didn’t know how to say this.  “It hasn’t happened on my timeline yet either.”
Kavika picked up her coffee again, and the clack her bracelets made against each other sounded definitive somehow, like punctuation. “You don’t have to fight the Board of Regents, Harry. You don’t have to do things their way.”
Harry didn’t state the obvious.
Malfoy sniffed his posh, snooty little sniff as if to show he didn’t care. “Haven’t you anything else to say to me?”
“Good,” Malfoy said, then let go of his wrist.
“Because one doesn’t exist yet, of course,” Malfoy said, in his pretentious way, turning back to the tincture in the toilet.
“Why?”
His thumb a bright purple, Harry had followed Draco upstairs to get their brooms.  In the afternoon they usually did other things while ingredients for the potions simmered or dried.  On two of the days they had gone flying at the green place in Wiltshire, and on one of those days Draco had showed Harry how wizards duel.
“I’m going to say something to you a wise man once told me,” Kavika said. “You don’t have to come.”
“Why is your loo upstairs?” Harry blurted, which wasn’t what he’d meant to say at all.
“A lot of boys like her,” said Pansy Parkinson. She was stroking Malfoy’s hair as Malfoy lay across two seats of the train, his head in her lap. Crabbe, Goyle, and Zabini all looked on. “Even you think she’s good-looking, don’t you, Blaise, and we all know how hard you are to please.”
“You think you shouldn’t remember who he used to be?”
“Oh, would you?” Harry said. “Come in.”
“I know what side Teddy supports,” Harry said.
“That sounds like Dumbledore.”
“Sorry,” said Harry.
Almost as though in a trance, Malfoy slowly moved into the stance. The point was relaxation but not to forget everything you’d ever been taught, which was what Malfoy was apparently doing.
“Don’t you want to just—can’t we just—with our clothes on,” Draco breathed.  “We could just with our clothes on—and I promise I wouldn’t touch you—well, maybe a little.  And we could just—snog—”
“I once had a sex dream about Nearly Headless Nick. I had that embarrassed ‘I can never talk to anyone again’ voice nearly all of sixth year.”
Draco smiled faintly.  “If you don’t mind.”
Harry, still impressed and sort of overwhelmed by the hole blown wide open in his case due to this new intel, accidentally blurted, “You really are tops at potions.”
“Draco.” Harry’s breath was guttering.
Eventually, Draco stopped shuddering, so still that Harry thought he might be sleeping.  Draco’s breathing hadn’t changed, though, although the light in the room had.  “Do you want Andromeda?” Harry asked, after another fifteen minutes or so.
have got Andromeda, except—Harry remembered how Draco was with him, when Harry himself had been a kid.  God, Draco was so beautiful, and he’d tear himself to pieces if Harry gave up on him.  He’d punish himself; Harry knew that Draco would, and Draco didn’t deserve it.  He’d already been punished.  He deserved to have a life now.  They both did.
“Or he’s in love with you,” said Hermione.
“That’s all right,” Harry said.  “I’ve often thought you didn’t.”
“You’re not thirty-one now,” Draco said, “and that means you haven’t had nearly enough birthdays.  Aren’t you going to look at it?”
“And you saying I can use my name, but I shouldn’t use it to hide behind—the same thing, over and over? Don’t you get exhausted? Don’t you wish I would either do something about it, or stop complaining?”
knows I’m not a freak, and—and he’s even taught me how to avoid people thinking I am one.”
“It was an alpaca.”
“I told you I could do colour spells,” Draco said, lifting his chin.  “Any six-year-old can do them.”
“What would you like to have?”
Harry took his teeth away.
“Sure,” said Teddy, standing up.
“I forgot about your righteous indignation.”  Draco started walking toward the lunch basket.  “I am a Slytherin, after all.”
“No,” said Draco.  “Yes.  Harry—I mean everyone.  Everyone loves you.  Do you understand that they care what happens to you?”
“I bet I don’t.”
“Harry,” she said, a little sharply.  “
“What?” Harry glanced down at Draco’s cock, surprised by the question. “Yeah,” he said, looking back up at Draco. “I said I did.”
“You want to suck on something, don’t you, Harry?” Draco asked, his voice gentle. “You need something in your mouth. Something to fill you up.”
“I suppose his hair is better,” Harry said, because Malfoy had got a cut, or something, and the way it was short in back and long in front could be considered rather pleasing, by people who weren’t Harry. “And he wears makeup.”
They got to the top of the stairs, but Mister Malfoy just stopped and looked down at him, his brow furrowed.
“What’s your name?”
“Your final exam,” Harry said, finally understanding.
After several tries, Harry got it.  Then they did a spell to pour more cocoa, turn on the sink, make the trivet float, and stop the other spells.  Mister Malfoy had to take out his wand to show Harry how to make the chair dance, and Harry tried it himself on the other chair.  After twenty minutes both the chairs were dancing, the curtains were floating, and the hot chocolate was pouring itself into itself over and over.  Harry pointed at the table with the wand, shouting, “
Harry watched them go, then lifted his eyes to find that Malfoy had lifted his own gaze back to Harry’s face. “I’m very proud of you,” Malfoy said, “that the world is ending and you—you’re in here snogging, instead of feeling that it’s your responsibility to save it.” Malfoy shifted uncomfortably on the desk, and at last, Harry understood.
Draco kissed him again, but this time he put his tongue in Harry’s mouth and Harry didn’t have to chase it. He didn’t have to do anything, though he wanted to, because Draco held him pinned against the wall, Draco’s tongue hot and insistent in Harry’s mouth. Harry tried to kiss him back; he tried, but Draco made him feel like he was incompetent at kissing, like he might as well put his head against the wall and be devoured because it was the best thing that ever happened to him, and Harry thought it might be. It really might be.
“What are you—heavens, Harry, you just fell thousands of feet.  It’s all right to be afraid.”
Malfoy cut him off with an annoyed noise.  “You are not getting the
Draco was quoting again.  “Magic shouldn’t hurt people,” was all Harry could think to say.  The catch in his voice made it hard to go on.
“Prove it.” Harry’s eyes jerked up again, and Malfoy rolled his own. “If this was actually happening, he went on, “and wasn’t some wild gay fantasy borne out of exhaustion, you’d have kissed me already, and we would probably be—I don’t know—fucking over your desk—”
should have told you.  Heavens.  What did your aunt and uncle tell you happened to your parents?”
Harry watched Draco walk over to the table, where more of the burned books were laid out.  “Are you all right?” Harry asked at last.
Mister Malfoy just looked at him.
Malfoy’s head snapped up.  “What.”
In the kitchen, eggs were flipping themselves in a pan on the cooker, while oranges squeezed themselves into a pitcher.  Bacon sizzled on another pan beside the eggs, and pieces of bread floated just over the flames, toasting.  Milk and jam sat on the table, with sun was streaming in on them through the blue curtains.  Harry thought he’d never seen anything look so nice.
“If I’d had my way, I’d be dead.” Harry sipped his coffee. “I guess it’s good we don’t always get what we want.”
floated through Harry’s brain.
Harry waited for Mister Malfoy to use his stick, but just as Mister Malfoy was lifting it, Harry grabbed his glasses.  Taking them off, he put them on the table.  Mister Malfoy was just a blur, now, but Harry could feel his inquiry.  “So they don’t break,” Harry explained.
“No, Harry.”  Without his glasses, Harry could only see a whitish blob as Draco’s face, lit by the moonlight streaming through the window by the bunk beds.  “They were different.  I put the old ones in the wash.”
“I don’t want to reverse it.”
After that, Mister Malfoy stopped touching him, and Harry became intensely aware that they were kneeling on the floor of the loo.  “Sorry,” Harry said, for lack of anything better to say.
, Harry wanted to say. Why was everyone obsessed with Malfoy? But Harry knew the answer.
people, ugh.”  Draco lay back down.  “I would like to murder you.”  Then he covered his face with a pillow.
, apparently. Harry hadn’t known. “Ron’s an Auror.”
31 years
Taking her hand off Harry, Hermione shrugged. “He could always use a bit more.”
“There was an attack on Diagon,” Penelope said.
“Right,” Draco said, sounding confused, “but I’ve got three over there.  And six there.”  He pointed to the piles near the floral chair.
“He also repels you?”
“Is that how one learns to be an Auror? By keeping out of danger?”
Harry’s heart was twisting in his chest.  “He was attractive in school.  I just didn’t realize it.  I looked back on it afterwards—how he looked—and realized he was.”
31 years
“Er, yes,” Harry said, coughing again.  “Quite ill!  And I need the number to call to get a taxi, so I can—can go to the hospital.”
“Two.”
Ron was saying something.
“We were discussing Malfoy,” Harry said, having recovered enough to realize that the truth wouldn’t really hurt.
“No,” Malfoy agreed, “but it’s fun. Also, true.”
“Draco,” Harry breathed.
When Malfoy spoke again, his voice was so falsely bright it sounded like a joke—except Malfoy was a child, and children never seemed to notice how horribly obvious they were when they lied.  At least, Teddy and Rose never had.  “I expect I’m married then?” Malfoy said.
is the only place you can cry at Hogwarts, because in the dungeons you have your mates; in the corridors someone might see—and—and—”
“You mean, you think you’ll get interested?”
to me. To my life. I don’t care. I want to not care.”
He didn’t know how Malfoy stopped them. He was grateful, nevertheless.
Harry shook his head. “If there was a way to prolong your life just by taking the life energy of plants—or even other people—we would know by now. What Voldemort did was significantly more complicated.”
Harry had another bite. “So, you bought them?”
Malfoy took a swift breath, and Harry turned to him. The champagne flute was gone, likely Banished. “Let’s go,” Malfoy said, putting his hand on Harry’s upper arm, then giving it a shove. “I don’t want Potter seen with you,” he added, explaining to Greengrass. “It would tarnish his image.”
“Hm?”  Draco had a pencil behind his ear, and he was scribbling on a scroll-thing with a feather quill.
“Bent?”
“Malfoy, come off it; don’t touch that.” Harry swatted at Malfoy’s hand, which was reaching out to poke the scope.
“When you made new clothes and put them in the bathroom, were they the pyjamas?  Did you just keep making new clothes out of the same clothes over and over?”
The coffee was good, and Harry had just ordered a second espresso when a figure appeared in the middle of the cobblestone lane. Harry did not have time to consider that this figure was just someone who was using another portkey, because the figure was Malfoy—the early spring sun touching his hair, bathing his face with pale gold. He wore a delicate blouse-y blue thing that was neatly tucked into denims, and in that moment, Harry was convinced that Malfoy was still obsessed with him, and that he was being followed.
“Cool.”
Harry cut in before Mister Malfoy could decide what to ask.  “But I don’t need anyone to take care of me.”
Harry moved his hand over his fist. “Yet.”
“I’m not sure why the Board would signal they tolerate blood purism.” Harry chose to answer Kamau. “The only thing I can think is that there are people who are fine with blood prejudice continuing in the Auror Force, just as it exists at Academy.”
“I didn’t know the comparison would bother you!” Vinicius spread his hands to convey his innocence.
“That means it’s yours,” said Mister Malfoy.
Harry could feel her looking up at Ron—the way she sometimes did when she was talking to Harry, as though Harry always had to be handled so carefully.  Harry didn’t want to look at her.  He was remembering what Draco had said, when Draco was eleven.
“There,” Draco said.  “That’s all we need.  Hold my hand again, Harry.”
“But you teach Defense
“I . . .”
“Someone made a sacrifice to the Timothy Tree and bound the life of it in the tree. That’s why it’s been there for so long. And the life inside of it’s why it’s so picky about who climbs.”
“I think I do know,” said Angelina, who sounded like she thought her husband was trying to get a rise out of her, and that she found her salad more interesting.
Harry opened the door.
“You shouldn’t feel guilty. He was a prat. You shouldn’t have to forgive a person who did those things. You shouldn’t have to teach him either. Now. How would using your name to have him removed make you feel?”
“Inefficient leadership!” Now was the part of the meeting where Savage leapt to her feet, incandescent with rage. “Kingsley Shacklebolt led the Order of the Phoenix to victory against the Dark Lord!”
“My mind didn’t change,” Harry said. “Ron’s an Auror.”
Harry looked over his shoulder in surprise, but Draco never seemed to notice or care when he contradicted himself.  An explanation that Harry was doing exactly what Draco had told him to would probably not be welcome just now, and for the first time, Tailored Tinctures and Draco’s flat felt too small.  Harry felt like he couldn’t breathe.  He wanted to get out, but he couldn’t leave Draco alone here.  Upstairs would be better at least, away from that bedroom where Draco had awakened over and over again hating him.
“I never promised anything,” Malfoy said, tossing his head.  The dim light of the kitchen caught in his hair as he took the Veritaserum from Harry.  “I hope you don’t go into every interrogation blindly hoping you don’t get asked questions when you’re on Veritaserum.”
a prat that Harry said, “Yeah.  But you’re
Kavika had come out of retirement to treat Harry, which was why her office was a room in her house. This might have felt awkward, except Kavika and Kingsley currently lived in the Minister residence, which was in London, so the place Harry went to visit them as friends was not the same as the place where he had therapy. Something would have to change when Kingsley stopped being Minister, but Harry hoped that wouldn’t be for a good long while. If the Deal happened, they would need him.
done anything.  And you can’t make me.”
, Harry wanted to say, but instead he said, “I wish I’d taken your hand as well.  I think . . . I think we could have taught each other things.”
“It’s the
thirty-two, so much so that Harry let out a choked laugh.
“I mean, anything new,” Harry said.
“You aren’t meant to say ‘Muggle.’”
“Only that Draco knows full well you won’t have him. So why should his marrying his second choice be a problem?”
14 years
Sighing, Harry got up to get more Firewhiskey, then poured them each another shot.  “Probably,” he said, putting the cap on the bottle, “if Robards doesn’t get in my way.”
“Now who’s old?” he called out, after the fourth time.
“I didn’t say anything about kicking you out,” Harry said, his tone still slow and measured. “I asked if you wanted to be here.”
“I arrested the brewer of Dream Dram,” Harry pointed out.
With all of his moping about the house, Harry should have been happy to get back to Academy, and he was, mostly, but the weather was cold and rainy, and he didn’t like mornings, and his coffee was burnt, and three different instructors stopped him on the way in, and one of them was Spragg.
“Did you ever do it?” Harry asked, not because he thought Draco was foolish, but because Draco was often saying bad things about himself, and Harry thought maybe this was perhaps another bad thing in disguise.
Harry hesitated. Since Fudge’s appointment as Minister of Magic in October, a group from Academy had been going to the Higgledy Piggledy every other week or so. As the group was mostly trainees with a few older alumni thrown in, Harry had not joined them, but he knew for a fact some of the other staff and instructors went regularly—Penelope, Gareth. Even Savage, from time to time. “All right,” Harry said, making the decision suddenly.
“I’m asking because of who you are.”
Harry thought about A-bombs and Lucius Malfoy’s repression—presented to his son as a kindness—and the fact that Draco apparently despised his younger self.  Alarmed, Harry tried to remember whether Draco had said any of those awful things in the ledger—but no, they’d only been in the letter.  “What does?”
Meanwhile the papers snapped into Harry’s hands.  He knew Draco didn’t want him to get hurt, but Draco obviously needed help.  “
, they got
Malfoy looked a little panicked.
“Harry.” Draco writhed.
“Hello Harry,” said Kavika. “I understand you do not usually attend meetings for the Board of Regents. It must be a special day.”
“Yes.” Hermione’s voice was just as eager as before, but with a softer tone now, tender. Her eyes were a little damp. “I didn’t mean to say . . .”
“No. I don’t—I never really used them.” Harry tried nibbling along the shell of Draco’s ear. “But I bet I can enchant something for you.”
“Okay, but mostly that was before you were born.”
“I wouldn’t call the Order of the Phoenix a company,” Harry said; then: “I thought you were going to run for Prime Minister of wizarding Thailand.”
“Merlin, Potter,” Draco said, rolling his eyes.  “I’m not five.”
“I’m not sick,” was all Harry said.
When Harry arrived before them, however, Malfoy was standing straight, a look of disdain in his face as he regarded Greengrass, who was ranting. “It’s a wonder you would even be seen with her, after the disgrace you have brought upon her—upon yourself.”
23 years
“Oh dear. How difficult. Do you take it?”
“I know,” Draco said, sounding troubled.
“It’s hilarious, Potter. Do you think a Mudblood deserves to live?”
“I’m certain of it.”
Harry understood why Draco wanted to find the cure. Even if Draco hated Harry’s grown-up self and loved Harry at ten, Draco would still be trying to fix it, because grown-up was what Harry was meant to be.  It didn’t have anything to do with whether Draco liked him at all.
“I’m a fucking Slytherin!  What the fucking hell makes you think I’d ever keep a promise?”
Opening the ledger the older Draco had left on the lab bench, Harry checked to make sure all the instructions were there.  The first page had a list of ingredients in Draco’s meticulous hand, the second a description of the potion he had made for the cure, the third an explanation of how the cure would work, the fourth a summary of how he’d traded their ages, using a potion he’d developed called Age Exchange.  Harry skimmed the second and third pages, making sure he understood the instructions and could do what Draco was saying.
“I got detention,” Harry said.  “Which meant I didn’t get to play the last Quidditch game.”
Savage whirled on him. “They’ll get Muggles
Reaching for Draco’s hand, Harry moved closer, so he could put himself between Draco and Andromeda.  He wasn’t sure he liked her after all.
Harry’s gaze immediately snapped down to it, and only then did he realize he’d been standing there at least a minute, rubbing the scar on the back of his hand.
“Fuck,” Harry muttered, pressing up against Draco’s side. Harry’s own cock brushed up against Draco’s hip. “Goddamn,” Harry said.
Malfoy held his eyes with his own cool ones, for some reason looking far too relaxed. “Yes.”
As if on cue, a voice echoed down the corridor as Harry entered Bickford-Buckley. It sounded as though it was coming from the cloakroom, which was verified as Harry drew near. The voice grew louder—not trainee conversation. Shouting.
“Yes,” Harry said, not quite breathing properly.
“Oh,” Harry said, surprised. “I mean, they’re Malfoy’s, so—they’re fine. I mean, he wouldn’t—he would have at one time. But he wouldn’t hurt me.”
Harry’s smile ventured into a real one, but he looked back down at his hand again, reading the words Umbridge had made him etch there with her quill. “Something happened.”
Parkinson just laughed. “Of course. Astoria is suited to you perfectly. You’ll make a fine pure-blood family. Come along, there’s someone I want you to see.”
Harry didn’t know what righteous indignation was either, but as he followed Draco he decided to ask about the weirder word instead.  “What’s a Slytherin?”
Hermione’s smile twisted. “Not good. They’re saying they have to go to the EU, now, if the Reveal happens.”
Harry had been going, following Malfoy’s direction, but now he stopped. “Malfoy isn’t pathetic.”
Harry moved closer.  Malfoy just looked so bewildered, and Harry didn’t know what to do.  If Malfoy had been Hermione, Harry would have hugged him.  But Malfoy wasn’t Hermione, and Harry didn’t hug other people unless they were Molly Weasley—he certainly didn’t hug Draco Malfoy.  That would be just ridiculous.  Harry said at last, voice cracking, “I was trying to say you could get around the tracking charms, but you never would, and that that proved you could be trusted.”
“Draco,” Harry said, reaching out to the arm that was newly marked with Astoria’s tattoo.
in order to pass a class—is a frothing Voldie-loving baby non-mag-killer by default.”
“You were making fun of Ron!  Again!”
“I’m just,” Harry said.  “I’m not good at—expressing things.  Sometimes.  Feelings.  I mean.”
“With that magnificent lab I’ve got?”  Draco capped the phial.  “Don’t be absurd, Potter.  Of course, I can do it.”
“Not all the time,” Harry said, but he chose a story to tell Draco anyway.  It was about the Ragerade, mainly because Draco’s identification of that potion had proven invaluable.  Harry didn’t tell Draco why he’d been on suspension, but he told Draco that he had been on suspension, and that no one else had been able to help until he’d asked Draco, and then Harry had tracked down the brewer, who’d been keeping swamp-things in his back yard in Sussex.
“I know how to do it.” The chin went back up.
“Careful, Harry,” Draco murmured.
The tears behind Harry’s eyes felt like pin-pricks.  He guessed it hurt that Mister Malfoy didn’t believe him, but Uncle Vernon never believed him and that had stopped bothering Harry long ago.
Harry flicked his wand again, freezing Alby’s vocal cords.  “Listen to me carefully.  Do you know who that is?” Nodding over toward Draco, Harry went on, “You know what he can do with potions.  He engineered an indicator solution for Wood-Eye Lye, so I’ll know if you’ve taken it.  If you have, he, you, and I can wait together until it wears off and I can administer Veritaserum.  Or you could just answer my questions right now, and we can get this over with.”  Harry released Alby’s vocal cords.
“What?” Harry pulled away.
Mister Malfoy murmured another incantation, and after a moment or two a glass floated in from the kitchen.  “Drink this,” Mister Malfoy said, giving him the glass.
Malfoy seemed completely unfazed. “You know, I’ve never been
“Draco!” Harry said, the glass crashing to the ground.  Harry didn’t care, because Draco was lying there motionless on the top bunk, and Harry didn’t know what he’d given him.  Draco had made the potion; Harry hadn’t known what was in it.  Harry had trusted Draco, but what if he couldn’t?  What if Draco had put something in there to hurt himself so he could fix Harry; it sounded like something Draco would do.  Draco had done it before—he’d done this, made himself a child.
Taking out his own wand, Harry pointed it at the hearth.  “
Harry tried to jerk away.  “What—”
“Anything.” Harry shifted under him again. He wasn’t even sure whether he was trying to get Draco’s arse off his cock or bring it closer. “You can do anything you want to me.”
“Harry’s working through some things,” Andromeda said, rustling her paper.
“I’ll write down the address. Outside of Paris. Perfect. It will be perfect for you.”
“Hello, Hermione.” Harry finished the water he had cooled, then turned back to Teddy. “What about you?”
“Draco,” Harry said, smiling again.  He felt a little bad about it but couldn’t help feeling amused as well.  “It’s not a negotiation.”
“Yes,” Harry breathed.
“Maybe we should have.”
Harry wasn’t exactly sure what confirmed bachelor meant, but he was pretty sure it meant single.  “Good.”  He played a card.
Georgiana Savage had been an Auror for years, long enough that Draco thought she would no longer be interested enough in the work to come in on a Sunday.  That was why he had decided he’d trick her into making her think they’d left.  The spell he had done on her quill had simply made her quill copy the last thing she’d written, which had been a note to Cecil Vance.
“Are we friends then?”
Then the pictures began to move, and Harry decided exactly what to feel about them.
“Some of these aren’t even people I talk to all that much,” Harry said, looking at the list that contained old Hogwarts mates from Quidditch and the DA, Teddy, and the Weasleys. “I can’t just go to them and say, ‘look, I know we haven’t talked in months, but I need to dump all my problems on you now because I was suicidal a few months back.’”
“He’s not a blood supremacist,” said Bennet.
“Yes.  But father . . .”  Draco shifted, as though to relieve the pressure on his arm, but he still didn’t put it around Harry.  Disappointed, Harry stopped pressing in.  “He didn’t like Dumbledore.”
if she wanted to know; his personal life was spilled all over it. She’d ignored this and had him make a list.
When Harry asked Savage—because Savage knew everything—why they didn’t have a lab, or at the very least a potions consultant, Savage said—in typical Savage fashion—“Ask the gaffer.”  When in response Harry headed toward Head Auror Robards’ office, she waved her hands frantically and said, “I didn’t mean actually ask!”  This was also typical Savage, and Harry hadn’t learned yet that just because Savage knew everything didn’t mean she always gave the best advice.
“Sure,” said Yin. “It’s good you trust him.”
Fuck, he’d been such an arse.
There was something so gentle and almost sad in Draco’s tone that Harry looked up from his last strawberry, but Draco had already turned away.
Harry thought about it—three orientations with Malfoy, then two before it without. The last few years—with Malfoy attending Academy, then Teddy—had made Harry feel as though something was happening at Academy, something different, something of note. This year, Malfoy and Nyala would surely graduate, and then Harry would go on—year after year, as he once had at Hogwarts, and endless pattern with the war going on outside of it, bigger than school, bigger than the world to which he was confined.
“I guess we should talk at some point,” Harry said.
“Easy,” Harry said into the Whisper Wire.
If Teddy hadn’t asked, Harry probably would have spent the night alone, despite the significance of the occasion. Hermione was in session for the vote, and Ron was in audience as one of the few special guests allowed. Vinicius was at the Leaky with most of the rest of the Force, though obviously, a few of the Aurors had come to the Higgledy Piggledy.
“Okay.”
“How are you floating?” asked a girl, looking around Mark and Fairchild as though she might find some wires attached to their bodies.
“But we wanted to.” Hermione squeezed his arm. “All right, then? You still seem a little wobbly.”
“What’s meant to be enough?”
“Yes,” Harry said breathlessly.
Harry knew he could say no. He knew he should say no. He’d come too many times. What would this do to his prick? But then Draco began casting the spell on Harry’s dick, and Harry felt the sluggish flow of more blood into his tired cock, awakening it. Invigorating it. His arse was still leaking.
Harry came toward him, and Malfoy looked around behind him, as though there might be someone else Harry was approaching. Sparing no time for Malfoy’s games, Harry reached for Malfoy’s elbow, but Malfoy wrested himself away, stumbling back and then along the shelves. “Heavens, you’re not
He cast some other spells, usually by waving his stick and saying weird words.  Some were ticklish; a few made Harry go hot or cold.  Several made different parts of Harry light up, which was really cool.  None of them hurt.  After each one, Mister Malfoy made little notes on his parchment, but after a while Harry began to get bored.
Since last year, Malfoy hadn’t been terribly obvious about his feelings, and no one seemed to have guessed the reason for the shape his boggart took. Still, that didn’t mean that Malfoy had stopped wanting him. He had said he would love him forever, and Harry was getting more and more nervous about what the memory in the vial might contain.
“You seem like you don’t even want to be here,” Harry said, “so it’s left me asking—why
“Let’s be clear,” Malfoy said. “I’m going to free the spirit of that sacrifice from that tree whether it gets me top marks on my exam or not. I just thought, if I did it for my exam, maybe I wouldn’t get expelled.”
“Does that mean you—you
Malfoy pulled the dressing gown tighter about himself, concealing the offending pyjamas.  “Did you have a potion for me to ID, or did you come to admire me in my nightclothes?”
“Sorry.”
Malfoy seemed to find this amusing. “Yes, Potter. I bought them.”
not married, am I?”  He hadn’t seen any evidence in the house that anyone else lived there, but it had never occurred to him that he might—
“I mean that I can help you, if you want it,” Harry said.  “Robards might not be enormously fond of me right now, but Shacklebolt—”
No one else came in to use the toilet.
“I’m fine,” Harry said, trying to step away, because Draco was acting weird.
Harry Apparated to Grimmauld Place first, fetching his Invisibility Cloak.  After putting it on, he Apparated to the street outside the warehouse on Colville Road.  Still under the Invisibility Cloak, Harry activated the Seeing-Eye Ball.  When he saw that no one seemed to be inside the warehouse, he made his way there quickly.
Harry turned away, looking out the window. Between the grey stones of the ancient arched window was only more grey, the sky as hard and unforgiving as the walls that framed it.
Next Draco made the shadows dance into the shapes of big spindly-legged birds that kept falling over, which made Harry smile again.
Harry thought of Malfoy, straddling Harry when he had bested Harry in sparring; Malfoy’s face when he talked to Teddy, the heat of Malfoy through that silk shirt at the holiday party. These thoughts alone made him think of sex; he could have got hard, if he had let himself dwell on them. “Yes,” he said finally.
“Oh, the Ludville case,” Ron said.  “Don’t worry about that.  Mysteries has it under control.  I’m sure it will all get cleared up in the end.”
“Is something wrong with Gran?”
“To summarize,” Shacklebolt said, “we finally have intel on an NDE meeting; Draco Malfoy successfully fooled at least one other NDE into inviting him, and Malfoy attending this meeting is a chance to capture Fenrir Greyback?”
“No.” Draco tugged a bit on Harry’s hand. “It’s fine now. I’m fine. I was just . . . I got a little . . . worked up.”
“And call me if you need my help.”
Potter’s wand!”  The stick flew into the man’s hand, and then before Harry quite knew what was happening, the man was striding forward and grabbing Harry’s arm.
This story is now done. I am currently editing and will be posting a chapter every few days. Sorry for the long waits.
“Potter!”
Harry slid his hand down Draco’s naked back, over his arse. He guessed if Draco was just going to keep teasing, he could tease back. Maybe it would incite Draco to more. Harry’s fingers stroked Draco’s arse—it was such a good arse, that round curve of muscle. Harry’s fingers skated across it to Draco’s crack, touching it lightly, then pressing in, between the glut muscles—not even finding Draco’s hole, just resting his fingers in that hidden place.
“So you’ll like me,” Harry murmured back, kissing the corner of Draco’s mouth.
“But my
Harry started taking files home—at first just a few, until he found a pattern.  The cases in which Savage had administered the indicator solution all involved potions, and each potion contained an ingredient from somewhere in the region of the Gulf of Mexico: the crocodile tears in Wood-Eye Lye, the jaguarundi saliva in the fear potion, even the chili peppers in the siren tongue powder.
“Teddy, do you know where she is?” Nyala asked.
“It’s worth it.” Harry came closer to Teddy. “It’s worth it to try. I know I said it’s rotten, but I didn’t mean it was rotten to the core. For every person like Robards or Bernard Bickford, there are people like Kingsley and Ron.”
Draco hadn’t carried him, Harry realized belatedly.  He would’ve used magic.  “Yes, we—they wear pyjamas,” Harry said.
Harry nodded quickly, just in case Mister Malfoy changed his mind.
Malfoy sighed, putting aside the moss he’d been sorting and finally meeting Harry’s eyes.  “What is it, Potter?  I hope you haven’t poisoned yourself again.”
“I don’t want your fucking money,” Malfoy snapped.  “I want to get by on my own, without anyone telling me I don’t deserve more.  I want to do magic without the threat of getting in trouble for it.  I
“What are you,” Yin asked, “on your third Order meeting now?”
“That’s why we have the Deal,” said Kavika. “It’s nothing like what Grindelwald wanted.”
“I might,” Malfoy called out.
“Because it’s temporary?”
“Do you think he’ll see his mother?” Draco’s voice trembled a little.
Harry watched the whole thing with wide eyes, jumping a little when Mister Malfoy made a blue mug and a white one with flowers painted on it float toward him.  After adding the milk and vanilla-looking stuff and stirring the pot a bit more, Mister Malfoy danced a trivet onto the table, then spelled the pot on top of it.  Using his wand some more, Mister Malfoy made the hot chocolate pour in an arcing stream from the pot into each of the mugs, then gave the blue one to Harry.  “I apologize for the lack of marshmallows,” Mister Malfoy said.  “They’re a bit of a trick to transfigure safely.”
Harry jerked in surprise. “What—?”
“Jolly good, failed in that as well, all right then.”  Draco closed his eyes, then opened them.  “Did I get Death Eaters into the school?  I was trying to do that one as well.”
Dudley stood there in the doorway, hand still on the doorknob.  “Look here.  A fellow came by, a few weeks ago, one of your sort—that’s not to say—I only mean—he was—” Harry didn’t help him, and Dudley gulped—“magical, and there was an owl, only he said it hadn’t anything to do with you, only—are you okay?”
“I’m lithe,” Malfoy said immediately. “I’m all sinew. They say the wiry ones are the strongest.”
“Live,” Harry said. Sometimes it felt like all he had ever been trying to do.
They walked back toward the house.
“Yes,” Harry said, then he thought about it. “Sort of. For the last three years, Malfoy’s been there, but he wasn’t this time, so it was—I wasn’t used to the questions. Not in quite the same way.”
school, wasn’t it?  You mean, you didn’t, in school—at all?”
Harry stared at the alpaca, realizing this would probably really work for Luna. Luna was better at using her imagination; it would probably work for Penelope, too. Penelope always wanted someone to talk to; it wouldn’t matter if it was an alpaca. And alpaca would probably work better for her than a person on her own imagination; she would have an easier time with someone to listen who couldn’t respond with human feelings. Even George might like a therapist alpaca. He never took anything seriously; perhaps having an alpaca to talk to would be ridiculous enough that he could remove himself from the truth of what he was saying for long enough to believe it was a joke.
“What business is it of
Harry sort of wanted to answer for him, since Ron
Draco raised one of his gold brows.  “A regular cheater?”
“Um,” Harry said again, even more faintly.
“But not because you’re gay,” Harry pointed out.
“Obviously. I throw the best parties,” Malfoy said, then proceeded to adjust the noise around her, just in case it was too loud.
“Ah.”  The cold expression melted.  The eyes were very green, Harry noticed.  He’d known already, but he hadn’t really known what it could feel like to have them looking at you like that, as though they could see right through you.  It wasn’t a very nice feeling.  “No one thinks we’re friends.”
“Draco,” Harry said, as Draco hurtled into the room.  “It’s me—it’s Harry.”
“I don’t want her to know I resorted to shagging Muggles, because I needed cock just that badly?  Not particularly.”  Draco reached for another slide, and Harry was beginning to think the microscope was just an excuse, so Draco wouldn’t have to look at him.  “I told you not to sound disappointed,” he went on.  “I tried something.  It didn’t work.”
“Don’t look so disappointed,” Draco said, barely even looking up from his magic microscope.  “It was never going to be permanent.”
Harry entered, something settling inside him as he took in the familiar surroundings: the overstuffed chair, Kavika’s table with her coffee instruments, the window with its tree. “I’m sorry,” Harry said, turning back to Kavika. “Is there anything I can do?”
Visits to Kavika always started out pleasant enough—she made coffee or gave Harry a biscuit. He asked about her daughter; she asked about Hermione and Ron, Rose and Hugo. They talked about the weather and the World Cup, and Fortescue’s new flavor. Then she would settle in and say something like, “Any flashbacks, lately?” so casually, as though flashbacks were another flavor of ice cream.
“I meant,” Harry said, also trying not to sound helpless or disappointed or any of the things that he was feeling, “I could read to you.”
Spragg sneered. “As though centuries of secrecy never hurt anyone. Or did you think because the magical world was a secret, that meant all the rape and murder and injustice perpetrated on Vulnerables could never be the fault of witches and wizards. Do you think secrets keep the innocent safe? They keep the
“Harry. Yes.” Draco kissed him again.
“I’m not fascinating,” Mark said, ever reassuring. “Totally benign. I promise.”
“It’s a spell book,” Draco said, as though Harry couldn’t read, when the problem was that he was bored by it.  “I thought you could learn some more magic while I work on the potion.”  He held out Harry’s wand.
“Not really,” Harry said.  “I want you to help me with Pensieving so I can be near you.”
“Where is he?” Harry asked, looking around as though Teddy might materialize from the accordion wood door in the corner, which must lead to a cupboard.
“Maybe you could have got it when we were looking at the bookshelves,” Harry said, trying not to sound annoyed at him.
“Ye-es,” Harry said, uncertain.
“By all means, have more.”  Mister Malfoy nudged the plate closer, and Harry helped himself to another thick slice.
“I call it that,” said Harry, because he really didn’t like the press.
“Right.” Rune gave him a chagrined smile. “I forgot; you were raised by non-magicals. But then, you know what I mean. If we could build a coalition with them—”
Malfoy’s arrival at Windermere Hall was not auspicious. The witch at the door, whom Harry recognized as a Bulstrode cousin, did not want to admit Malfoy. Malfoy was not amused. “You invite me to the party and then don’t let me in? Rude.”
Holding hands together, they went out of the room and down the stairs.
For some reason, Harry kept thinking about Malfoy at the holiday party, impeccably dressed in dove grey and a deep green, the way he had looked after Gardenia Greengrass had announced his betrothal. Malfoy had become so pale, strained about the mouth. The man was too bony. Last summer, when he had been telling Harry he would love him forever, Malfoy had had colour in his cheeks. He had looked vital, alive.
Draco was stumbling over his words, and yet for once he seemed to be speaking on the subject in a way that wasn’t oblique or completely bigoted, which was a first.  “I realized Oliver was attractive after I left Hogwarts.”
He’d never quite been sure whether to believe that there was evil magic surrounding the manor, but as he arrived there, he could see that it was true.  Everything for miles surrounding the manor was dead, except for sad, straggly patches of grass that looked as though they were struggling to grow.  Harry had to walk almost the entire perimeter of the ruins before he found Malfoy, sitting between remnants of stone walls, his head in his hands.
“Nothing.  Only—I don’t think your older self will want it to be green.”
“What threat level?” said Ron.
“So it will be a non-magical kindergarten?” one of the parents was asking.
“Never bother, Potter.  I am entirely at your disposal, of course.”  Putting the book aside, Malfoy stood, revealing the full dressing gown.  It was green and silver, nicer than anything Harry had seen Malfoy wear since school.  Under it, Malfoy wore white pyjamas that should have fit better.  The neckline had fallen entirely too low, revealing far too much of Malfoy’s chest, and Harry was angry at the neckline, at the skin it revealed.  He was angry at Malfoy, for wearing too-loose pyjamas.
Malfoy made a face at him.  “Eleven.”
“Cutting women . . . in half?”
“Or ask me to dance,” Harry said. “And I said not to say that.”
“He would
“You don’t understand.”  Draco’s devastation almost looked like panic.  “You don’t understand; I’ll
“Oh.” Harry turned to look for Malfoy again.
“I’m glad Yin is working for you, Harry,” Ron said.
“Really?” Malfoy didn’t actually sound interested.
“Very good,” Draco murmured, and Harry felt his chest expand.  He’d never been a good student, but then, he’d never had a teacher like Mister Malfoy.  He was sitting close now, and Harry could feel the warmth of Draco’s arm through his sleeve.  He smelled nice, like cake and fire.  “Polaris is part of Ursa Minor,” Draco went on.  “Draco’s tail is between the two bears.”
“I’m glad you’re like you,” Harry said.  “I like you better.”
“So,” Harry went on, “it’s not like Teddy needs people taking care of him. Not anymore. He can obviously look out for himself.”
I just want to thank everyone who has been so kind about the long delay in updates, particularly buildyourwalls.
magazine, “I think we can all agree hate-speech is bad, but don’t you think two weeks’ suspension is sufficient for some graffiti?”
, Malfoy had called it, and Harry suddenly realized Malfoy probably hadn’t got to go to uni.  His parents’ fortune had been seized, and no way did a magical university admit a former Death Eater under scholarship.
Looking about the room, Harry didn’t see any evidence—mud tracks, or signs that a different student had been there before. A few cloaks hung on hooks, but that was not out of the ordinary; Harry had left his cloak overnight plenty of times when he had been at Academy. “I’ll find the person responsible,” Harry said. “Tell me if you see anything strange.”
“The current Minister for Magic puts every Vulnerable at risk,” said Fudge.
things like that. It’s not fair of you, to me; you’re not being fair to me, knowing that I—I never brought it up. I stayed away. I tried to stay away; I . . .” Malfoy turned away, teeth baring in frustration.
“Right,” Mister Malfoy said in response to Harry’s silence.  “
Harry rolled over, putting himself over Draco now, Draco on the bed beneath him, eyes wide with surprise, cheeks pink. Pulling Draco’s hand away from his dick, Harry pinned it on the bed. “What else did you imagine?”
Harry shifted uncomfortably in his chair. “You know how they are.” When Kavika began spelling the coffee into the cups, he added, “And how I usually tell them they’re not there to ask questions about my personal life, and how I make it clear I won’t engage.”
Malfoy held his eyes a moment, turned on his heel, then walked away.
Draco seemed to find this amusing.  “Not at all.”  Harry must have still looked concerned, because Draco added, “Don’t worry, Harry.  When you see your older self, I imagine you’ll be quite—satisfied at the way you’ve turned out.  Shall I go first?”
Harry had no idea what Draco meant, but he was picking up his wand, and—
“That’s what it’s really all about, isn’t it,” Draco went on, driven by some invisible force.  His words came as though he’d been pushed down a rapid on a river and couldn’t stop, spilling from him in a tirade.  “You want to fuck her.  You want to make babies with her.  You want to marry her and do everything you’re supposed to do, except guess what,
Malfoy sucked in a tight breath, eyes snapping down to where Harry had grabbed his upper arm. Malfoy looked at it so long that Harry let him go. “Did I hurt you?” Harry asked.
“Wow,” Harry breathed.  “What does it do?”
, a Death Eater prat, and Harry could feel his intense blush slowly fading away.
Malfoy’s features immediately softened. His reply was under Mark’s, who was saying, “She’s probably off fighting the revolution herself,” but Harry heard it. “I’d do my best,” Malfoy murmured.
“Right.” Harry ripped off his glasses. It was something to do, and he didn’t want to have to look at these people. “What about human culture?”
“Harry,” Draco said quietly.
“Malfoy,” Harry said. “I invited the reporters.”
?” Draco demanded.
“I thought we were talking.”
“Sorry,” Harry said, even though he wasn’t really sorry.  Uncle Vernon always said,
“Dance is a very important battle,” Teddy agreed, taking Nyala’s arm.
“I’m sure plenty feel that the young Malfoy heir’s body iz fit,” said Fleur. “Such things are open to interpretation.”
“Is it? Is only physical hurt allowed to linger?”
Penelope snorted. “I know what part Spragg plays. Hilda too, for that matter.”
Draco looked up at him quickly.  “Like Vince?”
Malfoy extracted himself further, stepping neatly away. He angled his face toward the ground, showing Harry the fine line of his neck. “It’s too much,” he whispered.
Sliding his hand into the pockets of his ceremonial robes, Harry sunk down to sit on the edge of his desk. The world felt strangely unbalanced, as though he had no way of knowing what might come next. It used to be summer followed graduation, then the start of a new school year. Life had been much easier when it followed the pattern of an academic calendar.
Vance himself had become involved with Alby in 2008, which was also when Robards had put him in charge of reviewing everyone’s reports.  Using the red tape provided by Robards, Vance had been able to manipulate witnesses and files such that connections between cases would remain unseen.  He had also been the one to supply his fellow conspirators with the paint disguised as indicator solution, as well as distribute the paint-disguised-as-indicator-solution to unsuspecting Aurors.
But current events were evidence that the Wizarding World had, in fact, forgot, and Harry had ceded to Lee’s advice.
Over twenty years ago, Harry had saved Malfoy from the Fiendfyre just like this, and they were different now. They had grown. The past would always haunt them, but it didn’t own Harry now, not the way it once had. Despite everything that had changed—the whole wizarding world crashing down around them—Harry thought Malfoy had changed even more than all the rest of it, and that, more than anything, made Harry feel that he himself could be different. He himself could grow up. He could move on.
“A bunch of Revealers,” Savage added, seeing Harry and joining them. “Taking down wards.”
“Fucking
They went on playing Exploding Snap for the whole afternoon.
“No, Draco, I mean . . .”  Harry stopped, remembering how awful it had been for him to come out, how Ginny had coaxed him into facing what he was—so gently, so kindly.  He had tried to fight it every step of the way.  “When did this happen?” Harry asked instead.
“Yes,” Harry said.  “You’re very good at magic.”
“I have no idea,” Harry said, because he really didn’t.
“What about a koala?” said Teddy.
“Fine,” Harry shouted. “Nyala came. How’s Astoria?”
Draco just kept staring at him.  “Harry,” he began, his voice troubled.
Draco's tone was so exasperated that Harry’s mouth snapped shut.
“You think that’s not what Malfoy told him?
“Just not when you have to read it.”
“All right,” Harry said loudly. “Now we’re going to talk about how spells we don’t think of as combat spells—Riddikulus, Expelliarmus, Tarantellegra—can be used to fight even the darkest of dark arts, because the opponent doesn’t necessarily expect them.”
“Malfoy,” Harry said sharply.
“Merlin, are you serious right now?”
“There’s a sex dream voice?”
“Oh, my poor baby,” Draco cooed. “You want something on it, don’t you? You need someone to touch it?”
“You said you didn’t think Draco had anything to do with Travers.”
Harry waited for elaboration, but Teddy didn’t say anything more, and they were silent for a while, clearing the dishes from the table, settling in for coffee. After brunch, Andromeda had gone to teach her Squib class, leaving the two of them behind at Rombe Pickle. Harry always had brunch with Andromeda on the third Sunday of the month, and now that Teddy was staying there instead of at Hogwarts, Teddy had joined them. Seeing his godson so frequently was wonderful, and yet Harry also felt further apart from him, and he couldn’t quite understand why.
been there—Merlin.  You’re really not afraid.”  Draco frowned.  “No wonder you got sorted into Gryffindor.”
“I’m not even going to touch it,” Draco whispered. “I’m just going to leave that big, thick prick between your legs, and you’re going to get off just from pleasuring us, aren’t you—”
It was all sharp angles and harsh lines, with a moustache and a beard and hair past his ears, pulled up in back with long bits falling down by his ears.  On someone else, it might have looked cool.  Come to think of it, the whole body might have been cool on anybody else; only, Harry had hoped that he would look friendly and kind.  And handsome.  And elegant.  And posh.  Like Draco.
“Your contributions are always welcome.”
Malfoy just kept looking at it, not saying anything else.  “Okay,” Harry said slowly.  “Are we going to do it?”
Finally looking back at him, Draco smiled.  “You’re funny, Harry.  That’s something I never knew about you.  You’re very funny.”
, Harry wanted to say, but it so obviously wasn’t true.  Draco had managed to work himself into quite a state since Harry had left, which Harry supposed he should have predicted, only he didn’t see how he could have.  Draco had always seemed worked up in school, but Harry had thought that it was just because Draco hated him, and not because Draco had too many strong emotions he had difficulty controlling.  “I’m not in danger from any Muggles,” Harry said, experimentally petting Draco’s hair.
“Because it’s a part of you.”
Sectumsempra.
Kavika didn’t seem surprised. “And would that stop if you had him removed?”
“Oh, well, obviously, he’s amazing.”
While Malfoy bent over the microscope, Harry wandered around, looking at Malfoy’s things.  He had a Pensieve, brains in jars, cases of beetles, bottles of eyes, something that looked like Wheatabix, neatly dissected in a pan.
Spragg looked surprised. “Well, of course I know that, Harry. Do you think I wouldn’t talk to you? Just because we have a difference of opinion?”
“We’ve got ten minutes.” Hermione’s head was leaning back against his shoulder. They were sitting in the garden at The Burrow in a magic bubble of heat, where Hermione had Transfigured a lawn bench into a comfortable couch, and the three of them looked up at the stars. Out by the barn, beside the chicken coop, the children, Charlie, George, Arthur, Andromeda, and the Thomases were fiddling with fireworks, while Ginny and Angelina whipped their way between spurts of fire on broomstick. Percy and the Johnsons appeared deep in conversation, possibly about the danger of fireworks; Molly and Dean were in the kitchen, and Fleur and Bill were likely off somewhere snogging. For the first time, Teddy wasn’t spending New Year’s Eve with them; he had a party with his friends from Hogwarts, and Harry, Hermione, and Ron were virtually alone in their corner of the yard.
Taking another sip of juice to wash down the rest of the scone, Harry swallowed again.  “Like a witch?”
Harry had not arrived early enough to try the delightful little café, but Doctor Leblanc had said she liked to spend the first few sessions just getting to know someone, and so the session had been short. For the most part, it had gone well, though it hadn’t been terribly instructive. Cautiously optimistic, Harry had decided to try the little café. The weather had that clean spring taste that meant daffodils, and the café had a table by the window. From there he could see Doctor Leblanc’s sweet little garden and tall blue door, as well as the picturesque lane, the chestnut at the end of it, and a haphazard wizard tower that rather reminded Harry of the Burrow.
“Oh, her,” Robards said, sipping his tea.
“Understand what?” Harry asked, his head still hanging over the side.  He felt stupid for wishing Draco would touch him again.
Harry, looking down at the Timothy Tree through the window of Bickford-Buckley, thought of Malfoy, under the Timothy Tree. Malfoy, who had applied again to Auror Academy, despite failing twice. Malfoy, who never stopped. He had grown new leaves—in the magazines, anyway, in the newspapers. He’d done an interview for RevealRadio in which he revealed the plot of the Diagon Association, which claimed to be against Reveal but, on the side, was already hiring focus groups of non-magborns to test products specifically targeted to the non-mag market. When Reveal happened, Diagon would be the first to profit from it. “It’s true,” George Weasley had confirmed. “They’re specifically trying to undercut Knockturn by claiming to be in solidarity against Reveal, then getting a jump on the market to profit from it when Reveal happens anyway.”
“Nothing.”  Harry felt like he was struggling for air.  “Nothing’s wrong.  Draco.”  Making himself take a breath, he wound the magic tight inside himself, electric wire wrapped over and over again so tightly that the wire cut, and what was beneath could not be seen.  “Draco,” Harry said hoarsely.  “Come sit with me.”
Sneering, Malfoy gathered up the boxes and turned away.
“Weird,” was all Teddy said.
“Malfoy.”  Harry’s hand dropped in surprise.
Malfoy looked down, hands going to his hips. “I know.”
Draco had said, when Harry had been talking about what Harry would do if he lost Draco.
“The Ministry’s not going to know you’re under-aged,” Harry pointed out.  “They think you’re thirty-two.”
,” he said, and Harry felt his heart race.
“And . . .”  Mister Malfoy swallowed hard.  “Would you also drive a—a helicopter ?”
“Right.” Harry saw Malfoy’s gangly figure again in his mind’s eye and struggled with indifference; he must feel something. He had to feel something; Malfoy had called Hermione a Mudblood, tried to get Hagrid fired, stepped on Harry’s face, tried to murder Dumbledore. Malfoy had tried to murder Dumbledore, but when Harry about that Tower, he could only remember Snape and Albus, the Death Eaters coming up the stairs. “Malfoy doesn’t matter to me,” Harry said at last. “He’s not my responsibility.”
reported on it.”
No one had taken all the hot water first, so he got to have a nice shower, and sure enough, when he got out and got his glasses back on and clean enough from steam to see, he saw clothes were waiting, folded up on the seat of the toilet.  Never having had clothes that fit before, Harry had never been too concerned about them, but these were very nice.  The tan trousers felt soft and slick all at once, and the grey-green jumper wasn’t hot or scratchy at all.  Harry was embarrassed that Draco had had to make him magic underwear as well, but he was grateful for it, and it was clean and fit for once, so it was really the nicest underwear he’d ever had.  Draco had left socks and shoes, so Harry put those on as well.
I also can't express the amount of time, patience, and enthusiasm siemejay has given this story, from cheerleading to editing to honest opinions to thoughtful, in-depth comments to compassionate understanding and sympathy. I am overwhelmed by the debt of gratitude that I am so glad to owe you.
For a long time, Draco didn’t say anything.  Then he said, “Everything they did, they did because they wanted me to succeed.  They wanted me to be influential and well-liked, but it was never for themselves at all, no matter what it looked like.  They thought that it would make me happy.  That was all they ever cared about—making me happy.”
At Tailored Tinctures, Draco slid his arm out of Harry’s, walking over toward one of his lab benches with the Imperius potion.  “I think I can devise an antidote in an hour or two,” he said, putting the phial into one of his stands.  “I already have a few ideas; I think I can just—”
,” Savage was saying. “Last year blood purism. This year radical anarchists? What is
“I don’t know.  I didn’t know.  Harry.”  Draco whirled suddenly.  “His name was Sirius Black.”
“Harry,” Malfoy said.  “Words.”
Oh no.
“Advocating?” Greengrass looked appalled. “I’m not advocating. Do you think I want my daughter marrying an Auror? Pfft.”
“Malfoy,” Harry said again, touching Malfoy’s arm.
“Oh,” Harry said, shuddering under this touch. His cock was so hard that his arse felt desperate for it. He arched his back a little, thrusting his arse toward Draco.
, Harry wanted to say.  Instead, he said, “Are you angry?”
“Um,” Malfoy said. “I’m not sure Gawain wants you at his orgy? I’ve been specifically invited, and it would be rather awkward if—”
Harry was appalled at the idea that Malfoy might say ‘you’.
“And I wanted you to know,” Harry went on brokenly.  “I wanted to tell you and get better at telling you, and for you to never doubt that—that I love who you are.  Exactly who you are.  Anyone you want to be.”
Malfoy stared at him, long and unblinking, and Harry was a little surprised at how intense that was, considering Malfoy wasn’t an adversary or anything else he apparently aspired to. “My mistake,” Malfoy said suddenly, breaking the strange spell. “Must’ve been something I drank. The cold weather. Touch of the Whoop-whoop.”
“Are you hungry again yet?” Harry asked.  “We’ve yet to eat cake.”
“Don’t be so utterly daft,” Draco said, sounding disgusted.  “I want to be like
“Distasteful,” Duggins said quickly, and it sounded a bit as though he thought Harry might not know the word ‘palatable.’
“Oh, no.” Kavika stood up, heading over to her side table. “I hear about this every day from my husband. Do you think I wanted more?”
“I think you’re special.”
“New applicants.” Spragg snorted.
Possibly it did mean something; Malfoy’s eyes were bright, as though he might cry. Maybe he was already crying, angling his face away, so Harry could only see the angle of Malfoy’s jaw, the white line of Malfoy’s throat, the lacing of Malfoy’s elegant wizard frock coat, up to the throat.
“Maybe I can; it’s just . . . what’s the point?” Harry waved a hand, thinking of Baggot, of Pillwickle, of Greengrass. Of Fudge, who had denied Voldemort’s return, and why? Why had he denied the evidence before his very eyes? “Pure-bloods don’t accept when the world is different than they like to imagine.”
, because you’re an orphan.  They’re trying to
“Of course, there was cake!” Andromeda said, dropping her arms from Malfoy and bustling toward the kitchen.
Harry lifted his head.
“Do you have any idea who did this?”
happened—a muttered, “Prostratus,” a swift force against Harry’s shoulders. Then his legs went out from under him; he was on the floor, and Malfoy was scrambling on top of him, pinning him.
“Oh, right. Like deny the existence of evil mass murdering wanna-be dictators then come back after the war to throw money at everyone like they were never the worst Minister in existence.” Harry knocked back rather more of his goblin gin than he should have.
“You—?” Harry shifted in his chair. “Have a therapist?”
Malfoy was standing by one of the shelves of memories, the morning light making his skin and hair look almost white. His robes were severe and black, as though he were in mourning. Harry had never seen him dress so severely, and for just one moment, Harry thought of Snape. The turncoat.
“Harry,” Mister Malfoy said.  “Are you all right?”
It cracked open on his head.
,” he said, tossing the light up at the ceiling.
“Quiches,” Malfoy said.
The reporters all began to shout the moment Harry appeared, blocking his admission through the arch with the crowd of their bodies. To get through them, Harry would have had have to jinx them, and while he had never been known for being kind to reporters, he didn’t like raising his wand against people when he didn’t have to.
Once dressed, he felt a little silly—like Dudley getting ready for one of those photos Aunt Petunia had taken of him in his Smeltings uniform.  Still, being in clothes made especially for him felt very nice, and Draco was quite posh.  Looking in the mirror, Harry tried to comb his wet, unruly hair, just so he would look like less of the urchin Aunt Petunia always said he looked like.
Malfoy was pretending not to look at him again, and Harry didn’t know what to say.
“No,” said Nyala, moving with him down the hill, toward Teddy. “And they’re convinced someone will come and force them to feed or house hordes of non-magicals, or something—they’ve holed themselves up in there with spells tighter than Gringotts. At this point, I don’t care if someone comes and
Draco let out another big breath.  “I wish you’d shaken my hand on the train.  I would’ve . . . it would’ve been different.”
Draco kept stroking it, and everything about it was wrong. It was too gentle, too slow, not enough; ordinarily Harry would have been bored by it, except that it was Draco. It was Draco and he kept kissing Harry, those teasing kisses, but every few moments it was as if he could not help himself—he’d look down at his own hand on Harry’s cock, as if he couldn’t believe it was still there. The look of wonder would fill his features, only to be tucked away as swiftly as it had struck him.
It was a wand—not the same light colour as Mister Malfoy’s wand.  This one was darker and a little longer, and suddenly Harry realized it was the stick he’d been holding when he’d first ended up in these clothes.  Harry looked from it back up to Mister Malfoy, then back down at the wand.
“Er, mate.”  Ron was looking at Harry as though Harry had gone mental, then his shoulder relaxed.  He rolled his eyes.  “Did George do something to me?”
“It was the right thing to do.  And your mum saved my life.”
“Er,” Harry said. “You mean a different therapist?”
“Professor Quirrell,” Harry said.
“Pureblood tradition. Not a purist!” Malfoy added, as though sounding like a three-year-old in his denial could poke fun at Harry before Harry even made the accusation. “Just raised that way.”
“Don’t take it literally.” Sibanyoni sipped his Coke.
“Non-mags are different,” Fudge said. “They have their own government. When I was Minister for Magic, I was in
” it also said. “
“I think it would be awful,” Draco went on.  “Family is more important than anything.  It’s all right, though.”  He settled in on the other side of the couch, leaning against the arm and sprawling his legs out, the picture of a miniature little adult at ease, his hands folded over his chest.  “Since we’re best friends, I imagine we Malfoys are like a surr- . . . surrg- . . . adopted family.  You could come to our house on hols.  I bet you’ve done that loads of times.  Isn’t my mum the most beautiful woman alive, Harry?  You must love her very much.  She makes people feel comfortable.  She always wants everyone to be comfortable, even people who are never comfortable, like Severus.  Can you tell me about a Christmas we’ve had?”
Malfoy hadn’t looked at him since he’d kissed him.  His expression was absolutely crestfallen.
“He’s brilliant, isn’t he?” Malfoy asked, and Harry felt himself grow more embarrassed still at the naked admiration in Malfoy’s tone.
“Mum said . . . she said we should pity him—Severus.  Because he hadn’t any family.  She said he never got married because he was too much of a swot.  He couldn’t find anybody to love him.  It’s the worst thing in the world, to have no family, you know.  But—” Draco bit his lip, casting his eyes down.  “But then you
“No,” Harry said, trying not to sound as weary as he felt.  Putting out the fire in the hearth with a wave of his wand, he said, “I’ve got to get to work on finding that ingredient.  Do you—how would you feel about doing some more spells with your wand while I read over some of the instructions your older self left for me?”
“I told you I wouldn’t always be friendly when we first started, Harry.” Kavika was joking, and Harry was further mollified by the fact that she appeared to be making coffee, waving her wand to grind the beans and then heat the water. “So, Bennet and Spragg are thick as thieves. How are the rest of your classes?”
“Ah.”  Draco’s gaze drifted to the jar on the table, where the memories swirled in lazy silver strands.  “Sort of like you need memories Pensieved.”
“What do you need?” Malfoy’s voice was rapid and low. “Tell me, and I’ll give it to you.”
aren’t I?  I’m insidious; I’m sly.”
“Right,” Ron said, glancing at Harry. “Astoria. Harry’s going to kill her.”
“I love them both equally.”
!”  The wand lit up again.
; he was protecting me.  He told me so people wouldn’t mock me.”
“We do not need our final member to decide on this matter,” Pillwickle said. “I’m sure the three of
“Draco took care of me,” Harry repeated.
Harry thought, but Penelope meant well. She had come to check on him.
“I believe that was Harry Potter.” At this point in the meeting, Spragg also turned bland, which meant he was ready at any moment to duel with Savage.
; Draco had a boyfriend, and Harry wanted that boyfriend to be him, for Christ’s sake.  And yet Harry felt happy anyway, and he knew that it was pride.  He also knew that pride, if he expressed it, would be humiliating for Draco just now, so Harry held it in, but he still felt it.  He felt it all through him, as though he was a pitcher filled with something soft and silver and perfect, all the way down to his toes.
“And I am your best friend.”  Draco bit his lip.  “I suppose you wouldn’t want to lose me.”
“I doubt it.”
“Of course,” Harry said.
Malfoy’s face changed.
“Now we come to the main business of the evening,” Parkinson was saying. “We’re all aware of Riddle’s tactic of using Dementors in his attempts to put some measure of control on the Muggle pestilence. However, like most of our Lord’s doomed schemes, the effort favoured drama and spectacle, rather than precision and control. Dementors are a blunt instrument. They’re as likely to Kiss a pure-blood wizard as they are Mudblood scum.”
Teddy was calmly walking along, mostly looking at the ground, hands in his pockets. “And what do you think?” Harry asked.
“Harry,” Malfoy breathed.  He kissed Harry again.
Harry swallowed hard.  “I don’t know,” he said.  “She still sent you chocolates in the Great Hall.”
“Yes,” Harry said, but he still didn’t feel very all right. Seeing Teddy whole and alive was almost too much; he feared to go to him, to touch him, to find out he wasn’t real, that he was mortally wounded, that he would crumple at Harry’s touch. To see Malfoy touch him instead was enough, to see Malfoy reach out his hand, then yank Teddy to him as Harry wanted to hold Teddy to him, to see Malfoy wrap his arms around Teddy and hold him close.
“It means mostly grey.  She used to dress me in . . . well.”  Bowing his head, Malfoy licked his lips.  “Too much colour is flamboyant, she says.”
Savage and Vance were involved; Robards likely was too.  Best to leave the Aurors out of it—even Ron; Harry didn’t want to put Ron in the middle of everything.  Besides, Hermione had always been the one who figured everything out.  Harry didn’t expect her to solve the case, but he needed another pair of eyes.  Going to her one night when Harry knew Ron was at a stake-out, Harry began to explain the situation.
“If you get elected,” Harry pointed out.
“’Granger and Weasley’?” Andromeda repeated, sounding dry.
Harry moaned, then sucked, then pushed his arse back for another slap, just like that.
“If that’s what you want to call it,” Ron said.
“They didn’t.” Having feared a last-minute shake-up regarding Draco Malfoy’s grade, Harry felt relieved that today had held no surprises.
“Oh, dear,” said Bickford, rocking in his hearth. “Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.”
“I imagine so.”
“You have a good heart, Harry.  That’s what matters.  When I know you, you want to help people.  You want to help everyone, all the time, and you don’t stop.  You never stop caring about people, and trying to help, even though not—not enough people have cared for you.”
Harry had barely noticed Malfoy for most of the class, either because Harry had unconsciously been ignoring him, or because Malfoy had tried to be ignored. Merlin knew Malfoy was deft with a Notice-Me-Not, Harry thought sourly, as he watched Travers step up in line. Harry was noticing Malfoy now, because Malfoy should have been next, only he fell back in line to let Adebayo ahead of him.
“No.”  Draco took a deep, noisy breath.  “The cure is obviously working; you don’t need to keep checking on me.  You can take your Patronus.”
“Let him run to daddy.” Robards scoffed. “He’s already put this Department in the shit-can. We’ll see what the—”
“Yeah, just—” Harry writhed on the bed. “Just teach me this spell.”
“People don’t look for potions by colour; they do it by name,” Harry said.
“Draco,” Harry said, catching Malfoy’s hand by the wrist.  He pulled Malfoy’s hand away.  “You know your mum loves you, don’t you?”
“It’s a risk I’m willing to take,” Harry added.
“That’s what I thought.  It’s exactly what I thought would happen, when I went to Hogwarts.  I would make good friends with a boy who would play Quidditch with me, and he’d come home with me on hols.  It wouldn’t be Vince or Greg, because we’re already friends, and they don’t read, and it can’t be Theo because—well, now you know about Theo.”  Draco looked back at Harry.  “I’m glad it’s you.”
“Faking what?”
“Because the Snitch is right there!” Draco said, zooming off over Harry’s right shoulder.
“I know,” Draco whispered. “I meant if you don’t like this.”
“You came here just to say that about Mum?"
Damn.  He’d been
“Except you won’t be incarcerated,” Harry added.
“But you’ve told me where you live,” Malfoy said, still with that odd tone. “I could go there any time. Aren’t you worried I could . . . ?”
“What?  Mongrel?”  Draco shrugged.  “I didn’t say the
“Don’t you think we need Aurors now more than ever?” one the of the reporters asked Harry, pushing against Lee. “Especially if there’s a No Deal Reveal?”
Then the door was opening, and Harry was turning around, and a man was stepping out of Draco’s bedroom.
Teddy had been born out of war, even if he had lived his life in something as close to peace as their world could get. Sometimes Harry felt they were the same that way, children of a war that occurred before their time.
.  I thought the torture was all done.”
“Fuck,” Harry gasped. “Fuck. I’m close; I’m so close—”
Dammit.
“He tames dragons,” Harry added, just in case Draco still thought Charlie Weasley was too girly.
“It just never came up,” Harry said.
For the final exam, each trainee was to break a high-level curse from an object. Usually these objects were obtained by Harry from the Department of Ministries, though if trainees were able to identify dark objects that had not yet been collected and aid the Ministry in the collection, they could get extra credit for breaking the curse. This only counted if the dark object had existed significantly before the trainee had enrolled in the Academy, as Harry certainly didn’t want anyone to create dark objects just to pass his class.
Mister Malfoy reared back.  “Potter—just how old do you think I am?”
“Cross-referencing” didn’t sound very much like him, but Harry didn’t say anything.  Maybe he got smarter when he got older.
“Um.” Harry swallowed. “A Founder? Like Bickford-Buckley.”
“Don’t touch,” Draco tried to say, but Harry was already touching him, trying to get him to lie down.  This was an absolutely stupid fucking idea, which Draco proved when he shook himself away from Harry’s grasp and cracked one of the scabs open, beginning to bleed again.
“Yes.  Your parents fought him bravely.”  Andromeda went on sipping tea.  “But that was a long time ago.  Voldemort returned when you were at school.”
Harry turned on him. “No.”
“About dancing.” The blush was fading, and Malfoy’s voice had turned airy. “Everyone knows you don’t dance with trainees.”
Savage shuddered, and several faces around the board room table went pale.
,” Mister Malfoy—Draco added, and some of the green flames went pink.
Malfoy hadn’t had to put his failures on display like that, and yet he had. “I didn’t ask you to be there,” Harry said. “Press conferences I call are my own business.”
“That’s perfect.” Milligan kept her smile, her eyes large and bright. “So, talk.”
“No, you’re right.” Ron had a hip on the edge of his own desk, fiddling with the quills. “Don’t suppose him fancying you would make a difference. You always feel responsible for everyone regardless.”
“What do you mean?”
“Malfoy? Excuse me, he is
“Who are you?” said an imperious voice.
“Right.”
“I’m at home.” Teddy paused. “Not now, obviously. Now I’m here.”
“Pardon?” Draco’s back shot up ramrod straight.  “
going on, that Ron had had this suspicion since he had heard Harry tell Malfoy how to do his Patronus over the Whisper Wire, but nothing was going on. If something was going on, Harry didn’t know what. He knew that he had had a dream, a sex dream, but Doctor Yin said that didn’t necessarily matter, and Harry knew that he had kept thinking of it since. He knew that he had thought of Malfoy sparring with him—Malfoy beating him, Malfoy over him with that triumphant smirk—more than once. But what was it? Sexual attraction? Desire?
The final Council vote was tonight. Hermione’s bid for appointment as Minister had already failed to reach majority. Fudge’s bid, in a shocking turn of events, had succeeded. All that remained between the people and a Fudge Ministry was Proudfoot, a staunch moderate with very few political opinions other than neither side was right, and Reveal should happen because witches and wizards had called for it, but also maybe it could be stalled forever, that sort of thing. However, if he achieved majority tonight, Proudfoot and Fudge would be in a runoff, with the Wizengamot casting the final vote, and hope would remain. If he failed, Fudge would be the de facto Council appointment for Minister, at least until the general election in a year and a half. It didn’t work like anything Harry could remember about non-mag Parliament, but then again, nothing about the Ministry did.
“A Patronus isn’t a Dark Art. And you could have helped.”
“The money was just in my account.  I figured I’d better use it.”  Ron shrugged.  “Hey—what were you looking for?”
Whatever it was, they’d done it to Hermione too.  Her words about Ludville had been exactly the same as Ron’s; she never would have even mentioned the case on her own.
Something like energy raced through Harry’s body, sort of like the time he’d got his hands on one of Dudley’s sodas and drank the whole can all in one go.  “What are ghouls like?”
“Yeah,” Harry said, pulling the door closed.
Harry licked dry lips.  “She died of a broken heart,” he said at last.
“I’m there,” Harry said, pointing to the luggage rack, then explaining how he had snuck into the train compartment behind Blaise Zabini after the first meeting of the Slug Club on the train in sixth year. Malfoy, Parkinson, and Zabini all continued talking. Harry could see that underneath Malfoy’s veneer of indifference, he was angry he hadn’t been invited to Slug Club. Harry wasn’t sure whether he had understood at the time that this anger was a result of hurt feelings, but he probably had. Harry hadn’t ever misunderstood Malfoy, not really. He’d known from the beginning that Malfoy was insecure, jealous and vulnerable. Meanwhile,
“A stick?
“Today?” Harry asked, so confused.
you wanted to be an Auror so you could hunt ex-Death Eaters.”
“How do you know?”
“Draco Malfoy.” Luna closed her eyes. She wasn’t wearing any top, and the moon bathed her breasts a luminescent colour under the film of bright water. Her eyes popped open. “You know he kept me in a dungeon? He didn’t come to save me, anyway.”
“Oh,” Luna said. “I thought maybe you were, once.”
“Well, if you’re really okay.”
“Then I guess I can’t make anything you want,” Harry said, losing his patience, “unless it’s fish and chips.”
“Right,” Harry agreed, “but even if the Deal does go through, there are a bunch of details to sort. They’ve spent so long arguing about the terms of the Deal that the actual logistics to make it happen haven’t really even been looked at yet.”
“Without me?”
The side of Hermione’s mouth went in deeper. “But did they make you talk to a llama?”
Draco moved away quickly.  “Of course. I didn’t mean to—”  Abruptly, he stood.  “I’ll begin the washing up.  Would you like to learn more spells after you’re done with dessert?”
Harry wasn’t kidding anybody.  Draco had had to stay in Azkaban to await his trail; then there’d been the trial, then the destruction of the Manor, then the magical restriction.  For the next ten years of memories, he wouldn’t be allowed magic.  All of it would be painful for him.
Harry moved behind Draco’s ear now, along his hairline, down below his ear and against his throat. “I like it when you’re worked up,” he murmured. Hand looser now around Draco’s dick, Harry stroked it slowly—an agonizing speed he would never have wanted for himself.
Draco surged up, tear-stained eyes face-to-face with Harry’s, and then Draco kissed him.  It was a very messy kiss.  Draco’s face was wet, his mouth too full of mucous.  Harry held onto him and kissed him back, until Draco pulled away.  “I’m disgusting.  Sorry.  I shouldn’t have—”
, she’s not right.  She isn’t a pure-blood; she won’t give you pure-blood babies.  You wouldn’t be doing your duty, because she’s a filthy fucking—”
Harry thought wildly, but some things were impossible even with magic.  It’d be better if they weren’t impossible, actually, then maybe Narcissa and Lucius wouldn’t have fucked Draco up so badly with the notion that having a pure-blood wife was an absolute imperative.  “But you like fish and chips?”
“Drop out,” Harry said.
Having Andromeda transfigure marshmallows was a distraction, of course, so that something would keep her away from the hearth.
“Ameles. Use sparingly, never more than once per month. More effective when the moon is waning. Unlike Sweet Dreams, does not take hours to work; will drop you instantly, but do beware that, rather like Dreamless, the sleep is not of high quality. Unlike Dreamless, allows precision in timing—one drop equals approximately fifteen minutes of slumber. Also unlike Dreamless, you do not feel forced awake when wears off; if still sleepy, one may sleep another good eight hours with Ameles only fuelling the first fifteen minutes. Do beware of—”
“Who do you mean?”
“Naturally.” Malfoy got to his feet rather quickly.
“But I don’t—”
Malfoy’s cheeks went pink again, and his chest began to rise and fall at a faster pace. “Do you think that you could—”
Somehow Harry got through the rest of the class, Banishing all thoughts of
“No, because of you.”  Draco gave Harry’s shoulder a squeeze.
Christ.  His mum.  Malfoy’s mum.
legend wasn’t true, but the fickleness of the tree was something to be reckoned with. Sometimes it really
“Oh, yes.  People would sit around the common room wondering what you would say next.  Of course,” Draco went on, picking up his fork, “I always wished it was I they were gossiping about.  I always wanted to say something shocking and clever, but I was much too afraid of getting in trouble to talk back to professors I didn’t like.  When I said things I thought were shocking and clever to other students, I was mainly just being cruel.”
“He’ll be all right.”  Harry waved his wand.  “
me?” Draco said, appalled.  “Potter, there’s nothing to disown.  We don’t have a house; we don’t have any money for her to take away.”
Harry’s Patronus alerted Harry when Draco fell unconscious again.
Harry felt himself begin to smile as he nodded in agreement. “A really special day.”
“It might have come up.”
“You never said how you slept,” Draco said, after Harry had got to eat a whole two eggs and a piece of toast with butter
Harry really shouldn’t be doing this, but if he was going to do it, he should do it right.  He should kiss Draco like Draco deserved; Harry should show Draco how Harry really felt, how much Harry cared.  That wasn’t what Harry did.
Turning back to the little gnome hat he was unearthing, Ron spoke quietly. “I wasn’t worried you thought that. But I wouldn’t be worried if you did.”
“Draco remembers.”
Draco, who had followed him into the kitchen, made a face.  “I detest salad.  Do you call this a kitchen?”
“I think that’s why I—” Harry had to resist going to him, touching him. Malfoy looked like he was in actual pain, and Harry shifted his weight, shuffling. “I think that’s why I fell in love with you,” Harry said. “I didn’t mean to do it. I didn’t notice it was happening. You were just so—so brave, and so stubborn, and . . .”
was—”  Draco sat up further.  “You thought it was me?” he said, sounding a bit pleased.
“Did Pansy call it provincial?” Malfoy took Parkinson’s hand. “I rather hoped she might be here.”
The parchment Malfoy had written on was cream-coloured. His handwriting was so neat. For some reason, Harry tried to imagine Malfoy writing it, but could not. He could not imagine Malfoy’s desk or chair, or what he looked like when he was alone. Harry flipped to the end of the letter, because he remembered Malfoy had been kind. “
Harry and Kavika talked pleasantries for a little while; Kavika had been to see her first granddaughter. Kingsley had only been able to come for a few days now and then, but Kavika had spent almost six weeks with her. Harry teased that Molly was already at seven grandchildren and never seemed tired a whit; Kavika replied she had no ambitions to be Molly Weasley. Kavika asked how the hols had been, and Harry told her.
“I hope I’ve at least got fucked by then.  Wouldn’t it be sad to go through all this, and still be a virgin.”
Fuck.
“He could probably do it,” Harry said.
: Ron. Hermione. Could he see them? Did he want to see them, now? These were important questions to ask, because it could happen—it had happened—that he went to them and they were not what he needed, and he could see in their eyes that they wanted to help and could not, could not. What did he want? Who did he want?
Kavika was probably looking at him, though Harry was still looking at his hands. He could feel her gaze in the silence, her warm dark eyes, the slight curve of full lips, which often looked just a touch sardonic. “In a war, you fight the enemy. Outside of direct conflict, the choices are infinite.”
“What do you want from me?”
“Crow’s feet.  It’s in most potions to do with age.”
“No, we don’t.”  Malfoy handed the phial of Ragerade back.  “It’s got swamp-thing bogies in it.”
“Whatever,” Draco said, sounding more like he had when he was thirteen than he did when he was thirty-two.  “I’ve nothing better to do.”
“No.” Harry’s hand moved over the scar on the back of his hand. “Yes. A little. It reminds me of something I would do, but I didn’t, and it makes me . . . it makes me worried. For him.”
Draco bit his lip, still seeming surprised he was in this position.
“Because you’ve been visiting, you prat.”
Rolling out of the hearth at Number Twelve, Harry tried to keep silent as he brushed the dust and soot off of his clothes and Draco’s nice leather satchel.  Coming here was dangerous; Cecil Vance might be long gone, but that didn’t mean he wouldn’t come back or that other bad people working with him wouldn’t try to rob old-Harry’s house.  Meanwhile, the fawn trotted out of the Floo looking perfectly clean.  Harry guessed being incorporeal had its perks.
“Father said—”  Draco hesitated, glancing at Harry, then back at the fire.  In a blank tone he went on, “He said Dumbledore was deviant.”
“No, he—Father didn’t like Hogwarts very much.  He was—he was very arrogant, Harry.”
“Harry.” Kavika’s voice was particularly warm, her large eyes almost tender. “It’s nice to see you.”
“What’s the difference, exactly?” asked Adebayo’s girlfriend.
“A year at a time.”
Malfoy took a moment, then turned around, squaring his shoulders. “Right,” he said. “You’re a hero, aren’t you? You’ll always be the bigger person.”
Draco’s eyes slid away from Harry’s, and Harry remember what had happened—how Draco had been crying, and Harry had just stood there.  Draco obviously remembered it as well, because this moment was almost a mirror of that one—both of them just standing there, Draco beginning to wrap his arms around himself.
“Okay,” Harry said.  “But it probably won’t change how I feel.  I said I’m stubborn.”
“Not a problem,” Malfoy quipped. “My body is always nice.”
“Wow,” said Teddy, in his smooth, flat way. “Not what I heard.” He had on a little smile, which was surprising. Teddy sometimes teased people, but Harry had only ever seen him do it with affection.
“I’m serious,” said Malfoy. “I pulled the records of every known person who has ever climbed it. None of them were pure-bloods.”
Feeling humiliated, Harry mumbled yes, mostly because his stomach was twisting at the idea of not getting to eat the things making such delicious smells.  Knowing that his face was probably red, Harry sat down at the table.  The scones and bacon flew over, delicately floating down to his plate.  “Thank you,” Harry mumbled, subsequently stuffing his face so he wouldn’t have to say anything more.
“I feel another year coming on,” Draco said, opening his eyes.
“I’m trying,” said Harry.
Draco had been subdued that morning.  This had made Harry wary, such that when Draco pulled him out of the Pensieve, Harry was sort of prepared for another argument about how they weren’t going to dry hump in Draco’s shop.  Meanwhile, Draco was saying, “Look, Potter, look!” and tugging on his arm.  Since Draco seemed to want him to, Harry stood, then Draco pushed him over toward Draco’s Pensieve and shoved Harry’s face down in it.  Harry plunged into the filmy grey of memory, which eventually resolved itself into the same warehouse lab he had been watching hour after hour, day after day.
“Like a Healer?”  Malfoy seemed curious—far more curious than he had seemed when he’d talked about becoming a person of stature.
“Potter,” Malfoy said.  “Fuck, Potter.”  And then Malfoy’s lips were softly pulling on Harry’s lower lip, drawing it into Malfoy’s mouth—hot and wet and soft and oh.
“People think casting a Patronus is about intent, like an Unforgivable, or concentration, like Apparition. It’s not. It’s about letting a feeling inside of you escape and take form. To do it, you have to relax. Take that cloak off.”
Harry remembered now; Draco had said Harry was friends with “the right sort.”  In the picture the brown-haired girl was smiling, while the red-haired man was throwing his head back to laugh.  “They look old,” Harry said.  “Am I friends with them now?”
Harry wasn’t sure whether he should do anything about that. He didn’t exactly fancy giving Malfoy special attention, but he usually tried to help trainees who were struggling. Was Malfoy struggling? Maybe he was just being a prat. Maybe Kavika was right, and Harry shouldn’t even have to deal with him. Maybe Harry could go back to the Board and tell them Malfoy was a terrible student, that Malfoy’s application should never have been approved in the first place. He was Harry Potter; they would listen. He shouldn’t have to—
Draco still looked pleased, but his gaze had dropped.  He was looking at Harry sideways, once again pretending he wasn’t looking at all.  “Would you be very sad?”
Harry thought of what Andromeda had said, of Narcissa going mad, thinking she had ruined her son.  “But—isn’t her top priority
“I know what you think.”
“Malfoy,” Harry said, even more mortified than before.
“Good, you’ve got a pamphlet,” Nyala told the tall woman. “Does anyone else need one?”
“Question you?”
“The ice cream flavour,” Harry said.
“I don’t
“‘Any of those people.’ Do you mean any of the ones I’ve disappointed?”
“We’ll see,” Harry said, but then was terrified that he was flirting in front of the whole class. Would keeping Malfoy after class be inappropriate, when Harry felt this way? Especially if they were to talk about extra credit—
Malfoy looked at the powder as though he had never seen it before.  “Are you sure?”
“Malfoy is an Auror trainee.” Shacklebolt turned. “Mister Malfoy.”
“You want to go save the world,” Harry said.
“Malfoy?” Harry turned back. “Why?”
“Because it’s
Malfoy was working in his lab when Harry Apparated in.  Harry had been hesitant to express how much he liked the way the place looked because he was pretty sure the reasons he liked it were not normal.  It had to do with the Great Hall at Hogwarts and Molly Weasley’s kitchen—the way everything in them was magic and always reminding you they were magic, the way everything was always moving and floating and doing things on their own, a thousand things happening and yet most of them so mundane.  It was so different to a cupboard full of spiders, and different again to the Auror Office, where things were always moving but sometimes wanted to kill you or get powder in your face, or if they didn’t were adding to piles of paperwork whose growth was stressful in their own way.
“It wasn’t just—it’s not a bully,” Harry said. “It’s—because of her boyfriend. Because he’s not magical.”
Draco rolled his eyes.  “Naturally, she sent me chocolates.  It’s my favourite—I just mean, she stopped dressing me up like her little doll.” He added quickly, “Not that she ever—she didn’t
Then there was black and that same cold, squeezing-freezing sensation, the feeling of being pushed through something too small, a sudden thaw directly afterwards.  A swish of lights settled into a row of streetlamps, casting sallow light into another street.  This street was nothing like the last—mostly because it looked like a normal street, with regular pavement and straggly bushes by a littered kerb on one side and a carpark on the other.  On the side with the bushes was a large council estate, all concrete and windows.
“Ah.”  They went back and forth a few times—Draco, then Harry, then Draco.  Suddenly Draco said, “Has anyone ever talked to you about having a wife?”
“Because they won’t have you.” Harry could feel his jaw clenching. He let it clench, for once, letting himself be angry. “They’ve not invited you. No one wants your stink in their parlour, Fudge; the likes of Parkinson and Flint know your odour would cause the Aurors to scent out their dirty little schemes, and the rest of the world is trying to wash its hands of you.”
“What the hell is going on?” Harry asked, Banishing his broom.
“No,” Draco agreed. Then: “Hold me.”
“Does this count?”
Ron’s face darkened. “Is that what you read?”
“I—yes. Potter. Thank you.”
“Draco,” Harry said again, stepping toward him again.
“Sure,” Harry said, “when you had a psychopath who wanted to kill her. But who was he before Voldemort tried to murder me? Who was he, for love of my mum? Who did he decide to be?”
The marble dropped.
want to.
“Right.” Turning away, Harry Banished the sweat in his vest after all, then put it back on. “Maybe Floo me next century? When you’re done taking off your clothes.”
Silence fell over the room like a door shutting between them, invisible and impenetrable. Milligan swallowed. “Maybe you can tell me more about Vinicius,” she said finally. “That way, we can drill down to what you really want to say about him.”
“He’s okay,” Ron said. “They’re both okay.”
“Give it here,” Draco said, holding his hand out and wiggling his fingers.  When Harry gave him the bottle, Draco turned it, as if to look at it in the light.  “I have to drink the whole thing?”
“Those events are in the past,” said Pillwickle.
“It’s pitiable that you still carry such a grudge, after everything that’s happened.” Fudge shook his head again, looking truly disappointed.
“Not if I have to look at you.”
Malfoy looked perfectly at ease, practically lounging in the doorframe, and Harry went straight back seventeen years. Draco Malfoy’s father was still on the board at Hogwarts, and Malfoy’s mother probably still sent Malfoy chocolates even in his thirties. “I know you don’t want to see me,” Malfoy said at last, his voice almost mocking as he came farther into the office.
“Has anything ever stopped you?”
“I could,” Harry said.  “I could try.  What I said—” Harry took a breath.  “About being—”  Another breath.  He couldn’t look at them.  “About being loved.  I wanted you to know that the first person—the first person to help me understand what that could feel like was Hagrid.  And then it was the two of you.”
Harry spoke slowly. “Are you saying you’re in favour of tearing it all down? Without the Deal? Without an agreement?” Kavika did not react to this. “Kingsley’s in charge of the whole Deal.”
Harry still wasn’t sure.
“I danced with him,” Harry said. “At the holiday party.”
Malfoy tilted his head. “Wasn’t it?”
“Zero for today.” Malfoy pushed himself off the wall to shrug. “Too bad, so sad. I’ll make up for it when we do Occlumency. When are we doing Occlumency?” he asked, turning to Adebayo.
“Oh,” Harry said, realizing it slowly. Like Draco’s other spells, this one had done nothing to incur desire. It had only forced his body to respond in a way it sometimes might when experiencing desire, activating salivatory glands to fill his mouth with wetness. He had to swallow to keep it in his mouth. He was almost drooling.
“Malfoy.”  Harry reached out, but Malfoy moved away.
Still feeling wary, Harry felt pretty sure Draco was trying to placate him for some reason or other.  Still, the idea of getting to pick what to eat was definitely attractive.  “Can we have fish and chips?” Harry piped up, after thinking about it a moment.
The papers flew away from the man, who looked surprised.
you discussing matters of national security?”
Mister Malfoy smiled faintly—the first time Harry had seen him smile.  It was nice.  “A Muggle communication device,” Mister Malfoy said.  He didn’t seem to have any problem at all with Harry asking questions, not like Uncle Vernon.  “It’s a kind of telephone.”
Harry sighed.  “Yes, your highness?” he said, because he was too tired to deal with Malfoy acting like a twat.
“I think because—because these were his peers, asking the questions. He doesn’t usually see—he just sees the reporters. He doesn’t see how sometimes it’s everyone; everyone thinks I’m this . . . he doesn’t see that as often.”
Just then, the mug of coffee floated in.  “
“Why is it hard to live with yourself?” Harry asked curiously.
” Draco said, almost at the same time.  A burst of light moved in front of them, seeming to hit an invisible shield in front of Draco.  Jerking hard on Harry’s hand, Draco shouted, “Get behind me!”
“Do you know who
“Fuuuck,” Harry gasped. The sudden, involuntary buck of his hips shoved the dildo in a little deeper, and then he couldn’t help it—his hand tightened, and he was jacking his cock, eyes glued to Malfoy’s pink prick, growing harder and harder. Come was drying on Harry’s face. He wanted to taste it. “Fuck,” he said again, and came.
“You sent your Patronus.”
“Free?”  Proudfoot, who had been leaning back in his swivel chair, suddenly sat up straight.
“You’re so hot,” Harry said immediately. “Sometimes all I have to do is think of you and my dick gets hard.”
While Draco was in the bathroom, Harry made them lunch, thinking about what Draco would remember now.  Seventh year.  From Ginny, Harry had learned what Hogwarts had been like during that time.  Draco hadn’t been the same, she’d said—not like he’d been in fifth year, terrorizing everybody, but Crabbe and Goyle had been worse.  Draco had come home for hols and hadn’t identified Harry; Harry had disarmed Draco and gained control of the Elder Wand.  If the cure had aged Draco back up to when it should—a full year, plus the extra few days after the Sectumsempra—Draco should remember the Fiendfyre, Voldemort dying, his family safe.
“Yes, well.”  Petunia sniffed again, but Harry was pretty sure that this one was a sniff of disdain.  “Don’t die.”
The proprietor of Slug and Jiggers was an awful little man named Abel Alby, who was so delighted to meet Harry he almost fell over.  Savage had already witnessed at least three dozen encounters like these, but still seemed incredulous that anyone could be delighted to know Harry.  “Alby,” she said, waving a bottle of silvery liquid in Alby’s face.  “The potion.”
“Is that why you tried to kill yourself?” asked Carrow.
“Trainees don’t know what they’re doing yet.” Harry rubbed the back of his hand. “I mean, they don’t know what it’s like, what the job is like, and they have instructors, but instructors don’t always . . .” Looking down, Harry saw what he was doing, then thought about his words. Smiling at himself, a little unhappily, Harry looked up again. “Are you going to say this is about my time as a student at Hogwarts?”
“No,” said Harry.
Hermione’s lips quirked. “If it ever happens.”
Harry thought it was a rather neat way for Draco to get out of the question he’d been asked, but Harry was distracted by the prospect of feeding the owl.  Owls ate rodents, Harry had learned in school.  “Do you mean the mouse ears?”
“Good. Let me give it to you.” Draco moved, positioning himself.
eleven.  Christ, you’re so fucking clueless.”  Draco stood, turning his back on him.
“No?” Harry said, then realized he might be being an arse again. “I mean—I’m interested in what you think.”
Unable to think of any reason a pure-blood ball could be of any interest to him, Harry was about to pull his face out, when a figure outside the ballroom caught Harry’s attention. Harry could only just see him through the series of windowed doors, outside on the veranda, talking to another figure in the shadows.
For some reason, Harry’s mouth went dry, and he wanted Malfoy. He wanted Malfoy like he had rarely wanted anything, like he wanted Ron and Hermione when he  was alone and needed someone he could trust, like he had wanted Ginny physically. The two desires married together felt so intense that Harry felt consumed by it, flames licking up his throat, burning his tongue; he couldn’t speak.
Rune went on to answer, and Malfoy, blinking, looked down. Then, noticing that Rune’s water was only half full, he quickly cast an Aguamenti to fill it up again, tapping it again to make it ice cold. This was a good idea, for though tonight the pub was not as full as the night of Fudge’s appointment, it still felt close and crowded. Harry could feel sweat begin at the back of his neck.
Malfoy.
“Oliver Wood?” Draco looked scandalized.  “He’s a fifth year.”
“For a crime he didn’t commit,” Draco went on.
“I’m sure,” Harry said steadily. “Please, I’ve got to go.”
“She wanted him to go on,” Andromeda said, “and he has.  He will.”
“I asked him if he wanted a pint,” said Travers, turning away from Harry to face the group of trainees.
Fuck.
“Yes.” Kavika’s eyes crinkled in inexplicable sympathy. “It will continue, Harry. Only, not by me.”
“How?”
“It’s a privilege to change,” Kavika said, her voice quite tender. “It’s a privilege to grow from hate into love, to become someone else. It’s a privilege to have the time and space and freedom to do it, as Draco has.”
“My father is the best.  Don’t you know—” Cutting himself off, Draco went through a series of expressions.  “I suppose you don’t know after all,” he said finally.  “You haven’t got a dad, have you?”
Harry wondered who told him that, and whether they had used the word
“Sit down,” Malfoy said, taking his touch away.
Oh, God.
“Granger climbed it,” was all Malfoy said. “She was never a trainee.”
Teddy blinked. “Believe it or not, I met several other people at Academy.”
“You do,” Draco said.
When Harry had first started teaching Academy, boggarts had been one of his first lessons. This had been a mistake. At least three of the trainees’ boggarts were Harry himself, and Harry had felt heartbroken that somehow he’d managed to scare his students as much as Snape had Neville.
They knew now.
16 years
Nyala had a round face with a little bud of a mouth and large dark eyes. Her curly hair was piled in a fanciful way atop her head, with little butterflies and flowers nesting in it. “I think Draco is fantastic,” she said, surprised. “You’ve said he is. He’s an excellent sparring partner.”
Clutching the badge tighter, Harry said, “I’m sorry.”
Harry closed his eyes.
“Ron,” Harry said.  “How could you possibly afford them?”
“Draco,” Harry said, after fetching the cure from the locked cabinet.  He turned on the light.
George lit up. “Don’t want to know if your wife has the hots for a—”
Harry wanted to laugh, because Draco was not actually attractive in that moment—looking so pale and thin and worn, with hollows under his eyes and that snooty look on his face.  “Yeah,” Harry agreed, smiling.  “Is now okay?”
“I should imagine so.”  Mister Malfoy smiled faintly again.  He still didn’t look happy about it, but it was a better smile than before.  “I always admired how honest you were.  I . . . never told you that before.”
“What’s wrong?”
They Apparated into a new room with a loud pop.  “
“I know another one.”
“You’re saying I should?”
“But I’m
The expression of concentration tightened. “Oh.” The expression released, and Malfoy opened his eyes. “That’s why you took off the sound bubble.” All the doors and windows in the house of Malfoy’s face were open now, sympathetic. “I’m sorry.”
Just then Harry felt himself begin to shrink.  Draco’s hand started to loosen—either because Harry’s hand was growing smaller or because Draco was letting go.  Harry’s hand tightened.  “I liked being you,” he said, feeling himself grow even smaller, until he was swimming in Draco’s posh trousers and dress shirt.

“What?” Harry’s hand loosened in surprise.
“Indeed.”  Mister Malfoy took something out of one of the cabinets, but it looked much more like bread than cake, and Harry tried not to feel disappointed.  “I’ve realized it’s our in-between birthday.”
“Oh.” Feeling unsettled without quite knowing why, Harry began, “I just—I just assumed . . .”
Draco pulled his head out of the window.  “We have a roast at Christmas.”
“I’m not defending him,” Harry snapped.  “I’ve merely—”
“Merlin,” Malfoy babbled on, walking over to another table to flick his fingers on a series of phials hanging on a stand.  “I wonder what
Harry sat up straight, spilling Draco out of his arms.
“I’m going to read this letter,” Harry said, swallowing a sigh as he pulled the folded parchment out of his robe.  “So, if you could just—be quiet.  For a few minutes.”
him.” Raising his wand, Malfoy pointed it at the tree. “
“How do you know?” said Savage.
“Trees can be timeless,” was all Harry said.
“Granger,” Mister Malfoy said.  His voice was low just like it had been earlier, but also nothing like it.  Then it had been warm.  Now it was arctic.
“Do you think the Deal has anything to do with your nightmares?”
“Come forward and testify that the memory is their own. Yes, yes. I’ve taken Spragg’s Magical Law.”
“Rune Photsi,” Harry said, still speaking rather slowly, without inflection. “He’s dancing with Draco Malfoy.”
Harry very gently traced the shell of Draco’s ear, and Draco shuddered.
“He’s growing up! Spreading his wings! Leaving the nest!” she had told Harry, when Harry had come for a Sunday brunch and she hadn’t been able to say where Teddy was.
“But I don’t need fixing,” Harry heard himself saying, and he didn’t even know why he was saying it; it was like his mouth wasn’t connected to his brain.  “I’m just fine!  You just don’t want to have to spend time with me!”
They changed the floor green, and the ceiling blue, the bookcases purple with yellow polka dots.  Draco made his own shirt yellow with orange stripes, then his hands blue, his hair pink.  Harry smiled, and Draco looked so, so pleased.  Then Draco did
“I do.  I wish,” Draco said, but stopped.  “I wish . . . oh fuck.”  Tears began to fill his eyes.  “You’re a
, you know.  That’s not discreet at all.  But I—well, never bother.”
“Because when you grow up—”
“But wizards can cast a Patronus. Muggles can’t. Surely that’s something,” said Josias Flint, one of Marcus’s cousins.
“I know that this communication is extensive, too much so, but I have considerable experience in this area. Given your late discovery of Sweet Dreams, I thought perhaps you had not had the opportunity to make further such discoveries, but forgive me again if I presume. I would be happy to meet in person to discuss any questions; I do not expect you to read this whole thing. Forgive me. Thank you again for the Sweet Dreams. I am honoured beyond measure that you thought of me, that you think of me at all. I want you to sleep beautifully; I want your dreams to be all the good things you deserve. I’m sorry this is so long; forgive me; it is late. Thank you for you helping me always.
“Yes,” Harry said, feeling a familiar sting.  “I think—I think people made fun of Snape.  And it wasn’t right.”
The portrait Draco was pointing to was of a young boy around Harry’s age.  His hair was quite long and black, his expression annoyed.  Both the expression and his hair reminded Harry of the black-haired girl from the previous page, as did his robes.  Everyone else in all the pictures were dressed very nicely, but Sirius Black looked dishevelled, as if he didn’t care what he looked like.  “Who’s that?” Harry asked, pointing to a portrait of a younger boy.  He looked like he could be Draco, if Draco had dark hair and were not quite so handsome.
“How did it happen this time?” Kavika said, taking her own seat with her own cup, then taking a slow sip.
“How about the parchment?  You give the wand a little flick, like you would beckon with your finger.  Then you say, ‘
“Robards told a different story,” Fudge said.
“Oh, do you mean their ‘institution blood purism’ is going to save me? Pull the other.”
“Heavens.”  Draco rolled his eyes.  “You don’t mean the Wellbeday primer, do you?”
Orientation was on a bright day in September, the reporters clustered around the Pallas Arch dressed almost as they might for summer. They were waiting to ask questions about Draco Malfoy and Teddy Lupin, but Harry had brought a broom in expectation of this, and Teddy was unrecognizable upon his arrival, which had always been his main advantage against reporters.
“Is it something about that owl?”  A woman holding a baby came to the door, and Harry knew who she was.
“No,” Harry said, unable to explain.  “It doesn’t—it hasn’t anything to do with you.”
“Is that enough?” asked Lee.
“Oh, I just didn’t think you were fast enough.”
Turning back to Baggot, Savage went on, “I’m telling you; it’s probably Malfoy.”
“I was dosed with something,” Harry gritted out, realizing that must be why he was reacting this way.  “I had tea.”
“Not Fairchild.”
“Did you see that Rune and Vinicius Souza were dancing?” Malfoy said suddenly.
“I don’t want you to touch it.”  Draco looked devastated.  “I don’t want you to ever have to touch it.”
“I meant,” Harry began.
As though encouraged by Harry’s partial smile, Malfoy warmed to the subject. “Don’t ask me for a Granger, though. Those are one of a kind. Will a Granger-Weasley do? I hear there are one or two of those.”
She had also told him she shouldn’t be his only resource when he felt he needed what she called
“What, are you spying on me in addition to kidnapping?  Isn’t that called stalking?”  Harry had heard of bad old men who did terrible things to kids.  He didn’t know what kinds of things, but he wasn’t particularly interested in sticking around to find out.
“‘If you have anything to say about it,’” Malfoy repeated stiffly. “You do know you’re in charge of the course, right?”
“Pretend it’s from Santa. Pretend it’s from God, or Godric—I know!” Malfoy snapped his fingers. “Pretend you pulled it out of a hat.”
Then Draco was finishing up, cruelly pulling out. “Shuffle down, Harry,” Draco said.
Ron hit him back. “Not his wife. A daughter? I think there were two. Don’t you remember Daphne?”
They stared at him.  Harry hadn’t got a chance to tell them what had really happened; Hermione had been dealing with the mole in the Department of Mysteries, and he and Ron had been cleaning up the Auror Office.  There had been so many hours of questioning people and taking sworn testimony and then having to talk to people about what to tell the press, and then there’d been tracking down brewers Alby had supplied who hadn’t been caught; they’d been working with MACUSA to make sure information about the Fountain of Life was on lockdown.
“Oh.”  Draco wiggled in his seat, as though trying to shake himself out of seeming incredibly pleased.  “Well, I’ve always had a talent for—wait a minute, when you were ten?  Kids don’t get their Hogwarts letters until they’re eleven.  Did we—did I get to meet you before going to school?”  Draco frowned.  “It must happen very soon after this; I have my letter already.  When’s your birthday?”
“Me?” Malfoy seemed shocked that he would be asked such a thing.
Malfoy was desperate for this kiss, Harry realized. He had been desperate for it forever, if those things he had said were true—those things about his cells and his Pensieve and living on just a glance for weeks—and weeks—Harry gave it to him. He wanted to give him everything. He wanted to reach down inside of Malfoy with his tongue and hands and body and take away sad memories of loving and not being loved, replaced them with memories of this kiss. Harry didn’t regret not having loved Malfoy earlier; he only regretted the pain those memories must hold for Malfoy. He wanted to kiss them away, his mouth moving hotly over Malfoy’s, his body pressing in until Malfoy, making a muffled sound, began to give ground, backing up until he was against Harry’s desk.
Harry could have said something indeed; he’d just been waiting for Draco to pay attention to him.  Harry swallowed, remembering that he hadn’t wanted Draco to worry.  “I’ve got to leave for a while, and I want to cast a few protection spells on you to keep you safe while I’m gone.”
This was stunning enough that Harry quickly cast a Notice-Me-Not and slipped away to catch a breath, his Patronus returning to him once he was closer to the house, along with Ron’s terrier. “We’re all right, Harry.” Ron’s Patronus went on to describe Diagon Alley, where Ron was stationed. “We’re having to move the non-magicals out,” he was saying, “otherwise, they’ll crush themselves trying to see a goblin, or a magic broom. But obviously, no one likes being moved by magic, especially without their permission, and there’s a question of how far to go—do we keep on moving them when they’re crushing each other outside of the Alley? The non-magical police are here—”
“Who are they?” Harry asked, looking more closely at the brown-haired girl and red-headed man.
Harry watched, strangely compelled.  He’d seen Malfoy do magic before.  He’d seen plenty of people do magic before, but Harry hadn’t seen Malfoy do it since school.  Malfoy hadn’t
“I don’t want to hurt anybody.” Harry looked out the window, where the sun was slowly setting somewhere, invisible in the already grey light. “I just wanted to live my life. Like anybody else.”
“You’ve seen him send your godson little breezes?”
Harry moaned, partly from Draco’s words, partly because he really thought he could come, just from getting fucked on both ends, just from
“Want some coffee?” she said.
Malfoy’s head jerked back, his eyes rather large.
“Fuck,” Malfoy muttered.
When Harry got out of the shower, Harry put his glasses on to find that clothes were waiting for him and the pyjamas were gone, just like the day before.  Knowing Draco must have spelled them in, Harry felt even more mortified than before, because it meant that Draco had found out Harry was showering and still liked him enough to make magic clothes for him.  Feeling like the most complete prat in the world, Harry dried himself as slowly as possible and then tried to take even longer dressing, not knowing what he would do when he was finished.
Once Harry was done with the note, he took it over to Draco and Heloise, who was happily snatching treats from Draco’s hand.  “She really does like me,” Draco said eagerly, looking up at Harry.
Harry wasn’t ashamed, but he had been a bit afraid Mister Malfoy might get angry.  He supposed at Hogwarts people were meant to be doing magic, as it was a school for witchcraft and wizardry.  That there could be a whole school full of people doing funny business without getting in trouble for it seemed strange.  If Uncle Vernon knew about it, he wouldn’t like it at all.
Just outside the anti-Apparition wards, Crowley Stott Library was an archive for the Ministry as well as a resource for the Academy. The central corridor of the massive stone building was lit only by the reading room at the top of the main staircase at the end of the hall, making the large space cool and cavernous. The Memory Wing, however, featured floor-to-ceiling cathedral windows, spilling morning light into a clean, spacious room, the shelves of memories in their glass vials reflecting that light until the whole room felt shining with silver memory and golden sun. The Pensieves stood on pedestals, one in front of each window, with partitions between the windows in case the viewings needed to be private. Velvet curtains could be drawn to close the booths off completely.
“I have,” Harry said, “in fact.”
Harry wished he’d been made for him. He wanted to be nothing other than this moment, this moment in which he was loved and adored with this warm person on top of him who liked him well enough to say such a thing. Squeezing Draco’s arse again, Harry said hoarsely, “Say it again.”
“So far?” About three weeks of classes had passed, and Harry thought about them. “Unimpressive.”
Harry’s attention snapped back to Malfoy, who was looking about the room while pointing at Parkinson. “Character defamation! I say, character defamation!” Malfoy didn’t exactly sound as though he expected anyone to respond to this alarm.
“Our Chosen One.” Malfoy still had on his smirk. “Why don’t you get your Mudblood friends to help you?”
Kavika would have said.
“Does decorous mean boring?” Harry said, dipping another strawberry even though he had another full one waiting to go.
The confusion must have shown on Harry’s face, because Fudge went on to say, “The bias against pure-bloods.”
“Can’t say we’re happy to have you back,” said Robards.
, and
“But it’s not the land’s fault,” Draco added, more lightly.  “It used to be a beautiful place—the most beautiful place in the whole world.  I think—I think the land would like to know that there are boys on it, flying and playing Quidditch and having a good time.  That—that used to happen a lot, here.”
“Um.”
“You distracted me,” Harry accused.
“That’s never bothered you before.”
, but he really hoped she wasn’t going to say something like,
“And thank you,” Harry went on.  “For the indicator solution.”
“Let’s try something different.  I’ll hold you until it doesn’t hurt to remember.”  Wrapping his arms around Draco tight, Harry Apparated them both upstairs, sitting down on the sofa with Draco.  “
“I never said that.”
For supper they had fish and chips again, which Harry had asked for when Draco again told him he could have anything he wanted.  Draco hadn’t seemed excited to have it again, but he made it anyway.  Afterwards they had ice cream, because Draco said it was still their in-between birthday.
“But your shop,” Harry went on, realizing he didn’t want to leave.  It was such a nice place, nicer than any place he’d ever been before.  He’d never even been inside any of the cupboards.
“I guess because Gryffindor was always winning it.”  Harry shrugged as though it was no big deal—which it wasn’t, any more, only it obviously still was to Malfoy.
“It has to brew first.”  Mister Malfoy sat across from him.  “Your cousin might be worried about you,” he said.  “You could write to him by owl to let him know you’re okay, though with the way you write at this age, he might not feel satisfied.  I could brew a potion to simulate your adult voice, so you could call him on a mobile.”
Harry rather thought Andromeda was teasing again, but this time at Draco’s expense.  Harry didn’t like it.
“I don’t know,” Harry said, but the blade was whirring over his voice.
“Don’t choose a memory about how it was meant to be happy,” Harry said. “Choose something that was actually happy.”
“Malfoy,” Harry said again, but wasn’t sure what to say.
“I like that,” Harry breathed, when Draco pulled back for air. “What you—what you said.”
A few of the trainees tittered nervously, which was expected. Harry’s fling with Andre Ricci had been all over the news when it had happened. Harry hadn’t really thought of himself as bisexual when it had been going on. He hadn’t really been thinking of anything except for the fact that Andre was the first person since Ginny that he had wanted, but the press had had quite the day defining him, and Harry supposed the definition worked.
“Cheer up,” Ron said, clapping Malfoy on the back, not very gently. “After another eight to ten years, you might even pass Level One—then who knows? Anyone can be an Auror, if they put their mind to it.”
“Oh, Draco,” Harry said, then pulled him close.
“That’s all right,” Teddy said.  “You want to practice hugging?  You can practice on me.”  Teddy looked at him sardonically, which was his general look.  “You know I love you too, right?”
“You’re bringing food?” Hugo poked his head in the Floo.
Harry wished that Ron was there, and Hermione. Turning around, he went to go find Teddy.
No one on the Board of Regents
“No.”  Draco closed the door again and opened another door.
“I must do,” Malfoy said carelessly.
“No.  Don’t bother about it.  It was from a very long time ago.”
“I want to look at your mum,” Harry said, because Draco was starting to turn the page.  Draco went back, and Harry peered at the three portraits of the black-haired girl, the brown-haired girl, and the blonde.  They looked young, between the ages of twelve and sixteen.  “Which one is she?” he asked, but even as he was asking he already knew.  The blonde girl was the most beautiful girl Harry had ever seen, and she looked exactly like a younger Draco.
“Er,” Harry said, because he’d never thought that far ahead.  “Buildings?  Mostly I wanted to drive a JCB.”
“Oh, yes,” Harry said.  “I was ten.  You taught me the colour spells, all of them.”
Harry, who had been sitting on the edge of his desk to watch, as this exercise usually required very little interference from him, took a sip of coffee. “Not everyone has gone.”
milk and sugar,” Mister Malfoy said, pointing through the door again.  “Did you want to contact your cousin?” he asked.
will be the ones dealing with the chaos after Reveal, not—”
Malfoy looked scandalized. “Never.”
Harry wanted to say, but he didn’t. He’d never asked for any of it.
Once Harry was closer, he could see that Malfoy had gone pale, but for the point of colour high on either cheeks. His eyes were bright, but he was trembling, ill-contained by the straight set of his shoulders. Harry wanted to hold him; he wanted to soothe him. He wanted to kiss him until Malfoy saw stars, until Malfoy couldn’t think straight. He wanted to feel Malfoy’s hands, his body, his tongue, his teeth, his hips, his cock, his back, his thighs.
Harry could feel blood rushing in his ears, but he knew he had interpreted wrong.  He must be interpreting wrong.  “We’re not roommates,” Harry said, trying to speak without inflection, because no way was a ten-year-old talking to him about whether his grown-up counterpart was sleeping with him.  Just no way.
Malfoy’s eyes were still closed, his lips still wet.  “What?” he said, opening his eyes as if with effort.  They looked dazed with lust.
“So was the war,” Teddy said. “But this time, this one’s mine.”
“Yes.”
“She says—she says the
This was more than enough. Harry already knew he had to turn this memory over to the Department, but Malfoy was still talking.
“Okay,” said Doctor Yin.
“Right.  Like . . . er.”  Harry struggled to think of one.  “Cinderella.”
“No,” Harry said, because it was true.  He’d had to stay in the cupboard for days at a time, and he’d had to miss meals; Uncle Vernon had shouted, and Aunt Petunia had screeched; Uncle Vernon had grabbed him and shoved him around, but they had never punched him or used knives or anything like that.  So Harry had never been hurt because of it.
Andromeda was a very industrious woman who was always busy doing industrious things: knitting, gardening, periodically running a Squib kindergarten as well as competing in magical cycling, which she said was the real reason the other members of the Black family had stopped talking to her.
“My father and mother are in prison and I can’t do magic.  Do you think I’m okay?”
Trying to decide whether he recognized the man, Harry backed up another step, the big boots almost falling off.  He was fairly certain he would have remembered if any teachers at St Grogory’s looked like this bloke, for the man’s appearance was singular.  He was tall and slender, like a straw, and pale too, as though the colour had been leaked out of his hair, eyes, and skin.  His clothes were strange, like an outfit from one of Petunia’s costume dramas, but they seemed to be the right size.  “Who are you meant to be?” Harry asked.
Harry also hadn’t said, because he didn’t even want to think of that yet. Though maybe he could tell Kavika. He could probably tell Kavika. She would probably have something very reasonable to say.
“Malfoy said to give it to you when you were done,” Lee said, pressing the broom handle into Harry’s hand.
“You’re Draco’s mum’s sister,” Harry said.  “I saw you in a photo album.”
in any capacity.  “I’m trying to say that I need you to do this,” Harry went on, feeling annoyed.  “Robards doesn’t want me talking to you, but I need to, so that I can help people.”
Frantic, Harry began Accio’ing things from all over Draco’s lab, making a pile that he put into a bowl, then took with him when he Apparated back upstairs.
“Why was I using your wand?” Harry said.  “If wands are so personal.”
This made Harry chuckle. “Right. I just mean, I was always doing things that I thought weren’t getting done. But when I killed Voldemort, and the war ended—I didn’t know how to put Lucius Malfoy in Azkaban for longer than he got. I didn’t know how to remake the Ministry. I think a part of me thought . . . I wouldn’t need to.”
, Harry felt, but she was being kind. She was being kind and didn’t understand what he had said.
“Why?”
“Yes.  We’re friends.
Malfoy saving that non-mag man in Windermere Hall, Malfoy on the cover of
“Destruction.”
Harry shrugged.  “You always know it’s me.”
When Draco turned twenty-two, Harry entered Tailored Tinctures to find Draco in the lab.  The second Harry put his foot in the door and saw Draco, however, Harry froze.
Harry glanced at it, then up at Draco’s face.  “You’re a civilian.”
“Yes, well.” Malfoy tugged his sleeve again. “And look what he’s done for the cause. He’s put us all into hiding and made us all mistrust each other; that’s what.”
Books were spread out everywhere.  Harry could see some of the ones that had been burned, laid out carefully, as though for a project.  “I never saw you when we were nineteen,” Harry said.  “Or when we were twenty.”
“I didn’t know him very well,” Draco said, playing a card.  “But I was with him when he died.”
“Oh.” Malfoy looked away again.
Harry gripped Malfoy by the nape more tightly. “Hold still,” he said, knowing that knitting and reknitting feeling of scar-healing could be in the very least itchy, and at most quite painful.
“Auror Potter,” said Ichabod Carrow, a reporter for
“Fancy meeting you here.” Vinicius flashed a dazzling smile, and he was still the best-looking bloke in the room besides Rune. And Ron.
“Not anymore. I mean, he doesn’t hate me anymore.”
“You said you cooked.”
“Don’t think that’ll get you out,” said Yin. “I’m here for the dirt. What changed?”
Ron had asked.
“You do,” Draco went on, getting out of the bed as well.  “But she marries that snivelling Weasel idiot.”
“Don’t,” Harry said, but Teddy was already Apparating, and Harry was left alone in the kitchen, listening to the sound of the dripping sink.
But maybe Malfoy didn’t. Harry had never heard any rumours that Malfoy was a Revealer.
“I didn’t mean we couldn’t,” said Harry.
“It’s got crocodile tears,” Malfoy said, looking into the berry mixture.
New Year’s Eve at the Burrow passed like many other New Years’ Eves, the children and some of the adults setting off the firecrackers in the yard, the rest of the family talking politics on magically warmed couches and chairs as they watched the show. This year’s conversation, as it had the past four years, revolved around the Deal, but in the coming year there was also the election to consider. Though the vote itself would take place before Reveal was scheduled to occur, the new Minister of Magic would not officially begin until after, which meant that as things stood, Fudge was in complete control of the Deal.
in the Auror Force?” Spragg asked of Savage.
“Good,” Harry found himself saying, then saw Draco’s face.  “Not keeping it a secret from her,” Harry backtracked.  “But going after what you want—it’s good.  I always thought—that’s always how you came across to me.”
“Don’t eat if you’re not hungry, Harry.”  Mister Malfoy’s voice had changed from amusement to something like concern, but Harry didn’t want to look at Mister Malfoy’s face.  He didn’t want to look at anything.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said.  “I . . . might have led him to believe you could get around them.”
Swallowing a sigh, Harry turned away, leaving Malfoy to his reading, his tree, his scent of cinnamon. Malfoy didn’t deserve Harry’s forgiveness, but everyone deserved to be quiet and contemplative for the space of an hour. Everyone deserved some peace, even if not everyone got to have it.
Her little joke deserved a smile, and Harry wearily gave her one. “No. I guess . . . he was loud. And bossy. Malfoy . . . he called attention to himself. He doesn’t now. He’s almost . . .” Harry waved a hand. “His marks are terrible. But other than that, he’s almost . . . forgettable.”
“Shh,” Malfoy murmured, and then took his hand away.  “I know what’s wrong with you.”
“That’s okay,” Draco said, his voice warm.  “I’ll teach you a charm to keep it in your sleeve.”
When they got back to the Auror Office, Savage went over to chat with Proudfoot instead of going over the case files as Harry had expected.  “New consultant in town,” Savage told Proudfoot, grabbing the phial of Dream Dram from Harry.
“And you’ll come tomorrow?”  Draco looked up, not sounding so put out about it now.
“What?” Malfoy said, which meant he was truly startled.  Malfoy almost always said "pardon".
he’s a ‘media sensation.’ You don’t like that he disrupted one of your little meetings.”
Pulling out the parchment from his satchel again, Harry checked the number.  It was the correct address.  Harry reached for the handle on the door.
“Of course,” said Rodolphus, fluidly standing to go to the trunk by the back wall. “In this trunk are three Dementors.”
Taking off his glasses, he turned on the tap, filled his hands with water, and dipped his face in. When he stood straight again, he dried his face with a towel, put his glasses back on, and saw Draco Malfoy standing there quite still, staring.
Lifting the wand, Harry pointed at the table, then the chairs, then the curtains.  “
“Yes,” Harry said, turning away from Malfoy, from the broom held in Malfoy’s sagging grip. “There’s a blood purity problem at Auror Academy. Hate-speech has been scrawled on the walls regularly, in mud and blood, which as we know is in itself a message of blood supremacy and bigotry. One of our trainees has been regularly harassed.”
?” Penelope sounded appalled. “You think he’s out there, saving the world?”
“We have it.”
“Just—not right now,” Draco said, shrugging away.  “Not today.”
“Why he would what?” Harry asked.
“It will be all right.”  A moment later Harry Apparated, leaving Draco wrapped in so many safety shields that he probably wouldn’t be able to sneeze without Harry knowing.
Hermione was an Unspeakable, but though she was Harry’s best friend, she was dedicated to her job.  She would never reveal anything about one of their cases—not even whether the case was actually theirs.  Robards had led Harry straight up to a dead end.  There was nowhere left to go.
Afterwards, Kavika had done Legilimens with him, the mental exercises. Harry had been afraid a part of Voldemort’s soul was still stuck in him, but that wasn’t the case.
to save us!”
I shag whomever I please?  Why wouldn’t I shag you?”
“You’ve made things such as?”
“My fiancé is,” said Farichild.
Malfoy’s head snapped up. “Pardon?”
“We haven’t talked about Draco Malfoy very much,” said Kavika. She was a wide woman with greying black hair, which she usually kept tied in a messy knot at the nape of her neck.
“Hullo, Travers,” Harry said, trying not to sound like he hated the idea of having to talk to anyone.
“Crocodile tears?”
“The current Minister for Magic is right behind you, and his
Teddy frowned at him, the long eyebrows he had on today slanting down, the soft mouth pursed.  Usually Teddy didn’t change his mouth, unless he really wanted to look like someone else.  He said that was the hardest part.  “Ye-es?” he said, with some hesitation.  “Are you—is something wrong?”
Kavika shrugged. “Reveal is about as drastic as slaughtering all the non-mags, to some people.”
“No,” Harry said, but then he touched the scar on the back of his hand.
Why Narcissa emphasized discretion with her son was becoming very clear, and yet, if Harry ever got to hear Draco talk this way at school, several things might have also become very clear.  Harry wanted to be sad about it—he
“Right,” Harry said. “But what should I do?”
“Simple,” Ron said. “All witches and wizards already know each other. There’s, like, twelve of us. There’s no one left to meet.”
Rune Photsi.”
“Like a nanny cam?” the driver said, looking at Harry through his rear-view mirror.  “That’s amazing!  I should get one for my kids!”
The March day was fading, casting gold light into the courtyard in shafts the building allowed. Malfoy’s hair lit up with it, looking almost bright again, the way it used to.
“Trying to help?”
,” Harry said, backing up a step.  “I’m not a
Yin shrugged. “I just don’t see it. What you’re meant to see. For me, there are like . . . maybe twenty faces. I sort people into face categories—that person’s blah with brown hair, that person’s blah with wide features, that person’s blah in a dainty delicate way; that’s all. But then you get to know them and it’s like—the corner of that person’s eye turns in such a way that it inspires the sun to rise in the horizon of their face.”
“Shh,” Harry said, because Draco had said it to child-him.  “I do like you.  I do.”
“Do you know they’re safe?”
me,” Malfoy said, wrenching away.
Rolling the paper back up, Harry handed it to Mister Malfoy.
“Malfoy,” Harry said incredulously. “Do you think they’ll—what, lay charges on you? For being at a party?”
“But was it
When Harry turned to follow, Alby grabbed his sleeve.  “I don’t employ criminals,” he assured Harry.
”  It still didn’t move.
They didn’t finish brewing more indicator solutions by supper-time, mainly because indicator solutions were a very difficult thing to brew—even though Draco said they were lucky that they didn’t have to wait for the moon or stars or anything to make it work.  When they stopped, Draco said that Harry should choose what to have for supper.  Harry was getting the impression Draco was very done with fish and chips, but Harry couldn’t think of anything else besides the beef wellington, which had also been very good.  “Er,” he’d said finally.  “Hamburgers?”
“The warehouse on Colville Road,” Harry said, pointing his wand at Alby.  “Why were you there?”
Almost sighing, Harry pulled off the cock, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. “What?”
“I’m not discreet.”  Draco flapped his arms wildly.  “Mother was right—I’ll
“Get out,” Savage told the customer at the door, pushing them and shoving the door closed.
,” Harry said, trying the to mimic Draco’s movements.  A cloud came out the end of his wand as well.
“What about that?” Draco whispered, then dragged the green head over Harry’s lips. “Do you want some of that?”
Alby began to protest.  “You can’t—”
“But Malfoy.”
“Malfoy . . .” Harry waited, because Malfoy had to know why he was here, but Malfoy had fixed his gaze on the Veritascope on Harry’s desk, leaning over to look at it. “You’re failing my course,” Harry said.
“And split us in the middle?” Malfoy looked disgusted, and Harry felt a surge of affection for him so profound that it made him want to see Malfoy smile again, look happy, look triumphant, the way he had when he’d beaten Harry at sparring.
“I like to take credit I’m due.”
“What?” Harry said, not understanding.
?  He’s an oaf anyway!”
Mister Malfoy just sighed.  “I was used to getting my way.  You obviously are too.  There was no possibility, in retrospect, that we would work well together.”
“Yes,” Duggins was saying. He hesitated. “I mean—plenty of people are quite upset about the appointment. Understandably so, given that some of Minister Fudge’s policy positions are less than palatable.”
“Can I hug you?” Harry said.
As far as Harry knew, Narcissa didn’t live with Draco after Azkaban.  As far as Harry knew, she was admitted straight to Janus Thickey.  Harry swallowed hard, wondering how much Draco knew at this point, wondering how much Harry should tell him.  “I thought she liked your hair?  Wasn’t she the one who—” Harry stopped himself, thinking perhaps he shouldn’t remind Draco that he knew about the ribbons.  “I thought your dad was the one who made you get it cut?”
“Maybe Draco isn’t in love with you,” Kavika said at the beginning of December, a few weeks after the incident with the Patronus.
“Okay,” said Ron. “You can look after his safety if he’s your student. What I meant was, you don’t have to put yourself on the line. You don’t have to invest in him.”
“Good,” Malfoy said, taking the bottle away.  “That was a Cure-All.  Now we’ll work on the diagnostics.”
“Do you require further services?”
“It’s a
He wanted to find Malfoy. He wanted to know if—had Astoria made sure he knew this for a reason? Had she merely been correcting
“Don’t be a ponce,” Harry said.  “Drink your potion.”
“No. Yes. I meant—the other thing. You called me—” Harry broke off, swallowing.
Because all of the Aurors were occupied preparing for a Reveal that might not occur, graduation was a small affair without alumni. Of the Board of Regents, only Bernard Bickford stayed for the entire ceremony, mainly to loudly lament the absence of the Timothy Tree and the rushed nature of the proceedings, which he found did not suit the majesty and tradition of the Academy.
“Is he nice?”  Harry took his turn again.
“It absolutely is, one-hundred percent. And it’s got worse since you even last heard; let me tell you.”
“Like a—a magic spell?”
At precisely seven o’clock that evening, Malfoy rolled out of the Floo looking as pristine as always. Harry still didn’t know how people did that; he’d always had trouble with Floos, even from the start. Malfoy was already surveying the territory, as though the cottage was a place he might one day like to live. Crossing to the window across from the hearth, Malfoy looked out on the garden. “Excellent lawn,” he commented.
“Come along, Potter,” Mister Malfoy said, tone dismissive.  “In good time.”  Before Harry could scramble away, Mister Malfoy was grabbing his arm again and waving his stick.  The street began to melt, greys and browns swirling together like a painting, like that other room with the broken glass.
Harry surveyed the growing crowd, the long line of cars. In the distance, he could hear sirens. “It’s not that bad, but I think—it has the potential to get worse.”
Draco looked up at him quickly.  “It’s a she?”
“You don’t believe in soulmates,” Milligan said.
They went to the Leaky.  Harry gave Draco black hair and green eyes and a foot in height but didn’t manage the beard or the scar.  Just to ‘amuse himself,’ as adult-Draco had said, Harry gave himself blond hair and grey eyes, fixed his eyes so he didn’t have to wear his glasses, and hid the beard and scar.  At the inn, Draco did make fun of the lighting, and the floor, and the furniture, and Lucille, the waitress.  He also peevishly said something about reading the menu to Harry, but once they got their Butterbeers he said, “You like Butterbeer as well?”
“Humiliation?” Harry hazarded.
“Why are you so obsessed with me?”  Draco put his arm over his eyes.  “Why can’t you leave me alone?”
“Quit it,” Harry snapped, because Malfoy kept
“That’s a funny name,” Harry pointed out.
Malfoy wasn’t looking at him any longer.  He also wasn’t looking sullen any more, his face a blank mask.  His eyes grey eyes looked brighter with his skin so clear.  Hastily, Harry turned back to Mrs. Mulpepper.  “That’s right,” he added intelligently.
Harry had thought Draco would do something else unfamiliar, but when Draco pointed his wand again, it was the typical cleaning spell. That always felt good, but strange, absolutely evacuating Harry’s guts, leaving them clean and empty.  There followed the protection spell—a special lining, so nothing harmful could be absorbed, as well as protection for the delicate tissues, so there could be no tearing. Then there was the lubrication spell—which Harry always found disappointing, as he preferred the manual treatment, and then—something else.
“I would say the threat level is low,” Teddy said, in his easy, laid back way.
“Right,” Harry said slowly. “I have to go to my office and prepare for the day. If you don’t have a difference of opinion.”
“He was doing something
“They can’t be your only emotional support,” Kavika had said.
It remained closed.
“I—sometimes,” Harry said.  “Sometimes I don’t—it’s like I don’t know.  What I feel.  It’s like I can’t—I can’t feel anything.  But sometimes I do—feel things, and I can’t—I just can’t—it doesn’t come out.  I don’t know how to . . . make it come out.”
Hermione lay sprawled on the floor, her hair spread like a wave. Ron was crumpled nearby.
Ron looked terribly interested while pretending he was interested at all. “What am I asking?”
Putting the years together in his head, Harry grabbed the phial of Dream Dram from Savage.  “Do you know anything about this?” he said, shoving the phial under Malfoy’s nose.
, Mister Malfoy had said, when he’d taught Harry the spells.  The bread went wobbly; then Mister Malfoy said another incantation.
The walls were also shaking.
“It wouldn’t work,” Astoria said. “You’d have to Apparate.”
Malfoy’s face twisted in impatience.  “I meant—how you felt.  What about when you were on the run—no place to sleep, hardly anything to eat, and you were be hunted.  How was it then?”
“Harry.” Draco kissed him—not a teasing kiss; it was a kiss that felt like Draco needed it. “Harry,” he said again, sounding almost desperate. “You’re perfect.”
“Because I haven’t got to fly in a long time,” Draco said in this perfectly friendly, reasonable voice.  “You remind me of the times we were in school, and we flew so often then.  I’ve realized I miss it.”
“How nice,” said Andromeda. “Eat!”
“That’s all right.  Have I told you about the one where Dad got me a dragon?  It was in an egg.  Selling dragon eggs is illegal, you know, only
of the kindergarten to train non-magical people—adults and kids alike.”
, Kavika had said.
“At this rate,” Harry said, “I’m not sure I’ll even get into the Academy. You lot have a habit of blocking the entrance.”
“Let’s sit with this a while.” Kavika’s accent was beautiful. The way she said
Malfoy made a face of disgust. “I just didn’t actually think . . .” Malfoy made a frittering gesture with his hand. “You don’t have to really follow the law, do you?”
“What’s Tailored Tinctures?” Harry asked.
. “What do you hear?”
This was how the evening found him at the Higgledy Piggledy once more, wedged between Fairchild and Mark on one side and Teddy and Nyala on the other. Achar and Adebayo sat across, as well as Adebayo’s girlfriend, and Malfoy sat at the end with Rune Photsi, who was apparently still his boyfriend. Then two more older Aurors joined them, old enough that Harry knew them from working with them, rather than having taught them. “Where’s Astoria?” Mark wanted to know.
“Trying hard doesn’t make someone good-looking,” said Yin. “Unless you’re into that.”
“It’s been mentioned,” Teddy said, with a small ironic twist of his lips, but he adjusted his stance.
Another silence. Some of the reporters actually rocked back on their heels, stunned.
“Er.”  Harry pushed up his glasses.  “My first name is Harry.”
The image in the IC:WUT/UC turned to show the doorframe, then stopped. Malfoy must be leaning against the frame. “How are the folks back home?” he murmured.
“Well,” Draco said.  “I’m not sure I like her—ow!”  Heloise gently closed her beak on the shell of his ear.
“Mother says I need to try to be more gracious.  And Father thinks I’m too . . . disagreeable.  He says you have to be agreeable, so—so other people agree with you.”
“I’m not talking about that kind of honest.  I’m talking about the way you are to people.  The way you were to me.  Back then.”  Draco’s gaze dropped again.
“Nothing about this joke of a man is funny,” said Savage. “He should have gone to Azkaban!”
“Draco!” Harry called out.
Lionel Greengrass had found Malfoy as well and was grabbing him by the arm.
Malfoy frowned.  “Pardon?”
Teddy looked out after Vinicius. “I didn’t mean to trick him.”
Harry expected Draco to still be smirking or to make some kind of snide comment, but he was just standing there, looking oddly blank.
“Harry.” Kavika gave him one of the smiles she gave when she was going to say something he wouldn’t like. “People like that
Usually they went to the lab for a bit after that, Draco setting out more things to simmer, soak, or dry overnight and mixing things together so they could blend the proper amount of time.  Once he had to proof something, and another time some sea cucumbers had to go into a box to chill.  He said that with the five ingredients they had already found, he thought he understood the original potion that had de-aged Harry, except for one ingredient.  If they could find that one ingredient, Draco thought he could make a cure, but he also said it was that one ingredient that had made the original potion so powerful.  It had to be something special and unusual—and maybe illegal—or else Draco would have figured out what it was already.  Sometimes he wrote in a ledger, saying he was keeping track of what he was doing.
Maybe Harry could Floo him and ask him where he got his mini quiches. Was that the sort of thing that he could do, now? To someone who had called Hermione what he had, to someone who had tried to kill Dumbledore, to someone who had laughed when Cedric died? Yes. Harry supposed he could. A question about mini quiches was the least Harry could do, after Nyala’s Boggart, though now that Harry thought about it, a question about mini quiches wasn’t really thank you. Had he said thank you? Was saying thank you to Malfoy something he could do?
“Was it your father?” Harry said, because he couldn’t seem to stop himself.  “Was he the one who called you those things?”
Harry wanted to ask, but he’d shoved basically a whole scone in his mouth, so he slowed down.
Finding a small, hidden space in a cabinet between two potion bottles, Harry set up a Seeing-eye Ball, which would allow him to see anything going in the lab remotely.  Next, he used the sickle in his pocket to make a Portkey linked to the location, knowing he would have to come back.
“What do you mean?”
“You have no idea what it’s like to not have enough,” Malfoy said.  “Do you.”
“Pansy!”  Draco was still running around.  “Where are you?  Where are your parents?  Where are your house-elves?”
“Draco,” Harry said.  Magic was racing through him, pricking behind his eyes again.
“But I can.”
24 years
“But I promise,” Harry begged.  “I wouldn’t bother you.”
“Alby had no right to sack you,” Harry said.
“Yes.”  Turning back to the shelf, Harry put the book away.  “I suppose you do.”  He started down the stairs.
“First names are much nicer; don’t you think?
“She worried she had damaged him.  Psychologically.  That her obsession had made it so that he couldn’t get on without her.”  Andromeda’s voice was flat.  “That was why she did it.”
Harry went tense, but Mister Malfoy didn’t sound angry.  Confused, Harry stayed like he was—arms protecting his face, just in case.
to know, Harry specifically? Did it mean that—
“Right. I don’t see how that will help him pass.”
“That goes for you, too, Weasley,” Robards hissed.
Kavika.
“You weren’t an arse,” Hermione told him. They were having tea in her sitting room; the kids were in bed, and Ron was out late on a case. “Some people just don’t work for us. We need to find the ones that do.”
Harry wondered why he hadn’t been able see when they were both in fifth year how vulnerable Draco had been, but Harry already knew the reason.  Harry had been vulnerable himself, more vulnerable than Draco ever had been, but in a completely different way.  When you were sixteen it was hard to know people other than yourself.  It was hard at thirty-one as well, but some things were easier.  Some things were so much easier.  “I like you,” Harry said.
“Don’t you?”
“Why are you always saying someone
“How?”
“I’m not done yet!” came the strangled voice inside.
, Luna had told him once.
“No,” Harry said.
“I’m a complete mystery,” Draco said happily.  “I’m . . .
“No.”
“Oh,” Harry said again, his loose arse jerking against the pillow as his cock filled up. “Oh,” he said, as Draco filled it up more. Then Draco was tightening the seminal vesicles inside Harry again, which somehow made Harry’s whole body focus on the unnatural looseness of his arse; he needed his arse tight in the same way as the rest of him. He needed it full, and he felt himself grinding down into the pillow to get pressure on it, to get some kind of tension in it, his cock and his balls tighter and tighter while his arse was just—needy. “Please,” Harry panted, grinding his arse down into the pillow. “Please, get—get in me, put something in me.”
Harry surrendered to it, his legs falling open wider to allow his cock to obey, his balls to respond. He reveled in the surrender, focusing on the cock-filling, the warm helpless heat of his body readying for sex it wasn’t ready for. He heard himself moan, thrusting up toward the ceiling again, turned on just by the sensation of being turned on. “Oh yeah,” he breathed, ragged. “Yeah, get me—get me hard.”
“Oh God.” Harry felt like he was gasping, but Ron had witnessed something like this before, and just held him, and held him. Harry wished he could bury his face against Ron’s neck and never look at the rest of the world again; he wished he could look at Teddy forever; he wished Hermione was there.
“My mum said it would make me feel better regardless,” Mister Malfoy said, his tone firm.
They went out of Harry’s office, down the hall, then down the stone carpeted stair, through the main chamber and out a side door, into the cloisters, then onto the green. The day was sunny, the Timothy Tree the bright green colour of spring leaves. Harry could hear birds chirping in it as sun streamed through its leaves. Malfoy was right—Harry didn’t know what kind of tree the Timothy Tree. It wasn’t an elm or oak or maple or any other kind of tree he knew. It was just—the Timothy Tree.
“Those are friends of yours.  From Hogwarts.”
“I’ve moved on!” Harry felt as though he was going to combust out of his skin. “You were the ones that mentioned Hogwarts!”
“It’s fine.” It was really fine, and Harry felt more relaxed than he had all evening. This was probably why he kept talking, as though Malfoy were some kind of friendly acquaintance. Maybe he was, by now. “So, you and Astoria are . . . friends?”
Harry leaned into the microphone of the
Mister Malfoy strode over toward the hearth.
Draco stroked more blood into Harry’s cock, thickening it sculpting it. “You want what inside you?” he asked, his voice calm, measured.
Harry supposed that if you were a teenage boy, a tall gay man being extremely competent with his body might be appealing somehow. Fleur had said that Malfoy was well-made. Harry turned to look at Malfoy as well.
“I’m talking about the way you—”
“Okay,” Harry said.
“I’ll do my best, but as you’ve probably gathered by now, I am a novice when it comes to children.”
Harry’s mouth shut with a little click.  Malfoy had called him Harry again.  His voice had been so gentle, and Harry realized he had liked it.  He wanted Malfoy to be like this with him—to be tender, to call him Harry.  It was the powder.
“You think I’m a freak,” Harry said.
“Or like bring their daughters to exclusive Ministry parties. No, wait. Look.” Ron nodded over toward the Greengrass daughter. Kavika had moved away, and—Draco Malfoy took the young woman’s arm. The holiday party was fancy dress, and Malfoy had on a cream-coloured thing that made him look like a fairy tale prince, except for the face.
Harry didn’t care.  He didn’t care about what Andromeda said, about Voldemort, about Death Eaters, about being a hero.  He didn’t care about things Draco had supposedly done, because Harry hadn’t been there.  He didn’t remember any of that.  What Harry remembered was Draco making hot chocolate and cake and teaching him flying and Exploding Snap and sleeping in bunk beds and Draco touching his hair.  Harry didn’t care about other people loving him; he only cared about one thing.  “You
“Sweat,” Malfoy said, and then his cheeks went pink. He darted a guilty glance at Harry, then looked away. Wetting his lips, he closed his eyes. His brow knit as he began to speak again. “Grease—from the pub, lager. Petrol, from the—automobiles. Leaves. Autumnal decay.”
“You sacked him because he helped me,” Harry said, “and you weren’t getting paid under the table by Aurors anymore.”
“Yeah,” said Yin, exactly as though they had known this and had just been waiting for him to say it. “So the question is, do you want him emotionally?”
“Obviously.” Malfoy didn’t lower his wand, but Harry realized none of the spells Malfoy had cast had actually been harmful, and Death Eaters weren’t following him after all.
Kavika pressed her lips together, her steady mouth, her steady eyes, her steady smile. “And you don’t think that uncertainty could ever cause anxiety?”
“Yes, Harry?”
“We could sic the Rita Skeeter-lites on Malfoy, if you want us to,” Hermione said. “At least he deserves the trolling.”
Everybody knew that Savage and Proudfoot were the Aurors who got things done.  No one knew quite how they did it, other than that they’d worked in the Department for decades and knew basically everything: where to look for suspects, who to ask for favours, when to file paperwork and whether to forgo paperwork in favour of alternative methods.  After Harry’s first visit to Slug and Jiggers, Savage and Proudfoot knew who to go to for potions consulting—Harry Potter, because he had an in with Draco Malfoy.
Malfoy appeared to be taking a survey of the territory.  “I see you’ve removed Great Aunt Walburga.”
“I . . .”  Harry coughed.  “I never read that series.”
“Don’t worry, love,” Ron said, reaching out to squeeze her shoulder. “2016 will be our year.”
“I can say whatever I please—nothing matters!  Everything is ruined.  My life is a disaster!”  Draco took a heaving breath.  Then another.  And another.  “Where are my mum and dad?” he said, in a completely different tone—high pitched, but so quiet.  “Do they—”  His voice broke.  “Do they even speak to me?”
They each put down cards, but neither of them was snap cards so they kept going.  When Draco played a snap card he said, “You would like a wife in the future, I suppose.”  Possibly he was asking to be distracting, since if there was a double-snap you could say “Snap,” and when the cards exploded, you got to keep them.
“It’s not me!” the figure said in reply, so panicked and desperate to be believed that Harry thought they must be telling the truth.
Harry hissed in a breath.
“That doesn’t matter,” Malfoy said, hastily turning back to his rock tower and knocking it over with a clatter.  “He’s probably old and boring at this point anyway.  Not like us.  I bet we’re very interesting.”
Ron’s face looked like it did whenever Hermione went to face a political challenge, and he didn’t like the odds. “I could come with you.”
“A year at a time, right?”
“It’s not your fault.” Harry gave her half a smile.
“Draco,” Harry said.
During the trials, magical investigators had found that evil magic still lingered around Malfoy Manor, and the manor had been destroyed as a result.  Narcissa had been released five years ago—almost a year before the first time Harry had seen Malfoy at Slug and Jiggers.  As far as Harry knew, she’d been in the Janus Thickey Ward ever since.
“Compared to you?” Angelina took a sip of water. “As a fiddle.”
“Yeah,” Draco grunted. “You’ve got a hot fucking cunt, Harry.” Then Draco slammed into him, jolting a place inside of Harry that was like a button directly wired to his cock, forcing orgasm out of Harry like a punch to the gut. Harry lost his mind, but Draco still just kept fucking him, fucking him as Harry went wild on Draco’s cock, spraying come in the air, on his chest. Draco just slid a hand under Harry’s thigh, hiked it up, opened Harry’s legs wider, and nailed him. Draco was really nailing him, like some kind of machine, harder and faster than Harry had been fucked before, Draco saying, “Good, you’re so good, coming like that, getting that big dick doing what I want, what I want, such a tight cunt, Harry, you’re such—” Draco thrust in hard, “a—” another thrust, “tight—” again, “cunt—”
“In an uncontrolled situation,” Parkinson was saying, “one Dementor might feast upon this unappetizing meal.” He gestured at the non-mag man. “The others, however, would see a crowded room of powerful, pure wizards, and see more souls to be taken. You’ll note in this experiment, however, that all three Dementors only evince interest in the Muggle. Not unless we go between the Dementor and its prey will the dark spirit even notice us.”
Hermione turned back to Harry. “Anything come out of it you want to talk about?”
“I’m not pretending,” Harry said.
“Not all Old Bloods welcome blood purism!” Carrow shouted. “Percival Weasley—”
“After a fashion.”
But criminal or not, Malfoy kept muttering about having to put the potions on the shelves in order, when they were already in order alphabetically.
“All right,” Harry said, his throat feeling thick.
“He deserved to die.”  Andromeda put her cup down.  “Do you know how many innocent people Voldemort and his Death Eaters slaughtered?  We can pretend to be nice and claim that there are two sides to everything, that everyone deserves mercy and forgiveness, or we can face the reality that sometimes it’s necessary to make tough choices to bring about a better world.”
“You’re right,” Kavika said. “You wouldn’t have listened to any of it, at seventeen.”
Harry backed up another step and another, until he was up against the wall.
If Harry hadn’t been losing his mind, he might have thought about how much Draco hated Harry after first year and decided how he would handle it.  Harry hadn’t forgot it, but he hadn’t let himself think about it.  Maybe a part of him had even hoped it wouldn’t happen, but it had to.  It had to, if he was going to get his Draco back.  “Yes,” Harry said.
“Yes,” Mister Malfoy said, but he was humouring him now.  Harry could tell.  “Up there with Heloise?”
Greengrass tried to reply, but Savage yelled and Fudge yipped and Spragg began to move forward and Ron moved to intercede and more people were there and the chandelier overhead jerked on its ancient chains. Christ, it was going to fall on them. It was going to fall on them and they were all going to die.
“Oh, yes you are.  Do you want to know why?”
Draco didn’t say anything else after that, even though Harry waited.  He could hear Draco’s heart beating here, a steady thump.  Then Draco put his hand in Harry’s hair.
