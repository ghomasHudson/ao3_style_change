“You’ve got some flour in your hair,” Harry says later, as they’re lying tucked up against each other. Draco braces his arm on the wall beside him so he doesn’t fall off the bed, and turns in Harry’s arms.
“No one’s heard from you in over two weeks,” someone else says. He squints around the arm he threw over his eyes and sees Dean. “No one’s had even an owl from you. Your mum Flooed me at the gallery.”
“In,” Potter barks, and then, more softly, “Come in, please.”
“Will you just concentrate on finishing up that statement? I’d like to close this file and go take a long, incredibly hot shower and forget all about this day.” Malfoy rubbed his hand through the dirt, smearing it farther instead of getting rid of it, and Harry smirked.
He changes out of his work robes at home, and it feels so right to hang them back in the wardrobe. To know that, soon, he won’t be taking them out again. He’ll just be Harry, in his jeans and sweaters; just a dad and a friend and, maybe, a lover. His pulse jumps and races, just ahead of him, when he thinks about Draco.
The bar is a dive, dirty and overcrowded, but it was only two blocks from his flat and it stocks Firewhisky. He sits at the bar, and the glasses pile up beside him.
“How is Pansy?” Draco asks.
The room is very quiet, and Draco closes his eyes for a brief moment as the shoe drops. “Me,” he says. He opens his eyes, and sees Weasley’s head swivel his direction. “You know me.”
Draco looks at the canvas Dean is working on. It’s a large one today, washed in deep browns and soft golds. “Painting going well?”
“Oh,” says Potter. “Er… What’s a suitably pureblood kind of surname that isn’t going to make people think too hard about extended family members?”
What he says is: "Me too." And then he ignores the funny look Malfoy gives him and takes his hand, and he threads their fingers together. He pulls Malfoy in to their little knot of people who make life, for all its pain and rage and darkness, worth the effort.
The street is nearly empty until he gets close to the shops near the park, where people are coming out from the coffee shop with their lattes and paper bags filled with pastries. He heads for the little grocer first, and looks over their tea selection. There’s a nice Assam blend, so he puts it in the little basket he picked up by the door, along with milk and a jar of honey.
“Thank you.” He follows where she’d pointed, and finds a wooden door, painted sky blue and the top half open, and inside a big, old farm kitchen with a hearth burning and pots bubbling on a old iron stove against another wall.
? Isn’t that funny, Potter? Isn’t that just
“Don’t deserve it,” Draco finishes. He smiles at her, small, gentle. So she doesn’t think he’s mocking her. “You’re right, of course. They don’t. But— well, I just know that for some of us, this genuine enthusiasm about the things Muggles create, it’s led to real enthusiasm about Muggles themselves, and— I don’t know. I can’t think
She falls silent. Draco can hear the ticking of the clock on the mantle and the dull roar of the sea in the distance, the way it flings itself again and again onto the rock-crusted shoreline. The way it breaks and flows backward, only to dash itself again, and again.
The chair creaks under him now, rather threateningly. He wonders if she charmed it to do that.
“Could we speak in private?”
Lucius glances up from a book laid out on his desk. There is silver at his temples now, mingling in with the pale blonde. “Draco. To what do we owe this unexpected honor?”
“You know,” Blaise says finally, “I think she was just like anyone else. Muggle, wizard. I don’t think it matters. She thought it was worth not being careful.” He doesn’t look at Draco, but he doesn’t need to. “She was right, of course. You can tell.”
Harry meets Hermione at coffee shops and cafés near the Ministry on her lunch breaks. Usually they drink tea because Hermione is always busy with some new piece of legislation or some kind of study, but sometimes Harry convinces her to go the pub with him. After a few pints, he says:
“That’s a Death Eater,” says Potter, idly. He pushes the bridge of his glasses further up his nose with the end of his wand. Draco hopes he singes off the front of his hair doing that someday.
“Coming?” Blaise calls instead, and Draco goes.
“Loads,” Malfoy agreed.
Harry was really quite drunk, and tired as well. He couldn’t think of any argument against this Malfoy staying. There was something fitting about it. There was something familiar and even mildly comforting about the thought of being haunted. Like being lost and then found.
Draco turns away. The window frames his view of the estate, a series of snapshots in his memory of the castle—his home—in rain and sunshine, in cold, clinging snow and summer’s effusive golden light. “Now it’s a habit and I’m the only one who would have me break it.”
Draco waited, but Snape’s portrait just stared back, watchful and quiet. “But?” Draco finally whispered.
“Malfoy,” he said suddenly. The blonde head across the room turned. “You haven’t eaten yet, have you?”
“This one does,” he insists. “It’s the same ghost. I can just— tell.”
“Are you accusing me of something?” asks Evers, as he starts walking away, down toward the water.
Harry’s expression changes. “Hey,” he says. “It’s alright, you know.”
"With all due respect, Fergus, what are you implying?" Kingsley says, and Harry focuses on what's being said again.
. He wanted Malfoy.
“Yes. James is about to graduate, though, and then he’s off to Romania to learn about dragons with his uncle. It doesn’t seem possible. My Albus talks about Scorpius nonstop, actually. He’s a wonderful boy, your grandson.”
By the time summer was ending, it was over. Malfoy’s engagement hit the papers, and the wedding was planned out.
“It’s Potter.
me. And then it was too late.” She shakes her head. “Well, that’s the story of my life, I suppose.”
“It’s almost like you didn’t have her as a professor for seven years,” Potter says, looking at him strangely. “Why do you want to see Snape?”
“Are you alright?” Harry asks. “Is this ok?”
“Yes,” Draco finds himself saying. “Yes, alright.”
The other Aurors are drifting back toward them now, but Potter is still smiling at him over the corpse he just made, and he can see how the rest of this day will go like it’s a movie being projected on the back wall of the inside of his head. The debriefing, the witness statements, the wand checks, Minister Shacklebolt’s statement to the press out in the bullpen. Potter watching him all the while.
“Oh, turn around,” Draco says impatiently, and he points his wand at Potter’s hair. Potter freezes, just for a second, and then deliberately relaxes his body. Draco pretends not to have noticed, and murmurs a spell. Potter’s hair goes limp and shiny, and then arranges itself into a parted style swept back from his forehead.
“He’s still got the daughter, too.”
How their jagged edges align. How the fit is ever-turning, unlocking deeper and deeper into each other.
Harry could hear his own blood rushing through his eardrums, but it wasn’t anger fueling the dizzy rush anymore. It was something else. Maybe—
“Didn’t know we had any of those left.”
Draco can only shrug and nod, and Potter looks around them again before shoving both the parchment and pen back at him. “Sorry, I really do have to go.”
“That so are you. If I’m more than my best deed, you’re certainly more than your worst.”
“What do you mean? More than the one dragon?”
Draco sighs. “Yes. The one you’re selling is very rare. I am of course willing to pay the appropriate price for such a valuable piece.”
It was strange, how far away the rest of the world felt, even though they were hardly hidden, in a dim alley in the middle of London. Harry tried to care that someone might walk by and see them. Might catch them, he and Draco Malfoy, two notorious wizards with their cocks out, kissing now like it was the only way to breathe, to stay alive. He tried to care and couldn’t. This was too damn
“Dead?” Hermione asked incredulously. “Of course not. As if I’d neglect to mention something like that. Anyway, that would be front page in the papers, not Ministry gossip.”
“What about casualties?”
“The seller,” says Greg. He turns the parchment around so that Draco can read it. “H. Potter.”
“Check!” Ron crowed, and Harry groaned as the pieces on his board were either violently vanquished or began a raucous celebration.
“Speaking of, I told Daphne I would take her by my stylist tomorrow evening. You can amuse yourself for dinner, can’t you?”
Draco flips the Prophet closed again, and folds it up. “I’ll go back tomorrow and interview Tom Evers. Maybe more of the sanctuary workers. Who knows? Might turn something up.”
“What? What do you mean by that?” He turns to face her, his knees knocking into hers.
— smiling encouragingly at the old bird. “What on earth do you mean, Pansy?”
When he rolls over to face him, Potter’s eyes are already open. There’s just enough daylight to make out their color, and he smiles at Draco.
“See?” Draco turns back toward Pansy.
Potter raises an eyebrow, and his lips almost look like they’re turning up into a smile. “The fabled courtesy of the upperclass does not disappoint.”
“Someone… unexpected.”
“What about the Wizengamot were they so angry about?” asks Potter.
was that?” He turns to see Potter striding into the room, looking livid. His eyes scan the cuts, the blood soaked into Draco’s shirt. “Look at yourself. Why would you do that?”
Blaise has all kinds. Old black and whites, and some older still, faded yellow and crumbling along the edges. Newer photos in colour, large photos and very small ones of schoolchildren looking at the camera with stiff smiles. Some are portraits and some are just random, everyday moments frozen into a single second of frame. It’s those ones—the ones with a person turned away, looking in the distance, or someone stuck in the air mid-jump, or a single chaotic moment at a birthday party— that still make Draco uncomfortable, although he can’t quite pinpoint why. Their stillness is strangely upsetting.
“Alright,” Draco says. Anything to prolong the visit a little longer.
“Oh?” He takes a sip of the tea. It’s a little weak, like it’s on its second steep. “How did you get ahold of it, anyway?”
“He’s at the lighthouse,” Carys says after a long silence. She doesn’t look up. “He never leaves the lighthouse after sunset.”
Pansy is already in place out in the courtyard and he slips in beside her, Regulus to his right. She gives him a measured look and squeezes his hand. Surprised and grateful, he squeezes back, and then they straighten and wait for the prince and his men to enter.
The portraits come to life as he walks through, as only magical paintings left long neglected and bored do— smiling, waving, turning to show off their best angles. The opera star begins an aria, one delicate hand lying across her low-cut bodice. He waves at them, then takes the staircase at the back of the house. The door to Blaise’s bedroom is ajar. Draco peeks in; the bed is unmade but empty, so he continues down the hall to the study.
“How did your father die? Was it sudden, too?”
“For my life without
Harry had just poured hot water in the teapot when he heard the knock at the door. He put the lid on and went to answer it.
He doesn’t notice the manilla envelope on the front stoop until Draco leaves Sunday afternoon, with lazy coffee kisses and vague plans to see each other for lunch on Monday.
“Come on Monday, in time for dinner. I’ll owl you the Floo address.” She looks at Potter now, and winks. “Bring your… partner.”
“And their magic?”
Lucius waves a hand. “You needn’t report to the capital until the new year.”
“It’s not—“ Draco swallows, and straightens the buttons down the front of his own uniform. If he took it off, would he be more like Draco, or less?
“Because a dragon has been found intentionally mutilated this morning, and the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures is taking this very seriously.”
He shrugs. “Just if you’ve noticed anything out of the ordinary lately.”
“There’s some Hack-It-Off in the department cabinet,” he said. His voice sounded gruffer than he meant it to. “And Pepper-Up.”
“Don’t you? There’s a peculiar smell in the storage room downstairs. Like rotting fruit. You should have a care— I’m told that stuff is very flammable.”
“What else would I do?” He’s genuinely baffled.
“I don’t—I’m not—”
“I know you have reason— good reasons— to hold hard feelings against Pansy. But she’s not the girl she was at Hogwarts, anymore, and— look, she’s just trying to get by these days, in this stupid world her parents still inhabit and I would appreciate it if you could find it in yourself to be— nice to her. While you’re here.”
“Shut up, Ron.”
“Shit.” Draco takes a long draw from his glass. “I didn’t think about where you were going to sleep.”
“I’m trying to assess the likelihood of you harming the Rheeses,” says Draco, falling into step just behind him.
“We’ve run lean before.”
Harry smiled. He felt slow and heavy. Lazy. “You wish, Malfoy. It was good, though, yeah? It was…right.”
January 24th — Tuesday
“Isn’t that the same thing?”
The young dragon’s head becomes visible as he comes up to the door of the building, He  stops, turning his head left and right and back and forth again, peering out at the outside world. He seems wary, unsure. Finally he stretches his neck and his head comes out into the sunlight. The dragon closes its eyes. It looks like he’s relishing the bit of warmth, like a cat.  After another long moment, he stalks out into the pen. His wings are covered with thick, splinted bandages and there’s a strong herbal smell from the salves.
“The non-elected ones,” Draco adds.
“Malfoy.” He nods, and smiles. “You’re the rose man?”
“I shouldn’t have made that comment about the hunting,” Draco says now, his voice quiet, too. “If I’d gone with them this morning I’d have more opportunity to watch him.”
Draco sets the cosy back over the teapot. “And use this to keep the pot warm.”
“I hope that’s not a problem. You’re listed as the seller. Should I contact your aunt instead?”
“Hippogriffs. Cassius has a whole stable of them. It’s really caught on over in France, you know. I was skeptical at first, but it really is such fun— I try and go out every day. I’m organizing a trip down the beach in a few hours, actually. You should join us.”
. When Draco’s fingers brushed against his at the kitchen sink, or when he’d wiped at a bit of soil on Draco’s sleeve, and Draco had turned his head just so, his eyes on Harry’s lips and his pupils blowing wide.
Or maybe they’d just Apparate to Grimmauld Place, Harry’s fingers laced with his, his nose against the delicious skin where Harry’s neck met his shoulder. And then there’d be just the two of them, and no one else. Just Harry and Draco and this new thing he was allowed, despite everything.
Draco looks quickly away. They are careful, he and Potter— very careful— to move in polite circles around each other.
The spoon refused to move, no matter how Malfoy prodded at it. “I’m alive,” he said finally. “The boredom is the worst part. You get so tired of yourself. And I just don’t see the point of it. I’m not saying I did nothing wrong,” Malfoy went on hastily. “It’s just—what good is me sitting in that cell doing? How am I rectifying anything there?”
real.
Draco stares at the baskets. Is Harry asking to live here? Can Draco refuse such an offer, even for his pride? Even for his heart?
"Potter." Snape stares back at him for a long moment. Harry wonders if Eileen Prince had ordered the portrait done so she could keep it near her. He wonders how long it had lain in Spinner's End gathering dust and silence.
“That’s fine,” says Draco.
Another ghost of a smile. “I really don’t see the appeal of this obsession, Draco.”
“I’m pretty sure I could talk to Wizarding Resources about this abuse. You being my boss, technically.”
“Thanks,” said Harry. “Is it the joggers? Or the pallor of constant boredom affecting my skin?”
that Malfoy could be, when he forgot that anyone was watching him. He seemed to actually like the older Aurors he was partnered with, in a quiet, reserved way. In fact, almost everything about Malfoy was reserved these days. Gone was the pointy, dramatic boy who basked and courted attention, replaced with a pointy, prickly man who seemed actively wary of it.
“Oh Harry,” she says, her eyes lighting up with barely contained mirth and shining in a way he hasn't seen in a long time when it was just the two of them. “Surely, considering
There’s a stoop, made of stone and looking out on a little patch of overgrown garden between the row of houses Potter’s home is part of, and another directly behind them. He sits down beside Potter, who lights up a cigarette. The tobacco is from one of the wizard places in Diagon— he recognises the scent of vanilla and clove of that particular blend.
“I do.”
. “If you don’t ask them to.”
He shakes his head. “I just saw it. It was just there.”
“Professor,” he’d said, drawing near. It hung on the wall right beside Dumbledore, who looked at him and then pretended to be engrossed in a book.
“Good afternoon, dear. Dreadful afternoon, isn’t it? Can I interest you in— Oh.”
“Inevitable, I should think.” Lucius takes a long sip of his wine. “It’s been building for ages—this borderland has always been contested, and Salazar and Godric view the forest as dangerous ground for thieves and surprise invasions. Now that Godric’s convinced Slytherin has something to do with the prince’s disappearance, I expect we’ll be at war by the new year.”
“Think about what?”
For a moment, he and Malfoy simply smiled at each other, then Harry sobered. “I thought you were a ghost,” he told Malfoy. “And you’d come because—because I didn’t get you out. I could’ve done more. I
“It was sudden, yes. We don’t really know what the cause was.”
Draco shrugs. “A word with my mother. Getting in isn’t the problem. Being trusted with information is the real issue.”
Malfoy’s mouth at the spot where his shoulder and neck met made him arch up, and Malfoy groaned above him, his hips pushing into Harry’s, pushing them both into the mattress.
we calling it these days, then? You’ll look ever so fashionable when you do it as a prince, I’m sure.”
“I see,” Draco says. “I’m beginning to have that same niggling feeling you described yesterday.”
“Merlin, Malfoy.” Draco slides his lips up further, watching Potter all the while. He loves how every inch feels sliding through his lips and into his mouth; loves how every bit sends Potter further over the edge. “Just like that— oh— oh, don’t stop. You’re so good, so—“ Potter’s eyes close as Draco reaches up and grasps him with one hand as he pulls back with his mouth, sucking lightly as he goes.
She sets it on the table. “I laundered it, and sealed it up,” she says. “It works, too, if that’s a factor. I’ve had it longer than the boys have been alive, you know.”
Weasley nudges her with his elbow, and she falls silent, glancing at Draco.
“There you are,” says Potter. “I think Ron and Hermione secretly didn’t believe me when I told them you were coming for dinner.” The look on his face must communicate at least some portion of his sudden misapprehension and dread, because Potter lets out a little laugh, his smile big and real. Draco realises he’s never seen one of Potter’s real smiles directed at him, and the thought brings a flush of warmth to his face.
“I know,” Draco says, but it’s only an empty room that hears him.
The sounds fade quickly as he makes his way down the hall; there must be a Muffling Charm built into it. He knocks on the giant, carved mahogany door, and one of the birds entwined in the branches of a large tree twists to life from the relief, flapping its wings and looking down at him. It opens its beak, and says, “Come in, Mr. Malfoy," and the door swings open.
"We just brought in a Death Eater last week," Harry interrupts. "You must be joking."
“I don’t know what you mean.” Malfoy’s face had gone blank and still.
“And there,” he said against the skin under Harry’s left ear. “Right there, Potter.” His teeth bit gently and his tongue smoothed it over again.
“Remember what?”
The truth was, at twenty-one years old Harry didn’t
Draco stands, too, and follows Blaise to the doorway.
“I’m sorry, Harry,” says Draco, and he walks over to the stove to turn off the burner. He pulls the kettle off and to the side, and when he turns back again Potter is right there. Right behind, right in reach. He leans into him. Harry smells like lemon soap and milky tea. He smells like home.
Draco’s voice was rough. “I was asking the same question, in lots of different ways.”
Spots of pink are blooming on his cheeks as he’s pressed harder into the glass. The man slides his hand from the back of Harry’s neck to the front, long pale fingers stroking, squeezing, forcing his head up as he pounds into him from behind. Deeper. Faster. And the rougher it gets, the more force is exerted upon him, the more relaxed the mirror Harry becomes. Lines seem to smooth out on his face. His lips curve, and the lines of his body change from his shoulders all the way to his feet. He
“You might have something there,” she interrupts, leaning forward again. She pulls out a copy of the Prophet and pushes it across the table toward him. It’s from this morning; he’d vaguely noted the front page photo of a smiling Cormac McLaggen as he walked past a newsstand on the way to work. He looks at the headline now—
“Yeah,” he said simply. “He is.”
“He’s good at it,” says Harry. “At fixing things.”
He waited, but Malfoy just kept sliding along the edge, just coasting and skating across the last boundary they’d left uncrossed. Harry lifted his hips, pressed back into Malfoy’s.
Granger nods, but she’s staring down at her parchment as if it might speak, and give her answers.
Spells:
When Malfoy looks up at him, his eyelids are heavy. Harry can see a set of dark indentations in Malfoy's bottom lip, marks left by his teeth into the soft pink skin.
“You think they want it to look like someone is attacking their history?”
It was hard to say, but Draco Malfoy is standing on his front stoop, pale and pointed and buttoned up in black trousers and a grey waistcoat. He blinks into the darkness of Harry’s front hall, squinting just a bit in the bright sunshine, and Harry can feel the past so sharply it’s like a kick in the ribs.
“Come on, let’s check out the back garden.”
“I can’t say as I blame him,” Draco says. “On either count.”
Harry breathed into his blankets, and waited, but that was all he said. And Harry understood. This— whatever
“Sunday,” Potter says again. “Dinner time?”
. “Keep your ears open. That’s the best thing you can do for me tonight. I’m going to have to talk their damn ears off as punishment for not mingling among them in so long. I need your ear.”
“My question,” continues Potter, and now he starts to examine the fingernails of his wand hand, as if there’s some dirt stuck under there, “is if you’re nearly done having your fit, or if we all have to keep standing around here. I’d hate to be late for dinner again.”
“Just the right amount,” he says slowly, and she wrinkles her nose.
“Eloquent, Potter,” he’d said, but there had been a part of him, something hard and frozen since the war, that had cracked, and he’d lifted his head off the mattress and pressed his mouth to Potter’s. Warm lips, slick tongues, Potter’s stubble rubbing against his chin.
Potter’s mouth had opened under his, slick and pink and fuckable, and it tasted like hunger. It tasted like a dare. Like flying too fast and too high, too late at night.
“Fuck. Potter.” His eyes were open again, and his mouth too, his bottom lip falling open in a soft O. Harry pulled back, sucking gently, then took him into his mouth again, Further, more. Every slide in and out again felt easier and better and Malfoy’s gasps made him want to find a better angle, the perfect pressure to undo him completely.
Potter stops, so Draco does too, and turns to see his face. He doesn’t look angry, or uncomfortable. He’s looking at Draco with that same expression that confused him at their last Sunday supper, but Draco thinks maybe he recognises it now. It’s as if Potter is looking right through Draco’s skin, into some part of him that he’s seeing for the first time, and he finds that part something special. Something magical, even.
Potter is wearing jeans and a red sweater with a giant ‘H’ knit in gold across the front. His hair is a mess, of course, and he hasn’t had a shave today. He looks surprised to see Draco, so he probably wasn’t aware that Granger had given his address out.
Tom Evers is sitting on an overturned crate when he gets to the top, looking away from him, out toward the darkness. Draco wonders if he wishes he could go back and make a different choice. If he feels locked into his current path, no matter how many doubts he has. He wonders if the pain and the rage have grown bigger than the love that started it all.
“Why?”
“I know,” Granger says, turning her nearly-empty glass of pumpkin juice around and around in her hand. “I know. I just—” She looks up at Draco. She looks so earnest, like if she said exactly the right words he would understand her completely. “The thing is, I don’t want to share with them. I don’t want them to see our movies, or use laptops, or hear our music from an iPod. I want to keep it just ours, because pure-bloods, they— well they—“
His own arm finds its way around Harry’s waist, a fist against his back. Draco can feel Harry’s muscles bunching up underneath his jacket as he presses in closer.
Potter smiles up at him. “And people say you don’t have a sense of humor.”
Malfoy’s fingers pressed into the dip of his lower back. “Yeah. You too, Potter. You and Weasley.”
"Please," he chokes out, his voice low, tangled, secret. Malfoy looks up, into his eyes. His mouth is so close to Harry's now.
Draco sighs. “I’m not sure where to begin, or what exactly we’d be looking for. I think our best bet is to mingle—“ he shudders. “And listen. There’s got to be some Traditional Wizarding Order members on this guest list.”
When the sun has made its way high up into the sky, he stops in at a coffeeshop and picks up two dark roasts and some doughnuts. His destination is in Hackney; a thin slice of a big building covering two floors. He knocks on the street level door, but when there’s no answer he heads down the small staircase to the basement one. It’s unlocked, and there’s a Muggle radio station playing inside, so he opens the door and walks inside.
“I’ll announce myself,” he says gently. The elf bows and disappears.
Draco has been hovering in the doorway, hesitant about joining in and a little shocked to be privy to their easy, casual way with each other, but Granger holds out a pitcher of what looks like pumpkin juice and a stack of glasses in his direction now. “Malfoy,” she says. He steps forward quickly and accepts them from her. When he looks over at Potter, he nods at the table, so Draco takes them over and sets them in the middle, where everyone can reach them.
“Won’t, or hasn’t?”
, Draco,” he says.
“And you think that’s what Malfoy is doing? Leaving his body in Azkaban and…going out?”
The ends of Potter’s mouth twitch up into a small smile. “Understatement,” he says. “Anyway, have a seat. I just got here myself, actually, so I picked up a pizza. Sorry, best I could do.” He slides a big, flat box onto the table, and nods at a seat.
“Draco—” Harry is panting, his fingers plucking at Draco’s trousers.
Potter had raised his eyebrows and laughed, the little chortle he did when he was really delighted by something, but put down his styrofoam container and turned over on the sofa. Draco stood over him, and their fingers brushed against each other as he took the small jar Potter handed back to him. It smelled like lavender and cloves and chamomile tea. It felt different, too, touching Potter like this; apart from sex and with no immediate intention to have it. With each pass of his fingertip over the red, angry lines in Potter’s skin something grew inside him— some mounting discomfort, a pressure rising up from his chest toward his mouth.
"Perhaps you'll do it," Snape says. "Maybe you will actually find them all."
When Granger leaves, she slips a folded piece of paper under the book he’s been reading.
“Queen to G4,” came Ron’s voice suddenly, and Harry shook himself back to the present. Behind him, he could hear one of the queens on the chess set scraping across the board.
skin. Had been there for awhile now.
“No.”
“No.” Draco pulls down a new bottle of Ogden’s and looks at Potter. “I suppose we haven’t. Firewhisky?”
It’s funny, the way time slows down in a duel. How your heartbeat gets so loud in your ears, and the breath coming in and out of your lungs feels more deliberate. More finite.
In the morning, Harry is sitting on the edge of the bed, fully dressed, when Draco opens his eyes. First light is just filtering in blue-gray shadows across the room. Harry looks back over his shoulder when Draco stirs, and smiles. His eyes are kind, so kind.
How to Disarm an opponent.
“That’s going to be difficult.” Potter leaned forward, his hands clasped on his knee. “How are we going to do that?”
Granger smiles. “You’re welcome. I, uh— I owled Pansy and we went out to some Muggle charity shops together. Did she tell you?”
“Ron.” Granger’s voice is gentle. “You can’t. Our house would be the first place they’d look.”
,” she insists. “You have a Thing. About love. Relationships alarm you.”
But right now there is touching, so much touching. With fingers curled like claws and lungs burning. Like he’s running for his life, like he’s drowning. He pushes his fingers into the gaps between the buttons of Potter’s shirt and tugs until Potter’s chest is bare to him. Potter’s belly, rising and falling in choppy waves. Potter’s shoulders, the puckered pink of the worst of the scarring running down and across his chest. He should have known then, when Potter got those scars. That night over Thai takeout in Potter’s flat, and that terrible, consuming fear as he touched the ruined skin that marked Potter’s vulnerability as plain as day. He
“But Harry, you’re doing so much good there, and there’s still so much more we can—“
“Draco,” Harry says. “You help me remember.”
“You don’t know? You can’t remember?”
The Italians all flinch at the name, and Draco smiles, slow and toothy like a shark.
“Finish your letter,” Harry says, and drops his hand.
As soon as the bedroom door closes behind them, Potter’s got his mouth all over Draco’s. It feels a little like he’s dreaming, and he runs his hands up and down, all over the man currently exploring his mouth with his tongue. He wants to feel every bit of Potter, he wants to taste every part of him. But there’s something not quite—
She rolled her eyes, but her lips twitched as she dropped down to kneel on the floor near Rose. “Well I’d rather Rosie not start running around talking about—“ She dropped her voice. “—knobs. I’m going to leave the explanations for all the naughty words she uses to you, Ron Weasley.”
“Sometimes, Potter,” Malfoy said with a little twist of his lips, “you manage to almost convince me you’re rather perceptive.”
… And then they do, and Harry is there always with his kind eyes and his quick smile.
around!” Malfoy roared back. “Is it so hard for you to fucking
And then Potter is gone, across the Atrium and into the lifts, and when Draco looks down at Potter’s scrawl, he sees that it’s an address.
Blaise is already up when Draco arrives this time; he’s standing in the middle of his kitchen, fixing himself a sandwich while Guido mutters and moves around, cleaning up after him.
He ignores the barb lying there, and says, “I came to speak with Mother, but I hear she’s engaged at the moment.”
At night in bed, when he aches and he wants but something stops him from calling out.
“A torturous inevitability?” For a moment Harry was sure he saw Malfoy’s pale mouth curve up on both ends, but perhaps it was a trick of the light.
“How to use a blade, I mean. Not the pretty stuff. The stuff that actually protects you.” Harry offers a small smile. “It’s better than just watching, anyway.”
Somewhere around the year mark of sleeping together, Potter caught a rare hex during a fight with a wizard he was trying to arrest. It was an ingenious little bit of dark magic, as slippery as it was strong. By the time the Healers at St. Mungo’s figured out what they were dealing with, and how to stop it, the curse had run in increasingly complex lines of damage under Potter’s skin, rupturing blood vessels and tearing through muscle and skin in intersecting lines all over his torso. A blood-red web of wreckage. The Healers repaired all the internal damage, across a tense three days, but the scarring along the outer layer of skin, particularly right across Potter’s chest, remained.
Harry is always watching.
“Did it help?” Potter asks. “Two years ago— speaking with Snape’s portrait? Did you get what you needed?”
Ron puts his fork down.
“This is horrifying,” Granger says, picking up another empty carton of takeout. “Do you two eat nothing nutritious?”
Monday mornings are very close to being universally hated at the Ministry, but Draco is hard pressed not to grin as he weaves around and between grumpy secretaries, office staff, and junior officials on his way to the lifts, glad as always to be the perverse exception. Mondays mean a new week, a new bottleneck of petty crime waiting from the weekend and the chance of something bigger, something darker to chase. He rubs a thumb against his index finger and watches the floor numbers light up as he climbs the great veins of the bureaucratic beast with a crowd of still-fuzzy peers.
“Draco, oh god—” Harry groans, and he runs his hands up and down Draco’s chest and shoulders. Harry looks like a dream beneath him, squirming and writhing on the floor, his lips swollen and his cock so fucking hard and leaking in Draco’s hands. “Draco, let me—can I touch you now, too? Can I—” Harry breaks off and his head rolls back as Draco presses just a little harder, takes a little extra time at the tip of Harry’s cock to smooth his thumb over the swollen skin there.
“Where is he from? Who are his people? He’s given no account of himself before he came here?”
They continue to stand and look at the bed. Draco wonders if they will perhaps stand here all night, neither willing to make the first move. But as usual, Potter proves to be the braver of them, and pulls back the blankets.
“What do you
“Is Father in his study?”
Harry treks over to the manager’s building to see if there’s a better cabin available. The man behind the desk is wearing his hair in a large bun on top of his head, and his beard is braided with tiny purple beads shaped liked stars.
“Hermione,” he said, “I saw him. I saw—I
They meet in front of the restaurant, a little Muggle place, because Harry is feeling rather sentimental. It’s a Friday night, and there’s a line at the door, so they linger near the end of it, their bodies close and so very aware of each other.
Over tea in the afternoon, when the cup’s hot porcelain burns his lips.
“An ex-Rookwood,” adds Draco. “Rookwood has ceased to be. Kicked the bucket.”
“I don’t know him very well,” Draco protests.
“How’s the case going, Hermione?” Dean asks from the kitchen, where he’s washing his brushes in empty jam jars.
“Malfoy,” says Potter, slow and quiet. “You’re drunk. Let’s just drop this. Get some sleep.”
Harry looks at the cabin, and decides then and there that he’s never going to trust the advertising for anything, ever again. He should have come and looked at the place first, he should have made the time to make sure it was right for—
Draco grits his teeth together, tries not to look as resentful as he feels. Potter waits.
“A wise decision,” Lucius allows, inclining his head toward the chair across from him.
Potter edges around him, and Draco turns to watch him lean over and peer out into the garden. He looks back at Draco, over his shoulder. “There’s nothing there, Malfoy.”
“Malfoy,” he says placidly, holding out a fresh cigarette. He lights it with the tip of his wand. “You here about the dragon attack?”
“I should go see her. I bet she misses her hippogriffs.”
“Anyway,” Harry continued, “since you don’t have plans, you can come to the Leaky and get a drink with me when this shift is over.”
things he wanted from Potter.
It feels weird, unlocking the door to his flat with Potter standing behind him. He’d just carved out this space for himself, this place where only he belonged. And now he has to bring Potter here, the boy who was his childhood nemesis, the man who is his— what?
Malfoy knocked back the rest of the whiskey in his glass. “Pansy ended up going to France. She couldn’t go anywhere here without people calling her—“ he trailed off. “Names.”
“Don’t go that way,” he says. “We’ll just get
. He thinks about a teenaged girl disappearing from all of her parents' photographs and the teenaged boy who loved her—who loved Harry, too—waiting and watching, stealing wands from Snatchers, anything to find his chance at getting back to them.
“Whoever is doing this has savaged a dragon,” whispers Granger. “A
They stood and looked at each other. Malfoy’s arms and legs looked longer than he remembered, all angles and graceful lines.
him?”
“But— I don’t understand,” he says, as the room begins to fade. “Why?”
Because Snape had, somehow, and Lucius had not. Draco still felt like an open question.
“I don’t know,” the ghost of Draco Malfoy said. He held his hands up in front of his face and looked at Harry through them. “But it turns out your hair is still a complete disaster, even when blurred out by ghost appendages.”
He eases forward, keeping to the shadows along the wall. A quick disillusion charm and he fits himself up against the balustrade. Warrington is standing on the landing just above, talking to someone Draco can’t quite see.
Draco. The worst of him, and now maybe the best.
He has a feeling Potter is experiencing the same contrariness. He’s been pacing around the flat’s main room for three quarters of an hour now, stopping periodically to slide the curtain on the window over a few inches and peer down into the street below.
Granger gives him a worried look. “Are you sure you’re ready?”
Draco’s heart swells. Hope is such a strange feeling—it feels like pleasure and pain all wrapped together. “Sounds like a marriage.”
Draco closes his eyes, just for a few heartbeats, and takes a deep breath. When he opens his eyes again, he steps away from the wall, right into Potter’s path.
“Wait until I shower,” Potter says. He comes to look out the window, down at the people gathering for a picnic on the beach below. Draco tries to do a headcount, but he can’t see very well from this angle. When Potter turns to say something, his face is suddenly right there, filling up his view. Draco watches his pupils blow wide, but the color is all wrong. Not that particular green that he sees sometimes in his dreams, staring down at him in fire or in bloodied water. Potter swallows, his throat moving slowly, and Draco realizes how close they are. He pulls back, and watches Potter tear his gaze away from Draco’s mouth.
“Right.” The word
“Yes.” Harry nodded. “Twice, actually.”
Draco smiles, and for just a moment forgets that his heart is breaking.
“It still looks like your hair— all cowlicks and shag, as if you’ve never seen a comb in your entire life.”
, Potter?”  A teacup sitting on the back shelving cracked, suddenly. “You don’t know me, not anymore. And not like you think you do.”
“No, thank you,” says Potter, in an overly courteous voice.
“Well, you won’t know until you try,” says Blaise.
“If you… need another home… you could come with me. If you want?” He felt like a tit, but then, softly, a deep, harmonious humming had begun inside the boxes. The sound grew and swelled, like many hundreds of voices singing out a single note on different scales. It was something he’d never heard before, and yet it felt so familiar, a golden and peaceful feeling spreading inside his bones.
“Alive,” Potter says. “
“I’d never given much thought to the way people without magic did things. Everyday things.” Draco glances over at Granger and Weasley. Granger is nodding and Weasley still looks strangely thoughtful. It’s better than looking murderous, he decides.
Granger looks up and blinks. She looks surprised, and before she can say anything he says, “Mind if I take this?” and waves the paper at her.
Draco turns from the tower window where he’s been observing a sword lesson below. Harry stands in the doorway.
“Dawlish is coming by around five to collect that basket so he can get all the donated toys to the Childrens’ House,” he said.
“It looks
Malfoy looked away.
“Forget about Christmas fighting crime with your partner? You wound me, Malfoy.”
Ginny looked up from the post she was sorting through, startled, then laughed. “Of course you have,” she said. And that had been that.
The room was empty, with the exception of a long, rectangular object covered with a sheet that had once been pure white, standing in the far corner opposite the room’s only window. He knew it, instantly, like something knocking at his bones.
piled up in the parlour.”
“Be careful there,” he says finally.
“Was there a reason you roughed up one of my Hit Wizards?”
“Carys Rhees.” Granger nods and writes it down. “The only structure near them is the lighthouse we saw when we Portkeyed in. She says a Tom Evers runs it now.”
for Harry directly, and Dawlish couldn’t remember if they did.” Granger sounds regretful.
Draco stares at him, and Potter reaches slowly and takes his arm, pulling his hand away from his body and turning it so that his wrist is held up between them. Potter pushes at his sleeve, pushes it up his forearm until it’s all wadded up around his elbow. When Draco looks down, the remnants of his Dark Mark are clear on his skin between them. It’s a pale gray, the outlines smudged. Some days he even forgets it’s there, for a while, until he flips on the light in the kitchen or dries himself off after a shower. Like a ghost, it haunts his arm.
“It’s not quite the same, I know,” Granger says, looking ever so slightly self-conscious. “And Harry says it’s not as— er, well, that it doesn’t have quite the extensive range of colours all together.”
him, can never get enough of his sharp, wicked smile or the way he’ll look at Harry from the corner of his eye right before he kisses him. If Draco knew how often Harry thinks about him throughout the day, every day, he’d never doubt what Harry felt at all.
Blaise looks up from his screen finally and leans back in his chair. “Why not?”
“Yeah,” Potter says, after a beat. “Yeah, I do.”
A list of moments in which Harry has imagined what Draco Malfoy’s mouth would taste like:
“I am not hallucinating or dreaming or imagining Draco Malfoy’s ghost in my house. I need you to believe me. I need you to take me seriously.”
As he drifts off tonight, he feels a little lighter somehow. A little more… possible.
Malfoy’s hair was slippery between his fingers, and he used it to pull his face even closer. He curled his tongue up, around the back of Malfoy’s teeth. He was always trying to feel out every cranny, every hidden spot on Malfoy’s body. Always trying to taste what made him tick, to kiss the things that made him ache. Sometimes, in these suspended, unreal nights, with Malfoy’s hands moving all over his own body, he felt a deep, slow kind of feeling rising up from his middle. Like Malfoy’s touch could reach somewhere he couldn’t even find, could lance the secret poison inside him and draw up a surprising sweetness.
Dolohov is expecting them. Maybe they'd given themselves away during their long surveillance, or maybe he is just rightfully paranoid after so long on the run.
Pansy’s face tightens, but she gives a little laugh, like it’s a grand joke. “Cassius finds honesty refreshing, you know. Qualities in such short supply often are.”
"It is never over," Snape finally says.
“This is—“ Potter pauses. “Stark?”
“Maybe I fucked up,” Harry says. He traces the grooves in the wood of his table, long-ago slips of a knife and burns from hot pans.
It’s raining, the night he stands waiting to see if Potter will show up to the meeting he requested by Owl.
Harry traces a path with gentle fingertips from the king, lingers over the rook, and then continues down to the pawns. Draco’s skin goosebumps under his touch. “But you can direct it, in a way,” Harry whispers. “You can…shape things.”
“Everything is always about you, isn’t it, Potter?” Malfoy interrupted. “Have you never considered that not everyone wants you for a saviour?”
His mother is in her solar when he gets home, writing in her calendar at the small table in front of the windows. The elves bring dinner as he sits down.
“That’s— Draco, no. I don’t care about that.” He walks over to Draco, stopping just behind him. “I only care about you, and my family. And I only need you to care about me and the people who love you. I— I think I love you, you know.” He pauses, his words suddenly clogged up in his throat. “Do you think— is that alright?”
Draco shrugs. “Maybe he’s just gone on holiday. Somewhere warmer than he’s used to, hopefully.”
The pink bougainvillea is still spilling in riots over the low walls that form the outdoor patios where there had always been a lunch or party or lazy siesta happening, but now all the lounges and tables and benches are stacked against the walls, growing moss and dust.
“Well, I don’t know them.”
this position. I didn’t want that kind of power. That’s what I told myself, anyway. But I think I really just didn’t want the responsibility.” Harry looks so earnest, but Draco still feels frozen inside.
Harry cried out. He couldn’t stop himself, couldn’t stop any of it. He was still here, right here in this dingy kitchen with Draco Malfoy, wrecked and covered with come on the floor. Malfoy’s hands kept him pinned to the map of the world somehow, like he was meant to be there. Like a persistent, stubborn intention. With their hands, they made each other real, and Harry came with tears and spit, with sweat and surrender.
He can still hear the tremor running through her voice, even five years later. He shouldn’t have said that. Not about Narcissa. But damn it, hadn’t he waited long enough? Hadn’t he spent enough lonely Christmases with people who didn’t want him? He just wanted to sit in the ragged, blue chintz chair in the Weasleys’ sitting room, with Ginny pressed up against his side, her red hair spilling down his arm while people came and went with a little too much rum punch and a few too many pastries.
Eventually, some version of Draco Malfoy drifted into the kitchen. Harry pushed out the seat across from him with his foot. “Might as well join me,” he said, and after a long minute the ghost-not-ghost of Malfoy did.
“Morning, Harry.” Hermione had her new reading glasses perched on the end of her nose. Ron liked to make fun of them, but she seemed to enjoy glaring at people over the tops of the frames.
Harry’s green, green eyes are locked on his. His entire face is lit up with hope and with something that looks a lot like love. Draco knows it, because he can feel it leaking out of his own face, from every pore.
“Because—“ he grins at her over his shoulder. “I’m going to bring in more evidence.”
“What do you want, Draco?” Blaise interrupts, never looking up from the screen in front of him.
“They were,” he says. “Those things you taught me— they were wrong. The world outside the Manor is not what you told me it was.”
Draco is still thinking about those words when Pansy finds him still in the telephone box. “People should be arriving soon,” she says, coming to sit beside him. She smells like the jasmine perfume he buys her for Christmas every year, and her lips are painted a deep ruby red. “Who are you talking to this time?” She nods at the telephone in his hand.
Draco looks away. “She’s already been forced to leave her home. No one else cares what Pansy wants. I won’t force it.” He glances back at Harry. “I’m not exactly desperate for a wife, to be fair.”
“What are you doing, Malfoy?” Weasley asks, shattering his hopes.
When Draco wakes up, the room is awash in the pale grey of first light, and the right side of his body is very warm. He moves sleepily toward that warmth, blinking slowly. Potter has rolled over in his sleep; he’s burrowed down into the space between his pillow and Draco’s, on his stomach, with an arm thrown over Draco’s side.
Harry’s hand stops moving and he goes still all over. His cock jerks in Draco’s hand, against his own cock, and Draco lets himself go, too—lets himself spill all over Harry’s hand and cock and body. Draco has never allowed himself this, has held on tight to whatever control he can manage, and now he lets it go. It takes him whole. It takes him right over the edge and drowns him on the way down.
, but the words have no sound, even though the kitchen window is open to the cool, clean breeze outside.
Hermione looked torn, her eyebrows wrinkling together. “That must have been very uncomfortable,” she began, and then had to stop when the laughter swelled again. “And you’re all grown men now. Ministry officials!”
“That’s fine,” he calls back. “Don’t let me interrupt the work of the masterpiece. I can entertain myself.”
"Then how do you stand it?" Malfoy's voice is scratchy, like it's catching on something sharp and jagged on the way up his throat. "How can you do this over and over, assignment after assignment, night after night, and stay so calm?"
Eventually, he realizes that the crowd has thinned considerably. Lucius is gone. Draco rises to his feet from the chair he’d slumped into, and stands very still for a moment as he gains his balance. He moves toward the door, and he seems to be walking faster than normal while his surroundings struggle to keep up. He thinks he can just make it to the Floo—
“You’ll see,” Draco says.
“I think we’ll actually Apparate from here,” Potter says when they exit the last station. “It’s still a bit of a hike, and I don’t want to get a cab.”
He lets his body rise up to meet Potter’s searching fingers and breathes out into the slowly brightening air, and everything is soft-edged and quiet. When Potter rolls over on top of him, one arm braced on the mattress at his side and his other hand wrapping around his cock—their cocks, pushing against each other and sliding, all skin against skin against the calluses on Potter’s palm— the familiar face above, filling up his sight, is like a drawing done in soft graphite. Shadows and bits of blue-lit cheekbones. A shape he could see even if the coming day wasn’t peering in at them with ever-widening bands of light.
“I thought we were partners.” Potter’s eyes are blazing, all green fire and Draco looks away. “We were in this together, Draco, and I—“
He leans forward. “Is that like a record?”
“Maybe I just don’t like how the sound of your lungs coming up through your throat is interrupting my leisurely contemplation of my sad, sad holiday.”
He groaned, and so did Harry, each echoing the other. “I’m going to come, Potter,” Malfoy gasped out. “I’m going to come all down your front. Right there.” He pulled out of Harry’s mouth roughly, and with a low sound and his hand stroking himself, did just that. Harry’s hand moved faster on his own cock, and then Malfoy slid to the floor in front of him. He reached out, replaced Harry’s hand with his own, and leaned forward, kissing him deeply, relentless.
“It also wasn’t really your fault that I was in your dungeons.” Dean’s voice is light— he has an ease about him that Draco envies. “You didn’t kidnap me, and you couldn’t control the situation.”
Draco shrugs. “That’s not how power works.”
Pick-up in the backyard of the Burrow.
“Alright,” says Harry. “Er— you’ll be doing the actual grafting though, right?”
And then the ghost of Malfoy trailed away, out the door and down the hall. When—several long, stunned moments later—Harry went to have a look, the hall was empty.
“You’ve been so brave,” he interrupts gently. “It was so brave, sending us that information. We wouldn’t have put the pieces together if you hadn’t.” Pansy looks up at him in astonishment, and Potter gives her a big, gentle smile, still holding on to her hand. It’s a kindness that goes right through Draco; freezes him up on the inside and then shatters him with a burst of heat, like trees thawing in the springtime, giving over their sweetness in gasps of surprise.
They sit there for awhile, and the fireflies come out, and some frogs start to sing far off somewhere, low and melancholy.
"We're cleared for surveillance now, and entry if we spot any sign of him." Luna piles her hair on the top of her head in a loose bun, which she holds in place with two wooden chopsticks. "I'll work on the house's layout and our positioning."
,” Man-Bun tells him earnestly. “It’s not about the trappings, it’s about the experience.”
“Going somewhere, Malfoy?” It’s Potter.
A bell rings suddenly, from a room beyond the kitchen, and there’s a whooshing sound followed by a loud crash and someone cursing.
“Draco,” Snape replied.
“Haven’t you ever heard that you should be careful pulling faces, Potter?”
“Mrs. Malfoy, I know you probably aren’t thrilled about all the press coverage,” he says. “Or the fact that I was kissing your son at all—“
Draco sits in one the severe-looking wooden chairs she’s got pulled up to the other side of her desk. She’d explained to him once, after he’d complained about how damned uncomfortable they were, that it was entirely on purpose— she didn’t want people she called in for difficult discussions or negotiations to get comfortable. There was a big, squishy armchair pushed back against the far wall, but it rarely got use. “It’s effective,” he told her, grimacing, and she’d just smiled at him, like a cat who’s already caught the bird. A hundred birds, probably. He’d been newly impressed with her instincts.
Harry looked up, but stayed quiet.
“I know the gossip rags aren’t the best way for it to get out, and I’d rather have told my family myself first, but—“ The words die in Harry’s throat. Draco has put a hand over his mouth, and his silence feels very ominous all of a sudden. Harry still can’t see his face.
“Did I miss something?” asks Potter, and Granger sighs.
“Potter?” He must already have had a few, because his face was more animated than Harry had seen it since Hogwarts, since that last terrible day, and before Malfoy had become so careful, so contained.
There are rose bushes growing all over a stone wall running along the far side of the property, in desperate need of pruning and some careful attention. There are two big oak trees in the back, and a clump of smaller apple trees, too. Way back, almost invisible in the wildness, he can hear the trickle and burble of a small creek.
Outside the Ministry, he stops with his team—Malfoy, Luna, Neville—and Hermione. "Lunch?" he asks them.
It’s just him, looking into the glass, and himself looking back. Somewhere outside, a bird whistles and the wind whips up the scent of clover from down on the grounds. Just Harry. The faces of his children flash behind his mirrored image: laughing, happy, pink-cheeked and windblown.
“Alright,” says Potter.  “Dudley Sayre, then.”
“It’s just, I realized you’ve spent the holiday here the past four years running.”
“McLaggen was here,” he says without preamble, and Potter stops with one arm out of his sweater.
Her eyes skim over his Auror robes again, and she waves her wand his way, sending one of the newly-made Portkeys into his waiting grasp. Another complicated twist and turn of her wand, and the mass of them rises from the basin and begins to organize into lines, hovering ready in the air.
“Sit down,” she says. “I’ll pour us some tea then.”
Fergus Finnagle takes off his spectacles and wipes them on his robes, looking at Harry with a benevolent expression. "Of course you did, Mr. Potter, of course you did! No one doubts your work! But when there are so few left to find anyway—"
And he does. He stays all night.
Finally, most of the table is involved in a spirited discussion of the best summer holiday spots in Wizarding Greece, and he tweaks Millie’s elbow to get her attention.
Draco hadn’t known his mother was even aware of who Dean was, let alone where he lived.
“Hmm.” Granger looks uncertain. He decides they’ve traversed enough minefields for one night, and doesn't press the point.
“No, thank you.” Malfoy follows him down the hall and through the kitchen. It’s Harry’s favorite room in the cottage, with it’s big, old AGA cooker and rough-hewn open shelving around the walls. It came with a scarred old farm table and polished butcher block and in the mornings he stands looking out the window toward the garden with his morning tea, feeling settled deep inside his bones.
Potter turns the room dark without a word, and the hairs on the back of Draco’s neck raise just a bit; he forgets, sometimes, just how powerful Potter is. The bed dips as Potter slides in, and the quilt pulls a little over his chest. Draco thinks about the conversation they’d had this morning, and he feels a flood of warmth for the man stuck in bed beside him. Once, when he was eleven years old, he’d thought they might be friends. There hasn’t been a day since then that he’s thought it could happen, though, until this one.
“There’s no excuse for not giving notice,” Regulus insists. “How could he—”
“Why?” Pansy’s crying harder now. “Why do you care? I was so—“
“Fuck,” Malfoy ground out. “Want your mouth. Want to see you, Potter.” He pulled at his shoulder, and Harry turned over underneath him. Malfoy let his head fall toward him, and their mouths took up the rhythm. They moved together, Harry’s legs coming up around Malfoy’s hips.
Malfoy flips him with a shoulder lowered to his chest, and then pushes him down hard into the mattress. Malfoy's hand curls around the back of his neck and Harry gasps, helpless and beyond any care for how he must sound.
“The garden is good? Are you having me on, Potter? I know your sense of humor is abysmal.”
“The legacy seats.” Granger glances at him, and then back at Potter. “The twenty-eight spots we gave up in compromise when we pushed the reforms.”
“How do people get the things that run the discmans,” Weasley asks suddenly. “You know, those little cylinders, what are they called?”
“Oh, I see. Yes, asking you to plan a weekend we would both enjoy is so high maintenance of me,” Draco says, standing up.
Potter is waiting by the elevators when Draco finally leaves his office. They ride down to the Atrium, and Draco steps into the same Floo. They come out in a telephone booth in Potter’s neighborhood. The walk is silent for the two blocks to Potter’s house, and neither of them speaks while Potter turns his key in the lock. As soon as the door closes behind him, Potter turns and heads to the kitchen, ripping his Auror robes off on the way. Draco follows, slow. The gap between the feeling and its expression feels looming and large, and always there’s that line inside his head. Right or wrong? Good man or bad man or always in between?
“Yes. I told you she was good. Mother’s just down that first path, Potter. I’ll come back in a bit to see how you’re getting on.”
Harry takes a step closer to Draco. “I went back and asked Godric to allow me the chance to work out a treaty between us. I didn’t
The Auror office is at its habitual low buzz, trainees running reports from the woken wires around the office, secretaries sleepily running through their datebooks, the sleek Ministry owls shifting on their legs and ruffling their wings. A mediwitch is working her way around the bullpen, wand out, cajoling and threatening Aurors into updating their medical profiles. He breathes it in, feels a tingle in the back of his throat. It’s better than any drug he’s ever tried, this simmer of anticipation, this charge of energy rumbling around him like a hive.
“You make eyes at him over corpses, Draco. There is nothing casual about that.” Blaise raises his eyebrows and tips his glass in Draco’s direction.
Regulus brings the news at dawn. “The lost heir of Gryffindor is back.”
“What are you talking about, Malfoy?”
"Possibly." Harry watches him and the grip of his long fingers against the glass. "Do you want to pull out now?"
She smiles. “Cakes to reveal your heart’s true desire. Teas for sleep, teas to calm nerves. Soups for sickness. Wine for creative inspiration. Poultices for chest infections and drops of tisane to sooth a fussy baby. That kind of thing.”
“Hmm?” Millie flips another page.
“No. I turned in my resignation more than a week ago, Draco. Before the pictures were even taken.”
“Where’s she going?”
“I don’t want to be— Harry Potter, wizard to the rescue anymore. I don’t want to be responsible in that way. Not to everyone.”
like he has any right to it?"
"Just one more," Malfoy says a few moments later. "There." He pats the pink-stained cloth across Harry's face one last time. "Just the healing now."
“Flowers, Potter,” Malfoy had said while he poured them both some firewhiskey. “You would not believe the tedious, complicated conversations about flower arrangements I am being forced to sit through. My mother loves her flowers.”
He clutched at Malfoy. He held on to one of his shoulders, and let his other hand slide down Malfoy’s front, chest and then his belly, down to where his shirt had ridden slightly up between them. He let his fingers slide under his waistband, and then he stopped. He pressed his palm against Malfoy’s bare skin there, where it was soft and heated, and moved with his every breath.
“I’ll keep watch in the hall,” Potter says quietly, his voice strange and heavy with something new that sets Draco’s heart racing.
“Well, you were!"
"Yes," Harry always says, and then Hermione always asks, "Are you alright, Harry?"
“Lucky
Draco leans in to kiss him, and then they come together with their hands and mouths again, and Draco is very, very careful to memorize every second as it happens, like a film he wants to replay. Again and again.
He sighs and sits down, pulling his own stack of new files and memos to review. Reports of large quantities of illegal ashwinder eggs flooding the black market. A spate of vandalism. He squints at this one, reading down the family names who’ve filed a complaint— they’re all old Pureblood families.
Harry takes a moment, after they’re all sitting down with full plates, to be fiercely, deeply grateful for his friends. For the people sitting around his table. Then he says, “There’s something I wanted to tell you.”
He sat, and stared at Malfoy, who had returned to his own table with a small saucer of milk. Malfoy drank slowly, in small sips, and fidgeted with his napkin. Finally, he looked up with a glare.
Draco doesn't answer the last part, because he isn’t quite sure himself. It would have been easier. Less mortifying. Stubbornness, maybe? Penance? Perhaps simply the pull of seeing Potter again himself, bad idea or not.
“A tea cosy. One of a kind, literally.”
Draco twitches, involuntary, but doesn’t respond to Potter's assumption. Instead, he says, “I know you owe me nothing, Potter. Less than nothing. But I’ll never ask you for anything else, ever again. You’ll never see me again, I swear, if—“
“What’s your plan?” Weasley looks between Granger and Kingsley. “I can tell you’ve got one.”
“You’re a real piece of work, Malfoy,” Potter finally says, and turns to go.
“There’s a first time for everything. This feels pretty right to me.”
"Luna will be gone all night," he says in puffs of air against Harry's parted lips. "Patience, Potter.” And Harry gives himself up to be ground.
“So,” Weasley says, after a moment, and when most of his first helping is gone, “what is it you’re after again, Malfoy?”
“Made something better already.” Blaise holds up one of the small rectangles, but it looks a little different— just a tiny screen and a big circle button. “But you have to download music onto it from a computer, so it’s not very useful to wizards yet. Pansy came up with a charm to make these run on magic, so they’re perfect.”
“But here we both are,” says Dudley, as Potter sits down again, staring holes at Draco. “You go to school together?”
When Draco steps out of the lift, the waiting room outside the Minister’s office is stuffed with people hoping for a moment with him. Draco hesitates on the edge of the crowd. This feels wrong, somehow. He doesn’t know what he’s doing here.
“Then touch me.”
“This is it,” he says, with the air of someone making a grand pronouncement.
anymore, was I? I don’t know how to be what everyone wants. Not anymore. Not even for Ginny.”
“It’s always been you, you know.” Draco’s voice is unsteady, a little damp sounding. “The question isn’t always the same, but the answer is. It’s always you.”
How to bend time and distance.
“Harry, stop,” Draco says. He gets his coat off and hangs it up on one of the weird metal hooks by the door. “I’m sorry, too. It’s like I can hear myself being a dick about everything sometimes, but I can’t stop.”
“Let me get this straight,” says Potter. “You want me to infiltrate pureblood society, disguised as someone else, and I’ll be doing it with Malfoy?”
Warrington’s Scotland house turns out to be a bloody castle. A small one, but definitely a castle.
“I don’t know.” Draco leans forward, the sofa creaking ominously underneath them, and brushes his thumb over Harry’s bottom lip. “I just worry, I guess.”
The second time they met was also at a Muggle bar, but this time it wasn’t by accident. They still pushed a bottle of liquor back and forth— Jameson, this time— but they
Harry looks incredulous. “And you haven’t married yet?”
“I was curious.”
There’s a new photo tacked up; a young woman in an old fashioned dress he recognises as the style Pansy likes from the period between the Muggles’ big wars, her hair curling softly around her face. She’s looking at the camera, or rather, the person holding the camera, taking her photo. There’s a busy street just beyond her— people coming and going, a child caught mid-shout in the right corner of the frame— but she doesn’t seem to notice anything at all except the faceless, nameless person she’s smiling at. Draco can almost
Draco leans forward and takes Pansy’s hands. “We’ll both live with it, together,” he says. “And probably be happier than most.”
Blaise looks over at him. Hermione is setting silverware on the picnic table behind them and arguing with Ron about whether to open a bottle of white or red wine. “I always wondered,” starts Blaise. “If you and Draco—“
Harry gestured at the huge basket he’d begun unpacking. “I’ve got a huge spread. All the good stuff. Pull up a chair.”
“I didn’t think that was possible,” Harry admitted.
“What do you mean?” asked Harry.
Malfoy nodded at her, a small, real kind of smile on his face. It was a smile that wasn’t for show, wasn’t calculated, and it made something flip over in Harry’s chest. He would need to be very careful, he realized. Very careful with this, with himself and whatever that little flutter was. With Draco.
Granger steps through his Floo with an enormous Christmas dinner, and her gangly husband pokes his head through warily behind her.
“That’s barbaric,” Draco said. “Muggles are so backwards and savage.”
“Well?” she says, settling into her own chair, behind her desk.
“Draco,” Harry whispers, and Draco turns his face just a fraction, so Harry’s breath can spill into his ear, so Harry’s voice can shiver up his spine and lodge in his chest. His lips drag along Harry’s cheek, up into the wisps of hair at his temple.
Draco has never put up Christmas decorations. The Malfoy house elves always did that, under Narcissa’s exacting instructions. He doesn’t even own anything holiday-themed.
Potter puts his hand on Draco’s collar, slowly pulling at the fabric like he’s straightening it. “Might as well turn in for the night,” he says. “Don’t you think?”
“We know very little so far, about anything,” Robards answers, and Draco listens to the swell of murmuring around him.
“It’s a consignment, so you have to put a bid in with the seller,” says Greg.
“Don’t be an arse-kisser,” Weasley tells him. “He needs ‘tough love,’ according to Hermione.”
“He won’t talk to me,” Harry says. He sounds miserable, even to his own ears.
Malfoy stopped jerking him off long enough to undo his own trousers and push down his underwear, and then there was a cock in Harry’s hand that wasn’t his own. Just unfamiliar enough to make every way he touched him new. He twisted his hand as he moved it up, lingered there over the swollen head until Malfoy bit his earlobe and groaned into it. The sound filled his head, turned his bones to jelly. He fell harder into Malfoy.
Draco shrugs. “People always talk. I’d rather have her as a friend than a lifelong antagonist.”
“No,” she says. “Go ahead.”
“Thank you, Twinks,” he says to the elf, and turns to Potter.
Frankly, every tree here is a shameful abomination compared to the massive blue spruce that usually stands in the ballroom at Malfoy Manor, but Draco bites his tongue and follows Potter up and down the rows while he fingers all the branches, like some sort of pine needle perv. Finally, Potter stops in front of one of the shorter ones.
Malfoy shrugged. “I read some of the
“Yes, but that’s actually my point. Harry—”
"There's a nest of Nargles in the bathtub," Luna says in an offhand voice, and Malfoy throws back the rest of his drink. Harry watches the curve of his throat as he swallows and the twist of his wrist as he sets the glass back down on the sink. There is a faint mark left behind where Malfoy's mouth had pressed.
Warrington inclines his head, still smiling. “Do you hunt, Draco?”
He sighed and rubbed at his tired, aching eyes. “I just thought everything was going to be better. After. I thought—Voldemort’s gone, things are going to get better. And they did for a bit, but now this. Barely two years without another full-scale crisis. What good was any of it? All the stuff we went through, and it seems like the wizarding world is ending, anyway.”
After, Draco starts to feel cold. Doubt starts creeping in and he doesn’t know what to do with his body. But Harry wraps an arm around his shoulders and a hand around the back of his neck.
Dudley’s eyebrows draw together. “Huh,” he says. “Well, I’ll tell her. I didn’t think it’d sell. Hope she gives it up— no idea why she’s so fond of it.” Dudley looks at him, apologetic. “No offense.”
ingredient in all kinds of things: beauty products, industrial solvents, transferring images on paper. We even produce it naturally, in our bodies. Wizards have other potions for the same uses, though.”
, and so eloquently.”
“Millie, please listen to me,” he continues, and she tenses up but stays quiet. “When he returns I want you to take him and go back to your hippogriff farm, and keep him there. From now on, keep him home with you. Do you understand what I’m saying?”
“Right. No big deal,” Draco echoes.
As he watches the shadows lengthen and stretch out, a wisp of silver catches his eye. It bobs and flutters against the stone wall, skirting broken pieces of an ancient lawn chair and lingering around the roots of the scrawny vines, before growing and settling into shape in front of the roses. A human shape. The evening is still hanging onto the last grey light of the dying day, so he can only make out an impression of its form, but it seems small. Young, he thinks, and alone. Its head turns toward the window, toward Draco, and he stands as though struck in place— one breath, two— and then the silver child turns away and blinks out of sight. His garden is empty again.
“I like you,” Dean says.
It seems to require a great deal of energy for Snape to continue, and when he does he sounds so tired, more tired than should be possible for a portrait of magic and paint.
“I need to know,” Draco said. He’d listed them— everything they’d found lingering in Lucius’s system— a recitation of trace herbs and equivocation, even to himself.
“Well— I suppose not quite one-way. Although most pure-bloods buy from a dealer, like Zabini, who purchases items and then passes on a mark-up, so Muggle businesses don’t see the full amount a pure-blood is paying for an item.”
“I— sure,” Potter replies.
Midnight: clear and cold, warm breath making clouds, a million silver-pricked stars winking down.
“Any new incidents?” he asks, coming to stand by him along a thick metal fence.
How to turn a mouse into a teacup.
“If I want the opinion of a stuck-up society Death Eater, I’ll be sure to ask your mum,” he said. It felt nastier than he’d intended, hanging in the air after it left his mouth.
“What are you doing here?”
Doing dishes by hand.
“Come on, Malfoy, I know they aren’t the most frightening thing you’ve sat down with at a table.”
He was born to do it.
“You’re not even an Auror anymore, Weasley,” Draco drawls. “In fact, you hold no Ministry position at all, as far as I’m aware.”
Draco looks down, and picks at the buttons holding his coat closed. “I’m not sure anyone has, except me.” He sighs. “I can’t remember the last time Blaise left his house, to tell you the truth. I think I might actually be the only one his wards let in anymore, too.”
, suddenly, leaning against the wall in the low light from a street lamp further down the alley. All long lines and angles, all silver and moonshine. And his mouth, with a bottom lip surprisingly soft and tender looking for all the cold, cutting words he could spit out. His
Harry looks up, into the face he’d once memorized, and still knew, somehow. “There’s something to be said for timing, I guess.”
“Ash in the mouth,” whispers Carys, staring down into her mug. “Babies you never get to hold. Roses dripping petals two day past their prime. Salt. So much salt. An ocean of it. That’s what I taste in the tea.” She looks up at him, and her eyes are dry but burning. His own sting in sympathy. “I thought he was dead. I thought Iwan was dead. I hadn’t heard from him in nearly a year, and everyone else was—“ She closes her mouth over the sound trying to escape with her words, and closes her eyes. “Everyone else was dead. The Death Eaters had gotten them all. His family in England, my family here. And I was all alone. Tom has always— always had a thing for me, you see. I knew. And I thought, what’s the harm? Iwan is dead and I’m so alone.”
It was explosive, this meeting in the middle. This crashing into each other. Wet mouths and teeth pressing into each other’s necks and lips. Fingers pulling at hair and clothing. Malfoy let his head fall back against the bricks behind him, and Harry rested his forehead at the base of his throat. Malfoy’s hand slowed its up and down, pulling deeply, steadily.
. Harry wanted Malfoy’s mouth, in ways he couldn’t articulate or understand.
“Why would I want to spend even
Hermione took a sudden, shaky breath. “I am taking you seriously.
feels vaguely threatening again, a tenuous, reversible kind of promise. He hasn’t felt like this since the War ended.
“Yes, well— I had my doubts.” She turns to Potter. “Dudley! I’m so pleased you could make it, too. I set aside one of the best guest rooms for you two. Do you ride?”
Draco brushes at something nonexistent on his sleeve. “My mother is not an idiot, Potter. Of course she put the pieces together.”
Draco lets his head fall and smiles against Potter’s lower back, then bites down, just slightly, before he pulls his fingers out. He rubs a hand, slick with lube, over his cock. He’s been hard for so long, the touch is almost painful in how good it feels.
He and Ginny were “taking a break” the next time he ran into Malfoy. He’d gone to the Muggle bar because he knew the quidditch game wouldn’t be on there. He didn’t want to think about Ginny, about her long red hair whipping around behind her like a streamer and the flush on her cheeks from the wind and how great the sex was after she won a quidditch match. He didn’t want to think about the ways they didn’t fit together anymore.
Kindness has unexpected reverberations.
If war comes, the forest will no longer be neutral ground, and the Malfoy lands will feel the pain of it first. Draco wonders and frets, and still the great, old forest keeps its silence.
“Maybe I’m done being careful,” he says to Blaise’s back. After a moment, he walks up and stands beside him.
Harry dropped the reins of his temper. “This is a ridiculous argument! I have no idea what your problem is.”
“Well,” Draco says, standing quickly, “I should be going. It was a pleasure to meet you, Dudley.”
“Dawlish told me someone from the party owled, asking for the list. Said they wanted to make sure everyone was on the same page. I couldn’t find any paper trails that show them
bad. Harry had been paying closer attention to Malfoy over the past year. They almost never worked together out in the field, since younger Aurors tended to be paired up with more senior ones, but he watched how Malfoy interacted with other people, and how they treated him back. He’d been surprised by how… well,
“And living with him in the meantime,” adds Granger. She’s firm again, all plan and logic. “You’ll be partners, and no one outside this room will know exactly what you’re doing, or where you are, Harry.”
“I can take care of myself,” Potter bristles. “I don’t need to— run and
The man behind the counter smiles at him, so he smiles back, and tips the change into his back pocket. Next door, he orders a croissant and a blueberry scone. There are more people out now, and he watches them talking and laughing, starting their weekend. The sun peeks higher between the buildings and casts shadows onto the pavement.
"I'll just work on the hero-ing," he says, a beat too late. "You know, saviour stuff."
When the tea is ready he breathes it in, malt and heat and earth. Potter tips a bit of cream in from the carton and a splash misses his mug and ends up on the counter. Draco sweeps it up with his thumb, then brings it up to his mouth, licking the sweet drops from the pad of skin there. He looks back at Potter and finds him watching, eyes tracking between Draco’s lips and the fingers he slowly lowers. He thinks about how long he’s been watching Potter— how long Potter has been watching him back— and then Harry is leaning into him, hands settling warm and gentle on his waist, his nose nudging into Draco’s collarbone and then rising. Harry’s lips brushing against his. It always surprises him, just for a moment, even now: how they slide together.
Hermione frowned and looked disapproving, but removed her hands from her daughter's ears. Rosie tottered off, reaching up carefully on her tiptoes to pull at a piece of silver wrapping paper on top of Harry’s desk. He nudged it toward her until she wrapped her small, dimpled fist around it. She started off again, and Ron continued, “Anyway, let’s just say Ernie thought his girlfriend might like something trunk-sized on a part of his body that wasn’t his stupid face. And since it wasn’t meant for…
“Work that bad?” Draco asks, then wonders if he’s overstepped. He’s not sure where the boundary is, after tonight. After Potter smiled at him that way.
“Draco.” Harry is all breath—his voice comes out as a whisper. “Don’t stop.”
Harry doesn’t look up from the blade he’s sharpening, his shoulders tense and his hands very careful. The raw scraping fills the room.
He could love Draco Malfoy, probably, not in spite of his flaws and contradictions, but because of them. And that meant that he, too, could be loved for all the dark inside himself in turn. For so long now, Harry had doubted that. And as Malfoy grabbed his hip, rough, and jerked hard against him, as they both cried out and came, their two bodies cleaving together like they could burrow inside the other, Harry thought that the most amazing bit of pleasure Draco had given him was the simple, pure feeling that he belonged right where he was. As real and fucked up and redeemable as anybody else.
“Evers,” he says, and the man jumps up, reaching for his wand. “Expelliarmus.” Draco catches the wand and tucks it into the front pocket of his robes, his own still trained on Evers.
“Thank god,” Potter whispers into his ear, and he kisses him, his tongue curling up to lick at Draco’s teeth. He pulls one of his hands away and reaches down between their bodies. When Potter’s hand wraps around his cock, Draco arches up off the bed and Potter thrusts into him, hard. Draco shouts, he thinks, but he’s beyond caring. He’s coming and Potter is coming, too, and his pleasure is loose and liquid and wordless in Draco’s ear.
Millie lets the magazine fall to her chest. “Because she had him before she got together with Marcus. Out of wedlock. Since they got married, they’ve pretended he’s Marcus’s. Everyone pretends Marcus is the father.”
Harry is looking at him in a way Draco doesn’t understand—he is both here with Draco, warm and rumpled, and far away, somewhere Draco cannot follow.
“Hello?” he calls.
, and take, and then, afterward, to give everything back in a different order.
“How so?”
Weasley shakes his head, a smile breaking out on his face. “Not officially yet— he’s new, and there’s been so much going on we haven’t gotten round to it yet. But I’ve been calling him Phoenix.”
Malfoy stared at him. “You thought I was haunting you for revenge, Potter?”
Love can never be forced.
“He’s asked permission to pay a state visit in eight days.”
“You’ll still bring me some honey?”
December 26th — Monday
Malfoy looked at him for a moment, a strange expression on his face. “Anyway,” he continued, “she went to Paris and started over. She’s doing alright.”
Draco watches the small, slender bone in Potter’s wrist jump, over and over, with the movement of his hand. He can observe all the minute details of Potter, the tiniest, everyday, extraordinary things, and never feel satisfied.
“Drop it?” he echoes. “How can I drop this? Tell me. How can I drop it? How can I still love someone after I’ve come to hate the very things they stand for? Still crave their approval— even as I actively shun it? To feel such
Draco sucks in an involuntary, unsteady breath. It’s hard to imagine, that Potter could see himself like that— in such a small sliver, so achingly distorted— but then maybe that’s the problem with being too close. It's hard to make out the whole of yourself.
“I was very surprised to read of your resignation from the Aurors, Mr. Potter,” Narcissa interrupts.
“I didn’t.” Snape leaned forward inside the portrait, his hands braced on his knees, his face filling more of the frame. “I existed, Draco. You have to be better than I was, better than your father. I can only tell you how to live by listing the ways I didn’t. Care about people intentionally, even when it’s hard and tedious, and let them care about you. The more people the better, because you’re less likely to fall into the trap of thinking you are somehow different from anyone. But most of all, you have to be able to move forward. Do it, Draco— keep moving. Leave the house and go out and see people. Even when you don’t want to. Even when it hurts. Let the world change you. This idea of keeping people apart, and pure, was the worst thing that ever happened to us.”
“You thought I was easy to get rid of, I guess?”
“And— it was made to look Muggle,” Granger appears rattled for the first time. “This was a Muggle bomb, and Muggle methods, made to look as if it were targeting a Society whose entire purpose is to preserve traditional wizarding history.”
,” Draco interrupts, and his father’s eyes flash dangerously. “It sometimes seems to me that you’ve forgotten who lost the War. And how close we were to losing a lot more.”
Finally, Potter sighs and rubs at his cheek with the cuff of his jumper. “I thought you were going to ask me to convince them to keep investigating. I thought your mother was calling in a favour.”
“You’re good at that,” he told him. Malfoy just looked at him. He was back to being contained and so, so careful.
“You’re welcome, of course, but particularly when you come bearing edible gifts.”
“You’re here,” said Harry.
Draco smiles. He can’t help it. Potter is lit up on the inside, he can tell; Potter really does love it.
Draco ignores the last bit. “I suppose it depends on your definition of ‘betray.’ Also of ‘friends.’”
, and then Malfoy’s fingers tightened on him again, and pulled, and he came so hard he made no sound at all.
Potter looks incredulous. “Alter it?” When Draco doesn’t respond, he continues, “There are spells to make something just a little shorter or longer, or more narrow or what have you, without shrinking the whole thing down.”
“I’d said already, if I had. We’ve had some local Aurors by the place, when someone took out a chunk of the containing wall.”
The thing is, if Draco Malfoy died in Azkaban, then—in a certain light—it was kind of Harry’s fault for not doing more to get him out. He’d submitted testimony, right after the war, about Malfoy’s ambivalence at the end—his refusal to identify him at the Manor, the way he’d lowered his wand in front of Dumbledore. But he hadn’t pushed things when the Wizengamot just reduced Malfoy’s sentence to a few years. And he could have, couldn’t he? He was Harry Potter, the boy who defeated Voldemort. Everyone would have listened to him then.
Potter twitches behind him, then stills.
Potter pinched him, right over the ribs. “Shut up. You know what I mean, tosser.” Draco threw his arm off and grabbed him by the shoulders, but Potter pivoted, and pushed, and they ended up falling on top of Potter’s bed in a heap. When he looked up, all he could see was Potter’s face above him: the green of Potter’s eyes and the way his mouth was curved up in a lopsided smile. Potter’s chest rose and fell and pushed against his.
“It’s perfect,” he says to Blaise, who has just managed to pick his careful way over with the generous use of some levitating charms. He brushes at the sleeve of his sweater as if something might be clinging on to it.
Harry shrugs. His skin feels tight, uncomfortable. He supposes that Malfoy has been watching him closely, too.
“I”d prefer a hole in the ground to that mausoleum you call Malfoy Manor, now you mention it,” he said. “But don’t worry— you’ll be able to slither on home to Mummy and Daddy and the warm company of your servants and galleons soon.”
is that damn thing?” He left the break room and started down the hall, Harry trailing behind as he went into the cloakroom.
“Is this Potter pining for the ancestral den? Tell me, do you actually go underground when you visit the Weasels?”
When they walk out, Draco throws it to the ground and sets in on fire with his wand.
“But what of the Malfoy lands?”
“But—”
He sighs. “Not Granger again.”
Harry grimaced. “I dunno, maybe something about—about him being dead?”
“I did,” says Blaise. Everyone looks at him, and he shrugs. “I wasn’t sure you’d have the balls to actually do it, but I could tell you wanted to. And it’s perfectly fine, Potter, to stop living for the whole world. I don’t mind confessing I had some serious qualms about this cottage, but look at it now. It’s yours. You belong here, and you know what you’re about.”
When Potter’s alarm goes off, there will be a quick, shared shower, and then PG Tips in a mug pulled out from the back of the cabinet because Potter hasn’t done dishes since the previous weekend. Potter will be looking for a match to his last clean sock right up until they have to leave or be late to the Ministry. He could leave whenever he wants, of course, but Potter will just hurry through his chaos a little more quickly and run out with him, his red robes tucked under one arm while he pulls on a boot with the other hand.
When Malfoy takes over the crossword and makes snide remarks about Harry’s education.
“I’m so sorry,” Harry told her. “I don’t know what— I’ll pay you. I’ll cover all the damage, I—“
“Strangely,” he says. “I’ve had dinner with Potter twice now, and it’s been— odd.”
That afternoon, Harry exits the bathroom to find Neville.
“Well, look,” she gestures with one hand, a kind of wave around her head. “This kind of mess is just not attractive on a younger witch, but it’s fantastic at my age. I’ve finally grown into it. Maybe a mole on my chin—“ She breaks off with a grin as he starts laughing, deep chuckles from down in his belly.
Warrington turns toward him. “Purebloods. Families with long, distinguished lines like yours, Sayre. Our control has been loosened in other Ministry avenues; we should try and get finger-holds in wherever we can. Don’t you agree, Draco?”
Potter puts a hand on the back of his neck, and Draco presses his lips into the skin below his ear. He raises his head, and then he kisses him. He kisses Harry, and he puts his hands on either side of his face. It’s slow at first, and then it’s hard and almost frantic. Potter’s hands are in his hair, and he pulls it, rough. Draco chokes on the sweet, sharp hurt.
Naples was supposed to be a dead end. They’d only sent him to tick the box, to say they’d checked the rumor out. But there was Macnair, in an ill-fitting khaki suit, eyes locked with his. There was the particular, weird light in Macnair’s eyes that fugitives sometimes got when they had already decided that they were not returning home, no matter what.
The ghost of Draco Malfoy shifted in the armchair, and his long, pale fingers began to fidget against the green velvet upholstery. “I went to Azkaban, and then…I don’t know.”
“Because you collect them.” Potter discards the edge of his slice and reaches for another.
Snape inclined his head. “An echo,” he offered. “I think what you’re seeking is just beyond the question of Lucius’s intent. What can this echo give you, Draco?”
Draco performs the hair charm on Potter’s head again, before they Floo to the Manor. “Remember, Potter,” he says, watching the lighter-colored hair smooth and shape itself into place. “You’re my close friend Dudley Sayre, back in the United Kingdom from a long stint in the United States, originally of the Dublin Sayres.”
“Yeah, I’ve been busy. Being haunted is kind of consuming.”
It wasn’t possible, was it? He and Malfoy weren’t built to love each other. He and Malfoy were a flash point, a coin flipping over itself endlessly. Collision and explosion.
Harry looks at Malfoy standing a little off to the side, but still near. His pale hair looks like starlight, his lines and angles impossibly stark against the bright day. Harry might have conjured him from dreams and memory when he looks like this.
Harry shrugs. "Dunno yet. We've got some leave time first."
“Yes, ma’am. Carys Rhees?” When she nods, he reaches into his breast pocket for his badge, and holds it out. “Malfoy. I’m here to support the investigation into yesterday's dragon maiming.”
“We have to stop meeting like this, Malfoy.” Potter’s eyes are twinkling. He’s such a Gryffindor.
“Why tea cosies?” Draco turns his head to look at Potter, who is watching him in a way he can’t quite pin down. He’s leaning his chin on one of his hands, his elbows on the table. The whole dinner has been casual and easy, and
“Oh.” The sun is almost out of sight, just a fiery trail of orange and pink left along the horizon, purple-dark dusk falling heavy over top.
“Sorry?” This time Harry wasn’t imagining the faint smile that appeared on the ghost of Malfoy’s lips. “What are you sorry for, Potter?”
“Yeah,” says Potter.
He was both surprised and not surprised to see Malfoy there, knocking back shots of a clear liquor at the bar. After all, Malfoy had always been a timely distraction, hadn’t he?
She still seems tightly strung— nervy and difficult. It’s hard for Draco to picture Potter living here, or even being related to Petunia.
She smiles, and snags a mimosa from Guido as he passes. “Thank you,” she tells the elf, and he nods his head on the way back into the house.
Harry reaches out and presses his fingers into Draco’s cheek. The air Draco pulls into his lungs is cold, and he holds it, slow and deep, feels the ache under his ribs.
Potter’s face is not entirely symmetrical. One of his ears is ever so slightly higher than the other, and that’s why his glasses are always slightly askew. He’s also got a very faint birthmark in the dip below his left cheekbone. It’s shaped vaguely like Portugal.
"Only that perhaps the Special Teams have run their course, Minister. While there are still Death Eaters unaccounted for, the majority have been captured. Covert operations are a hard sell to the public when they stop producing results."
“Draco,” says Harry, very softly. Draco shivers.
Pansy beams. “About four o’clock. See you then.” She strides off toward what Draco assumes are the kitchens, blithely unaware she’s just invited Harry Potter on a hippogriff ride. Draco shakes his head; sometimes the world truly astounds him.
Potter’s head is bent down toward his drawn-up knees, the back of his neck illuminated by the light above the door behind them. He’s rubbing his thumb against the side of his index finger, as if the tobacco has left traces he is trying to erase.
Harry looked back at her. In the Floo, her hair curled up and around her face and seemed to merge with the sparks and flames of the magical fire. “It’s just better, you know? To be stuck here with someone else.”
“Malfoy, what
Draco shakes the memory off as Guido says, “Master Blaise has not come downstairs yet today. Shall I announce you?”
, he doesn’t understand. How could he?
“You’re so good, Potter,” he whispers unsteadily, when he trusts his voice. “You look so good like this.”
Potter nods. “Let’s split up today. See what we can find out. I’ll see you at dinner.”
“A moment, Draco,” Lucius says after the meal, and he follows his father to his study. McNair, his father’s guard, follows and stands post outside the door as his father pours them both a cup of wine. Draco immediately feels uneasy.
the fondness in her expression. “He’s a good one.” She turns and holds something out to him. “I’ve got something for you,”
Blaise opens a drawer by his knee and rummages around, then sets a thin box just slightly bigger than his open hand on the desk. There’s a cord attached to it leading to one of the weird head pieces Draco has seen Muggles wear on the Tube. Blaise presses a button and the top pops up, revealing a shiny disc.
“Do you remember that line at the beginning? When he talked about the voices he sometimes heard right before falling asleep?”
“It’s just some skin,” he told Draco over pad thai. “I’m really not that bothered about looking pretty. I just wanted to get home, instead.”
is not a word that ever seems to apply to Pansy. He’s given her full freedom since she left her parents’ estate upon their betrothal, but it hasn’t made her any more content.
Draco scoffs. He traces the blue line on the parchment that marks the Abraxus River curling through their lands like a ribbon. If he could buy grain from the next city north of them, it could be brought downriver by barge. He calculates the coin at his disposal and wonders if it’s enough to persuade anyone to sell such a precious and dwindling resource.
After they’ve left, Harry goes out to his hives. He hums under his breath, and pushes out tendrils of magic. The bees hear, and feel, and respond. They swell out and over to him, brushing against him with wings and feet. Their little bodies clump and swarm over his shoulders and arms; he raises his hands into the air, chest-high, and they curl off his fingers and into the air, spirals and lazy curlicues in the late spring air.
“I didn’t mean to deceive you,” Harry says. “I didn’t want you to know who I was, yes, but only because I had no intention of
“There you are, Potter,” breathed Malfoy. Harry closed his eyes, let his hands fall to the line of Malfoy’s waistband slung low around his hips. A smooth slide of Malfoy’s lips against his, and his mouth opened up to Malfoy’s tongue, to its slick exploration and the taste of malt and spice. Malfoy pulled back.
And then he’s gone.
“Fancy a bit of a walk?” asks Potter. Draco looks at him. His cheeks are pinking up in the cold and his eyes are bright behind his glasses.
Greg lumbers out from the back room, a sausage roll dripping mustard all down his fingers. “Yeah?”
“I’m going to the Manor now. Best to get the inevitable over quickly. I’ll need my parents’ help to get a foot in again.”
He remembers the high-pitched whine trapped in Potter’s throat as he twisted the front of his Auror robes in his fist and
“Are you alright, though?”
Three nights' surveillance with no signs of life at the old manse in the Czech countryside and Malfoy is spoiling for a fight. He slams into their shared hotel room and rips off the black cap he always wears when they're working. His jacket joins it on the floor, and then his gloves, and Luna looks down at them, a dark puddle on the cream carpeting.
Harry laughs, remembering their faces. The shock, the awe, the bright enthusiasm. “I miss them,” he says. “I miss them little.”
“I dug out all the weeds and brambles myself,” Harry tells him, pointing out the new empty spaces. “But what’s left— the flower beds and the herbs and especially the roses over there— well, they need some help. Neglected too long, I suppose. I don’t really know what I’m doing there, I’m afraid.”
She just smiles again, and takes another drink. Behind her a big, triple-paned picture window looks out toward the ocean, and the white-stone lighthouse framed in the distance.
He tries to find Warrington the next morning, but the man is like an eel, always slipping off somewhere. Potter is off riding with Pansy again; he saw them heading out to the stables a quarter of an hour ago. He sees Millicent out on the magically-warmed terrace, flipping through a magazine and drinking something that looks vaguely alcoholic, so he goes out to join her.
He’d actually volunteered to take the Christmas day shift this year. Since he and Ginny had just broken up, there was no reason not to work the holiday. He couldn’t go to the Burrow, no matter what Mrs. Weasley said in her owls. Everyone was probably tucking in to one of her amazing Christmas breakfasts right now. He tore off a corner of the scone he’d taken from the party tray still in the break room, leftover from the department holiday party. It was dried out, and the currants inside reminded him distressingly of mouse droppings. He pushed it away with a sigh.
The bell rings and people begin to stand. They move to the big double doors, the men splitting off toward the library for brandy and cigars, and the women to the drawing room for— whatever they did there. Draco wasn’t sure. Pansy pauses, and puts her hand out to rest on Potter’s arm for a moment, looking at Draco.
After a few moments, Malfoy cleared his throat. “No peas?” he asked.
have done more.”
“Yeah. I had to go in for work stuff.” Potter looks kind of dismal for a moment, then switches gears. “So, about this tea cosy. You really want to buy it?”
They both look at the bed silently.
“So—” Draco took a deep breath, settled himself. “So he could have had a heart condition he didn’t tell us about? Could it have killed him?”
“I was orphaned as a baby,” he finally says. “My mother’s sister took me in, but they didn’t want me. They already had a son around the same age, and I was an unwelcome mouth to feed.”
“Why are you selling it?” Potter just looks at him; Draco wonders if this is an interrogation technique they teach their Aurors. He notes, with no small amount of dismay, that it’s working on him. “Look, I collect them, alright? I told you, it’s one of a kind.”
“I know,” Draco says, and Potter blinks, but relaxes just a fraction. Draco can tell now. “Alright,” he says, giving Potter a small nod. “Into the breach, then.”
“We’re always meeting over corpses,” is what comes out of Draco’s mouth.
“I don’t know how I feel about it all, to be honest,” she says.
“Oh. Please excuse— I’m sorry to hear that.”
“Why do you say ‘supposedly’?” asks Draco.
Potter lasted a month. A month where Draco had told himself he was not checking the Prophet’s gossip column to find the random pap snaps of Potter meeting his ex for lunch. A month of the occasional brushing touch that turned the air electric between them. A month where he pulled his own marriage contract out of his father’s desk drawer and read it more closely than he’d ever done.
“Civil.” Draco shrugs. “Almost friendly.”
“Precisely,” says Granger. “McLaggen’s public schedule was cleared, but our anonymous source says he was up in Scotland on a hunting trip, and that he never left the location.”
When he’s front-down on the bed, Draco kneeling behind him, he whispers back, “I want you. I want this.” One of Draco’s hands cups the back of his neck, and Harry closes his eyes. He starts with one finger, and his mouth pressing kisses across Harry’s shoulder blades. Harry wants more; Harry always wants more where Draco is concerned.
“Yes,” interrupts Granger. “It is. And I asked Malfoy here because I trust him, and because he’s good at his job.”
“I feel more authentic already,” he says, and wraps his arm around Harry to apparate them home.
Harry’s eyes look watery, and his voice is choked when he speaks. “Can I touch you, Draco?”
“It’s a general wellbeing blend, with a slight Know-Thyself charm. Things you need to work out, things that maybe you haven’t dealt with and need to, these leave a taste behind. The tea clarifies them.”
“I’m not going to come back here anymore,” Draco said. His voice was very quiet, but full of steel. “Not like this.”
Draco recognises it because it looks like the expression of that woman in the photograph, and maybe Draco isn’t alone in feeling like there are only the two of them in this moment.
“Enter.” Lucius’s voice is all winter now, all ice.
One more step.
They slaughter the oxen on the solstice. The yard is crusted with a brittle layer of frost that catches the dying light from the sun as it slips beyond sight. The longest night begins with blood. They keep fires going all through the darkness.
Harry noticed. He had learned them, like a map unscrolling under his skin. Learned the angle Draco’s jaw made when he was holding himself tightly reined in; knew from the clipping of his consonants when he was truly angry or just annoyed; could read by the speed of his movements when he was uncomfortable or in pain. All this knowledge hoarded and unspooling within him— Draco had slipped under
Lessons magic gave him:
“Not nothing. We aren’t ill.” Hermione looked away for a moment, at something Harry couldn’t see. He watched as her mouth, pursed with what he recognised as disapproval, relaxed. “Isolation is hard on everyone, especially after...” She trailed off and looked at Harry again. “Well, after everything. How are you
Luna makes a humming noise from where she's seated across from Neville at the small table. She taps her spoon on the edge of her tea cup. "More likely to make a mistake," she says.
In the shower.
“Is it one-way if Pure-blood money is being funneled into buying things from Muggles?”
“Oh,” Potter says. He tries to brush down the front hem of his uniform, but it stays a little crooked. “Right. Which item?”
“I intend them to be. Right now, a lot of wizards are thinking that the Muggleborn agenda wants to take their remaining sliver of relevance left in the Ministry. They think their way of life, their traditions, their very selves are under attack. They’ll latch on to anyone who tells them they’re too important to go away quietly, and that’s you. We’ll use them to take that seat.”
“Why would thinking of Pansy remind you of Charlie Weasley?” he asks.
“You’re back,” says Potter. He’s blinking, slow. Still throwing off sleep.
“You what?” he asked, walking in to the break room behind Malfoy.
“No,” said Harry, yawning.
“Yes,” Draco says, and he’s never been more sure of any answer he’s given. “
December 12th — Monday
"It feels like…it's mine to do." How to explain the forest, and what it felt like to wake up? How to describe the scent of crushed pine needles filling his head even now?
Harry stopped himself. There was no use going down that train of thought. Safer to forget it, tuck it away except for certain rare, bleary-eyed nights alone in his bedroom.
Draco goes in for another sloppy kiss, and then says, “I just want to be on top of you, anyway.”
“Got a job loading shipments down on the docks. A little magical cargo— large pieces, animals, things like that— but mostly Muggle stuff. It’s good for him, really. Lots of muscle work and little opportunity or need to speak.”
Pansy sends him a look of utter disdain. He supposes it’s fair—
But Potter looks kind of depressed, and Draco wants to keep him happy so that they can both go on pretending the other evening didn’t happen. So they go looking for a Christmas tree at the stand a couple blocks over.
“He’s part of the old generation,” Warrington leans forward, his forearms resting on the edges of the table, wrinkling the thick, white linen cloth. “They have trouble seeing past a lot of things, because they’re so old-fashioned.” He raises his eyebrows and glances at Potter, smile still in place. “But I assure you, I have no such hang-ups. Our generation is the future. Isn’t it, Pansy darling?”
— but tonight it’s as comforting as it is amusing. He wonders if other people felt like that, when the thing they’d always said they never wanted became what they wanted most.
When he leaves, she stands in the doorway and he looks at her for a moment. “It was good, wasn’t it?” she asks. “For a long time, it was good.”
“That sounds made up to me.” Draco tries to peer around her at Dean’s television, and she swats at him.
That night Draco dreams, and
He turns away from the windows. Pansy has gone all in on the Muggle mania. She favours square, upholstered furniture with wooden legs from the 1950s, jazz records on an old turntable, and everything art deco. She also has an old telephone box sitting in the corner of her living room. Blaise explained telephones to them one day, and she was so taken with them she went out and bought it the next.
time with you, Potter? Most of my life requires me to be in your company these days.”
Regulus keeps apologizing.
Receiving—a letter, an owl, a pumpkin pasty, a birthday present, a standard size 9 pewter cauldron, a wand, Hogwarts robes, enough to eat, a Weasley sweater.
Pansy turns her head to look at him, delighted. “Even Goyle questions your taste, Draco!”
“What was that?” Potter is standing in the doorway. He’s loosened the top of his robes and he runs a hand through his hair now, messing up the perfect lines Draco had formed earlier. Draco prefers it. He prefers Potter a little disheveled. A little real.
Three red uniforms on one end, and Potter at the other. The man doesn’t even look at the others; it’s like Potter has some sort of lodestone inside him and every piece of crazy is drawn to it.
He slid his hands forward, together, tugged apart the buttons holding Malfoy’s trousers closed. He was so hard already, so very hot in Harry’s hand and so ready to be touched.
“We’ll never run out of those,” she says, and he reaches for her hand, bringing it up to his chest where the telephone had been. She smiles at him, bright and determined, and he loves her for it.
Harry swallows. Narcissa Malfoy makes him feel eleven again, somehow. “I did, Ma’am. I turned in my notice before I asked Draco out to dinner that night, actually. I’ve been wanting to retire for awhile now, and the time finally felt right.”
Sometimes Harry thinks he’s good at loving Draco, but rubbish at finding the right way to show it.
“Do go on, Draco,” says Blaise. “”Tell us more about how you and Potter are
The younger Aurors weren’t there yet, perhaps because they’d all known Malfoy at school. Maybe there just hadn’t been enough time lapsed for perspective. Harry thought about perspective a lot these days. He thought about it when he held Rosie and when he watched Ron and Hermione growing suddenly into this new role of parents. And the truth was, from a certain perspective Malfoy's persistence in being here was its own hopeful bravery.
He notices Potter is already at his desk, right in the middle of the bullpen, right in the heart of the entire room. That was unusual. He could count on one hand the number of times Potter had ever beaten him to work. He watches him out of the corner of his eye. He watches Potter a lot without ever appearing to notice him at all. He’s reading through a report right now, pushing his glasses absentmindedly back up his nose where they’ve slipped. He’s got his crimson uniform robes on, but he hasn’t buttoned them up, and the t-shirt he’s wearing underneath has a slight v-neck that reveals the dip at the base of his throat and the angles of his collarbones.
“I didn’t know there were dragons left in Wales.”
“Maybe that bed doesn’t need to be any bigger,” Draco breathes into his ear, hot and damp. Harry’s hand is still sliding up and down his heated skin, and Draco’s hips are twitching and rocking on his lap. He nips at Harry’s lip again.
Draco presses the edges of his fingernails hard into his palm, uncomfortable. “I could have done more. I could have done
“Garish. Overpoweringly
Potter’s hand has been creeping down to the elastic band of Draco’s shorts. He slides his fingers under it now and Draco’s skin sparks and shivers underneath them.
“Cocoa.” Malfoy focused on Harry again, so he shrugged. “I was having cocoa.”
“I’m sure you were under a lot of pressure, growing up.”
Except that Draco isn’t returning his owls, or floo-calls. An entire week goes by. Blaise comes over at the weekend and pours them both two full glasses of firewhiskey, unasked.
“Don’t know what you’re talking about,” Evers says.
Harry gives her a look, but she just smiles sunnily at him. Within a few minutes, she's gone and Harry is alone with a pissed-off Malfoy.
“Just remember,” Draco says, “that you’re a stranger to him right now. We can’t risk anyone else at the Sanctuary overhearing who you are.”
December 13th — Tuesday
, it says.
“I keep thinking about these Sunday suppers,” he tells Harry. “Keep imagining more people at them. My friends, your friends. Your aunt, my mother. Packs of Weasleys, even.”
He pushes open the back door and Malfoy follows him out onto the freshly-cleared patio.
In the bathroom, Harry sits on the lid of the toilet while Malfoy leans over him, picking pieces of glass out of his face with a pair of tweezers. He drops them one by one into the bowl of the sink.
“Draco!” He turns to see Pansy striding across the hall to meet them. She’s wearing riding breeches and tall green wellies, and she looks strangely suited to her surroundings. “I can’t believe you actually came.”
Draco doesn’t know, but he doesn’t need to—only his father’s answer matters, after all.
“What’s the posh word for ‘bare’?” Potter calls from the mostly-empty living room.
“This isn’t like you. This isn’t Draco Malfoy.” Weasley’s eyebrows are drawn together and he’s looking down at him with his stupid freckled face in a twist and his stupid red hair lit up by the light coming in through the window. This would enrage Draco at any other time, but now he can’t seem to dredge the feeling up.
about things, too.
It's summer in Poland and Malfoy is beside him. They'd been working opposite sides of the crowd and somehow drifted together again toward the back. Their mark isn't here, anyway. Harry could call this tail off now—or at least send Malfoy back, as there's clearly no need for both of them to waste the night here—but he doesn't. Malfoy has taken off the hat he'd been wearing in a concession to the heat coming off the crowd, and the glow of the fairy lights catches against the gold of his hair, his jaw a dark, angular outline like another piece of rubble.
“Harry,” Draco whispers, his body continuing to fall forward into him, and he takes his thumb away to replace it with his mouth. Harry licks his way in, and pulls Draco all the way into his lap. It’s dark all around them, only the low glow of the fairy lights revealing them to each other. Under his sweater, Draco’s skin is warm and he pulls his face away when Harry moves his fingers down under the waistband of his trousers. He bites Harry’s neck as Harry wraps a hand around his cock, and they’ve done this a hundred times, but it still feels new, and urgent.
“You look like you’re off to a funeral.”
Weasley’s voice is quiet. “Yes.” He sits in silence and Draco lays there, breathing. “It never works,” he says finally, and Draco moves his arm off his eyes. “You can only change the things you do, not who you are. You could drink yourself to death, I suppose, but you’ll still die Draco Malfoy, the vain prick who lashes out at anyone who gets close enough to his claws.”
“And Alyce? Does Tom know she’s his?”
Draco nods. He doesn’t ask why, or mention the tea cosy. It feels like some sort of gift, and Draco takes it.
“You’re not really here,” Harry said.
Draco huffs. “Have we ever been particularly good at timing, Potter?”
“I want to speak to Blaise,” he tells Greg, who raises his eyebrows and shrugs.
“But you wouldn’t have heard his views on the Ministry, then,” Potter says. “Anyway, if Warrington’s out, maybe we can do a bit of snooping.”
“Well,” Pansy says from behind him. “Let’s think of this as a narrow escape from decor disaster, and you can take me to lunch now. There’s a little French place around the corner.”
Draco nods. The train slows to a stop, and he watches a new rush of people leave, only to be replaced. Potter clears his throat as the train picks up speed again, and Draco glances over at him.
“Well,” Harry says, “fortunately for you, I like you even when you’re a dick.”
“I thought you and the girl Weasley were a thing,” Malfoy pressed. “Weren’t you going to get married and repopulate Hogwarts with your horrifying spawn?”
Draco throws the Prophet down on his table. It’s getting dark, and he hasn’t left his flat all day. When the bell rings, he assumes it’s the Chinese he ordered.
“Mine.” Harry stretches his legs out, feet knocking into the bed post. He winces. “It’s always all my fault.”
“Yeah?” he says, breathing hard. Wanting more. Always wanting more.
He stares down at the light pink brew. “It’s a passing effect,” she says gently. “And then it’s only herbs for immune support.”
look, and then stalks out of the room.
It was shaping up to be a weirdly tense Christmas. Malfoy was all sharp corners; brittle and snappish and
, Potter. I am tired of watching you almost die on—“
When she had poured him a cup from a steaming tea pot, she set a plate of biscuits beside him, too, and then disappeared in the back again. The owl appeared to be multitasking a nap and keeping an eye on them; it took turns opening one eye, and then the other.
Harry gestures toward the baskets loaded onto riderless horses. “We’ve been luckier than most during this famine. We have a lot of coastline, and we brought dried fish. A portion of grain we can spare will come later should we come to terms. This is a gift, regardless of your decision.”
The kissing stopped, but Draco was still holding onto him, his lips resting just to the side of Harry's right ear. He closed his eyes and savored the feel of Draco’s breath rasping warm against the side of his face.
“I agree. It’s not Warrington’s style to let his henchman know too much.”
Draco sighs, and throws the folder back toward his bag. The pages spill out onto the dusty floor. “We said a lot of things. I recall promises of long baths and lying around in bed. Have you looked back in the bedroom yet? I’m not sure both of us can even fit on that mattress at the same time.”
Pansy turns around as Greg takes another enormous mouthful and searches for a quill. “Draco, you can’t be serious. That might be the most ghastly thing I’ve ever laid my eyes on.” She comes over to stand beside him, her shoulder bumping his, and they stare at the picture in front of them.
“You like that, Potter, don’t you? You like my fingers there.”
Harry knew Draco so well by now, and yet somehow today was different. Today Malfoy seemed very far away.
“Photographs are rather black and white. I’m not sure what you think might be left to doubt in this news story.”
“You’ll keep our name—that’s the best part. Salazar will simply name you prince, and someday when you are king our family will hold the throne and these lands as well.”
“Right,” said Harry. “Get out. Go haunt someone else. I can’t handle your pointy ghost face around the place with everything else going on. Go on, get the fuck out of my house.”
Only, consider: he’d thought he was on the right side once before, and turned out to be very wrong. Maybe, when you’ve been wrong before, you can never feel entirely sure of anything.
A record skipping, endless. Echoing.
He closes his eyes. It had been a rough few months, with the separation. The kids were all here at Hogwarts, and he and Ginny had still spent the winter holidays with them together, as a family, but it wasn’t the same and everyone had felt it. James would be graduating soon, and then it wouldn’t be long until they were all grown, and gone.
The sight of Harry Potter completely naked is something Draco is glad he didn’t pass up this time. His own clothes join Potter’s on the floor, and then Potter presses him down onto the blankets, crawling up over him, letting his mouth drift on Draco’s skin as he goes.
"Maybe," Harry allows. "Or maybe Dolohov changed his mind."
He just raises his eyebrows, and she rolls her eyes.
“And he’ll say no, of course. Potter wouldn’t sell my own piss back to me.”
Potter comes in about an hour later, already shucking off his boots. He looks surprised to see Malfoy there waiting.
Draco stares at Regulus. He’s tempted to laugh, but Regulus wouldn’t jest about something like this. “Well. I suppose we’re hosting a prince then. We’d best get ready.”
Potter turns on the wireless in the evening, and Draco listens from the armchair, his stomach full and his eyelids heavy. They’re playing an old recording of a Muggle reminiscing about his childhood Christmases in Wales. He’s got a wonderful, scratchy kind of voice, filled with its own particular cadence.
good.”
“There.” Draco taps a finger against the glossy photo tacked up on the
“What on earth are you on about?” Harry interrupted, amazed.
It is a really big fucking deal.
The ghost is back. He can’t tell what form it’s taken yet— it’s still just a vague human shape, this continual presence that keeps creeping up in his garden and in the back of his mind, driving him crazy. He feels bile rising in the back of his throat, and he goes to reach for the bottle of Ogden’s only to pull out an empty bottle.
He felt the same way now, as Draco’s not-solid finger traced up his wrist and rested against Harry’s racing pulse. It wasn’t like being touched in any way Harry had experienced before, but there was a force—feral and buzzing—that pressed against his skin, that sparked hot and cold all over his body. It shifted, ebbing and flowing, as Draco’s fingers skimmed up Harry’s arm and rested against the side of Harry’s neck. Harry tipped his head forward, his own hands reaching out, breath uneven, and hungry, absolutely ravenous to touch and taste Malfoy as well. But there was nothing to connect with: his hands passed through Draco’s form as if passing through a cold draft.
“When was the wedding again?”
They shouldn't work, but they do. After all, none of them are the same people they'd been before. There is another person behind each of them, and they—Harry, Malfoy, Luna, even Neville—have found those other people to be dangerous, and useful, and strangely complimentary.
Draco hadn’t expected Potter to agree about Greg that easily. He’s a bit nonplussed.
Harry is putting on his tie in front of the trifold mirror in the hotel suite's sitting room. He slips the wide end up and then through, reflected back to himself in the larger center piece of glass, doubles of his image flanking on each smaller panel.
“Harry!” she says. “You made it.”
“I can think of someone it might matter to, if you would crawl out of your self-indulgent, drunken sulk and pull your head out of your whiny arse.”
Draco watches the man, but Warrington’s either terribly good at acting or truly amused by Pansy. He merely raises his coffee cup and says, “Cheers, darling,” with a small smile on his face.
“—too late!” Spittle flies from the man’s mouth as he shouts at them. From the corner of his eye, Draco tracks three dark red uniforms spreading out and down the street, between the crater in the cobblestones and the lunatic who made it and people running, headed
“My fiancé is very occasionally useful, I suppose,” comes Warrington’s smug voice again. “Pity it’s never intentional.”
“Yeah, well, I wasn’t too good to him, when we were kids,” says Dudley, opening the pizza box to get himself a slice. “None of us were.”
At dinner, he and Potter are seated across from each other, which is normally how couples are arranged at these dinner parties. It means they can’t speak privately, but it does give him an unobstructed view of Gregory Goyle talking enthusiastically to Harry Potter about broom models, which is not a sight he ever expected to experience, let alone enjoy.
“The king is here.” He lays the king down on his chest. “And then the people”—two pawns nestle together on his belly—“are down here. The king owns the resources, so the power flows down.” Draco makes a sweeping motion down his torso. “But the king can’t make or tend all of it on his own, so the power flows upward, too. But then here”—Draco places a rook between the king piece and the pawns—“is me. I don’t
After, they sat against the wall, side by side. Potter’s trousers were back up around his hips, but he hadn’t buttoned them. He was staring up at the ceiling in the dark office they’d been in all night. Draco watch him for while, from the corner of his eye.
“You’ve heard? About my father.”
“They like to show off,” Millie says, turning a page. “This gives them ample time to wear more of their outfits.”
“Yeah.” Granger smiles as she watches him, and Draco can
“Why should I?” she calls after him. “Malfoy!”
“Yes, sir,” he says, and Robards nods. With a quick clap on the shoulder, he’s gone again, into the fray.
“Fruit trees, some good shade, a water source. I can put the bees back there.”
“Well…” Harry hesitated, and Hermione’s gaze grew even sharper. “It’s just that—it appears that Draco Malfoy’s ghost is now haunting me?”
“Besides,” she says, cutting a hand through the air between them, her eyes hard and sparkling. “It’s our generation’s story now, and we decide what it looks like. And I won’t let it look like it did before.”
“I suppose you’re happy,” he says. “To be going to the capital.”
Waiting for the takeout to arrive.
“There are people who care about you, Draco, and you’re worrying them,” Dean says, and the sound of the window being wrenched open fills the room.
“Whose fault is that?” he grumbles.
Saturday morning, and Potter is still sleeping. He pulls on his boots and grabs his wallet off the table.
At night, Harry stays close. He is Draco’s personal guard, and with the door closed he is Draco’s lover. Sometimes, as he goes about his business during the day, Draco will think about their nights together and flush all over his body. He thinks about bare skin on bare skin, about Harry’s limbs tangling with his under the blankets and Harry’s mouth moving so slow and heated across his chest, down his belly and finally around his cock. Draco thinks about the quiet, too, and the feel of Harry sleeping beside him, his body between Draco and the door. Draco’s days are full of worry and care, but his nights are full of sweetness.
, by any of our records.”
“Is Malfoy—the
“And I you,” Draco says to Warrington. “Pansy is my oldest friend, as you probably know. Her happiness is very important to me.”
“Why don’t you come in—“ Harry starts, just as Malfoy asks, “Is Mrs. Potter here, as well?”
“Yes, Potter. Let me guess-- you don’t like green foods.”
Draco sits stiffly, and waits. The Minister is listing press points for the statement he’s scheduled to make later in the morning, and Granger is nodding, clarifying a point now and then. He can feel Weasley staring at him.
have known then, if he’d been able to bear it: that he was in love with Potter. It had
going to check out the inside, right now, before you get too carried away. Allow me to be the voice of reason and sense for you, in Granger’s absence.”
Snape sat back again. “I’m sorry I can’t be of more help, Draco. But I think you will find your way by making the path yourself. It isn’t disloyal to leave your father’s shadow.”
“I think there’s been a misunderstanding,” Harry tries.
Potter’s lips go thin as he presses them together, and he cracks the knuckles of his index fingers with his thumbs. “Listen, Malfoy— I can’t get them to do anything in the Auror department. I just finished my training. I’m nobody there.”
Blaise pushes some keys, the slight clack the only noise in the room.
Like Potter will float away, full of light, higher and higher into a pale blue sky, if Draco lets go.
“Draco,” Harry breathes again. “Do you want to come home with me?”
He can’t read Potter in this moment. He can’t tell what he’s thinking. He’s just looking at Draco. He’s just watching him fall apart.
Evers tightens his jaw. He looks tensed up all over, like fight or flight is kicking in.
Pansy is out on the lawn with Weasley, urging him on in some kind of Muggle game that involves several small, multicolored balls. He watches Weasley roll a green one toward the somewhat smaller one that appears to be a goalpost of sorts. It stops about a foot away, and Weasley looks at Pansy with the air of being so underwhelmed that Draco can’t help laughing out loud.
Harry keeps his hands on the floor as Draco moves to his chest, trailing his fingers down the hard ridge of muscle that contracts and eases under his touch. Harry’s belly is deceptively soft under Draco’s hands, and his shirt has ridden up to reveal the light dusting of dark hair trailing down into his pants. Draco marvels at how smooth Harry’s skin is here, how it moves with his every breath, and, further down, how Harry has turned so hard beneath him. Draco stops the movement of his hands. He’s breathing heavier now than when they’d been grappling, it seems. He feels disoriented—slow and shaky.
“I’ll tell Mother. She’ll come up with something you’ll like.” Malfoy points over to the hedge. “I’m going to take a clipping of those roses. I think, judging by the leaves, you have a nutrient deficiency. It’s an easy fix, and Mother can send you some cuttings from her own bushes to graft.”
“It is,” Draco agrees. He looks at the streaks of paint and washes of color in front of him while Dean finishes his doughnut and picks his paintbrush up again.
“Why are you running errands for my mother now?”
Weasley is awkward at dinner. Tense. The whole situation is, really, but Granger is trying very hard and, surprisingly, so is Potter. And maybe there’s a strange sort of holiday magic that creeps out from people when you put some holly wreaths and candles up, but Draco doesn’t hate it.
Draco's long fingers stop moving on the tabletop. “You didn’t… leave the Aurors because of the papers? Because of me?”
“I am referring to a human one,” said Blaise’s mother. “Every elf in our Hall is free, and may come or go as they please. It shall always be so.”
“No? What
“What? No. Why are you asking me that?”
“You ready, Potter? You look ready. You look so—“
“Dragons?”
“No,” Draco admits. “But Warrington is definitely whipping up the purebloods on purpose.”
anymore, Severus.”
“Exactly.” Granger turns away from the poor beast in front of them slowly, like it pains her. “And that’s why we’re here.”
“Read it in the tea leaves?” he asks.
“What happens if you lose your blade?” he asks. He grips the front of Draco’s tunic and twists the fabric in his fist. His body is right against Draco’s body all of a sudden—the warmth of him so close, the smell of him filling up every one of Draco’s thoughts. The feel of him. The feel of his hands—one against Draco’s chest, down low under his ribcage, one pressed against his shoulder.
Twinks ears droop, and she wrings her hands, but nods.
about yet. I wouldn’t hurt you for the world, Ginny. Not if I can help it.”
“Quite,” says Lucius dryly. “Lady Greengrass is filling the parlour with her inimitable stream of prattle.”
A stick, a piece of wood with a bit of feather inside, and the tingling, electric feel of something wild and inexplicable flowing through and out of you.
“I see,” said Hermione, and she nodded. “I’m going to have to get back to you on this, Harry. It’s going to take me some considerable—”
Whenever they have some leave and they are back in London, they scatter into different directions. Luna visits her father in St Mungo's new residential extension of the Janus Thickey Ward; she has painted every wall of his tiny cottage and has started on the ceiling. She works on compiling the best articles from the now-defunct
The everyday, the magic always waiting, always ready, holding a world together.
Then Malfoy is beside him, and Malfoy's hand comes up to rest lightly against the back of Harry's. Malfoy presses two gentle fingers to the space between the delicate bones of Harry's wrist. Malfoy waits. Harry's blood pulses rhythmically against Malfoy's fingertips and he becomes aware of it circling through his entire body. He becomes aware of his body again, and he loosens his grip on Dolohov's throat. Dolohov sinks to his knees on the floor, wheezing, and Malfoy stuns and binds him, all with his fingers never leaving Harry's pulse point.
Grab and pull. Slide and twist. Harry knocks him to the floor and follows. They roll across the furs piled up to soften their way and onto the smooth stones. Harry pins him flat with a surprisingly strong forearm across the chest, but Draco manages to trap his leg with a foot and flip them so that Harry is underneath him now.
mistake, except Potter is not that kind of man, and he’s definitely not a rookie.
Harry is smiling at him. Draco can’t get enough of his smiles; he hoards them, a now ever-growing collection of the way Harry Potter’s face looks wearing happiness, and the way that happiness pointed back toward Draco is the best thing he’s ever seen.
There was a bad man, and the knowledge of that empty bed in St. Mungo’s reserved with his name on it, and there was a sudden, sinking regret that he might never see Harry Potter again. Never have the chance to fill that last, fumbling silence.
After they’ve made everything fit, and Draco has found the extra linens, he throws back the rest of his second full glass of Ogden’s and sets the glass in the sink. Potter eyes it briefly, then fills his own glass from the tap.
He cleared his throat in the silence. “Don’t get too used to this, Potter,” he’d said. His voice sounded strange to his ears. “I might not always be around to get your back.”
When they’ve both got steaming cups in front of them, she says, “I haven’t seen anything down here. The sanctuary business never reaches us here, except when Iwan brings all the news back home at night.”
“I don’t, Millie. Calm down.” He looks around, but everyone is engaged in their own conversations. “I swear. It’s just a— feeling I have.”
“I assumed as much. I suppose you can use this as practice being someone else. I’m leaving in an hour.”
“What?”
Draco doesn’t laugh. He doesn’t even smile. He moves past Harry with his bag slung over his shoulder and he picks his way up the crooked steps to the door of the cabin. When he turns the knob and pulls the door open, one of the hinges pops off the frame, and the entire thing lists pathetically to the side. Draco just shoots him a suffering look and leaves it like that for Harry to figure out.
“Er— I’m not sure that’s quite the same thing,” he’d said. “But I can give it a go.”
“You’d be surprised, Malfoy. What I’ve got in me.”
“Damn it, Pansy, I said I was sorry about that. You know I haven’t been getting all of my correspondence since I told my parents I was moving out.”
Draco turns and shrugs. “Would you believe any answer I gave?”
Greg shrugs. “Maybe they should flush your eyes out,” he says, moving back over to the desk. “Something’s wrong with ‘em if you like that thing.”
“I’d wager this one doesn’t miss much at all,” Malfoy continued. Rose clambered down, and Malfoy leaned back in his chair, looking up at them finally. “Don’t forget who her mother is.”
“It’s not that kind of magic.” She turns her face back toward the light. “Alyce!”
Potter turns, and pulls his wand,  adding the cosmetic charms he’s been using to his face. “Our informant.”
“I’ll go first,” Draco said. “I’ve got a list.”
Trophies gathering dust in an empty school and the faded memory of a crowd’s roar like the faint sound of a seashell pressed to the ear.
“It’s a highly flammable liquid compound.”
“You’re not complaining? That’d be a first.” Granger nods her head toward a low, rectangular building on the edge of the complex, and he falls into step beside her. “We can’t figure out a motive. This sanctuary has been really popular with locals— it created jobs, and the goal is to have Welsh Red dragons back on their native ground. They’ve been endangered for years, and only bred in Romania. It’s a public relations boost for magical Wales. So we’re looking at anti-government groups, or possibly some kind of personal grudge against Rhees.”
The yard is dirt and sweat and men striving against each other with their blades. Up in the tower, it is quiet and calm. Draco watches, and he’s alone.
“God, Malfoy,” breathes Potter. “Just fuck me already.”
“Harry,” calls Ron. “Will you please tell Hermione that red wine goes with everything?”
Draco opens his mouth, then closes it again. He tries to push down the instinct to feel defensive and just hear what Granger is saying. He thinks about how it must feel, to see the people who championed your inferiority for so long collect the things they’d once sneered at you for now, and for some of them to expect a pat on the back for it.
“Alright,” Draco replies. “Get me their name.”
“What do you even
“And we’re here because—?”
“Then you have more than one ghost.” Potter puts his glass beside Draco’s in the sink, leaning over and looking out the window.
She blinks, and reaches between them to pour more tea into their cups. “She found it at a charity shop near the factory that makes them. It wasn’t supposed to be sold. It was a prototype that went wrong, and it was supposed to be binned, but somehow it wound up there.”
“That doesn’t explain the dragons, though,” he says slowly. The Prophet appears to be doing a bit of a brush-up job on McLaggen; the photographs all show him in a library somewhere, or rolling up the sleeves of his robes at a Care Home for elderly witches and wizards. Draco is pretty sure McLaggen has never willingly gone to either venues on his own initiative. “I haven’t been paying much attention to the Traditional Wizarding Order, but dragons are inherently magical,
“Next week?” says Potter, as he walks him to the Floo.
looks at her. Her hair is bobbed; the ends rest just at chin level, precise and boxy, with thick bangs covering her forehead right down to her eyebrows. It suits her in its severity; Pansy had tried vainly to be delicate and wispy for years; she looks herself these days. There are signs of strain, though, that he hadn’t noticed earlier. Her makeup is as impeccable as ever, but in the glow from the candelabra above he can see the bluish shadows ringing her eyes and the lines around her mouth where she held her lips tensed and mask-like.
Draco swallowed. His chest rose and fell too quickly, his breath too fast to be entirely calm. He started to raise his hand, reached out toward the Snape painted into the heavy canvas and running on magic now rather than blood and pumping chambers of the heart. He let it drop back down to his side, though, with a new heaviness. There was no going back, not really. The flesh and the blood were gone— for Snape, and his father, too.
It occurs to him in stages that Harry Potter is curled up against his back, with an arm lying across his waist and one of his legs between Draco’s, and that he doesn’t need to run away from it this morning. He lies still for a long time, as the room turns from still-black to shades of blue and gray like the sea outside their window. After awhile Potter’s breathing changes subtly, and he presses his hand flat against the skin below Draco’s belly. His fingers skim and skate over Draco’s skin, and Draco breathes and grows hot with want all over again.
In his room at the hotel, Harry pulls a miniature portrait framed in tarnished brass from an inside pocket of his bag. He sets it on the dresser and sits on the end of the bed. The corner of the mattress sinks under his weight and he curls his bare toes into the plush of the carpet underneath them.
these things. I don’t know, I— I haven’t been able to stop thinking about that, since I saw that tea cosy.”
“You’re not answering your owls, Cassius! And I
He looks up, and Granger is looking at him. He holds her gaze. “But there are also some people, including me— and Pansy, and Blaise— who truly saw something special in Muggle things. In art and inventions and clothes. Whose intention is not to— well, fetishise or use for political points.”
“I am drinking tea.” Malfoy pronounced each word very carefully.
“She would have been welcome to stay here,” Malfoy says after a moment. “It was a very amicable divorce, and we always got on quite well. We just didn’t— have anything left between us, really, once Scorpius went to Hogwarts.”
He also stops keeping a precise track of time after that first week. It hasn’t been a month, but that’s all he can say for certain, and it’s in this wave of lethargy and unreality that he cracks his eyes open and realizes Ron Weasley is standing over him one afternoon. He knows it’s afternoon because the git has ripped open the curtains covering his windows, and the sun is slanting its way down the sky and shining directly in his face.
“Who were they expecting at their rally then?” Weasley is still a bit pink in the face, but he seems willing to let the previous matter drop for now, and he asks the question quietly.
"Do you remember a name?"
“You’re selling more than one?” He’s not sure why this surprises him so much. Potter just raises his eyebrows, and Draco hurries on. “The tea cosy.”
“Sandwich, Draco?” he asks, trying to tug the bread out of Guido’s hands, the elf protesting that he can make lunch for the young gentlemen.
Draco nodded. “They gave me my final round this morning.”
“It’s been over a week, Draco.” Potter looks tired. He looks rumpled with his Auror robes off, smaller and more worn— more human. More Harry. “No word. Not even an Owl. And you expect to just walk in and pick up right where we left off? I’m not sure I can do that anymore, Draco. I’m not sure I can ignore how lopsided this is between us, when it’s been two years.”
“You would,” says Draco. “I’m sorry.”
“It’s got me thinking,” Granger continues, “about how to share, between our cultures. I suppose it’s a matter of balance.”
“Take off the charms,” Draco orders, pulling back just a little, his voice hard and low.
The cost of doing harm.
Draco fiddles with the discman, closing the lid and popping it open again. “She asked after you, just before I came. She misses you.”
It was just one wrong turn, somewhere. A moment when his mind had wandered, when these old halls of stone and murmuring memories had lulled him into an absentminded sort of reverie, and he’d somehow ended up in a part of Hogwarts he’s never seen before.
“Tell you a secret?” Hermione asks, and squeezes his fingers. He raises his eyebrows and knocks his shoulder against hers.
“I always hear yours,” he finishes, and Potter’s smile warms him from the inside out. “I’m sorry. Harry—“
Potter’s face is all soft now, and Draco missed it so much. He’d missed Potter cracking open under his gaze, like Draco somehow had the power to see straight through to the Harry no one else got to see, not in his entirety.
“Of course you do,” Malfoy sneered. “Potter the Savior, Potter the Hero. Never wrong about anything, about anyone, are you?”
December 15th — Thursday
“Would you stop? It’s not your fault.”
Dolohov's next spell goes wide, and when it hits the windows behind Harry all the hundreds of small panes shatter simultaneously along the wall and the slanted ceiling of the airy, delicate room. The echo is immense, the impact percussive, and then the raining down of the smaller slivers onto the tile floor below sounds like the weeping of an ice storm. The shards of glass cut him on their way down, but he barely feels it.
“You haven’t even seen the inside yet,” he says.
“I—I’m sending Marcus up right away. Don’t leave the room until he gets here.”
“I haven’t been to the Manor since I signed up for the Auror program. I volunteered for the Christmas shift all these years because it was—“
“It’s Malfoy, Hermione. Draco Malfoy.”
— Dylan Thomas says through the speakers, the space crackling and popping between his memory and Draco’s ears, and Draco lets it wash over him. The voice and the story, the darkened room and Potter rustling the pages of the Prophet over on the sofa. He lets himself relax, and the next time he opens his eyes there’s an orchestra playing on the radio and Potter is asleep.
Draco has his tower. He has the view from his window and he has his books and maps and correspondence. He has daily briefings from Regulus and dinner with Pansy, whom he’s rather fond of, for all her sharp edges. Draco has responsibilities and he has luxuries most people only dream about. He has satisfaction and he has loneliness. He has many things, but he’s never allowed himself this.
Draco takes a deep breath, and Harry watches the swell of his chest. “Are you very hungry?” he asks, looks back up to see Draco watching his mouth.
"We've got him," Neville says, and Malfoy's eyes seem to glow from across the room.
The kitchen is dark and somewhat messy, with old tea cups and takeaway containers littering the big wooden table. “This is the Black house?” Draco asks.
The next morning, Harry went into the parlour and stared at the brown cocoa stain on his rug. Not quite a dream, then. Could he have hallucinated the ghost of Draco Malfoy? He wasn’t drunk, but he was very tired, and he’d been alone with himself for several weeks now.
Harry looks behind him. “Maybe Blaise should have the last word on that one.”
When he wakes in the morning, sleep still clouding his eyes.
Potter turns back to the mirror. “You know
Scouts are spotted on the border, in the forest. Draco orders extra guards to patrol and sends a letter to the capital.
Evers stops abruptly, and turns to face him directly. “I would never harm Carys, no matter what Iwan does. We grew up together, on this island. That’s her family’s cottage, and this is my family’s lighthouse, and it’s been that way since before we were born.”
“Why would you go after him alone? Why did you go there without me?” Potter insists.
forgotten, for me there is no longer a world beyond these walls.”
One-on-one, racing to catch the Snitch first.
“Yes. It took awhile to— extricate myself. I was never supposed to leave at all. There’s a lot of expectation around family and tradition.”
“Commander Black asked me to escort you back before it gets dark,” Harry says. The afternoon has slipped away, and the families from beyond the gates are heading home with their share of meat.
, he is contained, he is—
“I wouldn’t place any bets on that,” Malfoy said, and it took Harry a second to realize he was talking to Neville, because his eyes were still on Rose. He picked up a little folded-paper dragon from near his inkwell. It had been sitting there for ages; Harry had pulled it out of the Christmas cracker he’d picked this time last year, at the Leaky after their shift had ended. He’d solemnly, and a little drunkenly, given it to Malfoy, saying it was clearly meant for him.
When Alyce has left, that thick dark hair of hers swinging in snarls and the splash of freckles standing out boldly across her face, Carys holds the bottom half of the door open for him to enter. The kettle is whistling on the big, iron wood stove, and she pulls down two mugs and fills them up, sifting in the herbs from a big crock on the counter.
Granger writes that down, too, then taps the end of her quill against her mouth, gazing unfocused toward her hulking bookcase. “I can’t shake the feeling that there’s something more going on with this.”
“Yes, yes,” says Harry. “I’ve missed you, too. It’s time to go to our new home.” He pulls up some magic, something sweet and slow right in the very middle of his body, and he pushes it out, offers it up to them like a flower offers up its sweetest abundance. The bees rumble, and they take. They leave the hives in streams and they trickle over, brushing against his skin in whispers and ripples, and pour themselves into the open tops of the coiled wicker skeps.
Harry leaned in and cut off whatever words Draco had been about to say. It was so quiet suddenly, with his mouth pressed to Draco’s suddenly still lips, and after a moment, Draco let out the breath he'd been holding, a hot rush of their breaths mingling together. Draco tasted like spearmint and spice, and his lips were softer than they looked when they were underneath Harry’s.
“Hello, Twinks. Is my mother at home?”
They both look down at the medical building. Draco tries to imagine how he’d feel if someone told him he could never get on a broom again. Never see fields and forests streaming by beneath him and the wind pushing its fingers through his hair, across the planes of his face. Never feel as if the sky was holding him up in a pool of winking starlight, ever again. And for an animal born to fly, adapted over centuries to live half its life in the air…
“That’s business, though,” Weasley chimes in, looking thoughtful. “George sources his ingredients, and then the product he makes with them is marked up beyond the price he paid. Labor costs, of course, although I suppose purchasing and listing things for collectors is labor, too.”
“Yeah, I’m alright,” he told Ron. But for the first time since this whole magical pandemic started, it felt like a lie.
Just a few more hazy moments, and Potter is pulling at his hair and urging him up to his feet. He kisses Draco deeply.
“Is Warrington the party leader?” Draco asks.
Potter comes back with another young man, large and lumbering. “This is my cousin, Dudley. Dudley, Draco Malfoy. He’s interested in one of the things your mum is selling.”
Draco pushes harder, into him and down on the back of his neck, pinning him in place. Letting him do nothing but take. And then he’s moving, pushing forward and back again, and the world goes white behind Harry’s eyelids, all heat and pleasure and relief.
When they’d returned to their room, Potter had gone straight in for a shower. Draco listens to the sound of the water running behind the closed door. It occurs to him, in a particularly potent way, that Potter is naked behind those doors, a scant five feet away from him. Soaping up his various body parts.
“I’m aware of that.” Malfoy was writing something now, the tip of his quill scratching furiously across some parchment. He didn’t even look up.
Draco sits down and runs his hands over the deep blue velvet arms. Lucius waits, silent. Draco has seen him use this tactic on visitors all his life; it’s a subtle power play. He wonders, not for the first time, if his father uses it on him now because Draco is that much of a disappointment, or if he’s still pulling the shreds of his dignity around himself post-Dark Lord. He’s an elegant man, but Draco still remembers him straggly-haired and groveling. Panicked, toadying, completely without control.
“I can’t remember the last time anyone touched me,” Draco admits. He wishes instantly that he could call the words back, but Harry is unreadable in this moment, and all he says is, “We’ll practice grappling from now on, then.”
It’s always like this; Blaise sits and studies these photographs like other people might read a book. He dreams up stories and names, relations and problems, and always, always wondering at what the Muggles might be thinking in the moment they were immortalised, as though it were the great mystery of his life.
a litany
“I can’t stand to think about you being angry with me,” Harry confesses.
She blinks, and stares at him.
“What’d I miss?” Ron’s face joined Hermione’s in the Floo. “Are we still talking about that tosser Malfoy?”
He would see it, he realizes, even if his eyes were closed.
“Potter—“ Malfoy stopped, still studying something only he can see in Harry’s face. He blinked, and grabbed the half-empty bottle between them. “Potter, I’m ready to get out of this bar. Let’s take the rest of this whiskey somewhere else.”
“It’s slightly ridiculous, isn’t it?” Draco asks when they stop for breath. “Falling in love at our age.”
Suddenly, the houses rumble and creak, shifting apart to reveal the number on his paper. He takes a deep, steadying breath, and walks up the steps to knock on the door.
“I believe you,” Hermione said immediately, and Harry felt his body relax the rest of the way. “I need to do some more research. We’ll figure it out, ok?”
“I’m back,” says Draco. He sets the bags down on the table and takes off his coat. He lays the key beside it. “I let myself in.”
She lets her hand fall into her lap and looks at him. “I was jealous of her, you see, and angry. Always had been, because she went somewhere I could never follow. It wasn’t until years later, long after she died, that I realised Lily didn’t want to laugh at me when she gave it to me. That she just wanted to laugh
He should be at the Weasleys’ right now, with everyone else. Not stuck here with Malfoy on the duty they’d pulled by lottery, because no others Aurors wanted it. Malfoy, who shouldn’t even
“Where she looks like an old bulldog having a fit?”
Pansy and Blaise are already sitting in their usual booth when he arrives. They’ve met every other Thursday evening at The Dragon’s Flagon since they left Hogwarts; his friends are some of the few links he’s kept to who he used to be, and so they know him in a way other people never will.
Back home, at the Manor, Draco takes a hallway that’s been unused for more than two years. He turns a handle and the door they’ve kept closed swings open to the portrait room. He walks slowly down a long wall of Malfoy ancestors, and stops at the end, where Lucius takes up his spot. He seems to be dozing, head leant back onto the blue velvet cushion of the chair he was painted on. He looks… peaceful. Draco tries to remember if he’d ever seen his father’s face like that in life, all the lines of his forehead smoothed out, his mouth soft and so very, very human. Maybe when he was very young, when Lucius could be persuaded to let slip the mantle of being a Malfoy. Maybe when they were out on the lawn, just the two of them, and Lucius was teaching him how to fly the little beginner broom he’d given him for a birthday.
“Pansy,” says Potter. He holds out one of his hands to her; she looks at it for a moment, and then up at him, at his face. Her hand is shaking when she holds it out to him, but he takes it calmly, wrapping his other hand into a nest around it. He leads her to the sofa and she sits.
“Everyone—
“You saw him?” he asks.
“I don’t believe you informed Draco of your plans,” she finally says. “No doubt, you were quite carried away in other… pursuits.”
Draco quickly lies down, too, pulling the blankets up to his chest. When Potter stops rustling around beside him, he whispers, “Nox,” and sets his wand on the table beside him.
“Oh, just a few. The truth is I quite like getting old.”
Malfoy shifts his gaze to him, one corner of his mouth twitching up. “Yes, Potter. I didn’t expect plant grafting to be in your arsenal of talents.”
“What’s—“
“Yes,” Draco says. “She’s right.”
“Come in,” a woman calls, and he pushes open the bottom half of the door. As he’s latching it behind him, the woman comes in briskly from another room off the kitchen, wiping her hands on a large homespun apron. “What can I make for—oh.” She stops, her hands still tangled in the apron. “Are you an Auror?”
“Call me Harry, please. It certainly is.”
“I told you I would,” he says as she reaches them, and leans in to accept her kiss on the cheek.
The damned sling the Mediwizards had ordered him to wear was rubbing a patch of skin on the side of his neck raw. He eased the fingertips of his free hand underneath the fabric, rubbing the chafed patch gently. He winced, and looked over Draco, who was watching him. The blonde glared at him, and he pulled his hand away.
There were a hundred moments before that one, each a seed and a nudge, a single wand flare in the night, indistinguishable until lined up into a pattern completed much later, and by chance. But Harry likes this way of marking the shift, and so: It begins with the tremble of air between them, disturbed into being by the heavy bass, so loud and insistent Harry can't distinguish it from his own heartbeat. With the way everything feels a little unreal, a little smudged at the edges. The press of strangers like an ocean around them, the bodies all moving together, rhythm and abandon, and something makes him wonder what Malfoy's skin would taste like, if Harry's mouth found its way to his neck, just below the hinge of that stone-steel-starlight jaw.
He says, “I want to stay here. But that doesn’t seem to matter to anyone.”
A baby smiling at you on the bus. Handwritten letters in your mailbox. The way a flock of birds will turn together mid-flight, a dark cloud shifting its shape against the sky. The easy, comfortable silence between old friends. Cooking a warm meal for someone you love. Protracted, long-distance chess games and daily Floo calls even when you have nothing new to say. The incalculable beauty of badly-knitted sweaters. Stories, stories, stories. The language of trees speaking to each other, the reach of their roots. A hand curling around the back of your neck when you feel lost and lonely. Skin. Skin against skin. Cold noses and flushed cheeks. The dances of bees over their honeycomb. A stubborn cowlick that resists taming. Laughter from the belly. A longing, finally answered.
A few strokes and Malfoy’s hips were jerking into his with every movement. Malfoy was making little noises, groans and exhalations, every bit of reticence gone. Harry felt crazy, undone. He wanted to swallow Malfoy whole.
with—the ghost of Draco Malfoy.”
“Did I think it bothered you that the papers splashed around photos of you consorting with a known Death Eater?” His voice is flat and tight. “An apparently gay, male ex-Death Eater? I did intuit it might be a problem for you, Potter.”
"Are we cleared to go in?" Malfoy has been itching for action—too much down time makes him surly.
“Sorry, mate.”
Rowle’s face is nearly purple now. As if all the ugly things inside him have been building and swelling with no release for so long that his very skin is about to burst from holding them in.
“I don’t think it’s about helping them,” Draco says. “I think it’s about hurting Iwan. They say fear makes us do things we’d never do normally, but I think pain twists us even more.”
Draco does, and Potter closes the door quickly behind him. “Will you shut it?” he says loudly at a pair of heavy curtains hanging on the wall. The wailing is coming from behind them. “It’s one of your kind, anyway!”
“I think I’m going to go argue with Blaise some more now,” she says. “There’s Harry. Try to keep the snogging to a minimum, will you?”
“No. It’s the same ghost.”
He could feel Potter looking at him, and then an arm slipped around his waist. “I don’t think of your father when I look at you.”
“Stop showing off.” Ron tells him placidly. “It’s wasted on us.”
“Not necessarily.”
They wake up late the next morning—too late. The first thing Harry becomes aware of is Luna's hair draped across his shoulder, and then the unfortunate positioning of her elbow against his ribcage. He winces and rolls toward her a little, then realizes that the only thing covering his naked body is a thin hotel sheet down around his waist, and also that Malfoy is just as naked, and still in bed with him. He squints at them—he's not sure where his glasses have got to.
“I saw that spell somewhere,” he says. “I just recreated it.” His tea is gone, and the bees are still talking, calling out and wondering.
“Actually, it was just really fucking cold,” drawls Draco. “But I did manage to enjoy your sofa.”
Potter had come back from his ride spattered in muddy grit and windblown, but grinning. “I didn’t expect to enjoy myself here, you know? But that was great,” he’d said, peeling off his sea-soaked sweater and tossing it in the basket just inside the bathroom door. He’d dressed quickly for dinner, which was a small, quiet affair since most of the guests were arriving the next morning.
No one will sell Draco their grain. He manages to buy some pigs from an old man who can no longer care for them, and orders them slaughtered immediately and parceled out by family. There is a bite in the air now—the world turns toward winter.
It was unspeakable. It was unbearable. It made him senseless, Malfoy’s pleasure. He couldn’t get enough air into his lungs, he was going to pass out, he was going to
He follows the slight nod of Luna's head to a knot of people clustered at the far end of the bar, waiting to order their drinks. Just behind their group stands a tall man in a suit that hangs just a little too loose for his frame. His eyes dart around the bar and his hands are both shoved deep inside his pockets. His hair, slicked back off his forehead with pomade, is escaping its confinement in little curls around the man's ears and, though it's a lighter shade of brown than it used to be, Harry recognizes Antonin Dolohov.
“Of course, Father,” says Draco. He straightens his collar and walks toward the entrance, Potter a few reluctant steps behind him.
When it’s nearly dark he stands up and takes his now empty glass to the kitchen. Leaning over the sink, he looks out the little window to the back, where an old, crumbling stone wall runs around a small patch of green. Toward the back there’s a hedge of anemic-looking roses growing, and some scrubby vines that cling to the stone and reach sad fingers over the top. There are a few flower pots on the patio, but they’re empty except for a pile of cigarette butts from the previous tenant.
It worries him, sometimes. How easy he finds it now to kill a target. Once, killing had been insurmountably difficult, and it had been the only thing keeping him just this side of a line he hadn’t even fully understood. Now there’s nothing keeping him from crossing a line except his own judgement.
“We’ll make it last,” says Harry. “Draco. We’ll make it.”
Draco stands on the other side of the table and scoops up a bit of dough on his finger. “I think you mean you love my dick.”
The linoleum was hard and uneven under his knees, and Malfoy’s hands gripped the sides of his face, fingers sliding over his jaw and up into his hair. Harry looked up at him, and their eyes met. Malfoy pressed his lips together, hard, and closed his eyes for a moment. His cock swollen and a little damp.
