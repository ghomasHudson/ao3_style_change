“Good choice on the wine by the way. I like this vintage. Elf made wine is always excellent but some years it is truly magnificent.”
“Thank you.” Harry said. He accioed the broom and took a moment to feel its weight in his hand. “Nicely balanced.” he remarked.
But he never got to finish his sentence because at that moment a crack of apparatation announced the arrival of a very sweaty looking Draco Malfoy.
Seamus was cheering and chanting. "No more Auror Potter! No more Auror Potter!" banging the cushions in time with his tune.
He downed the whole bottle in one go, removed his sunglasses and then chased after Rose as she ran into the living room. His stomach lurched horribly, the potion not quite having kicked in, but by the time he'd scooped her up and swung her in a big circle around his spacious living room he was feeling marginally better.
Picking up his morning coffee, he cast a warming charm around him and went to sit on the bench outside the kitchen doors. The sky was blue but the air was crisp, the kind of December morning that Harry always enjoyed waking up to when he’d been at Hogwarts. He blew gently on the coffee, the steam momentarily fogging up his glasses.
would do that job well enough. He didn't think he'd ever dated anyone they hadn't at first idolised as the man Harry was 'finally going to settle down with', but when they inevitably broke up, the
An indeterminate number of hours later, he really couldn’t be sure, Harry was sprawled on the sofa next to Ron trying very hard to focus the conversation happening in front of him.
He decided to wrap his gifts the muggle way this year, he had the time after all. There was something soothing about the process, the methodical technique to wrapping a book, the challenge of something soft or oddly shaped.
“You want to get those ones, please.” Harry corrected. “And no you can’t just have my debit card, if you want to spend your allowance you have to ask.”
Harry set the cup in the sink and headed upstairs to get changed. Either way, it was ten thirty on a Tuesday, and Malfoy wasn’t around, even if a surprisingly large part of Harry wanted him to be.
He laughed. “If you found it difficult then there’s no hope for the rest of us mere mortals.” He blew across the top of his mug and breathed in the familiar citrusy sweet aroma, hints of star anise and cloves tingling his nose. “Is Ron here yet? I feel like I haven’t spoken to you both together in ages.”
He vanished the paper in frustration and was left staring at the now empty table. Fucking Malfoy. Once a bastard always a bastard it seemed. Harry was furious. It had only been four days since Malfoy had rimmed him with an inch of his life and now he’s taking some other guy out?
“Let me rephrase that.” Ron replied calmly. “Does Malfoy know you quite like him as a person or might he instead think you just quite like his cock every now and again?”
He'd hoped that cleaning Grimmauld Place would be cathartic, but all he really achieved was feelings of intense melancholy as he re-lived some of the more enthusiastic moments of his now broken relationship. That melancholy was only punctuated by moments of anger at the fact that the whole reason he was cleaning his abandoned house was because he spent so much time at a job he despised.
“So what did you talk about?” Ron asked. “He actually seemed pretty decent the other night, like he’s really changed. Did you talk about school?”
Draco continued his relentless assault on Harry’s prostate and Harry gave up on even attempting to sound dignified. Then he put his mouth back on Harry’s balls and from then on it was simply a matter of time. Pleasure swirled throughout his body, the duel sensation from his arse and his balls causing his dick to bounce against nothing. Harry didn’t have to be told to keep his hands away, he could tell Draco wouldn’t want him to touch himself.
Harry turned towards him, wrapping his legs around Draco’s so that they were face to face under the duvet and pressed a kiss to his chapped lips.
“Two small kids mate, you gotta be prepared. Mum was dropping them back early so I took three sobering potions last night, and paracetamol.” Harry nodded.
“I believe you had a question to ask me?” Malfoy said, and Harry felt the whisper of breath on his cheek. The glow from the lights was illuminating Malfoy’s pale face, and his eyes were sparkling.
The sight of the Hogwarts castle towering over the snow-covered grounds never failed to take Harry’s breath away. The sun was low in the sky but Harry’s entire vista was bright, the snow almost sparkling in the fading light. He refreshed his warming charm and marched through the gates, the snow crunching loudly under his feet.
Harry smiled at her no nonsense attitude. Since becoming a mother she’d managed to become, if possible, even better at being productive with short amounts of time. He didn’t know how she did it. “Right, okay. Let’s start with McGonagall.” He paused, realising that he had absolutely no idea where to start. “Just, help?” he asked pleadingly.
He was trying to decide whether to risk throwing the portkey or not when he felt a hot glow against the inside of his trouser pocket. A communication coin. The concept had stuck since DA and he’d got Hermione to make him a few more so that he could keep in touch with his closest friends and family. Ron and Hermione had some, Andromeda, Teddy, and recently, Stefano. He didn’t usually give them to boyfriends, but he’d pressed one into Stefano’s hand before they last said goodbye in Milan.
He untied both letters and watched as both owls neatly unfurled their wings ready to leave. He wandlessly spelled the door open for them before pulling out a chair.
Whether it was the stress of the last two days or the lack of sleep, on hearing these words something inside him snapped. “Oh come on Luna, this happened yesterday! Can you give me a few days before you start this shit?” He’d always struggled to keep a hold on his temper and he didn’t think he could be blamed today.
They made polite conversation as they ate, Malfoy recounting some of his training schedule and Harry peppering him with questions about the latest brooms. As the evening wore on they stayed at the table and the polite conversation tiptoed into something more flirtatious, where they both liked to go out, comparing gay scenes across Europe. At one point Harry’s foot had touched Malfoy’s ankle and he’d left it there for a while. Two glasses of wine and he now had the courage to gently run it back and forth.
“Thanks.” Harry replied, genuinely. “Maybe it’s in my future, maybe it’s not. I think perhaps not straight away. Something Malfoy said last night actually got me thinking. He said something about consulting. Wards, security, that kind of thing.”
Finishing his drink, he decided that a night out wasn’t for him. He found an empty side street nearby and apparated home.
“Oh Harry, he’ll understand. I expect half the fun was flying with you, I’m sure he’ll be just as happy on a regular broom."
. The point she’d been making had been fair, sure, but he couldn’t help but focus on that detail. He’d had plenty of one night stands before, but last night with Malfoy had felt, different. He’d had fun at the bar, and they seemed to be on the same page when they arrived at Harry’s.
They were lucky with the weather. It was overcast but bright, and most importantly it didn’t look like it was going to rain. Perfect flying conditions, well, apart from the cold. Although at least one of the group didn’t seem to be fazed by that. Teddy was positively vibrating with excitement, and had turned down Harry’s offer of a warming charm earlier. “
, that you not only quit your job on Monday, but that you subsequently ripped a hole in the Ministry’s wards when you chose to apparate home? Is that correct?”
Malfoy was licking him over and over again and Harry was groaning at every breath now. He loved being rimmed. Malfoy seemed encouraged by the noises Harry was making and Harry felt Malfoy’s own groan vibrate through his body. Those strong hands half his cheeks apart as an insistent tongue began to press inside him. Harry was grinding against the covers now, anything to heighten the sensation, but Malfoy’s grip made it difficult to move. It wasn’t impossible for him to come like this but Harry preferred the duel stimulation of a hand on his cock.
Harry tried and failed to fight his body’s natural response to blush. This was happening way too often.
“It makes sense.” Teddy replied after a moment. “You’re both the same age, you’re both gay.” A sly smile lit up his face. “And he’s
“On your knees.” Malfoy instructed. Harry complied, and Malfoy again grabbed his hips to pull him further down the bed. The man was standing now, spreading lube over his cock.
Harry arrived at the castle doors much warmer and slightly out of breath. He really must start exercising properly, he thought. Less than a month out of the Aurors and already his fitness was already shocking. Although, Draco
A thought came to his head. He took a moment to visualise what he was about to do, then he snapped his fingers, conjuring a sprig of mistletoe over his own head. He pushed his chair back, spreading his legs slightly, looked up above him and then looked at Malfoy. He was pleasantly surprised to catch Malfoy averting his gaze from his own crotch and delighted at the subsequent blush appearing across Malfoy’s cheeks. It gave him the confidence to lean back slightly. “Interested?”
Harry remained silent. Draco. He didn’t think he’d thought of the man by that name before. It felt weird reconciling it in his head. He wondered vaguely what it sounded like out loud.
Harry felt his pleasure cresting and then he was coming, hard, pure sensation swooping through his body, his toes and fingertips tingling from the force of his orgasm. Malfoy stilled on top of him Harry felt him empty himself into Harry’s arse.
“If we go out-” Harry started, then he took a breath. “If we go out, people might see us.” Merlin this was nerve wracking.
“Not at all. I’d like to. He’s been hassling me for years to have a go on my Auror one and I feel a little guilty that I’ve rather messed up my promise to let him have a go once he turns fifteen.”
Harry resolved to talk to Draco today about their relationship. For all it felt like a fairytale, without a sincere conversation about where Draco’s head was at, Harry wouldn’t allow himself to get too carried away. He’d planned to bring it up yesterday after all, but his cock had rather got in the way. He pictured Hermione’s eye roll and accompanying sigh of
Malfoy’s eyes darkened and he crossed the room to where Harry was leaning against the doorframe. He looked intently into Harry’s eyes, as if checking for something, but whatever he was looking for he obviously found as the next minute Harry found himself crowded against the door, Malfoy kissing him slowly.
Ron leaned towards him, briefly looking over his shoulder to check whether anyone was in earshot. “Hermione tells me that perhaps you enjoyed yourself after all, if you get what I’m saying.” He nudged Harry in the ribs playfully. “Are you going to see him again?”
Harry pinched the bridge of his nose. "Can you please stop." It was embarrassing enough to talk about this, let alone when Ron was very much on the money. Draco had insisted on taking him home and fucking him through the mattress after their public debut. That man had a possessive streak a mile wide and Harry’s body was definitely still feeling the consequences.
He glanced at the permanent tempus he'd had installed in the hallway and saw that it was only four minutes past eleven. Today was going to be a long day.
He hadn’t come untouched with Draco yet, but the man was definitely about to find out that for Harry this was entirely possible.
He took a bite of warm buttery toast, smiling to himself. He remembered their offer and thought back to that weekend. Spending time with Stefano felt like a lifetime ago. He supposed they’d never really been official, not really. Dirty weekends every few weeks did not a boyfriend make. If anything perhaps Harry had rushed into giving him that charmed coin, they’d barely known each other. In comparison, his memories with Draco over this past month were vivid with colour and emotion. The rush of excitement as he waited for Draco to arrive at his house, the flare of jealousy when he’d seen the paper that morning, the burning pleasure when they fucked. It felt more real than anything he’d had with Stefano, more real than anything he’d had in a long time.
He was polite and engaging with Hermione, he shared quidditch gossip with Ron, and, although Harry expected it had made the man feel extremely uncomfortable, he’d even apologised to Ron and Hermione briefly about his involvement during the war. He’d acknowledged that he owed them a rather longer conversation than the one they were having, and asked that they not decide then and there whether they forgave him, but that perhaps they could speak again soon, all of which Harry quite respected.
He hadn’t had much luck so far. None of the apothecaries he’d visited had even stocked the ingredients that had been uncovered, instead referring him to magical wholesalers.
“Yes yes very funny. Are you ready to go? I can finish this later.” Harry vanished the failed attempts.
“Right.” Ron continued. “So you’re telling me that you pulled a guy on a night out, asked him over a couple of nights later, you barely talked, and now you’re upset because he's been photographed standing next to another man?”
“But that’s how I know I like him.” Harry insisted. “We barely spoke and we just had this, Merlin this is going to sound so cliché, we had this
“Oh and thank you for the gift Harry.” Andromeda looked over at the little Christmas tree that sat in it’s pot near the door. He’d grown it himself and was very proud of it. Although it really was very small. Harry had attached a red bauble to the top lest it got confused with a regular hedge plant, but the poor tree was nearly bent in half from the weight of it. “It’s very-” she paused. “-cute.”
“Err, yes, just here please.” he nodded at the table, watching as she placed an absolutely enormous drink in front of him. It was covered in tiny marshmallows and colourful sprinkles.
“No no, I couldn’t. You’ve already done so much today! Thank you anyway.” Harry insisted. As much as he loved spending time with Teddy and Andromeda, after an afternoon of small talk he needed some alone time. There were only times you could say ‘Actually I’m taking a break from work at the moment’ or ‘No no, single, like last year’ without needing to spend some time in a dark room.
Harry laughed. “I know it’s wonky. Maybe next year it’ll be taller!” He grabbed a handful of floo powder. “Right. I’ll see you soon, and next time we can-”
Harry reflected momentarily that no, he didn’t, not really. Of course he’d been fourteen once, but he was fairly confident in saying that his experience hadn’t been particularly normal. He knew Teddy though, and he privately agreed with Andromeda. The boy was far more interested in friends and quidditch than baking, but he cared about his Gran, so perhaps he would listen.
“Good. I think you should.” She picked up his empty mug and placed them on the side. “Now, tell me what happened with Malfoy?”
“Look, Hermione.” Harry soothed. “I haven’t written to her back, but I will. I’ve got a few other ideas. I wanted to speak to Bill first about wards later actually.”
The team landed and dismounted and Harry saw Malfoy scan the stands as he packed up his broom. He nodded once when his eye’s found Harry and Harry waved. Should he go down?
“Hi Rose.” Harry replied, taking in the scene in front of him. “You guys look adorable. Are you wearing matching Christmas socks?”
“Honestly Hermione, I’ve been thinking about stuff loads since our last coffee, but I don’t think I’m ready for this kind of situation!” He looked up at Hermione from his seat at her kitchen table as she finished preparing their drinks.
“I’m here for work actually.” he answered, skimming over the question of how he was feeling. “I wondered if you could help?”
Ron froze, looking between Harry and Draco, no doubt taking in Harry’s swollen lips and mussed hair. The silence was excruciating and Harry wanted to melt into the floor.
Harry felt a smile tugging at his lips as the familiar swoop of adrenaline leveled out into sheer enjoyment. He truly loved flying. It had been a while since he’d flown for fun and he delighted in doing a few loops before catching up with Draco and Teddy. Draco was teaching Teddy how to adjust his grip for maximum speed so Harry took a moment to shamelessly ogle Draco’s arse. The man looked sinfully good in leggings. He looked forward to getting him out of them later.
It was amazing how quickly things could change, Harry thought as he blinked his eyes open the following morning. Less than one month ago he would have happily described waking up as one of the worst parts of his day. It had been the moment he was reminded of a job that he hated, or, if he was luckily enough for it to be the weekend, he was reminded of how tired he felt from working the job that he hated.
“I agree.” She gestured to her empty cup. “Well, I’m going to get a little more mulled wine. Would you like a top up?”
He wandlessly cut the water and waved his hand again for a drying charm before summoning a child appropriate outfit. He conjured some sunglasses and descended the stairs steadily, bare feet leaving humid footprints on the wooden floors.
“What kind of question is that Ron? Yes. He was literally round her the other night! Four nights ago in fact! And then he has time to turn around and fuck some other random quidditch player.” How was Ron not more angry? He hated Malfoy even more than he did when they were at school.
Of course he was curious to read what they’d said about him. After all, Hermione had been nagging him to cancel his subscription for years and he hadn’t. He always insisted that he liked to keep up with the quidditch leagues, which was true, but a small part of him was interested in keeping up with what the press was saying. If anything it prepared him for the bullpen most mornings.
“Something you want, Potter?” Malfoy asked, eyebrows raised. A lock of hair had fallen out of his fringe and Harry couldn’t help but think what he’d look like with it properly mussed.
“I’m happy to be of assistance, I’m not doing anything today. Have you got anything in the back though? I’m not sure how I feel about being on display.” He’d already noticed a few less than subtle glances, and while for now he was mostly hidden by the large Christmas tree next to the counter, he was sure it was only a matter of time before someone gained the confidence to come and introduce themselves.
While Teddy looked through the collection again, Harry felt Draco tug on his arm. He was holding two brooms, a Nimbus Two Thousand and One, and a Firebolt. Harry took a deep breath. “I thought we could make some new memories?” Draco asked gently, a touch of nerves in his voice.
Harry grinned at the memory of a particularly energetic afternoon in the kitchen, but the feeling quickly faded into frustration. It was damn difficult finding a good shag when half the people interested in you had a preconceived idea of what the sex would be like, and the other half were women.
Harry arrived back downstairs a short while later to find Rose quietly colouring and Hugo playing with a unicorn toy. Harry left them to it and headed to the kitchen.
She took a moment before replying. “I think you’d be fantastic Harry, but that doesn’t mean I think you should do it.” She paused. “You should only do it if you think it will make you happy, because it definitely won’t be easy. But if you think you want to do it, then I know you’ll be fantastic.”
“That’s it darling, like that. Perfect.” Draco breathed. If he could still talk, Harry thought, then Harry wasn’t doing his job. He redoubled his efforts, picking up the pace. His jaw ached, but he kept going, bobbing his head back and forth. His own cock was desperate for attention but he kept his arms in place, knowing that Draco would more than return the favour afterwards.
“Oh Hannah and I decided to leave you to it after Seamus challenged everyone to a centurion of after dinner liqueurs. I think he was trying to cast a gemini on the shot glasses?”
Standing with his forehead against the cool tiles as the uncomfortably hot water did its job did nothing for his mood. There had been no hangover potion in his bathroom and he didn't think he'd be able to navigate the stairs more than once. He didn't even attempt to use any of the magical taps. He was not in the mood for bubbles.
Harry spotted Luna behind the counter, a small mammalian creature with lime green fur balanced on her shoulder.
“Mmhmm.” Ron replied. “Drink your tea.” Harry took a sip. “Does Malfoy know you quite like him?” he enquired.
“Not yet Potter, I’m not done with you yet.” Then Malfoy was lifting Harry off his cock and pushing him backwards onto the bed.
This time they were out for longer. It was funny thinking back to his first go on his own Firebolt. At the time it had seemed unsurpassable in speed and control, but even now, as he tailed Draco, he could feel the difference between this and the Cleansweep he’d just tried. The Firebolt didn’t feel slow, but it was evident that broom design had moved on since his Hogwarts days. Draco was elegant but dangerous, changing direction unpredictably and throwing gleeful glances over his shoulder ever time Harry fell out of sync. While Harry had started out aiming to win, his strategy had soon shifted to one that didn’t end up with him embarrassing himself. Harry was sweating just trying to keep up with Draco despite the fact that he was riding a much better broom.
“I think I just saw him arrive. He was chatting to Rolf. I’m sure he’ll be over in a bit, you know how he is at these events, using us as human shields against people he doesn’t want to talk to. A bit like you actually.” she remarked.
soon after she returned from her travels and she housed creatures both visible and, as Harry diplomatically referred to them,
Harry nearly spat out his wine as he tried desperately to pull his mind out of the gutter. Picturing Malfoy, flies open, pushing Harry to his knees, was not helping. “No, you’re right. I want to do this properly."
When Harry awoke, he could immediately tell that it was late in the morning. He felt well rested for one, and there was a stillness outside that left him with the impression that London’s morning hustle and bustle was over.
“Fucking hell Malfoy. Can I blow you?” Harry asked as Malfoy pushed down his own underwear. Malfoy didn’t reply, instead pushing Harry onto the sofa and climbing on top of him.
A little shorter today, but hopefully you can forgive me after yesterday's chapter ended up being more than 3k!
Malfoy tilted his hips downwards slightly and Harry took him into his mouth. Malfoy made a guttural noise above him and Harry groaned as he shifted his jaw, swallowing as Malfoy’s dick touched the back of his throat.
Harry shook his head. “No, but I want to watch you.” Harry was delighted to see that he’d made Draco blush. He felt Draco’s rhythm stutter and Harry kept his eyes focused on Draco’s face as he watched him close his eyes and groan. Harry thought he looked beautiful.
Harry looked to his right. The man in question was still asleep, breathing deeply, blonde hair still unfairly well-styled. Harry absently wondered whether he slept with a charm in. He wouldn’t be surprised if he did.
Harry had chosen a small muggle place tucked around the back of the financial district. It wasn’t fine dining per se, but the food was delicious and the restaurant’s focus on lots of small sharing plates made it perfect for a date. They shared a bottle of wine, and Malfoy seemingly took great delight in explaining to Harry the delicate flavour balances in each plate.
“Busy night tonight?” he said to the tall bearded man behind the bar. He’d been here enough over the last few years to recognise him by sight, although for the life of him Harry couldn’t remember his name. He supposed he’d always been much more drunk than this.
Harry didn’t reply, instead he pulled Malfoy back in for another kiss and started unfastening the clasp at the top of his robes, revealing a crisp white shirt and surprisingly muscled arms. Harry moved his hands down, past Malfoy’s narrow waist and squeezing his firm arse. Malfoy groaned into his neck and Harry decided that he needed to hear more of that sound.
“Such a filthy mouth.” Malfoy chuckled, but then he drove his hips forward and Harry felt pleasure explode through his body.
“Oh you are on! Rose! Hugo!” Ron called up the stairs. “Grab your coats, Uncle Harry says you can practice throwing snowballs at him!”
Sorry that I missed yesterday - work has been super busy! I'll catch up before the end of the weekend :)
Of course, quitting in front of the whole department had meant every detail had been slapped across the front page of the
Harry sighed. He’d never hidden his sexuality from Teddy, but so far he’d avoided mixing his godfatherly duties with his love life. He’d always intended to introduce the boy to his partner once he found himself in a stable relationship, but the truth of the matter was, well, he’d simply never got that far. No one had ever been in his life long enough for Harry to even consider it. But this time was going to have to be different. Teddy already knew Malfoy and Harry wasn’t prepared to hide this from him. If it didn’t work out, Harry was just going to have to cross that bridge when he got there.
"Shush Ron." She turned to Harry. "I'm really happy for you." She said sincerely, and then suddenly Harry felt himself gathered up into a heartfelt hug. She kissed his cheek affectionately and looked into his eyes. "I'm really proud of you Harry."
The room was silent apart from the sound of their heavy breathing. Malfoy pulled out and Harry collapsed onto his back, one arm bent across his eyes.
McGonagall fixed him with a stern expression. “You may have moved on from the Aurors but you have a wealth of experience that the older children could indeed benefit from. I expect you’ll be able to keep their attention too, given that I believe you are now a major focus of the Modern Magical History course.”
She smiled, sadly. “I know I am Harry. On this at least.” she looked at the clock above the counter. “Look, I have to get back, but don’t think we’re done talking about Malfoy. And think about what I said okay?”
Harry gaped at her, but when no further explanation was forthcoming he sighed, resigned. Even though he was burning with embarrassment, he could still appreciate her looking out for him. She couldn’t have known they’d hooked up beforehand, but in fairness, her suggestion they do something with Teddy had helped him to frame Draco in his mind as perhaps more than a one night stand.
Harry read the letter twice more before a small smile pulled at the corners of his lips. Malfoy hadn’t said no! And he was going to see him tomorrow! In fairness, he hadn’t said yes either but Harry expected that he’d be able to persuade him. He smoothed the letter out, following Malfoy’s tight cursive handwriting with his finger. Merlin he hadn’t felt this excited for a date in years. Where were they going to go? What was he going to wear!? He needed help! His friends regularly teased him that he’d somehow missed out on the ‘being able to dress himself’ part of being gay. Harry liked to make them feel bad for stereotyping, but he did agree that he didn’t have the best fashion sense. His general approach to date outfits was to wear the tightest jeans he owned and hope for the best.
"Merlin, Ron, enough." Harry pleaded before they were interrupted. As if on queue Harry heard the sound of footsteps and was relieved to see Hermione enter the room.
Twenty minutes later the snitch was nowhere to be found, but Harry found he didn’t care. Flying with Teddy and Draco was just too much fun. They took a short break after Teddy asked if he could try a different broom.
“I don’t know if it’s my help you need.” she replied. “You have a lot of questions, and I don’t have many of the answers. I think you know someone who would know the answers though.”
Harry was already running late by the time he arrived at the Granger-Weasley household. He didn't even have an excuse. He'd spent all day wandering aimlessly around his house, throwing half hearted cleaning spells at rooms he'd neglected over the past few months. The only productive thing he’d done was write a long apology letter to Luna for his outburst the day before.
“I am.” Harry replied. “Very much so.” He paused to shake out his napkin before refolding it across his lap. “Are you?”
“No I know, I know. He’s just so composed, and I’m-” He let the sentence hang. He knew Ron would understand what he wasn’t saying.
Much later he found himself back at the bar in need of one last whisky. He’d only just managed to escape a conversation with some donor or other that Kingsley simply insisted he must meet. He wasn’t drunk, perhaps pleasantly buzzed, but one more wouldn’t hurt, then he could head home and maybe even roll a gillyweed joint. That should help him sleep. Or he could find someone to take home, a good orgasm never failed to knock him out.
“Nuh uh.” Draco breathed into Harry’s ear, making the hairs on the back of his neck stand up in pleasure. “Not yet darling.” Draco continued massaging his arse, long fingers gently pulling him open, teasing his hole. “I’d quite like to see your beautiful mouth wrapped around my cock first.” he said.
He looked back up at Ron. “Course I’m keen for a playdate.” He pretended to try and tickle Rose and she squirmed out of the way, hiding beyond Ron. “I can’t leave my two favourite munchkins without a playmate today can I?” he peered around Ron’s legs and Rose ran behind the sofa.
Draco looked him up and down and Harry felt himself blush. “Quite.” Draco grinned. “Well you’ll have to take me out then.” Draco suggested, pouting.
He had, of course, not wanted to come, but Kingsley had personally requested his presence. Harry had agreed, knowing full well that ‘his presence’ was likely to help lobby persuadable members of the more conservative opposition group on some piece of legislation or other. He generally indulged Kingsley when he made these requests, mainly because Harry thought that Kingsley was a good bloke doing a thankless job, but also because Hermione regularly asked him to use his strong personal relationship with the Minister to gain insight into upcoming policy.
“Yes, delicious. I was just about to comment. I really like the yoghurt dressing for the vegetables.”
Her little voice snapped him out of his malaise. It wouldn’t be fair on her to be moody now. He bent down to her level. “Because Ro Ro, Uncle Harry went for a run outside and he still needs to have a shower.”
“You’re welcome mate. One day you’ll be ready to leave the nest, though I reckon Rose might get there before you.”
Ron wrapped an arm around him. "Well, why not think about it this Christmas, you know, as things get quieter? Take some time to think about everything and plan it out."
Harry laughed. “Just having a look to see if there’s a better option than the gillyweed I have at home.”
Harry nodded and watched him be swallowed up into the crowd. He sighed. He guessed he’d have to do the same. He signaled for another whisky. Tonight was going to be a long night.
He looked up at Hermione. “I think this-” he nodded at the drink, “-rather undermines my outburst.” he offered.
“Mate, I know that you haven’t seen just the two of us in a while, but we also haven’t seen just the two of us without the kids for, I don’t know, about four months, so maybe you need to stop third-wheeling us!” Ron joked.
He stood up from the floor and summoned a joint. He was already pretty relaxed, but he liked the mellow feeling that came with gillyweed. Living room or bedroom? Going upstairs seemed like a lot of effort, so he settled into the sofa, positioning himself so he was half propped up against the cushions.
before dinner. He’d even had to strengthen the wards on his house after he was concerned that the sheer quantity of owls that were arriving would somehow negate his existing protections. It hadn’t been this bad since he’d been papped kissing a distinctly male companion a couple of years out of Hogwarts.
“If it’s specialist brooms he’s interested in, he could always ask Draco now he’s back in the country. I imagine he’d have all sorts, what with him playing professional quidditch.”
The paving stones were freezing underfoot and he immediately regretted not slipping on shoes, but he had closed the door now so he didn’t feel like going back for them. Instead he cast a warming charm over the path to his favourite bench. He conjured a cushion and sat cross legged, removing his feet from the stone for when the warming charm wore off. His hips protested. Merlin he was getting old.
“Fuck, D-Draco. Draco if you keep doing that I’m gonna come.” Harry shouted. The name felt awkward in his mouth, but he didn’t have much time to consider the moment before the man was bending one of Harry’s legs up over a pale shoulder and pressing back into him. “Oh god, Draco, fuck me!” It felt unbelievable, relentlessly pleasurable as Malfoy fucked him hard and fast. Harry’s cock was bouncing against his stomach and Malfoy reached a hand to support Harry’s hips so that Harry could grab and stroke himself in time.
Harry came downstairs the next morning to find not one, but two regal looking owls waiting patiently in his kitchen. He approached them cautiously, butterflies building in his stomach. He didn’t know what kind of Malfoy owned these days, but if he’d had to guess, he would have described one similar to either of the birds in front of him. So why were there two?
Harry jolted in surprise as he found himself suddenly with a lapful of child. "Rose joins cuddle too?" She shouted.
Decision made, he penned a quick note and sent it with Artimus, his owl of ten years. Then he resumed his place on the sofa once more and tried not to think too much into whether he’d come across desperate.
Malfoy pulled them both down towards the bed, pressing their chests against each other, and cutting off the rest of Harry’s sentence.
Apologies again for the delay. I've been kinda ill, but I promise I will catch up just as soon as I'm feeling more alive :)
The realisation scared him a little. He wasn’t sure he’d felt like this before. There had been other men in his life, of course, but those relationships had been casual, transient, physical. This, this felt different. He recognised a bubble of nerves in his chest and took a moment to appreciate how different the sensation felt to the dread and anxiety he’d been carrying around with him for the past few years. Maybe Hermione was on to something with this whole thinking thing.
Suddenly he was gripped by that feeling of righteous anger from earlier in the day. It swept up around him. "In fact, I don’t want to think about work ever again!" he announced to the room, in his moment of drunken enlightenment. "No more Auror Potter for
“Yeh I think so. Hogwarts was a long time ago, but I don’t think it would be healthy to ignore it.” Harry had long since accepted that the impact of the war wasn’t something he could avoid with the people he cared about.
Since quitting, his mornings had started later and later as he found himself lying in bed purely because he felt incredibly fortunate that
“Which makes you perfectly placed to consult on wards.” Ron challenged, eyebrows raised. He took a sip of his tea. “Look, so what you’re a bit more chaotic, at least you know it. And you’re working on it. Look at you, you’ve said more sensible shit in the past two weeks than I’ve heard from you in years.”
“You wish.” Harry retorted, although he kept quiet about his sore muscles. He didn’t want Draco to go easy on him. A part of Harry wondered whether he’d still got it. “Just waiting to choose my broom.” he added.
Many hours later he found himself crossing Oxford Street by the tube station. After a late lunch he’d decided to leave the house on foot, first taking a meandering route along the canal near his house towards Camden and Regent's Park, then turning south into Fitzrovia once the sun had set. He always enjoyed London at this time of year, the smell of mulled wine in the air and Christmas lights shining in the windows of homes and shops alike.
Draco shouted over to Teddy and then let the snitch go. They gave it twenty seconds. “Ready, go!” Draco shouted.
“Indeed. I can see why you had Teddy send me a note then, if you’ve been constantly surrounded by children. You’ve probably realised that they already have neater handwriting than you.”
Her party this year was no different. Despite the freezing temperatures, it was taking place outside. On arrival, all guests were given a pebble with a warming charm of Luna’s own creation. Not only did it keep each guest toasty as they stood in the garden, but when you began a conversation with someone else the two charms apparently merged to create a larger warming bubble. Luna had informed Harry that this was to encourage, in her words,
Malfoy looked at him, a calculating expression on his face. “I’d say you were fishing, but you actually want to know, don’t you?”
“Yes!” Draco cheered. He looked genuinely delighted for someone who surely did this most weeks. Harry couldn’t help but smile too. Teddy was clapping and Harry was momentarily surprised to see him at all. He’d forgotten there were three of them in the game. Draco flew to meet them, the snitch still tightly pressed in his fist. As Draco reached them, Harry grabbed him around the waist, adrenaline and affection rushing through his body.
Harry was about to correct him on his gendered collective noun when he realised Hermione and Hannah weren’t in the room. When had they left?
to shut up any time I go out, and this will only make it worse.” Draco remained silent. “Merlin, not that I wouldn’t be seen with you, just, I thought I’d, Merlin, I wanted to check-”
“Oh baby, look how needy you are already.” Draco breathed. He kissed Harry again, harder this time, running his tongue across the seam of Harry’s lips as he pushed his hips forward, once. The soft slide of his cock against Harry’s felt incredible, but it was over too quickly. “Were you thinking about this before I woke up?” Draco questioned.
Malfoy evidently interpreted his silence as his cue to continue talking. "I'm surprised to see you here. I seem to recall reading that you had-" he paused, "-decided to pursue alternative employment?"
“Oh Merlin I’d forgotten about that!” Harry groaned. “How do you remember that? In fact, how are you okay?”
Harry pulled his mind back to the present. Draco was busy Christmas shopping today and there was no use getting carried away.
“Yes I was. Only in the morning though. We usually have matches in the evenings on Wednesdays but this week is a slip week.”
"Ron." Hermione chastised. She turned back to Harry. "But look at you now." It was almost like she was sizing him up. He knew better than to interrupt her. "You've got a man in your life, you've got a job offer.” She took a sip of her wine. “Have you written to McGonagall yet?”
“Huh? Oh, no no. Just.. happened to be looking in that direction.” Harry managed to get out. He’d expected Malfoy to be here, that’s all. He’d thought he was being subtle but Andromeda’s raised eyebrows said otherwise. “These mince pies are delicious though.” he added, holding up his half-eaten one, his satisfaction at the topic change disappearing as he watched a large section of the crumbly pastry drop onto the floor.
Teddy reached for the closest letter and started to flatten it out before Harry snatched it from him, blushing. He did not need his fourteen year old godson reading what he’d written so far.
Harry slunk lower in his chair. “I know I know, just-” he sighed “-he’s just so goddamn hot. Do you know how hard it is to sit opposite that man and not think about going home with him?”
He could go flying by himself, he supposed. He was already three days away from the Auror training gym and he could do with some exercise. He wasn’t sure if he fancied flying alone though.
“We were-” he started, but then trailed off, he was still strongly tempted just to apparate away. “Why are you wearing a jumper that says ‘Jingle My Bells’? Can’t Rose read pretty well now?” he asked, aiming to distract Ron from the fact that he'd almost witnessed his best friend giving an enthusiastic blowjob.
Harry took a moment to roll his shoulders in an attempt to loosen up his back. He could still feel the effects of yesterday’s digging.
He hadn’t expected a speculative search of a warehouse in Dartford to result in anything more than a dead end, but they’d got lucky. What was intended to be a routine magiforensic scan for traces of illegal potions ingredients had instead revealed a busy operation far beyond anything the brief had prepared them for.
They started slowly, lathering each other in soap, taking the time to explore each other’s bodies. Draco washed Harry’s hair, his erection pressed gently against the small of Harry’s back. Harry’s own cock was untouched, but the mental image of them together, combined with the sensation of Draco gently pulling at his roots had him tingling with pleasure. Harry moaned as Draco moved his hands from his hair, over his shoulders, down his sides and over his lower back. Despite the warmth of the water, he shivered as Draco began to massage his arse and then moaned as he felt Draco’s drop to his knees. Harry pressed a hand against the shower wall and not a moment too soon as he felt Draco’s tongue push into him and very nearly lost the ability to stand up.
“You know it does.” Ron laughed. “I’ll always be here for your meltdowns mate. Especially when they’re boy related, it’s just too cute.”
“I’ll think about it. I hadn’t really thought of doing something like that before.” He put his hands in the pockets of his coat. “McGonagall wrote to me about teaching, so that’s the only thing I’ve considered so far. But I’m taking my time.”
He turned, and sure enough, next to him at the bar was Draco Malfoy. Of course Harry had bumped into him a handful of times as an adult, it was hard not to bump into people he knew in the miniscule wizarding world, but the last Harry had heard was that Malfoy had moved to France.
“It wasn’t hard to find.” he replied. “Also, the security at this place is terrible. I just walked right in, and I couldn’t only feel very basic wards. Nothing that felt like it would dissuade malicious intent at least, just your usual muggle-repelling stuff.”
“I know you didn’t say that Harry. But I was catching up with Luna last night and she said that you had shut her down rather abruptly when she brought him on Friday.” she said pointedly.
“I do believe we already have been seen together.” Draco stated. “Or did this morning’s activities affect your memory?” He leaned back against the counter and Harry envied the casualness with which he held himself.
Malfoy again. Harry turned to him. He still looked gorgeous, not a single hair had escaped from his bun which Harry thought was extremely unfair. He was sure that his own hair was a disaster.
“Where are your priorities?” Draco looked mortally offended by the idea that someone could put off replacing their only source of caffeine.
As if sensing his discomfort, McGonagall changed the subject. “The news that you had single-handedly ripped through the Ministry's wards recently made its way up here from London.” Her eyes sparkled and Harry’s stomach dropped in embarrassment.
“Yes. He-” Harry paused. “He actually helped me ask Draco out. He saw me trying and failing to write him a letter, and he… um… he took over.”
He was watching Dean's lips move, trying to work out if he’d somehow found a way to throw his voice, or whether Harry was so drunk that somehow light waves and sound waves had become confused in his mind. He was about to ask Hermione whether it was possible when he realised firstly, that she wasn’t there, and secondly, that something small and papery had hit him in the face.
“You’re the first I’ve asked. I couldn’t risk you getting snapped up by another organisation without at least asking. This school owes a lot to you Harry, and while teaching would certainly require a time commitment, it is immensely rewarding. I suspect that you’ll get out more than you put in. Especially someone like you.”
Harry relished every noise, every sigh, every curse. His lack of gag reflex was something previous partners had wondered at, and he put it to good use, taking all of Draco’s sizable cock into his throat each time.
“Agreed.” Malfoy was tucking his shirt into his trousers. “Now sleep tight princess, but do try not to fall asleep down here. I presume you have a large number of bedrooms in this house.”
Harry groaned at Draco’s term of endearment and then hot bitter semen was flooding his mouth. He held still, trying to swallow as much as possible. Draco was breathing heavily, and Harry almost missed the sound of the floo in the other room.
“You’re right.” Harry continued, taking a seat. “While I both understand and respect your reasons for inviting me here, I have to politely decline. I don’t think I’m ready to teach, not yet at least.”
Harry deepened the kiss, walking them both backwards until Malfoy was pressed up against the counter. Malfoy moved his hands to Harry’s hips and pulled Harry towards himself. Harry groaned into Malfoy’s mouths as he felt their cocks press against each other. Fuck this felt good. Malfoy was kissing up Harry’s jaw while moving one hand to press and rub against the bulge in Harry’s jeans.
“Umm-” Harry started. She was still staring at him intently so he thought he better be honest. “Well I had been thinking about, maybe, not being an Auror anymore.”
Light pressure on his shoulder encouraged Harry to sink to his knees. Harry relished the wave of endorphins he felt at the gesture. How did Draco know exactly what he needed?
It was currently five minutes to seven, the food was ready, there was a bottle of red on the table, and Harry was wearing the tightest pair of jeans that he owned.
But now here he was considering a new career path, and, when he lay in bed before going to sleep, his mind wandered to thoughts of what a future with Draco might look like.
Instead he weaved through the crowded living room and stepped out of the back door. He needed a moment. Shagging Malfoy was one thing, but going flying with him and Teddy, well, that was another thing entirely. That was a serious thing. Or at least a complicated thing. Surprisingly enough, the idea didn’t make him recoil. In fact, if he thought about it he could just about picture it. The day out, finding a secluded place to fly, maybe followed up by a hot chocolate, perhaps taking Malfoy home after dropping off Teddy. It sounded like a pretty perfect day if he was being honest.
He was fixed in a staring contest with a chameleon when Luna exclaimed. “Oh I know this one. This is a feather from a specific type of red bird of paradise. I forget the name but I can look it up for you. Their feathers are not at all common in Europe, they don’t travel well.”
“The point is-” Hermione continued, “-perhaps if you thought that relationship through, it could be a good chance for you to practice reflecting and planning before you dive straight into something new.”
He put his plate of toast on the bench next to him, casting a small statis charm to keep it warm and crunchy, then he reached for the pile of post he’d brought out with him. Artimus must be asleep somewhere.
It was moments like this Harry was glad he hit the gym most mornings. His own thighs were screaming in protest but evidently the pursuit was taking it out of the figure ahead of him more quickly. Just a bit further, then he could clock off and head home. He carefully uncurled a frozen hand from the handle of his broom and reached for the portkey - standard issue for situations where anti-apparation wards weren’t possible or practical.
pressed into the coin in his hand. He didn’t remember feeling disappointed then. Frustrated, yes, but disappointed? And here he was a week later feeling disappointed that he couldn’t spend the day with a man he’d spoken to for the sum total of about half an hour in the last five years.
He summoned his lube and began working one, then two fingers into himself. He was lucky the light was low because he was surely blushing under Malfoy’s intense gaze. Malfoy kept his eyes on him while he leisurely stroked his own cock.
Luna looked at him thoughtfully. "Maybe you should head home and run a bath Harry. I can give you a bundle of herbs which are
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “That was practically ancient history Potter. I haven’t even lived here for years.”
“Yeh, I like it like this.” Harry replied. And it was true, he liked the feeling of that first press, the slight burn, the cold shiver followed by warm tingling pleasure.
Draco walked over and pulled Harry close by his belt loops. “I am being serious.” he said quietly, then he was leaning forward and pressing a kiss to Harry’s lips. “Hey, relax.” he said, running his hands up and down the outside of Harry’s arms. “Why don’t we go to Diagon for coffee?” he asked.
Hermione pressed a cool bottle in his hand with a knowing look. "Teaching Rose about hangover potions already, Hermione? She's only six." he whispered.
They arrived at a small packing table after Ron had stopped to give an update to a few members of staff who were just arriving for the afternoon shift.
His nervousness turned to relief and then excitement as a reply came back almost immediately confirming that Malfoy would be over in thirty minutes.
Ron raised his eyebrows. “Sure mate.” He reached into his pocket and unshrunk a few toys for the kids. “Go and shower. Then you’re coming back down and telling me what’s going on. No arguments.”
He read Seamus and Dean’s message. It was brief, and judging by the handwriting had been written exclusively by Dean. That man really was a saint putting up with Seamus all day. He laughed at the line “
“My hero!” She handed him his mulled wine. “I’m telling you, maintaining a levitation charm when you’re trying not to fall flat on your face is more difficult than it looks!”
“Nngh, fuck yes.” Pleasure was building fast and Malfoy’s encouragement was enough to push him over the edge. He collapsed forward onto the bed, face pressing against covers, hand working himself through his oragasm.
He opened his eyes and glanced up briefly. Malfoy had one arm on the back of the sofa, the other moving to push back Harry’s hair. He looked incredible, all toned abs and pale skin.
The made out for a while, the ebb and flow of power translated through strong hands, passionate kisses, breathy moans. Harry was completely captivated, pleasure rushing through his body as they entwined.
Nothing to be ashamed of in the size department, Harry thought as ran his hands up Malfoy’s toned thighs.
was first with the sensationalist headlines. He wondered if there was anyone queer even working at that paper, they seemed to have no idea how most gay men lived in their twenties and thirties.
“No!” Harry said. “I mean, I err, I do, err, fancy him.” Harry managed to get out. “But you can’t write that!”
Harry scratched the back of his neck, nervously. “I’d say that ‘chose to’ isn’t totally accurate, I wasn’t really thinking straight at that moment.” he replied.
“Well-” Harry started. “We’ve kind of already been out, I mean, yesterday was out. But yes, I wanted to check in with you, whether you thought this might be going somewhere.” He looked up hopefully. “I’ve had a good time over the last few weeks, I think, I think we’re good together.”
“Of course!” Harry replied quickly. “That makes sense. Teddy would probably like someone he knew well there too.”
“Did I not tell you that your little tantrum was an overreaction? Remind me what Malfoy said last night?” Ron tried to imitate Malfoy’s drawl. “Who, Rory? We simply arrived at the same moment. He’s not my type.”
Ron raised his eyebrows, but Harry remained silent. His gut said yes, there was something there. But if the last few days had taught him anything, he had to learn not to always go with his gut. It was Malfoy’s turn to ask him anyway. Surely he wasn’t that desperate. Wasn’t he?
Andromeda smiled patiently. “I was saying that perhaps you could both take Teddy flying. I’d like for Teddy to get to know his cousin. He was only young when Draco moved to France. But perhaps he’d feel more comfortable if you were there too.”
He led the way, and if he sashayed his hips slightly while climbing the stairs, well, who was to know. He knew his arse looked pretty good in these jeans.
Malfoy pulled back slightly, looking directly into his eyes before biting Harry’s lip slowly. Harry swallowed. “You seemed like you’d be up for it.” Malfoy replied nonchalantly, kissing him where he’d just bitten Harry’s lip. “I’ve just arrived back in London and I don’t know anyone yet. Don’t tell me I wasn’t the best option in the room?” He smirked against Harry’s lips. “Ministry events aren’t exactly a popular gay hookup location.”
Most of the people in the cavernous packing room had apparated instantly, but one grabbed a nearby broom and shot through the open door, their hooded robe whipping Harry’s cheek as they jettisoned past. He’d leapt into action, unshrinking his own broom from his auror pack and kicking off. He’d barely had time to activate his personal tracking charm, let alone summon his gloves. Well, he thought bitterly, fingers aching, it’s not like his superiors gave two shits about his frozen hands as they watched a small dot labelled Auror Potter track across the charmed map from the comfort of the briefing room.
Harry sighed. Ron was probably right. Tomorrow meant publicity, it meant starting to make career decisions, it meant getting his life on track. But today, well today it was Christmas, and the only things that mattered were family, festivities, and definitely Molly’s roast potatoes. He had his friends by his side, an absolutely filthy note from Draco in his pocket detailing all of the things he had planned for when they saw each other tomorrow, and all the time in the world to think about what the following year might bring.
Malfoy took a moment to take a sip of wine. “Honestly, there’s always been something that has intrigued me when it comes to you. You have this
He picked up the now empty coffee cup and headed back inside. Stefano had been fun, but their time together had been limited to weekends when their schedules matched up. These weekends were few and far between, and had been mostly spent in bed together in hotel rooms in locations near to Stefano’s next match. They’d met in Paris, Rome, Tallinn and Lubliana and Harry had barely been outside, except for one notable weekend in Barcelona where Harry had decided to apparate to the wizarding district briefly to buy some gillyweed for them. Despite their six month romance, he couldn’t describe Stefano as particularly interesting. Neither of them had been particularly bothered by the other's career or social life, instead focusing on each other’s bodies, and occasionally the league. But Malfoy was different. While the conversation they’d had on Tuesday had been brief, Harry had found himself enjoying the playful teasing between them, and mutual displeasure at being forced to attend such a dry event. He knew that he was living up to one stereotype or another by finding one of the few gay men at a predominantly straight event and then proceeding to bitch about everyone else, but it had been fun.
“Thanks mate. I should have levitated them to start with. It’s the new shipment of our seasonal skiving snackboxes. We’ve been inundated with requests from people wanting to get out of awkward family gatherings.”
He cast a tempus revealing that, not only did he have plans today, he had plans in less than eighteen minutes - and that those plans involved at least two small children and one teenager arriving at his house.
Although the downside of thinking about Malfoy was that he was now more than a little turned on. There was a warmth there that wasn’t entirely to do with the fire cracking merrily in the hearth. He cast a quick tempus to find that it wasn’t anywhere near dinner time.
The only downside he could see was that although the air temperature was a comfortable twenty four degrees, they were still standing outside on the grass in December. It didn’t affect him too much but as he watched Hermione try and navigate back to where he was standing, he did feel a little sorry for anyone wearing high shoes. She was levitating their drinks and walking on tiptoes to avoid her heels sinking into the grass.
She magicked open the heavy doors and led the way through the empty great hall. It felt slightly unsettling, it being so quiet, but he supposed that term had finished. It was hard not to reminisce about his school days, the lazy weekend breakfasts and school cup wins. Taking a deep breath, he took a moment to acknowledge how it had looked after the war. It was different now, the colourful Christmas lights and decorations adorning the walls instead. Their footsteps echoed across the stone. “Is that what we’re doing?” Harry asked cheekily. “Discussing my career prospects?”
He took a sip of his tea and tipped his head back against the sofa. Teddy hadn’t stopped talking about their upcoming day flying with Draco, chattering all afternoon about brooms and maneuvers. But right now the idea of getting on a broom tomorrow seemed impossible, especially in front of Draco. An embarrassingly large part of him was gearing up to snatch the snitch right from under Draco’s nose, just like in their school days, although his slightly more realistic side said that Draco was a professional Quidditch player these days and was hardly going to lose to someone who’d played a handful of pick up games over the past year. In fact, the last time he’d even been on a broom was that disaster of a chase right before he’d quit the Aurors.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck and nodded. His friends knew almost everything about him, Ron had literally walked in on him and Draco a few days back, but something about the situation made him feel awkward. Draco wasn't simply a new squeeze, this was real. He didn't think he'd been in this situation before.
“A little.” Harry replied. And that was the truth. Towards the end of the meal they’d had their first stilted conversation about the war, the almost-finished bottle of wine giving them both the liquid courage they’d needed. Malfoy had mentioned conversationally that he’d tried his first glass of wine with Snape, which had led to a surprisingly respectful conversation about the man. Malfoy had given Harry the space to talk through his mixed feelings, and Harry had stayed quiet as Malfoy expressed his sadness at how things had ended up. They’d actually ended up toasting the man’s memory. It had been a sobering but poignant moment.
Ron continued to stare at him, eyebrows raised. “Have you replaced your coffee machine yet Harry? “ he asked pointedly.
Malfoy laughed. “Trust you to have a natural intuition for something it takes most people years to learn. You should start your own security consultancy, maybe the Falcons could be your first client.”
Harry was halfway across his kitchen before he realised that he still didn’t have a coffee machine. He sighed. Since his catch up with Hermione he’d done so well thinking through his chaotic life by himself, but now, with a date from Malfoy on the cards, potential job offer, and no coffee, well, this time he didn’t think he could do it alone.
given him a thorough workout the day before. He grinned to himself, remembering their lengthy and enthusiastic session once Ron had finally left the day before.
“It’s going quite well, thank you for asking.” Malfoy continued. “The training style is a little more intense than I’m used to, and it’s considerably colder than it usually is in Nice at this time of year, but the team is friendly. They’ve been very welcoming really.”
The smell of burning coffee roused him from his thoughts. Now he’d fucking burned his coffee! “Well fuck you very much Malfoy.” he snarled out loud, wandlessly vanishing the whole fucking coffee machine. This was what he gets for fucking thinking, Harry thought bitterly. He spends a few days collecting his thoughts and misses his fucking chance. He’d always been fine trusting his gut. He defeated Voldemort hadn’t he? He should never have listened to Hermione.
“Stop.” he said simply. “Thank you, but now is not the time. I made peace with this long ago, but now is not the time.” he repeated. Then he was kissing Harry and grinding their hips together again and Harry decided that there wasn’t much more he could do right now so let himself be carried away again.
“Uncle Draco, can I try this one?” Teddy interrupted. He was holding a highly polished broom with a slightly longer than average tail.
Malfoy wasn’t bad looking though. Harry took a surreptitious glance. He was pretty stunning actually, all legs and lean muscle, slightly taller than him, just what Harry liked. Harry was single now, and he hadn’t got laid in a couple of weeks.
“Were you training today?” Harry asked. “It was nice weather for flying, when the sun was out at least.”
He’d thrown the portkey in frustration. Frustration at another late night, another missed date, and yet another occasion where his superiors had sent him out into the night while they stayed in the oak-panelled briefing room with their self-replenishing cauldron cakes.
Despite having arrived thoroughly planning to turn her down, Harry stopped to consider McGonagall’s suggestion. It wasn’t what he’d been expecting. He thought she’d ask him about the Defence role. It made him think of Draco’s suggestion too. His imagination began to wander, part-time consulting, sporadic lecturing, it could suit him. And being at Hogwarts regularly would give him more time to see Teddy.
Harry felt himself blush. “He and I have err-” He scratched the back of his neck. “We’ve err-” Merlin how was he supposed to phrase this.
Harry looked down at the covers as he felt Malfoy’s warm, hard cock press against him, and then he was pushing back against the man as Malfoy held perfectly still.
He looked down at his shoes. Thirty two and he still couldn't control his temper. He knew Luna didn't mean anything by her comment. But even though he'd known her for nearly fifteen years now, it still got on his nerves the way she masked blunt comments with mystical pronouncements.
Harry looked to the floo powder in his hand, and then back up at Malfoy. He wasn’t sure he’d be able to get through a dinner without combusting. He wasn’t even sure what he wanted to do about Malfoy yet, and sitting across from the man at what would essentially be a family dinner while he was dressed like one of Harry’s deepest fantasies would not help him decide.
“Nope.” Harry replied. “We actually talked, like all evening. He kissed me goodnight outside the restaurant, but no tongues.”
“Something amusing Mr Potter?” McGonagall’s sharp Scottish accent pulled him back to the present. He hadn’t noticed her arrive.
Harry could hear her crisp Scottish accent in his head as he read. Trust McGonagall to send such a formal letter. He imagined her wry smile as she wrote the words ‘embarking on a new career path’. There was no doubt that she had heard of his less than professional exit from the Aurors.
His feet were carrying him in the direction of the apparition point even though he knew he’d get a bollocking on Monday if he went home now. Just before he arrived he looked up and realised he was outside Luna’s shop. She’d opened
“Of course it can.” Ron nodded. “But have you actually told him? I was under the impression the two times you’ve seen each other in the last five years were, how can I say this, a drunken hookup and a booty call?” He looked at Harry sternly.
“What are you doing here then?” Harry asked. “I mean, If you don’t even live in the UK then I’m pretty sure you don’t work here.”
Malfoy grinned and then flipped Harry onto his front. Harry felt him crawl up the bed, his trousers rubbing up against Harry’s naked calfs. Harry shivered at the image, him, naked, hard dick trapped against the covers, Malfoy, on top, fully dressed. Then he felt a warm breath against his hole and he lost the ability to think at all.
“An hour!?” Teddy exclaimed. “I’m trying to be nice to you Harry but that’s really pathetic.” He grabbed a blank piece of parchment and Harry’s quill. Harry watched him with faint amusement as Teddy took a moment to think before writing
