Draco breathes out a sigh against Harry’s neck, unable to resist giving the smooth skin a bite before soothing it with his tongue. Harry curls his fingers in Draco’s shirt and pulls on it, moving it out the way so that he can slide his other hand up Draco’s stomach. Draco shudders and grinds back against him, fisting one hand in Harry’s hair to ground himself. Harry bends down till he can lick a long stripe up Draco’s neck, chasing the taste of the vodka.
“Potter,” Draco sighed. He pinched the bridge of his nose, giving himself time to calm down before making a proposal he felt he might regret but seemed worth it.
He feels someone brush against his front, but without opening his eyes Draco knows it isn’t Harry. The touch is too hesitant, too shy. Harry doesn’t ask, he takes and that’s what makes Draco want to give in to him. Draco steps back, right into the arms of the man he’s been waiting for. Harry wastes no time in pulling Draco close, his hold on Draco’s waist almost bruising in just the right way. They stay like that for a moment, still in the centre of the moving crowd. Draco sighs and rests his head on Harry’s shoulder. Harry starts moving them to the music, his hips lined with Draco’s; there’s no mistaking how turned on Harry is as they sway to the music.
After one such impromptu meeting, Sprout had stopped Draco on his way out. They had spent over an hour going over his notes on the soil to fertiliser ratio for Mandrakes. She had hesitated a little and had asked Draco to grab a seat before asking if he was aware of the Herbology Institute. On hearing Draco’s unfamiliarity with it, she had filled him in. How it was one of the best schools for Herbologists interested in research. How each year she would recommend a student based on their abilities.
It was a very new feeling.
Harry laughs, already heading towards the kitchen.
“Yeah,” Harry continued, “we can explore the continent, maybe go farther?”
Malfoy looks, and Harry is
“I have absolutely no interest in making it a full time career,” Draco makes sure to mention. “I enjoy my research and alone time too much to quit over this of all things.”
Harry sputters, caught unawares by the sudden question. “I dunno, he was fine the last time I saw him.”
He’d spend his days drifting from room to room, finding himself growing uneasy staying within a space for too long. He knew it was probably in his head, but the very air in the Manor seemed to vibrate with hidden malevolence. Like the acts it had witnessed over the past few years had seeped into the very core of its magic.
Blaise’s smirk softens into a fond smile. “You’ve proved yourself, Draco, more than ten times over. I know I keep saying it but I mean it, don’t let this overtake your life.”
She’d suggested that he explore the different specialisations Hogwarts offered, and, having no valid counterargument besides he’d rather not, Draco found himself frequenting the greenhouses. Despite his misgivings, and his continued distaste for dirt, there was something oddly calming about the glass structures.
luxury I could never afford.
Maybe it’s time for him to up his reconnaissance skills.
Draco trips over a pair of Harry’s shoes, he can spot Harry’s clothes hanging in the closet and the pyjamas he’s wearing aren’t his. He expected this to feel more momentous, some sort of sign accompanying his life going from just revolving around Scorpius to also including Harry and Loki but at this moment, standing in Harry’s too-big pyjamas at the door to his bedroom, all Draco can feel is contentment.
Harry bites back the instant denial that springs to his lips. “Why do you think so?”
Harry chuckles and jumps to the side, narrowly missing Draco’s elbow. “I’ll hex your socks, don’t think I won’t,” Draco grumbles, walking to the stairway.
“It’s always something at work, Harry. Either you have to study or you need to have drinks with the Senior Aurors. There’s just always something else going on, but

They started with ice skating, and he doesn’t think he can ever forget the sight of Draco falling onto his arse throughout the day. He had been sure that Draco would be a pro at ice skating. After Draco had started complaining that his body could only take so much abuse, they had headed straight for hot chocolate before walking around the park, Scorpius and Loki enjoying the open space.
“Harry,” Draco calls softly, resting his hand against Harry’s cheek, a warm weight for Harry to lean against. HIs thumb gently brushes away the lone tear that managed to escape and he frowns, eyes filled with concern, “what’s wrong?”
Harry shrugs, fidgeting with the wrapping on his Chocolate Frog card. Dumbledore waves cheerily at him and Harry swallows the sudden lump in his throat. “Pity those who live without love,” that’s what the Prof. had said once and Harry doesn’t think he’s ever truly understood the meaning of those words till now.
"Malfoy!" Harry shouts, hoping Malfoy can hear him across the table.
Harry get’s pulled inside before he can finish his question. Within seconds Draco has him backed up against the closed door, one hand clenched tight in Harry’s jacket as he tries to get their bodies as close as possible. Within moments, Harry is panting, dinner and his nerves all forgotten as he kisses back with fervour, nipping on Draco’s bottom lip and rubbing a hand up and down his back, the wine bottle long dropped on the side table.
Harry peers into a shop as they pass by, the cashmere mufflers displayed at the window catching his eye. He makes a mental note to come back later, that shade of blue would really bring out the colour in Draco’s eyes.
“It’s from Pansy,” Draco explains, opening the package to reveal a box of Chocolate Frogs, that Draco hands to Scorpius with a stern reminder that he can only have one now, and a card.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Always the hero,” Draco whispers, his lips curling in a small smile, eyes filled with admiration, and Harry dares not to hope, and something close to fondness.
“Umm, yeah.” Harry coughs, aware that he’s been staring. Following onto the heels of that awareness comes the realisation that they’re still in the same position as they slept in. He blinks and tries to subtly move his arm from where it’s wedged under Malfoy, who apparently has different ideas as he rolls over and tucks himself into Harry’s side.
the same,” Draco nodded, “Sprout thinks we can supplement the daily sun time with moonlight along with a Growing Charm to boost their growth rate from three months down to six weeks.”
The next time he wakes up, Harry instantly knows he’s alone.
“We even have dinner together like Bill’s family!” he had exclaimed, his attention then entirely on Draco and Harry rather than his broom, showing
He looks up to see Mrs. Malfoy and Draco watching them with similar expressions of fondness, though he has a feeling that Draco’s look is aimed at both Harry and Scorpius.
“Come on,” Hermione calls, she’s quite a way down the street, smiling patiently as she waits for Harry to catch up. “We still have to get Christmas crackers and gifts for Molly and Arthur. And the puppy!”
“So, what’s going on between you and Malfoy?” Hermione asks Harry, eyeing the other man as he laughs along to something Luna says. Harry’s too focussed on how much younger Malfoy looks when he laughs, how he laughs a lot more around him.
As they Disapparate out of the club, leaving a crowd of turned on people behind them, Blaise smirks.
Harry closes the scant distance between them, hand reaching up to tangle in Draco’s hair as he brushes their lips together. They kiss slowly, basking in the warm sunlight till Harry gradually pulls away.
Besides, he
“I wanted to be.”
Harry nods encouragingly, feeling like they were finally making progress.
Based on the photo in the chapter.
Maybe it’s the tensing of his shoulders or the way he purses his lips but Harry doesn’t push it. He steals another quick kiss, smiling when Draco’s frown melts to a confused pout.
“Let’s have a snack?”
Where nothing much really happens.
“Good thing I’ve never cared about that, yeah?”
With a satisfying swoop he signs his name at the bottom and drops the quill.  Massaging the ache in his wrist he leans  back in a stretch that makes his chair squeak. Managing to get the scroll rolled and sent off with the nearest Ministry owl in a matter of minutes he quickly grabs his things, cursing when he tips over the now-dry plant he'd bought on a whim to brighten up the space. With only five minutes to spare he rushes to the lifts, sending a silent prayer to whoever is listening when he’s able to get onto the first one that stops on his level.
Malfoy winks and Harry’s lost in the reflection of the flames in Malfoy’s eyes.
With that he leaves, his pink, lacy robes trailing behind him in a manner strangely reminiscent of Prof Snape. And Harry can’t control his laughter anymore.
“I thought you were my best mate.”
The food is delicious and Harry makes sure to compliment Draco after every bite, smiling cheekily as he does so, before Draco shushes him by throwing a napkin at his head. It’s relaxed, no hint of tension in the air as they talk about their day and work.
“What if they never get along?”
His bubble of happiness bursts when he hears Blaise say, “Ten Galleons he doesn’t even dance with anybody else.”
, but Draco finds himself wanting to stay busy till he hears back from Harry or Emma.
It had been a pretty strenuous day but Harry loved every minute of it.
Draco steps back, out of Harry reach and tries to glare him into submission. He ends up cooing at Harry’s pitiful expression, his resolve weakening as Harry stares at him mournfully.
“Draco?”
Scorpius frowns. “How will you find that?”
My last thought before losing consciousness is looking up at Harry Potter’s worried face and wondering how I can thank him for freeing me.
Professor Sprout had been ecstatic the first time he’d managed to coax the Blue Barks to bloom, the finicky plants needing specific ratios of water to sunlight in order to survive. Sparse with her praise—all Draco had received was a pat on the back and a “Good going, lad,”—Sprout bombarded him with suggestions, but they were enough to make him feel like all the quick trips between classes to regulate the plant’s shade were worth it.
I don’t want to move, I want to fall down over him and cover his body, make sure we’re connected from head to toe.
Scorpius’s lower lip is trembling and Harry can’t take it.
“Do you have a minute?”
Harry wakes with a crick in his neck and the feeling of pins and needles in his left arm. He blinks blearily, the fire is no longer roaring but the residual heat is keeping the room warm, the muted light from the embers making it easier for him to adjust.
“Well,” Emma breaks the silence, smiling at Draco affectionately. “You aren’t getting rid of me that fast.”
Draco feels warm all the way down to his core. He would have never imagined meeting such kind people that he would actually want to stay in touch with.
“Most importantly, though, I’ve only just started going through Celestina’s papers,” Draco leans forward in excitement. “Harry, you have no idea the kinds of things she was working on! I can’t wait to get started on putting those into practice and actually testing her theories.”

Draco smiles softly. “We should have no problems with the next one then.”
“Hi,” Harry breathes, his emotions still reeling with the realisation that he wants
Sprout had been ecstatic at his acceptance, she had raved about the program and their areas of research for hours over their Floo call.
“The dragon!”
Based on the photo in the chapter.
Scorpius shrugs and throws the heart across the room.
Harry is out of his seat before he knows it, striding towards the bar with sure steps. He slips between Malfoy and the other man, leaning against the bar as he turns towards Malfoy.
“It’s Hermione’s spell,” Potter explained, using his wand to heighten the flames and then lower them to a simmer again. “I—” He paused, stealing a quick glance at Draco before continuing, “I noticed how the Warming Charm would ebb a bit when the winds were stronger. I first tried to find a way to fix the wall, but it’s too big of a repair that it would risk attracting attention. So, here you go.”
Harry glares.
kiss Draco good morning. He pulls Draco closer by his apron and leans in.
He glanced over and found Harry staring at what appeared to be a letter.
For Day#14 of the 25 Days of Harry and Draco Challenge at Slythindor100.
It’s on the inside that the name is proudly displayed,
Having slept barely four hours, Draco whines into his pillow, willing the incessant chiming of the Floo to stop. After it goes on for another minute and he can hear Milly knock, Draco pulls himself out of bed, stumbling against the nightstand. Pulling on a sweater, he makes his way down the stairs, just about managing to make it without falling over.
“So he was saying that because we can’t do magic like our parents, we’re all different, weird he said. His brother was telling him that one day, when he’s old enough, their parents will leave Bobby, make him live alone because no wants to be with a weirdo.”
They've definitely increased in frequency over the past year, she's gone from owning him about once a month to bringing it up at every other weekly dinner. Given the fact that he has yet to go beyond the first date with any of her picks he has a feeling it's become a bit of a personal challenge for her. He's okay going along with it for the most part, it's not like he's made much progress through his own efforts on the relationship front.

Most of all though, thank you. Anyone who ever commented, bookmarked this fic, subscribed to it or left a kudos - I'm sending

Still un-beta read and still filled with mistakes.
Scorpius laughs. “I know you! You’re in those books my Aunt Pansy gave me for my birthday.”
He’s been able to write off the lavender, leaving behind only hellebore and valerian root. That itself is enough for the Aurors at Forensics to start tracking down suppliers for those ingredients. It’s not much, but it’s a better understanding than where the team was before Draco joined.
"- you just had to make sure they got the fit just right", Harry finishes for him with a chuckle.
“I haven’t seen you out in the mornings recently,” Draco casually stated, settling down next to the welcome heat of the flame. He tried not to visibly react to Potter sitting down as well. At least he was across from him.
Harry wants to be anywhere but here, away from the hollow ache in his chest,
The not knowing had seemed less daunting then, when he was sure there would be someone with him. However, as Draco watched Harry go over the letter again, he could feel the uncertainty ready to rise and overwhelm him again.
The lift pauses at every other floor, witches and wizards getting on and off. With each subsequent stop the frown on Harry’s face deepens, the glances he shoots at his watch getting longer.
reach out and comfort Malfoy.
He starts to drift, warm and content in that space between sleep and consciousness . . .
“Scorpius is a squib.”
He is not ready for Draco’s answer.
“It’s a contraceptive potion?” Harry questions, expression stunned as he drags a hand through his hair and slumps over his chair.
Right before their lips meet, breaths mingling, Harry whispers, "I can't wait."
The periods of nausea have gotten longer than the periods without and the common potions he would take for a stomach bug haven’t worked. He’s trying to brief himself on a patient history while walking down the corridor. He’s half focussed on the scroll in his hands though, distracted by the ache in his lower back.
With a stroke of inspiration, Harry grabs his wand and fashions a bow out of parchment lying on the bedside table. With a quick wave of his wand he makes the bow float over to Draco till it settles daintily on his head, a little lopsided but still very pretty. As the gold font visible on the front of the bow sparkles a little in the light he realises he used one of the spare invites. It seems even more fitting now.
“This is for you,” he nudged the cauldron with his foot.
Harry pauses for a second. “I can drop him off with Mrs Weasley really quick, don’t worry.”
“Other boys?”
“Hi.” Harry smiles against Draco’s lips, one hand working it’s way under Draco’s shirt to,
“Harry,” the child cries, wiggling till he’s leaning out of Harry’s hold, stretched towards Draco. “I want!”
(See the end of the chapter for
"No, I mean," Harry stammers, "I have a ring!" He pulls the box out from his pocket, the other arm holding tighter onto Draco lest he tries to get away.
"Then when?" Harry tries again. He's not sure if he really wants to see the photo or if he just wants to keep talking to Malfoy. This Malfoy, who is so different from what he was expecting. In his Muggle jeans and smartly pressed sweater, with an air of vulnerability around him that Harry isn't used to seeing, Malfoy looks approachable in a way he never has before.
“I suggested it?”
“I also don’t like Teddy.”
So tired ~ I hope everyone is having a great week!
Scorpius smiles and nods, too overwhelmed for words. It’s permission for Harry to stand, take the ring out of his pocket and kneel in front of Draco, who hasn’t said a word yet, his eyes bright with tears of joy.
When Draco gently pushes him to take more toys, he stubbornly refuses. He wants to leave them there so he can play with Milly and Zeb next time.
Despite the shiver wracking his frame—less from the cold and more from the wand aimed directly at him, he suspected— Draco stood tall.
Harry coughs lightly, drawing Draco’s attention. Just before they’re about to turn onto the street with the Apparition point, Harry grabs Draco’s arm, making him stop.
Harry grins fondly, hopelessly enamored by this man who enjoys badgering his tailor and refurbishing old armchairs and acts like planning such a thoughtful gift isn't a big deal.
“I don’t understand,” Harry says, blinking confusedly. He looks tired, dark circles under his eyes, exhaustion etched in every feature of his face.
Before he knew it, Draco was running, a sinking sensation threatening to overtake him as he watched Potter sway where he stood.
“Malfoy!”
“Oh,” Draco said, momentarily speechless before years of having manners drilled into him paid off. “You’re welcome.”
Teddy looks up at his name, distracted. The watering can swerve and almost sprays water everywhere, but Zeb takes hold of it in time.
“Yes,” Harry says, adding hesitantly. “If you want to be. Big families are fun, so many people who love you and want to take care of you. That’s what your Father and I want, for you and Teddy so that both of you are never alone.”
For Day#6 of the 25 Days of Harry and Draco Challenge at Slythindor100.
“Well,” Draco says, he’s clearly trying to hold back a smile, “looks like your date is here.” With a cheeky wave he turns, calling over to the child, “Come, Scorpius.”
"Please?"

“I’m serious, go out with me. Tomorrow.”
What matters is that after days of wondering about it he finally knows how Malfoy tastes. He can count Malfoy’s ribs under his fingers, feel the softness of his hair, leave bruises on that skin.
It happens gradually, over the course of a few weeks.
“Pat it in like this,” Draco shows him, watching as Teddy lightly pats the soil into the plant bed, looking up at Draco for approval after. At his nod, Teddy lights up, eagerly thrusting his palm out for more.
Harry turns to find a wizard walking towards them. With neatly trimmed brown hair and a bright smile, he’s certainly attractive. He also looks
Harry chuckles as Draco wraps an arm around Albus and pulls him back just as he’s about to slip off and fall. “No, we didn’t. But we did manage to find where they are.”
Still un-beta read and still filled with mistakes.
“Eyes up here, Potter.” Draco’s smirking but he doesn’t miss the excited sparkle in Harry’s eyes, enough to make him grin satisfactorily at being the reason for it.
Draco rolls his eyes fondly but makes no moves to take it off. He lets Harry grab his hand and tug till he's reclining against the pillows and Draco is leaning on him.
“That’s a matter of perspective, Malfoy.” Harry is struck by the amount of self loathing in Malfoy’s eyes, the wry humor that he twists to mock himself. “And of course the Wizengamot saw something in you too, it doesn’t matter how persuasive Kingsley was, they can be quite forceful when they want to be.”
Harry watches on in shock as Draco fondly brushes snow off the little boy’s, Scorpius’s, coat. They hold hands as they walk away, the little boy skipping along as Draco walks slowly to match his pace.
Draco scoffed. “This is research.”
would be a good time to leave a comment and let me know.
It’s amazing how that little family has burrowed their place into his heart, he can’t begin to imagine life without them.
He had always been pretty ambivalent towards Herbology. The thought of mucking about in dirt wasn’t really appealing, but he could appreciate the effects growing patterns had on herb potency in potion making. Being short of a N.E.W.T. subject, Draco figured Herbology would be an easier pick than History of Magic at least.
As one, they turn to Ron, who is yet to say a word.
“I’ll have the Blitz Banshee and I think Malfoy would like a Hangover Horntail?” He asks, giving the bartender the order when Malfoy shrugs.
“Some other day, perhaps, your friends are getting impatient,” Draco smirks over Ron’s incessant knocking. Harry tamps down the flare of irritation he feels at his best friend’s ill timed arrival.
“Absolutely.”
“Yeah, Scorp.”
Harry wakes up on the floor, Hermione kneeling next to him while the rest of his friends alternate between looking at him and at Draco. He groans, standing up with Ron’s help.
left behind when they rushed to open the door.”
Harry gulps, straightens his tie and stands. He lightly clinks his knife against his wine glass, drawing everyone’s attention to himself.
Potter jolted. “No ‘m okay,” he tried to explain, struggling weakly against Draco’s hold before giving up, “No hospital wing. Please.”
Most days all he wanted to do was to leave, go back to his room at Hogwarts, find Harry lounging on that ratty sofa and curl into him to feel warm again.
They finally make it to the end of the corridor, in front of an inconspicuous door with a potted ficus next to it. There’s a shiny plaque on the other side of the door.
The shed catches his eye again, still as desolate as the day he brought the property and Harry wonders if he can convert it to a workroom of sorts. He’s been toying with an idea for ages, snippets of memories from a time in school before Hogwarts, precious moments free from Dudley and his friends that he would spend in the art and crafts room.
, to touch, to kiss his way down Draco’s neck take in his fill of that intoxicating scent that leaves him light headed with wanting.
“Oh, Scorpius.” Harry throws caution to the wind and gathers Scorpius onto his lap, wanting nothing more than to comfort him. “Your Father loves you very
Harry mock salutes. “Glad to be of service, Malfoy.”
Bottles of champagne are flowing all around and they are soon being hugged by everyone in the room, but throughout it all, Draco and Harry don’t let go of each other’s hand.
Draco sounds like he’s reading out from a script, voice carefully devoid of emotion. It makes Harry shift uneasily in his seat, aware that he’s touched upon something a lot deeper.
day stuck just with Malfoy. Okay, whenever they’ve been paired with each other in the past they’ve worked quite well together but… seriously...again?
under his feet, Draco almost turned back at the bite in the wind. The real winter chill was here, the cold inching underneath all his layers to settle on his skin, goosebumps erupting up and down his arms. The decision was made for him, though, when he spotted the hazy figure of Potter by the lake shore.
“Yes,” Malfoy says, his voice faint as he steps into the kitchen with the empty plates, Harry follows behind him with the remaining dishes. He leans against the counter as Malfoy continues, “I’ve enjoyed cooking since I was a child, I would beg my mother to let the house elves teach me how to cook.”
Mrs. Weasley, the head of the family, not all the other, numerous, Mrs. Weasley’s, has hugged him more than once, thanking him for the pie he bought, cooing over Scorpius and trying her best to make him feel welcome. Draco doesn’t have the heart to tell her that he has a thing about people other than Scorpius, Harry or his mother touching him.
"Well", Draco starts, coughs lightly as he finally looks up at Harry before quickly going back to pull at a stray thread in their blanket, "it's not anything new though. Just something I had laying around."
Draco relaxes slightly and lets go, falling back against the wall, “When did you get so smart?”
“Did you know I’m still under probation?” Malfoy asks. Only his eyes and hair peek out from above the blanket and Harry is stunned by the sudden urge to brush back Malfoy’s hair from his face.
His bafflement must be apparent for the man to speak up, extending a hand for Harry to shake. “Dave Holland? I work with Hermione, we met at her party last month.”
“Alright,” Harry says, loud enough to drown out the steadily increasing voices, “one at a time. Come on, let’s go sit with Father.” He herds them towards Draco; Albus clambers onto his father’s lap, while Scorpius waits patiently for Harry to lift him onto his lap.
Harry’s feelings about his acquaintances were made abundantly clear any time either of them were brought up. Draco knew Harry didn’t mean it as a remark on him personally, but it still felt that way.
After moaning, cursing and crying about it Harry finds himself trekking through an unknown forest with a stoic Malfoy by his side, who only opens his mouth to lament about the state of his shoes and his disregard for this entire exercise.
“Hi.” Harry smiles up at Draco, their faces close enough that he can feel Draco’s warm breath on his lips.
“Wh -
Harry presses a kiss against his wrist, “Where else should I be?”
Harry shakes his head and goes back to finishing his essay, though it’s a little hard to with all the people laughing around him. He watches warily as Ron glares at the people sitting near them, the effect lost as everyone is too busy staring at the bright pink bow in Ron’s hair.
He takes a deep breath, as if steeling himself, before looking at Harry and saying, in a voice filled with hurt, “Scorpius won’t be going to Hogwarts.”
“Yes.” Draco is perplexed by Harry’s reaction. He realises they’re still standing by the counter, the cup of tea in Harry’s hand no longer steaming. He carefully places the cup on the counter before dragging Harry to the table. He’s not sure how to feel at the moment, he expected Harry to be either joyful like him or maybe, there was always a chance he would have a
“Malfoy?”
He’s having fun watching Ron and Seamus argue about the Canon’s chances in the upcoming match when something catches his eye. Malfoy is at the bar, standing a little apart from the rest of the crowd and he looks very uncomfortable. Harry frowns and looks for Luna, when he spots a man approach Malfoy, making the other take a few steps back, his posture rigid.
“I was wondering,” Harry hesitated, looking up at Draco. “How do you feel about travelling a bit?
“Tired already?”
After carefully stashing the significant pile of Teddy’s gifts under the tree, Draco makes his way up the stairs. A quick peek into Teddy’s room brings a fond smile to his face, chuckling at Harry’s inability to say no. As suspected, he enters his bedroom and spots not one, but
Here we are, the last chapter. :') It's such a bittersweet moment for me, on one hand I'm super proud that I managed to write every day for 25 days but I'm also going to miss this story.
brief summary but nods at him to continue.
All apprehensions vanish as he steps into the living room. Draco has spread blankets on the floor, so that they can spread out comfortably directly in front of the fire. There are pillows piled against the sofa so that they recline while facing the fire, a red chenille throw folded at the foot of the blanket nest.
“Promise?”
Potter looked embarrassed, playing with the ends of the same garish scarf he’d worn every morning. Getting a closer look at it, Draco realised that what he had assumed were little specks of random colours were actually tiny Snitches.
Harry sighs as he steps out of the Floo, ash falling around him as he shrugs off his outer robes. He’s too tired to be bothered with cleaning up right now, the ache of spending over eight hours on a stakeout beginning to take its toll. All he wants is a bath, hopefully he can convince his husband to give him one of those magical massages that make all stress and aches disappear. He’s just dropped his satchel by the coat stand when he hears a soft giggle, followed by his husband’s deep voice.
“I need to get this to Emma as soon as possible,” Draco says, giddy, trying to gather everything he needs to send.
Blaise gives her a hug. “Sadly, no. Today we’re making Draco accept reality.”
“I don’t think that will happen, I think once they see your Power Rangers backpack,

five year old is all but jumping where he stands, little feet itching to run upstairs to his room.
Winter holidays that year were, perhaps, Draco’s favourite from his entire time at Hogwarts. There were less than a handful of students staying behind, Draco and Potter included. They spent their days helping the Headmistress get some of the smaller repairs out of the way, and at night they retired to the room, which was now covered in festive decorations, complete with a little, stunted tree in one corner that Potter had explained, with flushed cheeks, he’d asked Hagrid to find him.
“Looks like the news will have to wait,” Draco muses, wondering if he should drop some food off at the office. He’s deliberately ignoring the feeling of relief at not having to have

He finds Scorpius sitting on his bed, a handcrafted fabric heart in his hand.
Harry takes one look at the mess that was once his bedroom, frowns and walks out.
Calmly, and with great effort, Ron closes his books and stands, making people laugh even harder as they get a full glimpse of his robes. With his head held high and cheeks as red his hair, Ron heads towards the library doors but not before leaving Harry with a message.
Harry shrugs exaggeratedly. “Well,” he says, dragging it out, “if you
“What?” Draco yawns, trying to drag the crying child to the sofa so he can ask what’s wrong. Harry doesn’t look panicked, just sleep deprived with a pillow crease on his cheek, so Draco doesn’t feel too concerned. So clearly Teddy isn’t in some sort of grave danger but who knows what goes on in the mind of
They will talk tomorrow morning, decide to discuss things before they are left to fester for too long and give birth to resentment but for now, they know, without shadow of a doubt, that they will always come back home, to each other.
“There’s another case?” he asks, going over the letter again. “Emma didn’t mention anything to me.”
Lol. I ended up writing a much longer chapter. Though, yes, chapters might get shorter now because I do need to start writing my college essays. They're due first week of Jan and I've put it off long enough.
“Hey,” Harry admonishes, letting go enough that he can look at Draco directly, “don’t. Stop. You can’t change the past any more than I can, but what we, I mean you,’ Harry corrects himself hastily,  “can do is to ensure that Scorpius get’s all the possible chances in life. This
Right-o, I hope that made sense!!
“Draco.” Harry smiles shyly. He doesn't look even half as surprised as Draco feels right now. “It’s nice to see you again.”
Scorpius scowls when he sees Harry but there’s no hiding his bloodshot eyes and the pitiful sniffling. Something inside Harry melts, the urge to wrap this little boy in his arms and to make everything better so strong that it almost brings tears to Harry’s eyes.
“Come on,” Harry tries, slipping his hand under Draco’s shirt to caress the smooth skin of his back. He slides his hand higher, taking the shirt with him, fluttering his fingers against Draco’s side till he’s squirming, trying not to laugh.
conversation just yet. It’s not that he’s scared of Harry leaving him, some facts are universal and Harry is anything but cruel. The reality though is that he and Harry have never discussed expanding their family, the topic of children just never came up. They’re comfortable in their life right now, enjoying each other's company as they build their careers. A baby would definitely change things but would that really be so bad?

It’s in the arboretum that he gets to see more of Teddy’s inquisitive side. They usually just spend time in the same parlour, Draco and Harry either working or chatting softly on the couch as they keep an eye on Teddy. One Sunday, however, Draco is busy monitoring the valerian root when they drop by. Harry seems apologetic, offering to come back another time, when Draco spots the curiosity in Teddy’s eyes.
“Hey! You had fun that night, don’t lie,” Harry teases him, “If I recall we got up to quite a bit of fun in the cloak room.”
Discussing homework questions once in a while soon turned into having full-blown conversations about everything and nothing. From song choices to who would sleep on the sofa—Potter, the gentlemen, forcing Draco to take it most days while he crashed on the carpet—they could talk about anything. While Draco was a little apprehensive about arguing with Potter and scaring him off, having gotten used to his presence, he was assured when, the night after a heated conversation about the right way to trim one's broomstick, Potter was back. Though he did bring with him a considerable pile of broom care books to prove his point, at least he was back.
Draco gasps in awe, making Harry look over. Teddy had been busy trying to water the mini flower pots Draco had put aside for him, but every time he tried to lift the child sized watering can one of the elves would rush over to help him.
The culprit is caught within the next week.
Halfway through his skincare routine his medicine cabinet chimes because of a helpful reminder charm that makes sure he takes his daily supplements on time. As he reaches for his daily potion he stops short, brow furrowed he takes in the two vials where they should be only one. Ignoring the rising panic, Draco thinks back to the morning before. He’s sure there’s probably a mistake in his spellwork, there’s
There’s a lingering hint of vanilla in the air from their late night combined shower, making Draco tut fondly as he gathers the robes strewn across the floor. Any other day and he would have made sure to dump the dirty robes on his sleeping husband as a reminder to clean up after himself. Today, however, he lets it go thinking of the longer hours Harry has been pulling to prepare for the Wizengamot getting ready to vote on his proposed bill.
Draco steeled himself.
“Sorry,” Harry stands there awkwardly as Draco dusts himself off. “I didn’t mean to startle you.”
“Thank you,” Draco breathes against his neck, his voice wet and hoarse.
Draco carefully helped Potter climb the stairs, shouldering the entrance gate open before guiding him inside.
Judging by Hermione’s self satisfied smile he has a feeling he isn’t fooling anyone.
Knowing there wasn’t much else he could attempt in terms of repair, Draco had found himself creating some semblance of a room within those damaged walls. While the side facing the corridor was still intact, the outer wall had been clearly hit by some sort of spell, a large chunk of it missing, creating a pseudo window of sorts between the two existing arched windows. A standard Shield Charm and enforced heating spells were enough to give the room some semblance of warmth. The extra cushions and spare blanket he smuggled from the Slytherin common room added to the strangely comforting atmosphere of the room.
with his tongue and Harry can actually feel his knees go a little weak, he decides to leave it to Draco to stop and let’s himself get lost in the moment.
“It’s from Pansy,” Draco explains, opening the package to reveal a box of Chocolate Frogs, that Draco hands to Scorpius with a stern reminder that he can only have one now, and a card.
“Well, yeah, I just wanted to know what it's like.’’ Harry pushed his glasses up to rub tiredly at his eyes. “My dad was an Auror, too,” he added softly.
I also experimented a little with the letters, I'm not entirely sure how well those work with the fic but I figured why not since I had some spare time.
“Come over this weekend,” Draco offers. “I’ll have them out for him to take his pick.”
“What about dogs?”
As they walk down the street, warm drinks in hand, Ron can’t help but frown at the niggling feeling of foreboding that’s building the closer they get to Harry’s house.
I will definitely try to re-use this photo prompt again!
not the one having to apologise to Hermione.
“No,” Malfoy says firmly. Harry wonders for a minute what he did wrong now when notices that Malfoy isn’t talking to him. He’s looking at Scorpius, who is staring at his father with the most beseeching expression, his eyes wide and pleading.
Teddy smiles up at him, his already messy blond hair even more rumpled now. To Harry’s constant chagrin, Teddy spends the majority of his time with hair like this, a mix of theirs, like he can’t pick which he preferred.
“Looks like the storm has finally slowed down.”
“Ow! What the fuck, Malfoy?” Harry snaps, rubbing his, now, stinging arm.
Malfoy wakes slowly, Harry coaxing him out of it till he’s blinking sleepily.
Draco watches as the guests raise their glass to him and drink, Hermione shooting him a pleased smile. The easy manner in which she dispenses affection towards him is still something Draco is getting used to, the awkward conversations with Weasley more comforting in their familiarity.

12th December, 2000
Harry wakes up the next morning to a surprise.
Draco’s confusion must have been apparent for Harry to subtly tilt his head towards Teddy’s backpack.
chapter.
They both go home feeling more complete than they have in a long while.
Harry bites his lip to keep his laughter inside, they’ve already entered Draco’s house. It’s just a matter of getting him to the bathroom.
Malfoy flushes and Harry curls his fingers around the cup he’s been handed, the temptation to reach out and touch is too strong.
“Anytime you want to.”
"Hi," Harry whispers.
“I should leave,” he suggests, his fidgeting fingers betraying his state of mind.
Had it been even a minute later Draco would have been fast asleep. As it is, he’s just barely awake enough to hear what Harry whispers against the back of his neck.
A week before his world turns upside down, Harry Potter was just an over-worked Auror, who had been sent on yet another mission without enough information to support him. Normally, he was okay with the fact that the Auror Department was, at the moment, severely  understaffed with the ongoing bout of Dragon Pox, which led to over-hours  and all in all just a whole lot of confusion.
He looks up to see Draco beckon him closer and he smiles, carrying in the tray of hot chocolate to cheers and laughter.
Draco brings Harry’s arm up to brush a kiss against the back of his hand before settling down again with Harry wrapped all around him. He’s warm and snug, Harry’s deep breaths pulling him closer and closer to sleep.
She’d sent him off after with a request to read up on the Institute and its programs when he had the chance. While he had nodded in agreement then, Draco soon forgot about it as the N.E.W.T.s crept closer.
“Potter,” Malfoy groans, “what I’m saying is that I’m not here to bother anyone. If it makes any difference, I’m probably more uncomfortable than anyone else in this room.”
If they really are going to grab a meal together might as well start calling each other by their first names. The alternative feels too much like regressing back to his teenage years. He’s been trying to do less of that these days.
it reminds him of.
Harry’s words die in his throat as he takes in Draco’s appearance. They’ve been playing in the snow for an hour or so and the bitter wind caused a flush to stain Draco’s cheeks, wisps of hair peeking out from beneath the wool cap that Molly had insisted on knitting for him. Even dressed in all these layers, and there really are too many layers, Harry wonders how Draco ever survived the Hogwarts’ winters, he can’t help but rake his eyes over Draco’s body.
Hermione set him up on a blind date with
Harry frowns. “Is this because of the war? Because if it is, I’m going to have a talk with Prof. Mcgonagall. We didn’t suffer through that just to live in a world filled with discrimination.”
“You mean he’s going to stay at home till he’s thirty?”
that he wanted to get too close to those ferocious creatures.
Whatever she was about to say next is cut off by the sound of the door opening with a bang.
"Yes, well . . . " Draco starts as he finally turns to face Harry. Whatever he was about to say next is lost as he takes in the open box on the bed and Harry's sheepish expression.
He’s shed his outer coat and rolled up his sleeves by the time the sun is at its peak, the temperature charms doing their work by diminishing the direct heat of the noonday sun. Deep in thought, Draco misses the faint knock on the glass door, the sound of leaves crunching underfoot and the unmistakable shuffle of sneakers on dirt.
Some Christmas shenanigans.
Draco stared at him in disbelief.
“Sounds amazing,” Harry offers.
They’ve met them individually. In a way Draco had an advantage because he’s met Teddy before, during his mother’s mandatory Thursday lunches with her sister. His meeting with Teddy went without a hitch.
“Draco.” Harry warns, aware of Ron’s red face and clenched fists. “Enough.”
He’s cut off by Draco, the hurried
“Come now, Scorpius, we need to get going.”
“To Draco,” Harry raises his glass, his eyes twinkling as he watches Draco flush in surprise, “for being the
It starts with an innocuous training exercise. A
“I used to have nightmares about it.”
“Will there be other people there?”
Draco blinks.
He’s taking in the changes when he spots a man walking towards him, the cheery smile on his face making Draco smile back politely.
“Grimmauld Place,” he called, impatiently tapping his fingers on the grate. The Floo chimed, once, twice before dying out.
“Bathroom. Now.”
“I am. Kingsley had to make a request to the Wizengamot to make them allow me to enter the Auror Training. They were quite against it, to be honest and I don’t blame them, but Kingsley was adamant and he made them give me a chance.”
They’re not friends. They’re barely acquaintances. Granted, they’re acquaintances that drink together every week and also always sit next to each other at the bar and Harry still doesn’t know how Malfoy has better alcohol tolerance than him but
He barely resists the urge to bang his head on the table.
Like going back home with Malfoy.
Harry walks slowly towards the Gryffindor table, aware of Hermione’s eyes on him as she warily watches him approach her boyfriend. Harry quietly takes his seat next to Ron, albeit a little farther than he usually sits, and reaches for the flagon of pumpkin juice. He almost breathes a sigh of relief when five minutes pass and Ron hasn’t said anything to him,
“I know you have questions,” Malfoy starts, breaking Harry out of his thoughts, “and even though I don’t really need to answer them, I want to, if only because you stepped up and helped me during the trials.” Before Harry can protest that Malfoy doesn’t need to tell him anything just because of
“Sure, why not?”
“As the rain,” Harry quips, fighting back the urge to cheer. He’s glad he didn’t think this through, he feels
Draco tries to take another bite of his chicken but gives up instantly when he starts to feel queasy. As he helps Teddy clear the table, making sure the child isn’t trying to handle the heavier plates like he once did, Draco wonders if he’s coming down with a stomach bug. It would explain the random bouts of nausea and exhaustion.
Harry keeps wiping down the counters and doesn’t look up at Malfoy. He knows the man needs some time and honestly, he’s in no hurry for Malfoy to leave.
Harry trails off as Malfoy smacks his lips in his sleep, his pale eyelashes trembling against his cheek as he dreams. He tells himself it’s not creepy if he’s only looking to make sure that Malfoy isn’t having a nightmare.
Draco strides across the kitchen to gently take the package from the owl’s leg. Scorpius is jumping up and down next to him, obviously excited to see the owl.
taking suggestion for puppy names! :)
“Potion.” Harry repeats.
It’s Harry’s turn to ask Draco out and this time he has something really special planned.
“Where are we going?”
Draco though, Draco understands and with a kiss against his Harry’s cheek he wraps Harry up in his arms and takes his weight, lets him lean on someone else for once.
“Like the view?”
Based on the photo in the chapter.
Draco yawns as he slowly walks down the corridor to check on Teddy. The house is awash with sunlight, the warm rays peeking through the curtains to brighten up the space. They ended up sleeping in longer than they usually do, even for a weekend, the late night catching up with them.
“I’m always a good boy, Granny,” Teddy giggles, jumping up to hug her waist. He scampers up the stairs, making sure to shout “I love you” before running around the corridor.
Prompt for the week: "Let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure."
Draco sighs. “Oh dear, is it too late to get a refund?”
(See the end of the chapter for
It’s magical.
He puts down his book and stands up, tugging Draco with him. Wrapping an arm around Draco’s waist, he waits till Draco relaxes into his hold. The room is dark, save for the light from the fireplace which lends a warm glow to the ambience.
“So, umm,” Hermione starts, reluctant to interrupt, “what happened?”
He misses the look shared between Ron and Hermione as he makes for the door. Malfoy is waiting for him outside, leaning against the wall opposite the pub entrance. He looks nervous, scuffing his boot against the ground as he refuses to make eye contact. Harry’s chest clenches, an ache building as he worries about what Malfoy might say.
“So, expect to see me tomorrow!” Potter smiled, obviously attempting to go for cheerful optimism, but he only came across as slightly unhinged. “Some days tiring myself out does help, so it’s my best bet for now.”
When Harry had first suggested the idea of a combined holiday, looking all shy and bashful as he blushed throughout, Draco had been apprehensive. And also a little excited.
“What about birds?”
“I am in your family?”
“I’m moving to France.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Malfoy laughs. “I can’t believe I’m even thinking about it.”
Malfoy doesn’t look up from the book he’s reading, one of the many he’s been poring over since they uncovered the reason behind all the magical fluctuations, but Harry can see the tenseness in his shoulders finally relax a little.
“Drop by the Manor on Saturday, around noon.”
“Papa,” Scorpius whispers to Malfoy,making a great show of turning away from Harry so that he doesn’t hear. “What is the word when two people live side by side? The one that Grandma used yesterday.”
“I knew you would be best friends in no time!”
“My father's funeral was the day after the trials. Taking yours and all other testimonies and evidence in consideration, I was lucky enough to get a relatively short sentence. Only six months in Azkaban and then I was a free man.”
Still un-beta read and still filled with mistakes.
“Is that so,” Harry says, bending to pick up snow. He can see Malfoy doing the same across from him and there’s a strange joy in being so carefree, in seeing Malfoy laugh uninhibitedly.
Draco strides across the kitchen to gently take the package from the owl’s leg. Scorpius is jumping up and down next to him, obviously excited to see the owl.
Harry smiles and ruffles Scorpius’s hair as he enters, asking as he takes off his coat, “Where is your daddy?”
Scorpius deliberately looks at Harry and winks, his face set in a supposedly encouraging smile.
He’s shaken out of his musings by the feel of Harry’s foot nudging against his. He looks up to find Harry looking at him, an eyebrow arched in question. Draco shakes his head, grabbing his wine glass to take a big sip. Harry in this light is a reminder of all the changes he wasn’t here for. The soft light from the candles highlights the sharp slope of his jaw. It’s very distracting.
Thank you for reading and commenting!
Draco laughs delightedly, before he asks, “Scared, Potter?”
Malfoy starts, “Potter you don’t have t-”
“Sorry, sorry.” Someone rushes into the room, the door clanging shut behind them. “Traffic was brutal and
!” Draco gasps, biting his lip to hide his smile.
Draco leaned down just as Harry rose up, meeting each other in the middle.
The moment he steps through the doors to Fierté, Draco feels himself relax. As it’s Friday night, the club is certainly more crowded than other nights, but Draco knows that compared to the other clubs out there, it’s not even half filled. Fierté is very selective with its members; given its proximity to the Ministry and Diagon Alley it’s meant solely for wizards and witches.
Potter refuses to cooperate, whining and throwing up in the alley behind the bar. Draco watches, amused, as Potter shakes his head and performs a breath clearing and sobering charm on himself.
"There's your bow," Harry smiles, carefully placing the box beside the bed.
brewed Calming Draught in a vial and casts the spell on it. He waits with bated breath as the spell works, waiting for it to either change colour to indicate potency of the contaminant or stay the same.
By the time they reached the classroom, Draco had broken into a sweat, growing nervous with Potter’s continued silence. He’d resorted to keeping up a running commentary as they walked, talking about anything he could think of. The house-elves in the kitchens and how they’d finally stopped trying to stuff extra pastries in his robes, the potions essay he’d been struggling with, and even the story of how he got his first broom. Though, with the last one, he gave up halfway through because thinking of his family wasn’t something he actively did these days.
He waits it out, watching Draco and Teddy argue about the snowman’s looks outside. He’s broken out of his thoughts by a sniffle. The sight of Scorpius crying, big grey eyes blinking back tears as his bottom lip trembles, makes Harry’s heart melt.
Draco sighs, turning over to face Harry.
Before Harry can leave, Draco calls out, "Blaise is free to babysit Scorpius on Friday. If you're available for dinner? I still need to make up for skipping out on you last time." He looks nervous, fidgeting with his sleeve as waits for Harry to reply.
!), Draco heads into the kitchen to get started on dinner. It’s not his forte, Harry is definitely better at whipping things up, but Draco wants to surprise him for once.
“Let’s go!” Draco shouts to Blaise over the music, he leans over the bar and grabs a bottle of vodka, making sure the bartender adds it to his tab before linking his arm with Blaise and dragging him to the dance floor.
Harry pulls on his gloves as he thinks over Ron’s question.
What had been surprising was Ron’s reaction, or more aptly the complete
Five times Scorpius was confused and one times he wasn't!
so he’d bite his words and keep walking.
It happens on a Wednesday, about five weeks since his return. Draco carefully places some of the

with his tongue and Harry can actually feel his knees go a little weak, he decides to leave it to Draco to stop and let’s himself get lost in the moment.
Everly leads the way, dodging overflowing carts filled with scrolls of varying sizes being slowly pulled by Ministry elves. There are memos zooming above them, a constant traffic of paper that swoops along the roof, veering and dodging collisions with ease.
Draco nods but Harry can see the fear on his face. He’s got a tight grip on Harry’s t shirt, blinking up at him through tears.
“Harry!” Scorpius calls out, waving wildly as they wait for Harry to catch up to them.
By the time he reaches the pub, pushing through the crowd around the door, he’s almost got his emotions under control. He knows Draco will already be panicking enough for both of them, he needs to be the calm one today.
He swung the door open and stared in confusion at Potter, standing before him with a cauldron in one hand, the other hand raised as if to knock again.
Where Draco and Harry finally talks. Or Draco talks and Harry listens.
I could mark him all day long. And for all his complaining, I know he enjoys it. I’ve seen him reach out to trace the outline of a bruise under his shirt when he thinks no one's looking. But I always am and this has led to us to christening almost every loo in the Ministry. He always leaves with more marks than before.
Still un-beta read and still filled with mistakes.
“And I know you’ll still be here even after four hours. I have to be up early, the Minister leaves for Ukraine tomorrow and I need to brief him before he leaves.”
“He didn’t sleep much, woke me up after barely two hours,” Harry explains, bringing the blanket from the sofa to wrap around Teddy. “I’m sorry, I’ll take him back in a bit.”
“No, I
Draco's voice makes Harry jolt, dropping the photo in his hand. He looks up just as Draco bursts through the door, carrying his suit in one hand, just as Harry had suspected.
“I got a letter from the Institute a few days ago,” Draco starts, playing with the tassels on the blanket. “They offered me a promotion to lecturer if I go back and said they’d even fund all of my research as opposed to the insulting fifty percent they were offering earlier.”
He waits, wanting Harry to understand that he was against breaking the rules. Harry runs a hand through Scorpius hair and prompts him gently,  “Go on.”
Harry blinks, stunned.
Last day for any puppy name suggestions. ♥
“Scorpius Malfoy, I consider myself to be the luckiest man on earth because I got the opportunity to watch you grow into a kind and loving boy, who stands up for what is right. Will you do me the honour of giving me permission to marry your father? To become a permanent part of your lives?”
Harry can feel Hermione’s letter glaring at him from his personal notice board where he’d distractedly tacked it on yesterday. Pinned on between an old map of London and a month old pile of bills he needs to get reimbursed, he had placed it hoping that having it front and centre would make sure he doesn't forget.
Occasionally he would find himself wandering down to the Lake in the early morning, the sight of Potter exercising in the frigid air invoking an odd sense of sympathy in Draco. He was there every morning, wrapped up in layers and running, no matter how low the temperatures dropped, and that made Draco want to do
“To be fair, it is hilarious how ridiculously bad you are at it.”
“Shh,” Harry assures him, moving closer till he can pull Malfoy against his chest. “I’m here, go to sleep.”
Malfoy looks up, smiles and Harry’s gone.
Harry leans into his touch, letting out a sigh as he takes in Draco’s explanation.
“I had no one with me, no one to provide the magical support needed.”
Everly laughs. “Well, the point we’re at right now, your research and expertise is exactly what we need.” He gestures for Draco to get onto the lift ahead of him, following behind and dragging the metal gates closed.
“Now come on,” Draco calls, standing and pulling Scorpius up with him. “There’s a piece of chocolate cake waiting in the kitchen for a special little boy.”
Harry gestures for Malfoy to go first, he doesn’t know what to say  anyway.
Harry sits by his side and leans down to kiss his forehead, lingering for a few seconds just to breathe.
Harry reaches across the pillows to brush back Draco’s hair, leaning over a slumbering Teddy to give Draco a kiss goodnight.
Scorpius giggles. “No! He not serious!”
Harry rolls his eyes and nudges Hermione forward, the league of his nameless puppy’s admirers was growing by the day.  Harry can’t take him for a walk without being stopped multiple times on the way so that people can pet and coo at the puppy.
“Don’t be fooled Potter,” Malfoy teases, the playful smirk replacing the worried frown. “Underneath this goody-two-shoes act, I’m still as evil as ever.”
“Sure,” he acquiesces with a grin, “you forgot to take the potion because of me.”
“I don’t think so.”
that he wants to always love and protect this little boy.
For Day#16 of the 25 Days of Harry and Draco Challenge at Slythindor100.
The sixth floor was still unused, the reduced student count allowing for sections of the castle to be sealed off in anticipation of repairs. As part of the eighth-year team working closely on the restoration of the most damaged parts of Hogwarts, Draco was closely aware of which sections were abandoned.
It’s only when he’s back in the waiting room, that Harry feels the emotions overwhelm him and he all but falls onto the seat next to Ron’s, letting his best friend take his weight. The next thirty two minutes are the longest of his life as he alternates between pacing the room and hugging the life out of his friends. When Healer Walsh  enters the room, Harry sobs in relief as the man walks up to him and says, “You can go see them now. Draco is still sleeping but your sons are waiting to meet you.”
Harry blinks, confused, till he sees Scorpius waving at the owl. Ah.
ALSO! I've reached the end of my imagination so for the remaining four chapters I'm open to requests for any scene you might want to see between Harry, Draco and Scorpius! ♥
Draco takes in a deep breath once Harry leaves and decides to clear out the rest of his things later.
He marches the other man down the hall, heading straight for the bathroom he’d spotted earlier while taking in the lay of the house. There’s only a fireplace in the house and that’s where Harry plans to sleep. As the tub fills with water, he helps Malfoy undress, ignoring his protests as it’s clear that Malfoy’s fingers are too frozen to unbutton his shirt.
“It’s completely okay to want to wait longer to tell your husband that you’re having a baby.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry chuckles and toes the puppy away from his chair, where the little fellow had been trying, unsuccessfully, to chew the leg off.
As soon as Scorpius settles into the tub, the bubbles making him laugh, he gasps and turns to Harry with a frown.
“Really?” Scorpius asks eagerly.
They walk Scorpius to school, Draco forcing his tears back as Scorpius heads inside the class cautiously, a young man in a bowtie bending down to shake hands with him and show him where to put his bag. Within minutes Scorpius is playing with two boys across the room, each of them pretending to be a Power Ranger.
He just wasn’t sure when it would start being not enough.
Without waiting for a reply he turned on his heel and marched back to the castle, back straight and head held high. He could feel Potter’s gaze on him even as he climbed the stairs to the Entrance Hall.
Teddy does indeed wake up at five, managing to hold off for fifteen minutes before he’s shaking Harry and Draco awake. They stumble down the stairs, half asleep, holding onto each other in case they slip.
Maybe it has to do with the way the curtains are fluttering slightly in the windows, making the moonlight cast shadows along Draco’s lean back. The sheets are bundled near the foot of the bed, the night too warm to even consider covering up, or even wearing clothes.
So the week was his job, his sole focus and attention on ensuring that he did his work to the best of his capabilities. The Malfoy name had been greatly tarnished after the end of the war, and if he had to keep aside his personal life for most of the week to build a solid reputation as a hardworking man, then so be it.
Harry looks at his boys jumping up and down in front of him, shooting question after question.
“Those are just leftover lavender I’m harvesting for mother,” Draco explains, pausing to offer Teddy a “Good job. Try the next one”.
Dave is nice, easy to talk to. Harry can see why Hermione thought this might work. Despite his best efforts to pay attention to the man in front of him, Harry can’t help but think back to the moment in the park.
It starts with a nightmare.
makes everything better.
“Blaise!” he bites out, batting away Blaise’s offered hand as he tries to climb to his feet, “How many fucking times have we been over this?”
He startled so bad that he almost dropped the wireless, fumbling with the device to get a grip on it before placing it carefully on the window ledge. He fixed his robes, debating whether he should take his wand before deciding against it since he couldn’t use it against someone without violating the terms of his sentence.
For Day#9 of the 25 Days of Harry and Draco Challenge at Slythindor100.
He’s starting to think that’s true.
He has a child in his arms, a toddler with hair just like Malfoy’s, who is leaning sleeping against the man carrying him, a thumb in his mouth. They head out of the room as Harry watches.
Instead he tightens his hold on Harry’s hair and tilts his head, moving forward till their lips brush. Harry still has one hand on Draco’s waist, his fingers digging in just enough to tease. Draco wants more; he’s tired of these games. He feels like he’s been waiting since the morning, since he rolled out of Harry’s bed.
Even Longbottom had managed to offer up a nod, more than he’d allowed Draco since the first time they’d come across each other in the greenhouses.
“I got it.”
Draco moves wearily through the living room, brushing the soot off his outer robes and dropping his satchel on the couch. He can’t even muster the energy to be tidy right now, there’s a nervous energy thrumming right under his skin and it’s all he can think of right now.
Harry had tried hard to reason with him, refusing to accept what was right in front of him. Draco could somewhat empathise. Harry hadn’t been the one to spend day after day waiting for a single moment of recognition from the other. To him, this was a total surprise.
He’s unaware of the snow falling softly around him, living in this neighbourhood is going to be more interesting than he had thought.
Scorpius frowns thoughtfully, mulling it over.
Now technically, Draco has always known that, but it’s one thing to know about it and another to experience it. They are at the Burrow, and Draco doesn’t even make a single joke about the name, the lopsided, homely house decorated by all manners of fairy lights, making it a big, flashing structure.
“I think we’re doing okay with him,” Harry comments, smiling against Draco’s hair.
“That’s not fair, Draco. You
Harry smiles sheepishly. “I should have sent an owl asking if you’re still available.”
It was only once Draco was satisfied with the authenticity of the cauldron and had levitated it over so it was situated closer to the couch, that he decided to speak up.
He takes the time to look around the room, it’s nice, cosy, Malfoy clearly hasn’t followed the same decor theme followed at Malfoy Manor, it’s quite a stark contrast. The sofas are comfy, deep grey with red and gold cushions (and Harry
Harry waits as Draco collects his thoughts. Without realising it, they’ve moved closer, Draco’s head on Harry’s shoulder while Harry still has an arm around his waist.
Harry blinks, stunned, before whooping ecstatically.
Harry feels
“Fine,” Malfoy grumbles, caving under Harry’s stare. “You’re right. I’m just going to head home then.”
Where Ron feels like he's betraying his mother and Harry is in for a surprise.
“Draco and Scorpius will be down in a minute, we can wait in the living room if you want.”
“Oh,” Draco breathes out, his eyes dazed as he tries to find the source of the interruption. Before Harry can point Draco in the right direction, or kiss him again because he looks sinful with his kiss swollen lips and flushed cheeks, Scorpus runs in with Loki right behind him.
His analysis of the potions sample Emma sent him is enough to help him narrow down the possible culprits to four standard ingredients—hellebore, valerian root, lavender and porcupine quills.
Of course they couldn’t exactly keep it hidden forever.
Thank you FrankyOh for suggesting the name! :) *hugs*
Harry manages to light the fire, open a bottle of wine and light some candles. Even though the electricity isn’t on and there seems to be little in the way of food besides crackers, it’s enough for them to spend the night and wait for the storm to die out. Apparating is out of the question in weather like this and he feels exhausted, neither conditions conducive to a safe Apparation.
Albus is the first to spot him, shrieking “Daddy!” before running up to him. Scorpius follows behind, hanging onto Harry’s other arm.
With a slight smile, Harry nods. One day, he whispers more than says out loud. Judging by the light flush of color on his cheeks, he knows Malfoy heard him.
For Day#18 of the 25 Days of Harry and Draco Challenge at Slythindor100.
“How would freaking out right now solve anything?” Harry asks him, tugging the covers back.
“He’s only five.”
“I told you to dress carefully.”
So armed with a tin of his blueberry lemon cookies, Harry Potter walks up the stairs to Draco Malfoy’s house, his face set in a determined, slightly forced, smile.
It’s as he’s walking up the snow covered steps that lead to his front door that he hears the sound of a child’s laughter from the house next to his. He only looks that way to take in the beautiful decorations around the house but what he sees makes him freeze on the spot.
With a smile and wave Malfoy is gone, his steps lighter.
“And we’ll all do that next Sunday, you know he’s nervous about his role as the Nutcracker in his class play. Alan’s father is directing it this year and he said he would Alan and Scorpius rehearse their lines.”
“Thanks. It’s been pretty great so far.”  Harry trails off. As the silence grows, he mentally curses Hermione.
“Does this mean that Harry will make me lemon blueberry cupcakes everyday?”
Nothing makes or breaks a relationship like a meeting between the kids.
Draco spends hours in there, inspecting, cataloguing and marvelling over the diversity of plant life. There’s a work shed towards the back, housing tools that were more commonly preferred about a hundred years ago, the only items in this space that give away its age. Located right under the dome is an elevated platform, rising above the treeline. There are steps right under it to lead the way up, the wood lightly scuffed in places showing frequent use. The messy piles of books and rolls of parchment burying the surface of the lone table are tempting; Draco is eager to learn more about the place and its secrets.
“Malfoy, it’s been a while.”
“Uh huh.” Harry laughs, turning onto his side to face Malfoy, “I’m onto your nefarious act to steal all the blankets.”
Their relationship was still new, in the stage where everything was bright and there was nothing wrong with the world. And after six months of dating, it was a given that they needed to merge their worlds in a way or another.
Harry sighs, letting Draco pull him closer till he’s leaning against him, finally letting go.
I do have some ideas for little one shots in this verse that I hope to write once I'm done with all my college apps. And once I fix up this fic, I know it's filled with errors.
“Yeah, I do. But it doesn’t hurt to have someone at your back, right?”
This time Harry is the one who is late, Hermione waiting for him patiently at the street corner. It’s a lovely winter day, snow covering the streets and trees. Big Ben frames the sky across from the them as they start walking towards the little building tucked between two pubs, no sign on the red door they walk through.
“And me.”
“That was horrible,” Draco cackles, finally giving in and rounding the table so that he straddle Harry’s lap.
“She said she wanted it to be a surprise.” Draco smirks, watching Harry frown indignantly.
“Why?”
“But we just got here,” Draco whines.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I never used to believe in luck, words like destiny and fate held no meaning for me, and yet, when I look back to where I was three years ago, to the day, and were I am today, I can’t help but start to believe in some higher power. I can’t find any other possible explanation for the turn my life took, for the family I have today.”
I still remember the pride on Father’s face, his only heir already wanting to follow in his footsteps.
“Why? It’s a Saturday. Lemme sleep,” he murmurs, trying to slide under the covers. If he can’t see Malfoy then he probably isn’t here.
For now though, he only hoots softly at Draco before going back to his treats.
Two years in at the place where it started, Harry enters the club with his head held high and eyes already seeking the form he knows as well as his own body. Hot, sweaty, loud,
“Let me take it,” Harry offers, already grabbing the papers and vial and placing them in a bag he Transfigures from a spare apron. “It’ll be faster than sending it by owl.”
“I was wondering, why did you quit the Auror Trainee Program?”
“Huh.”
“Never,” Draco says from the door, tears running down his cheek.
I run the fingers of one hand along his cleft and rake my nails down his thigh with the other. His hole twitches every time I pass my fingers over it and I’m at the end of my restraint. My prick throbs as I move against the bed, hoping to relieve the tension enough that I focus all my attention on Draco.
anything else you'd like to see, feel free to drop it in the comments!
I wait until he settles down before letting out the breath I was holding. If I didn’t know any better, I’d say he was awake and was doing this to rile me up. But Draco sleeps like the dead and nothing short of a full marching band can wake him when he’s like this.
A huge thank you from the bottom of my heart to everyone that read and commented - wether it was just once or on every chapter! You kept me motivated to keep going even when it felt really exhausting to write a chapter every single day. ♥ Sincerely, thank you!
“Right this way.”
Keeping my head down and concentrating on the dull swoosh of the broom, counting down the days till I can step out of this building and never look back.
“- because what that was last night,” Ron continues over Harry’s protests, “Was not poker. It was strip poker, Harry.
“Fine,
The wind picks up speed around them, the rustling of the leaves filling in the silent gaps. Draco stands there, surprised, lost for words as Harry continues.
It’s still good to hear Draco call him that.
It takes a few more minutes, enough time for his boys outside to get the snowman’s body ready.
Draco’s heart aches for his little boy but he’s been a mess all morning, awake since 4 am, making sure everything is ready for Scorpius. Harry had taken one look at Draco’s red eyes and tear streaked face before he had decided it’s best if he gets Scorpius dressed for his first day of school. Draco waits outside Scorpius’s bedroom, one hand resting on the doorframe as he watches Harry tie the little boy’s shoes.
“My boyfriend, the eternal optimist.” Draco rolls his eyes, his lips quirked in a smile as he waits for Harry’s reaction.
He can’t find it in himself to care because now he knows the breathy sighs that leaves Malfoy’s lips as Harry leans over him on the bed, he can recall the sight of Malfoy biting on his lower lip as Harry enters him, he can feel the drag of nails down his back.
And yet, everything feels different.
“I’m sure we can progress from last names now,” Harry suggests, crossing his fingers under the table. “Besides, isn’t it confusing for Scorpius?”
“Hannah really has changed the place,” Harry comments, twisting in his seat to take in all the decorations. The real eye catcher though is the tree in the middle of the room, a tree made of empty wine bottles, the fairy lights making the bottles glow and casting soft shadows around the room.
Scorpius carefully sprinkles icing sugar over the latest batch of Christmas cookies he helped Harry bake. Loki is sitting next to him, patiently waiting for his best friend to slip him another cookie while Harry is distracted.
“It’s -”
that he’s thought about it, at all. And if Harry tells himself that it’s only innocent curiosity that makes him want to learn more about Malfoy, then, well, there’s no one to tell him otherwise.
For Day#20 of the
“Hey buddy.”
“They’re never going to bed now.”
Love tastes like Harry.
He’s busy the week after, assisting the DMLE with certain cases that require him to go in everyday. He’s still looking for his purpose, something to do now that his life is no longer planned out for him. It’s been five years and Harry still feels lost, waiting for a sign to point him in the right direction. While Ron is happy as an Auror, Harry is content to work as a consultant, offering advice when needed by staying away otherwise.
And we're done!
“Blaise,” Draco warns him, his voice calm, “if you don’t put me down right now, the Zabini line might end with you.”
Harry groaned dramatically, falling onto the carpet and pouting up at Draco.
“You’re serious,” Malfoy breathes.
Draco bites his lip and resists the urge to fidget. “I’m pregnant. We’re having a baby, in about seven months or so, hopefully. I just, umm, I only found out recently,” he rambles, getting more and more nervous as Harry says nothing, “and that too purely by chance you would think being a Healer I would know what’s going on with my body but it took me ages to figure out what the exhaustion and nausea was caused by and wow -”
Harry nods, aware that Malfoy must be feeling vulnerable with all the rehashing of his past he just did. Harry feels grateful, humbled that Draco trusts him enough to let him in.
As a result, when Harry asked if Draco would like to accompany him and his friends to Hogsmeade for lunch, he refused. “It would be the perfect chance to finally tell them about us,” Harry would reason with a stubborn Draco, who remained unconvinced.
It appears Muggle, there are no wards protecting it, only an electric alarm that’s easy to dismantle. Harry marches in, paying no heed to Malfoy, who seems conflicted for reasons Harry can’t, and doesn’t want to fathom.
he would be having such thoughts.
“No.”
“Malfoy, listen -”
~*~*~*~
Harry ducks his head to hide his smile.
Draco found himself fascinated, leaning forward to take a closer look at the brightly flickering flame. It looked normal, except for the unusual purple edges and the fact that it was burning steadily without any wood, tethered to the cauldron.
“I see where Teddy gets his brattiness from.”
He knows Scorpius seems okay with it for now but there will be questions in the future; luckily, Draco knows he won’t be alone, Harry will be there with him to guide Scorpius.
They get to St. Mungo’s in record time, Draco’s wince more pronounced with each contraction. Thankfully, the Healer is waiting for them, ready to sign them in.
As the Patronus fades away, Harry rushes to the door, only to double back when he realises he’s shirtless.
The second time they meet,
He looks so proud of himself, slightly chubby cheeks flushed, with a red knit cap on his head and still holding onto his father’s hand. He’s
Seeing her reminds Harry that he still hasn’t mentioned Malfoy to Ron or Hermione. Something he needs to fix, he knows, but what can he say when he still knows next to nothing.
There, right in front of him, is what appears to be an arboretum.
The one where Harry thinks he is the master of espionage.
“Potter,” the Director chides, turning to Draco with an apologetic expression. “This is Mr Potter, our Deputy Director and Expert on Spell Tracking.”

“I’m trying to find the optimum amount of moonlight needed to get a Pillfreg seed to sprout.”
Malfoy has Harry set the table while he finishes up the cooking and Harry follows along; mostly because thinking too much about the surreality of the situation had started giving him a headache.
. There’s no reason I can’t have both. Maybe this makes me a pervert who gets hard on seeing his boyfriend sleep, but it’s not my fault. Draco shouldn’t be allowed to look so pretty as he sleeps.
Prompt for the week: "It is our choices that show us who we truly are, far more than our abilities."
He turns to Teddy, who is already looking at him shyly, one hand tugging a belt loop on his smart little green shorts.
Harry blinks, confused for a second, before he remembers the conversation a few days ago.
“Hey you,” Harry greets him, sliding the drink over once he spots the scowl on Draco’s face. To his surprise Draco nudges the glass away, opting to move his seat next to Harry’s and lean against him.
“Did Ron say anything last night?”
Based on the picture prompt within the story. Still not beta-read. Still written for the "25 days of Harry and Draco challenge" at Slythindor100.
Love tastes like the smell of roses in full bloom in the Manor gardens, like the sound of Mother’s laughter, like the first snowflake.
Scorpius tackles him with a laugh, climbing onto his lap and tucking himself in Harry’s arms.
Albus snorts and leans back against Draco’s chest. “Boring.”
Instead, Harry has taken over the role.
“I don’t know,” Harry muses, following Draco into the bathroom, “you are a
“Okay, so he’ll stay at home and basically have no life, if it’s up to you, neither of which has anything to do with why you’re sulking.”
The fourth morning was the coldest, and for some reason Draco found himself more restless than before. He’d tried all of his usual tricks to calm down, even attempting some of the meditation tricks as he’d been advised by the Ministry-appointed Healer he was required to communicate with as part of his sentence, but nothing was helping. Frustrated and a little exhausted, he found himself heading towards the lake before he could make up his mind. By the time he was halfway there, he figured he might as well go all the way—the worst case scenario was that it could be someone from his year and he’d be forced to attempt some form of interaction. Not that most people responded to his attempts, but Draco didn’t want to give anyone a chance to say he wasn’t doing his bit to integrate himself with those at Hogwarts.
“I’m pregnant,” he murmurs the words like a secret against Harry’s lips.
It had been after Harry had tucked Teddy into bed, in his room at the Manor, that he finally brought up the one thing he had been agonising over for the past few months. Draco managed to beat him to the punch though, almost shouting,
“What if nobody wants to be my friend?”
Malfoy smiles and places the tin carefully by his side. “Thanks, these are Scorpius’s favorite.”

I dig my fingers into his cheeks and use my thumbs to spread them apart, finally giving me a close up view of his arsehole. I wasn’t easy on him the night before and I can see that in the redness around the ring. It makes my cock ache with the need to fuck him again, to feel him clench and be so fucking tight around my prick, but there’ll be time for that later.
“Draco?”
Later, after consuming breakfast, which Harry doesn’t remember much of because Draco had his foot pressed against Harry’s the entire time, Harry asks Draco what Pansy sent him.
Draco sniffles, shaking his head again.
He turns left, the fresh layer of snow crunching under his boots. Hermione had mentioned his date would be along the central path that runs clear across the park. Harry frowns as he recalls how oddly secretive she had been about the date, forgoing her usual detailed brief for a cryptic, “You’ll see.” All he had to go on was that this mysterious man would be in a blue wool coat.
Before Harry can answer, Draco calmly takes a seat next to Hermione and says, “Untwist you knickers, Weasley. So what if we saw how deep your love for your favourite Quidditich team runs? Trust me, it was worse for us than it was for you, nobody wants to see that much orange.”
Harry, Ron and Hermione get a chance to catch up!
“Oh, Harry.” Draco kisses Harry, pouring all of his love and feelings into that one kiss. “I love you, not the idea of some wedding that my mother has you convinced I once had. My dream wedding doesn’t have to be in some fancy vineyard, with imported roses. I’m happy getting married in our backyard, as long as you’re there standing next to me and Scorpius is with us.”
~*~*~*~
“How could this happen to me?”
As he started walking towards him, Draco frowned as he realised the other boy wasn’t running like he usually did. He seemed to be walking slowly, back hunched over. Before Draco could react Potter stumbled, almost tilting over before managing to catch himself at the last minute.
Draco smiles, taking the seat offered and settling down next to her.
Draco hugs him tighter, burying his face in Harry’s hair.

are getting too old for the shenanigans like last night. Thinking of the night before and the kisses pressed against his back as he arched towards Harry’s body, Draco smirks.
Still un-beta read and still filled with mistakes.
Harry, on the other hand, blinks, stunned. They haven’t really defined their relationship, honestly, Harry hasn’t felt the need to.
“I haven’t laughed this much in ages,” Malfoy whispers next to him. Harry leans up on an elbow and takes in Malfoy’s flushed cheeks and wide smile.
He laughs nervously, trailing off when Draco doesn’t join in. He looks tenser than before, his shoulders hunched and fingers curled around the edge of the counter.
Malfoy fidgets with the sleeves on his sweater, with his hair falling on his face and they way he’s biting his lip, he looks like the teenager who had stood across from him in courtroom nine as Harry testified in his support.
“Those six months in Azkaban were a nightmare, even though the Dementors were long gone, in a place so steeped in darkness the imprint remains. It was only thoughts of getting out in six months, unlike some people who had sentenced for life, that helped me through that period.”
brought it within reach, Draco grabbing it in mid-air to blink through sleep-heavy eyes at the messy scribble.
“You like buying him gifts and you’ve said it yourself, he loves making sure you’re comfortable. When not at work, you’re with him and don’t forget that time I walked in on the two of you cuddling; cuddling, Draco. You don’t cuddle with a fuck buddy.”
"It's the best gift anyone has ever given me," Harry says, hoping Draco does not doubt how sincere his words are. "Thank you," he adds, pressing a quick kiss against Draco's palm.
Draco sits on the stairs the entire night, waiting for the front door to open and for Harry to walk in. Around three he startles awake, the door closing softly behind Harry.
As the months went by he found himself spending more and more time among the plants, finding a penchant for regulating and growing some of the tougher plants needed for potion making. It was oddly cathartic, a connection to a form of magic he’d spent his formative years perfecting, yet different enough that he didn’t feel the familiar pangs of pain he felt while brewing.
As he stepped onto the grounds at the cheery hour of six am, the frost

As Scorpius has fun icing the new cookies, Harry looks out the window at the falling snow and waits for Draco to come pick Scorpius up.
“Do I at least have enough time to clear out my things?”
Still un-beta read and still filled with mistakes.
Harry has an idea and Scorpius has a new friend.

Things don't really go the way Harry planned but it still feels like a step forward.
His retort is lost as the child huffs, settling back against Harry’s chest with a pout, his hair turning the exact silver-blond as Draco’s.
trying to give him all the hints it could.
“Definitely not too old yet.”
“You know that makes it even messier than usual.”
Malfoy bends till he can speak in his son’s ear, “Neighbours.”
Harry’s caught by the look of hopelessness that flashes across Draco’s face, his eyes filled with self loathing as he explains.
Harry flushes, aware that he was ready to jump instantly into action, but the thought of Scorpius being subject to discrimination for something he hasn’t done makes his temper rise and his heart clench with protectiveness.
Hermione’s smirk makes Harry swallow nervously. His belated, “I don’t know what you mean,” is weak, even to his ears.
Blaise looks away innocently, moving aside some papers on Draco’s desk before hopping onto it. Draco barely, barely, resists the urge to hex Blaise; he has better ways of making Blaise pay. Tripping over the arm of the chair and almost falling down again, Draco stands up, brushing off his coat with dignity while glaring at Blaise.
The puppy jumps and stumbles back at the knock on his front door.
“If Harry comes with you, then Loki will be left all alone,” Draco answers for him.
who asked for some variation of Harry moving in, them living together, meeting the Weasley's and Scorpius's first day of school.
“Hey,” Harry says firmly, waiting till Scorpius is looking at him. “If you’re angry about something, use your words, we don’t go around throwing things in this house. Is that clear?”
Before he can ponder any further, Harry grabs the dishes from his hand with a quick peck to his cheek.
“Harry,” Draco whispers, their breaths misting as he closes the distance between them. “I need to apologise, too. I was wrong to place all the fault solely on your shoulders and just
Draco rolls his eyes at Harry, but he makes sure to sway his hips as he walks to the bathtub, waiting till Harry has scooted back to climb in. He settles in front of Harry, back to his chest, and sighs in contentment as Harry wraps an arm around his waist and pulls him closer.
He’s only human and the lure of spending more time against Malfoy underneath a pile of blankets is just too hard to resist.
Draco smiles. "I wish I had had time to wrap it up all pretty in a bow." He gives the top of the box a pitiful nudge. Harry pulls the box away from him, holding it protectively on his lap and giving Draco a mock glare.
“I don’t know,” he replies, his voice calm enough to make his Father proud.
Based on the photo in the chapter.
“Thanks! I’m glad you suggested the park, had we decided on a place further away I would have been in real trouble,” Harry chuckles.
“Not really,” he sighs. “I need to get to the Manor and get things set up.”
For Day#10 of the 25 Days of Harry and Draco Challenge at Slythindor100.
Harry makes space for him on the bed, Scorpius sandwiched between them.
“Get undressed,” Draco calls over his back, rolling his eyes at Harry’s brightened expression. “For a

“Yes, me and my son. He’s staying over with my mother tonight, they had plans to decorate the tree in the Manor.”

Harry steps out of his seat and kneels in front of Scorpius, who has been conveniently seated right next to him, and across from Draco.
“Huh?”

Draco tries to get a word in to defend himself but Blaise doesn’t let him, clearly enjoying the chance to show Draco how wrong he is. The witch isn’t even hiding her curiosity now, she’s openly listening in, nodding along to what Blaise is saying.

“I asked you enjoy cooking too?”
He still had his moments of doubt. The thought of uprooting himself and moving all the way across the world was terrifying.
Maximus stares at him.
Draco snorts. “What did you think it was?”
“I would have been anything you needed me to be if you had asked.”
All it takes is a simple test. Even as he waits for the potion to work, he already knows the truth deep down. He can’t believe he didn’t realise it sooner, his body was

He knows they should stop soon, Scorpius can walk in any minute and Harry isn’t sure just how much he knows about Draco and his relationship. But it’s so easy to get lost in the kiss, especially when Draco is doing that

“For the record,” Draco whispers, “he thinks you’ve hung the moon and the stars.”

As Harry watches Draco fondly argue with the boys, a nightly ritual, he thinks back to the day they first met after the end of the war.

At Draco’s door they swap their weight, Scorpius blinking blearily up at Harry before falling asleep again, while Loki merely snuffles and settles his nose into the crook of Harry’s elbow.
“I’ll think about it. I don’t need to decide right now, I guess,” Harry mused, moving back to sorting through the rest of the pile.
Super short chapter today, sorry! I was
Malfoy picks up the puppy follows Harry into the kitchen. Before Malfoy can comment on the state of his kitchen, Harry explains, “I had a little trouble while baking today.”
Draco expected him to leave right after. Potter lingered instead. Even as Draco squatted next to the cauldron and shot spell after spell to check for hidden charms and hexes, the other stayed. At one point, when Draco had exhausted his repertoire of defensive spells, he suggested a few more. He even helped Draco with the wandwork.
Within seconds I can feel my bollocks tightening, my thighs tensing as I push forward with a sharp thrust into the heat of his body. I come with a moan, gripping his waist tight as I keep myself buried in his arse. My arms are shaking and I can feel the pain shoot up my shoulders but I’m not ready to let go yet.
Harry waits patiently, no hint of nervousness on his face. Harry’s return into his life also, inevitably, brought back a lot of old memories. While they feel like bittersweet moments from a time long past, what strikes Draco the most out of those memories is how much
As the days speed towards winter, Draco finds himself reaching for an Invigoration Draught by midday. Barely five hours into work, Draco feels his energy flagging. It’s the most baffling thing because as soon as he reaches home, around the time he puts his things away, there’s a spike in his spirits that leaves him feeling re-energized. Blaming it on his body adjusting to the chill in the mornings and the late nights spent in the study while Harry pours over the proposal, Draco adjusts to the new normal as Halloween rolls around.

kicking him out . . . ).
Harry finds a new friend and Draco is impervious to Scorpius's puppy eyes.
He does though, he does catch the words, feel them pressed against his skin.
Malfoy had shown the room and then walked out the door, muttering about “meddlesome Gryffindors” and “pain in my arse”. He’s not sure if he should keep waiting or just leave his biscuits here and go.
Draco sighed, he grabbed a dressing gown and made his way downstairs. He walked into the sitting room to find Harry sprawled on an armchair. He looked
A minute before the fire can consume them, Draco Malfoy is ready to give up, he can’t move, can’t see, feel, breathe anything other than the fire.
It’s nearing eleven pm, and night has truly fallen. The path is illuminated by streetlights, the faint dusting of snow glimmering in the light. They walk together in comfortable silence, Draco still going over Everly's question.
“How’s the neighbourhood? Met your neighbours yet?”
“I like the birdie,” Teddy giggles, sniffling a bit. “He’s pretty.”
Rather than trudging around the Manor grounds, he pulls out the old house blueprints. Grabbing his second cup of tea for the day, he leans over the massive scroll, squinting at some of the smaller writing along the grounds. The original layout of the Manor and its property is pretty much the same as the day it was constructed; the only things that have been added are the ridiculously ornate statues and fountains by his great-grandmother.
They hold on to each other that night, each helping the other keep the nightmares at bay.
The conversation dims slightly, Emma shooting Everly a chiding look even as Draco studiously avoids looking at Harry.
“I wanted to apologise.”
Based on the photo in the chapter.
“Those are just for fun.” He gently placed those under the sun.
“That’s true,” the witch adds.
“Of course not,” Potter explained with an affronted expression. “I told you I wouldn’t tell anyone about it!”
He didn’t find any mention of it in any of the family journals, poring over each at night to find an explanation for its existence. He’s busy from the moment the sun rises, starting with checking the conditions from the night before to then researching possible hybrid combinations to test.
“Sleep now,” he says, patting Harry’s chest, “it’s still dark outside.”
“Fine,
It was Potter. Though the other was quite bundled up against the cold—a thick scarf wrapped around his neck covered most of his face—the glasses and messy, windswept hair were dead giveaways. Despite the chill in the air, Draco could see he was sweating, his breathing laboured and loud in the otherwise silent morning.
Taking a shaky breath, Draco brings a hand down to his stomach. He can’t bring himself to touch just yet, palm hovering over his abdomen. He’s a shaky, nervous mess when he finally brings his hand down. It shouldn’t feel any different at all, he knows this logically and as a qualified Healer.
fall asleep there,” Potter explained. “Too many people,” he added on softly, looking away in embarrassment.
training exercise.  Truth be told, Harry’s been waiting for a chance to finally step out into the field and actually use all the defensive and offensive spells they have been reading about for a long time.
It takes Harry five minutes to realise that Malfoy looks like he’s about to have a panic attack.
“Don’t worry,” Harry says confidently, “I’m sure you’ll get the owl this week. With your marks and the recommendation from the and Slughorn, I have no doubt you’ll get in.”
Everly holds the door open for Draco, inviting him in with a smile. The office itself, in typical Ministry fashion, is a lot larger on the inside than it appears on the outside. There are two corridors that branch off from the main entrance, three doors running down each. At the end of the first corridor is what appears to be a glass conference room, Draco can spot three people seated inside.
“Mrs. Adams was so so so mad at Robbie,” he babbles excitedly, the spoon in his hand forgotten as he shares his day with Harry. Draco watches on in amusement, gently guiding Teddy’s spoon to his mouth so he actually eats something. He ignores how he himself can’t seem to summon the appetite to finish his meal.
Draco sighed. “Come with me.”
Still un-beta read and still filled with mistakes.
Harry rolls his eyes but plays along, “What?”
Before he knew it, it was time to go. With one last look at the sprawling gardens outside, the months of effort he put into them, Draco set the final ward on the Manor and Disapparated.
managed to make Draco laugh a few times.
Draco scowls and steps up to Disapparate to the club.
“What do you mean?” Draco sits up at that, frowning as he looks over at Harry who is staring right at him. “We talked about this!”
The second time, Scorpius resolutely ignores Harry’s attempts to colour with him.
“I’m sorry?”
They have their sandwiches in the sunroom, Teddy regaling Draco with tales from day-care. He’s never heard Teddy talk this much, at least to him, and he’s awed at being allowed this glimpse into Teddy’s personality.
Based on the photo in the chapter.o
“Ron, don’t shout!” Hermione admonishes, making Harry chuckle.
,” he warns, “no waking me up before seven. We aren’t opening gifts till eight.”
“Well, if you must know,” Malfoy starts and clears his throat. Harry thinks he actually looks adorable with the flush staining his cheeks. A second later he thinks that maybe the wine had gone bad because there’s no other reason
“Oh, Mr. Potter, you dropped this . . “
Teddy wiggles a bit, finally speaking up, but it gets muffled by Draco’s sweater.
Harry’s cut off as Emma comes to get them for dinner. Draco shoots him a questioning look, wondering what Harry was about to say.
Draco moves closer till he's almost laying on Harry. It's warm, and Harry's sure his right leg is close to losing all feeling having been in one position for so long. He doesn't care though, dragging a hand softly up Draco's side till he can curve his palm around Draco's waist and pull him even closer.
When all he gets is an arched brow in return, Harry wonders if he's managed to royally fuck up just a day before one of the most important days of his life.
“Octavius!”
are never a priority.”
Draco can only nod, shaking Harry’s hand. His grip feels different too, calluses where there were none before.
“Well,” Draco started, clearing his throat nervously. “This was fun. Carry on.”
, he knows that it’s important they work together because he can’t take care of the curse at Hogwarts alone but there’s just something so satisfying about needling Malfoy.
They talked twice a week, each Floo call shorter than the last as Harry struggled to stay awake. Draco was finding it harder each time to keep the resentment he felt at bay, that Harry picked something that was keeping him so occupied while Draco struggled to find tasks to keep himself busy.
Later, when Harry wakes, Draco passes him a cup of tea and asks, “Don’t you think it’s time to put your house on rent?”
Harry looks up from the paper, Scorpius is sitting with the puppy, both of them tumbling around on the plush carpet. He lowers his paper, realising that he really does still have to name the puppy.
It’s towards that room that Everly starts walking, casually explaining how the Office is structured across different sub-departments, with the Field Agents using this corridor while the Lab has the entire other space.
I graciously accept all snowballs you wish you hurl at me for this filler chapter. *takes cover* I'm sorry! I have relatives over and they've been here all day.
Potter leans close to him, close enough that Draco can see the scratches on the lenses of his glasses.
And so on it goes, Harry constantly trying and Scorpius rebuffing him.
“We’re having a baby.”
Harry shrugs off his outer coat, wincing at the rain of soot that gathers at his feet. No matter how many times he travels by Floo it's never going to be his favorite mode of transport. Sometimes, however, like today, it's faster to just Floo from his office than to walk all the way to the Ministry apparition point.
Based on the photo in the chapter.
It’s paralysing and all I can do is pray that no one notices how scared I am.
Harry sat up, staring at Draco. “Excuse me?”
Harry huffs and waits till Hermione’s caught up with him before walking towards the road that leads to The Leaky.
“Well, well, well, what do we have here?”
They go on the date that night, and Harry finds himself falling just a little bit further. They’re still ribbed at by their friends, everyone mocking just how
They’re back outside again, enjoying the last few days of unpolluted snow when Harry notices that Scorpius isn’t out with them. With a quick kiss on Draco’s cheek, Harry heads inside, wondering what new form of torture Scorpius would subject him to. He’s definitely a Malfoy, Harry thinks, chuckling to himself, his tantrums have been downright devious and he stops dead in his tracks.
Harry can feel the heat creeping up his cheeks and he hopes Hermione thinks it’s because of the cold and not because he can’t stop thinking about how Draco had looked in the bathroom. How much he had wanted to lean in and kiss him.
The day Draco got the letter inviting him to work for the Ministry’s Department of Records and Documentation as a Restoration Expert, he had decided that he needed to set his priorities straight. He had worked hard to get this job, gotten a degree in restoration and archiving, interned under the Prof. who had led some of the major excavations in Egypt and then spent a further six months working for minimum wage to get a feel for the department.
“I found it!” Scorpius says, smiling ecstatically as he runs up to Harry and the puppy.
“The whole team should be in today,” Everly chats as they walk, the Office of Forensics seemingly located right at the end of the floor. “They’ve all been quite eager to meet you.”
Draco stopped reading, ignoring the formalities listed to stare back at Harry. He could feel a slow, rolling wave of panic simmering just under the surface, making it difficult for him to think.
Teddy’s energy carries over after dinner, it’s closer to midnight than he would like by the time Draco ducks under the covers. He curls his feet appreciatively, the warm sheets welcome after the brief chill that settled in after their shower. Harry is by the dresser, toweling his hair aggressively till he gives up and uses his wand to blast it with hot hair.
“Gotta go, I have to, uh, clean my house. Yeah. See you ‘Mione.”
“Okay.”
” he reads aloud, tracking along with the instructions with his pointer finger. Sparing a sideways glance at the clumpy mixture in the pot, Draco groans in frustration.
"Are you mad?"
And yet, as he thinks over his answer, his mind flashes back to the dinner two nights ago.
Trying to be stealthy by using a wandless charm, Harry manages to snag the camera without Draco looking over. He's not too confident in handling it though and the loud whirring of the film is what finally grabs Draco's attention. It's just as he's looking over, eyes bright with a shy smile in place that Harry gets the hang of it. Click. Draco blinks in surprise, eyes creasing into a teasing smile as he places his cup on the windowsill and all but saunters over to the bed.
He doesn’t stay back to hear Harry’s answer, stepping onto the open lift and swiftly shutting the door. When he finally looks out, Harry is still standing there.
He throws his head back and moves to the music, waiting for Harry to get to him. The beat is louder and faster now; sweeping him away as he lets his body move to it. It’s hot, hot enough that Draco’s gasping for breath within minutes and without thinking he raises the vodka bottle and overturns it on his head. The chilled alcohol slides down his neck, making him shiver in relief. He knows the people around him are probably getting a good show, with his shirt now soaked and sticking to his chest.
Milly and Zeb are busy collecting all the draped sheets. Draco helps by using his wand to arrange and move around the furniture till he’s satisfied. He’s not sure how long he’s here for, but he refuses to live just as he did the last time he was home.
The weekend is there before he knows it.
Ron waits patiently as Hermione explains her order to the barista, his wife’s precise instructions on the amount of cream and sugar to be added making him smile fondly. He had initially been extremely reluctant to visit a Muggle establishment that “makes the best coffee ever, Ron!”
Except, Malfoy is a prat.
Draco nods, tightening the hold on his bag as a team of Aurors runs past them. The uniform makes him nervous, less for what it signifies and more for what it reminds him of. Or more specifically,
He’s in the training room, peeling off his sweaty t-shirt when Hermione’s Patronus appears, making him jump back and knock his shoulder against his locker.
Draco looks stunned. He laughs wetly, reaching up to wipe away the tears.
Harry smirks at the cover showing mistletoe twigs tied together by a red ribbon with the words “Let make out” underneath.
The words have barely left his mouth before Harry’s turning them on the spot.
He hadn’t felt that way in so long.
He’s muttering to himself, cookie in hand as he flips pages to find something he can throw together with the limited time he has. He’s lost in thought, chewing mindlessly when arms wrap around his waist. It’s a good thing he catches a whiff of Harry’s aftershave, his hand already wrapped around his wand, ready to react as he gets startled.
“Harry?
Unlike then though, he's not sure where he's going to come out at the other end.
“Question time is over, it’s time for bed now,” Draco says, getting ready to stand. Within seconds the room is filled with twin protests, both boys loudly proclaiming their displeasure.
I itch to reach out and touch, to feel his skin beneath my palms, to spread him open and see evidence of a few hours ago; to see him twitch and yearn for more.
“And we will be there to support him no matter what.”
, lumps under the covers.
Harry and Hermione go Christmas shopping!
His feet ache and he swears that Scorpius is getting heavier with every step but Harry can’t recall having had so much fun before.
“Um.” He clears his throat, herding Harry towards the door to the sunroom. “Let’s head in.”
Teddy is still a little shy in front of Draco, opting for one-line answers and preferring to hide behind Harry or try to get the elves to play with him. Draco tries to tell himself it’s okay—he’s never been too fond of kids to start with—but a part of him wants Teddy to like him, to be as playful with him as he is with Harry.
“Why didn’t you come back?” Harry asks softly.
“Ah,” Draco exclaims, “of course, whatever you want to read.”
The unrestrained joy on Teddy’s face and the sturdy warmth across his back from Harry’s chest is worth facing the early morning. They are, after all, his favourite parts of the day.
He’s lost in thoughts of tucking his head into the crook of Malfoy’s neck, if the skin would be warm and smell of vanilla that he generally catches a whiff  of would be stronger there, when he hears a whimper. Malfoy is frowning in his sleep, his fingers twitching and without thinking Harry moves closer. He places one hand on Malfoy’s cheek, rubbing his thumb over the bruised skin under his eyes while he holds onto Malfoy’s hand with the other.
Draco, to his credit, tries to smile and says, “Hullo, Granger and Weasley.”
They reach Draco’s house faster than Harry likes.
Draco shakes his head and takes a long swig from the vodka bottle, enjoying the burn of the alcohol down his throat. He licks his lip, catching a stray drop of vodka. He looks up to see at least three people staring at his lips. He smirks and bites his lips, relishing the undisguised looks of want aimed at him. He has no intention of pulling anyone tonight, contrary to what Blaise and Pansy think, Draco is an idiot but he knows when he’s being a fool and the only person he wants to spend the night with is the one he woke up with this morning.
___________________
Malfoy doesn’t answer and Harry ignores the fact that they sit closer together than before.
Harry brings Teddy by in the evenings, saying it's good for him to tire himself out before bed. Unlike the first time Harry always sends an owl beforehand, waiting for Draco to confirm his availability before dropping by.
Malfoy sighs.
Draco nods, and with Ron’s help, Harry gets him standing. Draco’s leaning mostly on him and Harry wraps an arm around his waist to steady him. Seamus and Hermione walk ahead, clearing a path through the typical Friday night pub crowd. Ron and Luna bring up the rear, carrying everyone’s bags and coats.
Ron and Harry run across someone in Diagon Alley!
Harry nods eagerly, not aware of just how much he missed the little boy.
Harry is willing to spend his entire life making sure Draco knows how much he’s loved.
(See the end of the chapter for
Teddy whines, trying to plead his case for how opening gifts at six is perfectly reasonable, but he’s out like a light within minutes.
Potter hummed sleepily. Within seconds he was snoring softly, making Draco frown and debate whether or not a Silencing Spell would be going overboard.
Finally, with a nip at the swell where his arse starts curving, I can focus all my attention on the place I’ve been waiting to taste the most. I carefully move his leg a little further, making just enough space for me to lie down between his legs and get comfortable. I have no intentions of moving for a while.
Scorpius runs out of the room and Harry is ready for Draco, already pulling him close with an arm around his waist.
With a laugh, Draco spins around in Harry’s hold and hooks his arms around Harry’s neck. Even with the confetti in his dishevelled hair and flushed cheeks Harry looks breath-taking and Draco wants to climb into the DJ box and shout out to the world that Harry is his.
Things heat up just a little!
“He, err,” Harry scrubs a hand through his hair, “he heard Hermione and me talking about, ummm, when you’re going to leave.”
Before they can start bickering, Draco speaks up, “Let’s go with the dragon story for today? Daddy’s tired and the merpeople story is very long.”
Teddy beams, eagerly digging in as Draco measures the maple syrup and mascarpone. A chubby hand holding onto a piece of strawberry pops into his line of vision; he turns to see Teddy holding it out for him.
“Yeah, she was my neighbour when I was growing up,” Harry says, fondly remembering old Mrs. Figg. “She took care of me when no one else did and even though she didn’t have magic, she was a proud member of the Order of the Phoenix.”
no way he forgot to take the potion yesterday. It hasn’t happened once in over 4 years since he started taking the daily dose to combat one of the many side effects of having a Veela heritage.
“Is that—”
Malfoy - the father, so different from all past perceptions he held about him.
Where the puppy gets a name, Harry has a plan and secrets are finally revealed.
From the depths of a mountain of blankets and empty tea cups, a
He’s glad to see Malfoy’s lips twitch but just as soon he’s back to frowning again.
With one last lick I pull back, wiping my mouth with a hand as I gaze down at his dripping arsehole. I can’t possibly hold back any longer.
The kiss starts off chastely, Draco’s lips are a warm relief from the bitter wind and Harry presses in closer, chasing the hint of sweetness from the candy cane Draco had indulged in. He wants
“Harry!” Hermione greets him, wrapping in a hug as soon as he opens the door. “What took you so long, we’ve been -
“Harry,” Ron calls out, his voice making Draco start. “You in, mate?”
Finally, just as Emma announces that dinner is ready, the door opens and Harry walks in. He looks
Speaking of Draco, Harry frowns as he picks up a blue sock that most definitely doesn’t belong to him. He shrugs and adds it to his laundry pile; Draco probably left it over by mistake.
Harry heads for the living room, the door left ajar, giving him a perfect view of the scene inside. The fire is lit, casting warm light over the room as his children play on the rug in front of it. Scorpius, his little scholar, is poring over a colouring book, filling the colours in neatly within the lines. Albus, the complete opposite of his twin, is focussed on his Quidditch models, making the miniature of his Aunt Ginny zoom around the room.
“What is this place?” Potter asked, getting comfortable amongst the cushions Draco had continued sourcing from all over the castle.
, it was a long time ago and he’s not looking for payback, Malfoy continues, “And it wouldn’t hurt for me to know more people outside my family now that we’ve moved back.”
. He truly had no plans for after. He had been so content with his life right now that, for once, he had not been worried about the future.
It takes me a while to get myself under control. I watch as I pull my cock out, his hole is still so open, stretched and gaping as my come drips out and down his crack.
He isn’t a big coffee drinker anyway, he’s not sure when or how Hermione managed to develop such an addiction for the beverage before he noticed, (and could do anything to stop it), and besides, drinking any hot chocolate other than that made by his mother is just blasphemy.
Thank you for all the puppy name suggestions! ♥ It was
Harry coughs. “RIght, about that, listen Malfoy, I know that was out of line, I’m sorry. Umm,” he continues, fidgeting a bit, the biscuit tin held awkwardly in his hands, “as an apology I brought you these.”
“It’s my fault.”
“Tough day?”
Trying to lighten the mood, he jokes, “You’ll be so confused with all the free time you’ll have when Scorpius heads off to Hogwarts. Molly once told me that she when Ginny had also left she would find herself creating mess just to have something to clean up.”
“This room.” Draco waved a hand to vaguely indicate the space around him. “How long till they make me leave?”
The witch hadn’t reacted at all to hearing his name. In stark contrast to his last visit to the Ministry, though that had happened over four years ago. His hearing and all the required visits to the Ministry feel like they happened in another lifetime.
While, fine, there is a point to be made  here because  it  is true that he and Malfoy  make a really good team, what with Malfoy’s extensive knowledge of tracking and planning and Harry’s penchant for attacking and then learning,  that doesn’t mean he wants to spend an

“Did you make that in school today?”
“Congratulations,” he said, leaning towards Harry to press a soft kiss against his cheek and carefully laying the wrinkled letter down on his lap.
exhausted.
“Listen,” Draco says,“Scorpius is staying with my mother tomorrow night, come over for dinner.”
Draco hums as he takes in the contents of the kitchen. He has one eye on Teddy, who is perched on a counter, absentmindedly playing with a rolling pin. The elves try to politely ask Draco to leave. They assure him they can get a snack ready in minutes,
"When did you get back?" Draco asks distractedly, too busy making sure the suit is hanging up properly. "I'm sorry, I knew I said I would be home but I just -"
“Come on, up with you, I’d rather not freeze out here tonight,” Draco says, holding out a hand to hoist Harry up and really, he should know better by now. “Come on . . .
He still remembers the hopeful edge to Father’s voice, the look of relief on Mother’s face when that wolf had brought those prisoners in. He can still smell the stench of his fetid breath on his robes, the rotting stink that permeates the room.
Four months later, he is on first name basis with the staff here.
“I love cake!”
“Right then.” Draco nodded. “To the Gryffindor dorms then.” He mentally steeled himself to make the trek towards the part of the castle he religiously avoided.
And he seems to be Harry’s new neighbour.
Draco’s kid.
“Let’s see, do you think I can name him something like
Yeah, he doesn’t believe it either.
“Get in with me?” he asks, tugging on Draco’s sleeve.
“Hi, working late today?”
Harry turns and catches Scorpius with a laugh. The little boy giggles and tucks himself under Harry’s neck, holding on tight with one hand fisted in Harry’s sweater.
Draco sighed softly, whispering a soft kiss against Potter’s cheek before enveloping him in a hug.
"Come on, Malfoy, just one look."
“Potter!”
“I’ll get these started,” he assures Draco, settling the stack down in the sink. With a flick of his wand he gets the dish rag started, the water frothing with bubbles as soap is added. He leans back against the counter then, pulling Draco to lean against him with an arm around his waist. “Teddy wants to play with his Uncle Draco.”
his friend Bill’s dads were. While they had spluttered, embarrassed and too awkward to look at each other, and explained that no, they were
“Will you catch them tomorrow, then?” Scorpius pipes up from Harry’s lap.
Harry folds his arms on the edge of the bathtub and rests his head on them, giving Draco his full attention as he undresses. Draco takes his time, neatly folding each article of clothing, but Harry isn’t complaining, it gives him more time to admire his husband’s broad shoulders, the curve of his spine and those hip bones he’s spent hours marking.
“I’m sorry-”
Still un-beta read and still filled with mistakes.
Scorpius scowls. “I don’t wanna take a bath.”
He looks up to see Harry standing at the top of the stairs. He’s sure he doesn’t look half as bad as Harry looks. His glasses are lopsided, he has flour on his face, and his hair looks even more unmanageable than usual. But it’s the defeated slump of his shoulders that makes Draco’s chest ache.
This was his house, and he’s sure he can make it have some semblance of a home once again. Leaving the rest of the cleaning up to the elves, Draco decides to tackle the more pressing issue first. In order to get down to testing different hybrid variants of the core plant ingredients, he needs an enclosed space, preferably outside, where he can alter conditions as needed.
Based on the photo in the chapter.
“I wasn’t sure if it was for me. I was just overjoyed that she even considered me for it, but,” Draco explained, feeling his heart race, “I’m going to take it.”
“The ones we use in Anti-Venom Potions?” Harry asked, leaning forward with interest as Draco moved the pots around. He stuck a piece of parchment in front of each as a label.
“I’ll tell him soon. Just, not when he’s so busy.”
For Day 6 of the 25 days of Drarry Challenge!
Loki jumps as Draco opens the door, quieting down when Draco shushes him. The puppy, though he’s fast outgrowing that name, sleeps in Scorpius’s room but when he wants to be let out in the morning it’s Draco or Harry he comes to wake.
“I think so, yes.”
“Professor Sprout wrote to me a few days ago,” Draco said, looking straight at Harry. “She recommended me for a Fellowship at the Institute of Herbology in France.”
The thought of settling into a warm bath, surrounded by the heady scent of chamomile and peppermint, makes Harry already feel better. By the time he enters the bathroom, a trail of clothes behind him, it already smells divine.
He knocks once, shuffling on the spot as he waits for Draco to open the door.
Draco looks nervous, one hand coming up to run through his hair before he takes a deep breath, visibly steeling himself before he asks, “Would you like to go out for dinner with me? Tomorrow, maybe?”
, it’s only just turned six in the evening but he knows it’s going to be another long night for Harry. He leans against the kitchen wall with a sigh, trying to calm his breathing. It works only for as long as it takes for Maximus, the tawny barn owl that Harry finally caved and bought last year, to hoot softly from outside the window.
“Can I help?” He looks so excited, his eyes wide as he waits for permission.
“Nope.” Harry shakes his head. “I didn’t have a very nice family for a very long time but now I do and it makes me so happy.”
Scorpius looks shocked, understandable because Harry hasn’t ever had reason to be so firm with him before, but he nods nevertheless.
“I wasn’t fair to you.” Harry speaks confidently, his eyes bright behind his glasses. “I’m sorry. For not prioritising us and for not being there for you the way you were there for me.”
~ And then they lived happily ever after. ~
Harry looked shocked.
“Oh,” he exclaimed, recognising Professor Sprout’s handwriting on the front of the letter. He eagerly tore it open, getting comfortable on his bed to carefully read through the surprisingly long letter.
He didn’t have to plan for the future alone.
“Don’t go, Draco.” Teddy pouts, his expression a cross between sullen and sad. “My toys are here and Milly and Zeb and the peacock and Draco.”
“I know a place.”
Potter blinked. “What?”
“I’m . . “ Malfoy’s voice wavers, his breath hitches as he tries to keep his emotions under control. He takes the cup of tea from Harry with a whispered thanks, his fingers clenching around the handle. “I’m not proud of my actions after my release, Potter. I acted like a selfish, brat who tried to pretend that nothing in this world was more important than him. I know that, for you, that’s probably no different than how you perceived me in Hogwarts.”
As he walks past the information desk, nodding at the witch who hands him his morning reports, his eyes track over the patients queued around the desk. He’s almost at the elevators, hand out in front of him to press the button when he freezes. With slow dawning horror, he turns and his eyes instantly find the witch standing halfway down the queue.
Harry idly played with a stray thread on the carpet. “You know, in June. What do you have planned?”
“Besides, your obvious knack for rash decisions and evading death.”
“Pfft, he has nothing to be nervous about, I know he’ll be brilliant.”
Also, baring any other strokes of inspiration that might hit me, no more secrets between Harry and Draco! (Other than their feelings for each other, that is. Oblivious boys are oblivious.)
“Oh my God! When did you get a puppy?”

Yay, we made it to the date! I had big plans for today but the prompt REALLY threw me off. :D

, had been as exhausting as he had feared. Hermione had been unrelenting in her questioning and Harry had tried to answer as well as he could without giving away any information about Malfoy’s past.
“Hi Harry!”
Harry learns that Malfoy is an adorable and affectionate drunk. He stops after one drink himself just so he can appreciate this version of Malfoy, free from inhibitions. By the time they reach the castle, Malfoy is all but leaning on him, rambling about Harry’s hair.
Harry shakes his head, moving back to let Malfoy enter. “No, no, not at all. Come on in.”
“Your defensiveness is adorable.”
It takes them 2 days of research to realise that the cursed fire that is devouring everything is created by the Fiendfyre that was started five years ago.
He’s debating tearing the maze down while he’s here—he always hated the blasted thing since he got lost in it when he was six—when he comes across a small plot of land that has no label but for his great-great-grandmother’s name, Celestina Malfoy.
"Harry?"
Still un-beta read and still filled with mistakes.
“Nope.”
. Did the Healers warn you of the consequence?”
Maybe if they had been paying more attention to their path and less on bickering they wouldn’t have lost the map. Maybe if they had spent more time trying to find the map than blaming each other they would have been able to reach the campsite before the storm hit.
“Draco.”
but he has no control over his words.

“Are you cooking?”
He can’t stop his laugh when he sees the card, it’s definitely . . .
Scorpius and Harry have some ice-cream together.
He wants to share this feeling with Malfoy, show him how he makes  him feel. But he can’t find the words to express himself, so he kisses Malfoy instead. Slowly and softly, one hand cradling Malfoy’s cheeks as he presses him back against the wall. Malfoy wraps an arm around Harry’s waist, the other hand burying  itself in Harry’s hair, making him moan and nip at Malfoy’s lip.
He smiles as Draco walks up to him; with the boys distracted, Harry can see how Draco finally let’s his relaxed face fall as he gets checked over for injuries.
"Err, I can explain?" Harry says sheepishly as he carefully puts all the photos back in.
“Well, I don’t know about everyday . . . “
“I want to ask Draco out to dinner.”

to get rid of the taste of chalk.
“Did you know, when I was your age, I had no friends. Only my cousin and he wasn’t very nice so I used to play alone.”
“Oh,” Draco breathes out, his eyes dazed as he tries to find the source of the interruption. Before Harry can point Draco in the right direction, or kiss him again because he looks sinful with his kiss swollen lips and flushed cheeks, Scorpus runs in with Loki right behind him.
I could eat Draco out for hours, have done so many times before. But there’s something exhilarating about doing so while he’s sleeping. I miss his moans and shouts of pleasure but I love being able to move him around and have him completely at my mercy.
Harry settles on the bed next to Albus and carefully tucks the covers around him, “It’s okay. We can do a short one today.”
then it would be rude of me to refuse.”
As his gaze once again drifted over to Potter, he allowed himself to stare. The “Potter” in his head, the impression he’d built over the years from that very first moment on the Hogwarts Express to the image of him speaking on Draco’s behalf in front of the entire Wizengamot, seemed to pale in comparison to the real person sleeping across the room.
Harry almost envies his puppy for a second. He then wonders when he started getting such weird thoughts.
“I dunno, something for your hair. I never thought to question it! I didn’t even know you could get pregnant!”
“Then there are the Weasley’s, so many of them, and of course, Teddy and your Father and you.”

“I’ve been keeping him hidden, too afraid to even step out because I don’t want him exposed to the kind of hatred and prejudice I’ve seen others have to suffer through, that I’ve inflicted shamelessly myself on others.”
The formatting is all messed up, I know. Idk why, I've tried pasting it multiple times and yet it's all weird. *headdesk*
“Malfoy? Is that you? -”
“Scorp, stop!”
“What are you trying to say?”
“Ah.” Draco grimaced. He could empathise with Potter, as weird as that felt. As he grappled with the decision to offer his space to Potter for one night, the decision was all but made for him when Potter stumbled again. Draco was almost carrying his entire weight now, and seeing Potter in this state, the same Potter who’d stood strong and confident at his family’s hearing to speak for him and his mother, was jarring.
The one where Draco is amused and Harry is even more confused (if that was possible).
“Malfoy, I promise you. I haven’t and will not tell anyone about this room. Do you believe me?”
eagerly.
With a sigh, I lie down next to him and curl around his back, trapping his legs under mine as I wrap an arm around his waist. I nuzzle against the crook of his neck, breathing in the scent that is just Draco and can feel sleep creeping up again.
“I’m a Healer for Merlin’s sake,” Draco groans, running a hand through his hair. The muted golden glow of the potion makes him pause. He feels vaguely off kilter, like the room was forced off its axis for a bit and then resetted, but nothing is where it used to be. Though there’s doubt creeping in, he has
He think of all people Draco slept with, all those who saw him as nothing more than a convenient lay, too drunk to even appreciate the person underneath. He doesn’t want to be like them, he wants to make Draco feel appreciated, show him he’s worth so much more.
“Mr Malfoy,” the dark-haired man greets, shaking Draco’s hand enthusiastically. “I’m Christopher Everly, with the Office of Forensics. We’re so glad you could make it at such short notice.”
“Ah, thank you,” Draco says bashfully, settling into his seat “It was a long and arduous process tracking all variables and finding optimum conditions, but the results were pleasantly surprising.”
They aren’t in a relationship or anything rubbish of that sort. It’s never about love. It’s about need. Need for an outlet, need for relief, need for attention or need for approval; it doesn’t matter.
Draco laughs then, making Harry turn to look at him. The fetching blush on his cheeks is very distracting but Harry is focussed on his eyes, his gaze burning as he stares at Harry.
Where Draco breaks down and Harry plans to make everything better.
“I still remember the ceremony, you know,” he breathes, his voice soft as he remembers the day he buried his father. “ My mother made sure to have everything done perfectly, right down to the wreathe of his favourite flowers . . . ”
Spending time with the man, and perhaps equally importantly, meeting Scorpius had made him forget all about his initial suspicions about the man. His curiosity was still alive, he wanted to know more about
Teddy nods, clumsily trying to roll up his sleeves just like Draco had. He stays still as Draco helps him, waiting patiently for him to gather everything on the counter in front of them.
Taking in the sight of Draco, with his wind tousled hair and smudge of ink around his chin from where he was probably lost in thought while replying to one of Hermione's many owls, Harry almost wishes he had the camera close so he could document this moment right here. He resists the urge to look for it though, some moments are best preserved the way they are.
“I love you.”
Draco finds himself seated across from Harry. He’s already in conversation with Everly, the Harry of now a more sociable and open version than the one he remembers. He realises this is the first time he’s actually seeing Harry interact with someone in a social setting. It’s a jarring thought, reminding Draco just how hidden away into each other they were.
Harry’s first meeting with Scorpius was a disaster.
As the last of their guests leave, Draco closes the Floo, feeling the wards settle around the house. The sitting room is dark save for the light from the Christmas tree, the twinkling lights casting shadows across the walls. Teddy had been in charge of the decoration, guiding Harry and Draco on where to place each bauble and each string of tinsel.
“Then you’re a more forgiving man than most others out there,” Malfoy laughs bitterly. “Anyway, it’s a good thing you stopped by because I would have probably spent the night finishing a bottle of wine and falling asleep on the sofa.”
“Which ones are these?” Harry asked, pointing towards the three brightly coloured pots kept separate from the rest.
“You,” Draco pointedly looks over at the wide expanse of bed space behind Harry, “know we have a fairly large bed right?”
Draco scoops Scorpius from Harry’s lap and cuddles him close. “On my life.”
He closes the remaining distance and presses his lips to Harry’s, he knows he’s rougher than usual, biting and sucking with more fervour than ever before, but he hasn’t felt this wound up in a long time and he knows that only Harry can bring him down. Harry places his other hand on Draco’s lower back, uses it to bring Draco forward till they are moving against each other, creating a delicious friction that makes Draco ache for more. As if hearing his unspoken plea, Harry slides his hand under Draco’s trousers, curving it around Draco arse. Draco whimpers, making Harry tighten his hold and Draco can’t help it anymore. He breaks away, taking in the sight of Harry’s flushed cheeks and red, slick lips.
It takes him almost two months to actually figure things out and he feels like a top class fool.
familiar.
The man in question looks up at Harry in confusion, brows furrowed in confusion, and there’s no denying it. That’s Draco Malfoy.

“Thanks,” Harry croaks, his voice still sleep wreaked. “Where did you find the tea?”
Based on the photo in the chapter.
“Cats?”
? Are you crazy, Potter?”
“No,” Draco says, his voice firm. “They told me, the Healers. Even after I had found out that I was having Scorpius, I refused to come back home. I stayed alone in one of our Villa’s, a little outside Paris.”
He dozed off on the window ledge and woke two hours later with a jolt. He felt warmed by the morning sun next to the chill of the window. He’d been ready to try and sneak in a few more minutes of sleep while he was still drifting in and out of consciousness till he remembered the events of a few hours ago. Jolting up, he peered around the room with eyes half-open till he spotted the sofa and the glaring absence of anyone on it. Ignoring the twinge of disappointment, Draco took in the neatly folded blanket, the properly stacked cushions.
“Maybe. We first need to be sure there aren’t any more bad guys around.”
to be, Draco hexes Harry and gets punched in return.
Harry watched as Draco carefully placed a growing charm on each pot and noted their conditions on his parchment.
Harry blinks at him. Once. Twice.
The voice in head, that bears an uncanny resemblance to Hermione’s voice says,
. The body beneath all those Christmas lights is definitely fit but Harry can’t over how spectacularly crass the whole thing is, it’s
“I’m sorry!”
. . .
It was also more hours alone than Draco was prepared for. A month ago, when Harry and he had been making plans to spend their days relaxing by the small pond on the Manor grounds, Draco had been
“I’m not sure that would get you the reaction you’re hoping for, mate.” Harry chuckles at Ron’s morose expression, he’s glad
“Did you know that one of the bravest people I knew was a Squib too?”
Draco sighs. "Maybe a little," he answers, something in Harry's expression makes him hastily add on, "just a little though. I meant to put it back in it's hiding place but I was in such a rush that it must have slipped my mind."
Bronan shoots him a cheeky salute, rolling slightly on his chair.
Potter looked surprised at the question. “To thank you. For helping me that day.”
“What?” Harry asks when Draco shoots him a glare. “It’s funny!”
Harry ignores him and stretches  covering himself, ready to get a few more hours of sleep.
“Hiya.”
Prompt for the week: "It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends."
Harry was still looking at the letter clutched tightly in Draco’s hand, brow furrowed. “He was one of the examiners for my Defence Against the Dark Arts N.E.W.T.”
In hindsight, maybe handing him a four-foot-long parchment has been taking it too far.
Draco was confused, and it was apparently visible on his face since Potter felt the need to continue.
Twenty seconds before they might die, Malfoy looks to his left to see Harry smiling at him as he says the words that make him breathe again.
day. I only managed to get this done today by taking cover behind a tree, in the corner of my garden. There's dirt here, lot's of it. Besides, more suspense is good suspense, eh? :D *hides*
Draco’s been thinking of studying via correspondence, at least till Scorpius grows old enough to start school. Harry had stayed up with him last week, helping him short list courses he could study till Draco had selected one.
Surprisingly, Draco sees Harry more than he thought he would, considering this isn’t even a case he’s a part of. Harry seems to have a knack for knowing when Draco’s in, dropping by with a cup of tea or, once, a bag of lemon cakes that he mentions picking up “just because.”
“Hey, Potter,” Draco chirps, “guess what?”
“Always the celebrity, Potter,” Malfoy says, but unlike years before, when the tone would have held nothing but scorn and bitterness, he now sounds amused.
Draco stares, certain he’s never come across this structure, despite walking through this patch of the gardens many times before. It’s all metal and glass, the panes slightly dusty, but he can make out shapes and greenery behind them. The building is about five times the size of Hagrid’s hut, with the highest point of the domed roof towering over thirty feet above the ground.
Now that he mentions it Harry can vaguely recall interacting with some of Hermione’s co-workers. He takes another look at Dave, remembering the interested glances he’d pretended to ignore, too exhausted from a full and busy work week. Dave is smiling good naturedly, waiting for Harry to say something.
