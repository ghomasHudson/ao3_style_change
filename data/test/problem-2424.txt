The fountain had been changed—no longer the Fountain of Magical Brethren, nor the Magic is Might monstrosity, but some large, vague marble sphere that spewed water out of the top, which landed back on the stone and cascaded down into the pool below. It was so different from what he’d seen before, but Harry’s memories were still flashing in Draco’s brain, alongside his own: the spot by the wall where the statue had guarded a fifteen-year-old Harry, the space on the floor where Harry had fallen, in agony under Voldemort’s possession, the floor that’d been crowded by an angry mob after eighteen-year-old Draco was freed—
Draco opened his mouth to demand they apparate to the intriguing ice cream straightaway, but something bright and silvery burst into the garden, stopping next to the pair of them on the blanket.
Harry smirked at him, and returned the pen to the paper.
—but still grinning wildly as he stepped back from Timsy and gave him a low, exaggerated bow. The elf rolled his eyes again—did he pick that up from Draco?—and gave a little curtsy, because it was proper. He wasn’t even a little bit winded.
Hermione raised her eyebrows silently, because she’d obviously already answered that question. Harry stared at her in shock, his mind racing. Her eyes darted to the colourful crumbs on his chest, amused and exasperated.
He felt a rush of admiration for Hermione, who’d created a
“Good. Meditation first, a bit more than we did last time, yeah?” Draco suggested, and Harry took a deep breath, positioning himself as he had on Monday. Draco wondered if he’d been practicing at all in the days between their sessions, if he was finding it as helpful or enjoyable as Draco did.
“Then that’s why they put Harry here,” Ron interrupted, looking at Harry, “to see the results of their experiment. Harry’s the creepy watcher. He’s their
“Since your father passed,” Harry finished the sentence for him, drawing a murderous glare from him and Ron both.

That day on the train, after Harry had rejected him, Draco had fled Harry’s compartment with Greg and Vince after Greg was “attacked” by Weasley’s rat. He’d told Greg and Vince to go on to their own compartment without him, and he’d made his way to the most deserted end of the train, near the exit of the rear car. Draco had then proceeded to throw his tantrum in solitude, angry at himself for crying a little, and all he could think about was
“She also loved having people’s secrets, throwing their vulnerability in their faces. She outed me to my parents, when she thought I was taking too long to fulfill Voldemort’s… task. It took me six months of rigorous training, on my own, to learn enough Occlumency to keep her out. Thank Merlin I was at school most of the time.”
“Well, that was obviously not true,” she said. “You wouldn’t have been able to say it if it was.”
out loud?” Hermione clarified, and Harry nodded.
“What’s this, then?” Draco asked, amused. He took the object from Harry’s hand, and read Harry’s handwriting on a piece of paper inside the plastic:
to make the most of this. He was doing this to gain Harry’s trust.
“I swear to Merlin, I’m never stepping foot in that bloody village again for the rest of my life,” Draco snapped. Harry couldn’t help the fond grin, even as his mind churned with anxious thought.
“Yes, exactly,” Harry chuckled, and Draco’s lips twitched—he’d heard that one from Draco, too. “I’ll show you. Hermione taught me this spell a long time ago.”
“Of course, it’s not true, but the mind isn’t always formed by
—he truly was Lucius in miniature.
He flicked ash off the end of the cig, chuckling to himself. His amusement firmly ended, however, when he realized
Harry hesitated for a moment, looking back and forth between them. They were not going to like this—just like they hadn’t liked him testifying for Draco, in the first place.

to break into the Ministry and into the DoM back in ‘96. Lucius had set a trap for us, and there’s no way he could have done it without the Unspeakables’ help. You know how tight security is here.”
“Tell Ron Draco wants tikka masala,” Harry told it, before glancing back at Draco. “What do you think Timsy wants?”
Harry could tell which were real, but only in the way that he knew what his own real memories looked like. They felt different, when he looked at them, dancing around in their vials, trying to get back to him. The fake one danced the same—but only because Harry made it so.
in his stomach. He gasped and doubled over, clutching his abdomen and panting, but the potion forced him to continue through the pain. “—but we weren’t fucking. We were just laying together, and his nose was in my hair and he was whispering something against my ear, and I don’t know who he was, but I knew that I loved him, and that he loved me. It’s not real. But the happiness I felt was, and it was enough to conjure a corporeal Patronus.”
“My goddaughter loves Oscar,” he said with quiet excitement, “she says I’m like him, sometimes, when I’m being grumpy, or when I’ve just woken up.” He rolled his eyes exaggeratedly, a friendly smirk on his face. Rose let out a tiny giggle.
doing it for her, technically, because of the life debt, but he was really doing it—“For her son.”
Harry urged, watching the closed door.

“Harry…?” Hermione probed gently. Harry opened his mouth to speak, to ask, to
(See the end of the chapter for
He closed his eyes, feeling every inch of his resilient body, finding the links he’d created all over Europe. He felt the idyllic peace of the Isle of Man, the pulsing life of Paris, the brassy wonder of Prague. He found the triumph and care of Copenhagen, the sorrow and despair of Azkaban.
It was a small, unobtrusive mole, all shimmering silver mist, not big or bright enough to wake Draco. Harry had never seen his boss’ Patronus before; in fact, he’d never even thought about it. But he knew, without a doubt, that it was Kramer’s.
Draco hadn’t even known such a thing was possible. But he was grateful for the result, so he didn’t question it. The warmth flowed and filled him so completely, and Draco could unfortunately feel a stir in his groin, but that couldn’t be helped, with Harry warming and pushing his blood around his body, and with Harry’s thoughtless display of magical power. His bonds agreed, apparently, because there was no pain, no tweak of warning, thank Merlin.
“No.” Honestly, why would he be…?
It was small and slow, at first, simple swaying back and forth where they stood, until Harry rolled his eyes, pulled him in by the back of his neck, and took over. Draco let out a surprised little giggle as Harry released his hand to grab his hip, guiding his movements.
Draco glanced up from the file to find all three members of the Golden Trio staring at him in utter shock. This time, he could not suppress his eye roll as he clicked his tongue, annoyed. “What now?”

Ron exclaimed, probably louder than he’d meant to. Hermione rolled her eyes at him.
Draco climbed back into the bed, clad in only his briefs, and pulled the covers up to their shoulders. He rolled to his side, facing Harry with tired, red-rimmed eyes.
to discuss.” He held up his still shaking hand in emphasis. “But you are vulnerable to me, in here, so I allow myself to be vulnerable with you, in here, too. Any question you ask of me will be answered honestly, and without judgement. I am taking a risk, as well, you understand—you will learn things about me that I’d rather keep to myself, and if you wanted to, you could run to the Daily Prophet and tell them everything. You could even
“Yeah, I know,” Ron said with a tired smirk. “Alright, fine. Keeping an eye on Malfoy was always your area of expertise, anyway.”
Harry looked around, his gaze pausing on the roses—blooming, petals slowly unfolding before his eyes. He grabbed his wand, casting a quick
“Harry?”
“What the…” Draco muttered under his breath. Harry tried not to laugh.
Harry was looking at him meaningfully, with that maybe-pride again, and something like
like you’re doing now. You went to your sessions, and you spent time with us, and you visited Andy and Teddy practically every other day. You didn’t
“Then we’re not pretending.”
“I’m impressed,” Draco murmured. “You’ve gained a lot of control over the past couple of weeks, if you were able to shove me around like that. Unless you’ve been an expert Occlumens all along, and you’ve been toying with me.” Draco smirked weakly. Harry’s face didn’t change.
“Call it whatever you want.”
“Brilliant,” Ron said, “I’ll be Secret Keeper, then.”
And then Harry’s lips were on his, so much softer than Draco had ever imagined they’d be, and he gasped and tried not to cry out softly with the twisting, stabbing pain that exploded in his core, but he couldn’t help it, just as he couldn’t help tightening his arms around Harry’s waist and kissing him back like it was the most important thing he would ever do.
Teddy’s fall slowed dramatically, his little body floating gently to the earth like a feather. Faces whipped around, including Harry’s, searching for the source, landing incredulously on one Draco Malfoy, who stood tall and still, his eyes wide with relief and fear, his wand arm outstretched.
“Harry.”
“Maybe I’m not meant for a waltz,” Harry retorted, grinning. Draco pulled him in by the small of his back, their bodies pressed together. Harry took Draco’s hand in his own, the other resting easily on his shoulder. “But I’ll let you lead, anyway.”
Harry laughed softly again. “Are you serious?”
“Curious.”

at all, back then.”
Malfoy was looking at Ron, who was staring in confusion at Hermione—a common occurrence. Hermione clearly felt his gaze, but continued watching Malfoy as she explained the word choice.
“Good idea, you and Weasley can handle that part of the investigation yourselves. Gives us more time to focus on healing you. I’ll get the important memories for you, though—we can do that before you leave today.” Draco looked at the next item on the list. “We’ll start on the curse today then, although I’m not entirely sure it can be classified as a curse, but that’s a discussion for another time.” Potter narrowed his eyes at him, again, but he had to go on.
That was unexpected. Didn’t Draco say he didn’t talk to muggles, because he was afraid of messing it up and getting arrested or something?
“I need the exit!” Draco growled with frustration, and the walls froze, a door banging open directly in front of him. Draco sprinted out of it, not bothering to close the door behind him, and didn’t stop until he was forced to, when he reached the lifts again.
.” Draco’s eyes flicked down to his lips, then back up.
Harry thought for a bit, biting his lip, before shaking his head. Draco sat back down in his chair.

“...Draco, are you listening?”
“The Netherlands,” Harry mumbled. Draco shook his head in exasperation.
“Harry,” Draco said, more firmly, his brows doing that concerned thing again. Harry smiled at him; it seemed Draco couldn’t help mirroring it, like Harry’s smile was connected to his own. “Tell me.”
He thought of Draco embraced by blush pink roses. He remembered her brown eyes, like Andromeda’s, her blond hair, like Draco’s; she was almost as tall as him. He thought of the smell of Earl Grey, the vibrancy of lemon slices, the abundance of sea thrifts.
—but Draco paused, looking closer, and saw that her hair wasn’t as dark, her eyes were softer. She held herself differently, calmer, and she was definitely wearing muggle jeans and a cable knit jumper, which Bellatrix wouldn’t have been caught dead in. He let himself examine her magical aura, just in case—the woman’s magic was gentle, probably a homemaker, definitely a mother, and it felt a little sad. It smelled like snow, and strong tea. Definitely not Bellatrix, Draco decided, shoulders relaxing.
“Yes, someone cursed him, but it was quite bizarre, I was unable to figure out a motive… Might have been a fan that lost the plot. The person was… indecipherable. I could not make out a single defining feature at all, it was charm work like I’ve never seen.” Malfoy paused, eyes darting to Harry, and Harry hoped he’d leave out the depressing and embarrassing bits in his retelling. Thankfully, he did.
“How would I tell a trustworthy stranger from an untrustworthy stranger?” Three fingers had joined Sirius’ tapping, the beat slow and untimed, before a rhythm of middle-left-right was established.
Letters were written in towering black ink, stark against the festering yellow of the paper, demanding attention.
Both boys slid into a seat. Ron was at the driver’s seat, Harry was in the passenger’s, the dirt covered windshield exposing only half of the world to them.
One boy shuffled over, a sliver of space created between him and a red-head, and Harry hesitantly sat there. The whole table was bursting with life, louder now it was surrounding him, smothering Harry in its vibrancy. An elbow dug into his side. His head turned to face the boy who had graciously offered him a place, the youngest boy at the table. They both blinked at each other.
“The first rule of thumb is to never, ever get into cars with strangers.” Cheek vibrating from the bounce of the car, Harry bit into his bottom lip to muffle his laughter, nodding solemnly along with Sirius’ words. “Which is why it’s important we’re no longer strangers, otherwise you would have started by breaking the most cardinal rule. Which is never a good way to start anything.”
It was then he noticed the gold glinting, a flash of light hitting the corner of his eye.
There is nothing more scary than family.
i literally know i promised draco in this chapter but it sort of got away with me and, really, if we've been following my update schedule at all, we should just be thankful that i wrote. but i set it up nicely for draco to be introduced next chapter and i cannot. Wait. also, what's a slowburn without six chapters and harry making friends and running from the law first?
“Now, if you go shouting into the night, you’re going to attract a real criminal.” Laughter hummed between them, trapped and swirling in the night air, and Harry’s lungs felt over-used from the sound of it all. The ache was a pleasant feeling, a gift of happiness so bright that it physically manifested itself. “Would you like some advice, runaway to runaway, Harry?”
The face, kept silent in ink, bulged and slithered across the page. His lips curled into a snarl, a threat hanging in his throat, his hands desperate to reach out and attack. The flecks of black that covered his hands, a trick of light and shading, appeared as sludgy blood. While a sense of familiarity bloomed at the picture, the grotesque distortion of the man’s features made it impossible to compare to anyone until he read the name.
A sharp pain stung his heel, a low hiss passing his lips as he hopped from one foot to the other. Sitting on the ground, he inspected his foot, squinting in the darkness. His sight betrayed no difference, light falling away from him, suffocated in the night. It was only with his fingers that he realised he was bleeding, warm and sticky over his fingertips. He hadn’t even taken shoes with him.
“I think I’m fine.” His foot was numb, but he could still walk on it. So he hobbled his way into the kitchen, which happened to be smaller than the room they were just in, with Molly behind him and the red-headed girl in front.
“What?”
“Levi,” Harry responded, mouth fitting into a thin line after the distaste of the lie settled over his tongue. “Where am I, exactly?” he asked, eager to brush past his words.
And, yet, the idea of not being alone did appeal to him in some manner. Companionship was a rarity.
Palm dug into Harry’s eye, trying to shake the thin layer of sleep that had embraced him. The heat was less constricting, but the oppressive chokehold of it still attacked him. “I don’t mind. But I might need the toilet before we go, too.” Harry ran his tongue over his teeth, trying not to long for the purple toothbrush stuck in his pseudo-bedroom, with its bristles worn to the base, itchy and hard to handle.
“I’ll come back. You know, eventually.”
“More than.”
“Petrol stations have everything a traveller could need and then some.” Voice was filled with a blind assurance, his smile loose and easy in the dull morning light. “Alright, maybe not shoes, but you could always get us something to eat. I bet they at least have something for breakfast. No, go on, shoo, I can’t sit in this car a moment longer.”
He patted the street sign with a fond merriness he had never felt for it before, fingers dragging over the inky black surface.
Only Ron and the girl stayed, beginning to clear away the plates as Harry quietly sat. It seemed wrong not to help, but he knew nothing about the house, or its rules, and he didn’t want to get in anyone’s way.
Despite that, Harry felt safer than he had for a long time, engulfed in a ring of light while the world outside darkened.
Sandwiches safe in the crook of his elbow, he held out the two notes. His mind felt heavy with a daze, a flurry of half-thoughts passing through. The money, of course she’d need the money - the money he had taken from Sirius Black. The sandwiches he had bought for Sirius Black. The car he had spent the night in, enjoying the freedom of summer air, with an escaped murderer. His name had turned sinister, etched with all the horrors it implied.
“I don’t know where I’m going, either. Would you like to come with me?” The stranger’s friendless had been touched by something foreign, the sound of pity, for the child sat alone in the darkness, his clothes ratty and ridden with holes, his feet smeared with mud. He must have been homeless, or desperate, and the stranger felt an attachment to the hopeless strength in his eyes.
“Did something happen to my legs?” Brow was drawn together as he spoke, lips parting slightly as he watched Molly. Beneath the covers, his hand reached out to press against the top of his thigh. He could feel his fingertips digging into his clothes, nothing broken.
The girl glanced over her shoulder, hands buried in the mess of the sink, eyes floating from her mother to Harry.
“Are you ready?” Harry breathed, as Ron pressed the keys into the ignition.
The station appeared shack-like from the outside, a jigsaw of faux-wood with the brown peeling away to reveal scraps of grey, but the inside was a blinding white. Everything had been scrubbed and pampered to the bone, the lights filling the room in a pure glow. The welcome mat greeting him was spotted with fine freckles of red and brown, smudges of green playing connect-the-dots between the stains. His toes wiggled, a lump of drying mud clumping onto the mat, and the small act of destruction filled him subdued glee.
“I’m not running away,” Harry said, folding the blanket once, before doing it again. He tucked it under his arm, and stood to his feet. One laid flat on the floor, but the other was lifted so the wound wouldn’t touch the ground. “I was just going somewhere.”
“Fred was always getting himself in trouble by climbing up trees when he was younger. He would get stuck and cry and cry,” Molly mused, holding a bowl of potatoes close to her chest as if she planned on nursing it. A soft sigh fell from her.
i might need to reread the chapters before continuing this story but, fear not! as slow as i might be, i know what direction i'd like to take with this story, and i'm excited for you all to follow along with me.
“Can I ask why you’re not wearing shoes?” The amiable silence had allowed for Harry’s eyes to explore, sating a curious nature that had been starved to the bone, but Sirius’ voice forced him to focus on the dashboard. It felt wrong to have his attention wander while Sirius spoke, but he didn’t want to observe the other while Sirius was doing the same.
“Anyone in the car with us right now? Or do I just shout out the window into the night?” Sheepish with his comment, Harry half-expected a quick reprimand. He looked over his shoulder to gauge the other’s reaction, relief surging through him at the sight of Sirius’ lips still quirked into a grin.
Sirius finds an unlikely ally while Ron and Harry grow closer.
“Where did you even learn to steal so much food?” Harry’s voice was tinted with wonder.
Dotted between the flowers laid trees. Most were a sickly brown, long and thin. Some of them had a few scraps of leaves sticking to the trunks, but most were barren, as if the vibrant flowers below had sucked all the life from them. Each of the trees strained towards the sky, straining for the barest hints of sunlight as they waited in their orderly rows. White patches mottled the light browns, as if the trees were hiding bones, the unblemished white struggling to free itself from the body of the trees.
“Of course. Do you think you can make it to the kitchen, Levi?” He thought he spotted the girl’s eyes twitch over to him, but he could have imagined it.
Eyes drooping, Harry forwent his response in favour of a yawn, jolting lightly as the car dipped into a pothole. He hadn’t expected the exhaustion of running away to hit him in one smooth swoop, but the speed of it was quick and torturous. Feeling Sirius’ hand touch his shoulder, squeezing lightly, Harry’s eyes fell shut.
“Ah,” Draco nodded, finally comprehending. “Right. Yes, I did the same thing with the floo from the Manor—as long as my mother is the one calling out the destination, she can come through, no problem. Except when a patient is present, of course,” he said, looking at Harry, who only continued to grin at him. Draco wondered if it was as surreal to Harry as it was to himself, seeing a Malfoy here with Harry and his friends.
hoped it wasn’t pity.
Harry kept his face carefully blank, trying to control the simmering rage that was building once again. He could blame the Minister, but Harry hadn’t seen it coming, either, despite Draco’s theories. He was just as at fault.
but resplendent black silk, and the gold chain Draco had bought him for their tenth anniversary. Draco half-expected this dream to provide someone to feed him grapes and fan him with palm leaves. He reached down and adjusted his rapidly hardening cock beneath his Healer’s robes, and Harry’s grin widened.
“That’ll take…

Draco let out a soft huff of a laugh: something mournful, nostalgic.

“No,” Ron breathed.

Harry laughed, his hair swishing over his shoulders as he finally left for work.
be an assault on his mind? He turned to Ron, remembered he couldn’t bloody speak, and reached over to grab the blank parchment and quill a Healer had left there for him, quickly writing out his anger and shoving the parchment in Malfoy’s face.
“I don’t think I’ve quite grasped the enormity of what you’ve done,” he mumbled. “That painting… that wasn’t his imagination, was it?”
at the Ministry, if he had been thinking clearly at all… and Kingsley certainly wouldn’t just let him walk out of his floo, minding his own business…
“If I may?”
so different from the first two, but Draco still loved it. He could definitely see why it was called a boombox now.
he mused warily.
Draco delicately closed the compartment, buzzing with anticipation, and tried to return all the other buttons and switches and dials to their original positions, somehow, before finding the “play” triangle—
“I’m sorry, Draco,” Harry rasped hoarsely, one shaky hand rising to touch Draco’s face,
Malfoy shook his head, stepping a little closer. “I think the correct term is ‘unfinished business.’”
and she wasn’t sneering at him, or attacking him, or serving him up to the Dark Lord. He felt a little spark of hope in his chest.
into Gryffindor, as I recall.” More soft huffs, more amusement. Draco found the sorting memory with ease; it still had its silvery glow around it.
Potter watched Draco for a moment, appraisingly, before pointing at him with a gentle movement.
So far, this curse was proving to be bothersome, but he was surprised at its painlessness. Harry’d been hit with hundreds of curses in his life, and none of them were
pair of slippers: some obnoxious fuzzy green monstrosities with a cartoonish face on them that Pansy had found at a muggle shop. The tag said “Oscar the Grouch”, which Draco had assumed was some muggle thing. Pansy had laughed and said the character on them was “fitting” for him, because he was grouchy and reclusive and “loved trash” which Draco took as the pointed barb it was on his taste in men. Apparently, her five-year-old daughter had seen the character on the “telly” and immediately thought of her godfather. Charming girl got her viciousness from her mother, clearly.
for Harry Potter.
Draco gently pulled away, breathing shakily. He lowered his wand, and closed his eyes, and kept them closed, forcing his breathing to even, counting his breaths, rubbing the tops of his thighs. He ran his hand through his hair, yes, that was his own hair, soft and sleek. He stuck his index finger into the open collar on his shirt, felt the raised skin of the tip of a scar there, on his collarbone. He rubbed the inside of his left forearm through his shirt, though it disgusted him more than usual, after that.
Harry gasped as the child’s strained, monotone voice echoed around his skull, but when it was over, he clutched the sphere tight in his fist. What utter

“They tried you in front of the full court, in the Death Eater courtroom, for underage magic?” Draco asked.

“That’s never stopped my boyfriend. He complains they’re too—” She made a little jazzy movement with her fingers, a conspiratory smile on her glittery face. “But I keep finding them under his pillow, the sentimental dork. Check your pillows.”
“Be my guest,” Kingsley sighed, looking around, thinking hard. “If
“Right. Well, Potter, we’ll discuss that curse first thing tomorrow morning, say, nine o’ clock? I can provide meals. We can meet here, or at your home, or at mine—which would you prefer?” Draco was curious for a glimpse of Potter’s home, but he had to offer options.
“I need my prophecy—the prophecy concerning Draco Malfoy.”
He should have known. He should have guessed. Of course,
Harry didn’t know what to say to that, so he didn’t say anything. Draco pulled out two mugs and a tin of loose leaf tea. Harry was starting to think he made tea just for something to do with his hands. He never used any magic to do it.
Draco pulled back and out, lowering his wand and his barriers, quickly putting the memory on the chalkboard (“First Quidditch win”) next to the rest. He idly rubbed the scar on his collarbone, watching Harry, processing.
He was currently sitting in an overpriced coffee shop in muggle London’s shopping district,
as the breath was knocked out of them both.
But he’d get used to it.
And so it continued—over and over, Harry was stared at, watched vigilantly, by a different person each time. But Draco could spot the similarities, after a while: in the way they held themself, in the intensity of their gaze, in the glass of brandy in their hand. He looked over at Ron.
Draco sighed again and carefully extricated himself, standing fully and taking the duvet with him. He bent down and laid Harry’s wand at his side, hesitated, then pressed a kiss to the top of Harry’s head.
Draco took a deep, shaky breath, finally pocketing his wand.
Potter looked back at him, his face guarded, still carefully not making eye contact. This was definitely going to be a job for the fucking books.
Her exasperated sigh was almost audible. He closed his eyes against the onslaught of magic and feeling, only opening them again at the feeling of something cool and soothing on his forehead.
“Uncomfortable,” Ron repeated, taking a deep breath. “Piercing. Curious. Invasive. Not friendly, but not threatening, either. I wasn’t even experiencing it, but it made me squirm.”
He heard Draco’s murmuring voice in his mind again:
He couldn’t be free from feeling responsible for the wellbeing of the Wizarding World, a burden that had been thrust upon him as a
“Hey,” Harry frowned, mildly indignant, but immediately mollified with another macaron. A pinkish colour, was that… strawberry and
“Green,” he answered, his grey eyes darting back to Harry’s. “Of course.”
Harry swallowed hard, turning his face into Draco’s palm. Draco set down his tea, sensing Harry’s unease. His expression was more open than it was for anyone else, tender and concerned; this expression was for Harry, alone. Harry’s heart clenched, holding on to Draco’s attention like a priceless treasure.
“Thank you,” Draco rasped finally, breaking the silence, pulling Harry down from the clouds.
He adjusted the strap on his shoulder again, crouching slightly to keep his feet hidden. He paused as he passed a stationery shoppe, his gaze falling on a number of shiny fountain pens in the window.
doing, this whole time.”
“N—” he tried. “Not in my home,” the potion corrected. “Apparently there are some waiting for me in an inheritance that I do not yet have access to. I don’t want them.”
wouldn’t deign to reach out to his disappointing, working, gay son. With a jolt, Draco realized Lucius would now classify him as a blood traitor, as well, with how he hadn’t identified Harry at the Manor during the War, and the donations he made regularly to charities supporting Muggleborn integration and orphans of the War. The thought made him feel somewhat accomplished.
Draco had had a similar conversation with Pansy, back in fourth year. He had tried so hard to be with her, to want her, knowing their parents would probably try to marry them one day. It just felt wrong—his instincts had fought him every step of the way, no matter how badly he wanted to want it. It had taken him a long time to come to terms with it, with acknowledging the massive disappointment he would be to his family, to his future wife. Having a crush on Cedric Diggory was one thing, but knowing your entire life wouldn’t be what you’d dreamed of was much different. He wondered if Harry had actually accepted that yet.
“Our biggest problem is that Lucius probably has the help of the Unspeakables, who are and have always been anonymous and extremely secretive. Apparently, they’ve been relying on us thinking they’re a bunch of paranoid swots in order to carry on without suspicion. No one, not even the Minister, knows what they get up to or have access to. But now that I think about it, it was way too easy for Harry and I, and a few other
As he stood up to go stow his latest purchase in the shed, he heard a man’s voice call his name from his floo, and he groaned quietly in irritation. He adjusted the belt on his dressing gown and buttoned up the top buttons of his pyjama shirt on his way to the sitting room.
“What, ask questions? As an Unspeakable?”

“Why not?”
He watched Harry meditate, touching some of his scars and his hair. Draco replaced his reading glasses on his face, and tried to add to his notes, but was distracted by Harry’s gentle movements, the sound of his even breathing, the rasp of his large palm moving over the stubble on his face. Draco absently rubbed his hand over his chest, feeling the thin, raised scars under the fabric, notes forgotten.
“I’m sorry,
“Harry, are you sure?” he asks quietly. “There’s no coming back from this, you know.”
Exhausted. Harry was
for this, but he released the back of Harry’s jumper, allowing him to retreat.
To say having Ronald Weasley nearly banging down his front door at daybreak on a Sunday was unexpected would be the understatement of the year.
Harry narrowed his eyes, allowing logic and reasoning out from behind the cloud of fear and rage, and finally recognized him as the absolute
Draco gasped as he retreated from Harry’s head, panting and shaking. It felt so fresh, so raw—he could practically taste the metallic tang of blood in the back of his mouth, could nearly feel the ripping, slicing of the Dark magic against his body, could almost feel the warm wetness of blood soaking his front, icy cold water against his back. His left hand had made its way to his chest, without his knowledge, and was gripping the front of his shirt. His body was bent forward, heaving, unconsciously leaning into Harry’s space, something warm was gripping his shoulders like a vice. His barriers had barely held until the end of the memory, and they were crashing, now. He didn’t want to open his eyes, but he knew he had to.
Draco reached up to his collar, plucking open the first of many buttons as he strode across the room to
He almost wished that had been a breadcrumb, just so he wouldn’t have to go back in Harry’s head today. He didn’t want to do his routine, didn’t want to return to himself, didn’t want to

of colorful scrunchies on the bed. It even had a silky blue one around its little neck, like a criminally adorable flower, and Harry’s heart nearly punched itself out of his chest, a wave of affection so strong it was almost violent.
Pansy listened to the song that was playing, and raised her eyebrows at him. Draco’s glare was now directed at the boombox.
“Sorry that happened to you, Boran,” he mumbled. “I know you can’t control it. Don’t worry, ‘kay? Lucius made a big mistake, choosing us. We’re gonna get out of here.”

“N—eurgh, Trelawney. But she doesn’t c—” He couldn’t finish that one, either.
Draco had been forced to answer Lucius truthfully, when asked how Harry felt about him:
At Harry’s nod, Draco fell back in, and found himself exactly where he had left off. “You brought me right back,” he noted, awed. “Your control really is quite impressive. You’ll be a great Occlumens, one day.”
“But what did they want with
Harry nearly jumped, reaching out in a futile attempt to stop him. He opened his mouth to shout, then tried to growl in frustration when he couldn’t. Not a sound left his lips. Didn’t Draco know he only needed three drops?
“Can I make it read in your voice instead?”
Through his obvious fear, Smith still managed to sniff derisively. Harry dug his wand deeper under his chin, and he winced at the increasing burn. Ron stood calmly in the doorway. He’d probably been dreaming of seeing this pillock get his arse kicked since fifth year. Ron could be scary enough, when he wanted to be, but it was still Harry who held the most power and influence, and in this case, reason to use it.
“Alright, Kingsley, Harry, ready when you are,” Ron said, stepping back a few feet from the door. Harry put one foot slightly in front of the other, bending his knees a bit, stabilizing his body. He raised his wand towards the door and waited for the Minister’s nod, before beginning the complicated wand movements, pushing his magic through his wand from his core.
“Aurors. Licensers. Wizengamot. Harry, this isn’t—” Draco’s voice was cut off. Whatever he’d been about to say was apparently untrue.
“You’re joking.” Harry furrowed his brows.
The vultures grumbled lame apologies as they dissipated, returning to whichever hole they’d crawled out of, leaving a shocked and aroused Draco alone in a corridor with a red-faced Harry Potter once more.
What was he doing here?
He heard a familiar
Harry picked up a blanket, feeling the soft fleece under his fingers.
Your best friend is the Head Auror! Nothing goes on there without you or Ron knowing about it, now. They know you testified for me, Harry, and they won’t go against you. It’s not the
or I will Stun you and drag you out of here by your feet. The Prophet would lose their minds,” Ron grinned deviously, reminding Harry suddenly of Fred. Harry couldn’t see a way out of it—Ron was apparently quite serious. He sighed and stood, but continued glaring. He’d go, but he didn’t have to be
Harry had been asleep for ten years, apparently—maybe longer. He hadn’t felt this alive since the Battle, when everything was scary and critical and heartbreaking, when every movement was life-or-death. Harry brushed his tongue over Draco’s lip; Draco met it with his own, sharing his breath, and it felt like
“Changed your mind already? Works for me—”
“Timsy is being following Harry Potter’s magical signature,” Timsy grumbled, and Harry mourned that he wasn’t
“My backup was actually a bottle of Ogden’s and a carton of ice cream, waiting for me back at Grimmauld,” Harry replied, smirking. Draco swatted his arm playfully.
“If you’re amenable, Potter, we can start with memory recovery right now. I’d have to look at the general structure of your mind to find any holes, and from there it’s a simple matter of tugging the memory back from your unconscious. You don’t feel like you’re missing anything substantial, correct? You don’t feel disconcerted, disorientated, or confused?” Draco asked.
Harry held on tighter.
Draco wasn’t too ashamed to admit he was pouting a little. He’d always been a sore loser. But as they walked back into the house, Harry bumped his shoulder with his, in a friendly, almost affectionate gesture only Pansy had ever done with him, and Draco chuckled softly at him, all of his moping forgotten.
Entirely, wonderfully mundane.
Harry reached over and grabbed his journal, bringing it back to Draco’s lap. He took the photograph out and sent it floating to his own bedside table.
“You were wonderful with him,” Narcissa sighed wistfully. “You’ll make an amazing father, one day.”
“What’s your favourite colour?” Draco asked.
“Oh,” Harry said, and Draco broke. Sobs wracked his tense frame, his body shuddering in Harry’s arms. Tears fell onto the page, blurring some of the words.

Harry flicked his wand automatically, holding his eye contact, and tumbled clumsily into Draco’s head.
“You know…” Draco set down his teacup in its saucer and picked up his quill. He dipped it in the pot of ink, gave Harry a calculating look, and began to write.
Malfoy’s low, smooth voice should have alarmed him, should have made instinct draw his wand for him. Harry felt nothing but vague curiosity, under the heaviness of trying to live again, of trying to carry his own weight, twice as difficult now that he knew the blissful weightlessness of Death.
He could feel Harry’s curious presence, watching. “Welcome to Provence, France,” he said quietly.
Harry wasn’t even bothering with his own meal anymore. He narrowed his eyes, scrutinizing him, growing more annoyed with each moment his revenge wasn’t fulfilled.
a secret lover, Draco.”
“I believe you two have some catching up to do,” she said, shooing them away. “Go on. I’m perfectly safe here, under the watchful eye of the incomparable Mrs. Granger.”
“This Seer told me that
Draco read from his expression—and handed it to Draco.
“I enjoyed our visit, Teddy,” Narcissa smiled at him. “I look forward to the next one.” She turned to her sister, holding out the hand Teddy had just released. Andromeda took it and squeezed it gently, and they grinned softly at each other. Narcissa seemed just as awed at the prospect of family as Draco did.
“Did you see what I saw? At the pub?” Draco tried again. Potter hesitated, then nodded slowly.
Harry’s smile widens. “I’m early because I couldn’t stand another minute of not being near you.”
He made an illegal Portkey to Amsterdam, and left the wretched island without looking back.
Over a bond
Hermione looked away. “They, erm… they’re a bit embarrassed, I think. They were quite disturbed to find out you were magically bound to Healer’s Ethics—they just thought you were a stickler, or something. I doubt they would have allowed it to continue if they’d known, to be honest.”
Including, and perhaps
Harry’s hand grew sweaty in Narcissa’s, but he refused to let go. Hannah eventually forced him to sit down, so he’d be out of her way. He sat as still and unobtrusive as he could and tried not to think about how angry Draco would be, soon.
“Not if it’s done right, but it’s
Harry dropped his face into his hands. He heard the shifting of parchments, then soft footsteps padding over to him, before Hermione’s hand landed on his shoulder.

He didn’t know if the constricting feeling in his ribs was his or Harry’s. He was not entirely sure if he wanted to know. His finger traced the scar on his collarbone, the Mark on his arm, rubbed the tops of his thighs.
Harry laughed silently at him, and Draco’s lungs tightened at seeing him look so happy, so carefree,
The prophecy, if there was one, was probably about Harry. But it had caused a reaction that had sent Harry to the only Healer Legilimens in England: Draco. And unless the attacker themselves was a Seer, the only way they could have heard it was from the Seer’s mouth—or else the prophecy concerned them, as well, and they had full access to it.
Draco shook his head frantically, futilely trying to fight back the words. “I dreamed I was in my bed, naked, with a man curled behind me. It was morning, we were waking up, he was stroking my sides, intertwining our fingers, pulling me closer to him. I could feel the warmth of his chest against my back and his erection against my arse—” Draco groaned and doubled over, clutching his abdomen, his face twisted in pain. Was this a side effect of an overdose? Harry didn’t quite remember, but watching Draco, he thought he could now recall something about painful convulsions. “—but we weren’t fucking. We were just laying together, and his nose was in my hair and he was whispering something against my ear, and I don’t know who he was, but I knew that I loved him, and that he loved me. It’s not real. But the happiness I felt was, and it was enough to conjure a corporeal Patronus.”
The shed was quiet for a while as Draco stood there, glaring at the stupid boombox. After a moment, he felt small hands wrap around his waist, and looked down to see Pansy hugging him, settling her face on his chest. He sighed and wrapped his arms around her slender shoulders, laying his cheek against her sleek, dark hair. She smelled like mint leaves and lime, his very best friend, his family.
the ins and outs of Draco’s work, who had signed off on the approval of his magical bonds, and who was here discussing a patient with him, anyway.
He tried to tuck his hair behind his ear, but the lawless curls fell right back into his face, drawing a huff of frustration from his mouth.
“I see it,” Draco announced, grateful for the sight of a destination in the telltale glow in his peripheral vision. He pushed a bit more of his magic through his wand, forcing his right hand to remain steady. “Here we go—”
Harry stared at him for a moment, eyes full of curiosity, and nodded hesitantly. Draco breathed in deep, and concentrated hard on Harry, reaching out gently with his magic, allowing himself to perceive it all. Harry’s lips parted as he watched, and Draco wondered if he could feel Draco’s magic, too.
Malfoy muttered darkly. “It’s good to know your brains have actually grown to fill that massive head of yours.”
“While a lot of it was very intense, I only saw the one crumb. We’ll go back and see if there’s one more from that year—I’ve a feeling there must be another—and then we’ll call it for a nap, yeah?”
Shacklebolt raised his eyebrows again, probably at the sheer audacity of Draco Malfoy, ex-Death Eater, mere Healer, asking the Minister for a favour, after telling him how to do his job. But Kingsley was a politician now, had been for eight years, and traded freely with the currency of favours.
Regardless, Draco couldn’t make himself stop, though he wished he would. He couldn’t move.
everything that smelt of his husband and burrow into it until he was safe and warm. However, that feeling soon bled into
After a numb, suspended moment, Draco smelled smoke among the heavy scent of ozone, and opened his eyes to see the cinders from the fire catching on the carpet in front of the wingback chairs. He walked carefully over to them, unfreezing his limbs, enduring the aftermath of adrenaline, and picked up Harry’s glass of lemon water, pouring it over the burning embers, dousing the tiny flames.
He felt Harry’s hands tighten on his wrists, he heard Harry’s own voice in Harry’s head, for the first time.
“Your mother put all this here?” he croaked. “For the prisoners?”
in the last decade. He’d wanted to
“But you’ve caught plenty of snitches in your day,” Draco remarked. “I know that was the first, and probably the only one you’ve ever swallowed,” he smirked, “but why do you think that particular one was so formative to you?”
“Timsy, Pansy, and my mother, though not as often as I should. Minister Shacklebolt, occasionally. The staff of the Curse Damage ward at St. Mungo’s, when we collaborate.” He paused, but apparently the potion thought this was important. “There’s a muggle bakery called Sweet Nothings, in London, I’m friendly with the folks there. I buy their baklava regularly, because Timsy loves it.”
“Be honest, Harry,” he said, putting the kettle on. “Did you sign up for this just to try to get into bed with me?”
“Excellent deduction,
The boy nodded, still afraid of potential backlash. Draco sighed sadly. A
Draco breathed, and Harry chuckled at him, nodding.
“You’re an idiot,” Draco snapped, glaring, because manners were a privilege Harry had once gained and had since lost. Weightless snowflakes sparkled in his plait of almost-white hair, glowing in the sconcelight of Harry’s doorstep.
Diagon Alley was a wondrous place to be as an invisible person. Harry could actually see the sights and take his time, since he didn’t have to keep his head down and hurry along to avoid paparazzi.
He tucked his feet up under him on the chair, and allowed himself to relax for the first time that day, sipping his luxurious hot chocolate, until Harry turned the notebook on him again.
He’d rage and rant that the prat should have just asked him to go for a pint, instead, like a normal person. He wouldn’t want anything to do with someone like that.
over something he
“I know you’re working with Harry,” he declared.
“The last breadcrumb was a memory of Kingsley, erm… convincing me to help him out.”
Draco, trying to
“Of course she did,” Draco threw his head back, laughing some more. “Merlin, Harry,” he breathed, wiping a tear from his eye. “You never do a thing halfway, do you?”
“Do it, Harry,” he mumbled.
“Have you ever been successful at Occlumency?” Draco asked.
“Wait a minute…” He frowned at Harry. “How did you use the floo if you couldn’t call out the destination?”
“You were successful, however or whatever you did,” Draco added. “I feel much better.”
“Circe’s sagging
But Harry had at least believed him, and trusted him. And Draco trusted Harry, too, after being taken care of like that, and having Harry prove that he was safe, in their agreed sanctuary, even when he was terrified. Draco felt the trust almost as a physical thing, between them, an imaginary rope being braided with more strands of experience every time they interacted, growing stronger with each addition.
He flicked his wrist quickly as he approached the office, and the door banged open violently, causing the occupant to yelp in alarm.
Harry couldn’t answer. He tried and tried and tried.
He didn’t know how to tell him that Death was nothing to be afraid of. That he’d died and come back to life thousands of times, that Harry had witnessed every reincarnation of him, and had loved him all the more for it. He wasn’t sure how to say that not even Death could separate them, that he’d crawl out of the earth for him, they never were able to stay away from each other. That Draco would search relentlessly for him in the next life, and the next. They were inevitable, a force of nature more powerful than Death.
They slowed as the song started to come to an end. Draco was panting, at that point—that dance was
He sat down on the bed, dropping his face into his hands.
Lucius snapped his head back to Draco, eyeing him suspiciously, thrusting his wand back in Draco’s face.
Harry climbed off when he heard that quiet sound from Draco’s throat, grinning from ear to ear at the sight of Draco’s apparent dismay.
“I’m really not one for
“I want to ask if that’s even real, but I know it is, I just fucking saw it,” Draco muttered, jaw clenched. Harry watched him silently with wide eyes, his body tense. Draco couldn’t stand it.
“What do you mean,
“Yes, thank you for your invaluable insight,
Draco looked up after a moment, seeing Harry’s notebook facing him. Harry delighted in the small, tired smile it produced on his face.
The circular room he entered was incredibly dark, with only candles of dim blue flame adorning the walls between the many, identical doors. As soon as the door shut behind him, the walls began to spin very fast, causing the blue light to blur around him, so there was no way to tell from which door he’d entered. He clicked his tongue in annoyance.
“Yes…?” Ron frowned. Hermione looked up, confused by the interaction, her shrewd brown eyes darting between Harry’s now horrified face and Ron’s exasperated one.
“Someone else called it out for you?” Draco questioned, and Harry nodded. “Interesting.”

After only a second of hesitation, he picked up the frame and pulled out the photograph. He folded it carefully and slipped that into his pocket, as well.
It had just been so long, since someone had asked. He’d
The silvery glow vanished, and memories swirled around him haphazardly, almost desperately, disorienting him. Draco cursed under his breath. “Lost it,” he grumbled. “Hang on, I’ll find it…”
“But other than that, Harry didn’t go very deep into conversations. Anyone that showed interest gave up after enough of Harry’s evasions and rejections, and those people always had more people around to talk to. The only link I could find with any of them was that he was stared at, pretty frequently, by one person alone somewhere in the bar. But, it was always a different person. We think it may have been polyjuice, but there’s nothing else to suggest they were all the same person—just the uncomfortable staring.” Ron shuddered.
“Draco—”
“You’re a menace,” Harry declared, sitting up and grabbing for Draco, who darted away. Still laughing, Harry’s eyes scrunched up so much they were nearly closed. “Come here, let me hold you.”
Harry’s magic finally returned to him, its job finished, and he released Draco’s wrists, opening his eyes.
Narcissa’s face contorted as she tried to suppress sobs, not wanting to break down in public, not wanting to wake the child in her lap.
Finally, he felt something close in his spell, like drawing a curtain shut, and the black door in front of him disappeared. Harry lowered his wand and glanced over at Kingsley, who looked a bit battered as he turned to face Harry, wiping a bit of sweat off his own shiny forehead.
Harry watched his shadow pass back and forth in the strip of light under Draco’s bedroom door. Occasionally, it would stop, and if Harry listened hard, he could hear the soft scritching of a quill on parchment.
“Thank you,” Harry said.
Smith and Kingsley each took hold of a strand with their wands, all three faces frowning in concentration as they tugged, threaded, turned, and wrested the strands from each other and the parchment. The bonds looked almost alive, the way they resisted and fought against their handlers. Harry was reminded suddenly of Slytherin’s locket, around his neck in an icy pond, and his wand hand twitched with the impulse to destroy it all.
if he found out he and Draco were pushed together against his will by someone who claimed they knew best. His childhood was thrown away by a prophecy, it was completely unfair that another should follow him into adulthood. He’d been a pawn for most of his life, and probably valued his free will and independence greatly, now that he had it.
“A man who cooks,” Draco noted, raising an impressed eyebrow. “And who is unnaturally eager to spend time with me.” He spooned out the tea, portioning it carefully into small sachets.
“Then I think we’ll be alright. We’ve got no other option.” Ron moved to the center of the room, raising his wand and aiming it at one of the doors. “Three teams: Harrison, Bones, Stanley, take a door. Shacklebolt, Jeffries, you’re with me, and Harry, you’ve got those two, as you’ve
“I shouldn’t have been able to see that memory, from where I stood on the edge of his mind. That spell only lets me look at the mind as a whole, so I can see where there might be missing parts or pieces not connecting. But when I found the empty spot, and tried to tug it to his conscious mind, it dragged me in.” Malfoy took a deep breath, releasing more tension from his limbs. “It made me experience it, and I believe that was intentional on the part of the caster. It

Harry hoped that Hermione was taking her copious mental notes, because things were starting to not make sense. Why did Draco look so apprehensive at that last sentence? Weren’t unconscious minds just sleepy and boring? Harry’d been unconscious plenty of times, it’d never been very exciting.

and the laughter increased. He snapped his head up to find Draco Malfoy rolling on the hard stone where the eagle had been, clutching his abdomen,
what am I not getting, here?” Hermione nearly shouted, clearly frustrated with the lack of knowledge. Ron looked at her, the shock of the latest revelation still evident on his face, and cast a quick
Narcissa choked on a sob, and her breaths were heaving.
A giggle bubbled helplessly out of Harry’s throat, but Harry slid his hand to the back of Malfoy’s neck and kissed him right back.
“Well, let’s go for a fly then, I’ll introduce you to the property.”
The following Tuesday, Harry left work early, much to Ron’s surprise—especially for

“I’m sure he would be speechless,” Harry said.
Draco tripped over a body; Harry caught him by the waist and kept them moving. Another body, Harry practically lifted Draco over it, Draco's legs felt so weak and useless, another body, face bloodied beyond recognition, another—
“Got hungry,” Potter mumbles, stuffing his cigarette-less hands in his pockets. Draco can’t suppress a huff of nervous laughter.
“I beg to differ, this song is

“If you insist, though I’ll admit I prefer the other way around.”
Harry snorted, and Draco glared at them both.
The dark eyes watched him cautiously as he slowly dragged his body across the floor, feeling like a flobberworm. By the time he finally leaned himself against the wall, he was completely winded, holding his head against the waves of nausea. This reminded him of—of Harry, of Harry in a muggle pub, with a wand pointed at his head…
He didn’t run when he reached the Atrium, because a Malfoy running was always cause for alarm, and arrest would not help his current situation in the least. He still crossed the floor as quickly as he could toward the line of outgoing floos.
album on top of the record player as they passed by the sitting room after lunch, and had given Draco a perplexed look, shaking his head in clear disapproval. Draco had picked up on the age old muggle-boy-band debate with great enthusiasm—it was one of his favourite things to argue about with Pansy, when they felt like being extra dramatic.
“You want the long answer?” Draco asked, smirking. Harry nodded sheepishly. He was so easy to read. Draco sat up fully, rolling his pale wand between his slender fingers. Harry watched his hands, his face intent and curious.
“Until then, Harry.” The corner of Draco’s lips turned up as he opened the door, and Harry gave him a quick smile, before stepping out. Draco closed the door after him, knowing he wouldn’t hear a goodbye of any sort. It was indeed odd to say goodbye to someone without hearing it in return.
“You didn’t tell us that,” Ron said.
“No,” Draco said fiercely. Harry believed him. This was so unnecessary. But Draco had fucking
where Draco was and with whom before they tear down the entire country looking for him.
Draco. Completely exploded on him. Ron had to hold me back from punching him, though it looked like he wanted to, too. I threw my badge at him and left. In front of everyone. Which means it’s going to be in the papers tomorrow, and I’m so sorry—” Harry’s eyes flew open, taking Draco’s trembling hand in both of his. “Draco. Darling, you’re shaking.”
“Stalking Malfoy,” Ron answered lightly. Hermione hummed, nodding in agreement. Harry frowned.
Probably because Draco was thinking it, too.
Harry watched Malfoy’s expression, careful not to make eye contact again,
that power somehow, trapped in Draco’s head—
He closed his eyes and leaned his hands on the counter, the cooling sweat on his bare chest and back making him shiver all over again. The horrific images started to replay behind his eyelids, and he opened his eyes quickly to dispel them, deciding to stare mindlessly at the clock on the hob instead.
As his cackles faded, he twined his fingers in the singed grass beneath him, and thought of Draco, of Ron and Hermione, of Teddy and Andromeda and the Weasleys, even the overly-polite Malfoy house elves. He breathed in the smell of ozone and rain and the acrid scent of a doused campfire. He listened to the quiet of night, the buzz of insects, the hush of a gentle breeze. The moon shone bright above him, peeking through retreating clouds—almost close enough to touch.
“Where’s Ha—” he tried, but his gut twisted with discomfort and he nearly choked on the words. Honestly, he couldn’t even mention Harry’s name? Hadn’t these people already gotten Harry’s consent to know about his condition? Ron was looking at him oddly as Draco rubbed his stomach with a grimace, cleared his throat, and tried a different tactic.
“Are you alright?” Harry croaked. She clicked her tongue at him, flicking him gently on the forehead. It was bizarre to experience those things audibly and tangibly.
“Is that Oscar the Grouch?” Draco asked, with a small gesture towards the fuzzy green creature. She looked up at him in surprise, both of her brown eyes now visible, little face framed by the full head of wild, curly hair. She nodded vigorously.
That’s
Narcissa wasn’t his responsibility anymore, but he ran to his floo when he heard the firecall chime, so Ron could give him updates.
“Nagini was nightmarish enough as a snake,” Draco shuddered. “She had to go put on an old woman like a bloody coat,” he muttered, grimacing in disgust. Harry’s lips quirked at Draco’s wording, but he shuddered as well. It had happened to him, after all.
to take Harry’s case—the Healers had been quite adamant that “the Specialist'' was usually booked for months out. Harry was curious as to why he’d agreed to do this at all, but maybe he’d find that out, eventually. They were going to be working together very closely, for
“Oh, I’m not letting
“Lily’s love, her protection, in his blood,” Draco’s voice replied, and he was able to hold on to it for one small moment:
“It’s an excellent broom, perfect for covering long distances at high speeds. Its maneuverability suffers for it, though,” Draco commented, moving them on to the next memory.
Hermione narrowed her eyes at him, and then at Harry, so Draco quickly moved on to prevent another scolding tangent.
“Wands up, on three,” Ron called, once everyone had their wand aimed at a door. “One, two, three—”
Draco retreated from Harry’s head, and did not bother with another dot on the board. His body was shaking, a physical reaction to buried emotions he couldn’t control. He let his Occlumency walls down slowly, but even at the gradual pace, by the time they were fully down, Draco was
The corner of Harry’s lips turned up in a smirk. He gave an exaggerated nod, reminding Draco of one of his old tutors, when he had finally understood a difficult lesson as a child.
him. And I’m going to guess, since you probably couldn’t speak and were in the middle of a session, that Draco saw something in your head that made him upset, and that prat knows exactly how to get under your skin, so he said things that pissed you off enough that you attacked him.”
“If Draco had tried to defend himself at all, his bonds would have revolted,” Hermione said quietly, and one of the mugs of cold tea on the table shattered. She whipped her head around to glare at Harry.
“This attacker seemed quite confident that everything would work out as they’d planned. They

Harry hadn’t wanted to risk hurting the magical folk of Copenhagen, but his potion supply was dwindling rapidly, and he wouldn’t be able to acquire them on the island of Azkaban. He’d needed to bribe the brewer with a sizable chunk of his Gringotts vault, but it had to be done.
Strong hands found Harry’s waist immediately, turning him around until he was once more nose to nose with Draco Malfoy. Harry smiled again at the hunger in his grey eyes, which he knew was mirrored in his own.
dancing, his hips swaying subtly to the music playing from the wireless, every movement of his hands ending with a flourish.
Draco led him along the narrow trail, deeper into the trees. They could only see a few feet in either direction through the fog, but Draco knew the way innately, and the trail was easy enough to follow. They walked on, over gnarled, weathered roots and a tiny, bubbling creek. The clouds on the ground gave off an eerie feeling, rolling over the bright green grass that sprouted from the undergrowth, the trunks of crooked, moss-covered trees emerging out of the cool grey mist with every step.

“You’re different,” Malfoy said, instead of a greeting, because manners were a privilege Harry apparently hadn’t earned.
Harry had imagined the garden at Malfoy’s “place” to look like something prim and proper and precise, like the Dursley’s garden, but much more expensive. He’d expected white peacocks and those unnerving shrubs trimmed to look like majestic creatures. And probably a koi pond with a cherubic fountain and ornately carved marble benches, where one could sit leisurely and read their pureblood genealogies in the sunshine.

“Are you going to keep standing there like an idiot, or are you going to do something about it?”
Harry was guiding them along again, remembering it all on his own. Draco was glad to see he wasn’t too tired from their earlier ventures.
Weasley seemed amused by his jab, but his ears were a little red. “Thank you for your help, Healer Malfoy,” he nodded at Draco.
“I did some research on bonds like that, after that night,” Hermione brightened a little at the relief of being able to provide cold, hard facts. “They’re rare, quite out of fashion these days, because they’re so subjective—ethics is such a murky subject, and no one really knows where the line is, so they just cause a range of discomfort, based on the ‘severity of the offense:’ described as a mild, gut twisting sensation for the least unscrupulous, and Cruciatus level pain for the most—which would probably be for causing intentional harm, in this case, or ‘behaving inappropriately’ with a patient or something…”
Harry frowned. “No,” he answered, but paused, thinking of those he’d lost. “I mean, not really. But it hurt Voldemort a
He heard a door slam, and a muffled yell, followed by the distant sound of someone furiously pounding on a door, but the energy was only increasing, the air around him growing heavier, sweeter, like summer, like rain,
made him throw his pureblood training out the window and
Harry leaned forward and gently pulled Draco’s hands away from his waist. The potion was in his blood, Harry knew that much. He could see the veins clearly through the pale skin on Draco’s wrist, could feel the pulse racing beneath his touch. This might not even work, but in the worst case scenario, Draco would just feel a little feverish, and probably tease Harry about his pathetic attempts later. At least Harry could say he had tried.
“Doubtful,” Draco said, turning in his arms. “I was forced to watch that performance at the Yule Ball, with the rest of the bloody school.”
“You’re a bloody wizard, Potter,” Draco countered, and Harry conceded the point.
Smith stared at him in disbelief for a moment before rearranging his face into a contemptuous glare.
“Aurors, Licensers and Wizengamot of the Ministry of Magic.” Draco’s voice was small, hoping to be able to dissociate himself from this moment and ride it out. At least the pain in his gut was subsiding.
Draco hesitated again, but thought of his mother, and hardened his resolve.
Draco flinched harshly when the door of the cell opened, curling into himself in the corner of the tiny room. Nothing good happened when that door opened.
He stumbled out of Kingsley’s fireplace, absently brushing ashes off his navy uniform. He never did learn how to leave a floo correctly.
Teddy and Andromeda might enjoy a visit from him. Teddy could talk enough for three people, he wouldn’t mind Harry’s silence.
“I had a choice, too.”
Draco gasped, withdrawing himself, finally, with an audible groan of pain and relief and every emotion he hadn’t had time to feel. He shuddered violently, his face wet with tears and sweat, his hand gripping Harry’s tightly—this time, it was he who thought Harry might disappear, and held on for dear life.
“From whom?” Narcissa asked, looking bewildered. The witch shrugged. Harry stood immediately.
were in a small area of the top left corner, and next to that were the incantations of the attacker’s curse. But underneath those, Draco had begun the map of breadcrumbs, a long row of labeled dots connected by a single line. There was still a significant amount of empty space beneath it, nearly the entire bottom half of the board, which is where Draco placed the tip of his piece of chalk. He transcribed the mess of glowing dots as closely as he could from his memory, crouched on one knee in front of the wall.
Harry
Ron looked at him warily. “The
“Happy.”
Harry’s cheeks pinked, and his eyes darted to the side, apparently embarrassed. He shook his head a few times.
Harry’s mouth went dry, a huge fist clenching around his ribs.
“Of course—they’re in the same class—that’s not necessary—“ Hermione was flustered, and no one could tell if Parkinson was serious or not.
1:27.
Draco recognized his tone as one he used when he was about to waffle on about his own excellence for a while. When Draco was young, Lucius would pepper these lectures with phrases like,
Draco scribbled some more notes in his notebook. Finally, unable to help herself, Granger spoke up.
you pretending?” Draco released his wrists. Harry’s hands immediately found his face, gathering all that soft hair out of the way of Draco’s lips.
Harry was a terrible liar.
As he stared at the swirls of amber in the mugs, he felt arms wrap around his waist from behind, a warm chest pressing against his back, a nose at the nape of his neck. He pulled Draco’s arms tighter around him, letting his warmth and strength enfold him. Draco pressed his lips to the knob at the top of Harry’s spine, taking a deep breath that sent goosebumps over Harry’s skin.
and on discord @louisfake !
Harry chuckled. “Ron’s gone into town, to see what he can find out from the villagers.”
He woke suddenly in the middle of the night, his abdomen wracked with spasms that shot through his limbs. He tried futilely not to cry out in pain, maybe this was it,
“Do you like falafel?” Draco asks, surprising himself with how clear his words are. He almost sounds sober
Draco thought, dejected.
“Keep it together, Harry, we’ll need your head clear if we’re going to find him,” she ordered impatiently as she swished her wand at the table to vanish the mess. Harry worked on his breathing, in and out, remembering Draco’s low, quiet voice in his head:
he scrawled quickly, just in case, folding up the paper into a tiny square, hurrying to the window and opening it, praying that Bubo was around, feeling like he was about to crawl out of his skin—
just to torment him in school—mostly because it had absolutely infuriated Pot—Harry, which was always a thrill, but
“And I want—” Draco squeezed his eyes shut, Harry’s happiness burning like an afterimage on the inside of his eyelids.
“That’s understandable. I’d probably break a few things if I had to watch your life at the Dursley’s,” Hermione said, as if this was a simple fact, before furrowing her brows again. “What was wrong with your letter?”
As they came down from their giddiness, Draco motioned towards the chairs by the small fire, sighing. “Let’s finish up seventh year, shall we?”
The drinks, however, were delicious, despite Draco’s apparent slights.
Draco straightens up, taking a deep, bracing breath. Potter clicks his tongue, apparently unhappy about being ignored.
“Well, I’ve good news for you, lad,” Kramer replied with an easy grin. “We’re looking for someone who is eager to simply
Harry did
“Okay, you’re right, erm…” Hermione looked at Ron, who only sat back in his chair, picking up his mug from the table.
Oh, there went that last scrap of self control he’d been holding on to. In a blur of movement, Smith was pinned to his chair, Harry’s wand blistering hot at his throat. He was hit suddenly with the memory of Draco’s throat under his wand, just like this, and he pushed it aside forcefully to focus on the task at hand.
Draco released the breath he had been holding, and hoped his gratitude showed in his eyes, because he’d given up too much of his pride in one day to say ‘Thank you’ out loud to Harry Potter, after that. He raised his wand again, slowly.
“Of course you didn’t! But when has something you
Worst of all, he hadn’t wanted to interact with Draco in the first place. If Harry thought someone
And then the cackling stopped, too suddenly, with a sharp gasp, a quiet yelp. Harry felt the world moving in slow motion as Teddy turned too hard and toppled, twenty feet off the ground, his youthful face pale with shock, the broom slipping out from between his knees. Harry’s stomach dropped, his wand couldn’t raise fast enough—
“Don’t worry, Rose. I’ll investigate, and make sure that wherever Camila got them, they have them in your size.” Draco wiggled his feet goofily, but his tone was serious, as if this was a life or death mission. It was true—he would absolutely tear down the city of London to find this little witch some Oscar the Grouch slippers. Because he was a pathetically tender-hearted fool around children, and they always made him want to spend all of his money on silly things to make them happy. Maybe he was just excited that they weren’t growing up during a war, or that they weren’t being bred to carry on a mantle of political and social power, or that they didn’t lead angry mobs against him when he was still a teenager, or that they weren’t like him at all… kids these days were
“Timsy, Pansy, and my mother, though not as often as I should. Minister Shacklebolt, occasionally. The staff of the Curse Damage ward at St. Mungo’s, when we collaborate.” Draco paused, but the potion made him continue. “There’s a muggle bakery called Sweet Nothings, in London, I’m friendly with the folks there. I buy their baklava regularly, because Timsy loves it.”
“I want you to be safe,” he replied. “I want you to thrive.”
“Six months.”
He turned around to face the room.
“To anyone else, maybe,” Harry mumbled, frowning at the trodden path in front of him. Little white flowers were sprouting from the ground on either side of them, reaching for the specks of sunlight falling in through the canopy.
“Cleaned what?” Harry asked. Malfoy crossed his arms, nodding to the blanket in Harry’s hand.

Hermione tsked at him, rolling her eyes.
Harry didn’t even know how to finish that, too stunned to think clearly. His little human brain was empty except for

“Just some of the tiny ones, and a lot of cartilage, and nerves—her organs are mostly there, but it’s all a little off. It looks like a big Transfiguration accident, basically. Which, I guess, it is.” She holstered her wand and gave Harry a sharp look.
Draco nodded again in acknowledgement. It was a small comfort knowing he wouldn’t get any awkward conversation from Potter today. Two-thirds of the Golden Trio thanking him was quite enough for one day.
Harry’s hands squeezed his own knees, trying to stay present, trying to remember how to breathe.
“So.” Harry smiled down at Draco, easy and bright. “I very loudly and decisively left my job, and you’ve been creating the perfect nest of fashionable hair accessories. What a pair we are.”
He felt cold with dread and revulsion.
Willem marched back into the cockpit and started rummaging through Harry’s bag. He came back out and hurried up to the bow, handing Harry his wand.
Malfoy tried to glare, but it didn’t work, with the corners of his lips pulling up in a reluctantly amused smirk. He descended the staircase with such grace, Harry wasn’t sure if his feet even touched the wood. His hand didn’t drag on the bannister, either, and Harry wondered if obscenely rich purebloods were just raised like this: to take up as much space as the entirety of their bloodline, but leave no footprints of their own.
he reminded himself. The first song was great, yes, but he still had seven more tracks ahead of him. He ran the polishing rag slowly along the grain of the wood, filling in any scratches, caring for it meticulously, as he always did.
Harry said nothing, of course, didn’t move his head an inch, didn’t take his eyes off of Draco’s—so fucking green, so
“As a Healer, I have to make sure you consent to Weasley and Granger hearing this as well.”
Outside of the Pensieve, Draco removed his hand from his wand and took in the scene. Harry and Hermione hadn’t moved, but they were glaring at each other in silence. Hermione’s hand was raised in a vague gesture, and Harry’s arms were crossed over his chest, looking petulant. They had clearly interrupted something.
Harry imagined a mother hovering over a child with spattergroit, then chastised himself for it, because she was not his mother. She was someone Harry owed a life debt to, and she was the mother of the man Harry loved.
Draco nodded, raising his hands tentatively to rest on Harry’s shoulders. His face felt too hot. Harry’s lips twitched in a hesitant, nervous smile, and Draco’s stomach fluttered.

It could have easily looked a mess, and led to a ramshackle hut that housed an eccentric old wizard who wore only animal skins. It

Of course that involved bloody
“Yes, Bellatrix could perform Legilimency. But she used it as an attack, as torture. She thought it was fun, the pain she could cause like that. I was her favourite mind to dig through, and she lived in my house for over two years.” Draco met Potter’s eyes, clenching his hands on the notebook to keep them from shaking. They always shook when he had to talk about the War. But he had to.
Before he knew it, his two hours were up. He got to his feet with a sigh, deciding to be helpful, and carried his cold, empty mug and the pristine tea over to the counter. He breathed in that oddly soothing fragrance as he went, almost tempted to take the cup with him and dash.
Draco had invited Timsy to join them, mentioning the kheer Ron had brought, which made Hermione stare at him in wonder. Timsy politely declined, but did steal away with the kheer. Rose got up again, just as food was put in front of her, distracted by the record player, and Draco joined her, helping her pick out a record for them to play while they ate. Rose chose
“Do you feel ready to begin?” Draco asked, and Harry eyed him for a moment more before putting his notebook down on the side table, sitting up and readying himself for the work.
“It’s not a lighthouse,” he said.
It played over and over in his head, like a broken record.
you didn’t—”
Harry found Head Unspeakable Kramer not in his office, as he’d expected, but in the Pensieve Room.
Harry stepped up next to him—Draco started, he hadn’t even heard him move—and frowned at the jumble of thirteen white chalk dots, eyebrows furrowed in concentration. Draco watched him, wondering if he’d recognize any pattern of his own. It was his own mind, after all. But Harry looked as confused as Draco did, running a hand through his wild hair in frustration, pushing it up off of his forehead—
Draco smiled. Timsy’s days off were rare, and no matter how much he encouraged them, Timsy always felt like he had to fight about it, a little.
Draco stood alone in his study, staring at his empty Pensieve inside its cabinet. He picked up an empty vial from a shelf full of memories.
His hand stopped glowing and reached for his own chest, wrapping around the hard metal key that still dangled from his neck, feeling its jagged edges like a serrated knife against his palm.
him, with a force stronger and more terrifying than anything Harry’s ever experienced. And Draco knows this, now, Harry can tell, because his face pales and his eyes widen with fear, and he does what he always does when he can’t face the tension that stretches taut between them: he talks.
The Church of Our Saviour—aptly named, Harry thought, matching Narcissa’s tangible morbid amusement—stood tall and distinguished in the middle of the city, its many bells ringing out hymns on the hour. Harry’s eyes followed the spiral staircase winding up the outside of the spire, landing on the golden globe at its tip, topped with what must have been a massive statue of a triumphant Jesus Christ, keeping careful watch over the city of Copenhagen.
When Harry finally deemed himself ready, Draco lifted his wand once more, and cast himself into Harry’s head.
Potter, who had been listening intently, jerked back at these last words. His face was shocked, then frightened, then enraged, so quickly Draco had trouble keeping up. He couldn’t for the life of him figure out what he’d done wrong already.
Ron kept staring at him, causing Harry to squirm in his chair.
The mediwix all swallowed nervously, and apparently found Harry too frightening to argue with. With that settled, Harry nodded.

and could hear him pacing in his room, could see his shadow pass back and forth in the dim light under the door.
Azkaban was as hungry for Harry as Harry’s magical core was for it. Harry could barely stand by the time he’d absorbed enough magic for a tap, and it only took a week and a half. It felt like Azkaban could barely stand, either. The Warden had tried to come by and scold him for whatever he was doing to the structure, but he’d felt it as soon as he entered Harry’s corridor—Harry hoped he’d made it to his quarters before passing out.
But it was

Harry was already sitting in his wingback chair by the fire, eyes closed and hands folded over his stomach, looking quite at ease, if it weren’t for the slight crease between his brows. He opened his eyes as Draco sat down, and watched him warily. Draco hated that he’d made Harry feel like this. What was he
“I reckon he had a bit of a crush on you,” Harry teased. Hermione covered her mouth with her hand to hide her giggles. Narcissa blushed harder.
“What have you done to me?” Draco whispered, gasping as Harry pulled back his hair to expose his throat.
How was he supposed to explain himself? His eyes darted nervously around the garden, lingering on Draco’s magnolia tree. He shifted uncomfortably on his feet, feeling incredibly small.
in a room full of Gryffindors, and so what if he’d spent most of his time this morning overthinking his sartorial choices? Draco had to look his best, had to show the world (his former enemies) that he was a confident, competent, (devastatingly handsome) Healer, before he even spoke. His sleek hair was swept artfully away from his face, not slicked rigidly back like it was in school, and certainly not the rat’s nest it was this morning.
And it had always been Draco, who could pull a reaction out of him, who could spark the fire in him.
“Alright, I did, but listen!” Harry held up his hands appeasingly. Draco groaned in exasperation, backing away with a dramatic eye roll. “Listen, she
, too. It felt like the thrilling, precarious balance between the two, that stripped him down to his very essence, his basest instinct.
“I feel one,” Parkinson muttered, twisting her wand slowly with her wrist, and a thin, white, glowing strand was pulled from the parchment, out of the seal of runes. But as she pulled, it dragged out a mess of more strands, twitching and curling, all tangled together like a knot of living yarn. Parkinson clicked her tongue in annoyance.
Draco’s brows creased further. He was getting agitated. “Learn what?”
“How long are you going to stay here, Harry?” Draco asked, his lips barely moving, as if he were falling asleep again on Harry’s shoulder. “We both know you’re not here for my ‘protection.’”
Harry stepped inside, giving Timsy a grateful nod. He opened his mouth to ask where Draco was, but Timsy beat him to it.
“Any other day, Harry,” Ron murmured in his ear. “Not today.”
It was the only time Harry had ever lost a game of Quidditch to Draco Malfoy, and his blood was

Something small and warm landed on his hand, and he looked down to see a blur of Hermione’s hand covering his own. Embarrassed, he sat back down and ripped off his glasses, hastily wiping his eyes.
“I have

“I don’t have a Snitch at the moment,” Draco replied, and it was truly bizarre how he could just understand what Harry was trying to say, without actually reading his thoughts. “The last one I had, erm… got away from me.” He chuckled to himself. “But that’s what I get for playing a solo Seeker’s game in the middle of the night. We can just fly for today.”

He left the room without another glance, and breathed.
Harry was fuming, nostrils flaring as he followed Draco’s furious pacing with his eyes. The books were shaking on the shelves. Draco thought he could hear the chalkboard vibrating.
Harry nodded his assent, and Draco took a deep breath.
Harry looked around as their after-dinner conversations petered out, his chest nearly glowing with warmth and contentment. He hoped Rose could feel it, curled up as she was, and that it was giving her happy dreams.
Draco's vision blurred. He felt sick. He slipped on a puddle of blood, trying to keep his knees from buckling. "Harry—"
“Fine,” he sighed. “I’m dying to know how the bloody hell you survived basilisk venom.”

these potions. Carrying around ground unicorn hoof and acromantula venom and a number of other things he didn’t understand, but knew could kill him, was his only task for this particular portion of the project.
Malfoy
“It’s alright, Boran,” he forced out through his teeth, panicking against his captivity, terrified for whatever Lucius had planned, “it’s gonna be okay—”
Ron asked dangerously, not taking his eyes off of Harry, who was only staring straight at Draco. Draco raised his hands, conciliating.
She looked away, picking lint off her skirt. “They’re abhorrent,” she said, her face tense. “You should not have had to stay with them. Ever.” She took a deep, calming breath before she met Harry’s eyes again.

“Sounds right up your alley, Potter,” he grumbled. “You always excelled at being useless and creepy.”
Unfortunately, whatever was happening was happening at Harry’s favorite pub.

and you were left alone in it.”
“I see one coming up,” Draco mumbled. “Hang on.” He focused more power through his wand, and latched on.
“No need to apologize,” Draco said, even though he hated being caught off guard. “I was happy to meet them.”
Hermione furrowed her brows. “I told you, Harry—Draco was bound in order to obtain his Healer License.”
“Your letter, Harry,” Draco said firmly. Behind him, something heavy hit the floor. Draco didn’t notice. “Your letter was addressed to you, in the Cupboard Under the Stairs. In McGonagall’s handwriting, in her favourite green ink. They
“It smells like that, too, like a thunderstorm on summer grass, like ozone in the air, and erm…” he huffed an embarrassed laugh, eyes closed. “Like treacle, if I’m honest—syrupy and sweet. It’s warm, and thick, like…” He paused and bit his lip, choosing not to disclose how comforting it could be, how it felt like curling in front of the fire at home after a long day, or putting on his fuzzy green slippers. He moved on, opening his eyes and looking closely at the edges of Harry’s body, his hands.
“What happened, darling?”
Harry’s head snapped up to look at him, as if he had just remembered Draco was there. He shook his head hastily, removing his hand from his face.
“What do you mean? It’s half noon!”
A tile shifted under his foot as he inspected the wrought iron sconces. He looked down, nudging it with the toe of his boot.
Narcissa,” Harry snarled, and Ron’s grip tightened on his arm. “Lucius
“It sounds like Snape taught you similarly to how Bellatrix taught me,” Draco guessed, and Harry grimaced. “It’s obviously not the best way to learn.”
“What, you’ve never seen blood wards before?” Draco scoffed weakly.
“Feeling better?” Draco asked, his voice tight, and Harry gave a little satisfied smile with his single, short nod. Draco looked away. “Excellent. Timsy’s prepared roast beef sandwiches, I believe,” he said, glad to finally be able to fill the silence, to distract from his incomprehensible discomfort. He swung his legs over the side of the couch, standing in a single, graceful movement. He made his way towards the kitchen, hearing Harry follow him, not bothering to look back.
Harry conceded the point, but it didn’t curb his anxiety—as the chilly days of November passed, Narcissa grew more and more reserved. She tired quicker on their walks and started having dizzy spells. Her magic would respond to her, but the spells grew weaker the more they practiced.
“That this is normal.” Draco’s hand slid under Harry’s shirt, above the jut of his hip, as if just the feel of his skin was a comfort. “That my mother is fine. That you’re here because you want to be. Can you imagine it?”
He dropped it beneath the collar of his shirt, then continued on.
in an instinctual way. Of course,
Harry stepped forward and tried every unlocking charm he knew on one of the doors. When it didn’t budge, he moved to the next, and the next.
“I love you,” Harry said, still giggling, overflowing with impossible happiness, and Draco kissed him hard, knowing Harry would understand it was an

“Shocking,” Malfoy grumbled.
Draco closed his eyes, sagging. “I’m not shutting you out, Harry. I’m shutting me
Harry, and she doesn’t give a damn that you’re the sodding Saviour, or that you’re not married yet or that you have a demanding career, or that you’re at a different place in your life than those around you, now that you have the time to figure it out without a bloody prophecy hanging over your head. What matters to her, and her parents, is that you’re Harry, and that you’re there with them.”
“Can I tell you a secret?”
“I’ve already had two cups this morning,” Draco offered. Conversation had to start somewhere, he figured, even if it was doomed to be one-sided, what with Potter being mute. “As much as I want to—Timsy’s coffee is incredible—having any more than that would make me a very twitchy, ineffective Healer.”
Harry feels like he is fighting everyone and everything—fighting dementors to survive, fighting his friends about keeping him in the dark, fighting the adults for keeping him out of the Order of the Phoenix, fighting the Wizengamot to be able to go back to school, fighting Dumbledore for ignoring him, fighting the public for not believing him… Draco buckled down, knowing that Harry will probably feel this way for a

—but didn’t question it. Narcissa clearly loved visiting with her sister and grand-nephew, and without her husband’s correspondence, Draco wanted her to have company whenever possible.
They stopped in front of Narcissa’s room, peering through the small window in the door. Draco’s breath hitched the moment he saw her, fragile and pale and unconscious in the hospital bed. He seemed frozen, his jaw clenched and tense, unable to move any further.
That’s what Harry would have chosen, anyway. If he could have tea with his mum. Just once.
“Absolutely not,” Draco cut her off. “You’re not going anywhere until you're fully healed, and I’m
“As well as we can, I suppose.” It wasn’t technically a lie.
But for some reason, a world where Harry Potter didn’t previously loathe Draco Malfoy, and vice versa, was frightening, and Draco couldn’t make himself accept it. It felt dangerous to him, like standing on a cliff, and being told everything about the fatal drop to the jagged rocks below would be absolutely fine. It was too precarious, and against his common sense. His characteristic Slytherin self-preservation was winning out, and his gut told him to back away from the edge, so he did. He sighed and closed his eyes to collect himself, and to protect himself from Harry’s penetrating gaze.
The blood was quickly draining from Harry’s face. Pieces were clicking together in his mind: Draco clutching his stomach with a grimace of discomfort after looking at Harry sometimes, Draco’s face twisted in pain while describing a fantasy on Veritaserum, Draco doubling over after—
“We’re sure, Harrison, and if you or anyone else is going to doubt us, you can leave right now. We have no time to debate this, and I have no patience to deal with any prejudice while lives are in danger.”
“I do,” he mumbled. “They’re softer than a pygmy puff.”
Lucius lifted his wand to his own head, giving Draco a brief respite, and Draco saw the wicked gleam in his eyes just before the heavy Disillusionment Charm melted over his body. He heard Boran whimper behind him—an invisible enemy was much scarier than a visible one.
“I met your godson, yesterday,” Draco mentioned as they settled themselves in their usual chairs. He wondered idly if he’d ever see that chair as anything other than
Kingsley frowned. “What do you mean?”
Except for Narcissa, of course.
The rustle of sheets as Scorpius climbed back into bed, a creak of wood as Harry settled against the headboard with another long-suffering sigh, the susurration of old pages flipping quickly.
“I quit the Unspeakables,” Harry said in a rush. “And I—it took me longer than I thought, but...” he opened his eyes to find Draco’s staring back at him, shining and anguished, but Harry saw relief, there, too. He took a deep breath.
“It’s alright,” Draco said, his own emotions tucked carefully away to deal with later. “Let them come, let them drift. I’m going to add more power, see if you can pick out my presence.” He concentrated, and felt more energy flow through his wrist. Harry gasped softly.
then, how do you think this will go?” Draco argued. “‘Welcome, people whom I used to bully relentlessly. Please, come sit in my garden, let us reminisce about the
“Draco—”
“Oh,” Draco breathed, the gears turning in his mind. He sat back for a moment, taking off his glasses, eyes closed as he worked on solving this particular puzzle.
Draco leaned in, touching his forehead to Harry’s. Harry let out a shuddering breath, clenching his hands on his own legs to keep from reaching for him, pulling him in.
He let out a soft, surprised huff of laughter when he recognized the feeling of arousal. How long had it been, that it could feel so foreign?
Harry looked thoughtful. He twirled his pen around in his fingers.
There was a small clattering noise as the booth spit out a nametag in the coin return slot. Draco took it out and examined it as the floor of the booth lurched, and started descending into the ground.
“This might be a stretch,” he whispered, “but can you move all of my memories to Grimmauld Place, Narcissa?”
“He was a wonderful elf,” Draco said, laughter fading. “I was upset when you freed him, but I’m glad he could get away from the Manor, from my father. I’m glad he was happy.”
Then the someone apologized, half-heartedly, and Obliviated Potter, and they were thrown out of the memory and back onto their feet in Draco’s study.

“Right, so, we’ve been going through these for ages, and you’ve obviously seen them, but only once, and you know a lot more about the curse and the attacker and how it all worked—” Hermione was rambling, and the blood was draining from Draco’s face, because why was she talking about this, when Harry wasn’t here and he
Draco snorted and rubbed the heels of his hands across his eyes, trying to push his tears back in by sheer force of willpower. There was a soft whisper of breath across his hair and then a kiss pressed to his forehead, impossibly tender.
He knocked once, then twice quickly—a short code, letting Ron know who was at the door, before opening it and stepping inside.
and a small, bright, silvery bird burst from the tip of his wand, hovering expectantly. Harry hadn’t known he could conjure a Patronus, and somewhere deep in his mind, behind the dizziness and anxiety and shame, he was dying to know what Malfoy’s happiest memory was.
“I see,” Shacklebolt murmured, nodding. “I’ll write the warden for an update, then.”
“They still think Ginny and I are together, though I came out a
“It’s possible,” Ron said, finally done with his spells. The walls glowed with the strength of his charms. “Aurors, you know each other’s identifying questions. Parkinson, you know I can’t let you join us on this—you’re a civilian, you have no training—”
that you’re in fact celebrated.”
Draco guided them through a slow, careful meditation, but he kept his hands on his own coffee mug the whole time, its warmth softening him from the inside out, relaxing the muscles still tensed in fight-or-flight.
“I’m not your son,” he reminded her. She tugged on a curl in reprimand.
“Prove to me you are who you say you are,” Harry growled, though he knew who she was.
Draco retreated from Harry’s head, pointing his wand at the chalkboard to label a new dot “Sparing Pettigrew” before lowering it to his lap. He examined his fingers, ran one hand through his hair, let it fall down his neck, inside his collar to trace the tip of the scar there. Harry watched the path of his hand, apparently enraptured. Draco swallowed.
He closed his eyes, ignoring the rose that had appeared on the floor next to him. He felt the soothing sensation of a soft hand in his, and allowed her immaterial comfort, for both of their sakes.

They sat there, regarding each other for long moments, recovering from their darker memories with the help of Timsy’s delectable hot chocolate. After a few minutes, Harry opened up his notebook again, clicking his pen, writing something carefully.
Draco kept moving, onward through the year, past memories of the students glaring at him, wearing Draco’s “Potter Stinks” badges, past an adrenaline filled memory with a massive, angry dragon following him on a broom that made Draco shake, past an uncomfortable Yule Ball watching Cho and Cedric and even Draco dancing with Pansy, until he saw that iridescent glow coming up, and latched on to it.
Harry chewed on the end of his pen, staring at the paper, before turning back to Draco with an exasperated look on his face. He shook his head, put his notebook down, and tapped his index finger on his forehead insistently. Draco raised his eyebrows.
furious,
Harry did, and the soft smile remained on his face the entire time.
Ten years. It had been
The trio stood, and he shook hands with Ron and Hermione, confirming that he would indeed find a pair of Grouch slippers for Rose. He turned to shake Harry’s hand last.
“Hmm,” Draco hummed. “You were surprised that he helped you?” Harry nodded.
Draco made the decision for him. He reached into his pocket with his free hand, and started whistling
Harry’s throat dried up, and his chest tightened, mixing with the swooping in his stomach and making him feel resentful. He snapped his jaw shut and ground his teeth, seething. He clenched his fists in the sheet of the hospital bed.
Hermione rolled her eyes, but looked rather pleased by the compliment. Harry stood, pulling Draco up with him.
Harry chuckled ruefully. “What?”
and the immense power of lying to a Legilimens, over and over.
But it was Thursday, it was almost nine o clock, and this room, this sanctuary, was made for honesty. Draco would have to share his suspicions, even if they might cause Harry to attack, or flee.
“New assignment, Unspeakable Potter.”
Malfoy pulled a small notebook and a muggle biro from his jacket pocket, and Harry was slightly impressed with the extension charms it obviously held. But his brain was whirring with anxiety, he couldn’t stop on a thought for longer than a second. His heart was racing wildly, and his breathing was shallow and quick.
Why would she risk everything to sate her curiosity?
in the matter, his soul chose for him.
His eyebrows rose as he read the sparse text.
“I’ll be honest, I’m not eager for any sort of responsibility,” eighteen-year-old Harry had told him, to which Kramer had thrown back his head and laughed.
The fire crackled quietly in the grate. Harry bit his lip again, his brow creased in thought as he watched Draco label the new dot on the board: “Adult distrust - Stone.”
to be Potter’s Healer. Draco could give him a long list of recommendations, there were quite a few other Healer Legilimens around the world, whom Draco had learned from. He
Harry suddenly found himself giggling, silently, along with Ron and Hermione. Draco Malfoy had just made them laugh,
The memories flashed past him, and Draco suppressed a wince at watching himself milk that shallow injury for all it was worth.
Shacklebolt shrugged, another shockingly informal gesture for the Minister. “That’s your prerogative,” he said. “Either way, I doubt he ever wanted you to know.”
“I only mean that, he knows we know each other, that we talk. He doesn’t know I’m here to talk about… this.”
“There is no bloody book club,” he replied. “I swear I’ve visited every old biddy in Wizarding Britain, not a single witch has heard of Narcissa Malfoy in any of their book clubs.”
This seemed to piss off Parkinson even more, but Harry couldn’t wait any longer, when Draco’s life was on the line. He turned around, lighting the tip of his wand and sprinting down the dark corridor, where he could see the outline of another door at the end.
“She never cleaned up,” Malfoy said, making Harry jump as he appeared in the doorway. “Huh. I thought she would.” He leaned against the door frame, surveying the room. “Or at least have the elves do it.”
“Some would have considered it an overdose. How is this important?”
Harry opened his mouth to retort when the air was suddenly squeezed out of his lungs, and he was shoved forcefully through space in a nauseating, tightening
“Seven.” Lucius jerked back at this answer, his eyes wide with shock. Draco wanted desperately to escape the coils of his own body, to retreat inside his mind and wait for this to be over, but he needed to stay aware, both of what Lucius was learning from him, and for the little boy in the cell.
Potter,” Draco grumbled, swatting at him. Harry’s enthusiasm skewed Draco’s gold-framed reading glasses, which now sat crookedly on his scrunched, pointy nose. Harry chuckled, kissing him again, full of fondness. Draco smiled into it, despite his complaints, despite his exaggerated spitting noises as Harry’s long, untamed curls intruded upon his face.
Silence. Draco’s fidgeting hand went still. Harry closed his eyes, not wanting to see the open expression shutter into disappointment.
“You’re no fun. And I know you love those slippers, don’t pretend you don’t, your
“Let’s do a bit more breath work, and we’ll go back in, alright?” Draco suggested, sitting up and placing his hands on his knees. He pushed his glasses up into his hair, which he knew looked ridiculous, but his appearance was not his priority at the moment, when he felt he might be losing his grip. He was a
In the third week of May, Harry decided to pack a bag. He stopped by Grimmauld Place after depositing a boring false memory and being short with his boss, and in a large wooden trunk he hadn’t touched in years, he found the old rucksack he’d used while on the run.
approved this?” Hermione exclaimed. The couple still looked utterly appalled.
After a few moments of listening to only the sound of rain on the glass roof, Harry looked up at Draco and jerked his head toward the record player.
The spell lit up him and Parkinson, but not Timsy. Harry frowned, thinking quickly, trying to remember the other spells—
This Christ didn’t look like someone Harry would fall at the feet of—he honestly looked too busy, Harry wouldn’t want to get in his way. He hoped this statue would forgive him for the abuse Harry was about to inflict.
Harry’s body gave him about two seconds to process those words before the rage settled in. He could hear his teeth grinding in his skull. How could he have been so stupid? How could he not have seen it?
moving at the same pace he was. He felt like he was slogging through muck, dragged down by how much he didn’t yet know, how much lay in their way, as a person he cared for was hurt, or tortured, or dying... It felt like one of his nightmares. He subtly glanced at his hands, and counted his fingers easily, as Draco had taught him—not a dream, then, very real.
“So you, the Minister for Magic, have absolutely no idea what goes on on an entire floor of the Ministry, nor who works there… and you don’t
“Brazil,” Draco repeated flatly. “You’re joking.” Harry huffed a laugh, stuffed his hands in his pockets, and with a final smile at Draco, walked out of the house.
“Tell me why you joined the Unspeakables, and what you did for them,” Draco demanded softly. Harry propped himself up on his elbow, smiling down at Draco’s pout. He took his hand, lacing their fingers between their bodies.
“He told me that, too,” the timid voice sounded again.
Scorpius tsked at him, in a manner so similar to Draco that Draco nearly laughed again. He pressed his lips together as his son succumbed to Harry’s flattery and cleared his throat.
“Alright, Harry,” Malfoy muttered, pulling away with a silly peck on Harry’s nose that made Harry’s throat feel tight. He didn’t think he’d ever felt so casually
“To be fair.” Harry gestured around Draco broadly, his eyes glimmering. “
Draco stood slowly. Every muscle in his body felt stiff and exhausted—there was no way they’d be able to fly today, but he knew they could use fresh air, and they both needed a dose of happiness. An idea began to form in his mind.
“Well? Care to explain why you’d stoop so low as to beg
though I doubt that was their intention. How many times since then have you done something because you felt like you had to, like you owed it to the world? How many times in these last few weeks were you finally able to do things you
When Draco looked up at him, swaying, Harry’s eyes were wide and frantic, one hand held out in front of him as if to touch Draco—for what reason, Draco didn’t know. He looked almost… regretful? Afraid? Draco had worn the same expression a few times when his goddaughter was an infant, and he’d made a face at her to try to make her smile, but had only ended up making her cry.
He tuned back into the words, listening intently while watching the Potter next to him for his reactions. Potter’s eyes were strained, as if the words hurt to hear, but his top lip was curling subtly in… disgust? Disdain? His fists were clenching and unclenching at his sides, his body was tense as he watched the scene unfold.
Draco bared his teeth and Harry gasped dramatically, flopping down onto his back and sending scrunchies flying. A red fluffy one landed next to Draco and he stuck his nose through it, relishing in the scent that told him
might be a bit more eccentric than even Harry could handle.
“It was a gift,” Draco explained vaguely. “How do you get the music out of it?”
—that could have meant
“I’ll be seeing you, Cissa,” he called, waving back at her as he dragged a spluttering Draco out of the room.
a glimpse of the freedom Harry felt, making the tired grey shine like the silver ring on his finger.
that Draco had understood it. Harry adjusted his pen in his hand, and wrote something else.
“Whatever it is, Timsy, we need to use it,” Harry replied. “Draco could be anywhere, and you know what Lucius is like. Please, tell us how to find him.”
Draco’s mind went three places at once.
casting his shadow over the ornate, carpeted floors, and Parkinson stepped out of the grate with Timsy, both of them still emanating fury. To Harry’s surprise, they stepped up next to him—Harry had never thought he’d stand side-by-side with Pansy Parkinson, ever, about anything, but here they were.
but it was the quick death of being walloped by a flaming brick wall, an explosive collision of unstoppable forces, and then it was over—quiet, cool, honey-sweet darkness.
Draco raised his eyebrows. “Severus’ Patronus was a female deer?” Harry bent his head to write more.
He kept his wand in his hand and a hostile glare on his face as he swung the front door open to tear his uninvited guest a new one, but the words were quickly wiped from his mind upon their greeting:
Harry thought about it for barely two seconds before giving Draco a short nod. He put his mocha down and sat up straight, closing his eyes, taking some deep breaths to prepare himself.
Draco kept them meditating for much longer than before—it gave him time to strengthen his Occlumency barriers again, and prepare himself for what he knew he would see.
“Will you teach me?”
Draco’s fingers tightened, and this time, Harry knew they could tie him down. He would happily be tethered to Draco like this, for the rest of their days.
“Harry, what are you—”
“I use Occlumency to hold back my emotions and reactions while I’m in someone’s head,” he began. “When I finish casting, I have to take down the barriers and feel them, process them. But that was a lot to take in, and too much anger to hold back at once.”
“That was lovely,” he murmured, the corner of his lips turning up in a smile. “But I think there might be more to that, than just happiness for your friends, yeah?”
Harry was shouting now, releasing all of his pent up anger and frustration and anxiety. Kingsley stood from his desk, hands held up in supplication.
They fell into another moment of pensive silence, relishing in their closeness. The sizzling sound quieted; Harry breathed in the fragrant smell of sauteed bell peppers and onions.
He walked along the bank of the Vltava River, taking in the sights as the city took in him. Prague felt like a museum, he thought; everything looked like art and smelled like history. When he passed by markets, he smelled sausages and fresh bread and coffee, heard laughter and chatter in languages he didn’t know, and thought Draco would have found it lovely.
Harry was still stuck on the fact that Draco hadn’t immediately pushed him away, had in fact
Weasley at least had the decency to look embarrassed. He cleared his throat awkwardly. “Erm… no, I suppose you can start in the afternoon, if that works. I just had to get to you early, the Healers said you were in very high demand, and probably booked, and this is obviously urgent…” He trailed off again, and Draco decided to put him out of his misery. It was true, he was booked, but that was irrelevant. He stood up, setting down his coffee cup and adjusting the belt of his dressing gown.
The two women were deep in discussion, murmuring quietly. Draco moved further into the room, and they snapped their heads towards him as they noticed him.
The Healers so far were baffled. They kept telling Harry there was nothing wrong with him, when there quite obviously
“There’s nothing you can do that will make them draw away from you. I’d go as far as to say you’re their family—they’d probably agree. I bet Rose calls you
Draco finally, gratefully, withdrew from Harry’s head. His left hand was still shaking in his lap, and his breathing was hoarse and shallow, but he pointed his wand at the chalkboard, adding two more dots to the long train of memories. He left the first one blank, for the moment, and labeled the second one “Dumbledore Death - Fake Locket” because he couldn't bring himself to write the word ‘Horcrux’. Slowly, his Occlumency barriers came down, and his reactions and emotions came flooding through.
” Draco was mumbling to himself, at this point, processing all the rest of it, now that the flood of emotions had subsided. Harry was still nodding at him.
You let it happen, you let it continue for years, and you used the promise of his wellbeing against me, without even following through. You’d better believe I’m not doing a single fucking thing for you again, Kingsley, and you’re going to help me remove those bonds
bound you?
A low voice, still raspy from sleep. Harry stiffened, but didn’t move. His fingers gripped the edge of the counter, desperately trying to control the shaking of his muscles. His breaths felt too loud, too quick. 1:28.
“Timsy, could you please bring me my slippers? And a pot of coffee for us in the sitting room.”
“Merlin, Harry,” she muttered. Harry cast a quick
“Fucking hell,” Harry groaned.
, and you alone. Accept or deny these terms, but let me know now, if I need to get the Obliviation over with.”
“Potter?”
“Honestly, where are your manners? Give the lady a carrot!” Draco teased, offering Harry the second carrot. Hera followed its path with her nose. Harry grinned, taking the carrot and holding it out for an eager Hera, all wariness forgotten between both parties. Harry slowly reached his other hand up to try scratching behind her ears, and almost laughed in disbelieving joy when she leaned into it. Draco wondered when the last time Harry had interacted with an animal was—at least one that wasn’t an owl. Speaking of which…
“Alright, well,” Draco started, “I think we ought to begin with that memory of the incident. I don’t have to go back in your head for it, if you’d rather pull it out for the Pensieve, we can watch it again together. We might be able to make out more details that way, without the nausea. It’ll still be hazy, but we’ll only be watching.” He’d rather not endure the full experience again if he didn’t have to.
“Focus on where you feel me, in your head.”
Draco looked back at the boombox, examining it, and eventually spotted the triangle and square Pansy had mentioned. Simple enough. Should be a cinch.
or something, like everyone else.
“Bubble tea,” Harry said, his mouth finally tilting into a smile, “is very important.”
She stared at it with Hermione, both pairs of eyes wide as saucers, unable to speak.
Harry relayed the message, sending the Patronus on its way. He tossed his wand on the blanket and leaned back down, and Draco welcomed his kisses hungrily. Harry’s hand found Draco’s side, moving up across his chest, and Draco indulged them both for several moments, before reluctantly pushing Harry away, dazed and panting.
“Draco, does your home have a name?” Harry asked. Draco looked up from
“Go on, get it all out.”
“It doesn’t matter, now,” Draco muttered. “Point is, I’m not rushing your healing for anybody. The other point is, someone else knows you’re seeing me, and I certainly haven’t let anything slip, because I can’t. I don’t know if that matters to you or not, but if it does, you might want to contain that rumour before it catches.”
Harry couldn’t help it, he spluttered with laughter. Draco smacked him, but couldn’t stifle his own smile, and the sound seemed to be the last straw for his wiggle-suppressing. He tackled Harry to the bed, sending scrunchies flying as he peppered Harry’s face with kisses. His hands were everywhere, and it was almost tickling, almost wrestling, making Harry laugh harder, because Draco wouldn’t stop
“Alright,” Draco said, standing from his chair and smoothing down his jacket again. “I’ll expect you tomorrow morning at nine. Send an owl if you have questions in the meantime.” He straightened his spine, and sent a small glare at Weasley. “If you have any trouble finding the house, I’m sure the Head Auror can get you there in record time.”
“I’ll see what I can find out, but like I said, they’re near impossible to track down,” Kingsley said. Draco sighed. Why did Kingsley Shacklebolt, the
The resulting victorious smile on Draco’s face made everything worth it. It lit up his tired eyes, bright silver over shadowed smudges. Harry knew he hadn’t been sleeping well since Harry’d moved in—Harry knew because he himself stayed awake for most of the night,
Malfoy shot him an unimpressed look. “Yes, six weeks, and that’s on the shorter end of the timeline. The mind is absolutely gargantuan, and we have to pay attention to every detail. If we’re keeping the analogy, we’re literally scouring the forest floor for breadcrumbs. You can’t rush through it, as missing a crumb or taking a wrong turn could set us back even farther. Plus, we have to recover any lost memories first.”
“Just us, then?” Draco asked, motioning between himself and Ron, who looked back at his wife in inquiry.
“Well Draco kind of, vaguely, indirectly told us not to tell you,” she said, uncomfortable. “He generally said he would tell you, himself, if you asked, but he didn’t want us telling you, knowing you’d probably take it up as a cause, something to save him from, which would distract from your healing—“
He turned to greet Granger, who had grown into her features as much as her husband, without the height and muscle. He’d seen her photo in the Prophet plenty of times, but the effect in-person was something else entirely. He couldn’t exactly pinpoint what was different—just that she was most definitely a

“Yeah fucking right. Like you need a
“Harry—”
Draco tilted his head down in response. “Understandable,” he said, “I wear glamours or transfigure my face when I have to go out shopping or dining in Wizarding districts.” He paused, remembering the spit on his face the one time he tried to restock his potions ingredients in person, as himself—and the violence and jeers of the approaching mob as he walked down Diagon Alley toward Gringotts, at nineteen. He had fled in disapparition before he ever arrived. “Pansy doesn’t allow it, says I have to ‘face them head on,’ or something, but she’s scary enough that people don’t bother us when we’re together.”
Enjoy! Thanks for reading, and for all the love in the comments :') I cherish every single one :')
“Fine,” Ron sighed, after a moment of thought. “I don’t really trust that. But Harry trusts you, and we’ll be here all bloody night if we have to watch everything.”
“He got the important part right,” Hannah piped up, making complicated wand movements over Narcissa’s abdomen. “This is definitely Narcissa Malfoy née Black.”
on Draco Malfoy.
“He is not.”
Scorpius,” Harry said firmly, “you’re perfect, exactly as you are. It just means we learn a bit differently, sometimes in unconventional ways.”
Draco took both of Timsy’s hands—the elf was much too short for Draco to dance with properly, but he knew the steps better than anyone. They made it work. As the chorus approached, Draco gave Timsy a wicked grin, and he could have sworn he saw him roll his huge eyes before swinging a leg back and vaulting them into a perfect Viennese Waltz, gliding around the room with Draco in perfect synchronization at a high speed, which was quite impressive with his short, little legs. Draco let out a bright laugh of delight as he spun them around. Harry’s smile was blinding as he followed them with his eyes, shoulders shaking with silent laughter.

As if he knew they were talking about him, Boran’s eyes slowly opened, landing first on his mother. He stared at her in disbelief, as if he was worried he was dreaming, that none of it was real. She smiled gently at him, reaching out and taking his hand.

Harry thought, his face falling as he turned his gaze back to Malfoy, assessing him. Highly recommended. Best at what he does. In very high demand. Harry remembered the Healers saying there was only one Mind Curse Specialist in all of England, and that he was exceptionally good at it, if a little young. He wondered if the Healers had purposefully left Malfoy’s

Before Harry could form any words, the door of the cottage flung open, and Draco Malfoy stepped out, looking wary and disgruntled and—
“No.”

His eyes dropped back down to Harry’s, smirking at the flaming blush creeping its way up Harry’s cheeks, the lips parted in bashful astonishment. Harry felt the sparks of his gaze in his chest, warming him from the inside out.
And, whether he survived or not, what if it didn’t work? What if it was all for nothing?
“Why are you doing this to me?” Draco whispered, his fingers tangling in Harry’s hair. Harry’s hands went automatically to Draco’s hips, sliding up his firm chest over a thin cotton shirt.
Harry had his eyes closed, and his face was grave. He looked like he was trying to strengthen himself just as Draco was—Draco wanted to touch him, to tell him that he didn’t have to be the only one holding himself up all the time, especially in here, in their sanctuary. Harry opened his eyes, and Draco saw a hint of defeat among the grief in his face.
Harry’s halfway around the counter. The closer he gets, the faster Draco’s hands work, to hide their shaking.
“And now Kingsley tells you you have to do this, that you owe it to him and to the world, even though it’s
“Thank you, Timsy.”
“Do all your memories look like that?” Draco asked, as Potter carefully slipped the strand into the glass vial and handed it to Draco. Potter furrowed his brows again as he shook his head. He clearly didn’t know what was wrong with it, either.
then Draco drew in a sharp, surprised breath, and kissed him back.

They were just teeth, of course, but they were

of hurting Draco, and using him against Narcissa.
so impulsively again.
For one, Draco stopped wearing pyjamas to bed. He still woke up grumpy as ever, and still brought his duvet with him to the kitchen, where Harry would try to make him breakfast to keep from touching him.
Draco abandoned his dinner halfway through in favour of devouring Harry, instead, to Harry’s immense satisfaction. Draco wanted him like he couldn’t get enough, like he couldn’t even help himself, and it made Harry both overwhelmed and just as insatiable.

Harry brought them back to the forest floor. Narcissa was walking away, Death Eaters were cheering, Harry’s body was being thrown around, impervious to the pain of Voldemort’s curses.
But also,
Draco locked his arms around Potter’s waist, his wand still in his hand. He pulled him in, hearing Potter let out a breath of relief as Draco leaned down and kissed him for all he was worth.
“You’re really not… disappointed?” Harry asked, his voice small, muffled against Draco’s neck.
“Prongs,”
“Relax, Harry,” he murmured, feeling Harry’s muscles tensing beneath his hand. His chest tightened as Harry took a deep, slow breath, meeting Draco’s eyes. He still looked so nervous, which was certainly not conducive to dancing.
“Are you getting along, then?” Kramer asked. Harry kept his face blank, and lifted his shoulder in a shrug.
Draco huffed a weak laugh, trying to keep his face from looking too shocked. “Alright, Ron, Hermione,” he said, out loud, and this was so fucking weird, “please, call me Draco.”
“You should give it to a house elf, Teddy,” Andromeda instructed. “They’ll know what to do with it, and your Aunt Cissy is probably hoping to avoid an infestation in her gardens.”
Parkinson scoffed, shaking her head, tucking her sleek, dark bob behind her ear.
“Twenty down,” Draco mumbled. “If we were a bit over halfway through at thirteen, we must be getting close.”
Draco said nothing, of course. His bonds wouldn’t allow it, and she knew that. At his obvious silence, Pansy groaned in exasperation.
“Who was it? Why’d they bother Obliviating him at all?” Ron piped up.
“What?”
The hand on his chest reached out of its own accord, and was found by another, just as warm, alive,
If Draco hadn’t known her so well, he would have missed the way her shoulders sagged, ever so slightly, in disappointment. Narcissa was the perfect archetype of pureblood nobility—distant and cold, the epitome of grace and poise, never showing any signs of weakness. She was always difficult to read, even to her family, but Draco knew her better than anyone—except maybe Lucius.
“Then tell us what to do, Smith, and we’ll help you with it,” Kingsley’s voice sounded as he stepped around Ron’s imposing figure.
He honed you masterfully into a
“She was very insistent on clearing away every remnant of the War,” Malfoy muttered. “Except this, apparently.” He scuffed the dust at his feet. “Can’t blame her there, I wouldn’t have wanted to come down here to get it, either. But I didn’t want to be
“I have to ask, Harry,” Draco began hesitantly, rolling his body on the conjured blanket and propping himself up on one elbow, staring down at him. Since returning from their walk, they’d done nothing but lay under the magnolia tree all afternoon, talking and occasionally kissing, but Draco had thought he’d have left by now, considering the date. Not that he was complaining.
Draco narrowed his eyes. “You know I can’t.”
“The owl will still find him, you know. And I need to return that dress. And his jumper,” she added. Harry saw them both folded neatly on an empty chair. He smirked.
But there were
Draco smiled softly at him again, and Harry felt like he was flying.
“In Malfoy Manor, Wiltshire.”
He hadn’t known that such a frosty grey could look so warm. It was nicer to think about than his current situation.
Draco leaned against the counter, his arms crossed over his chest, his plait coming apart on his shoulder. He stayed quiet, watching with a pensive frown as Harry moved around the kitchen. Harry regretted not having a wireless in his kitchen, but he didn’t mind the silence so much. Draco’s silence was still better than Draco’s absence.
But now, all he had to ruminate on was the odd, bashful fluttering in his stomach, an intense sadness for Malfoy’s mother, and a profound, familiar, unyielding curiosity about Draco Malfoy.
“The Ministry of Magic.”
not better. Draco’s hands were shaking violently as they curled over his abdomen in defense. His hair, normally so sleek and perfect, was sticking to his forehead with sweat. He looked up at Harry with eyes full of resignation and defeat, so similar to the way he’d looked in Courtroom Ten during his trial: chained to the metal chair, shivering.
he knew how to do, and whiled away the hours of his day off humming to himself in his pyjamas, just because, while Timsy worked on the plants and gave Draco occasional disapproving looks.
“They exist, and they’re called

“Impressive how she manages to find time to slip in harsh disparagements of every one of your faults, isn’t it, even in the most dire situations,” Draco laughed fondly, his joy mingling with the music that now filled the garden. He laid back down next to Harry, watching the dappled sunlight play across his skin.
The soft, familiar scritching sound filled the room, only slightly different with the sharper, more expensive nib. Harry watched the words appear in Draco’s wake, in his favourite dark blue ink.
“You know,” Scorpius said, as if Harry were being dense, “when you’re trying to read, but the letters keep jumping around. It’s

“Of course I

Malfoy looked…
once he saw his attacker.
Draco forcefully stilled his jumping leg. He hadn’t even noticed.
“I’m so sorry. I always lose my head around you.”
Slowly, with shaking little hands, Timsy reached out and took Harry’s wand, staring at it in his grip with wonder. He looked back up at Harry with a determined, awe-filled expression, and raised the holly wand, pointing it at Harry’s forehead.
“Thanks, Timsy,” Harry said as he crouched down to the low shelf, reading the tag he was pointing to.
Draco was pressing his lips together so hard it hurt. He’d been waiting for something good, or happy, like a relationship or a new home or a hobby or even a pet, but there’s none of that here, and the months are flying by into years. All Draco is missing are those memories of the muggle pub he knew Harry liked, because those memories are probably still in Ron and Hermione’s Pensieve. But he knew Harry only went there to be alone, to be simply a stranger nobody knew.
“Timsy is finding,” he rasped, and once again, Harry waited as patiently as he could, though his nerves felt electric. His eyes darted around to the many doors, carefully avoiding the pull of the veil.
“Thought you’d left,” Draco mumbled sleepily, scooting in close until his chest pressed against Harry’s back, his thighs around Harry’s hips. “But you left your wand in your trousers. You’re wearing mine, by the way.”
Hermione looked back and forth between the two confused pureblood wizards. Draco could practically hear her brain whirring with comprehension behind her skull.
“You want…?” Harry said, and
letting his mind wander. People-watching—he’d been assigned people-watching, today. Two hours, and then he could go home and do whatever he pleased. After depositing the memory into the Department of Mysteries’ collection, of course.
Harry and Ron yelled simultaneously.
"Okay," Draco said, pushing Harry toward the door, "okay." Harry let out a huff of relief as he finally pulled Draco out of the cell into the dimly lit corridor.
