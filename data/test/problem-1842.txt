“Excuse me,” Draco said as his classmates filtered out into the hall. He wasn’t going down the partner rabbit hole without a fight. “I can’t work with Potter. Change my partner.”
A strange chill went through Draco to hear Theo’s father mentioned. The man was a purist of the highest degree, and an incredibly violent one at that.
Both men clenched tight, the sharp contraction of Harry’s inner muscles driving Draco to cry out as he came inside him. Harry melted back into the mattress with a loud groan of his own, significantly less ejaculate coming out but still dribbling all over his maid’s skirt.
“I mean, my parents did, but I only have one memory of it that I’m frankly not sure if it’s even real. Madam Pomfrey had to have because whenever I was injured I woke to having a blanket on… but that’s it.”
“This isn’t an argument,” Harry told Draco seriously. As far as Harry was concerned, he’d been built up, broken down, and hurt enough for one evening. “I just don’t want to do this.”
Maybe it was that she realized she was going to have to ice the cake on her own, without any assistance from a third party since Draco and Harry were currently out of shouting distance.
Why did Draco have the terrible feeling this was going to be a long night until his reward? The sinking sensation in his chest became nigh unbearable when he actually laid eyes on the other couple that was meeting them there tonight.
“Next one?” Harry’s jaw dropped. He’d known Draco had wanted more than one in theory, but this was an actual agreement. Plus, nothing would get back at Lucius like forcing him to love a grandchild that was a muggleborn. It was almost a sick sort of pleasure that Harry got out of it. “Promise me.”
“Aw, he promises,” Draco observed with a wheezy laugh. “You do try your best to be a good boy, don’t you?” His back muscles were tense, sweat dripping between his shoulderblades to keep up the repetitive motion of fucking himself into Harry.
The man’s face went pale and Harry excused it as being starstruck. “Famous…? Who is this person dating?”
Draco settled in some more, resting his head in the crook of Harry’s neck. “Good, good…” Draco let his eyes close for a moment, exhaustion washing over him. He couldn’t rest long, though, not when Harry needed his immediate attention. “Such a good boy,” he murmured, moving up to pepper his cheeks with kisses using his nose as a bridge between them.
With a slight hum of agreement—fuck, indeed—Harry took more and more in, gagging slightly and pulling off, but then going in and trying again. He was woefully out of practice. Harry swore that what he lacked in experience he would make up for in eagerness, in willingness to try and put his all into it.
The dementors caused everything from psychotic breaks to severe depression in the most mild of cases of prisoners being around them for so long, which was exactly why Minister Kingsley Shacklebolt had outlawed their use.
“Oh, so now you see that you should probably be there for your best mate’s house warming party,” Colin laughed breathily between kisses. If they had any real time to stay in bed, he would have drawn the white sheets up around them.
“It was a joke,” Blaise tried to explain when he saw that icy stare take over her usually warm eyes.
“Yes, yes. I understand, but I can’t make any promises right now,” Draco said dismissively before trying to dash in escape once more.
Blaise plopped down on the space Bianca had left. “So, how was it for you?” he asked as he handed her the midnight snack.
Lucius let out a second hiss. This one was longer and marginally more annoyed. He let it settle in the kitchen before turning to Sirius.
“Okay, we need to get you somewhere you can sleep this off,” Harry decided. They certainly couldn’t remain in the owlery much longer before The Prophet had a new scandal on their hands.
Harry had to pull back from their kiss to remove the tank, but he hardly felt the absence as Draco’s hands pawed at any and all of the skin Harry revealed. It was dark, and Draco couldn’t see much, but what he was feeling was more than enough.
When it was all done Harry toweled off feeling quite refreshed. When he opened the door to his room again he put on some of the clothes he’d brought—how offensive could Draco really find jeans and a t-shirt?
“A lion can take a few bites,” Lucius shrugged. “If he’s serious about being with you then he will have to be able to withstand my questioning. I insist.”
Hours trickled by as Draco cemented his lesson plans, finally reaching a point where he was confident he would remember each one in the moment. Draco fully intended to give out the tips and tricks of the trade, the secrets he’d learned along the way, instead of hiding the knowledge like past greedy Potionsmasters did. Draco wanted for his students to succeed, and one day, perhaps even succeed him.
“Daddy!” she yelped with a gigantic smile on her face as her light-haired father picked her up off the ground and kissed her pudgy cheek. In seconds, her papa was in on the love fest, too.
“I know all about being short-staffed,” Hermione nodded. “My position in the Ministry is to assist those underrepresented by magical law and establish protections for them. It’s working within existing systems that are flawed, but we get as much good done as we can.”
There was no easy way to describe what had happened. Plagued by Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and stuck with memories of a war Harry had never wanted to fight in, Harry woke up screaming.
Harry’s face was still frozen in that stunned look. Draco promptly blamed it on his having grown up poor and being dazzled by money and took over the conversation. “But you’re asking questions now?” Draco pressed Lorraine. “How come?”
Ah, the juicy part. Draco had never spoken publicly about his feelings on the war. Not once had he ever responded to the thousands of inquiries after the trials or on the anniversaries, but these students… they deserved the truth.
“Harry!” Hermione said, rising from her place on a comfortable-looking knit couch she’d been sharing with Fleur. “And Draco. Good to see you.” And it was, to both of their surprise.
“I don’t even want to know,” Lucius said of the weird look on Harry’s face and whatever Draco had just muttered aside to him.
Harry wouldn’t make Draco apologize when he was sick, though. If he did then that opened up the door to Draco shrugging off the apology as something said in an ill stupor.
Draco eyed him a spell longer. Draco had always found him stupidly attractive, but beneath his attraction he noted the bags beneath Harry’s eyes with some concern. He was thin, like the ad said, but on such close inspection he was bordering on unfed. Draco swallowed thickly. “I swear it, Harry. I already swore it in the letter but I will never reveal the contents of any of these interactions to any outside party.”
Once again Harry was smiling that stupid, huge, pretty smile, trying to get a look over her shoulder.
Ron dropped to one knee like he was about to propose marriage. “Hermione Jean Granger, will you be my date to the prom?”
Harry carried his letter down to the owl coop of the Manor and attached it to the claw of a judgmental-looking black beast. Its yellow eyes pierced Harry’s calm, and left him feeling uneasy long after the letter was sent on its way.
“Have you forgotten?” Kennedy asked quietly. “Have you seriously forgotten everything you’ve done for me? You’ve been there, B. You’ve been there when I needed you so I’m just returning the favor. I’m gonna support you. Why do you think I wanted to meet you? So I could reject you? Come here, please don’t cry, come here…”
“Then you don’t have to, I’ll explain to you both later. But Ron, I really, really need you to leave.” With his free hand Harry searched for thick hair on his head and pulled it out to some relief.
Harry did sometimes feel the rebellious urge to masturbate in secret, but it would doubtlessly come out in the heat of the moment and Harry would expose himself. It wasn’t worth the punishments that would follow, the less-fun ones that he got when he broke serious rules.
The worst part was, Draco knew it was for good reason. No matter how rude, obnoxious, or self-obsessed she was… She was what they were looking for in a legal contract.
That little ramble had clearly cemented Marcus' hatred of Harry Malfoy-Potter. He looked on the edge of snarling something out even though it most certainly wouldn't be the location of the body parts of his murder victim.
Colin dug into his pocket. “Well, you know how I didn’t really want my father to date Helen? You know how I perished at the idea of them being intimate? Well.” He put the invitation in front of Theo’s plate. “Guess whose wedding announcement this is.”
With a childlike wonder Harry stepped into the spray clinging to Draco, cold water washing away their dampness. Harry’s glasses went on the table with the robes so he had to be close to see the details on Draco’s face, arms around him to make sure he’d never be out of sight.
That was what he said every time. “Try harder,” Ginny decided. Maybe that was the only thing that could tame his wandering eye.
Harry pushed Draco’s briefs down feverishly, his hands warm and his breathing uneven as he closed his fist around Draco’s length.
“Don’t look so concerned,” she said with a playful roll of her eyes. “I’ll get plenty of naps and drink gallons of water a day. I wouldn’t want to upset my Healer; he’s a real stickler for pregnancies. I pity the woman that will soon be carrying his bundle of joy.”
Why Grace had requested a blood test was beyond Draco. It would take a day to process with the work load he had, and she hadn’t even bled when she fell.
“Well, neither do you,” he snipped just to get his last word in. Zeke was always doing that in arguments, like it was a battle to win.
“Pretzel?” Harry offered begrudgingly when he realized Draco was staring at the soft pretzel he’d gotten from one of the airport shops like a starved lion.
Hell, life with Harry was comfortable. It was soft, and sweet, and would Draco really mind if it lasted forever? Forever was kind of scary when said outside of the heat of passion—forever meant ever on, meant the ‘M’ word and it wasn’t ‘Malfoy’. Would it be Malfoy-Potter? Draco actually really, really liked the sound of that. “Thank you, Harry.”
A slow smile curled up on Draco’s lips. “You’re shaking so hard, love. Maybe I should be gentle—“ he began to tease again.
Draco shoved his wand into his back pocket so both his hands could be free to heap a pile of cooling cookies onto a plate.
“We could go back to the agency,” Draco sighed exhaustedly. If Grace Burbage was the only solution to Harry’s moral dilemma, then Draco would create another one. “Pull the rest of the files…”
So Lucius took his seat at the head of the table, Draco across from his mother and Harry placed awkwardly to the side of Draco. Harry dealt with it in stride.
“The response to the owl back home should be framed,” Eric suggested. “That way you can always capture the beauty of the moment where Ravenclaw changed the course of history.”
Harry was so blissed out face-down on this plush couch he wasn’t quite aware of his surroundings, only of Draco’s voice.
“You come from a family with an even number of kids,” Aiden told Hugo Weasley—three years his senior—as if Aiden knew it all. That was a typical Gryffindor trait, though. “Rose and you got into different houses. It’s all equal and shit. With Lily here being a Slytherin and me being in the best house in the school we need a tiebreaker.”
,” Harry choked out, shocked by the sensitivity and Draco’s boldness. No man had ever licked him there and especially not like that, and Draco’s mouth just kept coming back for more.
“Oh, no, I actually am your patient today. I only ask for the best after all, darling. Now, could you take a look at this rash?” she unzipped her knee-high boot and pointed.
Alright, the sweet ignorance was over. “I have a business proposition,” she said as she shifted back into her normal Slytherin self.
“Good boy,” Draco soothed, hands moving up to gently rub his nipples. “Who’s my good boy? Come on, tell me.”
“Here,” Harry positioned him, beckoning him forward with the fingers inside of him. “Just like that.” He eased them out and Draco made a small noise at how he missed them. He was wide open now, and Harry wasted no time nudging his cockhead against the gaping hole. “Fuck, you look so good.”
Somewhere in a far-away manse, Lucius Malfoy thought he was doing right for his child. So did Molly Weasley when she cooked veritable banquets when Ron visited, and so did Sirius when he told Olivia to put down the quill, to stop applying for jobs for the hundredth time, and gave her a kind smile when she finally gave in and let him teach her how to work the muggle telly.
When the new and reinforced door was sealed for the night, Draco let out a sigh of relief. Finally. In a silent admiration, he took a look around the vaulted ceilings and wedding-cake-white walls. They’d have to fill those with art. Lots and lots of bizarre moving scenes of naturalistic ecstasy that would make them seem deep and complicated in front of their friends. Maybe they could even commission Dean for some paintings, and get Colin to snap a few vaguely-pretentious pictures.
“It’s the truth,” Harry stuck to it, mouth hovering over Draco’s stomach. He gave the skin above Draco’s waistband several kisses before moving even further down. “You’re so handsome—how is one person allowed to be so handsome?”
Harry’s whole body shivered and his face went red, getting snickers out of both Draco and Ginny. “Drac
Harry’s eyes narrowed. No, this was wrong, it was Draco who was supposed to be the one telling people to get on the ground. “What are you doing?” Harry demanded, having not put his wand away as he was told and charging forward.  “Get off of him!”
“We’ll meet on the second level, or the sixth, whichever we end up on.” Would he be punished for being a heretic or a queer? It was Draco’s eternal question.
“Then we haven’t a moment to waste.” Draco stood and straightened his collar, offering an arm for Harry to grab onto. “Shall we?”
Draco had no other options, it seemed. He put on an eerie, vacant and toothy smile. “Of course, Head Healer Pye.” Inside he raged. “I will be as diligent as I ever am. Is there anything else you wanted to discuss?”
Harry was absolutely surrounded. Dementors, Aurors, Death Eaters, and faces of the past and present alike reached out to claw at Harry’s face. He ran but it was never fast enough, and he never had his wand working right, and in the scratching darkness there was only crushing breathlessness.
Harry was coming into his own now, though. Ginny could see it happening before her eyes. Harry dressed himself more neatly, held his head higher, and gave all the signs of a submissive being treated oh-so right and reaping the benefits. Harry was happy now, his existence given structure and meaning. Ginny wondered if she should privately thank Draco some other time. The Slytherin may have very well saved Harry’s life by replying to his request in Safeword.
“What could cause something like this?” Ron asked Draco once he was assured nothing dire was afoot. Ever since Hermione’s first pregnancy, Ron had made it his personal mission to not be one of those husbands who blundered through the process blindly as if the uterus was a grand mystery that took years of training to fully understand.
With a wave of his hand Draco summoned lubricant, coating his fingers with it as Harry watched on. Draco was glad he’d decided to leave Harry’s glasses on—he needed to be able to see this properly.
“Uh,” Harry began. Damn that blonde and his penchant for seeing Harry flustered. “Well. There’s a crack on one of the vertebrae, which means…”
“Goodbye,” Olivia cut in, giving her a winning smile. This was a life-affirming she was having with her sort-of-guardian, dammit. No celebrity-crazed girl would interrupt her for too long.
Molly laughed her high-pitched little giggle. “They have women in the bra department that can measure and fit her. All you have to do is take her there and buy them.”
, he decided before watering their beautiful, ridiculous final product of flowers, tomato plants, potato plants, and zucchini. True to Sirius’ style, none of them were in season.
Their release hit at the same time, each moaning around the other. Harry swallowed every drop just as Draco did before slowly pulling off of each other with a wet ‘pop’.
There he was, trying to find some rare artifacts on his map, and he was blindsided by some Horde nut. That was the way of the Warcraft, but still.
Merlin, he was crazy. Harry had really done that. He had really, truly confessed his dark desires to the wizarding public—or at least those who read this publication—in hopes of seeing them come true.
So it wasn’t about his identity as savior? Was it—was this man, a random stranger, happy for them? Neither Draco nor Harry knew quite how to react to that. Draco had been expecting the cold shoulder or at the very least a Good Ole’ Brit ‘tsk, tsk’.
are a big deal. Marriage? It’s relatively similar to the relationship that came before. All we do differently is file our taxes together and manage our joint account,” he told him.
“Both,” said Harry a bit glumly. “I wish this was just a social visit, but we think it’s best to tell our side of the story to the public now that things have gotten out of hand.”
Harry also loved annoying the living shit out of him, and Draco eagerly returned the favor. Harry sang off-key to every song on the radio to grind Draco’s gears and Draco cheered for the opposite Quidditch team that Harry wanted to win just on principle.
“Myself,” Harry admitted and forced himself to keep his head held high about it as they walked through rows of miniature trees. There was a train chugging along around the top of the walls of the shop, lights glowing and flashing.
Draco went on singing, soft and low, and did so until he ran out of verses in his memory. Narcissa had done a better job than he with the words and it still seemed like he had a long way to go, but apparently Harry didn’t mind. He’d gone very still to listen, and… what was that?
“It’s always the nightmares,” Harry grumbled, a bit too short in his response for his own liking. Ron was only trying to help. Harry tried again. “I’ve just been resting, trying to heal.” As he had been for a decade now.
Harry closed his fists around the silk and pulled gently at first, and then with some force. He really couldn’t get out of these. His wand was right to the side, of course, so he could be out in a second with Diffindo, or using the safeword, but that wasn’t what he wanted—Harry wanted to be stuck like this. His heartrate rose significantly, pounding in his ears while all his eyes had to behold ahead of him was the leather cross-section.
Harry frowned to be having thoughts like that here, but he wasn’t foolish enough to the think these walls truly impenetrable to Harry’s insecurities. Still, Harry focused on the positives: very soft bed, close to Draco, and extremely clean and neat private bathroom. Soon infinite clean clothes would come, and possibly again the intimacy that Harry craved from Draco now. He wanted to kiss him again and again, but he was gone after the little ritual they’d developed.
"Of course," Harry nodded as if that made all the sense in the world. Sometimes he was able to pretend he knew what Draco was getting at. Sometimes.
“’Dear MTV,’” Harry read aloud. “’My name is Ruth, I’m a nursing assistant from Texas, and I’ve been completely swept off of my feet by a guy I met online named Chris. We may live on opposite sides of the country, but for the past two years I’ve been falling more and more in love with him and his sweet personality. He’s not like other guys that I meet.”
In an attempt to say Draco’s name, Harry just wound up getting out a couple of mangled vowels before his release came. When it hit him, his whole body tensed for a moment and he could have sworn he saw some kind of white light.
Her most vivid memory was of Narcissa curled up in the girl’s dorm after hours reading a letter by the green fireplace. Her sister Bellatrix’s face was in the fire smiling at every word Narcissa read aloud.
“Yes, Grace, even we have arguments. Trying to acquire a baby has led to more than a few,” he said in a very matter-of-fact manner. “How in the world did you think Harry and I were perfect?”
“Then it shall be yours.” Draco slid his palm down Harry’s length and curled his fingers around it. “Relax, my dear. Just lay back and relax.”
“I do,” Harry whimpered close to a moan, leaning further into Draco. Their different colognes had been mingling all day and Harry loved the smell. “I’m not,” he clarified softly. “A Drag Queen. I’m a man and I just... like this.”
“We got to know each other in ways no one else has. We survived my parents, a crazed boss and intern, a judgmental world who would rather gay people be silent and sexless. And… it’s got me thinking.” Draco was running out of breath despite his sentences being of average length and Harry could feel it.
It scared Sirius that Nott Sr. had somehow known that it was the last fond memory they all shared before the war. It made him wonder if the creepy bastard had been perched in a tree with a pair of binoculars watching them.
On his way into the employee locker room that connected him to the owl perch where a woman neatly sorted the mail by Healer’s name, Draco was accosted once more.
Draco, per usual, was all talk. His confidence in the evening not dissolving into something they’d both regret was feigned. Pretending that he wasn’t at all short of breath, he reached for light switch and the room went dark.
Harry had received everything from ‘too tall’ to ‘too much facial hair’ to ‘annoying and juvenile’ to ‘looks like the sort of wimp who would hate loop-de-loop roller coasters’ to ‘for fuck’s sake, this one is just pitiful’. Draco was a picky one.
The corners of Draco’s lips curled up cattishly. “So that’s why you couldn’t keep your eyes off me sixth year, hm?” Draco teased.
She looked to her cousin-in-law and nodded blankly before Remus could guide her and her shell-shocked husband to the dining room table.
Once all the cameras were turned off after that, Draco was free to grumble, “And what a hotel it is…”
Harry nodded slightly with the fingers in his mouth, tongue lavishing across them and wrapping around them wherever he could. Draco’s continued licks kept Harry pressed flush to the bed and wriggling for him. Harry was hard but knew better than to pleasure himself without permission, so he channeled his frustrations into sucking on Draco’s fingers like they were his cock.
“You were our blessing,” Narcissa hissed through gritted teeth. “And always will be, Draco. We only want what is best for you.” Following Draco, Narcissa was never able to get pregnant again no matter how she tried, so she poured all her love into her one son. “I would go to the ends of this earth for you, my love. Your loving Harry Potter won’t change that.”
“And my only,” Draco nodded sagely. “It is the two of us against the injustices of the world, just as I said before. We have so many more wrongs to right, Harry. Have you ever been to a wizarding amusement park? Or a proper masseuse?”
With a loud hum Harry leaned back into Draco’s touch. The first finger slid in so easily Harry could hardly believe the lack of resistance he was giving. It seemed his body took to training quickly. That pleased Draco as well, earning a hum of approval in return.
Draco pulled Harry’s nipple forward and secured the clamp around the base of it, letting go only when he was sure it was in the right place. “Oh,” said Harry again, this time a deeper groan. No matter where or how he moved he couldn’t escape the tight, tight sensation around his nipples.
Pansy sighed and took a seat in Draco’s office chair. “I know, I know. …You aren’t suspecting any of us, are you?”
With two plates fixed and ready to go, Draco levitated a tray lined with Irises and lavender sprigs. There was always the chance that Draco could return to the third floor and find it empty, and that would be a hurricane on his parade, but he hoped he was still up there. Irises stood for faith, hope, and trust.
Before he could scream out a ‘Yes! Finally!’, the waitress with the shirt malfunction dropped a copy of the Daily Prophet (hot off the presses) in between them, as the diner liked to pride themselves on. Keeping people full of food and information, they said, ignoring the fact that The Prophet wasn’t too keen on facts.
“Listen,” Harry chastised Draco. For someone who liked to pretend he was horribly regal, Draco really was an impatient man. “’I met Vera on a forum about theories on ‘The Shining’. Vera was so much fun to talk to at first. We’d chat for hours about movies and TV shows we both liked. We were boyfriend and girlfriend for a few months, but as time went on Vera got more and more possessive. She got angry whenever I posted pictures of me with friends who are girls.’”
“There’s no need to be curt, Draco,” Kingsley couldn’t help but fight back. His voice had returned to its usual gravelly sternness. “Consider it done.”
Harry hummed, eyelids fluttering at how just one finger of Draco’s could make him feel so open already. “I love it, Daddy. The stretch, the burn, the way it almost feels like it’s too much, like it shouldn’t fit but it does—you
Draco tensed, hoping they hadn’t seen him, and thankfully those few entering hadn’t. Now there was the challenge to get all the way to his office on the third floor without being spotted and subsequently humiliated on the spot.
Draco prided himself on expensive skin creams, luxurious clothes, and in general being a snob, but he was also kind of a slob. He left clothes scattered everywhere like some maid was going to pick them up and ate like a pig.
“The last thing we need is you sneezing on Christmas,” Harry teased. He liked to team up with Draco’s parents to bug him. Harry just really loved bugging his husband in every way that he could.
“So thus far all we have is a name, a cellphone number, and a Facebook account,” Harry listed. “Let’s start by finding out who the phone number is registered to.”
“What does that even mean? Eiffel towers everywhere?” Draco snorted. “I never understood the obsession, France is fine…” It was also where his parents were kept to ‘keep wizarding society safe’.
“I think I could easily wrestle you into a cupboard under some stairs and lock the door,” Draco snarled with a sadistic grin. “Harry said you were on the wrestling team, actually. Are you aware of how homoerotic that is? Pinning another sweaty bloke down on a mat in tight, tight spandex while people watched to prove your dominance? That’s so gay.”
“Sorry,” Harry said again. “My mind, it just… wanders. I can’t keep it in one place. I’m exhausted when I want to be awake and alert when I want to be asleep. You… you’re right about the shower thing. I’ll eat and go wash up,” he promised.
Oh, why did Harry have to be so nice and understanding? It was maddening when Draco was feeling so inadequate. “Right,” he faltered. “Let’s start. First things first—the paint for the library.”
“Ew.” Harry made a face. Recalling Draco’s promiscuous past was not one of his treasured hobbies. “What if you got caught, though?”
“Yes, my pet, Daddy’s going to rub you raw,” Draco assured him smoothly. “Open those whore legs now, you won’t get anywhere trying to escape from me.”
Harry nodded. “I would also like,” he now had the footing to say. “For you to indulge me in other things. I’ve never tried much of it, but… I think I would like to be spanked.”
“You cannot seriously mean to tell me that you found the meaning of living life and it’s for Draco Malfoy?” Ron demanded in a softer but urgent tone.
Theo was torn. He’d done a stupid, impulsive thing, and was left to face the reality of it. Honestly, he felt like he’d been dreaming when he bought the ring. All Theo had to do was put a sack of gold coins on the table and the ring was his, to do whatever he wanted with. He could tie it to a kite and let the thing sail into the clouds and land in an inner city kid’s TV antennae and that kid could pawn it off for thousands. He could throw it into the ocean like that muggle movie he’d watched about the ship and the iceberg.
Draco’s ‘yes’ came in the form of Draco’s fist closing around the front of Harry’s pyjama shirt and closing the space in between them again.
Another groan left Draco’s lips. “Fine,” he sighed, the second time he’d been coerced into something inadvisable that day.
“Obviously, Harry. We’re kidding,” Draco reassured him, amused that Harry actually wanted to point that out. Draco usually just insulted people he was fond of and assumed they would understand that it was in good fun.
Some of the portraits on the wall had changed, but the ever-moving stairs remained a fixture of the castle. Draco was only a few steps behind Harry on the stairs and did his best to look away from the swish of Potter’s robes. It was becoming increasingly inconvenient how attractive this man was. Draco wondered if there was anyone in Hogsmeade their age, or if Potter was to be the only eye-candy in miles.
The bruise around her lip where the wolf had slammed its snout into a tree was almost gone. “Hey,” Olivia said before crawling onto the bed with them, tucking her knees in close to her chest. “What’s this?”
The next crack of the flogger tails was even harder, and Draco was sure to bring it down across his nipples. “Good boy,” he murmured as he watched Harry arch up into the blow. “I’m going to mark you all up.”
“Quite the spread,” Harry noted, hoping his nerves weren’t showing through in his voice. Through the slits in his mask he could look forward but not quite in his periphery. It made the rooms beyond look smaller, like the dungeon had shrunk. Not having his glasses was also proving difficult. Was that person by the buffet Blaise? He was not wearing very much.
By the time Draco returned to the dressing rooms with his selections, Harry was being handed his through the slot. “Let me know if you need assistance,” Draco offered even though it likely wasn’t necessary. He just wanted to remind Harry from the dressing room next door that he was still very much here and with him.
Draco’s hand found Harry’s under the table and they intertwined their fingers in a gesture of unity.
Harry swallowed, opening his mouth but hesitating for just a second too long, earning him another, harsher spank. “Ah! You do! You do, Daddy, you own me. I’m yo-ou-ouuurs,” Harry’s response turned to a loud, whiny moan at how far Draco was pushing him open now with three fingers to stretch him.
At least there was that, Draco used to assure himself that his submissive wouldn’t be too forlorn without him, Harry taking an interest in the kitchen. “I look forward to what you come up with,” Draco replied, swinging his feet over the side of the bed and springing up, fully nude with a few love bites on his right shoulder from Harry.
“Oh, I know exactly where you got your invitations,” Draco scowled. “Copied them right off of my desk, just like I knew you would.”
Yet the Pureblood talent of self-delusion would only last for a moment. Reality was closing in on her faster than she was ever prepared for.
“So we can come back and find our daughter is marching on the Ministry building in hemp clothes while she protests civil injustice?” Draco asked playfully.
“I’m doing really, really well.” He laughed. “Okay, that sounded fucking pathetic. I’m happy! I don’t know, I think there’s just more than this job out there for me. I mean, I’ve instituted the changes I have always wanted to see, and I know you’ll continue that legacy.”
Draco faltered slightly at the mention of them and on instinct he wanted to block the question with another question. But if real trust was to be had here, then Draco couldn’t rely on impulse alone. “They are well,” he began. “As you likely know, they are still under house arrest in the France Estate. They keep to themselves, follow all the rules outlined for them in the trial. Mother’s taken up painting and baking.”
. Maybe,” he breathed onto Harry’s wanting lips. “One day I’ll tie you up, put a thrusting dildo in you and see how many times I can make you come in a row.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “It’s a bit too little and too late for my taste,” he scoffed. “But you’re right about one thing: you need Harry. Whether or not he’ll be there for you is the real question.”
The Dursleys hadn’t taken their Christmas decorations yet, most likely because they expected Harry to. He wasn’t doing it this year, not after the way Dudley boasted about his new 3DS and iPhone 5. If they were going to give Dudders top-of-the-line technology and Harry dusty old books most likely found in a resale shop, then he wasn’t fucking cleaning up after them.
Harry pulled out his phone and showed Draco the screen: 6:13. “Right now,” he served up as his final challenge to Draco.
“Anyway, if they say anything sideways I’ll—I’ll—“ Draco couldn’t say he’d hex these muggles because that was unusually cruel and a violation of the Statute of Secrecy. So what could he do? The only punch he’d ever thrown in his life was getting one in on a paralyzed Harry who couldn’t even fight back.
Lucius let out a belabored sigh, putting his hand over his face. “Is it photos?” he drawled in his deep, posh voice. “Please tell me I raised a son with enough sense not to let his dirty photos get out.”
Draco’s heart seized in his chest to hear something so sweet that he was so sure he didn’t deserve. “Harry…”
Draco walked past the poison wing and towards the general patients section of the second floor. There were some patients from the past that could have asked for him by name, but how had they known to send the intern after him?
Back in the lobby on the far side of the Delaware Hotel, ‘Mr. Lark’ paid the real receptionist his bribe in cold, hard cash.
He shook his head. “For interrogation.” Kingsley had been right about the number potential witnesses already in custody at Azkaban.
Draco’s own arousal hung heavy between his legs, ignored for now so that he could focus entirely on Harry.
“Got you,” Harry murmured against her head in their family hug. Draco’s forehead and his rested against one another, looking down to their perfect baby. She wasn’t technically a baby anymore what with the ability to run and the complete sentences, but Draco and Harry couldn’t help but see that squirming little darling they picked up from the bio-mother at the hospital.
A half an hour later, Harry and Draco were at the doorstep of Ruth Greenway. She lived in a tiny house off a major road and she had hanging plant pots on each side of her front door. If someone had asked Draco to picture the living space of the sort of young woman who fell in love with ‘models’ online, he wouldn’t have pictured this.
“You have an Imperius on your record, Malfoy,” snarled the Auror holding his left arm, twisting it slightly. Draco braced his face to be stony and not show the pain.
That made Draco smirk before he slid off his pants. Finally free, his cock hung low before Draco could grasp it and start pumping. “You like the idea of all of our unsuspecting friends being seated somewhere where we’ve fucked?”
“Right,” Draco nodded, his thoughts having momentarily been elsewhere in the land of possibility—the possibility of Harry bent over washing the floor in a maid’s outfit.
Draco wasn’t as attuned to Hermione as he was to Harry, Theo, Pansy, Blaise… Or, well, anyone else. The woman was an enigma, and when she shrunk back into herself in the bed for a moment to think, he thought it was purely out of confusion over the obviously uninhibited couple in front of them.
The Headmistress gave Jeremiah a handshake and breathed a sigh of relief. That was the last of them. Another successful class. No drop-outs, no (massive) scandals, no new wars, Slytherins and Gryffindors had begun to end their squabbling, and McGonagall hadn’t so much as heard a rumor of parent complaints this year. These young minds were out of her hands now, and hopefully on their way to success. Hopefully.
“I am not babying them,” who Grace supposed was Lucius Malfoy replied. She shivered. It hadn’t been a total failure at all, and Tiffany would owe her a galleon. Never bet against a determined Slytherin. “I’m trying to get them to properly protect themselves!”
Draco slid almost all the way out and then pushed back in, earning a groan from the both of them at once. He repeated the motion, this time faster, and the next time faster, until he had established a savage rhythm that echoed in the bathroom every time their skin slapped together.
“You’re awful,” Harry decided, covering his smile. “And I would think the goblins would have noticed the smell.”
“Do you think Draco and Harry will be good parents? Or will they ruin the kid like they were ruined by the Lupins?”
“I don’t mind tasting the rainbow, either,” Harry said and went for more. It took him a moment to realize his own accidental double-entendre.
The first bite Harry took of the mystery pastry was a revelation. He hummed loudly, almost a moan if he hadn’t held back at the end of it. “Strawberry—delicious! And so flaky,” Harry exclaimed before swallowing. “What are the little golden beads in the center, though?”
"Oh, Harry. Sweet, simple Harry,” Pansy sighed fondly and Harry wasn’t sure if he liked the sound of it. “Anything you bloody well want. If you could have one thing in the entire world regardless of cost right now: what would it be?”
He had to present himself as harmless but not spineless, and proper but not snobbish. It would be a bit like walking a social tightrope and Draco wasn’t looking forward to the effort that would take.
“What’s more important to you?” Harry demanded as he pulled on his black Auror robes. “Your father’s approval—which by the way, you already have, and if this changes it then it was never real in the first place—or for me to start a family with you?”
“Thank you for defending my honor, Theodore,” Draco said his full name because he knew it’d annoy him. Draco could hardly resist; being contrary was their thing.
“What about you? You date much?” Harry followed up, shying slightly under Draco’s gaze when it turned hungry. Had he really just called him pretty? “I imagine you do.”
“I think I’m having Vietnam flashbacks,” Sirius said flatly, referring to his childhood as a pointless war. “You two are so rich you probably think these floors polish themselves.”
“Yes,” Harry gasped. Yes to not touching himself because when Draco touched him like this his own palm seemed weak in comparison.
“I imagined a million conversations in my head with you before I met you, and then I tried to act like your best friend. Hell, I trusted you with my unborn baby as if you were the most qualified men in the world; you and Harry both.” The anger trickled out of her in a steady stream.
On his day off in the middle of Mason, Michigan (a singularly boring town, as Harry had learned when he snuck out to explore a little) Harry decided it was best to stay in and surf the internet rather than the frigid waves of the local lakes—which were all inexplicably brown.
The place wasn’t exactly hopping but there were a few customers coming in and out as Harry approached it from the street. He was glad to see at least some people his age or older than him. He’d been worried it would all be children and parents and he’d seem out of place or strange. At least nobody would recognize him as ‘The’ Harry Potter here, though they might see him as a bizarre adult.
“Or can you just use the floo?” Ginny gathered the girl’s frilly pink undergarments from the foot of the bed and handed them over. It was regretful that such a beautiful woman had to dress herself and cover up the breasts that Ginny and Blaise had just been savoring together, but it was getting late.
“Fuck,” Draco roared, nails digging into Harry’s ankles. The countertop made his knees ache, but it was so worth it.
Ron would have given Harry a friendly clap on the shoulder if he weren’t currently naked and wrapped around Draco Malfoy. “Oh, just you wait until I show you the embarrassing photos we have of him from second year,” Ron grinned. Malfoy had proven himself reformed to Harry, so Ron supposed he should trust his friend’s judgment, but some old habits died hard.
“But if you’re the one who runs Safeword—are you the one who sold my story?” Harry asked in disbelief.
Something truly eerie happened next. Like a mirror image, Draco stepped to the table as Lucius did the opposite side, each Malfoy man pulling out a seat for their significant other.
“I don’t know,” Harry shrugged. “Most of the preschools we’ve looked at say they start accepting kids at two years old. Speaking of which, do you prefer the Place for Kids or Building Blocks? I think Building Blocks has nicer teachers.”
Harry swallowed and looked to Draco for help. Draco just smirked, leaving Harry up the creek without a paddle. Draco was better at this stuff than Harry was, and he had admittedly been skating by on his new boyfriend’s skill in order to pass.
“Oh,” Harry sighed. “Thank you, Daddy.” Harry stepped out of them and wiggled his toes on the carpet. It felt good to be free.
I really feel like writing Teen Wolf fic but I hate American slang for male sex organs. My life is so rough.
The real receptionist was a stout man of fifty with dark skin. He could care less about what some MTV crew really wanted when they were paying him so much to ‘step out’ for fifteen minutes while one of their actors talked to the hosts of some show. “My lips are sealed. You have a good night, now.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “And she’d prefer if you not bring it up at dinner this Friday with the Weasleys, not Weasels. Wait a minute. Did you hate her so much because you were jealous of her as a kid?”
Harry frowned and scrolled until he found the first mention of it. “Here. ‘Emmett and I have been together for three years and about a year ago he told me that if he ever gets to meet me in person, the first thing he’s doing is proposing to me. I guess that’s kind of like an engagement.’ Wow.”
Harry knew it was for the best in the end. At least, that was what he hoped was the best. “That gives us four days, then.”
“Fantastic. You know, I find making trains and their environments to be very relaxing. Helps me focus the ole noggin. They’re great for people of any age, and the hobby has a great community.” The man stopped at a shelf of engines and Harry’s eyes immediately went to the most familiar-looking one. A stylish, black and red conductor’s booth that looked exactly like the Hogwarts Express.
“I don’t care what you and your boyfriend do! Look, I have to go, my father’s physical therapy is almost done and I have to pick him up,” she dismissed them. Draco snorted at the ‘boyfriend’ comment, since that would only happen in Harry’s dreams.
“I’m not a racist,” Draco sighed from his spot by the head of the dining room table. “And you know I don’t believe in any of that bullshit my parents taught me. Not anymore.” When Harry still didn’t respond and crunched away at his toast, Draco tried approaching him. “Don’t you know I got past that?”
“You’re sweet,” Draco observed as he stroked Harry’s arm. He used Harry’s chest as a pillow and could hear his steady heartbeat like a drum in his ear.
Shifting in her chair, Umbridge considered telling Harry to keep quiet about her to the other prisoners. They were already the desolates of the desolates. “If you’re looking for answers, Marcus Nott has them.”
Umbridge caught on quickly, a mischievous smile overtaking her flat, pale face. “I think it was… Bryan? Bryan Freidman?”
“No hair gel. No cheap foundation. You’re going to have to redo it all—“ Draco cut himself off when Harry entered his line of sight. Harry gave him the signal. “Actually, I think I’ll just redo it myself. I’ll be fine.” Draco hopped out of the chair and sped off.
“S’true. That’s all,” Harry muttered without looking up from his notepad. The crush he harbored for Draco felt like it was flowering in the pit of his stomach. “Um. Go on.”
When they eventually had to part for air Harry let out a shuddery sigh. “Why do I have a feeling this bath is going to make us more dirty than it is clean?” he grinned.
Harry moaned as Draco’s fingers curled inside of him, disappearing into him to rock his hips gently back into the bed.
Harry moaned, head tipped over his shoulder so he could get his best view of Draco. The blonde was looking particularly smug and Harry couldn’t blame him for the man truly had him in the palm of his hand like this.
“Oh, I don’t know,” Harry mused, kicking off his shoes. “Should I retell all of the jokes you made about my parents? Or would it be better if I slipped a note in your locker with a picture of you in a dress on it? Wait, wait, I know! I’ll refresh your memory with one of
She’d never grown up around wealth. Sure, she wasn’t panhandling on the street, but this was serious money. The kind that could control a government if Draco and Harry wanted to.
With Kingsley’s plan having succeeded in spite of Draco wanting to give the man what he wanted, there would doubtlessly be some mention of Draco and Harry’s personal life.
“When was it?” he asked softly. Remus’ worst fears had been realized when he’d seen the look on Draco’s face. It was clear that the poor boy had been there.
Draco scowled. He was not fond of being reminded of his embarrassing moments, especially when Harry Potter had been there to witness them and laugh at them, and Draco was not a particularly trusting man. “I’m just warning you,” he muttered.
She didn’t need to open her eyes to see who it was. In fact, Grace was dead set on keeping them screwed shut.
Harry gave Draco’s nose a little bop. “And I love your nose, no matter how much you tell me it’s too big. I like the little bump in the middle, and I think it really suits you.”
Kennedy paused when she recognized the men that had been on her computer screen just hours ago in her driveway accompanied by a whole SUV of camera-toting men and women. “Oh.”
Harry’s manager gave him a look from across the shop in reference to the new customers that had lined up while Harry was having his fun, and Harry quickly realized that he’d let the line pile up quite a bit. They were all staring at him, too.
Draco’s hands flew up to cup Harry’s cheeks with a smile tugging at the lips that were busy kissing Harry.
“I can’t see without my glasses,” Harry lied before bumping his hand into the boy who had them captive.
Draco took it as pillowtalk and smiled anyway. There was no way he could really mean that. “My bed is always open to you.”
Harry set it to a low rainbow pulse, falling asleep with ease after watching the colors blend and move around the room.
Once someone got Draco talking about how Azkaban used to be run, it was hard to get him to stop. He would rant and rave about the blatant disregard for human rights the prison had. After a short stay there, Draco could see his own father fray at the edges. Dementors were a form of psychological torture, Draco said, and that fell under the ‘cruel and unusual punishment’ label.
“Er.” Sure it was, right? Oh, Harry was going to kick his arse for taking such a long pause. “It is.”
That was officially too much information. Harry patted Draco’s shoulder and gave him a look that translated directly to a: ‘Why would you tell someone that?’ before climbing off of Draco’s lap and into his own swivel chair.
It was hard to focus on complete and utter idiots with medical problems when Draco’s husband had told him that they’d found a fucking femur bone in the shrieking shack.
“I know what ‘magazine’ you’re referring to, Draco. I am your father, after all. Your hiding places were obvious to me when you were at Hogwarts.” Lucius thought back on their old home with pride for what it was before The Dark Lord came and ruined every corner and floorboard with his rot.
“That’s my eager slut,” Draco cooed, squeezing his thigh almost painfully tight. Harry let out a quiet sigh, head tipping back. As soon as he’d exposed his neck Draco went for the jugular, literally.
Narcissa was still laughing, too, and didn’t stop even when Draco uttered his ominous warning. “Wait, let me guess,” she interjected. “If I may.”
Grace’s stomach churned with an unshakable nausea that made her hands shake when she looked up at the offending cake and the container of icing next to it. She would have to open that container. She would have to get a knife. She would have to ice the cake alone.
Draco nodded. It seemed like a simple enough case to set the tone for the season, and if it somehow wound up actually being Chris then that would be their first success story. “Did she leave a Skype number?”
The stained-glass windows let in a flood of light that swept across the floor. People were seated in the pews, but every time Theo looked to see their faces, they turned their head away. Not even the religious figures could face Theo from the paintings hung above the lines of candles. It made Theo uneasy. “Hello?” he tried. All he got back was the echo of his voice off of the vaulted and gilded walls.
Lucius wasn’t at all pleased with Draco’s choice of a mother, but that was admittedly reassuring. His granddaughter was all his. In writing.
“Where can we set up to ask you some more questions about Brooke?” Harry asked. The crew had gotten plenty of footage of them standing around with her father, and Harry knew if it were him on that couch he wouldn’t appreciate all the cameras in his home.
People around them were starting to stare, but most of the gamers were absorbed in the words on their screens with headphones plugging up their ears and protecting them from the real world where two boys who thought they’d had something special were pointing fingers at one another.
Draco sighed. It was a good thing they weren’t looking each other in the eye because his face was getting awfully red. Using his singing voice—he wasn’t sure if anyone had heard him sing in years. “Okay. One song.”
Though Grace had to say, she really was looking forward to parent-teacher night. She’d have to tell Draco and Harry about how she was the one who whipped the Malfoy-Potter girl into shape in Defense Against the Dark Arts.
He opened the door and saw what had once been a tiny scroll now a massively long piece of parchment paper running all the way from his desk to the bed and back again. “Oh,” he said in pleasant surprise. “Well, alright then.” It looked like he had some serious reading to do.
“Oh, sorry, I—“ the other man said nervously, only seeing the Auror insignia. If he was caught like this, then he knew it would be hell all over again.
Ah, right. There they were. The hopeless romantics, the not-so-web-savvy, the entirely naïve and the utterly resilient Catfish story stars. They were lined up behind the curtain and would go out in the order their episode aired for interviews.
There was no room for the cowardice Draco had been able to display under his mother’s wing during the war in the real world when she wasn’t there to protect him.
“But Kennedy could accept it in the end! You heard them in the interview, they were willing to work through this together. At least Brooke only lied about her appearance. Chris lied about his job, his whereabouts, his true feelings,” Harry listed.
Maybe he could slip it in some girl’s drink at a restaurant when she was on a date with some boy and watch him have a conniption.
“My morals are the same, and in case you haven’t noticed, nothing you push me through can change that.” Harry briefly thought of the way he’d fought against Draco’s eagerness to give in to the wishes of his parents concerning the blood purity of their child. “I have never been opposed, not once in my life, to breaking some rules.”
He made it past the reception desk without Pansy spotting him—thank Merlin, he really wanted to be alone—and ducked past the security guard with a brief flash of his Healer’s badge. He wasn’t out of the woods just yet.
Harry was having to face the fact that he didn’t know much about London, especially his current area of the city. His muggle phone was a lifesaver, guiding him in the right direction.
Harry agreed with the last bit, but had dated plenty of men who were still in closet. They always seemed so afraid, and Harry knew they had reason to be. “Still. I don’t want to doubt Brooke for being disingenuous about homophobia. It hits too close to home for me to doubt it.”
“Good.” Harry reached behind himself and unclasped the bra with some effort. Once Draco caught on to what he was doing he helped Harry take the socks off, too, tossing them to the side where his panties had been discarded. “Thank you,” Harry said, for the help and for getting him these clothes in the first place. “I did need that.”
“Everything smooth sailing in the land of the Scots?” Pansy asked teasingly from her spot on Maggie’s bed.
Harry barreled through the dining room to snatch a leftover piece of toast from the cupboards and made a mental note that a shopping trip was definitely in order.
Harry wasn’t going to challenge him there, taking the few he was handed and turning them over in his hands.
“You’re so horny for it,” Draco sighed. “What about your past boyfriends? Were none of them good in bed?” Harry always seemed to be wrapped in fantasy than actual great sex, especially when Draco was the one talking about the fantasy and he was sitting wide-eyed in his bed.
Hermione smiled warmly. “Good. Now, quit looking so miserable. You’re going to meet the mother of your child soon,” she advised, sounding far too much like Narcissa in that moment.
And then came Draco’s throaty, low laugh. Harry could feel the vibrations even through their clothes.
“He’s still scraggy and listens to jazz,” Blaise nodded sagely. “So by that logic, he is still definitely hot.”
Draco swallowed back his fear. “Do you need to go to the hospital?” he asked carefully. Draco couldn’t afford to think back to that night in the Manor. Not after he’d come so far.
“What? Get a grip, you big poof. Colin is going to love it and you know that,” Draco told him quickly, standing up to take the ring in his hand. Next to Draco’s silver wedding ring with a glowing ammolite chunk, the gold of Colin’s band looked even more brilliant. It looked like string, like the metal was molten enough to bend and curve to Draco’s touch. “Tell me what you were thinking when you bought it.”
“I was going to tell you later,” Remus said, giving his husband a look before stringing an arm around his shoulders. “But we want to take you shopping so you can fill it.”
“I think they’re pretty,” Draco decided. “You’re going to be fun to play dress-up with. You want to keep playing with Daddy?”
Ron blinked and turned to Malfoy with the two officers clearly trying to sprain something of his. “Put him down. Only get him if he runs,” Ron allowed cautiously.
The woman’s gaze went to the door, so Harry took that as a sign to step out of her territory. He closed the booth door behind him and moved seamlessly back into the frenzy of people rushing around.
“Clearly, Harry! You’re being so self-destructive right now! And for what?” Ron shook his head. “You have no idea what went through our minds, Harry, when we saw that box missing. Everything you care about in this world, gone, like you’d taken it to—to… you know.”
“It’s not so bad,” Charlie shrugged, answering the question that Lucius had never asked. “We only have to do it once a month.”
Ron gritted his teeth. “Then I would help them,” he said, looking to Harry. “I would want to help them find his body so that there could be a proper funeral and a proper goodbye.”
Hermione gave him a look, curious with how they were going about all of this. “And what exactly constitutes as ‘not ready’ for adoption?” she asked. Whatever it was, Hermione hoped they could spot it.
Narcissa noticed the change in Harry’s tone. “Lucius,” she requested of her husband. “It’s my turn to ask a question. Harry Potter—do you love my son?”
“I love it so much I’ve got vacation days stocked up for weeks. I’m taking as many as I need indefinitely to train you. If you still want it in the morning tomorrow then we’ll begin. As far as training goes you need a schooling like you’ve never had before, and I can give it to you if you really want to be my submissive.”
“Owl me nude pictures later,” Pansy decided before waiting for an answer and running up to her flat. Yes, that was it. Nude pictures, a bottle of wine, and a terrible book could fix every problem in her life thus far, so she hoped it wouldn’t disappoint her this time.
“No one is required to join a scene,” Draco assured him. “It’s not a free-for-all; there are rules. For example, if we went I’d claim you as my submissive and flaunt you in front of the other Dominants, but never let them touch what’s mine.”
But in the present Draco was pleased, and the room was done and ready to be stocked. “Thank you, Harry, I really couldn’t have done this without you. I was experiencing such a mental block with how this house is tied to my family and my sense of self.”
He saw Draco cross-legged on the bed in his pyjamas, eyes distinctly red in the harsh glow of the computer screen.
“Am I ever going to get to meet your parents? I mean, if they don’t perish at the thought of their daughter courting a woman.” Maggie wasn’t even sure if Pansy’s parents knew much about their relationship beyond what The Prophet said.
With a huff, Draco squirmed around in his sheets to try and find some more physical comfort where he wasn’t getting any emotionally. He was out in the open in front of Harry with no armor or weapons.
Draco let out a whine at the very thought of retelling the story but went on anyway so he could have company in his pity party. “First Flint started babbling about his excruciatingly ordinary job as a financial consultant,” he drawled. “Like I care what to invest in, I’m so rich already, it was really terrible conversation.”
different countries while ring shopping, and called a waiter a ‘senseless plebian’ when he folded a napkin the wrong way. Don’t tell me marriage isn’t a big deal, you twat!”
What made Potter so popular? Draco wondered if he might sit in on one of his classes sometime to see the man in action. Maybe it was one of those situations where the students were attracted to him because he was young. They were both twenty-eight now, but for a wizarding school that had seen Headmasters turn 300 that was very young for a professor.
Harry walked around the side of the bed and climbed on, slinking his way across the comforter. Harry turned so his arse was facing Draco and propped himself up on his hands and knees once more. His legs were spread far enough apart and his body bent over just enough to see glimpses of his panties under his fluffy skirts.
From the outside it looked a bit antagonistic, but they knew that it was all a big joke. Their sick senses of humor blended together perfectly.
“Did you not know my name before?” Harry laughed. He knew he was supposed to hold his tongue around the customers, but this was just ridiculous. “How long have you been coming here, a year?”
“Mr. Malfoy, right on time,” came the elderly man’s warble, voice shaky with age. “My onions are waiting for you to give them a good home. That fancy house on the hill have room for some onions?”
“That was when I thought we were on the same page, you deviant. We were the ones who wanted you and Draco to have children,” he pointed out. “And then you had to go to get on your moral high horse like you always do.” A Potter had ended the line of Malfoys in the world. A
Harry made a face. It really, really had been. He’d sat through Ron’s vivid descriptions of his and Hermione’s, er, ginger-making, but that was Harry’s limit. Plus, he could get revenge on Ron by taking him up on his offer to have more bloke-talk to describe his and Draco’s non-child-producing rolls in the sheets.
“Alright, kids, listen to your Healer,” Remus sighed and ruffled the hair of those ones who had hair. He turned to the old man as if they were sharing a secret. “I’m a teacher, don’t worry. I understand kids. My husband and I are also in the process of adopting, aren’t we love?”
Draco—who considered airplane food to be somewhere below garbage—had whined about how Harry’s airline chicken was worse than the food at their high school. It smelled foul enough to make Draco plug his nose, too.
“Sure, Mr. Uni-verrrr-sitty,” Sirius cooed. Remus was so cute when he tried to focus after smoking gillyweed. He got those tiny little lines on his forehead, the ones that made Sirius want to kiss him. However, if they started kissing again, they’d probably never leave the house.
Draco finished his calligraphy on the baby shower invitations with a dramatic flourish. “Perfect. Round up the owls, Harry.”
They’d rehearsed for cues and marks the day before, so that wasn’t a problem. What was a problem was the crowd of faces staring up at them. They burst into applause immediately when Harry and Draco stepped into view.
“Well, summer between fourth and fifth year I was really sick of being out of the loop. I snuck into the adult attic section of a bookstore I had to take two buses to get to. I spent three hours alone up there before the shopkeep found me and tossed me out, but that was more than enough time to read. They didn’t have much gay stuff, but they had a lot, and I mean
?” he said in a half-snarl half-laugh due to his shock. “Thank Salazar you don’t work in the psychoanalytics wing.”
Harry did a little spin to give Draco a full view of the outfit. The suitjacket was red with black accents and lapels and trousers, no tie but a black ribbon made into a loose bow over a white shirt finishing off the look.
“Thank you,” Wesley said again, his face framed by his poor-quality webcam. “She always said she couldn’t chat on camera, but I’ve heard her voice on the phone, ah, I’m rambling. I thought this was a hopeless cause, is all. Just—thank you. I can’t wait until this is all over.”
Oh, fuck. Why did Colin have to be so nice? “I’m fine, and she’s doing well. I should be asking you that question,” he said without the ability to hide how his voice was wracked with guilt.
Draco took off the glasses slowly to make sure he did not bend or break them. They were placed on the bedside table with the same loving attention. Draco kept the nearsightedness in mind, or so he would say if pressed, and got quite close to Harry’s face. “While you were changing I fetched you a glass of water. IF you need anything else, I am right down the hall.”
Narcissa was oddly quiet. Draco looked at his mother and saw her smiling almost… wickedly? There was something dangerous in her eyes.
Not even Draco could hold back a laugh at that. “Shut up,” he said as he tried to tense his mouth down from his smile.
“Plus, if I screw things up horribly, then at least they’ll have a couple of great godparents to take care of them.” Harry and Draco had argued about that, too. But who the hell else would Draco want? Pansy Parkinson? It may or may not have been another clause in Harry agreeing to go with the fifty look-a-like candidates.
“What is, then?” he questioned a little desperately. All Harry wanted was for this to be over with. Planning for children was far more stressful than planning for a wedding. This was a future, functioning member of society that they were responsible for.
“It’s your cock, sir,” Harry said louder as he squirmed in the too-tight underwear. “I only come when you say.”
Draco reached the nursery, putting Hugo down in between one baby wrapped in a pastel yellow blanket and another swaddled in white. St. Mungo’s never liked the whole ‘forcing gender roles through pink and blue’ thing.
“Anything,” Draco said, voice soft. Harry was deep in subspace and Draco was willing to do anything to keep him happy there. “Anything you want is yours.” Did he need water, to be untied, a kiss…?
With a lazy wipe of his chest clean from a conveniently-placed towel on his nightstand—Draco’s foresight was uncanny—Harry invited Draco to rest his head on his chest. In reality Draco rested his entire self on Harry’s chest, climbing atop him without a care if he was crushing him. With some adjustment from Harry he no longer was crushing him, and the two could pant together for a moment as they came down.
They walked in silence with both men fretting that it was lasting too long. They walked down the street together, and Harry did notice a glare or two thrown their way. Harry had walked in public with men before, and more than once people had gotten confrontational. At least these were muggles, probably, though the concentration of wizards in London was high. Without Tom Riddle looming over their shoulders everyone had gotten a little freer, everyone except Harry.
“Because the worst is always there! Our producer lured us into fucking!” Draco shouted. Draco only realized what he was saying as it left his lips.
“Right. Goodbye, then.” And he turned away from her, leaving the office of The Prophet without a soul spotting him. He’d made it—and no one would know it was him.
“I wish! How interesting would that be?” Draco laughed. “But it’s just some cold case from the first war. Remus and Sirius were apparently friends of the victim, too.”
“Holy—Draco!” Harry sputtered, red-faced and uncomfortably aroused for being in a public space. “Other people get their mail here!”
“I know why you’re here,” she snarled. Her eyes looked different without mascara and a pound of eyeshadow; they looked sallower. “It’s about one of your Dumbledore’s Army friends.”
“He was the first I said the Three Words of Death to.” Those words, of course, being ‘I love you’. “His name was Patrick and he was a florist, so the flowers definitely helped.”
“Yes!” Draco shouted when the last bar on the crib finally popped into place, completing what had been an hour’s worth of baby-bed-related insanity. “
Harry would feel a lot better about acknowledging the fact that Draco was and always had been hot when Draco acknowledged what a complete dick he’d been and asked for both Ron and Hermione’s forgiveness.
“So, I can stay in your bed tonight?” Harry asked to reconfirm because there was no way in hell he was going back to that guest room if he had any say in it.
Both of the elder men quickly greeted Lucius and Narcissa when she finally worked up the nerve to enter the prison. She’d wanted Lucius to go in first, just to make sure nobody could see their faces from the prisoner’s side of the glass. Only when Lucius had spent fifteen minutes waving at Marcus from the two-way mirror with no reaction had he sent his peacock patronus to Narcissa with the message that they were in the clear.
. An incredibly official and meaningful step in a relationship that Pansy had never, ever done before.
“So, excuse me if I can’t take this anymore!” Harry’s voice climbed. “I’ve had reporters on my back since I was a kid. They follow me around, they place cameras in my office, and they
Most of the requests Harry made in bed were brilliant. They were naughty, filthy, and completely obscene. Draco loved him all the more for those wild ideas, and found it to be yet another lovely surprise of moving in with The Boy Who Lived after months of dating.
Remus knew exactly what article she was referring to. While there was usually one or two passages about the wizarding world’s most hated and simultaneously most loved power couple, they had made the front page that gossip rag just a few days ago. “Yes, I did. Where is this going?”
.” Draco was so excited that his camera hand was shaking and he’d forgotten the ‘keep the cursing to a minimum’ rule.
After one last satisfied look in the mirror Harry went down to the kitchen and grabbed the pink apron. Next he opened the cupboards and refrigerators up to scan the ingredients. Once he’d made all his choices Harry piled in the supplies, the cookbook, and set towards the fireplace triumphant.
“This place is insane,” Harry informed Draco the second they were alone again. “In a good way, of course.” Harry reached inside of his locker to feel the plush bathrobe, downy soft. He looked over at Draco to see him stripping with zeal, folding his clothes once they were off him to hang on the locker shelves.
And according to Draco, so did his friends. Every life that Voldemort touched festered with fear in dark corners. The whole world had been affected by him, even the children of his supporters.
“You are going to go see a Healer here for a physical and mental checkup,” Draco continued. “We will put your name in the selection, and we will assess—out of the many offers that we will receive—each and every aspect of this.”
Draco would maintain a strict distance from a man until that man proved his affections clearly enough for Draco’s taste.
“I’m sure it’s what I want for Lily Narcissa Malfoy-Potter, heiress to a fortune you could only dream of and daughter to two men who deserve your respect,” she answered, notably calmer.
“Never too much,” Harry replied shakily. The feeling of Draco softening inside of him was so intimate he hoped Draco never pulled him off of his lap. Harry never wanted this moment to end, all bleary and hazy in their post-coital bliss. “Just right.”
“It is quality, not quantity, which wins House Cups. It is cunning and ambition that gets you what you want in this world. Throwing in the towel before the year’s even begun? No, I won’t accept that. You’re Slytherins! Come on, say it now. What are you?”
The older man stood about as tall as Draco but he had a way of making even a Malfoy feel small in his presence. “Healer Malfoy,” Pye repeated since Draco was just staring at him with his mouth open.
Harry was giving Draco just what he wanted, too. Betrayed by his own penis. “Draco,” he insisted. “We never got a chance to finish talking about the deal with Grace.”
Dudley pretended not to be confused. “Oh, that sounds cool. Real cool. How long have you been married?”
Correction: teenage romance with Draco Malfoy was unbelievable. Other teens probably just made goo-goo eyes at one another and dry-humped while Harry was caught between wanting to throw up and wanting to yank Draco on top of him and kiss him senseless.
The brunette shifted in her worn black flats. They would have to buy her new shoes, too. “Sorry that I’m early,” Olivia piped up. “I just wanted to make sure we wouldn’t miss the train.”
Draco smirked. “Watch it, Harry. She’s got your number. Do you still want to come out with us tonight for dinner?”
As he gathered his things and led Ron to the fireplace, Harry took confidence in the fact that the Death Eaters he had sent there were mentally sound enough to answer some questions. They had a lot of explaining to do.
The stone had only been used twice after Harry and Draco’s wedding: once when Draco got particularly curious about meeting his in-laws, and once after a particularly bad encounter with the press.
“Ah, ah, ohh, that was, that was nice,” Harry breathed. The bra felt even tighter with his nipples throbbing from the overstimulation.
A smooth cotton button-down replaced the white robes with a violet hue, also known as Harry’s Favorite Color. The black trousers were slimming, too. At least Draco looked fit when he was surrounded by idiots.
The patriarch only ever apologized to two people in the world: his wife, and his son. The world would never see how broken he was after the Battle of Hogwarts, how he wept and clung to Narcissa and Draco for dear life decrying himself.
A little sigh escaped Remus. He had no idea what he’d do without his Padfoot, and no idea how he’d survived for twelve years without him. “I love you too.”
“It’s yours, Daddy. Both my holes are yours to use, and my hands, and my, my—“ Harry was overwhelmingly hard just thinking of the possibilities. “They’re your holes.”
The only established elements in the rear lawn were the thick, leafy plants on the perimeter and keeping it private, and green grass well-trimmed in the center of it. Harry squinted, and in the distance at the edge of the property saw a small building. He began his walk towards it, a pleasant sun warming his back.
“What ‘thing’, my cock?” Draco squeezed Harry’s arse. “You best respect what gives you such pleasure.”
Draco returned to his room and left the door open a crack just in case. Tonight they would sleep, and if Harry was still considering him, then he would still be here in the morning.
“I would prefer the kid to be gay,” Draco shrugged as he transitioned out of joking. He scanned a unicorn plushie for good measure in hopes of inducing a little queerer in their already queer household. “Then I don’t have to worry about becoming a grandfather and I can recommend all the best bars.”
Draco’s jaw dropped. “I, I mean, how could you think—? I, I, I, me? We’re talking about me, right? That’s—that’s—I mean, come on.” His face went bright pink.
It took far too long for her eyes to come into focus with the world around her. For a confusing moment, all she could see was a blurry mess of colors and blobs. If she’d have been able to access her voice, Grace may have yelled.
“Here’s an interesting one: ‘Dreams Turned to Nightmares’.” Harry clicked to open the email. “’Dear MTV, my story is not really typical. From what I’ve seen on the forums about this show, almost everyone is in love with the person they met online. I used to be, but not anymore.’”
Next came Draco’s trousers, falling in a pool around his ankles once he undid the button and zipper. He wore nothing but tight black briefs and decided quickly he couldn’t live with those on either. Shedding his last layer of clothing, Draco let it fall to the ground without a care.
“You’re killing me, Potter. Malfoy-Potter. My lawfully wedded husband whose thick, lovely cock I would very much like to have in my mouth. So beautiful, so handsome…” Draco moved from touching himself to running his hands up and down Harry’s thighs. “I want to feel you in the back of my throat. I’ll get it slick so you can push into me directly after. Wouldn’t you like that?”
At least Grace actually liked DADA, unlike her aunt’s pushing for her to play piano because of her ‘long, shapely fingers’. Those had been cruel hours glued to a piano bench.
“It’s rather complicated,” Sirius said smoothly. “We’re a wolf pack, actually...” he trailed off to look at her name tag. “Tanya.”
Harry’s body could stand it for a moment but soon he let out a little gag, driving Draco to push in deeper. Harry was manipulated by rough tugs on his hair, pulling Harry’s face up onto Draco. Each time his tip hit the back of Harry’s throat the poor darling choked, but that was what he’d signed on for. Draco was using Harry’s mouth as his own toy, pulling it off and onto him until Harry was gasping for air.
Were they even friends to begin with? What did someone call the person they flirted with, bickered with, wished better for, and had once slept with? Draco avoided the phrase ‘cared about’ because if he cared then he could be hurt.
Draco would never understand why Harry was so set on giving her a chance. She was rude, loud, and immature. Then again, that was probably what had gotten her pregnant in the first place. “This may come as a shock, but I’m Draco Malfoy-Potter.”
,” Harry exclaimed in a near-shriek. “Do not ever, ever put that image in my head again! What is wrong with you? You can’t say that for television!”
Harry used to think of Draco as a more-refined Dudley because he only saw the other two children, as a child, as bullies. As he grew up he found that bullying was something a person did because they felt powerless—not who they were. It was all a game to Dudley, tossing slurs and dunking on his weird gay cousin who he was forced to monitor. But something had changed in Dudley’s eyes. It crept in over time and then was fully present when Harry returned to their safehouse victorious from having literally saved the world: respect.
Even for Grace, this was extreme. She hated leering men and whistling construction workers and often flipped them the bird, but that night especially was not the night to fuck with her. She’d been kicked out of her house with a backpack of clothes and her best friend was on a useless vacation to the Bahamas. She didn’t have much to lose.
The scream was close to bursting when she finally found that stone bench. It had been warmed by the summer sun, but it thankfully wasn’t hot enough to keep her from sitting down.
That was what he’d come here for, after all, for Harry. There was very little at this point Draco wasn’t willing to do for the beautiful sod. He loved him, as much as it pained his vanity to admit it at times. Draco Malfoy loved Harry Potter, and at that dinner table it showed.
“You’re ridiculous.” Colin kissed his jawline before hopping out of the bed. Morning people confused and disturbed and confused Theo, and there he was, thinking about marrying one. “Now I’m making waffles.”
When they arrived at the grand fireplace of the ancient Manor, they had magicked the smell of sex off of themselves for the time being. It would come around to linger near them later, like it always did. However, when they stepped into the emerald halls, their host and hostess were nowhere to be found.
Harry visibly winced. He knew Draco well enough to know that cold tomatoes were the bane of his existence. The very sight of them made Draco ill, and as much as Harry liked to tease Draco, his shrill cries about how disgusting catsup was forced Harry to remove all related products from the flat.
“I was unaware you were seeking spice, but now that I am… Let’s try a classic,” Draco offered. “If Slytherin wins the House Cup, you’re going to wear, say, do everything I tell you to for twenty-four hours. The same applies to you, of course, if Gryffindor wins.”
Draco covered his father’s withered hand with his own. “We took care of everything, father. The paperwork is signed and the father has relinquished his rights. We tied every loose end.” Draco knew that his father’s sudden obsession with legalities was out of the urge to protect his son from being hurt, from having the sweet blob in that photo taken from him before it was even properly his.
Narcissa’s eyes narrowed. “There is maybe nothing I care about less than what you want for your son. Nothing. You’ll have to speak with my family’s lawyers about this matter if your dimwit spawn thinks he can sink his claws into my grandchild.”
He took a deep breath, centering himself on their white front door. Draco was within, and with him, the peace that a happy marriage gave him. Safety, sensitivity, and security.
“Go fuck yourself,” he told Draco fondly. That had put him in an infinitely better mood (as banter with best friends should). “I’m going to go talk to my father now.”
Draco visibly relaxed, drawing a snort of a laugh from Percy. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen any ex-Death Eater so terrified by a pack of kids,” he snarked.
“Draco, you mean so much to me,” Harry said. “I want things to be right between all of our family. I want… well, I want it to be ‘our family’.”
Harry’s concern for the garment faded when he looked down. The sight of what was going on between them alone made Harry feel so dirty, so obscene. Draco’s cock looked incredible gliding on his chest like that, and it was like nothing he’d ever experienced before. His heart was pounding. Draco never failed to incorporate
“Yes, yes I do,” Harry urged. He never considered himself a selfish lover, and being able to see Draco Malfoy come undone from his doing was the subject of many a wet dream of Harry’s. He wanted to be the one who pleased him in every way.
One of my hobbies is making fun of Theodore Nott 24/7, oh man. I hope you guys like him as much as I do. Now let’s get Draco and Harry in the same room again!
He loved his friends! Harry saw Ron like a brother and Hermione had been there for him in the toughest times of his life. Dean and Seamus were fun albeit mushy, and Neville was a loyal guy who never let Harry down.
This was ridiculous. “Tiff!” Grace shouted again before barreling into the bathroom with her wand drawn. “I will hex that dye right out of your hair unless you give me a straight answer.”
Draco gave Harry’s arse a squeeze. “I try at romance and you still want to be slapped around,” he grinned before sitting up and positioning himself between Harry’s legs so his hands rested on his thighs. “That’s my kind of bloke. Now, ready for me to fuck you? Oh, wait, I don’t care.”
“Yes, good, remember how much fun we had today. We picked out fountains, and statues, and all kinds of seeds. You were so happy to see the flowers.”
l.” They cut to a shot of Harry laughing with Draco and then immediately to one of them glaring at one another from their post-sex awkwardness.
Harry wanted it to be ‘our bed’, but maybe that was asking too much. That wasn’t really the arrangement, right? “Good,” Harry said anyway, taking off his glasses now that Draco was close enough to see clearly. “Because I’m here to stay.”
“Okay, enough suspense,” Draco sighed, bored of toying with Harry. He took the mouse and dragged one of the pictures of Emmett into the Google image search bar.
“I know, you’re right,” Harry murmured back. If he wasn’t so busy thinking about how maybe he had blocked out some of the memories, maybe it really was as big a deal as Draco was making it out to be, he would have noticed how close they were.
“They are my patronus,” Lucius informed him, surprised by the familiarity of his tone. This Weasley seemed to have a bit more grace than the others. “As I imagine a dragon is yours.”
Draco smirked. Harry really did seem to know that part of Draco like the back of his hand. “Exactly.” Before Harry could get to it, Draco scooped up the last bit of chocolate cake from their dessert plate.
“I like it,” Harry declared, looking around the room at their work completely oblivious to Draco’s amazement. “Now, if you really want some place cozy it needs carpeting. Should we do that next?”
“Malfoy, are you trying to flirt?” Neville asked once he’d swallowed his mouthful of fries. “Harry, I thought you hated him.”
“It’s pretty fucked up that you wouldn’t care about how you try and belittle people. My friends, too.”
“And I’m cooking,” Harry reminded Draco per their agreement the previous evening. Cooking for Draco was a world away from cooking bland food for the Dursleys because for starters Draco’s palette was wider. He couldn’t handle much spice, which Harry found hilarious, but still took culinary risks in spite of his delicate Caucasian palette.
Harry could hardly believe what he was seeing in the mirror. This man was refined, and intriguing, and somehow it was still him. He turned in the mirror, admiring the brush strokes on the back of his jacket. “It’s… beautiful,” Harry said but felt the word ‘beautiful’ came up short. “It’s, I mean, I would have
Harry put his hand on Draco’s knee under the table. “Okay.” When Lucius visited, one problem was resolved and three more were ripped open, but he was sure Draco didn’t need to hear that right then. Just because Draco looked composed on the outside didn’t mean he wasn’t just as worried as Harry. Draco was just better at hiding it.
The dinner that night was a roast beef adorned in vegetables. Draco happily ate his meal, admiring the seasoning and flavors, without saying a word.
“There is one thing,” Draco said, thinking of the secret of Nyn Anglewise. “We’re already planning it with a host in mind. You’ll have to work with her.”
Theo didn’t even need to pick up the menu to figure out what he was going to order. “It was manageable. I got an order from a man planning his friend’s bachelor party for male enhancement, if that explains it,” he laughed.
Hermione was having a baby! The perfect mix of his two best friend’s genes! It was the baby who would grow up alongside his own.
“I won’t let you down,” Grace blurted out. The fire in Draco’s eyes made her skin crawl with nervousness, and gave her a serious case of verbal vomit.
“I’ve got it, I’ve got it.” Harry waved Draco away from the window and went to open it himself. ‘Daddy’ could be such a priss sometimes. “Brace for impact!”
“Hey,” Harry said, sitting up at the edge of the bed. He winced, bum still sore from the previous evening. “Um, have a good day at work, okay?” Was that what he was supposed to say? The upturn of the corners of Draco’s lips seemed to indicate it well. “I’ll miss you but I’ll be fine.”
Defamation of the highest caliber, regardless of its truth, had caused near-irreparable harm to both the reputations of a Mr. Harry James Potter and a Healer Draco Lucius Malfoy. The perpetrators in question made no statements of denial or innocence, just a proclamation that they had done what they believed to be right.
Still stroking at him furiously, Harry made Draco come only seconds later. The white mess got all over his lace panties and Harry’s chest.
The gardens they’d gone to on their date night were abundant and beautiful, along with the food they’d brought to eat. If it wasn’t for how Theo looked snoozing in the grass, Colin and his full belly would have fallen asleep beside him.
Looking over her shoulder occasionally to check that they were there, the woman in the pink shirt finally got them to a maze of shelves and clothes racks. “And who are you two to her, exactly?” the woman asked the couple.
“Goodnight, then,” Harry said, feeling strange about why they had been so prickly in responding to him.
Harry had gone through a star-reading phase. It really only served him a plate of disappointment when one more possibly magical thing didn’t work, and the stars were really just gas bubbles burning millions of miles away.
Hogwarts had been his home for so long. It was always a place of mysteries and duels but its becoming a warzone still shook Harry to his core. He shook the images of his dead godfathers from his eyes and walked into his room. He didn’t sleep here much on their ‘vacation’ after the first few nights, but he was glad to know it was there. Draco really had thought of everything.
There was a long silence between Ron and Hermione. They exchanged looks that communicated something ineffable to Harry as an outsider of their relationship.
And there it was. Under thin West-Virginian apartment floor the ringing of a phone could be heard below them.
“Sorry about her,” laughed Kennedy as she brought them into the house. The tile floors looked clean enough to eat off, even to Draco. He was sure to get a shot of them for posterity. “Here, let’s go to the living room—this is my father.”
There were rarely times where Draco missed the one-night stands with men who snored, couldn't string two cohesive thoughts together, kicked in their sleep, and had awful breath, but there were times that he missed the selfishness of it all, the rush of leaving at three in the morning to never show up in someone's life again. It was tough to be a narcissist when one was surrounded by people so deserving of attention. At least Harry fed into Draco’s inflated sense of self.
“Not shag,” Sirius told Remus with his bark of a laugh. “Just follow through on a little something we said we’d do again.” Sirius shoved a hand down into his pocket before it closed around what he had been hiding at the prison all along. Prisons didn’t scare Sirius anymore.
To himself and to Harry, Draco swore he would ascend to become worthy of such a thing. It was all making him feel uncharacteristically humble, but perhaps that was how he was meant to feel when his old rival, savior of the world, kissed him for the first time and not the other way around.
Draco smiled to receive such sweet kisses after something so raunchy. Harry really was his sweet boy, wasn’t he? Or a sweet boy, since Draco still wasn’t sure if Harry really wanted to be his. He hoped this was enough to show him, enough to convince him this arrangement would be more than beneficial to them both.
“Of course I smell that. I’m the foodie in this relationship,” Ron reminded her before inhaling deeply. “Mm, there’s chicken—hint of palm sugar, definitely some chili powder—and tofu. Ew. Without the tofu it’d be perfect.”
Just last week he’d caught himself folding Draco’s laundry. He wasn’t even really sure how it happened—one moment he heard Draco’s dryer timer go off and the next everything was folded and he was thinking about doing a load of his socks. His
Harry nodded and unconsciously tipped the roses towards his nose. “These are lovely,” he told Draco. Draco’s little gifts always made him happy.
The piles of teddy bears and butterfly stickers on the wall indicated that she’d lived there as a child. Draco felt horrible for her; he could never sleep in his childhood bed past the age of twenty. Harry wondered if the Barbies were still around.
The room was bigger on the inside as Harry had expected, but it was also packed in wall-to-wall supplies and saplings. There was a small sun and stars rotating over some seedlings marked as flowers in their tiny cups. It was beautiful magic but ultimately impractical, for if Draco really wanted to fill all this space he’d need a—ah.
Grace walked past robe boutiques and restaurants that blended together into one stream of neon signs until she found her way back to the main street of Diagon Alley and picked a damn store to walk into already. Then, she could use the bathroom and clean herself up before she went around searching for women’s’ shelters or something.
Draco laughed in that spot of sunshine. “Quite the modern southern belle, then! Along with your ‘personal’ texts, have you ever sent any intimate photos?”
Should the recipient of the stamp be using polyjuice potion, the stamp ink would turn from green to red.
“Now, Ruth—“ Harry quickly looked to the teleprompter for the name. “’Toby’ here in the audience has a question for you.”
When his mum tried to show him a picture of himself as a baby, Zeke had fled to his room. When the telly advertised new inventions in baby bowls that wouldn’t tip over, Zeke switched the channel to cartoons just to drown out the idea of children.
After them came a group of Gryffindor girls in the year before her to whom she politely waved even though she found them wildly annoying. They were the sort who clung around to the highest branch on the social ladder at school until they eventually wore them down and became a part of the in-crowd themselves.
Draco had spared no expense on his comfort here. The wide, open space had a tall ceiling with a grand chandelier hanging above the California King mattress. The finest linens, the smoothest silks, and the sturdiest headboard a wizard could have adorned Draco’s bed, the covers taupe adorned with white flowers, and plush to the touch. The mattress itself was a marvel, soft as a cloud and warm as a nest.
“What were we supposed to think: Oh, Harry’s just gone on a wee holiday with Draco fucking Malfoy, school bully extraordinaire?” Ron demanded.
“That’s great, Draco,” Harry said, staring at him so intently that he almost missed the walk signal turning on. He thought he would get used to holding Draco’s arm after prolonged contact but he was still all tingly and feeling dangerously swishy.
“Harry,” Draco whispered against his lips. “I want you to go up to my room and put on the clothing I’ve laid on the bed for you. I’ll come to you when I’m ready.”
Pye’s petrified eyes burned in Draco’s direction. He knew what he was saying, that Draco was no war hero just because he was shacking up with one. But the insult burned a little less knowing that the Malfoy lawyers were about to take everything this man owned.
From Harry’s point of view a blurry man was waving the sun in his face but thankfully it was over soon.
“Oh. Next to the rack of strength potions there’s a door, and the ladies’ room is on the right,” Theo explained as he turned the golden ring over and over again in his hands. Maybe if he dropped it in the fire-breathing potion he was making, then perhaps he could forget entirely about his wanting to marry his boyfriend.
Lucius turned away from her and rolled his eyes. When drawn into an argument, Narcissa could be vicious. “Let’s not talk about this now.” He wanted to go back to the part where she had snuggled closer to him in their bed. It was nice knowing his wife still cared for him after all the years and Death Eater scandals.
A nervous laugh left Draco’s mouth, betraying his air of confidence. He’d wanted this and had been in denial, too. He’d dreamed of it and felt guilty for it and everything. “Okay. Okay, let me—“ Draco’s hand moved up to the waistband of Harry’s boxers and pulled down.
“Well,” Ron said with a shiver. “Don’t you think the Death Eater that killed him is probably dead, too?”
“Your skin is so, so soft,” Harry spoke lower this time. He moved his hand down Draco’s chest, touch reverent over old scars. “And now mine is thanks to your brews and instructions. You’re so smart, Draco.”
“Then…” Harry trailed off, trying to separate all the noises in his head into categories, into voices and feelings and Harry’s reactions to them. “Then I’ll tell them, after some more weeks of stalling because I can totally pull that off with them, that I’m seeing Draco Malfoy.”
“Let me see…” Draco began undressing Harry wrists first, undoing the adorable little frills he had around them. Next came the costume itself, and Harry’s underthings, including those beautiful stockings. Everything went in a hamper to the side, to be sorted and washed later. “Looks like you’ll have to go shopping again,” he said of the bra he’d ripped. “Oops.”
She’d climbed her way to one of the jagged stones that the mayor of London said would ‘add to the artistic appeal of the park’ and sat down to try and skip stones. Grace had failed miserably at this, which only made her angrier.
Rather than entertaining yet another ‘are you sure’ conversation with Theo, Draco got up from his lunch table without another word.
Draco looked up from Hermione’s charts. “They’re on Auror business. I assure you, premature contractions do not always equal premature labor. Ron will probably have missed nothing.”
“You’re going to need to get it wetter than that, sweetheart,” Draco taunted him. “It’s going in your arse after all. Show me some proper respect.”
Lucius was wracking his brain for a magical way to do so but couldn’t exactly procure rare charmed mirrors or other such devices stuck in the France Estate.
Pansy looked into her empty bowl and decided that wasn’t acceptable, so she marched back to the kitchen for some more food. “I’m still stuck on that fact that Remus is hot.”
Harry felt himself coming close to the edge even without Draco’s hand on him, content to be fucked into the couch by Draco until he let out a pathetic whine and came, but Draco would never let such a thing happen.
“I wanted to tell you, you know,” Hermione continued as if she hadn’t heard him. “That I’m proud of you for taking the restrictions off of your adoption requirements.”
“I dunno, it’s some shit Pansy came up with,” Draco explained. It was still an absolute trip to have this woman, Harry Potter’s ex-girlfriend and current Dominatrix-en-vogue, in his home. “She wants to help, and I permitted her to so long as you don’t have a problem with her finding out who you are as well.”
“It’s coming! Holy shit! I think—Draco! Harry! Somebody! Get over here! I think my water just broke!”
“These are professionals, Harry. You deserve a night of pampering and quite frankly so do I. Do you have any idea how many boils I biopsied today?” Draco challenged, shivering slightly at the memory. “Come on, it will be fun to have our face masks done together.”
“I’m glad, you look damn good,” Draco responded seriously. “There is nothing wrong with that answer.”
When Remus looked up, he saw the door to their room slowly creaking open. “Remus?” a little voice asked, unsure. “Sirius?”
“No,” she said simply. “Today is salt in an old wound, and I’m not forgiving your stuck-up, petulant father for that. All I’m doing is saying that I get it, okay?”
Grace’s girl would be a princess. Any princess she liked. A princess that read books all day, one that fought off evil, one that combed her hair and obsessed over clothes, any kind she wanted.
From Harry’s seat, he could see Remus’ reflection in the glass window. “I’ll get it!” Harry called, rushing away from ever hearing Lucius say the word ‘licking’ out loud ever again.
“Tell me what you want me to do for you,” Draco requested. Comforting through sex was his favorite method.
The raven-haired servant boy below Draco’s decked-out throne and attire acquiesced without hesitation. “Of course, your highness.”
“Let him go! Now! I am not under any curse, I’m here of my own free will!” Harry roared at Ron, who was now standing in stunned silence. This sure sounded like Harry, but could it really be him saying these things? “Make them let him go!”
“Hey there, sweetheart,” Harry greeted her. From the other side of the car Draco watched reservedly. The girl hadn’t said anything annoying yet, but it was only a matter of time with children.
“I need time to adjust to this,” said Alvaro as he tried to maintain a clear head. Draco could see him trying to be logical, trying to be rational in the face of something so emotionally tumultuous. “But… It doesn’t change the way I feel for you. I hope you know that.”
His cuts were doused in rubbing alcohol and his colds were treated with loving cuddles and chicken noodle soup with twelve boxes tissues surrounding them.
Grace wouldn’t be hearing their shagging; not over Draco’s dead body. That, and the baby would probably grow up to know the moans from their daddies’ room was not the noises of delight from eating a moist chocolate cake.
The window into the room was smeared with blood. The table had toppled over and one of the chairs had snapped in two while the other remained firmly embedded in the brick wall. A crumpled man was still chained to the table, too.
The rest of the night went along with that plan. Ron threatened to ‘punch Draco’s sorry-arse lights out’ if he did anything to Harry and Hermione gave him the evil eye for the evening, even when Draco and Harry seemed to be laughing, talking, and having a good time.
Pansy’s metamorphosis into accepting muggleborns came from that purely scientific standpoint. Sure, she’d been against the idea of making flower chains with muggle populous of the world for most of her life, but she wasn’t doing anything of the sort. Apparently, acceptance didn’t mean going horribly out of your way to not be a dick.
“I’m not living for him!” Harry shook his head. “He didn’t, I dunno, save me or anything as cliché as that. He’s helping me, helping me see why I shouldn’t live for anyone but myself. To pursue my actual desires. I’m living for me now, Ron, and I’m living here.”
“There you go,” Harry murmured and slipped the owl a conjured treat, taking the parchment from where it was bound to its claw before sending it on its way. “Thank you,” he called after, watching it flap its wings and fly off.
She could absolutely just start screaming and nobody could tell her to stop. Grace Burbage was a free woman with a free mouth. It struck her then and there that she had to do it. She had to find some place where she could sit comfortably and howl her brains out.
“I swear to fuck if this bloke you’re meeting is even three seconds older or younger than you I’m never going to let you forget it either,” he vowed to Draco before devolving into little laughs. “You know, I’ve been worried this whole time that this bloke is like fifty, but what if he’s twelve or something?”
They dropped their stack of letters with precision on the oaken bureau beneath the window and promptly eyed down Harry until he gave them treats. Draco was only mildly horrified, as he was with all animals, even his father’s peacocks when he was younger. They could be vicious.
Draco shook his head. “No, I’d call it that,” he admitted. “It sounds insane coming out of your mouth, is all.”
“It seems we have quite the starting point figured out, then,” Draco said with a wicked smile. “All I need is your permission to start.”
Dean ran a hand through his hair like some greaser in a fifties movie. “I dunno, babe. I’ve been in pretty bad trouble with the law, they may lock me up for a long time,” he joked with a big, cheesy grin.
“My sincerest apologies,” Harry said in the most feminine voice he could. It was nice that Ron got how much Harry hated how people treated him differently because of his sexuality. Like he was suddenly expected to be a dress-up doll for girls and a non-threatening sidekick for guys. “So, how’s Rose and Hermione?”
Shaking his head, Harry reached for the night stand in between them to get some more cough drops out of the bag. “Here,” he sighed, plopping two into Draco’s opened hand and making sure their fingers didn’t touch. If Harry got sick just as Draco was getting better, Kingsley would probably have a conniption.
The rest of the bedroom was just as beautiful. Remus and Sirius had gone wild looking through catalogues and stores to find every tastefully-placed accent, and had charmed the drawers in her desk to hold much more than they let on.
“Maybe I’ll go visit sometime soon,” Harry said and this time it wasn’t an empty promise like the last few times had been. Molly Weasley was an inspirational, badass matriarch who he’d always felt he’d let down by not marrying Ginny, but if she felt that way she sure didn’t act it. Molly was always loving to Harry like a part of the family anyway, and he had to stop being so afraid of seeing her. It wasn’t very Gryffindor-like, even if this wasn’t school anymore.
Draco laughed even brighter, hands propping himself back up on his elbows so he could see every little reaction of the very naked Harry Potter to unveiling the cock he supposedly wanted to suck. Honestly there Harry was kissing him and touching him and still Draco found it too good to be true that Harry could even ever fancy him, let alone to this extent.
“I’m Harry,” Harry tired again, giving the camera a nervous little wave. Kingsley liked it; it made him vulnerable enough to be relatable. “Based on the documentary ‘Catfish’, the term catfishing means to lure someone in by pretending to be someone you’re not online. A few months ago we asked all of you to send in your bizarre internet love stories that seem too good to be true, since you’ve never met the person. This show follows your leads with me, my partner Draco, and a crew from MTV to help people meet your online loves for the first time.”
Harry could make out the shapes of figures now, some trucks pulled up with their hatchbacks open and overflowing with bushels of produce. The deep-fryer in question was a big, bubbling vat behind one of the trucks that looked wildly unsafe but probably tasted all the better for it. Rustic authenticity was hardly a motif in the Manor so the change of pace was appreciated.
For a moment the whole world was blurry for Harry, his vision foggy and hazy as his grip loosened on the edge of the tub. Draco holding him up by his hair and hip was the only way to keep him from sinking down into the bath bubbles.
Sirius, luckily, heard Harry’s message loud and clear. “I’ve got to get back home,” he excused himself. “Wife and kid waiting. You know what I’m talking about, Narcissa.”
“Do come up for air sometime, I actually happen to like having Harry around,” Blaise told them. He kept to himself the embarrassing fact that this was the happiest he’d ever seen Draco.
The slap of skin punctuated each movement and filled Harry’s ears. He knew exactly when Draco was close to coming. It was the tension in his thighs, the frantic breathing, and the groans that Harry felt vibrate against his prick.
The crowd had at least been scared off by the pink monstrosity that was the school’s civics teacher so the social damage was minimal, but the damage to Draco and Harry’s already tenuous rivalry was visible.
“Once or twice,” Draco lied. There had been extensive talks, debates, fights, and make-ups. “If you see a future with someone, then marriage isn’t that big of a step.”
Draco’s tongue darted out to meet Harry’s rough tugs, letting out a throaty noise when Harry’s teeth nipped at it.
Even so, Harry’s curiosity got the better of him. He dried his hands off, threw the towel away, and crouched down.
Theo looked like a woodland fairy, which amused Colin immensely enough to keep him twisting flowers in his hair.
Harry was spellbound, not by any work of magic but by Draco’s commandeering of what had actually been one of the best first dates of his life, if it could be called that at all. It sure felt like it with everyone here either looking like close friends or on a date. Did Draco bring dates here, or did he come to this table to eat sweets alone?
“Yeah, Golden Boy, I’m sure I can make a repeat performance,” Grace grinned. Harry was always saying encouraging things like that as if they would make a difference.
Harry stood to maneuver around the table before Draco could properly restrain him. “Rachel,” Harry said gently, putting an arm around her shoulder.
After placing a light wood desk, a laundry bin, and a trashbin all with flicks of his wand, Draco tried to think of what he used most often. The closet was fully stocked, a walk-in with seemingly endless drawers on either side. “Ah,” Draco said when he realized what was missing. He expanded a decorative mirror to hang on the wall adjacent from the bed.
“Knock,” Harry reiterated as a strong blush came to his cheeks. “Knocking is useful. Knocking is universal.”
“Thank you,” Draco sighed, still not really content with his outfit—a black jacket with gold and silver trim along the seams and down the sides of the matching trousers. His tie was at least looking better now. “You look great too, you know.”
“What, ‘fun’? You’re for sure my favorite play partner of all time, I’ll give you that as well,” Draco said. “Harry Potter is plenty fun once you get him in nothing but his knickers.”
“Well,” Draco said as he penned in the date. “In the meantime, let’s see that fetus.” Grabbing his wand, Draco made his way over to his patient to summon an ultrasound machine. “Do you and Ron want a picture this time, too?”
After a couple more minutes of persistent bickering, the two of them realized the camera was still on. Harry gave Draco a Look. Draco gave Harry a Look.
“My father is going to have to live with it,” Draco shrugged as he turned the tables to lead Harry to the dance floor.
“So, I’ll just give you the address,” Harry said, whipping a quill and a piece of paper out of his pocket.
Harry stopped mid-bite into his bread with a realization of his own when the wine came. Fuck, the wedding really was coming up, wasn’t it?
“I really shouldn’t have expected you to say anything different. Your car back in school was at least sixty grand.”
Draco crossed around the table to join his husband in staring at a teenage girl’s midriff. Grace experienced a special brand of awkward that she doubted anyone before her had ever encountered.
Unfortunately, it was time for Harry to leave his ‘beauty’ to go fulfill a biological need. He was hungry, and had been for the past half-hour, but the game had held his attention.
The velvety smooth bag shimmered in the office lights. Ron went with his gut, shoving a hand down the bag and yanking out the first little card he felt. “We’re solving this one,” he informed Harry. “I can feel it.”
“…Anyway, I wouldn’t want to be the hotel staff that had to clean up that mess when it was done. Lord knows what a blacklight would reveal!” The audience laughed, but that was mostly because whoever laughed the loudest got a free shirt.
, Head Auror,” he emphasized. He’d dealt with crazed fans and homicidal ‘avengers’ of all sorts from that media circus. They were not about to hurt his family more than they already had.
Maggie snickered before slinging an arm around her. “Oh, Princess. You’re a real problem-solver. I admire that about you.”
“Yes,” Harry whispered back anyway, figuring it would be rude not to. He let out a squeak when Draco closed his thumb and forefinger over the pink nub, rubbing between his fingertips as Harry squirmed harder than ever before.
“Yes,” Harry hissed. Finally, getting to what he’d been so hoping for: a fucking so hard he forgot about everything in the world outside this Manor. Dinner had been nice, but Harry longed to retreat into what was comfortable and familiar to him now—Draco and his loving arms.
It was fanciful, it held no realistic basis finance-wise, but that little speech of Draco’s was sweet.
“I’m going,” Lucius clarified snootily. “To tell you that I have seen Theodore grow up. He spent a great deal of time at the Manor as a child for obvious reasons. He and Draco grew close, and he always got a mention in letters back home from Hogwarts. I consider Theodore family.” They actually were second cousins twice removed, but Lucius figured mentioning that after his early marriage plans for Draco would be uncouth.
“You have a shit double-standard for yourself! You whine and preach about not judging people but you do it too!”
“Stay here,” Harry snapped at him. They’d interrupted his case study and knocked down a trainee, doubtlessly with magic. “On top of some charges for assault on an officer of the law, somebody here has clearly gone against the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery.”
“I just dropped by to return the bowl we used for last night’s jelly,” Molly told him with a little wave of her hand, strolling over to the kitchen where Olivia was seated. “Oh, hello, sweetheart. How are you warming up to Grimmauld Place?”
A person who would grow to have memories, favorite smells, and hated rivals. Right now they were just an unconscious blob, but the second they came screaming into the world, Grace would create a life.
“Shut up,” Draco muttered against his shoulder before getting on his tip-toes to kiss his cheek. “I’ll be back later, okay?”
Instead of a look of lust this time around, Potter seemed to be giving him the evil eye. That sensitive little poof.
Harry had searched high and low for a gift that could express his love and gratitude to Draco, and he was pretty damn proud of what he’d gotten, but he was still nervous to see Draco’s reaction to it. It was the one thing on his shopping spree that he’d bought with Potter money to keep the purchase totally secret.
Slytherin was a house of confused identity. Founded on purity but with a few caveats for cunning and ambitious folk, it had evolved towards the latter two descriptors in the years gone by. Muggleborn students were in theory to be accepted to the house, though Draco didn’t know what everyone’s blood status was just yet.
Hermione, on the other hand, had no idea what the hell had come over her beloved professor. “Remus, what’s wrong?”
Lucius put on his glasses. He only did so when he was at home and surrounded by his family so that the general public wouldn’t see his aging weakness. Draco would need reading glasses as well when he reached that age.
Granger had insisted the meetup be in a neutral location which he could hardly blame her for, what with the history she had with the Manor, and that meant Draco taking the future Granger-Weasleys out somewhere delicious and most importantly muggle.
They’d taken the day off from work together just to do this, and they had dove in from the moment they woke up. Harry would only suffer one day of this hell.
“I am going to jump off the roof,” Draco announced from the opposite side of the hospital lobby. His white robes were covered in a mysterious purple substance that had both women laughing.
Harry wanted to argue that he owed Draco the world but he could see where he was coming from. It wasn’t healthy to pin all of one’s hopes and dreams of happiness on one person, but Draco just made it so easy to do when he was the world’s greatest sugar Daddy.
“Let’s just say our favorite Nott knows some people who know some people.” Theo and Sirius were strikingly similar in their way of dealing with sadness: drugs and sex. Sirius snuck a kiss in on Remus’ cheek, because this would undoubtedly lead to shagging. “Now, would you like to do the honors?” he asked cordially.
“I love being right,” Pansy sighed adoringly towards herself before returning her attention to Draco. “Okay, so, what was the first meeting like? What about the first time? Come on, give me something, I’m dying here.”
Draco hummed. “Mmm, so.” He uncrossed his legs. “What about that time in the library?” he asked, tongue darting out to wet his lips. “What was that like for you?”
Noises that Harry didn’t even know he was capable of were coming out of him, caught between sobs and cries of passion. “P-please,” he said, voice utterly wrecked.
Warmth blossomed in Draco’s chest to which there was nothing he could compare it with. How could Harry be so sexy while saying an ‘I love you’? Draco grunted and drove his hips harder into him. “I bet I can fuck you right to orgasm, no need to even touch you. You really love cock, don’t you?”
Wow, uh, three years later? I promise I actually had this planned but then lapsed into suddenly hating the story and Fearing writing for it. Paranoia aside I’m glad to bring you the final chapter. Every time I watch Catfish I think of this stupid fic, and everyone whose read it has been really indulgent of me in doing so. Like, objectively, ‘Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter host MTV Catfish’ is the least structurally sound idea I’ve ever had and so many of you still read it. Thanks, everyone. Don’t know where I’d be without you.
Ginny laughed heartily and Harry looked utterly mortified. “I am never,” Harry realized. “Ever going to live that article down.”
Only after a long moment of staring by the gates could Harry conclude that yes, this was a different Manor altogether. The architecture was more modern, and parts were still clearly under construction.
Nobody else in the room knew what the Healer was referring to except for Dudley. Pye and Moore had moved on to discussing details as to Suzy’s enrollment in a wizarding school somewhere far away from the family feud.
“So it’s really great that your father is supportive,” Harry mentioned to fill the dead air time as they filed into Kennedy’s room.
“I can blame you for whatever I want. You made me take three separate trips to the pharmacy! You weren’t satisfied with regular tissues, no, you
“I spent a weekend there with Theo once to help him get over a breakup,” Draco shrugged. “Barcelona was nice during the day but I liked it best at night, in the clubs drinking like fish. I can get a little… carried away when I’m with my friends.”
Sirius stood on his two feet once more, clothes still clinging to him loosely. He was complicit and malleable when high, so he followed Draco’s order before slinking over to the chair next to Hermione’s bed. “You’re no fun, niece. I was going to play fetch with the kids.”
Draco chuckled, recalling that fantasy being a particularly potent one back in Hogwarts. “Down, all of you,” he laughed. “I’m a gentleman; you’re not getting that much out of me.”
No, no, he could feel his kingdom slip away—he couldn’t think of the show when he was having such a fantastic dream!
Draco followed him with his eyes, trying to get inside that head of his. “You’re going to tell me that we’re soulmates and keep unpacking the fucking décor?” he asked, amused.
Draco kicked off his shoes and collapsed onto the couch next to Harry. “Apparently he does. I’m not finding a ‘nice, rich, pureblood man to settle down with’ quickly enough for his taste, so he’s started to take up the hunt for me.” Draco tipped his head back and let out a forlorn groan.
“Someone, somehow found out about us,” Harry started. He could barely start the next sentence before Lucius interrupted.
“That is… a kind offer,” Draco replied, voice measured and calm to fight how frenzied this request made him feel. It brought him closer to the reality of the future of his students, and it brought him closer to Potter. “After dinner, perhaps?”
“Hey, I’m Harry and this is Draco. We’re here from with the crew for MTV’s Catfish.” Harry jarred her from her momentary star-struck paralysis.
It was hilarious enough to make Harry laugh. Draco might actually be the only person around who understood how invasive those questions were, how performative the answers given had to be for your own safety and sanity.
“The fuck,” Draco murmured to himself. Malfoys rarely apologized, and almost never apologized to people outside of the family. It felt sacrilegious to fulfill that wish of Harry’s.
“Hitting people is wrong, except for when Granger hit me in primary school. Insulting people is wrong, except for when Weasley gets jealous and makes jokes about my family. Do I need to remind you of half of the things he said to me before you came out?” Draco was going straight for the jugular with that one.
Draco ignored the sarcasm and decided to take that seriously. “Yes it is. Anyway, he’s going on and on about the price of buying a dittany farm versus selling dittany when the food arrived and he started—I kid you not—putting catsup on everything. Everything, Harry. I watched a grown man put catsup on asparagus.”
Within was a deep, wide room full of fabrics of all colors. Harry stepped forward for a better look and smiled. “You have a vanity dedicated just to sunglasses?”
“Four days for what? Patrolling?” he asked. Sure, there was the sense of importance when two Aurors walked the streets to see the public, but not all of their followers were particularly kind or adoring.
Alex had gotten a new haircut thanks to his foster parents, and it only made Olivia want to chase after him more.
When the saw a professional crew walk down the street focusing on two well-dressed men (Harry was finally looking sharp thanks to Draco) they pounced on them. Draco and Harry hadn’t even taken promotional shots for the show yet and people were treating them like celebrities.
“Yes, pet, you like to have Daddy watching, don’t you? I see, darling, I see that pretty cock hard for me.” Draco undid his trousers and slipped them off as one with his underwear, no more time to waste on his own pleasure. Draco too was hard as a rock and not afraid to show it off. “I see that hole of yours, too, so sweet and little, but don’t worry, I know how to open you up slowly. Trust me—I’m a Healer.”
Draco laughed breathlessly again, nuzzling their foreheads together. “You want to be proper and please your Daddy, hm?”
Draco came as Harry clenched around him, riding out the orgasm with a few more thrusts into the other man. A shudder shook his body before he filled Harry with his come.
That made Harry want it all the more. He shifted, trying to get as close to Draco as possible, practically sticking his chest in his face.
“Oh, Professor Malfoy!” Why did it have to sound so good on his lips? “I could, if you wanted, give you the lowdown on the students I do know are returning. I’ve got some yearbooks in my quarters that should get you acquainted with some.”
Draco checked but the marks seemed light, so he conjured his glass of water for he and Harry to share before curling up alongside him, knowing that he wouldn’t want anything touching his legs or arse after that for they’d be raw at least a few more days. “I’m here,” Draco murmured, crossing their feet together.
Harry answered the door and Hermione had to stop herself from doing a double-take. Harry looked fantastic, and so alive that Hermione almost teared up. He had that nervous look in his eyes but the corner of his lips were up. Was he wearing chapstick?
Ron’s concern made Hermione smile, her hand gently reaching out to stroke his cheek. She explained what happened in hushed tones, keeping things between husband and wife.
Thankfully, Umbridge didn’t hear that one before she spun on her heels and went off to patrol the hallways during lunch. Public displays of affection were strictly forbidden in the hallways, and nothing delighted Dolores more than separating happy young couples. She never had love at that age, so why should they?
“There’s a large possibility that the woman may want to keep the baby after birth. We’re looking for a closed adoption situation, and if they aren’t comfortable with that, then we can’t proceed.” The woman would also have to survive a meeting with the Malfoy family lawyers.
“Shut up,” Alvaro laughed into his shoulder. “The first thing you say to me in person and it’s about my height? You’re such a little bitch. Where’s my ring?” The words were harsh and frank but the tone he said them in was full of joy.
Pansy would drag it out of him eventually, he supposed, but Draco would be lying if he said he hadn’t been avoiding her all day for that very reason. She knew him too well, and Draco feared she might see his Potter-fucking smugness a mile away. It was too specific an emotion for her to miss.
“It’s him,” Draco said confidently, taking out his wand. “Wingardium Leviosa!” Draco lifted the mask from the older man and saw a pink, familiar face staring back at him. “Head Healer Augustus Pye.”
Harry flipped a few pages back in his book. “Hm.” He bit his lip, examining the bones and trying not to think about how many lizards Hogwarts must have led to their doom for this class. “Oh, here, of course!”
Draco turned for a moment to look at Mr. Lark who had thankfully not heard any of Harry’s premonition as he was back to smiling with all of his teeth. He turned back to Harry. “Not particularly. But aren’t you the risk-taker of the two of us?” Why Harry was counseling to back down?
Seeing Harry cry and speak so openly about this had tears pricking the corners of Draco’s eyes. “In my lowest moments,” Draco nodded to admit. “I know what conservatives and purists say about people like us. There’s a class of respectable, sexless gay some can stand but the ones like us, the freaks, we’re abhorrent to them.” Draco wiped away one of Harry’s tears. “But they’re wrong. They don’t know love like I know it when I’m with you, and it’s made me a better and stronger man.”
“Yes,” Harry replied, pushing the empty glass forward to alert the bartender. Draco looked surprised before, and the surprise only deepened now. Good. That was always part of their dance, to keep each other guessing. They hadn’t spoken like this since they were teenagers, and Harry was out of practice but still ready to spar with words as they always had. “If you’re such a man of your word then you will surely uphold your offer for bottomless drinks.”
That was curious. Considering Draco was already in love with Harry when he took it, what could a love potion really do to them? “Does it feel… Different? From usual.”
A distressed groan escaped Harry. “How did they even find out?” he asked, looking around the room. Only the people in that room knew the address, and suddenly so did the whole world. Fuck, this was a nightmare.
“Yes, I am very Sirius-ly, thank you for noticing,” he boasted loudly and proudly. Sirius never passed up an opportunity to crack a joke about his ridiculous pureblood name.
Draco undid Harry’s top button on his trousers and navigated the zipper down as well, releasing his legs from the thick and expensive fabric. All that was left was a set of pink knickers just barely holding Harry’s cock in against the lace. Draco’s eyes went wide. “The whole time, you had those on?”
The tremors had begun as little tickles around the five month mark, but now it felt as if someone was flicking Grace from inside her. That quick but distinct twitch caught both Harry and Draco’s attention.
“Fake, shmake,” Pansy waved off as if that made any sense. “It has to be convincing, doesn’t it? Come on, let’s go downstairs. I know exactly how I want the rooms set up now that I know it’s here.”
“I don’t doubt their skills,” Draco answered diplomatically. “I’m sure we’ll have a name and someone to sue very soon.” But it would come from the trap they laid in the Dungeon. “So, father, would you permit I give Harry a tour of this estate? I want to show him the gardens and the peacocks after dinner.”
would be torture,” Harry countered, rolling his eyes and remembering Draco’s ‘fun at parties’ joke. “Come on, where are we doing this?”
“A ‘thing you did’ being vanquishing the most powerful force of dark magic that ever lived,” Draco reminded him, a bit incredulous that Potter could be so nonchalant about it. “Witches across the globe must’ve been eager to offer their thanks.” Or at least something along the lines of the inverse of the infamy Draco lived in.
Ginny dropped to search their pockets and found shrunken cameras and film aplenty. “You really thought you could expose us all, huh? And for what? Didn’t your mummy ever teach you to leave war heroes alone?”
“No! Gallivant with who you want, but only build our house with someone you intend to marry, son! How long have you and this boy even been together?”
“Yeah, I guess,” she shrugged. It wasn’t as if she was a deity of morality, but that was crossing a line.
“Coming!” they heard from behind the grand front door. With the turning of some locks inside the door opened to reveal Luna Lovegood, long blonde hair tied back in a ponytail that fell over her purple jumper. “Harry!” she recognized immediately. “It’s so good to see you, and you’ve brought Draco. It’s been too long.” She didn’t sound judgmental when saying Draco’s name but was a little hesitant.
Next came Draco’s belt, undone in a flash with the level of skill Harry had come to in disrobing Draco after all this practice. Two months and fourteen days together—and each second of them had been complete bliss aside from their outing.
He would use magic to tie intricate rope knots around the bed post before Vanishing Harry’s clothes. Draco marveled quietly at the level of trust Harry had with him, rendering himself entirely incapable of defending himself for a full sixty seconds.
Harry hoped that he would be grown up by twenty-six, but the gesture wasn’t lost on him. “This must be Olivia,” Harry said, bending over to outstretch his hand for her to shake. “So glad you could make it.”
Harry nodded again, still maintaining a mock-seriousness. “Sounds about right, yes. Just like how your iguana’s gnarled feet tell me that you’re going to take it all the way in, too.”
“Of course.” Draco gave Harry’s side a squeeze. “I promise we’ll get to that after the Ball. For now, I have to get this prick I know who killed some bald guy in robes that everyone hated so much to the Ministry.”
beds, and handing that key to us. As far as I’m concerned, it is within your physical power unless you have a mental block on how to do your damn job.”
“Aerin likes to experiment with new flavor palettes. I think he’ll appreciate the compliment,” Harry encouraged. “It was kind of you to say.”
Harry, a naturally fast leaner, let Draco do whatever the hell he wanted with the flat. He waited patiently through Draco’s Feng Shui phase when he was up into the odd hours of the night adjusting chi flow and he allowed Draco to swap out the expensive art on the walls at least once a month. Draco had a strange sort of passion for making the world around him beautiful that Harry could quietly appreciate even if it was in interior design.
With Draco sitting cross-legged on his bed—sheets of green, of course, his room was a more grown-up and Victorian version of the Slytherin commonroom—he used his wand to turn the fairy lights down to a low-light that would keep Draco awake without hurting his eyes.
“Hmf?” Draco queried from his place in bed still, arms reaching out seeking the heat that had left him so quickly.
“What they mean to say,” Raina translated through gritted teeth. “Is that we have the fewest students of any house. Slytherin hasn’t won a house cup in eleven years. How are we supposed to win out over the others?”
Well, if it helped, nothing of Harry’s felt clean. “I’m leaving,” he said weakly. “I need to be alone right now. And no—I’m not going to tell anyone what happened here.” Why did Harry feel so guilty? Why was guilt a similar sensation to needing to throw up?
The second they walked in, a stuffed owl mounted on the wall was there to greet them with its beak open in a silent screech. There were plenty of animals fallen victim to taxidermy around the lobby, but that owl in particular gave Draco the creeps. He turned away from it with a shudder to see the crew escorting Henry to his hotel room while Harry was grabbing the key for theirs at the front desk.
Harry remembered this story all too well. Mad-Eye Moody had told him it once during a long day at Grimmauld Place.
Harry had certainly acquiesced to Draco’s fantasies before in non-sexual ways, too, and this one was sweet enough to have Draco sort of excited about the idea. He was going to pamper his Harry, and give him the very best of everything.
“It was cool, but it was all about The Doctor! He’s not supposed to be the important one in the series, the humans are. The normal humans.”
Harry didn’t want to quit this, to quit on himself. Everyone had to be bad at something before they mastered it, right? Well, Harry took to magic like a Giant Squid to water and in the process some other life skills has been left behind, especially ones outside of performing ‘male’, which he barely knew how to do either.
Sirius turned to Hermione kindly and twiddled his thumbs as if that would somehow assure the expectant mother that he was still himself. “I was raised by Pureblood parents, Hermione. Everything is wrong with me.”
“’Safe’? They wouldn’t risk leaving the France Estate and throwing away years of good behavior over this,” Draco said firmly. He didn’t like what Ron was implying but could hardly blame him for being worried for Harry’s safety. “Harry and I will be just fine, thank you.”
Right in front of Harry he started to strip, letting his shirt fall to the ground in a mess the hotel maids would have to clean in the morning. Harry’s mouth was as dry as the Sahara. “What—What are you doing?”
Draco raised his drink too, finishing most of it and passing off the remains for Harry to kill. “Alright, let’s see what you all got to embarrass me this year,” Draco assented to continuing on with presents.
“I’ve done it!” Finally, Remus had tied his shoes. The knots were childishly large and loose, but he’d done it. “I’m a genius. I should go to muggle university.”
“What?” Snape hadn’t been expecting that one. Draco was his godson, for fuck’s sake. It was actually impossible for him to be homophobic.
That was the very definition of sap, according to Draco. “I never took you to be one of those guys who’s obsessed with love. True Love and all that.”
Oh, so Draco was fully verbally combative in the morning, too. Harry was doing his best against an absolute master here. He looked down at the French toast and realized Draco was a master in many ways, many ways indeed.
Lucius’ smile after that was positively sinister. “You’re out of my son’s league,” he informed Harry plainly. “You’re most likely a rebellious trick he’s playing on me because the AIDS center he volunteers at gave him the night off after I…
A small crowd had formed around the Chemistry door to witness what they hoped would be the next school throw-down. That would make two guy-on-guy fights in one week after Zacharias Smith had decked a ninth year who called him a coward.
“You don’t have to thank me,” Draco reminded him for what had to be the millionth time. “You’re a darling and deserve every bit of it. Now—“ he sat on the edge of the bed to start reading the book aloud. “—let’s start.”
“Sorry,” Harry said again lamely. “You’re right. This is our job and I’m letting my emotions get in the way of it.”
Teddy was born of Nymphadora and a muggle man who she never chose to reveal. Her long-unrequited love for the gay Remus Lupin was a persistent tragedy in Nymphadora’s life, just like being called her first name was. But Andromeda stepped up after her death, took in Teddy with a promise to raise him as her daughter would have wanted.
“This is just like the movies,” Ruth whispered, face pressed up against the glass of the network car.
In this soft candlelight Draco saw the petals approach a massive tub, bubbling and steaming still. In front of that was a fold-out massage slab, one where the person could lie face-down and have someone work on their back. “Both are charmed to keep warm,” Harry informed Draco, searching his features for a reaction.
That talk would have to come later, though. It seemed Monica was being tended to by a group of Slytherin girls at the end of the table, offered napkins for her tears as they sat her down. Teddy, Monica, Angela, and Brynn. The future of House Slytherin.
“I hate you,” Draco decided. This was supposed to be a relaxing evening of sorting and snuggling. Harry and his stupid fucking moral compass had ruined it all, and ruined any future brunches with Narcissa and Lucius.
Draco was indeed stalling hair and makeup—but not because they couldn’t get his coloring right. Okay, that was part of it—those incompetent hacks!—but that wasn’t the whole reason. Draco was buying Harry time.
“And damn proud of it,” replied Draco, holding close the man for whom he would do anything. They were going to get through this, and they were getting through it together.
“Draco Malfoy likes control,” Harry said, pretending to be surprised. “I really ought to be taking notes here lest I forget that one.”
Still, they were high enough to make him reach for a quill and parchment, shaking his head at himself all the while. Was he really doing this? Was he really putting himself out there to be hurt like this on his own free will? Could there be anything more foolish, any pursuit more doomed to fail than his?
“It couldn’t be him,” Lorraine insisted. “He doesn’t have the money and I haven’t heard the phone ring down there before.”
“Please get back to us soon,” Harry pressed on, the spark of hope in the pit of his stomach blazing brighter. “Text me whenever you can.”
“Of course, Mr. Potter. I will inform your server of your selection and return to my place at the door. Please, enjoy.”
Privately, Draco called it ‘sort of wonderful’, because for the first time it seemed as if in spite of their clashing personalities, Harry and he could actually get along.
Draco twirled the wine in the glass like he saw his father do with his fancy drinks before taking a sip. “Mmm, floral.”
“Britain’s Next Top Model,” he remembered out loud as he put the files and photos of perspective mothers back into their designated place on the kitchen counter.
“And watching this muggle ‘video’ of your progress will show me…?” Lucius questioned, droll as ever.
Harry’s breathing was shallow to watch his two fingers disappear inside of Draco over and over, each time pushing wider and deeper to work him open. Draco had begun to circle his hips, groaning softly with each time they came around to press down on Harry’s digits.
Being the gossip addict that she was, Grace hadn’t missed a beat in figuring out that this was the potion shop owned by the Nott heir. “Actually,” Grace said carefully, tucking her uncombed hair behind her ears. It didn’t really work since palms were clammy and she still hadn’t quite caught her breath yet. “There is something I was looking for.”
“Not everyone trusts the police—and for good reason. Plus, they probably would have been sexist about the whole thing in thinking that women can’t be predators or making light of the situation.”
That last moan caught Draco deep in his gut, a burst of warmth and white-hot light leading him forward. “Oh,” Draco gasped, rhythm falling to disorganized thrusts as deeply as he could manage. “
Between moans and growls of frustration, Draco found some time to speak. “You mean,” he panted. “I’m not pretty all the time? I ought to spank you for that one.”
Draco sighed. Lucius never could bring himself to be specific about this, could he? “He and I are together,” Draco answered succinctly. That was the sort of clarity his poor, confused father needed.
Harry rolled his eyes in return. “Snarky as ever to cover up the vulnerability. Yeah, some things don’t change.”
At once, the Malfoy’s heads snapped around. It left Harry looking confused and lost. “Burbage?” Lucius whispered, though he didn’t want to hear confirmation at all. This was a nightmare. The girl would sue, and then she would kill them all.
“Goodnight, then,” Blaise said when he returned to the bedroom with a bag of chips for himself and a health bar for Ginny.
Dudley Dursley wasn’t even supposed to know about wizards, let alone be prowling around wizarding parts of town.
Harry was now doing his best to not look at Draco, head turned bashfully away. That was really presumptuous, wasn’t it? Dammit. “Sorry,” he said quickly.
In his dressing room Draco paused in his trying on of clothes, hands coming to rest over his heart. “Spiffing, eh?” Draco grinned. “Well, I can hardly wait to see it.” He finished buttoning his jacket. “Be sure to put on the shoes and socks, too, and then I’ll show you what I’ve picked out.”
Agh, I’m 17! What the hell? Growing up is ridiculous. I am now officially driving places, and I got cast in a music video. TW for slurs and talk of menstruation.  Anyway, this one’s for eloyellow! You’ve left such touching reviews but I haven’t got a chance to reply since you’re a guest. You’re lovely.
“So needy,” Draco teased as he worked his hips. “But I suppose you have done everything I’ve asked. You may come after I do—only if you thank me for my mercy.”
“Ah, ah--!” Harry’s hands scrambled to clutch red velvet and brace himself against the thrusts Draco was giving him,
Draco let his eyes flutter shut so that Harry could kiss them, too. “You’re beautiful,” Harry said against his skin.
“Please, Harry, call me Narcissa,” she insisted, outstretching her hand so that Harry could take it. “Lucius is the way he is because he thinks only of Draco’s safety. I will speak with him after owling the lawyers.”
Harry shook his head. “None yet. They’ll come,” he murmured. “But, until then… I’m really happy you have this job, and proud of you for how many people you’ve helped—saved even. I’ll be here for you when you get back, Daddy.”
Harry nodded against Draco’s knee, eyes wide behind his thick-rim glasses. “Only ever from you,” he whispered. “No one can make me feel like you do.”
“I know!” Hermione stopped him. She got the picture; it was tough to be gay. “But what does that have to do with you giving in to Lucius?”
Harry was surprised by the interruption. Draco knew he was funny, so what did it matter? “Yeah,” Harry treaded lightly before turning back to the computer screen and scrolling through more emails. “I think you’re funny. You think you’re funny, too.”
“How did you…?” Ron asked before running to the light switch and flicking it on. He wished he hadn’t.
“Hermione,” Draco lied quickly. Er, what exactly would constitute Harry writing a letter and Hermione needing assistance? If anything, Draco probably needed assistance from her. “Her baby!” Ah, yes, that was it. “Not the one she’s pregnant with. The other one. Rose.”
, of all people in the world. He inspected Harry’s outfit—clearly set up by Draco—and recalled what Harry had said in their first stumbling into each other in this hall: that he had a different outfit for meeting the parents. So, this was that outfit. At least the boy cared how he looked, unlike that mess of a mop he’d had back in school.
With a glare, Draco made his point clearer. “Fine, that was a bad example. What I mean is that I’d find a way to be with the man I loved. I’d find a way and it’s hard for me to believe that all of the people we’ve talked to haven’t found a way on their own.”
Draco nodded finally in recognition. “Right. Didn’t recognize you out of your intern scrubs I suppose…”
“It’s a little gimmicky, I know,” Draco prefaced. “But you won’t find anywhere better for your sweet tooth. The chefs here are world-class, and the location a well-kept secret amongst the London muggle elite. I ordered us one of everything so we can sample their whole menu and see what you like best.”
“It depends on who caught you. Students laughed and ran, McGonagall gave a stern talk and a warning the first time and a trip to the office the second time, Dumbledore gave you the sex talk—which was emotionally scarring enough to make sure he never found you again—and Snape just sort of looked at me disappointedly.”
Draco kept his voice hushed. The crew was trying to get dramatic shots and Draco and Harry didn’t want to distract them. “I didn’t screw both of them—don’t look so scandalized. There was a gay one and a straight one and Pansy had the straight one in her grasp from the moment he looked at her. She’s an evil temptress,” Draco remarked fondly.
Molly shifted uncomfortably, trying her best not to look at Olivia. “I need to ask you something about your—ah—your shampoo.”
“Oh, quit looking so disappointed,” Draco chided as they made their way back to the hotel. “He had gauge earrings; I helped you dodge a bullet.”
Harry didn’t have to ask which email Draco was referring to. The both of them through either their queer connection or their similar senses of humor had spotted the subject line.
“Don’t,” stormed Pye. “You raise your voice at me, Malfoy. I’ve no time for your sass and back-talk. You listen to me, and listen well.”
He’d zipped through St. Mungo’s with no sign of Grace and gotten a patronus message from Harry saying she wasn’t at Hogwarts. Draco was already desperate when he entered the women’s soup kitchen.
Remus was out tutoring students and Olivia was visiting with Alex, so Sirius had invited his godson over to give him some long-overdue attention and love. “I always knew you’d quit being an Auror someday.”
Remus tried to think of a time other than the making of the Marauders Map where Padfoot exercised cartography and failed to find any memories. “Sure. Anyway, in fourth year he sent us on a buried treasure hunt after having stolen some of our favorite things,” he went on. “He kidnapped my Fitzgerald books, James’ glasses, and Wormtail’s shoe. It was cruel that way, since he only had one shoe to run around in.”
There was another one, wasn’t there? One who liked dragons? It was hard keeping track of all the redhead spawn around Hogwarts.
Harry put an experimental foot in the water and sighed aloud at how perfectly warm it was. He stepped in, Draco following him, and sank all the way down to below his nose in the water, enjoying the heat wrapped around him like a blanket and the scents of lavender and rose wafting up his nose.
“Watch it, bitch,” a burly man said when she bumped into him. He had a pack of men around him, and seemed to be the alpha male.
“Not for me, obviously! For you, Harry. There’s one just a few blocks away called the ‘Velvet Lounge’ that serves wizards and muggles. Drinks, music, blokes—I think they even have drag shows,” Ron offered. It was hard to gauge what kind of nightlife activities might interest Harry when nothing seemed to interest him anymore, so he was throwing out as many ideas as he could.
But Grace, as she usually did, miscalculated. The world may have been without consequence in that moment, but someone had heard her scream.
“Yes, Daddy,” Harry responded quickly, nothing sounding better. He got on his side and felt Draco’s flat chest press against his back, their legs tangling together atop the sheets with both still too warm from sex to consider going underneath them yet.
Harry laughed more openly this time. “Sometimes I am, yeah, but that has nothing to do with dating. I wouldn’t want to be with someone who just wants me for… I dunno. A title, a status, a thing I did when I was eighteen.”
Draco really had been meaning to get the Manor’s fruit trees up and running again in the back but they proved finicky no matter what growth potion he poured on them. For now he got his oranges from a Marlborough Farmer’s Market not too far from the Manor. Wiltshire was of quiet, green country, with lots of space in between neighbors and magic wards to keep the muggles from discovering the Manor existed in the first place.
“Good,” Harry said, chin held high just like Draco had shown him. Being good was fun, but being bad could be just as entertaining with Draco, albeit usually leaving a handprint below his waist.
“So,” he said, leading her out of the house and locking the door behind himself. Lucius’ spells had kept the press off of their front lawn much more effectively than Draco cared to admit, but it was refreshing to step outside without hundreds of cameras flashing and rude questions being thrown at him. “Enjoying the neighborhood?”
Pausing before the door Draco took a moment to fidget with the Malfoy signet ring. He took a breath and raised a fist.
“Hey,” he murmured, lips pressed to Draco’s chin covered in platinum stubble. It was rare that Harry got to see him so disheveled. After a night of copious shagging, though, Draco just couldn’t be arsed to get up and shave quite yet. “What’s on your mind?”
“Calm down, Blaise. Just because you’re six months older than me doesn’t mean I’m coming after you.”
Harry cracked a little smile. “You know, I happen to like being a freak with you,” he reminded him. “I don’t care how many people call us depraved or sick for it.” He drew Draco into a hug that was immediately accepted tightly. “You’re my partner, my equal, and you’re also my Daddy.”
“Arse up, legs wide,” Draco commanded, giving Harry only a moment to adjust before bringing back the wrath of his hand.
Kennedy nodded. “It’s almost exactly like mine. We’re always sending each other funny videos. Not like ‘cat making weird noises’ funny, but ‘two punk boys getting their lips rings caught while making out’ funny.”
They reached the dining room in record time based on Draco’s nerves alone. “Maybe they thought we were coming later?” Harry tried. When Harry was upset it could be disastrous, but Draco being anxious was on an apocalyptic level.
“As opposed to the non-representative ones?” Draco asked again in the same playful tone Ruth had used.
One of the cameramen gave Harry the signal to move into the Q&A portion of the interview. Each Catfish hopeful got some time to chat with Harry and Draco before turning them to the real challenge—the audience.
“That’s the thing,” Harry muttered. He wanted some privacy, and his doctor was clearly unaware of such a need.
Draco and Harry stepped closer to Alvaro in order to flank him with support and so Draco could get a better camera angle.
Ruth, unsurprisingly, screamed. “Oh my gosh!” she said over and over again. “Oh my gosh, thank you!”
Of course Theo wanted to know how it ended, Colin thought. It always seemed to satisfy his boyfriend that Colin had never met anyone who fit just right with him like Theo did. “He wound up getting a job in Cardiff and we lost touch. Still was some great sex, though. Do you really wish I was your first?”
He smiled around his secret, the identity of his lover revealed but not what was between them. It excited him all the more, and when Ron and Hermione left Harry could hardly wait for Draco to get back.
The two lay in silence, bodies slick with sweat beginning to dry. Draco held Harry tight, and in return Harry held on like a drowning man to a raft.
Next to the struggling boy on his chair, Minerva shifted on her feet with a sense of patience. She’d been stuck between Ravenclaw and Gryffindor for a solid five minutes when she was sorted and her hair was still red.
Draco nodded. He usually loved it when Harry was right, mostly because it involved a gratifying ending, but this time was bitter in his mouth.
Yet, on the other side of the room in a case where Theo kept his spare contacts was the heavy golden ring that he hadn’t done a blessed thing with. Colin didn’t know it was there, and Theo wondered if it should stay that way.
“I—I sent you pictures of myself!” she ranted on, her eyes wide with anger. Ruth looked likely to pounce on him at any moment and rip that tacky fedora to shreds, but Harry remembered how Kingsley had mentioned physical fights were inadvisable.
“Are you here to see Kennedy?” she asked. Her hands were covered in pink chalk residue. “My name is Mary May Rogers and this is my uncle’s house. Kennedy’s my cousin.”
“Maybe,” Harry said in a way that really meant ‘doubtfully’. “But I think I’d be friends with Ron and Hermione no matter what house we were all put in. Maybe we could have been friends, though, instead of rivals. Would you still… want that?” Harry swallowed back his nerves. “You apologized to me a long time ago at the Post-War Trials, and I forgave you then, especially after all your mother did for me. I forgive you still, and I think, for the sake of the students—“
“That’s not part of the deal,” Theo murmured, trying to keep in mind the point of this meeting in the first place. “I’m here, now quit fucking around. Where is Benjy Fenwick’s skull?”
When Randy had sufficiently fixed whatever kept falling over inside his apartment, he appeared in the doorway looking as white as a sheet.
“Gerda. Food,” Lucius demanded, not seeing the terror in her big brown eyes when she looked at the feisty peahen.
Well, that was satisfying. Draco got a grin out of Harry actually listening to him for the first time and from the way Harry’s breathing seemed to have evened out, he really was listening.
Narrowing his eyes, Lucius looked to his cousin-in-law. “Isn’t your husband supposed to be the professor here?”
“Not yet.” Though Draco was breaking down himself, he would force himself to last to the last possible second, the last possible moment for Harry. “Just a bit longer…”
Victoire went through all the French she knew before deciding for all of them. “Monsieur,” she declared as she threw her hands up in the air. It was the sort of idea that also required physical exclamation.
“Good boy.” Draco used crop on his thighs next, getting even louder cries of shock from the bound man. “You know you deserve it?”
Draco chuckled before successfully slipping the finger back in. This time, Harry let out a low groan. “I usually don’t do virgins.”
If Draco were feeling more himself he would have chastised Harry for making a promise that he wasn’t sure they could keep. The ‘we’ factor in that sentence made Draco uncomfortably responsible.
Draco grabbed Harry’s jaw and planted a kiss on his lips. Harry probably should have expected it, but he was too often too naïve. But if that really was what Draco needed from him…
Olivia ran down the stairs so fast she could have been gliding. Sirius had once tried to slide down the bannister to some unfortunate results, but she was young and lithe.
Cabinets flew open, a shallow glass pie dish landing gracefully in front of Draco. He floated two eggs over it, cracking them precisely down the center. Next came milk and sugar, a whisk flying over to start whipping the substances together.
Harry had never thought of it like that. If he wanked off thinking about Malfoy and then went back to hating him, did it really not hurt Draco?
“Did you not hear me? We have an agreement. She does the same thing with whoever she wants. And you know what, if we want to talk about who was the shittier boyfriend to Ginny, I think the closet case should at least get a mention.”
He trusted the anonymity of the small firm on the corner of Cauldron Street, spilling his secret to someone he had neither seen nor heard of before. Zeke couldn’t very well go to his family lawyers without his mother finding out, and there was even a risk level with this.
Closing his eyes, Harry let his hips cant upwards so that he could get the best of Draco’s warm skin on his and the pressure of his thumb making torturous laps around Harry’s prickhead.
Draco’s tongue teased the inside of Harry Potter as no one had ever done before. He breathed in through his nose, mouth latched to Harry’s hole and sucking around him while his own cock throbbed almost painfully. It seemed this would be a test of his stamina, as well.
he loathes me,” Harry continued to snark as he sauntered up to the embarrassed blonde. “If he hated me, he’d treat me like trash and purposefully give me lower grades. Oh, wait.”
A shiver took over Draco’ body. Harry’s tongue, velvety soft, was an absolute blessing bestowed upon him. It was true, then, everything Harry said about wanting Draco, wanting him to be his Daddy—and that was overwhelming. The only thing that Draco could think to do to properly express his gratitude was moan from his raw, well-fucked throat.
“Uh.” Pansy Parkinson did not meet mothers, or fathers, or siblings, or household pets. Ever. At least she hadn’t thus far, considering she’d slept with enough people to keep her occupied with sex rather than family gatherings.
Draco took a breath. He had to be brave, be brave for Harry. “I met someone,” Draco led with. “Or really, reconnected with someone. He’s very important in my life right now, and he has been helping me see my vision for the Manor come true.”
It dawned upon Theo that he had never been inside a cathedral before. Sundays in the Nott family hadn’t included a trip to commune with higher powers.
“Draco.” Harry yanked him away with the grip on his arm so they weren’t facing the man behind the counter. He lowered his voice down to barely a whisper, too. “Do you want to get murdered in your sleep by some pop-culture-hating Delaware hillbilly tonight?”
While a nervous teenage boy sat down uncomfortably on her plastic-covered sofa, Tiffany frantically rushed to the sink to get her hair back to a semi-normal state of being. “Look, just owl me before you do anything.”
“No, I’m not,” Harry said, voice steadier than it had been before for all the effort he put forth. “Ask me again in two hours if you don’t believe me.”
Gathering his sleeping robe around himself over the shirt and long pants Draco made his way down the grand staircase like a lady holding her skirts. Draco had always loved that about wizards getting to wear robes, even though he did find the time to appreciate a good muggle suit, like he had last night. Potter cleaned up damn well—oh, wait, yes, they were using first names now.
Harry shifted on the bench uncomfortably. After his testimony in court that Narcissa had been essential to winning the war the Malfoys were never chased down by an angry mob, but it was no secret people still held anger and suspicion for Draco’s parents and of course, Draco himself.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Remus and Sirius have it right. We should get the kids after they know how to manage their own bodily functions.”
“I’m so proud of you, baby. I love you so much, do you know that? I love you like I love baths. Merlin, I love baths. Who was the first person to not jump in a lake to bathe, but instead filled up a warm tub? I’d like to give that person a medal. The Bath Medal.”
He held onto this love, these three words he wished to say, and tucked them away in his heart for another time. For now Harry didn’t need to say anything at all, didn’t need to know if Draco felt the same way back. For now Harry could just be in love and cherish every second of it, and cherish all they’d built together.
Draco and Harry shook her hand before entering the home. It made sense to have a roommate not only for the extra cash but for company. Draco never had a sibling so he imagined what fun it would be to live with someone like Pansy all the time—though there would be ups and downs—and Harry knew what it was like to live with Dudley so he shied from the idea.
“Yes, it is, you complete arse,” Harry chuckled, still not opening his eyes or moving away from Draco.
Harry continued to deepthroat Draco with an unmatched dedication, gagging and having to slide back on occasion but otherwise taking it like a champion while Draco moaned something fierce.
A sad loo came over Ginny’s face when she realized Blaise had actually been listening to her the whole time. It wasn’t that that was rare, it just usually took two times to get it into his skull. “Let’s just eat, alright?”
“Next time just try scratching up his car,” Lucius sighed in a slight exhaustion. “Then there’s no proof it was you, but now there are fingerprints on his old phone...”
“Maybe we could make it two?” Harry asked, slipping an arm around Draco’s waist and noting with some satisfaction how his smile had grown.
He launched himself on top of Harry, sending the pen and paper tumbling off of the bed while his hands grasped blindly at Harry’s waist. Draco held him down and held him close, dizzy from how passionately Harry had reciprocated the kiss in the first place.
A rosebud blossomed before him in the Malfoy Manor gardens, and shyly tucked itself away when Harry moved on to the next one. In a sort of peaceful awe, Harry was reminded of just how much he loved magic.
Harry followed her to another room, this one with black leather covering the walls and floor, a few leather couches to the side sat atop cages and a massive stage up against the wall where Harry recognized as a Leather ‘X’ like the one he’d been tied to in the ballroom of the Manor. A warm feeling stirred in his gut at the memory, like Draco was there pushing up his skirt again. He had to admit he was a little interested in the cages lining the walls, too.
Draco jumped on the opportunity. “Are you hurt?” he asked quickly. “I’m a Healer. Are you dizzy? Are you faint?”
“Yeah,” Pansy and Blaise answered quickly, standing on their wobbly feet to pad their way over to the fireplace.
Replaying the text of the ad a few more times in his head did nothing to ease Draco’s mind. He Vanished away the magazine with a resigned huff, reserving this dilemma for Future Draco.
“Funny you’d mention ‘fit’,” Draco remarked with a smirk on his lips. The finger that was breezing over Harry’s skin pressed deep into the center of his warmth, sliding in all the way up to his knuckle. “Because that’s just what I’m about to do.”
Tears gathered at the corners of Harry’s eyes not out of melancholy but sheer embarrassment. Draco, unjudging, was giving him everything he had ever wanted. “Thank you, Daddy,” Harry said, blinking back the wetness.
Zeke made yet another fatal error in the conversation that he’d been failing at from the start. “’Daddies’? Like, two of them…?”
Lyall and Hope Lupin had left a trail of disinfectant and nervous glances wherever they’d gone. Even before Remus was bitten they triple-checked to make sure he had friends in elementary school that weren’t going to abuse him.
“Nothing. It’s—um, I’ve got to go, okay?” He stood. “Everything’s fine, don’t look so goddamn concerned.”
This one is for misty-girl on tumblr who is podficcing this! Her voice is so relaxing and wonderful—I’m seriously flattered and will update y’all on when it’s ready!
The phone number’s registration was hidden by the phone company and according to the woman Draco had verbally berated on their customer service line, ‘they couldn’t just go around handing out names to people with MTV shows’.
“Remember, you may be my kept man but you’re living for you and only you. Put yourself first today. Goodbye, darling.” Draco gave Harry one last peck on the mouth before turning and heading for the door feeling like he could take on a giant today. Harry made him feel strong, and important, and wanted—and after that little pre-work pep talk Harry had Draco feeling invincible.
“Oh, quit looking at me like that! I’m not languishing over it like your fans do. Believe me, if I had liked men back in school I would have at least gotten in on some of the insanity Draco was a part of. You really missed out with all of that brooding instead of handjobs business.”
With a little sigh Draco’s eyelids fluttered shut, nuzzling into the warmth of Harry’s hand. Harry always ran warm and Draco always ran cold, and even if it led to bickering about Draco’s frozen feet under the covers Draco loved to steal Harry’s warmth. “You could always make up for it by telling me now,” he spoke softly.
“Would you like to observe a class? Ms. Lane is working with counting today. There are various nuances that new students—since we start school in August—have to get used to. There is often a little separation anxiety among those students who haven’t left their parent’s side before,” she offered before standing and leading them into the next room that had a theme of clouds, balloons, birds, and all things high-in-the-sky on the walls. The pillows were even shaped like clouds.
With a glint in her eye, Pansy shrugged. “Not sure. What bar do you want to scandalize tonight, Red?” That nickname wasn’t even close to Princess in accuracy, only playing off of Maggie’s mess of vibrant curls, but Pansy was determined to make it happen.
Her voice felt like another spike being driven into Harry’s aching head. Harry’s gut told him that Ruth would be disappointed no matter what happened the next day. Chris lied to her, and there was no way for sure to say if he would even show up to the meeting Harry had scheduled over text.
Only his ‘brother’ knew who the mystery man online had turned out to be, while Pansy, Blaise, Greg, and Vince were in the dark. Draco didn’t have the time or the patience to explain what was going on to them and honestly, Theo was the least judgmental of Draco’s inner circle.
“Nope. I think I want to spend more time working on classes. Do you know how hard it is to get a job without any skills? It’s like, ridiculous,” she told him seriously since it made her feel grown-up and mature. Her week-long search had been depressing as a twelve year-old who had no bills to pay or children to support.
“Double-prat,” Harry countered sleepily. It was the last thing he would smile about before falling asleep.
Harry’s limbs were shaking, his legs wobbling even worse because of the heels. “Yes,” he answered, voice thin. “Yes, Daddy, thank you, Daddy.” Harry’s mouth moved and he didn’t even realize it, words flowing more freely than breath. “None of them could have been my Daddy; it always had to be you.”
“Wow.” It was impossible for Draco to imagine that. He loved Lucius Malfoy dearly, but giving up his life to take care of Lucius? That was really something.
“If you’d gone to a wizarding gay bar everyone would have been all over you, that’s true,” Draco nodded. “Some in the wizarding LGBTQ community can keep secrets, but some can’t. You would have been exposed in more ways than one.”
“I have to eat before I go to bed,” Ginny shared casually with a shrug. Casual conversation, in her opinion, should at least be an option between three people that just shagged. “Just can’t sleep well without it.”
The burn of the stretch climbed its way up Harry’s backside, forcing a shudder out of him when Draco pushed fully back in again, grinding his hips so deep. “Thank,” Harry panted. “Thank you…”
It honestly should not have been that much of a shock. The curtains alone were one of the most divine things Olivia has ever laid eyes on. Clusters of dark flowers danced over the lavender fabric whenever the wind blew, and they were the softest thing she’d ever felt. It was more like a cloud than fabric.
Draco started with a slow rock of his hips that built towards bigger motions, hips swirling in tandem with Harry’s. Before either quite knew it their bodies were slick with sweat and colliding with one another in fast, loud slaps.
He pulled Draco body so close that the only way they could manage it was to press their cheeks together, and pulled Draco’s hand off of his cock. Making sure they missed the friction for only a moment, Harry pressed their sides of their members together and widened his grip to stroke them in tandem.
“You’ll convert them, I’m sure of it,” Maggie teased. “But what if they come out to you as straight?”
“Never. If anything, the kid gets a dragon,” Draco huffed. They were really the only animal he could stand, and you could ride them, too. Nothing like that giant chicken that had assaulted him in third year and Draco was even named after a dragon.
Hermione shook her head slowly. “So this is serious? More serious than knowing him for a night and moving in—you want this to last? I know you’re an adult who can make your own choices, Harry, so please tell me, what on earth made you choose this?”
The trial date was a media circus in spite of it being such a short trial indeed, and a hefty monetary outcome was rewarded to joint account for Draco and Harry—their first joint account of many much to Lucius’ dismay.
“Mmm, so I have this trick,” Draco began as his thumbs tweaked Harry’s nipples. “It always gets me right to sleep after. But I’ll need you hard and on your back, because I’m going to ride you until I’ve had my fill.”
“I dunno,” Harry shrugged, gripping Draco in return as he came down from his submissive high. “I guess I just got emotional during.”
Harry hadn’t had a clue what conversation had gone on in his parlor, which was greatly in Blaise’s favor. Harry would deck the fucker who cheated on his friend.
“Agreeable indeed,” Draco nodded as he conjured forth the rules he’d been working on for years. “Rule One: If we are to enter into this arrangement it would become a main, monogamous focus. I take this seriously.”
“Hello?” the girl on the other end of the line answered. Being muggleborn had made her adept with a cellphone.
Harry smiled, putting out his other foot so Draco could fasten the silken strips around Harry’s left ankle to the leather ‘X’ he had unshrunk from his collection of furniture for later placement. “Sure, Daddy.”
Still under Draco’s complete control with how he had his nipple grasped, Harry did his best to do what he was told. He unbuttoned Draco’s black trousers and pushed them down over the tent in his pants, getting them all the way down to Draco’s knees before Draco let go of his nipple and helped himself out of the last of his clothing.
That was certainly a concerning prospect, considering how fond Harry was of Draco’s eyes. They were stormy and commanding and soft all at once, and he wanted to drown in—
Draco grinned. “I’ve received your application for an adoptive couple and I’d like to meet with you. Is Thursday at 2:00pm alright?” It would have to be, since girls were already scheduled for Thursday at 1:00pm and 3:00pm.
Ron ran a hand through his hair, messing it up pretty terribly. It really was a good thing he wasn’t trying to impress anyone anymore. Hermione liked him tangles and all and was in no position to judge after having slept off a majority of the previous week. Giving birth was hard, but she’d be back to work soon.
Turning his head to look out the window—since Harry obviously got the bed by the window—he saw what looked like a toy city below the setting sun. Everything was so small, like the people below were really just specs of dust in an old play-set. “At least we have a nice view.”
Draco paused to watch his new ‘nephew’ for a moment to see the rise and fall of Hugo’s tummy, wondering what it would be like to call one of those tiny creatures his own.
“Of course I do, Professor. And I am going to enjoy the look on your face when I get it most especially,” Draco confirmed with his signature smug look on his own face.
Draco’s search history probably had more debauchery than a thousand proms combined, but Lucius didn’t know that. “It’s a rite of passage, Draco. It’s a tradition that you should be taking part of. What are you going to do instead, play your ogres and elves game?”
Harry kept the arch in his back when he gripped the side, sticking his arse up just above the level of the water. He looked over his shoulder and shook his hips enticingly, earning him a few more pinches for his impatience. He took each one with a happy mewl.
James may have been a jerk as a child, but Severus had been one as an adult. When Harry thought of the things he called Hermione, Draco’s prodding as a child against her paled in comparison. A teacher was supposed to build their students up, not tear them down because they were smart and inquisitive. Even though Remus couldn’t brew to save his life, Harry wished he had taught potions. Maybe he would have actually learned something, then. “Yeah, sounds like a ball.”
Rose was at the sitter’s for the afternoon so Hermione could have an afternoon to herself without any fits or fusses, heels kicked up on their coffee table in the living room.
