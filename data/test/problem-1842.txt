Creeping out of bed, his body protested the movement. Especially his leg. The joint screamed at him viciously, and a peek under the sweatpants he knows he never put on revealed the abused flesh. His knee joint was a swollen and angry red mottled with dark purple near black bruising. Hadrian grit his teeth, a foggy recollection of a boot stomping on his leg.
The morning rose softly, Hadrian’s eyes blinking as the glow pried his eyes open. Draco’s blond head was burrowed into his hair and his arms were squashing Hadrian’s face into his neck. The raven haired man laughed softly, kissing a hickey on Draco’s neck before rolling out of his grasp. Hissing a good morning to Nagini and wandering downstairs to start the coffee maker.
. It was unnerving really when Alex tapped on his shoulder and received that look. His eyes held nothing in them, not even a twinkle of the bright light that was in his mother’s eyes usually. He was unfocused, and Alex felt particularly insulted when instead of talking to him, the girl basically glued to his brother answered for him.
“Of course.” Lucius rummaged through his files.
“I don’t know where young Mr. Potter is. Alexander is finishing up the semester at home, you know how family problems go. I’d assume Lily and James took some time off to console and teach their son.” Severus rounded on his employer.
The only thing that held him back from lunging at the little prat was the pain in his leg, the fear of death, and James Potter glaring at him as if daring him to disobey. As it stood, Hadrian found it easier at each meal to ignore the food and everyone there. Let himself waste away and laugh as the ones who ‘loved’ him. Simply watched it happened.
-No worry about getting caught for underage magic
“Erin here is a little magic, she never tried to be an active part in the wizarding world however. She’s a high ranking officer in an international anti-bio-terrorism unit, but she was certain to bring both muggle and magic culture into the house when Harry joined our family. Also the books certainly helped us understand that our other two daughters were showing signs of accidental magic as well. I was wondering why the hell I kept losing the TV remote when it was time for bed.” Snape raised a brow. Erin answered.
Ignoring the whispering, the anger simmering underneath his skin like a boiling kettle. The eyes boring holes into the back of his head from a boy who looked to much like his nightmares for Hadrian to ever be completely comfortable. Ignoring the boy beside him who was trying to be nice and a friend to him when
“For you? His father? He should have been worth the world.” James glared and opened his mouth. But Sirius was tired of listening. “Avada Kedavra.”
“We need to get a picture for the moms. Mama would lose her god damn mind. This is just her aesthetic.”
This chapter was inspired by one of you commenters! (Harris you know who you are, did I get the name right?)
“The password to his office.”
Yule break started on the right note, they were to take the train to Draco’s house, where their parents and them would be staying until after the court case and the holidays. The snow was falling like a winter wonderland, sandwiched between his best friend and his sister and coming home to a large manor where a toddler flung herself into his arms.
“You know you’re going to have to talk to me eventually. You’re coming home for Christmas!”
“He did the thing, didn’t he? I swear, he could say the most mundane things. But how he says them you think he was Dane Cook or something.” Another flat glare was fixed at her as Hadrian fell silent again. Though this time Draco didn’t feel that stab of coldness, so he assumed Harry was a bit more comfortable in his skin now and just choosing not to respond.
“Hadrian will kill you if you spew that violence in front of his baby. Both of them.”
Morosely, she set the table just as the floo sounded and she perked up with a quick, but weak, smile. Her husband came strolling into the dining room, still wearing his Auror robes and his brown hair windswept gorgeously. He gave her a heart stopping smile, looking behind his glasses with warm hazel eyes. At least some things would never change. A quick kiss and then they both sat down to their dinner before Lily pounced.
Wait for Ministry Assistance
Alex sat down on the stool with a small glance at the side. Hadrian’s friends had all been thrown to the snakes! It was perfect, when he was in his rightful house with Alex he’d see how he was supposed to act. Right now, standing there on his own, he already looked so much better, his posture was still straight, but his hands tucked into his pockets. Shoulders back with easy and powerful grace. He wasn’t more powerful than Alex, but having some intimidation to back him up was always good. That’s why Draco ran with Crabbe and Goyle after all. He almost reminded Alex of Uncle Sirius.
The twins tormented his brother merrily for the rest of the month until they were in the beginnings of December. Each prank more humiliating and hilarious than the last. Until anger finally simmered down into distrust and dislike. Suspicion was also off the Dragma twins as Alex finally stopped screaming about how Laney set him up. (Dumbledore tried to back his savior up, but by the time anyone thought to check their wands it was too little too late and all that was on Laney’s prior incanteum was incendio spells).
Hadrian leaned back and examined his lists. Every second here was a chance for him to be injured. And even complying meant suffering under the hands of James cruelty and Lily’s ignorance. What did you pick when there were no good options left?
And James wand flew out of his hands into Sirius’ where he snapped it with barely a thought before forcing James to his knees at wand point. “Now, before I arrest you and Albus, I get to do this. WHY?! WHY DID YOU HURT MY GODSON?! HOW COULD YOU DARE LAY A HAND ON AND ABANDON YOUR OWN SON YOU WORTHLESS PIECE OF SHIT!”
. The sharp pieces of his broken wand parting his flesh easily as it had his hair, as if it were a hot knife through butter. Blood was flowing easily, but not overflowing as to drip and ruin the circle. He looked out his window. Night was still young. He got to work. Jabbing the homemade brush into his arm and careful drawing the symbols.
Rage. Fury. Rage.
The hall was gorgeous.
The raven grinned as doors flung themselves open ‘by themselves’ and then slammed shut behind him. He’d stunned James, but that had really slowed him down in his desperate flight. He needed to just get past the wards, past the wards James would be caught if he cast a curse and Hadrian would be immediate apprehended for accidental magic. Either he’d escape and call the knight past, or he would catch the attention of the Ministry and let them handle it.
Draco had never expected this when they’d met.
“The Greater Good, you mean what suits you and your agenda rather than the law or the good of my traumatized godson. You will lose Albus, that court loss and this media circus is only for your loss. I hope losing everything reminds you what you’ve taken from me and the mothers you are so callously ignoring.” Severus finally relented, allowing Albus to scuttle towards the Great Hall. His glare following him the entire way until his frown melted into a smirk. Minerva should keep him busy enough. “Cockroach Clusters.”
“We’ll take care of it. It’s all a misunderstanding that can be cleared up nice and quick.” Sirius felt ill listening to them plot and plan against his innocent godson. The child who did nothing wrong, at least, nothing bad enough to warrant the abuse and the
That, made sense. All his parents, legal and illegal.
Immediately there was pandemonium in the courtroom. A Lord to an Ancient and Noble House doing such a thing was a scandal. Extremely. Hadrian leaned back and watched with apathetic eyes as the judge furiously berated the Potters and signed every document allowing his mothers custody and even a restraining order while giving James and Albus the evil eye. Annabee squealed happily and threw herself at Hadrian. Making a couple Lords smile indulgently as the eldest Dragma held and rocked her softly. Draco snickered quietly.
“I’m aware. I’m here to take both of you in. You’re wanted for kidnapping, disregarding a restraining order, and quite a few other things. Does Lily know truly what you’ve done? Or have you just pacified her with Dumbledore’s greater good argument?” James snarled at him and Sirius just looked his fill. Before James started flinging spells at him.
“Stupefy.”
“Why didn’t I know you? Tom said you looked like us, but I didn’t think anything of it. But you’re my little prince. My Hadrian.” The brunet was pliant as Severus held him tight, knuckles blood white from how tight he was holding Draco’s mate. Hadrian glanced at the sheet, eyes widening when he saw the words on the top, slowly, Hadrian was able to uncurl from his Uncle. Not going too far, he stayed plastered to his uncle’s side as Hadrian looked at the sheet, grabbing the stapled pages.
It was hilarious to watch a python herding a snack sized calico kitten.
“Not a bad idea. Crabbe and Goyle are already down in the hall.” Hadrian sighed and just decided to skip the robe as Suni cheekily rested her head on his shoulder. At least she let him put on a tank top and pants. “Are you going to walk around like that.”
-Lily likely won’t let him kill me if she heeled my head and leg
Laney was soon in front of him, but he firmly held the smaller girl to his chest when Laney tried to relieve him. Hadrian looked up at his friend with a bright smile that she’d never seen on him, eyes more alive than any fire and misty as his voice cracked and rasped.
“Ah, they network so young these days. Yes. I’d like that very much Severus.” Severus smirked.
All Hadrian could do was slide to the ground and weep.
“Yes. God, Dray, yes. I’d always marry you.” Draco grinned, a hysterical laugh bubbling up as he grabbed Hadrian in his arms and spun him around until they were both dizzy. Hadrian looked up at him and let his morph bleed away, uncaring of the scars as he kissed his
Faith in the savior? Gone. Belief that he was righteous and good? Destroyed.
“Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville has lost one.” Her nasally voice was the nails on the chalkboard. Making him bristle and any contentedness in his chest die quickly, both at the interruption and the high and loud tone of voice. Draco basically growled at her.
The shorter woman gave him a sweet smile, “Call me with that lawyer’s number. It’d be nice to meet Draco’s father. Hadrian and Laney positively gush about the lad. If that’s all, expect all these ‘meetings’ to stop. I’m considering you a threat to our family and I will file a restraining order if you push me or my son. Good day.”
Sweet like candy.
“No, conflict of interest. Albus is a well known family friend, especially when we let him become Alex’s godfather. Any court case with us bars him from voting or having anything to do with the jury or hearing.”
“Hey!” Annabee leaned back and glared.
“I wouldn’t blame you. It happens you know.” Hadrian could see the understanding and between the lines words in Draco’s eyes. The blonde mulled over the words, before he stepped closer to Hadrian.
It was a fast friendship.
He looked both different and exactly as Alex had pictured. His eyes were Mom’s shade of green, but everything else was all Dad. With fair, but not pale skin and lean, sharp limbs. A seeker’s build, or chaser. Alex didn’t expect the lack of glasses however, in every picture Harry had been a quiet frown with wide green eyes, hidden by glasses and unruly black hair. Harry now however had no glasses, his eyes were big and long, framed neatly with bangs and hair pressed into a long ponytail that made him look kinda girly. Alex would have to convince him to maybe trim the hair, or at least wear it differently.
Godparents in wizarding society were as good as third or fourth parents to a child. They held nearly all the same parental rights to any child under their care. It was the reason their mothers were pleased that Severus took all three of them as his godchildren, it meant in the event of their passing Severus was next in line by the eyes of Magic. And Magic wasn’t to be trifled with in the matters of children. The fact that the Potters had denied visitation and custody to someone who
“Immediate dismissal! Custody stays with Hadrian Potter-Dragma’s mothers! Potter I want to see you up front
“This school year is going to be hell. That insufferable headmaster is still in charge even though he’s been bedridden. I want to stay here.” Hadrian nuzzled into his arms, making Draco sigh. The warm sun was kissing his skin comfortably as they sat on the beach’s bench.
“Ah, Miss Dragma. This is Mr. and Mrs. Potter, and I’m sure you’ve met Alex.” Laney flicked her hair over her shoulder when Alex reached out a hand to shake.
Alexander lit up as Hadrian’s gaze slid over to him. “Harry! Why have you been sitting with the snakes, come on. You should be with me don’t you think? We should be catching up, I haven’t seen you in years. Please?” Draco snorted.
“School isn’t over yet; do you remember now?” The man shook his head.
“You are with Crabbe, Goyle and I, I presume so. Laney can stay with us and her brother for the night.” The two siblings nodded easily, Hadrian’s arm slung around her waist and she grinned brightly.
God, he hoped they hadn’t touched his mothers. There would be more hell to pay that getting a vase chucked at their head if they had.
All that was left to do was wait.
“Lady Potter and the Potter tweedledee and tweedledum trying to get their grubby hands on my brother and trying to wreck our family in the process is a little more than distressing. I want to punch her son in his smug little face half the time.”
He couldn’t love his parents more.
“Yes. I don’t mind. Do as you see fit, I trust you.”
“Stop calling me out.”
Mooney was a quiet and kind man who was working with Severus to make sure Hadrian stayed up to speed with his schoolwork. The two men were ruthless of making sure Hadrian went above and beyond on his studies, until Padfoot interrupted to ‘save Hadrian’s brain from the book worms’. Watching the three bicker brought Hadrian a special joy and he rejoiced when Mama and Narcissa locked them in a closet together and they came out blushing and holding hands. All three of them.
“And, when did you get that?”
“Five years and I hadn’t heard a word about this?” Draco looked for help but found all three men sipped their tea and avoiding eye contact. Even Hadrian wasn’t paying real attention, instead looking intently at the snake that had slithered just beneath his crossed legs. Hadrian was obsessed with snakes and a Parseltongue, so Draco really wasn’t all surprised.
Hadrian gave a sunny smile, sipping his coffee. “Sounds like a plan. Thank you.”
“Don’t be sorry, I was being careless. That was my fault, but I’ve seen enough for right now.” With a blink, he was back in reality. Hadrian didn’t even bat an eye, taking a sip of coffee as if he weren’t mentally violated just seconds ago.
Pushing open the door, no elves bothered him at all. Either they were gone, or they were hiding away from the turbulent family magic. The dark haired man paused, voices were carrying down the stairs. Probably from the study. That was always where James went when he needed to brood or was stressed. It was where he hid the fire whiskey too. Sirius drew his wand and crept up the stairs, easily drifting through the halls like a silent breeze until he was peeking into the study.
A loud crack startled Hadrian. The raven whipped around only for something hard to smash into the back of his skull. Dropping like a rock, he hit the ground with a loud smack, Annabee falling from his arms. Distantly, he could hear her screaming and crying, but he couldn’t reach her. Moaning in pain as his head spun and pounded, he blindly groped the floor. Trying to blink the blood out of his eyes and find his baby sister as she continued to cry. Before he shrieked as a foot crushed his leg underneath its weight and a wand fell into his squinted view.
I thought it only fair that if I posted a filler chapter, that I hurry up and bring the substance to the plot a little bit quicker than usual. I hope you all like this early update! :)
Severus still dug around, finding nothing incriminating anywhere in the office. Or any papers unrelated to school and students except a single letter from the French Aurors that made him pause. There was only one man in France aside from the congress that Albus would attempt to speak with after the trial. Digging his hands into the envelope he wrenched the letter apart desperately.
“Twin?”
“Suni wouldn’t let him get dressed. It’s a Saturday anyway so, it’d probably be more exhausting to try and fight her on it.” Severus reached into his desk drawer and threw it at the half naked eleven-year-old. The raven shrugged it on without a single complaint, not even flinching as Severus shrunk it to fit him snuggly with a flick of his wand. Laney sniggered behind her brother’s shoulder, only smirking when Severus gave her a withering glare. Sara was all over them quickly enough, checking on them and kissing their cheeks. Lucius watched a little surprised as neither preteen tried to squirm away from her affections as many older children did, only basking in it. It was refreshing after three years of Draco’s ‘I’m a big boy’ attitude at being ‘coddled’.
“His name’s Hadrian, take a hint lady.” Hadrian gave a near silent snort and Snape patted her head.
McGonagall reappeared in the doorway of the school, “Students! Come in, it’s time for the sorting to start!”
“Sirius! What are you doing?! Release him, that’s Albus!” Sirius continued walking forward.
She was next up, the court hearing apparently was scheduled before Yule, so she was on a timeline. If Laney was anything at all, she was good under pressure. Hadrian watched from the library as Alex bumped into her in the hall. Obviously, he couldn’t resist spitting vitrol blaming her for Hadrian’s desertion. He was waving her wand around.
Thomas, Severus had named their child after him.
He tugged on Hadrian’s ponytail softly, lips pressed to his beloved’s crown. Who knew he would find his Veela mate so early in life and fall so deeply in love with him before even the bond kicked in. Draco’s fingers twitched, it was nearing the end of summer and he hadn’t even gotten to introduce his parents to Hadrian.
“Anytime.”
Five minutes in and he was already homesick. What a disaster he was.
Eventually, they finally ended their trip at Gringotts. Draco was nearly vibrating with excitement. Hadrian just rolled his eyes and dismissed his hyperness easily enough. His mother and their lord decided to go to some of the clothing shops, he could hear them debating color schemes the moment they had separated. Uncle Sav and his father had decided to accompany the boys to get Hadrian’s test. Because of the Malfoy status at the bank they were given a private room to get the test. It was a rather easy one. Hadrian was given a dagger and instructed to place seven drops of blood into the quill so it would begin to write on the various pieces of parchment.
“What did Albus say?” James scowled and her heart dropped.
“If so why do you always speak for him! He’s got a mouth, but you are always putting words in it for him. Leave him alone!” Obviously the wrong thing to say as Laney became enraged. Eyes burning like a raging fire as she spit out vitrol like it was going out of style.
Having only James and herself at home again was nice, but she missed her son.
It probably didn’t help that their parents weren’t calm either.
“That would make a scene! I almost want to see that. But I rather like you two, so I think sticking with me would be in both of our best interests. I’ll teach you how to mix with the right sort. Are you… muggle-raised?” Draco said it with a slight grimace, but Hadrian appreciated the effort. A lot of pureblood families like the Malfoy’s had strict beliefs that would take time to break down. Laney spoke first.
“You have such filthy language.”
They were supposed to go to him and welcome him back home, but all they had found was her sister sneering at them and slamming the door in her face. The words bounced around her head and made every blood cell in her body turn to ice.
The rest of the trial went about the same, Albus touting the idea of family and love as well as trying to destroy any credibility the Dragma-Anderson household had. Which didn’t work as Lucius viciously and expertly destroyed any doubts and turned back the accusations on the Potters, who were much less prepared for such accusation. Hadrian rolled his eyes discreetly as many Lords were beginning to look at the Potter’s with distain. Especially when his therapist brought up his PTSD and abandonment issues from being tossed at his relatives when he was old enough to remember everything. The few purebloods who agreed with tossing a squib relative always did it young or obliviated the child of the magical world. Obviously, the Potters were hoping Albus and their fame would be enough to ride the coat tails to victory.
Draco pushed the thoughts away. His lord and his mother were the first to-dos.
It’d taken effort and destroying the beautiful tie that Draco had given him. But his leg was clogged up enough to not give him away was he limped to the Potter library and immediately beelined to the Family Grimoire. The raven smiling when he found the book conveniently lying on a table next to a plate that had popped into existence before his eyes.
Next chapter we'll have our great escape! Wonder who's going to get there first ;)
“My son doesn’t have to talk to anyone he doesn’t want to.” Sara turned to look at Snape, “I do want to let you know that he sometimes gets overwhelmed and let’s Laney talk for him. He’s quiet and quite sensitive despite his matureness, he doesn’t mean to be rude.”
“My father’s here at school apparently. I wonder where he is, and why?”
“Blackouts, I go to a boarding school, but I never remember going or coming home. It’s like I don’t exist for nine months, I fall asleep on August 31
“It’s Hadrian Piers Dragma.”
“Draco! I thought you had school?” Draco’s face uncontrollably split into a wide smile. A feral part of his mind purred,
Oh, and they’ll be here at the school again, but they might not see us.
Hadrian blinked with mild surprise as the adults were already seated at the table, looking a little worse for wear. Tired and worn down. The man smiled at them gently and ducked past Tom, his father, to get into the kitchen. Pulling a box of pastries out of the fridge and tossing them on the counter for everyone to pick at. The pot of coffee was already brewed to Hadrian’s delight. Tom or Severus must have made coffee for them.
“Are we taking it to court?” Lily questioned softly.
“Oh do tell?” The Potters looked confused, only Lily and Albus were perceptive enough to look wary with their Slytherin banter.
I figured I'd update because I work open to close tomorrow! Enjoy! (Also Imma ask for help picking which fic I work on next so be on top for that my friends)
“What did you need me for? The rooms perfect!” Hadrian rolled his eyes and shoved Draco to sit on the end on the bed. Plopping down onto Draco’s lap so he couldn’t escape.
Remus had stayed behind the second they’d gotten the letter. Packing up their house, preparing to move back to Britain if only to be close to him again. Sirius was ready to work his ass off to find his godson and then spend the rest of his life on his knees begging him and his new family for forgiveness and for a second chance. Severus, Lucius, and Mrs. Dragma had been prepping him on barging into Potter man and searching the place when there was a crack and Mrs. Anderson had run out the door.
All her fault.
“No one has seen the Potters since Hadrian went missing, Madame Bones is already starting a search, but it will take some time. They haven’t been stripped of their most Noble title because the court case wasn’t even an hour ago.”
“I’m looking into that now.” Mother was ice cold fury as she spoke in low tones with Lucius, hands twitching as if looking for her magnum. Lucius was rifling through different law books and sending owl after owl out to various connections at the Ministry and other powerful Lords.
Another smaller chapter, but if it makes you feel better! The next chapter was so big that I had to split it into two separate chapters lol! So you're in for a treat once I upload that!
“That’s a bit like basketball on brooms, right? Not really, but sort of? Hadrian, I think has been interested in the dueling club, he doesn’t like heights. Laney however I think likes the idea of fly tackling someone in the middle of the air. She was quite good at football when she and Harry were on their pee-wee team. Oh, how cute they looked in cleats and Harry wore his hair in braids. I miss those days.” James smiled finally.
“I hope you have all your things of value brother. You’re coming home now.” He shrugged his shoulders, he never had anything. Harry glanced down, he could see the glittering of glass in his skin, Docile and dazed. He didn’t fight her as they weaved their way through the crowds and the people until they were at her home. Their home. Dragging him up the fire escape on the side of the building to their apartment on top, Laney went running into the house yelling and dragging a petit woman with soft brown hair and honey brown eyes holding a baby.
“God, I gotta work on pronouncing half of this. First one’s drought of living death? Draught? Second one is the stomach of a goat, that was the bezoar question. Third is nothing, both are aconite.” Snape pinched the bridge of his nose and summoned the sheet of parchment from her hands. Glancing it over and nodding firmly.
Sitting perfectly straight in their seats like a normal family was
“Okay James… we’ll wait to connect Sirius. Can Albus help us?”
“She’s a banana ball python, and a big girl. She’s getting close to five feet long, which is the normal average size for a full grown python. She’s a good girl, she’ll love you.” Draco gave a childish grin, finally looking like a kid rather than a haughty old man.
“It’s not that rare.” His voice was smooth and level, the blonde blinked quickly, staring intently as Hadrian leaned his head back. Stretching his shoulder’s back elegantly and confidently as Mother taught him commanded attention and consideration. “My biological family were all Gryffindors. I’m certain my ex-brother will be vying to go to their family house. The Weasleys are another traditionally Gryffindor house hold, like the Lovegoods are traditionally Ravenclaw. Many old wizarding families in Britain have family expectations.”
The ex-Potter started slow, it didn’t matter what you did it mattered how you were seen after all. Laney was seen as a holy terror with good intentions. He was the quiet scope of control and grace. Forever he would be the good quiet kid.
“Yes, that’s true.”
“The war is more important right now. Thank you for your shelter, Hadrian. As well as the meal, it’s delicious.” Hadrian smiled gently, his frame flickering as it went back to honey tan skin and dark brown hair. Working around the snake on his shoulders, Hadrian green eyes didn’t even glance at his hands as he quickly pulled out his ponytail and put it into a messy bun.
Hadrian was Draco’s heaven outside of the wizarding world. Though, he was definitely a wizard (and god he hoped he was maybe a half-blood because then he would have half a chance at convincing his father that this was okay). He was still Draco’s.
Escape Myself
Scrambling, The raven grabbed the concrete walkway with both of his hands and dragged himself forward and squirmed until he was in the ward lines. He felt bad for bleeding all over the Malfoy’s nice walkway and leaving what were probably startling drag marks. But he was finally safe from any of the Potter nut heads. Though, he probably had some time before James or Albus came calling to the Malfoys either way.
The ring.
Dumbledore.
It couldn’t be. Had to be a dream. Had to be a nightmare or trick or
“Ah, you’re right. My platonic knight in shining armor. The brotherly prince to my damsel in distress.”
"Wimp.”
“James?”
“And do tell me, what is that child?” Hadrian hummed, a smile on his lips.
“I thought… I didn’t know what was going to happen and I only had precious few months with him in the summer. Things kept getting in the way after fourth year, but I promise I had a plan to tell you once we turned sixteen and I found out…” Draco trailed off thoughtfully, looking at Hadrian with pure awe and reverence when his love pet the dangerous snake with absolutely no fear. His mother eyed him curiously before his unspoken words hit her and she gasped.
“Hadrian’s making a pot of coffee now, this conversation first. I need help.” Severus was wide awake. “It’s not big. Well, I think it is, but Hadrian has memory problems. Like he doesn’t remember months of his life, and something about it gives me a bad feeling and he won’t listen to me. So, I was wondering if…”
“Mrs. Anderson, may I offer some assistance?” The smaller woman looked at him near desperately, looking at her kids with the most heartbroken eyes. She moved closer to kneel in front of the children cautiously.
Dark and murky, the water beneath the ice swirled agitated and aggressively. Severus placed a foot on the edge, cracking the surface slightly and gasping as the memory washed over him.
Laney withdrew her hands revealing a tiny calico kitten blinking cutely around the room. Hadrian frowned at his familiar as Suni gave the tiny creature a speculative eye. Draco snapped back to himself. He was eleven, he would not be jumping the bones of a boy he just met.
The grin Draco wore looked like it would break his jaw. “Absolutely. Sounds brilliant!”
“No. He hasn’t spoken to me since we sent Harry to his relatives. He’s in France with Moony, I don’t even know their address to send him a letter. There’s also the chance he’d be pissed at me enough to grab Harry and run. As the legal and blood-adopted godfather we gave him, he would be harder to fight than the lesbians.”
“Be calm my boy. He’ll have been returned to the Malfoys and his adoptive mothers, he’ll be back to school after they feel it is safe enough and then we can try again. We’ll do a blood adoption and perhaps a compulsion potion just to keep him put. You shouldn’t have given him access to the library, nor kept his door unlocked.” Albus’ voice was soft with a gentle cadence, he was in a similar state of undress.
Hadrian gave a low chuckle, “I can’t say I have given it much thought. I think I’d rather like Slytherin or Ravenclaw. If I were trapped with my ex-brother in a common room I think I’d be sent to Azkaban within the hour for madness and attempted murder.” The blonde laughed loud and uncontrolled for half a second.
One was a monster, one was an ignorant coward, and one was a monster in progress.
“The bath?”
This is the man who took his godson. The man he couldn’t recognize anymore. This was his enemy. He mourned for his godson and each spell was his fury at everything he missed due to James keeping him away from him and then sending him away.
Obviously, the sight of a very bloody seven year old boy is off putting as the woman panics, pressing the baby into his gangly limbs in a rush to get a first aid kit and yelling for Laney to get some towels. It made Harry feel a muted warmth, a little fond at the concern of a woman who’s never even met him. But he was so far disassociated with the body tagged with his name he couldn’t fully comprehend it. Until a gurgle caught his attention.
“That doesn’t explain why I’m holding a Kit-Kat.”
Hadrian cocked his head to the side, sitting on the bed that had his trunk in front of it. Laney was kneeled in front of it, rifling in it for nightclothes. “I prefer showers, wonder where they put my trunk. Oh! Suni, hi! Go to your daddy I need his clothes.” The three purebloods watched with wide eyes as a large yellow snake flopped out and quickly slithered up to the boy on the bed which made him smile. Looking so calm and so… powerful. Draco drank in the sight as Hadrian leaned back, all lean muscle and gentle motions as he stroked the large snake’s scales, contented hissing erupting every now and again. “Marissa! My cuddly baby.”
Didn’t stop him from nearly crawling the walls the day the trial was set to begin.
No, disrespecting his family had consequences. Hadrian didn’t plan on stopping until Alex was firmly trashed in the eyes of his peers. However, for all his careful planning what he hadn’t expect his brother to do all the work for him.
"Incendio.” Alex squealed as his book was set alight and Hadrian turned back around without a second glance. Draco gave a startled glance to the book and back at Hadrian, grabbing his arm in a gentle but firm grip. “No one will believe him. He’s sitting next to Seamus.”
“Oh.” Hadrian opened his mouth, but it almost looked as if he choked on air before he clamped his mouth shut and drew his legs up to his chest. One hand beginning to tug anxiously at his ponytail and his gaze settled just over Lucius’ shoulder, glassy and unfocused.
Tom was looking at him with wild and confused red eyes. Zeroing in on the paper in his hands and Severus’ arms wrapped around his body, and he came closer. Barely breathing the man stared at him as if he were looking at him for the first time. Like he was something special. Tracing the shape of his eyes and the fall of his disheveled ponytail, murmuring softly.
“With all the respect in the world, why are we here? You say the Potters regret their actions, but it was to protect Hadrian. But what child below Hogwarts age needs magic for protection? Alexander was at much at risk in their care, yet he was the one they kept. There is also the fact that we are trying to tear a child away from two mothers who have raised him and housed him with no aid from his parents who even after the adoption sent no letters, no yule gifts, no visits. Here we are trying to tear a son from the family that raised him legally and uncontested for four years and who is vocal in wanting to stay with his mothers. One who has even protested visitation with the family who abandoned him to muggle relatives without a glance back. Parents who are trying to use the effect their neglect had on him as a weapon in this trial against the parents who have done nothing by heal and treat Mr. Dragma as their own. Do you really want to destroy a family and return a child to a place they are afraid of going back to?” Albus looked enraged, especially as the thinly veiled ideas of disregard and the blatant proof of neglect had many of the Lords glancing piteously at the two mothers who were holding their three children tightly. Lucius suppressed a smirk, he was certainly confident off the get go Hadrian thought.
“You’re just pissed that you can’t find your brains behind your brash courage. My brother is fine where he is and the sooner you accept that the happier we all will be.” Alexander’s temper finally snapped.
Hadrian cocked an eyebrow. “Does that mean I need to cause a scandal? The only ‘closed door’ quirk I can think of is how shameless our mothers’ are with PDA. And that’s just so cute it’s sickening.”
The temptation to speak back up under those eyes was so clear and so there. But the words died in his throat and he just slumped back. Making Laney sigh discontentedly. “Hadrian’s hit his word limit for now. He’s the strong silent type you see?” With a cheeky wink and a smirk, she got Draco’s furrowed brows to lighten up with at least a fond eye roll.
Hadrian didn’t think it would matter too much to him if they didn’t remember. The way they had bracketed him between them. How S-Papa would look at him as if he hung the moon, or how Dad would look at him with so much awe and pride. Hissing to Nagini to watch over his prince with all she had. Hadrian knew that even if they couldn’t remember his birth and the year he’d been blessed to have with them, he would be fine. They loved him, and that was more than enough for Hadrian.
Something a bit lighter and funnier before we start getting into the climax of the fic! (I got plans like you wouldn't believe my friends >:)
“Good, how’s school going?” The raven was still blinking back into focus, but he gave a thumbs up. Laney snorting beside him.
“We’re going to get him back Anna. We won the court hearing, the ministry can’t ignore his kidnapping. Even if they did, Hadrian’s smart, he’ll figure a way out and then he’ll be sitting on the patio smirking at us with that quiet smugness asking why we’re freaking out so bad and don’t we trust him? Then, we’ll make a plan to
“The Potters threatened to sue for Hadrian’s custody yes.” The room got so quiet you could here a feather falling. The red haired girl fell silent, mouth slightly agape with wide and shocked eyes locked onto him. Hadrian’s eyes were just as wide, terrified as his body remained stiff as a board, knuckles white where they clutched at his sister.
Carefully, Tom handed the paper to Severus, not letting Hadrian look on it too much. It was enough to know his little boy had lived it. He didn’t need to be reminded of it. Tom watched his husband flick through the pages, as a Potions Master, Severus knew the human body much better than Tom. Severus already fair complexion went white as a sheet as he lingered on a single page, his hands brushing Hadrian’s neck. The teen stiffened and glanced at the paper.
He had his mother to thank his lungs for at least.
“I’m sure he didn’t mean that. I’m Lily, Alex said that your name is Laney correct?” The curly red head just glared at the older woman quietly, obviously still peeved and unwilling to engage. She shifted her attention to her ex-son before a kind smile blossomed on her face.
“So, pesto is hate sauce?”
“He’s my-“
Is that why he never remembered his school years, because he’d been twisted so beyond recognition from his gorgeous and loving Hadrian to arrogant and self-righteous Gryffindor Potter that he couldn’t bear to remember himself? How many times had Draco lashed out at ‘Potter’ because his green eyes had looked too much like Hadrian’s? Hurt his love when he’d been lost in what was probably a memory charm or something. And that headmaster, Dumbledore, was the old principal that Hadrian always called creepy. All the times that Draco had seen Potter stumbling out of the headmaster’s office in a daze made so much more sense now. Why hadn’t he seen it?
“He has an anxiety disorder, however we put him in weekly therapy for it. Have since we found out after we adopted him, and he showed trauma from his past abuse. Otherwise, I can’t see anything. He’s a normal kid, played football, went to school, played in the park with his baby sister and his twin. Got phenomenal grades, Sara was quite proud.”
Though, as a Veela, Draco only had one mate for the rest of his life. It made sense that he was unafraid of commitment, especially with someone he already felt attached too. Severus smiled into his coffee. The adoring looked Hadrian kept sending at Draco made his feel reassured that his godson was in good hands. Lucius leaned forward.
The sun was gloriously warm against his face, and his torso was also comfortable warm as Annabee slept sounding against his chest under the large tree. The sky was clear and a bright blue, not a cloud in sight in the garden of the Malfoy Manor.
“Of course Lucius, I’d be delighted to do dinner with you and your wife. I have a toddler if that’s okay?”
“With the potion you’re making we might remember.” Severus sighed into his chest.
Dumbledore cleared his throat, “Yes, I see. You mentioned Alex was quite upset when he met his brother again after so long. Do you know what happened?”
Laney was uncharacteristically quiet; she knew it was worrying everyone. But she couldn’t bring herself to do anything other than stare blankly at the squirming toddler in front of her or the strands of red hair that were slipping into her line of sight. Annabee was being nearly impossible to settle. Incoherent and inconsolable as her little limbs failed and sobbed in absolute hysterics. Hadn’t stopped crying since she’d fallen and Hadrian had disappeared before her eyes.
The long-haired brunet was smiling up at him with those sweet green eyes that would flash the most brilliant gold as he tumbled deeper into his thoughts. But, he didn’t grab for Draco’s full attention, he only relaxed under the blonde’s arm, smiling into the other’s chest and relaxing.
people were going to
Those kids were gone now.
Sirius snarled, “Expelliarmus.”
Soon the brunet was moving back into the room, grinning past the snake vying for his attention as he placed down the big dish in the center of the table. Draco almost drooled, but stuck to look at Hadrian with utter admiration.
Late into the night, after a long and hard conversation where Severus,
“Sweetie, you are home.”
, said he would work on brewing a memory potion immediately. Though it wasn’t likely to work on Hadrian, it was fine. He didn’t want to remember school if he was the Potter that Draco had whined about and cursed constantly. His fathers were desperate to remember though.
Lily flinched again, “Harry, I lo-“
It should have startled him when Hadrian barely even batted an eye at stabbing his own palm and bleeding into a quill. Until he remembered that as a declared dark wizard in his culture blood rituals were very common and socially acceptable, and that his beloved looked to cook and prep things with knives. As soon as the quill was full, Hadrian’s hand-stitched itself together and the two older men snatched up the parchment to inspect as the quill flew like a mad man down many pages. Starting with a new sheet when it ran out of room. Draco quirked a brow and Hadrian tugged his hand quizzically.
The full moon was so bright its light scattered over every leaf, illuminating the surfaces as though coated in glitter. Harry blinked. No, no glitter—just ordinary light. A cool breeze brushed past him, tenderly tickling at his exposed skin. Or maybe that was Draco’s hair? Harry’s fingers wound through the silky strands.
He pulled up outside number four, Privet Drive, and was halfway up the walkway when Petunia came bursting from the house. She carefully closed the door behind her, then stood, arms crossed, blocking Draco’s access.
Where was Harry?
Harry rented snorkelling gear, which Draco eyed suspiciously while Harry explained how it worked. There had been a sign warning guests not to venture out too far, but Harry paid it no heed. He and Draco were both excellent swimmers.
A wave of nausea passed through Draco. His heart clenched.
Artemis flapped her wings, sending his papers aflutter.
He grips Harry by the arms and pulls him up. “Ride me,” Draco says, his voice gruff.
“What in Merlin’s name is going on?”
Slowly, Harry ascends the stairs to the attic. He opens the small door and is immediately overcome by the earthy aroma of decades-old dust and aged wood—cleaning has never been a priority for Kreacher. The door closes behind Harry with a gentle click. Sunlight filters through dirty windows, casting diffuse light over the stacks of discarded odds and ends.
Harry was different from Potter. For one, there were no scowls or death glares directed at Draco. A part of Draco missed the heat generated from their rivalry. But, seeing Harry like this was also good, because this Harry was calm, relaxed, and open. The softness, the openness, felt intimate, like something Draco wasn’t supposed to see. He knew full well that Potter would never willingly show this side to Malfoy. It made Draco feel guilty, like an intruder stealing an experience that wasn’t meant for him.
Draco closed his eyes and took a deep breath.
In the time since Harry had woken up at his aunt’s house, his recollection had improved little. Sometimes he thought he was onto something, but his aunt would fill in the details, and his hunches were usually incorrect. He learned not to trust these inklings. But he still had the sensation that there was something important that he needed to remember. Something urgent he needed to do.
“Potter! What is the meaning of this?” Draco attempts to follow but finds the Sticking Charm has him rooted to the spot. He cancels the charm and instantly ends up on his arse. He huffs and stands, gripping the bannister tightly. Harry and Teddy make another loop — Teddy squeals,
“You are a terrible dancer.”
For a moment Draco looks like a kicked puppy, but then his face hardens into a defiant sneer. His lips move, and Harry knows all too well what he’s saying.
Draco stared back. The sudden shift surprised him, but he refused to be intimidated. “Where’s what?”
Harry’s initial excitement quickly faded. How was he supposed to let Draco in if he couldn’t leave his room? There was no way Petunia would let Harry out, and Hell would freeze over before she’d allow Draco inside. It was a hopeless fantasy. But at least Draco had thought of him. There was that.
Emerald eyes bore deeply into his own. “With my life.”
I should have them over for tea.
You stand in the kitchen doorway and take in the scene. Scorpius, dressed in his ducky pyjamas, sits on the kitchen worktop dipping his fingers into a bowl of icing. Harry throws his head back and laughs. His hair is a mess, and he’s wearing a ridiculous reindeer apron. You watch the reindeer’s nose blink on and off.
She smiled. “Thank you. It can’t be soon enough. I miss them so much.”
. He swallowed down his guilt with a sip of wine, and Hermione’s voice brought him back to the present.
One word, but it expressed so much. They both knew what had happened. And yet here they were, making polite conversation over a cup of tea like strangers. Because that’s what it was: Harry Potter, with his memories intact, did not want Draco Malfoy. In fact, Potter was probably angry with him—and rightfully so.
She shook her head. “No. Remember when I gave yours back? I asked you to take it from me.”
“Do you think it worked? I mean, do you think it worked how we planned?”
It was not something Lucius Malfoy would do.
(that’s why I love her).
He towelled off his hair and worked in a special leave-in serum his aunt had bought to tame his hair. Now it lay completely flat.
Two weeks after their initial confrontation, Petunia’s demeanour had completely shifted. She became warmer around Harry, caring for him, doting on him. It was a sharp contrast to the cold and dour woman he found in the living room that first morning. But grief affected everyone differently, and Petunia had been through so much. Harry couldn’t fault her for her lukewarm reception.
She walked to the front door, and Draco shouted, “Wait! There’s something you need to know.” Petunia turned to face him. He knew it was a betrayal of trust, but he’d do anything to save Harry’s life. So, he told her about the bottle of LSD under the loose floorboard in Harry’s room. He just hoped she listened, and for once put Harry’s needs first.
up in time to prevent Harry’s errant snowball from crashing into an antique vase.  “That’s enough, Potter. I doubt you’ve protected every heirloom.” Draco skates towards Harry but realises belatedly that he doesn’t know how to stop. They collide and Harry holds him up as the momentum forces them backwards. They come to rest in the doorjamb.
. Draco shook his head; he’d put the book inside his trunk. He didn’t have time for children’s tales.
Draco rolls his eyes. “Cast a Warming Charm. Or have you forgotten you’re a wizard? It’ll be perfect. I promise.”
Draco suddenly had little appetite. Granger—Hermione—was suffering, and Draco could end it with a confession. He should tell her the truth—Harry Potter’s alive. But then Petunia’s voice played in his head.
The results were disappointing.
Draco tugs Harry down for another kiss. “Yes. But not in the attic. Why don’t you put these away in our wardrobe instead? I have a feeling we’ll soon need them again.”
Malfoy has filled out since the war. He’s tall, buff, and gorgeous, but still an arrogant git. You’d think surviving a dark wizard would have given us something in common, or at least incentive to let bygones be bygones. But no, Malfoy’s as prickly as ever, and he never misses an opportunity to trade barbs or point out any of my shortcomings. Hermione calls them
Potter pinched the bridge of his nose. “Why is this so hard?”
on Harry’s forehead, but much to his concern the crack remained untouched by the Healing Charm. He tried not to worry.
He wasn’t sure what to expect when he’d rung Potter’s number. A woman, surprised and suspicious, had quizzed him mercilessly before putting Harry on. Their conversation might have been awkward—he wasn’t lying when he said they’d never been friends—but they talked as though they were old chums. That’s how it ought to have been, had Hogwarts houses and Weasleys and blood status and psychopathic megalomaniacs not interfered. Perhaps fate was intervening now to right a wrong?
Harry stood on a platform. There was something familiar about the place, the atmosphere, but he couldn’t put his finger on it. Mist swirled around him, and although he couldn’t see it, he heard a train nearby. An old man approached. He was strange looking, with long grey hair, and an equally long beard to match. Half-moon spectacles perched on his crooked nose, and he wore a peculiar silver cloak. He stared at Harry, unspeaking, for a very long time, and Harry grew uneasy.
“I want you,” Harry panted between kisses, brushing his lips along Draco’s jaw.
Artemis looked at Draco expectantly. Knowing her preferences, he forewent the biscuit and scooped out the last of his Szechuan chicken. He chuckled as the bird delighted in the spiciness, pecking at large chunks. While the owl ate, Draco glanced at the book, and then banished it to his school trunk where his past belonged. But was it really possible to tuck it all away and truly move on as Harry suggested?
“She has? That’s wonderful,” Draco exclaimed. He knew she could do it. But then his eyes narrowed. “She left you alone?” He couldn’t help the intensity of his voice.
“Is this some kind of joke?” Anger flashed in his eyes; his mouth tightly set.
But I’ll have to stop by her painting in the morning. She loves to spill the tea.
Draco wondered how. Fixing a wand should be impossible. He knew there was more to the story, something she wasn’t telling him. He suspected the answer to that question resided elsewhere in the house.
“Why don’t we go upstairs,” he purrs, “and see if we can make the most of our… predicament?”
. Thinking about it makes me feel like I’ve ants crawling all over my skin, just like the time that hook-nosed freak cast that spell on me. His magic was greasier than his hair, and it clung to me for days like a film. I showered and showered and still didn’t feel clean. And Lily, infected by the same abnormality, just laughed. Shrugged it off like it was nothing.
—to receive Draco’s forgiveness. The trousers had been a tad snug then, and Harry’s unsure if he’ll be able to wear them now.
Harry panted and took Draco’s cock in hand. “I’ve heard Paris is lovely this time of year.”
“It’s not that. I want to.” Draco brushed a lock of hair out of Harry’s eyes and placed a chaste kiss on his lips, even though his cock was shouting at him to push Harry down and have him. “I really do. But—”
He swallowed. “I meant all of it. I was on the wrong side, and I knew it by the end. But by then it was too late. If I could change everything… go back and do it all again, I would.”
Had Harry known this and run away from his own fame? But then why not confide in his closest friends? Why make them suffer? Or did he really not remember?
He came up with a plan, a novel and outlandish plan, so crazy it might work.
” He said the words aloud, his voice thick with sleep.
Harry was a Horcrux; he’d said so in the letter. It made sense. The Parseltongue, his mind connection with the Dark Lord—word had spread among the Death Eaters.
She hung up. Draco stared at the receiver and thought of the locks on Harry’s bedroom door.
“Harry says that’s because they’re made with love.”
“Are you sure you won’t change your mind and come tonight?”
The papers find out anyway. Speculation about the Chosen One’s sordid affair with a Death Eater makes the front pages of the
Harry gasps.
I can’t hear whatever response Draco has to that because his mouth is covered by Harry’s once more. It seems like some amount of grinding is going on again, and I can’t see one of Harry’s arms so I can only assume it’s slipped underneath those awfully convenient robes. This time, Draco’s hands are free and he is obviously using them to great effect, based on the noises Harry’s making.
“Is it not good?” Draco asked, panting to catch his breath.
He lit a cigarette and took a deep drag as he examined himself in the mirror. Dark circles stood out, indicating his lack of proper sleep, and there was ink smeared on his cheek from sleeping on his hand. But his forehead… The left side of his forehead, usually flawless, contained a small fissure—a pale pink mark in the shape of a lightning bolt. What had happened? Had he knocked his head and not remembered?
Draco wouldn’t—he wanted to get this over with so he could leave. But Potter summoned a pot of tea from the house, and it settled down at the garden table before Draco could answer.
“You’ve no sense of self-preservation,” Draco replied, but the side of his mouth twitched as he tried to suppress his laughter.
“It should work now.”
, he carefully slips them into his pocket. With a final wistful glance in the mirror, he Disapparates.
What was done was done.
“Petunia, you can’t do this!” He pounded on the door, but he could already hear her footsteps retreating down the stairs. He had a powerful urge to throw the tomato soup against the wall but clenched his hands into fists instead. Who knew when his next meal would come?
“That’s why you love me.”
But Harry stopped speaking, because the old man’s cloak darkened from the hem upward—as though he’d stepped in a puddle of ink—until it became pitch black. His face distorted, shifting and mutating until he had no hair and no nose—only slits for nostrils. Red eyes stared daggers at Harry, and a cold voice snarled,
18 August 1998
“This is smart, but it’s risky. You do understand that if we do this, he may not remember anything after the battle? None of the time you spent together.”
“What happened here?”
, I made all our albino peacocks the size of mice. They flocked into the tree and made the most delightful living ornaments. At first Mother did not approve, but I reminded her she did say I could decorate how I wanted. So, she let them stay until the New Year, provided we didn’t tell Father. After that, it became a tradition.”
It’s about a woman with amnesia who starts a new life, but the past comes back to haunt her.”
, Draco thought, and caught a flash of blond hair in the rear-view, reminding himself of his father. But before any guilt could come rising up he glanced at Harry and was overcome by his cheeky yet bashful smile. No, this was better, because Potter was willingly here with him, even if he didn’t know what he was doing.
His stomach swirled, filled with slippery slugs, and his fingers burned as though alight with flames. When Harry looked down, red-hot fire ants covered his hands. They crawled over his skin, ascended his arms, climbed up his neck and onto his face, their tiny legs tickling and burning. One by one they disappeared into the crack in his forehead.
Harry looked up at the stars. He didn’t think he could face Draco when he told him.
“Hello, Potter,” Draco replied quickly. After everything that had transpired, it felt truly bizarre to be making small talk now. “Hermione’s inside, is she?”
“The war is over; I suppose it makes no difference if I tell you now.” Hermione bit her lip, and Draco nodded in encouragement. “Professor Dumbledore gave Harry, Ron and I a task, a dangerous mission, and I couldn’t risk Voldemort”—Draco cringed at the casual use of the Dark Lord’s name—“using my parents as leverage against us. So, I modified their memories and relocated them to Sydney.”
It’s done. I no longer need to worry about Draco Malfoy. Harry, on the other hand… It’ll be all right, though. I’ll set him straight. He’s so lucky he has me.
. The Aurors must have set them to protect Potter’s family from Dark wizards. Draco took another step, and his ears rang. His lungs constricted, and he could no longer draw air. Of course, that’s when Potter opened the door. He smiled a bright smile, his dimple on display, and Draco tried to return the smile, to act like everything was normal—how could he possibly explain this without giving the situation away? His entire body felt like he was in the throes of Apparition; like it was being sucked inwards. Just as Draco was sure he would asphyxiate, Harry took his hand and said, “Please, come inside.”
“You could have taken it back, but you didn’t.”
Harry’s pencil snaps. The man seriously has no shame. He works in accounting yet finds any excuse to be in the Auror department whenever they call in the Curse-Breakers, fawning and falling all over Malfoy. It makes Harry sick. Hermione passes Harry a replacement pencil and loudly tells Goldstein he has no class. But the incident has not affected Malfoy, who remains poised in his pose. Graceful. Gorgeous.
“You’re early,” she said without looking at Draco. She continued to gaze out over the gardens.
Harry reaches into his pocket and pulls out a miniature pair of ice skates. “
Harry steps forward and cups Draco’s face. Tears stream down Harry’s cheeks, numbed by the wind. “I’m so sorry. I was such a coward. If I could take it all back…”
“You need to invite me in,” Draco said in hushed tones, not wanting to alert Petunia to his presence.
. Harry hissed at the loss of warmth and friction, his hard cock suddenly cool in the morning air.
be over Harry’s dead body if he doesn’t go. His magical core is shutting down.”
“For now.” Draco turned Harry around to face him and raised an eyebrow at his apron: Gryffindor red, with cartoon Chelsea buns and the caption,
Harry cleared his throat. “Actually, I don’t. I’ve told you. I don’t remember anything.” He picked up one of the photos and gestured to the beefy man with the moustache. “Is this Vernon?”
She’ll make a splendid match for Harry, though. I’ve invited them over for tea.
The water was perfect—just the right temperature. Small pink and orange fish darted around their faces, and Harry wanted to see more. He grabbed Draco’s hand, interlacing their fingers, and guided them further out. The beach fell away quickly into a deep underwater trench. They remained near the surface and looked down. Deep down, jellyfish wove in and out in an exotic dance, and vampire squid veered back and forth, making inky trails.
Harry brought his finger to his lips, reddened and kiss-bitten.
The door bursts open. Harry groans and pulls the covers up over his head.
Draco never thought he’d have a use for
“Why are we doing this?” Harry asks, straightening his tie as he frowns at his reflection. He’s been dreading this all day. All week.
Magic isn’t real? After everything he’s put us through, that’s what he had to say?
.’ What does that mean?”
“Yes, Aunt Petunia.”
Draco stared at Potter. He’d carried a torch for him for years but kept it carefully hidden behind Malfoy poise. It was fine. Perhaps not satisfactory, but manageable. However,  knowing what Harry’s skin felt like pressed against his own, knowing what that messy coal-black hair felt like threaded through his fingers, knowing what Harry felt like
He shook his head. “I can’t come back.” He tapped his Dark Mark. “Some things you can’t come back from.”
“Oh, I’m afraid another migraine is setting in.” She sighed and swooned, making a show of how poorly she felt. “Would you be a dear and go find my pills?”
“Harry, think of all the good you could do, the money you could raise. There’s still so much rebuilding to be done.” Her voice was earnest, her eyes pleading.
There was a brief pause, and then Draco dove in. “Listen, I’d like to ask you about the war.”
“Oh,” Harry says, his disappointment obvious.
He grins, smug and overly pleased with himself, but it doesn’t fill me with rage. The only thing I feel is burning desire.
Harry’s not completely sure what he’s doing now that he’s seated at the small, rectangular school desk. He should be working overtime, searching for leads on his cold cases. Or perhaps attacking the mountain of paperwork piled up on his desk at work. It’s not that he’d rather be doing paperwork on the weekend, it’s just that one more inter-departmental memo or form (to be filled out in triplicate) and he risks death by bureaucratic avalanche, which would be both unfortunate and rather anticlimactic given everything else he’s survived. Instead, at 11 am on a Saturday, he’s sitting inside a Muggle community centre.
Harry casts
“Very well.” Draco takes a slow swig of firewhisky, and licks his lips. He makes a show of releasing the glass, reinforcing his magical coaster. Without warning, he dives back in, plunging his tongue in deeply, and it burns so good. Harry pants, grips the chair harder as Draco carries out his ministrations. Squelching sounds fill the room and Harry rests his head on his gloved hands, inhaling the scent of leather and musk.
Harry tried to reach out and touch the keys—brass, bronze, and silver keys—but they were too fast and flew out of reach. But that only increased his determination to catch them. He reached up and his body became weightless. His feet left the ground, and suddenly he was flying too. But he was no longer in the room, and he was flying on a broom with the wind whipping through his hair as he flew across a field. Feeling free, he flew higher and higher, weaving in and around giant hoops, trying to catch a golden, winged walnut. The colours were exceptionally vibrant—a sea of scarlet and viridian, punctuated by blips of marigold and indigo—and there was a crowd cheering him on. Harry could see the sounds their voices made, ripples undulating, swirls of noise that combined and separated and came back together again. He rode high amid the amethyst and magenta sound waves and truly felt like he was home—everything was peaceful, truly peaceful, for the first time in what seemed like ages.
05 May 1998
Draco bit into a prawn and Harry delighted in his blissed-out expression. Harry started with the bruschetta and smiled as the tropical flavours exploded (metaphorically) on his tongue.
“Fine. I’ll just have tea, then.”
But there was one problem: it required a conduit. Something powerful enough to channel and balance Harry’s magic.
“Watch it. You’ll burn yourself.”
“That makes sense.”
But soon a dark shape loomed behind the mermaid, and Harry feared for her safety. He swam towards her but didn’t get far—Draco clasped his ankle tightly. Harry thrashed against his husband as the dark shape rose from the trench. He needed to help her.
“It’s hard to tell. We’ll just have to wait.”
Well, that was it. Vernon stood up to them and we returned to our home, but they insisted on keeping guards stationed outside. Thank the good Lord they remained invisible. What would the neighbours think? Vernon demanded that
“Slow afternoon,” Draco replied.
Harry pulled out a bottle which contained a small quantity of crystal-clear liquid.
Slytherin. All of them are rotten to the core, in my opinion. The man shoves Harry against the wall and I’m about to sound the alarm. But instead of hexing him, he leans in and kisses Harry roughly with great enthusiasm. The kiss is well-received if Harry’s moans are anything to go by. This is proving interesting...
“Well, I got us out safely,” Harry called out to Draco’s retreating form.
“Hermione,” Harry chided, “you know we don’t pay attention to that rag.”
I harrumph as I swing open. It’s the Chosen One sneaking out, which is nothing new. But his companion is. I peer down the dark corridor and watch the man approach from the shadows.
“Young man, you’re confused. Harry’s not here right now. He’s gone to stay with his Aunt Marge. Good day.”
He should have stayed. He should have tried harder to explain.
“What are you doing in my room?”
He started reading his mother’s post again; even considered going back to the Manor, resigned to his fate and future. But it wasn’t what he wanted.
“I love you too.”
She dropped it onto the table, and it fell open to
… only to be replaced by a giant, hairy spider reared up on its hind legs.
“Oh, Harry,” she shouted over the din, her cheeks rosy. “We should do this more often. I feel like a schoolgirl again.”
This memory was Draco’s worst.
After a pause, she rose without speaking and left the room. Draco went to check on Harry, serene within the Stasis Charm, as though asleep.
He’s blond and pale
Harry remains silent. Maybe Malfoy will give up and leave? It worked with the others…
He picked up his journal, empty save for that list he’d written weeks ago. He flipped through the pages. Every page was filled:
“Don’t you want me to?”
“Hermione, what is it?”
Draco exhaled slowly. His anger seeped away, his pulse quickened, and butterflies fluttered in his stomach, as though everything hinged on this interaction. “I meant all of it. Every word.”
. You get out of bed and reach the door in three strides. When you enter the hallway, you freeze. You smell the delicious, spiced scent of holiday baking and hear laughter as it filters up from the kitchen — two voices. You’d know the sound of Scorpius’ laughter anywhere.
Hermione looked at him strangely.
A spider landed on his forehead and scurried across as Draco thrashed and swatted at it.
Draco directed him towards the bed and they both sat.
Vernon wouldn’t stand for it. He marched outside and gave them a good what for. Mrs Next Door must have thought he’d gone mad, yelling at no one. He told them to stop interfering and leave us alone, to get lost and never come back. They got the message this time—it pays to be firm. They Hocus-Pocused their things away, but as they were leaving, something went wrong.
“Are you sure? I don’t want to impose.”
Petunia busied herself stamping out her cigarette. “I can’t talk about this with you right now.” Slowly, she rose. “I need to lie down. You may stay, for now.” When she reached the door, she looked back at Harry and the broken glass in the dustbin.
The conundrum made Draco’s head swirl. He bent down and kissed Harry’s forehead.
“I’m always up for a rematch—
Hermione paled, her lips formed a thin line. “Nothing good.”
Harry feels the colour rising to his cheeks. The room suddenly feels too hot and a bead of sweat rolls down his back.
“It’s the best I’ve ever had,” you say.
Draco glanced at his wardrobe and held out his hand.
The bottom right corner contained a phone number.
Then, with a mischievous grin, he grabbed Draco and flipped him, so he was on the bottom with Harry pinning him down. He ground seductively against Draco, eliciting a whimper.
When she returned, she held two phials. She handed one to Draco.
“I’m so sorry, Hermione. That must be difficult.” Draco took a sip of wine. “If you don’t mind me asking, why did you modify their memories?”
The woman startled. She turned and fixed Harry with a scowl that chilled him to the bone.
Harry concedes his loss with a soft sigh. “What do you want?”
“What is this? You” — she points at Harry —“that’s unacceptable behaviour in my class.”
Draco swallowed. “Better not. What else?”
He thought about lying, but what was the point?
“What you need is rest.” Draco brushed the sweat-slick hair back from Harry’s forehead, and what he saw sent chills down his spine. There was a crack—a lightning bolt—opening like a fissure, the ragged edges red and angry.
. Anything at all. But I can’t.”
“I know for sure because I’ve seen it firsthand. I had to modify my parents’ memories. That’s why they’re not here. They’re in Australia. They’ve both had an MRI which declared them in perfect health. But they think they’re Wendell and Monica Wilkins, and they don’t know they have a daughter. I’ve run diagnostics on them—all the magical ones—and although I can clearly see the memory block, I haven’t been able to reverse it. Yet.” She pursed her lips in a grimace.
Harry nodded.
“Please,” Harry croaks.
The words were out of his mouth before Draco could even hope to hold them back. There was a brief moment of panic in which Draco worried he’d said too much, revealed the deepest secrets of his heart too soon. But Harry pulled him tighter and said, “Draco, I love you too.”
him… it was too much. It was everything he’d ever wanted. And now it was over.
Second, he used to be camera-shy. That’s why he wasn’t in any of the family photos. He didn’t feel like someone afraid of cameras, but it was nice of the Dursleys to consider his feelings. He felt all right now, so Petunia had taken him to a photography studio, and they had their portrait done. She’d gotten it framed and it now joined the others on the mantelpiece.
The words popped into Harry’s head, along with a flash of anger that rippled through his gut. His cheeks burned with shame. Where had that thought come from? Why would he think such a thing?
Draco vanished the broken glass and water on the floor as he walked to his school trunk. Once unlocked, he rifled through the contents until he found what he was looking for. He placed the bezoar in Harry’s mouth and massaged his throat until he swallowed it down.
Draco chuckled, glad to see Harry was still himself. He looked deeply into verdant eyes, so bright, so beautiful, his attention only wavering to appreciate Harry’s dimple as it popped. Draco’s heart fluttered.
Draco sighs. “I wish that weren’t true. But my father doesn’t make the decisions anymore. Given his past record, Mother decides everything, as you know, and she is fond of you. Of us. Let’s not keep her waiting.” He folds Harry’s arms inward and pushes him into the fireplace, grabs a pinch of powder, and calls out, “Malfoy Manor, kitchen.”
