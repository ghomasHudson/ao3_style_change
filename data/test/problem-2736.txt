Draco casts some seeking spells, looking for wards that might ping if they start putting up surveillance spells in the building across the street. Draco snorts in disbelief. There’s nothing protecting the building.
Harry’s hand shakes a little as he removes his shirt and glasses but it’s steady when he reaches over Draco’s head and turns the shower back on. “I’m going to wash your hair first.”
Harry comes back with two tea cups and saucers with a pizzelle next to Draco’s saucer. He hands one cup to Draco and Draco takes a sip. It has the perfect amount of milk and just a touch of sugar, exactly how Draco likes it.
Potter flushes, his cheeks darkening to a deep red brown that Draco finds fascinating. “Merlin, that’s not what I meant.”
This one is the opposite of the first. Harry presses into the seam of Draco’s mouth, tasting him and sucking in Draco’s bottom lip. Draco makes a noise in the back of his throat that undoes Harry, and Harry wraps his free hand around Draco’s thigh, sliding his hand up firmly. Draco’s hands are all over Harry, leaving burning and desire in their wake. Harry trails open mouthed kisses over Draco’s neck and Draco tips his head to give Harry more access.
Harry nods, his eyes holding Draco’s gaze. There are so many things he could say. “You deserve to know that someone cares about you, that you are worthy of affection, that you deserve to be loved.”
Harry turned around sharply at Draco’s smug tone. Ah, he really still hasn’t changed that much then, Draco thought. “What do you think you know about me, Malfoy? Stop acting like you are the godforsaken Merlin! Why don’t you just go back into whatever hole you slithered out of?”
A roar of applause from the crowds rang through the air and the game began. Merlin, he’d missed the feel of the wind rushing into his face and the hollering of the rowdy crowd. Maybe this time they weren’t screaming his name but it was still an exhilarating feeling. He decided to watch Potter and follow him around, knowing that the Snitch would be easily found if he did that.
The once spotless handkerchief was on the floor, soaked in red and Malfoy was gripping the sink so tightly his knuckles were white and his knees were shaking. Malfoy whipped around and rasped out a “Get away from me Potter!” but he was unable to utter out another sentence before collapsing to the ground in another fit of coughs.
Draco nodded and the pair ran off, sneaking behind columns and statues when students and professors walked by, trying to keep in their giggles. It made Harry feel just a little more relaxed and it was terribly fun. It reminded him of his First Year when things were calmer and his destiny was less pressuring and heavy on his shoulders. Thankfully, he didn’t have a quest to complete now and all he had to do was just attain happiness. Attain a feeling of fulfilment and strangely, Draco Malfoy filled in that gap for him. He made him feel fulfilled.
Harry felt something in him snap at Ron’s sudden accusation. Why was everyone assuming Malfoy did something to him? The boy hadn’t done anything but play in his team and get hit by a Bludger.
“What brings you here, Potter? Stalking me again?”
He took a breather first, sitting down and using a stick to draw shapes in the mud. He was reminded of an argument he had with Sirius while he was still alive.
. For Merlin’s sake, the brat was just chopping up leaves.
Draco smiled, “No thanks. I’ll take my food to my room now. Thanks for the help.”
Accusations were being flung at Draco and Harry was getting tired of it. Couldn’t they see that he wasn’t hurt and it was Draco who was injured? It was the stupid prejudice getting to their heads. He couldn’t stand it anymore.
He sat down in the back of the room, with potted plants hanging over his desk whose vines cast gnarled shadows over his desk. At least no one would notice him here.
“Harry? Is that you? It’s been so long!” Hermione squealed, jumping up to throw her arms around him. Ron was more collected and stuck his hand out for a more formal approach.
“Boys!” Madam Pomfrey interrupted, “Stop fighting! Now, go and seek out a professor and come back when you can tell me what happened.”
He happened to be early for all of his classes again, sitting alone until some student sat next to him, gleefully exclaiming that they were seated with the Saviour of the Wizarding World. He gave them a customary smile, ignoring them for most of the time. They didn’t seem to mind, always chatting away even though Harry didn’t respond.
“I should have taken you to Mungo’s.”
Harry smiles, wide and brilliant at Draco and says, “I’m glad because I’m really tired of having unrequited feelings for you, you prat.”
Potter chuckles and leans back away from Draco. “You’re such a prat, Malfoy.”
Gatty looks to Potter, who nods encouragingly at him again. “Yes, sir. Margot told Gatty she had escaped from some people holding her and knew the people that had captured her and was afraid they would find her here.”
Monday dawns cloudy. The moment Draco leaves his flat, the skies open up their maw and let forth a torrent of rain. With a curse, Malfoy Apparates to somewhere closer to the Ministry. He dries himself with a quick charm once he’s inside, but his hair, which was perfectly brushed before, is less tidy than he likes. With a sigh, Draco pulls it back into an untidy bun.
“Malfoy, are you all right?”
The smile on the clerk falters, but they look down at a slip of paper by the register. “Rueben with a cider. Mr. Draco Malfoy. Long blonde hair and probably not smiling.” They look up, brown eyes shining with mirth. “You’re the right chap, right?”
Harry slips off of Draco’s cock and looks up at the other man with a satisfied grin.
The shower room is steamy and damp. The doors to all the shower rooms are open except for the last one. The showers were made so that you could close up each individual shower, run the water on hot and have a sauna instead of a shower if needed.
Draco smiles at Potter and the other man relaxes. “I know and I love hearing you admit it.”
Harry takes Draco’s cock in his hand and gives the other man a gentle squeeze. Draco does twitch then, a sigh escaping from between his lips.
Potter straightens at his tone, frowning. “Keep your holier than thou tendencies in check, Malfoy. Gatty is a free-elf and he uses his house as a halfway house for magical beings that need a place to stay while they get back on their feet. I’ll not have you insult him with your snobbishness.”
Draco intends for the kiss to be soft, a question of what could come next, but Potter’s hand slides around his neck and threads through his hair. Potter gets a fistful of the long strands and pulls gently. The tug of it goes straight to Draco’s cock and he groans. The moment his mouth opens Potter plunges in, and from there nothing is gentle about the kiss. It’s filthy, open mouths and years of hidden fantasies that Draco has never let see the light of day.
“That’s what partners are for.” Draco doesn’t know what hurts worse, the loss of contact with Potter or the burning in his side. He breathes through the pain of both and schools his facial features.
“I’m sorry.” The words escape Harry before he knows they are leaving his lips.
The wound isn’t bleeding much, a small drip on the tiles below Draco’s side, but the reopened scar is rough and there is already bruising along the edges. Harry knows that some curses cause damage deep in the tissue and, from the pain Draco is in, Harry thinks this curse is still slicing it’s way, slowly. It will keep doing so until the wound is closed. Harry lifts Draco’s arm with his left hand, fingers threading through Draco’s.

Harry gritted his teeth and continued to glare at the feret as though hoping it would peirce a hole through his head.

Blaise sneered, grabbing his by his arm hard enough to bruise. “We stay here and The Third Eye will kill them all.”
"Oh god...I-I'm sorry...I-I...Malfoy I'm-..i did..n't...mean t-to..I-please..I-I," he mumbled. Harry felt disgusted, scared. Guilty. Of himself. This is what he'd done. What he'd become. He'd turned void again and this time he..he almost
Blaise made sure to remind him that every now and then, just to quiet his want to meet others. He knew better now, and wanted nothing more than to leave, even if that meant killing the boy in front of him. And if blaming Blaise for that made it easier, than so be it. It wasn’t as though Blaise would ever know.
Blaise wants to laugh at the irony of it all. Getting killed didn’t sound so bad, but he supposed he could hold on for a little while longer. Maybe Draco could be right. Maybe they’ll escape...find way out the walls.
Blaise was saying something...he couldn’t hear. The noises had dulled down in the background, his ears now filled with a light buzz. Exhaustion swept through every cell in his body, and cold sweat dripped down his back.
He throws his hands up on frustration.
"Where do you think you are going, mister?"
"Don't bother lying. I know you were out after curfew yesterday! It only makes sense!"
A cup of water was immediately pressed to his lips, and he drank it eagerly. The water ran down his throat and he swore he could've purred in the bliss of it. How long had it been since he'd drank water?
first? Okay?" Potter asked warily, as though talking to a child.
’ the voice came, nagging at him like his father would.
He stuffed a couple bars in his bag, along with a couple of bottles of water. Mouth watering, he made a grab for the peanut butter. He could already imagine it. The sweet greasy pile of fat, and protein, melting onto the tip of his tongue.
"P-please be ok.."
Madame Pomfrey who seemingly noticed turned to Harry and smiled. "I must thank you, Harry. You did a great job on keeping Draco calmed and controlled. I was right to leave you incharge."
Nothing had even happened! Nothing to cause such an intense reaction from the blonde.
He'd asked for water which he'd been refused. The reason? Water components might mix in with the potion causing the effects to change and so he waited. Madame Pomfrey was long gone, amd the only person next to him was Potter.
“Wait here,” Potter said, more of an order than a request. Draco almost let out a small whine as the warmth left his skin. He did, however, let out another broken sob as the tall raven exited the room.
Potter.
"What do you mean, Malfoy?"
"B-but-"
“I know you don’t like Malfoy, but that is no excuse!
The thought terrified him more than the unfortunate. He welcomes the tingling sensation, the suffocation slowly settling into his bones, becoming one with his body. It’d only be moments until he became used to it; every breath filling his lungs with poison. Until then he waits. Lays down on this short lived luxury, closes his eyes, holds his makeshift weapon tight in the grip of his palm and waits, feigning sleep. The clock ticking down to his ultimate end with every passing second.
Everyone loves cake, no matter what it is put with.
” She sneers the last part, anger pulsing through her veins. She pushes himself up from his seat, and makes his way towards the duo, eyes burning with fire. “Not that it’s going to help them much.”

He tried again and again, still with no success. He felt his struggles get weaker and his arms trembling. Curse his arm strength. Time to resort back to words. It seemed to be the only weapon he got, and if he reached for his wand Potter would have caught him in no time. Quidditch reflexes.
house!"
blame me for thinking that way.” Potter snapped back, running another calloused hand through his dark strands.
"But..," She continued and Draco slumped back into the couch.
It seemed that Potter had finally returned to finish the job. To end him once and for all. Maybe the raven finally found out about his secret, or maybe it was all out of pure spite. Could someone really hate him that much? To the point where they want to kill him?
Harry stormed out from his room, blood boiling with irritation. Why did Malfoy have to be so...so
He didn’t have to look far. They were kept in the room at the end of the hall, at the corner of the room, covered up lousy with a blanket. Draco allowed himself to grin in satisfaction. He quickly moved to the pile, and removed the blanket.

. A soft hand closed weakly around his wrist and he turned his head around only to see the frail body on the bed looking painfully up at him with wet, drowsy eyes.
When Harry had first come to the Weasley house, he had been thin, frail, and weak. You could even see his ribs. She shuddered at the thought.
Draco sighed, risking a small look to his stomach. Big mistake. Black ick oozed out from the gaping hole, sputtering out in ugly clumps of red. He could feel the bile starting to force its way back up his throat, but swallowed it down, hoping it would stay down. No wonder, Potter sounded worried. An injury this bad, could make anyone revolt, and give a small hint of pity...or worry. He couldn’t really tell the difference anymore.
Draco grimaced inwardly. He didn't even know if the 'safe place' would even take them in. Wait not them. Not him. But they would definetely take Lilly! She's a small girl. They'd take her for sure!
Potter furrowed his eyebrows. "Call you what?"

Harry's magic faltered for a moment. Hesitation? Harry didn't...hesitate? No.
-----------------------------------------
“It’s my turn to ask questions, Potter!”
He tries the door next, snarling when it didn’t budge open. The silence thunders, warning Draco of what was to come. Each passing second, ticking away like a time-bomb, and he waits. Waits for someone to come around the corner to attack him from behind or for someone to open the door before him.

Molly snapped out of her daze and nodded frantically. She grabbed the child from his arms and quickly ran inside and wrapped the small body in the blanket that was discarded on the couch. before rushing back to the door. The sights before her shocks her.
His other hand wavered close to the cuffs of his torn jeans. Draco sucked shit at hand to hand combat, and the raven would probably overpower him in seconds, but that didn’t mean that Draco was going to make it easy. The least he could do was give Blaise some time to escape.
“Draco...stop this nonsense at once!” his father bellows from beneath the mask.
Harry sighed. “I know...I know...I just can’t deal with
Draco is working late on the next Tuesday, pouring over the papers Granger gave him and the interviews he did today. His notes are spread out over his desk as he looks for a pattern or something he’s missed. He’s standing, hoping the height gives him a vantage that sitting did not. There’s a noise in his doorway and Draco looks up.
Harry begins the knitting spell. Draco’s body tenses and he sucks in a breath, fingers clutching painfully to Harry. Harry is careful, knows that a badly knitted wound can be worse than having it fixed at all.
“Merlin, you’re gorgeous.” Draco puts his hands over Harry’s knees and slides up his legs with firm pressure. When his face is right over Harry’s cock, he takes the head in his mouth and enjoys the salty taste of Harry before he looks up and says, “I hope you know that after this, I’m never letting you go either. I have a lot of things I’d like to do with you and not all of them are dirty. I like quiet Saturday mornings with tea and books.”
It doesn’t occur to Harry to wonder how Draco knows he has a question on the tip of his tongue. They’ve spent too much time together. They know each other so well that these past two years have increasingly been torture.
After staring blankly for an hour at the interview he conducted with Marjorie before she was killed, Draco gets up, stretches, and goes to make tea. He’s not paying attention as he carries it back to his desk and runs straight into Potter. The tea manages to miss Potter completely and spills all down the front of Draco’s shirt and vest. He hisses in pain as the hot liquid seeps through his clothes and scalds his skin.
Harry clears his throat. “I, uh, know you like meat pies when you work late and I know you have a penchant for Rueben’s on Thursdays.” Harry’s eyes sweep down at the end.
Two hours later, Draco is still standing in the same spot, staring at the same papers, when a message comes flying into his office. He snatches it out of the air and unfolds the crane.
“Wasn’t much talking,” Harry mutters.
Draco’s face heats and he drains the last bit of his pint. The words are too close to the truth and he’s embarrassed. Potter is watching the exchange, silent, and an unwanted desire for Potter to be jealous, of all things, rears its ugly head. Draco crushes the need he feels and stands.
“Will you go out with me, on a proper date?” Harry asks, a sliver of fear pricking him.
The noises Draco is making go straight to Harry’s own aching cock. If he lasts through this, it will be a miracle. Harry moves with strong, slow strokes, adding his hand to his mouth to give Draco more pressure. Draco squirms beneath him and lifts one leg so that his heel is resting on the tiled bench. It gives Draco more leverage to thrust up into Harry’s mouth. Harry smiles around the cock in his mouth and picks up the pace, knowing neither one of them is going to last much longer.
“Fuck, Malfoy, don’t get all rigid on me.” Potter runs a hand through his hair, making the curls stand up every which way. “Sometimes you have a haughtiness about you that can be off-putting, but I can tell you tried to be more relaxed with him is all.”
Potter starts laughing next to him and Weasley snorts. Draco’s mouth turns up and everything loosens in his chest with the realization that this group of people somehow are his friends or something like it. He swallows down emotions along with the last of his pint.
The day does turn out to be better. Draco finds an acquaintance of the werewolf who was killed and they lead him to an address that he cases from across the street. Draco pens a quick note to headquarters, requesting some backup if things go sideways. He hesitates, then requests Potter specifically. Draco does not examine his motivations too closely. Potter is the best at tight spots if there is trouble, he’s excellent at surveillance charms, and Draco does enjoy his company. More than he should, but that is exactly beyond the point at the moment. Right now, he needs Potter for work and nothing else.
Later that night, Draco shakes off the day as he enters the pub. It’s a small place, wix owned in the heart of London, with dim lighting, a roaring fire, and booths lining the wall. Potter sees him enter and waves him over with a grin. He elbows Weasley, making Weasley and Longbottom shift over until there’s room for Draco next to Potter. Hermione and Luna have their heads together, talking and ignoring the men.
Draco nods and puts down his tea. “There have been some werewolves disappearing from the London area. I believe it is an underground organization that has some larger plan in mind. Auror Potter said you had some information that may be helpful to me.”
Draco smirks and stands, hauling Harry to his feet. “I do, actually.” Draco grabs the waist of Harry’s trousers and pulls them down. Harry steps out of his trousers, keeping his eyes on Draco. Harry can’t resist pulling Draco to him, their naked bodies flush and pressing into each other greedily. Harry licks into Draco’s mouth.
The curse didn’t just open up one of his old Sectumsempra scars, it’s split the skin along the scar line. The wound isn’t bleeding anymore, but it burns and the scar tissue is raw and angry. A bruise is creeping along his side and Draco leans against the wall to catch his breath. He’s had worse injuries—his job is dangerous—but these scars hold so much memory and pain that the weight of them seems to be pressing into him more than the pain of the curse that caught him this morning.
"How have you messed with it?" he asked, only somewhat joking.
As the holidays approached, Professor McGonagall had informed the seventh and eighth years that she would be conducting a "Mid-Year Review." This morning, memos only with their appointment times had been distributed.
“It’s charming, dear,” cooed the mirror fondly.
Ginny blinked and said coolly, “At least Basil’s not a fucking
This suited Harry fine. He had enough to mull over: Malfoy and his new feral pet.
"Don't get your knickers all wound up,” replied Harry, though he picked up the pipette.
“I mean…” said Malfoy. He looked contemplative. “It’s about how much men are responsible for their own actions.”
“Wait, Potter,” said Malfoy, focused somewhere above Harry’s head, “...thanks.”
"Your father dying and whatever's wrong with your mother—that justifies
Soon they got to work chopping, peeling, and crushing.
Harry bit his lip.

," said Hermione. She sounded as if the paper had personally slighted her.
The sight of a scampering cat shouldn't have been anything out of the ordinary. However, in the past few years, Crookshanks had turned into what Harry thought might be the laziest, fattest cat in existence. He barely lifted a paw to swat a fly, much less chase after what must've been a rodent.
,” groaned a familiar voice. “It’s the middle of the day!”
Harry’s head was whirling. He stood and shoved his essay, quill, and textbook into his bag, then crossed the room to the door. He had a last glimpse of Malfoy: hands behind his head, staring at the ceiling, an inscrutable expression on his face. Then Harry closed the door.
"No.”
Malfoy’s eyes flashed. Red crept up his neck. “
“Ready?” asked Harry.
Malfoy shrugged, nonchalant.
“Down to the dungeons you go,” she said. There was an edge to her voice where there hadn’t been before.
Malfoy held Harry’s gaze. “So…” he said, “that’s it.”
Malfoy's brow furrowed. "Do what? Did you
"Ooooo, ickle firsties…" cooed Peeves. "I've got some wee presents for you!”
When he arrived, he found the same stone gargoyles looming overhead with twin menacing grins.
"Posh mail," he remarked.
"Smart touch, that copper is," she nodded. "Potter, you shouldn't have much trouble with this. As I recall, last time you simply switched the order of the powdered petrified eggs and the aloe."
“Nimbus 3004,” said Malfoy at the look of grudging appreciation on Harry’s face. “Their newest model. Of course, it’s no Firebolt.”
He was bluffing, of course, but he doubted Malfoy knew that.
“Tut, tut, Harry. No homework today?”
“Draco,” he said.
He turned back to the doorway, but it was empty.
Harry didn’t want Ron to see it. He didn’t want anyone to see it. But he couldn’t very well tell his friends that.
Harry couldn't hear another word. He couldn't look at his face, at his mouth, at
After dinner, he turned down Hermione's usual offer of the library. Instead, he walked alone to the Quidditch pitch. The air was cold and crisp. Strangely, it had yet to snow.
They'd been working in silence for nearly an hour, but while Harry rooted through the cupboards, Malfoy said suddenly, gaze fixed above Harry's head:
Harry shrugged again. “Ginny can do whatever she wants. I told you, we’re not together anymore.”
Harry flushed. Something dark shone in Malfoy's expression. It made Harry uneasy. He snatched the card back, shoving it into the recesses of his bag.
"Did she?" said Hagrid, looking impressed.
His bag slid off his shoulder and

This is the new Chapter 7 which has shifted the old Chapters 7 & 8 to Chapters 8 & 9. Hope that makes sense.
It was as if Draco Malfoy had two different personalities: one that existed to torture Harry, and one that just...existed. This Malfoy mouthed words while he was reading them, impatiently pushing hair from his face while bending too close to parchment. Quietly, Harry noticed he tended to stare at the ceiling, worrying his bottom lip with his teeth while contemplating something. On occasion, he'd flare up, provocation ready on his tongue—but it would quickly blow over with only a snide quip or withering glance.
And with that, the ghost drifted through the ceiling and disappeared.
successfully since Saturday night. But now it nagged at him like an itchy spot.
"From you, Weasley?" Malfoy raised an eyebrow. “You wouldn’t have anything left.”
"Oh Harry, you should've seen your face!" she giggled at last. "I didn't read the rubbish, of course, but the girls have it posted all around the dormitory."
It was bewildering to experience not one, but two expressions of Malfoy's kindness within the hour. It must have shown on Harry's face, because then Malfoy said, with a shifting, grim look, "The Carrows were the worst, after Him. Murderous animals."
“I’m—fine,” ground out Malfoy. “

A tense silence followed this outburst.
It hadn’t exactly felt wrong, either.

His hand had been so warm. Harry flushed gently. His fingertips tingled.
happening?"
And then there was the issue of last night. Harry had been furious. His mind had been invaded, and that memory…of him and Ginny…
He waited.
“How was detention?” Hermione asked on their way to breakfast the following morning.
Harry found his seat. Homeworks were being passed to the front of the room. He busied himself by making a show of opening his textbook and examining its contents. Determined to avoid Splog’s eye, he didn’t notice until too late that Draco Malfoy had taken the seat just to the right of him.
It was just in time—Peeves swooped around the corner, singing raucously:
“No,” said Harry, disappearing under it. He headed for the door.
He added softly, “I’m sure it is.”
you bring that in with you?”
It was a different sort of stress, thought Harry, a low, creeping one that festered unpleasantly.
Harry turned. Ginny was glaring at the Fat Lady.
Malfoy had a strange fascination with an illegal wild kneazle—and that was the least of it. For the past five weeks, Malfoy had been secretly meeting Harry after hours to duel. Even worse, Malfoy dueled with a wand that the Ministry didn’t even know existed. For all they knew, Malfoy was using his mother’s wand. Well, he was—for turning teacups into rats and making clothes fold themselves. Not for
For a moment, Harry’s heart stopped. A flame leapt to his face. Surreptitiously, he glanced up. Around the Hall, students scrambled onto their tables to avoid the exploding Detonators.

Cackling madly, he rained a flurry of exploding crackers upon their heads. For good measure, he pelted them with what looked like Decoy Detonators.
“Right,” he said. He couldn’t help but feel a little guilty, especially when Ron had ink all over his face.
"Mother," Malfoy repeated, almost plaintively. The sound was foreign to Harry's ears. "You have to eat

Ginny seemed to take this at face value. "When will you be?" she asked. "Ready, that is."

“What’s up?” said Harry.
“Why?”

“Been reading my biographies, have you, Malfoy?” managed Harry, wincing.
And she's a nasty one."

It was the exact question Harry had been dreading, probably because he didn't yet know the answer himself.
A gentle puff of air, like a gasp—a hot exhale—and then long fingers ghosted across Harry’s stinging cheekbone.
“I don’t think that’s true.”
Bewildered, Harry stared at the strange fruit, tiny and orange.
"Tell me what you want, Gin," he said.
Malfoy opened his mouth to reply, then closed it soundlessly, like a stupid-looking fish.
Red patches appeared on his freckled face as he read it.
Unexpectedly, Malfoy stirred.
He said slowly, as if speaking to an idiot, "Did you ever think, Malfoy, that you could just…
Pince jabbed her bell with a claw-like finger.

Harry stared down at his textbook:

"But now that you bring it up..." drawled Malfoy, “it
Malfoy glanced back at him. For a moment, Harry thought he seemed worried.
“Fine,” he said, trying to be conciliatory, “tell me something then. How did you, someone who—and don’t get offended, Potter, I’m only being realistic here—is utterly mediocre in every way, end up defeating the Dark Lord?”
When he returned, Boughbranch was examining a file instead of retreating to her office like she usually did. Harry thought he knew the reason why.
After what felt like hours, the bell rang. Finally, Harry left the classroom with Ron and Hermione.
“What’s that on your hand?
"What we need, Potter,” he said, a thoughtful expression on his face, “is some

When they arrived, they found Peeves crouching on the flagstones above the Great Hall’s entrance. He stuck his tongue out at them as they entered.
“It really is an unusual situation you’re in,” said McGonagall. Her dark eyes were kind. “Entering adulthood with experiences that no child should have to face, yet still dealing with the confines of your age. But I suppose that rings true for so many of my students now...” she trailed off.
. Harry hadn’t even told Hermione and Ron yet—at the thought of their faces, he felt a sudden plummeting in his gut, like being dropped from an elevator shaft.
With effort, Harry tore his eyes away. “Shut up,” he said cleverly.
He didn't care to.
Again, Harry jerked away, breathing unsteadily. He had to. But Malfoy was merciless. He tugged at the stinging hairs on the nape of Harry’s neck, and, wordlessly, Harry obeyed, baring the column of his throat.
Harry dropped his bag to the floor. He unsheathed his wand. Wordlessly, Malfoy did the same.
Harry frowned at his book. "It doesn't say that anywhere."
"Her forgiveness would only be a gift to grant to herself. I bid never for't."
Just like that, the deed was done. Now there'd be nothing that connected him to Malfoy (once their regular torture sessions in the dungeons finished). Harry's fury had become indifference: Malfoy was done. With luck, Harry would be rid of him at last.
As they watched Hagrid lumber away, leaving giant boot prints in the snow, Harry couldn’t help but feel guilty.
"What?" snorted Ron. "
Harry raised an eyebrow.
Harry’s gut twisted. Feeling the need to do something with his hands, he ran his fingers through his hair.
He doesn’t remember and he has to force himself to swallow past that knowledge.
Draco pulls back. “I have some ideas, some ways we could fill the time, if you will come home with me.”
Harry lifts a hand and traces a finger along Draco’s hairline. “You’re amazing.”
Draco puts one hand on his wand tucked inside his fitted Auror’s cloak and reaches out with the other hand to open the door slowly, knowing Potter’s wand is out and he’s checking to see if the shop is warded.
Potter smirks at him. “Gatty.”
Potter’s smile breaks over his face and Draco’s heart shifts a little, something he pointedly ignores. “Brilliant. See you then.”
Potter nods, seemingly unaffected by Draco’s touch even though Draco feels like his entire hand and arm are being licked by Friendfyre. “Pints tonight?”
Draco takes out his wand and nods to the right. Potter nods and goes left. Draco’s boots are well worn leather and make no sounds as he creeps along the perimeter of the shop. Potter meets up with him by a door along the back wall that says
Draco takes the direct floo from the Ministry to Mungo’s and rushes to the fifth floor. He’s directed to the correct room by a solemn faced wizard behind a massive desk right off the lift. Draco walks as quickly as decorum allows and almost runs into the healer, a thin, tight-lipped woman.
“Yes, sir.” Draco stands.
Draco nods. The runner shoves a plain brown paper bag at him. “This is yours, sir.”
Draco and Potter rise to leave. Gatty pushes a bundle into Potter’s hand. “Some biscuits for the road.”
. They share a look, nod, and Draco opens the door quickly and sweeps inside.
Harry raises his eyebrows at Draco. “So you think because I have a soft spot for you, you can order me about.”
Draco can’t help but smile back. “It’s a good thing you ducked quickly.”
The door opens and reveals an old house-elf. “Auror Potter. Nice to see you again.”
“Seems clear,” Potter’s voice is low and reaches Draco’s ears as he pushes into the front room of the shop.
Draco takes care of the arrangements for Margorie’s remains. She’s to be cremated and sent to Draco, who thinks he can spread them on the grounds at Malfoy Manor. It has some pretty parks that would be a nice resting place for a forgotten woman. When his business at Mungo’s is finished, Draco goes back to the Ministry and sits at his desk.
Draco glares at Harry and pulls down on the edges of his vest. “Yes, well, Harry and I realized we have some mutual feelings for each other and also we solved the case.”
Draco’s hand moves from around Potter’s waist and cups his arse, grinding their bodies together. The movement drags a gasp from Potter as their hard, trouser covered cocks rub together with enough friction to be maddening.
Potter puts a hand on his hip and leans into Draco’s space, and Draco forgets what they’re discussing. “I meant that you’re always so aloof and put together. Some witnesses and resources find you intimidating.”
“Turn around slowly. This doesn’t have to get messy.” Potter’s wand is pointed at the witch with a steady hand.
Potter looks up and his dark brows drop down. “I say, Malfoy, you look a little pale. Are you sure you don’t want me to take a look at…”
On the paper, there is an address that Draco knows is a Muggle PO Box at a local mail center. “Thank you, Gatty. This is extremely helpful.”
Potter shifts his weight from one foot to the other as they stand. “Drinks tonight, yeah?”
Draco nods, mouth dry and his nervousness blooming a warmth over his face. By the time they are in the room itself, Draco is taking off his cloak and hanging it on the hook behind the door. He lets go of Harry’s hand to unclasp the other man’s cloak. Draco kisses Harry’s cheek as he swirls the fabric off his shoulders before hanging it up over his own. Draco turns around and stares at Harry.
“Thanks for covering my back.” Potter’s hand squeezes Draco’s arm before he releases it, and Draco wants to weep at the loss.
Draco takes a step that takes him directly into Potter’s personal space. “Thank you for coming when I asked for you.” His voice sounds breathless, even to his own ears.
“I want to wrap my mouth around you and suck you until you come. Can I do that?” Harry is breathless by the time he gets to the end of his question.
Potter plops down in a wingback chair. He manages to look comfortable and on alert at the same time. It’s a skill that Potter uses often. Draco has no idea how he does it.
Harry can see the moment Draco realizes what he’s said, sees the tightness that appears around Draco’s mouth and eyes as the other man starts to pull away.
“Please wait while the transfer comes.”
“Yes, sir. It’ll be right out.” The clerk is already looking over Draco’s shoulder.
Draco levers himself down so that he’s laying on his side by Harry.
“It’s been lovely, as always. Granger, Weasley, Potter.” Draco inclines his head to each of them and leaves without glancing behind him.
The smell of lavender and citrus fills the humid space as Harry rubs the shampoo between his hands, then he reaches out to Draco’s scalp. Harry massages Draco’s head, and Draco leans into his touch. When Harry gets down to Draco’s neck, he massages the muscles there and a moan escapes Draco that goes straight to Harry’s cock. He had done so well, up until this point, trying to keep a level of separation between his desires and what he was doing, but the noises Draco is making cleave through Harry.
Draco’s spine straightens further. “Now look here, Potter. That’s not what I meant. You could’ve just told me all of that in the first place.”
“Draco.” On Potter’s lips, his name is torn from him, a plea and a confession. Draco’s heart shatters open.
Weasley starts cackling. “You have a secret admirer.”
Potter’s dark skin flushes and he stammers. “I’m sorry, Malfoy. Let me help you.”
Draco nods. “I’ll be there.”
“For what?”
“I have a haughtiness that can be off-putting?” Draco’s lips curl up as Potter becomes more uncomfortable. He’s not actually upset by Potter’s words - the man is correct - but Draco is relishing the way he is making Potter fidget.
Harry finishes up the paperwork. It’s not much for an operation this small, but he does have to add an extra bit at the end since Malfoy was wounded. Harry pauses in his writing, a small twist of worry over his partner threading through him.
“Merlin, yes.” Potter manages to say before Draco slowly presses their lips together.
Harry can’t look away from Draco. He nods.
Granger’s eyes are glittering. “This will also give us some sympathy and evidence for me to push through the legislation. Excellent work.”
“Malfoy,” Draco supplies.
Harry picks up the narrative and Draco can’t help but follow the movement of Harry’s lips. He doesn’t even have to hide what he’s doing and that knowledge alone is thrilling. “They’re moving the ones they have tonight at midnight. If we take a team at 11, we should be able to capture all of them.”
Draco pops another one into his mouth. “I found them on my desk this morning.” Draco continues to watch Potter for something, he’s not sure what.
Harry’s heart stutters with the look on Draco’s face and Harry tries not to over think what he does next.
“Perhaps you should get it checked out.” Potter is sitting close to him, angled towards Draco with their knees touching, and Draco presses his knee to Potter’s. Potter’s eyes are bright in the harsh light of the waiting area and full of concern. Draco blinks and looks away from them, afraid to reveal the wave of longing rising in him.
The skin on Draco’s chest feels stretched too thin and it throbs. “No, I'm not bloody well all right. I think the tea burned me.”
The war is seven years gone and he’s developed a friendship of sorts with Potter, if you define friendship as someone you occasionally share sarcastic barbs with over a pint. Draco is loath to admit that he enjoys his weekly trips to the pub down the street from the Ministry with the Golden Trio and whoever else shows up. Other people always show up when those three are together. They’re like magnets because people find them relatable - something Draco’s been told he lacks. Underneath his relationship with Potter, Weasley, and Granger is an underlying tension because Draco still has something to prove. Some days he thinks he’s going to spend his entire life spackling over the mistakes of his youth and the sins of his family.
Harry’s grin is bright enough to burn, but Draco relishes the heat. “Not that I want to have a whole conversation right this moment, but this isn’t a one time thing for me.”
He’s no better than Potter. He’s been keeping a secret and he’s been refusing to admit it as well. Someone out in the world cares enough about Draco to send him pies and candy, to pay for his lunch, and to write him letters that brighten his day. If one person could feel those things for him, perhaps Potter could as well.
Draco checks to make sure his wand is in the holster on his thigh and grabs his crimson Auror robe. “I’m ready now.”
Draco explores all the leads he has with his case and on Thursday he’s pacing his office in the morning trying to decide who he can interview for information he may have missed. He sees Potter approaching his office and slows his feet, grabbing the back of his chair.
The letter taunts him as he makes tea and he eyes it while he sips the cup dry. He does not recognize the handwriting that has scrawled his name and address on the outside. Relishing the pique of the day, he rinses out his cup and pours a whiskey before opening the letter. The words are nothing short of astonishing.
“Shall we go now?” He asked, filling in the empty silence.
Even though his best friends were seated right across from him, Harry felt more alone than he ever had. He’d expected the feeling of emptiness in his chest that he had grown accustomed to in the last few months to at least fade slightly in the presence of Ron and Hermione.  Distantly, Harry’s thoughts wandered to Malfoy who was currently alone in that carriage as well. It was horrid, he mused, what war did to some people.
“It’s not like the bastard’s actually dead or anything. Regardless of whatever condition he’s in, he had it coming for whatever he was planning to do to you! You owe him nothing,” Ron added, glancing down at Malfoy with a disgusted expression.
The sound of a door slamming open caused him to jump and he looked in the mirror to see who had come in. Just his luck, it was none other than Potter. The situation felt like an obvious set-up and shivers ran down Draco’s spine as he recalled what happened the last time he and Potter had run into each other in the bathroom. The scars from that encounter throbbed in phantom pains as he straightened and turned to face the other boy.
The elf nodded, bowing again and Apparated with another pop, leaving Draco feeling a little lonelier than he did before. Don’t, he scolded himself, don’t get too attached to elves, you know what happened to Dobby. Sad memories of his old friend flooded his mind and he waved them away, he needed to focus on today’s match and show everyone he still had skills.
“We’re halfway through the match and it’s neck to neck, both teams are on one hundred points! Who will find the Snitch first? The daring devil Harry Potter or the valiant knight Draco Malfoy?”
Draco swayed on his feet as he walked down the hallways of Hogwarts, trying to steady himself on the way to class. His head was pounding and it felt like a needle was being shoved into the middle of his head. He didn’t want to miss any classes, especially since it was literally his first week back in school. You have to attend your classes, score well and graduate, he told himself, or else you’ll be sent back to St Mungo’s. Besides, he didn’t want to draw any more unnecessary attention to himself by skipping lessons.
“It seems like she had you.” The healer pats his arm. “Thank you, Auror Malfoy.”
Draco takes another sip and eyes Harry, who is watching him a little intently. “How do you know how I take my tea?”
Draco swallows and pulls Harry under the water with him. “You deserve to be happy too, you know.”
Draco nods, the corners of his lips turning up. “I like it when you say my name, Harry.”
Harry’s pupils are wide and his voice scratches out of his throat. “Yes, please, Draco. I want your mouth on me.”
Harry slows his descent as his lips touch the top of the first scar that patterns Draco’s chest, a scar he caused. Harry’s heart constricts.
Potter has on a cream colored dress shirt that sets off the warm tones in his skin and red and yellow suspenders. The suspenders really are garish, ridiculous Gryffindor nonsense, but the way they lay on Potter’s chest still makes Draco notice more than he should. He should not be noticing Potter at all. But he does, Merlin help him.
“Pretty?” Draco runs a hand over his embroidered vest.
“I don’t think I can move yet.” Draco’s words are almost a whisper.
“How do you know what I was thinking?” Draco is piqued.
He can hear Harry chuckling. Draco lays in bed and listens to the domestic noise of having Harry in his space, making tea like he belongs here, and Draco melts. It’s too early to tell Harry, but Draco is well on his way to being hopelessly in love, has been for some time.
Draco raises an eyebrow in question. “And what catch would that be?”
Draco can’t help the small movement he makes as he leans into the contact.
Draco presses their foreheads together. “We can’t do this here. The surveillance charms will do their work. We can come pick them up tomorrow.”
A quick swish of his wrist and everything is back where it belongs. Draco sits at his desk and reads through his precise notes about the case. There must be something he has missed.
Harry relaxes and nods. “Good.”
Draco huffs but there’s a smile playing with his lips as he says, “If I was to be honest, your ability to create chaos in every space you inhabit is irritating in the extreme.”
Draco gives the house-elf a slight bow. “Thank you. If Margot contacts you, please let me know.” Draco puts his card into Gatty’s hand. “And if there is any way I can be of assistance to you, please let me know.”
Harry concentrates on what he is doing. It takes longer than he wants, but when he’s done, the Sectumsempra scar is closed, angry red and bruised, along Draco’s side. Harry’s knees are protesting from being on the hard tile for so long and the dampness has seeped through his trousers, but he can't bring himself to move yet.
The shop smells of old paper and dust and Draco can’t help but inhale the scent. It reminds him of long nights spent in the library at Hogwarts and, later, of long nights in the library at the Ministry, doing research with Potter as they prepared for an assignment or worked out a mystery. Potter’s eyes always look especially nice in the candlelight, poring over a book and Draco has to shake the memory out of his head. Now is not the time for daydreaming. That will get them both killed.
“It’s an even better thing that you took care of the situation before it knocked us both on our asses.”
“Already paid for, the delivery wix said. Have a good evening, sir,” the runner says over her shoulder as she leaves.
Ginny winks at him and grabs the drinks. Draco takes what glasses are left and they settle down to an evening of drinking. Draco doesn’t talk much, he never does, unless he has something especially witty to say. Eventually the evening winds down until it’s just Granger, Weasley, Potter and himself.
Draco’s hand trembles as he reads, his mind going too many places to track.
Draco collapses heavily onto one of the benches along the wall, cutting off the swift intake of breath the pain along his side causes.
Potter turns and mutters a spell under his breath, locking the door and flipping over the sign on the door so it will read
Draco looks over at Potter. “Would you like to go first or shall I?”
“Petite witch, black hair in a single braid down her back, pale skin, and a tattoo of a bird on her throat. The woman said her name was Margot.”
Sitting in the middle of his desk is a steaming cup of tea and a bag of something.
Potter steps up close to Draco and peers into the room with the still figure on the bed, covered with a sheet. “Sorry, Malfoy. I know that was your only lead.”
Draco turns the corner on the way to his office and runs straight into Potter, whose head was down and whose hands are full of papers. Potter is startled into dropping his papers, and Draco absolutely does not notice how solid Potter’s chest feels as he bumps into the other man or how broad his shoulders look in the dress shirt and suspenders he has on today. Draco has tried not to notice the days Potter wears suspenders because they show off every inch of the man Potter has become. Draco fails miserably at not noticing.
The mental image of Malfoy, naked and glistening in the water, assaults Harry and he has to swallow past the rise of desire. The other man has never given any indication that he would welcome those kinds of thoughts from Harry. Harry does his best to crush them beneath the heel of his boots as he walks, but the spectre lingers behind his eyes and his hand shakes as he knocks on the shower door.
Draco leans around Potter to raise an eyebrow at Weasley. “I see your vocabulary hasn’t improved.”
Draco reaches out a hand and weakly clutches some of the fabric of Harry's shirt. “Please stay.”
Potter grins. “I’m happy to help.” His smile dims. “There’s a catch, though.”
Harry slaps him on the ass. “You have your serious face on. I hope you’re not talking yourself out of this.”
In hindsight, Draco should have expected it, should have been better prepared. Potter takes a step closer to the woman slumped against the wall. Draco moves closer to the witch. Potter shifts his eyes for a second, and that is when she strikes. Draco sees her intent and her intake of breath and he surges forward, praying he’s not too late.
The clerk hands over the paperwork and the wizard takes the unconscious and levitating witch into custody.
Harry’s hair is a mess and a wicked grin is spreading over his face as he stalks up to Draco. When Harry is close to him, he reaches out and unbuttons the top button of Draco’s vest. The ghost of Harry’s fingers as they move down his chest already has Draco trembling. He’s not sure he'll survive by the time Harry gets his hands on his bare skin.
Draco closes his eyes and nods. “Do it.”
“No, it bloody well isn’t. Fuck. If you see Potter, give him this and tell him I went to Mungo’s.” Draco shoves the paper into Weasley’s hand and is back out the door.
Luna looks up at that, large eyes blinking. “Not all of us, Draco.”
Draco shifts so he can wrap his fingers around Harry’s hard length. Draco rubs his thumb over the leaking hole and Harry’s hips give an involuntary jerk. “Eventually, I’d like to do more, but I’d really like to suck you off, if that’s ok.”
They Apparate outside the Ministry and, from the looks of the landmarks, end up in a neighborhood on the outskirts of London. Draco follows Potter to a nondescript cottage with wooden beams and a stone face. The garden in the front is untidy with a riot of blooms and fat bumblebees buzzing in the late morning sun. Potter lifts the iron knocker and knocks three times, pauses then knocks a fourth time.
Draco huffs and goes to find a small table. There’s one in the far back corner and he mulls this newest act of kindness with an open mind. He could dismiss the other things as anomalies, but this is happening too often to be random. Someone knows how he takes his tea, what biscuits he likes best with tea, which meat pastry is his favorite and which place makes them, and what his exact order is at Honey & Hops. Someone is either stalking him in the nicest way possible or he has a secret admirer.
Harry’s eyes sweep down and he allows himself to look at Draco, thick and hard and so close. Harry slides his hand up farther, moving slow so Draco has all the time to say no, to back away, to leave Harry aching. Draco doesn’t move. He swallows visibly and keeps his eyes on Harry.
Draco is relieved at the easier assignment. They’d just returned from a month-long overseas operation that involved multiple teams, and Draco is glad to be back to working with just the two of them, as if they really are friends. When they work alone he doesn’t have to contend with the sideways glances and snide remarks from other teams that make Potter’s expression go stiff and make Draco’s insides like stone.
Draco eats his candy in silence, watching Potter.
unfurls in Draco. He clears his throat. “Thank you for your help.”
Potter is sitting in their small office in the Ministry building when the memo flies through the door, zooming over Draco’s head as he places a cup of tea in front of Potter and eases himself into his own chair, his own tea cupped between his palms. Potter snatches the memo out of the air, his dark fingers quick and delicate enough to catch it without damaging it. Potter is careful with how he touches things, intentional with his gentleness or pressure when it’s needed. It was one of the first things Draco noticed about him after being paired during training. His next revelation was that Potter almost never touched Draco, as if touching him would burn him. Draco tries not to dwell on that truth and pushes the reminder away that for all the respect and almost friendship, Harry would choose to let him loose if he could.
Gatty smiles wide, showing large, crooked teeth. “Gatty wants to be of help when he can, sir.”
Every Thursday, Draco goes to a muggle deli about a mile from the Ministry. He always walks. It gives him a chance to clear his mind and mull over whatever he’s working on that day. He Apparates to a safe place and starts walking. The sun is warm on his skin and Draco lets the warmth loosen him. He can feel the tension leaving him with each step. By the time he goes through the doors of Honey & Hops, a deli that serves ciders and ales by the pint with their sandwiches and small plates, he’s almost lost the tightness from being around Potter.
“So are you.” Draco leans over Harry and kisses him slow. “I’ll get something to clean you up.”
Draco is saved from making a sarcastic remark in Potter’s direction by the re-entry of Gatty, carrying a large tray of tea things. The house-elf pours the tea and hands a cup to each of them before serving himself.
Draco lets go of the chair and straightens up. “Wonderful. I have reached a lull and was looking for a new avenue. You have excellent timing.”
“Discindere Cultro!” the witch yells.
Since the war, the Auror department has grown and Robards instituted a new policy where they switch partners every 6 months or are assigned to different cases and partners depending on what skills a particular case needs. It means that Draco has worked with most of the Aurors on the floor and most of them only grudgingly respect him, including Potter, though Draco suspects Potter and Weasley consider him something of a friend. The conversation with Gatty comes back to mind and Draco warms.
“Thank the stars,” Draco says. “I was starting to worry I would be the only sane one here tonight.”
They apparate out of the shop and back into a secure landing room in the Auror area of the Ministry. It’s technically not inside the Ministry walls, which is why they can Apparate to it. It’s connected to the Ministry building by a series of tunnels and passageways that are a closely held secret. A clerk is sitting behind a desk, the only furniture in the room.
As if that is a catalyst, Harry yanks Draco’s shirt out of his trousers and Draco runs his hand into Harry’s hair and presses their mouths together. Harry moans against Draco’s mouth and Draco’s tongue plunges into Harry, using his other hand to keep their waists together. Harry manages to pull off Draco’s shirt, but this article of clothing is tossed onto the floor. Draco doesn’t care in the slightest because his exposed nipples are now rubbing against the slight sprinkling of hair on Harry’s chest. Draco doesn’t remember getting Harry’s shirt open but it is and Draco can’t get enough of Harry’s warm skin beneath his palms.
The class had been prepping their potion ingredients for twenty minutes when someone barged in through the back door, panting heavily. It was none other than Potter himself, looking dishevelled and unprepared.
Harry then realised he was holding the arm which once had the Dark Mark and he trailed his fingers over the scars and he didn’t realise it, but a meagre tear slid out of his eye and splattered onto the sand. He was panting heavily from the exertion of saving him but now it was time to get him to Madam Pomfrey. He picked Malfoy up bridal-style, draping his limp arms over his shoulders and hurried past the crowd as fast as he could.
Lost in his thoughts, Harry didn’t even realise that he’d reached the Great Hall until he felt a hand clasp his shoulder. “How are you doing Harry? Haven’t seen you for a while, eh!” Harry looked to the person speaking to him.
was worse. Whatever Draco had done to them in the past, it didn’t warrant their complete lack of sympathy over someone so gravely injured.
He was at risk of getting into more trouble than Harry and he was not willing to get sent back to St Mungo’s any time soon.
Draco knew a tone of dismissal when he heard one, so he let Potter drag him out of the room and back to the infirmary.
“Boys, arguing is not going to get you anywhere, and it certainly won’t help you figure out how to break the curse. Now, scurry along, I shall have to inform the heads of your houses so they can accommodate you whatever way they can regarding this unique situation.”
He disappeared into his thoughts for the rest of the day, not realising that time would go by so quickly. Merlin and Morgana, he forgot how tiring classes were. He needed to stretch his legs and get some fresh air.
No, you can’t think of Malfoy like that, he thought to himself. It’s Draco, not Malfoy, another part of his head told him.
“Yeah, I’ll take him.”
Draco. Referring to Draco as his friend in his head felt more pleasant than it should’ve.
“I said shut up!”
“There, happy?” Harry looked over to Malfoy who had been nodding along angrily throughout Harry’s explanation of his symptoms.
“I must say, we moved from enemies to friends really quickly, didn’t we?”
Malfoy frowned, looking sceptical. “Okay, what if Potter’s intent was to say, murder me?”
With a ‘pop’, the young house-elf appeared, bowing as he removed the tray. “Master Draco hasn’t eaten much. Master has only eaten a piece of bread, Honky is concerned.”
“Ah, Mister Malfoy, how are you? I heard from Headmistress McGonagall that she managed to get you a room next to each other, which was the result of my persuasion skills.”
He sat down on a fallen log, holding two mugs of steamy firewhiskey and beckoned for Harry to sit down. Harry did so, trying to steady his pounding heart and shaky hands as he gladly accepted the drink.
“You are not going to die!” Harry roared, grabbing Malfoy just as he was about to hit the ground. The momentum of doing so caused him to roll off his broom and he instinctively held Malfoy closer to him, shielding his face and neck. The coarse sand scraped their skins until they came to a halt in another pit of sand.
The cat massaged the mattress, curling up into a pile of fur. Draco laughed, laying on his back and staring at the ceiling. Being touched affectionately was a nice feeling, he’d like that to happen more often.
“Oh, Merlin! It looks like Slytherin’s Seeker has been knocked off his broom! Gryffindor Seeker Harry Potter is going after him but will he reach him in time?” Arnold shouted into the microphone, a look of genuine fear on his face.
“I guess you aren’t a cheeky monster all the time.”
Murphy gave a sympathetic nod, wishing both of them well before bringing his attention back to Slughorn. Draco’s mouth was doing a little dance, alternating between a smile and a straight face and he scribbled onto a piece of parchment, handing it over to Harry.
“You’re not scared of getting in trouble, are you? I’ve gotten away with sneaking out of Hogwarts multiple times and even if we do get caught, what are they going to do?”
Draco woke up earlier than usual, yawning and stretching his arms, working out the kinks in his bones before jumping in surprise after noticing a prodigiously hearty breakfast laid out on his desk. He wasn’t expecting it but judging by the temperature of the fragrant earl grey tea, Honky must have laid it out a few minutes ago.
“Hello, Onyx.” Draco stroked the fluffy ball of fur fondly.
What had happened? Just seconds ago they were sharing a tender moment and now, Harry looked ready to Crucio him into oblivion. Draco threw his firewhiskey to the ground, standing up despite the increasing ache in his chest and blinding hot pain in his head.
Harry woke up at the third chime of the twelve o clock bell and jumped out of bed, realising he might be late for the Quidditch match at twelve-thirty. Blast his useless alarm clock! He scrambled to the bathroom to brush his teeth and spray some deodorant on and threw on his Quidditch robes, tripping over his own feet as he rushed out of his room and into a familiar blonde biscuit.
(See the end of the chapter for
He was just above to close Malfoy’s eyelids when a strangled gasp from the lanky boy startled Harry and he jumped back, shoving the boy off of him. Thank Merlin the bastard wasn’t dead.
He was the only one walking down this particular corridor and as he turned the corner, he saw the one face he desperately wanted to see. Stupidly pretty Draco.
“No! I’m staying here in the room next to yours, thanks to Slughorn. Fix that rat’s nest on your head that you call hair before you insult me. Did you even comb it today?”
Thank you for reading! Kudos and comments are greatly appreciated!
By then, most of the Gryffindor table had heard Harry’s outburst. Most of them just pretended not to have noticed and awkwardly picked at their food, while some just stared openly at Harry. Harry couldn’t care less, waiting for whatever words his friends were gonna yell back at him.
“You’re going to bathe me? I’m going to be naked with you,” Draco asked, frowning as he waved his finger over to Harry and himself.
He didn’t want to cry but he couldn’t help but sniffle a couple of times and swipe at his eyes to stop the prickling sensation. Draco couldn’t believe that he had ever thought that Harry saw him as who he really was and genuinely respected him as a friend and equal. He should've known from the start that the friendship they formed would end in a disaster because Harry was right. Villains don’t get happy endings.
“Hello, did you miss me?”
He entered the dark and dreary dungeon, multiple stenches hitting him in the face at once. It was cold, temperature cold, and it was unlike the coldness that used to emanate from this room when the Death Eaters had taken over Hogwarts the last year. The mood was cheery now, which was the result of Slughorn’s bright personality.
‘I have a bathtub,” Harry said, helping him over to the bathroom. He filled the tub with hot water, pumping some soap into it so it was warm and bubbly. He sat Draco on the edge of the tub and began to undo his shoelaces much to the other boy’s surprise.
As Harry sat through his lessons and lunch alone, trying to avoid Ron and Hermione, he found his thoughts drifting time and time again to Draco. How he’d smiled at Harry this morning, how his hair had glistened in the bath. He figured that it was just his excitement at forming a new friendship, his first in a while. The day passed agonizingly slow as Harry counted down the hours to Potions class which he shared with his
“Jealous?” Harry teased.
“Neither of us like this,
‘Oh, fuck’ was his only thought when his grip on his broom loosened and his head exploded with pain. His vision went dark and he fell unconscious, losing control of his body immediately.
Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Ron and Hermione staring at him and he almost felt bad for ditching them. He then remembered what had transpired at breakfast the other day and all feelings of guilt disappeared. No point crying over spilt milk.
Murphy’s face morphed into one of shock and confusion before clarifying, “Indigestion? Did Malfoy eat it too?”
Slughorn approached their desk and immediately began to applaud Potter on his
The way he said it made Draco feel like that was the bare minimum Harry could do for him, that defending him from the onslaught of insults and abuse was the best he could do and that hurt him deeply. It hurt him even more than the words Harry said to him all this time.
Unfortunately for him, there were none left, but he supposed the next best thing was a carriage with just Ron and Hermione. It had been ages since he had spoken to anyone other than Kreacher. After the war, he had drifted from everyone he was close with because they just couldn’t understand why he didn’t want to move on.
He had to remind himself that this was not a date and that they were just two friends spending time together. You and Malfoy are just friends, he lectured himself, get a grip! He almost said it aloud but stopped in his tracks when Draco hurried back to him, clutching his hand as he dragged him out of the village and into the nearby forest.
Harry was not pleased when Draco overtook him. He was losing his touch after a year without practice and he just couldn’t let Malfoy beat him. It’d be a shameful thing for both him and the house of Gryffindor. He suddenly heard movement behind him and stopped in his tracks just as a massive Bludger flew by him. It was so close to his face he could feel the brush of wind. He breathed a sigh of relief but panic immediately gripped his heart when he saw it move towards Malfoy.
“My dear boy! It’s good to see you on time,” Slughorn boomed at Harry’s direction, snapping him out of his reverie and bringing him back into reality.
A quiet murmur from the pale boy jolted Harry out of his daze and he turned to face him, watching intently as he blinked slowly.
“Do you hear yourself, Harry? It’s Malfoy we’re talking about!”
A purr was his response and he picked up the kitten, placing him on the bed before dressing himself. Did Harry really offer Draco his clothes? It could have been done out of pity. And did they really almost kiss? That was insane. He wasn’t sure how to feel about that. He sat on the edge of his bed, stroking his cat’s head.
A snarky comment from the boy brought him back to reality and he immediately felt guilty once he heard Malfoy’s accusation.
The cat sneezed in response, sniffing him and giving him what appeared to be a frown. Well, if cats could frown.
“Professor, may I be excused? I don’t feel well.”
“Yes, Professor.”
Harry stared at Madam Pomfrey dubiously. “What are you talking about? He just told you I was responsible for the curse and the whole coughing out blood thing.”
“Draco, do you want to go to Hogsmeade with me?”
“Fuck you,” Draco waved his wand wildly in anger, “
Before he could reach for his wand to throw a hex, Potter drew his, yelling a spell that Draco hadn’t heard of before. It hit Draco square in the chest, causing him to be flung violently back into the wall.
He was not about to have a restful night. The day’s events had only served to stress him out which would increase the likelihood of a terrifying nightmare. Tonight would be one of the worst.
The next time Draco walked past Harry in the corridor outside their rooms, he managed a small smile as a greeting. The wave Harry sent him in return shouldn’t have pleased Draco as much it did.
“Sorry I’m late Professor, I overslept,” he wheezed, clearly worn out after running to class from his
The game commentator was a Sixth Year Ravenclaw named Arnold Essertg. Draco knew his family relatively well and he was a good kid. When he passed Draco in the hallway, he said hello and even gave him a hug. Shocking but it was gladly appreciated.
“What the fuck Malfoy? You can’t be dead! Get up, you idiot!”
Harry sighed, knowing that Malfoy was right. He wasn’t sure how to sugarcoat the events of the day and Malfoy’s symptoms so he told Flitwick what happened exactly how Malfoy would have done it - emphasising how Harry was to blame for everything.
“Goodbye, Potter,” Draco mockingly whispered before walking out, deciding to head straight to the Slytherin common room. He needed a good rest if he was going to have to deal with all these pesky Gryffindors for the rest of his school year.
Harry threw his mug of firewhiskey into a tree, yelling out loud in frustration. The moment Draco left, he immediately felt regret that he had been so cruel. He didn’t mean any of those words, but did he? Some part of him must have felt that way, if not he wouldn’t have thought of it, let alone say it.
He got to his feet, smirking at Potter who was frozen and looking at him with a horrified expression. He was probably mad that his puny little spell didn’t work at all.
Jars full of pickled slimy creatures, unknown fluids, dried herbs and tentacles. Dirty cauldrons lining old oak tables that were stained and worn down from aeons of use. Ah, Potions class. The dishevelled state of the room was normal to the students by now. Memories flooded Draco’s head and heart as he remembered his old Potions Professor, Severus Snape.  He missed him now that he was gone, just like everyone else he had lost. He shook his head, trying to rid himself of these intruding thoughts. He had to focus on class, not get distracted by his feelings.
“Will all of you shut up! I don’t want to hear anyone speaking of him like this! Fuck off, all of you!” He bellowed, tone venomous and he stormed off, leaving everyone stunned. They weren’t expecting this kind of outburst from him, especially defending an ex-Death Eater! He must have been enchanted, they whispered to one another as they watched him disappear.
Tonic of Precision, a potion that was primarily made out of plants and flowers. Harry frowned as he stared at the ingredients provided. Baneberry, bugleweed, ageratum and bleeding hearts accompanied by feathers of a skua and musk of a desman. What even was a skua? Harry snickered as he pointed to the words, nudging Draco and trying to make him laugh.
The boy groaned all of a sudden, “Harry, I don’t feel so good.”
“Wow, that’s a nice room,” Draco marvelled.
Potter turned to stare at him, shocked and curious, as Draco gripped the table for some support. He raised his hand and managed to croak out a weak question.
He picked up his broom and headed down to the field, breathing in the warm crisp autumn air. It felt good in his lungs, making him feel just a tad more powerful. He loved autumn because of all the glorious colours but there was a despondency to it. The leaves of the trees were dying, just like he was inside. Draco had never found such solidarity in leaves. “You and me both, buddy,” He said, watching as a single orange leaf fluttered to the ground helplessly and was crunched on by a stampede of students.
No sooner had Harry sat at Gryffindor table did an owl drop an envelope into his lap.
But as he recalled the incident, what he remembered most was the ghost of Malfoy’s breath, warm and spiced. It was always spiced, as if he only drank cinnamon Firewhisky.
She looked apologetic. Harry gauged the tall boy as he bumped Ritchie Coote with his shoulder, snickering.
Malfoy appraised Harry. He seemed to be considering something. Then, after a moment, he said, "What are you doing here, Potter?"
Malfoy was at the end of it. He had knelt to tie his shoe, but then he straightened and disappeared around the corner. Harry followed him as he took a left towards the Great Hall, but when Malfoy reached it, he kept walking, past the classrooms and Entrance Hall. There was nothing here but private rooms and the—
Mrs. Prunella emerged from the storeroom with a package and set it heavily on the counter.
, he thought fervently, but the darkness was unyielding.
Harry looked up. Malfoy’s brow was furrowed.
" said Harry weakly, flipping through the glossy magazine.
Harry went to get his bag. The door thudded open and Boughbranch strode in, her eyes on the parchment she was carrying.
Malfoy's expression gradually eased. He shook his head, then let out a strange little derisive laugh. It broke off quickly, awkward in the silence.
"Um, I’m not sure about this," said Hermione weakly.
Boughbranch eyed his vial sadly. “And what color is this meant to be, Potter?”
Grimacing, Harry tugged his hand free. The plant belched onto his arm in retaliation.
A soft
“It’s not as if I could study with you talking the whole time…and then I remembered this," she pulled yet another copy of the
A gust of hot breath, like a laugh, grazed the shell of his ear. Darkly, Malfoy chuckled. He trailed kisses, open-mouthed, down Harry’s throat. In the deafening quiet of the cramped storage closet, broken by Harry’s harsh breaths, the wet
"What's happening with Harry?" came Hermione's voice. She had finally lifted her nose from the parchment.
“I know about the lack thereof. But still, one girl in eighteen years...and you as
“No one knew?” he asked carefully.
Of course, he'd never say it, but the real reason Harry hadn't seen much of Hagrid was that Hagrid always wanted to
Harry chose to ignore this. Malfoy watched him expectantly.
. Like how he had felt at breakfast that morning, reading Malfoy's letter.
Harry had suspected as much. Lucius Malfoy had ratted out half of the Slytherins’ parents, after all, and had received just a tap on the wrist for his trouble.
Yet again, Harry was growing irritated. It was too much to ask, apparently, that Malfoy act like a decent human being for more than a couple of hours.
Boughbranch frowned. “I’ll be there in a moment,” she said, and then to Harry and Malfoy, “Thirty minutes, boys, and those potions best be passable. Or you’ll both be back tomorrow.”
"Who cares about
me?" He scoffed. "I suppose I'm not surprised. It's not like it's the first time."
"It's even too cold for the giant squid," grumbled Ron, "and he
Harry cursed. Caught up in the duel, they’d forgotten to cast a Silencing Charm. Hastily, Harry grabbed his bag and pulled out his cloak.
Malfoy looked at him incredulously. “
At last, Malfoy spoke.

“Of course I don’t want that,” said Harry.
that a new flush shot through Harry. Heat coiled low in his stomach.
He was even nice enough to ignore Malfoy’s muttered “
In swift strides, Draco crossed the room. His eyes were dark.
"It's not a joke," said Malfoy, glowering. "Just because
"Quite like his father," giggled Petunia.
He hit Malfoy with an Immobulus Charm. But the second before Malfoy froze, a flash of light, like a darting flame, shot from his wand. It pierced Harry's left trainer as he leapt aside.
“Not to mention,” continued McGonagall gently, “that despite your great accomplishments as a wizard, Potter, you are still lacking formal higher education. Now, occasionally we hire based on career experience...however, seeing as you are still a student…”
That would've gone over spectacularly.
"Actually, we don’t know that.”
“Of course,” he replied quietly.
He saw those fingers, long and pale, slide a piece of folded parchment onto his desk.
“What? Fine—
Behind him, Malfoy laughed. Electricity shot across Harry’s skin: warm breath ghosted the back of his neck. Then fingers—
"Fine, don't listen to me. See where that gets you. Idiot."
Harry’s back hit the wall with a dull
“We don’t know,” said Ron. He frowned. “He could’ve traveled outside—”
Luna had materialized at Hermione’s shoulder. Hermione, wincing at her trodden foot, shot Harry a grateful glance.
A strange sensation washed over Harry—relief, that’s all it was, nothing more.
Voldemort had scarcely entrusted the knowledge of his Horcruxes to his Death Eaters; certainly, Malfoy knew nothing of them. He and the rest of the wizarding world were forced to believe one thing: Harry was the Boy-Who-Lived, and it was simply some esoteric force inherent in him that had finally conquered You-Know-Who once and for all.
Finally, the common room was empty. Everyone had gone to bed. But Harry was wide awake—agitated, even.
Dinner was a rowdy affair. Dean and Seamus took every opportunity to quote sentences from the
“Thank you, Professor.”
Harry had never felt proud of being better at things than his friends. Well, that wasn’t exactly true: it felt good to beat Hermione at defense, and Ron in Quidditch. But he knew they were better than him at many other things, so his pride never lasted long. But he felt definite satisfaction at Malfoy recognizing that he was better than him. At two things, in fact—Defense and Quidditch.
"My offer?"
, Harry read.
Malfoy scoffed. "Those three would've cut him apart limb from limb if they'd had the chance. I'm only sorry I couldn't kill them myself."
. Harry felt sick.
"Told you," muttered Ron. "
Malfoy cursed and shot up. The chairs
Next to them, the Fat Lady said snidely, “You two want to come in, or are Philip and I supposed to watch your melodrama all night long?”
Harry wrenched away. He took a deep, staggering breath. For a moment, fear flickered in Malfoy’s eyes, barely discernable—but then Harry shoved him into the opposite wall, and Malfoy’s eyes turned to black.
For once, Harry felt like he would do alright if he were tested: he was doing well in his classes, even scraping As and Es in Potions. His sleepless nights in the library had paid off, and loathe as he was to admit it, Remedial Potions with Malfoy had helped—though Harry was glad it was over.
Malfoy had a point, after all, Harry thought belatedly.
"Today," he said smoothly, eyes glittering, “we duel. No spoken spells. Otherwise—there are no rules."
"Forget it," said Harry quickly. Self-conscious, he scratched his neck. The skin was hot to the touch, and it twinged dully with the memory of phantom ant bites.
He looked at it, then at Malfoy. “So…what's it you want then?”
But instead, a small crease appeared on Malfoy’s brow. He looked away, at a point above Harry’s shoulder.
Merlin’s ghost—”
“Hungry, are you?” said Ron.
Harry glared at her until she blushed and turned away.
"I don't hate
"Yeah…" said Ron, scratching his head. "Sorry about that."
"All done, you two?” said Boughbranch, unaware. "Let's test them, shall we?"
He pulled the scroll of parchment from his bag and passed to Ron. Hastily, Ron unrolled it, eyes flitting across the page.
“Fuck,” muttered Malfoy, struggling to extricate himself from between the desk’s legs. He shoved his way out and, stumbling, stood up.
“Just let her go,” sighed Malfoy.
Malfoy shrugged, exhaling a honey-hued cloud of smoke.
“His soul…?” said Malfoy, lost. Bemused, he sighed. “The
"Harry James Potter," she said, torn between exasperation and amusement. "What have you done?"
The following afternoon found Harry, Hermione, and Ron near the lake, huddled around an orb of conjured blue fire.
