"H-he wanted to be f-friends." He panted out.
She saw Draco bite at her lower lip and look at the hallway in which they were standing in, Harry herself realised that a foot of space had been created between them by now. "I wanted to say something to you. Try something, I presume, as well."
"You heard right." Draco replied in a small voice. He risked his hand forward to brush the dark hair away from the scar he'd always seen the school, but Harry caught the slim wrist before it could touch his face. He pushed his own hair back showing the long jagged scar on the side of his forehead. "Oh God! It really is you!" Draco breathed out loudly, his hand shivering in the other's hold before he snatched it out.
(See the end of the chapter for
"And how this Potter business going?"
The morning came with a fresh motivation for Harry. He decided to reconcile with his husband. He didn't knock at the doors of his chambers, which were on the completely different side of the castle. He was greeted with a beautiful sight of a blond sleeping soundly on the dark maroon sheets and a gold threaded pillows. The covers had wound in a haggard manner around his waist and Harry could see that Draco slept naked in his form. He sat on the mattress as quietly as he could with his heavy clothes. He let his palm graze the smooth jaw and thumbed at the pink lips. He couldn't stop himself from reminiscing the first moment he had looked at Draco. It had been scorching hot and Draco felt like an oasis, his silver eyes were tempting and his full lips inviting. The offer of marriage to such a man came like a blessing to him. He had wanted nothing but to carry him in his arms and take him to the tents and have his way with him. But Draco looked way too regal, just as he did now- even as he slept with light snores.
"I was." Oh merlin! He had an amazing baritone. It was deep and low, and had a slight accent to it. "would you let me buy you a drink?" I nod my head and he orders a similar glass of what he was having. I could already compare him with Harry, who had stumbled on words when he first asked me the same question only by saying 'can I get you drink, Malfoy?' and I had raised my brow to snort and reply 'can you, Potter? I didn't know you worked as a waiter here.' The date had started bad, but turned goofy there on.
"How about I make some hummus and tortillas for us, and we can snack on Doritos."
"I think that's enough prep for you." Harry pulled out his fingers. He used his precum to lube himself up and lined his head at the entrance. "here we go!" He pushed in, in one thrust. Draco almost felt his throat jump out of his mouth at the sudden intrusion. His cries increased in volume and he could feel new tears roll down his face. He struggled around as much as he could, but he couldn't throw away the stronger man. A few aimed thrusts later he felt a huge tug inside of him and one of cries turned to a loud shout. He stopped himself from moving and saying anything when he felt that feeling again. It felt too bad yet too good. He didn't want to feel it, but a few prods at the same place again and again made him yelp out again.
"It is what you wish to be. No one can know their future. But if your desire is strong you can achieve what you want." He replied with stroke to his beard.
"Is it bad?"
"He is called Prince." Malfoy answered with warmth. The cat screeched and shuffled in his hold, then he let it go. "He likes to be alone, most of the times." Harry took a step back when the cat walked past him, it felt like it was shooting him a glare of its own; but then he shook his head at the weirdness of the situation.
Harry was specifically put into a different cell than others. The walls were thick and of stone, even if he tried screaming at the top of his voice, but there was no reply from anyone. He then had to lay back and count the seconds by. He had gone upto eleven thousand, four hindered and fifty six, then he had given up, closing his eyes and sighing loudly. It must have been an hour or so which might have passed since when he heard very soft footsteps and the clink of the knob of the iron door. He had to blink back when sudden candlelight entered the cell. He grabbed onto the dagger in his boot and pounced on the figure. He didn't expect to be pounced back instead, which lean arms and legs wrapping around his neck and torso respectively. His name was called in a soft sigh in his ear and he sniffed at the neck of the person. "Draco." He whispered grabbing onto the hips, the candle laid forgotten in a lateral position on the dirty floor. Draco called out his name again and placed haste kisses on his neck, jaw, cheeks and finally on his lips. It was as if Draco couldn't have enough of him as his hair was being tugged at and his lips pulled in little nips.
"Sure. Nice seeing you again, after such a long time." Harry doubted Malfoy heard him, because as soon as he shifted Malfoy brushed past him to the exit- his coat brushed by his arm and Harry smelt the warm scent of chocolate and spices from Malfoy.
"Want to come don't you?" Harry spoke with a growl.
"I do, Draco. I do!"
"You're contradicting yourself through." Draco couldn't help but jab lightly. He was answers with a chaste kiss on his lips.
But his pride stopped him. He wasn't told of such a huge matter. For days he slept lightly, worrying about his father's condition. He was named 'King' untimely. He was in a tight situation for a number of days and sleepless nights.
Draco carefully took hold of it, touching it's tip. He tried to pull it but the hold on the other side was strong. He let out a chuckle of his own. "I could imagine way more uses of this than just casting spells."
"It depends upon the aid you ask me of."
He scoffed as he sipped on his tea. "I am not. He decided to become one when he was just eighteen, he told me that he needed my support. I didn't give him, I kicked him out to the back yard shed. I thought he'd be back in morning with his senses in mind. The only thing I found was a letter on the shed door. He's leaving, it said." I smiled at him and put my hand on his hand, rubbing my thumb in slow circles. "it's just he loved sweets too." I consoled him for a while and then asked to look at his wand. And returned it to him. He continued speaking at the times, talking about how his son was a mischievous little brat.
To his surprise the snake like man just laughed, his laughter booming on the walls and through the corridors. "I understand now. You wouldn't want to see me as your guardian- since we would be doing antics which are only allowed between lovers." Draco shivered in repulse. "I apologize, Draco." He was given a low bow and then the man straightened up again to walk through the halls, the tone was not apologetic at all.  Draco followed him in quick steps even though his calves ached and thighs burnt with rashes.
"You want to know why I'm wearing these?" He tapped at his goggles and saw Draco reply with an eager nod. He casually removed them and relished on seeing the grin falter before dropping to a gape. Grey eyes blinked rapidly at him, taking in the situation carefully before he whispered out a quiet 'no'. It was Harry's turn to grin. "Yes."
"Muggles do this while having sex. I thought you'd like it, with you know - your muggle childhood with those awful muggle relatives of yours."
Harry snorted. "too much rich. More like cave full."
Potter let out a sigh and glanced at the open window. Draco didn't have a chance to let out a squeak when he was quickly turned around and bent on the wide oak table of his office. He winced when  the pens, clips and folders dug into his chest through his shirt. He felt a hard and throbbing member press against his arse and he tried to look back. Potter grabbed the thin strands at the nape of his neck as he leaned down to whisper into his ear hotly. "I don't like to fuck a loose hole. And from what I've heard, my wish isn't being fulfilled." Draco struggled against the hold, although half heartedly, but the bloody oaf was a heavy bastard.
"You- you can feel it?" Draco looked at her with eyes wide blown, her throat gulped the air and Harry leaned in to kiss her lips.
It wasn't 'Potter'. Not her last name, nor her full name. Not Harriet. No. It was Harry. Just Harry.
He slid his tongue in my mouth before leaving back. "Firewhiskey. How original." I just shrugged my shoulders. I dipped a finger in the huge bowl and sucked on the tip.
"Gonna cum?"
"Zabini, Parkinson, Goyle mostly I think." I nodded my head. "Victor too, right?" I frowned. He saw my expression and continued. "I saw them last night." This was second time when I got to about the 'outings' from Ron  about which I had no idea. I had thought that Draco had a long list of patients making him come home late, later than I did.
you do, you
Hermione found him and handed him a plate of cheese and salad, and forced him to eat to full and gulp down a tall glass of water. According to her he needed his proper energy in front of loads of people before he made his speech. But he didn't have the chance to look for Malfoy again, because as soon as he took his last sip, she pulled him back to the atrium and sat him beside her and Ron. The brunette and Luna soon arrived in front of them and called them all to sit down. There was a green curtain behind and they didn't say anything, just motioned their hands at the curtains. As they walked back the curtains lifted and revealed three men dresses in different clothes but in light attire.
"Went for a few drinks with Ron." I leaned down to kiss him while the boy in my arms made gagging noise. Even though he was seven by now, he had of course learnt when to do what. I blamed it all on George.
He groaned above me and I moaned beneath, as we both came at the same time. I didn't spill anything except a drop or two, but Harry filled me up from inside. As he softened I could feel some drop out. When he tried to slip out, I held him. "Stay inside, please." I know my eyes were wide, and I know I looked wanton and way too needy, but he stayed, kissing me deeply. He held me too close to him, and I could hear him breathing me.
"I gave him a stuff we give to dragons to calm  them down. Applied to humans, it acts as a strong aphrodisiac. You better take care of him, Harry, he's gonna need cock for at least next four hours." There was loud sound of fire blasting. I could feel Harry's eyes on me, when I opened my eyes which I hadn't realised I had shut tight, I saw a concerned green gaze on me.
"More food!" The snake slithered to new people. "God is being gracious."
Harry grinned instead, pulling down his pants with his trousers a bit. His cock sprung upwards as precum leaked from the top. "C'mon spread your arse for me." He tugged at his length slightly. "C'mon!" He slapped at the pale arse and Draco hurried to do so. Harry poked at the entrance, not really thrusting in. He rubbed the tip up and down the crack, teasing him more and more, until Draco whimpered loudly. He was enjoying himself thoroughly hearing the other man's cries and quick yelps, and he wanted nothing more but to hear it all night. But he couldn't do that, he had to do some more of course. He thrusted in quickly, pushing in till he bottomed out and his length throbbed in when he heard a loud gasp. Draco held at his collar and hair, his arse brushed against the coarse fabric of the trousers and coolness of the zipper.
"Please think on it Mr Flemming while you send your wand for repairing. Why don't you owl and letter to your son? Call him over. It's been years." I stood and walked around him. I then pecked his cheek lightly. "think on it." I whispered in his ear. "and thank you." I could see his cheeks heat up but he had a fatherly look on his face which Father never held. That reminded me to send a letter to him in Azkban. Maybe ask him if he wanted any more of Shakespeare's books.
"To anull our marriage of course. I had wanted to say it to his face."
Draco visibly gulped hard. His eyes dropped to the off-white shirt the other man wore. "I didn't always fuck them, if that's what you're asking."
It was all her fantasies coming true, and even so much more. She wrapped her arms around the naked waist and pulled Draco closer to her, fluttering her eyes close and tilting her head to deepen the kiss. Draco gasped and Harry took the chance to sweep her tongue in and taste the sweet taste of red wine and holy basil. She pushed Draco back and held her against the wall backfirst, one of her knees protruding outwards to rub against the heat which Draco was holding with a silent clench. She grabbed at the sagging breasts, which she knew  were once perky and rapt when she had seen Draco change in the locker rooms, one too many times, during the Mandatory Ministry Training Programme: they were small, round and the areolas were tiny too, Malfoy looked pretty then. But now they were slightly droopy, the tips were flat and rosé in colour and the nipples had enlarged, Harry had Scorpius to thank that for, and Draco looked so very beautiful.
"No. I'm sorry."
"It was all an act, nothing more. I swear." Draco looked down at him, his eyes looking like clear water in the candle light. "I never let him touch me. No one's there for me, except for you."
Harry shouted in anger, and his voice resonated back in the corridors they were passing. In his sudden adrenaline the ever tight bonds snapped from his wrists. He quickly pulled the dagger which he always kept in his boot and pounced on the wolf. It growled and roared, howling. Harry stabbed it's eye and the blood dripped ever so quickly onto the floor. Ron and Ginny were quick too. They knocked out two guards who approached them and stole their blades cutting their binds and helped others as well. Bill threw a sword at Harry, who caught the handle as he almost rode atop the wolf. He really hated the mark on its front limb and he went for that, a quick slice on the mark and the wood howled. Harry reached down then, stabbing the sword to its sheath, into the animal's ribcage. He only had to count till three- the giant wolf whined before crumbling onto the floor, in its pool of blood and it's eyes rolling back.
"Such mean words from such pretty lips, my arrogant Prince- or may I say Queen." He groaned as he gave a mock bow.  "But arrogance does suit you, you deserve to be of such nature."
Harry tilted his mouth, screwing his lips. "uh... Okay then. I'll recheck it through HO." The pale head nodded, and Harry saw sweat on his forehead again. "Are you okay? You're always sweating."
It took a while, but we had the opportunity to record the signature to help us track down the vehicle. It would take a couple of hours, so Ron and I decided to head to a nearby café. "How's 'Mione?" I ask as I pay for both of our warm lattes.
Seamus made a grunting sound. "It - it speaks!" He gasped.
“But- but I always know you, Harry.”
He gripped hard at the Gryffindor tie when Potter gently rubbed at his lips. “Was it Goyle?”
Roberts looked at both of them. "You two know each other?"
The Wizard shook his head with a grin. Draco then pushed him to the bed and crawled in top of him, straddling his waist, trying to ignore the rising length hitting his hip. Bile was up his throat. He swallowed it down. "Then show it to me." He moved back and forth, and rolled his head back. "Show me that you like me, ah!" He let out a forced moan. And then he felt the bile coming up again and this time he knew it wasn't going to back down.
"Let me help you." He repeated.
Draco pushed down his arms and glared darkly at Potter. "Don't you fucking pity me!" He hissed out. "and don't you fucking dare think that you can now swoop in and be a hero that you are. 'Now' that you're talking about is good and I like it. It's not lavish and amazing, but it's good. At least I don't have to face hypocrites like you, who think that fancy dinners and auctions can save the world because you're donating. It goes much more than that. And-" he let out a dark laugh. "And you know the best part about this, this all took place before Dark Lord, during he was there, and after him too. Not much difference in the culture, is there, Potter? People move on quite quickly in wizarding world, and maybe right now I'm poor, way poorer for you to even consider. But soon, I swear I will be as rich as you, maybe even richer than you, because I'm Draco Malfoy." He turned swiftly around to walk away from Potter, not before saying. "War Heroes, my arse."
But maybe I jinxed myself.
"Well?" A blonde brow raised at him. "Do I meet your requirements?" Oh he sure did. Draco had filled nicely from last he saw him. His arse had become plumper and his gaze had softened considerably from the annoying sneer he always used to carry around in school as he pushed and taunted Harry and Ron. The matter had once gone so far that Harry had a broken nose while Ron sported a broken arm. While the pale male wasn't much in physical strength department, he had two of his cronies do all his dirty work for him. Well now look at the case.
"Yeah." I rubbed a hand on my face, skewing my glasses a bit my forehead and my eyes burnt. "Him too."
Why didn’t I have a baby?
Harry gritted his teeth when he saw the Man responsible for it all. He stood haughtily on the throne while Harry knelt in the dirty and bloody carpet with Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Fred and George, Bill, Neville and Seamus. The rest of the men were either killed and eaten up by the wolves or were thrown to the dungeons, probably as a meal for some more dangerous creature. "Here lies the King of Gryffindor, at my feet amongst the dirt." He could see a few of his friends shiver in fear but Harry stayed put. He looked directly into the red eyes. He felt death and darkness through the gaze of which he looked into, but he willed himself strong. "And I heard that you were some brave hero. My pet just got you for me like a meal on a silver platter." As if on cue the big wolf came into the view. It growled and his drool dripped down the carpet as it stared back at them with its yellow eyes. Harry didn't care.
Jsjsksksj, oh lord, I finished it! Yay! This was my first, chaptered story.
So tired cause I wrote this whole chapter once and it all got blanked out when I opened my device to upload. So this is like the second draft. Note to myself to do stuff offline and not in cloud. And I decided to write more words for a chapter so, long chapters now! Yay! Also I'm working on another drarry fic, not that seriously but yeah.
"Ottah.." he mumbled around the digit and Potter rewarded him with a harsh thrust.
"He's a squib?"
!" They both snapped their neck to see Ron Weasley by the door. He looked at them with wide eyes and then turned around. Draco saw the handcuff dangle down from one of his freckled hand and he couldn't help but wonder where Reynolds was; but before that, Weasley had seen him in such position.  He pushed Harry off of him and he had barely moved except for a small nudge.
"Dark Lord." He said with his voice as sweet as he could muster, blinking his eyes rapidly. "I feel such affection for you right now." He said slowly.
"Harry." Even though I was a well trained, almost on his way to be the next Head Auror: Luna still made me jump out of skin. She was quiet and silent with her feet. I turn around to greet her. She started about the Quibbler, she had wanted an interview for the running post and I agreed for it. She then continued to talk of her trip to the Alps (God knows how she survived their with just her cloak and jumper) and the strange creatures she found there. I sort of tuned her out with my head nodding and my throat humming at regular intervals, as I watched Draco and his so called best friend of the day, walk around hand to hand talking to Neville, then Fluer, Ron, George, a quick 'hello' to Rose and then finally to Hermione, who sat on the set out couches with bowls of salad and soup infront of her. I saw Draco hand her a glass of raspberry juice which she happily took (I always wonder how she drank that shit).
"So the ones who come after us don't know anything about you and your team?"
"There! There!" He felt him shiver below him.
Harry grabbed hold of his jaw in a tight grip and bent down at his sitting posture to look him at an eye to eye level. "Gryffindor will not bow down to anyone. Not even this Dark Lord you speak off." He said in a low voice. "And if you're trying to escape some marriage arrangement, you're doing a terrible job at-"
Harry gasped. "you lost it? Draco, I got it made customised for you, and you only. And you lost it? And you're not even wearing any underpants!"
"We need to help him!" He cried out, he tried to pull his hand away but Rowan was indeed stronger than he looked.
He shook his head. "I actually took the potion this morning. These are just side effects."
"A few weeks- a couple of them would work."
He threw another hex at me. I bit my tongue to stop gasping. "I saw a moving picture, but with sounds and it didn't repeat. It was a long moving picture, I forgot what they called it."
"You two timing snake!" Ron shouted from the side. Harry then remembered that he hadn't a chance to say anything to his friends. "I knew you Slytherins were nothing but fucking cowards!" Harry couldn't stop him of course. His blue eyes caught Draco and shivered when he was met with hard silver glare. He walked up to Ron, slowly but surely, swaying his hips which of course  caught the Dark Lord's gaze,    and slapped him right across his face. It didn't have any impact to Ron, he was hard skinned and his face barely flinched, every one in the room knew that, but it was necessary. And Harry knew it worked when a grin slid onto the so-called Dark Lord's face.
Harry looks at the melting ice pieces and  picks one up, to squat down again. He holds the pale ankle and lifts the feet, to rub the ice on the underside. Draco flinches and tries to take his feet back but it was in tight grip. "And how would we arrange all the things for a proper big wedding?"
When Ron suggested Harry to blow of some steam on a rent boy instead of beating their subordinates to a pulpy death just cause of a slight mistake that took place in the raid, and Harry had then relented by calling up the 'whore service', as he liked to call it, to send in a lithe boy with nice arse and nice face; he didn't expect to find his school bully, Draco fucking Malfoy with his whispy soft blonde hair  and grey eyes, wearing nothing but a peach silk robe that reached just below his butt and stretched out like a cat with his legs flying back and forth in the air and grinning at him through his pink lips.
"I just passed by a shop on the way here and thought of just giving you these. Thought you'd like them. Do you?" Draco snapped his head at once before giving a nod. Rose had come by then towards them, and she stared between them curiously.
"She wants to learn the Muggle way too."
That was the main reason he had exiled himself to Muggle world. Two months after Draco was dropped off to the Muggle part of London, Harry had decided that he would too go there. Maybe Hermione was true when she'd said that he had an obsession with Draco Malfoy. He now guesses that it had turned to fascination. Every time he saw a blonde shock of hair in the crowd he would run after that person, but they weren't him. They weren't even close to him. The hair might either be too dark, too light. Their nose would be too plump or too long. They just weren't him. Like that he'd spent three years, two months and five days in Muggle world. He fucked quite enough for his body to keep in balance but he realised that it was always with blonde haired, sharp nosed, pale boys and girls.
"I do! I do!" The blond struggled with his leg, but his husband was way too strong. "Please, My King!"
I narrowed my eyes at him. "Harry. Sit properly." When he motioned to stand, I snapped. "On the floor!" I noticed that he wore his worn out, snitches pyjamas bottoms, when he sat in Indian style. I crawled to his side of the bed, barely feeling the bedsheets tug away from my own naked body, and let my legs fall down the bed and cross one another as I stared down at him. "you're a cheating bastard, Harry. And according to laws I have every right to cast a crucio on you."
"That object though, we don't know." Harry sighed.
"That I want to feel your touch." The hands halted aand grabbed around his waist to pull him closer, it felt punishing and hard.
"That high bastard?" I frowned when he called Harry that. Only I and at times Pansy and Blaise, were allowed to call him that. But I controlled my tongue to I snapped at him, opting to just glare at him. He chuckled at that. "offended? C'mon Draco, he's cheating on you."
"Yes sir!"
"Ron!" He came running towards me. "Get someone to inspect these marks." I point at the blackish slashes on the pavement. "These are fresh. He banged against the bin." He nodded his head and shouted at the other men to do so. A few younger aurors came in.
"I need time, my King. I'm going to bath now." He didn't give him a chance to speak when he rushed to the adjoined en suite. Harry flopped on the unmade bed ruffling his hair with his hand. He cursed himself a few times before standing up and calling a servant in. He whispered something to him and told him to hurry with the actions. The servant nodded and hurried out if the room.
"Why didn't you say anything?" The golf stick dropped to the ground and I could already see more than five bents on it.
"Guess we will find out."
He was hard. He was definitely hard. And he was grinding his hard prick against the smooth edge of the table. Potter might have caught on to that, because he held his hips in a bruising manner and pulled him back. "You're not going to jerk off Draco." He pulled at the blonde hair and made him arch back. "You're going to answer me first. And then I'll see if you're worthy of it."
hearing. Draco felt his heart flutter, and after looking at the deep green eyes he couldn’t meet them again- not even when he met Potter after his hearing to say a word of thanks by repeating
"Are you trying to investigate me?" He managed to let out the few words out of the throat he was sure wouldn't work anytime soon. "Do you doubt I'm doing something dark?"
Then Harry would kiss me and take me from behind.
Draco turned his head to chuckle and let Potter nip at his jaw and neck. "Ten of the same style is a bad fashion choice."
Harry smirked at him. "would you look at the coincidence, we had to meet in the same city, when I am a Mob Boss and you are nothing but a whore, and you're on your knees, literally, naked and servicing me." He came closer to the bed standing a couple of inches apart from the other. "do you remember that evening, when you had me pushed to my knees and punched my nose." He caressed the pale jaw. "Wonder what I can do to your face."
"What?" The hold loosened a bit, but not slacking.
"Of course he is. That's why I sent two groups with you, yet only you came back uninjured." Draco had wanted to say that his arse had hurt all day, yesterday, because of how hard Padfoot had pounded into him; but then decided against it. Roberts sighed and gave him a manila envelope.
"He's with the Zabinis, he wanted to watch a cartooned movie in the theatre and Blaise said he could do a sleepover at their place." Even while her tone was direct and stern, Harry could easily make out hints of fondness. They had both gone on lunch once, during common break intervals, and Malfoy had spent more than half hour talking about her son non stop, and this happened many a times.
The young lad, who had pressed himself on the brick wall finally spoke. "This man was trying to rob me and then even threatened to obliviate me." His voice stammered badly, but he managed. "The blond over there was just trying to help."
Potter grinned,"Well, maybe you have forgotten, but scandal has chased after me since I was eleven. What would the matter be if I chased it for once?" Draco understood what he meant and implied, clearly as bright as broad daylight.
"It's your birthday, next Sunday." I scoffed.
He was cut off by loud rustle of plastic bag in Teddy's arms who ran back between us. "She has a date with Mr Brown. He owns a house near ours, and an apple garden!"
"What do you mean? He will become weak with his name?" The snake didn't answer so Harry took it as affirmative. "We'll let you go, if you don't attack us."
Hermione was worried as well. She had loaded up her tote of bag with heavy books all based on magic and other sources. She was sure the stress of health of everyone around her was taking a huge toll on her- Ron was on the other side of Ravenclaw searching for deadly creatures, her Queen Draco was with a mad and powerful wizard and Harry was diving into a pit of his own anxiousness. But she would admit, the most she was worried about was Ron. The knight although naïve and headfast, was loveable and charming. She couldn't help but remember the times they had hid behind shelves in the knights rooms and around the pillars and behind the trees, stealing kisses from each other whenever they could. He was a knight, she was nothing. Her parents were merchants in another land of a another country. She had fled from there in search of knowledge and experience, who knew she would find love too.
That made Draco sit, his head heavy but no longer dizzy. "I don't want to see him!" He narrowed his eyes to a glare. "I don't want him seeing me too! That fucking bastard!" Hermione gaped at him, more shocked at him swearing.
His green eyes widened further. "It was just once! And you told me you'd keep it a secret." He was going to continue but then he heard Draco groan a bit before opening his eyes lazily. Grey eyes and thin lips smiled at James, but then widened when he saw his husband at the end of the bed. He sat up straight and put his mouth in a pout. "Draco." Harry whispered before clearing his throat and saying his name again. "what are you doing here?"
"I- I am not. Harry, please. Don't put such hideous assumptions about me."
"N-no!" He gasped.
So that night Harry did sleep on the bedroom floor, he was red eyed and achy all through the morning and he even came back home in foul mood. I made it up to him- I joined him in his late night shower and sucked him off, I owed him that and I could complete my side of the bargain. Well, he didn't let it balances, because just after that he fingered me raw as he held me in his arms against the bathroom wall tiles. That made my back achy the next day. He only slept on the floor for one week though, and the very next day he proposed me with a ring with a  diamond as big as a snitch. How could I even say no?
"He can control animals too!" When asked further, Draco told them everything the king had told him, along with the assumption he could make. Harry did get angry as Draco hadn't called him when his father woke up, but he let the matter drop. They hadn't made any progress, but they did find that the Dark Lord's mark could work on animals too. Wolves and snakes were a lot in population in the forests of Slytherin. And that would give him an army of dangerous creatures as well. An attack of his on Harry's own father gave the Prince a new fresh motive to get revenge on this Dark Lord.
"How could you even..."
"We're making cookies!" Teddy exclaimed.  I put him down and he rushed into the kitchen.
"Oh it gets better." He snickered. "I did read a few Batman comics, the man's amazing though. A bit rich."
"You're just going to put me to bed." He rolled his eyes and lifted his arms to either sides. "Merde. Tu es une salope." I quickly unbuttoned his mid night blue shirt, and slipped it down his shoulders and then turned to his trousers. "An old one that too, who's a prude." He lifted his arse up so that I could slide down the pants.
coming with me tonight."
"No it's not alright!" Merlin forbid if he'd let me speak. "How long does it take for you to scribble 'have a case' or 'Kingsley called' or 'Ron needs help'. I don't put a notepad and a pen, not a quill but a sodding Muggle pen, on our nightstand for a decor item." I winced at that and I know he saw it because he continued. "I don't mind you going off for field cases, even on a Sunday, or taking too much overtime or sometimes coming home at wee hours. I don't say anything!"
"I can't do that. I have vowed myself-"
"Gryffindor is protected with forces of all kinds."
"The earring I gave you!" He was seething and I was delightfully unbuttoning my shirt and slipped out of it.
holding the brush in his fingers, a glob of blue acrylic paint threatening to drop on the floor as he was thoughtfully gazing on the half painted canvas, when he heard the door click. He pushed himself up, dropping the brush in the jar of yellowed, murky water turning it a wild shade of  green,  and rushed out of the room to the door. He didn't give the man even a moment to put down his things before jumping on him and yelled a loud "Theo!" He was spun around and placed at the side table, knocking down a plant, glad that the pot was of plastic and not terracotta or else it would have cost them way too much to replace the Dragonpossom and Water-Lilly hybrid he was growing.
"The Dark Lord knows and my father would be killed in two weeks." He mumbled.
"You won't do that, Draco. We both know that." Draco really wanting to slap that grin away. His breath hitched when one of Potter's hand went on to squeeze his arse. "Although, there is a certain rumour spreading around in underworld."
"But Kingsley-"
"You promised to be by my side, always."
"I just need coffee, that's it." He took his tanned hand and rubbed it at his nape. "Here let me help with those." Before Draco could even protest, Potter had his heavy sack of paints and pots in his own arms. Draco grabbed hold of Prince and led them down the pathway. He peeked back to see Potter looking at him, when they reached a small, old building. Draco mentally shook his head and climbed up the flight of stairs, three storeys, then turned to the door on the right-hand side. He whispered the ward spells before slipping in the key. "This looks cosy." Potter said out loud, looking around his small apartment. There were a few clothes on his couch and a few leftovers on the coffee table- Potter must have seen it, Draco hurried to slip his wand out and spell them to fly them in their respective places.
Draco was breathing heavily, he was panting. When Harry leaned back to look at him, Draco's eyes were filled with need. Draco pounced on him, pushing him backwards till his back was digged by the edge of the desk he was just talking about. Draco didn't give him a moment to think, as he smashed his lip on his mouth- kissing with desperation and thirst. He bit on his lower lip, his tongue poked at his own and their teeth clanked against each others. Harry groaned when he felt his tongue getting bit and he pulled back. Draco only had a look of confusion on his face when he leaned forward, chasing his mouth. He pushed Harry back on the table and Harry was poked by pens and paper holders, which was not comfortable at all, but he let it go when he saw the pale man straddle him and removing his belt. He pushed his trousers down, threw them in a corner, and pale knees on the each side of the wide torso. He climbed up to the chest and thrust his hips out. The tip of his cock brushed at the heavy beard before it brushed against the lips. "Suck!" Draco said in a raspy voice.
"And why are you so eager that you've lubed yourself up so nicely?" When he didn't reply he got another slap on his other cheek.
"I'm going to dance." Pansy grinned at me and stood up as well.
"I know. I wanted to tell you long back, I was just so scared."
He kissed behind my ear to whisper. "I am so sorry. I am not gonna fuck you," I whimpered when he removed his fingers and replaced it with his cock, sliding in easily till the end. "I think it's time we made love."
"Who is this Dark Lord? What is his name?"
"Way too nicely. And you're tipsy already. Normal people dance or should I say grind, to get rid of that. Or they drink more. They don't chat to random strangers."
"She would be Ron's sister and one of our wood and wild animals' tamer. She has studied and practiced in a sanctuary of Ravenclaw. She's quite good with reptiles." Hermione said, smoothening the blond hair in a loving manner. Harry cleared his throat from the side and she got the message. She smiled and nodded her head, leaving the room as well. Harry shifted where he sat before moving closer to Draco, still a bit nervous.
"I'm sorry."
He was close, I knew, very close. I just had to pull a couple of more times and he spilled on both of your chests. His walls clenched but I didn't stop. I kept on pushing in and out, and he scratched blood from my back. "Too much! Too much, Harry."
"Yeah! Yeah, I love it, sir!" Harry sucked at his shoulder. This time round he was going to leave marks that would last for at least a week.
He gulped before replying feeling his Adam's apple bob against cold skin of the palm. "I want to feel the power. I want to feel it too, the excitement of the magic even though I don't have any." He let out a small sigh when he saw the thin lips slide into a smirk. His cheek was kissed then, all wet and he was sure there was a purple mark left on his cheek bone, then the lips nipped at his earlobe.
"There was a picture of him, looking at you like you hung the moon for him." Draco moaned when Theo lapped at his neck. "What else did he want?" Draco wasn't able to reply for a few moments for way too many reasons, but Theo was adamant.
"Oh god!" Draco groaned out, when a hand came forward to squeeze his length and then there was a slide of broad calloused finger at his slit. "Please Potter." He tried to jerk into the hand, but Potter's hold was too strong.
"Oh no, Potter. Yesterday it was bacon pastry. That's savoury." Malfoy smirked at him, coming forward to place both the cups of coffee infront of him. "one is with chocolate, be wise with what you choose to drink first." He turned around and walked to the metal drawers arranging the papers in them albeit magically.
"I didn't mean that. I want a baby- but with you. I want us to have a baby together. Talk about, then adopt or surrogate or I don't know - magic stuff." He sighed. "I didn't continue fucking her. I was just spending time with her. Making sure she's fine and doesn't spill the  word around. Coffee, dinner and of sorts."
"I want a promise from your lips, that you'd be loyal to me."
"You can't leave this room?"
Harry leaned in to place open mouthed kisses in her inner thighs, pressing at the joint of the knee way too hard, that it might bruise later on. She sucked at the hip bones and bit at the stretch marks on her abdomen. "You're amazing, Draco." She whispered against her skin. Draco couldn't have heard her with the way she moaned aloud when Harry pushed another finger in.
Draco let his lips meet his husbands. It tasted like berries and tea, and something they just had in the late night feast. He could hear a little bit of hustle, everyone was preparing to sleep. And over here he withered over the tanned body of his Prince. He let his hands wind in the ebony hair and before he could do anything further, he was quickly turned around and his back grazed the wet needles of grass. "my Prince," he groans.
Harry let out a small chuckle, and Draco gave him a grim smile. He sobered himself. "Are you regretting your decision now?"
Harry slammed his head on the desk again. "Ron, I don't care. Keep it down though." Ron did have the tendency to roll words loudly in excitement. He blamed it on strong tea, Harry blamed it on him  spending too much time with Hugo.
"I'm breaking your things. You broke my vase!"
"Really!" He perked and jumped down the table, running to our pantry and brought out the largest red packer could find and shook it in front of me. "But cousin Draco doesn't like when we eat these at night. You won't tell him, right, when he comes back at night?"
"Fine, Cousin Draco." He handed him the packet which Draco took from him, while he took the bowl from him. "I'll pour this on the tray then."
"So you did it seldom, then." The hold tightened around his waist.
"Officer Malfoy meet-"
"Mr Flemming, your wand has a crack in it. That causes your spells to miscast. And then there is a stubborn sense of guilt in your mind, regarding your son. You miss him every moment. You don't pay attention to the proper wordings of the cast. Spells require proper attention." I could have said this in the healer room, people don't really pour our their feelings there though. And this gave me a perfect chance for my own selfish reason. I finished my cake and let Flemming think. I broke him out of his trance. "Can I have a sip of your drink? My mouth is too sweet." He did a nod and I picked up the tea and gulped a small sip. Of course from the untouched edge though. I wouldn't want to kiss his lips indirectly. He was hardly my type, belging short and stout and the ray of pepper hair which didn't really suit him.
Harry wanted to say that he would find out how everyone in wizarding world is doing, if Draco begged like that. He smiled at the pale man and nodded his head. He didn't say anything and went for the door. He was given a small short smile before the door closed. Harry took the steps to the staircase, putting his box lightly by the railing, came back to the door. His length throbbed wildly, he could hear silent chirps of cricket and a faint noise of jazz which Draco or his neighbours were probably playing. He unzipped his trousers, gripping his length and rolled his eyes. He could see the pleading face of Draco behind his eyelids, the long column of his pale neck, the slight redness on his cheeks. He pulled his length back few times and he came onto the wooden door, and it was too much than the previous day. The letter window was covered completely with thickness and  a few long streams drooled down to touch the plastic doormat saying 'Warm Welcome'.
Kingsley had sent his patronus: it was five in the morning and I had my limbs around my husband, when a blue eagle flew in and screeched in Kingsley's voice to get my arse to the office as there was a break in Xello-Ring Case. We had never got any clues to further in the Xello-Ring Case. The last clue was found around a couple of months ago. It involved muggles and police (as well as Muggle army), it was hard anyway to interfere. Xellophilus, an aphrodisiac and halucigen, wasn't just a drug- it was a deadly drug. A couple of uses of this potion and person would be on deathbed. And the fact that this was distributed to the muggles made it much worse. Having properties of magical capabilities, with ingredients which muggles still hadn't discovered, we were at a high risk of getting found out.
"It is but the same thing." He tutted. "Steal, borrow, conquer- or whatever, they imply that it will be mine." An evil toothed grin was on his face and Harry wanted nothing but to punch him straight in his jaw. He was about to say something when he heard the doors behind him open.
"Tonight. In evening." His voice was quivering, but Harry ignored it.
"Mr Potter, I can not-"
The blonde simply looked at him with a raised brow. "Oh, Harry." He called out as if he'd just seen him kneeling on the ground. "It's a pleasant surprise." The Dark Lord wrapped his long arm around him and to Harry's utter shock Draco leaned-
"You good, mate?" He might have noticed the frown on my face along with the way I clenched my jaw.
"And how would I ask him for such, to such a perverted creature?" Sarcasm dripped his voice.
"Yes, God!" He moaned out, clasping at the covered shoulders of Harry and riding desperately on thick fingers. His head fell forwards then, hiding his face in warm neck.
Draco narrowed his eyes. "it would be my duty as your spouse to forgive you whenever you ask me of it. In fact I have no right to forgive you of anything. But I was a Prince and now a Queen. I have my ego as well, pride as well. I'm sorry, but I can't forgive you, my King."
Draco groaned a bit. "But it's hot in here. If I could I wouldn't want to wear anything at all." Harry could feel a stir in his trousers but he restrained himself from pouncing on his husband. Before he could say anything there was a loud hoot from the balcony making him draw his hidden dagger. "That's Snape's owl!" Draco rushed to the bird perched there and held him carefully to bring him in the room. When he saw the look the other Prince gave him, he said with a calm voice. "Snape's my uncle. The alchemist of Slytherin." He placed the bird on the table and put a few crumbs of the bread he had been eating infront of it, and untied the note attached to it's leg.
"I just- why do you even know this though?" I pointedly look at Victor. "Was that a message from Draco?"
I was already dressed up, it gave me ample time that he was quite late, like usual. And that's why I think when he walked through the floo with dust and pink on his cheeks, his jaw dropped as soon as he looked up, because instead of wearing a pair of sweatpants and long pale shirt, I was in tight leather pants, a glittery black under shirt with a coffee brown jacket and dragon hide boots. I made sure to style my hair, so that it looks purposefully messy and soft, I even wore the enchantingly attached silver earring which Harry had got me from that Weasley shop. He blinked a couple of times as he dusted his robes.
"How long would it take for it to get alright?"
I stayed rooted at my place, punching at the wall by my side. "This is
"Who?" His voice was angry when he held tighter around the waist. Draco smacked at his chest.
"Are you gonna take me in?"
"Draco, it's me." I said softly, but I was sure he heard me because he gasped. And I heard his gasp through the wooden doors. There was some sort of rustling behind the doors and then everything went still. "Draco, can I come in?" He didn't answer for a long time, so I tried again. "If you don't answer, I'll take that as a yes."
"Harry, please!" He let go and Draco reached to hold his feet with his hand. "You manipulative brute!" Harry grinned before poking out his tongue and lapping at the air, which made him shudder involuntarily in rememberance. "And they say Gryffindors are true by heart and take the fair way."
"Oh, I thought- Well, what do you do then?"
He cut her off. "I'm sorry. But I need to be excused. My colleagues wait for me and we need to take our  things." That was half a lie. He knew Pierre would be busy drinking his arse off, but his other partner would be there. And he did indeed need to pack everything he had utilised. So he left them, while Granger bit Potter's ear off.
I'm so happy this is done cause now I can write another Drarry fic which I have my mind's eye on since a couple of months. It's more of an adaptation but I'm changing the plot, I guess, a lot. I wasn't impressed by the og plot and I wanted a better and healthy version of it. I also wrote another Drarry short fic, which idk when I'd post.
"Who's the father?" She blinked rapidly and inner me yelped 'bingo!'.
I crunched up to my elbows.  " 'What the fuck?' What the fuck to you, Draco?" His blond brows furrowed. "What the hell was that?"
"Secretly? I tell you everything."
"My majesty." Draco stopped him with a hand on his arm. "you shouldn't force yourself and it's time for your potions." He gave him a smile and slid down the bed arranging the vials and handing it to the older man. "you have to give me two days and your potion would be ready. If I predict correctly, you'd be well in four days from now." James gave him a warm smile.
"Yes. We need to reach there as soon as it can be."
"In the elementary?" Ron quipped.
"Of course not." His hold loosened a percentage. "I'm just worried about you. He might be manipulating you to..."
"Merlin!" I smacked on his hard chest. "you sure do know how to make an arrival."
"Did you see his face?"
"She sleeps a lot." He shrugged. "Her feet are getting weird too."
dream come true." Ron rolled his eyes and gulped down his tea. Harry had barely touched his own, he left it as it was and stood up. "Where you going?"
Draco had clenched too hard and Harry had gone over board with her own simulation. The spell of the protrusion broke and Draco whined openly at the loss. Harry saw her quim grab around the air, so she quickly shoved three of her fingers in, curling them upwards. Pale thighs shook around her frame.
"He's my husband. There's nothing to excuse him of." He sighed. "I'll sleep. I'm ... Tired." She tucked him in. As soon as he closed his eyes he was asleep.
He saw Potter in the corridors of Hogwarts, just a month after re-opening of the school. It was his fault as well, he realized. There were pointed fingers and abused taunts which were thrown at him the moment he had placed his right foot in the Hogwarts Express. Greg had tried to snarl and scowl- he was called the ‘Death Eater Pup’ by a fourth year Hufflepuff. They both had flinched: when Greg tried to pounce on the boy, Draco had grabbed hold his sleeve, shaking his head as he himself looked down at his feet. He said a “Please, don’t” and Greg had stopped right there and then. No one in the Eighth year tried to talk to them, they were either too busy or too afraid to get involved in a scandal – and Draco understood the reason quite well. If he were amongst the others, he wouldn’t have talked to himself as well.
"What?" Harry's brows furrowed. "How?"
"And you're living with him?" Potter said with a warning in his voice. Draco could only blink, he took in his attire and Potter was in a black shirt and black trousers, perfect to blend in with a black night. He couldn't be spotted by anyone of the neighbors even if Draco chose to make a ruckus.
Malfoy looked up wide eyed from his list, then rolled his eyes. "Salazar! It was awful."
"Harry.." Hermione stood up from her side. "you need to calm down. A King shouldn't loose his temper."
"And you're always in my office every early morning when you have a perfectly nice cabin right across the hallway." Harry's voice came out muffled beneath his crossed arms. "and he's late." He glanced at the Muggle clock Arthur had given him on his twenty third birthday.
He had expected not to see Potter for another five years at the very least. Their circles didn't cross, and Draco never really left the area where his flat was in. He rarely visited the wizarding place. He knew Daily Prophet would be having a blast the minute he had left the City Hall, he could already come up with the titles they would have printed. But he forced himself not to dwell on it for too long. He didn't read Prophet after they had written a long essay about his father and how right his life long sentence of Azkaban was, along with Lucius' skeleton like face, on the front page.
And Harry felt like he was totally fucked when he saw the red and blue sirens and wailing "tee-too" of the cars, that he desperately wanted to shoot the cars' tires to puncture. He was meeting for a deal regarding drug import and distribution. The gangs
"Excuse me!" He called out and the old man thankfully stopped. He saw Malfoy widen his eyes like the same owl he might have drawn. "I need to talk to you, Mister..."
"What-" he breathed out heavily from his nose. "You're asking me that?" He  sharply snatched the   pillow from under my head. "What the fuck do you mean? You went limp! Are you getting erectile disfunction? Are you getting senile?"
He gulped. "I know a potion that can heal him. Magical properties are there in his blood. So- the potion can help purify it."
"Malfoy." Harry greeted him with a small smile of his own and accepted the warm cup slid to him. Ron chose the moment to come into his office and fastly dodged the folder which was on its way to the iron shelves. "Malfoy."
Harry pressed the metal seal on the cooling wax. Malfoy never asked for early leave unless something very important had happened. "Is everything okay?" He looked up to see Malfoy's bright face.
I rolled my eyes, slipping off my shoes. "what's got in your arse Harry?"
"Just like his owner." Draco looked up at Potter in a start, his eyes wide and mouth slightly ajar. "It's not bad though." Potter winked at him before sipping the beverage, he made a face but didn't say anything. "Maybe I can get to know him better?" Potter glanced at Prince, but then gazed into his silver eyes. Draco could already feel his heart skip a beat or two, way
"I don't care. I don't want to see you right now. I don't even want to talk to you." I sighed and rubbed at the golden knob of the door.
"Harry Potter, Sir, are you satisfied with it?" The dressing man asked him with a raised brow which made him think that if he said no, he would have to pay him anyway and even face too many scowls.
"Let's just walk away, Draco."
"Draco and I." I sighed before continuing. "We had a.... An argument of sort."
When Greg tried to talk to him about what had happened two weeks ago, Draco had shut him up with a tight sneer and loud slam of the tome he held at the time on to his chubby hand. Greg didn’t ask him of it again, they spent the whole afternoon in the library and Draco could feel the burning gaze of Potter on the back of his head. By the time it had turned evening and Greg had dozed, Draco was sweating profusely with panic and feeling of overwhelm eating away at his bones. He almost shrieked aloud when Potter came and sat on their table. Draco whispered his name and the raven-haired smiled. “Was it him?” Draco felt himself blanche. “Don’t even try to lie- you know you’re a bad liar.” The smile which Potter gave him was much sinister to be even considered as a smile. Draco gulped and picked up his books as fast as he could and rushed out of the door. Potter walked behind, with slow steps that seemed so quick that Draco felt that the boy might have apparated. They might have reached outside an empty classroom, because Potter pulled him by his collar and pushed him onto a dirty wide table.
Draco shook his head. "no! I'm not! Stop it!"
Rushed and quick, I know. Think of it as a fast climax though? This chapter was written thrice. Once cause I lost it again (thank you bad internet connection in country side :') ). Second time turned out bad- drunk bad, and I had to back space 3541 words. The final product, after a lot of editing, is presented to you.
Harry wanted to expose the shit eating grin on his face but he managed to let out a frown. "Why? What happened?"
"I need to go now. I can't direct any suspicions to myself." Harry had wanted to drag the man close to him and not let him go, but he held himself back.  He stood up too, albeit slowly.
"No of course not, my majesty."
"Malfoy." He smiled brightly at him, and Draco just took another sip form his glass to keep him sane. Potter nodded once at Pierre and the old man, the traitor he was being, left them both with a gentle snicker.
people how to paint."
I couldn't speak but that didn't mean Charmond felt the same thing. "He was making out with me. I heard you didn't give him proper attention."
"Yes, it does, Cousin Draco." He shifted on his right leg and placed his arms on his hips, just like Draco had done.
He didn't come back the whole day, he didn't even come to burrow. When Molly asked I told her that Draco was not feeling quite well and she handed me a pot of beet soup as I was leaving. Teddy asked for him too, he turned around to go to play although in a slow manner when he heard that his cousin couldn't make it. I tried floocalling Pansy (I even called her husband's phone), she didn't reply at floo (and told me to bugger off when her husband picked up). The wards were set up too, so I couldn't apparate to their place. Bloody Bitchy witch: Draco would never know that I called her that. I even told Kreacher not to mention it in front of Draco. I slept in a cold bed that night, missing Draco's breath against my neck and his legs around my waist.
"Yes." Green eyes turned bemused. "I was a child!"
Harry regretted the moment the door shut. He wanted to go behind Draco and call him back in, to tell him that he didn't mean any of that, that he was sleep deprived and tired and frustrated at everything which was happening around. He wanted to carry him back in and clean him with a warm cloth and bath with him in his marble tub. He wanted caress his body and kiss all the ache he felt. He wanted ... He wanted Draco.
"Oh! I remember him carrying me all the way to Leaky's so that I could floo." My frustration came back twice as much as before. I made myself take a few deep breaths and calmed down, but. It wasn't his fault, Draco was just being ... Draco. I sighed as I got up to bath. A few minutes under warm water, I felt circle of arms around my waist and a soft wet kiss on my nape. "I also remember asking you for a fuck. My wish wasn't fulfilled." He bit my ear. I chuckled before turning around and grabbed his shoulders.
"I didn't say that. What would Gryffindor gain from this? An heir isn't the issue on the head right now."
When he woke up to a cool cloth on his head. He groaned when he opened his and saw a stern looking Harry. He forced himself to a sitting position but Hermione gushed over him. "Are you alright now? I checked for fever or flu, but it wasn't that."
"It's about Astor." Her heartbeat dropped. "You very well know that he stays out of Britain, most of the time. It is his occupation to make sure that wizards and witches have proper living conditions in their homes- from elves to air quality, to gardening and plumbing. I'm not advertising really, I'm just giving reason as to why it is important for him to be there, with them. And his contacts and business relationship is with people outside of Britain mostly, so I can't really do anything about it, really. I'm mumbling, right?" Harry didn't say anything, Draco took a huge breath and willed herself to continue. "When I got married to Astor, it wasn't because I loved him or any other case. It was arranged by my parents and him. He got martial benefits and my parents got upper standing. Astor is a good man- he really is, and I thought I would come to love him in the years. When I have his child and I spend time with him and his habits." Till now, Draco was looking else where- at the floorboards, the ceiling, the tables and stools or the paintings; but when the blonde looked at Harry, she could all of a sudden feel her heart racing. "It hasn't happened though, Potter." Grey eyes were puffy and swollen and Harry realised how much in agony Draco must be in. But, she didn't know what to say. "And the funny thing is," she wasn't laughing. "It hasn't happened with anyone."
"No." Harry knew he had to shut up then. The more he spoke, the more he would be ignored. He yelped when he felt a pinch of the needle and glared at the man, who too ignored him. "Christ, I'm stuck." He huffed.
Draco opened his mouth to say further, but then wisely shut his mouth. He thought for a while. "I wish to retire." He murmured.
It took him half a day to make the potion with a amount of rush running through his veins. He hadn't made a slight mistake too, unlike his previous potion. He just had to wait for one day for it to brew down and cool till he could give it to the previous King. And by the time he was done, he was also quite dizzy. Bile rose to his throat and he took a large gulp of the water to soothe himself. He needed air, he realised and walked out to the corridor taking in deep breaths. His vision blurred slightly and he leaned against the walls, before he pushed himself down to crouch. He heard the huge doors open and he groaned at the noise it made making him drop his head on his knees. "Draco!" A female voice called him out and there were quick steps towards him and a cool hand on his shoulder. "Draco! Queen Draco!" He groaned slapping the hand away, pushing himself onto the floor- laying down. "oh my god! Ron!" The voice yelled and Draco wanted nothing more to slap that person to quiet. "he's not well! Pick him up!" He felt himself be picked up in huge arms and for a moment he thought it was Harry's, but Harry's arms weren't so stiff or foreign. "let's take him Harry's room." A male voice murmured and he felt the swinging moment as the other walked. Draco blinked his eyes open and he saw the familiar doors open and then the familiar ceilings came into few. He could still smell the flowers and he had to swallow down the bile. When he was laid on the bed and murmured. "throw them out."
"Disgusting!" The animal growled in repulsed state as it shook its fur. Draco fell to his knees with the sudden rush of events. He could smell the acid, all rancid and sour. "All I can smell now is puke. I don't think I will ever get this out of my nose!" It yelled in agony.
It had been raining heavily, regular bursts of lightning along with thunder and heavy drops of water hit the windows of Grimmauld Place, and the house took it all in pride. The wind made whistling tones as it escaped into the house through the tiny gaps of the panes. It would be unamusing for any person to have such a climate at almost midnight, but for Harry it was therapeutic. She was about to tuck herself in- she had brushed her teeth and did a quick wash of her face, she had put on one of her old jumpers and a pair of frayed sweatpants and tied her short hair in a loose bun, even though fringes flew out stubbornly from the band. She was in the kitchen, boiling some water when the loud knock of her front door made her jump. With a fastened hold on her wand in her palm, she carefully walked to the hallway leading to the door. When she took in a deep breath, the door banged again; she held the knob and pulled the door at once, wand outstretched with a hex at the tip of her tongue. But she could only manage a whispered "Malfoy?"
Rowan pulled him, but Draco hardly relented. "You can't do that!" Rowan had both of his wrists in a hold, that also made it impossible to reach his wand.
"Took you long enough." Draco was leaning against the doorframe, he held a whisk and bowl in his hands. "I thought today was an early day off." I picked up Teddy and walked to my husband. "Are you cheating on me again, Potter?" He slurred on the word, I let out a dry chuckle. Bygones were bygones.
"You knew them, Officer Malfoy?" Draco shook his head sternly, telling him to shut up and take him and the other man out of the room.
"Yes. But his guards would be down. He'll not know what has come for him." She replied enthusiastically. "We need to use this for our advantage. The only problem is we don't know his name. He'll still have his magic, if we don't know his name."
"Yes." Harry replied with a curt nod. The King looked at him with a raised brow. "Yes, my King."
And then it struck out. Mouth open and fangs spread wide with venom dripping, as it pounced on Harry. But it never got the chance to near the king. Its head came falling down, tumbling on the dirt, as Neville jumped down with his sword covered in dripping red blood.
"I have never... Never been so humiliated in all my life." His voice croaked out. "Even while the Dark Lord loomed around in the corridors of the castle, would peek into my rooms and glance at me in an extreme manner, while I tried to run away from his sight: even then, I wasn't so embarrassed as I have felt over here."
"My lord, please." Harry chuckleed over him, nipping at his neck before he leaned back to look at him.
He didn't touch any of ours lower body though. When I did try to, he grabbed my wrists in a tight hold and put them above my head, against the headboard. I struggled but he was too strong, damn him being an Auror. He grinned when he mouth a no, his teeth biting at one of my nipples and finger running at the other. I was withering below him, it must have been hours, no ages, as he kept on that with random bites on my waist and torso. I kept on calling his name, at last I sobbed out, shivering with need and anticipation. "please Harry."
"Where were you?" Draco almost jumped out of his bones. He managed to let out a squeak when he turned around as he closed the door, the Dark Lord sat atop the bed in darkness, his red eyes glowing like that of a panther in prowl.
"Father I thought-" Harry was started with his words, but Draco decided to take the matter into his own hands.
"What would you have done then?" Draco leaned a bit up, supporting himself on his elbow, looking at him.
"Shut up!" Draco took a breath again. "What happened to the Beaux leader?"
Blaise stepped forward, bowing before the king as he spoke. "we thank for your kind welcome, King James, but I'm afraid Pansy and I would have to leave immediately. Our duty was to escort Prince Draco to Gryffindor. We must return back as quick as possible to avoid any sort of suspicion created and targeted towards us. The Dark Lord mustn't smell any disturbance cause." He stood up straight and went back to his original position.
"Oui Draco. Merci." I spoke the only two words I knew well enough to pronounce and understand in a quick exchange. I stood up, carried him to the bedroom and dropped him carefully on the bed. I had gone to get a hangover potion for him but when I came back he had already slept soundly. I sighed before slipping in the covers too.
But he was thankful, loved he would like to say, his father for one thing- engaging him to Theodore Nott while they were both nine and ten. It also helped that unlike his own father, Theo had stayed away from the war and its attachments, as he spent his later years in Spain, Italy and France, doing some sort of Muggle-like business. It wasn't successful financially but it had brought in large amount of connections from large business men. It also helped very much that Theo was fit as fuck.
"What happened?"
"Harry," Draco called out. "That is the only way. He would never tell his name to anyone. It is a pact of sort which wizards make. Their names are their curse- the old wizard told me."
It might have been a few minutes, or hours according to Draco. Potter then pushed him back and twisted him around again as he faced the open window. He could see cars and passing people on the road and towers of other buildings just infront of him. There were people working in the building. Draco was thankful for the fact that the window wasn't floor lengthed and any onlooker would only see his upper half.
"But Prince Draco-"
It was Draco's turn to snort. "make it 11." When Harry looked at him as of he didn't believe him, his eyes widened. "what? I was trying to get your attention!"
"The theme?"
I walked by the street, looking and glancing at the glass panes and the sales behind it, when I was pulled by my elbow to an alleyway. I couldn't help but yelp and my heart beat sped up. I was ready to kick the person in the shin, when I breathed out heavily as I saw Harry. And Harry did not look pleased. He looked furious and his pupils were blown wide. "Harry!" I smacked at his chest. "you scared me!"
"Salazar?" Harry snorted.
"Oh, is she not?"
Harry had wanted to say 'Yes,' just to end an uncomfortable conversation. But a few days in the court and talking with stern ministers had increased his patience. "No. Draco." He said. "I had wanted to have a further, an extended speak with you." Silver eyes blinked once, as if saying him to continue. He took the acknowledgement. "Are you well?" He was given a nod. "Draco, please come back to our rooms. I plead of you." Draco looked to the side, the outside view of gardens feeling much more appealing than ever. "From a husband to another husband."
Draco hated his father for his childhood decisions. For telling him that half-bloods were below him and wizards like the Weasley family were to be despised. To not show his emotions even when he felt them clawing at his heart. To call Muggle borns as mudbloods and spit at their souls. To worship Dark Lord and follow his every command. For taking his mark and to make Draco take his mark. For grinning when that evil man hugged him in front of everyone in the ashen ground, while everyone knew he was shuddering in disgust. For putting him and his mother through trials, while he himself had enjoyed his two year lavish stay in Azkaban.
"We'll wash it."
"Really?" The blond pushed the bowl into his chubby hands. "Then you can prepare the cookies for us then. Melt all the chips and make it all sticky."
"So you risked my father's life on it. And because of that he's not getting any better." His jaw was clenched and his lips were pressed thin. "you have played with the life of your former King, Draco. You should be punished for this." He stood up and walked to the window, pulling his trousers in the way.
"We went to the same school." Potter replied with a smile, his voice light and pleasant.
"You know my name..." Harry spoke dumbly.
"No. Just thinking about something."
Harry took in a deep breath and sighed out. She answered Draco by grabbing her by her jaw and kissed and bit her lips until she moaned, all while apparating them to her bedroom, making Draco land on the mattress, her damp blonde hair on her cream pillows. Her knees pushed at Draco's thighs to spread them out before Harry thrusted down her hips then upwards to brush the rough fabric of her sweatpants against Draco's wet folds. The blonde gasped, her thin fingers coming to hold tight the piping of the pillow she laid her head on, biting at her lower lip. Harry pried the abused red skin out of the teeth and lapped at it with her own tongue.
But then he grew up and realised how wrong he had been. How selfish he had been. That helped him gain patent rights in so many cases and even earn his position, so that he could help those who were being unjustified.
Draco moved in with Mathew. It was awkward between them for a week, and Draco had to convince him that he had actually been hypnotised by the deliveryman. After the event with Potter, Draco had washed himself up thoroughly with steaming water and went out to get fresh air where he found Mathew near the stair case. He treated him but didn't really tell him what happened. It had been a month and Draco was getting accustomed with his life. He changed his waiter's job to a different restaurant and even though it didn't pay him like it did with previous one, it was enough. Mathew was a good roommate. He also didn't ask him questions about his weird plants. Thinking of that Draco had planted the plant which Potter had given him in nearby woods and donated the book to a very old and shabby bookstore.
He didn't back down. "Are you two having a row?"
Draco gulped. "No one. Why would you say-" His hair was pulled at the crown and he let out a loud gasp. "Theo!"
She couldn't hold it any longer. She leant back and took off her jumper throwing it to a random corner of the room. Malfoy's eyes were blown wide when she took in topless version of her. Harry said in mirth, her hands coming to hold the thighs apart in a split angle as she started to hump forward,"What are you in a shock for? I'm a woman too, you know." She smirked darkly when Malfoy had warmth cover her cheeks and she looked to the side, biting her lips and her fingers tightening the hold of the pillow cover. Harry continued the same movement for a couple of moments. She felt utterly good, and her own trousers were coated with both of their slicks. She increased the pace for a while, then slowed down to a considerable level, before repeating the action and pace again. She was trying to keep herself right on the high, but never going too much out of it.
"Shut up!" Draco was panting with fear and anger. "get out. Before I call the police on you. You were my friend, so I'm not. For Lord's sake get out!"
I turn around to face a plump woman, her hair cut in straight bangs, dressed in a Nirvana T shirt and printed shorts. "I'm sorry, miss." I flash her my ring finger of left hand. "I'm married."
"I talked to someone. He helped me."
"Healer Malfoy, I don't think you can pass judgement-" there was Robards speaking, but he interrupted by her.
