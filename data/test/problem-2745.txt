“Please, if you need anything,” she pushes her nails in his forearm painfully, “anything, contact me.”
Harry almost steps on a puddle to prove a point. Yes, he very much would like to ruin his trousers.
“I cast some spells to turn them away.” He tucks a strand behind her ear, uselessly; she leans in his hand. “I cannot go back to the Manor now, and I’m sure Father will send someone after me soon, if he hasn’t already.”
Harry, who has walked this path plenty of times since the Truce, pulls two beer bottles out of the fridge and just holds them out for Malfoy to see. Malfoy, the pretentious git, reaches for glasses.
Draco squeezes their fingers and lets go, takes a sip from his cup.
“Maybe the Statute of Secrecy needs to be updated then,” says Harry after too long.
“Well then, let us dance.”
“What are you doing here?” Draco hisses, holding his wand in front of him. It feels very small in his hand, almost brittle when faced with the great animal that is Potter in this form.
“Then now we go to bed. Today is a new moon. Everything but sleep can wait.”
Harry James Potter,
Draco reads about it over his evening brandy, in an exclusive afternoon edition of the Prophet. When he gets to the end of the article, he pours himself a second one.
She reaches in the pocket of her dress and pulls out a package.
Potter looks real and solid on the other side of the table, handsome in the carelessness Draco has never associated with beauty before. He looks alive, not like he crawled out of his grave, wrapped in shroud.
And Potter moves to give him a bit of space, rests his muzzle on Draco’s knee.
Two weeks later, Harry stares down at his reflection in a pool of Malfoy’s blood.
“Okay, so… I can do magic.”
To Whoever-It-May-Concern,
So Harry sits on his couch and reads and thinks and tries not to.
“Ah, whatever, I’ve made dumber mistakes in my life,” the waiter says, and he walks to the exit.
“Ah,” says Draco and finds enough courage to look in his direction, “I suppose I must ask you to point me to the nearest establishment.”
When he straightens up again, there’s a blurry reflection of a phantom in the mirror. Harry turns around, and Malfoy is standing thin and worried in his strict, dark shirt. He’s  ghostly and hollow in the blue-grey light of the room.
Draco does kiss him. Harry melts into it and burrows closer in his arms, burning skin the shelter to his cold fingers. He wants to melt through his clothes and his skin, find a space in Draco’s chest for him to live here. He’s breathless with the need to get closer, to never go anywhere else than his arms.
Draco blinks at Harry; he’s not looking back, still watching the charm, half-warily, half-fascinated.
“Sure. You know the way?”
Malfoy nods and taps his fingers in a rhythm on the table top. His hand looks pale and delicate in the white light of the season, blue veins curling over his knuckles.
“Seriously?”
Harry is already tipsy when the first course floats in, finally melting in his chair after hours spent tensing in his office. It feels like all weeks are long, lately. At his elbow, James is being properly loud for a seven-year-old, desperately vying for Teddy’s attention, and Harry occasionally passes a hand through his wild hair to get him to settle down, with very little success. Any time he attempts it, he gets a smirk from Malfoy, who sits between his soon-to-be-ex-wife and a very quiet Scorpius. He turns to David to avoid it.
“Yeah.” He blinks rapidly. “You’re right.”
And they go home, like nothing happened. Like nothing was about to happen.
“Jesus fucking Christ, I know why I avoid you at all time.”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he says through gritted teeth. His knuckles are white at his sides.
Harry Potter knows that in films, the hero saves the world and is whisked off to his happy ending shortly thereafter. Nobody ever shows him stumbling up the stairs looking for a bathroom, or eating the dusty remains of a loaf of bread or sitting on a step while friends and acquaintances come to kiss his cheeks as he tries to simply breathe and be.
Malfoy clears his throat, after having secured his son at his hip, and Harry is helpless to look up at him.
“Yes, of course.”
Secretly, in the quiet of his room, he thinks that Voldemort’s soul had hid there, quiet and inconspicuous, in the crease of his knuckles. It doesn’t feel right, but it’s the only explanation for the emptiness that swells in him when he is staring at his hand.
“Of course not, I took measures!” she yells. “And what was I supposed to do? Prepare your eulogy? I had no news for two weeks! I thought your father went too far and whisked you off to some grisly looking island to slaughter unicorns or something!”
“Do you have new information about the investigation?”
“Listen, I don’t even know why I’m here. I’m just… I’m sorry for scaring you.”
Harry swallows against the knot in his throat, tries to remind himself that he should not be doing what he is doing. He shouldn’t be alone with a Death Eater. He wets his lips; his mouth feels very dry, too.
The tease of Malfoy’s mouth slides hotly on Harry’s hipbone and comes to rest at the base of Harry’s length, light as a butterfly. Harry groans desperately.
“Here, give it to me,” Draco opens his palm and Harry tips the ring in, sees it shine in the low light. He puts it in the pocket of his shirt, above his heart and rubs the shape of it once.
“Oh my god, Draco, you absolute wanker!”
“No,” Harry amends in a rush of breath, “I know why I came to you, the first time around. I’m just not sure why I came back to you.”
“That’s not why I came back.”
“Come on, my room is this way,” and he tugs Draco along with him.
Drip, drip, drop, Little April shower, Beating a tune, As you fall all around, Harry thinks wildly, feeling a bit out of his body.
“Sorry, long day.”
Harry’s heart does a somersault at the proximity, and the almost-brush of Malfoy’s fingers with his own. He swallows thickly and turns his back (and his nose) to Malfoy to lead the way.
We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.
“Do I have time to change?”
Harry exhales suddenly.
Malfoy Manor,
“It’s not so bad.”
“Alright, what kind of cake are we making?”
Malfoy huffs impatiently, evidently miffed that Ron has to ask for a second opinion on the matter.
“That’s…”
Harry flags the bus down and they get in, not without some confusion from Draco; Harry ends up reaching in his pocket once more and sorting his money out for him.
Harry clenches his teeth; they grind loudly in his mouth.
“I do. I’m making myself more believable to your eyes.”
“Are you kidding me? It’s your favourite subject of pillow talk.”
Harry hates Hogwarts College on sight. It stands tall and unyielding in the dark night, a block of obsidian on the black sky. He scowls up at it, his sneakers whining on the damp grass, his bag digging uncomfortably into his shoulder.
Malfoy nods. “She seems properly stricken and desperate for justice as a loving daughter would be. She admits that they had a difficult relationship, but he was still her father. I can… Understand.”
The bloke looks tired and is decidedly scowling down at him from under the most impressively unkempt hair Draco has ever seen on anyone in the service industry.
Draco’s house (because that’s what the Manor is now, nothing else) is where Harry feels himself truly relax. Not working has been wonderful for his anxiety, but he sheds it completely when he is seated in Draco’s smoking room, a finger of amber liquor in a stocky tumblr, his lover stretching next to him on the couch, feet propped in Harry’s lap.
Harry hits Draco; his blood sings with the rush of adrenaline. It’s alcohol spilled on the coals of his anger and blazing in a roaring inferno. Harry punches and he cannot remember why he didn’t sooner. It feels good to hurt Draco. It always has, even when the horror of Sectumsempra tainted him with the shadows of almost-murderer. It’s almost natural at this point, like a basic need. Eat, sleep, punch Draco.
Harry dips his head in acknowledgement and takes a sip of his drink; he feels like he’s going to need it.
“And what? I divorce, and my wife escapes my terrible clutches at the arm of a Muggle? After people seeing me whisking you away to destinations unknown, don’t you think it’s a bit obvious? Are you trying to set all of England against me?”
Harry, out of his conscious willpower, extends a hand. Malfoy shakes it with a dubious turn to his mouth, but it’s enough to send Harry aflame. It’s enough for a bit of Malfoy’s scent to transfer to his skin and for Harry to bring a piece of him home. He’s dizzy with the idea of it. His wolf pants excitedly.
Harry squirms in his seat, has to stamp down on the urge to shrug. His heart is a wild beast in his chest, crashing in crescendo against his ribs.
“I never really thought about it, I guess.” He steels himself to meet Harry’s eyes. “I just really wanted out,” he adds, more truthfully that he had wanted.
Draco hums, trails his hand over Harry’s chest.
Malfoy looks up and startles.
“Yes, so best be ready by then. Mind your footwork, Potter.”
The kids are pliant after a few too many madeleines and let Draco and David coax them into a guest bedroom for a well-deserved nap. James fights them mildly, claiming that he is too old for naps, but changes his mind quickly when Teddy begins to yawn.
Draco tugs on his curls, gently, more playful than heated and Harry hums in answer.
Harry snorts.
“Yes, of course I am. Now, stop feeling sorry about yourself and tell me about James.It always cheers you up.”
“Don’t fuck around,” he says, half in his beard, before realisation slaps him in the face. “Is that… Corpse Bride? How do you even know a muggle film?”
Draco looks down at the pavement; it’s cracked and a small virtuous flower peers back at him, waving cheerily in the light breeze.
“It’s alright, Uncle Harry,” Teddy says mildly, looking a tad overwhelmed by the glittering setting and the hush of the room.
“Good. Here, don’t move.”
“Ginny is going to get through the Quidditch season, and we’ll see after I guess.”
“You never thanked me for it,” he bites.
Draco blinks heavily and when it doesn’t work, he rubs the sleep out of his eyes with the back of his hand and tries to stitch together a complete sentence. He shakes his head.
It’s in a similar situation that Draco sees it again. It’s glaringly white against the afternoon sun, and doesn’t move when he steps closer. The fabric is solid between his knuckles and gives away without difficulty when he pulls on it.
And Harry disapparates with Ron.
Potter wrinkles his nose and closes his eyes for a second.
Draco is sweating through his shirt (Harry’s shirt, but still), wringing his hands in a nervous knot in his lap. The book lies between them, definitely not levitating at all.
“Yes,” says Ron and he offers his elbow for side-along. Harry stares at it and waits for Ron to retract his offer. A minute goes and he doesn’t.
Silence falls over them; it’s filled with the gentle swish of leaves above, the song of birds and the snuffling of Ebenezer bending down to reach the crisp grass of summer.
Harry nods and watches her get out. The door closes and with it his desire to look remotely interested in what is going to happen to him come morning.
He takes a short breath and throws an arm around Albus’ shoulders. The gesture is unexpected enough that the teenager seems to flicker back in his shell, surprise stretching the droopiness of grief on his face.
“Oh, I see.” Malfoy articulates slowly. “My life is worth less than theirs? I wouldn’t have expected this kind of discrimination from you.”
Harry remains quiet at that, looks at the quiet pub, too early for the rough laughs of football supporters.
“Want my fingers?” Malfoy asks, bites at Harry’s mouth.
“Bloody hell, just come here,” he swears as he hooks his thumb under Malfoy’s jaw, in this spot that always makes him rumble with urgency, and tugs him higher. Harry enjoys the weight of him, settling bony and unyielding over him.
So he doesn’t expect the relief he feels when Malfoy knocks on his door mid-week, unbothered by the multiple Aurors trying to skin him with their eyes, and demands that Harry spare some time.
They dance; Harry wouldn’t call it a glide exactly, because his remaining clumsiness gets in the way of Draco’s habitual gracefulness, but their feet chase each other without touching, and their hands are warm on the other’s skin. The tension unravels in Harry’s chest and he finds himself more confident, more assured in every step, enough to let his body lead on his own and takes a moment to appreciate the crescents cut by light on Draco’s face.
Draco wrinkles his nose and shrugs. trying to do it elegantly this time.
But later that day, Malfoy jumps him at the detour of a corridor and pushes him in an empty classroom, mouth frantic and sharp. At first, Harry is too surprised to say anything. Then he’s too busy mapping the bony reliefs of Malfoy’s naked spine to talk.
Harry looks at the bottle, shrugs and uncaps it to sniff at the liquid. It smells like vodka. He takes a swallow and winces, fire curling in his stomach.
Draco spares him from further conversation and tugs him by the hand through the winding halls of the Manor, until they’re face with the intricate motif of green olive trees on a door, moving in the breeze and Harry is too awed by it to realize that their in front of Draco’s bedroom.
“A Potter, then. Why is there need for a name when you already have one?”
“Harry.”
They nod at each other and Draco makes a show of putting the food on the night-stand and reaching for his trousers. He pushes his legs in them, tacky with sweat and pulls them snug on his hips, buttons them promptly. It’s scorching to be subjected to Harry’s gaze and not feel confident enough to meet his eyes. Draco is red; he knows it.
“Yes, well.” He crosses his hands at his knee. “I wanted some legal advice.”
Potter grins at him and crosses his arms to lean back against his chair.
“Brilliant idea to come here,” Malfoy says haughtily, and Harry has to grit his teeth to keep himself from commenting that it was his idea. “Come on, let’s get this over with You wouldn’t want to ruin my trousers.”
Society always seems to make unemployment such a daunting thing and yet, Harry revels in it.
“Well, Harry, this is where I leave you,” says Dumbledore. “Minerva is waiting for you.”
Harry snorts but doesn’t comment further. They look over the pavement and the scorn of Aurors trying to keep onlookers away. There’s a new rhythm to Malfoy’s pulse, and Harry naturally turns to him.
“You can keep it. It’s vile.”
Harry smiles; it tugs at his split lip and hurts.
“Christ, Draco, dramatic much?” Harry shouts from behind him.
“Do you agree, Mr Bruegel?”
Draco gapes at him.
Harry feels the grin pull at his cheeks.
“Greenhand was rich and mean. He had no friends, his wife passed away ten years ago and he was in France during the War,” Malfoy lists on his fingers. “That doesn’t make him very popular with anyone.”
Ginny grimaces.
“Have you ever quenched my thirst in a moment of hopelessness, then?” asks Draco.
Harry does. Teddy is not that discreet with his affections and is lucky that James is so oblivious. Harry has planned to talk to him about it, sometimes. Draco answers such declarations with a roll of his eyes and a pinch on his arm. He always advises to let young people navigate the dangerous waters of love by themselves.
Draco’s answering grin is interrupted by the swoop of an howl and Hermione swearing loudly. Harry feels uncharacteristically cold when Draco stands up to read the missive. Draco clucks his tongue at it in annoyance.
“Oh, Merlin and Morgana both,” he whispers. He’s found the Saviour of the Wizarding Word and is half in love with him.
Harry sits in the large chair in front of the desk. He sinks a little bit into the leather cushion, engulfing him comfortably. It brings him close enough to smell the amusement on Malfoy, a new wave of embarrassment settles over him, hot and red.
“I never talk about James with you.”
Draco snorts. Pretentious.
There’s small tarts on a floating tray at his elbow, courtesy of the Malfoys’ house elf and Harry sighs in contentment.
“Tea.”
“You can tip him back in his box now,” Draco says slowly. Harry looks ashen and shell-shocked, and Draco’s not quite sure how to respond. He knows that his own reaction is flight, not fight. He’s not sure how to reassure Harry and doesn’t think that sex is going to cut it this time.
Harry.
Malfoy, ever polite, gently shakes his head and seats himself, leaving the man in a standing position of power.
“Maybe the beast seated on my couch!” Mr Bruegel growls, trying for menacing. The sounds of his heartbeat has him landing on desperate instead.
“Good day, Malfoy.”
Draco is mildly tempted to take another shower before bed but the idea of wrestling with Potter (who would probably get separation anxiety from how the things are faring) is too exhausting. He would lose any way, he knows it, he already tried it once.
After long distracted minutes, he finally gets the courage to look up and say, “Can I take this back home?” because he actually wants to read it and have the occasion to close this case. He cannot do it with Malfoy so close even if leaving has him ache everywhere.
Harry kicks him lightly in the ankle.
They shag in the morning and eat an award breakfast next to Erica, Harry’s silent flatmate, then shag again, and once more in the shower. They eat another awkward meal with Tommy this time, and Draco dutifully makes appropriate small talk only to be met with monosyllabic grunted answers. Harry goes to work and Draco tags along and finds himself in the same seat as the day before, drinking the same vile coffee, but feeling ten times more settled. He’s wearing a pair of too short jeans from Harry’s dresser and a shirt that itches at the collar but he cannot find it in himself to be bothered by the lack of fashion. His bones have been rattled around in his body and put back in better, more efficient places and so he doesn’t grimace at the acrid on his tongue or the greasy coating on the table.
Harry presses himself against him once more, and Draco opens the circle of his arms to welcome him and kisses him, again, and once more when Harry disentangles himself to lie on the bed.
“I gather that her dates went well?”
“Did they let you call someone, then?”
“Listen, stop, pause. No, I’m not… I mean, yes, I am. I just. I just mean, you’re cool.” Harry looks like he wants to hit himself very, very hard. He takes a big breath. “I like you. And, okay, fuck, I’ve known you for three days, sure, but I like you. And you don’t know what to do with your life, and sure, you have lots of dramatic baggage. But there’s Oxford, where I’m going to be next month, and that’s not a bad city. But I want to know: do you think you would like to move to Oxford sometime? Soon?”
“Just hit myself.”
Harry nods, rubs at his beard.
He snorts.
The figure doesn’t move.
“I wouldn’t want to worry you, but our sons have taken to each other like a house on fire.”
Harry turns to Malfoy who manages to look haughty with a blooming black eye.
“You’re a citizen of Wizarding Britain. I have all the authority.”
Draco feels himself tighten with anticipation, sees Harry flush crimson, and deeper again after a few seconds. He squeezes the hand he is holding and feels Harry jump rather than look at him.
Draco tuts. “Nope, not talking about bad things today.” And then, more mildly, “you could actually quit, you know. I would take care of you.”
He shrugs; Harry blinks at him. It feels so unnatural to see his shoulders move this way.
There are holes in the walls of the castle, and Harry looks through them as he wanders. He sees the morning creep through the fog, and the sun lose the bleak quality of murder at dawn.
Draco, baffled by the muggle currency, just gives a few bills to the man and watches him gape like a goldfish.
They dance, molten touches that caress, insistent fingers in the dip of a collarbone, sharp nails through tangled hair. They kiss, bright and wet, and the music beats a rhythm in the small space between them. They thrum as one, gasp their next breath from the other’s mouth, melt where they’re joined.
Draco yawns.
Harry shakes his head, rakes his brain for an answer to that. He doesn’t have one.
“Thank you,” he says and she echoes him, awed and so powerful.
The full-moon comes and goes. They do not dance. They do not dance because reporters are crowding Harry’s doorstep, and his chimney, and his windows and his pipes (yes) and so Harry is too busy dealing with all that and three screeching children. The children are not screeching because of the divorce (they were only very distantly aware that their parents were married after all) but because howls are tapping doors and windows alike and the noise is very upsetting in the middle of the night.
“You’re unnecessarily aggressive. I thought we didn’t have to talk about the fact that we’re here for Teddy and Teddy alone.”
Draco tightens his hand around his wand and viciously spells his windows shut. He sways out of his office and down the stairs, checking on the wards, who are still dormant as they were earlier. He stumbles out of the garden, and it’s still here, unmovable and standing.
“Yes, well. I should get going then.”
“Yes. Alright.” He stands, gathers his bag on his shoulder. For a second, he pauses, to look at Harry, watches his face like he’s looking for something. Harry doesn’t know if he finds it.
Harry snorts. He doesn’t remember being this sarcastic at seventeen.
Draco grits his teeth.
“It’s not working,” she says. Harry shakes his head, feels the tears cling to his eyelashes. “This marriage is not working.”
“Did you slip me something?”
“What’s that?” he asks, voice rough.
Draco would like to say that he’s above such childish antics, but he presses on, faster. The knots in his chest dissolves with his hurried steps.
Draco nods, two deep movements of his head. He steals Harry’s glass where it’s laying forgotten in a precarious balance on the arm of the couch and downs it a swallow; the smoke is thick when he exhales and Harry simply watches it dissolve between them.
“Another?” she asks.
“We would simply like to discuss some details with you and your wife. My partner, here, might offer some new insight to the situation.”
“Sure. Let’s get some tea.” He looks over Malfoy’s shoulder, at the belligerent open space and adds, “You okay with going outside?”
Harry’s honesty and emotional vulnerability must have soaked into him over the short days they have spent together, because the small confession leaves him feeling gutted and too raw for public conversation.
“Morgana’s tits, you’re never hearing the end of this.”
Harry takes his keys from the night-stand. He is careful in pushing the letter aside and it makes the hand around Draco’s heart relax infinitesimally. Harry nods twice to himself before turning around. He’s opened his door and has a step outside when he turns to speak.
“Here you go.
“Don’t forget to pay,” he helpfully says, and when Draco rolls out a bill at random. “That’s way too much. Christ, where have you been living?”
Speechless, Draco can’t do much but pant at Harry, and lets himself be rolled off onto his side.They look at each other without touching any more, the heat of the room and the sweat on their skin stealing focus as desire retreats.
“That’s why we’re here. He shouldn't suffer from our inability to hold a conversation peacefully. We should be cordial when with him.”
“Are you alright, mate?”
“I thought your Father had killed you and fed you to the peacocks!” she shouts over the wind.
“James?”
Pansy is aghast; she gets her wand out and throws a Silencing Charm around them. Everything quiets and there’s a ringing in their ears, more an absence than an actual sound.
The sign on the door is a curved band of gold writing ‘Malfoy’s Private Investigation’ and Harry takes a short breath in, lets it sit in his chest until he aches with it and knocks on the exhalation.
Harry tugs him by the hand, or maybe it’s Draco, and they leave. They apparate, tangled, into one of their rooms (Harry’s, but it’ll take him several hours before he realises it) and they lose grasp of time.
“In the future, I would have to think of the kids, but. Yeah.”
Harry shivers.
“I’m not asking for your hand. We… We could cross this bridge when we get to it.”
“No one really respects it, though.”
To Malfoy, Secretary to the Head of the Department of Mysteries.
They lapse into silence and stare in opposite directions. Harry feels the quiet press on him, almost regrets the Mufflatio he cast when they sat. Outside distractions would be very welcome now.
He’s gone before Harry has exhaled.
Malfoy looks miserable the next morning at breakfast. Harry stares and waits for him to stare back. It doesn’t happen.
Harry makes to turn around, but stops, takes a breath.
The reality is that he missed Malfoy. Harry had not felt such comfort as he had when Malfoy had ruffled his head and scratched his spine with his short nails. He’s almost ashamed to have taken advantage of his canine appearance to bask in the comfort of human touch.
“Listen, we don’t even have to talk to each other,” Harry says and brings the fag to his lips once more. It’s good; it calms him down. “Let’s just smoke and go back inside, all right?”
“If you can keep your colleagues in check, I can be cordial with you in front of Teddy. Not before.”
Harry squeezes him, smiles small and secret.
There’s a hesitancy that Draco cannot shake from the first kiss; it’s little more than a brush of lips, and the quiet rasp of Harry’s stubble against his chin, but it lights a fire in the pit of his stomach. He cannot help but push himself closer, sliding a hand to the back of Harry’s neck. Draco’s thumb grazes over his pulse and elicits a moan Harry tries to swallow; Draco presses into him, parting his lips to eat the noises that spill out.
“Oh. Yeah, me too.”
And Malfoy leaves, pushing the Silencing Charm aside and striding with purpose to the door. Harry lets his head thump on the table.
Potter licks his lips and looks away.
They fall into silence. Hermione stares, flushed with alcohol.
“Listen, I really don’t want to talk about it right now.”
Best wishes,
Draco Malfoy,
After, Harry tucks an arm around Draco’s torso, sick with nerves at the idea of being rejected or have Draco roll over and away. But Draco only jerks minimally and tugs him closer, gets a hand around his shoulders. He listens to his breath and heartbeat, brushing under his ear, the sharp bump of his shoulder against the curve of his head.
“Alright, erm, drinks.” Harry says, resolutely and strides out of the room.
“I know. Well, actually, I know nothing about you, but I get it. But what about the money thing?”
Draco nods once more, looking down at his left hand. He stares for a long second.
“Oh,” Draco says, laying his hand next to the representations for comparison.
Harry nods, puts his cup back in the tray to link his fingers with Draco, almost painful in their grip.
This line of thought has a sourness bloom in his mouth and he turns back to his book. He wonders what he’ll be able to achieve if he continues on like this.
The smile deteriorates, sours on this lying mouth. Draco gets closer, grabs at the long black robes that cover the intruder and feels the threads dig in the tender skin of his fingers.
Malfoy looks up at him with wide eyes before nodding. It’s a short movement of his head that makes light spill on the silver of his hair.
Harry looks at him from the entryway, kneeling to tie his sneakers.
Draco nods and clenches his hands together in his lap.
The fabric evaporates between his fingers, mist pouring over his knuckles and Draco stands in front of nothing. The grounds are laid flat and untouched, the grass dark in the moonlight and the roses gleaming like diamonds between their thorns.
“You’re unbelievable,” Draco rasps difficultly. It rings in the space between them.
Harry.
He doesn’t go to sleep for a while.
“Could I use your Floo?” he asks through gritted teeth.
“You’re not scared of me. I did bite you.”
“Yes.” I thought it was Voldemort’s absence for a while, he doesn’t say.
“I will,” Draco answers and pulls her into a tight hug, doesn’t hide the way he longs for her affection. She presses her hands at his back, molten warmth suffusing through his clothes and he ignores her sniffles in his shirt. “Alright, alright, I should go. I have a few rounds of Apparation to go through.”
“Daddy?” comes from the carpet and they jump away from each other; Harry hits his head on the door frame and congratulates himself on not swearing.
Morning is not as hard as Harry would like it to be. He’s embarrassed to open his eyes and have the crystal clear certainty of Draco’s body next to him. He would like to throw the blame on alcohol or ill-timed madness, but he knows that it’s not possible. Sex with Draco Malfoy is long time-coming, almost prophetised. It’s the glares above the tables in the Great Hall, it’s the painful punches in times of peace, it’s the knowing look over a cup of tea. Harry could only resist so long.
Draco’s eyebrow goes higher.
“How did you get here on the grounds?” he asks imperiously.
Draco is suspiciously cautious when he settles back next to Harry, tray between them and Harry props himself against the pillow to study him as he pours them a drink in delicate china. Draco avoids his eyes when he gives him his tea and Harry puzzles on what could have provoked such unusual coyness in him. It was definitely not the sex. The sex was wonderful, as usual.
Harry licks his lips and feels himself sagging. Ginny doesn’t say anything.
Draco opens an eye and sees Harry peer back at him, lip caught between his teeth. They both laugh.
“The first cup is enjoyed for warmth, not flavour,” he says with absolute certainty and Harry finds himself nodding along, convinced despite himself. “The second is where you can begin to add sugar; no milk, not yet, that’s for the third.”
His hands shake, he’s barely keeping hold of his wand.
“What happened to your finger?” ask Ron suddenly and Harry feels his heart trip over itself on his way out of his ribcage.
Albus comes to the Manor two days later, looking empty and wan, like a flame drowning in wax, sputtering to keep going but in the end, unsuccessful.
Draco has to untie all kinds of knots in his throat before answering.
“Yes, it’s a no,” then shakes his head, his hair falls over his eyes like an ethereal curtain. “Ah, well, I’m going then.”
On the next full moon, Harry is careful. He locks the doors and windows with charms, cuts his floo connection to everyone including himself and goes the extra-step to manually lock himself in his room. There he unwraps the posh and soft paper the potioneer always sends his Wolfsbane potion in and winces through the taste.
“Not going public with your resurrection then?”
“God, yes. Yes, I would love to,” he kisses all over his face. “I would love to, but…” Draco tenses, Harry props himself on his elbow to look down at him. “The kids have school tomorrow and I promised Ginny that I would get them to school awake and excited for knowledge.”
“Oh, yes, of course,” Mrs Bruegel says and steps aside to let them in.
“If you say so, Malfoy.”
Harry feels himself swell with alarm; he stops moving entirely and straightens up to look Draco in the eyes.
Malfoy is smiling back at him, teasing, looking calm and mildly blinded by the autumn sun. The air smells wet around them, soggy leaves that no longer crush underfoot. Harry blinks. The vision doesn’t go away.
“What is the next step?” asks Harry.
“Alright then, Potter, let’s try to break the Albus-Scorpius coalition,” says Malfoy, tucking his hand at Harry’s elbow.
Harry smiles and nips at his throat.
Witches (and Wizards) across the United Kingdom are worried that the boy turned saviour is wearing himself down.
“Yes, Parvati.”
Harry has to blink back tears and dabs his mouth with the back of his coat. He puts his cup down and resolves himself to never drink anything when Malfoy is talking.
Draco flinches and urgently looks back at Harry in recognition.
He smiles at her, trying to ignore a whole pan of his vision.
Malfoy doesn’t answer him; he looks back at Harry speculatively. Harry wants to bend his head and lets Malfoy rest his hand at his nape, an echo to simpler communication. It’s a show of trust that Harry is not sure is warranted but that he wishes to give all the same.
“I did not think you would be,” Malfoy continues when Harry doesn’t answer.
“I wouldn’t know what kind of depravities you get up to, Malfoy, I’m not interested in learning about those.” Harry winces. “Don’t put images in my head.”
“You can thank Scorpius for that.”
“Really, Harry? You would think that almost a decade since graduation would have calmed you down. It would be funny if it weren’t pathetic.”
“Come on, let’s go to bed,” he says and ignores the way Potter rubs himself against his legs when he stands up.
, “you all.”
Until he sees it again, under a great oak, white and gauzy against the picturesque background.
“You’re free to protest in the morning, after everyone’s got a good night of sleep.”
“Draco, you’re alright, he’s not here. He’s not going to hurt you.”
“Fucking hell,” whispers Harry against his lips, “yeah, like that, please.”
“Is this where…?”
Malfoy looks back at him amused and pushes the door open further in affirmation. Harry takes his coat, and they leave.
“It doesn’t and that’s why we’re doing this today,” he explains to his son. Harry stops and gives a double-take at James. “Is that a skirt?”
“So, let me get this clear, there a magical secret society which I saved when I was a year old by defeating a Black Lord-”
Harry snorts, too bitter to be amused.
He makes a face and turns to Potter. He cannot say a word that his mouth is covered his mouth once more, palm against Draco’s lips.
“Professor, what a good surprise!” says a tall boy, large smile stretching his face with delight.
“Yes,” Harry says simply, waiting for Draco to say what he wants to say.
“I’m not married any more.” Draco brings Harry’s hand to his lips and kisses it. “We signed yesterday,” he whispers between two knuckles.
“I just… What the hell?”
Draco had no plan and still doesn’t have one. He fixes a helpless gaze on Harry and waits to see if an answer arises.
Harry doesn’t know what to say, so he keeps quiet, lips firmly pressed against each other. Merlin knows what kind of pitiful noise would get out of his mouth if he didn’t.
Harry pacifies her with a wave of his hand. “I take no offense, ma’am. But I don’t think that’s it.” He takes a breath and leans forward, elbows on his thighs. “Where were you on the day of Mr Greenhand’s death?”
He dances for a long time, pays for another drink, too expensive but sweet as dawn. He kisses a stranger, short and fleeting before letting the crowd take him once more. He dances again, closes his eyes. When he opens them, Malfoy is staring back at him.
Draco swallows, cannot speak. It seems to amuse Potter; he quirks a smile at the corner of his mouth.
“Urgh. I’d rather not.”
Harry strides in, tie hanging unravelled around his throat. Teddy startles so bad, water sloshes over the rim of his glass. Harry only looks at him with vague amusement.
Harry James Potter,
“Right.”
“You were expecting a crisis?” Harry asks, breathless and achy, feeling the panic of saying it out loud settle between them.
They do not share a bed any more. Ginny fills hers with Luna’s strange flights of fancy.  Harry fills his with the warm touch of anonymous men. They’ve never been happier together.
Malfoy blinks and nods, pale eyelashes catching wetly. Harry leaves, fingers burning, heart squirming.
Harry exchanges a glance with Draco.
He feels like this bonding business should make him more anxious; it doesn’t. This evening is not very different from the ones when Draco decides that he needs answers to a question, let it be Harry’s or his own, as inconsequential as they may be. Harry enjoys the coolness of the high-ceilinged room, the sight of the glittering shelves and the way light reflects in Draco’s hair.
“And you don’t have any of your golden Gryffyndors with you when it’s around?”
“We’re baking,” Ron informs him when he gets back.
“I’m not into this kind of stuff,” he pushes her hand away. “Malfoy happened.”
It takes a long time for Draco to calm down enough to apparate them away.
(Order of Merlin, First Class, Head of the Department of Transfiguration)
She’s up in a second, guiding him to a seat next to the fireplace and pushing him down, flashing a light in his face, hands gripping his tender chin with too much force for his bruises.
“Where are you staying?” asks Harry.
Harry sighs and rubs at his temple, tries to ease the tension there. He lifts his hands to his head, but feels his right wrist being yanked down immediately. He blinks at it.
Harry waits for the silence to settle before turning to Mr Bruegel. “Would you say that you’re an anxious person?”
“Okay,” he breathes shakily. “Okay.”
He has his own office and a secretary who nudges a cup of tea and crumpets at his elbows when he skips lunch. It’s good. It’s enough.
“So, how can we mess it up?”
“What do you mean?”
Harry wakes up to pounding on the door and copious swearing. He opens his eyes just in time to see Malfoy smack him with a bag.
Draco shakes himself out of it first. “Help me take my wedding ring off, then.”
“Hopefully,” Harry agrees and tugs Draco in for a kiss.
You were a coward and a git, but you do not deserve Azkaban.
Harry groans from the confines of his arms and straightens to hide in his hands. There was one such pub night with Weasley; it didn’t go well and nobody is eager to reproduce it.
Harry nods, hands in fists at his sides. He wants to rage at her, scream in her face and tear her throat with his blunt human teeth (so much sharper since she bit him), but he has nothing to take from her. She’s already lost everything.
He died today, he thinks wildly, and sits down in a fit of giggles. He laughs so much that he’s crying, and he smears grime in his eyes as he wipes them, gets his fingers tacky with black tears.
Draco is drinking the worst coffee of his entire life when the muggle talks to him.
And there’s that.
Draco gives him the room across from Scorpius’, with the wonderful view to the front gardens and the great fountain at the center of the driveway, where rainbow fish break over the water in great splashes of colour. Albus thanks him with a nod from under his monstrous unkempt beard and settles there.
The second is elegant enough for Harry to take a wild guess and say that it’s Malfoy’s. He opens the window for this one and shoos the other away.
Ginny gathers the bedsheets against her chest, eyes wet.
“No.”
It’s a half-truth, but Harry cannot voice what he really wants. Pack is not a thing Ron and Hermione can understand. He doesn’t either, not really. He knows that there’s strength in numbers and that his wolf is at his happiest when surrounded by the warm touch of others. But he doesn’t know how this new part of him can translate to their friendship, which seems so brittle now that Ron and Hermione are engaged.
“The sex is wonderful.” Draco closes his eyes, frown deep between his eyebrows. “You’re not answering me.”
It’s pushing one o’clock when he apparates close to the Lizard Point, and he has to shrink back against the sharp wind off the coast. He gets his wand out and readies himself to cast a Revelio when he’s assaulted, pushed face-down on the ground, a weight pinning him down.
Potter trails after him all day long after. By midday, Draco turns into his seat to look at Potter leaning against the window and asks:
“I wanna be with Albus,” pipes Scorpius from their knees, steadily looking at his father.
“Well, not as such.” She purses her mouth. “My father was not a good man in any way and he was awfully bad-tempered, but he never did anything vicious enough that would warrant a response of the sort.”
“Oh—Draco Malfoy, I welcome you into my home.” Harry feels the wards shimmer around him.
Albus, unhappy to not be the centre of attention bellows and slams a wooden spoon on the table.
Draco wants to protest but the waiter walks very fast and so he follows. He only has enough breath to answer.
Even now, he feels the bubbly embarrassment of too much, the crimson flush of being at the mercy of victors. It’s still fresh and it smarts, but Draco tries to breath through it. He swallows his drink and winces; he has maybe drunk too much for the occasion. Better go to bed before he has to ask Mimpsy to roll him around, or worse, that he starts to sloppily reminisce about Hogwarts.
“You weren’t risking your life,” he says sharply. “That’s not how I meant that.” Harry deflates, takes a long breath in to settle himself, to swallow back his defensive anger. “It just… hurts. The transformation is loud. I don’t… I don’t want anyone having to sit through that.”
“Hello?” he asks, voice weak.
“Hi. Sleep well?”
Draco slides his hands from hips to thighs, grabbing and demanding. Harry grinds to feel and yes, Draco is hard and interested, ready to go again. It’s an easy feat to rise on his knees and arch, to reach behind to take Draco in hand and feel the heat of him burn Harry’s palm. It’s easy to sink on him, still open and wet from their previous activity and feel the buzz of white pleasure zapping along his spine.
“What are you doing here?” he asks, still bleary.
Harry smiles; it feels ill-fitting on his face.
“Looked, I believe he did not die long after my seventh birthday.”
Malfoy licks his lips; it makes Harry’s blood sing. He looks away and closes his hands into fists, feels his too sharp nails sink into his palm.
Draco is at loss. Last time he saw Potter under this canine form, he hadn’t let him in by choice and Potter had categorically refused to leave, tagging along with Draco everywhere, pushing at his hip with his muzzle. He has half a mind to forget that anything happened and go back to his book, but he cannot leave a giant werewolf pacing in front of the Manor, sending pebbles through the gates with the agitated shift of his front paws. Not when the closest muggle village is, in fact, too close. Who knows how Potter reacts to muggles.
Pansy looks back at him unblinkingly, before nodding twice, short movements of her head.
Harry shrugs.
“Do you get off on the infidelity, then? Is that it? Is that why you get down to the level of us poofs?”
McGonagall purses her lips.
“So they might have a chance of winning this year,” answers Harry to Ron’s latest woe.
Harry scrambles out of his seat to join Draco, he smells of his expansive cologne and the fragrant curry he ate earlier. He leans over his shoulders to look at the book.
Harry swallows, voice tied by desire, knot pressing against his Adam’s apple with each maddening movement of Draco.
“Well, good day, Potter.”
“Aren’t we?” retorts Malfoy, drawing a circle in the condensation of his glass with the leather of his glove.
“They just…” He bites the inside of his lip, feeling like a great betrayer. “They’re just so entitled. So quick to jump to conclusions.” He sighs and takes a burning sip when Draco nudges his cup toward him. It burns through some of his frustration. “They never do anything truly reprehensible, but they do not hesitate to humiliate, to tear someone’s dignity to shred, I’m…”
Harry flushes, feels the heat spread from his collarbones to his forehead. Too late, he goes to cover himself with his hands and only gets an eyebrow raise from Malfoy. He’s got half the mind to turn back into a wolf if only to gather back the shredded pieces of dignity, but he’s fairly certain that’s not possible, even this close to the full moon. He should not trust his canine self anyway. He makes questionable choices.
Harry pulls him in by his shirt, kisses his smile, sharp and purposeful, gathers him close until they’re sharing heat and breath. Draco pushes his wand under the pillows before they roll around on it and closes his hands over Harry’s shoulders.
Potter-not-Potter softens under his hand, melts under the sharp probe of Draco’s fury.
Harry was in charge of the investigation. He’ll probably bring it to you when he comes back from his honeymoon.
“Stop playing,” he says and pushes his fingers in Malfoy’s shoulder to urge him, down or up, to do something.
“Okay.”
“We’re handcuffed,” he says, voice rocky with disuse.
“Sorry,” says Harry, “I’m actually not used to… this.”
I thank you for your thoughtfulness. Please, pass my gratitude to your son, Scorpius enjoyed the drawing.
Once he has gone over it twice and deems that it doesn’t read as pathetically home-sick as he feels, he presses sealing charms and a few boobytrap curses into the papers. Pansy’s mother has always been an awful little snoop. Then he quickly pulls his shoes on, goes out onto the small, lichen-ridden patio shared between the surrounding buildings’ tenants, and apparates to the small wizarding village of Wimbourne.
Dear Potter,
Malfoy turns to him, eyes wide. He opens his mouth to say something, but Ron steps up to them. Malfoy doesn’t speak.
“Yes, of course. My wife knew him best,” he says placidly.
Malfoy Manor, Wiltshire, England
Harry nods soundlessly; he touches at Draco’s forearm with the faintest of touch and sees the shudder that courses through him. Harry wants to press his fingers in the veins here, feels his pulse beat against his thumb. He wants to speak, but doesn’t know what to say, doesn’t know what would preserve the moment. Draco wets his lips and Harry feels himself fall apart.
She takes a careful sip of her tea and looks down at her hands with a wry smile.
As it is, Potter rumbles low in his throat, pushing against Draco’s hand until he’s properly scratching at his head.
“Of course, we wouldn’t want to taint your untarnished morals.”
So when the white figure appear on the grounds again, under the blinding light of a full moon, Draco pales with his hurry to get to it before any of the boys can lay eyes on it. The breeze sways the fabric over distinctive calves and the relief of a hand and Draco runs down the stairs and across the grass, feeling the sharp blades under his bare feet.
“Alright.”
“Draco,” and there must be something in his voice, because Draco turns around in a second to face him.
“Sure, uh, I come back around two in the morning, and I don’t have work until three pm, so…” Draco tries very hard not to look alarmed. Harry steels himself, face going hard. “So I could make you breakfast.”
Harry looks at Draco with his very green eyes.
“Shut it,” Harry answers, but it lacks bite.
“I’m willing to wait and see. What’s your name?”
He pats his jean pocket, feeling for his wand. Malfoy notes on it and tries to cross his arm; looks incredibly inconvenienced when Harry keeps his own at his side.
“I… Well, the reasons why I ran away from him.”
“Certainly. That was the case until Mr. Potter transferred here.”
“Good.”
“And what? We fuck and you go back to do whatever you’re doing for Voldemort? Was the fucking part of your mission?”
“I may not be young as you are but I’m still a witch in my prime! And Draco will be delighted to assist me.”
Draco apparates back to the apparition spot closest to Harry’s apartment, and walks briskly in the dark city, feet floaty and pavement uneven. To sharpen his focus, he has Harry’s keys clenched in his hands all the way until the bedroom. He drops them unceremoniously on the night stand, which rouses Harry and kisses him all over his face, which finishes in waking him up.
Harry is not yet asleep when Draco presses in behind him, too close for the summer, and whispers in the tangle of his hair, almost wishing for the words to lose themselves in the dark curls, get trapped in the locks.
Malfoy Manor
“I guess I’ll have to owl her to know. It would be a shame if she was the one to ask for a revision, really.”
Without much surprise, Potter is the one excitedly barking at his approach.
Harry slowly obeys, seems to wind tight, spine rigid with tension. The dragon circles them once, twice, before hovering above Harry’s palm. Draco cups his hand, red and hurt, under Harry’s fingertips and keeps him steady.
Harry swallows, pushes his hand in the space between them to ground himself.
“They’ve been used in Wizarding courting rituals for a long time; they symbolize love and honesty and balance and were often used as a medium of proposal.”
“Oh really?” Malfoy purrs, stepping closer. It’s not attractive, Harry tells himself.
“There’s this…
“What’s the point of telling you what you already know?” She sighs heavily, just like she does when she looks at one of James’s messes. “Do you want me to fix your face?”
“Do you want me to show you something else, now?”
His stomach does a flip and once more to right itself. Harry gapes, and Malfoy looks at him with a raise of his eyebrows.
“Merlin,” Draco says, when he has found his voice once again, “Pansy you cow, I told you not to contact me. Has anyone followed you?”
Harry refuses to exhaust himself by being outraged at the usual lack of human decency.
“Tripping?”
“Please,” he asks and reaches to call for lube. The bottle jumps into his hand and he reaches back for Draco to take it.
He shows up at the Ministry in a scourgified shirt that might be a bit too creased and trousers that might not be as clean as he had initially assessed. People turn around as he walks through. It might be because he’s Harry Potter; it might be because he has not bothered washing his hair in a few too many days.
Malfoy gives him one of his sincere smiles, and Harry wants to backtrack, pluck his words out of the air before they get to Malfoy.
He has trouble identifying what it is. Banshees usually prefer to present themselves shrouded in black. Draco gets the impression of an humanoid shaped under a white sheet, a statue covered from prying eyes. It raises goosebumps along his arms.
Ginny’s face hardens, hard planes under the flame of her hair.
Potter-not-Potter only smiles at him, a wide show of his teeth and the crinkle of his eyes, terribly unfamiliar to Draco, only ever seen in pictures. There’s a similar expression on the photograph in one of his guest room. Albus, Draco thinks and feels anger flood his chest, raise the beat of his heart.
Potter shakes his head.
“You’ll laugh, but the MLE has lost it before an expertise could be conducted.”
A great number of people need to mourn Harry; Draco knows that he doesn’t have a right for grief today. The dirty looks he receive only confirm that.
Malfoy frowns.
Auror Ron Weasley.
The glasses are dropped to the floor. Harry has just enough presence of mind to send a cushioning spell their way. He doesn’t check to see if they broke.
It takes a few days for him to relax, but Draco is glad to have him here, close enough to see him eat and sleep, blue-grey shadows disappearing from the tired creases of his face.
Draco has to put a hand on his mouth to stop him and Harry sighs in relief. They don’t speak for a long while, frozen like that.
“Hello,” he says.
“Well, some would call me a God.”
Draco shakes his head, grinds his forehead in the collarbone here.
Later in the night, woozy with drink, he steals a cig from a good-looking, dark-haired giant and slips through the side door, checking over his shoulder so that no sober person sees him cast Incendio.
Harry shrugs, drinks his tea. It’s still warm and settles on his stomach pleasantly.
Alcohol sounds like an excellent idea to Harry, a good distraction to his canine desires. He cannot really get drunk unless he empties the bottle (and a few others) all by himself, but he won’t be unaffected.
“Well, if it were that relaxed, maybe you would succeed at making it hover.”
“Yes, go, you vile muggle-loving man,” she mutters, half-hiding behind a hand. She waves her wand and the charms disappear, filling the space between them with the roar of the sea, the screech of the wind.
“I’m not the one drinking it, am I?”
“I don’t see Edward around.”
Please confirm your attendance with Draco Malfoy, Secretary to the Head of the Department of Mysteries.
“Alright?”
You are invited to the retirement party of Gareth Greengrass, Head to the Department of Mysteries, on Friday, 27 of January 2006 at the Department of Mysteries.
Then they do not have to wait any more and they’re in the master suite. Draco presses against Harry, intent. Harry’s mouth stretch on a laugh, aborted, and they stay there, too close for a casual discussion but not yet willing to cross this peculiar bridge.
Harry stands up, feeling ridiculously more naked.
“What crisis were you expecting?”
“It’s perfectly alright. Our magic seems to be compatible. It’s not a bad thing.”
“Sure. Oxford. Good idea.”
Draco looks at her helplessly; he has no clue how to answer her question.
Ron and Hermione come and go,replaced by Neville, Ginny, and surprisingly, Seamus. They press in his sides and it digs in the aches there and Harry tries not to wince, but the pain swells and swells, until he cannot bear it any more and he stands and walks away. No one follows him, and it’s a fresh relief rushing through his head.
“I’ll be back soon.”
Harry is halfway through a negative answer when he realizes it.
Draco sniffs. “Astoria and I have an understanding, not that it concerns you.”
Draco scoffs.
“Whatever do you mean?” he asks airily, rubbing his thumb over a dark spot on his cup. This establishment is a pigsty and the thought fills Draco with glee; it would give Lucius an aneurysm if he ever came to learn about it.
“Can I turn the light off?” he asks finally.
“Bedroom,” he answers, and swallows Draco’s response with a biting kiss.
Harry picks himself up and doesn’t answer, squirming to not give Malfoy an eyeful. Malfoy doesn’t seem concerned by matter and placidly watch Harry stumble to a standing position and fly from the room.
But then steps echo and bounce on the old stones of the corridor they stand in, twisted together and Malfoy pushes him away and Harry’s skull smarts with the violence of it.
He grabs Harry by the elbow and promptly apparates them away.
“Merlin’s beard, Potter, everyone and their mother know I’m a homosexual and that this marriage is purely decorative.”
“I’m not in the habit of divulging my client’s private information.”
Harry smiles, unable to stop himself.
“It’s okay, Uncle Harry,” Teddy says, looking very formal in his small robes and bow-tie. Harry would bet a large amount of money this farce was all Malfoy’s idea.
Draco bites the inside of his cheek, but cannot stop the words from spilling out. They taste bitter. “And why did you, then?”
Draco walks back to the Manor and tries not to let his worry consume him. He fails.
Draco pushes the tray aside; the china rattles as it slides on the bed. He pulls himself closer and climbs in Harry’s lap, sweetly tilts his head back for a kiss. His breath is warm and sugar-sweet and Harry arches his neck to meet him, eager to lose himself in Draco again.
Draco Malfoy, former Death Eater, was seen in Diagon Alley this last Monday after seven years spent without news in the United States. He was accompanied by his only son, Scorpius Malfoy. The staff at Witch Weekly offers all of our sympathies to the young boy for the passing of his mother.
Tommy looks at him for a long, unblinking second before sighing and standing up.
Harry straightens up and lays a hesitant hand on Draco’s shoulder. He doesn’t shrug him away and so Harry squeezes him gently, trying to convey reassurance and affection. They breathe together for a few minutes.
“And do you think she’s the marrying type?”
Malfoy groans in the next kiss but shifts to dig in his clothes, leaving half of Harry cold and shivering. He comes back with the Hawthorne wand in his elegant fingers and has to sit back, out of Harry’s reach, to cast the spell.
He goes to class with sore purple on his collarbones and hunches his shoulders in the showers so that no one remarks on it. He seeks out Malfoy for entirely different reasons; carnal desire lights up his blood when he sees his name on the map. Harry tries to look inconspicuous and go on with his life: he eats, he sleeps, he can’t remember his homework, he walks into doorways. Hermione looks at him with worried eyes but says nothing.
“We can’t say that you’re not efficient. Not even twenty-four hours on this case and you’ve probably solved it. You should work for me.”
Malfoy shrugs his shirt on. Harry feels defenseless where he is, naked and seated on the floor, Cushioning Charms fading under his legs.
In Malfoy’s neat script, there’s an address and the time of the meeting. Harry has an hour to get ready.
“Nothing. I have more interesting things to talk about.”
“Thinking of me.”
“Astoria wishes to tell David of her situation before taking any legal step in dissolving our marriage. You understand that a divorce between two families of the Twenty-Eight is bound to make a commotion; we do not wish to put Scorpius through that if it isn’t worth it for her. And the Statute of Secrecy clearly states that one should be espoused to their significant other before revealing the truth of their upbringings.”
“Yes, I expected you to react like that. As always, you do not disappoint, Potter.”
Harry opens his mouth to biting teeth and the tearing pressure of anger, his hands digging in the furious slant of Malfoy’s shoulders, seeking an anchor here. Kissing Malfoy is so much pain and yet, Harry cannot stop. He licks blood off his teeth and presses in between the furnace of their bodies like every breath is in an implosion, dragging him closer every time.
Between two tree trunks, Draco sees it.
“What the… Oh, bloody hell. You think I’m-” He looks Draco up and down, and he tries not to squirm in his seat, tries not to flush under the obvious interest that he sees in the green of his gaze. “Is that why you were… Oh, whatever. Are you with the mafia?”
“Of course,” says Dumbledore and Harry doesn’t turn to see him go. He shoulders his dread along with his backpack and drags it inside.
Draco looks at him briefly, doesn’t linger on Potter’s openly honest face. He clears his throat and turns back to his reading. The words swim in front of his eyes.
Harry’s room is a cramped little space, barely enough room for the double bed and the night-stand, but he manoeuvres them both in and closes the door behind Draco.
Draco is helpless to tell him what to think; he himself has never been very proficient at it either.
Harry looks gobsmacked. Draco walks away from him, strides long and purposefully fast; if nothing else, Draco has spite on his side and he will use it.
Harry smiles at him.
“You looked…” Harry picks at a loose thread on his jeans without looking away from him. “Never mind.”
The build is slow, pulling Harry toward his orgasm in small increments. Harry feels it. It builds and builds and builds, pushing at his organs to leave room for the fire that burns in his loins. Harry almost fears that he will explode; he reaches for Draco, takes a hold of his hand and bites, not viciously, but with intent. Draco moans a strained song in his nape.
“Common? Yeah. A common name for a common bloke, I guess.”
“Are you only waking up now?” he asks when he finally sees Harry. “Well, way to let go of yourself, Potter.”
Malfoy hums and makes his spoon clink on the china when he stirs some milk in his tea.
Draco promptly takes his wand back, feels heat flood him from toe to hairline.
Harry does. He makes a face.
He would be flung beyond the limit of his body if not for the firm hold Draco has on him, circling his wrist and the round curve of his shoulder, keeping him there, bones rattling. Harry is only perception. He feels the burning breath of Draco at the curve of his jaw, wet and warm and turns his head on instinct, steals an open-mouthed kiss. Tastes the want on his lips.
Before entering the magical post, he changes his hair a rich shade of black, not unlike Harry’s, and puts some patchy whiskers around his jaws. Draco has always been good at Glamours, but he still feels sick with anxiety at the idea of someone seeing through them and calling for his Father, and so he applies two-layers of charms on his face and checks his reflection twice again to make sure that he assuredly does not look like himself.
Harry rolls onto his stomach, lets Draco pin him like that, spread over him with all his weight. There are hands at his ribs, the sharp prickles of teeth at his shoulders and the burning length of Draco against him, dragging silky-soft against his skin in small aborted movements. Harry feels close to combustion.
Draco lets out a relieved sigh and tugs on the hand he’s holding; Harry follows, compliant.
Sauvignon blanc, medium glass x1
“Accident,” corrects Malfoy and Harry looks back at him alarmingly. “The Aurors in charge of the case ruled it as accident. His daughter asked me to take another look.”
So he’s left wandering through the Manor, looking for family or friends he’s authorized to see. Harry hopes that Hermione has cast a chilling charm somewhere in a room so that he can take a breather. His legs hurt from the running-around he has done all morning long. He never thought that a formality wedding could be this difficult.
“Merlin and Morgana,” gasps Draco. “You feel so good.”
Mrs Bruegel’s eyes fall on him, and she retracts her politely offered hand with a spasm. She holds her wrist as she has been burned. The gesture cuts sharp on Harry’s tongue. He can almost taste copper.
Harry doesn’t have room to move and lays there, panting open-mouthed against the sheets, hands scrabbling to find purchase. Draco is a giant wave that crashes upon his shores in long continuous strokes and Harry struggles to breath through it.
The restaurant is quiet in the way that only very posh restaurants are, and the silence of so many people is unnerving. Harry feels like he could cut the tension with a knife as he walks in. He straightens his shirt and wand holster at the wrist and tries to look clean and put-together, not like he has run through the Ministry Atrium to get here on time after work.
“Right,” Malfoy says after he has settled on Harry's couch (and doesn’t that make him warm, seeing Malfoy makes himself comfortable in his own scent), “according to my investigation, the Strangler was his own.”
He shrugs, bony shoulder briskly moving. Draco has spent most of his life trying to look unbothered, too mature to throw a tantrum and he recognizes it in Harry’s posture.
Draco slides between the cool sheets and sighs in relief at the bone-deep relaxation that settles over him. He turns on his side to look at Potter and repeats slowly, “No bed.” Potter seems agreeable enough to the idea and lets himself fall on his side, stretched in his entire length on the carpet.
He stands up and goes to turn away, leaving Malfoy’s piercing stare behind and the need to get closer that pulls at his sternum.
Malfoy snorts, and Harry blinks at the sound.
