Forcing all thoughts of James Potter out of his mind, Severus began his demonstration. For the following hours, his focus was on this potion alone, occasionally answering additional questions from either Draco or Harry, who both seemed to be able to follow quite well. They had just gotten to the last part of the brewing process, in which the potion had to simmer for a full hour, being stirred at the exact right intervals in the right direction, before the final ingredient would be added all at the end, when a sharp pain flared up in Severus’ left arm.
One hand still in Harry’s hair, keeping him in place, Draco used his other hand to push off the sink, turning them so Harry’s back was against the wall next to it. Harry’s arms came up around Draco’s waist, pulling him closer, and Draco felt Harry’s bulge pressing against his own rapidly swelling erection.
“I would never leave you just because they think you’re—”
actually who he really was? What if that was just Harry’s influence and he’d revert into the cold Malfoy heir his father had crafted as soon as he was on his own again? He didn’t
After a quick check in the mirror, he took a few breaths to steel himself, then went to go find Harry.
Sirona commented, distracting Harry for a moment.
“It would be my pleasure, Harry.”
“I don’t know, Harry, but I’m sure there’s an explanation for this. Just try talking to him again tomorrow, after your lesson.”
It ended as suddenly as it had begun, and the creaking and crackling of Grimmauld Place filled his ears again, thoughts streaming back into his mind. He still felt the tension lingering in his body, but he could breathe again.
Severus gave him a bewildered look, especially when Harry reacted by rolling his eyes dramatically.
“Goodbye, Severus. I’ll see you at dinner.”
“Right, you probably spent the summer at the Burrow.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He kept his attention on his defence now, as Harry hailed spells on him. Strong spells. Strong enough that Severus felt his magic seep from him after barely a few minutes, and he hadn’t gotten in more than a few sporadic attacks himself.
Severus nodded and watched impatiently as Albus left. As soon as the door fell shut he let out an exasperated sigh.
Narcissa laughed, but Severus’ eyes widened and for a second Harry regretted his words.
“Rubbish,” muttered Severus angrily.
“So,” Hermione began again as she had after leaving the robe shop, “what happened between you and Malf— Draco?”
Harry cringed a little and tried to change the subject by asking about everyone’s O.W.L. results. It worked only partially, since Ginny and Luna hadn’t taken their O.W.L.s yet, so it was really only Neville musing whether McGonagall was going to accept him into her N.E.W.T. class with only an A.
He extinguished the lights with another wandless command, then tightened his arms around Draco, wanting to keep him as close as he could, just to enjoy drowning in him a little longer.
“The healing books?”
“I know it’s disgusting,” he mumbled quietly.
“I didn’t aim it at you!” Harry defended himself. “It worked out just the way I wanted, it knocked you off your feet so I could disarm you. Don’t look at me like that!”
“I’m looking for Trevor,” Neville responded without turning around, then dove back under the seat. “There you are!” He emerged, holding up his toad triumphantly. “Sorry, hi Har—” Neville broke off as he turned around, frowning. Harry couldn’t fully suppress a laugh as he watched realisation dawn on his friend, brown eyes widening comically. “Harry?!”
“Malfoy,” he said coldly, hoping his face hadn’t betrayed his feelings.
They climbed into bed and, after Harry extinguished the lamps, snuggled into each other, Harry using Draco as his pillow this time around. For a few breaths they lay silently and Draco relaxed into Harry’s warmth curled around him.
“I can tell him, if that’s alright with you, cub. You don’t have to explain it all again,” he said, putting a hand on Harry’s shoulder.
“Draco, we gotta get up,” Harry chuckled, running a hand through Draco’s hair.
“Tell me your thoughts.”
by. And then Lily chose James and I had one more powerful reason to hate him.”
She waited patiently, as he sorted his thoughts, trying to decide what to ask first.
“Have you spoken to Severus at all yet?”
“Yes?” he answered cautiously.
Harry pulled back and gave him a surprised look. “What?”
After sending Hedwig off with the letters, he turned his attention back to the books Kreacher had brought him. The last one he’d been reading was an old volume, beautifully bound in leather, with the title
Pansy stared at him for a second, then chuckled and sighed, “I suppose it could be entertaining, yes.”
“You don’t agree with Voldemort’s blood-supremacist ideas.”
“No, he told me himself and Harry isn’t the type to lie. It makes sense now, why he’s always worn such shabby clothing in the few instances in which he wasn’t wearing school robes.” Draco grimaced. “I ridiculed him for that, I can’t believe I was so stupid. I always thought Harry Potter must’ve grown up adored, basking in fame; I fear I’ve been dramatically misguided in that belief.”
Draco laughed as relief spread through him. “That’s fair, Granger.”
“You’re welcome, sugar, happy birthday again.”
It was a good point. Fortunately, Harry had already gone over this with Severus during the summer.
Draco frowned and squeezed Harry’s hand. “Maybe he’s just in a bad mood? Not that that’s a valid reason to treat you like that,” he added hastily, “but it might not actually be because of you.”
“And what good would the Dark Lord’s trust do me if the Order believed me a traitor?” Severus argued, containing his anger as well as he could. “Judging from your reaction, you meant to keep this a secret, or am I wrong?”
He dug out the mirror and called Remus.
She seemed to struggle with herself for a moment, before glancing at Snape. “Severus,” she said softly, causing the man to wince, “you can’t tell me you don’t see it.”
“Hm? Sure, but not now. You said there was something else?”
The rest of the group uttered their goodbyes and Draco made his way across the common room to the sixth year dorms. He was already at the stairs when someone almost bumped into him.
Severus was once again caught by surprise. He hadn’t known Harry was thinking about reviving his club that he’d started to defy Umbridge. Albus was considering Harry carefully, and again Severus could almost see the wheels turning in the headmaster’s mind.
“Yeah, mate, you really have. I’m not saying it doesn’t make sense that your perspective on things has shifted, with the prophecy and all that, but you can’t deny that you’re different. You never talked so nonchalantly about killing before at the very least.”
“I am perfectly serious,” Harry insisted. “You know why? Because if they make me choose, they’re not the people I thought they were. Why would I choose someone who tries to keep someone I lo— care about out of my life?”
“But—”
The crowd moved, and Remus followed Harry against the stream and over to the outdoor landscape, the mass of students never touching either of them as if they were pushed away like same-poled magnets, creating a little bubble around them. Harry drew up a ward behind them once they reached the natural terrain, shielding the crowd from any stray spells.
“Wrackspurts?” he asked hesitantly, unsure whether he really wanted to know.
Harry opened his mouth, but Narcissa spoke first, “Harry, would you join us for tea? I would like to get properly acquainted with my host.” Even as she spoke, she moved towards the dining room with a graceful confidence that made it seem like Harry was a guest at her house, rather than the other way around.
part of Harry’s body. He bit back a groan at the thought, trying to rein himself in.
They kept up the idle chatter about the house while Harry finished preparing tea for the three of them, before finally sitting down at the head of the table, Narcissa to his left, Snape to his right. It felt like an odd position to take, but he wanted to sit neither directly next to Narcissa nor directly next to Snape. Once more, he wished Remus was home so he’d have someone on his side—whatever that side was.
Severus pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed resignedly. “Yes, I suppose she does. Fine, I’ll talk to him…soon.”
“Keep a seat free for me?”
still mean thoughts or emphasis as they did from the beginning.
“If this is a joke, we yield our entire shop to you,” Fred chimed in, wiping tears from his eyes.
“You could simply happen to come to my office during Harry’s detention sometimes,” Severus offered. “We could all have dinner together.”
The shimmering shield settled between them before Harry turned around to face the room—and let go. Draco wasn’t sure how long Harry was firing spells at the already battered furniture, but by the time his fury seemed to abate there was not a single piece left unbroken. Draco had to admit that he was impressed by Harry’s skill. He barely had to use a spell twice to take apart the entire room. Panting heavily, Harry eventually fired one last Reducto at the biggest piece of what used to be a couch, reducing it to splinters and loose stuffing. With a long exhale, he sank to his knees, looking exhausted. Draco wanted to go to him, only to be held back by the shield Harry had placed earlier. Frustrated he pressed his palm against it, not wanting to agitate Harry by breaking it down. He was about to speak up, but Harry must’ve felt him because he turned his head with a weak smile and waved his hand, cancelling the spell.
“Of course,” Harry replied evenly. “I told you last time already that Draco is a part of my life now, he won’t just disappear again.”
“You’ll have to ask him yourself, it’s not my place to tell.”
“Harry, dear, how can you be sure that they did not manipulate you in some other way?” said Mrs Weasley, who Draco discovered with shock also had her wand out and aimed at him.
Has it been way too long since the last update? Yes. Is it because Whumptober stole all my dopamine for two bloody months? Also yes.
Remus took a deep breath and launched into his explanations.
“I— I have this note for Blaise Zabini,” he stammered, hastily handing Blaise the note before hurrying off.
“Harry,” Draco admonished.
And he was gone in a heartbeat. For a moment Harry just stared at the door he’d left open behind him, trying to comprehend the situation. Then the same diffuse pain as the day before came rushing back into him, only ten times worse. He couldn’t breathe. Couldn’t think.
Harry’s white teeth flashed even in the mostly dark room as he smiled at Draco.
“Yes, well, we’ll see I suppose,” he said evenly. “With the higher level groups I want to cover a wide variety of jinxes, curses and other offensive spells, as well as duelling strategies specifically. Knowing spells is of no help if you can’t use them effectively in a fight. Remus and Raven taught me a lot over the summer, though I’ll stick to Remus’ curriculum when it comes to spells.”
Hermione could, of course. Harry considered raising his hand, now that he was finally able to answer questions in this subject, but Hermione’s excitement at seeing—and more importantly, smelling—Amortentia made him decide against it. He’d already smelled the potion when they’d practiced it at Grimmauld Place—he already knew it smelled like broom polish, treacle tart and
That got a small smile out of Severus. “I suppose you’re right.”
Remus thought. Obviously, he had missed quite a few things that had changed between the two, far beyond superficial civility.
“Thanks.”
But Harry just shook his head mutely, eyeing the scroll as if it was cursed. Draco’s mother sighed and moved to stand in front of Harry, looking up at him, as he stood at least a head taller than her. Still, Harry seemed tiny in this moment, his expression looking like he was completely lost.
As always I hope you enjoyed it and thank you for reading.
“And what about me?” The words slipped out against his will. Severus’ eyes widened marginally, barely enough to notice, but Remus saw it. Instinctively, he listened for the man’s heart, for his breathing, and found both accelerating. It gave him enough courage to continue, “You were afraid I’d drop you because Harry didn’t need you, what about you dropping me as soon as your relationship with him is stable? I thought we were friends, or did I misunderstand the meaning behind our hour-long talks every evening? You didn’t just abandon Harry, you abandoned all of us. Even Draco, who you’ve known and loved his entire life. How can I be sure you won’t leave
The grief of Sirius’ death, combined with the shock of the onslaught of revelations about his parents had taken a toll on Harry. The first few days after they had done that ruddy spell during breakfast had been torture. Locking himself in the hidden library, Harry had spent hours trying to read without actually taking anything in. He’d ignored anyone he came across, only allowing Remus to talk to him behind closed doors in his room. He didn’t have the energy to care about anything or anyone, as he was thoroughly overwhelmed with…everything.
Back at Grimmauld Place Draco claimed the bathroom first, quickly showering and fixing his hair, before letting Harry have his turn as he went to pick an outfit. In no time, he was dressed and ready, lounging in an armchair and waiting for Harry. When he finally emerged, Draco’s breath caught. He was wearing a dark green silk shirt and black trousers, both tailored to perfection, the deep yet vibrant colour a flawless match to his eyes and contrasting beautifully with his skin. It
A split-second later Harry appeared in front of him, discarding his Invisibility Cloak on the floor and pressing up against Draco who was now trapped between Harry and the sink digging into his back. Harry’s smell washed over him and lightning shot through Draco’s blood as Harry pried his lips open with his tongue. He tasted sweeter than usual, like he’d just eaten something sugary—they must’ve had dessert with Slughorn—but underneath the sweetness it was still
“A few, perhaps,” he said slowly, still somewhat reluctant to fully agree.
“Harry, look at me,” Severus called softly. “I’m alright. Everything is fine.”
It was a response his mother had drilled into him for years. She had insisted that a deserved apology should simply be accepted, not diminished by soothing away any potential guilt with phrases like “it’s alright”. Severus certainly seemed to appreciate the approach, judging from the slight smile tugging at the corners of his mouth.
“Shopping? I’ve literally never gone shopping before in my entire life, except for school robes.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m not moping,” he quipped, smoothing over his hair. One must have standards.
“You wouldn’t have found it,” he said neutrally. “I always have it with me. Don’t want to risk it getting stolen, you know?”
His mother had glamoured Harry’s scar, leaving his forehead smooth and unmarred. Draco had to resist the urge to run his fingers across it, to see whether it would feel different too.
“Like what, make it bouncy?”
Severus hesitated for a moment, considering what to put into the message. He had already decided to have Harry pick up Sirona right after the feast if possible, simply because it would be much harder to explain her sudden appearance once term was already well underway. The only question was how to get Harry to his quarters without raising suspicions.
Harry beamed at him and kissed him again. It took longer this time before their lips parted again, as both of them seemed to lose themselves in the sensations of wandering hands and dancing tongues. Harry’s hands came to rest on Draco’s hips, pulling him closer as his mouth left Draco’s, wandering down to his neck. A small gasp escaped Draco’s throat as he felt Harry’s teeth against his skin, biting down gently just below his ear. A wave of heat went through him, and before he knew it, he had pushed Harry onto his back, sliding on top of him.
“It’s a simple heritage spell, it works by matching the magical signature of two people. I’m sure Narcissa and Draco could demonstrate.”
“I don’t know what to do without him,” he choked out eventually, struggling to collect himself.
They stayed unmoving for a moment, then Harry reluctantly dropped his arms and nudged Draco so he could step away from the wall.
“Of course,” Severus said softly, mentally preparing himself for what was about to follow. “Unfortunately, there is one more thing we must discuss.”
Severus’ black eyes were hard as he practically hissed the last words. Remus nodded empathically, he could understand the sentiment to a degree, but that didn’t mean he wished the Longbottom boy any ill. Severus took a deep breath and his eyes softened a little, the hardness replaced by something that resembled exasperation.
Harry was saved by Ron barging into the compartment and grumbling loudly about how hungry he was as he entered, closely followed by Hermione who was rolling her eyes.
“I— I am afraid that if it comes down to me or them, you’ll choose them,” he admitted eventually, closing his eyes as if that would prevent anyone from hearing him.
They still sat in their usual seats—Remus in the first chair on the right side, Narcissa in the second on the left—instead of directly across from each other.
Thanks to
“My point is,” Pansy interrupted their sniping, “that you usually care about everything to do with Potter. You got into a fight with him in the first ten seconds you two were in each other’s vicinity, but not a single word about him since—not even when Dumbledore announced that DA thing. What happened when Snape ordered you to his office?”
Harry had to bite the inside of his cheek to stop himself from bursting out with laughter. A malicious grin flickered across Ginny’s face.
, belying his usually cold demeanour. He forced himself to stay firm.
In contrast, Grimmauld Place was incredibly interesting, if not quite up to Draco’s usual standards. The most intriguing question of all was
Apparently he did let it go so easily. Severus nodded, bracing himself.
“Just before.”
A glance to the side confirmed that Gr— Hermione had turned her attention to Weasley who was leading her away quickly, and Remus was still caught up in his conversation with Severus and Charlie. For all intents and purposes, he and Harry were as alone as possible.
Severus gave an equally breathless laugh. “Was it that obvious?”
“Ready.”
“You’re not going to give me a speech about school nights?” Harry grinned.
colourful. It was larger than Snape’s and rather more erratic in the way it shifted, branching out wildly at a much faster pace.
“Give it a rest, Mum, it’s just a snake. I’ve got a friend who has a Boomslang and it would never hurt him, and he isn’t even a Parselmouth.”
“—and it suddenly hit me again that he wasn’t always a spy for us. He used to actually support Voldemort, and it made me so
“Well, not Sirius then,” he conceded. “Who else was close to Lily? Close enough to have an affair with her go unnoticed?”
“People like us?”
so I wouldn’t have to hear him pretending to hate me.”
“That’s not what I meant—”
When he climbed into the bath a few minutes later, the water was scalding hot—perfect. He could feel his tired and from his transformation irritated muscles unknot and relax. With a sigh, he sank deeper into the water. The only thing missing now was— With a flick of his wand, he summoned a bar of chocolate and happily ate a piece. Yes, perfect.
“Fleur? What’s the big issue with Fleur for you to call her Phlegm?”

“Even if it would push Harry away from you?”
As they both spoke the incantation a faint glow lifted from their chests and quickly turned into two bright, pulsing shapes of light floating in front of them. Colours danced around them as strings of magic shaped and reshaped themselves, forming ever new patterns.
“You are having me on,” she coughed eventually, a look of utter disbelief on her face.
Harry took a deep breath. Where to begin? How much did he really have to say? He couldn’t keep it a secret forever either way, and latest when summer ended, everyone would know.
“Was it as bad as you feared?”
The expression on Hermione’s face was one of pure and utter disbelief.
“Did he…say anything? About…me?” Severus asked hesitantly. He was clearly nervous, probably expecting Remus to give him confirmation that Harry despised him.
He glared at her, but conceded eventually, returning to his seat at the head of the table where Harry usually sat. Narcissa sat back down as poised as ever, always in perfect control of herself. Severus had always admired that about her, even back when she’d still been at Hogwarts. He’d had originally met her through Lucius, but in the end, she’d turned out to be the better friend and a much better parent to Draco. And despite the fact that her fiancé—and eventually husband—had been the opposite of discreet about his relationship with Severus, Narcissa had always been kind to him. But her kindness was not to be misinterpreted as weakness, the woman could be lethal if she so desired. Now, her anger seemed controlled, but Severus knew that this didn’t mean that she wouldn’t retaliate. Indeed, when she spoke again, Severus could practically watch a plan form behind her eyes.

, making Harry shoot upright instantly. Last time the wards had felt like that, Severus had arrived cut open and covered in blood. Ignoring Draco’s mildly offended confusion, he jumped off the couch and dashed to the door. Within seconds, he was halfway downstairs, when he almost ran straight into Severus coming out of his potions lab.
anything new — he’d always done what was necessary to survive. Or to save others.
“Apparently Harry’s well-being was more important,” Narcissa replied, smiling widely now.
And since Draco was just one door away, he was literally stuck in this room forever now, because he couldn’t risk opening his door. Maybe he could teach himself to apparate, then he could at least visit the library downstairs. He had found an abundance of very interesting books there, ranging from obviously very dark magic to extensive tomes on healing. It had occupied him for hours on end, day after day. That was, until
“Sadia, this is Harry Potter. He has my permission to access these rooms whenever he wants from now on, the wards are already adjusted to admit him. Harry, this is the Lady Sadia Slytherin, she is the guardian for the quarters of Slytherin’s Head of House,” introduced Severus.
, a powerful
“Missed me, Potter?”
Back in his chair, Harry sucked in a shuddering breath. “What was that?”
Severus’ face softened as he understood why they were all acting so odd. “No, I’m just fine, Harry. Although I’d love some dinner, and then there are a few things you all need to hear.”
“I know you didn’t,” Harry interrupted her. “It’s alright.”
Just as it landed in his hands, however, a tawny owl came gliding through the open window and dropped a small package wrapped in brown paper into Harry’s lap. His green eyes were sparkling with such childlike joy at such a shabby looking thing, Draco wanted to kiss him senseless right then and there.
Harry looked up at Remus standing next to him. He gave Harry an encouraging smile.
“Harry?” he called, lifting the mirror in front of himself. It didn’t show his reflection. Instead of his own, Harry’s face was looking back at him, smiling broadly. “Harry! Everything alright?”
“It’s not a wild animal if raised by humans,” Charlie interrupted her. Molly made an annoyed noise and fully turned to face Charlie now.
Remus understood instantly. Gods, he wished he didn’t understand instantly.
She was still watching him, lips slightly pursed and brows furrowed, so he went on, “That being said, I would like to take this opportunity to apologise to you. I’ve said some pretty awful things to you over the years and I’m sorry. It was what I thought would gain my father’s approval, which is of course not an excuse—it didn’t work anyway. I hope you accept my apology and can maybe even forgive me one day, though I would understand if that is too much to ask. Regardless, I wanted you to know that I do not subscribe to my father’s ideologies of blood-supremacy, and I wish I could take back the things I said and did to you. I am truly sorry.”
“What? No, I was joking, don’t worry about that,” Harry amended quickly, but the twins wore matching expressions of rare seriousness now.
he whispered, and those beautiful green eyes widened.
good at charms.”
“Frankly, I’m fairly sure Draco was your only chance at getting Harry to leave,” Remus commented. “He’s usually rather adamant about wanting to hear such things for himself.”
The compartment door opened again and a group of fourth-year girls stood outside, the one in the front, a brazen-looking girl with long black hair and large dark eyes, levelling a calculating look at Neville.
Harry shrugged. “I can tell you how I’m doing it, if you want?”
He hadn’t paid any attention to his reflection before, having been distracted by his headache, but now he was properly looking at himself for the first time since waking up. He looked different.
“We do!” she exclaimed, looking a little offended.
“Why don’t you compare the potions directly?” Harry suggested.
“Oh, and Severus,” Albus called after him, “if you happen to think of anyone who might be Harry’s father, you will tell me, won’t you? After all, you also knew Lily well.”
Severus’ eyes searched out Harry in the crowd and as expected he saw his son frowning. Harry wouldn’t approve of any sort of age-restriction, not when he had faced the Dark Lord in his own first year.
about it. Because apparently my life is a crack fic.
now. And why, pray tell, does
Draco put the journal away, feeling somewhat melancholic. Gods, they were ridiculous. It hadn’t even been a day.
Severus frowned, but decided not to push the matter. He went on to describe the rest of the meeting, how the Dark Lord had invaded his mind and seen his memory of Lily, and how angry that had made him. Memories of the day before assaulted him, as he recounted what the Dark Lord had done with Bellatrix’ daggers, and eventually with Severus’ own spell.
“I’m sorry. I didn’t know,” Severus repeated softly.
Severus stood, briefly inclined his head and sat back down. The hall was filled with agitated chatter now, and Severus could tell that—with the exception of the Slytherin table—the student body did not appear to be too pleased about the news. He kept his face neutral as he searched the Gryffindor table and found Harry looking right back at him, Lily’s eyes shining brightly in his son’s face, his jaw set in that particular way Severus had come to recognise as Harry trying to suppress a smile. His own expression almost slipped then, but he managed to control himself.
A few beats of silence passed by, then Harry seemed to remember something.
“Ron got it from the cupboard in the Potions classroom because he doesn’t have his own copy yet. I gave him mine to prevent him from whining about it the entire lesson.”
Remus frowned at him and Draco’s heart sank. Would he forbid Harry to go? Even though Severus was Harry’s father, Remus was currently acting as his guardian, or at least that’s what Harry had told Draco.
To his relief, they didn’t have to linger in the corridor for long, as Severus opened the door to the classroom to let them in with a cold command, “Inside.”
in case you forgot. I killed him literally with my bare hands.”
“I’m afraid I did not manage to give him detention again, though not for lack of trying. I think he’s planning to stop by on Sunday, given that he can get away from his Gryffindor friends unnoticed.”
Draco chuckled at his expression and pulled him upstairs, pausing only to kiss Narcissa on the cheek as they passed her. When they finally made it back to their room, Harry immediately collapsed face first unto the bed with a groan.
Unfortunately, Slughorn also wasn’t the best teacher according to Severus, and he insisted on drilling both Harry and Draco on the theoretical aspects that were covered during sixth year, as well as having them write down all the recipes they’d learn. In response to Draco’s question why they should have to write it all down themselves if there was a potions’ book on their booklist, Severus snorted and promptly went on a fifteen minute rant about how that book had already been outdated when he himself was a student, and that it was absurd that Slughorn still intended to use it when most of the recipes had long since been improved and adjusted.
“You already said that and I told you that he intends to apologise to all of you. He already apologised to Hermione and she accepted it,” Harry argued back. “If she can give him a chance, you should too.”
She shook her head.
to know him right now—he only knew how to rile him up. That dynamic, however, he was intimately familiar with. A semblance of calm washed through him, as he yielded to what he knew best.
It had by far been the best sleep he’d gotten since coming back to school. He had become used to sleeping next to Draco and to the luxury of being soothed when he awoke drenched in cold sweat, echoes of whatever nightmare he’d had still reverberating through his mind. Though his progress with Occlumency had helped with the nightmares a little, he had gone back to casting silencing charms around his bed at night to avoid waking his dorm mates. Most nights, he just missed Draco’s warmth. How had he fallen in love with that utterly infuriating prat so quickly?
“You collapsed in the entrance hall, blood-soaked. Narcissa got to you first and cast some stasis charms on your wounds—I have no idea how many there were, but too many to count. We brought you into the dining hall and tried some healing spells, but none of them worked. Neither did your healing potions. So we figured that—”
Snape opened his mouth to speak, but Narcissa lifted her hand to cut him off.
“Stop worrying,” Harry murmured, giving him a soft nudge.
“They will pay,” he grit out, his jaw so tense he could barely speak.
shoot through him like lightning. He was half aware that he gasped, but he was too captivated by Severus’ heated gaze to care. His eyes dropped to Severus’ lips just as the man’s tongue darted out to wet them.
“I was unhappy about Kreacher because he’s unpleasant to be around,” Harry answered evenly. “And before you get all wound-up about it: No, Narcissa is not mistreating them. Yes, they like working for her. No, they do not want to be freed.”
Harry stepped back to let him into the room. “A bit of a headache, but I’m alright, I guess. Just very confused.”
“I have to speak to Dumbledore?” she asked.
“Uh, okay, sure,” said Harry, sounding a little confused.
Right, there was that. Somehow Harry had assumed Narcissa would’ve told Malfoy about that, but he had evidently been wrong.
If it hadn’t been for his enhanced senses, Remus wouldn’t have heard. Definitely more than superficial civility. Remus watched as Draco warred with himself until he eventually conceded, looking resigned.

He released the pattern into Severus’ chest, feeling the wave of power leave through his palms as it washed over Severus’ skin. The bleeding slowed immediately. Without wasting a second, Harry picked up his wand again and repeated the healing charms he’d tried earlier. The cut he was casting on closed.

“Me? How could I possibly help you with that, sir?” he asked sceptically.

said that I won’t include them in the DA, are you even listening?”
Severus heard some shuffling and something that sounded like whispered words. He didn’t move. He
“I SAID DON’T TOUCH THAT, BOY!”
“What?” he asked, his blush returning immediately in full force.
It was Draco who eventually broke the silence. “Merlin’s beard, you’re right,” he breathed, his eyes flying back and forth between Harry and Snape. “He does look like him!”
Harry nodded.
“Draco, talk to me, please.”
“Did you know that Harry was supposedly conceived on their wedding night?” she asked, her eyes glinting with satisfaction.
“One more thing,” said Harry. Draco turned to face him again, opening his mouth to ask what when Harry cut him off with another kiss. Draco immediately melted into it, letting out a small whine when Harry pulled back again. Instinctively, he wrapped a hand around the back of Harry’s neck, keeping him close—just one more second.
This time it’s Draco’s turn to blush and he feels his cheeks heat as they hold each other’s gaze for a long, drawn-out moment. It’s over way too quickly.
It is a charm to enter someone else’s mind. Once you have mastered the spell itself, we will move on to performing Legilimency without a wand or incantation.” Something must have shown on Harry’s face, for Dumbledore smiled and continued, “Do not worry, it is not nearly as difficult as it may sound.”
“A technicality.”
“Well, you’ll have to live with that.”
Snape’s lips all but disappeared as he pressed them firmly together, clearly biting back some snarky answer.
“I know, cub, I know. But you have me, I’ll always be here.” Remus produced a handkerchief and wiped Harry’s face. “I won’t ever abandon you, cub. Even if we find your father, I won’t give you up. You’re family to me, Harry.”
here on top of it all.”
However, by the beginning of lunchtime Ron was still barely half done with his homework and his mood had plummeted drastically. Harry’s efforts to help him had been mostly unsuccessful, and there was little he could do at this point short of writing it for Ron himself. This was probably what Hermione had felt like for the past five years with both of them. Maybe he should apologise to her for that.
“I must say, though, I am surprised that you allowed Mrs Malfoy bringing three house-elves here. I thought you were unhappy about Kreacher being here already.” The disapproval was clear in Hermione’s voice. That much about trusting his judgement.
. With only half a mind, he quickly stripped down to his pants, threw on a shirt he usually slept in and crawled under the covers, falling asleep almost immediately.
“There you are, mate!” he exclaimed. “We’ve been looking all over for you, Hermione is going spare soon. I just wanted to get your map to find you.”
Draco exhaled slowly. It was a lot to digest, but not necessarily because it was about the Dark Lord.
Minerva pulled a face, saying, “Ah, yes, Horace’s methods have always been…lax.”
In his shock he all but forgot his outrage at Minerva’s blatant assumption that they’d slept with each other the moment they met again, and answered before he could think twice about it, “Just once. I hadn’t seen her in years.”
They held each other’s gaze for a moment, then Remus leaned in again for another kiss. It was slower this time, more deliberate, but no less passionate. When they broke apart again, they were both panting heavily and Remus’ trousers had gotten uncomfortably tight. He really had to distract himself or this would escalate in
“Nope!”
“No,” he admitted. “Although I’m fairly sure that Weasley—I mean, Ron—wanted to hex my head off more than once. It was to be expected I guess. I like the twins, though, and I suppose Charlie and Bill aren’t too bad either.”
Harry felt a flicker of irritation and quickly checked his own mind shields. It wouldn’t do for Dumbledore to feel Harry’s displeasure at his … methods.
“I have no idea, I suspect Dumbledore will tell me on Saturday.”
It was an easy choice, barely a choice at all, really. He jotted down a quick message to Draco, telling him where he was, before finally fishing out the textbook to inspect it. Something was written into a corner inside the cover:
“But I do expect it from you,” Albus said, his voice now gaining an edge. “You swore an oath to me, that you would do whatever is necessary to bring Voldemort down, or have you forgotten?”
She looked at him pleadingly, her eyes full of desperation. “The Dark Lord is displeased because Lucius let himself be captured. He plans to force Draco to take the Mark to punish Lucius. I always intended to leave if Lucius was ever out of the picture for some reason, but I never thought I’d have to hide so hastily.” She reached across the table and took Harry’s hand in hers. “Please, Harry, if Draco is forced to take the Dark Mark he is as good as dead. Please, allow us to stay, I beg you.”
“Sure, whatever Saint Potter wishes,” he drawled, before pushing past Potter. He even managed to keep a leisurely pace rather than running up the stairs.
“On the contrary, Legilimency is a rare skill and difficult enough to learn that many people give up before they ever achieve it. Even though I all but opened my mind to you, it is most astounding that you have managed it so easily and I am curious as to how you did it.”
If Harry hadn’t known him so well, he wouldn’t even have noticed that the Slytherin had gone rigid. He felt his own heart thump in his chest. They’d discussed this. Nobody could know about them, so they’d have to act as enemies in public. Even if the public was the inside of a stuffy robe shop with nobody here except them and people who already knew. Well, except Tonks, but she wouldn’t care, would she?
“Narcissa then asked to deal with Walburga’s portrait
Harry’s heart did a little flip at the word, as he let Draco guide him up the stairs and into the drawing room, where he was manoeuvred to sit on a big couch, Draco settling down next to him. Draco was still holding Harry’s hand to his chest. How had they managed the stairs like that?
“In a real fight your opponent wouldn’t wait for you to be ready either, and they’d do far worse than take your wand,” said Severus.
“‘Cause I’ve been a right git for the past five years. I know we talked about our history, but I haven’t exactly treated your friends any better. In some ways, I’ve treated them worse, especially Granger. And my father is a Death Eater, which isn’t exactly something to be proud of.” He sighed. “I thought maybe you wouldn’t want anyone to know that you associate with a Slytherin, with the son of a Death Eater—with me.”
Draco dropped his hand from Harry’s cock down to his bollocks, fondling them gently.
Neither of them answered, both frozen in matching expressions of shocked horror. The silence between them stretched far beyond comfort, and Harry felt agitation rise in him. His legs began to bounce rapidly, and none of his efforts to keep them still succeeded.
Not just a father, a family. He had no time to dwell on it, though, as Hermione was still talking.
Severus nodded and stood mechanically. As he left the kitchen, he heard the soft voices of Narcissa and Lupin continuing to talk. He didn’t want to know what else they were discussing. As if in trance, he made his way up the stairs and out the front door, before apparating directly to the front gates of Hogwarts.
Draco’s heart accelerated at that. He hadn’t thought that far. Merlin, he hadn’t thought about anything other than Harry in hours.
Remus blinked at him in surprise. “You did? When?”
of them, every single one—gasped. Draco had to suppress the urge to laugh and quickly picked up his cup of tea to hide his smile. Sure, he’d been surprised by it, too, but this was like watching a drama on a stage. Gryffindors and their blatant displays of emotions. Now that everyone’s attention was away from Draco he felt decidedly lighter. Severus, however, looked more uncomfortable than ever—at least to Draco, who knew him well enough to be able to tell. For everyone else he hid it well behind a mask of arrogance.
“Mr Potter, I see here that you have inherited several estates, some of them rather recently, but haven’t yet formally claimed either title. Would you like to rectify that, if you’re already here?”
Draco inhaled sharply. Harry’s face was hard, his gaze still aimed at nothing.
He flopped back down onto the sofa next to Draco, wordlessly worming his way under Draco’s arm, snuggling into his side. Draco laughed softly, pulling Harry closer and dropping a kiss on his hair.
Albus smiled at him, the twinkle slowly returning to his eyes.
Harry grinned as he replied, “Dad taught me over the summer.”
“There he is, our dearest investor!” Fred beamed at him. “Did George give you the tour? Splendid! We figured it’d be best not to say anything in front of Ron—nobody really knows where we got the money to start the shop—but you, my dear Harrykins, take whatever you like, no charge. You have a life-long 100 percent discount.”
A similar pattern repeated itself over the following few days, and Harry quickly settled into his new routine, quite happy to at least not be spending his summer doing chores and being locked up for once.
Harry sank back into the couch with a sigh, enjoying the relative quiet of his room compared to the noise in the drawing room. Hermione looked around appreciatively as she settled into the armchair to his right, while Ron sat down in the one to his left.
“He doesn’t lose any time, does he?” commented Ron. “What do you think he’ll teach you?”
For a long moment, neither of them moved and Draco simply kept Harry pressed to his chest. His hands were still firmly on his back, still feeling the uneven bumps beneath his fingers. Then, Harry stirred, tentatively moving away again. Reluctantly, Draco loosened his grip, although he didn’t take his hands off Harry’s back. He moved with him instead, until they were both sitting upright on the couch, faces only inches apart with Draco’s arms still around him.
Harry’s hands had found their way under his shirt—again—and the feeling of short nails digging into his skin sent shivers down his spine. Merlin, he could lose himself in this. His own hands began to wander, letting go of black hair and travelling downwards over Harry’s chest. Teeth nipped at his ear and he tried—and failed—to suppress a moan. He felt himself blush a little, but the faint feeling of embarrassment vanished immediately when Harry responded in kind.
Silence settled over them. Harry forced his thoughts away from gruesome spells and blood flowing relentlessly out of gashing wounds, back to the reason he’d thought of it in the first place. The book.
Bloody Gryffindors and their hero complexes. Draco simply squeezed Harry’s hand and pulled him into the people-packed street. Harry sighed, but didn’t argue further, following Draco through the crowd. Within minutes, they were at Twilfitt and Tatting’s and Draco’s excitement rose.
lines that Voldemort is apparently the heir of?” He sounded anxious.
“Harry?”
“Okay, cool.”
It was too good to last.
that when Albus told us about the charms?!” Lupin had found his voice again, sounding seriously agitated now.
“There was never any other option, love. I’ll find something to get rid of them, if you want me to.”
Anyway, as always thanks so much for reading and I hope you enjoyed it!
tell me what’s happe—”
Thanks to
but he doesn’t know
“Oh.” He should’ve guessed that himself.
“There are counter-curses, containment spells, some curses have to be drained from the blood—blood-replenishing potions come in handy there—and the curse-breaker department at the Ministry has their own set of spells specifically against injury inflicting dark magic.”
Taking a deep breath, he went on with his story, growing more tense as it progressed from riding the Thestrals to the Ministry to finding the Hall of Prophecy, where they found the globe with Harry’s name on it and encountered Death Eaters.
“I don’t know. Nobody does.”
“Back already? Weren’t you going to find Dean?” asked Neville, already scooting up to make space for her.
“What’s wrong?” Severus asked with a frown.
“There was a moment in which you used magic, describe that part to me,” Snape commanded.
Blaise gave her a lazy look from where he sat on the couch. “Leave him be if he doesn’t want to. More for us,” he said with a shrug and wiggled the bottle of firewhisky at Pansy, before pouring himself a glass.
Remus nodded, smiling. Whatever the Malfoys had done with him this afternoon, he approved of it.
“What about those with specific reasons?”
He shut the door in Harry’s face, leaving him stunned—and hurting.
“Of course.”
“Hey Remus,” Harry said, coming up the stairs behind Draco, who whirled around with a start.
“Alright,” Severus replied warily, unenthusiastic about the prospect of encountering Harry already.
Draco let out all the breath he’d been holding, burying his face in his hands. “Potter,” he accused, “that was the single most embarrassing and humiliating exchange I’ve ever had with another living being, and I’ve gone through it
“How about we just forget about that for now and plan the first DA session instead? All without dark arts, of course,” he suggested.
“Mmh!” He reached out blindly, finding Harry’s arm and tugging him back.
She inclined her head in thanks. Remus was about to rise from the table and leave when she spoke up again.
Harry wanted to leave.
The clock chimed once. Nine fifteen.
The expression on Slughorn’s face was priceless—it was clear that he did not want to give away any more of the golden potion. He warred with himself for several seconds, then visibly deflated.
But Draco didn’t dwell on the unfairness of it when Harry reemerged after barely two minutes dressed in Draco’s robes. If Draco had been worried that they wouldn’t fit, he shouldn’t have been. On the contrary, the robes fit Harry almost to perfection and Draco was dimly aware that he was gaping. Harry had been attractive with his charmed-on face in his ill-fitted Muggle clothes and he’d grown even
“Just unexpected. I would’ve figured you’d go for more…traditional pet-names.”
“You’re afraid that Severus is only trying to build a relationship with you out of a sense of duty,” she continued in his stead. “A sense of duty that might disappear once he witnesses that you already found a surrogate family, and that said surrogate family isn’t about to abandon you. You’re afraid we will all clear the field for them if they don’t shun you, that you can’t have both either way.”
Healing potion. Basic, but effective for most ailments from cuts to fevers. He forced that one down Severus’ throat too and watched the cuts closely. To his dismay, it barely had more effect than the spells, although it did slow down the bleeding from the smaller cuts at least. They stayed open all the same, and Harry’s mind began to race, looking for an alternative. The smaller cuts must’ve been made with a spell too, albeit a different one than the big ones on Severus’ chest, or maybe with a cursed blade.
Albus hummed in acknowledgement. Then, after a short silence, he said, “Yes, I suppose that would work as well. You would offer your Floo as his means of travel?”
“Harry, please,” Draco whined, his twitching hips pinned in place and unable to move to seek friction.
“Potter,” Harry replied.
The slight shift in position brought Draco’s hardness that had been pressing into Harry’s hip right into alignment with Harry’s own erection and the sudden unexpected heat and friction had his eyes flying open with a gasp, followed by a deep moan he couldn’t possibly have held back. Instinctively his body sought more of it, his hips grinding upwards. Draco met him halfway and they both groaned, breaking their kiss.
“So,” he said, once they were settled on the small couch Harry had added to his seating area at some point in the past week, “what did Sev do to piss you off so badly? Do I have to go rip him a new one?”
“Take his clothes off,” he ordered. “I need to be able to cast skin to skin.”
Harry sighed and hissed to Sirona to hide beneath his robes as he got off the bed.
Severus needed a second to remember who exactly Riley Bovin was. “The Ravenclaw boy? He was fairly quiet in previous years. What changed?”
They didn’t spend
“That’s…Potter? What happened to him? He looks like Black. Why does Potter look like Black? Is this an attempt at concealing his identity? If so, maybe cover the scar,” he sneered, unable to fully control his foul mood.
“Such as?”
“Remus!” Harry jumped up and went to greet him with a hug.
“There’s a spell,” Snape interrupted, speaking for the first time. “If you consent to participate, we can easily determine whether it’s the truth or not. Let’s make this simple.”
“Yes, gods, yes,” Draco replied, just as breathless.
From now on, I’ll include this disclaimer a lot more, just to be safe:
Just when the potion was done, the sound of apparition echoed through the house again. Harry and Albus must be back. Remus and Severus made their way downstairs quickly to greet them.
Harry didn’t bother to argue, the woman would do what she wanted either way. Rolling onto his back, he let out a heavy sigh. If he was going to stay in his room indefinitely, he might as well be productive in here.
leave. I will not tolerate prejudice based on the decision a magical hat made when we were eleven years old. Understood? We are all on the same side.”
For the first few days after they had confirmed that Severus actually was Harry’s biological father, Harry hadn’t said a word during meals and disappeared somewhere in the house in between them. Remus had made a habit to knock on his door every time he passed it, taking hourly breaks from his reading to go down to the kitchen for tea or chocolate, simply to have an excuse to do so. Harry usually only returned to his room after his daily Occlumency lessons, which seemed to be going decently at least. At the very least Harry hadn’t said much when Remus had asked him about it. It was obvious that Harry didn’t want to talk about Severus, if it could be avoided, so Remus had set himself the rule to bring Severus up once in each conversation, but no more than that. If Harry refused to talk to him because he pushed him too hard, no good would come of it anyway.
Harry beamed at him. “I’m proud of you, you know?”
“What a lovely way to make the understatement of the week. The man has put an utterly outdated textbook on their list, half the recipes in there are inaccurate according to today’s standards.”
“I don’t even know what you’re talking about,” Draco muttered.
For a moment, neither of them said a word. Then Remus smiled, took a sip of his firewhisky and pointed at Severus’ head.
Harry pulled a face. Remus had mentioned that Scrimgeour was very keen to find him, but he hadn’t expected the man to harass the Weasleys because of it.
Remus frowned, his eyes full of pity. “I’m assuming she was trying to protect you. Lily loved you more than her life. If she believed you’d be more at risk if people knew that James wasn’t your father, she’d have done anything to prevent anyone from finding out.”
“Kreacher is useful for small errands, but he is old and not the most thorough when it comes to hygiene. I have not asked him to cook for us since the third day after arriving here.”
Suddenly feeling nauseous, he put the half-eaten sandwich down.
“Watch where you’re fucking going, Potter,” he spat angrily, pushing Potter harder than usual. Hard enough to make him tumble down onto the floor.
he was tired. Looking up at the table, he saw Narcissa and Remus cleaning the blood off Severus, who seemed to be unconscious again. Or maybe asleep. Hard to tell when Harry’s head was ringing so loudly.
“That was amazing!”
“Keep it!” Harry said quickly, grabbing the used copy himself. “I really don’t need it. I’m just going to order a new one for myself.”
Draco looked at Harry pleadingly. “I’m sorry, I really am. Not just for how I’ve treated you, but for how I treated people in general. It got better after I got somewhat close to Pansy and Blaise.”
“Yeah, I guess,” answered Harry with a shrug. “I know I could’ve done better—could do better now—and that’s frustrating, but it’s alright.”
“If only I knew,” sighed Minerva. “Probably puberty, they’ve been teasing the poor girl all week. I wouldn’t be surprised if those two started dating soon.”
Finally, Neville got over his initial shock enough to ask, “Are you serious?”
Harry pouted at him. “Why not? You didn’t mind on the train.”
Harry furrowed his brows at her. Sure, the first couple spells had been a bit more difficult to learn, but once he’d gotten the hang of the basic…
He hadn’t expected Remus to be the type to suggest anything so emotionally detached. Something akin to disappointment welled up in him. Was that all Remus saw in him? Then again, it wasn’t like they were agreeing to just fuck and never talk otherwise. They were simply putting their friendship first, because it was undeniable that romantic feelings could complicate everything to a destructive degree. He hadn’t been in love since Lily.
“Can you take over? Just keep reinforcing the stasis charms,” he told Draco, then stepped away and slammed the book onto a chair, crouching in front of it.
Draco cut him off with a kiss. It took less than a heartbeat for Harry to relax and melt into Draco’s arms that he’d put around him.
Last edit: Grammar & detail fixes, 15.5.2021
Alarmed, Harry jumped around the corner he’d been hiding behind and took in the scene before him. Narcissa lay on the floor, gasping for air and obviously in tremendous pain, with Severus kneeling beside her, checking her over frantically. His heart clenched. Not her too. He couldn’t lose any more people.
“I invented all sorts of spells,” Severus replied. “Without any friends, I had nothing better to do than to experiment—mostly with potions, but I also dabbled in spell-work. This particular curse was one of the last ones I ever finalised, along with its counter-curse. At that time, I was already involved with countless Death Eaters and prospective Death Eaters, since most of the upper year Slytherins intended to join the Dark Lord upon graduation. When they learned of my experiments, they encouraged me to try my hand at something more…
“Is that jealousy I hear?” Harry grinned.
Harry smiled and wandlessly called the two tomes they’d been reading over to the couch. Wandless magic came to him easier every day, and it delighted him to no end, especially since it was a rare talent according to Remus. Shifting a little, Draco settled his head in Harry’s lap, holding his book above him, while Harry leaned on the back of the couch, holding his book one-handed and playing with Draco’s hair with the other. For the first time since he’d begun his story about that night at the Ministry, Harry felt the tension in his body ease away again.
Harry shook his head.
She was already moving along the clothes racks, picking up trousers, jumpers and shirts as she went. Harry’s face was now scarlet, but he didn’t argue. Draco smirked, nobody would dare argue with his mother when she adopted this particular tone, not even Harry Potter.
“Alright,” he said, squeezing her hand in return before withdrawing it. “You and Mal— I mean Draco can stay. But if M— Draco behaves like a prick, I’ll hex him without hesitation.”
“We’ll have to test it when you spend hours in your lab again,” Draco declared.
“If you had deigned to answer the first two times I knocked, I wouldn’t have had to get your attention like that,” Harry retorted. “Why didn’t you come down for dinner? Or lunch or breakfast?”
That sounded logical enough. Harry nodded, though his unease persisted.
“Shall I get a bottle of firewhisky from the cellar?” he suggested, smirking at Remus.
Despite the mid-summer heat, Draco felt ice cold as he lay in the garden, staring at the clouds.
The wolf in him snarled, angry at everyone and everything that had ever caused
Minerva rolled her eyes and set down her glass. “Don’t be stubborn, Severus,” she admonished. “Just answer the question and I’ll tell you all my theories.”
“As a matter of fact we’ve already solved the issue of communication,” Harry shot back, a hint of pride in his voice.
Harry caught Draco rolling his eyes, but he didn’t contradict Pansy.
A week after Harry’s birthday, Remus declared that Harry had mastered apparition. It should’ve made him happy, but in his downtrodden mood he barely managed a smile. Draco was doing his best to cheer him up, but despite his repeated success, it never took long for Harry to slip back into his sullenness.
“And spend the day away from you? I don’t think so,” Harry replied nonchalantly. Draco’s face softened immediately. “No, I wanted to invite them to visit Grimmauld. With the drawing room and the dining room all renovated, there’s enough space to host everyone.”
They spent the better part of an hour simply reading, occasionally commenting on something in their respective books—Draco was devouring a book on advanced transfiguration, while Harry was still immersed in healing—but otherwise they didn’t talk much. When Remus knocked on Harry’s door to check on them, Draco didn’t even move. It made Harry feel all warm and fuzzy that they could show their affection for each other so casually now. He felt peaceful, almost serene.
Lupin smiled fondly at the memories, then shook his head again. “It makes sense. Looks like you’ve beaten the statistical odds, Severus,” he said. “It’s either you or James, and we know for a fact that it isn’t James.”
After five years — more, actually, if he really thought about it — of following him everywhere like bodyguards watching his back, he’d somehow expected some sort of resistance from them against him going out alone. Perhaps they were finally realising that they had nothing in common except a shared childhood due to their fathers’ friendship. Either way, Draco had been pleasantly surprised by the lack of argument upon his leaving.
Remus pulled back his ears, worried by how venomous Harry’s words were. What was he talking about? Remus knew that Harry’s life with Lily’s sister hadn’t been very loving, but this sounded like there was more to the story. Much more. But Harry wasn’t dwelling on it, and Remus would just have to remember to ask him when he was human again.
Sweet Merlin, his magic. Draco hadn’t seen many magical cores before, but even he had been able to tell that Potter was more than just a little more powerful than the average wizard.
“Just going to the restroom,” Draco lied smoothly.
, Harry thought, suppressing a groan. Now they all knew. At least he wouldn’t have to repeat himself. When Remus moved, Harry flinched at the speed with which the man crossed the room, dropping to his knees in front of Harry and pulling him out of Draco’s arms and into a crushing embrace of his own.
“I’m not sure I can,” he admitted quietly. “I’ve never had parents, but that was because they were dead. I’m okay with that, I’m used to being an orphan because my parents just
At the brisk pace he was walking, he reached Dumbledore‘s office just a minute before seven. He gave the password that made the stone gargoyle move aside and climbed the spiral stairs.
Harry walked into the room, leaving a frozen Weasley and Granger behind at the door, and turned to face them. Even only seeing half of his face, Draco could tell that he was nervous. More steps and chattering echoed through the hallway, but as Weasley after Weasley reached the door, all the talking died down, until there was total silence as ten pairs of eyes stared disbelievingly into the drawing room. Ten? With mild surprise, Draco belatedly registered that a familiar head of silver hair was among the sea of red. Fleur Delacour. What the hell was Fleur Delacour doing here?
By the end of the first week he was just starting to feel truly comfortable, when his fragile routine was violently disrupted by the arrival of Draco Malfoy. Despite knowing full well that term was ending and that Malfoy was about to join his mother at Grimmauld Place, Harry didn’t feel at all prepared to face his school rival. Not here. Animosity like that didn’t belong here, didn’t belong in the first place that felt like a home to Harry that wasn’t Hogwarts.
“You looked like you were about to either hex something or have a breakdown. I’ve known you all your life, Draco, you can’t lie to me.”
Did you know all along?”
Snape’s behaviour continued to be rather odd. Harry assumed it had something to do with him no longer looking like James Potter, and decided to simply be grateful for the lack of spite he received during their daily Occlumency lessons. And though those were still not pleasant, he was ultimately thankful for them. If nothing else, his progress with clearing his mind helped with the nightmares—those about Voldemort as well as those about the Dursleys.
Neville frowned a little, but replied, “It was good. Well, as good as it could be under the circumstances—the news weren’t really encouraging throughout, were they, with all those disappearances; to think that Gran got me a new wand just a couple days before Ollivander went missing. I don’t know what I would’ve done if he’d been gone already! But look, it’s cherry and Unicorn hair.” He held out his wand for Harry to inspect. “Otherwise we barely left the house all summer, I’ve only really seen Luna, and even her only twice. How about you? Have you been in touch with anyone from the DA?”
Sirona asked, ignoring his correction as she wound up Harry’s arm and eventually came to hold her head in front of his face, looking at him expectantly with glittering prismatic eyes.
“You try fighting Harry and then teaching second and third years for two hours right after.”
“Ready?”
“I do not wish to speak ill of the man you’ve loved and mourned as your father for fifteen years, I know that James Potter grew up and changed, otherwise Lily wouldn’t have married him. But to me, back then, he was the worst man in the world. The man who had tormented me for years, the man who got to marry the woman I loved. I hated everything about him.”
“Mother heard you,” Draco said, barely meeting Severus’ eyes. “You and the Dark Lord. She heard what he plans for me and— I can’t do this, I don’t want to be a Death Eater.”
Blaise rolled his eyes again, but his lips lifted into a small smile, and he answered, “There’s so much to tell, you’ll have to be more specific.”
It made sense though, in a rather cruel way. Of course family was the one thing Harry would be hopelessly insecure about. Of course the thought of truly belonging was so foreign to him that he just
His good mood kept for once, and they spent the rest of the afternoon practising spells in the garden. Only when it was time for dinner and Severus was once again absent did Harry’s cheerfulness fade. He ate in silence, not feeling up to making conversation. Just when he was about to get up from the table and retreat to their room again, Narcissa held him back.
Draco frowned at him, but didn’t seem to have a counter-argument for that. Harry sighed.
And afterwards he all but
he does, because he used to be just like James, mannerisms and all, and now he’s entirely different. I swear to you, Minerva, if you saw it for yourself you’d notice too.”
According to Severus’ book, prism vipers reached maturity after approximately seven months. Sirona was only three months old. Nevertheless, Harry thought he could already see hints of a pattern emerging on her iridescent skin. As soon as the pattern was fully formed, she should be able to use her abilities completely at will.
The Dark Lord sneered.
Severus lifted his wand, murmuring, “Alright then.” And he began to cast.
Draco nodded slowly. If it had been him, he wouldn’t have said anything either, probably.
“You still love her.”
“Any particular reason why you’ve secluded yourself, Severus?”
“Oh, well then another time,” she said, sounding disappointed. Her smile returned though when she turned to Harry, saying, “Bye, Harry, take care of yourself!”
“Oh, well, that’s good.”
Severus heard himself scream again as his own spell tore open his chest, leaving deep gashes spilling blood. The bonds around his wrists disappeared and he collapsed into a crumpled heap on the floor. Everything was pain.
He gave her a pointed look, led them to a somewhat private area of the common room, and cast Muffliato — a spell from the Potions book margins Severus had declared safe to use — before answering, “I was with Draco. You really have to be more careful what you shout about, Hermione.”
“I didn’t think you’d make such a big deal out of it when I said I want us to pick tattoos for each other.”
“What did those relatives of yours do that you have such a reaction to me yelling at you?” he asked, his voice hard and laced with cold fury.
Harry laughed and some of the tension in the room abated. The twins promptly marched into the room—forcing Harry to quickly lift his shield charm while he was walking over to stand next to where Draco sat—followed by a much more cautious looking Weaslette, and took the three-seat couch to Draco’s right. Fleur Delacour seemed mildly confused, but entered without hesitation when one of the two Weasley brothers Draco didn’t know moved to join his siblings, her arm firmly linked with his as they settled next to Remus. So that’s how she’d ended up here, she was dating one of the older ones.
“He’s…dealing. It’s getting better, I think.” Remus ran a hand through his hair, trying to find the right words to describe Harry’s state of mind. “In the beginning, he disappeared somewhere in the house almost all day—Merlin knows where, I swear I checked every room the first day. But then, after a few days, he started to wander around the house, never really staying in one place too long, although he did disappear again sometimes in between. I honestly see him in the hallway more than anywhere else, apart from when I go to his room in the evening to talk a bit.”
Feeling four pairs of eyes on him, he forced himself to speak. “That’s still no proof.”
“So they’re just alone now?”
For all his desperately suppressed secret pining, Draco was woefully unprepared for the sudden glorious feeling of Potter’s lips against his. He froze, his mind unable to fully process what was happening. Unable to process anything at all; as if something had come unstuck that allowed too many feelings to rush into him at once, overwhelming him.
“Come on, Hermione is in the common room. We saw the DA announcement on the board, so we’re starting on Wednesday?” Ron was already out the door when he paused to see if Harry was even following. “You coming, mate?”
He simply let her pass into the house and watched her talk the portrait off the wall. He even thanked her and offered her first name basis—which she reciprocated, as if
“I did tell you everything,” Dumbledore replied, unfazed. “Everything I know, at least. What I am about to show you is not
“Hey, Harry,” the third year student said nervously.
“I was just thinking,” he began, “how I’m on borrowed time here. The Dark Lord wants me to take his Mark, and you know as well as I do that there is no refusing him indefinitely. Eventually I’ll have to choose between the Mark or the killing curse.”
Harry’s eyes were hard now, his expression serious. For a few tense seconds, he and Weasley stared each other down. Draco half expected to see wands drawn and hexes fly again. Then Weasley relented, averted his eyes, shrugged, and mumbled, “Alright then, I’ll drop it because it’s your birthday—but we’re not done! You owe me a real good explanation for all this.”
with anything.
“It is, but I can’t go now, not before the potion is done,” he replied, just as tense.
“By killing me, you would secure your position and gain his full trust, while simultaneously ensuring that my death is voluntary, it is a truly elegant solution. Once whoever the task of killing me is assigned to fails, Voldemort is guaranteed to turn to you either way.”
“Good evening, Professor,” greeted Harry.
“You better be, I put up with Weasleys for you, Potter,” replied Draco, his best Malfoy-arrogance on his face.
She snapped her mouth shut, her cheeks deep red now. Harry sighed and refreshed the double layers of privacy spells around them.
“It’s an
“Hold on, Phlegm? Who the hell is Phlegm?” Harry asked, confused.
Several of the group nodded in agreement. Severus didn’t react at all. It seemed like a sensible plan, keeping the boy hidden for now.
“You know full well that that’s not what I meant! Don’t go in there!”
to. Wanted to feel Harry’s skin under his fingers. Wanted to truly let his hands wander, let them wander lower, to explore
someone,” she cried.
. He ignored her bemused look as he read through the table of contents of the other two books as well, trying to discern whether this would actually help him with his healing forms or not. Arithmancy seemed far more complicated than runes, but he supposed it didn’t matter too much. He would learn if it was necessary.
The door clicked shut behind Harry and he felt tension drain from his muscles.
“Oh no,” Hermione suddenly whispered, halting abruptly.
“Indeed, she’s one of our youngest members, works at the Auror department in the Ministry.”
“I am not sneaking, chicco, it’s not my fault you have your head in the clouds,” Blaise retorted, then went on, “Yes, it is. You didn’t miss much, it was incredibly boring—Slughorn was fawning over Potter half the time.” Blaise paused, then he added, “Actually, though, you did miss something: There’s something weird about Potter. He looks completely different from what he used to, acts different, too.”
Harry spluttered, “You’re telling me— We could have— Why didn’t you ever say anything?“
“Why—”
“Yes, quite,” Severus agreed.
The bathroom he found was bigger than his bedroom at the Dursley’s and seemed to consist almost entirely of black marble. Harry gaped in wonder. Whoever brought him here—probably Dumbledore—must’ve put him into the master bedroom where Buckbeak used to be. Distractedly, he wondered where Buckbeak was now, and how they’d gotten the smell out of the room.
“I know, Draco,” Severus said quietly.
Alright, so this one was a bit difficult to write to be honest, mostly because Severus himself is predominantly an observer in this situation which makes his POV difficult. But still, his reaction to Molly’s declaration is important, because it’s so utterly
“It is the only way, Severus,” Albus insisted, apparently having regained his composure.
“That curse that Voldemort used on your chest, Narcissa said that it was your spell. That you invented it. Is it true?”
“Tell me about the prettiest.”
The colour on Potter’s cheeks deepens. “Yeah— I mean, no, doesn’t have to be now but since we’re eighth years and can go whenever we like I thought— Another time is fi—”
“It’s not like it comes as a surprise,” said Harry. “I am literally destined to kill a man after all.”
It was a bit over a month now since he’d lost Sirius. A bit over a month alone, and he found himself
person when it came to sex. He had always favoured non-verbal communication for such things, unless there were explicit boundaries to be discussed with a partner. But most of these conversations had been with Sirius, the man he had made almost all his experience with, the man he had spent half his life sleeping with or fantasising about. A man he knew on that level, on a sexual level. Of course he could talk about sex with people he actually had sex with, but with
Draco had gone even paler than he already was, but he nodded.
“Unbelievable,” Severus muttered under his breath. He handed her the glass and they settled in their usual armchairs.
“We will find a way,” Severus said dismissively, even though his chest tightened at the reminder of how difficult it would be for them to meet each other.
“Gods, I’m so close, fuck, Draco! I’m gonna come,” Harry rasped, tugging lightly on Draco’s hair to pull him off, much like Draco had done to him back on the train.
After the disaster at the Ministry of Magic, the Dark Lord had summoned his followers, to blow off steam if nothing else. As most times, Severus had suffered most at his hands—the joys of being the Dark Lord’s favourite. His bones still ached from the Cruciatus curses he’d endured and he desperately wished to sleep.
. All this talk about her must’ve stirred up his memory.
“I’m afraid I don’t know where he is,” said Remus sadly, concern clear in his face. “He suddenly left the party yesterday and went to his room, I haven’t seen him since.”
“He has a point, Hermione. You-Know-Who isn’t gonna hold back on him, so why should he?”
Harry grinned and shook his head. “No, they won’t—unless they manage to take down my privacy spell without me noticing, which I seriously doubt.”
He cast again.
Draco wished he had Harry’s map, then he could check whether Harry was still in Dumbledore’s office. When he’d shown it to Draco for the first time, Draco had been outraged. First, because that was an incredible breach of privacy — you could spy on anyone with that map! Second, because why had nobody in Slytherin thought of making such a thing? Draco was still adamant that he was going to figure out how the map worked and replicate it. Replicate and improve it, even.
Sirona seemed to be settling in nicely and after another conversation with her, Harry had to admit that she really did not seem to need a terrarium, but was happy just slithering around the house freely and sleeping in her basket or in front of the hearth. Hedwig fortunately seemed entirely unbothered by the tiny snake and hadn’t attempted to attack her. Harry hoped it stayed that way and took care to give his owl plenty of attention to keep her content.
Dumbledore’s “Come in” came promptly after Harry’s first knock and he pushed open the door to step into the circular room.
“I don’t want to do that,” answered Severus, though his voice had gone much quieter now. “I never meant to reject any of you like that and I’m sorry. Can you believe me when I say that I’ll do my best not to repeat such a thing?”
Alright darlings, remember that fluff chapter you got where they go shopping? This is the panic attack that was originally in that second half there. Somehow it felt like it fit better here, gives them some room to breathe before shit goes down again.
nine fifteen.
Harry frowned and he gently grabbed Draco’s chin to make him look up at him.
“I am qualified enough for Professor Dumbledore to allow me to lead the DA.”
“Watch where you’re— Warrington?” Draco blinked at his former Quidditch captain in confusion. “Didn’t you graduate last year? I thought we had a goodbye party for you with the Quidditch team, or am I going barmy now?”
Draco frowned. “Where did you get those then?”
unknown to both of them, and Remus would be a fool to ignore that; plus he had an advantage with his position, he ought to use it.
“I might not know Harry too well, but I am a mother. Trust me, he’ll appreciate your concern more in a couple of hours, when he’s calmed down.”
“Thank you, sir,” replied Harry politely. There was a pause, and when Dumbledore said nothing, Harry went on, “If I may ask now, Professor, what exactly are those lessons going to be about?”
CONTENT WARNING: mentions of child abuse, description of scarring
“Definitely,” Severus reassured him quickly.
when you were his age. Well, parts of him at least, a lot of it is Lily, too. But his hair, his cheekbones, his jaw—it’s rather uncanny. And you have just confirmed that you saw Lily one last time, right around the time she must have gotten pregnant.”
“Severus.”
His hopes were destroyed only a couple minutes later when Draco strolled into the kitchen, looking as if he owned the place. Grey eyes trailed over Harry’s, but apart from that both boys resorted to ignoring each other as Draco greeted his mother and sat down. They ate in silence for a while, Narcissa still pottering around at the stove.
his mind supplied. Albus happened. Albus had allowed Harry to stay in an abusive home for eleven years, had allowed Harry to go off on reckless adventures far too dangerous for a boy his age, probably all in the name of preparing him to eventually fight the Dark Lord. Severus felt his barely subdued anger bubble up again.
. Severus didn’t believe that for a single second. He had to admit, however, that the castle’s magic was incredibly flexible and—to a certain degree—could understand where the rumours originated. Hogwarts’ magic had a tendency to be…wilful.
“Well I‘ve changed my mind!“ Severus hissed.
“What are you thinking about, love?” asked Draco softly, wrapping his arms around Harry’s waist from behind and pulling him flush against his chest.
“Yes, that was all, I shan’t keep you any longer. Until the feast!”
he lived. I believed him enough that I never went looking. I was a fool.”
Harry eyed him sceptically. Fred laughed and gestured for them to follow him as he led them towards an inconspicuous door behind the register. They found themselves in a stairway and Harry realised that it must lead to the flat Ron had mentioned the twins now lived in. Fred unlocked the door at the top of the stairs with a flick of his wand and motioned them inside.
“Jeez, Malfoy, have you ever heard of knocking before walking into someone else’s room?” Ron asked, his voice tight. “We’re having a private conversation.”
“We should head to Gringotts first,” his mother said, beginning to walk in the direction of the bank. “I must refill my check-book, and you can withdraw some money from your personal vault, Draco.”
She inclined her head in agreement, not questioning who “we” exactly was.
and then allow it to follow — and it almost always did.
“Like using the Unforgivables on whomever You-Know-Who wants controlled, tortured or killed. Like doing the things a Death Eater is supposed to do.”
Severus blinked, momentarily stunned.
A wave of gratitude at those words, mixed with the immense grief still squeezing his lungs, had Harry dissolve into sobs once more, and he tightened his arms around Remus. This time he wouldn’t let go, wouldn’t waste their time like he had with Sirius. He had barely even seen Sirius in the two years that he’d known him. Remus waited patiently, running his hand up and down Harry’s back soothingly.
Green eyes flashed dangerously, and Draco’s lungs finally filled properly again.
“It’s fine, Draco, I’m fine. It’s all healed, they’re just scars now. They don’t even bother me, it’s alright.”
“Yes, I do,” Draco countered. “You’re clearly upset and I won’t just leave you to deal with it all by yourself, so I’m staying. Do whatever you wanted to do, I’ll just be here if you need me.”
The kitchen smelled delicious. Narcissa stood in front of the stove, waving her wand at the table, where three sets of dishes were currently arranging themselves.
“You really don’t know?”
If Severus hadn’t known that it was an act, he never would’ve guessed it. Harry’s entire demeanour conveyed utter disdain—the sneer perfect, the tone venomous. Severus wouldn’t have been surprised if Draco’s reaction wasn’t entirely faked. He winced slightly, then whirled around with fury written across his face, glaring daggers at Harry.
the same, and you know that. The fact that the mere knowledge that Harry might be your son has changed your attitude towards him so drastically proves that. But I do love Harry like my own, I’ve known him since he was a baby and I regret nothing more than not being there for him as he grew up. I won’t abandon him.”
“Yeah, yeah, whatever, consider it a birthday gift,” Weasley grunted, then added so quietly Severus barely heard him, “We’ll talk about the other thing some more later, alright?”
“What do I care what Potter looks like?” Draco shot back.
“Exactly. Them refusing to accept me as their Defence teacher is not helping that issue.” He rolled his eyes. “At least most of the students in fourth year or above seem to be somewhat competent with the basics, thanks to Harry’s DA lessons last year. Unfortunately, that excludes the Slytherins.”
Draco, I promise. Go back downstairs.”
Remus seized her up carefully; her posture was as perfect as ever, her face composed—she could have sat for a painting like that. “I believe that you could. And I believe that if you did, it would make a noticeable difference in our favour.”
“Later,” he promised, as he pushed Remus off his lap and stood up from his chair.
Four minutes past nine.
why Severus was adding a bedroom, but she wanted to hear him say it.
“No, I mean, you look really good,” Harry mumbled, clearly mortified.
One featherlight charm and a firm kick later, a large rock was rolling straight at Harry, gaining its weight back as Remus removed the charm. It shattered into a thousand pieces before it was even halfway to his cub. Sharp, jagged pieces which were promptly turned into ammunition, flying directly at Remus’ face.
His face must’ve betrayed some of his thoughts, because Potter chuckled and shook his head.
“Alright, cub, take care of yourself.”
“I think you shouldn’t let anyone but me see you in these,” Harry answered, before snapping his mouth shut in horror at what he just said, blushing furiously again. Draco grinned.
Harry nodded. “There’s also a privacy spell on it, so you won’t be able to read what we’ve written so far.”
Draco pursed his lips, thinking. “Let me try something,” he told Severus after a brief pause, and turned back to his station, spelling his cauldron clean and filling it with a fresh basis of distilled water.
“Missed me, Potter?” he drawled, giving Harry his signature arched eyebrow.
is sitting here as if that was the most normal thing in the world?” the Weasel demanded. “They’re a family of Death Eaters, everyone knows that, hell, we were almost killed by Malfoy’s father just a month ago!”
His entire self-image had been shattered that day. His father hadn’t cared one bit. Instead, he’d told Draco that he was disappointed for coming in second-best after a mudblood. Draco had turned his self-hatred against Potter for rejecting him, and against Potter’s friends out of jealousy.
Severus snorted.
“I know,” Harry replied smiling, taking Draco’s hands into his own. “Anyway, so Hermione managed to trick Umbridge and she got carried away by centaurs. Does anyone know what happened to her?”
“There’s nothing to forgive,” he insisted.
“We used to call Sirius ‘Snuffles’, because of his Animagus form. You don’t happen to have one of those, do you?”
unlikely that my one night with Lily resulted in her pregnancy.”
“Gods, Draco,” Potter murmured, his breath hot on Draco’s skin, voice low.
He could’ve just told them the truth right away, but their constant incredulity whenever either Severus or Draco were concerned was starting to really get on his nerves.
Time seemed to be non-existent, as they kept exploring each other, hands wandering slowly, carefully never straying too low. It was as if their minds were synced, both of them moving in the same flow.
Frowning, Severus stepped closer, peering down onto the bed.
“Oh come on, Harry,” the Weasel said, “how bad can it be? It’s not like—”
He could already feel his body tensing, felt the wolf in him stir, ready to emerge at the first sight of the moon. It only took a couple more minutes for the transformation to start. While his bones didn’t technically
Some were harmless; he simply enjoyed teaching and it was fun, and he got to hang out with his friends at the same time. Others were somewhat reasonable, like the idea that it might give him an in with some of the Slytherins which might give him the chance to convince them not to follow Voldemort once they left Hogwarts. And then some were downright selfish, like the thought that he could not fight a war alone, Chosen One or not, and he was going to need as many allies as possible in the battles to come—even if he had to train them himself.
How had he even still had any power left to counter the Sectumsempra after casting a spell strong enough to cleanse all those cursed cuts? How had he not completely exhausted his magical core doing all this? For a long moment, Severus was at a loss for words, simply staring at the boy sitting in front of him with crossed arms, stubbornly looking down, as if he wanted to deny Narcissa’s words.
“The second try?!” Draco exclaimed incredulously.
, always asking for you, even though we’ve told him a million times that you are not and will not be staying with us the entire summer.”
An hour later he was on his second cup of coffee and feeling much more like himself. Blaise was reading the
Then she pulled Harry away from the wall they’d been working on, made him sit down on the couch and asked again, “What are you
“It is absolutely going to be fine,” Remus reassured him.
“I guess so. Anyway, I just wanted to let you know about the DA. I should go now, classes start early tomorrow.”
“It’s for Harry,” he responded as neutrally as possible.
“She said I smell less upset after looking at you, and that you’ll make me feel better,” Harry replied with a broad grin.
Remus smiled at him, breaking off another piece of his chocolate bar and popping it into his mouth, before holding the bar up to Severus.
another, more rational voice admonished, and Draco shook himself. He had to do this—whatever “this” was, given that the entirety of his plan consisted of— Of what? Of confronting Potter in the kitchen, telling him that, yes, Draco would very much like to kiss him? No matter how reckless Draco felt, that was bravery beyond his personal limits.
“He doesn’t have a licence, I’m afraid, and we really should be getting home,” Remus replied. He held out his arm for Harry to grab on to.
Narcissa inclined her head, before standing up and clearing the table. Remus gave him an approving smile. Seemed like he’d given the right answer.
“You said the same thing about Harry being your son, Severus,” Remus countered with a grin.
Harry blushed, but kept grinning.
Slowly, Harry brought up his arms around Draco’s waist to return the embrace, and after a few more moments, Draco finally felt him relax the slightest bit. It was a start. He ran one hand up and down Harry’s back soothingly, the way he had done several times by now after Harry had woken thrashing and screaming from a nightmare. He could feel the scars beneath his palm.
As always thanks so much for reading and I hope you enjoyed it! <3
He forced himself to breathe.
Time. Sixteen years, lost. What were a few weeks longer? At least he had a chance at all.
“Oh please, we both know you and Lily used to be involved with each other. You might have thought you were discreet, but half the staff knew. I also remember how heartbroken you both were when you separated. I’m not surprised in the least that she couldn’t stay away from you for good. Tell me, was it just one time or did you see each other regularly?”
Ron and Hermione were still at Hogwarts. What were they going to say about his new appearance?
“I’m guessing this is why you always kicked me out to change your clothes,” Draco said, trying to keep his voice somewhat light.
Remus got a wistful look then, giving Harry a sad smile. “I know because Sirius would never have cheated on me.”
“He has taken over the Manor, Narcissa, permanently. He even crooned about how he was almost grateful that you disappeared because it practically gifted him a new residence, albeit at the price of not having Draco in his service to gain him entrance into Hogwarts. I’m sorry.”
your father— If there’s anything I can do for you, just say the word.”
“No,” Remus insisted. “Now go pack your books and robes, I don’t want you having to pack in a hurry tomorrow.”
Harry relaxed a little and a small smile tugged on his lips. Draco pulled him closer, pressing a kiss to the top of his head. For several long minutes he just held him, providing as much comfort as he could. Gradually, Harry sank into him until his face was buried firmly in the crook of Draco’s neck and his entire front was plastered to Draco’s side.
The sensation in Severus’ chest was impossible to describe. It felt like his heart had both stopped and started to race at the same time, a tight knot of something
Once more, Severus turned to leave.
Draco just nodded, still covering his face in obvious embarrassment.
“Will you tell me what this is?“ Severus asked, biting back his anger about Albus‘ involvement in Harry’s horrible childhood.
Silence.
“I didn’t mean for it to happen, I didn’t know he would think it was Lily’s child! If I had known that he would go after your mother, after you, I would never have told him. It is the biggest regret of my life. After learning that he thought the prophecy referred to you, I sought out Dumbledore. I begged him to protect you, all of you. Albus agreed to help, if I turned spy for the Order. I accepted immediately and have been a spy ever since, trying to make up for the worst mistake in my life. I’m so sorry, Harry, if I could undo it—” His voice broke.
“I know,” Severus answered, his face softening a little. “Thank you.”
quiet. No noise, no wind, no colours, no thoughts, no emotions.” He looked up at Snape, suddenly feeling awkward. “But it was over after barely more than a second, and it all came back.”
It had been a pure coincidence that it was Dobby who had answered a summon from Severus earlier in the week. After Harry had snuck into Severus’ quarters under his Invisibility Cloak, insisting on spending at least some time in his room that Severus had prepared for him, Severus had sent for a house-elf to fetch Harry’s homework from his dorm to ensure he could at least get his assignments done. Upon seeing Harry, the elf had gone quite frantic and insisted that Harry summon him without hesitation should he ever need anything, even though students weren’t supposed to be able to command Hogwarts’ house-elves. He was probably worried about Harry’s safety with Severus — meddling little elf. Having a house-elf at Hogwarts was a luxury Harry hadn’t expected to appreciate so much, but now that he was pretty much stuck in his dorm if he wanted to avoid the whispers, he was incredibly grateful for having earned Dobby’s loyalty.
“You are a marvel, Harry,” Draco purred, sliding one leg between Harry’s, supporting himself with one arm and letting his other hand trail down Harry’s chest, over his stomach, until it hit the waistband of his pants. Harry’s breath caught again and this time he held it, every nerve in his body on high alert, his entire focus on Draco’s feather light touch trailing the skin right at the edge of the fabric.
have a brain to remember things with, that’s good to know. What’s it to you what I’ve been reading?”
Draco frowned a little. “I don’t wager he’s told you any more about what those lessons are going to be about?”
“Mum and Dad are just outside with Tonks,” answered Ginny. “The Ministry caught wind that you’ll be accompanying us and insisted on having an Auror battalion coming with—Dad somehow managed to talk it down so it’s just Tonks.”
Fred laughed and put up his hands defensively. “Don’t worry, just making sure. So, we don’t hate Malfoy anymore?”
to be like his father, not anymore, but sixteen years of influence were hard to shake.
“Well, I suppose I should go,” Blaise sighed. He shot Pansy a wink as he got out of his seat, adding, “I’ll tell you all about my other cousins when I get back.”
Harry smiled and nodded and let Draco treat the rest of his scars he’d gotten from trying to reach the stove when he was still way too small to cook.
“Alright, say you’re right and the boy really is different. Why does it unsettle you so much?” Minerva asked neutrally.
“There we go,” said Remus’ voice, as he slowly opened his eyes. The blurry face hovering above him wore an expression of concern mixed with amusement. “He’s impressive, isn’t he?”
are a different level of comfortable.”
Remus sank further into the hot water, his head surrounded by mountains of white sparkling foam. The heat of the water had filled the entire bathroom with steam, and he revelled in it. His thoughts drifted back to Sirius, how they’d sat in this bathtub together, in hot water like he did now, skin against skin—
Did Potter know that Severus was a Death Eater? What would he do if he found out? He couldn’t help but feel like it wouldn’t be a standard Potter-tantrum; loud, but ultimately harmless. No, he was…different, somehow. It was hard to pinpoint.
“Give him some time,” she said, pulling him back to the table. “He doesn’t want to talk about this now.”
“I accept your apology, thank you,” she replied. “We’ll see about forgiving you after you’ve kept this behaviour up for a bit.”
He smiled and turned to collect his presents. Severus’ eyes followed him as he walked to the back of the room, but lingered on Molly as his gaze passed over her. She was frowning deeply, not at Charlie from their argument, but at Narcissa. Severus had to suppress a scoff. Of course Molly would not appreciate to see someone else in charge of the household—she was so used to being in control.
He frowned at her. “Are you suggesting you have an idea who the father might be?” he asked.
They stayed like that for what felt like hours, as Harry’s heartbeat slowly returned to normal and his breathing evened out. Finally, it was quiet. No ringing in his ears, no racing heartbeat pulsing through his head, just Draco’s quiet breaths, in synchronisation with his own.
“No, this is ridiculous. Even if they were friends in school, that was years before I was born, there’s no way she’d have— When she got pregnant, that was
“I’m afraid that’s exactly what I’m suggesting. It’s the safest place possible for anyone trying to hide from the Dark Lord. It’s perfect. And since I’ll have to teach Potter, I can check in with you regularly. You’d be safe.”
Harry’s blood was boiling and he had to fight hard to control himself. He felt Draco’s hand on his thigh giving it a light squeeze, grounding him a little. Sirona stirred around his neck and he quickly reached up to soothe her.
The following days had Harry equally distracted—or focused, depending on how you looked at it. In any case, Draco found himself increasingly bored as Harry continued to practice some rather complicated looking charm and obstinately refused to explain what it was for. Eventually, he decided to work on some potions after lunch, rather than watching Harry repeat the same spell over and over until it was time for his practice session with Remus.
“And you have no idea who it is?” Neville followed up.
“You’re saying that as if we knew this for sure. May I remind you that we don’t?” snapped Severus. “Even though you all seem to have agreed on it, we don’t actually
Harry quickly shook his head. He didn’t need Narcissa Malfoy to mother him.
“Hi, Dennis. Did you need anything?”
Which also meant that it should be Severus getting ready for the conversation Remus had been avoiding for two days, not him. Remus buried his face in his hands with a groan. He’d suspected that he’d have to give Harry
you seemed to be. But then you chose Weasley over me, someone I’d been told was leagues beneath me, and I didn’t understand. First I was just confused, but when my father’s reaction was nothing more than flat-out disappointment, I began to resent you. I resented you and I resented Weasley and Granger, because you had something with each other that I never had: Actual friendship. I was jealous and I fucking despised all of you. So I lashed out, because if I couldn’t have
about him! Was that all a lie? Why would you pretend only to drop him again out of nowhere? He’s a human being, not a toy to play with!”
“Aren’t you afraid of their reaction? They won’t like it.”
“Oh, right. Look at this.” Harry pushed the book towards Draco. “See all those annotations? They match the instructions that Severus gave us.”
“I would advise against it,” answered Severus. “It would be best if you acted like you did for the past five years, anything else would be suspicious.”
Harry was struggling to blink away unwanted tears, still stubbornly staring at the wall. He wanted to believe what Remus was saying, he really did. Still, there was a weight on his chest that made it hard to breathe, hard to think.
Remus laughed. “Is Harry likely to drop by? I didn’t get a chance to speak with him, he was swarmed by people.”
, Harry?” Weasley found his voice again, and before Harry could answer, he’d also found his wand, pointing it straight at Draco.
He found Harry in his room watching Draco, as the Slytherin meticulously arranged a mountain of clothes in Harry’s closet. Looking Harry up and down, Remus had to admit that their shopping spree had certainly given Harry a new look that suited him rather well. He looked comfortable and confident, which wasn’t something Remus could observe in the youth as much as he would’ve liked. When Harry noticed him, a wide smile appeared on his face.
“Didn’t you want to look at the book?” Harry asked eventually.
He kept his arms tight around Harry when he pulled back, watching Harry’s eyes flutter open slowly. The green of his irises had darkened and his pupils were blown wide. His dazed expression made Draco want to snog him all over again.
The mere thought of being in a tight space somewhere, hiding, with Harry made a familiar heat pool in Draco’s abdomen. The things he could do to Harry in a secluded alcove somewhere, the things they’d already
“No,” he breathed, “it can’t be. It’s not possible.”
“Yeah,” he said shakily, “we should.”
them, I spelled them! Watch.”
“I— I can feel you. I can feel where you are?” Harry murmured astonished.
It had never been enough.
“But—”
Harry turned to Remus again, desperately hoping he’d tell him they were all wrong, but Remus’ face showed only shocked understanding.
“But that was
“Harry,” Remus said, giving him a somewhat forced smile.
“You can’t be serious!” Lupin exclaimed, throwing up his arms in exasperation.
“He screamed at Ogden whether he knew who he was talking to, showing him a ring — that ring that cursed Dumbledore’s hand. He yelled that it had been in his family for centuries, that it was worth a fortune with the Peverell coat of arms on it.”
“Not even a guess?”
“Of course, we give as good as we get. It’s a vicious cycle, because anything we do to defend ourselves just reinforces their belief that all Slytherins are blood-supremacists waiting to join the Dark Lord. And unfortunately they’re not even completely wrong with it. Slytherin house is full of pure-blooded Death Eater children who, like me, have grown up with blood-supremacy drilled into them.” Draco sighed. “It is what it is.”
“Mmh, I suppose so,” Remus hummed. “I wanted to talk to you, about Albus.”
Harry almost answered, holding himself back at the last second. He glanced over at Remus, who gave him the tiniest shake of his head. Classified information then, they couldn’t risk anyone overhearing that Harry knew about it. Nevertheless, he didn’t want to lie outright, so he resorted to a wordless shrug and continued down the alley. Thankfully, the others followed after barely a second and dropped the subject.
Having already completed his homework for the entire summer, he spent an increasing amount of time in the dried out backyard, practising spells or reading a book he’d snatched from the library. He was bored out of his mind, trying to keep the anxiety lingering in the back of his mind at bay.
“Voldemort may have lost young Mr Malfoy, but he will no doubt try to find another way to kill me. We can not allow that to happen.”
A mild wave of anxiety rolled over him and he slowed down on the last few steps of the stairs. Potter turned back to him with a hint of confusion in his eyes, coming to a halt right at the top of the staircase, Draco two steps behind him. Draco wasn’t sure what to do or say. Would they simply separate here, each go back to their own rooms, and forget about this? He didn’t want to go to his room alone, and he definitely didn’t want to forget about this. His grip on Potter’s hand tightened, and he felt Potter give a squeeze in return, before tugging gently, coaxing Draco to leave the stairs behind, leading them both towards his own room. Draco’s heartbeat quickened a little. He’d never actually seen Potter’s room, the door was always closed, and warded whenever Potter wasn’t there himself.
Harry hesitated, unsure whether it was wise to voice his thoughts. Concern flickered over Narcissa’s face, and she waved her wand at the door to let it fall shut before erecting a silencing charm.
And with that he strode over to the door, breaking the locking charm without even thinking about it, and left. He kept to himself for the rest of the evening, and Draco let him, once more displaying his uncanny ability to know exactly when Harry needed comfort and when he actually wanted to be left alone.
“Of course I agree,” she replied, her voice tight. “So, basic defence and healing. What else?”
“I’ve seen you cast a wordless Patronus, darling. Not what I’d call a simple spell.”
Harry’s father?!”
“Gods, Draco,” he murmured breathlessly, mouth wandering along Draco’s jaw, “you are absolutely…” he nipped at his jawbone, “fucking…” his teeth caught Draco’s ear, making him squirm beneath him,
Severus’ non-verbal attack came so quickly, Draco’s breath hitched, but Harry deflected it with a mere flick of his wand. Soft gasps and “oohs” went around the room; even Blaise made an appreciative noise.
Harry eyed the man suspiciously. “What spell? How does it work? If you think I’m blindly participating in some weird ritual, you’re dead wrong.”
She arched her eyebrow at him, silently daring him to stop there.
“I see. Does that mean you’re still captain?”
“So?” asked Harry. “Were you as good as I predicted or even better?”
“Form.”
Keeping his eyes fixed on Mrs Malfoy, Harry slowly lowered his wand, ready to raise it again in a heartbeat. He wished Remus were here, but he’d left a short while ago because the full moon was that night—if Harry hadn’t woken up, someone else would’ve been sent to watch over him. Harry was infinitely glad that Remus had given him permission to use magic as much as he wanted, regardless of the fact that he was out of school—the charms warding Grimmauld Place concealed any traceable magic, and within a wizarding household, it was usually the parents’ job to keep their children in line.
“I suppose not,” Draco conceded. “Then I guess also third year.”
Harry kept pacing. Then, the now familiar tingling sensation of someone entering the house’s wards paired with the sound of the front door opening startled him to a halt. He didn’t want to go upstairs, not at all. A nudge from Remus finally spurred him into action, and he ascended the stairs warily. Soft voices echoed from the entrance hall.
“You didn’t love him.”
He was cut off by Harry’s hand wrapping around the back of his neck, pulling him forward, and soft lips crashing into his. Forgetting the thirteen pairs of eyes watching them, Draco responded automatically and returned the kiss, one hand sliding up to cup Harry’s face. It was over after barely a moment and Harry pulled back, green eyes shining brightly as he gave Draco a blinding smile.
Trying to make his inspection as objective as possible he flipped through the pages with closed eyes and halted in a random spot. Dreamless Sleep. A feeling of satisfaction went through Harry as he thought back to how they’d brewed enough Dreamless Sleep to supply the hospital wing for a year back at Grimmauld Place. He definitely remembered how that one worked.
“She’s incredible,” said Harry, eyes fixed on the snake. “She says she doesn’t have a name yet, though.” He looked around sheepishly. “Any ideas?”
Severus shook his head. She didn’t understand. The boy was
Meanwhile, Harry’s breathing had evened out, the boy must’ve been absolutely exhausted to fall asleep so quickly. He looked so much younger in his sleep.
Hermione nodded in agreement. “That sounds reasonable, though you did manage to teach third years how to produce a Patronus last year — perhaps more people than you know will be able to move to harder spells.”
“Why didn’t you leave him earlier then? Why now?”
“We both trust him,” Remus went on, “but after today’s revelations, I am not sure I trust him completely anymore, at least not around Harry. I know that due to your position as a spy you won’t be able to publicly treat Harry like your son, but I ask you to keep an eye on him at Hogwarts. He’s involved enough in everything as it is, I don’t want Albus to drag him in any deeper than necessary.”
he breathed exasperatedly, tugging him back into a crushing embrace. “Why the fuck— Do you have any idea
Granger and the Weasel had the decency to look ashamed.
“Sure,” Harry replied, lips twitching like they always did when he tried to smother a smirk.
Potter’s father.”
He shook his head vigorously, stubbornly refusing to believe that ridiculous idea. Unless someone could present him with absolute proof that Snape was actually his father, he wouldn’t believe it.
It took Severus a second to fully grasp what Remus meant.
“You do nothing at all today, my darling, it’s your birthday,” she said dismissively, waving him away before adding, “Do pick up your gifts and bring them to your room before dinner, though.”
. He felt like he was drowning in him, his eyes, his touch, his scent. It was almost a relief when Draco bent down to kiss him again, simply because he could close his eyes to reduce the sensory overload he was trapped in. Almost. Now he was just drowning in the kiss instead of Draco’s eyes, but he was drowning all the same.
All of a sudden, Potter’s grip on Draco’s waist tightened as he briefly broke the kiss, and before Draco could react Potter had spun them around, switching their positions and trapping Draco between himself and the wall instead. Draco’s heart must’ve skipped several beats, because when Potter’s mouth met his again, he felt decidedly dizzy.
“That’s understandable, but would you really want to risk Draco’s safety?”
Another nod.
Harry didn’t move.
Draco furrowed his brows in confusion.
“No, you didn’t! He was possessed by Voldemort and you just defended yourself,” argued Hermione, sounding desperate.
“That reminds me, I have made some progress regarding Harry’s relatives.”
“Of course I was,” she laughed. “How many times do I have to be right before you start believing me, Severus?”
Fact number one: He was Snape’s son. Snape was his father.
“Then why did you hate
“You are not broken, and you are not a freak. He’s a filthy arsehole and a liar and he deserves to suffer for everything he did to you. No, I won’t go murder him,” Draco assured quickly when Harry opened his mouth to interrupt. “Even though I would bloody well like to, I won’t. Ultimately, I don’t care about what happens to him—if he suffers I’ll be glad, but that’s secondary. First and foremost, I care about you. I thought I understood everything of relevance about your childhood, but it seems I was very wrong. I’m sorry I didn’t realise sooner why you were so reluctant, I should’ve seen the connection, I—”
“Gotta admit, he’s rather fit these days,” Blaise interjected, and Draco had to control himself to refrain from glaring at him.
“GET OUT! GET OUT, NOW! YOU TOO, OUT, BOTH OF YOU, OUT!”
“Draco and Narcissa picked it all out, I barely had any say in it,” he replied, smoothing down the front of his jumper. “I do want some Muggle clothes eventually though. Wizards attire is all good and fine, but a comfortable t-shirt and a nice pair of jeans, or
Draco was delighted to be able to rile Potter up again, and he absolutely revelled in the heat that filled Potter’s eyes every time they exchanged glares. Admittedly, Potter was still
“Yeah, thanks.”
“Voldemort is a half-blood?!” It was the first thing Draco could think of, but even as the words left his mouth he realised how stupid it was, compared to all the other information Harry had just thrown at him. To his relief, Harry chuckled.
He was surprised to see something like wonder pass over Dumbledore’s features. Surely the headmaster of Hogwarts must know about the castle’s secrets, right? The air of surprise on Dumbledore’s face passed as quickly as it had appeared, and the old wizard looked nothing but serene again.
their time together, which frankly impressed Remus if he thought back to how he and Sirius had been back at that age. James had nearly lost his mind around them sometimes. Once more he wished times could be as simple as back then again. Even though, if he was truly honest with himself, times hadn’t been simple back then either.
But Harry didn’t stay on top of Draco, instead rolling over on his side, extinguishing the light of his wand, and pulling Draco close, kissing him again. It felt decidedly more intimate to be kissing in a bed, rather than standing in a kitchen, but after only a few moments, Draco’s anxiety receded. He might not be experienced, but judging from Harry’s reactions he wasn’t doing all that bad.
. He sighed heavily and allowed himself to return to his ruminations from the previous night.
“There’s more?” Ron asked incredulously and Harry laughed. Just a few hours ago at the beginning of the party, Ron had anxiously asked about the contents of the prophecy. Apparently Harry’s relationship reveal had shocked him so thoroughly that he’d promptly forgotten about it again.
Severus gave a weak nod as they fell back into silence. He didn’t know what to say. Didn’t know what to think. Was he supposed to go after Po— Harry? They hadn’t actually confirmed that he was truly his father, even though he could no longer deny that all signs pointed to yes. What was he supposed to do?
washed over them, as Remus quickly guided Harry away from the apparition point they’d arrived at. Harry instinctively looked for Draco, but Remus shook his head.
After a cautious glance to make sure the corridor was actually empty, Severus led them past his office door and to a large portrait a little further down the hallway. It showed a noble looking woman with long dark hair and light eyes, wearing a dark red corset dress and a long cape of green velvet draped over her shoulders. She greeted Severus with a polite bow of her head, then arched her painted eyebrow at Harry.
Harry gave him an exasperated look and rolled his eyes.
“What did you do?” Severus growled, stalking past Harry towards him.
“Harry!”
“Draco!” Severus shouted, cutting through Draco’s rising voice. “He
the voice insisted. He frowned. He couldn’t imagine Lily to break her marriage vows, and yet, Harry clearly wasn’t James Potter’s son.
I hope you enjoyed it and thanks for reading! <3
“It was yours, wasn’t it?”
She raised an eyebrow at him. “Oh? And who would that be?” she asked, just as the sound of steps echoed from the stairs and Potter came into the entrance hall.
“He has lost his mind!” Severus cried, throwing his arms in the air. “Even if I were considering to do what you ask, how would I ever explain this to Harry?”
“You are such a—ridiculously—sappy—Gryffindor.” Draco accentuated every word with a kiss and Harry laughed against his lips. “Thank you,” whispered Draco, holding Harry’s face between his hands, holding his gaze intently. “They’re absolutely brilliant and I can’t believe you didn’t tell me about it earlier.”
Severus gave him a tight smile, then went to enter his new quarters.
Lupin smiled at him. “I doubt he’ll join us,” he said as he opened the door and stepped out into the hallway. “In fact, I’m fairly sure he won’t. Narcissa was right when she said he’d need some time to calm down. Knowing Harry we won’t see him for another few hours at least.”
Remus nodded, laughing again.
to feel Draco’s skin against his own. He tugged the shirt up impatiently, prompting Draco to sit up and pull it over his head. It landed somewhere on the floor, not that either of them paid it any heed.
Draco suppressed a grin as he remembered his own mother’s reaction. Of course she had known, even though Draco hadn’t told anyone, not even Pansy—at least not explicitly. Pansy was bound to know, though, after how their brief experimental bout at the Yule Ball had gone.
par (lat.) = match
Maybe he could redecorate his room upstairs, make it feel like it was actually his. He owned a house now. He had a home.
“What reasons?” Harry asked, his eyes hard. “Which students?”
As a result, he had arrived more than half an hour earlier than they’d planned to meet, which was just as well in case Harry was done earlier with his “lesson” with Dumbledore — whatever those were about. The first ten minutes or so, he’d even tried to work on his Transfiguration essay. He’d checked the clock approximately twenty times in those ten minutes. Eventually, he’d given up and resorted to pacing unceasingly from desk to bed and from the bed back to the desk instead.
“I like you, too,” he said softly, and Draco wished he could capture that sentence out of Harry’s mouth and bottle it, just so he could keep it with him all the time. Pulling Harry down, Draco kissed him again, and for a few minutes they were both too distracted to continue their conversation.
subscriptio (lat.) = signature
“Your wish is my command,” Draco replied with a carnal grin, his hand going back down Harry’s torso, this time not stopping at the waistband but instead ghosting over the outline of his erection.
“So,” Harry murmured, dipping his head to run his lips along Draco’s neck, “what were you so distracted by before?”
Harry choked on his drink.
Thank Merlin for adults actually acting like adults, right? How do we feel about kinda-having-feelings-but-very-good-at-rationalising Severus? Can’t possibly go wrong, right?
“Never mind,” Harry said, smiling. “Let’s just go.”
His attention snapped back to her. She had tears in her eyes and looked incredibly guilty. He shook his head, he didn’t want to hear any apologies, he just wanted her to breathe and continue breathing. She managed to sit up and he immediately pulled her into a hug, which she returned with a surprising amount of strength. She was crying.
“He’s gay, for Merlin’s sake!” Lupin snapped. His amusement disappeared abruptly, replaced by immense grief. “Was gay, I mean. Not that it’s any of your business.”
Harry blinked at him, looking taken aback.
“So?” Malf—
“Just saying,” he murmured, taking a sip of his butterbeer.
The clock on the wall struck nine, and Draco counted each deep, rich chime. He kept pacing.
Last edit: Grammar & detail fixes, 15.5.2021
Tears began to spill from his eyes for the first time since his conversation with Remus on the day he’d woken up at Grimmauld Place. Grief, sadness, anger and desperation caught up with him, swallowing him, choking him, suffocating him. Sinking down to his knees, Harry buried his face in his hands and, for the first time in years, simply let go.
“Well, there are also plenty of Slytherins hexing people from other houses,” Harry argued.
“I’m not—”
it was hard to focus while it was lingering. Remus compelled himself to keep breathing, slowly getting rid of the very sensory reminder of the encounter.
Severus sighed relievedly, giving a quick nod in agreement.
Severus waited patiently as the two shared a kiss; he knew it must be much harder for those two to play the roles of enemies than it was for him to feign dislike for Harry.
Draco almost burst out laughing, only barely managing to hold back. The twins, however, had no such inhibitions and roared with laughter, which in turn destroyed Draco’s self-control within seconds and he dissolved in giggles. While he was gasping for breath, he registered that almost everyone was laughing now, even Granger couldn’t suppress a small chuckle, although she did not look entirely pleased. The most prominent exception was Weasley, who looked extremely put out, his face red with anger.
Harry’s mind, however, lingered on to the wandmaker. Why had Voldemort taken him? The question had been haunting him ever since Severus had told them about Voldemort’s latest hostage. Since his Occlumency had improved to a level where he was able to fend off even genuine attempts of Severus to break into his mind, his visions of Voldemort had practically stopped completely. He still felt occasional twinges of pain in his scar, but he never saw into Voldemort’s mind anymore. He was loath to admit that he missed it sometimes—not because he liked it, but because he felt like he’d lost an edge that he’d had over him. It had saved Arthur’s life, hadn’t it? What if he could have saved another life if he hadn’t blocked Voldemort out?
As always I hope that was enjoyable and I’d love to hear your thoughts.
He knocked a third time before pulling out his wand and sending a soft spell against the wards, just enough so whoever was inside would feel it. Finally, there was movement inside and two seconds later, the door was ripped open to reveal a scowling Severus. At the very least, he did seem to be alright and had not been called away by Voldemort.
“Still want me to get out of your way?” Draco asked, his voice husky.
Narcissa went on undeterred, “I acknowledge that I spoiled him to compensate for Lucius’ shortcomings as a father, which did him no favours in regards to his behaviour when he was younger. But Draco is good at his core. He may still have some growing up to do, but he is not like Lucius. He is no killer.”
“But you didn’t follow the instructions!” Hermione complained.
“Those are wandless spells!” she exclaimed.
“Perhaps we should relocate this conversation to the kitchen,” Remus suggested.
Draco nodded and was gone in a heartbeat. Only a few seconds later, Remus appeared in the door-frame and froze momentarily, as he took in the scene before him. He snapped out of it after barely an instant, hurrying to Narcissa’s side and drawing his wand. Harry joined them on the other side of the table, trailing his wand along the wounds on Severus’ right arm and murmuring the most common spells to heal cuts. Like Narcissa, he had little success. A glance over to Remus confirmed that neither of them was doing any better. At this rate, Severus would die.
“They’re fine, they’re all safe and sound back at Hogwarts. They worry about you. Dumbledore had to swear to them that you’re safe, otherwise they’d have abandoned Hogwarts immediately to look for you. Hermione and Ginny were especially fierce in their demand to know where you are.”
“You are a marvellous young man, Harry,” she said, as she slowly got to her feet, swaying slightly. Both Harry and Severus quickly jumped up to steady her, leading her to a chair and forcing her to sit down. She smirked at them.
They were interrupted when Dennis Creevey approached their table, drawing Harry’s attention as he felt the intrusion on his Muffliato bubble. He silenced Ron with a glance and turned to Dennis.
He never managed to finish his sentence, as he was hit with the Cruciatus curse. Dropping to his knees, he tried not to scream, but it was hard to tell whether he succeeded or not.
“Er, sure? What do I have to do?”
“Well, er, yes,” Slughorn stuttered, “Mr Malfoy’s potion is admittedly outstanding, but—”
If Severus hadn’t known for a fact that the man standing in front of him was not even sixteen years old, he wouldn’t have believed it. Slowly, he nodded.
“Good night,” said Pansy without taking her eyes off Daphne, who was beet-red and clutching her glass as if it was the only thing that kept her from combusting on the spot.
“No.”
Fun fact: every time I write something like implying 1AM is late I have to laugh, because chances are I’m writing it at 5AM. What even is sleep? I wish I was half as functional as my characters.
Not keen on having his mother intercept him, he made his way upstairs as quietly as possible.
They were distinctly different; not just by looks, but also in how they
Harry nodded agreeably, happy that Remus hadn’t simply declared it off limits.
Edit:
Harry’s wandering hand disappeared. For a split-second Draco mourned the loss of it, then he gasped as Harry’s mouth closed around the tip of his erection. The feeling of a tongue, hot, wet, and perfect, tasting him. Draco moaned again, louder than before.
Harry smiled. “Regardless of how flashy that duel was, in the end I achieved a victory with a very simple spell most of you should be familiar with: Expelliarmus. Now, I know it’s an old and boring thing, but basics are everything, so we’ll revise that spell. If you’ve mastered it you can move on to other things, don’t worry.”
and was removing some sort of spectacles from the middle of it.
All in all, he barely looked like himself. For several minutes, Harry simply stood there, examining his new face—and body. He felt…taller. Was he taller? How could he be sure— broom, yes.
The blush on Draco’s pale cheeks intensified.
The first thing Remus noticed were the dramatically increased amount of casual touches between the boys. While they’d certainly been attached before, there had never been quite this much open affection, especially with people around. Now they barely kept their hands off each other, going so far as Harry apparating behind Draco to disarm him manually and then promptly sweeping him into an embrace and kissing him during a duel. Remus then also noticed that Draco had suddenly started to use mostly physical distractions to cheer Harry up whenever he seemed down—which was a rather frequent occurrence due to Severus’ behaviour. While that in itself wouldn’t have been concerning, the nature of those distractions went quite a bit beyond an embrace and a peck on the cheek. No, Draco was using the same method to cheer Harry up as Sirius had always used to cheer Remus up around the full moon. And Remus knew where that method led.
. Tragic, it bloody well sucks, but I can deal with it. Have dealt with it my entire life. But if— If he rejects me, I’ll be an orphan because I’m
Draco struggled to keep breathing as he felt something rush through him that was near impossible to describe. It felt warm and gentle and tight and serene and exciting all at once, a wave of sweetness, even though sweetness wasn’t supposed to be something you could feel but something you could taste—he felt it. It simultaneously made him want to laugh with giddy excitement and wrap himself around Harry so tightly that nothing could ever separate them again. He settled for kissing him once more.
Draco scowled and pulled out his wand. “Watch your mouth, Potter.”
Severus could only stare at him in amazement. When had he grown up so much? When had he become so…
“If you apologise to them I’m sure—”
“What the hell was that?” Harry demanded, glaring at Severus.
“Angrier. I honestly expected you to tell me you never wanted to see me again. And I wouldn’t have blamed you for it either, what I did was reprehensible.”
Harry didn’t respond, still looking rather dejected. Draco sighed. The previous day had been a lot for Harry and his night couldn’t have been the most restful either, sleeping on a giant wolf. And even before, Draco had watched Harry’s eyes go vacant sometimes, as if he was a million miles away, and Harry would frown deeply, lost in whatever issue he was pondering. It was no different now. He seemed trapped in his thoughts, and Draco’s reassurances didn’t seem to reach him. Perhaps it was time to get Harry out of his head for a little while, Draco decided.
“Welcome everyone, thank you for coming — I didn’t expect so many of you, to be completely honest,” said Harry as Remus went back to watching the crowd.
“So, are you happy with your grades overall?” asked Remus, steering the conversation away from Harry and Draco’s old rivalry tendencies.
Now, Severus was trying to get that intricately woven net of spells embedded into the very stone of Hogwarts to obey his will and provide him with more rooms. Albus had assured him that it was no problem to simply transform the walls into rooms.
Special thanks to
Potter repeated, his voice laced with anger.
Why on earth was Snape here with them?
“It’s time,” she said. Harry scowled at her and she smiled, “I don’t like this any more than you do, Harry, I hated sending Draco off every single year—now there’s two of you I have to say goodbye to.”
“Y— You did?” Severus’ face was incredulous.
he realised. Fuck. Those daggers were cursed to prevent regular healing potions and spells from affecting the resulting wounds.
Millicent raised a disbelieving eyebrow at him.
on the back of it.
Remus sat dumbfounded at that confession. He hadn’t known that. Severus looked at him sadly.
brewing?” asked Severus, looking over Draco’s station in an obvious attempt at figuring it out based on his ingredients. Draco was almost certain that this would be one of the few recipes Severus didn’t know.
“He’ll torture you,” Harry interrupted. “I’ve seen inside his mind often enough to know what happens to Death Eaters who displease him. Go, you’re already late.”
He bid Minerva good night and hastily made his way towards the dungeons. Time to get some peace and quiet before term would start in earnest the next day.
A wide smile spread on Draco’s face and his stomach fluttered pleasantly.
Originally, there was some actual plot in this one, including quite a bit of angst. My dear friend and best-motivator Alex (PotionDaddy), then complained that there had been an awful lot of angst since we established Drarry - with the torture and the healing and then Harry’s sad thoughts and the heavy conversation with Severus. So I cut the chapter in half in the middle and went with the fluffiest fluff instead and sent them all shopping together. Yay!
Draco did his best to feign boredom, even as his stomach did an uncomfortable flip. “Does he now? And why would that be of interest to me?”
Remus only half-listened as Harry’s speech went on. Even though Harry wasn’t following Hermione’s script — which had earned him a rather scandalised expression from the witch — Remus had heard enough about his plans and ideas for the DA to know what he would likely say.
“You…and Sirius?” Harry caught himself, getting over his initial surprise quickly. “I thought you two were just friends? How did I never notice any of that in the last two years?”
Severus immediately launched into a story of how the house-elves had suddenly refused to deliver his meals to his room, forcing him to go to the kitchen, where he’d found Narcissa waiting for him. Remus almost laughed. Narcissa certainly had her ways to get what she wanted, he was almost salty he didn’t think of that himself. Then again, the elves probably wouldn’t have followed his order before Severus’, since he wasn’t the one who owned them. Severus explained how Narcissa had confronted him about his retreat and how he was hurting Harry. Then he described how she had collapsed and Harry had suddenly been there, how he’d realised that she’d broken the Unbreakable Vow by spilling Harry’s secret to someone he did not want to know, and how he’d removed the vow to save her.
“You taught them the correct versions I presume?”
how I feel about him!” complained Draco, giving him a rather nasty look.
“Or Draco,” he mumbled, blushing slightly, but she continued to stare him down until he finally rolled his eyes and added, “Or you.”
“No, you are most definitely not a charity case,” she agreed. “But you
Harry paused. For a snake, she was remarkably astute.
“I thought it was
Another pause stretched between them. When Harry’s itch to fill the silence had almost approached his limit, Dumbledore stood from his desk.
“Yes, Potter, it’s just me. Just Malfoy. Look at me, just look at me.”
He trailed off, giving Draco a somewhat sheepish look. Meanwhile Draco’s heart was doing its best to beat right out of his chest.
“It shouldn’t matter whether you knew. Are you telling me if Voldemort had gone after Neville, you wouldn’t have cared? You’d have stayed a faithful little Death Eater? Is that what you’re saying?”
“So this goblin, Burgock, did a scan and suddenly tells me that I’ve inherited estates that I haven’t claimed yet, and asks whether I want to claim them now. I thought he must mean Sirius’ estate, y’know, because he named me heir of the Black lineage, so I said yes, and he summons this scroll with all my inheritances on it.”
“So, how are you and Harry doing?” Minerva asked eventually.
Now to the actual note for this chapter:
, Minerva?” he asked irritably.
But they shouldn’t have stayed in the Room of Requirement overnight to begin with, and if they didn’t show up soon there would undoubtedly be questions they’d be unable to answer. They parted with great reluctance, both seemingly wanting to hang on to their lingering intimacy as long as possible. Draco left first with Harry’s Invisibility Cloak to sneak down to the dungeons without anyone questioning what he’d done up on the seventh floor so early. Harry could pick it up in Severus’ rooms later.
He forced himself to relax. Nobody was attacking him.
Remus was incredibly tired. He’d barely managed to get out of bed, then struggled to stay awake while waiting for Severus and through lunch. It was high time for a nap. Or a bath. Yes, a bath would do him worlds of good, he decided.
He leaped behind his tree again, narrowly avoiding the fastest shards. He exhaled, his heart already pounding, adrenaline shooting through his blood. Taking a deep breath, he stepped out from his cover, ready to attack anew.
“Why?” he choked out, tears filling his eyes. “Why would she do that?”
And then he was ranting about Harry Potter. Again, none of the things he spat were new, but to Severus they felt like fresh hot iron against cool unprotected skin. Before, it had been the Dark Lord raving about Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived and whom Severus did not care for beyond the fact that he seemed to be essential to winning this war. Now it was the Dark Lord swearing gruesome death upon Harry Potter,
He paused. Harry was watching him closely, paying more attention than Severus had ever seen from him before.
“Which room would you want me to take? It is your house as I understand it, after all.”
“How are you so
Harry tensed immediately.
, yanking Remus’ head back and baring his neck, which he promptly latched on to. Heat shot through Remus’ body and he allowed his hands to drop from Severus’ waist to his arse, pressing their crotches together. Severus moaned into his neck before pulling away with a gasp. Black eyes found his and Remus’ heart hitched.
“See you at dinner.”
“Severus,” Remus said softly, distracting him from the two boys. “What did You-Know-Who do to you? What happened at that meeting?”
The other unknown brother—Charlie, apparently—sauntered to the armchair next to where the Weaslette sat, followed by Mr and Mrs Weasley who sat down on the small two-seater on the lower end of the coffee table, directly opposite Draco’s seat. Granger had apparently gotten over her initial shock and stepped into the room, but paused when the Weasel didn’t follow.
“Mr Potter,” he said in that silky tone he always used in the classroom, his eyes clocking the Slytherins down the hallway, “come in.”
Pansy had already discussed Harry’s “new” face over dinner. Extensively. Somehow managing to feign distraction, Draco had avoided the conversation completely.
“Okay,” he mumbled, burying his face in Harry’s shoulder. He didn’t resist as Harry manoeuvred them over to the couch, settling them into their usual position to cuddle and read.
He quickly sent a Patronus to Lupin, announcing his visit in a few hours along with a careful mention of potential guests, before immediately conjuring another one and sending it ahead to Albus to request a meeting as he began to make his way towards the headmaster’s office.
Merlin, why hadn’t they done this years ago, instead of all the idiotic fighting?
Both of them were gaping at him now with wide-eyed shock.
Oh, right. Because he was head over heels in love with him.
“Could you be
He had anticipated rumours and gossip thanks to his new face. What he hadn’t expected were the giggling and gaping hordes following him around wherever he went. Six different girls, one as young as a
A few moments later, he set down his fork and turned to Harry, who was already finished.
“I’m honestly not sure,” Draco replied with a weak chuckle.
“Of course I am, but I’ll have to face it eventually, there’s no way around that. I’d rather tell them now and deal with it here, than watch Ron have a heart attack in the Great Hall.”
He clenched his fists, forcing himself to keep his voice level. “Not now,” he ground out through clenched teeth.
* Sirona’s danger rating is based on the danger ratings explained in
“I’m not talking about Sirius,” she said cautiously, her eyes flitting back and forth between the people at the table.
Severus and Remus reached the dining room then and stepped inside, slowing down for a moment in surprise. The table had been slightly enlarged to accommodate fifteen people, and the room was filled with subtly glowing decorations. Narcissa had done a thorough job in preparing Grimmauld Place for Harry’s birthday—or at least given comprehensive orders to the elves.
A platform rose underneath Harry, elevating him by more than a foot. Remus had to suppress a chuckle. The Room of Requirement was nothing if not obliging.
He started by telling Draco again about never being given his own clothes and having to wear Dudley’s hand-me-downs despite them being way too big—he already knew about that. Then he told him how he hadn’t known when his birthday was for the longest time, because they only ever celebrated Dudley’s, never his, and how his Christmas presents usually consisted of tiny garbage items like paper-clips, while his cousin was drowning in presents. He told him about never being allowed to go on vacations with them, having to stay with Mrs Figg instead. He told him about all the little degrading things they’d done over the years to make him feel like he was worthless, like only calling him “boy” or “freak” and never his name, while praising Dudley to the moon and back. He told him how Dudley had bullied him, literally hunting and chasing him to use him as his personal punching bag.
She laughed. “Consider it an early birthday gift. Now, shall we finish this wall before I go and make dinner?”
Severus nodded. “At least they have each other, indeed,” he said quietly, and for some reason Remus felt his pulse quicken slightly at that.
She shook her head, pushed back the sleeves of her robe and showed him both her forearms. No Dark Mark. Harry relaxed a little.
Remus hesitated. He seemed sincere. Slowly, he nodded, finally uncrossing his arms. Severus visibly relaxed.
“I thought it was brilliant,” Ron chimed in.
His only consolation throughout the week had been Draco, who was possibly the only person who hated all the attention Harry was getting even more than Harry himself. And that was saying something.
“This one’s mine,” Lupin said, pointing at the door on the left, before turning to the right door, “That’s yours. There’s a shared bathroom in the middle, you can access it directly from your room.”
Severus laughed. “You should have heard him complain about that. ‘That vial was easily worth fifty galleons! I should have made them share!’ He went on through the entire dinner.”
The response never came. Instead, Harry heard a loud thunk and a gasp, followed by Severus’ panicked calls, “Narcissa? Narcissa!”
“Of course not, Draco, but that’s his own responsibility, not yours! Or perhaps it would be Severus’ responsibility, but he is hardly available right now. Either way, you are staying here.”
“My hero,” Draco drawled, but he took the plate and popped a piece of cheese into his mouth.
that Ron had brought from the cupboard, only sparing it half a glance before simply starting to brew the potion by memory. Once the concoction in his cauldron was at a stage where it had to simmer for several minutes, he allowed himself to take a look around the classroom. Unsurprisingly, Draco seemed to be doing just as well as he was. Harry fought the urge to grin again; Slughorn would be hard pressed to decide a winner between the two of them.
“It’s really simple actually,” she said nonchalantly. “James Potter isn’t Harry’s actual father, and he looks different because his mother had put a bunch of charms on him to make him look like James Potter and those are now gone. The end.”
“If that’s what you want to call it,” Pansy shrugged. “But don’t tell me you’ve been this
,” complained Draco.
. He would not let anyone in here right now, and he’d definitely not go outside. That door was to remain
He eyed her for a moment, getting an odd sense of deja-vu, before taking her outstretched hand and shaking it once. Her skin felt warmer than he’d expected.
“Yes, I am.”
Too stunned for words, he simply held out his hand to let him see. Draco gasped.
“Oh yes, Severus, it is my business,” Lupin interjected. “If you slept with Lily while she was with James— If you were with her around the time she got pregnant, you could actually be Harry’s father. And if you are, he has a right to know that. So quit the nonsense and just tell me what happened between you and Lily. Why would you let Harry believe that there was something going on if it isn’t true?”
And if he was too lazy to floo home before morning, nobody would know.
Guilt had weighed heavily on him throughout all of fifth year as he helped to stomp out a resistance against Umbridge he’d rather have joined than eradicated. He still bullied Potter, only now it felt so much worse because Potter had
for beta reading!
“Yes, yes, fuck, I—” But he didn’t have words. He forced himself to lift his head off the wall and look down at Harry. He almost came at the sight of Harry kneeling in front of him, his mouth around Draco’s cock, staring up at him with blazing eyes. The heat in those green eyes was so intense it sent a shudder through Draco’s entire body. No words. He opened his mouth uselessly, trying to do as Harry had requested and tell him what he wanted, but he had no words, doubted he’d ever have words again.
He thought back to their dinner the previous day. The atmosphere had admittedly been quite tense, and Harry had found himself wishing that Remus were there multiple times. Following an unspoken agreement they’d avoided mentioning the war, Voldemort, or really anything that could’ve ended in an awkward conversation; which didn’t leave a lot to work with. Harry knew Narcissa probably had questions about his changed appearance, but he’d been relieved to find that she’d apparently decided to keep quiet about them for now. He wasn’t sure whether he could’ve explained without breaking down.
“I suppose finally escaping my father’s influence had an impact,” he replied evenly. “His expectations have dictated most of my life up until now, I never had a chance to actually be myself before.” Whatever being himself entailed, she didn’t have to know that he was still struggling with that.
Draco suppressed a grin. If
Harry felt a blush rise in his cheeks, but he met Dumbledore’s gaze steadily as he replied, “It wasn’t meant to be spectacular, I simply wanted to get detention. A cover is worthless if it is not believable.”
“Dad,” he whispered.
“Sit down, Severus,” she ordered, her tone allowing no argument.
Harry grinned and leaned over to give Draco a kiss. Severus kept his eyes fixed forward to avoid automatically glancing at Remus. Did he notice? Was
Sudden understanding crashed into Draco like a hex, followed by a feeling of overwhelming guilt. He’d assumed Harry simply didn’t care about how he dressed, he had never expected that he had nothing else to wear. From the little Harry had said about his relatives so far, first something about being used to going hungry and now this, Draco began to suspect that Harry’s childhood was very different from what he had always imagined.
Severus shook his head. “Oh no, Minerva, you lost that particular bet to
yourself? Have you
He described the vision Voldemort had sent him, how they had tried to reach Sirius through the Floo but came up with nothing. Then he went on to recall how Umbridge had captured them with her Inquisitorial Squad, which caused Draco to blush furiously again—it had happened several times during Harry’s stories, whenever he’d been involved in a way he now regretted.
, but let this note be the acknowledgement that it existed. And it existed with the worst timing because I have a paper due and exams coming up in only three weeks (mid-December) and it’s easy to avoid working on overcoming the block by telling myself that uni is more important anyway. I mean it is, but you get me.
your own clothes that fit you and it’s a shame that this should be the first time for you to get some.”
“I must say, Harry, I am very impressed.” Something in Dumbledore’s voice made Harry tense and he snapped his eyes up to the headmaster. “You said that you ‘made your magic pointy’ — could you explain how?”
Harry chuckled and took the potion without arguing. The effect was immediate and the ringing in his ears receded a little. He felt stronger again.
“I might not like him, no, but anyone with a brain can see that Harry is happy with him, and isn’t that what matters?”
“Describe it to me.” Snape’s tone made clear that there would be no argument about this.
Severus looked up, surprised. He hadn’t expected his decision to be questioned, especially not if Remus’ chance at a mostly painless transformation was at stake.
“An incredibly dark spell, openly accessible to anyone who found this book, without any explanation whatsoever. Without the counter-curse.” Severus exhaled slowly. “Thank Merlin it was
Draco inhaled sharply when Harry nipped at his ear, and his voice was a little wobbly when he replied, “You. Speaking Parseltongue.”
He came with a shout, his eyes rolling back into his head.
to brew it. I can hardly set up in the kitchen, Narcissa would have my head. I could do it in here, but there’s barely enough space, and I don’t fancy sleeping in some of these fumes produced during the process.”
“That’s new,” said Draco before Severus could even take a breath. “That’s definitely new. I’ve been here plenty of times and I would have noticed a second bedroom of that size. This used to be an unused study or something and that door was practically hidden behind the fireplace.”
Now that they were alone, neither of them was trying too hard to resist the gravitational pull towards the other. Draco leaned into his touch and Harry smiled. The past week had been quite the revelation. Things between them were still fresh, raw. But good. They hadn’t talked about everything yet, not by a long shot, but there had been much needed conversations regarding the most recent events before Harry had disappeared from Hogwarts.
“What happened last Saturday,” Remus began, “What was it, to you?”
Draco didn’t fully manage to suppress his laughter and it came out as a strangled sound that he quickly tried to cover with a gasp, feigning outrage. Then his gaze fell on Hermione and the look of pure horror on her face almost made him lose it again. He tried to focus on something—anything—else, anything that wasn’t so goddamn hilarious as the shocked expressions of his classmates or the genuine surprise in Severus’ eyes as he processed Harry’s comeback.
tag: Hyperfocus.
She just smiled at him as she flicked her wand at the cups, spelling them to self-clean. “I’ll be seeing you for dinner then?” she asked as she walked towards the door.
“Quidditch Captain! Harry that’s amazing, congratulations!” He beamed at Harry for a second, before his face suddenly fell and turned into a scowl. “Oh no, that means Slytherin has to train double this year, brilliant.”
“Sure, let’s get it done,” he conceded, and they resumed their work on the wallpaper.
He didn’t trust his voice enough to say any more. Severus hugged him back, then stepped away, picked up his suitcase, and disapparated.
Of course, he’d never dream of asking young students to fight for him, but the older years were bound to be involved in this war one way or another soon enough. Was it really wrong if he actively worked for them to support him instead of Voldemort? Was it selfish to prepare them for battles that might cost them their lives if they actually decided to stand with him?
“I’ll see that Draco behaves,” she assured him. Harry smothered a grin at the image of Malfoy being berated by his mother for bothering him.
Severus swallowed as he remembered the prophecy. Harry had to kill the Dark Lord. Why did it have to be him? Why did the universe give Severus a son, just to immediately dangle a blade above his neck? Was he doomed to love people that were being hunted by the Dark Lord? Because he would be coming after Harry, Severus was sure of it.
“Do you know what curse he used? Is there a way to counteract it?”
“Open the door to the library,” he grit out, as he tried to keep Dumbledore, who seemed to be at least semi-conscious, upright.
That means that the first part (Summer) of this fic is done, and we’re on to the second part. I will still include as many Severus and Remus POVs as possible, but from here on out it’s probably gonna be increasingly Harry and Draco focused (Harry even more than Draco), because that’s where most of the story happens, naturally.
Draco’s voice had jumped an octave higher. The usually so composed boy looked downright terrified, eyes darting back and forth between Harry and Remus.
If Harry was bothered by the fact that Severus put Draco in charge rather than him, he didn’t show it. Instead, he simply drew his wand and set it to buzz at the exact same time as Severus’. For a moment, the simple yet elegantly effective variation of the charm made Severus pause in amazement. That wasn’t a spell taught at Hogwarts. That wasn’t even a spell Severus knew himself. He shook his head once, forcing his focus back to the situation at hand. He opened his mouth to say something, but Harry cut him off.
Anyway I hope you liked it and thanks for reading! <3
Harry grinned. “That’s perfect! Raven could even be a regular name, so if anyone asks who Raven is, I’ll just say I had someone tutor me over the summer—Chosen One training or some bullshit like that, most people will believe anything.”
The only warning Harry got were soft steps on the stairs before Remus entered, closely followed by Snape. He must’ve stayed at Grimmauld Place overnight.
“Good,” Snape said curtly. “I trust you will spend increased efforts on practising then. I want you to clear your mind every evening before going to bed, as you should have before.”
them instead, but Severus distracted him with another kiss and his wand was out of reach, so he resigned himself to work through the endless row of buttons, just to uncover another row of buttons on the waistcoat, then another one on the shirt underneath.
Draco wasn’t sure how to handle any of this, didn’t know how to react. He was frozen in shocked silence, gaping motionless into the darkness. Harry lifted his head and put a hand on Draco’s cheek.
It can in some cases be quite a strain on relationships. Even in this chapter, Draco feels sort of ignored by Harry — it just doesn’t go on for long enough to truly grow into an issue. In real life, things aren’t always that neatly solved within three days, nor do obsessions just vanish if your partner needs more attention. Neither does hyperfocus let you go when you really really should be focusing on something else (like work or school), which can have quite drastic consequences over time. It can be a difficult thing to manage and I wanted to include it.
Harry gaped at her, speechless for a second, then shook his head again vehemently.
“You look better. How are you feeling?” asked Remus.
“It is beyond my ability to fully remove the curse,” Severus began, switching topics abruptly. “I was able to contain it in your hand, for now, but it will spread eventually. It will kill you, Albus.”
“That doesn’t sound good,” Harry said, rolling his eyes as he took it.
“Draco,” Harry laughed, “we can’t just go to Diagon Alley, we’re both literally hiding from Voldemort, remember?”
After a few minutes of browsing the shelves and knocking into at least a dozen people in the process, a familiar voice called out to him again.
“Explain,” he ordered sharply, holding on tightly to a shaking Narcissa. Severus’ face twisted with guilt, which confused Harry even further.
“Do you have him under an Imperius? What did you do to him?” Weasley barked at Draco, and Draco tensed, shrinking back a little.
The sound of a door opening downstairs made Draco jerk up and jump off the bed immediately. The sound of someone running up stairs confirmed Draco’s assumption that the conversation had properly riled Harry up. Harry did not come up to their floor, however. Instead, Draco heard a door on the second floor being ripped open, and Draco quickly hurried down the stairs.
shouldn’t have been allowed to participate in. Draco still didn’t understand how Dumbledore could’ve let that happen, why nobody had intervened.
“Draco,” Harry hissed, “I don’t need so much! I wear my school robes for most of the year anyway.”
“Hey Luna! Got space for one more in here?”
It had never been this bad before. Even in spouting his hateful vitriol, the Dark Lord usually kept his composure to a degree that he appeared almost bored. There was none of that left now. Something about that mission must’ve been important enough to unhinge him completely.
Harry nodded, seemingly satisfied with Severus’ answers. Still, Severus hesitated. Surely Harry wouldn’t let that go so easily.
“Let’s begin with yours, then,” Severus said, slightly dreading to hear what Harry would say next.
Harry gnawed on his lower lip.
“I’m really sorry,” Draco mumbled, his face in his hands.
Draco’s resolve was beyond impressive in the face of Harry’s charm on full blast, so much so that Remus found himself reevaluating his opinion of the Slytherin. He’d perceived him as a rather spoiled, entitled child, with a perfect pure-blood mask and little inclination to show any concern for others or raw emotions. Seeing him now, worry etched deeply on his usually impassive face, he seemed like an entirely different person.
Also, if Ao3 fucks up the formatting I will cry. By the time you read this I may have cried. (I cried, look how much prettier they would be if Ao3 let me!)
“No,” Draco cut him off. “No, you were right. I
“Thank you,” he breathed when their lips finally parted.
“But— but how?”
and free, so firmly had his mind convinced him that he was gone forever, as if he was dead. Their relationship hadn’t been the same, not by far, but they had found each other again in other ways. He had never stopped loving Sirius, and he probably never would. He had simply learnt to move on despite that love. Grieving him again now felt oddly familiar, like he simply slipped back into that resigned acceptance that his first love was gone, and that he would just continue to love him, carrying all the good of their history around with him as a gentle reminder that love existed in the first place.
Slowly and without making a single sound, Draco descended the stairs down into the basement kitchen. There was light. A sense of triumph washed through him, as he rounded the corner to see Potter sitting at the table, his nose buried in a book, eating the remains of last night’s dinner. The book must’ve been riveting, for Potter didn’t even notice Draco’s arrival, though granted, he had his back to the door.
True enough, Harry kept glancing at the crowd as if trying to gauge their reaction. Well, if he allowed himself to be distracted …
“My word, it’s flawless! Wonderful, Harry, truly excellent! It’s no surprise, of course, your mother was extraordinarily talented at potions as well after all. You clearly inherited her gifts.”
“I just want to make sure you’re really alright, dear,” Molly went on. “This can’t have been easy for you, with everything that’s happened and then with the
“Oh, I am quite serious. It’s bad enough you had to see and deal with the aftermath, I won’t tolerate you listening to graphic descriptions of how these wounds were inflicted.”
Alright, phew. This chapter turned out wayyyy longer than it was supposed to be (whops).
“We didn’t,” Harry interrupted harshly, trying to contain his irritation. “And would you mind terribly to keep it down a little? There’s a reason he didn’t join us today.”
. Once more, Harry cursed himself for his poor choice of electives back in third year. Frantically, he memorised the pattern, tracing the runes over and over on his thigh. He’d need to draw them directly on Severus’ skin.
“Just stocking up on Pepper-Up potions,” answered Severus, not looking up from the Mandrake root he was cutting up with practiced precision. He slid the root off the cutting board and into the cauldron, then stirred until the potion darkened before lifting his head to look at Draco. “I still owe you an apology for my behaviour last week. I realise that I’ve neglected you just as much and I’m sorry. How are you holding up?”
“He’s doing much better, his progress is considerable.”
Remus smiled and nodded. “I shall be there. Did you have anything special planned for your first lesson?”
he most afraid of? There were a number of things that could go wrong, ranging from practically bound to happen to very unlikely, and from almost amusing to utterly devastating. Unfortunately, severity and likelihood did not align at all in this case. In fact, the mildest reaction—surprise followed by acceptance—was among the least likely.
“What about the Occlumency lesson?”
Oh, right, Weasley. All the Weasleys. And Granger. Dread came crashing back into Draco like a freight train. He hadn’t had a chance to apologise to Weasley yet, and the red-head did
Ron squirmed a little, but eventually gave Harry a defeated nod, saying, “Alright, alright. Message received, the ferret is here to stay. But I stand with it: I won’t hang out with Malfoy for you.”
Draco nodded and followed her, Harry trailing a step behind. They were almost at the entrance of the white building when Harry suddenly stopped dead. Draco looked at him questioningly.
Harry looked up at him then, blinking back tears. Draco put his free hand on Harry’s cheek and shook his head.
Narcissa’s eyes lit up with interest now. “Andromeda’s daughter?”
“My office, both of you,” Severus snapped. Both their expressions reflected utter outrage. “Now!”
Draco snorted. “Yeah right, like you’ve ever done a single chore in your life.”
“You know,” Draco remarked, “I’d be surprised about the existence of hidden rooms if this wasn’t a Black estate, and I’d be surprised that you found them in under a month if you weren’t Harry Potter.”
“Does he know that?”
Harry smiled and shook his head. “No, I do want to tell you. It’s not like I can keep it a secret forever, as soon as people realise how much I’ve changed everyone will hound me for an explanation. Now that those girls from before know I bet the news is already spreading.”
“How about Sirona?” Remus spoke up unexpectedly and promptly earned himself six surprised looks.
“You remember that Dumbledore wanted to check you for foreign magic?”
Every month he forgot how bad his urges got around the full moon, and every month it hit him again full force. He found himself envying Harry and Draco, as immature as that sounded because he doubted that those two were already fully going at it—or at least he hoped they weren’t, Merlin, would he have to give Harry
“Draco? Are you alright, sweetheart?” Harry eyed him with obvious concern, his excitement fading rapidly into a frown. “I’m sorry, maybe it was a stupid idea. You can tell me if you don’t like them and I’ll think of something else, I—”
Remus didn’t have to guess, it was right in front of him.
“You acquired notebooks? Careful, Potter, if you go on like that people might start to believe you actually know how to use your brain, you’re almost as bad a swot as Hermione,” he said sarcastically.
Grabbing Hermione’s welcoming speech, he began to pace agitatedly, trying to practice what he was going to say in his head. He’d never been one to give speeches.
Draco had to admit that it was rather endearing. Their conversation shifted to less serious things then, such as how Sirona felt about her new designated spot in Harry’s room. When they dispersed from the dining room a short while later, Draco was almost content again. Almost.
CONTENT WARNING: Graphic injuries
Did Harry go off on a tangent about historical figures from the four houses in the middle there? Yes, yes he did. Why? Because I got distracted while writing as Harry and if that isn’t ADHD in its purest form idk what is, so I left it in even though it’s
“Because my mind is somehow connected to Voldemort and without mental shields he would be able to influence me or even possess me as he did in June,” Harry answered automatically. Severus had repeated that over and over when he’d tested Harry’s progress.
Hermione pursed her lips and said, “I’m sure he has very good reasons for his secrecy.”
His heart was racing, belying the neutral tone of his words, as he waited for her reaction. The seconds seemed to stretch forever. Finally, a small smile appeared on her lips and she nodded.
“It’s a family heirloom, darling,” he said with a smirk. “That’s why this isn’t your actual present, but I wanted you to have it either way. You see, that bracelet has a counterpart.”
Still amazed by the luxury of the bathroom, Harry decided that he might as well make use of it and take a shower before dealing with whatever was going on. There must be a reason why Dumbledore brought him to Grimmauld Place—term hadn’t even ended yet, and if it had, he usually would’ve insisted Harry return to the Dursley’s as always. Maybe freshening up would help with his headache, too, which was still strong enough to make his vision go blurry.
“Fuck,” he muttered, abruptly letting go of Draco’s robes and stepping away.
If I’m posting this chapter, it means I evidently got over this writer's block I'm having
The office disappeared around him and he felt himself surrounded by a stranger’s presence. No, not a stranger. Albus Dumbledore. He let his magic prod outwards experimentally and immediately found resistance.
be here and leaves? What if Draco realises that he doesn’t want to deal with nine Weasleys for the rest of— What if he decides it’s not worth the trouble? What if Severus—”
how serious they were about their words. He was breathing steadily now, trying to wrap his head around it.
She held the books out to Harry, who took them eagerly out of her arms, and immediately flipped open
Harry laughed at that, earning himself a startled look from Ron.
“I did wonder when he turned into a spy, it can’t have been from the start.”
“He’s not lying. Narcissa and Draco have been living here for over a month.”
He stopped short just as he was about to pour her a glass of wine—it was too early for firewhisky—and looked up at her.
Albus’ smile fell, but Severus continued before he could interrupt.
“I’m afraid not, my dear aunt, Lucius is otherwise occupied. But I thought, maybe you would keep me company? You see, I am merely a guest here, for now, and I would appreciate it ever so much if you could watch over me in my room. Wouldn’t you be more comfortable, too, with me, rather than in this noisy hallway?”
The entire class scurried to resume their work, nobody daring to even look in Severus’ direction as he strode through the classroom again.
“That’s not what I mean!” she shrieked. “Why would you
“Bye, sweetheart, see you soon,” said Harry, smiling at Draco one last time before disappearing under his cloak.
Harry looked thoughtful, then a slow grin spread on his face as he replied, “Alright, sure. Same rules as always, the match ends if either one is disarmed or stunned.”
“Do you regret it?” he asked, keeping his voice as even as possible and his face neutral.
He crossed the grounds quickly, encountering not a single soul as he made his way to the gates of the school. The silence was blissful after a full term of noise. He exited the perimeter of the wards and apparated right to the doorstep of Grimmauld Place.
“Well, we’ve figured out who my real father is.” Harry paused, and he suddenly looked nervous, eyes darting over to Severus.
, after seeing how close he was to Narcissa. The woman really was rather predictable.
The question threw Severus somewhat. Why
“Yes,” Narcissa teased, “it was rather obvious, wasn’t it?”
“Definitely, tryouts should be sometime in the second week I think.”
“That is very kind of you to say,” said Luna, beaming at him briefly, then turned back to her magazine.
“I would have noticed that,” Severus insisted.
“No marks, remember?” he reminded Harry, and Harry growled in frustration.
,” he spat, standing up straighter in the doorway.
He couldn’t help himself, a little chuckle escaped his throat, quickly growing into full-out laughter. Potter joined in, and within seconds they were a giggling mess. Two peas in a pod, really. When they finally calmed down, Potter was still standing awfully close, his hands still on Draco’s hips and Draco’s still on his chest. He had to fight the urge to simply jump into the next round of snogging, reminding himself that they couldn’t just stay down here forever, and, despite the heat between them, his bare feet were getting cold on the tiled floor.
