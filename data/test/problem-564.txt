He smirked as he pulled his snowballs from around Blaise and sent them into the snowball battle, hitting multiple students and damaging defences, effectively starting the fight once more... Except now, there was a third side of the fight; the small group of eighth years.
"Thank you," Draco whispered back. "But I think it needs a little something more, and I wasn't sure what."
him tell her to paint the walls of the Hospital wing black for the next time he arrived? That much brightness is an assault on his eyes. Something slithers across his arm. Draco screams.
After what couldn't have been more than ten minutes but felt closer to an hour, Draco spotted the biggest wolf- the leader- headed for himself and Potter. He turned to take on the wolf, readying his repertoire of spells, when Potter dove at him; he pushed Draco down as another werewolf soared over Draco's head, only barely missing where he'd been stood moments ago, teeth bared such that they would've closed around his neck if not for Potter's intervention. The werewolf, unable to stop, kept flying- straight into the leader. Its jaws closed around the larger wolf's lower neck; the werewolf howled in agony and immediately began a retreat into the forest. The pack followed, dragging injured wolves by the scruffs of their necks, until the grass fields were empty, and the trees hid the dangers lurking within.
, for Draco, and it's just not Potter. And Potter, who is currently choosing the worst moments to be deceptive and observant, lets a cool mask slide onto his face- when did he learn to do that?- and says, "
- they were scared of the Mark. He spotted movement to his left, and looked up to see Blaise and Pansy flailing their arms; when they locked eyes with him, they both start wildly gesturing at their forearms, and Draco nearly laughed. They looked absurd. Then he realised he'd surrounded himself in a group of Potter-worshippers, with his mark exposed, could see Potter staring at him, and realised that not only does he not know what to say to Potter, he also didn't know why he was doing this.
The second, however, which had received the potion without the unicorn blood... Well, it was still limp. Draco frowned; he'd given it plentiful time to reawaken. He decided to run a few tests to check it was still- you know, alive. Tarantallegra didn't work. Neither did Rennervate. Eventually he cast the diagnostics spell.
He reminded Draco of Slughorn; the same wispy hair lingered on the side of his head, the same pudginess surrounded his figure.
"I'm sorry I stalked you for all that time; I'm so, so sorry for these," he brushed his hand lightly down the front of Draco's shirt, where his faint scars from the Sectumsempra curse lay hidden; Draco startled, and Harry smiled sadly. "Yeah, I've seen. I am literally joined to you, Draco." His sad smile turned into a sad, hesitant expression. "I'm sorry for this, too," he said quietly, brushing the tips of his fingers over the top of where the Mark lay, dormant, on Draco's forearm.
Draco took a shard of the Mirror and ran towards the Room of Requirement. He'd taken a large shard, one that held the image of his and Harry's hands intertwined. It'd just been the most convenient to grab, that was all. It wasn't like Draco chose that piece specifically or anything. No, that would be ridiculous.
Then it hit Harry that Draco was gone, running away from him, and was probably going to keep running until he was far away unless Harry stopped him. So Harry ran.
Draco froze, all thoughts of tea and biscuits vanished from his mind. He jumped up, pulling Harry up with him, and sprinted off towards the castle. "We can make the Elixir," Draco muttered to him as he began to protest. Immediately, Harry shut up and suddenly it was Harry pulling Draco towards the castle.
Potter's eyes went dark. Uh oh. They hadn't done that in a while. And last time Draco had seen that look directed at him- oh. Sixth year. Girl's bathroom.
Draco paced in front of the wall, brow furrowed, concentrating on the room he'd settled upon last night. When he looked up, there it was; the large oak door that opened silently, revealing his dream room.
"-ansy, look, he just got eggs again, that means he's getting ready to exercise, d'you think I could go for a run too? Maybe trip him up? Oh, now he's stealing from-" cue the sneer and unanimous groan from the Slytherins- "the Weaslette. She's
Draco remembered the one time he'd tried on one of Pansy's dresses in Fourth year, before the Yule Ball. "No, Potter, don't be ridiculous. Why don't they let you up?"
"Um, apologies, I suppose. I have already apologised to everyone else properly, but- there's just so much with you that I never wanted to approach the subject.
First of all, he was fully fed up of professing his love for Potter every time he wanted to enter the Slytherin Dungeons; second of all, he was fed up of sleeping in such an uncomfortable bed, with Potter; thirdly, he was absolutely fed up of Potter himself.
Snape, watching on from the side, said, "Yes, Draco, they all are. Every single one. Absolutely insufferable, the lot of them."
? And Draco tried to ask him, but all that came out was a frightened little noise that seemed to confuse Potter because he always has been and always will be a thick-headed
Pansy eventually took pity on the group. "Alright, darling, shut up now. Yes, this game is called "We Will Actually Die of Alcohol Poisoning Before Draco Admits his Crush on Potter", or "W.W.A.D.o.A.P.B.D.A.h.C.o.P" to keep it a secret when talked about with others present. The only rules of the game are that every time Draco mentions our beloved Lord and Saviour, every person playing the game who is within earshot of the conversation has to take a shot. The game will last until midnight. Any questions?"
"So, Granger," he said, pulling her from her rant. "What do you- and you, Potter- know about Nicholas Flamel's healing stone?"
Draco cocked his head to the side and smirked. "Hm, no, I don't think I will. Oh, Potter, by the way- she?"
The group watched, over the next few months, as their Harry returned. Slowly, oh so slowly; but they hadn't expected anything else. The boy had
"I am ready to die," he said again, pulling the snitch closer to his lips, so that Hermione and Ron finally took notice of it.
This, of course, did absolutely nothing to help Ron. It'd been three and a half hours of no Harry at this point, and Hermione was starting to worry, too.
Draco made a noise of protest, found a new bit of grass to make an angel on, and made three. "Granger, come look at this! I made three!" he called out to her. She walked over and gave him a nod of approval; he beamed triumphantly. "Oi, Weasley," he shouted, "Bet my angels are better than yours!"
As he spoke, he watched as her eyes became slowly more and more fixated on his hair; when he finished, she let her eyes flicker back down to his face before moving back- almost imperceptibly- and asking Potter, "Is that
"May I?" Potter said- whispered. This seemed too delicate to talk about normally. It had to be treated gently. Potter gestured to Draco's shirt. He wanted to see all the scars.
Harry pulled off the invisibility cloak, and Draco had to consciously suppress the urge to start grinning like a lovesick idiot.
Spintwitches' Sporting Needs was next, where Ronald bought his present for Harry (a Quidditch ball set of his own, missing a snitch for some reason. When Draco asked, Ron gave a sort of half-smile and told Draco that Harry had a snitch of his own he could use). Pansy then walked up beside Draco and said that perhaps Draco could get Harry a snitch of his own as a present; Ronald rejected the idea and helped Draco make a custom snow globe that Harry would like. Then the two took their sweet time going over nearly every Quidditch-related item in stock, comparing items and advising each other on what to and what not to get. Pansy rushed off to J. Pippin's Potions (presumably to get Draco's present), but was back before the boys left (unfortunately). It didn't take her long before her impatience won out and she was dragging the boys away from the store to move onto their next destination- Zonko's.
that her name was Harry- short for Harrietta- too. The only gift Draco had actually considered was, in fact, the Potter Stinks badge; and only because that had been the year Harry dropped out of school to- y'know- save the world.
"Oh, yeah. Nicholas Flamel's stone is called the Philosopher's stone. Anyway, Voldemort wanted it to produce the Elixir of Life, which makes the drinker basically immortal. He wanted it to mainly become human-ish again, with a body and all that. It's alchemy; only Nicholas Flamel is known to have created it successfully, although Beedle the Bard's Resurrection Stone was thought to be based off of it, and that works as it does in the story."
Two ginger-haired menaces flew at him, both talking over each other, shouting questions and accusations at Draco. Behind them, Granger watched on in amusement. Pansy and Blaise, who had been sat next to her (since when did that happen?) stood and joined her, smirking. This wouldn't be good.
One goes to unhealthy lengths to be noticed- staying up all night to make badges; conducting over a hundred students in a chorus; climbing trees and making a fuss over their injuries and pretending to be a soul-sucking creature just to get a rise from the other.
Draco had always adored trying on clothes; he loved strutting up and down the small aisle, doing a little twirl in his fancy suits and his stylish jackets. He liked tipping his hats, when he wore them, as he bowed; when the Golden trio joined them (having skipped trying on clothes and moving straight to buying them), Draco loved the rounds of applause he received. He loved talking with Blaise before emerging, comparing outfits and giving compliments and adjustments.
Draco stepped further in, lighting his- Harry's- wand. The corridor was empty. Draco had the sudden realisation that there was only one place Harry could have gone to. Oh,
By the time he and Potter's body had reached the small abode, the sun had risen considerably, its rays now warming the frozen ground, chasing away the coldness of the night.
"-and, in general, he's just angry that he wasn't involved. Oh, when I told him we'd succeeded, you should've
The view was simply spectacular, Draco noted absently; he could see Hogwarts in the distance, as well as the glint of the winter sun on the surface of the Black Lake. The Forbidden Forest was a dark spot beside it, and Hogsmeade sprawled out in a map beneath him.
"See, that sounds good, except I don't want to tell more people about my potion. And, besides, who do you think would actually come and join us if we told them we were looking for the Resurrection Stone? Or even just any old stone? They'd think we'd gone mad."
"Potter," he cautioned- Harry turned around for just a moment, and Draco wondered if he were imagining the hurt in his eyes- "Maybe you shouldn't-"
They opened with a creak; Draco shivered as he entered the room. The walls and floor were a rough grey stone, absorbing his heat and radiating coldness. The room was relatively plain; a single window was set into the back wall, letting a small square of weak winter sunlight into the dim room; other than that, the only noticeable decoration was- a mirror?
The Slytherins- as many as were willing to- were crowded in the common room, stood around a few crates' worth of fire whiskeys (butterbeers for the young 'uns). Hushed whispers and murmured conversations filled the room.
Harry Potter didn't care for Draco Malfoy. Not one bit. Sure, he'd spent so long watching Malfoy and trying to understand what he was thinking and feeling that he was able to read Malfoy better than most people could ever hope to, and
When Parkinson and Zabini identified where he was headed, they both immediately began backing up, shouting, "Weasley, what are you
"I thought so!" Draco raised an eyebrow. "...Sorry. Just recognised it, but wasn't sure I was right."
"I followed you down here," Harry said, "After I saw this. You went down, and then loads more writing just appeared on the page. So I came down too."
the last time Draco had eaten? Not today, certainly, and he'd skipped dinner and lunch at the Great Hall; had he even gotten something from the House area of the Room? His brow furrowed as he thought, and when his stomach groaned, Potter stood.
Meanwhile, Draco and Harry left the room, talking excitedly about what they ("Me, mostly," Draco reminded Harry) had done. Draco was positively bursting with excitement. He was the best potioneer alive! Merlin, Mother would be so proud! Snape, too- Draco froze midstep. Harry stopped with him, looking confused and worried and ever-so-slightly-scared, but Draco's mind was entirely occupied by another matter entirely.
People were just shouting in general, creating chaos and a cacophony of wild noise. When it didn't stop after a full three minutes, Draco decided he'd had enough. He turned around, marched out of the hall, dragging Harry along behind him, and headed off to the kitchens, where he ate a peaceful breakfast. No, he
Huh. Not the worst manners in the world. And he hadn't rejected Draco's offer immediately. Perhaps he could learn to live with Potter- Harry.
How else could he leave the Gryffindor tower without going through the Fat Lady's portrait? Really, Hogwarts should install fire escapes. This was
Now, this, Draco could relate to so much it wasn't even really funny. He still had a legacy to protect, even as an ex-death eater, even as an outcast of society, he still had to protect his father's legacy as the sole heir of the Malfoy family- and probably the last, too, seeing the way his social standing was. And his sexuality- but that was for another time.
Draco gave him a look of betrayal, and said, "Fine! You'll see." He made his way down to the courtyard, grumbling the whole way down about
Draco's cheeks were pinker than the blush when he stepped into the dressing room. When Pansy joined him to help him take off the make-up, she gave him the Look. "Don't," he told her softly. "I already know."
When Draco walked into the hall, before he even noticed the table arrangements, he nudged Potter and pointed at a banner. "Look, P- Harry, it's my name. The Hogwarts motto is based on me, did you know," he said.
Why was the mirror showing him this? It was oddly similar to what he'd seen in that mirror-room, in the Golden place. Draco remembered his revelation from then. The mirror didn't show Harry. Well, it did, but it didn't show
Pansy and Blaise stepped forward. Silence fell over the group. "We have gathered you here tonight to play a- a game, of sorts," Blaise began. "It's a drinking game, as we announced when we asked you all to gather, so we'd just like all of your consent so no one can accuse us of forcing you to do underage drinking or alcohol poisoning or anything like that."
He kept running after he was out of the Room- he knew he had a few seconds that Potter would spend standing still, blinking, and he used them well. He sprinted down the corridor, and, remembering Potter's Map, decided that he would leave Hogwarts grounds at once. But where to go? Where would Potter not think to find him? He couldn't go home, couldn't go to anywhere in Hogwarts- where could he go?
But hadn't there been something first year? A... a stone? Someone Flannel- no, Flamel... Rick? Nick?
((I'm still pissed.) I know, I'm sorry. (You had no right to be that sweet about me.) It's all true, though. (Yeah, I'm not denying that. Anyway. What's the last one?) Umm... You now. (I'm still mad from before, but- you write this one. You can probably describe me better than I can. I'm not moving from here, though. I'll watch and listen to you the whole time.))
happy.) and swung his body down over the broom fully, tilting upwards back towards the sky, but still falling, still sinking-
"Oh, no. Harry, what do mean, the Resurrection Stone? I thought you threw that away in the Forbidden Forest?"
And he hates how quiet, subdued his voice is, but Potter is smirking and saying, "I knew it'd get you to do it- and it worked, didn't it?"
The old man nodded. "Yes. Well, when the Potter boy- that's you, I suppose- found my Stone in your first year at Hogwarts, I had to give up my Elixir so it wouldn't get into the wrong sort of hands, especially with that Tom Riddle back again. I wasn't quite ready to go yet, however; so I stored all of my memories in this one vial, which I gave to Albus for safekeeping. He comes, sometimes, to see how I am, although he hasn't come in a while...
? A little voice in his mind asks, but Draco pushes that aside and says, "That was rather Slytherin of you, Potter."
"My pensieve and memories are over there," Dumbledore said, gesturing to a wardrobe-type thing. Draco stepped closer, and the doors opened. A pensieve floated out. Behind it stood racks and racks of vials, all filled with shimmering memories. "Do you know how to use a pensieve?" Dumbledore asked.
The two didn't speak to each other the rest of the night as they got themselves ready for and into bed.
He pushed his weight towards the nose of the broom, saw something flash out of the air a few metres above him- a hand, coming out of thin air? Reaching towards him?- felt the very tail bristles of his broom sweep the ground- and he was off!
Harry reached out and wrapped his arms around Draco suddenly, buried his head in Draco's shoulder, still bare, his gasping breaths and his dark skin as hot as the fire that still burned in the fireplace. Draco didn't even hesitate before wrapping his arms around Harry in return, burying his head in the mess of black hair- just as soft as Draco had expected it to be. He didn't hesitate in his decision to keep holding Harry, long after both of them had stopped crying. He didn't flinch when Harry's arms randomly tightened around him.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Get the high ground, obviously. Have you never done strategizing, ever? You fought a
"Well, I didn't want to be defenceless while digging through leaves. And, I suppose, it wouldn't look very good if I came out of the Forest with Potter dead.
As soon as the word "mother" left Potter's mouth, Narcissa strolled in through the doors, looking for all the world like the regal lady of the Malfoy family- but Draco (having grown up with her) saw how her pace was slightly accelerated, and how her lips were pursed, and her brow furrowed, rather than her face being the usual smooth mask the Malfoys had learned and cultivated. There was even a crease in her dress. When she saw that Draco was alright- and that he had visitors- she paused for only a moment (in relief) before continuing towards them in her usual manner, the way she presented herself to the public.
The day had flown by; before he knew it, the sun was nearing the horizon, and only one present remained in front of Draco. It was from Harry.
The next morning, the Golden trio walked into the Great Hall happy as usual. Ron and Harry were discussing Quidditch tactics while Hermione read her newest book- something about a cupboard and a secret world and some sort of talking lion.
"Oh, yeah! Well, the draught isn't finished yet, I'm going to leave it to brew for an extra-long time, just in case, but we got the-" he lowered his voice- "Elixir."
His back wasn't quite as bad as his front, but he still heard Potter make a soft noise of wounded astonishment as he turned. There were an additional thirteen scars there (to make a total of fifty), mostly on his left side, where the curse had hit hardest. Draco had found it easiest to deal with the incident by facing it analytically; he counted his scars, estimated their depth and how much blood he lost, estimated how long it would've taken to heal without magic (he would've died of blood loss first), etcetera. He felt that by detaching himself emotionally from the incident, he distanced himself mentally from it, too.
They'd exited the castle by the time any of them realised that they had no idea where they were going.
do. He threw himself down and made more, and more, and more, as Weasley did the same; eventually, lost in their competition, Draco lost track of his surroundings and bumped into Pansy, who was sat next to Harry, both of them making small... What were
"Bragging rights. Until the next time we play this game. Proof you have a high alcohol tolerance. This'll probably be the biggest drinking event of a single house in Hogwarts history, so you'll get your name down in the Student Stories history book, too. Bragging rights forever as the first victor of W.W.A.D.o.A.P.B.D.A.h.C.o.P. Any other questions? No, Draco, you don't get to say anything. Right then, that's it. This is your last chance to back out. Everyone staying?"
"Oh, has no one given you your room? Up the astronomy tower, the door at the back of the room. You'll find all of your belongings up there. You'll be staying for the next five months, and the classes we have now won't be doing stargazing until far later in the year. Wards are up, and you'll find all the commodities you might need up there already. Go on, then. I expect to see you both,
Ron himself was having an internal battle, which continued even as Parkinson led the group back out, and as the group returned to Hogwarts. He hated Malfoy. They ferrety git had insulted him and his family for all of his life. He'd been prejudiced and rude towards Hermione- well, he
, he thought, as he moved to let Potter lie down on the grass. He cast a new round of shielding spells and resigned himself to keeping watch for the night until the sun rose and he and Potter could swap the Resurrection Stone for the Philosopher's stone recipe. But until then, Potter needed rest.
"No, Potter, I am actually quite capable of keeping things alive; I, myself, am a prime example. I am incredibly difficult to keep alive, you know, and yet here I stand, perfectly healthy. These plants are all perfectly healthy, and they should be ready to add to the potion that'll make the Stone soon."
"Aw, c'mon. Hey, Harry, what about a trade? You tell me who gave you the potions and I'll give you my... Hm... Whatever you want!"
In response, Malfoy stepped back from the table of plants; immediately, half of them began crying, a quarter started full-on screaming and lashing out with their leaves, and only the remaining quarter remained docile-
Draco shifted uncomfortably. "No, I- I didn't know if you were done with it, and I didn't want to give it over without your permission. After all, you have the dead family members, not me."
Flamel was still sat before the fireplace. When Draco walked in, he stood, picking up the photo and recipe. "Ready to exchange, now, boy?"
Draco took a moment to make sure she'd eaten- she looked far better than she had the last time he'd seen her, that was for sure- before asking, "Could you watch over this and alert me when it melts?"
As though to prove Draco's point, Weasley said, "As if, Malfoy! I'm not about to let you go off alone with my best friend-"
What Draco does, however, is raise an eyebrow, smirk, and say, "Like you have the guts to survive in Slytherin."
"Well, it's been lovely eating with you boys, but I have a girls' day off to plan with Millicent," Pansy said. "Ciao." And she was gone, arm linked through Millicent Bulstrode's, already talking in excited voices about fashion and trends and winter clothes.
As she was saying this, Snape (who had groaned as Malfoy had muttered that everything was Harry's fault) looked at Madame Pomfrey, Harry, and then stared at Draco as he took up his very own- was that a
"I don't know! At some point a rule was made that boys can't go into the girl's dormitories, and the stairs transform into a slide whenever you try to go up." He paused. "Say, Malfoy, are you actually a girl?"
Their reactions were immediate. Both boys reached for their wands, but while Harry slid quietly off the bed and readied his offensive stance, Draco started casting shield charms and silencing charms around his room. There was already a permanent silencing charm around it, but- well, what if it wore off at some point? Draco hadn't checked the spells of his room when he'd Apparated Harry here. He'd been a little
Draco was pretty much seething. The old man must've known Potter was there all along! He glanced at Severus, to see if he was just as angry as Draco, but he was- he was
"If you think you're going off looking for Potter while Draco is missing and probably with him alone, you are sorely mistaken," Parkinson said.
Just then, a wail echoed from the corridor and the doors to the Great Hall slammed open; in strode Potter, attracting the attention of every eye in the Hall. He paused for a moment, oblivious to the attention on him, and scanned the hall. When he spotted Draco, he immediately headed towards him. He looked distraught.
"Well, you're a fountain of knowledge. I'm- working on a project for McGonagall. For the students who were part of the war." Granger looked incredibly suspicious and nervous and incredibly distrustful and ever so slightly curious, so Draco decided he'd have to tell her everything. "Alright. Well, you know the Dreamless Sleep potion? It's a variant of that. I- the survivors of the war all get terrible nightmares really often, right? I do, and I know Potter does, and you probably do too. But Dreamless Sleep is addictive, and too much of it can build up a tolerance, and then you have to resort to more severe drug-type potions.
They returned to their seats with their hot chocolates as Draco waited (quite chivalrously, if he did say so himself) for Harry to finish. As he waited, he made a few other tiny snowmen, like the ones Pansy had made before. He arranged those by the base of the snowman as he waited. When Potter was finally ready, they both stood back and levitated their snowmen heads up onto the bodies. Draco made sure his was balanced meticulously, then realised he was missing something. The
Draco thought. Potter knew this, though. He bowed his head, looking ashamed and sorrowful and remorseful. "I'm sorry," he said again. Then, after a moment, he said, "I'm so sorry. For everything." Oh. So this was happening
A few weeks had passed since the Drinking Incident (as it had been dubbed, and would be remembered from then onwards in Hogwarts History.) The Slytherins had been rather quiet- as quiet as Slytherins get, anyways.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Well, firstly, he is a potioneer, and wanted to-" he put on his best Snape imitation, slow drawl and all- "Watch us fail in such a high-risk project; secondly,
"I do know that to get the Elixir of Life, you have to liquify the stone in its entirety, and add your heart's deepest desire. Then you extract it- it's a sort of shimmery gold, Nicholas told me once. He said you had to say,
Draco froze. "The- where Vince- and the cabinet- I mean, where you held DADA meetings the year we had Umbridge?"
By this point, students inside the school had started coming out to have a look at the snowman-building competition; the younger muggleborns were delighting in the snow, making their own snowmen and snow-angels. The older ones appeared to have started a mass snowfight, with small teams of all houses and years popping up and making truces until two large ones remained; the more experienced wizards and witches had constructed a small snow fort on one side of the appointed battlefield, while the other appeared to have begun a snowball factory, passing snowballs along to the best throwers, who took aim and shot at any head that peaked above the enemy's fortress. Ron and Blaise were betting on who would win, laughing and cheering and commenting to each other about spectacular techniques and shots and hits.
Harry's gaze followed him, and when he spotted Hermione's mane of hair and Weasley stuck in a tree, he did a double-take. He jogged to catch up with Draco and asked, "You're all out here
Each wall held one in its surface; they all faced the center of the room, where Draco and real-Harry were stood.
come out. But I know you're there. Do either of you two know anything about the Flamel Stone?" Potter's head appeared, followed by the rest of his body. He looked slightly sheepish as Hermione turned to him, shocked.
"Let's start with more traditional meditation methods to try and get you to understand what sort of thing we're hoping to achieve with Occlumency. This will also help you with identifying and ignoring emotions you don't want to remain calm, which can be incredibly useful in many situations in the Wizarding world." Draco tried to recall how Severus had done this for him; he made his voice low and quiet, as soothing as he could make it. Soft, almost, except Malfoy's don't do soft.
She rolled her eyes. "Obviously. I'm a pureblood; we all go to each others' houses when we're young. I've been there, and Malfoy Manor, and Blaise's home, too."
But, apparently, this was not enough. Because a moment later, another snowball flew into Draco's back, this one launched with so much force he was knocked off of his makeshift seat and onto the ground.
Potter seemed to be casting every spell that came to mind. Draco, personally, was working his way back from what he'd learned most recently to what he'd learned first; he was going through Second Year when he remembered another time he and Potter had dueled together; only then, they'd been against each other. Draco had cast a spell, and Potter had- oh.
The evening passed in a flurry of quiet conversations and light hearted jokes; at one point, Ronald produced some of Weasley's Wizard Wheezes newest product, the Hysteria-Inducing Holly (especially for the festive season!) which sent most of the room into fits of laughter. Then came some rather peculiar sweets that turned the consumer into an animal; an old classic from when Honeydukes and Zonko's had collaborated to make the "best product for students" a few years back. They were in high demand amongst the eighth years, and the Gryffindors ended up summoning stashes of sweets they had hidden in their rooms in order to satisfy everyone.
Potter, who had previously been resting on the side of the bed, apparently asleep and with his face tucked away under his arms- what had
Flitwick was off (Merlin knew why) and the group had been given one of the newer teachers, employed after the war. The problem with these newer teachers was that most of them came solely for the opportunity to teach Potter.
A little unnerved, Draco moved closer to the first mirror-Harry he'd seen. He shuffled over, right next to the mirror, and rested his fingertips on the glass. Who was this strange Harry, separated from him by a layer of glass, who smiled at him like nothing else mattered, like he thought Draco was-
He'd spent a good while looking around, noting the architecture and colour scheme, until he came to what was clearly the Potter's old house.
As he neared the small building, he noticed that there was a strong magic around the place; it flowed through the air, laced the wind and was imbued in the ground; it kept the forest wild, kept the fields golden, kept the sky clear. There were layers of it; veils, almost. Draco supposed those were wards. In a memory, he could feel them, but they wouldn't affect him. Hopefully.
Harry, and those closest to him, probably came off the worst. Death Eaters knew them, targeted them. After all, one of the best ways to hurt Harry Potter is by hurting those he cares for. So they emerged with a large abundance of scars that would never fully heal, bones that wouldn't ever be as strong as they once were, and minds that were forever scarred. This just made it worse for Harry, because he blamed himself. After all, if those precious people weren't so precious to him, perhaps Ron wouldn't have broken both legs. Perhaps Neville wouldn't have been paralysed from the waist down. Perhaps Luna would be able to hold a wand in her right hand again. Perhaps the twins wouldn't have parted ways in the worst scenario possible.
He couldn't show it- he had to be confident, or else nobody would be. They were all following his lead. But he was petrified of losing his friends, his family. When he had seen the Great Hall, teeming with the dead and their loved ones, all he'd wanted to do was sit down and cry. But he couldn't. Merlin, all he wanted was a hug, a promise that everything would be alright. But no one could promise him that. He had to prove it himself.
idea. Not right now, though. I was thinking we should put the camera here-" he walked over to the portrait and pointed to the spot on the wall, at eye-level, next to it- "where Draco can clearly see it whenever he decides to come back. And we leave it recording, we all go sleep, comfortable in our dormitories, and tomorrow morning we come back and check the footage. Sound good?" The group nodded. "Cool. G'night, guys. Pansy, I entrust you the task of the sticking charm. Don't press this button here, or it'll stop recording. Right, night night! Sleep tight!"
Harry frowned, and was about to shout something scathing back at Malfoy when two odd things happened all at once. The Great Hall door burst open, and Madame Pomfrey charged in, hands on her hips and saying, "Never in my
He twisted his body- still holding the broom, eyes still shut tight- so he was facing the ground, falling like a skydiver. He spread out his legs and arms as he passed through a layer of slowing charms, and somehow-
Harry pulled Draco on behind him; Draco's arms wrapped instinctively around Harry's waist as Harry yelled, "Hold on!" and the broom shot towards the wind- upwards, Draco supposed.
), the other two sides of the fight came to a truce. Seventh years worked together to merge their defences and suddenly it was six (very advanced) eighth years against the rest of Hogwarts.
Draco stared incredulously at Harry, apparently having been shocked into silence at Harry's response. "
"I was with Hermione and Ron, but I ended up losing both of them to some of the challenges down there. So I went into the final chamber, which had two things. The Mirror of Erised, and Professor Quirrell."
"Well," Ron said hesitantly, "Isn't Grimmauld Place hidden by a Fidelius? There's a Floo in the main room, too."
"Oh, yeah- I used it last night, actually. I only had one nightmare, and I actually managed to sleep afterwards. Thanks."
? Harry, have I never told you what your name means?" Granger- Hermione, she'd told Draco to call her- asked.
He returned to the snow outside with a pounding headache (honestly, portraits should have volume limits) and a damper on his earlier cheer. He spotted his group all sat watching the teachers (who were, apparently, now working together to build a snowman taller than Draco's (they were failing, obviously, because Draco was
Flamel, seeming slightly thrown-off, turned to Potter. "Well, I'm not quite sure, actually. Time passes differently here than it does in the real world. It feels like it's been years, though. Say, when you leave, could you ask him to come through sometime?"
He stepped forward. The cat looked up at him lazily. "Professor?" he asked. The cat flicked its tail and curled back up. "Bit rude," Draco muttered.
"Please, call me Draco. Mr. Malfoy is my father's name," Draco said, returning subconsciously to the manners he's had drilled into him at McGonagall's formalities.
he felt a little warmth towards him when he did something like waiting for Harry to be ready before trading away the Resurrection Stone, and yes, he was interested in the Dreamless Sleep potion Malfoy was making, but that was only because Harry suffered from nightmares and wanted them to go away as soon as possible, nothing more.
The reason he was so good at defensive magic was because he'd had to learn some from his mother when his home had been plagued by Death Eaters and by Voldemort himself, when his father hadn't been able to help him. One of the Death Eaters he'd lived with had been Fenrir Greyback, the werewolf infamous for attacking children. Narcissa had made absolutely sure that Draco knew how to defend himself from werewolves.
When they arrived at the castle, they found a throbbing mass of people in the courtyard. They made their way around the edge of the throng and, eventually, up to the balconies, where they looked down upon the commotion.
"The Burrow, obviously; Luna's house, Andromeda's house; wow, Harry doesn't really have many place to go to. Um, Godric's Hollow?"
The war was over, long over, but he still awoke like this nearly every day. He'd gotten into the habit of placing silencing charms around his bed before he went to sleep every night, and of drawing the curtains closed around his bed to hide his nightly struggles from his dorm-mates, all of whom had come back to Hogwarts for their eighth year.
; and he would continue on with his life, quite happily. Unfortunately, things never could go the way Draco planned.
Probably the biggest thing Draco did for Harry (and the worst, in Harry's opinion) was go behind his back and open up Grimmauld Place to Harry's friends and family. He owled the Weasleys, and less than 15 minutes later, they all arrived, covered in soot, in the very sparse living room, bringing with them the friendly Weasley chatter and excitement, and awakening Harry, who had been planning to sleep until midday. Harry had bounded down the stairs, believing there to be an intruder, and was suddenly face-to-face with the people he'd been avoiding for so long. He turned around, apparated to his room, and locked the door. He didn't come back out till the next day, during which he found that the Weasleys (and Draco and Hermione) had cleaned the entirety of Grimmauld place (except Harry's room and Sirius'), had managed the heroic feat of removing the screeching portrait of Walburga Black, and even changed a couple of the Slytherin-green drapes into royal purples. The group, having stayed the night in various guest rooms, emerged the next day to find Harry, sobbing on the kitchen floor, in front of the fridge, which had been covered in hundreds of pictures of Lily, James, Sirius, Remus, Hedwig, Fred, and so many more. They retreated quietly, with small smiles on their faces. They'd been so loud coming downstairs, believing Harry to be sound asleep in his room, they knew Harry must've heard them. But he didn't run. He was improving. (Barely, but still. Improving.)
Draco looked scandalised. "Of course not! Just look at him. He's eating french toast, and he's got extra maple syrup on top- must've been a bad nightmare- with only a couple of strawberries. And he's got a cup of coffee, too, to wake him up. If he's got syrup on his toast, it must be three sugars in the coffee, and probably a full shot of espresso."
Potter looked at the portrait in disgust. He waved his wand and the blanket that had been covering it before flew up to conceal it once more.
While the houses bonded, Draco was working on the potion. It was tough, having a useless body attached to your dominant hand, but Draco managed. Potter was even occasionally helpful; having
Flamel raised his chin, looking skeptical. "There were invisibility cloaks around when I was alive," he proclaimed. "Why should I believe that that is the cloak of the tale? And what does this have to do with bringing my El back?"
Draco turned around to thank Potter for saving him when a heavy weight slumped against his back- he looked over his shoulder, alarmed, to find Potter- had he passed out?- resting against him. Draco sighed.
Harry smiled sadly. "I faced Death like an old friend," Harry told the snitch quietly. "I didn't want to die."
When Draco reached the front door, he hesitated before knocking. He turned, pursing his lips slightly; he hated asking for help, or admitting he didn't know something. That implied he had weaknesses, and Malfoys don't have weaknesses. "Potter, as we are in a memory, are we astral?"
Harry helped Draco bottle up the potion into the doses they thought would work best based on how they had reacted to smaller doses; approximately three drops for an hour of sleep seemed to be the rough measurement.
"We can't use McGonagall's, or any others in the school," Hermione said. "Unless we bring our own floo powder, that is. Then we could use one of the house common room Floos."
Draco sat in the Slytherin common rooms, the turquoise light from the lake painting pictures on his pale skin, shifting like the portraits that lined the Hogwarts halls.
And Draco remembers that the- the thing that caused his little "fainting episode", remembers that it is tucked somewhere in that mess of Potter's hair, and scrambles across the bed away from him as Blaise laughs even harder. He manages to choke out, "You fainted because of
Faster than he thought was possible, Harry swung his broom around, leaning flat against the wood, and flew downwards in a nosedive- a Wronski Feint with no clear ending, he supposed. The wind was now pushing him downwards, making him go faster and faster and there!
"Right, so, have you ever heard of Nicholas Flamel?" he began. He didn't at all expect her to physically flinch away from him.
"When Harry Potter defeated Young Master Malfoy in Malfoy Manor," the elf said, "Young Master Draco's wand swore allegiance to Harry Potter as well as Young Master Malfoy."
Draco took a step away from Harry- or he was going to. His foot never left the floor, and he just fell over. "What- I can't-"
The arms around his waist fell again, and it hit Harry. He was in Draco's room. Sat on Draco's bed. With Draco. And his first impression had been that he was
"Er- yeah, actually. Dumbledore said you say it seven times- no more, no less- and add your heart's deepest desire."
It was easily as long as he was tall; wiry grey and thin, but so very long. He was stroking it as he watched the flames flicker.
"No, you moron," Draco said, grabbing his robes. "Potter, honestly. We don't know where we are, we could've been trapped somewhere, and you want to go
be another snow-day like this tomorrow, and to get some sleep because classes started early as always. But even the thought of homework and classes again barely put a damper on the palpable happiness of the students.
what year that was. It certainly didn't take pity on Draco now; not that Draco was trying to- to "reform" himself or anything ridiculous like that. He was used to the cruel treatment.
"But to answer your question: Blaise and I found that the Slytherin gossip is all rather old, the usual scandals and such repeating themselves. Meanwhile, over here, we can
Harry reached out, enclosed Draco's hands in his, stopping his fidgeting. "Hey," he said, tilting Draco's chin up with the hand not linked to Draco's; when Draco's eyes met his, he smiled softly. "I forgave you for all of that a long time ago, Draco. And I have lots to be sorry for, too." The smile slipped off his face, replaced by a more serious expression. He didn't look away from Draco as he continued. "I'm sorry for judging you and hating you for only knowing one way of life; I'm sorry for never trying to see from your perspective, I'm sorry for never understanding that what you believed in was the only thing you knew.
expression as the snowball fell to the ground. Blaise gulped. "Ah, just a- a little fun between friends, right Draco? Just a joke between us-"
The floor and walls were a blank rough grey stone that seemed to leech warmth out of Harry's body; he found himself shivering in seconds. But that might also have been due to the fact that he knew where he was; yes, he'd been here before.
Well, whatever nefarious plan he was scheming now, Harry would stop him. He was careful not to wake Ron as he left, since Ron would only tell him about how "the war was over and Malfoy had no reason to be doing this stuff anymore". Hermione was really rubbing off on him now they were together.
He headed back up to the castle, up to Gryffindor tower, through the Fat Lady's portrait, and found Ron relaxing by the fire, Hermione resting her head on his lap. They really were cute together; Harry was glad they'd finally noticed each other's feelings after all this time. Upon closer inspection, the two were asleep. Harry decided he could wake them up and tell them about Malfoy's stupid stunt later.
! (You're hopeless. I've tried my best, but you are truly hopeless.) You can't get rid of me! (Watch me.) ... Please don't, Dragon, I love you- (Don't worry, you're as stuck with me as I am with you.) Oh, good. Wait, no, that's not good. (
And then Harry was gone, and so was the pile of- whatever it was he'd been looking through. Draco jumped backwards, shocked, then ran over to where Harry had been; now there was a hole in the floor, leading straight down into pitch black darkness.
He turned sad. "No, she isn't. She died before she could add her memories to mine to join me here..."
"Why- er-" Or perhaps not. "I was wondering why you weren't in the Great Hall for breakfast- it's my turn to look after Viv and the others today, right?"
Hermione seemed just as surprised; she was so shocked, she didn't move to stop Malfoy from grabbing her arm and pulling her outside. Harry, obviously, followed. Who knew what Malfoy could be up to now? The flowers could be poisonous!
The two argued (obviously) and came to the decision that they would sleep in Draco's bed every other night, and Potter's the rest of the time.
"Well, er, I could go get a snitch or something and stay away from you? It's a good night for Quidditch, I don't really wanna waste it." Malfoy waved Harry away with a roll of his eyes. Harry sighed, but flew down to the Quidditch sheds, where all the Quidditch equipment was. He pulled out the case Oliver Wood had shown him, back in first year, and opened it to find the snitch's compartment empty.
They were nearing the mark of it having been half a year since the Battle of Hogwarts, and the castle seemed to be preparing for what was sure to be a dismal day of remembrance. Draco could have scoffed at the idea. His father would have, too; he would have snickered and shot Draco a glance and muttered, "Sentiment is for pathetic weaklings," and Draco would have smirked and snickered and held his head high above the weeping masses of the dismal commoners, all sobbing over their fallen friends.
Harry shut himself off from the world, from his friends. If they weren't close to him, if he cut all his ties- maybe they wouldn't get hurt any further. Besides, when he had been with them, before he shut them all out, he had hated looking in their eyes. All he could see was pity, and sorrow. Loss. Pain. He hated knowing he was the one who'd caused it.
Draco grinned. "So, yeah. I remembered something about Flamel making some really strong healing stone, and I was wondering if you knew anything, cause it'd be far easier to ask you than to go search the library. So, d'you know anything about the stone thing?" He paused, and then turned to where he believed Potter was standing, looking at what would have been his general eye-level if he were visible. "Or you, Potter. Yes, I know you're there. You yourself told me about your invisibility cloak and map thing. I saw you come out." He frowned. "Or, rather, I didn't see
Harry rushed up to McGonagall's office with a brief "Hello," to Dumbledore, Snape, and Fawkes. He grabbed a handful of Floo powder, and called out "Grimmauld Place!" as he stepped into the fire.
Harry had barely finished telling Hermione his story when there was a knock on the portrait, followed by the Fat Lady's squawking. "Neville's probably forgotten the password again," Harry sighed.
Immediately, without his permission, his mouth opened, and he choked out two words, interrupting Harry's rant. "I'm sorry," he said. And just like that, a river of words came rushing out; everything he'd ever thought, ever wanted to say to Harry, to try and make things better. "I'm sorry for insulting you and your parents and the people who first showed you love and tried to help you, and for hurting you and them just because I was such a self-righteous
She could handle herself, and she must have known she could, walking into a den of lions to make one of them bloody flustered. And while the Weasel looked a little on-edge, the mu- Granger and Potter didn't look terribly uncomfortable in the presence of two Slytherins. Strange.
"Oh, if you're here, does that mean that Tom is gone? I don't suppose you'd be here if he was still around." Potter nodded his affirmation. "Right. Well done. I suppose
The list didn't end up being anywhere near as long as Draco thought it would be. And, as he wrote it, he realised how many of his personas bled together when faced with a specific situation.
"Well, when I walked into the Forbidden Forest in the Battle of Hogwarts, I used it to summon my parents and Sirius. Then, when I got close, I just- sorta- threw it aside, I suppose."
"What do you want, Malfoy?" she asked; but she wasn't just asking like normal people did. She knew that he wanted something specific. Clever.
But Draco watched Harry and grew closer as he got better and better, became the Harry the stories told of; happy, skilled, smart. Not the broken husk of himself he'd been for the first 6 months after the war. Better.
"Oh, Draco, darling, don't look at me like that. You know you couldn't get rid of me at this point if you tried. By the way, Potter, please stop looking so gobsmacked. Yeah, I'm sorry I volunteered you to old Voldy, but then you went of your own free will, so you must've agreed with me a bit- don't look like that, you know it's true- and Blaise hasn't really done much, and I doubt Draco's going to apologise first-" she puts her hand by her mouth to "hide" a smirk and shoots Draco a sly look- "What am I saying, of course you know; you two have been alternatively stalking and being stalked by each other these past 7 years-" she blatantly ignores both Draco and Potter's noise of protest, and Blaise has entirely withdrawn from the conversation to have a laughing fit in the corner- "So now we've done all that, and Blaise and I are here- Draco, what
Parkinson rolled her eyes. "Draco wouldn't hurt a hair on Potter's head if his life depended on it, Weasley. Our problem is where they're at, and anyone else that might be with them." Most of the Gryffindors had stopped listening when the conversation turned to Malfoy, so only Hermione and Ron leaned in to hear what Parkinson said. "Y'know, there's been talk amongst the Slytherin parents about a new group of Death Eaters. People who escaped Azkaban and want revenge on Potter. I don't know if it's true, but he could be in danger. Draco, if he's with him, could be in danger too."
broom!" he shouted, and Draco was pulled back to fourth year, when Harry had shouted this same thing when faced with a Hungarian Horntail. Its flames had been the same colour as the sky was now. He wondered if Potter was scared then. He wondered if Harry was scared now.
He had been heartbroken to see- or, rather, hear- the cries of his friends- his family- when they saw him "dead". He had longed to comfort them, reassure them that he was fine, and that soon they would be too, that he would save them all; but he couldn't. He listened as Voldemort made his "I'm amazing and we won" monologue, silently scoffing in Hagrid's arms. And then. Oh, and then.
Jisky hesitated for only a moment before nodding. She led the boys out of the room, still sniffling quietly, and made her way down to the cellars.
! Watch it, Malfoy. Merlin, you're heavy," Potter groaned from beneath Draco. He'd been pushed to the ground when Draco came tumbling out of the sky, providing a soft landing.
! They were gone. Draco was unphased by this, but Harry flinched a little every time an elf apparated.
"Oh, yeah. No. Good point, Malfoy, I don't want you knowing the password to the Gryffindor tower. Er... Let's ask McGonagall?"
, too- I'm sorry for my prejudices and my pride, I'm sorry for the Vanishing Cupboard, and for the Fiendfyre, and for everyone who died, I'm sorry for Dumbledore-" Harry started crying harder, so, as he spoke, Draco moved slowly closer to him, ignoring the painful prickling just behind his nose that he always got just before he started breaking down, and reminding himself that he was safe, Harry wasn't going to hurt him- "I'm sorry for everything I put you and your friends in, and for everything you went through, and that you saved me, and that I tried to Crucio you, and for Malfoy Manor, and for Voldemort- and-" oh, there were Draco's tears. They ran down his face in silent streams, and his voice choked off.
When he stepped off the broom, he fell face-first in a heap on the ground. The adrenaline had been a bit much; and his head was dizzy with victory. He could've sworn he heard a quiet snort, but, in his victory-clouded mind, he brushed it off as his own. Still smiling, he tried to get up and take a wobbly step; when he fell again, he resorted to just crawling back to the castle. Who cared if someone saw him? He'd just- he'd just performed that stunt!
Viv was nearly ready. She was flowering beautifully; she'd have the leaf the potion needed ready that night, Draco thought.
Harry grinned and grabbed Draco's hand. "I make no promises. Now, when we get back in there, I'm telling everyone that you know who made the potions so that you get harassed by them."
He didn't say a word, only handed Viv to Draco with an easy, fluid motion. A ripple of gasps echoed across the hall at this simple, friendly- paternal, even- motion. Draco stood abruptly, bid Pansy and Blaise goodbye, and hurried out of the hall, rocking and comforting Viv, Potter hot on his heels.
"Thanks, you're a life-saver," Draco said. Jisky beamed. He left the Room with a smile, wondering how long it would take for the Stone to melt. In the meantime, doors swung open on either side of him, and students flooded into the halls. Mmm, lunch. Draco headed down to the Great Hall.
), he got just as comfortable as Potter looked; lounging across the chair, head on one of the armrests, legs slung over the other. He looked into the flames as he waited for Potter to say something.
With this revelation, he continued with his theory; mainly, going through and listing the ingredients and what they did, and how they were counteracted by other ingredients, or how they combined or reacted with others.
As he'd been retelling his story, he's entirely forgotten about the snake he'd been holding- now, it appeared, it had slithered its way up his back, his neck, and had taken shelter upon his head. Indeed, his head felt heavier than it had before. As he felt the internal panic rising, Blaise (the holy, god-sent angel from heaven that he was) asked Potter if he could hold the snake- Lizzy? Lisbeth? He'd just call it Lis. As the snake was handed over, Draco let out a barely-audible sigh of relief, and was met with 4 twin stares of humour. How- what? Then he realised. These were all people who had been studying him- specifically
"Obviously," Draco muttered under his breath. Potter ignored him. Wow, his self-restraint had increased drastically since first year.
He'd tried to go in chronological order as much as he could (because that might help with realising what there was, and why it was there, and because Draco just liked things to be organised, okay?) but had a voice-responsive quill write the list so he could add personal notes and additions as he wished.
She gave Pansy, Blaise and Potter stiff nods and formal greetings before turning to Draco. "What happened?" is the first thing she asks him, and Draco is suddenly so,
," the boys said together as realisation flashed through their eyes. Horror followed immediately, for both had read the realisation written across the other's face as they came to a conclusion themself.
And then there was that damned smile on Harry's face. He hadn't smiled in his sleep for a long, long time, being constantly plagued with nightmares as he was.
Potter had said "Oh," quietly; now he strode confidently ahead of Draco, knowing where they were headed.
"Okay. And even if we do get out, how are you planning on getting me to shut up about who made the potions?" He smirked at Draco. "What'll you do? Kiss me?"
He didn't fit quite right in his body. When he told Pansy and Hermione, they sat with him and talked a while. When he left them to head home, he had a few ideas about what to do. He sat down.
he's every one of his previous personas, all taken and mashed up. He's better at hiding some things; better at expressing himself in others. He is also, entirely, mine ((True.)) and he is the hottest man I've ever laid eyes on. He is also the smartest potions master I know, and he is absolutely perfect. Even with his annoying tsundere-like approach to emotions ((Harry, what's a tsundere?) Don't worry 'bout it, love.) and how his hair is so beautiful all tied up like this and slightly annoyingly perfect, and his frown about how I'm describing him positively ((I'm not frowning!) Love, now you're scowling. (... Shut up.) Nope. Where was I? Oh, yeah-) And he is perfect and I love him. He's all of his past mixed together because the past has shaped and changed him and made him into what he is today. He is, right now, more than he ever has been before, loved. By me, by his parents, by his friends- he is loved. Cared for. And we're gonna help him through this, just like we've helped him through other problems, and he's helped us with ours in return. Draco Lucius Malfoy, right now, is himself. He will not be changed or altered in any way. And, I'm pretty sure I'm right in saying that while he is loved more now than ever before, he will be loved even more in the future; by new friends, new family, as well as older ones, too. And, more importantly, he'll be loved by himself. He'll grow into himself, until he fits himself just right. And we'll all be right by him as he learns who he is.
Pansy brushed aside the heavy dressing-room curtains and gasped. "Draco," she breathed, "You look absolutely gorgeous."
Dinnertime had rolled around; as the pair made their way down to the Great Hall, they talked in quiet voices about what might've happened. Zabini and Parkinson were already waiting for the two when they arrived, and they seemed worried, too. When Ron and Hermione had seated themselves, they opened up their issue with the rest of their friends. Ginny (and Luna by extension), Neville, Seamus and Dean, and Parkinson and Zabini overheard, too. None of them would spread the news- who knew how badly Hogwarts would panic if they thought Harry was really missing, not just doing potions with Malfoy. (Actually, they might panic more at the second idea than the first. Harry
Now... What had changed? Draco was now in the mirror, he was holding hands with Harry, and he was smiling.
," he says in a drawl that should've been Draco's chance to put in a witty comment. He resorts to simply having a witty retort.
Not even a minute had passed before every one of them had been hit by a snowball and brought into the fray. Hermione built up a formidable defense wall while Pansy and Blaise supplied the snoballs; Ronald was (for some absurd reason) shaping each snowball with his hands, making far less progress than the others, while Harry and Draco took turns peeking over the wall and flinging snowballs into the fight.
Draco watched Harry lead the student- a Ravenclaw- out of the Great Hall, following quietly as the rest of the group continued to pester Hermione.
" An orb of light, brighter than a Lumos and larger, rose into the air. It hovered above the clearing, illuminating the ground. Draco squinted against the bright light, then turned to where Potter was still searching, having now tucked his wand into his back pocket.
As he had expected, when the clock struck midnight, most of the group were still wide awake, supping hot chocolate and eating the last bits of pudding. Draco hesitantly made his way over to Harry and asked him to join him; Harry stood quickly and followed Draco out of the Hall. Draco lead him to the abandoned classroom a few twisted corridors down from the Great Hall, where Harry's second present had been residing for the last half hour or so.
" And, as one, they turned and left the hall, still reprising their little song and laughing drunkenly, although one stopped on the way out to vomit.
Draco turned the flame up to the hottest possible without melting his cauldron, wiping sweat from his brow.
Choosing the Room as the new location had been difficult and yet easy; the idea, when it came upon him, immediately struck him as obvious and safe and easy. Choosing to willingly face what had happened there before had not been. But he ended up avoiding all of the trauma linked to this room, caught up in the places he ended up creating.
!", the arms around him tightened even further, and Draco pushed his body weight right so sharply that the two spun around in circles.
He tentatively waved at mirror-Harry; mirror-Harry waved and beamed back at him, and Draco stumbled back at the shock of how utterly
Maybe more gifts are given and received. Maybe birthday gifts and well-wishes are sent. Maybe there are sweets, and smiles, and laughs.
"Oh Merlin," Draco murmured, lowering himself to the ground so he wouldn't fall over from the shock of it all.
Harry laughed; upon realising he had done, he looked at Draco as though Draco were a miracle-maker. Then he beamed at Draco; the same blinding smile Mirror-Harry had given him in the Land of the Aurae. Draco felt physically shaken.
"Jisky is sorry to be intruding, but Jisky was sent to notify Mistress Malfoy whether there was an intruder in the Malfoy House," she said, fiddling with her cardigan. Draco had given it to her when he was very young, during a very cold winter. She'd been his personal house elf ever since.
When he was on the last step- 'stir clockwise slowly seven times, and then wave your wand to complete the potion. It should take on a shimmery violet tint'- he decided to add a few Lacewing Flies, because why not? He knew Lacewing Flies were usually used in Polyjuice potions, but other items in the Sleeping draught caused things like poisoning, inflammation, and death, but instead just sent the imbiber to sleep. An ingredient of Polyjuice potion couldn't do much harm, right?
Maybe their stories go down in history. Maybe they are analysed and praised, or criticised and hated; maybe they both hate their situation. Maybe it has been that way since they were born.
He wasn't at breakfast the next morning to see Potter looking for him, a "theoretical" question about sleeping potions and draughts of death and fatal potions on the tip of his tongue. (Although Pansy and Blaise were, and shot each other a knowing look and an eye roll.)
"I thought as such. Harry, come out from under that cloak, my boy." Draco whirled around, and, sure enough, Potter emerged from under the cloak, looking almost sheepish but not quite guilty enough to manage to pull of the expression.
Flamel's eyes lit up. "Yes, yes, yes. I sent Beedle ideas on how to improve the Resurrection stone, but he ignored me. But, theoretically, they would work on the actual stone perfectly... Where is this stone, Potter? Bring it to me, prove it works, and leave me with it, and I will tell you how to make the Philosopher's stone."
Potter emerged from the tops of the stairs, holding a weathered piece of parchment that Draco had hoped he'd find. "How'd you get this?"
He threw open the door to the Room and headed to the nearest cauldron. He removed the staisis charm on it and drew out the shard of the Mirror, trying to recall what Dumbledore had told him to do. Something along the lines of liquifying the stone, adding the heart's deepest desire, and casting a spell to extract it. Okay, two problems there. Draco looked down into the cauldron before him. The
Ron got the pensieve with the memory from Draco; most of the eighth-years present dived into the memory to watch Draco try over and over again to get the Slytherins to sing "Weasley is Our King" correctly, laughing when he ridiculed them (which was often) and full-on wheezing when, at one point, Draco gave up and stormed out of the room, returning a moment later to tell Millicent Bulstrode to "conjure up an airhorn, since it would be more likely to be in key than she was", and applauding the Slytherins when, at last, they managed to perform the song perfectly all the way through and Draco sunk on to one of the common-room sofas with a relieved sigh.
Snape spoke first. "What you've done sounds far too good-willed to be true. Even if this will help you, Draco- why offer it out? Why not sell it? And you said it would be anonymous? Why not even disclose the fact that this discovery was you? You've always taken pride in your work."
Inside Hogwarts, Ron and Hermione split up from Blaise and Pansy- as the Slytherins had insisted on being called- with a surprisingly amiable goodbye. As they headed up to Gryffindor tower, Ron decided that he would wait until Harry was ready to tell him whatever he wanted to until he drew his final conclusions. For now, as long as Malfoy wasn't hurting Harry, Ron would just avoid the subject as much as he could.
Potter looked shocked. "Er, okay. Hello, I'm Harry Potter. Call me Harry. I'm far more human than everyone thinks, and I wake up with nightmares nearly every night. Um, sure, I'll be your friend."
Slowly, more Gryffindors started comparing their tallies and results with the Slytherins; the Slytherins started gravitating towards the Gryffindor tally-record-holder and, by extension, the Gryffindor table, at breaks and lunches. Both houses soon found that they had more common ground than just the tally competitions; they were both
at potions- he stomped over to the cabinet containing the memories, where Potter was stood behind the pensieve, holding the memory Dumbledore had suggested. (He looked, in that moment, like an angry child throwing a tantrum.)
"The Elder Wand, the Invisibility Cloak, and the Resurrection Stone. That was modelled after my Philosopher's stone, you know."
Now Draco flushed, stuttering out excuses and denials. At that moment, Viv started wailing, apparently woken from her nap by the clamour the three were making. Almost instinctively, Draco strode over to Potter, who handed over the plant carefully. This had happened multiple times, and the two had slowly developed a routine. When Viv had calmed down, a snort reminded the boys remembered they weren't alone.
Flat, barren plains, bits of rubble scattered here and there, concrete patches worn and melted into dirt and dust. Heat seemed to radiate off of it, engulfing Draco where he stood.
After a week, Malfoy still hadn't shown up for any classes or mealtimes, and Harry was starting to worry. Malfoy wouldn't skip a whole week of school willingly, even if he was sick. After all, when Malfoy
: the schoolboy sweetheart, with girls drooling over him, and hanging off of his arms, the Slytherin prince with money and flowers and jewellery and presents and a smart mouth and heaps of compliments (You were so good with the girls back then, I guess I can see why you didn't realise you were gay until, like, fifth year. (Obviously, Potter. I'm surprised nobody else apart from Pansy and Blaise guessed, though; honestly, did anybody see how much
, Draco! Merlin, I forgot how strong you are under that aristocratic, pompous persona. Yeah, it's me. Can you let us go?"
The ingredients had been difficult to obtain (as was shown by the fact that he was growing the plants himself), but the brewing of the potion itself was almost impossible. First of all, it was written in a shorthand Draco could hardly read, so he'd had to transcribe it; secondly, he'd had to find rare varieties of stirring sticks and cauldron materials in order to be able to brew the cauldron with as few lethal reactions as possible. He'd avoided any so far, but the most dangerous part was when he added one of Viv's leaves, ground up into a mush, mixed with a drop of his own blood-
Draco, stood under the tree, wrapped up like a present, grinned at him. "Merry Christmas, Harry," he said.
over to his dear Potter so Pansy could eat her breakfast in peace. "But, really, I'm so much better than the Weaslette.
He scanned through his notes again, looking for anything that might have killed it. When he got to the unicorn blood, he barely resisted smacking his head against the desk. So much time wasted waiting on a dead mandrake because he'd forgotten what the unicorn blood did. It created the addiction, yes, but it also counteracted the fatal components of the potion. By taking out the unicorn blood, he'd taken out the addictive part... And also the part that prevented death. So
A light appeared in the darkness, illuminating the space. Harry appeared okay- he looked around himself first, assessing his surroundings. When he appeared to have deemed them safe, he gestured for Draco to join him.
"Hey!" he protested, patting down his hair. He'd stopped gelling it almost entirely this year; it was far fluffier than ever before. Draco found it was also easier to maintain, though when Pansy had declared him "Almost cute," he'd come very close to gelling it back again.
Harry grinned. "Well, if Pomfrey hears about me flying through Hogwarts without a broom and not going to her she'll have a right go at me," he said.
Hermione looked around at the group, seeing their unwavering determination. "Alright, then," she sighed. "I suppose I'll come along so you idiots don't get yourselves trapped or lost or killed or expelled."
The record was recorded on a little yellow erasable post-it note, enchanted to never fall down, and was stuck on the notice board in the Slytherin common room. To Draco specifically, it was nothing more than a reminder to somebody that Quidditch practice was on Thursday; it was a pitifully simple concealment charm, and applied only to Draco. He could probably break it with ease if he knew it was there. So the players of the game were careful not to let slip the true contents of the note.
Draco took a moment to vehemently curse whoever had put up the anti-apparition wards around Grimmauld Place. He couldn't escape this.
"Well, most cats don't have manners, since they don't understand English, Mr. Malfoy," said McGonagall, stepping out from behind a bookshelf, holding a thick volume. "What did you need, Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy?"
"I'm- I'm sorry for the insults, for the judgement, for never giving you a second chance, for the War, and for Voldemort; I'm sorry for never trying to help you, never trying to get you out, for abandoning you, and I'm sorry for the jests and the fights and the curses and for judging you from the
"So- you're famous. You're not hungry, or poor, or in need of anything physical; you're living in your own personal paradise, surrounded by magic, protected. You're not sad. But do you have everything you could ever want? Everything you could ever need?"
Draco's eyes snapped open, and he looked into Harry's eyes for a moment, looking confused and slightly frightened, before the situation hit him. He started flailing madly, his mouth wide in a scream torn away by the wind before Harry could hear it. His eyes were wide and frightened, his skin drained of what little colour it usually held. He looked almost like he had done in sixth year; deathly pale and scared. He turned to Harry for help.
So, in a desperate attempt, Harry turned back around to face Draco (pulling their attached hands over their heads) and said, "There's an antidote, right?"
Draco sectioned off a portion of the Elixir, just in case, before adding the necessary amount to his pre-prepared base potion for the Dreamless Sleep potion. Now, with unicorn blood, he'd usually only have to wait for the potion to stop bubbling until he could move on to the next step. He wasn't sure if he could proceed so quickly using the Elixir, and he did not want to mess this up, so he decided that he'd wait until he physically couldn't any more.
Maybe one boy is just as stubborn as ever he has been; maybe this makes the other boy more determined, for he has always wanted what he wasn't allowed to have.
"In any case, we should head over to Grimmauld Place to use the Floo. We need to get off Hogwarts Grounds to apparate there. C'mon," he said, heading towards the Whomping Willow.
"Um," the teacher said. Some Hufflepuff asked a different question and she turned away to answer them.
"Ah. Well, I'm not sure I can help with that, either. But, maybe Dumbledore can?" Draco sighed. Was this what it was like with
Over Harry's shoulder, Draco could see the sky; shade by shade, it lightened, turning from pitch black to a dark, smoky red. Then it continued to lightened, though becoming more and more vivid a shade of crimson; now, as the two tumbled, it turned blood-red. Danger, Draco thought, though he couldn't quite remember why. The mirror-Harry had played with his mind, and now real-Harry was clutching him as they fell from the scarlet sky, and- oh, Draco thought, the potion's gone red.
He didn't see Ron and Hermione, soaring towards him on Ron's broom, calling his name, didn't hear Malfoy calling for them, didn't hear the panic in his voice as he told them what Harry had said.
He spun around wildly, looking for him, until he spotted a messy black nest of hair, buried in a pile of- well, it looked like gold, but what the letter had said was still fresh in Draco's mind, and Draco had learned (somewhat) from the grass. All that glitters is not gold.
Draco gaped at him. He looked back at the door, and then at Harry. The boys stared at each other for a solid minute, visibly confused, until Draco understood. And then he groaned.
As Ron thought, Parkinson and Hermione started talking very quickly in very high voices about Draco and Harry. Ron put aside his inner turmoil for now and listened.
The Burrow stood tall and crooked, while Hogwarts stood large and proud. Harry's house from Goric Hollow was nestled between them, and when Harry shook the globe, a light snow dusted the roof.
Meanwhile, a dark head of hair popped out from under a scaly-feeling blanket of fabric. Harry waited a minute before following Malfoy back into the castle. His nerves were still high as a Hufflepuff after watching Malfoy drop all that way. He'd nearly had a heart attack- he had even thrown off the invisibility cloak for a short while in a burst of desperation to stop Malfoy from falling. He had saved Malfoy's life last year; that effort wasn't going to be put to waste now! That didn't fully explain the rush of- what was it,
The two sat for a good twenty seconds before there was a yelp from outside. The door swung open, and in flew Draco's wand, as good as when he'd last seen it. Following it was Pansy.
So few students returned overall for their eighth year, they'd been put together in one slightly-larger-than-usual group for classes. This, of course, created problems with conflicting house rivalries and other problems with inter-house arguments; but none of the teachers wanted to split the class and deal with the eighth years for two hours.
McGonagall watched on with a proud smile; in every major conversation that drew the houses together, Draco and Harry were in the center of it, without even meaning to be. Ruler, lion, hero, and dragon indeed.
Potter's expression turned sad. Draco turned away as Potter said, quietly, darting a glance at Draco, "Albus Dumbledore died two years ago, Mr. Flamel."
And Potter has the nerve to smirk and say, "I nearly was, you know; if Malfoy hadn't been such a prick- no, wait, not even. If I'd even properly met Malfoy before I met Ron, I'd probably be a Slytherin right now." And Draco wants to cry at the unfairness of it all- if only his younger self had been a bit smarter, a bit quicker,
looked over his shoulder, he would've been able to tell that Harry was feeling rather confused, a little hurt, and ever so slightly suspicious. He did end up going to ask McGonagall, who only told him that Malfoy was to be trusted. His lingering suspicions were only eased in the slightest, and he was still incredibly confused about why Malfoy had reacted the way he had. When he retold the story to Hermione later, Ginny interrupted halfway through to let Harry know he looked like a "kicked puppy".
good about getting the vaults, and having my father watching the whole time smiling, so I asked to meet Hermione in a good mood.) She came back to the little flat the three of us were sharing singing your praises that night, about how you'd changed so much. Ron was devastated when I agreed with her and told him you and I were actually on speaking terms. (Oh, if only I'd been there.) Yeah, you would've
She retreated from the fire, severed the connection, and made her way to the Gryffindor common room. At her arrival, Hermione and Ron bounded over to her, eager for news on their friend.
Other little bits and bobs of conversation drew the houses together more and more; common ground found between them created a bridge and strengthened newly-made ties between the houses.
It was far more run-down than the rest, but most of it was recognisable. Draco had learned the layout, all of the little things like the genres of books on the bookshelves, the main items in each room, even the organisation method of the cupboards. He'd memorised the smell of the home, the softness of the carpets, the amount of stairs.
"Well..." He paused, then deflated, his body sagging, looking almost ashamed. "You said it yourself," he said, far quieter. "Everyone who had a big role in the war has nightmares now. I- I hate them- the nightmares, I mean- and I'm pretty sure everyone else does, too. Potter was talking about his nightmares earlier. You can tell 'cause he looks over his shoulder like he's looking for the Dark- for Voldemort. And he tenses up, and he just looks annoyed. He's definitely tired of the nightmares, now the war is over and all. We're all supposed to be happy and smiling and perfectly normal now, but we can't be normal when we're all being plagued every night by reminders of the past. I'm tired of it, but Dreamless Sleep is addictive, and therefore dangerous to use.
? But then again, Harry was in his ratty old pyjamas from Dudley, finally fitting a little better but still not quite right around the waist, and his newest jumper from Mrs. Weasley, a pretty burgundy with a golden H. Very, very Gryffindor, and very, very pretty. Really comfortable, too.
Except- if they were mirrors, why couldn't Draco see himself? And how could all of the mirror-Harrys be facing him, when the real one turned in circles, staring at the walls? Draco noticed, absently, that Harry's eyes widened as he watched the mirror, and his hand went to his pocket.
"Don't worry about it, Malfoy," Granger said matter-of-factly. "Harry always gets you something, too." Draco stared at her, dumbfounded.
He spotted it on the table behind him and to his left. He grabbed it- he refused to notice the glint of a golden ring that now sat on the pair of intertwined hands he could see inside- and lowered it slowly into the potion. The liquid went from a vibrant orange to a deep scarlet, almost the colour of blood.
Inside, an old man sat on a wooden rocking chair, the same wood as the door was. A fire roared in the fireplace before him, emitting the plume of smoke Draco had spied from outside.
, boys. Malfoy, c'mon. Ron, I'll be fine. Bye, Harry," Granger said, and Draco was pulled out into the corridor.
," Harry replied immediately. When Draco gave him a surprised look at his quick response, he half-blushed and muttered, "I put it in my memory palace."
Harry was. Draco sank down onto the ground; next to him, mirror-Harrys two and three followed his movements, sitting next to him. When they caught him watching, they both smiled that blindingly bright grin.
Ooh, Draco liked this Flamel guy. He was a bargainer, huh? Well, Draco grew up a Slytherin with Pansy Parkinson. He could bargain.
The rest of the hall looked up at the loud bang, and saw the whole table, heads down, as Draco Malfoy continued to talk. "Come now, Pans, let's go for that run, shall we? Tut tut, up we go. Right, you are
Her voice was cut off when Draco shut the door. Whoops. He'd be in trouble for that later. But for now... "Blaise," he said. "This is urgent. What did you say I nearly gave Potter in first year?"
to tell Pansy, and she could help him name it. But- he was just so dizzy with happiness! He felt so, so, happy. He made his way down to the dungeons, grinning all the way.
you?!" Draco asked, sounding rather exasperated. Harry blinked again, confused. Malfoy muttered something about "
a mother to do that for him, Draco realised with a start. And suddenly he regretted ever having made a jest at Harry about his parents.
He shot up, looking around him; this wasn't Hogwarts, or anywhere else he knew. Where was he? Where was Draco?
Potter poured the memory into the pensieve, and said, "Malfoy, just do what I do. It's so easy, I did it without even meaning to my first time. You can't really mess up. Just follow me." He leaned forwards, plunged his face into the thin pool of water, swirling with memories, and then kept going forwards until he was gone into the Pensieve.
"Yes, Malfoy. Hello. You know, you're worrying your friends, being down here all the time. Personally, I was worried you were turning into Snape," Harry replied. He consciously avoided thinking about the fact that he was worried about Malfoy's wellbeing and- what? No, he wasn't, where did that thought come from?
When the potion had all been bottled up, Harry levitated them into the Great Hall; with all eyes on him, Draco snuck in without anyone noticing and sat down at the Slytherin table. "That's them?" Pansy asked. Draco nodded. "Woah. Well done," she murmured to him.
He knelt next to Draco amongst the presents with a grin, then gasped as he was hit with an idea. "Draco, hear me out, please, but you have to do this. Okay..."
Draco tucked his wand into the inside pocket of his furry grey coat, bent over and joined him, rustling through the leaves with his hands.
He'd set up cushioning charms and other net charms to catch him as he was rising; spells to slow him, lighten him, catch him. Soften the blow if he fell. Merlin knew he'd fallen so many times before. He'd told Pansy he was out here practicing every day. Yeah, he was in the air on a broom, but... He wasn't practicing the truly
Malfoy was lying down on his broom, legs dangling down and arms up under his head as a pillow. He looked so peaceful like that, like there hadn't been a war, like there hadn't been all that death and hatred. His Dark Mark was hidden under his shirt sleeves, Harry presumed, because he couldn't see it. He could only see his silky-looking hair and his soft, pale skin, stretching up his neck, and his high cheekbones and the contrast of Malfoy's white shirt against his dark trousers and his black leather shoes, and -
"No, he's terrible at them. I'm pretty good at them, though. What do you wanna do? Stick Draco and Potter together?"
Oh- there was an idea. But could Potter get in? No, he couldn't. He wasn't a descendant of the family. He probably didn't even know the pace existed. Yes, Draco could hide there.
It appeared that while the day had passed faster than imaginable, the night was taking twice as long as usual. Draco tossed and turned for a good hour or two before finally dropping off into a fitful sleep.
Viv stopped wailing quickly after Draco knelt down; he didn't take any notice of this. Nor did he realise that there was only one person, aside from himself, capable of calming Viv so quickly.
ing his mortar and pestle; he crushed up Viv's leaf, making sure the the sap was fully pushed out of the leaf. Then he picked up his metal scalpel, mentally preparing himself. He cut a thin line across his Dark Mark, dripped one drop of his blood into the mortar, and mixed it in with the leaf. He turned and added the mixture to the potion, stepping back immediately...
Draco smiled. It was working! "Alright, I've got some work for you. Every night, before you go to bed, try this exercise to calm you down. When you're doing the breathing exercise, think of your happy memory. If you wake up from a nightmare, try this, too; it might help you get back to sleep."
"Has a painting up there. I see. Okay then, I'm off. Thank you and goodbye." As Draco walked away, he heard the painting creak open and a far quieter Weasel asking Granger whether Draco had done anything to her. Was he
Flamel's shock was palpable. He froze up, his eyes widened and his mouth parted; he made as though to stand up from his chair in outrage, but then sank down, looking visibly crushed. "Oh," he said, and his voice was quiet, too. "Oh."
He stepped inside. He remembered this house; though he'd been young during his first visit, his mother had brought him back here every now and then, showing him her childhood home.
Draco stepped onto the stairs; he felt Potter's eyes on him the whole time he ascended, until the gargoyle moved back and blocked his view.
When the eighth years began to slowly (but surely) dominate the field with their stronger, more advanced magic (and arguably better coordination, despite them being... Well,
They slowly resume their old stance- meeting casually, never planning to, but with more friendly banter, more inside jokes and smiles and true laughter.
"Weakling," Draco replied, although he had been about to suggest a break; his arms ached, his fingers felt like they were about to fall off from the cold- his nose, too- and his back was screaming from being bent over for so long.
The boys waited until the next day to return to the pensieve and Flamel. When the sun's rays glinted off the black lake and the trees were aglow in the sunrise, they made their way back up to McGonagall's office, both too tired from the previous night to do much more than move one foot in front of the other. At one point they had to stop because Potter had gotten himself stuck in the trick stair, and Draco spent a good ten minutes trying to get him out.
"Er- okay, Malfoy," he said, walking towards the wall at a normal speed. Draco was certain he'd walk face-first into the wall, and fall over-
"Potter," Draco said, becoming dangerously suspicious of something. If what Potter was saying was true, he might've seen Draco brewing the Dreamless Sleep potions... And no one was supposed to know about those! He was keeping them a secret so that if they did end up working, he could have someone distribute them and people would actually drink the potions and stop their nightmares instead of being so distrustful of Draco they refused to drink the draughts. If Potter knew who made the potions, when they were done, he'd go and tell everyone, and all Draco's hard work would go to waste! "When, exactly, was this? And how did you get into my room? I put wards up. And I didn't see you."
Maybe now, they smile and watch these two boys who never got to be children, who were forced to grow up too fast, grow older and more experienced together.
Potter turned away abruptly. When he spoke, his voice sounded a little thick. "Oh, well-" he cleared his throat- "Thank you. It- er, I don't have much like this that I can- can openly display. So, er, thank you."
"Well, until he does, we should give them a ship name to talk about them. A recognisable one, though," said Parkinson.
Blaise (and, by extension, Pansy) continued to play and fuss over the little serpent, who quite seemed to be enjoying the attention. And while Potter had laughed a bit over Draco's palpable relief of having the snake away from him, he was now watching the group with wide interested eyes. Eventually, (and somewhat reluctantly, after years of experience), Draco turned to Narcissa, who was watching him steadily. Once she had his attention, she cleared her throat to say, "I must say, Draco, you haven't been quite this dramatic about Mr. Potter since- oh, maybe fourth year?" Draco got as close to glaring at his mother as ever he had done, while Blaise and Pansy- treacherous demons born of the deepest, worst places in Hell- simply looked on and snickered- "You climbed a tree to simply throw an insult at him and eat an apple. You got turned into- what was it, a ferret?- afterwards by that false Mad-eye Moody. You wouldn't stop complaining for weeks- as a matter of fact, I'm rather surprised you haven't said anything about Mr. Potter as of yet in my visit. I was unaware you refrained from complaining about these things; Merlin knows you complain enough in front of the rest of us- whilst in his presence- but," she said, glancing at Potter to scrutinise him for a few moments, "Oh, would you look at that. I think you're right. His eyes really are very pretty- you never could do them justice verbally, even with your eloquent language and style of speech. Although I did get rather a good idea from all the green eyes you doodled in your spare time-" Potter was staring at Draco, who had flushed a terribly uncomplimentary shade of fuschia during the short retelling of his childhood anecdotes- as Pansy and Blaise's barely-controlled giggling turned into a full-on laughing fit.
"... aren't we? Oh. Zabini, tell me the password this very moment or I swear in the name of my father, I will-"
He emerged in the Shrieking Shack, and made his way out into the streets of Hogsmeade. It was a quiet day today. The shops were open but not busy, and only a few people were roaming the streets at this time.
...) No, no, it's brilliant! *nervous laughter* I love it! (You better.)) a better sense of humour and less offensive quips, made ((Mostly.)) for amusement. Now with more friends, even more money, and a far better reputation with a far better personality. (Draco, love, could you go get me a cup of tea? I promise I won't get the quill to write anything while you're gone. (Don't give me the puppy eyes. No- oh, Merlin.
! Except for- but that's beside the point. I ended up in the corridor, and I found this dog- no, never mind. Anyway, later in the year, someone got down through the third floor corridor and to what was hidden- Nicholas Flamel's stone. There were a bunch of challenges the teachers had set up you had to pass through to get to the Stone, to try and keep people out. So, I was with Hermione and Ron-"
She started by floo-calling everywhere he might have gone; from the Burrow to Godric's Hollow- even the Dursleys'. She had one last resort.
In his hand was a little photograph, a few-seconds-long loop, taken by Bathilda Bagshot on the day of Harry Potter's first birthday. In it, a little boy rode a tiny broomstick around the house, chased by his father, while his mother sat by, laughing.
of- Filch was sat right outside the Gryffindor portrait. If Harry left now, he was sure to be caught.
of the deaths Potter's fault? Except, well, Voldemort, and maybe, possibly- "I'm sorry for Crabbe, and all the other Slytherins, and I'm sorry for what happened to you, I'm sorry for the scars, and for your parents- and- and- and for Dumbledore and Snape, and what you had to do, and for stalking you all of sixth year and never,
Maybe they appear back at the school, after many years, wearing smiles and glowing with happy contentment, and maybe they grow old together, in love. Maybe they have their fights and their differences, and maybe they learn to overcome them.
When Ronald had finished explaining, Draco gave him an appraising look. "Not bad, Ronald, not bad. Okay. I'll get the others, you get the paper.
He stood and turned to face the direction it had come from- the main snowball fight, which was still going strong. The fight had stopped, however, when Draco was hit, and the participants had all turned to watch Draco. As he glared at the group, they all seemed to cower a little. Ooh, it'd been a while since Draco had terrified the younger students. He was going to have some
Potter- who he'd let down earlier, and had since slept still and rigid- started frowning, mumbling, and twisting in his sleep; then he started kicking and flailing, and his mumbles turned into incoherent shouts; Draco scrambled away so as not to be hit. Potter jerked awake very suddenly, eyes flying open. He looked around wildly for a few moments before he spotted Draco. He squinted and, hesitantly, asked, "Malfoy?"
"I needed you for the information about the Stone. When I withheld from telling Potter earlier, it was because I didn't know I needed information so badly. If I
Maybe they make their own side, and bring their friends; a side where the past is far behind them, and the future is a new beginning.
Potter sighed and started heading off in the opposite direction to the one Draco had started going towards. "Yeah, I know just the place. C'mon, Malfoy. Do you remember the Room of Requirement?"
to fall back to sleep. Didn't come back to bed, either. I checked the Map this morning and it said he was in Snape's old classroom, which could only be
"Well, do that but with people. Get out of the Room of Requirement, get back into Hogwarts; start going to lessons and all again. But pay attention to your friends. To anyone you want to put into your house, really. Memorise them. Little things they do when they're bored, how they fiddle, what they like to eat, their speech patterns; memorise them."
As soon as they left the shelter of the building they were hit with a wave of cold air and a layer of snow. The wind whipped around them as they made their way up to Hogwarts, tangling Draco's now-soft hair. Just as they were crossing into Hogwarts boundaries again, the snow began to recede, and the soft snowflakes from before returned. The floor was now coated in a thick layer of snow, and every step made a soft
, Draco saw) but Harry (looking like he was far too accustomed to a house-elf habit though he'd never owned a house-elf) snatched it away before she could. She wailed and went for another book (
McGonagall nearly collapsed in relief as she realised what he was doing. He'd looked so much like James, hanging from the ledge, doing something so stupid and risky.
Draco looked away. "Least I could do." Then he decided that he had been kind enough to Potter to make up for all his previous years of terribleness and threw up his usual Malfoy aristocratism. "In any case, now you're awake, let's go trade the Stone."
He then walked over to the edge of the Forbidden Forest, leaving Pansy and Blaise to guard his snowman, and picked two massive tree branches to be arms. He levitated them back over to the snowman and pushed them into the sides of the body. Then he carefully- oh so carefully- pushed the carrot into the snowman's head, with Blaise and Pansy stood behind the snowman head and supporting it to make sure it wouldn't roll away.
! Wait- Potter. Don't tell me." Draco had spotted something at the foot of the chair; his gaze fixated on it, and Potter's drifted down to see where he was looking. Potter groaned. "Potter! Oh my
Parkinson frowned. "Hmm... It'll do, I suppose. Not the most original or names, nor the most secretive... Oh well, those two are so oblivious, they wouldn't figure out it's about them."
been, Ron supposed. He couldn't actually think of a single time this year that Malfoy had insulted Hermione- especially not for her blood status.
And it's so similar to a time, way back in second year, when the two were facing off in a duel, and Draco can't help but raise his chin a bit, step forward haughtily, and say, "You
"Uh oh indeed," Draco smirked as McGonagall used her wand to levitate an army of snowballs and send them hurtling at Sprout. A few hit Hagrid's cabin; he came out a moment later, and seeing what was happening, quickly joined in the fun.
Harry had knelt, and he was slightly shaking; Draco was reminded, suddenly, of how Harry had looked before he'd broken down at Grimmauld Place. It'd been somewhat like this.
He continued looking over the room, seated on the edge of Draco's bed. He saw a black cabinet and a matching bookshelf, a dark blue door he assumed was the exit of the room, and- upon closer inspection- another door, blended into the walls by the same paint and patterns which led to an en-suite bathroom. It had a bath like the one in the prefects' room at Hogwarts, with many differently coloured taps. Harry closed the door quietly and thought with a frown that it seemed far too bright; he noticed a window was open, and the sun was rising in the distance. It couldn't be morning
Draco, still half-turned around, fell, as the staircase flattened out and turned into a ramp. He scrambled for purchase, clawing at the walls, as Potter slipped back slightly. For the second time, Draco fell onto Potter.
Harry could pinpoint the exact moment he knew something had gone wrong. It was when the presence at his back disappeared.
Harry was unbelievably clumsy; always tripping on air and dropping things, falling over his own feet. (The invisibility cloak was an absolute nightmare; he had often tangled himself up in it and needed someone else's help to untangle himself. Especially when he was wearing it and he couldn't see his own two feet.) And he had always been jumpy and easy to scare- even more so after the war. While at Hogwarts, many a Gryffindor had gone to ask Harry a question while he was staring into the Common Room fire in silence, and he'd nearly stunned them across the room, or fallen off his chair, always spluttering a string of apologies afterwards. Fred and George had used this to their advantage countless times, and neither ever apologised. After all, Harry would just laugh it off afterwards. Ginny once tapped Harry on the shoulder during a Quidditch match, and he'd nearly fallen off his broom. (Nobody made that mistake again.)
"Well, that's the other thing I came for." He turned to face the large portrait of Albus Dumbledore, hung on the wall behind him, watching with kindly eyes; and, by extension, the smaller, darker portrait of Severus Snape, hung next to Dumbledore. "Hello, Uncle Severus; Professor. Do you two know about what I've been doing?"
Draco himself, however, was still trying to puzzle out what he was seeing. He turned away from Harry, back to the mirror, and noticed that as he moved, mirror-Harry did too. Huh.
"Talk to them!" Draco yelled back. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw understanding flash across Potter's face.
done) before continuing his climb. By the time he'd made it to the top of the tree, Ronald had finally managed to lower himself to a branch below him, and was watching Draco. When he noticed Draco's attention on him, he called up, "Not bad, Malfoy."
Jisky had eaten; she was waiting patiently for Draco and Harry when they returned. "Jisky will be leading Harry Potter and Young Master Draco out of the House now," she said. She took both their hands and apparated them to the edge of the Malfoy grounds; Harry and Draco needed only to step out and they would be out of the apparition wards and able to apparate to just outside Hogwarts grounds.
He pointed his wand at Potter and himself, muttered under his breath, making shield charms around the both of them. Then he made more specific anti-werewolf defences around Potter first, and then himself.
set Madame Pomfrey off. She started berating Snape (who looked already hungover and drunk, and had his hands over his ears to block out the noise) for such terrible manners and terrible control of his students, and then Pansy, Blaise and about fifteen other Slytherins came wobbling into the great hall, giggling and crying and heading in the general direction of Malfoy. They were warbling a- a song?
The excuse of a teacher agreed with Potter immediately, obviously, and Draco prepared himself to spend an hour practicing something he'd mastered in first year. He wondered if he could cast the spell wordlessly. Since Pansy still hadn't un-silenced him, he supposed he'd find out.
Potter still brought him food; he'd been sneaking food in from the kitchens (he'd tried asking the Room for some, but it just didn't taste quite as good) and had taken to cooking up lunch for Draco and himself. It forced Draco to take a (well-needed) break from his potions and plants, and it allowed Potter a break from his memorising of his house.
Meanwhile, up in the Gryffindor dormitories, Harry awoke gasping for breath, from another nightmare.
McGonagall, though incredibly worried, steeled herself, nodded, and shooed Ron and Hermione out of her office so she could start working on finding Harry.
Draco took the parchment from Harry. At his touch, the writing on the paper flared gold, like the surrounding landscape he was in. He read the new writing.
. Big, scaly thing- I believe that would-be coward Longbottom-" Draco let a sneer take over his face as Potter made a satisfying noise of protest- "killed it. Y'know the one-
Ronald presents, since they were buying him things too. He managed to get Hermione a custom-made self-inking quill that would suggest phrases and other such improvements to her writing, and a paperweight of a small house-elf, which he had S.P.E.W carved into. He also had an idea for what to get Ron.
So he looked down, and saw what he was sat on: a bed. Specifically, a blanket on a bed. A fluffy blue throw on a blanket on a bed, the same dark blue colour as the carpet. Why was he sat on a bed? Whose bed was he sat on?
Blaise, who was previously scowling at her, but is now smirking at Draco, says, "50." Draco corrects himself. He hates Pansy, and Blaise, both of them are
Draco threw open the door, rushed over to his potion; he completed the steps for the rest of the Sleeping Draught ever-so-slowly, making sure he was following all the instructions to the t. Harry watched him work with bated breath, hoping and hoping and hoping...
There came one more tug, so strong Harry was toppled backwards over his chair. Every eye in the classroom turned to him.
, Malfoy. The night of the Battle of Hogwarts, I died. You can ask your own mother- she's the one who told that to Voldemort himself."
The Method of Loci is also another thing you can try out. There are loads of videos about it online if you'd like to try.
Harry, who he could touch, who wasn't separated from him by a layer of glass. Apparently his Harry had been watching him with the Mirror; he stumbled slightly as Draco fell, looking at him in confusion. He blinked.
After a minute or so of struggling, Draco was firmly seated; this time, he wrapped his arms around Harry's chest and up, so his hands clutched Harry's shoulders. His body pressed firmly against Harry's back, and Harry could tell he was secure.
. They should be thick carpets, like at home. Far more comfortable. The gargoyle revealed an alcove and another twisting staircase.
"That's just a children's story, Potter. Everyone knows that. How do you produce to the Elixir of Life from the Stone?"
Harry reached out and took his invisibility cloak from where he'd stuffed it in his pocket after being caught in McGonagall's office. He pulled it around himself, disappearing under the material as he did; he left his head out to prove he hadn't just cast some spell of sorts.
Draco nodded his acknowledgement. "So, once you memorise someone, you pick a room that they'd most likely be found in- so, for your Weasel, probably the kitchen-" Potter made a sound of protest, but Draco smirked and moved on- "And you put them there, in your home in you mind, doing something- always doing something, because you'll remember movement better than most other things. So, put Granger on the sofa, reading, for example, rather than having her stand around doing nothing. Have Luna sitting upside down reading the Quibbler, rather than just pointing at something and smiling. The crazier and more absurd, the better.
He spotted just the slightest blur of black below him, blurred by his speed; as he approached rapidly, Draco became clearer. His eyes were shut tight, limbs loose, his robes snapping around him wildly in the wind.
"That doesn't help!" Ron said incredulously. "What's Malfoy gonna do if they get in trouble? What if Malfoy is the one
Harry jumped forwards in excitement, falling on the ground; as Draco went to make sure he was okay, he began doing what Ronald was, only... Faster. After a few seconds, he called out, "Levitate me!"
"Oh," Potter said, "Malfoy, meet Lis. Lis, this is Malfoy." The snake hissed at Potter, seemed to actually glare at Draco, and then slides onto Potter's arm- which is held out towards Draco- and towards--
' even as the ink spread, painting the map of Hogwarts he'd pored over for hours at a time, searching for the very name he was looking for now. When the map had fully unfolded, Harry frowned.
Hermione groaned. "You could have all infiltrated us and found us during the war- and the Order- and even Siriu-" she started saying, but Ron interrupted before she could wind herself up too much.
on it to see what it was. Turned into that. I left a copy of it back at Godric's Hollow, but I thought you should have the real thing."
He rose with the sun, praying that the mandrake had awoken, too; alas, when Draco returned to the potions area of the Room, he found the Mandrake still sleeping peacefully.
"Really, people are supposed to be there to prompt you, to make you think a certain way. So a Hufflepuff might be there to make you think more kindly, a Gryffindor to make you braver. A Ravenclaw to make you smarter, a Slytherin to help you achieve your goals. So, that's your mission for the next-" he glanced at the potion- "two days. After that, I'll need you to supervise me with the potion in case something goes wrong. But till then, off with you. Go learn some people, inside and out."
What if instead of causing the drinker of the blood to live half a life, it cursed them in another way? It made them addicted to the potion?
Potter's eyes widened and darted around the way he did whenever he accidentally revealed something. Ooh, suspicious. "Oh, er, a children's story. Yeah, obviously. 'Course." So he was hiding something. Draco filed that away to think about later. "Er, the Elixir? I'm not sure. Ask Hermione?"
As they watched, Sprout hit Binns with snowball... except it sailed right through him and hit McGonagall squarely in the head.
Maybe they are there with each other, again; but maybe they help each other, rather than side against each other.
And he'd cried as Harry flew him away from Crabbe, flew him away from the room of leaping flames, the same colour as the sky all around him.
Ronald (whose branch was shaking violently) screamed and held onto the branch; Blaise had fallen silent; Pansy stood back and watched. It was Hermione- bless her saintly soul- that saved him; she cast a series of lightening and levitating spells at him just as the tree began to fall sideways. "
"Well, I, er, I have this invisibility cloak... I guess it protected me from the wards, too. I brushed past you at one point; you went and closed a window." Draco's eyes widened. Potter had seen him brewing the Dreamless Sleep! Oh, no, no, no,
He picked up his gold stirrer- the only pure-gold thing he owned, though he'd begged his father for a gold cauldron in First year. He shook off the memory as the moon rose directly overhead.
"You're welcome. In any case, I learned- I mean, I remembered a new method to calm yourself. It's also a way of remembering things pretty well. And it's why I brought you-" he gestured to the home around him- "This.
But overall, Harry was improving. One day he went shopping. Visited Hogsmeade. Then Hogwarts. Went flying. (Panicked a bit at the snitch, but he was almost normal apart from that.) The group all watched as, one day, he made them breakfast. A luxurious stack of pancakes, one of Dudley's favourites. He worked with a smooth, practiced efficiency, and nearly smiled when he flipped a pancake in the air and it landed safely back in the pan. He was getting better. Draco watched, grinning, from where he thought he couldn't be seen. He almost looked... proud. If you ever asked him, he would deny this, and change the topic; but Hermione, who had snapped a picture (Ron had wanted it for blackmail, but Hermione wanted a memory) brought it up once, and Draco couldn't ever deny it again. (He still tried, to no avail.)
"Well, off you go, then," he said, making a shooing gesture towards the doors. When Harry had left, he stepped back over to the cauldron. "Melt it, huh?" he murmured to himself. But he didn't want anything to go wrong... He set the Stone in the cauldron and turned the flame below it to a low heat. But... Even though this was far safer, it would also take ages. And Draco didn't want to stay and watch. So...
Draco frowned and Harry sat back, gaping. What month was it? December? And he'd started school in September. Jisky hadn't eaten anything
Theodore Nott turned to Blaise. "I bet you 10 galleons you can't get Draco to confess his love for Potter before the week is out."
"Now, try the breathing pattern from earlier. Remember your happy memory. I'll count. One, two, three, four. One, two, three four, five, six, seven. One, two, three, four, five six, seven, eight. Very good.
"It can," Draco moaned. "The main ingredients can only be picked at the full moon, and I bet that Snape's supply is all out... When's the next full moon?"
That night, Draco met Potter by the edge of the Forbidden Forest. They exchanged a glance and a nod, and then walked in together, side by side, illuminated wands held high.
As they left, Draco kept up a running stream of insults to the Gryffindor house and their reckless, rule-breaking idiocy, to the Deathly Hallows, to the Forbidden Forest, to Dumbledore and Flamel and mostly, to moronic, messy-haired boys with no sense of self-preservation and an endless resource of bravery who have
Maybe one boy gives the other a small, intricate, enchanted dragon to accent clothes that crawls all over the other boy's body. Maybe the dragon is the most treasured thing to the other boy.
He was at the back of the room; the front was hidden, enveloped in a darkness he couldn't see through. He went to grab his wand, and found nothing there. He cursed, remembering that Draco had his wand... and Draco was on the other side of the door at the end of the corridor. Well, there was nothing for it. Harry gathered all his Gryffindor courage and walked- more cautiously than he would have done normally- into the darkness.
wanted to know the meaning of their name. Hufflepuffs, Ravenclaws, Slytherins and Gryffindors crowded around the little corner-section of the four tables for the rest of breakfast; their next classes were spent comparing names and meanings.
"Lie down, and close your eyes." Potter obeyed. "Good. Now, you can cast a Patronus. You know the process of casting one. Think of your happiest memory. Visualise it now. Picture it as well as you can. Were the people there? Who? Were they smiling? Do they have freckles? What colour are their eyes? Where are you? What's the weather like?" Each question Draco asked brought forth an element of the memory; as he prompted more details from Potter, Potter began to smile. Good.
Draco's jaw dropped open; Severus, seeing the connection Draco had made, snickered. Even angrier at the fact that now he had been tricked into disclosing absolutely everything to Potter- of all people! Why was it always
he is. He practically stalked me all through sixth year, didn't he? I heard his friends say he never shuts up about me. Imagine
Then he saw his hair; almost-but-not-quite messy, and soft to the touch. Finally, he noticed his face- or, rather, what Pansy had done to his face.
Harry shot out of bed and down to the common room. Sure enough, the windows there stretched from floor to ceiling, providing a magnificent view of the grounds. Through them, he spotted a small shining pinprick of blonde hair.
Potter pointed his wand at the parchment and said, "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good." The parchment unfurled, ink spreading across it, painting a labyrinth of lines across the parchment. Draco watched it form a map of- of Hogwarts?
"So did nearly everyone who had such a big role during the war. I'd be more surprised if you slept peacefully." Draco froze like a deer in headlights. His body stiffened up, eyes wide, and he stopped moving entirely. "Oh, Merlin. Draco. What did you do?"
