The thudding resolved unmistakably into the sound of a fist on wood. Specifically, a wooden door. A great wooden door that stood, thick and looming, in the back of Harry’s mind, quaking with each pounding knock.
Draco opens his eyes. Potter’s hips are twitching, his hand gripping his cock but not moving, like he’s waiting for Draco, like he wants to do this together.
“Now we know what it is, we might be able to undo it,” Hermione said earnestly. “It might not be— You might be back to normal before you know it.”
He Apparated from St Mungo’s to the Burrow, thrilled that, for the first time in months, he’d be spending longer than twenty-four hours away from the hospital. Mrs Weasley was overjoyed to see him, and Harry spent a wonderful afternoon pottering around the Burrow and chatting, her sympathetic questions startling truthful answers out of him. When he left, she hugged him tightly and made him promise not to leave it so long until his next visit, because she would still love him even if he had no idea who she was.
“Malfoy?” Potter prompts.
Harry blinked rapidly. “Thank you,” he said. “Both of you. Thank you for looking after me while I’ve been so useless.”
Draco raised an eyebrow and met Harry’s gaze. He looked so much like his usual self that Harry’s control slipped; his hips thrust upwards, burying him impossibly deeper.
It’s 3:33.
Who were these people? The owl had delivered the letter to him – was he Harry? He didn’t feel like a Harry. He didn’t feel like an anything.
Draco laced his fingers together. “Potter—”
“That’s— Fuck—”
Potter makes a muffled noise of surprise and Draco lets out a giddy laugh – he can
– and Harry keeps taking, keeps moving his hand, keeps pounding into him. His bloodlust and his human lust are one giant, swirling entity, dragging him to the edge, closer and closer and–
It’s the maddest thing that’s ever happened to me—and before the age of fifteen, I’d been knocked out by a giant chess piece, had my pet rat transform into the person who murdered my best mate’s dad, and had been consensually kidnapped by mermaids.
Malfoy snorted. “Yes, it’s a yes, you tireless arsehole.” He waved an impatient hand. “Lead the way.”
Harry couldn’t help but grin in return. “I love you,” he said, just because he could.
“Voldemort,” Potter said eventually.
Malfoy tugged him down and kissed him, long and deep and soft. Harry lost himself in it, fancying he could taste Malfoy’s come on his tongue, feeling his cock stir again.
“This coming from the King of Subtlety himself?”
the fucking thing.
“You’re being stupid,” Harry says. Even so, he can’t stop himself from taking three slow, prowling steps towards Malfoy. “You know I can’t control it. Not when it’s been this long. Not when you smell so
Malfoy swallowed. Licked his lips again. Nodded.
“Touch me,” Draco demanded, his tone not imperious but high with desperate pleasure – even worse for Harry’s willpower. “Harry, please – Touch me – Touch me, I’m so close–”
Harry’s gasp is swallowed by Draco’s mouth. It’s just as good as their kiss at the wedding. No, it’s better, because there aren’t a hundred people staring at them, because Harry isn’t thrown by how good it feels, because Draco presses his whole body against Harry and Harry’s insides light up like a
“I suppose he gets away with it because of his fancy clothes and his pretty face,” I grumble, glaring at Malfoy as I take another drink. He’s scowling and waving an imperious hand to the bottles stacked behind the bar.
“What’s this?” he asked cautiously.
“I want you to fuck me so hard that I feel it for weeks,” Malfoy said in that same dazed voice.
Harry smiled, though he wasn’t sure whether or not Malfoy was joking.
“If you intend to continue with this course of therapy,” he continued in that same distant, professional tone, “tonight I’d like you to practise visualising your mind as a physical space. If you can, picture a few of your memories from the last few months behind a locked door, in a closed box, whatever feels natural. This will form the basis of our work going forwards.”
“Does he feel good?” Harry asks me roughly. His eyes are dark, his renewed attention delicious. “Does Draco’s arse feel good around you?”
! More, please – Potter–”
“You’re lying,” Harry growled, punctuating his words with another slow, sharp, deep thrust. “You said, in your letter–” another thrust – “what was it? An Auror told you the spell in an–” thrust – “‘intimate situation’.”
it, wants to see what other noises he can draw from Potter, and he closes the distance between them to capture it, to swallow it, to make it a part of himself for this glorious, blessed thirty minutes. The kiss consumes him, and he finds himself acting completely without thought – he’s surprised when his fingertips slide against the warm, smooth skin of Potter’s stomach, not having realised that his hands had slipped under Potter’s shirt.
First, there was
“Yes. We’ve spent a lot of time using the doors to connect memories. Today I want you to hide a memory behind a door so I can’t access it.”
It’s only the fine gold lettering on the back of the box that identifies its origin: a simple, elegant
. It’s exactly three o’clock.
Again, Potter obeys without hesitation. He draws himself off Draco’s cock and clumsily arranges himself until he’s spread out on the bed. His cock lies against his belly, hard and dark and leaking. He wraps his hand around it and groans.
“Yes, yes.” Malfoy shifted on the bed so that Harry was pressed firmly between Malfoy’s legs, Malfoy’s foot hooking around the back of him and pulling him downwards. Harry moved his hips to push his aching cock against Malfoy’s answering hardness. They both groaned.
God, Harry wanted to grab him and kiss those mechanical words right out of him.
“I fucked you!”
Harry lifted his free hand to Draco’s sharp jaw, tilting Draco’s head with the smallest pressure of his thumb. God, he smelled so good. Draco’s lips parted easily, and Harry darted his tongue out to taste him. It wasn’t enough. It was too much. Everyone was looking at them. Draco was his
The group of students who returned to Hogwarts as eighth years is so small that, rather than work out the logistics of setting up new dorms in the existing houses, McGonagall lumped them all together. A corridor on the third floor was destroyed during the Battle; instead of being restored to its former state, the area was converted into a simple common room and two dormitories. In the girls’ dorm, there are six people: Granger, Patil, Patil, Li, Bones and Abbott. In the boys’, there are eight: Draco, Macmillan, Corner, Boot, Goldstein, Thomas, Longbottom and Potter.
“Hey,” Potter says. “What are you talking about? Hey – Look at me.”
“I’d encourage you to keep a diary of similar thoughts and feelings you have,” Malfoy said, sitting back down and tapping his own notebook in demonstration. “It may be easier to thread together what inspires them when they’re seen as a group.” He glanced at Harry, then quickly looked away again. He laced his fingers together.
And there were only fourteen hours until Harry saw him again.
Harry sat in the wingback chair. The sky had begun to cloud over, snapshots of shadows breaking up the stretches of sun. Malfoy’s pale skin shifted from golden to grey, even as his expression remained stoic, unchanging.
Malfoy inhaled sharply. “What sound? Describe it to me.”
The long grass behind Malfoy rustled in the sea breeze. Malfoy’s fingers flexed on Harry’s shoulder.
The hangover rekindled Harry’s ire from the night before. This was all Ron’s fault. How did he have the nerve? The things he accused Malfoy of – yes, Malfoy could be snappy, but Harry was certain he wasn’t evil. He’d got the Dark Mark when he was sixteen years old, not even of age. Where did Ron get off, blaming him for stuff Death Eaters did when Malfoy was a kid?
Harry’s conviction waned. “Or … I can back off right now.”
“Oh? Was it a good present, then?”
“You were so slippery this time,” Harry murmurs. Talking helps to keep himself in check, helps to remind him that he’s still a person with a brain, even if he no longer has a heart. “I almost lost you halfway through. What did you do? Did you fly?”
There were three weeks left until his wedding day.
”– but I’d like to see you at eight o’clock tomorrow evening.”
“Describe it,” Malfoy repeated in that same strained voice.
“We could come now, take the edge off,” Potter suggests, his voice low. He moves his hand up and down, once, slowly. A bead of pre-come grows at the tip of Draco’s cock, adds a torturous slipperiness between them. “Then we could spend the rest of the afternoon doing things properly. Everyone else has gone home, and Terry and Anthony are at Hogsmeade, they won’t be back ’till six. I dunno about you, but I’m definitely not gonna last that long.”
He didn’t–
charms while Healers in green robes scribbled on clipboards.
.” The door swung open, revealing the disapproving face of Professor McGonagall.
– Don’t wanna come yet, Harry, please–”
“You haven’t told him, have you?” he asks softly.
” and clenches around us, his stomach tightening and his thighs seizing and his arse pulsing as he comes. His spunk splashes onto me and my hips stutter—fuck, that’s so hot—but Harry fucks us both through it, his cock dragging against mine inside Draco’s tight, clenching heat.
Harry's mouth is too full to respond, but he hums and looks up at us through his lashes. I groan and cling harder to Malfoy to stop my knees from buckling. He laughs, delighted, and presses closer.
“Mitsy? Oh, she’s around somewhere. Why, do you need her?” Draco was frowning, clearly stumped by Harry’s presence.
“I know what you meant,” Malfoy said. “I just didn’t – Well. It’s fine. Thank you for apologising, but I understand you must have been shocked. I had assumed that your friends had already made you aware of the details. I should have made sure. It was my mistake.”
Malfoy stayed close as they left the pub and lingered outside the door. It was the moment where one of them should have announced that they were heading home, that they’d see each other tomorrow, but Harry certainly wasn’t going to be the one to initiate their parting.
“But— I thought we could just— I’m not actually going to
“He keeps saying we should bring in someone else to keep him busy when I’m not feeling it,” Harry continues casually.
Draco’s hum of acknowledgement dissolves into a soft snore. Harry smiles, rests his cheek against the top of Draco’s head, and allows his eyes to drift closed.
Harry’s rhythm doesn’t falter as his hand drops to Malfoy’s cock. It hardens further at Harry’s touch, blood rushing under the delicate skin and, god, Harry wants him, wants him so much, can’t
” He flinches as Harry allows his right eyetooth to nick the side of Malfoy’s cock. It’s not deep, but it’s enough, and a thin stream of hot, syrupy blood fills Harry’s mouth. Harry groans and starts to wank himself in earnest.
“Okay. Erm.” Harry took another fortifying drink. “The reason I started using the Pensieve isn’t because I’m trying to hide resentful feelings towards you or anything,” he said in a rush. “It’s because before two weeks ago I didn’t have any kind of sex drive and all of a sudden it came back and I didn’t want you to see what I was – what I was, er. How I was dealing with that.”
Malfoy sighed. “You should know I cherish every instance of you questioning whether or not I can do my job.”
“Yeah, it’s still there.” If anything, it had intensified, as if Harry’s past self knew he was close to being released.
, please—Draco—”
Hermione raised her eyebrows and looked pointedly at his hospital gown.
“Malfoy,” Harry growled.
He didn’t know who he was.
Harry went into the hallway, shivering as he left the warmth of the fire. “Yeah, it’s me. Where are you?”
“I do.”
As memory-Harry watched, transfixed, memory-Draco bent down to say goodbye. Agatha nodded seriously, her eyes wide. Even from across the room, Draco could tell she was on the verge of crying. Gratifyingly, his past self also noticed; he pulled a face at her, crossing his eyes and sticking out his tongue. Agatha giggled reluctantly.
But despite Harry’s attempts to get lost in the concrete maze of the city streets, his feet invariably took him to Charing Cross Road and the Muggle entrance to the Leaky Cauldron. The barman always welcomed him with a smile and ushered him to the booth Harry used to share with Ron and Hermione. Harry always ordered a drink and nursed it until closing time, practising his mental exercises for lack of anything better to do.
“Ron,” he says, strained. Just that, just my name. But knowing he knows it’s me, that it’s my name in his mouth, spurs me on. I take him deeper.
“It can be,” Malfoy said. “Granger mentioned that your Occlumency tutor had been rather heavy-handed. She was not too polite about it – but I suspect he thought you would react instinctively to a more brutal approach.”
Malfoy lowered his wand. “Are you all right?”
Malfoy smirked and stood. “Come on, get up. You’re up for a duel, yes?”
it. Draco can’t stop his hips jerking forwards, and Potter just
He’s right; mine are prettier. Where I assume his Dark Mark used to be is now a gnarled, lumpy stretch of skin. I’m familiar with the texture of it from visits to Charlie’s—it’s a burn scar. A bloody serious one.
Malfoy’s eyes were molten silver. Perhaps it was just the habit of having to maintain eye contact with him during their sessions, but Harry couldn’t look away. If he were to cast
He hadn’t been thinking at all. As much as he believed – and he did believe – that people could change, that they had all been much too young, when it came down to it, that hadn’t been enough.
Hope, he realised. That’s what that strange feeling was. Hope.
right now?”
“No.” The warmth of a body. An arm across his scarred chest.
The fucker goes completely still, his eyes hot, his breath quick.
The world is narrowing around me. I can no longer see the fairylike glints from the ridiculous chandelier, the gleam of the dark, polished wood of the bed, the stupid giant gilt-edged mirror that looks like it belongs in a palace. I can’t hear the crackle of the fire or the clunky ticks of the grandfather clock by the door. All I know is the roaring in my ears and the quake of my thighs and Malfoy’s gorgeous mouth and clever tongue and tight throat taking me apart while Harry watches with dark eyes and wet, swollen, parted lips.
Harry looks at me then, his expression sliding from affection to amusement. “I know…? What?”
Before Harry could school the disgust from his face, there was a knock on the door.
“Oh dear,” she said sadly. “You forgot to tell him he looked nice, didn’t you?”
“I don’t want to talk about the War. I want to talk about you. I want you to know that anyone who judges you on things you did at sixteen is an idiot. I want you to know how amazing you are.”
“So when you said you’re my Christmas present, and you don’t want me to return you…”
“I’m going to cast Legilimency,” Malfoy said. God, the weight of his eyes sent shivers down Harry’s spine. “I want you to immediately focus on your mental space, exactly where we were just before the duel. Can you do that?”
Hermione whirls on him, and Harry schools his expression into one of surprised innocence.
A flash of need – Harry was sure it was need – passed over Malfoy’s face, but he shook his head, not taking his eyes off Harry. “We can’t.”
Sighing, he banished the letters into the drawing room and began to plough through them. He could identify fanmail at a glance and burned each one on sight, but even then, it was early afternoon before he’d opened them all. By the time he was done, only a single stack remained. It was good progress, he thought.
Harry dragged his gaze up to look Malfoy dead in the eye. “I want you,” he said.
“Hey—!” Harry says, but the protest dies in his throat when Draco leans forwards and puts his hand on Harry’s thigh. The light from the TV paints his pale fingers yellow, then green. He squeezes, and sparks of ice and heat tingle under Harry’s skin. Harry’s legs widen.
“Self-important dickhead,” Potter amends solemnly. “I knew it wasn’t a love potion, and it was just so bloody nice to hear.” He huffs a frustrated sigh. “I should have made sure – shouldn’t have been so spontaneous. I’m really sorry if we did anything you didn’t want to do.”
“I don’t know who I am, or who you are, or why I woke up in this weird house with unsettling snake-head decor and a bad-tempered elf.”
“This is purely conjecture on my part, you have to understand. It’s likely that we may never know the truth, but I’ve done a lot of research – and so did Granger, which was annoyingly helpful – and I think, given what we know, that this is by far the most likely–”
“Are you joking? Or were you genuinely not listening the four separate times I brought it up?”
“On the bed.”
It didn’t mean giving this up.
“Whoa.” Harry’s eyes widened and he held up his hands in surrender. “I was only kidding.” Maybe Ron had a point – Harry wouldn’t yet go so far as to call Malfoy slimy or evil, but he definitely had a wand up his arse about something.
It can’t be.
Potter is incoherent, his hand flying over his cock, his curses interspersed with Draco’s name, and it’s the best thing Draco has ever seen, most incredible, hottest, tightest,
Harry certainly tried. After Wednesday’s session, he strode determinedly northwards from St Mungo’s, dodging through Muggle tourists in Camden Market and climbing to the top of Primrose Hill, an hour’s walk from the Leaky Cauldron. He sat on the grass, the smells of Muggle summer picnics – tins of Pimm’s, M&S sandwiches and messily-rolled joints – drifting from the laughing people scattered around him. He ignored them and gazed over London, his eyes trying to pick out the grey-brick roof of the hospital, the familiar landmarks that surrounded the pub. He stayed there until the rumble of rush hour traffic built, then died. By the time a distant church bell rang eight o’clock, Harry was sure he’d managed to stay away. He was proud of himself.
“I’m trying not to kill you,” Harry grinds out.
Malfoy stood suddenly. A thrill trilled through Harry as Malfoy towered over him.
“Let me–” Potter says. He tugs at Draco’s shoulders, pulling him upwards. “God, you’re amazing, that was amazing, let me–”
“Well, fuck,” Malfoy says into the silence.
“Ah – Yes,” Malfoy said, not sounding like himself at all. “Absolutely. Same time as usual.”
“Understandable,” Harry says with a grin, and I need to close my eyes again at the look they give each other, heavy with affection. Once I’ve taken three deep, calming breaths, they’re both on their feet. Harry is pulling off his T-shirt; Malfoy is watching him appreciatively. I follow his gaze and evaluate Harry anew—I’ve seen him shirtless hundreds of times before, but I’ve never allowed myself to take the time to appreciate the play of muscles on his shoulders, the biteable peaks of his nipples, the inviting line of dark hair that trails beneath his waistband.
“Yeah,” I growl, tightening my grip. He’s going to have bruises tomorrow. I wonder if I’ll get to see them. I wonder if he’ll like it, being able to see the smudge of my thumb on his hipbone.
. It was the second time he’d said it. But Harry himself had been unable to think of Draco as
The dinner crowd came and went and the pub settled into mellow evening chatter. Harry had held up surprisingly well, he thought, but for the last hour, he had spent much more time staring than talking. Every now and then, Malfoy would meet his eyes and abruptly fall silent. Each time, warmth would pool in Harry’s stomach – then Malfoy would look away and continue as if nothing had happened, delivering wry observations in a voice slightly huskier than usual.
“Harry.” Draco opened his eyes. His swollen pupils were surrounded by a thin rim of stormy blue-grey. “Kiss me.”
“Ugh, me neither,” Malfoy says with an exaggerated shudder. Then he pauses and tilts his head. “Although—the one who works with dragons…”
Malfoy didn’t say anything. Slowly, he raised his hand. Harry watched, confused. Malfoy clicked his fingers.
Ever since Harry had learned about the War and his role in it, he’d been uncomfortably aware that he and his friends had fought and hid and mourned and killed before they had even finished school. Nobody else seemed to find that strange – not even Ron and Hermione. It felt almost silly to bring it up again.
The chamber echoed with applause and wolf-whistles, and all of Harry’s thoughts fled his brain. Draco was still holding Harry’s hand. He was watching Harry carefully.
Malfoy’s eyes flashed. “You might need it, but there’s not much I wouldn’t let you do to me.”
Draco is still pinned under me, but Harry seems to decide I’m not a threat. He exhales. Pulls his hand from under the pillow. Touches my arm.
He can’t have–
It was unbelievably good. If Harry’s brain were capable of thought, he’d struggle to find the right words to describe just how good it felt, fucking up into Malfoy, who had his hands splayed on Harry’s chest and who let out a noise of approval with every thrust. But Harry’s brain had entirely disengaged. He was operating on pure pleasure, his body completely in control, his only goal to get
“What you said. It’s okay if you didn’t mean it. People say stupid things during sex, I get it.”
Draco let out a loud, desperate noise and leaned into Harry’s hands. He tipped his head back again and gave himself over to Harry’s thrusts. Judging by Draco’s shuddering reactions, Harry had found the right angle. His legs burned with the effort of hitting it each time.
“Er, no,” Harry said, realising Hermione was still waiting for a response. “It’s fine. My head just feels … messy.”
Harry licks his lips. Both of them are staring.
“But even with the Pensieve, I would have seen something. The mental control that would take…”
The box definitely says thirty. Draco grabs the scroll of parchment and scans through the first page. Every mention of the time limit has it spelled out: T-H-I-R-T-Y. There’s no way he could be misreading. He looks over his shoulder to check that Potter is still there, and he’s startled to see Potter walking towards him, beautiful, naked, unselfconscious.
He stayed away from Draco for the next hour, though he couldn’t seem to stop his gaze following him as he worked the room. He was in his element, smirking and tossing his hair, obviously enjoying the attention. Not that Harry was managing to stay out of the limelight, himself. People were lining up to talk to him—and since nobody except Harry, Ron, Hermione, Robards and Draco knew about the truth about the contract (most of the guests seemed to assume it was a romantic gimmick), Harry had to endure several crushingly awkward conversations about how well-suited Harry and Draco were. Pomona Sprout spent ten tearful minutes telling Harry she had seen the spark between them all along and was so glad they’d finally realised it themselves. Then she asked whether Draco would be joining Harry at the castle when Harry resumed teaching.
Luna followed the direction of Harry’s gaze.
“Before that,” Harry says. He’s watching me carefully, all traces of sleep wiped away. His hand shot under the pillow when I moved—if I lift the elf-woven cotton and premium goose-feather, I know I’ll find his knuckles white around his wand. “I thought you got it. We didn’t mean— We didn’t mean just once. Remember? I said we wanted someone to keep Draco busy when I wasn’t in the mood.”
“Fuuuck,” Harry groaned, grabbing Draco’s hips and drinking in the sight of him. “Fuck.”
Curious, Harry crossed the room and sat in the wingback chair. “What does it say?”
Harry’s teeth sink into Malfoy’s flesh like a knife through butter, and he’s lost again, the luxury of Malfoy’s blood filling his mouth, dribbling down his chin. It’s so hot – it flows down his throat, burning through him – and he groans and digs his teeth deeper, sucks harder, drowns further. Malfoy’s pulse quickens, and he’s making low noises that vibrate against Harry’s skin. Harry can’t tell whether they’re noises of pain or pleasure. He doesn’t care either way. He just wants
The fourth tier had Harry sitting cross-legged outside a tent on a snowy landscape; Draco stood on the Manor grounds between two albino peacocks, a green smudge in the sky behind him.
Harry’s bedroom, achingly familiar even in the half-light of a late summer evening.
Prompt: storybook
—like an evening in a Central London park—and I’m hit with a wave of affection so aching that I nearly stumble from the strength of it.
Harry studied Malfoy’s face. “Do you not want to?”
Robards nodded. “A marriage contract.”
The dust continued to dance in the beam of light that separated them. Abruptly, Malfoy stood.
I didn’t want to be involved in it.”
“It’s likely it wasn’t even intentional. Perhaps you were under a lot of pressure, doing too much – Merlin knows not a day went by that you weren’t at some event or other – and your mind couldn’t cope with the stress. Perhaps your magic manifested a latent desire for a ‘normal life’. Perhaps you made a stupid wish on a shooting star. None of it would surprise me.”
His dismissal failed to get rid of her, but at least seemed to convince her he was sober—and somewhat sane. Harry was still frowning at the map—a complex puzzle of lines that no regular person could interpret, surely—but out of the corner of his eye, he saw her relax.
“A curse?” Harry said sharply. “Who could curse me? I’m at Hogwarts all the time. I’ve only been back in London since the beginning of the summer holidays. So, unless Flitwick’s finally had enough of seeing me around the castle…”
“But what if I get my memory back and – I dunno, what if I’m like Ron was? What if I’m a dick and I can’t get over the – the Death Eater thing? What if now is our only chance?”
“I know.” Harry circled a finger around Draco’s hole. “I want to do it this way. Is that okay?”
“Stop thinking about it,” Malfoy insisted, his disapproval rolling over Harry in cinnamon-spiced waves.
There’s an honest-to-god chandelier taking up the majority of the ceiling. I doubt Malfoy would appreciate the comparison, but the glints of its crystal droplets remind me of the disco balls in the tacky Muggle clubs that Harry and I got fucked up in every other night, those first few years after the war.
“So,” he said, pulling open the drawstring. “We kissed.”
Draco swallowed and, in a desperate attempt to regain control over the conversation, launched into an inane anecdote about Jinky, the house-elf assigned to the fourth floor at St Mungo’s. Potter watched him in that same unnervingly intense way, then eventually offered a story about his own elf’s unhealthy attachment to a portrait of Draco’s Great-Aunt Walburga. Their collective repertoire of elf-related banter carried them through dessert. It had been—something chocolaty, maybe. No—there had been strawberries. Or—some kind of mousse, perhaps?
“Like you and me,” Harry says. His hand makes it to Draco’s bony shoulder. He pauses, then decides, fuck it, it doesn’t seem like they’re here for Exploding Snap, and dips his fingers under the collar of Draco’s pyjama top. He has to step closer to reach the back of Draco’s neck, but he does, because he’s been thinking about burying his hand in that soft hair ever since their first dance. Draco blinks slowly, heavily.
“Fuck, you’re so
He tuts indulgently, as if I’m being intentionally silly but he didn’t expect anything better. “That you’re in love with him, obviously.”
By the evening, crumpled parchment covered the drawing room floor, Harry’s fingers were dotted with ink smudges in a way that tugged oddly at his chest, and he was no closer to finding the words he wanted.
“No.” Harry slumped into the wingback chair. The golden gleam of sunlight on Malfoy’s hair hurt his eyes.
, of Dean laughing till he cried at Seamus’s attempt at breakdancing, at Ginny and George’s straight-faced formal dance to an incredibly upbeat song that seemed to be called
’? Hermione, it’s a miracle we’ve kept it out of the news for this long.”
Harry.
“You know, you can buy those anywhere,” Malfoy says, nodding to the shirt. “It is much nicer than the rags you usually wear, but it’s hardly out of your price range. There’s no need to salivate over it like that.”
“On your knees, Malfoy,” Harry says again, and the melodious note dances through his words. A visible shiver runs down Malfoy’s spine. He gathers his hands and knees under himself and straightens his arms. His shoulder blades flex.
He ignores me and wraps his hand around my half-hard dick.
Draco made a noise somewhere between pleasure and impatience. “Of course I love you, you stupid fuck. Of
“On three?” Draco murmured.
Malfoy cleared his throat. “It’s not uncommon to consider a repeated Legilimency connection to be an intimate experience,” he said, visibly struggling to summon his usual professional manner.
“Oh, yes,
“Outrageous!” Harry eyes the drinks. “So you got a porn star martini instead?”
“Yeah.”
. But as Draco relaxes and Harry gains speed, I can’t stop my hips from bucking upwards.
Malfoy whines – he’s so eager, so pliant – and Harry is consumed by him. He’s desperate to sink his teeth into Malfoy, but sinks his cock in instead, pulling out and fucking forwards, hard. Malfoy lets out a cry – the kiss breaks and Malfoy’s head falls back onto Harry’s shoulder – his hand rises to grip the back of Harry’s neck. It’s good – it presses them together, stretches Malfoy out so Harry can run his hand down Malfoy’s chest. The scars he’s given Malfoy are raised bumps under his fingers. The zigzag of
“Yes,” Malfoy said from somewhere beyond the walls of the room. “Very good. Can you describe the space for me?”
“There you go.” Malfoy looked down his nose. “Now you know you’ve walked through a ghost, eaten Gillyweed and held a Quaffle and a crystal ball. Is that what you wanted?”
Draco laughs hoarsely, wildly, and kisses him again. Potter’s mouth is perfect, addicting, and Draco loses himself in it, Potter melting into him, his fingers cold on Draco’s jaw. Potter’s nose presses against Draco’s, and Draco is fascinated by the thought of it –
Tom did a double-take so big it was almost comical, but Harry wasn’t in a laughing mood. “Mister Potter!” he said, his smirk untwisting into a welcoming smile. “No, sir, no problem at all. What can I get you? Any drink for you is on the house.”
“I was hoping to revisit the concept of a mental space today. Have you managed to envisage a place you are comfortable with?”
“I’m here. Fuck, I’m here, I’m right here—”
But then someone
“What?” Draco blinks at him, his fingers digging into Harry’s side. His pupils are wide, his mouth dark and swollen. “You’re not changing your mind, are you?”
is the best thing you could ever see. My hips jerk forwards helplessly. My cock catches on the inside of Harry’s cheek.
I gape as Malfoy drags a spluttering Harry to the large fireplace at the back of the pub. I’d assumed this was the sort of thing we’d head into together, but I suppose I can’t blame Malfoy if he wants to talk to Harry privately first—Merlin knows this was sprung on him. It was certainly sprung on me.
The praise flowed over him and Harry shivered – then shivered again when he realised that Malfoy could see what his words did to him. He held the pounding rhythm steady in his mind.
Draco had assumed that he’d kept his covert ogling of Potter over the last few months to a minimum, but now he’s not so sure: Potter’s chest is almost as familiar as Potter’s face. The dusky nipples, the scar on his sternum, the dark line of hair trailing downwards – Draco already knows it intimately, has already imagined how it would feel, how Potter’s nipple would harden under his thumb, how his stomach muscles would tense as Draco’s hand trailed downwards, what the hitch of his breath would sound like as Draco’s fingers followed the line of hair to the buttons of his trousers.
“Prick,” Harry said easily. “And outside of with patients?”
A flash of lightning. A rumble of thunder. The storm was getting closer.
Harry braced himself. A few tense breaths later, he unclenched. He counted to five, waiting. A breeze passed over him from the open window. He shivered.
Until he turned seventeen, Harry’s birthdays were a day like any other – a day spent alone in his room, ignored by the Dursleys. More than once, Harry had forgotten his birthday altogether, only to have the disconcerting realisation at some point in early August that he’d aged another year without noticing.
“I want,” Draco says, but he’s mumbling, his voice loose and languid. “Another time. Right now m’sleep.”
Malfoy noticed. For a moment, he looked like he had in the Leaky Cauldron: wild, wanting. “Merlin. Yes. I can’t begin to tell you what I–” He shook his head. “But it’s not – I shouldn’t like it. You don’t remember who I am–”
“Well, yeah.”
Draco makes an indignant noise. I ignore it.
“This is normal,” Malfoy said, his voice cutting through Harry’s increasingly frantic thoughts. “Gently guide yourself back to the moments after you first woke up.”
Harry lunged across the table to drag Malfoy into the searing kiss that hung between them, but Malfoy slid out of the booth and through his fingers like smoke. The
Malfoy ended the spell.
“—and there are definitely times when it’s weird. His mum came round while I was at his flat the other day. Turns out, it’s awkward, trying to come up with something to say to the person who lied to Voldemort for me, but who is also still married to the bloke who tried to murder me on multiple occasions.”
“Please,” I whimper, but I forgot how much Malfoy likes that; he breaks the kiss to take me in his mouth again, and I moan, unable to stop pushing my hips forwards. He takes it so well, squeezing my arse encouragingly and closing his eyes in apparent enjoyment as I fuck his throat—tentatively at first, but when neither of them complain, quicker. Harder. More uncontrolled. Oh, fuck.
“Morning,” Harry said. He sat in the wingback chair and smiled at Malfoy. “How are you today?”
Malfoy gazed at him helplessly.
“Fuck him. I want you.” If the tightening of his grip was any indication, Malfoy caught the double meaning.
He’s got his hands on the waistband of my boxers and his face less than a foot from my straining erection. At this point, it must be obvious that I’m absolutely fucking sure.
“Are you kidding? It was bloody brilliant.” The grin took over Harry’s face again. “Never been so excited to see plants. At least, I don’t think I have.”
Harry cast around for something to say to clarify the situation, but his thoughts were racing too fast to pick out anything coherent. Instead, he nodded at the ribbons. “Slytherin colours?”
“Fuck, sorry,” Harry said. The Leaky Cauldron vanished and Harry saw Malfoy across the desk, his eyebrows pulled together in concentration, before they were back in the Garden.
-reading sycophants’, you called them.”
Harry laughed. It came out strained. “Longer than ten seconds,” he assured Malfoy. “I’ve barely thought about anything else all afternoon.”
In November, the Aurors found out what had happened to him. Harry had expected the discovery to be a comfort.
Draco looked at him through his eyelashes. Having him change the colour of the ribbons had been a mistake. He was unbelievably gorgeous. He was Harry’s favourite person, wrapped in Harry’s favourite colours. “But?”
“Yeah.” Malfoy pushes back onto Harry’s finger. It slides in easily.
“Listen,” Harry said, “let’s go outside for a minute. Have a little break. It’s so loud.”
Draco had thought about what Harry would be like in bed. Harry glowed. “What did you think I’d be like?”
“Can we get back to working with your mental space now?”
“Do you want us to send him a message?” Hermione’s anxious face hovered in his peripheral vision. “I’m sure he’d like to know you’re awake. He was obviously worried.”
Harry waited, his heart thumping. “Do you want to?”
Harry was so busy taking in Malfoy that he had almost forgotten where he was or why they were there. It came back to him suddenly and unpleasantly when a wizard at the front of the chamber that Harry had overlooked cleared his throat. He was small and tufty-haired, and it took Harry a moment to place him. When he did, his stomach lurched again. The officiant.
“Oh, for fuck’s sake.” Harry was definitely supposed to hear that time. “Will you just get back in here?” There was a beat. “Unless you don’t want to?”
“You’ve had me for a week and all you’ve done is make me sit around for hours making up imaginary rooms and doors and bloody cardboard boxes. What’s the point?”
Draco squeezed his eyes shut. Fuck.
“Puddlemere, then. They’ve really leaned into the ‘Wood’ branding, I’ve heard. Oliver’s quite good-looking. Very intense.”
Then the letter came.
“You haven’t – I’m sure you haven’t failed anyone!” He reached out a hand to pat Kreacher on the back, then thought better of it. “There, there,” he said helplessly. He only had four hours of memories; there was not much he felt qualified to do. Consoling a howling house-elf was definitely not within his skillset.
“I’m gonna come,” Malfoy gasps, his stomach tightening, his body curling around Harry’s head. “I’m gonna come, fuck, I’m – I’m gonna–”
Harry has just enough presence of mind to ask, strained, “Can I bite?”
is still up, “to tell you the truth, mate—he’s exhausting.”
Malfoy’s face went blank – not in the usual careful way where he withdrew behind a veneer of polite professionalism. No, he looked as if all his emotions had been shocked out of him.
Malfoy’s professional mask had lapsed entirely. Harry hoped he would never see it again.
Harry blinked. This, too, was different.
“‘Petty teenage rivalries’?” Harry repeated. “So … what? We weren’t pals with him in school? Was he better than you in the official Hogwarts chess rankings or something?”
“Ah, he’s – not really my type.”
Malfoy sneered and opened his mouth, then closed it again abruptly. He took a deep breath and laced his fingers together. “I understand that it must be disappointing not to have the answers you’re looking for,” he said. “But what happened to you may be irrelevant.”
Ron leant forwards. “Slimy? Untrustworthy? Evil?”
Malfoy glanced over at Ron and Hermione and raised an eyebrow. “Granger continues to spout wisdom in a subject she has zero training in, I see.”
Harry laughed. “No, that’s not – you dick. I’m not asking if you’ll be my Healer. That’s the last thing I want.”
“But if I stopped being your patient?”
“Very good,” Malfoy murmured, that same pleased note in his voice. “One more.”
“You’re incredible.” Draco means it. It’s probably his last chance to say it.
, on his knees on a four-poster bed with ribbons wrapped around the whole length of him, circling his neck, winding down his arms, tying his wrists behind his back, twisting down each thigh, binding his ankles, and, worst of all, looping around the base of his erection, which stood hard and proud from a neat bow of green and silver.
Harry forced Malfoy’s head back further. A suggestion of a whimper escaped Malfoy’s throat, yet still he made no move to struggle. God, why was this turning Harry on so much? It was hardly the first time he’d interrogated a suspect off the record, and it had certainly never affected him in this way before.
Harry had never Splinched himself before, and for a long second, he was confused why his appearance had caused an outbreak of horrified screaming instead of the usual whispers and stares. He looked down at himself—at most of himself. As if it had been waiting for his brain to catch up, pain abruptly flooded through him. Harry inhaled sharply, once, and collapsed on the spot.
Draco, by contrast, is finally quiet. His eyes are glassy and his hair is sticking to his forehead in sweaty strands. He’s gasping, shivering, jerking with each thrust, his fist moving rapidly up and down his cock.
And now he was in Harry’s bed, and Harry was twitching his hips towards Draco’s mouth, and Draco swallowed him down without a second thought.
Draco’s gaze sharpened. He looked like the proper Draco again – clever, capable, baffled by the depths of Harry’s stupidity. “Harry,” he said. “I got naked and tied myself up and offered myself to you. I might enjoy a light-hearted tease every now and again, but my commitment to a joke would not stretch this far, I assure you.”
Visions of a long, luxurious afternoon spent with Malfoy vanished as quickly as they had appeared. But tomorrow – tomorrow was okay. Tomorrow was more than okay.
Summoning the visuals of a fantasy through Legilimency is one thing; replicating physical sensation is entirely another. Draco severely underestimated those ostentatious Weasley twins. Twin.
Harry did – and found it to be full of blurred scribbles, only the occasional phrase –
He needs to escape, needs to
Grimacing, Harry took his time making his way to the staircase. He had been to Draco’s house a few times, but had never managed to have a good look around. He examined the stack of old newspapers on the sideboard, ran his finger over the edge of an ornate-framed mirror, and came to a halt beside the coat stand. He recognised every cloak, hat and scarf that hung from it.
“Well,” Potter said, abashed. “I mean, to be fair, I didn’t have much else going on at the time. And you had to learn it by yourself, whereas I had…such a good teacher.”
Malfoy’s head jerked up. He stared at Harry.
” Did Malfoy know what that refined fucking accent casting those spells did to him?
Draco made a small noise of agreement. He held on to Harry’s biceps, the muscles flexing beneath his palms, as Harry continued to touch him, all over. His back. His shoulders. His face.
“How kind of him!” Healer Brisley beamed. “I’m sure he’ll pop along for a quick visit later. Now, I’ll just give you a mo to get changed into something comfy, then we’ll get you all set up.” She wiggled her fingers and left.
He was Harry.

.” His words were swallowed by a gasp as Harry grabbed his chin and aimed his wand. Malfoy’s neck moved against Harry’s fingers as he swallowed.
Harry’s fixed smile became a grimace. He was sick to death of having Diagnostic Charms cast on him.
“Let me–” Harry steadied him, held him still, and fucked upwards properly – a long, deep stroke that made them both moan.
Harry’s embarrassment returned. He dropped his gaze. “So I’ll, er, see you tomorrow? Same time as usual?”
“Cast the spells,” Harry said. “The ones you did last time. I’m going to fuck you.” He started to strip, undoing the buttons of his robe, his eyes on his wand held loosely in Malfoy’s hand, on Malfoy’s slack-jawed expression. “If you don’t cast them soon I’ll fuck you without them,” he warned, and took off his shirt.
“But I want to,” Potter said, suddenly intense. “Draco. I really,
. Harry had a warm, sugar-scented mind and an easy grin. Harry told Draco he was brilliant, and fiercely defended him against the mildest of insults—even if those insults were from his dearest friends. Harry was obstinate, and strong-willed, and sometimes looked at Draco as if he wanted to devour him.
Harry growled in frustration. “One,” he said aloud, turning to the first door in his mind. “Two. Three. Four–”
“It’s a term Muggles used to use to mean potions,” Hermione said quietly, mindful of the curly-haired Muggle. She led the way through the unassuming iron gate. Harry glanced at the man and his soft-looking hair again before following. “The blurred line between what they call medicine and what we call potions is fascinating – especially in the past. Not so much now, of course.”
Ron gaped. With his mouth open and his ears as red as they were, he looked like a fish with bright red fins. “And you’re all right with that?” he demanded.
Malfoy looked at him, turning his head but not the rest of him. His face looked as tired as Harry felt, but his movements betrayed no signs of fatigue when he came closer to Harry. A bit too close, actually. He reached up to touch the fabric of the robe covering Harry’s chest.
“Wait, don’t say anything,” Potter interrupted. “Because you always do that with your hands when you’re trying to keep me out and I just want to make sure you’re clear on where I stand.”
“Hm?” It took a moment for Hermione’s words to make sense. “Oh – no. We didn’t actually do any Mind Magic.”
“Good job,” Draco said, only lightly mocking.
It wasn’t that Ginny didn’t understand. It was just that she was being logical about it, which Harry couldn’t bring himself to do. Sirius hadn’t even liked it here, she would say. He’d hated it as a child and he’d hated it as an adult. He of all people wouldn’t have wanted Harry to be cooped up here as Sirius himself had been. He of all people would have wanted Harry to be happy.

Malfoy shrank away from him. “I really don’t know what you’re talking about!” He fumbled for the letter and scanned the first few lines. “What is this? I don’t understa…” The colour drained from his face. He looked up, eyes wide. “No,” he said hoarsely.

It was startling the difference a day had made to Malfoy’s physique (all the more reason to suspect foul play, Harry told himself). He was still visibly too thin, faint shadows under his eyes and smudges of bruises across his torso and along his arms. Yet he seemed somehow more alive, his skin more vibrant, his hair brighter. Perhaps it was merely the way he held himself: surer, more confident – despite being tied up and naked and looking up at Harry with that sinful mouth caught halfway between a gasp and a smirk.
“Harry…”
“Fuck, please,” he says when Draco lines himself up with shaking hands.
Malfoy swore softly and shook his head. “It was a mistake,” he said firmly. “All of it. I’m really very sorry. Truly.”
“No!” Harry yelped. The fantasy of pulling Malfoy across the table into a deep kiss replayed in his mind. Ron and Hermione raised their eyebrows. Harry cleared his throat, his face heating. “I mean, er – nah,” he said with forced casualness. “I don’t really fancy pub food. How about Indian?”
Harry looked into Malfoy’s desperate eyes, felt the echo of Earl Grey curl through his mind, and nodded.
“It was so good,” Harry says. “And we can always— We can always do more stuff another time. If you want.”
Draco flops an arm over my stomach without opening his eyes. “Don’t you dare,” he mumbles.
Harry must be dreaming. It was the only explanation. Someone must have slipped him some kind of – Fantasy Potion. Or perhaps he’d been hit with a Hallucination Hex. Because this couldn’t be real. It couldn’t be. He’d wanted Draco for years. This
“Exactly,” Draco said softly.
Ron looked up, caught sight of Harry and waved him over.
“A marriage contract,” Harry repeated. “With… With my name on it.”
But the mirror remained motionless, and Malfoy’s once-wintry voice was weary when he whirled to Harry and said, “So, to summarise, Susan was sitting in a Southend shoe shop, Seamus was selling seashells by the Southend seashore. Where were you positioned in all this?”
It was unbearably warm in Grimmauld Place. For the seventh day in a row, Harry found himself hunched over his desk, the room lit only by the dusk sky through the grubby window. It was summer, and it shouldn’t be fully dark outside for another hour yet. But Grimmauld Place was always somehow darker and drearier than the rest of the world.
“– was completely self-centred, I don’t know what I was–”
Harry shrugged. Truthfully, it was about shutting his friends up. “Depends how good you are at your job.”
The words barely penetrate the fog of bloodlust, but the metallic tang of fear on Harry’s tongue pierces through. He wrenches himself away.
“You mean … the bed?” he tried. Perhaps Draco would have found it funny to gift Harry a bed that he’d just had a festive wank on. Maybe he just hadn’t finished in time, maybe he expected Harry to linger more on his journey upstairs. Or, shit, maybe he had someone else here. Maybe–
Nothing happens.
?” Harry repeated, nonplussed. Draco snickered. Harry couldn’t identify why the sound was strange, for a second—and then he realised: Harry had never made Draco laugh before. He was so used to Draco’s snicker being malevolent, accompanied by eyes alight with malice and a cutting remark. He much preferred the soft sound of uncomplicated amusement. He wanted to hear it again.
“That will be all for today.”
“Nah,” he says eventually, and grins. “But if it’s all right with you…I’d love to watch.”
Harry hadn’t given Narcissa Malfoy much thought, other than resenting her for signing their lives away. It hadn’t occurred to him that Draco might feel differently—might actually have wanted her here, if she were still alive.
Harry remembered the sudden appearance of his first erection in months. He opened his mouth, then remembered exactly what thoughts had prompted said erection. He closed his mouth again.
“Oh, nothing. Just—Well.” She shot him a smirk. “They’re the exact same shade as your eyes. Did you notice?”
I nod.
“Potter.” The sound of Draco’s snapping fingers dragged Harry’s attention from the parchment. “Are you listening? I said, are you nearly ready to go?”
Draco whines. Merlin, it’s all he can do not to shove his cock back in Potter’s mouth and fuck his throat to completion. It wouldn’t take long. But then what would they do for the next fifteen minutes? Cuddle?
Malfoy glared. “No kissing,” he said eventually.
Unlike Harry, there’s no softness or sweetness to Malfoy. He pushes me against the wall and shoves a knee between my legs. His teeth bite at my lip and his nails dig into my shoulders. But I find myself meeting the challenge of his sharpness: I yank him closer, scrape a hand through his stupid pretty hair and
The orange-pink of the twilight sky lit up the small, sharp curve of Malfoy’s smile. His gaze dropped downwards, then back up again. A door slammed somewhere in the distance.
Draco makes a small, pained noise as the second finger slides inside. Harry stills, but Draco says, “No, I’m good, it’s good. Don’t stop until I say so.”
“I told you, I’m an adult, there’s nothing wrong with–”
“Oh,” he said faintly.
“Some people call it that,” Malfoy said, his nose in the air. “I myself don’t like to consider it a branch of Healing. ‘Healing’ implies a single, discrete cure. As I’m sure you’re aware, the brain is a little more complex than that.”
Malfoy allows Harry to guide the phial to his mouth. Almost immediately, a pink flush colours his cheeks. Harry eyes it with interest, but the urge to
There are hands on my ankles.
That is not what I expected to hear. I prop myself up on my elbows to stare at him. “What?”
He took a deep breath, prepared for more frustration and bewilderment, but this time, the differences stood out easily. The comforting aroma of hot food and mead usually filled the pub; right now, Harry could smell the same floral scent from the Quidditch pitch – which he realised was also what he’d taken to be an Air-Freshening Charm in the library. The large fireplace, the main thoroughfare for witches and wizards on their way to Diagon Alley, usually burned constantly; even in winter, the room had always been warm and stuffy. Just then, in Malfoy’s mind, it was pleasantly cool.
“Don’t force it.” Harry reached out to Malfoy’s cool presence instinctively and the image of the reception held, though it shimmered at the edges like it wasn’t quite in tune. “Good,” Malfoy said. “Let your thoughts flow back to where you want them to be. Are you ready? Try again.”
,” he had said.
“You’re going to come again,” he hears himself growl. “But not until I tell you to.”
“How did you get into the field? It can’t have been easy.”
“Go and invite him over, Harry,” she said firmly. “I’ll talk to Ron.”
Right from the beginning, Harry had been fascinated by the mystery of Malfoy, had devoured every detail he could learn about him, but this was different. His pounding headache was suddenly almost audible in the silence of the room.
“Look, can someone just go to his office and get him? It’s literally five minutes away.”
“Hurry up,” Draco demands.
Harry waved a hand. “Yeah, I get that bit,” he said. “It’s what’s inside that’s not making sense. It’s a—a contract, you said?” He looked at Robards for confirmation.
Given what he knew of their history, Harry didn’t quite know how to take that. “So that’s a … yes?”
Malfoy’s dick was no less appealing now it was unclothed. Harry gave it a few experimental strokes, amazed at how hard Malfoy was already, at the velvety feel of his skin. Malfoy was propped up on his elbows, looking down at him – his ribs were more prominent than they should have been. Harry’s eyes traced the silvery scars zigzagging Malfoy’s torso, and he raised an eyebrow when he felt Malfoy’s dick twitch in response.
Despite his best efforts, Harry is swept away. He does what he can, fights to keep his body frozen, but he can’t stop himself from opening his mouth for more. Can’t stop himself from loosening one arm so his hand can rise to Malfoy’s waist, push up his shirt and rest – just rest, but trembling from the effort of it – against the soft skin of Malfoy’s hip.
“I think so.”
Healer Malfoy conjured a chair a reasonable distance from them and sat in it stiffly. A strange silence settled. Harry didn’t mind being the one to break it.
“Hermione,” Harry whined.
“I see,” he said bitterly. The pounding in his head seemed to intensify. “You’re constantly holding yourself back from hexing me, is that it?”
Harry couldn’t tell whether Malfoy had known or not. Was he just surprised Harry had been bold enough to say something? Harry found he didn’t care. Either way, he was glad Malfoy knew now. He was glad he’d brought it up.
“What are you playing at, Malfoy?”
The end of the night drew closer, and eventually the pub started clearing significantly enough that it was obvious it was time to leave. Harry didn’t want the night to end, and took his time straightening the still-damp menus and brushing imaginary crumbs from the table once they had stood to go.
“Is this okay?” Harry paused, but Draco was already nodding furiously.
“Yes,” Potter says. “Yes, god, yes–”
“Your magic, Harry,” she said. A quiver in her voice betrayed her. “The Healers ran checks on you after they fixed you up to make sure nothing was amiss. Your magic is a quarter of what it should be.”
There was heat in Malfoy’s cool gaze. “Harry.”
“Me too,” Harry said. “What is the point, though?”
“Not at all,” Draco lied stiffly. Fuck,
Malfoy, damn him, whimpers and melts against me. I remember Harry saying
Harry batted Ron away as he reached over again. “Thanks,” he said. “I’ll let you know.”
“I’m not putting your dick in my mouth while you’re kneeling up like that. What do you think I am, a flobberworm? I have a spine, you know.”
Harry waited, determinedly keeping his eyes away from Malfoy’s neckline, but Malfoy didn’t finish his sentence.
God, he missed the castle so much it burned. If marrying Malfoy was what it took to be able to go back, was that really so bad? They’d already lived together for weeks—apparently—and Harry had barely seen him. Was waking up to the sound of the shower really such a big price to pay?
. Except it actually
wonderful.”
“Oh, I didn’t expect you for another hour.” He straightened and walked towards Harry, who was rooted to the spot, shaking in fury, the letter still clutched in his hand. Malfoy hesitated, halting five feet away from him. “Hey… What’s wrong?”
Ron snapped back at her, and they began to bicker about privacy spells and press releases.
Malfoy took a shaky breath. “Merlin, I can’t believe – your mental control really has improved tremendously. You didn’t – deviate from the theme once. That’s – That’s good.” The dichotomy of the formal words spilling from his mouth while he looked at Harry with such dark, hot intensity made Harry, impossibly, even harder.
– in that strained, breathy voice – would have. It took everything – everything – to stop his hips jerking upwards at the words. It took everything not to swear and let instinct take over and bury himself deep in Draco’s body.
“You managed a few hours then?” Malfoy’s tone was derisive, but he seemed mildly mollified. “I’m impressed.”
“Erm,” he said.
, and those jeans show it off in a way she’d probably be embarrassed about, if she knew. She always thought I was being polite, when I told her how sexy she was. Funny, isn’t it, how clever people can be so stupid about themselves.
Harry stared. He didn’t untangle his fingers from Malfoy’s hair. Slowly, he lifted his hand, and Malfoy’s head went with it, his mouth sliding luxuriously up the length of Harry’s cock. When Malfoy’s lips were wrapped around just the tip, Harry paused. This would be the perfect time to stop. Harry took a deep breath. Malfoy’s taunting eyes met his. His tongue slid around the head of Harry’s cock.
Harry had easily called up his mental space—there was no pounding now, and the fifth door hung serenely open, the same size as the other four. But Draco didn’t have a chance to comment on the change; with easy control, Harry guided them into a memory, and the quiet stone room smoothly transformed into the reception area of St Mungo’s. Potter—in Auror robes—stood by the fireplace, talking to miserable old Healer Morgan. The details of the conversation itself were muffled—not because Harry’s mental control wasn’t up to scratch, but because at the time, Potter hadn’t been paying Healer Morgan the slightest bit of attention.
into Harry’s mouth. It’s euphoric, unlike anything Harry ever felt when he was human, and it tips him over the edge too; his grip tightens and he’s growling, forcing his dick as deep as he can, filling Malfoy with his come while Malfoy’s blood fills his mouth, his throat, his body.
“Where’s your elf?” Harry asked.
Harry stepped closer. Kneeling on the bed as he was, Draco was half a head shorter than him. His face was tilted up, his eyes fixed on Harry.
“Ron told me. He said you’d both find it funny, I hope he wasn’t having me on…?” Molly looked at Draco too. Her smile faltered.
“Absolutely you did,” Draco said, and Harry’s face fell. “I’ve had a constant hard-on ever since. I haven’t been comfortable in weeks.”
Harry opened his mouth to reply. A knock on the door interrupted him.
Potter’s brow furrowed and Draco knew he was reacting instinctively, sensing a hero moment. He tried to cut it off with a hasty, “No, stop, you don’t need to—” but Potter was too quick.
“God, Draco,” Harry said. He scrubbed a hand through his hair. “I’ve wanted you for weeks. Longer, maybe.” He remembered the time he’d invited Malfoy back to Grimmauld Place, the way he’d wanted to spend more time with him but hadn’t quite understood why. He remembered the way the dark-eyed stranger had intrigued Harry, until he’d noticed Malfoy and everything else had fallen away. He remembered the pull towards Malfoy, the desperate urge to be closer, when he was lit up and breathless after their duel. Harry might not have realised at the time, but he had wanted Malfoy from the beginning.
Harry could barely hear anything else. It echoed around them, the thud of flesh on flesh, of a bedframe on a wall, a pulsing, throbbing,
Harry just looks at me.
The scene shifted. Harry’s eyes caught Malfoy immediately – how could they not – but it took him a moment to identify himself. He was dressed in Auror robes, and was shoving a smirking Malfoy against the wall of a bedroom he didn’t recognise. Malfoy lifted his chin imperiously and Harry growled and tore open Malfoy’s trousers. Malfoy jerked his hips and Harry dove his hand inside Malfoy’s underwear. Another growl, and Harry surged forwards, dipping his head to kiss and bite and suck at Malfoy’s neck. Malfoy moaned and tipped his head to the side. He dug his fingers into Harry’s hair, holding him in place.
The pounding of Harry’s heartbeat twined with the pounding on the door. Six months. He was really doing this.
He wouldn’t get to pick someone. He wouldn’t get to propose. He wouldn’t get to plan a perfect future with his favourite person. He’d just have…Malfoy.
Harry took a deep breath. He remembered the stillness, the peace, the owl at his window. The letter from Hermione – the hundreds of other letters he’d received over the last few months. The Head Auror asking him whether he could make a few appearances. People thanking him, criticising him, asking him for help. Foreign dignitaries requesting his presence at events and parties and conferences. Pages and pages and pages from St Mungo’s –
Harry didn’t feel he quite deserved Malfoy’s disapproval. “I did try!” he protested. “But then I, er … I fell asleep.”
Harry blinks up at me. “What? Right now? Draco just got here.”
“Was there something in particular that prompted this, Harry?” Hermione asked innocently.
“Is that you, Pansy?”
“You were right,” he said. “I’m really sorry about yesterday.”
“Are you ready to get started?”
“I’m ruined,” Harry breathed, dazed in the aftermath of his own ire.
“Yeah,” Harry said, dragging his eyes up to Malfoy’s solemn face. “Sure, yeah, of course.”
“So who exactly is he, this Malfoy?” Harry asked, struggling to keep up. “He seemed fine in Brisley’s office. A little … I dunno…”
“You never said anything about dancing!”
“You don’t sound sure.”
.” Hermione jabbed her wand at the Patronus; it hissed and fled. “Come on, then,” she said to Harry. “It’ll be over soon.”
It was the catch in Draco’s voice, more than his words, that made Harry straighten and open the door. He peered around the wood, one hand gripping the snake-head doorknob.
There was a dingy cupboard door towards the back of the kitchen. He turned to it wearily; he had been through four floors of drawers and cupboards and hadn’t yet found anything useful. Without hope, he grabbed the handle and yanked it open.
“Ask Malfoy what?” Ron stomped in from the garden, his boots trailing mud over the worn wooden floor. Harry couldn’t tell whether his ears were red from anger or from too much sun.
“Draco—”
I’m so caught up in Harry, it’s almost a surprise to hear Malfoy say, “I can’t believe how much this is turning me on.”
“We have Earl Grey, if you want it?” Hermione offered, standing on her tiptoes to reach the tea shelf. “I noticed you started drinking it.”
There was a heavy silence as Harry tried to make sense of the words.
Harry watched dispassionately as Tom disappeared into the back room. A murmur of conversation ignited around them.
“Sure,” he said.
“You’re so impatient, Potter,” Draco said softly, an indulgent emphasis on Harry’s surname. “It’s very sexy, you know.” And, with no further warning, he lifted himself up and slid down again with a low moan.
“Excellent,” Malfoy said, eyes glinting. “That’s very promising.”
“Dunno. You’d have to ask Malfoy.”
“You’re fucked up,” Harry told him.
“Unbelievable,” Malfoy muttered. He laced his long fingers together. “Fine, yes, let’s get to it. I want you to close your eyes and focus on your breathing. When you’re ready, visualise your mental space.”
“Malfoy,” he gasped, hands gripping Malfoy’s thighs.
“‘Harry’ is fine,” Harry said. “Are you sure we never…?”
He picks the wand up now. It feels uncertain in his hand – has done ever since he got it back, but the thought of getting a new one is hysterical. Where would he go? Ollivanders?
“Oh, you
Draco blinked. “No,” he said, confused into honesty. “I haven’t been here before.”
“Ah.”
“Mother of Merlin,” the real Malfoy breathed.
Another strange look. Did Harry have something on his face? He lifted a hand to his mouth to check.
“Speaking of owls,” he said, picking a sheet of parchment off his desk and brandishing it, “I received this bizarre missive last night. Something to do with you?”
“Okay,” Malfoy said. They were still holding hands. “Okay, yes.”
“Fuck, you’re so big,” Draco said, voice strained. He sunk down another inch. “You – Harry, you’re inside me. God, you feel so good.”
“Jesus,” present-Harry said. “Really – I’m really sorry, I can’t stop it.”
That first morning had been the worst, although not initially. He’d woken up and everything had been … peaceful. He hadn’t known where he was, or who he was, or why he should care. There was just the bright sound of birds through the window and the soft brush of cotton sheets against his skin. He hummed contentedly and blinked lazily at the ceiling. It felt like he was floating.
The officiwizard cleared his throat. “You can let go now,” he said kindly. “Look, the bind has gone. The ritual is over.”
it, one hand wrapped around the base of Draco’s cock, sucking and licking and slurping and driving Draco wild.
Scuttleby puffed up. “Why, thank you very much, Mr…?”
Harry grinned. “Coffee and sugar. Your two favourite things.” It was strange that he remembered Draco’s fondness for both, but he knew it as certainly as if someone had told him that very morning. “You’ll love it. Come on.”
The moment stretches, an endless high. Until Malfoy sags, and Harry dimly realises that Malfoy is quieter, that his skin has become cooler, clammier.
. The pinpricks of Harry’s teeth that litter Malfoy’s whole body. Punctuation marks of ownership.
“You don’t have to,” Harry said quickly. “But it’s just—fuck, you feel so good, in my head. The thought of you inside me, in every way…” He shivered.
I was wrong before: the sight of two people
“He’s not in charge, then?”
– legible.
Harry brandished the parchment. Draco focused on it, his eyebrows knitted together. Then he paled.
Draco shrugged in agreement, but he lowered his eyes. “My point is, that was the first time I thought you didn’t hate me. It was the first time I thought that maybe – one day, if all the stars aligned, I might have a chance with you.”
Potter pulls away and peers anxiously at him. “Hang on. You’re not – Someone hasn’t slipped you a love potion or anything, have they?”
“That’s not what I meant.”
The door opened to reveal an unfamiliar man – though that went without saying, these days – in neat grey robes. He was rather pointy, and almost colourless; pale skin, pale hair, pale eyes. He was also much younger than most of the Healers Harry had dealt with thus far. He couldn’t have been that much older than Harry himself.
“If you’re sure that you’re sure.”
“Don’t worry,” Malfoy said, his voice soft in Harry’s mind, but the image in front of them shifted again – the Leaky Cauldron.
“I dunno,” Harry said. “I dunno who I’d be with them back.” He could still feel their kiss on his lips, in the echo of Malfoy’s thumbprints on his jaw. It hurt to think that it might be their only one.
“You’re such a good kisser,” Draco breathed, pushing himself into Harry’s fist. “Look what you did to me.”
Malfoy studied him for a long moment, his eyes narrowed. Then, abruptly, he said, “What is the name of the ghost of Gryffindor Tower?”
He dragged himself out of bed and stumbled straight to the shower. The shock of cold water was refreshing after his long, sweaty night. He scrubbed at his stomach and chest, allowing his heavy eyes to fall closed. He had tried, in his more lucid moments, to keep on top of the night’s grime, but there was only so much a
“One kiss.”
The bed in the spare room was cold and uninviting.
touching my cock—a warm, slick hand strokes me confidently from root to tip. I choke on my mouthful and jerk my head backwards. It collides painfully with the headboard.
Malfoy’s impassive mask flickered. “If you’re sure, the sooner the better,” he said. “The noise in your head is still very strong. But we don’t know how long that will last. We can’t risk delaying, not at this stage.” His eyes were bright. He was still so pale.
Walburga Black’s shrieking, spitting portrait flashed to the forefront of Harry’s mind. He would have preferred it if that memory had stayed lost.
Harry sat up straighter. Apart from the Thestral revelation in his first session, most of Harry’s memories were still as absent as they had been two months ago. Given the accolades that Malfoy had (Hermione had shown him pages and pages of Malfoy’s Mind Magic achievements while Ron sputtered protests in the background), Harry had expected to have made a bit more progress by now.
“I had lunch with my friends yesterday,” Harry said, when Malfoy didn’t say anything else.
“Of course I – Oh god, yeah, do that again –
Something in Malfoy’s condescending tone dug fingers into Harry’s chest and wrenched his poorly controlled frustration out through his mouth.
Ron appeared to have been thinking along the same lines. “What’s up with you?” he asked her, looking up from the Detonator for the first time.
Malfoy met his eyes unflinchingly. “Yes, I had a trial. And I went through the same ethics tests as every other person in a Healing-adjacent field. My scores are in the public domain in St Mungo’s Research Library, if you’d like to see them.”
“Your fastest yet. Five hours and twenty-three minutes.” Malfoy touches his neck and winces. “But maybe we left it too long between feeds.”
Harry had fiercely argued to be allowed to invite Malfoy to the annual Auror team-building trip—but now they were here, Malfoy’s hair softly curled from seawater, he didn’t know what he’d been thinking.
“What spell?” Draco asks vaguely. Harry’s response seems to have appeased him—but now he’s abandoned all pretence and is adjusting himself shamelessly. His legs part as he does and Harry gets an eyeful of the very defined shape of Draco’s swollen cock pressing against the thin cotton of his pyjama bottoms.
Malfoy’s teeth grazed the underside of Harry’s cock and Harry hissed, his hips thrusting upwards, his grip on Malfoy’s hair tightening.
He dragged his attention back to the present.
Prompt: storybook
He pulled at Harry’s arse again, and this time Harry went along with the movement, lowering his hips until he was directly on top of Draco, the hard line of his cock pressing into Draco’s groin. Draco groaned and yanked him closer still, his hands blindly grabbing at Harry’s skin, the soft flesh of his arse cheeks, the hard lines of his back. Any grasp he’d had on his self-control had disappeared with his clothes. Years of training himself to have restraint, to be slow and subtle and composed, melted away in an instant. He was a teenager again, whining and desperate and needy.
“I know,” Potter agreed.
The second touch was a slow, almost motionless press of the head of Harry’s dick against Draco’s rim. Neither of them moved, united in wanting to savour this, this moment of not-quite-yet, the last moment they’d be able to say they hadn’t had sex. They could hardly take it back, not now, but there was still an exhilaration in being on the edge of this, the last barrier they had to cross.
. Draco shudders. The movement is so severe that he chokes and he pulls off, gasping for air. Pre-come and saliva drip down his chin. Potter is looking at him like he’s the most brilliant thing he’s ever seen. Draco drinks it in with watering eyes.
“He— Draco, I swear, I would
“Fuck, Draco, please –
Underneath him, Malfoy was the picture of debauchery. His face was red, his hair was a mess, he was still tied up and he was covered in come. Some of it had landed on his face. As Harry watched, the first stirrings of orgasm gathering in his stomach, Malfoy’s tongue slid out to lick up a stray drop.
“What? Is he not–?” Harry scrubbed at his eyes; they were crusted over with dried tears. The room was blurry; unfamiliar at first, but the memory of their arrival slotted into place as he took it in. Ron and Hermione were sitting on his left, both with rumpled robes and dark smudges under their eyes. There was no one else in the room.
Harry didn’t move. Draco wasn’t lying: he was tied up. Literally, gloriously, devastatingly tied up. And he was naked. Naked and
“You’re not going to trick me into saying ‘Jarvey Janglers’, Draco, so stop trying.”
Draco’s doubt must have shown on his face, because Potter snorted and corrected himself.
“Okay?” Harry asks.
Better, because Harry had been desperate too—he had grabbed Draco and gasped into his mouth and thrust himself against Draco’s thigh like he could come from it.
, said a traitorous voice in his head.
“No, no, of course not!”
He let out a yell and slammed the door closed, heart pounding.
“Hello, gorgeous.” Draco kisses him again. Harry’s hand slides over my skin, stopping an inch from my cock.
“But–” They’d never exchanged presents before. Harry had nearly bought Draco about twenty different things over the last month but had stopped himself – presents weren’t something they
was the one who had been frog-marched to the fourth floor and forced into the interrogation room.
“The one with the snake-head doorknob.”
And yet.
“Oh?”
Harry tried to focus his attention away from post-duel Malfoy’s pink-tinged cheeks and thought about it. The way Hermione and Ron had talked about Legilimency, he had expected it to be painful – or at least uncomfortable, like the defensive prickles that rose around him during a Diagnostic Charm. But Harry didn’t feel anything at all.
His awareness of his slow breathing and steady heartbeat was first to return. It was restored abruptly, like a lost part that had clicked back into place. He was alive, then. It was good to know.
“You think I shouldn’t open it.” Harry wasn’t worried about not waking up – the rest would be quite nice, honestly – but he understood Malfoy’s hesitation. If their roles were reversed, Harry wouldn’t want Malfoy to turn back into a person who hated him, either.
that stopped him. Not for any noble reason – not the reminder of his regular life, nor a stark headline making him pause to appreciate what he had. No, it was the date atop the paper that gave him pause: the 25th. He had slept an entire day away.
Malfoy raised an unimpressed eyebrow.
“I’ve never felt anything like that,” Harry murmured. “The Legilimency connection, I mean. Well, the sex, too, but—that was something else.”
“Thank you.” Malfoy stood too, and with a flick of his wand, banished the desk and chairs.
Harry looked up. Both of them were staring. “What?”
in Harry’s fist, and a tremor went through his whole body when Harry tightened his grip. Pressed against him as he was, Harry could feel Draco’s every shudder, every twitch, and he couldn’t suppress a noise of amazement. He’d never thought – never even considered that one day he’d be able to–
“Harry,” Draco said slowly. “You understand how Christmas presents work, don’t you?”
Maybe he was talking sense—or maybe a Teacher Voice worked on Hermione like nothing else could—but Hermione took a deep breath and nodded shakily.
Harry’s climax slammed into him so hard that he nearly passed out. He could vaguely hear a long, low groan and assumed he was the one making it, but had no power to stop it. His entire body was pulsing, shaking, forcing himself as deep as possible into Malfoy, all hot, white, overwhelming pleasure.
Harry let his hand drop. He stood.
“Shut up.”
The reply was muffled, distant. “Potter?”
“That’s the flag of Switzerland, right?” Harry asked innocently. “Though the watch was a bit grubby.”
“Oh, sorry,” Harry said innocently. “Is this the right office? I’m supposed to meet a…” He squinted at his palm as if reading something written there. “Healer Maffloy?”
“No,” Harry agreed.
Harry had grinned, always grateful for a detail of himself that sounded
“Yes,” Potter agrees. “And Hermione is definitely going to kill me.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes and waved his wand. The door slammed closed behind Harry. “Not that it’s remotely any of your business,” he sniffed, “but Parvati sent me an owl early yesterday morning asking to rearrange. I had been hoping for a day off, but then I wouldn’t have had the pleasure of hearing her complain at length about how obnoxious you were as a teenager.” He smirked. “You took her to the Yule Ball, you know. You were an awful date.”
Hermione coughed and Harry dragged his gaze away. Her eyes were shrewd. Harry didn’t like it.
Then tier three showed Harry laughing at a white-chocolate ferret, who was chasing its tail.
Malfoy looked up at him. “Potter?” he said softly. Harry realised his thumb was rubbing soft circles on the inside of Malfoy’s arm and pulled away.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m sure you must be sick to death of having Diagnostic Charms cast on you,” Malfoy said.
you’re killing me, please touch me, please, fuck me faster, come
It took an age for the shuddering to subside. When Draco finally came back to himself, shaking and tentative, the world was unnaturally quiet.
,” he says. “Remind me who just had you begging to come? Because I don’t recall it being Harry ‘can’t deepthroat anything bigger than a finger’ Potter.”
"I think I’m gonna head home,” Harry said. “I’ll see you tomorrow, yeah?”
Harry tried again, straining for the elusive feeling of Malfoy, whatever that meant. But the only thing he felt was awkwardness. The image in front of them shifted back to Malfoy laughing breathlessly after their duel.
He didn’t want to.
Harry’s heart was beating rapidly in his chest. He wondered whether Malfoy’s was too.
“Draco?” Molly prompted.
“Actually,” Harry said, “you are interrupting. Can you give us a minute?”
“Just for a bit. Everyone’s dancing, nobody will even notice we’ve gone. And the contract won’t mind where we are if we’re together.”
“Lord, I regret teaching her how to do that,” Hermione said, pinching the bridge of her nose. “I thought it would make it easier to communicate, but she’s been a nightmare all morning. Anyway, you’re here! How are you feeling?”
Draco looked at him incredulously. “Yes.
Potter blinks. Then he laughs – once, brightly, in a way Draco hasn’t seen him laugh all year. Draco wants to
“Do you want a drink?” he asked abruptly.
“Fuck,” he gasped, staring at Malfoy. He remembered this from last time, too – Malfoy pink, panting, euphoric.
The force of Draco’s attention is pushing Potter backwards, both of them wild but Draco more so, fuelled by the knowledge that this is his only chance to know what Potter feels like, tastes like, sounds like. They’re both breathing heavily, hot gasps becoming a single desperate flow of air between them, and it’s making Draco light-headed. He’s rock hard – has been since the moment Potter batted his hand out of the air – but the ache in his trousers is distant, overwhelmed by the taste of Potter’s mouth, the slide of his tongue, the scrape of his stubble against Draco’s chin.
. Eighteen minutes left. Not long – not long enough – but, Merlin, he’s not going to forgo the chance to push his aching cock between Harry Potter’s lips. He wants to see Harry Potter suck Draco’s dick and
“Yes, more – I need more –
“And you have kept the door in your mind?”
. I want you inside me. I need you.
Malfoy’s stone-faced façade shattered again. “What are you talking about?”
“Hm.”
Prompt: Borrowed
“God.” His past self had done more in two weeks than Harry had managed in four and a half months. Each day had at least six things listed – so many unfamiliar names and places. There was a painful tug in Harry’s gut. These days, he considered it a busy day if he stopped at the shop on the way home from lunch.
He picked the letter off his stomach. His first thought was work, but the parchment wasn’t Ministry standard. His second was Ginny, but his full name and address were written neatly on the envelope – not really her style.
“Hey!” Harry shoots Draco a wounded look. “I’m working on it!”
Draco does it again, spearing Potter on his tongue, twisting his hand around the head of Potter’s cock, digging his nails into the flesh of Potter’s arse. He’s shaking, struggling to keep it together, but Potter is worse – he’s
Behind his eyelids was Malfoy. Harry shied away from the image, assuming it would be strange to think of him in such a context. But the snapshot of Malfoy after the duel – pink-cheeked and panting – persisted. The surroundings shifted. Suddenly, Harry pictured Malfoy sweaty and elated, not standing, grinning, framed by the large window in his office, but laid across Harry’s bed in the half-light of dusk, eyes lidded.
“Hm?”
Malfoy himself was leaning back in his chair, his soft hair rumpled, his notebook held open in front of him with one elegant hand.
He gazed at the unfamiliar handwriting. His mouth formed the names of people he didn’t know: Kreacher, Molly, Ron, Staghart, Silverling, Hermione.
produced the weakest flickers of light, the dying sputter of a candle almost burned out. He was vaguely concerned that Grimmauld Place would kick him out, too—he was well aware of the Black family’s attitude towards Muggles and Squibs—but Kreacher assured him that
“Yeah.” Harry fumbled in the sheets for his wand and cast another
“Bed,” Harry murmurs, and Draco’s nails dig into Harry’s skin, hard.
Awareness returned slowly. Harry’s mind woke before his body did, the sensations of his physical self distant and muffled. It felt like he was floating. He was calm. Peaceful.
“Yes.” Malfoy leaned forwards. “It may be that it’s none of my business, so do feel free to tell me to fuck off. But you’ve been awfully distracted recently. Are you sure everything is okay?”
It was difficult to focus on feelings when Harry had no way of closing his eyes, of blocking out the image of Malfoy – and it was obvious now, the Malfoy in front of him was definitely older than a teenager, his cheekbones sharp, his eyes tired – pausing in front of a bookcase, reaching out to run elegant ink-smudged fingers along the books’ spines. Harry stared at the movement, fascinated.
“The last time I saw him,” Harry said, leaning closer, “he showed up on my doorstep while I was in the middle of a very important case and managed to keep me away from work for hours.”
“How on earth is your mind supposed to get stronger if you never give it new information?” Malfoy demanded.
There’s a second sheet of parchment behind the first. It contains just two words:
There was a tightening in Harry’s groin. He looked down, shocked to find that he was already half-hard.
“I’m not immortal,” Harry starts to say, but Malfoy curves his body into Harry’s and pulls him into a kiss. It would be easy to resist the tug of it, but Harry doesn’t want to. He presses himself against Malfoy – warm again, soft again – and lets himself sink into the decadence of Malfoy’s mouth.
“Draco.” Harry reached out helplessly, needing to touch him, needing an anchor. The bed felt as if it were on the waves of that wild blue-grey sea off the coast of Shetland. “You never said.”
Malfoy smiled softly. When he spoke, his lips didn’t move. “Not at all. It was all you. You’re brilliant, Harry Potter.”
Malfoy looked at him sharply. “What?”
“What was the first thing you did when you got there?”
.” Harry arched off the bed, forcing his arse onto Draco’s fingers. “Oh, fucking—
Over the last six months, Harry had received so many letters, been approached by so many strangers, read so many news articles – all of them talking about this grand hero that didn’t sound anything like Harry at all. How was he supposed to be that person? He knew, deep down, that he wasn’t a Saviour. He wasn’t a Chosen One or a Vanquisher of Darkness. He was just … Harry.
“Good to see you again, Tom,” Harry said, striding over. “Is there a problem?”
“Yeah, that’s what I had Draco yelling just before she Floo’d in,” Harry says.
Harry’s stomach sank at the onset of the old argument. He tried to think of a believable excuse to leave.
, god, but…”
“Listen, I really don’t know if I can,” he says, and his voice cracks, sounds human again. “We haven’t left it so long before. I think you should take the potion.”
“Ah.” Malfoy was suddenly all business. “You found it difficult? Was there any physical pain associated with the attempt? Any flashes of light? Unusual sounds or sensations?” His quill was back in his hand, nib hovering over the page of his notebook.
“Don’t go.” Harry didn’t know whether he’d said it out loud or in his head. He clung to the feeling of Malfoy as the maelstrom of colour and sound dragged him under. “Please. Please don’t go.”
“I–” Ron glanced at Hermione, who continued to stare at her tea like it was silently imparting great wisdom. “Okay,” he said. “Yeah, you’re right. I will do.”
Harry schooled his features into something he hoped resembled grateful delight. “Oh—yes! It’s wonderful! It must have taken ages. How did you know about the ferret?” He glanced at Draco.
Harry’s stomach plummeted. “What are you–?”
“Monday, Potter.” Malfoy strode to the door and disappeared into the hazy night. Harry dropped back into his chair and groaned, long and loud and heartfelt. He may only have five months of memories, but he could say with certainty that he’d never been so frustrated in his life.
Harry focused. The room around them shifted until they were standing in front of the one locked door. Malfoy’s approval rippled through him, sending a cool tingling through Harry’s mind and down his spine.
“Better than anything,” Harry agrees breathlessly, fucking up into their joined fists. “Oh,
“First rule of safewords, Potter: they have to be memorable.” Malfoy smirked, pale eyes glinting, then seemed to catch himself. He cleared his throat. “So. How did you get on with visualising a physical space in your mind?”
“Nonsense,” Malfoy sniffed. “Your new homework is to sort things out with them. First thing tomorrow.”
Harry snapped back to himself. “Sorry.”
“The breeze,” he said. “That’s you, isn’t it?” He focused on the feeling – now he thought about it, it was less like a breeze and more like a cool patch of – something. What had Malfoy said? A presence.
“We did talk about it a bit. When I was really young,” Draco said eventually. “She loved her wedding day, you know. She’d get the photographs out all the time. Said it was the best day of her life.” He swallowed, his voice going funny. “She said she couldn’t wait for me to have the same happiness. A big, grand wedding day, with lots of flowers and food and music and hundreds of guests to be impressed by me.”
. He’s really – He’s actually–
A distortion of colour, and Malfoy’s chair was empty, but Harry’s was not; Harry was sitting in it, as he sat every morning from ten o’clock. But Malfoy was on top of him, chest to chest with Harry, his robes half-undone, hanging off him. He was moving. He was – the real Harry whimpered – he was fucking himself on Harry’s cock. Imaginary Harry grabbed Malfoy’s hips and yanked him downwards. Malfoy gasped and started to wank himself off, riding Harry wildly, crying out with pleasure.
It was interesting, Harry thought, as he pulled the covers over them and kissed Draco again, slow and sweet. He had never considered himself a materialistic person. He’d always thought a childhood with barely any possessions had made him quite the opposite.
Draco was staring, not at the ferret, but at the green smudge in the sky over the white fondant Manor. It could have been a Dark Mark. Maybe the flash of a Killing Curse. It could also have just been a green smudge.
“Now, Mr Goyle?”
“What, you’re telling me you didn’t hover over him and feed him the lines?”
Harry waited for him to finish with narrowed eyes.
Harry blinked, and found himself back in Malfoy’s office. He squinted at the window; the sun had shifted while he’d been in Malfoy’s mind; Harry’s chair was bathed in warm mid-morning light.
And that expression on his face…
Draco gets on the bed. He scratches his nails down Potter’s back, following the smooth line of his spine, until he has Potter’s pert fucking arse cheeks in the palms of his hands.
up as Harry’s Christmas present. He might as well get it all out there.
“Yes.” Harry was aching for it. Every grip of Draco’s hole around his fingers sent a throb through him, through his cock. “Yes, I will, I want to. God, Draco – Come here, let me – Can you get up? On your knees?”
“Good. That’s very good, Harry.”
“Are you busy after Christmas?” Harry blurted. “Can I – I’d like to come over, maybe. Do the thing where we spend time together outside of work. If you want to.”

Draco bristled. “Like what?”
“Okay,” Malfoy repeated. “Now, hold the image steady and open your eyes. I’m going to cast as soon as you do.”
It was much worse now. Now they’d been inside each other’s minds, their fantasies. Now Harry knew how Draco felt. Now they’d kissed.
of pleasure.
Harry doubted it; all he could think about was how much Malfoy looked like he’d just been fucked and how desperately Harry wanted to have been the one who had done it. “I think so.”
, Harry, that’s – I’m serious, get those horrid things off. You can’t make me think of Ron Weasley right now, it’s cruel.”
“Yeah – Say my name when you come – You can come now – Come for me – Come–”
Malfoy had that shocked, blank look on his face again.
going to the library is not an option.
“I told you: with you, it really won’t be a proble—
“You’re right,” she said. “We’ll get to the bottom of this. You’re going to be absolutely fine.”
Potter didn’t move away.
“Dunno. Most days. Five times a week, maybe.”
“More powerful spell-casters may not need the incantation. And besides, learning to identify a foreign presence is a key skill in Mind Magic, especially Occlumency. And while Occlumency is not our end goal, there are many teachings that will be extraordinarily useful in aiding your recovery. And also,” he continued importantly, “I’m the Healer, and I say so.”
Harry, already on guard from Malfoy’s earlier outburst, felt a twinge of annoyance. What did Malfoy mean by “if you wish to continue”? Did he think the only reason Harry hadn’t got his memory back yet was because he hadn’t been bothered to stick with something for longer than a day?
They were colleagues. Partners.
“Potter,” Malfoy snapped. “Answer the question.”
“I think about kissing you all the time,” Harry said in a low, urgent voice. “Every day. Every time I see you.”
of his experiences, of course) – how he was clever and professional and patient, how Harry’s mental control had strengthened so much that he’d apparently been doing advanced Occlumency for weeks without even realising. Ron had nodded and gazed solemnly into his tikka masala. Hermione had called them both idiots and helped herself to Harry’s naan.
“Same old,” Harry said. “She dragged in another so-called expert. Their new plan is Legilimency therapy.”
“He’s just being protective,” Malfoy said quietly. “He’s not saying anything that isn’t true.”
Harry yelped, sure for one wild moment that he’d magically manifested the subject of his musings.
“Potions, then. Weren’t you in the top five of our year, something like that?”
“That’s hardly fair, Ron, you know what happened during sixth year–”
“Good morning to you, too,” Harry muttered. He stretched, taking guilty stock of the ache in the back of his legs, the bruises on his shoulders and back.
“You managed to dress yourself, then?” Draco asked, looking Harry up and down. “Or did poor Kreacher have to help you?”
,” he insists.
Malfoy holds his arm out to Harry. He’s only shaking a little bit. “Heal it,” he demands.
It’s achingly slow at first. My eyes want to close against the ecstasy that drags at me, but I force them open, drinking in the sight of Draco biting his lip, pain and pleasure warring on his red face. And Harry—
Harry stiffened at the stranger’s voice. He straightened. Striding up to them was a tall, thin man with an impressive handlebar moustache. He was entirely unfamiliar and was beaming at Harry.
In the present, heat flared through Harry. “God, I’m sorry, I–”
) was completely unacceptable—so he ignored Potter entirely and summoned the waiter with a flick of his finger.
I lie there for what feels like hours, staring at Harry and Draco’s joined hands, resting, twined, just above my belly button. The clunking tick of the grandfather clock and the soft ebb and flow of their breathing lulls me into a sort of trance, I suppose, because I don’t notice when Draco wakes up.
As Harry got angrier, Malfoy calmed. “Viewing things like that could set your recovery back months, and you don’t have months.” His gaze was cool, his earlier emotion gone. “You know what it’s like to experience a memory; it’s not like hearing or reading about it, it’s like you’re actually there. I wouldn’t show you even if you were fully recovered.”
3:17. Thirteen minutes left.
“Mmm, I like hearing you beg,” Malfoy purrs, his tongue licking hot ownership into my skin. “Do it again.”
Harry cleared his throat. “Yeah, it’s me.”
Draco gave him a look that said he knew Harry was being an idiot on purpose but he wasn’t entirely sure why. “I’m positive it hasn’t escaped your notice that it’s the Friday before Christmas,” he said, sniffing. “Why have you chosen this moment to take an interest in paperwork when I have to bribe you with increasingly ridiculous incentives to get you to even glance at it the rest of the year?”
He exhaled. “Well, I suppose it’s about time, isn’t it?” he said. “What’s the next step?”
Harry snorted. “That won’t be a problem.”
Malfoy’s eyes widened. He put his drink down slowly. “I remember.”
. It’s Draco.
Hermione shook her head. “There’s something else going on, but they don’t know what. They mentioned that it could be a curse—”
“Yours,” he growls.
“Sometimes suspects are stubborn. No sense in showing them an easy confession.”
Draco’s voice catches on every upward jerk of my hips. My jaw aches and my eyes are watering but I’m drowning in pleasure. At this point, I’m groaning around Harry’s cock more than I’m actually sucking it, but he doesn’t seem to mind; his breaths come in short, harsh pants as he watches me.
Harry was vaguely aware of a clock ticking somewhere on his left. A log cracked in the fireplace.
“I had a purple pickled pepper flavoured one,” Harry added. “And one that tasted a bit like bitter butter. That one was better.”
of practising, under literal threat of death. You got a boner you were embarrassed about and figured it out overnight.”
But, a couple of drinks in, Malfoy across the table from him looking soft and smudged and flustered, it didn’t seem like that big of a deal.
“Whassamatter? Ron’s not leaving, is he?”
“Yes,” Harry said. “Where is he?”
Harry shrugged, unapologetic. “None of you will tell me how we know each other. And I couldn’t help but notice your arm yesterday.”
He knocked.
The ribbons fell off like water. Draco made a pained noise as his ankles separated and his feet dropped to either side of Harry’s thighs. His arms sprang apart and his hands landed clumsily on Harry’s stomach – spunk smearing under his palms.
“Understandably,” Malfoy said. “And – about…” He faltered. “About the other thing.” At Harry’s blank expression, he continued, pained. “The discussion we had regarding … my feelings towards you in particular as a patient.”
around their table. Malfoy’s eyes followed the movement.
“No,” Harry says honestly, and Draco rolls his eyes and walks to the window. He reaches up—the raised hem of his top reveals a flash of smooth skin and the dip of his spine—and opens it a crack, leaving the curtains slightly parted.
done by the wonderful lastontheboat!
The hot lick of desire that swept through him at Malfoy’s words was quickly tempered by the thought of having to replace him with another useless, toadying, arse-licking twat.
“It means that I … If I were a better person, I would leave.”
“So – so fucking hot – Merlin!” Harry could still hear his cock in Malfoy’s throat through the hoarseness of Malfoy’s voice. He growled, shifted, fucked Malfoy harder. This prompted the loudest noise from Malfoy yet, almost a yelp. “
Malfoy stepped closer. He curled his long fingers into the front of Harry’s robes. He was taller than Harry. Harry hadn’t realised.
Something wet and cool fills Draco’s hand, but Draco barely notices – he only needs to turn his head a fraction and his nose is buried in Potter’s hair. He breathes him in. Potter smells like sweat and shampoo and Amortentia and Draco wants to
Draco stares, taken aback by the performance. He expected an immediate seduction. He expected Potter to appear shirtless and dark-eyed and wanting, leaning over Draco and murmuring praise into his ear. That’s the main scenario that has preoccupied his regular, not-from-a-box fantasies – the curtains around his bed sealed tight, his cock straining in his fist, his lip bitten so hard against his whimpers that he can taste blood.
The words hung heavy.
– It would – Would feel so good–”
Harry’s gaze drags from Draco’s kiss-swollen lips to his nipple, inches from my mouth and wet with my spit, to me.
“Yeah,” Draco said, apparently only half-listening. The casual disregard of Harry’s words was so perfectly
She waved a hand. “Oh, he’s probably with a patient. He’s very in-demand, you know. He’s quite brilliant, quite brilliant.”
Malfoy pushes his hips up, drawing Harry’s attention to his erect cock. It is thick with blood, throbbing with it. The heady scent of it weaves with the sharp tang of Malfoy’s arousal. Harry bends forwards unthinkingly. Malfoy raises his hips again, angles his dick towards Harry’s mouth. With great difficulty, Harry pulls away.
“I always thought I was a bit on the adventurous side, you know?” Harry continues. “But he makes me feel like the most boring sod in the world.”
Ron rolled his eyes. “You’re telling me. Five months ago, I didn’t even know St Mungo’s had a library. Now I’ve had bits from every book it stocks read out to me before bed. I’m practically a Mind Healer myself at this point.”
He reached out to Malfoy in his mind and started when Malfoy grabbed his hand again in the physical world.
“Good.” Malfoy stepped back. “Well, I’m satisfied you’re as ready as you can be. Healer Brisley, if your team is in place…?”
Malfoy’s face flickered. “That something happened to make you feel such a way. If you’ve met someone you find attractive, for example. Or if you have found yourself in an intimate situation for the first time.”
Harry steeled himself.
He wrenches himself away. Potter whines, reaches up to pull him back. Draco wants to die.
been thinking. He hadn’t had a single intelligent thought in the last three months. Not since he stopped ignoring Brisley’s owls about the
“I…” The feeling of Malfoy’s breath playing over Harry’s face sent unexpected thrills down his spine. His eyes, no longer struggling to focus, were fixed on Malfoy’s. This was ridiculous. What were they doing? Harry imagined himself saying no, stepping out of Malfoy’s grip and leaving. Why wasn’t he leaving? Merlin, what was wrong with him? “Malfoy…”
“Did you want it to be someone else?”
As he stepped into the kitchen for a fortifying cuppa, Kreacher took one look at him, bowed deeply and croaked, “Welcome back, Master Harry.”
“Believe me, mate, that’s the least of his faults–”
“No, I got there eventually,” Harry said, trying not to squirm under Draco’s lingering gaze. “Not that Kreacher didn’t try to help, the perv. He practically broke down my bedroom door, he was so desperate. He was never this weird before—what have you been teaching him?”
After weeks of dreaming about it, Harry had thought he was prepared. He wasn’t.
Harry’s breath caught. He didn’t need reminding. He’d been thinking about it all night.
Thanks to Malfoy’s not-so-subtle hints, Harry successfully bluffed his way through the conversation with Scuttleby. He was, however, not successful at keeping his temper. He left Scuttleby standing outside the Leaky Cauldron, cowed and confused. He didn’t regret it.
“Oh, don’t worry, you were playing again the year after.”
“You,” Harry said. He twisted his wrist and Draco shuddered. “In the restaurant, the way you were talking—what happened to the snotty little shit I knew at school who was fully aware of his own worth?”
“I knew something was weird!” Potter scans the mess of clothes on the floor for his pants and tugs them on. Draco should get dressed too – he’s still standing there, naked and frozen – but he can’t – What has he done – He can’t breathe – How can all of that have been real – How can he have
“Can’t. Can’t stop. Fuck, Draco.” The movement of his hips was instinctive. Uncontrollable.
Malfoy inhales sharply. His fingers tighten around his length. “Fuck. You hardly need to flatter me at this point, you know. I’m already here.”
“Granger’s notes said that you had a negative experience trying to learn Occlumency.” Malfoy’s face and tone were so mild and professional that Harry thought he must have imagined the disdain. He shook his head, annoyed at himself – he was letting Ron’s dislike of Malfoy get to him, just like Hermione had said. “I’m hoping you’ll find this a little easier,” Malfoy continued, “since we’ll be working together rather than against each other.”
Harry tilted his head and, with the familiarity of weeks spent crashing together like waves on a shore, Malfoy kissed him, and kissed him, and kissed him.
Harry, however, his hand loosely gripping Draco Malfoy’s erection, was thinking quite hard indeed. He was remembering every touch, every look, every wicked smirk. The way Draco’s hands had lingered as they smoothed the collar of Harry’s robes.
“I’m just here to collect Mr Potter!” came Healer Brisley’s cheerful response. The door remained closed.
“Haven’t noticed what?” Harry pulled himself upright. The cold metal bars of the headboard dug into his back. “Hermione, what is it?”
Unwillingly, I remember how that cock felt in my hand, hot and hard, as Harry and I fucked him. I remember the glint of his nipple piercing as he rode me. The regret of not being able to suck it into my mouth.
Harry’s heart raced. His every muscle was tense. But when he fell forwards into Malfoy’s mind, he found himself in the empty high-ceilinged room that was Malfoy’s private mental space. The rows of white doors that lined the walls were all closed. It was quiet, serene. A spring morning in a stately home.
“More homework,” Malfoy snapped.
,” like he wasn’t casually tearing open every box that Draco had hidden his deepest secrets inside.
Harry flung off his robes and tore himself from Draco’s mouth to tug off his shirt and jeans. It felt good to be free from the stuffiness of his clothes, but it felt even better to climb onto the bed and pull Draco close, to feel the hot thrill of his skin and the hard line of his dick. Harry ground himself against it – his own dick was aching and desperate for attention, still trapped in his boxers (which were bright orange, the Chudley Cannons logo emblazoned across the arse).
“Oh? Why? What else are you worried about?”
“Quite.” There was a strange note in Malfoy’s voice, but Harry was still mentally poking at the presence in his head, baffled that he hadn’t felt it the first time. Then, suddenly, it vanished.
“Watch me,” Harry said dangerously. He wrapped his arms around Malfoy and braced himself.
wand.”
“Yes to which bit?”
His test results were still encouraging, and Harry left Brisley’s office with the prediction that he would be completely back to normal within another few days. He’d come alone this time, and stood motionless in the fourth-floor corridor for five long minutes before turning away and heading home.
“If you’re sure that I haven’t ruined everything by being a hot-headed dickbag.”
“God,
“I’ll understand if you don’t want me here.”
He and Malfoy were in the Leaky Cauldron. They were, in fact, at the very table they were actually sitting at, the barman still scrubbing away ten feet to their right. Neither Harry nor Malfoy were doing anything – they just stared at each other. Again, Harry was confused. Was he living the present moment through Malfoy’s perception?
“You will,” Malfoy said. It sounded like a threat. It sounded like a promise.
But Potter wasn’t looking at the scroll. In fact, as before, he wasn’t paying the slightest bit of attention to the conversation. Instead, his eyes were fixed on the bar, against which a past version of Draco was leaning. Memory-Potter and Draco both watched as memory-Draco spelled the lid off a bottle of Butterbeer and took a swig.
Slowly, Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry. Despite his flushed cheeks and his shallow breathing, his hand was steady. “Are you sure?” he asked.
“Mr Weasley, if you could?”
“You – what?”
The Head Auror allows pub nights under two conditions. One: at least four team members don’t drink. Two: everyone carries Sobering Solution. Constant vigilance.
He valiantly tried to gather himself together through this unanticipated haze of lust. He knew he shouldn’t be doing this. A fresh surge of guilt shot through him. What was he doing? Why hadn’t he just said no to this?
At least, it did me. I doubt Malfoy overthinks things to the same extent. I doubt he’s had a single self-critical thought in his life.
“Fuck you.” Harry twined his fingers with Draco’s and felt the weight of Draco’s other hand settle on his waist. “I can’t dance,” he warned.
“Oh – yeah. ’Course.”
“Yes, I know,” Malfoy snapped. “I just mean – Harry. With your memories back – your past self might not want–”
“Shut up,” Draco hissed, lashing out in the only way he could.
He felt … nothing. Not encouraged, nor disheartened, nor intrigued – the man looking back at him was just … some bloke. He had a shadow of stubble on his chin. His eyebrows were thick and straight and his eyes were green behind the round-rimmed glasses. None of this ignited a single spark of familiarity.
“What’s that sound?”
Surely not.
But Harry couldn’t stop thinking about him. Hadn’t been able to stop thinking about him for weeks. Months. And now Malfoy had admitted to wanting Harry back – it seemed like the worst kind of punishment to not be able to have this, to not feel Malfoy pressed against him, to not have Malfoy’s long, graceful fingers twine with his own. There had to be a way of having that that didn’t put either of them at risk.
Ron gaped. “I can’t believe I’m hearing this! Snape was made of the exact same stuff that Malfoy is, and you know it.”
Harry’s heart clenched. “Forget I said anything,” he said abruptly. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t’ve … What, er – What do you think about the Magpies’ chances against the Tornados on Saturday?”
Malfoy’s smile faltered. He cleared his throat and laced his fingers together. His right thumb rubbed at the thick silver ring. “Homework,” he said.
“He’s flirting, believe it or not,” he says with a wry smile. “He’s inviting you over.”
the present.”
He’s wrong.
He grabbed Malfoy’s dick – too roughly, too tightly – and Malfoy moaned.
“Draco?” Harry called again.
I laugh nervously. I never expected Harry to be a jealous sort of bloke—but I suppose when you hang around Malfoy all the time, some of his entitlement is bound to rub off.
“You know,” Potter said, when Draco’s distraction allowed silence to build between them, “I never asked—how
Harry resolutely didn’t look up from his report.
They had decided that, although it was important that they convince the contract that they were legitimately marrying, there were certain wedding customs they could skip: the traditional honeymoon activities being one of them. They also decided against speeches, for obvious reasons. And Draco had conceded that a formal sit-down meal, which would require a seating plan that somehow did not result in a duel breaking out, was not a good idea.
Malfoy bobs his head and I swear around my fist. He shoots me a glare. His lips are stretched taut around me. Bloody hell.
Harry pulled a face. He’d seen the carriages Malfoy had recommended—awful, ostentatious things, pulled by silver adolescent unicorns with red ribbons woven into their manes. Harry wouldn’t be seen dead ten feet near one, much less riding one through London.
Groans, from two mouths, in two minds. Harry’s eyes burned into Draco’s—and Draco almost wished he could look at the rest of him, could properly admire the way he shuddered and sweated and spread himself open. But Harry was right; this
Malfoy leant against the wall next to Harry. Their arms touched, reigniting the sparks of heat on Harry’s cheeks that the evening air had begun to calm. Harry didn’t lift his head.
