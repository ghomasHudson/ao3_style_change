Harry grinned. “Just don’t insult it, and you should be fine, then.” Draco pinched him, and Harry laughed. This was the first real interaction he and Draco had had since their awkward morning encounter, and Harry was relieved that Draco also seemed content to just forget all about it—or, at least, pretend to.
“Honestly,” Rose told him, laughing, “anyone who was at school with them could have seen it coming. They were so obsessed with each other that even people in different years and houses knew about it.”
“Look on the bright side,” Ron said, giving him a conciliatory pat on the back. “At least it will distract you from the breakup.”
“I can’t believe I’m saying this, Weasley, but I agree with you.” Draco was perched on one of the bar stools, sipping on a steaming mug of coffee. Ron—very maturely, in Harry’s opinion—did not respond other than with a roll of his eyes.
“Exactly! Watching you suffer is my greatest joy.” Ginny winked and sipped her wine. She really was remarkably like the twins, sometimes.
Fourteen sets of eyes gazed expectantly up at him, and Harry had to close his own eyes for a moment to brace himself. Opening them again, he made eye contact with a tall, perfectly coiffed and immaculately dressed blond. “William.”
“It’s only for emergencies,” Harry explained, flipping it open and looking down at the screen. He pressed a few buttons and then groaned again, giving Draco a pained, apologetic look that did not bode well for where the evening had seemed to be heading. Sure enough:
“Yeah.” Harry took a deep breath and went on. “So. Smith was tailing me, trying to distract me by talking shit. Probably because he’s bloody useless as a Chaser,” he added bitterly. “Anyway, at first he was just spewing the usual bull about how I only got where I am because I’m famous. Which like, whatever, I’m used to that, it doesn’t really bother me anymore.”
“Hmm.” Harry turned his gaze back out over the ocean. The more time he spent around Cormac, the more he thought that the appeal of his body was far outweighed by his grating personality.
It had been a low point in and of itself. And then, things had gotten worse, because Pansy had had an idea—The Bachelor: Magical Edition.
She passed around the warm muffins, and Harry’s eyes fell shut at his first bite. They were perfectly soft and fluffy, and the blueberries burst in his mouth as he chewed.  “These are fantastic,” he opined, and there was a murmur of agreement from around the group.
After enduring a several-hour chewing out by Montague, Harry was feeling exhausted, guilty, and just generally awful. He couldn’t bear the thought of going back to Ron and Hermione’s to face Ron’s pity and Hermione’s disappointment. All he really wanted, he realized, was to see Draco.
Draco wrinkled his brow, not really sure what to make of that, but then Harry asked a question about the potions bust, and Draco forgot about it, instead focusing on a dramatic retelling of his glorious victory.
Oliver made his way up to the bar, and Harry took a moment to observe the bustling pub around him. The room was full of people eating, drinking, and chatting, and Harry and Oliver had remained largely unharassed. Of course, this was partially due to the minor privacy charm that Hannah Abbott had installed on a few of the booths when she’d taken over the establishment. Having married Neville Longbottom, she was all too aware of the unwanted attention many of her former classmates received in the aftermath of the war, and had made sure that they could have a quiet meal or drink at her pub if they wanted to. It had been both conscientious and an astute business move.
Harry gave him a mischievous smile. “I figured it was worth a shot. And if you’re horrible, I’ll just get extremely drunk on your knut.” He winked, and Draco couldn’t help but laugh.
“Good, because I’m not changing it. Three nights, back to back, one day to think, and then the final ceremony.”
Draco woke to sunlight coming from the wrong direction, and it took him a moment to shake off his confusion and realize where he was. As he blinked away the last vestiges of sleep, the unfamiliar room around him came into focus, and the memory of the night before came back to him, making him smile. He seemed to have migrated to the far edge of the mattress during the night, he noticed, and was grateful that he hadn’t fallen right off. He stretched and rolled over—grimacing and groaning slightly at the lingering discomfort of their activities—to find Harry sprawled inelegantly on his stomach. His mouth was slightly open, his legs at odd angles, and one arm was wedged under the pillow while the other lay straight, reaching out toward Draco. He looked ridiculous, and ridiculously endearing.
Before too long, Harry felt a slight pressure against his hip and realized that Draco was already beginning to get hard again. He groaned a little, the thought of it enough to cause an answering stirring, and deepened the kiss. He spared a moment to be relieved that he hadn’t been wrong about his refractory period before Draco answered in kind and all thoughts fled his mind.
Harry had been more than happy to help Neville get the place started and running, and although Teddy had declared himself too old for such ‘baby stuff’ when he’d started at Hogwarts, Harry still volunteered there regularly, playing with the kids, reading to them, and just generally helping keep an eye on them—rooms full of children prone to accidental magic needed a lot of supervision, it turned out.
Perry laughed. “What can I say, art is not my forte. But I think I captured the most important parts fairly well.” His eyes slid down Harry’s robe and back and he wiggled his eyebrows.
“Noted.” With a self-satisfied smirk, Draco wound his fingers into Harry’s hair and pulled his mouth back to his own once more.
“No!” Teddy yelled, relapsing into helpless giggles as Harry once again began wiggling his fingers against his stomach and sides. “You’re old you’re old you’re old!” Teddy reached out toward Draco, grinning and gasping. “Cousin Draco! Rescue me!”
Jack and Harry were scheduled to meet at the distillery at 1:30. According to Pansy, although they were coming from the same location, having them arrive separately would make it seem more like a ‘real’ date. Harry Apparated to the official arrival point at 1:25 and headed to the front of the building, where he knew that the invisible crew would already be scattered around, making sure they had all the best angles covered. Hooking his thumbs nervously in his pockets, he waited.
“He’ll be fine,” she announced, causing several relieved looks. Turning to Draco, she told him, “Unfortunately, you seem to have broken several ribs, and you’ve rather shattered your tibia and fibula. It will require a bit more time to mend than is possible on the field, so we should get you to St Mungo’s.”
Suddenly, he felt something brush against his arm like invisible fingers, and relief flooded his body as he realized that, even if the other attendees hadn’t followed them out here, the film crew definitely would have. He crossed his fingers behind his back and, as if on cue, a large moth flew at Romilda’s face.
“Get the fuck out of the water; Merlin’s fucking balls, how long have you been in there, you idiot?!” Firm, cool hands grasped him under the arms and began to pull him upwards.
you waited to tell me until—fuck, I hate you so much.” He buried his face in Draco’s neck. “So fucking much.”
“I cannot believe this is happening.” Draco wasn’t sure why, exactly, he was so shaken. It wasn’t like it had anything to do with him. Still, he couldn’t help himself from digging for more information. “You say it didn’t go anywhere, but you certainly seemed fairly keen on him just now. What was the problem?”
“Hi,” he said awkwardly. Now that he was here, he wasn’t entirely sure where to begin. “I, ah… I went to the Weasleys’, but they said you’d left. Ron told me that you might be here.” He was directly in front of Harry now, close enough to touch but not sure if he should.
fit. Harry’s mouth went dry as they dismounted and sauntered over to him, giving him a knowing smirk.
“Wha—” Draco began indignantly, but Harry just smirked at him and popped the lid off another beer before leaving the kitchen to go back outside, where the rest of their friends were enjoying the last light of a long summer evening.
As the movie approached its ending and each plot line began to resolve, Draco watched in horror as the Scrimgeour-look-alike appeared on the screen wearing nothing but a guitar. He looked down at Harry to berate him for not warning him about just how disturbing things were about to get only to see that Harry was fast asleep on his shoulder.
The unfairness of it all crashed over him in an icy wave, dashing his just-budding hope of finally getting a chance to have something
Draco was forced to reevaluate his assessment when he woke at an abominably early hour to an enthusiastic and rather heavy whirlwind landing on his stomach.
“Hell yes,” said Ron, his face alight as he made eye contact with an equally excited-looking Greg. Harry couldn’t help but smile fondly at the pair’s unrestrained enthusiasm.
Hermione, meanwhile, was eyeing Blaise skeptically. “Did they really make you dress up as Mr. Trick just because he’s the only black male character?” she asked, tone tinged with disgust.
“Trust me, I’m plenty embarrassed about it,” Perry said with a lopsided smile. He didn’t mention the bit about Harry’s past, for which he was thankful; there had been a few articles over the years where one reporter or another had managed to dig up the dirty details of his upbringing, so they were fairly common knowledge at this point, and he appreciated that Perry didn’t push him on it.
“I think it’s wonderful that we’re seeing more integration of Muggle culture and technology into the magical community,” McGonagall opined. “We’ve been far too isolated for far too long. It was quite a burden on our Muggleborn students. Once this ‘internet’ and ‘electronic mail’ began to take off, it became harder and harder for them to adjust to life at Hogwarts.”
When Harry looked back down, Draco was attempting to smirk, but a genuine smile kept getting in the way. Harry shoved him in the shoulder, but immediately pulled him back in. “You could have told me a lot of things. It would have saved both of us a lot of time and trauma.”
Luna wandered over and dipped a bare toe in. “That is quite chilly,” she said contemplatively, “but I think it will feel rather nice.” Without bothering to remove her dress, she sat on the edge of the boat’s deck and slipped into the water.
Pansy sighed, her exasperation written all over her face. “Draco, can you talk some sense into him? I can’t deal with his nonsense, and we’re going to be late.”
Nonetheless, they went about following the instructions to the best of their ability, carefully weighing out ingredients and adding them to the mixer they’d been provided. Perry watched it work, impressed. “This is amazing,” he told Harry. “It’s—” he stopped, then leaned into Harry so that he could speak more quietly. “It’s way handier than magic, isn’t it? You don’t have to concentrate on holding a spell while you do other bits.”
“Good!” Luna patted him on the back and pointed at a screen in the corner of the small classroom. “Go change into your robe, then, and we can get started.”
It was a blisteringly hot day, making the shade of the boat’s canopy and the breeze of their passage a blissful respite. Their wake crashed in waves behind them, occasionally catching on the wind to spray them all in a fine, cool mist. Blaise was in full yacht-captain mode, clearly in his element as he lounged in the luxurious driver’s seat in a striped boat-neck crop top, white capri pants, and a captain’s hat he’d gotten from Merlin-knew-where. He held a martini impressively steadily in one hand, the other hand on the wheel.
An elf appeared in front of Harry, and he asked for a pot of coffee and some toast. “Want anything?” he asked Malfoy.
Harry woke to a knock at his door. He blinked blearily as he climbed from his large bed, shoving his glasses on and stretching as he trudged across the room. Opening the door, he tried to greet the person standing there, but interrupted himself with a gigantic yawn. Ruffling his hair, he squinted until the tall, blurry figure came into focus.
Suddenly, a peal of laughter in the near-distance startled them apart, reminding them that they were still outside and probably very much in plain sight should anyone choose to wander around the corner. Harry cringed as his awareness of parts of his body other than those currently engaging Draco returned; his elbows were sore from leaning against the hard wood of the balcony floor and he was a bit cramped up, not to mention a little chilly. Draco wiggled his shoulders uncomfortably against the deck.
Harry grumbled to himself, but figured that—once again—there wasn’t much he could do about it at this point. He decided to take advantage of the extra time to himself instead, heading down to the hot tub to soak the knots he’d developed during his modeling session out of his muscles. Relaxing into the heat, he let his head loll back and closed his eyes.
Draco looked down at him, curled under the covers, and thought that this was the last time he’d see him like this.
“She is a strange woman and I like her very much,” Harry opined as he wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist. “I take it she knew where you were going, then?”
Harry rolled his eyes but dutifully smiled and waved at the crowd as he and his teammates did a lap of the pitch. It was about fifty/fifty whether any given announcer would treat him like a normal player or a superstar, but he didn’t let it rile him like it would have a decade ago. He wasn’t about to let his annoyance at being singled out throw him off his game.
“Yes—sugar for the jam stars, snowflakes, and stained glass; gingerbread for the men, trees, bells, and wreaths.”
They whiled away the hours on darts and pool. Harry contemplated faking terrible form at the billiards table just to get Draco to curve his body over Harry’s to guide him—as he had for Luna at one point before she decided she preferred darts—but his competitive streak won out, and they ended up in a fierce best-of-three battle for domination. At some point, Blaise disappeared to play bartender, coming back with a variety of complicated cocktails tailored to each of their specific tastes, giving the room the air of a private club of some sort.
“I agree.” Harry considered it for a moment before pulling his wand and transfiguring the centaurs into fauns. He paused. “Fauns aren’t real, right?”
The four of them looked uncomplicatedly happy, grinning and laughing as they worked. The picture perfectly captured the spirit of the moment, the sense of home and family that Draco had felt. He thought back but couldn’t remember Harry even having a camera with him that day, let alone photographing them. He looked up at Harry. “How—?”
Harry let his mind wander as the minutes ticked by, the only sounds in the room those of brushes and drawing implements moving against paper and canvas. This was the last group date of the show; after this, he would be on to one-on-one dates with people. For some reason, the thought made his stomach drop a bit. It all felt more real all of a sudden. It had been easy to lose himself in the dynamic of the group, spending time with people here and there, but he hadn’t had to make any hard decisions yet. Rejecting people after really getting to know them felt more personal. And what if, when they spent more time with him, people rejected
Harry pulled Draco in by the lapels of his jacket, glowering. Draco laughed victoriously. From where he was standing with Luna, observing the scene, Neville shook his head disbelievingly.
Draco shrugged, not looking at him as he got to his feet. “You weren’t in your rooms. There weren’t that many other places you were likely to be, and the hot tub made sense from how you were moving when the class was over.”
“Huh,” Harry teased, trying not to sound giddy as he pulled his shirt over his head, “I didn’t realize you were such a prude.”
“Share what?” she asked, smiling, but looking at the old brick building in confusion. “Are we leaving from here?”
Draco thought of his mother coated in the smelly liquid the stones spurted and tried not to laugh. “I don’t know that Gobstones is the game for her.”
Draco grimaced at the thought. “They might have gone to bed?” he said, knowing that they wouldn’t have.
Backing away quickly, he bumped into a shelf, sending several glass somethings rolling to the floor behind him.
They chatted about parenthood a bit, and Harry was pleased to hear that Leela did, eventually, want kids of her own. “Not for a good few years, though, I don’t think,” she told him. “I’m just getting started in my career, and pregnancy isn’t all that conducive to working in a hot, crowded kitchen full of the smell of cooking food, from what I’ve heard.”
The hand disappeared. “You’re going to leave here with someone amazing,” Draco told him. “I’m sure of it.”
“Hmm?” Draco glanced up. “Oh. Checking in. But you seem cheerful enough, so I assume everything went well?” He went back to studying the pieces in front of him.
Of course he should have a gift for Harry. Even if they hadn’t been… doing whatever it was they were doing… he was still spending Christmas morning with them. But what the hell did you get for your childhood-rival-turned-friend-turned…
His lover, Max, looked up at him with furrowed eyebrows from where he was still sprawled on the mattress next to him, breathing as though he’d just run a marathon. Draco spared half a moment to lament the fact that exertion often had no correlation whatsoever to satisfaction.
Harry grinned. “I just realized that since you’re a personal trainer, if you were a Muggle, you’d actually be pretty aware of them. Athletes use them as performance enhancers sometimes. I think it’s illegal though?”
“That was part of it,” Luna agreed, and Harry wished he could sink through the floor and deep into the ground. In his peripheral vision, he saw Draco squeeze his eyes shut.
Draco gave a disapproving sniff but returned to his place against the counter without removing the offending item. “What are you making?”
She sighed. “No, I suppose they wouldn’t have.” Her face immediately brightened, however. “Well. You’re all in for a treat, then. Ron, come help me?”
She sighed and walked over to the bed, perching on the edge. “It just doesn’t feel right, does it? You’re such a lovely person, and you’re very attractive—even though I know you don’t think so,” she added as he instinctually opened his mouth to object. “And I really like spending time with you. I don’t want you to think that I don’t. I’d quite like to be friends, actually, once we’re out of here. If you wanted. But, well. There’s no… spark, is there?”
“Yeah, a very public date at a very large event that will be full of a hell of a lot of reporters from publications that I don’t work for and therefore can’t make leave me alone. It’d be a publicity nightmare. I’ve put up with the whole circus a few times for people I was actually
“Oh!” Draco relaxed, looking very pleased with himself. He sat back on his haunches and licked his lips, looking down at Harry consideringly. “What’s your refractory period usually like?”
“Got it,” Harry confirmed. He still felt a bit off kilter; it was like Pansy expected him to fight her on this, or something.
“Oh, no, hang on,” Harry said, climbing to his feet from where he’d been sitting with Ron and Hermione, discussing a project that she wanted to embark on and that Ron really wished that she wouldn’t. Frankly, he was happy for the chance to step out of the middle of it. “There are more tucked away in one of the cupboards, I’ll go grab them. Be right back.”
Draco was laughing by the time they reached the bottom. “Calm down, the presents aren’t going anywhere!” He could smell coffee and cinnamon, reminding him instantly of waking up at Harry’s flat two mornings ago. He put the ache of it aside. It was too early in the day to be melancholy. “Am I allowed to have breakfast first?”
ed. “Maybe someday. For now I’m just really enjoying having this time with Teddy, you know? He’s at a really fun age, and hanging out with him gives me an excuse to do all sorts of stuff I didn’t get to do when I was a kid.”
I’m not going to be producing any grandchildren. And even if I were, you’re barely past fifty—it’s not as though you’re in your dotage.”
“Art done by professionals,” Harry argued. He felt like his whole body was burning with preemptive embarrassment. “With models who knew what they were getting into.”
Disclaimer: I worked in finance in a past life (think over a decade ago) and it was not investment banking, so I’m being as vague as possible because I don’t know what I’m talking about. I do, however, have
“Harry?” Draco asked, and Harry startled, dropping the niffler onto the table, where it bounced and rolled slightly.
Now that Draco had given up on his reluctance to admit to or pursue his interest in Harry, at least for the time being, their conversation was light and open and full of teasing flirtation. Draco made a point of touching Harry faux-casually whenever he could manage—a brush of fingertips here, a thumb swiping a drop of wine from a lip there—and drawing attention to his best features at every opportunity, stretching and lounging and basically doing whatever he could think of until Harry looked like he was contemplating just pulling him over the table. Not, Draco thought as he surveyed the way that Harry’s biceps moved under his thin jumper, that he was doing much better.
The wizard waved his wand over something that Draco couldn’t see, nodded, and picked up two leather-bound menus. “This way, please.”
Draco bought them a second round shortly thereafter, and then Harry grabbed them a third while Draco was in the loo and couldn’t object. Their conversation flowed easily, something that was becoming less surprising to Draco each time it happened. He really liked Harry, he thought again as the evening wore on.
Meeting was also complicated—they couldn’t go anywhere public together, at least not in the Wizarding districts, and even venturing out into Muggle London would be risky; they were both too high profile to be sure they wouldn’t be followed by nosy press. However, as Draco was staying with his parents, and Harry was staying with Ron and Hermione, neither of their current residences were ideal, either.
“Pose, Harry! The more dynamic, the better. You don’t have to hold for very long for gesture drawings, so you can do all sorts of things.” Harry just stared at her, still standing stock still with his arms hanging at his sides. “No,” she said after considering him for a moment. “That won’t do. Try doing a runner’s lunge?”
“YES!” Teddy yelled, fist in the air, and Draco shook his head, smiling. He thought, wistfully, that he missed the neverending energy of childhood.
When they’d ended up split the same way they had been on their way in, Draco had given him a smug smirk before climbing into the SUV, leaving Harry staring after him pleadingly. He did
Narcissa raised a questioning eyebrow and he grinned, realizing that his gossip would more than make up for his perceived misstep in his mother’s eyes. “George—the one who owns the joke shop? Has apparently become rather…
“Not my most subtle move,” Draco agreed. “I do think I’d prefer that Teddy not know, though, if that’s alright. I don’t want him to think—” He trailed off, unsure how to finish that sentence.
“Yeah, not sharing that story, though. Too embarrassing. Maybe some other day—if you’re lucky, and I’m a little drunk.”
Before too long, they came to a flower-covered archway standing incongruously between two massive trees. Harry gave Draco a puzzled look as he led them toward it, but Draco just smiled and pulled him through.
Malfoy shot a mischievous smile his way. “Why bother? I know what I like, and I go for it. Save the games for the pitch.”
,” Draco repeated, sounding baffled and upset. “Their motorcycle has disappeared. Their room is empty. They’re just
Harry’s shocked exclamation was drowned out by the surprised murmuring of the others, but Blaise ignored them all. “Place them in this box here, and you may go in.”
“People who think they’re the protagonist and everyone else is just a supporting character,” Draco replied, and Harry laughed, curling further into him.
“Yeah,” Harry said, breathing heavily. “Yeah, just… give me a sec. It’s been awhile.” He let his head fall back against the pillows, and Draco, despite looking thoroughly wrecked already, managed to smirk down at him.
There was a peremptory knock on the door before Pansy pushed it open and entered, followed closely by Draco Malfoy. She looked at Harry—who had been pacing the room for what felt like years—consideringly before twirling one finger at him. “Turn around, let me see.”
“Oh, just hold your hand out for her to sniff. Once she’s familiar with your scent you can pet her.”
“I can’t believe you arseholes made me come as Xander,” Ron grumbled, picking unhappily at his oversized, printed button-down where it hung open over an oddly fitting t-shirt. “Xander’s a tit.”
After a few runs, Teddy had insisted on racing, but quickly called foul as Harry and Draco’s greater weight had given them the gravitational advantage. Heading off the beginnings of a pout, Harry had returned the disks and secured them a larger family toboggan instead—one which the teen manning the shack insisted could fit up to four people comfortably. Their combined weight, Harry had explained to Teddy, would make them go much faster than any one of them on their own.
Draco melted into it, his hands rising to frame Harry’s face, thumbs caressing his temples, lips parting to allow Harry entrance. Harry poured all of his tangled emotions into it, not wanting to stop, but eventually having to as the need for air became a somewhat pressing concern.
Draco didn’t let go of him right away, though. Instead, he held Harry’s head still, raising his other hand and swiping a thumb along his split bottom lip, making Harry flinch. Draco raised the hand in front of Harry’s face, showing him the streak of blood across his pale skin.
fault you aren’t getting laid.” For half a second, Harry thought that her gaze had flicked toward Draco, but he quickly dismissed the idea as paranoia. Ginny snorted, burying her face in her girlfriend’s clavicle.
“Yeah, of course. Erm, kitchen?” Harry looked a bit nauseous, but led the way out of the front room toward the back of the house. Draco threw up a quick privacy charm, not positive that he could trust his mother not to eavesdrop. As soon as he dropped his wand, Harry turned to him. He looked tired and anxious, and before Draco could even open his mouth, he started apologizing. “I want to say sorry if I did or said anything last night that I maybe shouldn’t have,” he said, all in a rush, “I woke up this morning and realized I think I talked to you for quite a while but I honestly don’t have any idea what I said and you seem really uncomfortable and I—”
less than a foot away from him, especially when he could still feel the ghost of his heat on his skin.
“Oh! Sure.” A walk actually sounded nice, Harry thought; the wine was starting to go to his head, and moving around a bit might help sober him up. He had a vague inkling that there was some reason going off alone with Romilda might not be a great plan, but he couldn’t quite remember what it was in his mildly-sloshed state, so he shrugged it off.
“Yeah, well, you wouldn’t, would you? Considering they were mostly talking about how clearly you were mooning over me.” Harry grinned and wiggled his eyebrows.
Draco rang the bell, but heard no response for several long moments. He rang again, and then, when there was still no answer, looked at his watch, worrying that he’d gotten the time wrong. Finally, though, Harry answered the door with a sheepish smile, wearing jeans and in bare feet, an apron protecting his soft grey jumper. His sleeves were rolled up to his elbows and his hands and forearms were dusted in flour, and Draco was immediately charmed out of his impending irritation. Leaning in to kiss his cheek in greeting but keeping his hands to himself, Harry ushered him inside.
“None; although, in my defense, I can’t see why I would have been on the alert. I was a producer, for Merlin’s sake! I just assumed—naively, apparently—that that meant I was in the loop on all of the goings on. But my
“Really captures my essence,” Harry agreed. “Great job with the face.” He nodded at the tiny, cartoonish lightning bolt and thick circles that were obviously meant to indicate his glasses. “The resemblance is uncanny. It’s like looking in a mirror.” He let his gaze drift lower and snorted as he realized that the stick man also had a rather prominent penis. “Well, most of it anyway.”
“Honestly? I’m ashamed of how I behaved. Watching the episode where I was eliminated was a real wake up call. My family and friends were
“Hey,” Harry asked after a while, a thought coming to him. “Is it weird if I ask you a question about the other contestants?”
He could see Draco smirk slightly out of the corner of his eye, even in the dim light of the moon. “I thought Gryffindors were supposed to be brave.”
Draco grumbled, pushing Harry partially off of him so that he could reach his wand. “I hate conjured lube.”
“Damn.” Harry tipped his head back, squinting up at the sky. “Rest here for a bit, row to the beach, and Apparate back?”
Harry hadn’t ended up going flying; it hadn’t seemed so appealing once he’d gotten outside, so he’d gone with his plan of reading and relaxing in the sun. He was glad he had; the day of rest had left him reinvigorated for his next group date—a day out on a yacht. It was essentially just more time to get to know the contestants, but with the camera-friendly lure of scantily clad people sunbathing on the deck and potential solo shots of various contestants staring pensively out over the water as their hair blew in the wind. It wasn’t exactly a physically taxing plan, but Harry knew that he’d be passed from person to person all day long as they tried to get in some quality time with him before eliminations, so he would need his energy.
Draco’s face went even redder as he waved Harry off. “I’m fine,” he answered hoarsely. “Let’s go. Crew’s waiting.”
The announcer was saying something, but Harry wasn’t listening; his full focus was on Lee and the Healers. He only snapped out of his stupor when the angry booing of the crowd was joined by an incensed exclamation from Montague. Harry looked up to see him gesticulating wildly at Ron, who had his arms crossed over his chest as he watched impassively. Capulet was standing beside them, looking smug.
And so here he stood, waiting nervously in an intimidatingly posh bedroom in an intimidatingly modern mansion in Brighton, waiting to try his hand at dating fourteen people at once in the hope of finding true love under the watchful eyes of thousands of wix around the UK.
By the time Teddy and Draco had circled the pond twice, Harry seemed to have found his stride and was able to manage a much more reasonable pace. “What do you think, Teds?” he asked them as they pulled up beside him.
Harry snickered and squeezed the tender skin, forcing an embarrassingly needy whimper from Draco, before moving his thumbs inward to brush the edges of his exposed hole. “What do you want?” he asked, holding Draco’s gaze.
good that he could barely breath. Harry pounded into him again and again and all Draco could do was lie there and take it, feeling his orgasm build with every thrust. His skin was sticky and slippery with sweat and his legs were shaking and he both never wanted it to stop and didn’t know if he could hold on.
Ron exited their room just in time to see her trudging past and laughed. “Told you that wouldn’t work,” he called after her, snickering as she flicked two fingers at him without turning around.
“No, really! Well, sort of, anyway. The Malfoys do own the vineyard, but I’m not involved in the actual production.”
Andromeda gave a wry smile, immediately surmising what—or who, rather—the interruption had likely been. Her look quickly turned probing, however. “So, you wouldn’t have stopped him?”
The London offices of Kashburn & Costleigh were located in the Muggle financial district due to their heavy use of Muggle technology and the fact that they traded in both magical and Muggle assets. It was one of the reasons that they’d grown so rapidly in recent years: the complete separation of magical and Muggle financial systems had always been a massive headache for people living with feet in both worlds, and K&C provided wix with the ability to manage their wealth across systems without getting on the bad side of either government.
“Don’t be stupid.” Malfoy patted the stone bench next to himself. When Harry had settled, he turned slightly to study him. “So, sworn enemies again, then?”
Draco stood and stared at the chalkboard for a while when he got back to his desk. Then, he picked up his eraser and carefully removed one tally from his own side.
After a bit of squabbling and several attempts to rearrange luggage, the group finally managed to split themselves into two vehicles: Hermione chauffeuring Ron, Draco, Luna, and Greg in a rather large SUV, and Harry, Ginny, Pansy, and Blaise taking a little economy car that Harry felt much more comfortable driving. Much to their chagrin, the rest of the group had unanimously decided that Harry and Draco would likely crash the car if they tried to drive together (Harry chose to believe that this was another commentary on their bickering and not on his distractibility when Draco was within view), and they were therefore relegated to separate vehicles.
It was soft and warm and lovely and Draco thought it might actually kill him. Harry’s lips moved gently against his, sweet and smoky, a memory of sugar and scotch over something that was just...
“Of course,” Draco said after an awkward pause, ushering him into the parlour. They stood uncomfortably facing each other for a moment before Draco hesitantly offered, “Would you like some tea?”
Draco sputtered something unintelligible, and Harry could feel himself flushing bright red. “We do not—”
them, but they’re innocuous enough that you wouldn’t realize that they were anything special if you didn’t know what you were looking for. That archway we came through, for instance, is invisible to Muggles.” Draco gave Harry a wry smile. “Most people only find them when they’re invited by someone who’s already been. It’s all very secretive and exclusive.”
The days off between dates hadn’t been something Harry understood when the filming schedule had been explained to him, but he was immensely grateful for them when he woke up the next morning, bone-tired and a bit sore from running around on the Quidditch field, swimming, and dodging unhinged contestants with very unhealthy visions of what love looked like. He gave an inadvertent shudder at the memory and was thankful, once more, that the crew had followed him and Romilda on their little adventure.
Something twisted uncomfortably inside Harry. “I don’t think…” He trailed off, unsure how to finish the thought.  “That’s not really my style,” he finally settled on.
“Technically, they’re aquatic macrophytes,” Hermione told him without looking up from the nature guide she had apparently switched to while he was changing. “There’s a whole section in here on the various species, if you—”
“Sorry,” Perry said, rubbing his eyes, “that was shitty. In my defense, I’m in the process of being rejected.” He sighed. “I just meant… you really don’t have any sense of how people see you, do you?”
Harry shook his head in confusion, but then heard Ron call his name from across the way and got up to go see what he wanted, quickly forgetting the odd moment.
Hermione took charge of the pizza cutter, carefully rolling it to slice the pie into ten even pieces.
“Well, I’m glad they did their job. I would have been deeply disappointed if they hadn’t. I’ve never failed to pull in those trousers.”
Harry cackled as he flipped the contents of the pan. “Long after we broke up, I promise. It was, uh—” he rubbed the back of his neck, looking sheepish. “—well, a commentary on my perpetual singleness, actually. She told me that if no one was going to be here in the mornings I might as well be comfortable.” He shrugged one shoulder. “She’s terrible, but she wasn’t wrong; it’s comfortable as hell.”
“I don’t think it’s much further,” Hermione answered, sounding less than entirely confident. “The path’s gotten quite steep, which should mean we’re nearing the summit. Once we reach the top, there’s supposed to be a spectacular view.” She cast a guilty eye over her obviously-exhausted companions. “But we can Apparate back, I suppose, if everyone is done.”
Looking over the wine list, Draco tapped his wand against a bottle that looked promising. It promptly appeared on the table, nestled in a bucket of ice. Two glasses popped into existence seconds later. Harry looked startled.
“That might be the nicest thing you’ve ever said to me.” Harry pinched Draco’s side and Draco wriggled, trying to shove him off.
“I just need a few more minutes,” Draco told them both, staying where he was. Harry tried not to sigh. He could handle a few more minutes; it would be fine.
Turning to see what they were looking at, Harry’s eyes caught on a head of extremely familiar white-blond hair. White-blond hair that had been slicked back, not like it had been back in school, but in a way that managed to look edgy. White-blond hair that topped the head of a tall, thin man in a long leather duster, jeans, and beat up combat boots. “Oh no,” he said, eyes narrowing. “Absolutely not.”
of negotiation amongst the adults, they decided that if I wanted to keep pursuing dance, Auntie Amani would tutor me in magic so that I would know how to use my powers safely. As I got older, I felt a bit isolated, not being able to tell any of my friends about that part of myself, so I asked her to start introducing me to people in the wizarding world. Now I live a bit on both sides. It’s unconventional, but it works for me.”
He hadn’t minded, at first, taking their good natured ribbing in stride. By the time he was 26, however, he’d started to find it a bit depressing. By then, many of his friends were partnered or married, and some—including Ron and Hermione—had begun starting families of their own. The more times his face had graced the cover of the magazine, the more pathetic and lonely he’d felt. When he’d been informed of his tenth win shortly after his 29th birthday, he couldn’t decide whether he was dejected by his perpetual singledom or oddly relieved that they hadn’t given him up as a lost cause.
“Why would you even bring that?” Draco asked petulantly as Harry pulled the device from his back pocket. Mobile phones were becoming more common in wizarding society, but Draco had yet to give in to the trend. He didn’t fancy the idea of being accessible to anyone at any hour of the day.
Harry ran a thumb across Draco’s bottom lip and then leaned in to kiss him. “No,” he said with a smirk as he pulled back.
“Morning, Andromeda,” came Harry’s voice as Teddy’s footsteps pounded up the stairs. “He’s a bit wound up, sorry.” He sounded sheepish.
as Jack (she uses she/her, but has heavy andro-butch energy. Jack is… well, who knows). If you head cast any of the other characters, I’d love to hear who!
Harry smiled, looking up from where he was seated next to Draco at the peninsula, engaged in an ongoing battle over the fork and knife Draco kept trying to use to eat his pizza. “You read my mind, Gin,” he said, even as he—once again—removed the fork from Draco’s hands and held it well away from him. “No! This is not fork food. Use your hands like a normal person.”
Hermione laughed. “I'm 99% sure they were named by a Muggleborn who thought they were funny. Anyway, they’re supposed to be lovely, but I’ve never been on one. I don’t suppose anyone knows how to sail it?”
“Good. Today counts as your rest day; your first date will be tomorrow with Jack. The dates will happen in pairs, two days back to back, and you’ll have the third day off. We’ll have Blaise do your interviews on the evenings of your rest days so you have time to gather your thoughts or whatever.” She waved a dismissive hand, as though this part of the process was something she didn’t understand the need for but was humoring nonetheless. “After that, we’ll do the ceremony, and you’ll keep one of the contestants and eliminate the other. Got it?”
Harry awoke to a warm, heavy weight across his chest and the tickle of fine hair against his nose. He experienced exactly six seconds of confusion before the pieces fell into place and his whole body tensed.
Potter’s skill on the pitch, impressive even at eleven, had only grown over time, and Draco couldn’t help but stare at the photographs of him in the newspapers—lithe and agile and fast as fuck as he shot after the snitch like his life depended on it. More than once, he’d found himself wondering what it would be like playing against him now, with their childhood firmly behind them and only a love of the game driving them forward. And if he’d also found himself wondering what he looked like out of his Quidditch leathers from time to time, well, who could blame him?
Harry rubbed his eyes and reached for his glasses. “Yeah, alright.” He blinked at her, ruffling his hair sleepily. “Where have you been all day, anyway?”
The Ogden’s distillery is loosely based on a combination of the Jameson’s distillery and the Guinness brewery, which are both popular tourist attractions and therefore have exhibitions of the companies’ history which I thought were really interesting when I was in Dublin for the first time. Highly recommend if you’re ever there!
Harry threw him one last worried look, but, at Pansy’s impatient gesture, followed her out, trying to wear her down and let him enlarge the shorts a bit before the cameras began rolling.
The small smile that Malfoy gave him at that was, Harry thought, perhaps the most genuine expression he’d ever seen on him. “I’d like that.”
“Not on the boat!” Blaise cried, scandalized. Harry rolled his eyes and turned on the spot, visualizing the bathroom on the ground floor of the house.
They had spun their way down the hills over and over, sometimes sliding to a smooth stop, sometimes tipping ungracefully into piles of soft, pristine snow. Harry’s delighted grin had never left his face. They’d taken turns hauling Teddy, and each other, to their feet, and Harry’s eyes had twinkled with joy and what Draco thought might be affection—an affection that, inexplicably, didn’t seem to be directed solely at Teddy. Draco had found himself grinning back helplessly, his inability to tamp down the exhilaration of it all leaving him open, unguarded.
Sullivan looked down at him, eyes skimming up and down his body. Harry got the feeling that he was remembering what exactly was underneath his clothes, and his heart stuttered a bit. “Not if you’re offering,” Sullivan replied, smiling. He quickly swigged the rest of the drink in his hand and set the glass back down on the bar top. Harry took his hand and pulled him toward the dance floor.
“Luna!” Harry wrapped his friend in a tight hug. “I didn’t know you’d be teaching today.” He hadn’t realized just how much he missed his friends, but the sight of Luna—with her paint and glitter streaked dress, floral print wellies, and plethora of paint brushes and pencils sticking out of her thick, frizzy braid—welcomed him like a warm bath on a cold day.
Harry laughs into his shoulder. “No—I don’t, do I? Between the Weasleys and Hermione and Teddy and Andromeda and… and you.”
Hilde had been quiet as Harry told her about the camp, but once he’d finished his summary, she’d finally spoken up, voice flat. “So, this is our date. Hanging out in this old school and taking care of a bunch of kids.”
“That was the only time, though,” Harry said. “He just had… I dunno, some weird baggage about school. I’m sorry you had to hear it.”
didn’t.” There had been a number of moments like this, in recent months, and Parvati kept insisting that Harry was flirting with Draco. For his part, Draco kept insisting that she mind her own business, because she obviously could not read Harry Potter
“It is a bit unusual, I know, but I have always loved small luxuries. I met a lovely woman in Paris who designed the most poignant scents, and she agreed to take me on as an apprentice.”
“Just in time!” Greg announced, stepping back from the oven and pulling out a long, flat peel with a perfectly golden margherita pizza at its end. Carefully, he slid it onto a waiting platter. “Someone cut that up; I’ll go prep the next one.”
“We weren’t always so insular,” he admitted as they paused on a newly-constructed bridge across the lake, “despite what many of the old families would have us believe. There have always been those drawn to power, no matter who wielded it.” He leant against the wall, looking out across the water.
Harry narrowed his eyes at her. Over the years, he’d come to realize that she took more than a little after Fred and George, and he found the glint in her eye rather suspect. Ron, however—rather naively, in Harry’s opinion—seemed to take her word for it. Taking a running start, he cannonballed off the end of the pier, sending up a wave of murky water that (luckily for him) didn’t quite reach where Blaise was distributing margaritas.
Harry looked down at his puzzle, sighing at how very ineffective it had been at distracting him from his inner turmoil. Before he could question himself, he was asking Draco, “What are you doing with your day?”
“I mean, not entirely. I’m certainly not all sunshine, so I wouldn’t want someone else to be. I’d like to find someone with a similar sense of humor to mine—a bit dark or snarky sometimes, but not mean-spirited. I don’t even mind if they’re a bit of a dick sometimes; Merlin knows I can be. I just need to know that their heart is in the right place.”
Harry laughed. “I probably shouldn’t tell everyone that you got them in order with a trick you usually use on children, should I?”
Shortly after Harry took a final look in the mirror, deciding that this was as good as it was going to get, Blaise and the crew arrived. As the crew set up, Harry found himself appreciating, not for the first time, that Draco and Pansy didn’t have them Disillusion themselves until the actual date began. Conducting interviews to an audience of zero would have been too uncanny.
“Mother. I appreciate your wish to see me happy. Truly. But I’m going back to New York in three weeks. I would prefer that you not try to matchmake while I’m home. I’d rather spend the time I have here with you and Andromeda and Teddy. Alright?”
“I am not above resorting to violence,” Draco warned over his shoulder as Harry’s fingers lingered unnervingly close to his ribcage.
“I see. Then I assume the elves should restock the bedroom drawer when they reset?” Something about Draco’s voice seemed slightly off.
Smith is a wanker of the highest order, and I deeply regret not being there to see the whole thing myself. I might make you Pensieve it for me.”
Harry pulled him down for another kiss, trailing his hands down his back to cup his arse briefly before running them down his thighs. Draco hummed in approval, sliding his own hands into Harry’s tangle of curls. They kissed for long minutes, deeply, leisurely, simply enjoying the dance of lips and tongues. Eventually, though, Harry’s hands drifted back towards Draco’s arse, one finger slipping into his crease before he made a surprised noise as he hit slicked skin.
“Did I?” Draco asked innocently. “Oh dear. There might be more elsewhere; you should probably check. I wouldn’t want to get your sheets dirty.”
Harry glanced at his watch. It was 1:45. What was going on? He looked around, hoping that one of the unseen crew might tell him something. It was quiet on the street, the show having secured a solo tour for Harry and Jack to avoid potential interference from other guests. If Harry concentrated hard enough, he could hear the small sounds of his invisible companions—shuffling feet here, a yawn there—and then, suddenly, a hushed but panicked sounding conversation that he couldn’t make out followed by the distinctive
Harry lingered near the back of the group as Hermione forged a path forward, wielding her field guide and pointing out different plants and birds as they went, keeping up a running commentary on the ecosystem. He loved her enthusiasm, but he was content to soak in the atmosphere without putting a name to every bit of wildlife. Also, despite its beauty, as they delved deeper into the woods the hike became increasingly grueling, with the path growing steeper the further they went.
The kiss was just as good as Draco remembered. Better, maybe. Harry kissed him soft and slow and thorough, hands traversing along the path from his hip bones to his ribs and back again as their mouths moved against each other. Draco met his pace for as long as he could manage, but it wasn’t long before he was nearly desperate for more. As much as he loathed to admit it, though, he enjoyed this game of Harry’s—the push and pull of it, Harry holding teasingly back and forcing him to take what he wanted. So he let his fingers trace the length of Harry’s neck before sliding one hand into his hair and using the other to hold his jaw, taking the lead and deepening the kiss, demonstrating the sense of urgency within him that kept escalating the longer Harry’s warm body was pressed against his. Harry smiled into it before quickly spinning them so that Draco’s back was against the low wall and Harry had retaken control. He broke the kiss but moved even closer, running the tip of his nose up Draco’s neck to the sensitive skin behind his ear before biting softly at the tendon.
Several minutes later, Harry, Luna, and Draco joined the rest of their friends on the patio, where they were scattered across the chairs and sofas ringing the space. A table in the center held an array of glasses and plates, and Draco and Harry deposited the bottles of wine they’d collected next to them.
into his head, and he’d had to drown them in vodka, and then he’d had to… he wasn’t sure. Have some sort of drunken heart-to-heart with Potter that he couldn’t remember a word of but was afraid might have been humiliating enough to require fleeing the country? The problem was that he didn’t
Once he’d submerged himself up to his neck in the now rather large tub, Blaise sighed contentedly before saying, “So, there appears to have been a bit of a mix-up with the luggage. Mine seems to have been left behind at the portkey station.”
“It’s just a date, not a marriage proposal,” Draco told him. Why was Potter being so difficult about this?
“Fine,” Draco said, impressed with himself for getting even the single word out through the blinding pain.
“Oh, I don’t know.” Sadiyah smiled. “In another life, Harry and I probably could have been good together, but I knew the writing was on the wall ages before we got to the end of things.”
“Thanks,” Harry sighed, letting his eyes close. From Pansy, he knew that that was the closest to approval he was going to get, so he decided he’d take it.
was different. And the things that he’d preferred about the magical community in New York—the smoother integration with Muggle culture and technology, for one—were beginning to take root in the UK, as well.
Lost in his musings, Harry didn’t notice that someone was approaching him until he heard a voice that, despite the many years since he’d last encountered it, he’d know anywhere.
Harry had been right. The speed that they were traveling at was far beyond what they had attained on their individual sleds. The wind of their passing pulled at his face, almost burning in its intensity, and it was
Harry looked around to make sure none of the kids had heard her before taking her arm and leading her out into the hall. “Please don’t talk like that in front of them,” he said once the door had closed behind them. “A lot of these kids feel unwanted as it is. You have no idea how much you could hurt them if they overheard you. Now, want to tell me what’s going on?”
“Oh. Yeah, okay. Thank you. I’m, uh— I’m heading into the workshop. If he asks.” Harry sounded disappointed, and Draco felt a knot in his stomach.
There were few enough people left, now, that Pansy had decided a formal cocktail party would feel unnatural. Instead, she had—much to Harry’s dismay—decided that they would all go out dancing. She hadn’t even had the decency to tell him to his face, probably knowing that he would fight her on it; instead a young, nervous-looking crew member had come by his room to break the news before scurrying quickly away without giving him time to react.
Later on, when Harry ventured into the kitchen to find them some food, he found a short note sitting on the counter.
The three squeezed him in between themselves, and the silliness of it did actually make Harry feel a bit better. “Thanks,” he said as they pulled back. “If any of you have horrifying sides I haven’t seen yet, now would be a great time to tell me.”
Ginny wandered in from somewhere and looked over Harry’s shoulder at the list of options. “Can we do pizza?”
And if he were living here, he would be close to his family, and his friends, and— He closed his eyes and took a deep breath.
When Oliver returned with two fresh pints, they fell into a light conversation on their lives and mutual acquaintances—somewhat one-sided, as Harry had been abroad for so long, but he thoroughly enjoyed the tidbits of gossip that Oliver had managed to absorb into the small parts of his brain that weren’t completely focused on Quidditch. Harry was about halfway through his beer, listening in amusement as Oliver animatedly related a story involving Percy Weasley, a pair of Nifflers, and an ill-advised bet, when a silvery hare appeared next to their table.
“No one even reads the gossip section,” Ron assured him. Harry raised a disbelieving eyebrow, and Ron grimaced and capitulated. “Well, no one that matters, anyway. I only found it because I was keeping an eye out for you.”
“Sir is very welcome, I’m sure.” Dilly disappeared with a snap of her fingers. Shortly thereafter, a tray containing toast, fruit, a pot of tea, a small jug of orange juice, and a bowl of porridge smelling of cinnamon appeared on the low table of the sitting area.
“I’m not hiding,” Harry said, petulant, but he didn’t sound convincing to even himself, so he was unsurprised by Draco’s disbelieving snort. He sighed. “She wanted to talk about my
Draco stared at the object in his hands. It was a gorgeous, obviously handmade picture frame decorated with an intricate pattern of delicately carved branches and leaves. The leaves were so detailed that they looked almost alive, and when Draco touched them, they fluttered as though they’d been caught in a passing breeze. At the bottom there was an inscription: ‘Black Family Christmas, 2006.’ Draco looked down in awe at the photograph contained within—a moving image of him, Andromeda, his mother, and Teddy decorating the Christmas tree together.
In which our contestants partake in a game of Ground Quidditch, with mixed results. Also, there’s swimming.
“S’mores,” Hermione told them, her voice taking on the tone it tended to when she was excited to share her knowledge about something, “are a Muggle campfire treat. They’re actually fairly American, so I suppose it’s not surprising you aren’t familiar with them. I learned about them from an American film when I was small and insisted that my parents make them with me the next time we went camping.”
“That sounds… interesting.” Draco knew his trepidation was audible, but Pansy just gave him a knowing smile.
“Er, not bad?” Harry’s cock twitched against his stomach. The bluntness of the question really shouldn’t’ve have been so hot, should it? “This isn’t really a
Harry bit his lip, absorbing everything Draco had laid out before him, and then sighed. “Yeah, I get it. I worried about that when Ginny and I split—like, with the Weasleys, and with our friends. I mean it was fine in the end, obviously, but it was a risk I don’t know if I would have taken if I hadn’t been sixteen and an idiot when we got together.” He gave a wry half-smile.
In response, Draco leaned over and nipped a corner off the piece in Harry’s hand before he could protest. He chewed thoughtfully, licking his lips as he considered. “Perhaps a bit?”
Blaise grinned at him approvingly. “Well, let’s not keep everyone waiting! Why don’t we head in and begin your quest for true love?”
It started slow, Harry’s palm gentle against his jaw and his lips warm and soft against Draco’s, but somehow it still felt a bit like the ground was crumbling under his feet. At the first swipe of Harry’s tongue, Draco thought his vision might have whited out. Soon, unable to take Harry’s leisurely exploration any longer, he pulled Harry closer, taking the kiss deeper. Harry laughed a little but still reciprocated enthusiastically, his hands moving to Draco’s waist to bring their bodies flush.
Their lips meeting felt like coming home. Harry had thought that he was very out of practice at being kissed, that that was why it felt so odd when Sullivan and Perry had done it. But as Draco made a quiet, pained sort of noise and leaned into him—kissing him harder, more deeply, his hands making their way to Harry’s waist, fingers gripping tightly, pulling him in—Harry knew that practice had nothing to do with it. He slid his hands into Draco’s silky hair, tugging him even closer, opening his mouth to him, inviting him in. Draco’s tongue slipped past his lips, and Harry thought hazily that it felt long, long overdue.
Pansy rolled her eyes. “Students use nude models as well. And besides, you’ve already been in front of all of these people in your swim trunks.”
—was, blessedly, only a few inches long at the beginning of the gossip section, paired with a small photo of him stalking away from a pissed-off looking blond man. Harry always thought that the section name was a bit redundant; the entire
“You’re safe to look at my face as much as you like,” Draco assured him, and then felt himself blush what was probably a very seasonal shade of red. “Merlin and Morgana, forget I said that immediately.”
Harry turned onto his side, curling an arm around Draco’s waist and tangling their legs together. “I guess I’ll live,” he said with an exaggerated sigh, and Draco poked him in the side, making him laugh. “Of course I want you to stay.” Waving a lazy hand, he summoned a blanket, letting it drop over them. Draco felt sticky with sweat and sex, but as he felt his eyelids droop, he found he didn’t care. He’d deal with it in the morning.
The interview with Blaise was fairly straightforward at first, his disastrous date with Perry giving them no shortage of material. However, Harry was thrown for a loop when, after a few questions about Jack’s bizarre disappearance, Blaise casually brought up his non-date with Draco.
“Hmm.” Blaise looked pensive, in a studied sort of way. “Too little in common in some ways, too much in others.”
Returning his hand to its place on the wheel and turning in his seat to face the rest of the group, Blaise asked, “Are we ready to stop for a while?” They were out in the middle of the lake, expanses of sun-glittering water stretching out in all directions. Their house was just visible on the horizon. The idea had been that they would stop somewhere where the water was deeper so that they could swim while avoiding the worst of the slimy underwater plants that coated the lake’s floor.
Harry didn’t hear Dermot’s reply; the pair had moved away and were drowned out by the sounds of chairs and paper being moved around. By the time he emerged, everyone had found seats behind the various easels set up around the room.
“That was spectacular,” Draco answered him, smiling and kissing him back. “But if you give me a few minutes it will be even better.”
“Draco, wait.” Harry put a hand on his arm as he turned to go, and Draco looked back at him. Harry met his gaze and then glanced up at the leaves dangling above them again. “Isn’t it bad luck or something to ignore mistletoe?”
After the debacle with Romilda, Harry was realizing that he needed to be more proactive in how he spent his time within the group, rather than just letting himself be pulled along by whomever was the pushiest. With that in mind, his first move on the boat was to join Perry at the front of the top deck, where he sat with his legs dangling under the guard rail, looking out over the water. His dark, wavy hair was pulled back in a knot, but a few strands had gotten free and were curling in the salt air, making him look charmingly disheveled.
He was doing them a disservice, he knew. Perry wasn’t sharp around the edges, and he might veer a bit more toward a match than a balance, but he was definitely caring and funny and easy to be around. There hadn’t been much in the way of physical affection yet with Sadiyah or Leela, but that was perfectly normal at this point; they were just testing the waters. He still hadn’t had his one on one date with Sullivan, but from what he could tell, although he appeared to be more genial than snarky, he checked the rest of Harry’s boxes. On paper, only Hilde truly seemed like a mismatch at this point.
And then he thought of himself, waking up in New York two days from now in his perfectly nice apartment, in his perfectly nice neighborhood, alone. No Harry in his bed. No Teddy to jump on his chest and demand he play dragons and dinosaurs. No mother and aunt downstairs to tease him and talk to him and include him in their lives like he belonged there.
“Ugh, sorry. God, I’m having fifth year flashbacks again.” Draco must have looked confused, because he waved a hand up above them. “Mistletoe, kissing, lots of tears. Hers, not mine. Long story.”
Draco groaned and flopped onto his back, flinging an arm over his face dramatically. “Oh my god, must you?”
“Right.” Harry cleared his throat, trying to think. “Um. So what are you… looking for, in a serious partner? I mean. Like, how do you see them, or, me, I guess, fitting into your life?” He cringed inwardly. He sounded like he was conducting a job interview. Poorly.
Shortly thereafter, Blaise began to wrap up the group interview. “And now, before we move on to our main event, I have one last question for the group. Were you surprised by the turn the show took after your departure?”
, she was smart, witty, and—quite thankfully—no longer a raging bigot. She was also, most importantly, completely besotted with Ginny. Unfortunately for Harry, however, she had several other traits that, when combined, did not work in his favor. Firstly, she worked for
While they worked, they talked a bit about their lives. Harry knew a bit more about Perry than he did about some of the other contestants, he realized; they’d already discussed his wanting kids, and his career and how busy it kept him, and they’d even briefly touched on the war. Now, they covered family (Perry was close with his and seemed pleased with how Harry had been unofficially adopted by the Weasleys), what they liked to do in their down time (mostly sleep, Perry admitted, given his intense work schedule), and what they envisioned their lives looking like as they got older (he hoped to eventually start a private practice and work more reasonable hours, maybe in the country somewhere so that when he started a family, he could actually spend time with them).
And there wasn’t, Harry realized. He really liked her, too, but not in the way that he was supposed to. Or, supposed to for the purposes of this production, anyway. He shook his head, sitting down next to her. “No, there’s not.”
“And now,” Blaise called, shutting them up, “please welcome our Bachelor himself, Harry Potter, and his partner and plot twist, Draco Malfoy!”
“Hello, everyone!” Luna greeted them brightly. “Today, we’re going to be practicing figure drawing. Have any of you done a figure drawing class before?”
Narcissa took her time, carefully evaluating her options in each store, asking for Draco’s opinions on things like whether he thought gold or silver embroidery on the napkins would go better with the rest of the decor and whether they should get ever-burning candles or something more traditional. His favorite stop was Twilfitt and Tattings, where she modeled an assortment of semi-formal robes for him, finally settling on a deep green velvet set that made her pale skin shine. They even made a stop in Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes, which took Draco by surprise, but apparently the store’s Christmas crackers were extremely sought after; Narcissa had evidently reserved a number of them months in advance.
Harry followed his lead without thought. It felt natural, in the moment, like the obvious progression of things. And it was nice, after the gross, unwelcome attempt by Cormac. Sullivan’s lips were surprisingly soft, and he kissed Harry like a question, not a statement. It was—
“God, I was so scared,” Harry told him, hand reaching out to stroke his cheek. Draco basked in the warmth of the caress as Harry went on. “Luna’s Patronus just said you were hurt; I had no idea whether…” He closed his eyes for a second before shaking his head to free it from whatever fears had taken up residence there.
“Nope, no more talking for you.” Draco stood, brushing invisible lint off his thighs. “I’ll be off. Enjoy your bath. And Potter?”
you told me and Ginny to remember our silencing charms since we’ve been here?” She looked to Ginny. “Love?”
“How did you do that?” Harry asked Sadiyah curiously as the rest of the group dispersed. “They all listened to you like you’d been in charge all along.”
As release overtook his body, leaving his chest slippery with come and his muscles shaking, he was peripherally aware of Harry’s last few desperate thrusts before he followed him over the edge, dropping Draco’s legs and slumping forward over him. The feeling of cashmere against his skin brought Draco back to himself, and he started giggling, the rush of endorphins heightening the hilarity of the moment.
Draco rolled his eyes as he walked back, heaving a put-upon sigh. “Honestly, Potter. You’re completely useless. Show me the box.”
“Harry’s right, Draco, darling,” Blaise said, sipping what appeared to be a mimosa. He was leaning against the counter, sporting a simple white sundress that might have been Hermione’s and looking beyond delighted. “It wouldn’t be fair to leave him on his own. You were, after all, the louder party.”
Draco felt a smug sense of satisfaction at Harry’s surprised gasp. They stood in front of a small podium manned by a wizard dressed in head-to-toe black, past which could be seen what was quite clearly a restaurant. Music filtered through the air, mixing with the sounds of silverware clinking and murmured conversation. The tables were scattered on what looked like small, private patios between the trees, connected by a series of cobbled paths. Fairies twinkled in the air above them, interspersed with floating paper lanterns.
Draco sat at a borrowed computer, scrolling through reams of market data and cursing the concept of year-end charitable giving. He was all for philanthropy—he gave to several causes himself—but the last-minute rush of the wealthy to shuffle their finances and make strategic donations to avoid paying taxes under the guise of good will made him want to strangle people.
Sure enough, as soon as Draco entered the office the next day, he could feel Potter’s eyes on him. He’d dressed just as carefully as the day before and continued his subtle efforts to display himself to his best advantage, biding his time. The ball was in Potter’s court, now; he just had to wait him out.
It was a motley assortment of people: old friends of his family, long-time friends of Andromeda (many of whom had been members of the Order of the Phoenix once upon a time), and rather a few familiar faces from his school days. They were dressed in a wide range of styles, from formal dress robes and Muggle cocktail attire through jeans and truly horrendous Christmas jumpers. George Weasley’s, in particular, was impressively garish, with blinking lights and moving reindeer prancing across a headache-inducing red and green checkerboard print. Draco himself had foregone that particular route, settling on a dark green cashmere jumper and black slacks. When George had teased him about the simplicity of the outfit, he’d told him faux-regretfully that technicolor monstrosities just didn’t suit his complexion.
“Definitely. It will be great to see how everyone acts when they’re in a bit more natural of a setting. I’m hoping that once we get going, they’ll forget about the cameras a bit and relax.”
“So I’ve been thinking about our date to the party—” he started, twirling his quill casually as Potter turned to look at him.
Sullivan’s hands slid down Harry’s back, toyed with the hem of his shirt and teased his waistband, broad fingers skimming over sweaty skin and making Harry shiver. “Is this okay?” he asked, and Harry looked up at him.
The salt/sugar incident is pulled directly from my 7th grade home ec class. I was not the culprit, but I was forced to suffer the consequences. 0/10, would not repeat.
“It’s just… Hilde. She’s sweet when we’re all out together, but she can turn a bit nasty in the house sometimes, and it came out toward Gabrielle more than the rest of us. I think it’s just jealousy, maybe?”
“Dear, really,” Narcissa chided gently from his father’s side. “You must have known that the contract was in discussion; what else would the courting arrangements have been for?”
Sadiyah was first, pulling him confidently along with her as she swayed, her movements as natural as breathing. “I feel like you have an unfair advantage here!” he yelled over the music, making her laugh. She was wearing heels that left her an inch or two taller than him, and her height and grace were drawing every eye in the room.
Malfoy raised an amused-looking eyebrow at Harry’s unsubtle once-over, but didn’t comment. “I could say the same. Visiting, or staying?”
“You’re a cow and I hate you,” Draco told Pansy as he kissed her cheek and nodded at Blaise in greeting.
“After Hogwarts,” she clarified, and Harry cursed internally, suddenly feeling very, very sober. He thought back to the drinks he’d consumed and tried to remember if he’d left any of them unattended at any point.
“Honestly, though, Edward, that doesn’t sound like much of a fight. Dragons can fly and breathe fire; what can dinosaurs do against that?” Draco asked as they left the warm kitchen to head toward wherever Teddy had decided to stage his battlefield.
He’d gotten a taste of it on their London excursion, of course, but it was different without Harry there to help wrangle him. Teddy was in a particularly energetic mood, and Draco thought that he might actually collapse at some point while Teddy ran on happily ahead of him. He made a mental note to start exercising again.
The vast majority of the packages were, of course, for Teddy, and so the adults sat back and watched in fond amusement as he tore through them, delighting at the growing pile of books and toys and art supplies he unwrapped. Draco, having been informed ahead of time of Teddy’s current dinosaur fixation, had brought him several Muggle books on the subject. Harry had, in addition to several other things, zeroed in on his new interest in outer space and crafted a moving model of the solar system.
He had just claimed a lounge chair next to Gabrielle, who looked delighted to see him, when there came sounds of scuffling and several voices shouting behind them. “What the…” He stood, turning, as did Gabrielle. Sullivan, Rose, and Owen, who had all been lounging nearby, joined them in observing the small tangle of people a few yards away. “What’s going on?”
The third that remained was, unfortunately, mostly sky, which was part of why Harry hadn’t finished it already. Sifting through piles of identical-looking pieces, he thought dolefully that he wished Draco was here. He was much better than Harry at picking out the distinctions between the myriad subtle shades of blue. “Cobalt,” he grumbled to himself.
“Shut up, Malfoy.” Harry bumped his shoulder against Dracos, and against his will, Draco found himself grinning.
“She’s like Hagrid with a Hippogriff,” Draco whispered from where he’d managed to make his way to Harry’s side.
“Come back to mine?” Draco asked, already envisioning the tantalizing planes of Harry’s body spread out across his bed without the inconvenience of cashmere and denim getting in the way. But although Harry’s pupils were blown wide with desire, there was a mischievous glint there that Draco did not like. Sure enough, Harry shook his head.
Her statement was apparently enough to loosen everyone else’s tongues, because suddenly Draco could barely differentiate one yelling voice from another.
He stretched his arm forward, closing in on the darting golden ball. Then, several things happened at once. The Snitch jerked suddenly upward. Draco snapped around dizzyingly quickly, shooting up after it. A voice nearby yelled “Look out!” And, as his fingers closed around their prize, he felt two heavy objects smash into his body—one to his left shin, and the other to the exposed right side of his torso, directly against his ribs—the dual forces spinning him around violently even as he felt several things crack horribly where the Bludgers had hit him.
Sighing internally, Harry went on. “Ground Quidditch is basically the same as normal Quidditch, except, you know, no flying, and the Snitch doesn’t fly any more than seven feet above the ground. The team who wins will get a prize, but I’m apparently not supposed to tell you what it is until after the game. You’ve been pre-divided into teams, so go ahead and choose your roles and we’ll get started!”
Once Hermione and Ron had turned in for the night, Harry had snuck out to the back garden with his broom and set course for Wiltshire. He wasn’t entirely sure what he was doing, he just knew that he wanted to talk to Malfoy as soon as possible. The flight took over an hour, which gave him plenty of time to ask himself what the fuck he was thinking. What was he going to do, walk up to the front door? Fly around peeking in windows until he caught sight of Malfoy?
Perry, thankfully, actually showed up for their date, which Harry thought was a good sign. Draco had arranged for them to take a baking class together, and Harry was quite excited. He’d known how to cook since he was a child, but baking was something that he’d never been able to master; it was too much like potions, in that if he didn’t pay close enough attention to the details, it tended to end in disaster.
Draco waved a dismissive hand. “If you had any humiliating nudity-related incidents in your past, I’m sure I would have heard about them.”
It could simmer low or flare bright and hot; comfort like a hearth in the winter or consume like an inferno.
Suddenly overwhelmed by guilt, Harry felt his own eyes begin to well and quickly yanked himself out of Draco’s grasp, turning away to escape that penetrating gaze before he gave too much away.
“We’ll take five minutes,” Luna announced. “Feel free to wander and look at everyone else’s pieces.”
“He’s in his workshop,” Andromeda told him, but the look in her eyes said that she was well aware that he already knew that.
They’d been out at a pub with a small group of friends at the time, and the announcement of his victory (or failure, depending on how one viewed it) was still fresh enough that he was very much not in the mood. Pansy had spent a few more minutes trying to convince him before sighing and wandering off to find someone else to talk to, and Harry had, naively, considered it a bullet dodged.
“Fuck,” Draco muttered to himself. He closed his eyes for a moment, trying to regain his composure. This was going to complicate things.
Draco continued to stare at him for a moment before shaking his head incredulously. His tone, when he spoke, was somewhere between baffled and amused. “Right. Of course.” He went back to shuffling through pieces, seeming a bit livelier than he had a minute ago. He placed a few, and then said, apropos of nothing, “You know, it makes you sound rather big-headed when you use that as a swear.”
“—might as well disqualify the whole team!” Graham was screaming. He turned and stormed off, his shoulder slamming against Harry’s as he went. Ron’s eyes met Harry’s, and he gave a sympathetic sort of grimace.
Harry managed another breath in, his mind clearing somewhat. When he tried to exhale, what came out was something like a sob. After a slight hesitation, Draco’s arms wrapped around him, and Harry couldn’t hold back the tears. He clung to Draco like a lifeline, shivering as he tried to push horrifying memory after horrifying memory back into the mental boxes where they belonged. Draco was rocking him slightly, rubbing his back again, and part of Harry knew he was going to be mortified later but for now he was just grateful that there was someone there to hold all the pieces together.
Draco stood still, allowing Harry’s exploration for a moment, but soon he was shifting away so that he could remove Harry’s shirt as well. Once skin hit skin, everything went a bit fuzzy. Harry vaguely remembered tripping as he tried to get out of his jeans without remembering to take his shoes off first, and the sound of Draco laughing helplessly at him, only to end up swearing as his own shoes refused to come untied.
The rest of the wooing process he’d planned for the night wasn’t particularly grand, in truth, but he thought that Harry would enjoy it. There were a series of disillusioned paths through the Gardens that magical guests could wander without being noticed, even after the grounds closed to the public. Draco led Harry on a meandering route, pointing out where magical plants hid amongst the more common varieties and telling stories of the witches and wizards who had integrated themselves into various royal households over the years.
“As long as you want me to,” Draco murmured, and Harry shivered at the caress of Draco’s breath against his ear. He turned, looping his arms around Draco’s shoulders.
“Hey! Potter!” came Draco’s teasing voice, snapping Harry out of his reverie. “No zoning out on me while I’m winning. Unless you’d like to forfeit?”
Inadvertently, his gaze flitted down to Harry’s lips, pink and chapped from the wind. He snapped his eyes back up, horrified at himself. “Fine,” he choked, before clearing his throat. “Fine,” he tried again.
By the time the Healers brought Draco back to consciousness, his leg and torso were dressed in some sort of lightweight material and the pain had receded substantially. “Still alive, then?” he asked groggily, directing the question at no one in particular.
Ron joined Harry on his drive to pick up their food and was delighted to find that the pizza place also sold six-packs of beer. He’d insisted on picking out several, mostly based on how much he liked the designs of the labels, before finally allowing Harry to pull him away. By the time they got back, everyone had congregated in the main room and Hermione had found a stack of plates in one of the cupboards. Dinner was a haphazard affair, with people sitting wherever they chose—at the table, on the squashy chairs of the living room, on the tall stools of the peninsula that loosely demarcated the line between the kitchen and main room.
Harry moved beside him, sliding an arm around his waist. “Hermione once told me that history is just agreed-upon fiction,” he said musingly. “I think it was a quote from something. But it’s true enough, isn’t it? We’re taught the parts that it’s convenient for us to know, and the rest is tucked away where it can’t disturb the status quo.”
He spent a few hours in the K&C office again in the morning but found his concentration suffering and gave up by lunchtime. Rather than heading back to Hogsmeade, he decided, on a whim, to take the bus to Charing Cross Road and make a final visit to Diagon Alley in hopes of finding a gift for Harry.
He must have drifted off for a moment, because he shortly found himself jolted awake by a put upon “oh for fuck’s sake!” from his left. His eyes shot open only to see that the tub had shrunk significantly, and he was now sitting only feet from a messily snogging Ginny and Pansy. Luna, who was still sitting next to them, seemed unbothered, but Draco—who had been the source of the complaint and was the only other person left—was looking at them in disgust. The full length of his thigh was now, Harry noticed, pressed firmly against his own. “Can you two not
The bar Harry had selected was unremarkable but pleasant. Dark-stained wooden booths with ceiling-high backs separating them lined one wall, and a row of high-top tables took up the space between them and the bar. Candles flickered on each table, giving the space a warm glow, and the spicy smell of pine emanated from garlands draped along the room’s edges.
I’m afraid some of these shorter chapters might feel a bit like filler, but I think having Draco interact with other people and showing that there is more going on here than just his feelings for Harry is important for his arc, so hopefully it’s not too boring?
“Oh please.” Narcissa gave a dismissive wave of her hand as Andromeda laughed. “I won’t ask much of you, but I’ll certainly need your help with some aspects.”
“Oh fuck off,” Harry said with a surprised little laugh. Then his tone went serious once more. “Do you really want to know?”
about, sure, but I’m not about to just so that you don’t have to show up for an event solo.” He turned pointedly back toward his desk, clearly done with the conversation. Draco sighed, but turned his attention back to the badly-dressed witch, who was now leaning against the edge of the photo, apparently napping. Ah, well. It had been worth a shot.
Stepping up onto the small, short rectangular stage at the center of the semicircle of easels, Harry was once more grateful that his complexion hid his blush relatively well. He stared up at the ceiling, unable to bear looking into anyone’s faces.
“So, I have to ask—what made you agree to go out with me?” he asked. He knew his own carefully calculated behavior had set the ball rolling, but after their last date, he’d come to the conclusion that Harry wasn’t one to be that easily manipulated. And sure enough—
Sullivan threw a tan, muscular arm around Harry’s ski vest-clad shoulders and gave him a squeeze. “Should we go out one more time, or are you ready to call it? Or they said they had those tubes we could ride instead. I know they’re kind of a kids’ thing, but at least there’s a little less room to tip over with those.”
“Okay. Great. I’ll see you then.” He held Draco’s gaze for a few moments longer, and Draco felt everything in his chest clenching as his smile faltered slightly. Harry blinked and looked away. “Right. Happy Christmas, all of you. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
Narcissa had, indeed, created a timetable for their canape and hors d’oeuvre preparation as she’d threatened to the night before. Once Draco had showered and changed, therefore, he joined her in the kitchen. Andromeda had taken Teddy out to burn off some energy, as he’d apparently been bouncing off the walls all morning, so it was just the pair of them.
It was unfortunate, he now mused, that their conversation had been cut short—but he felt confident that he’d be hearing from Potter soon. He finished the last of his scotch and was just approaching the bar for another when his new team captain, Hugh Capulet, intercepted his path. He pulled Draco to the side before he could blink, startling him into a confused “What the fuck?”
After a handful of precautionary drying charms, the rest of them began to settle onto the benches surrounding the fire pit, Draco once again claiming the seat beside Harry. The smell of crackling woodfire mixed with the intoxicating scents of damp earth and balsam, and Harry wished that he could bottle it and take it with him when they returned to England. Maybe he could, he pondered; he’d have to ask Hermione if she knew of a way.
She gave him a disapproving look. “They’re Harry’s family, and Harry is our family. Of course they’re invited.”
Luna was the first of them to actually put together one of the little sandwiches. “Oh, that’s lovely,” she said on a sigh after her first bite.
“No, I’m interested,” Draco objected, sitting up and stretching. Harry smiled to himself as Draco turned on his lounger and Hermione began a lecture, catching the terms ‘free-floating plants’ and ‘macro-algae’ before he tuned them out.
“Oh come on, Harry,” Cormac persisted, stepping forward again and giving Harry a patronizing look. “Why try to resist it?” He moved closer, and Harry hurriedly crossed his fingers behind his back.
Draco’s eyebrows went up. He looked almost impressed. “That’s evil, even for her. So you did it to appease them?”
“I’m reasonably sure that’s not how that works,” Hermione told him, trying to sound stern but biting back a laugh.
Draco hissed as his eyes met Potter’s. Of course he was here. All of his friends were, after all. And now Draco looked like a stalker, first running into Harry on the street and then showing up at his pub night. Harry seemed unbothered, however; he  smiled and clapped George on the shoulder, grabbing a tumbler of something golden off the bar and heading their way.
Once they were clean and dried off, Harry offered to lend Draco some pajamas. It wasn’t terribly late yet, so rather than going straight to bed, they opened a bottle of wine and curled up on the sofa, putting on another Christmas movie—this time, a rendition of
“Thank you all so much for joining us tonight,” Blaise said to them. He was standing in front of three low-backed, leather chairs arranged very similarly to the ones he had interviewed Harry in so many times over the course of filming. His sharp charcoal suit was pristine, and his smile was just as wide and bright as always. Addressing the crowd, he went on. “You’ll notice that there are three empty chairs among our friends. Unfortunately, two of our number are unable to join us tonight—one for an unavoidable conflict, and the other because we honestly have no idea how to contact them.”
“Yes please!” Ginny shoved a last chunk of cheese into her mouth and pulled her t-shirt over her head, stripping down to her bathing suit.
“You’re not nearly as subtle as you think you are, Harry,” Sadiyah told him, sounding unnervingly like Hermione. “We
“See anything good?” Draco asked him, smiling at his serious expression as he considered the various items under the glass.
“Shit!” He could barely hear Harry’s panicked exclamation over the rush of wind in his ears. He couldn’t see, but he could feel them veering to the side. Freeing one hand, he tried to push the hair from his eyes while simultaneously trying to correct their course, but he miscalculated. There was nothing for it; they were going to crash. “Teddy! Roll!” he heard Harry call, and then the sled—now traveling sideways down the steep hill—flipped, and they were airborne.
“Most likely not,” Draco said breezily. “Anyway, he told me that it didn’t work out because you had, and I quote, ‘too little in common in some areas and too much in others.’ And the ‘too little’ included his love of fashion and your love of Quidditch.”
An unexpected thrill had run up Draco’s spine. He hadn’t realized that Potter was back from Australia. He’d followed his career—and maybe his personal life, just a bit—in the media over the years, watching the sullen, angry teen hero being stalked by the press for things he’d obviously rather forget grow into a handsome, self-assured man who seemed utterly unbothered by his fame, so long as it was focused on his career.
In the end, Draco decided that his best option was to just tell Harry exactly what he had told Andromeda. He’d contemplated outright lying about his attraction, but if their situations were reversed, he knew that he would be much more hurt by a flat rejection than a logical explanation. And as much as he was tempted to take the self-preserving route, he was trying not to be that person anymore, so he’d just have to suck it up—as much as it went against his nature to do so.
“Absolutely.” Dermot smiled again before following the crew’s subtle direction to head into the mansion.
Asking Potter out had only been a whim. The rejection should not be plaguing him like this. It was ridiculous. Why should he care if a stupid, overrated pseudo-celebrity didn’t want to go out with him? It wasn’t as though he was short on options.
Draco barked out a laugh. “How very Slytherin of her.” He squeezed Harry’s hand one more time before letting go and sitting back. “So, do you mind giving me the abridged version of ‘the Harry Potter Story According to the Press’”?
“Well, congratulations! William, while we’re talking, I have a question for you: many fans of the show expressed confusion as to why you chose to participate in the first place, as you didn’t seem particularly invested. What made you decide to put your name forward?”
“Well, he kept me company after Jack left so that I didn’t have to spend a whole day wallowing in self pity, but it’s not like they were filming that or anything. I guess they just needed to pad the episode a bit or something? I dunno.”
Hilde cheered up a bit over dinner, which was a rather nice picnic spread, but Harry couldn’t bring himself to fully reengage with her after her behavior that afternoon. There was nothing wrong with not liking kids, he supposed, although he wished she would have said something before now. He thought he’d been pretty open about wanting some of his own, but it was possible he hadn’t been as explicit as he could have been. But the way she’d treated them had made him sincerely rethink his opinion of her. He could handle the fact that a day with a bunch of children wasn’t her cup of tea, but the fact that she hadn’t bothered to hide how much she didn’t want to be there, and that she didn’t seem to care that her attitude could make the kids feel bad, troubled him.
“She assures me that they deactivated when things started to get… hmm, less family-friendly, shall we say?” Draco told him, eyes sparkling wickedly.
“Pansy, what the fuck?!” he complained, trying to force his heart to slow. He hadn’t even realized that she wasn’t outside anymore.
“Don’t you usually have to wait a few minutes to do that to keep the pizza from tearing apart?” Harry asked, watching in interest as she began portioning the slices onto plates.
Draco tried to sort through memories of his correspondence with Andromeda and his mother but came up blank. He felt like one of them must have mentioned it, surely—but if they had, he apparently hadn’t registered the fact. “I must have at some point,” he finally said.
“Mother, Andromeda,” he greeted. “I want to talk to you about something.” When they’d both looked up at him and his mother had slid a bookmark into the volume settled on her lap, closing it, he went on. “Last week, when I went into the K&C offices, I ran into Chris Costleigh, my old boss, and she made me an offer.” He paused. “A job offer.”
“Normally.” It wasn’t a question. Draco’s voice had gone flat, and Harry almost missed the icy anger, because at least that hadn’t been directed at him. “Explain.”
As the crew began to disassemble their equipment, Perry, Sadiyah, and Leela all came up to Harry. Normally, at this point, they would be ushered back to their own part of the mansion, but for whatever reason, no one stopped them now.
“It’s lovely, Mother,” Draco said, looking around curiously, “but I must admit it’s not at all what I expected.”
“You just did. Although I wouldn’t blame you if you’d forgotten already. I have.” He rubbed a hand over his eyes, his mask of indifference slipping just a bit, revealing his frustration. “Besides, I don’t just mean the sex. And the fact that you think I do is honestly the bigger problem. We don’t
“What?” Harry asked blearily as he propped himself up on his elbows before glancing down at himself and letting out a huff of laughter himself. “Whoops.”
He can feel Draco smile into his hair. “And me.” He pulls back again. “I’m still sorry. Even if you didn’t really want the house, this still wasn’t…” he cringes, “...ideal.”
They started the Christmas movie that Harry had chosen and curled up on the sofa with their food while an opening monologue played over a montage of happy people at airports. “You’re not allowed to judge me for liking this,” Harry told him as he popped a chip into his mouth. “I am aware of its flaws and I don’t care.” Draco just laughed.
“Good. That’s… good.” Harry gave a sideways little smile. “I’d hate to have to avoid Teddy for several weeks because I couldn’t look you in the face.”
“Alright, let’s do this.” Harry’s voice was playfully determined, and Draco took a deep, calming  breath. He was not affected by any of this, he told himself. He was
As he walked away, he could hear his father’s voice rising in indignation, followed by his mother’s soothing placation. He didn’t bother to focus on what they were saying. He’d hoped that, after the war, his parents might have reevaluated their priorities, at least somewhat. He sighed—he supposed that had been a bit naive of him. Oh well. If this season went well, and he decided to stay, he would find a place of his own and move out. They could scheme all they liked, he thought wryly, as long as he didn’t have to listen.
Harry shrugged. “I don’t know. I just sort of fell into it, I guess? I tried a lot of things after the war. Studied wandmaking for a bit, and it didn’t really click, but I really liked the woodworking part of it, so I took some Muggle classes. I was carving things just, you know, for myself or whatever. Just small stuff—animals, that kind of thing—but then I was working at George’s shop for a bit. He does a lot of experimental charmswork, you know? And I got to thinking about how charms could be integrated into my carving, and we kind of brainstormed, and then the next thing you know, I was making these moving wooden dragons and hippogriffs and things and I just… never stopped.”
Leela looked like she was trying desperately to keep a straight face. “Um, yes, that was absolutely what I was going for.”
“Not at all! Like I said, you’ve always been connected. I think it’s more than time for you to explore that connection together, and I’d be honored to help.”
Draco tamped down his not-so-latent jealousy at the idea of Blaise propositioning Harry and went for the kill. “A shared preference for, shall we say, giving rather than receiving.” Harry looked confused for a split second before his eyes went wide, and Draco went on, trying to sound as casual as possible. “I remember thinking how completely wasted on him you were.” He took a sip of his wine, blinking innocently.
“If you mean that I will bite if you piss me off, then yes, you are correct,” Draco answered, opening one eye and giving him an amused look.
It was nice, Harry thought as he looked around the circle, to have had this time with everyone. Hermione was curled into Ron’s side across the way, looking sleepy. Ron chatted with Greg while keeping a protective arm around her, and Harry smiled. He was so happy for them sometimes that it made his heart ache.
Sullivan, meanwhile, had donned a sheer, skin-tight tee shirt with a pair of jeans so skinny that Harry was shocked that he could move in them. Perry’s ensemble was similar, although his shirt wasn’t see through and his jeans were a bit less constraining-looking. Dermot looked especially eye-catching in a thin, low cut top, leather pants, dark eyeliner, and a fedora that should have been off putting but which looked unfairly cool atop his riotous curls. He seemed to have banished all traces of paint and glitter from himself, and he looked stupidly hot. It was too bad that he was apparently a gigantic wanker, Harry thought.
Right, Harry remembered. Perry had been part of those conversations, too. He sighed. “Yeah. The Draco thing.”
Luna returned the hug, pulling back with a bright smile. Her wind chime earrings tinkled merrily as she moved. “I think they wanted someone that they knew you would feel safe around. They seemed to think you might object to public nudity for some reason.”
Pansy gave a loud sigh, pointedly studying her nails with a bored expression. “Are you reassured, now, darling? Because if I’m not needed to help cobble together an alternative, I have things to do.”
“Any time,” came Malfoy’s quiet, amused voice from behind his right shoulder. Harry laughed, shaking his head and moving back toward the deck where the sunbathers were, thinking that maybe he was done with solo time for the day. Safety in numbers, and all that.
Harry stifled his laugh, trying desperately not to interrupt the show. “Shush,” he admonished, secretly glad for Draco’s ongoing color commentary. Draco had known that Harry was nervous about seeing many of these people again, and Harry knew that this was his uniquely Draco way of calming his nerves.
Draco didn’t wake up disoriented this time. Harry’s body was warm and soft in sleep, and he smelled like his soap and his new shampoo and himself, anchoring Draco very much in the here and now.  It was chilly in the room, which was likely why he’d woken up curled against Harry’s chest, legs intertwined with his, blankets pulled up tight around them. He let himself savor the closeness for a few minutes, breathing him in, before beginning to disentangle himself, no longer able to ignore his pressing need to use the toilet. As he tried to roll away, however, Harry’s arms tightened around him and he made a discontented noise.
Harry looked pointedly at the drawing’s rippling abdominals before raising an eyebrow at her, and Hilde giggled. “Okay, so I may have taken a
It was awkward at first, but bit by bit, it had all begun to come together. Greg Goyle and Ron had found a mutual love of sport, joining up to learn Muggle football from Dean Thomas and playing with an ever-changing roster on the weekends. Blaise Zabini and Luna Lovegood had formed an odd sort of mutual fondness, their polar-opposite dispositions—Luna’s dreaminess and Blaise’s suave persona, Luna’s disinterest in sex or romance and Blaise’s ability to charm and seduce a new witch or wizard every week—balancing each other somehow. And Harry and Draco… well.
Harry leant against the door and closed his eyes for a few moments, trying to sort out what the hell to do now, before he gave it up for a lost cause and went to pee. By the time he’d brushed his teeth and showered, he’d come to the conclusion that the best thing to do would be to pretend it had never happened.
“I think we must have used salt instead of sugar,” Harry said dejectedly. There was no other possible reason that their lovely looking muffins could come out tasting like Play-Doh. Perry groaned next to him, looking at the assembled ingredients on the counter top.
“It’s breakfast,” Teddy announced, “and Gran made pancakes, and if you don’t come downstairs they’ll all be gone.”
Saying his goodbyes, Harry made his way out to an incensed Hilde, who had slipped her heels back on and had her arms crossed over her chest. “Can we please leave?”
“Sun charm, Potter. I’m not an idiot.” Harry rested a hand on the back of Draco’s chair, and Draco looked up.  “You’d better have brought me something sweet. I was promised cocktails.”
“Well, I didn’t know Harry would be a part of our Christmas until I got here,” he explained, shaking off his dismay and vowing to give some real thought to the matter later.
Ron’s eyes narrowed, and he clambered to his feet before jumping back into the water, taking Harry down with a flying tackle. As Harry resurfaced, laughing, he saw Ron’s eyes go wide as he was yanked back under, apparently by the ankle, by a submerged Ginny.
regularly checking in with each other “—but have you actually not realized you’re in love with him?”
“I don’t exactly have room to judge,” Harry whispered back, sniffling and then grimacing at himself.
Several hours and rather-more-than-several drinks later, Draco stumbled back to his mother and Andromeda’s house, feeling untethered but also distinctly unburdened. As the night had worn on and the alcohol had flowed, he’d ended up in an odd series of conversations with a variety of people whom he would never have expected to speak civilly with.
date rather than a friendly round of drinks. “So, how did you find this place?” he settled on, not wanting to start out on an awkward note.
“I assume this is about where you disappeared to last night?” Hermione asked, sounding as though she didn’t actually need an answer because she already knew that she was correct. Which, of course, she was. Per usual.
“That’s—” He couldn’t even think of a way to finish the sentence. He shook his head and gripped her fingers back, hard. “Thank you,” he settled for, hoping that she would understand the intensity of the gratitude behind the statement.
Harry huffed out a laugh and did as he was told, sliding off the bed briefly to pull their shoes and socks off before slipping Draco’s trousers and pants down and off, leaving him completely naked. Climbing back onto the mattress, he knelt for a moment, running his hands up and down Draco’s thighs, making him shiver. His gaze was hungry as he took in Draco’s prone form. “God,” he breathed, before unceremoniously moving to lie on his stomach and taking Draco into his mouth.
“What, consulted my therapist first?” Harry gave Malfoy a half smile, but he doubted it was particularly convincing. He was already starting to feel embarrassed about his little meltdown, and he winced internally at the thought of how everyone else would react. “Merlin, this is humiliating.”
“I haven’t, exactly,” she told him, “but I’ve taken a couple of anatomy classes, mostly to understand how all the parts of our bodies work together. And I like drawing, so…” She gave a graceful shrug. She was wearing a long sundress with thin straps, and the movement emphasized her narrow but muscular shoulders and prominent clavicle.
“Somewhat, but not entirely. You’d still have some clients, but fewer and with more substantial investments. We’d also have you mentoring new recruits and potentially liaising with Gringotts. The goblins did not take kindly to our arrival, and I thought your... background... might help smooth the way a bit.”
Draco watched as Harry engaged with enthusiasm, asking questions and giving space for Teddy to share as much as he’d like, obviously enjoying the conversation just as much as Teddy was. Draco was consistently amazed by Harry and Teddy’s relationship. Harry treated Teddy very much like a
“Perfectly alright! I thought that while all of your own muffins were cooking, you might like to try these ones.”
Lucius opened his mouth, most likely to yell right back, but Narcissa held up a delicate hand to silence him. “Is such language really necessary?” Draco opened his own mouth to tell her that
“I—” Harry’s eyes were wide, and he was completely unsure what to do. They were out in the middle of nowhere, and he was beginning to suspect that his delusional companion might actually be a bit dangerous.
“I was trying to help.” Draco’s voice is small, now, and maybe a little tearful, and Harry has to force himself to breathe again, to calm down.
Draco responded by wrapping his legs around Harry’s waist and leaning up to kiss him. Harry pushed back inside of him, and Draco hummed his appreciation into Harry’s mouth. This felt— he didn’t know. This
Someone gasped. The light of the firework began to dissipate, but was soon followed by two more. After their initial explosion, these fizzled down into the shapes of two hippogryphs cavorting around one another. Harry laughed. What followed was an impressive display of what Harry now recognized as WWW fireworks. Fred and George had perfected the spellwork over time, and the formerly chaotic production had more order to it now, painting an array of ever-changing scenes above them in bright, sparkling lights.
Each time they met, the answer became clearer. Each time they parted, it was harder to let go. With every brush of hands, every unexpected laugh, every apology and revelation and kiss and touch, they built the tentative foundations of something
Margarita in hand, he joined a shivering Ron in sitting at the edge of the pier and dipped one foot in the water. “Merlin
They walked on stage, making their public debut to a veritable chorus of applause, whistles, and cheering. Harry grinned and ducked his head while Draco smirked beside him, looking extremely pleased with himself. After exchanging handshakes with Blaise—which felt fairly silly to Harry, given how long they’d all known each other—they settled into the leather chairs opposite him.
It went along like that, with various contestants talking about what they’d been up to since the end of the show. Owen and Rose, who were still together, gave an update on their own relationship. Sullivan talked about his recent travels. Cormac spent rather longer than necessary expounding on all of the people reaching out to him to promote their products (“I’m being very picky, of course, so you won’t be seeing anything too soon”), and Gabrielle told them about a line of perfumes she was developing under her mentor’s brand. Nathalie, Harry was pleased to hear, had given up her dreams of becoming an investigative journalist.
December in the United Kingdom was not actually an ideal time to go sledding for the majority of people. This was mostly due to the fact that there was, unfortunately, rarely much in the way of snow. Harry, however, had promised that he had a plan. Once they were properly bundled up, he had taken Teddy and Draco to an area he told them was near the Weasley family’s home, and where the always-enterprising George had instituted a weekend side-business: a course of increasingly steeply sloped hills covered in conjured snow. Use of the hills was free, but there was a small shed from which people could rent sleds in any number of shapes and sizes and with any number of different magical enhancements. The idea had apparently been inspired by Hermione, who had once mentioned the Muggle practice of creating artificial snow in ski resorts, and had turned out to be quite lucrative.
