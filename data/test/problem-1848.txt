"Bloody hell, Malfoy. You haven't come yet. You were going to wank and come… I want to watch you come… Fuck me?"
“D’you have patience to prepare me with your fingers?” he asked. “It’s been a long time, but if you can’t, spells are—”
“Fish can be very pretty,” Harry said, trying to encourage Draco to open up.
And thank Merlin for that, too, because with this being NEWT year, no one had time for all the detentions that would have arisen from them attempting to share the eighth year common room.
“No, ma’am,” Draco said, heart sinking deep into his belly. No advantageous lie came to mind. “Grandfather Abraxas,” he admitted.
"Kreacher, hold on. Slaves, kneel down and wait."
Harry, grateful not to be forced to answer for his earlier outburst -- which he now felt a bit stupid about -- tried to give the question his honest attention. "Well," he started slowly, looking out the front window, "last time I was down here I found grindylows and merpeople. The ring's been in the lake for almost twenty years, so if anyone has found it, I'd think it would be one of them?"
“You didn’t go,” Draco said stupidly. Harry looked up and smiled.

Draco felt his eyes nearly bug out. He’d been holding back words like that for weeks, terrified Harry would not be able to return them.
They eventually bought a huge patch of land positioned vaguely between Luna’s Dad and the Burrow, fighting constantly with the architect and arriving, finally, in a large house for the women, a two bedroom cottage next door for Harry.
He ignored the pain as he packed to leave Hogwarts.
"Holy shit fuck," Harry wailed. "Oh Jesus Merlin yessssss…."
Draco’s erect dick rubbed against the garish red and gold wallpaper, and Draco knew he was going to come all over it again. Harry was whispering in his ear, and Draco strove to hear him, to obey him; but the blood was rushing in his ears and the breath was rushing in his lungs and
“Yup, hidden in the Cheviot Hills.” Harry’s smile threatened to take over his face.
Kreacher appeared near the door, bowing slightly, and Harry told him to fetch Mouth and Hole.
Draco nodded.
“I’ll owl Aamin,” Hermione smiled.
Female:
"And Malfoy? I'll start with… 'Hole.' Because you're going to wish you'd been thrown in one, but instead you've become two. No man has ever pushed his cock into your tight little virgin arse. I can hardly wait to be the first. Your mouth looks to be a good fuck hole as well. And that about sums up your worth as something that takes up space on earth."
“This, by the way,” Draco said as he pulled Harry’s erection out, leaving Harry’s balls trapped under the elastic of his fashionable blue pants, “is why I didn’t have seconds of your delicious dinner.” Then he swallowed Harry’s cock to the root.

“You feel good,” he whispered. “Hot, hell. Hot and soft and tight and…”

not wanted to tell Mother about their dalliance, but once Harry had, Draco thought he’d described well to her the tightrope he’d intended to walk.
is entering a contest,” Harry interrupted Lavender and Parvati.
"I don't think Snape's wraith would have disappeared if I hadn't truly meant it," Harry said, feeling confident. "Yeah, I think it sounds brill, Draco." he paused, and then reached over to brush Draco's fringe out of his eyes. "Besides, think of the… fringe benefits." He grinned widely, and Draco looked at him for a short, stunned moment, before he laughed abruptly, once.
Neville turned bright red, then stood and walked to the window. “She has a girlfriend. I think.”
“Come be mine,” Harry murmured.
Draco cocked his head. “Yes,” he agreed. “I’ve imposed enough today.”
The Hat paused again, and the Headmistress turned to Harry and Malfoy. "The professor is correct. These are the things we have learned and inferred from the research I have been able to do. I have collected supplies for your quest, and will entertain any reasonable request for supplies not yet already gathered." She tapped the edge of her desk and gestured for them to stand, which they both did quickly, as though in competition. "Any questions?"
“But…” Draco sputtered. “But then… people would

Malfoy looked amused. "But you wank, don't you Potter?"
“I’m,” Harry swallowed and looked at his feet. “I fancy you
She looked at him sideways but chose not to engage any further. It was rare that Draco fell behind on schoolwork, but not unheard of. Draco was grateful for the reprieve from her probing, and even more grateful for the brill prevarication he’d thrown out on the fly. It gave him the perfect excuse to retire to his bed and seal himself inside his curtains, under cover of a good bit of spellwork. Once they got back to Slytherin he made quick work of getting his teeth brushed and his pyjamas on, then kissed Pansy goodnight on the top of her silky brown head, nodded to Theo and Blaise, and shut himself up inside his curtains with his Transfigurations books and a large blank roll of parchment.

"Normally I'd be uncomfortable with the headmistress' request," Robards admitted slowly. His chair was tipped back and his arms were behind his head. He was looking up at the ceiling.

“Riddle was here? How?” McGonagall demanded.
“Yes, but one should always observe proper etiquette. And that includes apologising when necessary.”
There was no movement in the dark room. Harry quietly crossed to the windows and yanked the curtains back, letting sunshine fill the room. There was a groan from the bed. Harry sniggered and ran over, throwing himself bodily onto the empty half of the bed. There was a louder groan as Draco attempted to roll away.
Harry groaned a little, as now he was awake he realised how cold it was, despite the fireplaces being lit. As he scrambled to get into his dressing gown and slippers, Draco went to wake up Vince and Greg. By the time Harry had warmed up a bit, Draco was sitting back on his own bed ripping open the first of a very large pile of presents.
“It's a diary,” he said.
Snape sighed. “Parseltongue is considered somewhat of a Dark talent for one to possess, Mr Potter.”
“True. But that wasn't a sundae. Come on.”
“It's been opened before?” Harry held his jug out of Dobby's reach. “Okay, so you can't say anything about that. Fine. Do you know who opened it?”
“Great, just a second.”
Pansy gasped and Daphne burst into tears. Blaise put an arm around her as Tracey grabbed Theo's arm.
A bored looking teenager put down her magazine and looked up at her. “Can I help you?”
Ernie looked at her pityingly. “Susan, think about it. How could a baby do that, if he didn't have some strong, Dark magic? You-Know-Who probably saw him as a threat, and went to snuff him out before he got too powerful. And even if Potter isn't a pure-blood, I've heard he hates the Muggles he lives with.”
Draco ran a hand through his hair. “Yes. I... I may have over-reacted earlier. I'm sorry.”
“Aren't you done yet?” he asked, peering into the trunk.
“Yes, Master Draco,” Dobby said, then paused. “Dobby is happy that Master Draco and Harry Potter are safe,” he said before Disapparating again. Draco frowned after him.
“Of course, sir!”
“He wondered who threw it at you,” Harry said hastily.
“Well, okay, one of you forget about me, how's that?” Harry asked impatiently.
“Feel like a picnic?” Harry asked a little breathlessly. They both looked out the doorway to the still slightly snowy grounds. “All right, an indoor picnic?”
“That!” Harry cocked his head to the side.
Draco frowned, then laughed. “Yes, Harry, I'm real. Or at least I think –”
“Yes, sir,” Draco replied. “When Harry was taken down into the Chamber, I sort of, well, I didn't handle it very well. Eventually I found a Prefect and had her Floo call Professor Snape, demanding he take me to visit Hermione in the infirmary. I wanted to see the best friend I still had left,” Draco paused and cleared his throat. “Anyway, I went to hold her hand, and noticed she had a scrap of paper in her hand. It was a page that had been torn out of a library book. It was about basilisks, and she'd written 'pipes' in the margin. That's how it's been getting around the school: in the plumbing.”
“A basilisk?” Dumbledore leaned forward.
Hogwarts looked no different from the last time he'd seen it, and Harry had a happy sense of homecoming as he took his place at the Slytherin table between Pansy and Draco. His mood soured slightly as he saw Lockhart smiling toothily from the staff table. His turquoise robes shimmered whenever he waved out at the students.

The elf popped into the room. “Yes, Master Draco?”
“My mother had it painted when I was a baby. It's a Welsh Green. I've been thinking of getting it painted over, but I think she's rather fond of it,” Draco said in embarrassment.
“Not really. He still wins most of the time.”
“Have
“Girls' dorm,” Harry said. He put the pins Daphne had given him into his biscuit tin, stashing the lot in his trunk.
“I'll swear it before the Ministry if yeh need me to! I'll –”
Snape raised an eyebrow. “You're volunteering for extra work?”
Mrs Malfoy ignored his hand and pulled him into a hug. “It was a pleasure, Harry. And what I said to Draco goes for you, too. Stay safe this year.”
“What are we going to do?” Millicent growled.
“Sorry,” Harry muttered.
,” Harry muttered quickly, and started stuffing his things back into his bag. Next thing he knew, the dwarf had pushed him over and was sitting on his legs.
This proved impossible to do during class, given that they were in the front row under Snape's sharp gaze and Hermione was ignoring them in any case. As soon as the bell rang, Draco leant over and grabbed Hermione's bag.
“Do I have to go ask Mrs Malfoy if my owl's okay?”
Blaise laughed. “Yeah. What's it to you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Who's Aragog?” Harry asked in trepidation.
Theo nudged Harry. “Don't worry, Snape'll eviscerate him!” They sniggered and ignored Daphne's glare.
Harry watched as Wood ran after McGonagall, clearly complaining about the cancelled match. Draco gave him a shove. “Come on, Harry.”
Dumbledore gazed at Harry and Draco before nodding. “Of course, Severus. Argus, come and have a drink in the staffroom...”
“That can have its uses, too. And I imagine Olamide would be eager to tell you all he knows, if you're the only Parselmouth he has contact with.”
“So? If we can't figure it out, we'll try again later,” Harry shrugged, then stopped. There was shouting coming from around the corner.
When they got back to the common room Harry found Flint sitting with some friends on the couches.
“Now, this is the standard position for combat. On the count of three we will begin, though of course, on this occasion, we shan't be fighting to kill,” Lockhart declared.
“You did too. You looked like you were being marched off to Azkaban as we left the Hogwarts Express. Of course, you did end up a prisoner...”
“Yes Master Draco,” it squeaked again, and disappeared with a small crack.
“Feel like a sundae?” Harry asked brightly.
Harry rolled his eyes. “What do you think I am, some kind of Hufflepuff?”
“No, I don't want to scare him off. It's going to be hard enough by myself, I think,” Harry said as he stood up.
“Right there with you,” Harry laughed and picked up a piece of toast.
“No! You're involved in this somehow, aren't you?” Draco demanded. “You – oh! You gave the diary to Weasley, didn't you? That day in Diagon Alley!”
“I don't see why not. Draco can show you where we have our bonfires.”
“On what grounds?” Fudge continued.
They found Mrs Malfoy waiting impatiently with Dobby standing beside her. “Draco! Oh, darling, I've been so worried about you,” Mrs Malfoy cried as she enveloped him in a tight hug.
They couldn't see its face because of the angle they were at, but the result was instantaneous. The basilisk jerked briefly as though having a seizure, before a ripple swept through it from head to tail, and it was still.
Draco jumped a bit when the music started playing in his ear, but was soon relaxing against the headboard on Harry's bed, watching him sort out his clothes. Harry noticed out of the corner of his eye that Draco was tapping a foot in time with the music. When he finished he flopped onto the bed and grinned.
Harry spun around to find Ron sneering at him. Next to him was a girl who must be his sister. She was standing next to a cauldron and staring wide eyed at Harry. Draco stopped laughing and stepped up beside Harry.
“What do you want?” Ernie had gone pale, but was frowning at Harry stubbornly.
Draco nodded as Hermione looked between them with a gasp. “Did you both just hear that voice?”
“I don't know, do I! I was sitting in the U-bend when a book landed in me. I didn't see who did it,” Myrtle sniffed. “It's over there now; the water washed it out.”
“Likewise, I'm sure,” Mr Malfoy drawled. “You're staying with us for the remainder of the summer, I understand.”
“Why not?” Harry frowned and absently gave Hedwig more meat.
“Now we just need

doesn't mention much, so earlier this week, I asked Professor Binns about it.”
“All because of you,” Tom hissed, and his eyes flashed red. “What did you do to me all those years ago?”
“Pearl Jam,” he muttered as he removed his headphones.
They stopped rough housing when Mrs Malfoy led them into the bakery. Five minutes later and Harry and Draco were happily trying each other's milkshakes as Mrs Malfoy sipped her coffee and they waited for their food.
“You'll need to follow me,” Harry said. Snape studied him before giving a short nod and standing up.
“You should have come straight to me!” she fumed.
“Right, thanks. Er...
Harry rushed forward and pulled the elf away from the wall. He looked into Dobby's slightly crossed eyes and frowned. “Alright, I won't ask that again. Just – just stay away from Hedwig, alright?”
“Uh huh,” Harry replied.
Harry stared blankly at Pomfrey as she fussed around him asking questions and checking him over. Finally she handed him a large glass of Pepperup potion. “You're just coming down with the flu, dear. Nothing to worry about.”
They crept forward and peered around it carefully. It was the corridor where Mrs Norris had been found, and Filch was stomping off the other way, swearing loudly. They waited until he'd gone and moved forward. There was a large puddle of water spreading across the corridor, seeping out from a closed door.
“You're not in trouble for once, Mr Potter,” Snape said drily.
“I was thinking of seeing Hagrid after breakfast, you want to come?” Harry asked.
Draco narrowed his eyes as he looked at it. “Who took that?”
“Brilliant. Now Draco's going to be mad at me, as well.”
“I'm going back to Hogwarts in September. You can't stop me. And I'd like my letters now, please!”
“Yes, dear. I've arranged it all with his aunt and uncle,” Mrs Malfoy said.
“Petrified?” Pomfrey asked.
They straightened their clothes and walked through the empty common room. The school was eerily quiet as they made their way to the Great Hall, when Harry stopped suddenly.
Ollie flopped back onto his rock. If he'd had lips, Harry would have sworn he was pouting. “
For the first time Harry had found it awkward sharing the Cloak with Draco. They'd shared it enough that they walked together effortlessly. But tonight Harry had been very aware of Draco behind him: the warmth of his body against his back; the gentle puff of breath in his ear whenever Draco whispered to him; the occasional brush of an arm or leg against his own. He didn't know about Draco, but Harry had been tingly and jittery by the time they got to the Defence office, and it had had nothing to do with what they were about to do.
Harry followed Snape, wondering what he wanted. He hadn't done anything since leaving the pixies in Lockhart's office. Well, not unless you counted exploring the castle after curfew under his Cloak with Draco. But it couldn't be that, as Snape had practically given him permission to do that, provided he didn't get caught.
photo of Harry and Lockhart was stuck to the wall next to every bed, with an enlarged version next to Harry's bed. As he watched, photo Harry elbowed Lockhart in the side and darted out of frame.
Harry couldn’t keep the grin off his face as he watched the little omega wiggle his arse at him as if trying to entice Harry to mount him already. “What? What do you want pretty boy? Do you want my cock?” he asked his hands groping the upturned cheeks his fingers digging into the reddened globes cruelly. “What was that? I can’t hear you; I guess you don’t really want me to split you open. Maybe I should find another omega, one who wants me to fuck them” he said teasing as he went to move away as the omega seemed to throw himself against his bindings thrashing, desperate to keep Harry’s attention as if the mere thought of Harry walking away was something he just wasn’t able to bear. Deciding to stop teasing the desperate omega, he spread the male's cheeks and spit on his entrance. “Calm yourself slut, hope you're ready for me,” he said as he roughly entered the omega. He roughly forced his cock past the tight sphincter his spit barely relieving the friction.
the best person with healing spells. So, you were the only other option” Harry said as he followed the Professor into his quarters.
It seemed that his cloth was getting some unconventional use recently he thought, as he knelt beside Malfoy and started to clean him off in a crude parody of the previous night, speaking softly so as not to startle the already frightened Omega. “Shh Malfoy, it’s ok. Come on let’s get you cleaned up and to Madam Pomphrey. How does that sound?” He asked, keeping his voice soft as he wiped the blood and semen away, fighting to keep the frown off his face.
Over time the wall became popular even amongst omega as it allowed for an Omega to experience the joys of sex without being forced to mate the first Alpha that comes along. It quickly became popular amongst the lower-ranked omega as a way to raise their selves and their family in society. Becoming pregnant with a strong Alpha’s child would allow them to advance in society. The wall was designed in such a way as to protect the identity of the Omega and prevent an overeager Alpha from claiming them but still providing their hands, and lower regions for the Alpha’s pleasure. Alpha’s would use it as a way to prove who was the strongest Alpha as Omega would only conceive from the strongest Alpha that bred them. With the fact that neither the alpha nor the omega completely knew who was on the other side, it created a bit of mystery until a pregnancy would occur. Harry had been fascinated by the idea wondering about the omega that would do such a thing, but he hadn’t had a reason to investigate the current omega who frequented the wall.
“He’s an omega; some would argue that he’s going to spread his legs anyway why should they wait?”
His knees seemed to give out, Harry having such a grip on his hips, kept himself from slipping out, but it was a near miss. After yanking the omega back onto his feet, he snarled as he harshly spanked the omegas cheeks. “Don’t you dare! I’m not done with you yet. Stand up” his voice harsh as he punctuated every statement with a harsh thrust hitting his prostate roughly every time. His imagination seemed to drift as if trying to supply his brain with the sounds he so desperately wanted to hear. Of course, his brain decided to pull up the image of the omega he really wanted under him. The babbling voice of Draco Malfoy begging so prettily. Begging him to slow down, give him a moment to breath. To please, please stop. Harry though had completely different plans. “Don’t you dare cum yet you slut, not until I do” he growled viciously as he picked up the pace brutally hammering the omega’s prostate. The begging, in his imagination, increased almost as if he could really hear Malfoy’s voice begging him to slow down, to let him cum, to stop, and by the end when Harry was approaching orgasm himself all he could make out was, please. Harry being repeated as if it was a mantra.
Harry was flushed with arousal when his fantasy was interrupted by four boys in Slytherin robes rushing past him almost knocking him over. He might have got some sort of pleasure from the way the boys paled at realizing who he had just run into if they hadn’t just interrupted one of his favourite fantasies. One of the boys, a newly matured Alpha if his scent was anything to go by tried to growl at Harry, causing all amusement to vanish at the challenge. A deep growl started in his chest and escaped past his lips, bouncing off the stone walls as he glared at the little upstart. Voldemort hadn’t scared him, and he thought he would be able to intimidate him?
Harry gave Severus a look to ask just how stupid he thought he was. “Oh, I don’t think they are going anywhere any time soon. At least not without either overpowering my sticking charm or leaving behind a few vital pieces of anatomy. I do hope they try” Harry smirked viciously as he was finally able to untangle himself from Malfoy’s grip. He was secretly impressed with the strength it took to remove the Omega from his person. It seems Malfoy was an unusual omega, with that kind of strength. Omega were supposed to be the weaker sex, incapable of resisting an Alpha but the way Malfoy had always fought against him and the blood under his claws told a different story.
Not wanting to cause the Omega any further stress, but not willing to not get him looked at Harry frowned trying to think of a compromise. “Alright, I won’t take you to Pomphrey. How about Snape? Would that be ok?” Harry would have chuckled at the irony of him willingly seeking out the Head of Slytherin if it wasn’t for the situation. Watching the wide silver eyes seem to calm minutely he decided to take that as permission as it was obvious that Malfoy was in no condition to have a coherent conversation as after Harry finished cleaning as much as he could without touching areas that could likely have Lucius Malfoy coming after him for “soiling” his property.
Severus just raised an eyebrow at his comment as if impressed by the anger he heard on the behalf of his Godson. As he set to work forcing a distraught Omega to down potions. He silently noted the fact that Draco seemed to calm down when Harry had reached out to gently stroke his hair. Looking at Harry, it was obvious the Alpha’s mind was elsewhere, and his hand was acting of its own accord.
“You were such a good boy for me; I’ll be back tomorrow night at this time. If you behave yourself until then and wait for me I might be tempted to reward you” he said his voice soft though the alpha tone still active from the way the omega was reacting.
Harry thought to himself. Harry took a few seconds to try to compose himself, leaning against the cold stone wall hoping that it would help him cool down.
A frown crossed his face as he looked down at Malfoy, had he always looked that small? Merlin, how had he fought against him all those years if he had always looked that fragile? A snarl slipped past his lips as he took in the shattered look Malfoy was sporting as he clutched desperately at the taters of his robes. Realizing that two of the Alpha’s had their pants down and the overwhelming scent of fresh spilt seed and blood almost had him dragging his own claws through the offenders. “Fucking disgusting” he spat aimed at the alphas, but then he heard Malfoy whimper and watched as he tried to scramble back desperate to put distance between himself and the angered Alpha. This caused him to realize things were worse than he thought. For Malfoy to not be spitting some sort of insult at him wasn’t normal.
Harry whacked him with a pillow before flopping down beside him. “You know I was right about Quirrell.”
“I see. Come along then, there's an Apparition point not too far from here.”
Theo nodded. “He's been packing ever since by the looks of things. Filch has been carrying his things down to the Entrance Hall all night.”
“Just go back to sleep during class,” said Draco dismissively. “Listen, we've got a double free this afternoon. Come help me practise for the Quidditch try outs.”
“Well, he's not a particularly good one, if that's the case,” she said. They stared at her. “Think about it. Both times you heard someone saying they were going to kill. So far, everyone's just been Petrified rather than killed, but not because you were able to change or prevent anything from your advanced warning. So I don't think that's it.”
Harry grinned back and closed his book. “Sounds good to me.”
Harry drained the glass and screwed his face up as steam billowed out of both ears. “How long will it last?”
They were silent for the rest of the walk to McGonagall's office. Draco wouldn't let go of Harry, and kept sneaking glances at him, as if afraid he'd suddenly die on his feet. Harry didn't say anything about it. He couldn't blame Draco; if their roles had been reversed, he'd probably be doing the same thing. As it was, he was happy to be fully conscious of his best friend again. Even with his new awkwardness around Draco, it was still better than seeing him through a tired delirium like he had the past few months.
“But they all sound so interesting!” Hermione said earnestly.
“Want me to come with you?” Draco asked.
“I guess,” Draco said, getting up. Harry rolled his eyes and followed him out.
Harry looked over at Draco and Theo as he pulled on his arm guards. “You nervous?”
“Well, yeah,” Harry replied as he shovelled coins into his money bag.
“Well, when you're finished, you can join your father and myself in the lounge for tea.”
“We've got Quidditch practice tomorrow after breakfast,” Harry told him, getting changed into his pyjamas.
Harry didn't see either of them in the common room, so wandered into the dorm. Theo was reading on his bed. Harry noted with amusement that the clipping of himself and Lockhart had been taken down from beside Theo's bed.
“Precisely,” replied the knocker. The door swung open and the girls disappeared inside.
“Flint's yelling at Wood right now, he's convinced the Gryffindor team did it,” Gemma said as she sat next to Hermione.
“Why – oh, he still doesn't like her?”
Ginny blushed. “Me?”
The girl sighed as she slouched over to a curtained doorway. “Mr Ainsley! Customer to see ya!” She went back to her post behind the register. “He'll be here in a sec,” she said, then started flipping through her magazine again.
“Cheers, Malfoy,” Harry replied, as Tilly set to work.
“Fair enough. Listen, have you had a look at these Lockhart books?”
He pushed open a door, and the room within lit up at once. Harry's first thought was that the room was very aptly named. A pale green rug covered most of the hardwood floor. The wooden furniture was pale as well, and the bed and armchairs were covered with a matching pale green fabric. Darker green drapes were pulled open on the windows, which showed the vast gardens outside.
Hermione looked at him curiously. “Oh, alright then. But not for long.”
“Who?”
Snape cleared his throat. “Once Mr Malfoy had opened the entrance to the Chamber, I felt it was far too dangerous for him to accompany me down.”
“That's what house-elves are for. Honestly!” Draco shook his head. “Forget about your hair, we don't have all night.”
Draco started getting dressed quickly. “I'm taking you to Pomfrey. You must be coming down with something.”
Ginny turned around, looking a little startled. “Yes?”
“Er, hello. Can I help you?” he asked it nervously. He had no idea why a house-elf would be in his room.
Harry exchanged an incredulous look with Draco. In the row in front of them, Theo was muttering to Tracey.
Draco grumbled as he got his own warm clothes out, but he pocketed the letter and followed Harry out of the room. As they walked through the common room Greg called out for them to join him and Vince in a game of Exploding Snap, but let them go when Draco said they were headed for the library.
“Besides which, I think he'd be more than capable of detecting a poison you tried to give him,” Hermione was saying. “Have you read his books? I'd be very surprised if there weren't some Dark creatures looking for revenge, he would have considered the possibility of being poisoned.”
, it read. He followed the Malfoys inside and stopped in confusion.
As soon as they were out in the corridor, Draco said urgently, “Sir, it's because of us.”
Dobby gave a frightened squeak and nodded his head quickly. “Dobby can make that deal, Harry Potter.”
“Here, girl – take your book –” he thrust it into her hands. “It's the best your father can give you.” He twisted out of Hagrid's grip and snarled at Draco. “Buy your books and let's go!”
“She's not dead, Argus,” Dumbledore finally said, facing the janitor, making Lockhart snap his mouth shut.
Harry looked at the ceiling in confusion. It sounded like it was heading up somehow. He spun around and dashed up the stairs. He couldn't hear anything in the Entrance Hall as there was too much noise coming from the Great Hall. He swore and went up the marble staircase.
“Well, they had a screaming row, which was unusual, as they don't really shout much. I could hear them all the way from my room. Judging from the crashes, I think Mother demolished a large part of Father's study; it took most of the house-elves a week to get it sorted again. And then it all went quiet and a while later, Father came up and told me I'd be going to Hogwarts after all.”
“Fair enough,” Draco replied. “Are you sitting with us today?”
“Harry?” Hermione appealed.
Muted but urgent conversation broke out all over the room. Harry headed straight for his room and retrieved his Cloak. A few minutes later he handed it over to Snape when he entered the room. Snape cocked his head.
“Ask them!” Filch pointed to Harry and Draco.
Draco cocked his head. “I think it's coming from in there,” he said, pointing at the door the water was coming from. There was an out of order sign on it.
Harry nodded. “Ollie's favourite phrase.”
“But I booked the pitch! I booked it!” Wood yelled. Despite the fact that he looked close to frothing at the mouth, Harry couldn't help admiring his accent.
Harry looked up at Ginny. “You can sit down. I just wanted to know how you were doing. You know, after the whole possession thing.”
“No!” Harry struggled again.
Harry grinned and returned to prising fudge out of the tin, when the sound of Draco swearing made him look up. “What's wrong?”
“He didn't want to play in the first place –” said Fred.
“I'm sure I don't know what you mean,” Draco said haughtily.
“Yeah...” Harry looked at Draco for help, but the blonde was busy avoiding his eye by patting Fang. “We wanted to ask you, er, well... It's about the Chamber of Secrets.”
“So am I, that game sounds really fun.”
“Of course. See you in September,” Draco said.
“He's awake!” Draco cried. Harry tilted his head back to find that Draco was kneeling on the ground with Harry's head cradled on his legs, with the rest of the team standing around him. “Are you alright?”
“Who do you think taught me manners?” Draco raised an eyebrow.
“Happy Valentine's Day!” Lockhart called, beaming around the hall. “Yes, I've decided that what this school needed was a little bit of light-hearted fun! And so, let me introduce my troop of frolicsome cupids!”
“He got me to brew Pepperup Potion with him.”
“I'll make it, I've done it a hundred times, I could brew a Mandrake Restorative Draught in my sleep,” Lockhart announced.
Harry got his Walkman out and finished that week's assigned reading as he waited for his friends to wake up. He wasn't sure how much he took in though, as he couldn't get the image of that Hufflepuff's face out of his mind. Finch-Fletchley, Snape had called him. Harry sighed and put away his books and Walkman when the others started to wake up.
“Hi, Flint. Snape asked me to give you this,” Harry said and handed over the parchment.
“Now is not the time; I need to get you to McGonagall. Say 'close' in Parseltongue,” Snape ordered, as Draco shoved the Cloak into his pocket. When Harry did so, he spun around in time to see the hole they'd emerged from close up as it was replaced by a sink.
"Jewelry," the Merchieftainess said with authority. "He has many wives." She made a tiny snorting noise and shook her hair, which waved gracefully behind her. Some of her warriors frowned, and two or three swam a foot or two closer to her. This appeared to be some sort of strong political or cultural disagreement. Harry noted it, but didn't have any idea what it might mean for him and Malfoy, now or later.
Draco just stared, too surprised to answer.
“Very well, thank you,” Draco answered. He sounded… sincere. Harry was surprised, and turned around. Draco was lounging, nude, hard and smug. “I need to come,” he said. “Is your arse available?”

“Oh, yeah! We can cast it again, in future. We’ve plenty of nights.”
Mother looked surprised. She sipped tea, and Draco watched her use the action to help blanken her expression.
“Course,” Harry said, easily. “Hell, it can even be a real date, if you want. But either way, we should spend the night in Hogsmeade. Rent a room. Everything.”
t-T-t-T-t-T-t-T-t
“Your attitude has certainly done a 180,” Harry said, choosing to see where an aloof pose might get him.
Harry made a small noise, and Draco realized he found it distracting.
“Mm,” Draco said, and stroked his fingers through Harry’s messy hair.
“Just opening doors might be inadequate. Someone talented’s clearly after you. Extra caution’s not wrong.” Harry looked sideways, apparently worried how Draco might respond.
“M’well aware.” Draco sniffed. “She’s old enough to be my mother, after all.”
Nightfall, too.
with him. He’d apparently lost his virginity with a virginal Harry. It had been spectacular. And Pansy had almost certainly told the whole school about them anyway. Was there any way to salvage this situation
Sometimes Harry felt they broke new ones every day.
“My Lord,” Potter says easily.
Draco was still in the doorway minutes later when Harry looked up: green eyes unfocused, hair a wild black mess, body crackling with magic, cock discernibly erect. Draco was mesmerized. He wanted that man in his bed. He wanted that man in his
“You feel good,” Potter grunted at him as he fucked.
Harry needed a cheap, easy fix to his Draco problem. One that wouldn’t involve giving up the fucking. He was really not interested in giving up all the lovely fucking.
“It’s about Harry and Draco,” Andromeda said.

Afelgate waved a wand and Mouth went completely limp, barely moving at all as Afelgate brought the rest of the stones from her body and vanished them.
Harry wanted to take Draco out into the Muggle world a lot, as it happened. The first Muggle place they went was Draco’s local Aldi supermarket, because if there was anything Draco understood about the Muggle world, it was his grocery bill. Harry was impressed — and adorable — as Draco quickly and expertly picked out their dinner from the shelves, chatted with not one, but
"Okay," Malfoy said quietly, and they both began to strip, fast. Soon they were naked together, hard and kissing on the tiny cot, using the narrowness as an excuse to glue themselves to one another.
“But that’s bullshit. I’ve had sex with four people. Total. Including you, by the way.”
Harry peeked at him. Draco, too, was staring deeply into his dinner.
“It would be a shame to turn down an offer that tempting.” Harry said, approaching Draco slowly. He was smiling.
Imaginary, insecure, muffin-Harry had said he would be back in two hours. Those two hours would be over in about forty-five minutes. Obviously, (
“You knew?” Draco sputtered, all pretense at calm abandoned.
Sincerely,

what it means. Harry.”
Even after everything that had already happened that day, he was still a bit shocked that she simply winked, gathered the guards, and left. He took a deep breath and looked at his new slaves. He knew exactly what he wanted first.
They took naps every afternoon, and dressed in finery for dinner every night, even when it was only the two of them.
In Potions on Tuesday, Draco had every intention of concentrating on the lesson, but Potter was sitting nearby, and Draco had a perfect view of his neck and the side of his head. He kept getting caught staring, and eventually managed to stop. Or, at least, he wasn’t staring when the class ended. Not actively.
"Well," Draco drawled, "all right. But... drink? I would have preferred to hear you say that you like to lick it. To push your tongue into the heat of it, to swirl through the cream of the melted marshmallows and taste the sweetness of it."

in that quaint little Inn with Harry Potter… well. He would obviously be a sight more passionate than that earnest, simpering war hero. Draco might technically still be a virgin, but he was nonetheless certain that he was simply one hot man from being the most fantastic lover imaginable. He contemplated taking his lube and dildo out from their hiding place under his pillow, but decided that could wait until he was fully hard. It took some work to get all the privacy enchantments off them both, and he didn’t feel like dealing with that right now.
It didn't take long to check Hole, as he clearly didn't offer any particular sexual excitement for Afelgate. Harry did enjoy seeing his toy bent flat over the table, though, with the healer's gloved hand deep into his arse, checking for problems while the healer explained about the prostate to Harry.
Malfoy swallowed, then put on a brave face. “Okay.”
Harry listened, fascinated and thrilled. The sense of release he felt as Draco detailed every apology — offered and accepted — was beyond welcome.
He had to look — despite his unchanged finances — like the freaked-out post-war teenager with the thousand pound weight on each shoulder he usually felt himself to be.

Harry, however, stopped right in front of Draco’s desk.
Muttering Latin under his breath, Scrivener began painting Malfoy's skin. He encouraged Harry to jump in with advice.
"No, Harry, I don't." Draco pushed himself to speak. He closed his eyes and shoved at the words. Harry thought he was brave.
Soon he was at her kitchen table, drinking Oolong and repeating calculated phrases Grandfather had fed him.
“I could do that now?”
“After that, we will be near enough to Johannesburg that apparition is easy: back to the compound he shares with his children, daughters-in-law and grandchildren.”

“I’d be open to that,” Draco finally said, giving Harry a crooked smile. It was starting to snow. “But first I require a double firewhiskey, neat.”
Potter’s eyes widened and he looked a bit stricken. “Er,” he paused. “I hope so? Is that… okay?”
Every kiss was perfect. Every thrust of Draco’s gorgeous cock. Every murmured word. Every caress, every firm grasp, and every confident push.
That night Harry cuddled a distinctly less flirtatious and lighthearted Draco.
Harry’s mind went blank.
He explained how Mum pushed him at Harry, touched on his confusion regarding all the sleep-talk, described their miserable trip to Azkaban.
“I suppose,” Draco said, looking at the trees behind Harry.
“Holy Moses,” Harry laughed. “First of all, of course, and second of all, what happened?”
t-T-t-T-t-T-t-T-t
"But, Sir…" Harry tried. For once Robards didn't interrupt. Harry paused, waiting for it. When the flow of discouragement didn't return, Harry found he had no idea what he wanted to say.

something particularly useful, he might have a chance at selling it. So, when he had a spare moment here and there (often while he ate lunch), he would dream up things to try. And, on Saturdays, he would usually brew.

“To me?” Draco said, surprised. He squeezed Harry tightly, then let go, moving the few steps to sit on Harry’s grass-green chesterfield. He put his glass on the coffee table.
Malfoy just looked at him like he was stupid, and, properly chastised, Harry admitted that he could have done that also. The signs had been very clear. And the maps. "Because your last name sounds French?" He giggled.
“Of course you do,” Draco said in a falsely lofty voice. “You

Draco orgasmed spectacularly all over their clothes and was vaguely aware that Potter seemed to have had an orgasm as well.
, so she can, shall we say, help you forget all the unpleasant things you had to do to her this afternoon?"
"Harry?"
“So, I guess the first thing is, I’m so surprised to hear you say you’re a virgin? Because I thought we’d been having sex for over a week now. So I guess you think you’ll be a virgin until someone sticks his dick in your arse? Or, you know, vice versa. But, er, first, I don’t think that way about virginity, like, at all, and second, that won’t be me. You said I’m a top, but I know
"No! No, of course not, Draco. Nothing you don't want. I didn't say sadism and masochism, or domination for that matter. Not even discomfort! Just… restraints. I think that if you tied me up, or were restrained yourself - we should discuss it and see which makes more sense for you - it might help. Just this first time."
“It’s a merry-go-round,” Draco shrugged. “I guess it doesn’t matter where we get on.”
Harry threw open his pantry and gestured proudly. “What looks good, Draco? Be honest. I want to know what you like!”
“No, I promise,” Harry said. He kissed Draco’s cheek, right at the hottest crest of his blush. “Magic means never having to worry about, er, messes.” He winked.
“I’d be a poor guardian indeed if you were hurt on my watch,” Harry stammered.
"Yeah," Malfoy conceded, looking down. "My parents thought we would look too self-serving or something if we said that after you all escaped, the three of us got put in our own dungeon." His voice was quiet now. He sounded embarrassed. "Or maybe they just thought that part was too embarrassing to share. It was in the legal briefs, just, no one ever said anything about it out loud, in public." He still wasn't looking up from the floor.
He was diplomatic enough to pretend. “Then it’s settled, because it will help me stay awake.”

Malfoy sucked the end of Harry's dick hard, his now quite wet hand moving fast over Harry's cock. He let go with his mouth, making up for it by jerking off the whole thing with his hand. "Do you want me to?"

“As lovely as this is,” he began, and Harry looked crushed. “No, not that,” he soothed. “I was just going to say that we are both really hungry, and that I’d rather do this for real, and naked, and after we eat. All right?”
Harry laughed, kissed him, and grabbed his wand. “Probably,” he agreed, and started cleaning them up.
Narcissa paled – her composure wobbly. Evading her touch, Draco walked to the window.
“So,” Draco said, feeling warm and relaxed. “Now we know how I would like to do this, what about you?”
“Thank you, Aunt,” he said. “It would be a pleasure and an honor. I promise to study hard and bring praise to both my houses. I shall return to the Manor and pack.”

"I'm so fucking sorry." Harry said, astonished that he'd never really said any such thing until he was balls deep into the other boy.
“Tell me?”
Draco opened his eyes and looked blearily around. “Merlin’s balls,” he whispered. “That was really good. Give me a minute or two to catch my breath and I’ll return the favor, all right? Whatever you want.” He caught Harry’s eye and winked lasciviously. “You absolutely earned it.” He could tell that his smile was goofy, but he simply didn’t care.
Harry nodded.
“Only that no-one could claim dating me makes
“This is perfect,” Harry managed back.
“This is beyond horrifying,” Draco murmured.
Mr. Malfoy's voice rose as he urged, and the baby - Draco - cried out. Mrs. Malfoy made soothing noises and, from the sound of it, picked the baby up and held him. Mr. Malfoy continued to talk, louder now - more determined to convince. "This belonged to Rowena Ravenclaw herself, Cissy! And the Dark Lord is entrusting me with it. He told me that if I kept it safe for a year or so he might entrust me with another object that is even more important to him. I cannot possibly refuse!
Harry couldn't have told you what colour it was, some sort of pink, maybe. But in his opinion it was a good colour for
, Harry grabbed Draco. Kissed him.
They were climbing the stairs to McGonagall's office unannounced, when Malfoy heard something and stopped walking. He put a finger to his lips but Harry had already taken the hint. They both stood on the stairs, making no noise and listening intently. It didn't take long before Harry heard something -- probably the Sorting Hat again -- complaining angrily, presumably to McGonagall.
Harry had watched Malfoy eavesdrop as a pack of Gryffindors discussed potential boyfriends over lunch. Harry knew he’d heard gossip about the common room conversation. Parvati’d had detention with Parkinson that very night! Still, though. No reactions.
He considered, silent, sharing nothing with Mother, as he followed her wet feet across the dead, brown grass and patchy snow; from the shore of Eynhallow to the ruined chapel, so far from where the boat landed.
Green eyes were tightly shut, and Harry was forcing himself to breathe normally. After inspecting his face for a moment, Draco decided Harry would be fine and returned to examining Harry's shins.
want? Is all that matters?”
“Then I’ll be testing your father’s assertions the old fashioned way,” the King said, and he moved to stand directly in front of Draco. “Unfasten my breeches, get me hard, then please me with your mouth. Your goal is to swallow my entire release.”
The men sat at Draco's dining room table, and Draco served Harry some of the clear vegetable soup.
“Harry,” Draco said, trying not to whine. “Stop talking. More kissing.”
They were good for one another, he thought, and he put a hand on hers and smiled.
Potter and Draco stared at one another, and, as Draco felt his face heating and his spine solidifying, he watched as Potter’s eyes drained of hope and his smile drained of happiness.
“That’s… true,” Draco said, but he was still frowning.
“Patronus?” Harry tried. “Or, Molly made me take an owl.”
“I see,” Potter declares, looking extremely intrigued. “I must say, the idea of a cock sucking expert with many hours of careful study under his belt, who nonetheless hasn’t actually sucked off a lot of men…. Suddenly your application has real appeal, Malfoy.”
Narrowing his eyes, Draco tried to regain his control. “You like teasing?” he asked, putting his own hand onto Harry’s abs.
“Of course,” Harry agreed from inside Andromeda’s pantry cupboard, looking at no-one. “I just, er, thought, we should share something delicious!”
“I want to have sex,” he said upwards, still looking at the ceiling. “With you. Tonight would be good, if, I mean, if that’s something you also want.”
“So that’s everything,” Draco finished. “Mother is still homophobic, I’m still her devoted son.” He slugged back the last of his whiskey. “To a point.”
Draco knew he must have looked horrified at both suggestions because Harry stopped that train of thought and began another.
“I was just, er, brewing…,” some moronic part of him was apparently saying instead.
It was a twenty-five hour overnight train trip, so they'd had to hire a sleeper car for the leg that took them from Paris to Milan. Malfoy was the one who'd figured out that McGonagall hadn't cut off their supply of "amenities." Though they had spent hours sitting stiffly next to one another with Muggle magazines and making rare and awkward small talk on the way to Paris, once they switched trains it hadn't taken long for them to find the café-bar and get rollicking drunk, sitting on the floor of their tiny sleeper car, making fun of Snape's wraith and finally learning to get along.
“As for the doorway, have you not heard the approximately six thousand times I’ve gushed about how much money this could make me, if I can learn to do it properly?” He gave Draco a truly insouciant smile, and finally Draco laughed.
Harry realized he wanted more. He slid both hands free from Malfoy's dressing gown and tried to put his hands on Malfoy's arse. When he found it, it was covered with bunches of fabric from Malfoy's pyjamas and dressing gown. He started trying to move the fabric out of the way to get a good grip on Malfoy's arse, and Malfoy started to moan and press his hips into Harry's.
Harry breathed heavily, as Draco continued to tease him. A tongue touch here, a fingertip there. “But I’m keeping you from your chores,” he eventually whispered.
“That’s not true,” Draco admitted. “I’ve been a coward where Mother is concerned.”
“You and Harry seem very happy,” Mother offered. “I noticed on Monday, those flowers he brought you.”
“Why?” Draco asked as he began to ease into the sofa, feeling like a large blond cat.
Draco put his empty glass down and nodded. He followed Harry to a bedroom and shut the door behind him. Then Harry pushed him up against it, and Draco felt himself melt.
Draco peered at the bakery box. “It’s full of coffee,” he said, sadly. He’d been looking forward to trying the cranberry one, he realized.
Sighing, Draco removed a few layers of magical protection from his person after throwing a casual stasis spell over his work. He wasn’t late on his rent, but it was probably his landlord anyway. Mr O’Sullivan liked to stop by fairly frequently. Usually he was warning Draco about some work he was going to do on the building: dismantle and fix the lift, redo the plumbing on Draco’s floor, things of that nature. Sometimes, however, O’Sullivan just stopped by on far flimsier excuses. Draco had the impression O’Sullivan might think it his duty to check up on the Death Eater. Nonetheless, he tried to be polite. The problem was, he didn’t enjoy the older man’s company. He wasn’t best pleased to answer his door right now. He was busy. But, Mum had taught him proper manners so he tried to wipe all traces of scowling from his face before he pulled the door open.
Harry finally spoke. "Yes, Draco. I trust you like that. I would allow you to take my wand out of my hands, undress me, and tie me up, in magical ropes. I know I would not regret it."
“Mm,” Harry agreed, and blushed.
So it went. Harry continued to lie carefully, casually, (not frequently!) about Draco’s “sleep talk;” Draco seemed increasingly convinced. Harry mentioned it in the shower, over squares of toast, as they walked each other to class.
They would be in Lecce fairly soon, and then he and Malfoy would have to sneak their bizarre little craft into the Mediterranean and spend a few days together trying to figure out what to expect from King Greynrushes and how to get him to do what they wanted. All alone in a tiny little submarine with nothing to distract them from one another.
Harry
Andromeda nodded.
Draco, Harry realized, was normally more controlled than Harry was. Even when they were little boys of eleven, and neither of them had much self-possession, Draco – Harry decided – had more.
t-T-t-T-t-T-t-T-t
Afelgate pulled Mouth's arse to the very end of the table, then he looked at Harry. "This is normally done with a wand, Mr Potter, but I gather you'd like me to use my hands?" He was grinning now, and looked hopeful.
And Draco had to stay right where he was, standing right on top of that gold X in the middle of the marble drawing room floor, and come “without a partner.” Mostly meaning no one could directly touch anyone else’s cock.
Narcissa finished her tea and poured herself some more. She stared out the window. She traced the pattern on the chair’s upholstery once again.
Nervous, Harry scuffed a foot against the baseboard as he walked. “We might have to just… lock both sides and forget it.”
"I hate following stupid rules, though. And I have to admit, I'm not always good at telling stupid rules from good ones. I hate paperwork. I can hardly tell you what a relief it is to know that I don't have to sit down and write up what just happened back there, in fucking triplicate, no less.
“Second,” Harry pushed closer and Draco curled toward him, “what does that imply? For… summer?”
“Granger,” Draco said, flat and annoyed.
“I assume you are wondering why I am here,” Draco began.
Feeling utterly out of his depth, Harry just nodded at Merchieftainess Murcus, hoping his confusion could be mistaken for respect -- at least through a bubble-head charm.
“Some mugg—men, people, think gays are dangerous to children.” He watched Draco’s face carefully, wondering if he might get lied to.
Draco hid his deep breath and let Mother bring up Landers.

“Then perhaps,” Potter said, grinning, “you should take me to your dorm room and show me the list?”
Then he'd gotten drunk with Harry, laughed at Harry's jokes, tried to hide his attraction and responded with overwhelming enthusiasm when Harry had asked for permission to….
“I suppose it might help me sleep,” Draco offered, but Harry knew it was an excuse.
Eventually Harry wondered aloud if Draco might want another pudding, but the waiter appeared, apologetic and embarrassed. Only then did Harry and Draco realize that they were the last ones there who weren’t staff, that it was closing in on midnight, that they had been talking nonstop for over four hours.
Bedtime was good, too.
“Oh,” Draco said, leaning back, hips thrust forward provocatively. “I wouldn’t say I’m not…
“Son.” She spoke calmly. “I apologize for frightening you. But I have rested. I’ve taken my potions. I am well enough to sit and discuss... important issues.”

"What, just 'good'?"
“Sure,” Harry said, seizing the opportunity to step fully away from Draco’s warm,
,” Draco insisted. “Mother herself expressed some uncertainty about him, his invitations. You weren’t there for that, I don’t think.” He screwed up his forehead for a moment, trying to remember. “But she essentially requested that I develop an opinion,” Draco said.
"Oh," he said. "Sure. What bloke."
“Good, then I would like you to suck my cock right now. If I come, you should go home and pack for a week’s stay here. I will need you to remain confined to my home for the full week, even when I am not physically inside the house or on the grounds.
“Harry,” barked Neville’s Newfoundland patronus, coming through the wall. “We caught the perpetrator. Please bring Malfoy downtown.”
Potter sighed, but he looked resigned, not annoyed. “I can understand that,” he said. “I’ve been dealing with gossip since I first got here.” Then a gleam came into his eyes. “But, you know, an awful lot of that gossip came from you. Didn’t it?”
“Er…” Neville said, and it sounded slightly thoughtful.
Lymphogranuloma Venereum: Negative
“I do not think gay men are dangerous to children. I do not believe you would ever hurt Teddy. Ever. I trust you with my life, Harry Potter, with good reason, and I am confident that Teddy can do the same. Aunt Andromeda clearly feels you are trustworthy, as well.”
Sliding gold silk off his shoulders.
"Could you
With that, Severus had turned away from Draco. He returned to the window and seemed to look down on the street below. He silently waved his wand toward the front door and appeared to expect Draco to simply walk out without another word.
“Time turner,” Draco answers plainly.
Draco did a poor job of hiding his scarlet reaction.
Harry held the door for him as they left, and they turned toward Draco’s neighborhood. Draco checked the sky and saw it had finished clearing. The rain clouds were fully gone and the day was warmer. “Shall we walk again, then?” he asked, and Harry smiled, half at the ground, half at Draco.
He kissed Harry, who kissed him back, then grinned.

"Well, he's a good man. He's a good auror, too. He even goes out drinking with us sometimes, tells us stories about shit that's gone down. Stuff he and the others have done."

“Among other things,” Draco repeated, uncomfortable. He released a breath, but slowly. He didn’t want Harry figuring out how nervous and off-balance he felt.
“Yes, er, lunch was really brilliant, I should thank you….”
Harry wanted to hold his hand in public. Draco liked it, so he was learning to let him.

He rolled them so Draco could fuck his face, and Draco came soon after.
But Harry smiled, lowered his shoulders a bit, breathed out slow. Draco found himself doing the same.
For a straight bloke, Malfoy could
"You're plenty sexy," Afelgate said, and shoved his cock all the way into her fanny. She squealed once, then started pushing back against him, using the medical table for leverage.
"Of course you do, Draco. What you really mean, I would wager, is that you don't know how to immediately shift into the most spine-tingling shag I've ever had. Isn't that right?"
“I apologize for the formalities, Herr Potter, but since your Aunt isn’t here, and this request is for a valuable sum…”
“He seems... acceptable,” Draco admitted.
“Highbrow?” Draco finished for him, laughing.
McGonagall had tried to forbid eighth years from socializing in House common rooms. This, however, had proven impossible to enforce. If an eighth year “former” Hufflepuff was dating a seventh year current Hufflepuff, could staff really stop them cuddling on a Hufflepuff couch? Thus, eighth years had ignored this ruling from day one, and it was very easy for Harry and Draco to avoid one another.
Draco found himself leaning forward in his chair, eager for his Grandfather’s wisdom.
"Er, Draco?"
Draco meandered toward his brewing and took the stasis spells off. Everything seemed to be exactly as he had left it, and he began to move things back into place, but stopped – distracted – as he continued to consider the fantasy he’d just had. Why hadn’t he imagined Harry demanding sex? Unconsciously, Draco stroked at his prick through his clothing. He did so enjoy those fantasies where Harry confidently, casually demanded his submission. Why wouldn’t he have pushed the scenario in that direction? Granted, having Harry come to his very front door was a great start, but (he was rubbing harder at his dick now, and getting fully hard as he considered how his fantasy should have gone) a decent choice would have had Harry offering a hot drink and then wanting a blowjob while Draco’s mouth was still burning hot. Or perhaps he should have imagined that eating Harry’s muffin would have condemned Draco, Persephone-style, to a certain amount of time speared on the prongs of Harry’s staff.
Harry felt self-conscious but Draco wasn’t mocking. “Not very romantic,” he tried. “Sorry.”

“I suppose it isn’t rational, but… earlier, when you declared me the perfect boyfriend… you know that is actually you, do you not?”
“I… see,” Narcissa said, sipping tea. The Ministry Litigator (no older than Draco!), steepled her fingers and looked at her, calm and quiet, waiting for her to be ready for more. “Peculiar that I don’t remember him.”
Finally, she spoke. “I care because I want Harry’s relationship to be real. If you aren’t happy, too, then it isn’t going to last. I want you to be happy, too, Draco, because I want Harry to have everything he wants and needs. Somehow, that’s you.”
Interest sparked in Harry’s eyes as Draco’s posture changed. He raised half his mouth into a smile and turned quickly toward his kitchen, where he made short work of putting all the leftovers away and dunking the dirtied dishes into a sink full of soapy water.
"Yes, sir," Kreacher said. "Which slave should Kreacher bring for venerable Master to violate?"
"I don't wish to be disrespectful," Malfoy said slowly, "but with magic, I might be able to restore it somewhat. If that would be welcome?"
Then they fell off the little sofa and onto the recently spell-scrubbed floor.
Mother’s face went white. Then slightly pink. Then completely blank.
When Vissy vanished, Draco took one decisive step towards the conservatory, then stopped. He felt Harry’s hands perch softly on his shoulderblades.
“Hungry?” Draco cocked his head. He wasn’t, but they could get a small meal eaten so hunger was out of the way. They had better things to do.
“Mr Potter and I are now busy. I will not answer the Floo or any owls. Not even from Mother. Has anyone contacted me since we completed the last section of wards?”
Draco nodded.
“Mmm…” Harry said. “Does that mean you
Draco’s aunt straightened her very straight spine, looked her sister in the eye, and started again. “Yes, Draco, I was saying changing to correspondence learning might be wise.”
They lay together like that, in the quiet, for many long minutes.
She leveled a look at him, and then tipped her head just the slightest bit to the left. Since they had been friends from the age of three, Draco knew this meant he had won, but he worked to keep this knowledge from reaching his eyes. (Or worse, his mouth). “I suppose that hiding yourself away in your bed does work for you,” she conceded. “Even I was impressed by that Transfigurations essay you emerged with a few days ago.”
need them.”
Mother did not react, but Draco thought he was making an impression, nonetheless.
done first. The first time I have you in my bed, Potter, I’d like to be behind the best wards on earth, and have hours for my exploration.”
The next figure turned out to be Pansy Parkinson, and Harry stumbled out of his chair. Getting an encouraging nod from the elder, he stepped next to Pansy, watching her fight the silencing charm that kept her from giving all of them her opinion. Goyle had been nearly naked, which Harry had done his best to ignore, but it was a good look for Parkinson. Harry circled her, his erection forming quickly and the blush again threatening to self-combust, but he did his best to ignore that as he appreciated the view of a young woman stripped to a loincloth and chains purely for his own amusement.
“It’s strange, how little you say,” Draco said, pulling away to look into Harry’s eyes.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
It was enough to make a man pull out a mangled, ancient, hand-me-down copy of the employee manual, and find the section where it unambiguously stated:
“So, trained cocksucker, eh?”
It had been… excruciating and perfect.
Draco woke him in the morning when they arrived near enough the castle to see it.
“Me too,” Harry sighed out. “Merlin, Draco. Me too.”
“Yes,” Harry said.
“Yes,” he said firmly. “And let me guess. The whole school has been chatting about it since they realized, and everyone has a theory.”
Now Harry wasn’t miserably chasing after a boy who didn’t want him, he could enjoy Quidditch, meals, and even classes more.
for the first time. Or like a man lost in a desert might stare at a glass of water he could almost reach.
“Justice Department ruled Aurors can question Matthew Rosscot under Veritaserum, long as his own Litigator’s present.”
Harry tried to keep annoyance off his face. Though he’d years of practice, Draco was more observant than self-involved teenagers. Harry knew immediately he had not succeeded.
“Of course not!” Harry almost exploded. “I don’t even know how you —”
-" Severus had fairly hissed the name, "-was a bastard. May the gods eat his soul. Don't you know why you have no siblings?"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
"Er…" Harry said, and lay down on the floor. There was so little space. "Because you guided us through the train station when we switched trains?"
Draco grinned broadly. “You’re such a pervert. I love it! Yes, let’s definitely record ourselves fucking. We should make a presentation of it, fuck in multiple positions.”
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

to London and bought train tickets to Italy. Once in Lecce they would put the tent back into the sea and cross the Mediterranean. They estimated they had cut seven weeks off their trip. One way.

The house appeared in front of them as Harry kissed him, so Draco kind of missed the magic, but kissing Harry was pretty magical too, if he was allowed to be sappy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Malfoy glared at Harry. "I… what's
Trichomoniasis: Negative
. He was almost ludicrously attractive. He kissed like a dream. He was smart, and funny. He liked a lot of the same things Harry liked.
"What do I owe you?" Harry's voice sounded as tight and uncomfortable as his trousers were beginning to feel. He hadn't been so uneasy, or so aroused, in longer than he could remember. Not that he was able to ponder timelines calmly at the moment.
Harry smiled indulgently at him. Then he winked. “Shameless,” he teased.
“Let’s eat,” Neville responded modestly. “I’m starved.” They headed down to the Great Hall together.
"I don't like the 'Malfoy' part," he admitted, feeling unsure of himself. "It reminds me of your father, and he reminds me of Voldemort. But your first name is pretty brilliant, don't you think? Named after dragons and something in the sky… a galaxy? I can't remember."
Potter dumped all his books on the floor and turned slightly, got a little closer to Draco.
Though they’d fucked nearly a dozen times, tonight felt different. It wasn’t that Draco felt shy. More that Harry seemed to be treating him
arse, who couldn’t stay away. Unlike Harry, who was perfectly fine without Malfoy!
There. Dressed. It was suitable for a date, for a day at work, for lunch with his mother or a friend. It was a little conservative, but the colours were good and the fit was still correct. Not tight, not sexy, just appropriate. It would do. It would do whether or not Harry knocked. It would do whether Harry suggested a fancy restaurant or a casual one. It would do whether Harry wanted Diagon Alley or had a portkey to somewhere… else. Which he wouldn’t, because there was no way that the real life Harry Potter was going to knock on Draco’s door a first time today, let alone a second.
Draco swung his eyes to Harry’s, sudden and wary.
“Okay,” Draco agreed. “Parchment?”
Draco watched, fascinated, as the Manor took shape under Harry’s slender quill.
Neville laughed again, smiling. Harry sat on the windowsill and looked toward the room, but he wasn’t really paying attention to Neville right now. His eyes were nominally focused on the top of the door frame, but his mind was far away.
"Harry," Draco said, speaking in a loud, clear voice. He drew even closer to Harry and took Harry's right hand into both of his own. "Will you be my business partner? Complete equals? Solving problems, our own men, no paperwork, wizards for hire?"
Harry cupped his balls in his left hand, rubbed circles around the head of his cock to tease his foreskin a bit, and gave himself over to his memory. Malfoy was pretty and he smelled nice, but he was far too thin. He looked strained and brittle, like a favorite teacup that finally succumbs to elaborate crazing. And how did Harry know so much about what Malfoy looked like, anyway? It was just as Ron kept telling him. He really was obsessed.
Harry started working on the Fusion Doorway the morning Narcissa left for her trip.
"That all sounds delicious, Draco. Shall we start with some soup? And you can tell me what you've been up for the past two months."
“Hard, you say? Fast?” His hand was millimetres from Draco’s prick, and Draco was straining to stay still. “Dirty?”
They meandered around town, looking at churches until Harry was sick of them. Then they
“Promised you a blowjob,” Harry said, and nipped at Draco’s thighs.
“So,” Harry said, adjusting little Teddy more comfortably on his hip, “I see you and Teddy have made friends?”
Draco ran his fingers through his hair and then marveled at his own lack of control. He had not allowed Harry to see him so disheveled since the night he'd spent vomiting up his fears.
“You’re the hero,” Draco said.
open that storefront you mentioned, if I liked."
But Harry continued to talk, and Draco remembered he’d actually been asked to keep his mouth shut anyway. So his complete lack of intelligent response was actually a good thing right now.
They set off, and Draco didn’t know what to say, but Harry seemed to. He launched into chatter about the reconstruction of Hogwarts, talked a bit about how his friends had needed to go all the way to Australia to rescue Hermione’s parents from some sort of self-imposed exile Draco didn’t fully follow, and then asked about Draco’s friends.
Andromeda waved gently, encouraging her sister.
Draco tried not to make his envy plain as he wrote.
At first, going back and forth was fun. Like the sleepovers Harry hadn’t been permitted as a child. They learned the nooks and crannies of one another’s homes, shared dinner with Narcissa every other night, bought extra toothbrushes and shared shampoo.
Over and over they played this “game” with Teddy’s gummy, damp stuffed rabbit. Dozens of times Teddy chewed it, threw it, then giggled as Draco floated it back to him through the air.
Then he Flooed to Harry’s and sat, heavily, on Harry’s grass-green chesterfield. Harry was at his hand moments later with a full tea tray, plus the offer of two empty glasses and a full bottle of scotch.

“You brought up
"As per usual, you think you know everything. But you don't know anything! You jump in like you can handle fucking anything!"
Neville was still looking down at the perfectly tidy shelf. “If it were that easy, Harry…”
On Thursday, Potter tricked Draco into following him into an empty room, claiming it was about a Potions question. But once the door was closed Potter yanked Draco to the floor and they kissed and rubbed against each other and squeezed each other’s arses – trying not to make noise and failing – until Draco came and he ran away in terror again.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
"Shhh, sweet. Just enjoy."
"Er," Malfoy said after a large swallow of pumpkin juice. He cleared his throat. "I don't think you're useless, you know. The merpeople were impressed to meet the wizard who defeated Voldemort. And you knew how to duplicate the map and I didn't. And, er, I wouldn't want to do this stupid job alone. Not really. Not at all."
Hermione and Ron were eager to know everything, but he made it clear that he couldn't talk about it and went up to bed. He told himself he was tired, but when he was finally in his pyjamas with clean teeth and hiding behind his thick, warm curtains, Harry was able to admit to himself that it wasn't exhaustion that had sent him to his bed only two hours after dinner ended. He was hard. His mind was full of his encounter with an aggressive, sneering, white-pink-gold pretty Malfoy.
Harry hid the note in an inner pocket and nodded at Ron.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
He wants to scream, either at the injustice or to express his physical pleasure, but no matter why he might, he cannot. And so, silent, Draco bears the theft of his virginity with tremendous grace and the fattest, hardest erection possible. It is wrapped up in the pad Potter has inadvertently made of Draco’s prison robes, pressed hard against the heavy table.
Having agreed, they put together a short list for their porny presentation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Scrivener looked sympathetic. "Yes, distasteful to the modern mind, but there it is. At any rate, most of these tattoos were given before the slave's magic had a chance to mature. So if you wished for two or even three forms of control, I recommend trying. There would be little risk to you."
“Gladly,” Draco said, smiling. They rearranged themselves and Draco slid back in.
Draco finally stood and moved to stand next to the bed. Now he was less than two feet from Harry's shoulder. He reached out and touched Harry there, rather like Harry had touched him earlier, in front of Draco's fireplace. It made all the difference in the world that Harry now had no cloth over his skin.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
“Yes, the way you’re attempting to enter it right now gives you away,” Draco said, aiming for a stern tone and failing.
Once he was ready for bed, and sealed up within it, it took him all of thirteen minutes to complete the second half of his Muggle Studies assignment. He even did a thorough outline of his next Charms essay while he was at it, and read ahead two chapters in his Potions textbook for good measure. But when he was done, it was still only eight forty five in the evening, and he grinned as he hid his books away. The promise of a powerful orgasm was a strong motivator. He was done for the night
Harry rolled his eyes. “Whatever it takes, Malfoy.”
. He was suddenly, immeasurably sad. Draco insisted Harry couldn’t be in love with him. Maybe Draco was right about that, but whatever this feeling technically was, Draco had ripped it and stomped on it and…
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
He flooed away.
Running his fingers through his shaggy hair.
“I needed to know more about this
“Then, don’t.”
have questions, it was only that he couldn't think of a single one. Ron probably would have had ten.
"No they don't," Malfoy said, looking at Harry like he was a moron.
Some Auror did it instead. “Can’t tell you if she’s here, Rosscot, but if she is, she’ll be listening to every word you say. So,
, Draco. I want to touch you, fuck, all the time, basically. It’s getting distracting at work, to be honest. It’s why I finally told the Head Auror. But as much as I want to touch you, and, er, uh, taste you, and, Merlin, just be near you and ask you questions and listen to your answers and… all that, I just, I don’t, there are things I don’t really want to do right now, you know? And, I guess, if that were the only way you were willing to be naked with me, I might, uh, have to reconsider? But, you know, we’ve been fooling around for days and it’s been so amazing, and I thought you were enjoying it as much as I was? So, um, that’s all I have right now. Do you, er, have anything you want to say in response?”
"I like it, Kreacher," Harry decided. "Thanks for the idea. Get them both up here immediately. Unchained, please."
"Master is too kind," Kreacher said, then hesitated. "The slaves will be here to serve your erection in seconds," he said, and then vanished after he saw Harry smile broadly.
“Oh, Merlin,” Harry said, trying not to look too smug. Was he Draco’s first boyfriend?
Harry motioned Seamus and Neville over to join him and the girls. “Tell me about
She patted his hand and smiled. “Let’s hear what you really have to say, child. You won’t scare me off. I’m family. I have to like you.”
It led him to a sunny, airy room at the end of the hallway. Narcissa’s bedroom, clearly. He saw nothing amiss at first, but his wand brought him to the bed, and there – drawing back crumpled blankets – he nearly vomited. Semen. Feces. Blood.
“No, Sir,” Draco admitted, and sitting in a large wingback chair, he had Dybbin bring tea. Slowly, seeking feedback throughout, he began to explain.
Harry leaned back into the couch and nodded at Scrivener to go on.
“Sire,” Draco said, overcome.
They lost themselves in one another, kissing like lovers. Like they were alone. Like they were heading for bed.
** - _ - ** - _ - ** - _ - ** - _ - ** - _ - ** - _ - ** - _ - ** - _ - **
Draco insisted on stumbling upstairs on his own feet, but he wasn’t going to refuse Harry’s arm around his waist or the chance to put his own arm around Harry’s neck. At least one house-elf (possibly both?) followed behind discreetly, and it was Bippy that dressed Draco in silk nightclothes while Harry was in the loo.
Until early Saturday when an owl awakened him, pecking his window.
Harry wanted to take Draco away for a weekend. Harry wanted Draco to help him choose the location, the hotel, the itinerary. But Harry was going to pay for everything.
“Now, I am uncertain between right and wrong. I suspect, however, things are far more complex than I was told. I’ve much to consider.”
Harry said nothing, vividly recalling the moment when this girl tried to throw him to Voldemort.
Potter dropped his dressing gown on the tiled floor and grinned. Underneath he was completely nude and not completely flaccid. He jumped into the bath, strode over to Draco, and pressed up against him.
Harry was as beautiful as Draco reluctantly recalled. He was as responsive, as eager, as good at kissing as he had been from the beginning. His ability to get Draco so hard he couldn’t think had only improved while they had been apart.
“Of course you are. Could anyone be comfortable with this?” Yes, that was the tone of voice Draco had been aiming to hear. Potter sounded a bit hopeful now, along with the tinge of disgust and despair.

The corner of Snape's mouth twitched. “I would advise you to simply weigh up the situation. Is socialising with Miss Granger worth running the risk of being Petrified?”
“Stay away from him, or I'll have the whole school playing Let's Throw Things at Myrtle,” Draco said fiercely.
Harry shook his head. “Tom's not going to waste me on the basilisk anyway.”
“No second year could have done this. It would require advanced knowledge of Dark magic to do such a thing,” Dumbledore said firmly.
“And Harry!” Daphne let go of Draco and hugged Harry. She pulled back and looked him up and down. “Wow, Harry, you look great. Really great.”
“Next time you find an object that, like the diary, appears to have unusual magic, bring it to me so that I may determine its safety. I promise I'll return it to you if it's safe.”
Draco nodded and followed him to Snape's office. Harry hid a smile as he knocked on the door. Being injured did have its upsides, as Draco was far more biddable when he was worried about Harry.
“I didn't do anything. It was my mum. My
“Is it dead?” Harry asked.
Uncle Vernon shooed the Masons back into the dining room, then returned and handed Harry a mop as he listed with relish the various punishments he'd be inflicting on Harry. Aunt Petunia found some ice cream in the freezer, and Harry thought hopefully that Uncle Vernon might not be too hard on him if he managed to secure the business deal he was after.
Lockhart clapped his hands. “One... Two... Three!”
“Is there a reason you're walking so slowly?” Harry asked.
Harry jumped back from the door, checked that the loose floorboard was properly flush with the rest of the floor, and sat down on his bed. Outside, the footsteps slowed and then stopped. Another lighter set came up the stairs more slowly, and then a woman's voice said something too quietly for Harry to make out.
“Just don't mention her, alright?” Draco whispered yet again. He and Harry were waiting for Mr Malfoy in the foyer, both clutching their Hogwarts letters.
Draco stared at him. “
Harry narrowed his eyes. “How do you know I haven't gotten any letters?”
“Say hello for me,” Harry said.
“No. I can't promise that.”
“So what was he like?” she asked breathlessly.
The class was lined up outside the classroom waiting for Lockhart to arrive, listening to Draco raving about the Nimbus 2001s that Mr Malfoy would be buying for the entire Slytherin team. Harry wasn't listening, as he had a perfectly good Nimbus 2000, and looked away to notice that the Creevey boy was staring at him. A group of equally small Gryffindors stood behind him.
“His dad bought the brooms
“Of course, you idiot,” she replied.
Both boys stared at her. “Exactly what?” Harry eventually asked.
He turned back around to see Lockhart picking up his wand. “Whoops! Jumpy wand!”
His spell must have hit Tom, because Harry couldn't hear him anymore. There was a scuffling sound followed by footsteps, then the sound of something very large sliding across the stone floor. Snape swore just before there was a loud bang and a tumble of rocks.
Draco beamed. “Mother, I'd like you to meet Hermione.”
Harry grimaced. “So, if it wasn't Aragog, do you know what might have done it?”
“Just Lockhart droning on about his fans,” Millicent said.
And then it was over, and he was left gulping in fresh air as they stood in front of high wrought-iron gates, which dissolved like smoke as they walked straight through them. Mrs Malfoy smiled at Harry and extricated her hand. “Welcome to Malfoy Manor. Draco, I need to write to the Ministry so that the magic I used in Privet Drive won't be blamed on Harry. Would you like to show him to his room? I thought he might like to use the Green Bedroom.”
“Oh, you survived,” came a glum voice. Harry looked up to see Myrtle staring at him mournfully. “I'd hoped you'd become a ghost and share my bathroom.”
Hedwig gave a happy trill, and stepped onto his proffered arm. He walked over to the open window. “And go to Pansy last, okay? I don't trust her not to open someone else's mail.” Hedwig nipped his finger affectionately and took off into the night. Harry watched her go, pleased that she'd recovered from being locked up for so long.
“You are indirectly responsible for a teacher's office being set on fire.”
Draco's gift turned out to be two books.
,” it eventually hissed back.
Ollie chuckled. “
“Are you trying to say that a schoolgirl worked it all out?” he asked sceptically.
Harry sighed. “When we had detention with Lockhart, I heard it just before he dismissed us. But no one else heard it, so Draco and Millicent assumed it must have been me imagining things.”
Tracey looked up with a little irritation. “She's in the dorm, why?”
“You're alive!” she squealed.
Theo looked up from the paper. “It doesn't say anything about your father having anything to do with Hagrid. He's just been interviewed as a school governor.”
“I'll do it!” Lockhart waved his wand at the snake. There was a loud bang as the snake shot a few metres into the air before falling back to the stage with a nasty sounding thud. It hissed angrily and raised its head to strike at a second year Hufflepuff Harry vaguely recognised.
All too soon the train pulled into King's Cross. The Weasleys said goodbye and ran off to their parents, and Neville walked over to his grandmother.
,” he sang quietly as he hung his new robes and matching cloak in the closet. They were a dark green, and one of his favourite new garments. “
“Okay. But what if your mum took us? She doesn't mind Hermione, right?”
Harry thought about all the times Draco had gotten mad recently. “No. He's been especially rude to Daphne lately.”
“Does saving Hermione from a tower full of Weasleys count as necessary?”
Harry looked around to find what appeared to be a ghost of a teenage boy standing over him.
They splashed through the puddle until the shadowy figure came into view. It was Mrs Norris, her stiff body hanging from a torch holder.
“Wizard prison, of course. It's horrible, out on this rock in the middle of the North Sea... I'd rather not talk about it. We're celebrating your freedom, not getting us both depressed. Here, open your presents.”
.” Harry looked at Snape out of the corner of his eye. “
Snape frowned. “Why did you not mention this earlier?”
“Well, like I said, I think he's jealous. This isn't the first time he's acted like this, is it?”
He trooped outside, and Dumbledore took a seat behind his desk. Harry stood there nervously; watching Fawkes had made him forget why he was there, but now all his anxiety was flooding back. Dumbledore pressed his fingers together as he watched him, and Harry had a ridiculous urge to laugh; he looked like Mr Burns from
“Isn't he the bloke who wrote almost the entire book list this year?” Harry asked, fishing said list out of his pocket.
Mrs Malfoy shrunk down his trunk and broomstick in silence, and handed them to Draco as she peered closer at the cupboard. Suddenly, she straightened up and closed the door. When Harry looked up at her, her face held none of its earlier warmth. She marched into the lounge, with both boys following, Draco's arm still around Harry. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia fell silent as Mrs Malfoy entered the room. Dudley was hiding unsuccessfully behind the arm of the couch.
“Three quarters of the school are glaring at us, I'd say that's pretty bad,” said Millicent.
“What? Why?” Draco asked.
“Dobby can't say, sir!” the elf repeated, before running to the wall and thumping his head on the stone.
“And you wanted me to help?” Harry asked.
“That... Makes sense.” Snape started walking back to his office. “Before this evening, had anyone else been aware you're a Parselmouth?"
“Yeah, Draco's been the same with me,” Harry laughed. He and Ginny grinned at each other as Draco and the twins looked at each other.
Mr Malfoy nodded at Harry, kissed his wife on the cheek and walked out.
“Sir? Are you saying –”
Harry picked up Hagrid's tin of fudge from the fireplace. “Now who's being paranoid?” he asked as he popped some fudge into his mouth. “Just face it: Hufflepuff has defences that we don't. And from what Neville's told me, Gryffindor's the same as Slytherin. Besides, you won the bet yesterday with Kettleburn.”
“Really? We still don't know what the monster is, or who the heir is, and apparently the only thing preventing Hagrid getting arrested is Dumbledore,” Draco said, his voice rising in irritation. “And I do not trust that man to look out for Hagrid's best interests.”
There was a moment of silence in the Chamber, as Harry stared at the basilisk and the remains of the diary. Then Snape started running towards him.
It was some time later that Mrs Malfoy declared they were done. Yet more shop assistants had appeared to take all of Harry's selections to the register while he was directed to pick out shoes and accessories.
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Honestly. Do you two really think anyone is going to look a thousand years into Draco's family tree? Face it, as far as the students here are concerned, you two are guilty simply for being Slytherins caught at the scene.”
“But I did it! I let the basilisk out. I should have fought back or something, but I just let him take over.”
Harry tried to sit up and failed. “Pomfrey, please, now!”
“Yes, well, all it means is that I can't help you,” Hermione said.
Harry snorted and stepped through the archway. “No she doesn't.”
“It's the Boy-Who-Lived!”
Theo laughed. “Don't worry, I wouldn't want to be Chaser anyway.”
“What?” Harry jumped and spilt ink on the letter in front of him.
If Harry had thought the Green Bedroom was large, that was only because he hadn't yet seen Draco's. Located next to Harry's, it was even bigger than their dormitory at Hogwarts. Harry stared in awe. There was a large four poster bed against one wall, covered with silvery-blue bedding and a mound of pillows. Like the Green Bedroom, there were two doors on the opposite wall, and two large bay windows looking out over the grounds. Bookshelves ran along one wall, and there were more shelves covered with toys and ornaments between the bathroom and closet doors. Harry grinned when he saw that the white crown Draco had taken from the chess match had pride of place. But what really grabbed his attention as he stepped onto the grey carpet was the wall behind Draco's bed.
“Thanks, Tilly,” Harry said as he gently took the letter off Hedwig's leg. “Could you please give her some bacon and then return her to the owlery?”
“And you decided the quickest way from the dungeons to the Great Hall was via the second floor?” McGonagall asked sceptically.
"Be that as it may, I'm sure you have grasped the implications of this evening's events,” Snape said.
“Oi! This is our table! Bugger off!”
Mrs Malfoy started going through the pile of clothes he'd been thinking of buying. “You have surprisingly good taste for your first time shopping. Though these won't do at all,” she threw a number of shirts and jumpers to one side. “The style is fine, but those colours won't suit you at all.”
“I don't know,” Draco huffed. “But I have a really bad feeling about all of this. I think I'll write to my father and try to make him change his mind about Hagrid. I doubt it'll work, but it can't make anything worse, right?”
“That's good. It can't be fun for Hermione, stuck in that tower. Imagine sharing a room with Patil and Brown.”
They walked the rest of the way in silence, before going to their own rooms.
, Headmaster, I know Harry, he wouldn't do that, not to anyone!”
“I never called him a genius,” came her grumpy reply.
He burst through the students and stopped when he saw Mrs Norris. His eyes popped wide open and he pointed at Harry and Draco. “You! You killed my cat! I'll kill you!
am the Potions master at this school,” Snape said venomously. Lockhart gulped slightly as Snape turned to Dumbledore. “If there's nothing further, I'd like to escort my students back to the dungeons.”
“That was one time, Mother,” Draco grumbled.

Harry forced a smile. “I understand.”
“Not when it overshadows what I got you, it isn't,” Draco said sulkily.
Harry's eyebrows shot up. “Wow. That's... Jesus, Draco. I'm glad it's you and not me. Sounds way too complicated.”
“Snape will win,” Vince said.
“No, it's not that. It's that people will find out that I
Beside Lockhart, Snape was looking at the new professor with an expression usually reserved for students who melted their cauldrons. Harry and Pansy were still giggling when McGonagall brought in the Sorting Hat. They eventually stopped when Reed glared down the table at them, and they watched the Sorting in silence. Harry found out that the boy who had stared at him at the train station was Colin Creevey. He seemed to be arguing with the hat, and was eventually put into Gryffindor. Harry breathed a sigh of relief, and the rest of the feast went by uneventfully.
, Mr Malfoy.”
Mrs Malfoy retreated to her study after dinner, and the boys to the lounge. Draco was reading a wizarding children's series that Harry had never heard of before, while Harry was methodically working his way through his snake encyclopaedia. It was slow going but completely engrossing, and he didn't hear Draco quietly get up and leave.
Harry spun around. “Are you kidding? It's brilliant!”
“Miss Narcissa is giving Dobby two Galleons a week, sir!” Dobby said.
Snape snorted and walked further into the room. “I simply thought you might want to help me brewing some potions for the infirmary. Madam Pomfrey informs me that her stock of Pepperup Potion is getting low, and flu season is upon us.”
,” he heard.
Everyone spun around to stare at Harry, Draco and Snape as they stood in the entranceway.
“What's that?”
Mrs Malfoy nodded thoughtfully. “Yes, I remember that painting. You should cultivate that friendship, Harry. The portraits at Hogwarts can be very helpful if you wish to learn more about the castle and its inhabitants.”
Hagrid glared at Draco. “No, he wasn't! He lives in the Forbidden Forest with his family.”
“I did. I couldn't continue to use the name of my filthy Muggle father, so I chose a name that I knew would strike terror into all who heard it.” Tom smiled. To Harry's confusion, he looked more solid than he had earlier. “From what Ginny and yourself have told me, I succeeded in that. Do you know, she couldn't bear to even write the name at first? Not you, though. Why is that?”
“Help me ask him then?” Pansy offered. “He's more likely to say yes to you than to me.”
What followed was one of the oddest meals Harry had ever experienced. Mrs Malfoy dominated the conversation, and several times she gave Harry the impression she was steering it away from certain topics. Mr Malfoy was talking about people at the Ministry Harry had never heard of, so he concentrated on his food, which was better than even the Hogwarts food. Draco was telling him about each dish that was served, most of which consisted of food Harry had never heard of before. He was fairly certain a lot of the dishes were French.
Draco settled in beside him and shook his head. “So how bad is it?”
“Come
The entire class looked at Daphne who was blushing happily in the first row. While she certainly wasn't dumb, she didn't usually come out with top marks. Pansy whispered something to her that made her hit Pansy on the shoulder. Lockhart wasn't looking however, as he was too busy lifting a covered cage onto his desk.
The girls looked around the hall. “Yikes,” said Daphne, and wriggled closer to Harry.
“Oh, right, sorry,” she pulled back and beamed at him, before hugging Draco. “And you! Where have you been? We were so worried about you!”
“Pansy! You can't do that!” Hermione admonished.
“He wanted to marry a Muggle?” Harry couldn't help but ask.
Draco frowned. “Maybe you're right, maybe it
“Or a signed picture?”
Dumbledore nodded. “Very well then. Mr Malfoy, I hereby award you one hundred points for the bravery and loyalty you have shown tonight. You and Professor Snape will both receive a Special Award for Services to the School, and – ah.”
Unfortunately for Harry, it was also the time that second years chose their elective subjects for the next year. Naturally, Hermione had spoken to every professor in the school, and was trying to figure out if she could take all the offered courses.
“You coming Draco?” he asked as they all stood up.
Snape looked at him intently. “I understand that you are unaccustomed to adults looking out for your welfare, but you are a Slytherin. Try not to act like a Gryffindor.”
Harry blushed and looked around for an escape route. The corridor was too crowded though: apart from his own class, the Gryffindors were making their way to Charms, and there was a line of first years watching wide-eyed.
” it asked.
There was a strange choking sound behind Harry, and he spun around to see an extremely old, extremely ill-looking bird sitting on a perch. Most of its feathers had fallen out, and Harry thought it was one of the ugliest things he'd seen in a while. It stared back at him before giving another coughing sound, and then it burst into flames.
Harry's wand went flying out of Tom's hand. Harry watched it soar over his head, where it was deftly caught by Snape.
They chatted about Stonehenge for a while. According to Draco, it was a source of powerful magic, but difficult to harness for most wizards.
in the air, then with a flick of his wrist, they rearranged themselves to read
The crying only got louder.
“Is this true, Harry?” Dumbledore asked.
Harry grabbed one, feeling a slight pang of guilt over abandoning his old broom so easily. Still, the new model was a better flier, and any advantage helped.
“I wouldn't have figured you for a grunge fan,” Hermione said as she selected a toffee.
Finally, Easter holidays arrived. More than a week in which to catch up on homework and sleep!
Snape gave him a doubtful look but let him go. When Harry didn't immediately topple over, he turned around and surveyed the dead basilisk. “
“They couldn't have done it, Minerva,” he said quietly. At Filch's angry sputtering he held up a hand and continued. “We will be able to cure her in time, Argus. Professor Sprout has some Mandrakes on hand. Once they're matured, they will be used to create a potion that can cure Mrs Norris.”
He cleared his throat. “How about we continue Draco's education in Muggle music?”
“Yeah. I set the basilisk loose on you. I'm really sorry, Hermione,” he said miserably.
“Not this one, no,” Harry said shortly.
On the fourteenth of February Harry and Draco came up for breakfast and stopped when they entered the Great Hall. Gone were the usual school decorations. Instead, an explosion of pink seemed to have taken place, from the flowers on the walls, to the heart-shaped confetti that was floating down to rest like pink snow over everyone.
The next morning Harry woke up and seriously considered staying in bed all day. When he and Draco had returned from Snape's office the night before, the entire common room had fallen silent at their entrance. Harry didn't like the looks they got from some of the older students, and they'd quickly retreated to their dorm. The other boys had been waiting for them, but had thankfully seemed to believe Draco's story about heading to the Astronomy Tower.
“Of course he likes me, I'm his best friend.”
Snape took his bag off his shoulder and levitated the diary onto McGonagall's desk. “By means of this diary. I am unsure how, but Riddle was draining Harry's life force and using it to become corporeal once more.”
He lurched forward with outstretched arms, when there came a shout.
“As if I'd miss out on this!” Pansy said brightly.
As they trudged down to Herbology, Harry glanced at Draco. “Not that I don't appreciate you standing up for me, but did you have to be so mean to her? You don't know she arranged that.”
