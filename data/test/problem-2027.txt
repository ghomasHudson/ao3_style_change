Everyone, sans Draco, stared at her. He had forgotten she had said that in the last timeline. That raised Draco's hopes a little. Maybe the timeline hadn't been changed too much. Maybe this was another fixed point. And if this one was, then that meant there would be more coming up. He would have to draw a chart comparing them. Anything familiar could be a fixed point, no matter how small it was. Someone falling down the stairs could win a war after all. That was how the universe worked.
"Does that mean you can read it? Can you read mine?" Harry asked from next to him.
He stretched on his chair and rubbed his eyes, trying to shoo the sleepiness away from him. But it just seemed to grow by the second. He didn't want Hermione to feel bad that he wasn't listening to what she was saying. He was sure she was saying something important, but he just couldn't seem to care.
"You should take a shower." Draco nodded to himself.
He cringed at her reaction.
"Ooh, Potter and his boyfriend?" someone drawled from behind them. Draco didn't have to turn back to know who it was.
She burst into the Headmaster's office and yelled, "Headmaster you can't expel Draco! It wasn't his fault! I can vouch for him--"
"Yes, they were found on what would become Azkaban island. On the island was a fortress where an insane man lived. The creator of the Dementors. The only human that the Dementors never tried to kill. He died, but no one knows how." Draco said. Harry was slowly inching closer to him, like a child that was being told an interesting bedtime story.
"Are you alright?" Harry asked, for what had to be the millionth time.
"Yes." Draco didn't have to think, he would finally figure out what had happened during first year and why Potter had gotten so many house points, it clearly had something to do with Quirell, but he didn't know what, he didn't know what the man was hiding, just that he wasn't who he seemed to be.
Hermione looked at him in confusion. "What?"
Draco didn't have to think about it, he forgave him. After all, Flitwick was Draco's favourite professor, and even Draco had thought he was going insane. The random surges of rage, as well as the blackouts, didn't help prove him wrong.
cold. Harry's vision began to blur as the prospect of Draco being dead began to sink in.
He missed Tom. He needed Tom again. He couldn't live without him.
He knew it, he knew Lupin was trouble. That was all werewolves were, good for nothing monsters--
Hermione sets her empty cup of tea on the table and surveys the stacks of magazines, tape, and boards labeled things like, 'Upstairs bedroom to the left' and 'Half bath to linen closet'.
I grab the carton of eggs and crack three into a skillet over a open flame. With a spatula I attempt to flip them after the edges have turned brown, but the bottoms are stuck. Pale yolk breaks and runs all over the pan.
A part of me purrs at Potter, my enemy, seeing a difference between my father and I, but the rest bristles in annoyance at the insult.
I laugh a bit too loud for what the rambling story deserved, but Harry's green eyes are fixed on me like I matter. He's so charming, subtly demanding attention in a way that's so magnetic. A warm tug in the belly, the urge for him to be yours. Or to be Harry's.
My head snaps up and I swallow my partly chewed bite which scraps my throat on the way down. I cough and take a drink of water before composing myself.
Draco bites his plump, pale pink lip, "I'm not sure I can accept. I've been avoiding Diagon and all things Wizard for my safety. And if won't be good for your shop’s reputation either, hiring an Ex-Death Eater."
Draco
Potter dishes out the food and I accept my plate from him, bringing a forkful to my mouth greedily, hunger winning over my manners.
"The door. I didn't think you were here!"
"Oh don't worry, I liked it, I mean- I like you- just...I really don't mind, alright? Luna, hold on!" She stops tugging with all her strength, obviously peeved I'm not in such a rush.
Remembering the family owned coffee shop, I quickly decided on the other job. It couldn't be that hard to strip beds, dust, and mop. There was no machinery involved so I should do well.
Light footsteps tread on the hard wood and Draco Malfoy appears.
Deciding honesty would be best, I say, "No, it's quite alright. I just overprepared as I tend to do. I just really want this job."
-----
Muffin flattens it's ears against it's skull, eyes flashing dangerously. Crossing my arms over my chest, I say, "I've fed you and given you shelter for weeks now and I really don't think you're very grateful."
My eyes sting with unshed tears, my heart beating at my ribs, hands shaking and nerves shredded. Needing a calm voice to sooth my leaping insides.
I lather my hair with a special shampoo that prevents my white hair from getting a sickly yellow tinge and exfoliate my face, mind wander to Grimmauld Place.
It tilts it’s head to the side and another bird flies down, this one a Snowy owl. It flares its wings at me and bobs it's head in a challenge.
Luna frowns, then blows a breath on the white snake who still doesn't react.
"I've...been avoiding the Wizarding world after everything and don't have Floo access where I'm staying. Harry's been the only one I've been in contact with for a while and that's only because of Tasha." I admit, color surely painting my cheeks at the confession. Luna's scrutiny is never a pleasant force to be subjected to.
"Hello, Matilda," Harry coos and takes the owls lifted foot with his forefinger and thumb, "I thought I scared you off, pretty girl."
I bite my lip to discover it's already scabbed over, I immediately stop it and pocket my nervous hands instead. "Uh, a Muggle job actually. I found it in a newspaper."
The cat/Kneazle is on my bed again, black fur surely coating my white sheets and fur coat.
Potter smiling was something I had only seen from a distance and he is so...such a bloody Gryffindor.
Hermione softens, her fingers uncurling from fists, "What's the snake doing here then?" She shrugs off her purple peacoat and plops down onto the couch beside me, reaching for the steaming tea cup.
Giggles overtake me as my mood soars, stumbling inside.
"Like what?" Luna asks, furrowing her light brows.
Hi! This second chapter came a lot earlier than I expected. I intended for it to be twice as long but I'm leaving the next part as it's own chapter because I'm juggling a few ideas around about what job Draco gets? I always liked reading fics with him as a barista in a coffee shop or maybe a waiter. But today I stopped by a pet store to look at fish (there was a bird there that told me 'you're pretty' then acted all bashful about it loll) and I can definitely see Draco getting a job at a magical pet store.
"Ah, so you're headed to the op'site side of town. You'll have to take a few buses to get there. Taking a cab would be faster but'll cost an arm and a leg. "
"What I was getting at, is that Tasha is a valuable animal and you'd be losing money by just giving her away. Why don't we...come to an agreement, yeah?"
"Harry, he's
I smile at his outraged face and laugh, "Better?"
"Hello, is this address correct?" I hold up the sheet of paper which one man takes.
the right place?"
I find an alleyway between shops and ignoring the stench radiating from large trash box's, I spread the map over the damp concrete, the shadows cast by the building almost black. The sound of machines rumbling down the road seems to multiply in the alley.
Morgan and Morgana no.
I hurry up to the door, wanting to hold Tasha, to curl up and let her gentle hissing calm me like she had done so many times in the past. Always at my side, distracting me from the screams echoing through the Manor, cheering my spirits and making me continue on. Calming like a rumbly voice and warm hands.
Potter hisses at Tasha in Parseltongue and I break into a secret smile.
(See the end of the chapter for
She also alluded to there being more room for
Also, thank you @Lapaula (Lapaula_River) -idk if that @ worked- for the formatting tip!
Potter shrugs his broad shoulders, "You're a Malfoy. Obviously not like your father, but you're still full of pride."
So Draco's going to receive a shock! He's naive. And Harry is realizing his growing feelings :) At least he's not in denial but he's in a tough situation.
I shake my head yes, blinking away the unwelcome pressure in my eyes. Charles looks down at me, clearly pissed off.
Draco finally calms Tasha down and sits in a comfortable chair instead of the other side of the couch. He doesn't look up from     Tasha's shining white scales holding him in a death grip.         "Thank you, Potter." He says softly.
is threatening to boil over and the aloo gobi isn't done yet. I grab the mitts and haul the first dish out, setting it on the opposite burner from where the naan bread sits with a stasis charm.
"Alright, I’ll get you food!" I exclaim to the owls with a laugh as the tree seems to wake up at the sound of my voice. I go back in and start preparing the owls breakfast, filled with more energy and excitement than I usually do while spending the morning at Luna's.
I turn and debate whether I should set the dinner at the kitchen bar or the dining room. The dining room was still untouched, dark wallpaper and table long enough to sit twenty. But this is Malfoy, he may think eating in the kitchen would be too informal.
I fall onto my back, hugging the pillow to my chest as a wave of drowsiness washes over me. My cock has mostly fallen and is exposed to the chilly air, so I drag a stray blanket over myself. The last thought in my mind before sleep overcomes me is of a Indian diner and Harry Potter.
Nothing has changed thankfully. I open the Muggle cold cupboard and scan my dismal options. Should I have...another egg? Maybe on toast? Or maybe hold one something frozen to my ankle? Was it the heat or cold that was beneficial to sprains?
The years long tension with Draco hadn't disappeared yet. He was obviously uncomfortable, from his polite manners to his ram rod straight back. The power balance was fucked.
Even with what I know of Indian cuisine, the menu is indecipherable. I order the day's special from a woman who looks like an Indian Mrs.Weasley, and the cheerful lady gleefully explains the menu. I am just as lost as Draco, who's nodding along, interested but dazed, and in the end agree to eat whatever she decides.
Professor Sprout was teaching them about Mandrakes, he absolutely hated the little buggers, they bit. She gave them earmuffs to wear when they pulled them out of their pots only to put them back in.
"Sorry, Dray, but we're both sworn to secrecy." They both put their hands over their hearts.
Dumbledore popped a lemon drop into his mouth. "I was against it, of course, but he kept on insisting and eventually said that if I didn't do it he would do it himself. I didn't want him to get hurt and so I agreed."
Harry Potter and his friends were coming back from the Nearly Headless Nick's death day celebration, it was weird, all the food was rotten and they didn't exactly have fun there, they were just there because they liked Nick.
"He said that he had a Master, I just didn't know that it was you." Harry tilted his head, looking oddly thoughtful.
"A new path shall be set for the equal, the prophesied shall meet a prodigy, born as the sixth month flourishes, two friends, once foes, shall carry the power to vanquish the one who has tainted their lives, one carries the power other's shall never know, nor shall they ever understand. So mote it be."
"I don't know what you saw in the mirror, Harry, but this mirror is called the mirror of Erised, it shows you your deepest desire, even if you don't know that you want it, it'll show it." Draco felt better now, his voice still wasn't back to normal, and he was still fighting the tears, but he felt better, and that was all that mattered.
He ran over to Draco even though his legs felt wobbly and were starting to go numb. Ron lay next to him, unconscious but not dead.
"Actually," Anthony put his quill down. Terry smirked knowingly in the background as Anthony avoided eye contact.
Draco headed towards his room, feeling Lucius' eyes on him.
"Could you at least try to take this seriously?" Draco hissed.
Dobby's eyes widened with fear, he looked at him and then at his hand, he resisted for so long that he started to shake, Draco knew he wouldn't resist for much longer, he just had to be patient. Dobby took something out of his sack, a
romance, Hermione." Harry rolled his eyes, seemingly mollified. Thank Merlin, it had taken him a good half hour to get that through his thick skull. But it had managed to take his mind off of Hogsmeade.
**************
Draco pushed through the crowd to see why they were there in the first place, and his heart sunk when he saw who was there.
"You should go see your friend," she said and got up, going back to the other teachers.
It took a while before a response came.
Draco stopped what he was doing, why would Potter want to call him by his first name? They weren't nearly that casual yet, it was a stretch to say that they were friends, but he supposed that he didn't see anything negative coming from that.
"This is our lesson for today. I will answer your questions in due time, but first, I want you to tell me if you can see anything around the flower." She put her hand right above the flower where the gas was coming out.
"Oh...you haven't heard?" Paulene paled, his voice lowering to a whisper as she tried not to cry.
Draco didn't know what to say, it wasn't like he could just say he was from the future, that would take a year and a half to explain, especially the magical theory of it.
"I don't understand, what does mudblood mean?" Harry asked throwing his arms out, Draco had clearly done something bad but he didn't know what it was, why was everyone so mad at him!
Draco threw the letter on his bed and collapsed onto it with a pounding headache, he could really use one of his visions right about now.
"Wow, Hermione, how're you gonna do that?" Ron said from across him. Draco had moved from the Ravenclaw table to Gryffindor to sit with them when the feast started.
" Anthony put his hand on his forehead and his eyes widened.
for breaking the international statue of secrecy!" Draco smacked Weasley across the head, and despite the circumstances, Harry snickered as Ron frantically jammed a silver button.
"Come on!" Draco yelled at Harry. He was dawdling behind talking to that Weasley girl. There was that same prickling feeling as the one at Diagon Alley. He didn't like it. The Weasley girl was blushing every time Harry said something and was standing far too close for it to be just casual. He wondered what they were talking about.
He wondered what actually happened and if it would happen again, he would have to keep an eye on that elf.
"Draco!" Harry's face beamed at seeing him, and Draco's anger momentarily disappeared at seeing his face, but he shook his head,
The writing was gone suddenly, where did it go-
Right, he should tell Tom that he was a time traveller.
"What! And you're just going to forgive Weasley? After everything he's said to you? I mean, I get Harry, he's a great person, but
He opened his eyes and saw a hunk of metal hurtling towards him at a terrifying speed, he tumbled out of the way as it came to a stop right in front of him.
"IT'S 10 PM?!"
"That was how he did it!" Draco yelled, Potter put a hand on his mouth, muffling Draco's speech. Oh, that absolute prat, if Draco could talk to his Potter, he would ring his neck.
"Here." She handed the flower to him. "I want you to keep this in your room. Learn to tell reality from your visions, and then we will have our next lesson. Do not tell anyone what it is. If anyone asks, it is an assignment from Professor Sprout. I have already contacted the headmaster about this so no one will question it."
"Master!" He cried, but Voldemort kept on telling him to get the stone, but he couldn't, he was melting, and there was nothing Voldemort could do about it.
There it was, Draco stopped for a moment and got ready to run into the entrance, Ron however, did not stop and kept on going forward.
But it wasn't over.
"Why, I can assure you that I have dealt with these kinds of things before. Come, let's talk to Professor Snape. I'm sure he has a potion for these kinds of things."
He briefly saw a impressed look cross the taller man's face, a rare look on him.
And it scared him. It scared him because he couldn't trust himself to come close to Hermione, Ron or Harry. He didn't want to hurt them, but at the same time,
"Does it have to do with your father?" Harry asked, he looked shy, but then again, he always looked shy.
"Seamus?" he asked.
Harry was, once again, shocked. And no small amount of confused. "Veela?"
***********
He glanced at her in disgust one more time before he started hissing.
That was when everyone pointedly looked at Harry, expressions mixed in the room. Professor McGonagall, seemingly catching on, scoffed again.
Harry chuckled and left the room.
He remembered the feeling of having his soul being forcibly removed from his body. It was just
"I think so? I just don't understand why. Is this just a prank? Do they just like the way I look?"
'Draco.'
"The real question is, are
"I know, Sir." Draco looked anywhere but at Flitwick.
"You're really glaring at that teacup, mate," Ron chirped from behind him.
"Ask away, my boy." Dumbledore smiled.
He rolled his eyes, did the Eagle really expect to beat him with such a simple riddle.
Draco opened his mouth and tears began to blur his vision, his voice came out in a whisper, "I'm just so tired Professor, I don't get visions anymore, my eye's blocked, the words came out, I knew what I was going to say, but I couldn't stop it, I was just so...angry." By the end of the sentence, he was in complete tears.
"Calm down class!" Draco was pulled out of his thoughts when Professor Lupin entered the classroom.
Flitwick squeaked and breathed, "Merlin, no."
He should it to Dumbledore-
"And who are you?" He looked up at one of the Weasley's.
He was called into Flitwick's office, he knew what it was about, he gulped as he sat down at the desk of a very disappointed looking Flitwick.
"Ugh, fine, but you owe me like 20 galleons for this!" Terry turned up his nose, crossing his arms.
As soon as they were out of the room Harry fell to the ground, muttering under his breath, "No, no, no." Tears sprung to his eyes, he wanted nothing more than to curl in on himself and cry.
A large man came bursting through the door and Harry jumped off, Draco caught him but so did the man, "Petunia, he's escaping!"
"Chocolate. Eat the whole thing." Lupin smiled but there was a hardness to his eyes, and he stood ramrod straight. He moved to give everyone else some chocolate as well, but Harry and Draco got the biggest portions.
Draco was happy.
"No! I'll come with you!" Draco fake-smiled. He still didn't know what he had said about Harry.
******************
"Didn't you say something else?" Draco asked, because now he was curious.
have a session with Flitwick soon, the man had been practically giddy to start teaching him, especially when Dumbledore had told the little man that he was presenting as a male Veela, apparently, Flitwick loved the magic behind Veela's, and Draco knew the man would be absolutely heartbroken if he didn't show up, he was starting to think he was his favorite student.
"Your family owns the house on Bellingham Place?" Terry's eyes widened.
"Clean it up," she ordered, and slammed the door.
Just a little mini
Harry looked confused but could tell that something was wrong, he looked at Ron and then back at Draco, he opened his mouth to say something but was stopped by Ron, he shook his head and they took off, following Hermione.
"Do you hear that?" Harry looked at Ron.
"Oh, yeah."
This wasn't Draco. But that was impossible, they had separated the Diary from Draco. He hadn't been writing in it, so
McGonagall was so stunned that she didn't even call out the next name until the Headmaster called out her name.
"House-elves," Draco muttered absentmindedly. His mind was still somewhere else.
Shit, he had forgotten that Centaur's were natural born Seer's, it was abnormal for them
"I could've used magic if anything happened--"
"Draco?" A voice called out, and Draco knew who it was before he saw them, Harry. Harry was standing there with Hermione and Ron, he would apologize to them later, once he found out what this was, he needed to get rid of it.
Suddenly, they both realized how close they were. Or, at least, Draco did. He didn't think Harry knew, it was either that or he didn't mind. For some reason, Draco's mind thought it was the latter. Harry opened his mouth to say something, his expression softening.
"You were given the gift." Firenze stated matter-of-factly. Harry was looking him again, but this time, he came closer and positioned himself in between Firenze and Draco.
"It'll be fun," Anthony goaded.
For some reason, Draco had been hanging out with Harry Potter, even Ronald Weasley, although most of those conversations ended with the redhead yelling bloody murder. They were with the two of them right now, she had been paired with Ronald for a Transfiguration project, and Draco had been paired with Potter.
She put out her hand.
He should
***************
"Hmm?" Severus hummed.
"Hey, Malfoy." Potter stopped him while he was heading to Charms.
"What?" He burst out.
"Did someone hurt you? Tell me their names and I'll beat their arses!" Terry squared up.
"Yeah, Hermione." Draco looked away, he wanted to talk to Tom again.
"No." He mumbled.
"I don't see what's so bad about this, she's in the bathroom, I'll apologize." Weasley said.
"Read this, tell me if you feel some of the symptoms in this." Draco looked down and cringed, it was a book full of disorders, the most prominent one was Multiple Personality Disorder, did he have it? No, he couldn't, he knew what he was going to say.
The four of them were in Draco's dorm, on a school night, as Hermione had put it, it was 'absolutely inappropriate' to be in anothers dorm on a schoolday, but she had to admit that she was excited to see the book, to see who Nicolas was, it had been eating at her.
Hermione, Ron and Harry didn't talk to him, he caught Harry giving him glances full of pity. He had tried to talk to them, but had ended up in a screaming match with Ron, or, at least, Ron was screaming.
"Draco." Severus greeted him with a slightly raised eyebrow.
"Good thing you're here. McGonagall told me you have to head over to your common room now." Finnigan said, completely ignoring what Draco had asked.
"They're definitely going to get together." Draco nodded. But it probably wouldn't happen until Sixth Year, and even then, there had been that awful relationship with Lavender Brown. He couldn't stand to see those public displays of affection. He could probably identify Weasley's tonsils by now.
He felt Snape's eyes on him as he left
It seemed he had made the mistake of letting someone listen in on their firecall. He really needed to start using Silencing charms.
That was it! He could blame it on Lucius, Hermione wouldn't question him about that, and neither would Harry or Weasley. He looked away and pursed his lips together, practically confirming what Harry had just said.
Draco sat down in the Gryffindor stands with Luna, Anthony and Terry. Luna and Terry were quite excited about this. Luna had covered her whole face in Gryffindor colours, while Terry was holding a sign that was charmed to yell 'Go Gryffindor!'
"The boy is a seer, Poppy, he just spoke a prophesy." Minerva said bluntly.
"Yeah, of course!" Harry smiled.
"You failed." The small hand wrapped around his ankle, and Draco’s first thought was that it was
"Dobby needs to protect Harry Potter!" Dobby spoke in a shaky but somehow confident voice.
************************
"A Dementor is a creature that sucks all the happiness out of you," Draco started. That got Harry's attention because he stopped taking apart his poor bed and looked at Draco. The red slowly fading away from his face as his eyes got a new glint in them. One Draco recognized all too well: curiosity.
faulty in this piece of junk!" As if to prove his point, the car sputtered once again.
Now, he needed to analyze the prophesy itself, he knew the cause of it, but what did it mean. Draco doubted he would find much information on it though, hidden meanings, yes, he could find those, but they would take almost all of his time. Prophecies always were the one thing that bugged him.
"There we go, now, all we need to do, is find the Hogwarts express." Ron was clearly nervous, given how breathy his voice was, and Draco was already doubting his plan.
"Come on, let's go lower, we need to find the train," Harry commanded Ron and he nodded as he lowered the car near the train tracks.
And there was the whole Veela thing. He had to talk to Professor Snape about potions. He couldn't brew them in his house without suspicion and he couldn't brew them in the potions lab for the same reason. He already knew Snape was giving Lupin Wolfsbane. When his Veela side fully matured on his fourteenth birthday, he would need a few sets of potions. Just a few to keep the Sleazes away.
Hermione sighed. "Do you ever do things the easy way, Ron?" She smiled.
"Hey, Malfoy, I had a question?" Draco turned to Potter.
The group of bullies looked stumped at that, it took a while before Davies seemed to come up with a comeback.
He turned around and made his way towards McGongall's desk, he could tell that she was analyzing him, for what, he didn't know.
"You heard about that?" He had talked to his father maybe an hour ago.
Draco sighed and reached out to Harry. "Promise me you'll never do that again."
Severus however, looked anything but amazed, he looked sad, and scared, a rare look on him, any emotion besides anger or disgust was rare on him, but fear was one that topped the list.
"Mr. Malfoy performed rather advanced spells for someone his age,
"Why wouldn't I? He's nice and treats me well, unlike some people." She didn't make eye contact with him.
"Hmm..." He drawled, ignoring his question yet again he looked at Draco, who was still in Harry's arms.
They all put their things in the back of the car and Ron took the driver's seat, much to Draco's dismay. Draco had to sit in the back with the owl, while Ron and Harry sat in the front, and before he knew it, they were taking off.
Everything would be fixed, they would live, and the others would die.
"That only makes me more intrigued as to why your boggart was the way it was."
Ron stopped and spun around, terror on his face, "Harry! I told you to bring it. How are we supposed to get past the
"Of course, Professor." Draco smiled.
It was at that moment that Harry decided to jump in.
Draco couldn't believe it. His father had tried to kill him. Sure, he was friends with Muggleborns and Blood-traitors and he knew that his father was going to be mad. But trying to kill him? His only heir?
He had explained it to her, how he too, faced prejudice based on his family. But it was different with him, people didn't pity him as they pitied her, they looked at him with hatred, how could you hate an 11-year-old boy?
"Father treats the elves horribly, but for some reason, he hates Dobby most of all. Probably because Dobby's not like most elves; he actually wants to be free." Draco shrugged.
Maybe he could have been a bit more subtle.
"I'll do it." Draco nodded, both to himself and to Harry.
Luna giggled, "You're my friend, Terry. Plus, you always flinch away from the Umgubular Slashkilter's." Luna said the last sentence as an afterthought.
"Well I still think--" Before Anthony could continue Draco slapped a hand over his mouth. "We're here!" He announced.
Wait.
"Really! What has gotten into you all today?" Professor McGonagall, to no one's surprise, had noticed.
"Yeah, no," Terry refused. "I'm not just going to blindly trust you with my education. Do you know what my parents will do to me if I get expelled?"
"Look closer, concentrate. Look beyond what you think you can see and focus on what you don't."
"Fine, you and I might get along, Malfoy, I'm Hermione Granger."
That goddamn bastard.
The word echoed inside the young Potter's mind, and he started to hyperventilate. Draco stopped, he no longer heard the sound of footsteps behind him, he looked around and saw the lamp that Harry was holding on the floor, he was breathing much too quickly, and Draco hated to admit that he was worried.
An unprecedented rage lit up inside him. He was just
They put their hands over their mouths and made a zipper motion over their lips.
"Well, you could just ask his mother. You know most courtships end in marriage. You're basically getting their blessing."
"We can't be far behind." Ron shrugged, and Draco flinched as he heard a whistle,
"Of all the stupid things you've done, Potter, this takes the cake.  You ran away from home when you know how dangerous it is. And at night, no less! Do you know how embarrassing it would be to find that the-boy-who-lived died in a stupid muggle car accident!?"
Harry's train of thought - or lack thereof - crashed and burned at the simple prospect of marrying Draco. Draco Malfoy, his husband. Making goddamn vows? Buying a little house? He wasn't a hopeless romantic by any means - no matter what Ron said - but all that sounded really,
"Are you alright there, mate?" Ron questioned through his mouth full of food.
"Awesome!" Terry cheered next to him.
"Yes!" And he slapped his mouth, looking back at them.
between her only son and a
Dumbledore blinked, for a moment looking uncharacteristically surprised before slowly melting into grim realization. If there wasn't enough proof before, Dumbledore's expression was all he needed to confirm the harsh truth.
"Are you okay?" Harry asked.
The basilisk slithered close once more preparing to leap towards him. Harry closed his eyes and prepared himself.
Hermione have him a look that clearly said 'we'll speak later.' Harry gave him a smile and a thumbs up, Weasley just waved goodbye (an improvement from when he just pretended that Draco didn't exist), it was good to know that he was getting over their family's blood feud.
Draco
Dean's eyes grew large, "Seriously? He dropped off the face of the earth after Malfoy Manner was confiscated. Is he under house arrest as well?"
I set it aside on the bed and stare at the glaring snake upon my arm, physical proof of my unworthiness. The ink still moves within my skin, wavering and glaring back at me with buried memories like ice water soaking my clothes.
It's impossible to miss our white hair and pale eyes.
"Can't we talk about this? Come in and I'll put the kettle on."
I'm not against gays. Dean and Seamus are gay. Or, well, Dean is bisexual and Seamus is gay.
I wonder what my name would sound like, a soft 'Harry' falling from those pale lips.
nag."
"A while ago. There are so many creatures here..." I trail off as a large eagle owl, just like the one I had my first years at Hogwarts, took flight from the tree. The bird was massive with a wingspan that looked to be as wide as my own arm span.
My hair is sticking straight up in the back and flicking out in bizarre curls over my ears, I have a strange dirt streak across my nose, and my clothes look as if I've battled a Hippogriff. Which, thankfully, I have not encountered yet at Luna's.
The bag was magical so it did make some sense. I give a consenting nod, my brain leaping ahead to apartments and down payments as I take the money.
"Nobody will even care if you trip up. You could do any number of horrible acts and you'd still be the Savior."
Luna got her rare magical creatures license and opened her shop only a few weeks after the war before the Ministry had even settled.
I close the front door of Grimmauld Place and search for the faint strands of the houses magic, pushing my will out I lean heavily on my blood magic. The door bolts shut with a solid
The front door appears perfectly fine and when I reach out with my magic I feel no-one trespassing. I feel nothing but an agitated buzz.
Harry to talking to Luna still and to my delight, he has Tasha with him, curiously slithering over the counter and scenting the air.
after all.
"I opened up a magical creature shop in Diagon. You have experience already with Tasha so I would be happy to hire you to help take care of the animals."
. I try to fit a second finger in to fast, stopping my grinding with a wince.
I shake my head hard, my loose hair- I ran out of pomade last week- falling across my forehead. He doesn't understand.
I should probably send an owl to say I’m coming later.
It flicks its tail sharply, turning green eyes to look at me as it flattens it's ears.
"Draco!" Luna Lovegood calls excitedly from the front desk and I freeze where I stand.
The only people that still seem real are my Gryffindor friends from before the war and a small spattering of people like McGonagall or Luna. Everyone else focuses on my name and it's not like I can date my friends, who I view as family.
I stare at him in confusion, "I...I don't think we serve that?"
He crosses his arms, "Do it, I dare you. I'll sick up on purpose."
I sigh and reach a hand out to scrub the animals neck, "You really need a name, you unfortunate creature."
I stare at the snake, confused and trying to figure out what she's talking about.
Hermione takes the serving spoon and starts dishing out the food, "I saw Blaise at the Ministry today. I was picking up papers from the seventh subfloor for the Mermaid case and apparently, he's been filing there since the Ministry rebuild started. He was very pleasant."
I need something to calm my nerves: a butterbeer, fire whiskey, Muggle drinks, just anything will do.
"Shut up, idiot, you know nothing."
I find myself holding it carefully, slightly shaken that an amount that used to mean so little to me now means food and shelter. A measly 500 gallons can change my life.
"I'm glad you're getting along, I don't like it when my friends fight. You know, Harry and I are going out in a minute. Perhaps you could join?" She says with a genuine smile, but I’m too caught up on the idea that hit me like a Stupefy.
I bury a wild smile and nod, "That is a good idea. I don't imagine Luna sells very many of the rarer creatures."
I press my fingertip to the glass and it hits the glass with one of its reptilian feet in return, turning its head fully to the side to see me better, it's eye shining with intelligence.
"Harry and I said nothing would happen to you so you can take off that robe. It'd be easier to work with the animals without it anyhow." She says, crossing her arms over her bright yellow blouse.
My vision blacks out, tension exploding into relief as my hand struggles to keep up and I’m unaware of anything but the pleasure flooding my body.
I smile at Harry, "I would like some, thank you."
? I would rather just Apparate, thanks.
As settled as my life has become over the months, I can't imagine having a child as many others are. And I do want children, enough to fill a house the size of Grimmauld and a table the size of the Weasley’s. I'm just not in a mad rush like some.
I giggle some more, halfway aware I sound like a drunk idiot but the heat gathering in my bits wipes those thoughts away. I crawl fully onto the bed and struggle out of my pants, spitting into my hand before touching the wet head of my cock. I whine but force myself to go slow and light and I wonder how Harry does it.
Potter is standing underneath the tree, a small brown bird perched on his head, scattering food from a large bucket. Owls of all sorts swoop down and get their fill of the feed, predatory owls chasing mice that scramble to the tree roots.
A strong wind hits me and my hair plasters itself to the side of my face and eyes. I scrape the annoying strands away and bright yellow light floods my vision.
My left palm is an angry red and I curse myself aloud for not taking a healing class at Hogwarts.
"Don't you have a house elf?" I can't help the pointed remark, like a knee jerk reaction.
"You don't seem alright. I haven't seen you since the Manor and now I see you here at Harry's."
seven hours to sort the kitchen out and actually cook the complicated meal.
I scrub my hands down my face and allow my arms to flop down so I'm eagle spread on my king size bed. I wanted a queen but Hermione thought it was ridiculous to have a queen in the master bedroom.
I take sigh deeply, shoving all my Draco related thoughts from my head before Flooing over to the station Ron and Hermione use, occasionally passing someone on the windy street, cold biting at my cheeks. At their apartment I push the button to call them and Hermione picks up,
The Kneazle is still here, laid on my pillows despite my many efforts to shoo it off. It hissed and bit at me every time I tried to pick it up to physically move it out the door. Finally, I was forced to put down a bowl of water and some overdone eggs, which it didn't touch of course. A large glass baking dish is in the corner of the room, spelled full of liter in case it needs to go.
Draco.
The Ravenclaws knew about Draco's predicament. Hermione had told them. There was no point in keeping secrets from them.
The voice said, this time much harsher.
"Yeah, how's it been with Potter?" Anthony chimed in.
"There's no point in childish feuds when you have the chance to fix it, why be petty just for the sake of being petty."
"But then why were you crying?" Another question, and another fake answer.
"Bully?-"
Draco tried to be angry at that. Draco still thought they were friends…
He hit the wall and all his luggage went flying, all the muggles surrounding the station looked towards them, and one of the ticket-takers started walking over to them, "Sorry sir, lost control of the trolley." Draco sent him away with a sheepish smile.
"You're a genius," he whispered, the dopey smile back on his face.
"I'm sorry for yelling. I know you were just doing it because you care," Terry grinned.
"Are you talking to Terry about his family?"
"Wow, Draco, you have to tell us what you saw Potter doing!" Anthony exclaimed, jumping onto his bed. Why was Luna in the boy's dorm?
"We. Are. Going. To. Save. Him." Ron poked Harry in the chest between ever word.
"You and that bloody pigeon aren't going anywhere!" Did he just call an owl a pigeon?
"Alright," Harry said. "Don't take too long."
are unable to change them, people do not need to know for you to help them, but keep in mind, if you did not speak it out loud, then they are not meant to know."
"Once foes?" Poppy questioned.
"I know, I was shocked too. But it worked." The whole guilt complex thing had been a huge gamble, but it was the plan with the least risk. And it wouldn't damage his already precarious relationship with his father. In Draco's mind, the plan had seemed foolish. To his surprise, it had actually worked.
Draco still wanted to be friends--
That was quite an argument, Narcissa and Lucius had broken into a screaming match right there, Draco had left, not wanting to hear it, all he knew was that it was Potter's fault somehow.
Draco put it in his bag.
Draco didn't know why, but he had to find something in his trunk, his mind was nagging at him to get something from his trunk. Once he was sure no one could see him, he ripped open his trunk, he didn't know what he was looking for, but he knew that he
And then darkness.
"Draco Malfoy." He answered, and Arthur's eyes dimmed a bit, his smile faltering at the prospect of having a Malfoy in his home, Draco knew he should be offended, but he didn't mind much really.
Narcissa cleared her throat and called out, "Dobby!"
He didn't know if Draco was dead, Tom had never told him. He grabbed Draco by his shoulders and began to shake him, "Draco." He chocked out.
"Paulene is fine."
"You... want me to?" It came out as a question, only because Draco was so confused.
soft.
"Something you want to tell me?" He asked when he noticed the shifty eyes and obvious layer of sweat on the boy in front of him. It was a look he recognized, a look he had seen on Father when faced with an angry Mother. A look he had seen an immeasurable amount of times this summer.
"I need to ask,
The twinkle in Dumbledore's eyes practically blinded him. "The bonds between family are great, Draco. Even when they are not bound by blood." His eyes grew distant, as if reliving something, and, for once, Draco found himself wondering about Dumbledore's past.
Potter looked horrified, he must have figured it out. He wasn't completely lying, Lucius did get out of hand sometimes, especially when he was drunk or after an encounter with Arthur Weasley, little Draco did have a few scars from them. But he really got out of hand once the Dark Lord came back, he basically went insane.
by his first name? Calling Granger anything but Granger was a struggle for him, but Potter? He looked back at him and saw him giving Draco one of his looks, he looked like he would cry if Draco refused, and Draco wasn't a
Looking at his ceiling, he reflected on what had happened. His emotions were...
"You've been sorted into Ravenclaw," Lucius spoke once he had finished his dinner. Draco had been expecting him to bring it up sooner, but he had waited a whole week before bringing up his sorting.
"Could you stop with the bowing?" Potter rubbed his neck, his cheeks were a bit red.
Harry didn't say anything after that, but his eyebrows were furrowed. He was
"Divination is one of the most imprecise branches of magic. I shall not conceal from you that I have very little patience with it. True Seers are very rare. And Professor Trelawney..." she trailed off once more and Draco felt another swell of indignation. It was true that Divination had never been a branch of magic that had gathered much favor. But it was only because so many people were offended when they realized they would never be able to learn a specific branch of magic that they'd rather make fun of anyone who could!
"Well, if you continue being a prodigy, I will also tutor you privately, there is a lot of potential in you Mr. Malfoy." McGonagall smiled slightly.
Nott himself looked livid as he glared directly at Draco. Draco winced. He had definitely heard about Lucius. That wouldn't be good when Draco would have to talk him out of being a Death Eater. Then again, Nott knew the consequences of his actions. There was no way to truly win here.
"Harry!" someone yelled. It was Ron.
"I cannot believe you, I would have thought you to be the responsible one. The damage that you inflicted on a whooping willow that has been on these grounds since
They were spat out of a fireplace in Borgin and Burkes. Draco turned to Harry, eyes flaming,
He actually looked surprised.
"It had to be a Gryffindor, no one else would be able to come into Hermione's room," Ron shrugged.
"What?"
"Now," Professor Lupin started, "Can anyone tell me what they think is in this closet?" He pointed at a worn old wardrobe that kept on making odd noises and bouncing slightly in place.
"Then young master cannot protect Harry Potter!" Dobby apparated away.
"Stop struggling!" Hermione yelled at all of them, even though Draco was moving the least out of all of them.
"No, Sir!"
"I still have my own free will, I am human, I am capable of being a different person with different values than Lucius Malfoy, or are you an exact copy of your parents? Have you never done something that your parents dissaproved of, surely they didn't approve of that. Does it not speak for itself that I was sorted into Ravenclaw, or do you want to insult your own house, Davies?"
"Sure." He smiled at her and they started walking, Draco put the diary in his bag and ignored the urge to write in it, he would have plenty of time during his free period.
The writing came back faster this time.
"And to Draco Malfoy, of Ravenclaw house, I award, 50 points, for intellect." Dumbledore winked at him, and Draco's jaw fell open,
"Draco...I don't know if it is the universe punishing you. Perhaps it is something else, but that is the only thing
A loud hiss was heard from the depths of the water that was in front of them. The head of what was most likely the basilisk drifted out of the water. Harry closed his eyes immediately.
"Pureblood." Draco tilted his head and Nott laughed.
Snape looked at him, he was mad, but he didn't deny it because he knew that it was true, and so did everyone else in the room.
"Remember dear, speak
"Hermione?" Ron asked again.
Getting up, he nodded at McGongall, which she returned, at least he didn't bow this time.
Draco hadn't noticed, but he had opened the diary and was now writing in it. It was just one word.
Draco nodded and opened his mouth to say something about his father when Ron suddenly broke into a round of uncontrollable laughter.
It wasn't supposed to happen again, what had he done wrong? Was this another fixed point, did it have to happen?
"Correct, Mr. Malfoy, 10 points to Sl- Ravenclaw." He noticed that slip up, some of the teachers also did it, they really did expect him to be a Slytherin.
"Snape?" Draco raised an eyebrow, had they already jumped to that conclusion, Draco thought that they were thinking about what he had said.
Harry and Lucius glared at each other for a minute before finally following the Headmaster's orders. Lucius was quick to leave while his elf lingered behind. Harry, who had taken to notice of the elf until he stared directly into Harry's eyes was understandably shocked at seeing him.
"Are you crazy?" Ron yelled at her. But Hermione was right, there was no way to get out of here, even a full-grown wizard wouldn't be able to get through this with their wand, the only reasonable thing to do was stay still.
"My family managed to get out safely but... I'll never forget that day..." Draco watched in horror as Paulene began to break into silent sobs.
It had taken Draco an embarrassingly long time to figure it out. Nonetheless, he had connected the dots. Many Death Eaters were aware of exactly who Peter Pettigrew was: a Gryffindor coward. But more importantly, he was an Animagus. A rat one. Fitting for someone like him.
"My goodness, Mr. Boot! What has gotten into you?" The Professor tugged her sleeve back.
Right when he was about to knock on the door, Flitwick opened it, and Draco started at seeing how happy the man was, yes, it was normal to see the man in his usual happy mood, he had never seen the man this happy and excited.
Harry winced and looked around, "Wow, none of the glass broke." He muttered under his breath.
"Check." The Weasley boy breathed out, looking at Harry, Hermione was looking at him as well, Merlin why were they both scared, it wasn't like it sliced him in half.
"Who?" Professor Sprout asked hesitantly.
"So, tell me." Draco nudged her.
was growing near. He jumped into the water that was next to him and climbed onto the statue of Salazar Slytherin.
Maybe Draco was dead? The thought turned his blood cold. Draco was his best friend. Even more so than Ron. Ron had Hermione and Harry had Draco. Sure; Hermione and Draco liked to poke fun at Harry and Ron. But in the end, Harry and Draco were always best friends. If Draco was dead, then Harry would never be able to tell Draco how he felt about him. How he saw them as more then friends.
It was so sudden that he dropped his lamp. Death, an aura of death was coming closer, no, they were coming closer to him, why was he walking, he didn't want to walk that way, he wanted to run away,
"You, boy!" she said suddenly, hand pointing towards Neville, who cowered beneath her gaze. Just then, a flash of Neville dropping a teacup appeared in his vision, hazy and far away. As though blocked by a cloud of invisible mist.
he think of throwing it away.
if he'll let me
"I'm just so tired, Harry." Draco's voice sounded wobbly. He was fighting to keep the tears at bay. He had cried enough; he wouldn't anymore.
"Divination isn't a subject that you can learn from books, Professor. While Seers are extremely rare, it's more common for people to be in touch with their Inner Eye." Draco spoke up in the calmest voice he could manage. McGonagall's eyes widened just a fraction and she looked over to him.
, it whispered.
Draco smiled. "My sass is rubbing off on you."
!" He slammed his hands on the table and Hermione finally realized how angry he truly was.
"Harry James Potter, you listen to me
like that.
Trelawney gave him a small smile. "There is much we must talk of, child," she said softly. Then again, everything she said sounded soft. He wondered if she was capable of yelling.
He swallows, Adam’s apple bobbing up and down his richly tanned throat, then flashes a wide grin, "Just thought you'd want to know since you can't taste anything."
Draco
I end up buying both a tube and a bus pass despite my hesitancy towards the bus. You hear all sorts of stories about the Wizarding Night Bus; I was nervous about what I might encounter and the safety of a Muggle run bus. The great lumbering machines looked docile going down the road and the people waiting on benches and exiting the machines looked calm enough.
"I'm pretty sure Malfoy is gay, Harry. Just to get that out there."
Tasha rises up from her jersey-bed and cocks her head sideways like a dog, "
I shake my head, pushing my now unappetizing chips away, "He just got a new apartment and I saw him for a bit earlier. He's not the same Malfoy we knew."
"I'm drunk, Potter, I find everything funny." I lie smoothly and stealthily feel of his chest and arms.
I rush back down the stairs and into the rearranged kitchen, the product of many hours of hard work and two gallons of bleach to sanitize it all.
The food runs out and Butterbeer is passed around, and despite how nice it is being around them, just the three of us, I leave with a feeling of incompleteness and Draco taking up all of my thoughts.
"Draco?" Potter exclaims, stupid eyebrows raising over his stupid glasses and into his stupid hair. He raises a tanned hand to Tasha for her to smell and I want to smack it away out of pure pettiness. I don't. I glare at the ground and grit out again, "Take her."
SEVEN
"Alright! Fine. I'll see you tomorrow, Draco?"
Also, there's the chance of Apparating in a non-secluded spot since I don't know the area.
"Oh I do like cats, I'm just not fond of this particular one. She's always sleeping and wants nothing to do with me."
"A cat?" My nose wrinkles. I should have thought of it before. Both cats and dogs are non-magical versions of Kneazles and Crups, they can't do half as many things as magical animal can.
"Fine then. 100 galleons a week, 400 a month. Her species is even rarer than I thought and Father got her as payment for a favor so I was unaware of the exact price."
My trousers a puddle on the floor, I shiver and stick my hand into the water to test the temperature. With a groan, I wait another minute before the water has had enough time to wake up, freezing my cock off in the drafty room.
Luna's is everything I had dreamed about and more.
It's Thursday- Tasha Day. Potter invited me to Grimmauld this morning and I hadn't given myself enough time to over think anything.
Distracted, I shrug on the brown leather coat thrown over the couch arm and grab a pinch of floo powder from the bowl.
"Harry, as nice as it is to see Draco, perhaps we can talk for longer tomorrow? He understands why, I'm sure, and Portkeys to Israel don't come by a
Completely unrelated to this fic, but I caught a bird today! It was hopping around in the Texas snow and couldn't fly away when I approached it so I scooped it up. I still can't see anything visibly wrong with it so I'm keeping it until the snow melts. There are no wildlife rescues near me and even if there was I wouldn't trust them not to just dump it outside as it's a common bird (Brown Thrasher. I researched.) Anyway it's sleeping with it's head tucked in its wing rn in a plastic tub in my room. I think this is a really great experience as I've been wanting to get a budgie for a while now and started saving up money. Hopefully Thrasher recovers and I can release it back into the open air!
Potter must see me looking because he says sheepishly, "I haven't gotten to the kitchen yet, it's still in the planning stages of remodeling."
"Oh, yes. It should only be a few minutes more. Where are you in a rush to get?"
"You're not a giggly drunk from what I can tell. You've been insulting me all night."
I wonder if Potter set Tasha's terrarium up, if he bought her a new day lamp. They're probably getting along just jolly, Tasha not knowing when to shut her gob when it comes to Potter.
I shrug and flip through a home design magazine, looking at tile floor designs for the master bath.
"Draco, wait. What happened to you?"
Charles runs through machines, cups, and steps before I can process what just happened. The order of buttons- even the type of Muggle drink being made- flies over my head and out of reach like a cursed snitch. Overwhelmed, panic wells inside of me as I try to memorize this strange dance of machinery and caffeine.
I hold no hatred, I don't believe I ever truly did, but the thought of Wizards and Muggles mixing? The Muggles were just so...loud. And overwhelming and so, so many of them. They would overpower Wizards despite all our magic. It is not Wizard business to meddle with Muggles.
Draco looks to me and I shake my head.
An idea hits be like a stinging hex and I jog my brain for spells before settling on
!" I laugh, reaching under the blanket, I find a section of her body and haul her out. She happily winds herself around my neck and sticks her tapered snout into my ear.
Draco helped Harry get up and faltered a bit when he saw how Harry was glaring at him, he opened his mouth, ready to say something, but Draco shushed him, fighting fire with fire would do no one any good.
He broke into the bathroom in an instant, he could hear Potter and Weasley coming inside as well.
"No, it's actually for me," Draco answered, the admission feeling somewhat unreal. He still couldn't understand why someone would give him a rose if it wasn't just for his looks. Was that it? Someone just liked the way he looked and had a decent knowledge of flowers?
"I tried," Harry said as they walked out of the store, they were in Knockturn Alley, as twelve-year-olds, amazing.
to ruin it.
Dumbledore had made a speech about the Dementors and the twinkle in his eyes had been completely gone. It was the first time he had ever seen the Headmaster look mad. The man always looked composed and all-knowing. At the mention of Sirius Black, all eyes had turned to Harry, who looked confused.
Ron stopped for a moment before saying the two words that summed up how they were both feeling. "Bloody hell."
He cared. And that thought alone made Draco feel warm inside. It was nice to have someone that he could call a father figure. This time, he wouldn't have to live up to anyone's expectations. Severus cared about Draco for Draco.
Draco faltered for a moment, knowing his entire existence was a lie. The guilt was resurfacing, and he knew that he would have to tell them soon. But he would have to make sure it was safe to tell them. They were only children right now. They wouldn't understand, not for a while at least. Potter, Granger and Weasley may be extraordinary kids, but that was what they were. Kids.
Months passed, and Draco didn't hear much of the Quirrel/Snape story, he had tried inquiring about it, but he was blown off by Weasley, and he had to admit that it hurt, but he didn't let it get to him, he knew that if things got too bad or they couldn't figure something out, they would come to him, or at least, he hoped so.
************************************
clearly." Harry nodded and took a handful of floo powder, Draco silently thought that it was pretty impossible to mess up saying Diagon Alley correctly, who could mess up such a simple-
Entering his dorm, he dumped all his books and materials on his bed, the others that were in the room didn't pay him much mind, they were all too absorbed in what they were doing. A nice change to all the nosy Slytherin's.
"Give me the Weasley twins’ business card," he demanded.
Trelawney walked away from the now clean floor and walked over to Draco and Harry, checking teacups along the way. Draco prepared himself for what he knew was going to happen. Sure enough, as soon as Trelawney took a look into Harry's cup, she gasped, her hand coming up to her mouth as her eyes filled to the brim with tears. Abruptly, the class stopped what they were doing, looking at the both of them in interest. Suddenly, Draco realized why Harry didn't like all the attention.
Draco snickered when Lockhart fell on his arse after Professor Snape used
"I can't move!" Ron yelled, struggling against the plant. A closer look at it and Draco knew exactly what it was,
And in the most cunning of Slytherins.
"Professor Snape," Draco nodded back.
The covers were yanked off of him, and he was hit by a rush of cold air, he was awake now. Looking over at the person who had so rudely woken him up, he was ready to chew them out, ready to make a scene,
"Sorry, mate." He whispered, and before Harry could say anything, he pushed him into Quirrel.
"Let go of him you insipid Muggle!" Draco yelled.
"No, I'm eleven and don't have a magical guardian that I can go to, or at least, I don't have one that would believe me." That part was true.
"I'll figure something out," she said vaguely, purposefully not making eye contact.
He was relieved when he woke up in a sunlit cozy room, the Headmaster's office.
"Could you come with us?" Harry looked at him.
"I know," Draco said haughtily.
"Why am I here?" He voiced his question.
The twins started snickering and winked at Ron for some reason, who winked back. Draco groaned; this was turning out to be quite a day; to think that just moments ago he was laying down in the soft grass, contemplating his existence, but the Weasley's just
"Look!" Potter took off the cloak and grabbed Draco's arm harder, pushing him towards what looked like a mirror.
Draco knew he shouldn't tell inanimate objects about himself, but what would it do, tell someone? That was impossible, no one would get their hands on the book as long as Draco kept it on himself at all times, and having something or
"Is Dobby that elf that tried to kill you with the Bludger?" Ron asked.
Hermione sat on a chair at Hagrid's crying her eyes out, Hagrid handed her a tissue and she blew into it, a disgusting sound coming from it.
"I know, Sir." Draco's voice grew smaller.
"I know how shit your relatives are. If you need to run away again, you're coming to my house. I'll give you a portkey at the end of the year." They were normally regulated by the Ministry but he could pull some strings.
Oh god why did he have to act on impulse.
Gilderoy. Fucking. Lockhart.
"Excellent, Ravenclaw is just full of sharp and clever minds, isn't it. Another ten points to Ravenclaw."
"Have your parents given you the talk, Mr. Boot? Oh, Severus, why doesn't Hogwarts include a course like that? We should talk to Dumbledore about it!"
"I-" He didn't have any words, he didn't know what to say.
"Professor!" Hermione yelled.
"Stand back, Potter! I'll get rid of it." Snape strolled towards the snake but stopped when he heard Harry talking. But that was the strange part; Harry was just talking. He didn't know why everyone seemed so confused.
Draco found himself leaning closer to them.
"Draco?" she asked, narrowing her eyes.
He shuddred, no, get that thought out of here.
Draco nodded, his previous anger towards Potter had dissipated somewhat, he knew he was being irrational, but it was normal for him to just blame Potter for things. But this wasn't Potter, it was Harry, and blaming Harry for things wasn't right.
The Griffin started to spin around slowly, revealing a spiral staircase.
When they didn't get an answer, Harry opened the stall door only to find Hermione facing the wall, crying silently.
"Yes," she agreed in a small voice, but in the silence of the room, it rang out clearly.
Her eyes narrowed. It was the book. The book that she had found in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom.
