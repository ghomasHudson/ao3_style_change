“There are one or two things I thought you might like to see,” Draco says, waving a dismissive hand and placing the parcel in Harry’s lap. “Open it, then.”
When he takes off in the direction of the stream, Luna gets up and follows him. She thinks she might like a little break from all the noise and heat and movement. It isn’t as though she isn’t having a wonderful time, but the dark, cool stillness of her favourite spot calls out to her like a siren song and she doesn’t even try to resist. She won’t be missed for a minute or two.
The sun is high in the sky by the time the last goat is safely inside the barn and Draco takes down his spell. Despite the effectiveness of his newly-discovered talent, persuading sixteen wilful highland goats to leave their beautiful grassy valley for a stuffy little barn is a tough task, and scrambling back and forth over the hilly pastures of William’s farm is nothing short of exhausting. The sun is blazing down as they sprawl in the grass beside the barn, breathing hard and sticky with sweat. Harry’s woollen jumper and tweed trousers are rough against his hot skin and his wellingtons are chafing despite his best efforts at charming them to the right size. He smells of goats and mud and dried shit and he really, really doesn’t want to be a farmer.
“Right,” Harry says, half relieved and half amused to picture what Draco has actually been doing in his absence. “The thing is, ‘Needle the swan’ sounds like a suggestion that would end in someone losing an eye.”
“They might be lost,” Caroline says knowledgably, smoothing down her pyjama shirt so that the tiny Sorting Hats are displayed to best advantage.
The girl turns bright blue eyes on her and sighs. “Lori wrote to me,” she says, holding up the letter.
Right now, as Draco swings the wheel and plunges them into a huge, frost-glittery meadow, just because he feels like it, Harry has absolutely no idea where he stands, and he’s terrified. When Juno appears from nowhere and leaps onto his lap, he startles and swears under his breath. When he looks at Draco, he is smiling and luminous in the pale sunlight and Harry wants to put a stinging hex up his shirt.
Harry picks up his pace and holds on tightly to his bunch of carrots, feeling relieved when Draco catches up to him and they run together, bumping elbows and breathing hard. When they reach the quill shop, he turns to see that the officer isn’t far behind and is being followed, or perhaps chased, by an excitable Needle. Oddly exhilarated to have reached the scene so quickly after the crime, Harry pushes the door open and stops.
Harry smiles at her gratefully and then shrugs. “Could have been worse, I suppose. Could have been the middle of summer, then you’d have all had a shock.”
“Well, is it just goats?” Harry asks. He knows he is wasting valuable time, but he is far too curious to care. “Can you do other animal noises?”
He is rewarded by the glorious earthy scent of baked potatoes and the sight of Hermione grating cheese into a large ceramic bowl. Delighted, he throws his coat over a chair and starts rummaging in a nearby cupboard for mugs.
“Magic or no magic, I need the table cleared,” Molly announces. “Ginny, get the knives and forks, please. Percy, I asked you to sort out the plates, why are you lurking about on the stairs?”
“I’m a glutton for punishment,” he admits, pretending not to notice Patrick, who is attempting to hide from him behind a coat stand.
Harry glances at Draco and immediately wishes he hadn’t, because the bugger couldn’t look any more pleased with himself if he tried. Rolling his eyes, he thanks the stallholder, shoves the cube into his pocket and pushes his way through the crowd until he reaches the fountain.
Startled, Harry nods. When Draco turns and starts to walk away, he hurriedly dries and snow-proofs his boots and scrambles to catch up with him.
Draco’s mouth flickers at one corner. “You have glitter and tiny little silver stars on your face. I’m not sure how else to put it.”
“I didn’t know there was such a thing,” Harry says, grinning. He draws his wand and Summons a worn paperback into his hand. “I borrowed this from Hermione… just in case you felt like something was missing from your day.”
“I’m sorry I’m late, not a word, merry Christmas,” Harry says all in one breath, shutting the back door and inhaling the delicious savoury steam that almost seems to fill the kitchen.
“Perhaps someone’s trying to cheer him up,” she suggests, curling her fingers around the pages of her notebook as though the photograph of Blaise and his beloved greyhound might come shooting out and give her away. “He hasn’t been himself since Carlie passed.”
Harry sighs into a mouthful of ice cream and hot fudge sauce, watching the master at work. In no time at all, Florean has produced a whole row of sundaes, sorbets and cones, presenting each to its delighted owner and refusing all offers of payment. Having heard both Ron and Hermione complain bitterly about meetings at the Ministry, he feels sure that their bosses are just doing it wrong. Florean, the vibrant heart of their community, has been conducting Diagon Alley meetings this way for a very long time, and though Harry knows some people would wonder how a group of people could eat at a time like this, it just… feels right. In fact, he can’t imagine any of the shopkeepers facing a crisis or making an important decision
“If you’re sure, we do have quite a lot to do,” Harry says, taking one look at Mr Borteg’s expression and heading for the coat rack. “Thank you.”
Harry follows his eyes and groans, suddenly aware of the frost underfoot and the freezing water soaking through his woollen socks.
There’s a clank of metal as Harry releases the rabbit back into its cage and locks the door. He gets to his feet, brushes himself down and steps closer to Draco.
come to work in her nightie with the Kneazles on it, but then she realises that everyone is staring at Harry, not her. Well, everyone apart from Draco, who is keeping his face carefully neutral and pretending to be interested in the report on his knee. Luna knows he is pretending because his colours are flickering wildly. She also knows because he is pretending to write with the wrong hand.
Feeling rather accomplished, Harry buys himself another cup of coffee and sits down on a bench to examine his purchases. Now the shops are beginning to fill and the sound of festive music is echoing down the street, mixing with the chatter of children and the repetitive calls of the stall-holders all around him. And he’s going to have to fight his way back into that, because he still needs a present for Draco. Of course, what he really wants to give him is time, and with Molly’s help, he is working on that, but the idea of Christmas coming and going without at least a small gift to hand over is a very unappealing one.
When she leaves to fetch their food, her grandson hobbles over and shakes each of their hands in turn.
“That’s not true,” Draco says, getting to his feet. “We have string, we have fibres from a standard hessian goods sack… we have a suspect pool. That’s something.”
“If you say so,” Draco mumbles, shooting him a searching look as he swings the bus around and speeds off in the opposite direction.
“Yeah. She said she could cast a protective bubble over the table so that it’d be like eating outside, inside. It’s really clever.”
“Needle, stop it,” Draco says, pushing the swan away when he tries to clamber up onto the bench. “He thinks he’s a much smaller bird, that’s the problem. As for the beginning… well, let’s do a summary: the café was first, a Sunday afternoon, cash taken and Christmas tree disturbed while Mrs Purley was upstairs. Then the apothecary, a Tuesday morning, the entire staff team was taking a weekly delivery, cash and presents taken plus some valuable pieces of stock. And now, another weekday morning, cash and gifts taken while Mr Jennings was in his stockroom. What else?”
“I’m sorry,” she says, finding a cherry to replace the one that has been sent flying out of the window. “Never again, I promise.”
Esmee laughs, and then coughs. “I love sunflowers,” she sighs happily. “Thank you, Harry. Would you put these in a vase for me, please? I wouldn’t normally ask but I feel like such an old lady today.”
“It’s a fine career,” Florean says, patting Timothy on the shoulder. “Granted, this is a bit of a baptism of fire for a brand new patrol officer, but you’re here now and we need your help. You can do it.”
“Thank you, Uncle Harry, indeed,” Hermione says, and then she’s fixing Harry with a look that makes him want to roll his eyes before she says another word. “You’re so good with them both. You’re going to be such a lovely father.”
“Put your back into it, Malfoy!” someone cries when the swan yet again evades Draco and bites him hard on the ankle.
Harry looks at him, and his bright smile shocks his heart. “That,” he mumbles, scrubbing at his hair. “I don’t usually care when people look at me. People have looked at me for years, I’m used to it. When you do it, it’s different.”
Mr Jennings rubs at his beard and leans on his doorframe. “Quills and inks need no ornament, young Miss Weasley.”
“Deb sent this,” Sam says, producing a pulsing red envelope from behind his back. “I think you’d better have it before it explodes.”
“That’s right,” Luna says. “And anyway, you thought you weren’t going to like Movement to Music and you did.”
They leave the room in silence. Not a word is spoken as they rise slowly through the building to the topmost floor. Draco’s heart hammers and he flicks secret glances at Harry, turning away when he glances back, feeling suddenly strung out and fearful. The editor, a tall, dark-skinned man in midnight blue robes, flings open the door of his office when they are only halfway along the corridor, and they scramble to reach him before he closes it again, and Draco thinks he might. He looks furious, and in a place like this, there’s no use trying to predict behaviour.
Harry gazes at his friends, at Hermione’s hopeful eyes and Ron’s relaxed, open face with just a small smear of gravy on it. He has to tell them. He has to, and he’s unlikely to find a better moment than this.
“Don’t be so bloody dramatic,” Draco says mildly, earning himself a poke in the arm from Mary Ann, who does not appear to be able to take her eyes away from Harry.
“Shut up,” Draco whispers, pulling back and driving into Harry, quickening his pace until all they can do is stare at each other and hold on.
Finally, the fog clears and Harry remembers. He remembers the fever and the coughing and the fight for breath, and he thinks he remembers leaning against Draco in a forest of sparkling purple lights. It is, however, quite possible that he dreamed that part.
The feeling of compression forces his breath out of him, and in the confusion, he hangs onto the very real handle for dear life.
“Well, I wasn’t getting any response in the kitchen so I thought I’d give it a go. Chimney needs a sweep, mate,” Ron says, starting to splutter again.
“And they are fine, too,” he says decisively, getting to his feet and holding out his hand to Draco. “Come on, or we’ll miss the best part.”
“Love is love, gentlemen, whether it’s between a man and his beetle or, heaven forbid, a Gryffindor and a Hufflepuff,” he says solemnly, and both boys glance at each other, sheepish but amused. “Be safe and be… er… fruitful,” he attempts, wilting under the hot, heavy sky and knowing that he is saying words, but not the right ones.
Her father picks up his knife and fork and starts to eat, pausing after a moment to peer into Luna’s eyes.
Draco meets his eyes for a moment, then smiles and turns to leave. Harry watches him go, stalking across the cobbles with Needle at his heels.
“Of course you can,” Draco murmurs, eyes hazy with need, breath coming quickly now. “We’ve waited long enough. Please.”
“Who else?” her father laughs. “I thought it’d be grand to do something for my best girl, you know, to celebrate the anniversary of her birth... I wish I could’ve done something when you turned seventeen, but it was...” he trails off, eyes misting over and she hugs him firmly.
His eyes are drawn, almost without his permission, to the window, where Draco is letting himself and Needle into the restaurant. Draco’s shoulders seem to sag as he turns nearly all the way to look at Borteg’s and then forces himself to turn back. Even Needle seems oddly solemn as he follows his master into the restaurant. The door closes behind them and Harry sighs.
Harry stares at the back of his head, insides pulled tight with guilt. Horrified with himself, he grips the wooden arms of his chair until his fingers hurt, wishing he could take the words back and replace them with something, anything, that wouldn’t make Draco’s shoulders freeze up with tension like that. In the history of all things, no, it hasn’t been a long time, but in the space of a life, it’s almost a distant memory. Harry hasn’t blamed Draco for his mistakes since the moment he saw through his eyes, but now he wonders if he’s ever said as much.
The glimmer of truth in his words is unexpected, and Draco finds himself smiling as he takes a bite of warm, crispy bread, thick, salty ham, melted cheese and sweet cherry tomatoes.
“Somewhere else, maybe?” Harry asks hopefully, knowing that if Draco forces him to apologise right here in the middle of the kitchen, there won’t be any getting out of it.
His most recent endeavour, a campaign for the protection of magical creatures, has come to a successful end, and with the next project not due to start until well into the new year, Harry is at the loose end to end all loose ends. It will be fine, he supposes. Christmas will be here before anyone is really ready for it, and George and Angelina’s wedding is less than three weeks away. He still hasn’t found anyone to bring with him, despite Ron and Hermione’s best efforts to fix him up with any vaguely attractive male they come across, and while he’s fine with attending by himself, he doesn’t think they’re about to give up.
“I rather thought you two would be pounding the streets by now,” Mr Borteg says, looming in the doorway to the distillery.
“Come on, Harry,” Eilish says, patting his shoulder. “It’s your turn to pick a carol. He’s not going anywhere.”
Harry scans the nearby fields, which quickly give way to rolling green hills. There is barely a fence in sight. Pushing down on a flicker of panic, he asks, “Are you sure?”
“Sorry about this, but… what the fuck, Mr J?” she explodes, dashing away tears with the back of her hand. “I was so worried about you! I brought you tea every day! I told you things… I trusted you.”
Draco says nothing, but looks slightly mutinous as he lurches off in his wellington boots, peering about him as though a goat might just pop up out of the ground at any moment. Harry decides to head off in the opposite direction, picking his way through the wild grasses and noting the troughs containing food that do, at least, indicate that the goats might be somewhere around. He smiles at the thought of what Ron and Hermione would say about all of this, and then locks the thought away before it makes him sad. He misses them, and it’s likely that they still think nothing has changed, that he is still at Hogwarts and that Draco Malfoy is simply a person who is no longer the enemy.
Deciding that Draco definitely isn’t ‘Silent Night’, he continues to browse the market stalls, humming along with the choir and making Daraja laugh with delight.
angry, and this morning, I’m going to finish my coffee and then we’re going to go and look in your toy box for something brightly coloured and noisy.”
When Draco arrives with Needle, Florean retreats to the counter and starts to assemble dishes and cones and towers of ice cream. Harry accepts his cone and sits in his usual seat, surprised when Draco leans over and places one of his banana split cherries on top of Harry’s cherry-almond scoop.
Esmee distributes gifts to the others, making sure not to leave out the unconscious patients. Charlotte, too, gets a present, despite her brother’s insistence that she isn’t even ill.
The plan starts simply enough. When Luna walks into the office just after lunch, she hits both Harry and Draco with a standard Cheering Charm, concealing her wand in her sleeve and ensuring that both are facing away from her, standing side by side before the large notice board containing all of the children’s names and schedules. They are not, of course, looking at one another, but staring straight ahead as though both pretending that they haven’t noticed the close proximity or even presence of the other.
He leans on the counter and holds in a sigh, smiling to the last customer as she passes. Something catches his eye and he finds himself looking at the Orisha cube, which is sitting innocently on the counter with its red flame flickering. Remembering Daraja’s suggestion, he picks up the cube as he’s been shown, ignoring Mr Borteg’s curious gaze. He closes his eyes and attempts to clear his mind, filling the space he has created with the image of Jean’s shop, the smashed glass and the ransacked Christmas tree. The glass cube warms gently in his hands and he holds on to the image, pushing away the memory of Draco’s hurt confusion and trying hard to focus. All at once, the cube flashes a pulse of heat against his hands and he jumps, eyes flying open.
“Of course, because you’re an intellectual,” Draco says. He pulls the lever that opens the doors and turns to Harry. “Stan didn’t want to come back after his experience with the Death Eaters. Ernie passed away just before the war ended. He was a very old man.”
Mr Borteg looks up with a creaky smile. “I am to be part of the wedding,” he says, mournful voice making the happy news sound vaguely ominous.
Draco strides into the dining room in his shirt, grey trousers and braces, taking a stack of menus from a baffled waiter and dropping into his seat. Harry stares at him openly until Hermione coughs and he pretends intense interest in his napkin. As Draco makes a series of introductions and passes out the menus, Harry’s eyes drift back to him, sliding over his ruffled hair and his strong hands and his slightly anxious smile.
Draco flicks the cork away with his thumb and pours the oil into his hand, sitting back to stroke a shiny trail over Harry’s chest, his belly and his cock. Harry watches him, drawing up one knee and inhaling the fragrant scent of the oil. It smells fantastic, like wood and spices and leather, and seems to settle and spread inside him until he feels relaxed enough to sink right through the bedclothes and onto the floor.
“Any chance we can put the admiration on hold and run through this afternoon’s schedule one more time?” Sam asks wearily.
“We got held back in the classroom—our Spell Damage tutor decided we needed a lecture on proper timekeeping,” Harry says, finding a spare seat next to Mary Ann. “She didn’t seem to see the irony.”
In the end, Draco drops him off at the end of the lane, some two hundred yards from the house, and Harry doesn’t comment on it. Instead, they part with a promise of tomorrow and a moment of intense eye contact that ensures Harry’s walk along the stony path to the house is an unsteady one.
“Where I keep the Christmas decorations, yes,” Draco says briskly, striding across the floor and hauling an unwieldy box out of a tall cupboard. “Every year they complain that I haven’t decorated, and every year I do it when they aren’t expecting me to. It’s rather fun, actually.”
He blinks slowly, and when the table comes into focus again, every single lady is holding out some form of the bright red potion, be it a bottle, a vial, or, in Danica’s case, a jar of scarlet granules, which she shakes in his direction.
“I thought that last one wasn’t going to go in,” Draco says, swiping his damp hair off his forehead with the back of his hand.
“That’s right,” someone else says. “All this wonderful entertainment and it’s all for a good cause.”
“It’s funny,” Draco says, letting his knee rest against Harry’s. “I recognise all those words but I still have no idea what you’re talking about.”
“I’m not the only person who has these boots, you know. And I hardly think it’s ethical behaviour for an officer of the Ministry to… entrap people with things hidden on the floor,” he says, glaring at Timothy.
“No, we’ve always just met on the bus,” Danica says, drawing an enormous patterned teapot from a cupboard and admiring it. “We’ll be back tomorrow. She won’t rest for long, you know how she is. You two have a nice time by yourselves.”
“Of course you do,” Corrie says, shaking her head. She reaches into her bag and pulls out one more bobble hat, this one in thin black and white stripes.
The raw candour of Thora’s words has crept under his skin, scrubbing him sore, and he’s not ready to share any of it. He can’t help wondering what she has written in Draco’s card, but he’s not going to ask. Not yet, anyway. A cool hand rests on the back of his neck and he breathes quietly, closing his eyes for a moment.
“Indeed. I’ve been rather lonely without a dog... though someone has been sending me the most thoughtful gifts. It’s almost as though they’ve been trying to cheer me up.”
Unfazed, Mr Borteg retrieves a small box and opens it. “Shan was kind enough to bring these last night. The new Christmas crackleball,” he explains in a reverent whisper.
“I have come to see what you are all up to. And,” he says, trailing his wand over the curtain and then hitting it with a shimmering spell, “why you seem to have put a silencing charm on my curtain.”
“Harry, the main thing is that no one’s hurt,” Shan says stiffly. “We can remake all of this as soon as we get back into our kitchen.”
“Ruined, my foot,” scoffs the old lady from Eeylops Owl Emporium, pausing outside the quill shop to cast a stiff warming charm on her waxed jacket. “Don’t you know how to darn?”
“I should have known,” Draco says. “Saint Potter… building schools for African children… telling us all not to step on bristle beetles…”
Harry takes the small cake and admires it. The pure white icing shimmers with the most delicate glitter, and a wafer thin sugar snowflake balances on top. With Molly’s eyes on him, he takes a bite, and of course it’s wonderful. The sponge is light and soft, concealing a well of chocolate sauce that goes perfectly with the buttery mint of the frosting.
Everyone else is already wearing their new Christmas jumpers, including Hugo, who is sitting on the floor and chewing on his blue woollen sleeve. Harry rips off the paper and inspects this year’s offering, a soft, chunky knit in deep red with a small ‘H’ over the breast and a large picture of a triple-decker bus.
Now that he’s alone with Draco, every useful word seems to have flown out of his head and all he can do is stare as the panic rises in his chest. He pushes his hands into his pockets just for something to do, and his fingers brush against the crackleball.
Draco takes the parcel and unwraps it slowly, revealing a jumper in Knight Bus purple with a glittering white triple-decker and the promised cat.
As Harry examines his intricately patterned bobble hat, Corrie produces four more, all knitted from the same pattern but each in a different colour. Ida’s soft pink makes her silvery hair glow, Danica’s pistachio picks out the green flecks in her eyes, and the russet yarn Corrie has chosen for Eilish warms her skin the moment she jams it on her head. Harry puts his on and looks to Corrie for approval.
“Well, it’s Jayne Cavendish,” Ginny says, making a face. “She’s a superstar Quidditch player and I’m... well, you know... I only met her that once. Still, I thought, what the hell have I got to lose?”
“How do you know it’s a him?” Draco asks, as Harry carefully surrounds the spider with a charm that will give an accurate measurement of his leg-span.
As they head further into the heart of the village, there are signs of festivity everywhere. The shops and houses, made of warm, honey-coloured stone, are lit from within by gentle lamps and strung with multi-coloured lights. The iron railings and neat rows of conifers sparkle with frost and delicate decorations, and in the square, an enormous spruce sits slightly askew, dotted with glimmering bulbs and towering over a traditional wooden nativity scene, the likes of which Harry has not seen since he was a child. Behind the tree looms a black and white fronted Tudor building with its sign, flapping in the wind, reading ‘The Cart and Earwig’.
He holds the flowers carefully, pushing open the door with his hip and stepping inside, surprised to find the shop completely empty.
“Take Florean,” Draco says, glancing at Harry. “He’s eaten one of those things at every meeting I’ve ever been to. Where does he put it all? Why is Mr Borteg’s cone so tiny? Does Mr Jennings know that toffee ice cream and tomato sorbet just don’t go together?”
“You should drink some tea,” one of them suggests, but when he tries, the hot liquid stings his throat and he splutters, coughing until he is bent double and his chest is wracked with pain.
“You do know I’m staying in a hotel, don’t you?” Draco whispers, pressing an indulgent smile to his ear. “Not in a tent in the middle of nowhere?”
He relaxes against his pillows, allowing his eyes to drift contentedly closed as Draco presses hot, slow kisses against his neck and eases him open with one hand still lazily stroking his cock. He’s been hard and wanting for so long now that he knows he won’t last long, and when Draco slides inside him in one, long stroke, he lets out a needy little whine that makes him want to cover his face in embarrassment. Draco catches his breath and asks him to do it again.
“You can hire your skates from over here,” he says, gesturing to a new stall piled high with ice skates of all colours and sizes, “and Mrs Purley has refreshments for… how much, Mrs Purley?”
Harry takes a deep breath, makes a cone shape around his mouth and calls out to them, attempting to mimic their vibrating cry and perhaps—one never knows—draw them to him. Once again, several goats look up but quickly lose interest. When an almost deafening bleat blasts out at close range, Harry jumps, just about ready to whirl around and face some sort of enormous monster goat, and then it rings out again and he realises that the sound is coming from Draco, who is leaning down towards the stream, copying Harry’s cupped hands and almost perfectly reproducing the uncanny, childlike cry of the creatures below.
Draco glances around at the people of Diagon Alley. Harry’s right, of course, some of them are looking, but it’s hard to know exactly what about the little scene is capturing their interest. It could be them, of course, but it’s at least equally likely that people are looking at the crocodile.
“I’m not sure. My lunch break started at one and I’ve been shouting at you through the fire for a good few minutes,” Hermione says. “I’d better go. Please eat something.”
“Indeed. I thought you might say that,” Florean says, and then winks at Harry and raises his voice. “You see, I’m looking to create a very special Christmas ice cream today, and what I really need is a helper… someone who really likes ice cream and isn’t afraid of getting a little bit messy with the chocolate sauces and the honey and the fudge…”
Ginny grins. “Mum sort of lost it when she realised she’d invited twenty people over for Christmas lunch, and then when Hermione tried to extend the dining room further than usual, all the baubles started pelting off the Christmas tree and Kingsley wouldn’t stop barking.”
“You’re missing the point,” Draco says. “If someone can easily fade into the background to start with, a simple Notice-me-Not charm would be enough to conceal them and their sack of loot quite effectively.”
On Sunday morning, Harry is startled from a heavy sleep by the sound of scraping, whooshing, and finally coughing from his bedroom fireplace. Caught between alert suspicion and the last threads of a dream about driving the Knight Bus while having his hair stroked by a ghostly, pale figure, he scrambles upright, grabs his wand and yells, “Malfoy, stop it!”
Despite managing to avoid almost all discussion of the Granger issue, Draco’s stress levels continue to shoot skywards, and by mid-morning, he has abandoned all pretences and practically glued himself to the Eye in the Sky, training it on the colourful shopfront and scanning for signs of movement.  Pansy watches him silently as she sifts through parchments, reads out the news and plays record after record. It occurs to him that she is choosing the songs he likes best and he wants to thank her, but the words seem to be stuck in his throat and the basslines make his stomach ache.
Draco smiles against his mouth and slips his tongue against Harry’s, hot and soft and over too soon. Harry gasps, woodsmoke and spices and lemons, feeling the blood rush away from his head to press his cock, already needy and aching, against his fly. He knows that the people near the fire can’t see them, but he can hear their voices and smell their food and he doesn’t know if he is terrified or if he wants Draco right now on this frozen hillside.
Harry’s lip twitches. He tries to keep it under control, but there is something about Draco’s very real bewildered exasperation that just takes his anger and dissolves it into bubbles of amusement in his chest. He can’t help it, and seconds later, he is laughing. To his relief, Draco’s mouth tugs into a reluctant smile, and soon, he too has lost control, alternating between bursts of laughter and mumbles of disbelief as he turns the little fishy tape measure over and over in his hands.
Juno peers at him for a moment and then abandons Harry’s shoulder, dashing across the floor, up the stairs and out of sight.
“I wouldn’t use that word if I were you,” Draco advises, sipping his hot punch. “You don’t want the shopkeepers to think you’re accusing them of anything.”
Something about the sound and proximity of Draco’s voice makes Harry shiver, and he can practically taste the sharp sweetness of strawberry syrup on the tip of his tongue.
As the dramatic, sweeping sound of strings fills the room, she turns around just in time to see Eliza shooting her new favourite dancing partner a significant glance as if to say that whatever anyone else might think,
Gathering his bags, Harry steps into the crowds, immediately beginning to procrastinate by heading to the Magical Menagerie and buying festive treats for Juno, Montague, and Harry the mouse. In a tiny shop that smells of incense and candles, he finds a vivid, multicoloured scarf for Audrey, and for Thora, a tin of very fancy coffee that might, he hopes, cheer her up for a minute or two.
“We can be swans and sharks… and squids… in glittery tights,” Luna says, allowing her mind to drift momentarily and picturing Draco’s beautiful spins and stretches.
When Harry turns to Draco, his tight expression has relaxed and he’s almost smiling as he watches them together.
“We? All of us?” Harry asks, trying to ignore the insinuation that Draco has been waiting around for
When they reach the shop, Mr Borteg is waxing lyrical to a customer with his customary theatrical panache and they walk past him into the office without exchanging a word. Once safely out of sight, Harry pulls Draco to him and kisses him, cold lips and caught breath and a wave of pure relief.
“Bloody awful,” Jean supplies. She sits in her chair and gathers her blanket. “Have a biscuit, lads, the pot needs a bit longer.”
Luna smiles, thinking of Horace, and wondering just how many times he has been begged to read from the
Harry waves to her and turns back to his customer. By the time he has finished with his explanation, the woman has selected three more bottles and seems to be enjoying herself. Feeling rather accomplished, Harry rings up her purchases while she inspects the tree in the window.
“Me too,” Ron says. “Dad fancies the Knight Bus for his birthday—do you think he’d do us a group discount?”
Harry grins at Draco across the table, pleased to see that he has put on his floral bonnet and is eating steadily. He’s fitting in just perfectly, and Harry can’t wait to tell him that he is now expected to attend lunch with most of these oddballs every Sunday afternoon. Draco smiles at him, eyes warm and full of promises of the yet-to-come. The snowflakes fall around them, building into soft drifts against the hedges and across the roof of the shed. Harry watches them, toasty warm inside Narcissa’s magical bubble. He looks at Mr Borteg, who is waving his hands all over the place as he expounds on the finer points of malting and distillation. Perhaps he’ll teach Harry to make whisky; he suspects he only needs to ask.
“Of course we know. You’ve been acting very oddly,” Hermione says. “And then there was the cat hair, and the fact that you’re out all the time even though you’re not doing a campaign. We know you, Harry.”
Once all of the scattered pencil crayons have been picked up and Rose has been stuffed into her coat, the four of them step out into the snow and head for number twelve. The walk isn’t a long one, but Harry is more aware than usual of the downside of living away from the alley. He thinks he’ll always be the last to know when something unusual happens, and there’s every possibility that the thief could hit Borteg’s and he wouldn’t be on the scene at all.
“I’m terrified,” she says, dropping the needle onto the next record and flicking off both omnivoxes. “Not really,” she adds, smirking. “Sounds like fun.”
“Do you have to fuss?” Draco sighs, pulling the lever that compresses the whole bus to allow it to slip between two heavy goods vehicles. “You’re like a mother hen,” he adds, voice seeming slow and distorted in Harry’s ears.
“That’s what I thought,” Timothy sighs, folding Jean’s towel in his lap. “I feel like I’m at my nan’s but like… all the time.”
“What I’m interested to know is why you let Malfoy talk you into doing it and then walk off without even helping,” Ron says, shaking his head.
“I can do that. Besides, we should sit down and get everything in order tomorrow. Nobody likes a disorganised confrontation.”
Mr Fortuna lets out an enormous bark of laughter. “They didn’t need me! ‘STRANGER, MUMMY!’ the little girl shouted, and she was out in a flash! I certainly wouldn’t have trifled with her!”
voice is unmistakeable. Intrigued, she creeps along the edge of the stream, holding her bag tightly against her side and ducking behind each tree she encounters. The conversation seems to have stopped dead, and when she finally lays her eyes on them, she knows why.
“Look at all these levers, Juno,” he whispers, tracing his fingers over rows and rows of mysterious brass knobs. “Here’s the one to open the doors, and here’s the one to squash the bus thin…”
Harry says nothing and Draco shakes his head, immediately lifting a hand from the wheel to tuck a stray swathe of hair behind his ear. Today’s shirt is a rich sort of wine colour, and Harry finds himself drawn to the way it sits in bold contrast against the pale skin of Draco’s neck. He seems to have aged well and is changed barely at all from then young man Harry last saw—at least saw for certain—at the age of eighteen. All of his lines are still sharp and sweeping, and as he urges the bus along a winding country road, concentration makes his profile harsher still.
Setting down his cup, he runs up the stairs, taking each flight two by two, feeling like a child and loving every second. He hauls the box down to the living room and then returns for the tree, the skeleton of a large spruce that he has kept and re-used for as long as he can remember, carefully spelling it a different colour every year. Once in place in front of the living room window, he touches the tip of his wand to the uppermost branch, thinks for a moment, and then casts until the whole thing is a shimmering silver-grey.
Pansy trails into silence for a moment and Draco hurries over to the window, carrying his omnivox with him.
“Harry, I’ve just had a robbery,” Mr Jennings says, voice strained. Harry doesn’t correct him. “I don’t think this is the time to be spending money on new stock.”
“Yes it is, and we need to all get into the bus and be ready to leave at twelve,” Deb says. “Not ten past twelve or quarter past twelve—twelve o’clock, and you all need to be ready. Okay?”
“Oh,” the customer says, looking disappointed as she places a basket on the counter. “I was going to get this one, but that sounds so wonderful… maybe I should come back.”
“Alright then.” Draco clears his throat. “In the corner of a first-class smoking carriage, Mr Justice Wargrave, lately retired from the bench, puffed at a cigar and ran an interested eye through the political news in the Times. He laid the paper down and… what on earth is that?”
“We have the motive and we have the suspects and now we just need to find them,” Granger said and broke the long moment of silence.
“That won’t be a problem,” Draco said and waved his hand. The air between them shimmered and the room was suddenly split between where Harry was sitting and where Draco was, on the other side of a barrier. He scooted closer and touched it; it was solid. He couldn't see it, but he could feel it.
“Well, then no, I don’t think I am okay,“ Harry said. The name felt right, familiar, but the people around him, or the room? No, he had no idea who they were or where he was.
“It wasn’t like anyone would have hired me or trained me in a profession here either,” Draco continued. “It was either leave or poverty.” Draco looked him in the eyes then. “I don’t think I would have liked poverty.”
Draco laughed and then moaned when Harry pressed his cock against Draco’s. Draco was staring at him while he pleasured himself and Harry was staring right back. Yes, Draco was very attractive and he was very... Draco, but there was something more here too. At least Harry thought so.
“I like looking at you,” Harry said, coming closer. By now it was second nature to him to call up the barrier when they got in the mood. He had never been completely naked with Harry before, and he really couldn’t wait for the day he could touch Harry, kiss him, intertwine their fingers.
“Come on, Draco,” she says, smiling at him as she reaches down to touch her toes. “If you don’t warm up, you can’t dance.”
Harry nods, and he and Mr Jennings head off in different directions. He is not at all surprised that Mrs Purley would choose to open up her café and carry on as normal. He’s known her for a long time now and he doubts it would occur to her to do anything else.
“That’s very sweet of you, Corrie,” says the woman called Danica, and Harry looks between them as he allows Eilish to shove him into a spare armchair.
He walks away, long coat whipping behind him. In the corner, Needle wakes from a long sleep and hisses in protest at being left behind. He stretches his long neck out of his crate and rests his head on the stone floor, peering up at Harry with his clever little eyes.
“Yep,” Harry says, sketching an awkward little wave at the nurse who is now bustling towards them across the crowded hospital foyer. “Why exactly is she so cross?”
“Absolutely,” Harry says, for some reason wondering if he’s going to be asked to give Needle a bath. He’ll do it. He’ll be pecked to pieces, but he’s too happy right now to care.
“I mean that you’re here a lot,” Luna says innocently. “It’s nice. We all like having you here. Me and Sam and Mary Ann and Deb… and the children.”
Draco gazes at him evenly for what seems like a long time. “Don’t take this the wrong way, Potter, but I have been persuaded to take pity on you.”
Harry hasn’t ever been very good at multitasking, but he holds on for as long as he can, urged on by Draco’s shudders and gasps and the unhurried flicker of a hot tongue exactly where he needs it, until all he can think about is that mouth on his and Draco’s cock inside him. Without a word, he summons the oil from the bedside into his hand and rolls Draco onto his back, feeling himself flushing all over as he fucks himself on his fingers and holding the eye contact anyway, because Draco’s breathing is ragged, beautiful, and he can’t look away from Harry.
“I could,” Harry agrees, just as the swan climbs up onto the fountain and splashes cold water into Draco’s face with its massive wings. Draco seems to sag slightly and Harry gives in. “Use a spell. A really mild stunning spell. Then just sort of… stuff it into the box.”
Draco continues to read out the news, watching Pansy as she sips her coffee, grimaces, and puts the cup back on the desk. He’s almost certain the coffee thief is one of the ‘late’ people. He and Pansy share their studio with the other ‘earlies’, Dave, who hosts the lunchtime show from twelve until five, and his weekend counterpart, Mad Annie, while the hosts of the evening and night-time programmes work out of the studio across the hall. The rivalry that exists between earlies and lates is mostly artificial and results in nothing more than pointless pranks, but Draco has no doubt that one of those hooligans is to blame for the sludge he and Pansy are now drinking.
The old lady laughs, looking down at him as though noticing him for the first time. “Goodness, no, dear, just in the town. If he’d managed to leave her in the lake, she’d have had his guts for garters.”
At eight fifteen, just as Pansy is reading the news, the Prophet is dumped on Draco’s desk and he leafs through it, just in case there are any articles on Harry that he has missed. On page four, he is startled to find several pictures of himself outside the Magical Menagerie. The photographs, clearly taken from a distance with some sort of long-focus lens, show him entering the shop with bags of food and then leaving empty-handed. The pictures are time-stamped, showing a range of dates over almost a three week period.
“I don’t remember agreeing to turns. Besides, I’ve got customers to serve. You told me less than ten minutes ago that you have absolutely nothing to do.
Harry wakes on Saturday morning to the spirited discussion of Grimmauld Place’s magpie population and a sharp, pinching pain in his back. Grumbling under his breath, he rummages underneath himself and pulls out the book he had been trying to read the night before. He directs a severe glance at the cover and then flings it onto the bedclothes, opting to get up before he actually gets comfortable. He puts on his glasses and looks out of the window, cheered to find bright sunshine, clear blue sky and a light coating of sparkling frost.
. Now he can hear the tack-tack-tacking of a beetle who knows he’s in the soup, and he’s actually going to have to walk away from this. Prickling with irritation, he throws on the first clothes he sees and flings open the bedroom door. Stanley shoots out from under the coffee table and bobbles around his feet, directing ingratiating little clicks up at his knees. Because of course, the little bugger is adorable, and Draco is almost sold until he spots the mess of soil and leaves and ceramic in front of the door.
“Same as always. I knit ’em and give ’em to the children’s home,” she says. “Keep the little ones warm.”
She doesn’t usually like to talk about the war—especially not here, amongst all these children who have lived in its shadow for much of their short lives, lost parents and friends and brothers and sisters—but just sometimes, she has to ignore her own rules in favour of her better instincts.
“I had no idea your workplace was so thrilling,” Blaise says, and in his inattention, the puppy manages to slip its collar and make a dash for the food table.
He has had arguments before, he thinks, gazing into the flames. Loads of them. With bells on. He has been insulted, snapped at, told to go and fuck himself more times than he can count, plenty of those times by Draco, but somehow this is different. He’s restless with it, unable to settle or to fall into bed and designate the whole thing tomorrow’s problem. Draco has royally fucked with his head, and he can’t decide if he’s furious or a little bit impressed.
“That was your news update at eleven fifteen,” he says into his omnivox, turning around in his chair to look at Pansy, who is peering down at the street through the Eye in the Sky. “It’s Tuesday the nineteenth of April and there is no sign of a reprieve from the rain any time soon. Can you actually see anything out there, Pans?”
It seems that George’s prediction was correct—the little stall is doing a roaring trade in charmed sunglasses, cameras, and souvenir t-shirts. Someone has even had the bright idea of selling cups of cold pumpkin juice, which, owing to the unseasonably warm weather, are disappearing almost as fast as poor Verity can supply them.
By the time he disappears out of view, the morning dew has climbed all the way up his trousers to his knees, and the sight of it makes Harry smile.
Harry and Draco agree that they are very fine bobbles indeed, and when the spell ends, Harry provides the all-important measurements.
Draco loves Pansy like the waspish, gossipy sister he never had, but it would be diplomatic, verging on ridiculous, to say that she is not a morning person. In fact, he has often suspected that the only reason she sees the early daylight hours at all is because she is still awake from whatever glittering social event she has attended the night before. Draco can’t remember the last time he found himself at a glittering social event, partly because he finds them dull and stressful and partly because he was dragged along to enough of them in his childhood to leave him thoroughly disinclined.
,” Draco whispers, just as Harry’s orgasm takes over him, seeming to contract every muscle in his body in a ragged wave.
The lace-covered table he had sat at the night before last is now smaller and covered in an array of knitting needles, books, sweets, and what seems to be the aftermath of a game of Exploding Snap. In the middle of it all sits a large teapot wearing a bright green knitted cosy and a tray full of scones, tea bread, and a whole host of little pots containing butter and fruit jams.
“Sounds good,” Harry says, and she grins before kissing him on the top of the head and hurrying off down the stairs.
“You’re not looking for a tall, dark and handsome man who almost played professional Quidditch, then?” he asks innocently, standing beside Harry and peering into a tank of iridescent beetles.
Draco turns to him, pale skin bathed in soft blue light. “What do Malfoys do, or what do my mother and I do?”
“Let’s do that,” Harry says, shivering with a mixture of cold and anticipation. “Let’s fucking do that.”
“You just about got here in time,” says Ginny, hurrying over with a couple of steaming glass mugs. “Ginger mulled mead,” she informs them, handing over the glasses and smirking without a shred of shame as Draco thanks her.
Mr Borteg glances at his feet with interest but says nothing as Harry dries his socks with a spell and laces up the shoes, all the while balancing Hugo against his hip.
“We could go to Canada,” Draco says, picking up their earlier conversation with ease. “I’ve heard it’s beautiful.”
“Malfoys don’t dance,” she repeats, laughing, as they walk out of the room a few minutes later and almost straight into Harry.
“You’re not going to ignore him, are you?” Harry says hopefully. “I mean, you’re too honourable for that these days.”
It’s almost completely dark by the time he sees Draco leaving the restaurant, face grim and large box dangling from one hand by the flaps.
The rain is pounding against the roof and windows by the time Draco seems satisfied with his work, and it is all Harry can do not to grab him and pull him down onto the hearthrug where he stands. All of his weariness and discomfort have dissolved and he feels as though he could do anything.
He leans against the wall and watches Draco moving around his tiny kitchen. He is different, somehow, yet again—more at ease in every action than Harry has ever seen him before. He hums to himself, pushing the hair out of his eyes and tipping sliced mushrooms into the sizzling pan, reaching up for fresh herbs and allowing Harry to admire the way his dark jeans hang on his hips. He is beautiful. The harsh morning sunlight illuminates every visible rib, every slicing pink scar, every faded grey line against pale flesh, and he is beautiful.
“It’s… ‘rather too young to be allowed’ and ‘comes in a very nice bottle’,” the man reads, voice stretched thin with the stress of pleasing a difficult person.
Harry looked down at Malfoy’s belly. “It’s not advisable when you’re pregnant,” it wasn’t his kid, but Harry was concerned. He told himself it was just because if Malfoy had a miscarriage, he would have to try for Li’s child again, and set back their marriage by another 9 months. "Why can't we invite him here instead?"
“It’s beneficial for both of us,” Malfoy spoke faster, desperation starting to tinge his tone. “There is a reason why both of you came to Petra, and not Kesha, or Goryeo.”
“What business do you have with Malfoy?” Ginny said unhappily. She must have recognised either the owl, or the emblem on the hardened wax seal.
The blonde stood up and bowed in greeting as Harry entered, richly dressed in a high-necked green robe, the hems lined in gold embroideries of the Chinese Fireball and a giant wolf.
There was an insult implied there somewhere, Harry thought, but Malfoy only accepted it breezily. “I’m glad my life amuses you, Blaise.”
“I promise I won’t penalise you, Horace,” Harry had an inkling of what he was going to hear anyway, “even if you say something untoward about my court.” He revealed his mind.
It was not proper; at this point, Draco was just a fiance of the King. He had not been appointed as a Prince Consort. But Slughorn had suggested, and Shacklebolt agreed, that the gesture of commitment would be much appreciated. Nobody could afford the 9-month wait.
As Harry lay face down in his bed, for the first time in his life, he couldn’t help but thank Merlin for having a separate bedroom from his wife.
Petra’s King raised his head. He surveyed the room with the same tired, lifeless eyes, before he reached out and took his wife’s hand.
Harry raised an eyebrow. “Let’s have it,” the sarcasm was clear in his voice, his disbelief that young Nott could offer anything of use apparent.
Harry swore he would work his hardest so that Teddy would never have to experience the hell on earth that was a war ever, in his life.
“Harry,” Ginny leaned close and cupped his face. “Harry, please don’t do this. I love you… does it mean nothing?”
“We’re going shopping?” Zhongli looked pleasantly surprised. He was always happy to peruse through wares.
“Hmm,” the blonde nodded, the items passing his keen discerning eyes for quality. “Blaise,” he called the other pureblood aristocrat without looking at him.
The blonde settled down at the third chair, the small throne at Harry’s left, and the morning assembly commenced.
The moment the Sorting Hat was taken off the last first-year student’s head, Professor McGonagall rose to her feet and cleared her throat. “To new, and not-so-new students of Hogwarts, welcome, and welcome back,” she smiled, the curve of her lips heartfelt despite the tired lines of her gaunt face. “It warms me so much to see you here. Just a few months ago this hall had seen a terrible battle, but we shall not be trapped in the past. Let us move on, forgive even if we cannot forget, because what’s worse is to let the cycle of hatred spark another tragedy. To my dearest Slytherins,” the old witch directed her gaze to the table which had been the most subdued during the Welcome Ceremony, her blue eyes wise and painfully similar to Dumbledore’s. “I thank you all for coming back.”
Tartaglia continued to look down coldly at Malfoy. Seconds crawled unbearable slowly at a snail’s pace, until the silence was broken with a snigger.
The Queen took a sharp breath. “I can’t believe it…” she remarked through gritted teeth. “You are all actually seriously proposing this… this preposterous idea!”
“Welcome to Petra’s Royal Castle,” Harry spoke as he looked into those passive grey eyes, his voice sincere, “I hope this place can be your new home.”
When Harry learned of the arrangement that Malfoy and Li had agreed to with regards to the compensation, his blood boiled.
Malfoy’s face brightened. “I won’t let you down, Your Majesty,” his pitiful mien transformed to that of determination. “Get me Ulysses!” He turned to the guards and ordered them to bring the blonde’s eagle owl to him. The blonde stood up and made to leave, presumably to prepare for the trip, but before he reached the door, he surprised Harry again by bowing his head to Luna and Hermione. “Lady Lovegood and Lady Granger, may I please request you to join this short trip as well? I think Gre… Lord Zhongli is a knowledgeable man whose presence you will enjoy.”
The mansion did not look like anything out of the ordinary from the gates, but once Harry stepped in, he was surprised by the interior.
Harry eventually conceded. “But you will conceive with me… not any future pureblood lover you may or may not discreetly have,” he bared his teeth.
The committee had painstakingly deliberated over the best engagement ring - whether it should be one of the Potter’s family heirlooms or not, and if it’s to be a new custom made ring, what metal and gems should it be made of. Ginny’s ring didn’t even take longer than one day to settle; Harry had simply chosen one ring from the many gifts from the nobles for his ascension to the throne, a gold ring with big rubies and diamonds.
Now, what Harry felt for the blonde couldn’t be summed into one word anymore. It was a complicated jumble of emotions.
Harry stared at the taller boy, the way the little fires cast shadows on his sallow face, until Malfoy appeared to have noticed Harry’s stare, and turned toward Harry. Grey met green for the shortest fraction of a second before Malfoy threw his gaze to the floor.
Her expression was fully contrite when Harry leaned over to gaze at Teddy. “I’m sorry I didn’t let you know of those customs beforehand, Harry. Most pureblood customs aren’t documented… They were passed down from parents to children...we just grew up with them, and they become our common sense but not common sense to anyone else…”
Harry didn’t reply. His heart was beating too loudly for him to hear anything else. He opened the letter quickly, like pulling a bad tooth.
Harry could see the moment Slughorn gave up. His straight-backed posture changed slightly. For once, Slughorn looked weary and every inch the centennial he was. “Your Majesty…” His eyes were imploring.
“I know, isn’t it wonderful?” Hermione replied absently as she flitted across her room, rummaging through piles of books and clothes to choose what to pack into her trunk. “I’ve read that other wizarding schools exist, of course, but never have thought I’d get to spend a term there! Nobody has ever said anything about an exchange programme, even during the triwizard tournament. I have been curious enough to contemplate visiting, but, oh,” she suddenly stopped with a sigh. “This is such a pleasant surprise.”
“No, it wasn’t like this between us,” Draco said. “I know you wanted to fuck me, Harry, but there was no lube.”
Harry swallowed his bite and looked at Antoine, but not into his eyes. There was something about vampires being able to make you do things. Draco had...Harry couldn’t quite remember, but he remembered enough to know that he had been annoyed with Draco because of it. He rubbed the scar absentminded.
“I don’t know. The truth is that I don’t know him,” Harry said and realized that it was really true. He had probably never known Draco. He had imagined Draco, had built him up in his mind and his memory to be this antagonist of his childhood. But they had only a handful of encounters and conversations over the years.
“Well, he is our only good lead. He and the paintings. I mean...what you described is pretty similar to how we found the victims,” Ivan said.
Draco sat up and closed his eyes. He breathed for a few minutes and Harry watched him. Watched his chest and his face and his neck, so tempting, really. Had Draco always been so tempting?
“You tried and you failed, and then you tried again and again and again and failed, again and again and again. What makes you think you can do it this time?”
“It’s the best solution, you could try to dig up some dirt on your dirtbag of a former publisher, but that will take time and the sooner you deal with this the better Draco. But of course, that is only my humble opinion,” Pansy said and handed him another petit Fours. Draco took that one too.
“Then you will have to come out as Belladonna and hope for the best. Maybe we can combine your unveiling-“
Harry grabbed the menu for something to do and because he needed food inside his system too. As an Owl trainer he pretty much made his own hours, but that also meant that they weren’t very regular ones. Some owlets learned faster than others, some weren’t going to be any good at delivering letters and packages at all. Harry had stumbled into it three years ago, but he enjoyed the work and having his own business very much.
He had realized that he probably never loved his father, not like a child should have. He craved the recognition and approval, but had known deep down that his father had seen him as an heir to his own achievements, so they could live on. He had never seen Draco.
“I bet you did. I bet Granger and Weasley told you all that there is to know about me,” Draco interrupted hotly and shoved the sleeve of his robes up to show Potter the Dark Mark. He hadn’t taken it willingly, but it was there now, and he was done feeling ashamed for it.
Bain shook her head. “No one is talking. Julien is still in the wind. But we are pretty sure he is the mastermind behind it all.”
Yes, Draco had come to pretty much the same conclusion. “But is it obvious?” He asked. Blaise had big plans for this book. He was really into this whole publishing thing and he told Draco he was going to specialize in pornography. Well, erotica.
“You’re right. It does seem so natural, that you and I are here.” Draco began. “Sometimes I don’t know if I love it or hate it – or rather, I try to lie to myself and pretend I’m unsure. You’re right, it
Plants, flowers, and trees, both magical and muggle, were spaced in rows (though not the neatest) and where there were no rows, there were random clusters, surrounded by mulch in some places, grass in others. Tufts of monkey grass grew merrily throughout, looking somehow, against all odds, intentional. There was even a tiny forest that he wasn’t sure was
Draco is flying quite well, playing chaser this time, avoiding bludgers, and has scored two goals. Draco’s team, the Thestrals, made up of five eighth years and two seventh years, is up by thirty points so far. The trailing Hippogriffs, with only three eighth years and four seventh years, haven’t been doing as well, but they are still in the game.
“Harry, don’t be absurd! If you’d been slipped a love potion, you’d know. You’d be right uncontrollable by now, Merlin knows what you’d be-”
Against his better judgment – Neville was his mate, after all – Harry took in Neville’s seated form from top to bottom – first, he noticed the crease in his brow, but then his eyes traveled downward to Neville’s deep, brown eyes, focused in concentration on a book. His eyes travelled lower to Neville’s lips – they were full, and as Harry watched, Neville drew his bottom lip in with his teeth as his brow creased further. Harry suddenly felt hot. His eyes travelled down to Neville’s chest –
Harry’s thoughts strayed to how Draco looked in Defense that morning. His hair was unruly – well, unruly for Draco, that is. Harry had a passing desire to run his fingers through it.
Malfoy and Li turned to look at each other, conversing through their eyes. The sight only angered Harry even more.
Malfoy only twisted his lips. “Well, I’ve known that I would have a child by twenty since I was a child myself.” One hand rested on his stomach unconsciously.
“Gin,” Harry didn’t know how to make her understand. “Macnair wasn’t the end. There are so many other conservative purebloods-”
Harry’s throat felt swollen, choked with unspeakable emotions. “No, they won’t be, ‘Mione,” he whispered hoarsely as his fingers found their way to her hand.
“Zhongli xian sheng,” an unfamiliar baritone voice rang through the dining room, young and playful, yet hiding the edge of a razor under the thin veneer of a velvet sheath. “It’s mean of you to have started without me.”
The hallways were filled to the brim by beautiful and exotic decorations, from things that hung on the walls and ceilings, like tapestries and lanterns, to items that could be placed on the floor or tables. The rugs, the vases, even tablecloths - they all looked luxurious and exquisitely designed. Gold lacquer and embroideries gleamed everywhere, depicting various motifs of dragons and phoenixes. It was hard to believe that the occupants of this mansion only recently moved in. It was like a hoarder’s paradise.
The bad news was, Macnair refused to name any accomplices and he had killed himself with a hidden dagger to keep his secrets to the death. He must have been very desperate for a proud pureblood wizard to choose to end his life the muggle way.
Harry looked down at the plate of treacle tarts he’d pilfered for himself. Would he have to go without these for months?
“Your Majesty, please call me Horace,” The Potion teacher couldn’t help but preen a little. Harry didn’t miss the shadow of concern that crossed Slughorn’s blue eyes, however. Harry used to not be able to read subtle changes in expressions… it was surprising how much he’d changed since he’d taken the throne.
“Do you know why?” Draco asks, voice raspy with disuse, and Harry wonders again whether he’s had anything to drink.
He thinks back to all the times the words to some inane conversation would die in his throat whenever he passed Malfoy in the halls. Or whenever Malfoy entered a classroom. Or the eighth-year common room. Anywhere, really. Harry’s tongue apparently wasn’t fussy about where it would fail, only when.
But as his thoughts wander, he realizes he’s not really the person he was when he felt that way, and that Draco isn’t the person he despised so much, anymore. Throughout this strange eighth year, he’s seen a completely different side of Draco. He’s seen Draco remorseful, contrite, unassuming, repentant, humbled, and joyful. He thinks he likes the joy the best. That’s when he knows.
All right, Zabini was definitely attractive. Harry could admit that. He wasn’t sure he’d ever fully considered it before, but he wouldn’t say no to seeing what was underneath.
. Look, maybe it’s silly, but I don’t trust what she’s got stored up. But you, I trust you… Could you…”
Every errant thought seems to lead back to Draco, and it seems sillier and sillier to Harry as time goes on.
“I… Care, I do. All I could think when that bludger hit you in the head, when you lost consciousness and started to fall, was ‘Not him.’ Not from some ridiculous need to save people, not from needing to be a hero, it was just… You. Because I care about you.”
– anything could have happened. What if you hadn’t woken up? I was waiting for you to wake up.” Harry thought that was a pretty good answer. Draco went silent for a few moments, seeming to absorb Harry’s explanation.
only been two years, he thought, taking another gulp of coffee– “You’ve brought me nothing but joy. Sure, we fight sometimes, but my heart isn’t really in it – is yours? And even though you give me a headache sometimes – Hey, I know I’ve driven you to a headache potion once or twice too – I wouldn’t trade it for anything. Because when I look at you, when I hear your name, when I think of you, all I feel is the most intense… Joy. And that’s how I know. That it’s you.”
“I think – I think I’ve been slipped a love potion.” He gets out. Hermione rolls her eyes and sticks a quill between the pages of her open book, nearly slamming it shut.
He strains his ears for more, hearing nothing. He’s wishing he could open his eyes, but he’s turned toward Draco and presumably, Madam Pomfrey, and he doesn’t want to give himself away if she’s not thought to wake him. A few moments pass and he thinks he might be able to drift off again.
to Harry – Harry looked away quickly, which was just as well, as Hannah Abbot was quickly approaching.
“Well I’ve been slipped – something!” He cries in frustration. “Isn’t there a potion or spell or something, that could clear my system?”
Harry is staring into space after the goal is scored, but is startled, his eyes sliding into focus. He watches the incident in slow motion – Zacharias Smith has grabbed the beater’s bat, and, perhaps in a show of anger, bat the bludger at Draco, who is already hurtling away.
“Well it’s just…” Harry wasn’t quite sure where to begin, pausing slightly, but then the words began to flow a little more easily. “It’s just that since I’ve met you – er, r
just passed by, on the way to the opposite end of the table. Harry had asked Hermione to pass him a rasher of juice. He’d meant to say the juice and a rasher of bacon, but it hadn’t come out right. She’d looked at him and patted his shoulder, saying he should work on getting more sleep. He rather thought he would get more sleep if Malfoy would quit invading his dreams.
He looked across the library to where he knew Draco was sitting, and debated asking him. Ultimately he decided against it. He sighed, rolling up his scroll of parchment and packing away his things, feeling like he needed air.
Draco is completely unharmed – well, unharmed aside from the bludger to the head. Harry can’t stop the loop of the image of Draco falling limply from such a height behind his eyes.
met, I guess, everything started to feel – right. Life used to seem so hard – thinking back to all the places I’ve gone, and the people I’ve met – I drifted around just… Looking for something, something I didn’t even really know I was looking for. I tried not to let loneliness get to me, but I’m only human. There were days upon days, months, maybe even years, where I was just… Particularly sad.” He took a breath, and decided to light another cigarette. Draco’s eyes hadn’t strayed from his.
Playing chess with Ron – Harry’s thoughts wandered to how Draco must look at this very moment. He didn’t dare look, because Ron had already caught him twice and was giving him dirty looks. He knew Draco was engrossed in a book, and he wanted to know which. He could almost see Draco’s soft lips moving softly, soundlessly, as he had just seen moments ago.
He leaves his thoughts behind and returns to the present, where, in response to Slughorn’s question about whether Harry could give him one of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, he’s just said it could be used as a “cure for oven.”
He wasn’t absolutely sure that was legal either, but they were still behind a Fidelius, and he knew Draco well enough to know that he could be plied with such a springtime oasis.
form fitting but still gave Harry a bit of an idea of what lie underneath. He turned to follow Pansy to a corner where two armchairs sat, and Harry was provided with a glimpse of his backside.
Definitely a potion. He was sure he wouldn’t notice things like that if he weren’t under the influence of some potion.
He wanders the halls and his thoughts stray back to Draco. He thinks of going back to the library - he thinks there might be an alcove he could just pop into, close to where Draco’s sitting. Shocked at his own thoughts, he trudges very determinedly back to the common room.
Harry thought he heard the tiniest of sighs from Draco, and felt as though Draco had been holding in more than his breath. Harry almost thought Draco released a part of himself with it, as though he was letting go of something he’d held back for a long time.
“Anything, Harry!” She responds automatically, though narrows her eyes as though she’s regretting such an open offer.
He knows that he’s not really under the influence of anything. Hermione and Madam Pomfrey alike have guaranteed it. He’s not sure that he’s ready to accept that these feelings are entirely his own – He can’t imagine feeling this way about someone he despised so much, and for so long.
Slowly, so slowly – hands shaking, damn them – he slipped the ring onto Draco’s third finger. Rather presumptuous, he thought, but he was hedging his bets.
As the game begins, he sits up and starts to take notice of his surroundings. The teams are playing well, and he finds he wishes it was his turn to play this month.
He finds he’s having trouble focusing on anything and everything, from schoolwork, to dinner, to time with his friends…
Harry is full of courage when he tells Draco that’s not enough, and leans down to press their lips together. He smiles when Draco pulls him closer.
He thinks back to the time he’d been speaking to Hermione in the common room, and accidentally caught Draco’s eye as he approached, angling for the door, only for Harry to blurt out in response, “That’s terristic!” That earned him a few laughs, to his embarrassment. He groaned aloud at the memory.
“I should think that would be obvious. It’s clear he must care for you a great deal. Now, take this.” Harry hears her bustling about near Draco’s bed. He feels the bed shift a bit under his arms.
His eyes fell on Michael Corner. There was a bit of an odd history there he supposed – seeing as they’d had the same girlfriend, once. He could acknowledge that Corner was attractive, but as his eyes roved over Corner’s face, and form, nothing stood out to him. He guessed Corner didn’t really do anything for him.
“But even if I don’t always want to admit it,” Draco continued, “If I don’t say it… I’m glad we found our way here. I… I couldn’t imagine life without you here.” The look on Draco’s face was grudging, but beneath it, Harry could see trepidation, and hope.
Harry’s not sure where he went wrong, but as he approaches the pitch, he sees Draco hurtling around as he warms up, looking more attractive than he has a right to, a look of pure joy on his face. Harry almost turns around, but ultimately decides to take a seat in the stands. He lays down on the bench for a moment, staring up at the clouds.
What was more important was the fact that Malfoy had somehow wormed his way into Harry’s dreams. He wasn’t sure how, yet, but he was going to find out. They’re mostly innocuous, so it’s not the worst, he guesses.
“Go on,” Draco smirks. It’s a look so reminiscent of Draco’s younger self that Harry realizes he hasn’t seen in quite some time, though Harry’s response to it doesn’t really feel anything like it did when
It’s the only way he could explain all of this – His eyes lingering on the back of Malfoy’s neck in the Potions classroom – he’d thought about moving many times so he could no longer take advantage of the view his seat – Malfoy, graceful neck arched to peer down over the roots he was cutting, unassuming stance as he stood to bend over his potion, long, thin fingers clasped around an ostentatious quill as he scribbled a note into his potions book (not that Malfoys
It’s not a potion – Hermione’s immaculate Purging Potion seems to have no effect on his… Feelings, and she’s cross with him for questioning if there was anything wrong with it – but he knew there wasn’t, really. Just didn’t want to admit it to himself, but – he stops that thought in its tracks.
“Hermione… I need a favor.” He says in a rush, peering around the stacks to make sure he isn’t overheard.
And so, Harry figured this was as right a time as any. He pulled a small box from his pocket. He fumbled with it in his lap, finally getting it open, slipping something from it, and reaching for Draco’s hand.
He makes his way across the castle and heads out the doors, shutting his eyes and breathing deeply. When he opens them again, he notices a cluster of fifth year girls. A few are giggling. He turns on his heel and heads back inside.
He leaves Potions in a daze, and heads back to the common room. He sits for a while, lost in his thoughts, and doesn’t notice when Zabini and Parkinson come in. Parkinson is droning on in a tone that bars Harry from even considering eavesdropping, but he takes a moment to appraise Zabini’s face. He’s got a narrow one, but high cheekbones, a chiseled jawline, and a faint yet even dusting of hair about his jawline. Harry’s eyes drift downward to take in his neck, and chest, through his open robes, displaying an elegant shirt – Harry would call it a button up if it had buttons instead of a simply lacing up at the top, like a medieval tunic, or something – that wasn’t
He took another drag of his cigarette as his eyes landed on Draco. He shouldn’t have, but he stubbed it out on the saucer he’d been using. He was sure Draco thought he didn’t know how Draco felt about his smoking, but he could always tell when Draco was thinking about it – it was the tightening around his eyes, really, that gave him away. As though he was itching to comment, but holding back.
Turning left out of the library, he thinks Draco might have followed him out. He knows he saw a green scarf trailing behind him. He turns but it’s only a Slytherin from a lower year, with dark hair and decidedly
In the common room, he takes a seat on the small loveseat, trying not to think about what he might do if instead of observing Draco
Harry isn’t really sure he even understands why he’s dreaming of Malfoy. It doesn’t make sense that he sees him in his dreams, in all of these situations, some compromising, even. It’s not as if he’s interested in Malfoy in that way. He isn’t even sure he’s interested in blokes like that… Though… Now that he thinks back, he wonders if that might’ve explained his… ogling… of Oliver, in prior years.
Whatever it is, seems to be getting worse. Not only has Malfoy invaded his dreams, but he’s invaded his vision too. Harry can be looking down at his breakfast, staring down at a book, watching a quidditch match, and all the sudden he’s seeing visions of Malfoy… Alarmingly, and (mentally and physically) uncomfortably, he’s seeing Malfoy in various states of undress – clad only in quidditch trousers and gloves (jersey, cape, shin, knee and arm guards suspiciously missing – why would he be out on the quidditch pitch in such a state); in only a towel, drying off in the dormitory showers; or in his dressing gown as he returns to his room, legs bare as if he hasn’t got on his pyjamas underneath; alone in his room, eyes lidded, covered in a sheet but not much else, as far as Harry can tell - and he did… Look, that is.
Hadn’t wanted to help Harry pick out the Crup that was lazing at Draco’s feet – even though Harry assured him it would be staying at Grimmauld Place.
“Yes, well, if you’d ask a bit more nicely and stop shouting, I’d be glad to make it for you if you’re so insistent. It’s not that difficult a potion, and all of the ingredients will be in the student stores.”
It was exotic, and chaotic, but at the same time, Harry found it positively calming. He and Neville had put no small amount of work into it, so he hoped Draco found it calming as well. Harry rather thought he did, because it seemed as though whenever he was looking for Draco, the garden was where he could be found. Harry congratulated himself once more on the temporal charm he’d had such trouble casting, that granted his backyard garden eternal spring.
Harry gasps and calls out. Draco’s eyes lock on his, and he sees the moment Draco hears the telltale whistling of the quickly approaching bludger, and it’s all just too fast. The bludger has collided with Draco’s head, and Draco is falling, and he’s so high
He watches a bludger narrowly miss Morag McDougal as she attempts to score another point for the Thestrals. Draco is in her wake. She’s blocked by Keeper Zacharias Smith. Smith tosses the quaffle as far as he can, but it’s intercepted by a blur of a Chaser that is Megan Jones -  Harry swears she must be related to Gwenog Jones. Jones tosses the quaffle to Draco who dodges a bludger, opposing beater close behind, righting himself near the hoops, and scores a goal on a bewildered Smith. Smith swears loudly.
Harry takes this time to conjure a goblet and charm it full of water. He holds it up to Draco’s lips. Draco is a little surprised, and something else Harry can’t identify, but he drinks deeply.
Nevermind that Hermione swears Malfoy’s up to absolutely nothing. Just trying to get his NEWTs, like the rest of them… And something about a future Potions mastery…
Draco’s mouth had fallen open slightly, and he was nodding – if he’d been anyone else, Harry would’ve laughed at the expression – but then, the smile that graced Draco’s face was absolutely beatific, and Draco said the word he’d been waiting to hear.
He looked over to his coffee cup and found it was empty. A carafe floated nearby, courtesy of Kreacher. He reached out and poured himself another cup. Draco was still watching Harry, eyes pinched, so Harry spoke.
“How long…” Draco’s voice is hoarse. Harry wonders if she has gotten him any water. Draco clears his throat. “How long has he been here?”
His eyes slid over glowing toadstools, bioluminescent in all their glory; the green, red, and yellow muggle fern Harry and Neville had brought from New Zealand; the tiniest of babbling brooks – if he squinted he thought he could see the tadpoles – the curious willow with purple leaves that positively glowed on the full moon; an unassuming cluster of clover Harry hadn’t had the heart to pull up, damp with dew; the calla lilies, gleaming white and ethereal…
Theodore Nott looked startled at the implication of the gesture. He stepped forward hesitantly, gingerly taking the hand closer to him before bowing and placing the ghost of a kiss on the back of Malfoy’s hand. “T-thank you… I promise I will serve you with all that I have.”
“I just had dinner a couple of hours ago,” McGonagall declined. She gestured at the Hogwarts students. “They’re yours.”
“Confirmation would have been nice,” Hermione scowled. “So, Lord Tartaglia really is the former Eleventh Harbinger of the Fatui.”
It was clear that some sort of faux pas had been committed, when the Queen of Petra was only replied with the coldest glare from Kasha’s Maîtresse-en-titre’s arctic blue eyes.
By contrast, Draco himself had lost so much weight over the past two years his wrists were basically skin stretched over bones.
“House Greengrass practices pureblood customs devotedly, and they steered clear from the war,” Count Shacklebolt stated his rationale clearly.
“Oh, does Your Majesty not know?” Slughorn looked surprised. “Draco Malfoy has been betrothed to Lord Li Syaoran, the heir of House Li from the Kingdom of Han, since before he started schooling in Hogwarts. He’s surely accepted the idea of being married to another wizard.”
“Well…” Slughorn twitched, like he was suppressing his laughter. “Miss Parkinson certainly isn’t wrong… we are running out of suitable pureblood witches in Petra to ask for her hand…”
“I am deeply honoured that Your Majesty misses this old wizard and finds his skills useful. However, this old wizard is tired… This old wizard would like to return to retirement and live a quiet life…”
“Oh, do what you must, Your Majesty,” Viscount Cormac Mclaggen hollered. Harry had never quite liked the guy. “Lord Malfoy will entertain us plenty.”
Malfoy returned the smile. It was fond and genuine, like the smile he had returned Lord Li. “Thank you for coming, Theo. I need all the help I can get.”
She smiled at him like a grandmother would a dear grandson. “I have always believed that you have the courage to do what needs to be done.”
A lot of the delegations from Kasha looked alarmed. Some cutleries clanged as they were dropped onto the plates. Queen Maria Carolina paled, while a couple other guests from Kasha surreptitiously spat their food into their napkins.
“Stop,” Harry didn’t mean for things to get this far. He didn’t want to impart the impression that he truly didn’t trust his former Potions teacher. “There is no need, Horace.”
“It’s fine,” Harry took a seat, and his guests followed suit. “How are Lucius and Narcissa? Are they living well in Han?”
Harry clenched his fists. Again, he’d let the appropriate moment come to pass. If he insisted on expressing his gratitude now, Malfoy would just feel more uncomfortable.
“That place,” Harry shrugged “is a disincentive for me to return to finish my schooling, really.” He pursed his lips and bowed his head.
“I’m tired, Harry,” the Queen rested her hand on the visible bulge of her stomach, covered by the cascade of a cornflower blue wool dress. It was almost the end of her second trimester, if Harry tracked correctly. Pregnancy suited her; she was glowing most of the time he saw her.
“Didn’t know the Li’s are so eager,” Zabini tilted his head back. “But anyways, you’re only half right, Draco.”
The muggle-born in the room decided to rescue her friend. “You all have a conflict of interest,” she spoke to her in-laws in a soft, but firm voice.
Harry let his Scribe write an ordinary letter for Marcus Flint, not that much different from the letter he’d sent to the parents of pureblood daughters.
Lady McGonagall cleared her throat loudly, and it seemed to snap Ginny back into motion. “I apologise for my ignorance… I didn’t mean to be rude…” she gave a small bow with her head.
Malfoy pursed his lips to a white line. He turned to Harry to ask him questions. “Will divorce be allowed?”
Harry hung his head and looked down at the floor resolutely. He only stood and listened as the sound of several pairs of footsteps filled the air, followed by a loud bang of the doors closing.
Evidently, after only a couple of weeks since Draco Malfoy entered Harry’s court, more than a handful of conservative purebloods had begun showing up regularly in morning assemblies. Of course, Slughorn had moved to Vawella, the capital of Petra. The Greengrasses too had returned from Kasha, although Astoria remained there. They were just the beginning.
Slughorn appeared speechless, before he coughed to regain his composure. “I’m afraid Quentin’s sweetheart has important commitments for the next five years… And my niece, Roseline, her work in Kasha-” [3]
For the first time in his life, Harry learned that not only had he the rights to succeed the throne of the Kingdom of Petra… he also learned that magic existed, and that he was a wizard.
Molly and Ron, who’d rushed to the youngest Weasley’s bedside when they heard that she had collapsed, gasped. “My baby girl!” Molly teared. “My first grandchild will be from my youngest… oh my!”
Still, heartened by their apparently enduring betrothal, Draco ploughed on. “I kind of like that I have this nickname for you,” he spoke, his voice coming out softer than he expected.
, the thought brought a smile to his face. “I’ll escort you.” The King put down his glass and turned to his guests. “I apologise...”
“Long time no see, Great-Uncle-in-law,” Malfoy replied reverently, his head remaining bowed as the Han Chinese approached. “I am glad that you seem well.”
“And the reason I’m not wearing one is…” Daidouji tilted her head, her amicable mien unperturbed, “I can be considered what you call…ah, a Squib.”
Petra’s smartest witch of their generation sighed. “I couldn’t find out much about him other than that he married Guizhong Li, the older sister of the previous Marchioness, Ningguang Li, around fifty years ago. Before that, he was said to have worked at the prestigious Wangsheng Funeral Parlour. Lady Ningguang is the mother of the current Matriarch Yelan. Guizhong died fifteen years ago. The couple was childless. Zhongli stayed with House Li for about a few more years before he just…disappeared.”
“Rise,” Harry merely replied, “come here,” he beckoned the blonde to climb up the stairs. It was time to put the third throne, which had been placed onto the dais this morning and provoked a lot of interesting reactions, into good use. The court had not been this noisy since the very same blonde pureblood wizard dropped by with his prestigious former fiance in tow.
Harry twitched as the platinum blonde dropped to one knee and presented himself to the monarch in his court. The choker that marked him as carrying a child was too conspicuous. What an eyesore.
Malfoy’s face almost lost all colours. “It’s a difficult goal that may not be realised within our lifetime.”
More time passed. More conservative purebloods trickled back into Petra's court. The engagement party went on without a hitch. The guests, who were pleased that the pureblood traditions were appropriately included, had sung the praises of Malfoy, and by extension Harry. Ginny had looked unhappy in the weeks leading to the event and after. Harry and Ginny didn’t have much of an engagement, after all, let alone an engagement party. But she started to feel the baby kicking, and shortly thereafter Harry was spending most of his available free time kneeling by his wife’s side, with his hands pressed on her stomach and his lips against her skin, babbling nonsense to their baby.
Tonight, Harry just wasn’t in the mood. He simply sat on the edge of his bed and put on a pair of socks.
“What does the colour of the robes signify? And…” she hesitated a little, “if I may ask, why you are not wearing one?”
“Lady Lovegood, Lady Granger, Lord Zabini and Young Lord Nott, perhaps you’d like to join Great-uncle-in-law?” Malfoy shocked Harry with the question.
“No, Draco-” Li bravely wrapped his arms around the hissing and spitting blonde, despite the scratching and dangers of maiming. “My family has been so excited to welcome you as one of our Masters. Please, believe me-”
As the redhead was finishing his food, he made a show of looking out of the windows. “Zhongli xian sheng, it’s time to water the Glaze Lilies, don’t you think?”
The good news was, it was not Durmstrang's army that officially invaded Petra, but an independent army of fanatic former Death Eaters, led by a survivor of House Macnair who had managed to flee to Durmstrang at the end of the bloody war.
The widower returned his greeting with a wistful smile of her own, while Teddy remained asleep, his expression so innocent and carefree.
“Thank you so much, Count Slughorn. I know I can always trust you,” butter wouldn’t melt in Harry’s mouth.
“How’s your nephew?” The King asked pleasantly as he swirled the wine in his glass, “I remember he pursued your path as a Potions Master… He is living in Durmstrang, I believe?”
Almost everyone from Harry’s court looked back at their guests blankly, except the ancient Lord Binns, who used to teach Harry History of Magic in Hogwarts. He rose to his feet shakily and took a very deep bow, wrinkly hands leaning heavily on his cane. “Please forgive this feeble mind… I have turned forgetful with age… We sincerely apologize to the people of Kasha…”
Theodore Nott looked up. “How could you possibly be the one asking for forgiveness?” His dark blue eyes were dry, but his smile was watery.
For a moment, Harry was thrown back to the memory of Myrtle’s bathroom in sixth year, where Malfoy was also crying. Only this time, he wasn’t crying alone. He had Li.
Harry continued with small talk over tea for the next fifteen minutes or so. He could tell that with each second that passed, the blonde was becoming more and more unraveled. Halfway through the chat, his fiance had reached over to cover Malfoy’s pale hand with his own, his thumb rubbing over the blue veins below Malfoy’s knuckles. The smile Malfoy had returned him with was sincere.
Hence, Harry had rather assumed that the wizarding world’s attitude toward homosexuality would be that of, well, bigotry. And worse than Muggle’s.
Harry himself merely laughed when he first read the letter. Compared to all the double-speak and fake politeness used by the nobles, Parkinson’s reply was certainly refreshing. Luna looked amused as well as she read the letter, while Neville cringed.
Ginny still pouted, though she didn’t do it for long. She started to massage his shoulders, pressing the muscles which were tense. “How was the trip?”
The migraine behind Harry’s eyes threatened to overtake his whole head. The King gritted his teeth. “Tell Count Shacklebolt to assemble the war council. And tell Count Moody to start preparing provisions for the Aurors and Dumbledore’s Army.”
Malfoy turned to Li with a hopeful look in his eyes, but Harry could read between the lines better without the history of a relationship with the oriental wizard.
The young King looked up to see the wise old face of Headmistress McGonagall, his former Head of House in Hogwarts. Some of the older members of the Order also stood around him with concerned expressions on their faces. Harry caught sight of Fleur and Charlie, still seated at the table, and a little relief filled him.
It wasn’t outside the realm of possibility. Lord Igor Karkaroff, a well-known former Death Eater, had the confidence of the Durmstrang Royal Family, after all, and Cantankerus Nott had indeed transferred his son to the wizarding institute in the Durmstrang Kingdom at the start of the war and Theodore simply never came back to Petra. Many pureblood Houses who remained in Petra had also sent their heirs or spares abroad.
“Do you know, that out of all the wizarding communities all over the world, the Japanese community has the most harmonious relationship with the Muggles? This experience will help us learn something, don’t you think?” She smiled encouragingly.
“Why did you suddenly think of him, anyways?” Harry said dismissively. In any case, his gut feeling told him that Harry would be better off not meeting Draco Malfoy.
“Milord?” Harry wasn’t alarmed, but he was surprised when Zhongli placed his bare hands on top of Malfoy’s pregnant belly.
Something crossed McGonagall’s face. Something not entirely pleasant. “Well, you were the one who offered.”
Intelligent brown eyes observed the King with concern before the brown-haired woman rose to her feet to obey, but she was stopped. “Not you, Hermione. Luna and Neville too.”
The blonde shook his head stubbornly. “It’s because I’m pregnant with Syaoran’s child now, that we have to go now.”
Shacklebolt and Slughorn stilled. They turned to the conversation between the King and one of his closest advisors with interest.
Malfoy flinched at Harry’s casual use of the former tyrant’s name, but he obliged. “Yes. Quite a few Death Eaters never came back from that meeting as well.”
“How can I-” Slughorn had a knee-jerk reaction to deny what Harry said, “So many of my dear colleagues-”
“Your Majesty, House Li has a purpose for making the commitment to join with House Malfoy. It’s really hard for us to accept the turn of events…” the Han aristocrat spoke boldly.
Theodore Nott gingerly rose to his feet, holding his breath until nobody told him to get down again. “Shogun Oda Nobunaga was assassinated by Lord Mitsuhide Akechi,” he explained hurriedly.
Harry wondered how they were going to suffer through the awkwardness of sitting around waiting for one person to finish eating, but the redhead gobbled up his food quite quickly. It also helped that Zhongli never ran out of words to say.
There was a history there Harry knew not of. Malfoy had worked very hard indeed to endear them to Zhongli.
“The biggest threat to our peace is if the former Death Eaters who fled to Durmstrang manage to convince the Durmstrang Royal Family to invade us on the grounds of assisting the purebloods get back their lands,” Hermione went on. “With the deal, ‘Childe’ will alert us if he senses such disturbance from the horizon.”
“Then don’t do it!” She looked like she was going to cry. “Macnair was just a crazy fanatic! We managed to subdue his gang, didn’t we!?”
A callous hand wrapped around his and squeezed reassuringly, the bumps on his palm a reminder to Draco of how seriously Little Wolf practiced sword-fighting. “How are your Mother and Father?” Little Wolf’s voice was hesitant.
Silence enveloped the lavishly decorated drawing room before Slughorn sighed. “I do not feel safe,” he admitted in a small voice.
Harry had been disguised within an inch of his life and dropped into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he made more friends and honed his magical powers despite the fear and menace spread by Umbridge and the Carrows.
The proper thing to do was to let go of Malfoy’s hand, but young Nott only gripped that hand tighter. “I-I’m sorry. I know I don’t deserve forgiveness. I know I could have taken your place… and you wouldn’t have to be here. I-I know y-you’re fond of Syaoran, and he holds you dear, and-” his voice was breaking.
“You will have a more distant relationship with him than your relationship with Her Majesty, of course,” the Hand tried to persuade his King. Slughorn spoke the truth; they were hard-pressed to come up with even one more name of a suitable female candidate. “That’s fine. The Consort’s main job is to represent the conservative purebloods faction. You only need to be intimate with him maybe once… for consummation and an heir-”
“Do you think they will do nothing as we threaten their livelihoods!? Even cornered animals will attack for survival!”
Several lunar cycles passed, and Draco Malfoy returned to Petra’s Royal Castle with a choker around his neck.
“Parkinson’s comment on financial distress just reminded me of it,” Hermione looked guilty, “It seems the marriage is a terrible prospect to them too… We’ll need to use everything in our disposal to realise this plan. I’m not telling you to coerce him… I am just laying the cards on the table.”
“Anyways, Shacklebolt said I probably only have to sleep with my Consort once, for consummation and an heir-”
“Tim,” Francis said his chief mistress’ name with a warning in his tone, but the expression he had given Harry was very strained indeed. “I take it that the people of the Kingdom of Petra do not participate in the ritual of Attis and the ceremonies?” [2]
“I’m glad they’re to your taste,” Zhongli looked content as he sipped his tea. The beverage smelled faintly of lilies.
“Don’t worry, I’ll entertain them!” Tartaglia chimed in eagerly. “I’d like to know your relative as well!”
The things they went through together… the Sectumsempra curse, the blonde refusing to identify Harry when Harry was captured by the snatchers…
Malfoy put a gloved hand on his handkerchief, the other hand unconsciously resting on his stomach. “Yes,” he murmured absently.
“And you have done that,” Hermione remarked confidently. “That, and Draco’s Life Debt to you are two separate obligations. Am I not right?” She turned to Shacklebolt and Slughorn, who both nodded, the latter more enthusiastically.
But Malfoy didn’t budge. “Your Majesty, my understanding is that time is of the essence to reassure Petra’s divided population,” he explained logically. “I have gone through the necessary rituals to prepare my body to be a carrier since the betrothal between House Malfoy and House Li was committed. I am fully ready to carry a child to term now, while it will take Syaoran eighteen months at the very least, before he can even be pregnant. And once I marry you through pureblood marriage rituals, I can’t father his child.”
Draco recalled with startling clarity, a conversation between Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy he’d stumbled upon over a decade ago.
Life was miserable for the scrawny boy, scorned by his guardians and treated like a servant, often going cold and hungry. Sometimes, Harry himself didn’t know how he’d managed to survive those years.
Harry turned to find Hermione with her brows furrowed, and the Mahoutokoro’s Head Girl, her face arranged into a bland mask of politeness. “Did you take a wrong turn after coming back from the restroom?” her dark eyes twinkled mutely in amusement.
