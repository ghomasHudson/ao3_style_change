Blaise rolls his eyes, "You don't understand. He will never ever love me back. It's just some stupid feeling that's useless. It doesn't get me anywhere, especially when the feelings aren't reciprocated."
Myrtle takes her hand off his back and slowly floats off into the ceiling. Draco pulls his knees to his chest and starts sobbing again. He reaches for his left sleeve and pulls it up. He looks at his wrist for a while and Harry decides it would be a good time to come out.
Even if they made him feel crazy, it was the most amazing thing he has ever felt. He only felt this once, and it was with Blaise the day they went to Honeydukes together. What can it be? Is he just so touch starved that a simple touch like this makes him all weird?
Snape nodded, "Now suck it up and go back to where you came from. Don't worry about Dumbledore, I got that." Snape assured.
Ginny looks down with a heavy blush upon her cheeks and says, "Well at least I don't chew with my mouth open!"
"What do you mean?" Blaise asked. His 'innocence' was rather hysterical. He wasn't going to get away with this.
"Because it's impossible to be perfect," Myrtle says, "And that's what makes everything so beautiful. Besides, beauty is subjective and so is normal. Normal doesn't even exist in all reality. But, look on the bright side, at least you aren't me!"
"Can you hand me the rose thorns and moonstone?" Harry asks. Draco does exactly that and he gives him thanks.
"Because I loved him..." His grandmother smiles to herself, "I've been thinking a lot lately, especially about him and that boy you've been hanging around... I even had a chat about it at your father's grave... A thought came to me, as if your father was speaking to me. I realized just how messed up you had been and how heartbroken you looked when I told you you couldn't see him. A voice said to me, 'Let Neville see him.' I never though it was possible or natural for boys to love boys and girls to love girls... But the more I thought about it and the more I talked to my friends and family about it, the more I realized just how wrong I was. And that voice too kept ringing in my ears. Even though I am incredibly dissappointed with you sneaking out... I think I will allow you to see him again. If I know anything about my past... It seems like you love that boy and I can't take that away from you." His grandmother finishes.
He glanced beside him, noticing Blaise looking back from the side of his eyes, then quickly turning his attention back to the board. He really wishes Blaise would stop that. It must be some sort of joke, but he'd honestly rather have Blaise shout at him than inspecting him just to freak him out.
"Of course I don't. I can finally get it out to someone! It weighs down on you a lot when you hold it in for so long." Blaise says and Draco nods in agreement. "Ever since my father divorced my mother, my mother has refused to let him see me because he's some dangerous criminal or something. Although, I'm not sure if I trust her... she lies about everything. I've even caught her in a lie and she still lied to my face. Then this boyfriend comes into our lives and starts telling me what I can and can't do and telling my mother I'm doing stuff that I'm not. He once told her he found me in Knockturn Alley and she screamed at me for it for two days! She still believes him over me. As time went on she began to give him all he wants and ignoring me. He's the first to be taken care of and I'm expected to do everything myself. When he cries, my mother stops whatever she is going and runs right to him and tends to his every need. When I cry I'm told to suck it up, grow up and stop being a baby. I always felt so dull and lifeless. It felt like nothing could possibly make me happy again, not even playing on a broomstick or messing with a toy bludger. All the childhood wonder died ."
Neville walks back and plops down on the seat. The Slytherin has now gone. He takes a sip of his tea, yet it tastes strange. Perhaps it set out too long. He takes it to the bathroom and dumps the rest down the sink.
Draco still stood his ground, "Oh no, big bad golden boy's gonna hurt me! So scary!" He mocked. A couple of Slytherins giggled.
"I will answer that question another time. For now, I want to know more about these feelings. But first off I want to tell you that you didn't make things awkward and second, you shouldn't feel ashamed of liking boys. It's completely normal. My friend likes boys as well! I actually think I like both boys and girls. Either way, it's completely normal and you shouldn't be disgusted. It won't make things awkward to talk about this stuff with me at all. I mean, I really wished I had someone to vent to when I was thinking the same things. It's hard to do it alone, so I'm here to help you. Vent away, dear Neville."
"Hey Harry... I know this sounds stupid but go to McGonagall's office and ask for... essence of Lavender I think it is?" Blaise says. "And hurry, please."
"Right. Anyways, he said you kissed really nicely and he likes you a lot but he's afraid to talk to you after it." Pansy says.
"It's alright. I'm just worried about you. But I also came by to see if maybe we could go on a date?" Hannah asks, glancing from him to the table.
His father was many miles away, locked up in jail. No one could touch him here and he was safe, yet he was holding onto these rules like his life depended on it.
Blaise didn't even glance up at Harry but instead rolled his eyes and angrily ate his beans. "Ugh! Really?! Grass?!" Blaise exclaims.
"Thank you, Professor." Blaise smiles back and Dumbledore nods in response. He takes a deep breath and walks out the door.
But it only made the sound of someone shouting, "Woah!" Even more jarring. He nearly jumped out of his skin and Harry jumps away from him.
Suddenly Blaise stands up, asks Snape a question, then leaves the room. Neville simply shrugs it off until he notices that he doesn't come back at all.
They all rush towards her. Draco felt awkward having any physical contact with Hermione, but he still grabbed onto her jacket.
"You know what happened! Don't act like you don't know. You're Pansy's friend, after all, not to mention a Slytherin."
Harry pockets Draco's wand and takes out his own. He points it at Draco and says, "Finite Incantatem."
As if teasing Neville, Trevor croaked louder right in the same spot. Neville sighed once again and fell asleep exactly like that.
He catches glimpse of Blaise, who doesn't eat either, and instead continues to glance over at what Draco could only guess was the Gryffindor table.
"No one can harm you, Myrtle. You can hide away easily and not have to worry about your own father killing you for not being perfect in front of company. Or maybe worse, beating you brutally! You have an easy life if we're being logical here." Draco replies with a scowl.
"I was gonna say that... It was wrong for you to do that to Draco..." Blaise says quickly. "You should apologize."
Harry pulls Draco around to face him. Their chests are nearly touching. "Draco... Please talk to me. That's all I ask."
"Neville! I was wondering where you went! Blaise didn't hurt you or anything, right?" Hannah asks, holding her broomstick in hand.
"Ok, ok! Keep your voice down, temper tantrum." Pansy rolls her eyes and leans back in the chair. "Seriously though, why are you so upset. You never cared about this stuff before."
Neville's breathing gets heavier and more rapid. Without another word, Blaise grabs Neville and drags him out of the classroom. Neville could feel the eyes on him. It only made things worse.
He steps inside and stands in front of his father's desk, hands at his side and maintaining a good posture. He was taught this rule when he was six years old. Never ever have a bad posture, especially in public.
His voice cracks once more and tears begin to fall from his eyes. "People saw them! It has to be true!" He sits on the couch and holds his head in his hands, "I know I should be happy for him... I know I should it's just... Merlin, I'm so angry! I didn't even get a chance!" He sighs, "I hate Lovegood." He sneers.
Neville was shocked to find Harry sitting right on his old bed and staring blankly at a book in front of him, "Harry!"
"I speak to myself quite often, you should try it some time." Dumbledore says. Draco gives him a strange look. He's pointing a wand at him and all he does is speak to him like it's all normal. "Draco, you are no killer."
"Just... go back to the hospital wing... I need some space." Blaise says, walking away without another word.
"I dunno... Even if Blaise did care, he's the only one that would. But I can't just parade around him all the time for emotional support. That would be invasive." Draco says, "But I don't know who else to talk to about it all and how to make the thoughts stop. So I just hide away."
"I'm telling the truth! Look, I'll prove it to you. Next time Blaise is here I'll say it just so you'll see his reaction." Draco says.
"That's not all that happened today. I went out to you know... get away from Harry and well... I saw Neville. He was... sobbing. I tried to get his attention but he ran away as soon as he saw me. I don't know where he went. He certainly didn't go in the direction of the Gryffindor common room." Draco informs.
She had to get them together... but how? Veritaserum didn't work, but it sure did humiliate Neville. Speaking of... Everyone, especially in Slytherin house had been incredibly shocked when they saw Blaise and Neville all lovey-dovey. Everyone thought they were just friends, but not Pansy.
"Well, he seemed strange. He was breathing really heavy and seemed really upset. I was worried he'd start convulsing." Blaise explains.
"Mister Longbottom!" He heard Snape shout. His insides began to burn and sink down. Please don't do this. "You wouldn't be such a pathetic disgrace if you managed to pay attention!" Snape scolded.
"Uh... W-wh... I-" He grunts, "I'm an idiot!" He shouts at himself. Wait a minute, he only meant to think that! His breath hitches and he continues to hide his face.
"I've told you no many times. Now leave me alone." Draco felt fed up with all of them. He could never stand them, but his father would be upset if he were to break off those friendships. Of course, it's only because that's how his father keeps up his prestige. Without those connections, his family would be nothing. His father reminds him every single year.
"Who are you and what have you done with my boy?" Blaise asks. He looks to the side and Neville follows his gaze. There sat Luna, looking at them both in shock. "Are you seeing this?" Blaise asks her. She nods.
Before Neville could continue, Blaise grabs two packages of chocolate wands and a large lollipop. "Anything else, Mr. Longbottom?" Blaise says in a high-pitched voice.
"Uh... Gryffindor?" Neville asked nervously. Nothing happened. He whined in agony. If he didn't get in there, he was doomed. He was sure of it.
"Sure." Blaise says, handing the tray to the boy beside him while trying to wrap his brain around what he is advising him to do. Not yet? Is he saying that he should make something completely new? How in the world would he do that?
Let's be real here, Blaise and Malfoy would be great for each other! Both confident Slytherins with rich backgrounds. Not to mention Blaise most likely had a very good family. Draco wouldn't want him. He has just as bad of a family as Draco, if not worse.
"Pansy spiked his drink with veritaserum! Not only him, though, Neville as well! But it's not like you would care. I bet you're in on it." Harry sneers once more.
"Goyle... He's..." He breathes out. Draco stares at the ground. He always thought of Goyle as an insufferable, idiotic git but now that he was gone... He just couldn't believe it.
"Me neither... Hey, Neville, you got a date yet?" Seamus asks, a crooked smile plastered on his face.
"Because I like you." He slammed his hands on his mouth again and shook his head violently. He didn't mean to say that either.
Then, he realized that it was because that toast oddly enough make him feel included. It made him feel like he was apart of this perfect family that loved each other and maybe, if he was apart of it as well, they would all love him too. But that was unrealistic. They just formally met for the first time after he insulted all of them for years along with his father.
"Of course! It's the least I can do for two little love birds!" She smirks and struts away from him.
"You're opening up to me, right? There's nothing wrong with that. In fact, I welcome it. The thing of it is... I'd have to disagree with you. I've seen you do magic before and you are completely capable. Your wand just seems to fight against you a lot, but that isn't your fault. Seamus Finnigan always blew things up, but he's still skilled at magic! A part of the problem can simply be your nerves. Whenever I was angry or nervous my magic would always be more hard to control... You're wearing that bracelet today so... Perhaps try a spell?" Blaise suggests.
He bumps into someone on the way out. "Sorry!" He quickly shouts. He looks up to meet the eyes of Blaise Zabini. Oh no. His body goes stiff and his insides twist all around.
He grabs his fork and stabs it into the pie. He shovels the piece into his mouth and nods in approval.
"Come on, then!" Blaise interlocks their hands. The funny feeling comes back. Perhaps he was sick? No, that can't be right.
"Of course! We can go ahead and coat it in lavender to start off." Dumbledore steps away from his chair and goes up some steps across the room. Blaise can hear the opening and closing of drawers, but can no longer see the man.
Blaise smiles, "And that's enough for me." He stares at him for a few seconds, taking in his features, "You really are handsome, you know that right?" Blaise asks.
"Don't act like you don't know. I just wanted you to know I'm not after Neville. For one, I don't feel for him that way, and two, you have too many bargyles following you to do something so cruel to someone who loves so deeply." Luna smiles at him softly.
Draco's eyes soften and he gives the Professor a nod before walking out. 'He's just trying to get you on his side.' Draco tells himself, 'He wouldn't actually help you, no one would.'
"Yeah. I will. See you after lunch." Neville says, grabbing the letter back from Luna and walking off to the Great Hall. As he's walking he takes off his bracelet and puts it in his pocket. He wouldn't want Hannah asking questions.
As if on cue, Harry walks into the hospital wing. "Hey, I just told Hermione to get Neville down here. We need to get the potion out of his system."
Draco nods in response then the room goes silent once more. Draco debates in his head for a while on whether to ask the question, then he finally decides it would help. "What's wrong?"
"If you're wondering about Professor McGonagall, I'm sure she was thinking the same thing for you. Don't worry, just go relax." Dumbledore gave him a warm smile and gestured to the exit.
He sat at the Slytherin table alone, but in the perfect spot. This time Blaise wore all black, but it wasn't any less fashionable. The button-up shirt was once again tucked into his black pants and neither had a wrinkle in sight. He suddenly feel a bit inferior considering his shirt was heavily wrinkled and his hair was messy. However, everything Blaise did made him feel inferior.
"Really now?" His father says, glaring at Draco in anger. He grabs his wand and points it right at Draco. His heart races. He's going to die.
"Your hand is so soft." He blurts out, instantly embarrassed by his words. He could feel his face warm up and tries to keep a confident demeanor.
Hannah furrows her brows at him then continues to eat. Neville, however, just sits there and allows the image to burn into his brain. Oddly enough, it didn't bother him.
In the great hall, Draco didn't eat and instead observed. There was no possible way he could eat after what's happened in the past week. Knowing what he's going to have to do only soils his appetite.
He couldn't help but stand there, his heart pounding in his chest. He's not scared of Harry Potter, is he? No, Malfoy's never do that. The image of his bright green eyes and smirk pop into his head. He should be disgusted, but honestly, he's not. I kinda wish he kissed me. What the hell?!
"You really think it's any of your business?! News flash, Potter, you don't need to know everything. Not everyone is your friend who will tell you their life story."
Out of kindness, but possibly also stupidity, he grabs Blaise's things and carries them with him. Even though Blaise is terrible, everyone deserves kindness sometimes. He would want someone to do that for him. Although, he struggled to keep everything in hand.
"Yeah, it might. Maybe if he keeps talking to George he might feel a bit better." Harry says with a smile, "Him and Fred always made me feel better in bad times. Hopefully he can help Draco out. Maybe we can all become a family."
"I w-would love to go wi-with you." Neville responds with his heart doing persistent jumping jacks inside his chest.
Myrtle sighs, "I suppose you're right... But I'm still sad. I was made fun of a lot when I was alive, you know. People hit me a lot in school... And laughed and laughed at me."
He notices Blaise open his mouth, then close it back again. Then open his mouth once more, tilt towards Neville and whisper very softly, "Hey, uh... I never really thanked you for picking up my stuff yesterday."
"Goodness, Ronald, give it a rest! Ginny will do what she wants. She is practically grown now and you aren't her father!" Hermione scolds.
Neville stares at him and opens his mouth to say something, but is silent. "I'll prove it to you if you want." Blaise says, "I know your father is no longer around, your grandmother doesn't like to hug people... I uh... I don't know how else to prove it to you..." Blaise says.
All he had to do was get to Luna's house. But how? He needed a broom... Of course, his grandmother's old broom!
"Because apparently he thinks I did something bad... Or he just wants glory. That's all every Gryffindor wants."
"You won't regret it. Besides, you killed that snake. I'm sure you can take on this broom. Come on." Blaise says, gesturing for him to get on the broom. He does so, his nerves threatening to explode at any moment. Luckily enough, he had that life-saving bracelet on.
For whatever reason, as soon as he saw one of them carrying a box of Every Flavor Beans, an imagine of Blaise Zabini popped into his head and stayed there, as if there was some magnetic force connect his very brain to the imagine of him.
"A Patronus is a charm that is individual to and unique to everyone. It's used to drive away dementors and is conjured by remembering a very happy memory and saying 'Expecto Patronum'." Hermione says.
Apologize, Draco. You should apologize. He should, shouldn't he? No, that's weakness... But he didn't do anything. Right?
"Oh, great! Come on, Nev." Blaise says, grabbing Neville's hand in his own and walking towards the Great Hall, a smile never leaving his face.
"Yeah, I heard them talking! Pansy and some Xavier guy. They plan to humiliate them both! What a great friend you are!" Harry shouts.
Hunter shrugs, "A potion, maybe? Maybe you can make him a calming potion! I know you're pretty skilled at that kind of stuff, at least I've heard."
Once his father knows he failed something he'll be upset. Of course, he may try to help him, but then Draco would fail again and again and finally his father would get fed up and call him stupid and throw curses at him, seeing how he could dodge them. In the meanwhile, he calls him weak for not blocking the spells quick enough. He wants to be what his father wants: a perfect wizard who knows all the spells without having to be taught much, doing it with ease. He never will, though. This school teaches him nothing!
"Uh..." He looks around and notices them right on the bedside table. "Here you go." He says, handing them to her.
All Draco can do is fight the urge to hex everyone in the room and run off with Harry. To tell him he'll protect him and everything will be ok. Instead, he does the next best thing.
"Oh no! Neville that was supposed to come way later!" Blaise shouts. Suddenly, the cauldron explodes and the potion sprays all over the classroom. Luckily for them, the potion had no effect. However, they were all covered in smelly potion ingredients and so was their books.
He can hear Harry chuckle softly beside him. He looks over and Harry whispers, "This happens a lot. It's pretty fun to watch, but not to be in I'm sure."
"I mean... Even though I've seperated myself from everyone... I don't really think they'd care anyways. I mean, let's face it, no one cared about me until they heard about the situation with my father."
"No, I promise. I simply said that I needed to research self-harm for a friend. I never mentioned you I promise." Harry assures.
He instead stares at the book that was open on the table. The lesson was about Rowena Ravenclaw and Neville thought that, maybe if he'd listen it would be interesting. However, it's always hard to listen to Professor Binns's boring, monotone voice. That only made it harder to ignore Blaise.
She hesitantly leans towards him and kisses him on the cheek. "Bye, Neville." Hannah says happily and skips away.
Blaise's words ring in his ears. 'I love you' he hears. It felt amazing to hear those words. Every time he thought of them, it made him smile until his cheeks hurt.
"That reminds me! He also said how self-conscious he feels in potions because he can't measure things correctly and how worried he is about never finding a wife. How lame is that?"
"Neville?!" A familiar voice asks in surprise. A face suddenly comes into view. It was Blaise staring at him with wide eyes.
Luckily enough, he fell on his chest, but not on his face. He rolls over and stands up. He couldn't tell if the sick feeling he felt whirling around in his stomach was fear or excitement. Maybe both.
"What? You were what, Draco?! Afraid?! You know how ridiculous you sound?! How weak you sound?! You didn't even try to control how you spoke! You embarrassed me and your mother. How dare you?!" He whispers.
He notices Neville's eyes grow wide at something behind him. He turns around and notices a dementor coming right for them.
Draco reaches towards them both and hugs them close. They talked for a couple more minutes and then they both walked him to the Great Hall where many different people would talk to Draco.
He gets closer and can now see that it's Draco sitting on the floor, wiping his face with his hands and sobbing. Moaning Myrtle is floating above him with her hand on his back. His hair was messy and he was grabbing it in chunks angrily.
They go right into Diagon Alley and into a floo network. His father grabs the powder and says very clearly, and quite eerily, "Malfoy Manor."
"No, never. I never thought I'd even see you again." Blaise says, his voice cracking. He pulls away from Neville and looks into his eyes. "You have to go back home before your grandmother realizes you're gone."
Draco stand to his feet and gives Harry a scowl. "Are you serious?! Do you ever keep your nose out of anything?!"
Without another word, he rushes towards Ron and talks to him about, what he expects is the dinner. He watches their mouths move and soon enough Harry comes back to say:
Neville tapped his foot anxiously as he waited for potions class to start. He noticed McGonagall stepping in and speaking to Snape, who simply rolled his eyes and glanced at Neville. He hated that. Every time Snape looked at him he felt a sense of dread. He just had a feeling Snape wanted him dead. To be fair, he wanted himself dead too.
Neville gives a crooked smile and looks back over to Blaise. Blaise looks back and gives him a smirk.
A "Goodnight, Nev!" and a "Sleep well, Neville!" were heard from Seamus and Dean at the same time as Neville stalked up the steps and toward his dorm room.
"Blaise... Please let's get to the common room." Draco said, taking hold of Blaise's arm. He simply nods and they walk down to the dungeons.
"So... Uh, now that we're officially dating... I uh..." Blaise rubs the back of his neck and glances at the floor, "I thought we could go out together somewhere. I haven't really planned anything yet but uh... would you want to?" He winces slightly and waits for Neville's response.
"Severus." The Dark Lord says in a whisper-like voice while still managing to have his voice echo around the room. "Did you get me my information?"
"Harry... I uh, I think he needs to calm down before we take him anywhere. It might be bad for him if anyone sees him." Blaise says.
He opens it up and sees that it's the same cookies he had gotten from Luna the other day. Maybe Luna got this for him?
Blaise squeezes Neville's hand and snakes his arm around his waist. Neville blushes and his stomach does that funny feeling once more.
"I can't! If I keep quiet any longer I'll lose it all!" Blaise shouts. "How could... How..." He heard his voice crack and his breathing get heavy. Blaise was going to lose it for sure.
Blaise grunts and leaves the infirmary with Harry following slowly behind. He silently thanked Madame Pomfrey and made a mental note to himself to get revenge on Blaise. He knew exactly how to.
Draco rolls his eyes. "Give me a break!" He shouts again, his voice cracking from the volume. "I don't want your bloody help! I don't need it!"
"Yeah... She kinda confirmed that you liked me and I can't stop thinking about you and I really like you." Harry blurts out. "I'm not very good at this." He says with a nervous chuckle.
Professor McGonagall sighs. "Very well, take a seat." Harry and Draco take a seat beside each other. They managed to agree to transfigure a quill into a frog without making too much of a scene. The frog took a liking to Draco, so he decided to take it with him. By the end of the day, Draco had a pet frog named Aristotle and two full classes of not having to compete with the famous Harry Potter. He was actually quite happy.
"Y-yes?" Draco squeaked, making himself blush at how girly he sounded. What was going on with him?! Malfoy's don't do this thing!
"That's final, Mister Potter." She says sternly. "In fact, your belongings have already been moved to your room."
"Neville..." Hannah sighs, "You know Slytherin's are arrogant and rude. He'll just be mean if you do stuff like this. Seriously, I don't want you to get hurt. Just take it back."
"I'll go get the ingredients." As much as it bothered Blaise to leave Neville alone near a bunch of Slytherins, especially now, he was worried what would happen if he made Neville move from his seat.
"Well, we need to get out there. We need to go confront Snape! He can't just take over Hogwarts!" Hermione says.
He wanted it to fade, or even dissappear entirely, but it never did. Even if slicing up his arm didn't take it away, it sure made me feel better.
Neville steps closer and says softly, "Uh... I have this person that wants to be my friend but has a bad reputation... He kinda frightens me... I want to be his friend too but I'm worried it's all a joke..."
He scans the table and notices there's chicken legs, mashed potatoes, corn, crumpets, carrots, and even grapes.
"Yeah, good job!" Dean smiles at Neville widely and he reaches across the wooden table and into the jar filled with red and white circular peppermints, grabbing one and popping it into his mouth.
It was a month after the war and his family was called down for a hearing. His father had told him exactly what to say, but to be completely honest, he was so afraid he couldn't process anything being said to him.
"Not anymore, mate." Blaise says, rubbing his back softly and increasing his grip only slightly on his hug.
Harry chuckles, "You speak the truth, Malfoy. Although... Hermione's parents are pretty nice and my cousin actually apologized to me before the war. But my Aunt and Uncle... yeah they're repulsive."
He hid his friends well and they were kept safe for a long time until Harry showed up. He led him into the room of requirement and Fred, George, and Neville himself all greeted him happily.
she was his assistant, given that she was three years older than him. But, since he was the youngest Deputy Head of a department the Foundation had ever seen, he’d had to get used to people older than him deferring to him quite often, even when he didn’t want them to.
“I didn’t,” Kyle said. “Because the breakup was painful, obviously, but, more importantly, it brought up everything I had been avoiding dealing with before, about how things ended with Evan. I had a lot of shit to sort through, to tell you the truth.”
“I had wondered,” said Potter. His smile turned mischievous. “Or really, Francesca had wondered, and she told me about it. She’d thought she’d heard something about you being married, but then she noticed you weren’t wearing a ring.”
Potter laughed, a free, delighted sound, and tugged Draco closer again. “You got it exactly right.” He leaned in, his eyes flitting to Draco’s mouth with clear intentions, but Draco pressed lightly against his chest, stopping him.
When he approached Draco’s bedroom door and knocked, though, he heard Draco’s clear, strong voice immediately call, “Come in.” Harry opened the door to see a shirtless Draco standing near his four-poster bed, his arms crossed over his pale, bare chest.
“Great,” Vesper said with a genuine smile. They walked down Diagon Alley and found a pub that was quiet and mostly empty. Vesper ordered a double of Ogden’s and Hermione a glass of mead, and the two witches found a table in the corner.
And it had ended so abruptly, so unexpectedly, all because it turned out that Draco was in love with someone else the whole time and just in denial about it. And that was… well, it was pretty shitty, frankly. It made Kyle feel used, and he was
“Just mention it to her, Harry, that’s all,” Draco urged. “Just mention Blaise, and maybe ask what she thought of him, and would she maybe want to get together again next week.”
hungry, but he was content to have his son near, the small weight of him in his lap a comfort more than any food could be. Nothing felt more right than this. He bent his head, burying his nose in Scorpius’ hair a moment before giving him another kiss on the head. When he looked up, Harry was giving him a soft and knowing look.
He had considered asking Francesca for drinks, he really had. He’d had a fleeting thought about it, at least. But the idea had been… unpalatable, probably because he was so burnt out from a long week.
So when Harry brought her lunch on Friday as per their usual routine, she welcomed the distraction. As soon as he walked in she was struck by how cheerful he looked. He placed her salad and soup in front of her with particular gusto and sat down across from her, smiling all the while.
“It’s something I picked up from the Aurors, actually,” Potter replied. “They mainly used it to get blood out of clothing, but it works just as well for this.”
he knows what he likes,” said Harry. “But can we ever really know what’s good for us until we get it?”
The back of Harry’s neck prickled unpleasantly. This had flavors of the anti-Muggleborn policies that the Ministry implemented while under Voldemort’s control, only in the other direction. It was based in fear, suspicion, and prejudice.
“Oh, good.” Adam lingered a moment, eyes tracing over Harry. “Are you going to come back and join us, or…”
Potter tilted his chin and appeared to be considering the request, as if he wasn’t sure he would grant it.
Evan took a step back, ducked his head, and was silent for at least a minute. When he looked up again, his eyes were wet, much to Kyle’s shock. He rarely saw Evan cry.
Scorpius had silently disagreed, but had simply nodded. Dad-Draco was proud of him for many things, true, but Scorpius had seen the look of joy and triumph on his father’s face when his only son sat down at the Slytherin table for the first time. He could see it in his mind’s eye, his father looking down at him from his seat, clapping louder than anyone else. Scorpius knew what that meant.
The energy between them had changed drastically. Looking at Malfoy’s exquisite features, the elegant shape of his neck, and the masculine breadth of his shoulders, Harry couldn’t help but be reminded of his fantasies: images of Malfoy pressed against him, moaning his name in his ear. Harry’s eyes flitted to Malfoy’s mouth, and he found himself nearly panting.
Eventually, though she had no idea how much time had really passed, she opened her eyes again and stared at the clock. It was nearly two.
“Never said I wasn’t,” Draco grinned back. “All right, we have to walk away, or both of us are going to come away with a fancy new broom we don’t need.”
“Ah.” Right, Potter’s fluctuating roster of lovers. He’d nearly forgotten. “Wizard or Muggle, this time?”
“There’s no need to be anxious about it, Draco, honestly. It’s just for fun. If it doesn’t work and we don’t like it then we’ll move on. No harm done. I won’t be upset.”
“Cross?” Vesper asked him incredulously, doing a (maybe slightly exaggerated) impression of his English accent as she did. “I’m not fucking ‘cross.’ I’m
He sighed heavily, letting all the tension leave his shoulders, letting his breath smooth out and his tears naturally wane. He sat and breathed, and after a minute of that a sense of calm came over him, a heaviness that was more a comfort than a burden, like gravity, anchoring him there where he sat.
Kyle elbowed him playfully. “You know, I think the other houses should be nicer to Hufflepuff. All the Hufflepuffs I’ve met since I’ve been here have always been the most warm and welcoming of anyone. And yet it seems like they always got the shit end of the stick when they were in school, at least the way Hannah tells it.”
She had a name. It had taken quite a bit of doing, and more than a little luck. She's started in her parents' neighborhood, hoping to talk to some of the neighbors she knew personally (very carefully of course) about what they remembered of the accident and where it had originated. They remembered some details, it turned out, except of course the nature of the accident. Their memories had been modified to make them believe it had been a gas explosion in one of the houses.
“I’ll never know what I did to deserve this life with you, but I promise to never take it for granted. I promise to love you fully with every bit of myself for the rest of our very long lives. I promise to keep building with you, keep growing with you, keep learning with you. I promise to be the person you can always turn to, the person who makes a point to always know you best, to know what you need. I promise to put you - and our family - first, above all else. I know full well that life is unpredictable, and I’m sure it will throw more challenges our way. But I also know you’re the only one I’d want to face those challenges with, and I promise to always remember that. I love you.”
Then Harry talked about his birthdays, or lack thereof, and the way he was forced to watch while Dudley opened a mountain of presents on his own birthday. And he talked about the bullying from Dudley, and the way he kept other children from befriending Harry, and the way Vernon and Petunia told his teachers and neighbors he was a troublemaker, and was not to be trusted, which was further confirmed whenever Harry would do some accidental magic to protect himself.
“Madrid, but currently living in London. I’m on an exchange program with your ministry. I thought, for fun, I would learn some self-defense; I was always decent in school. Kemp says I have a lot of promise. He is encouraging me to enter competitions, when I am… how he says…? ‘Up to snuff.’”
,” he repeated, when she cocked a skeptical eyebrow at him. “We go to Hosgmeade together all the time. There’s no reason you can’t go with Kline - with Chance – this time. We can go with other people sometimes. It’s not like we’ll ever stop being friends or find other things to do together.”
Narcissa had been openly thrilled, actually. Draco had expected a pleased smile and an immediate getting down to the business of arranging it all. But his mother had laughed delightedly at first, and then actually become rather weepy, embracing and kissing Draco and Harry both and cradling their faces maternally while she told them how happy and proud she was. It was the most overt display of love Draco had ever seen her give Harry, and it warmed him, though Harry had clearly been a bit overwhelmed, or perhaps merely deeply moved. It was hard to tell in the moment, and he didn’t comment on it afterwards.
“I think it depends on you definition of bravery,” said Kyle. “You take a lot of risks in your work. You played Quidditch, which I think is fucking terrifying, if you want to know the truth.”
Dursley sighed. “Right.” He took a step back, taking some gloves out his pocket and putting them on. “Well, I tried.”
“I’ll make sure he understands if he crosses the line again he’s out. If he has any sense at all he’ll keep his mouth shut from now on.”
“We’re fine,” said Draco. When Pansy had gone to the bar he turned back to Hannah. “You women and your poncy drinks.”
Harry was blushing from his hairline down to his toenails by the end of it, and wished desperately that he had brought his invisibility cloak with him to the Great Hall that morning.
The tone of Draco’s voice made Harry open his eyes. “What is it?” he asked, eyeing his boyfriend, who looked at him with a serious expression. It made his heart sputter nervously to see it, though there was still warmth in Draco’s eyes as he brushed a hand through Harry’s hair.
Declan smiled. “You remind me of my sister, Bridget, a little. She was in a really bad marriage. Abusive. It took her a couple of years to figure it out, that she deserved better, but once she did… once she took charge of her own life, it was like she was a whole new person. She’s devoted her life to helping other women get out of bad situations. She turned her pain into something good, into something that helped people. I think that’s really admirable. Because… I mean, bad things happen, you know? We can’t avoid it.”
She looked at him, and for a moment Draco thought that he had gotten through, that he had guessed the right thing to say. But then she closed her eyes and said, softly, “But it’s my choice, right?”
“Does it bother you that I talked about you to them? I wanted someone to talk to, you know, and I couldn’t say anything to Ron and Hermione, because you and I had agreed that we would remain a secret. But I figured Paul and David are Muggles, and they already knew that we were together. So what was the harm?”
It was Harry’s turn to be silent. He was too bloody tired to think about all this at the moment, and he was annoyed at Draco for picking now to have the conversation.
Schoolwork had been piling up, and it was the worst week for it. Between the breakup with Ginny and the ever-growing fixation with Malfoy, Harry wasn’t getting much rest. Something had to change, and soon.
“That’s just it, though,” Harry interrupted. “I know what I want. Like I said, I want him. I want Draco. But that’s clearly not an option right now.”
“I won’t ask you to retell all of the events as they unfolded, Mr. Guensler,” she said, infusing her voice with calm authority. “I’m more interested in the nature of the accidental magic than the events that caused it. If we could focus on that, it would be very helpful.”
He glanced up at her, taking her in for a moment, his pale, freckled skin glowing in the muted light of the lamp. “It’s all right,” he said. “No worse for wear.”
Harry blushed redder, aware that half the table was looking at him. “I’m leaving for Malfoy Manor this afternoon for a visit, actually,” he said, turning to Andromeda. “Any advice on dealing with Narcissa?”
Hermione nodded. She could see that. Ron was steady, reliable. “He’s doing really well. He’s been following all of his instructions and the arm is healing nicely.”
He tore off a piece of his blueberry muffin and put it in his mouth, chewing while he thought that over. “Seems to me you
“Wow,” Draco said after he took his first sip of the ruby liquid. “That is delicious.” He was not very familiar with Italian wines, but after tasting this he was ready to learn a bit more. In fact, there were a number of things he wanted to learn from Harry. The list just kept growing.
“We should go out sometime,” Max said. He leaned in, his voice dropping conspiratorially. “There’s so much more to do in wizarding London than attend these stuffy parties.”
Potter rose out of his chair with a surprising amount of grace for someone who had just been yanked by the neck. Draco let the man get his bearings a second before he pulled on the tie again, bringing their mouths together.
He shifted in his chair. It was uncomfortable, recalling all those cruel words he had said. He even remembered trying to think them up, trying to formulate the most cutting insult, whatever would hurt the most. It was made all the more shameful by the way Ron and Hermione were talking now, the way they were practical, responsible with their money, the money they had earned themselves. The way they still had to worry, make sure they had enough to give their daughter the best life they could. Even with both of them working as hard as they did, contributing to the world in the way that they did, they still had to worry. It wasn’t right.
“You don’t have to just stand there,” Draco said, scooting over and making room for Harry in the bed.
Draco’d had every intention of practicing. He wasn’t about to go into a marital union at a disadvantage. Pansy felt much the same, though she only allowed him to go as far as oral when they were in school, given that they were only fifteen at the time. If it hadn’t been for the Dark Lord and the war, they might have gone farther in their final years. But with everything that happened it wasn’t until Pansy came for a visit during Draco’s post-war house arrest that the deal was finally sealed. It had been pleasurable, but mostly informative, and after a few more rounds they decided they were satisfied with the experience they had gained. Pansy went off to marry Theo, and Draco prepared for his union with Daphne.
She watched the band of merry chasers follow their quarry around the Malfoy ballroom for a few more minutes, then looked around to see if she could figure out where her future husband had wandered off to. She didn’t know what it was that always made her lose track of him at parties.
“Let’s see, Scorp,” said Harry. The boy opened his hands to reveal a small stone, white, with lines of shimmering gold running through it. “Wow, love. That’s beautiful. We’ll have to add it to your collection.”
Heaving a sigh, he set about collecting them, summoning each crayon until they were all in a manageable pile in the center of the room. Now it was a matter of getting them back in the box properly, a task that, as far as he knew, there wasn't a spell for. He got to his knees on the floor and starting gathering the crayons by the handful.
Harry narrowed his eyes, confused. “Why would you be upset? I imagine you would support her in a decision like that.”
Another hot tear scored down Harry’s cheek. “I haven’t been a boy since you tried to kill me seventeen years ago over the corpse of my dead mother.”
Ron scoffed. “Yeah, but that’s a formality, right? They’re probably polishing up your Order of Merlin right now. You’re the fucking Chosen One, mate. What are they going to do? Make you interview?”
He must have been doing a good job hiding it, though, because while Hermione and Ron kept hovering near him, they didn’t shared frightened, tense looks. They didn’t push him to explain. Hermione hugged him so fiercely he thought his ribs might crack and sobbed into his shoulder. Ron called him a stupid git for not saying anything but he cried too. To them, it was over. They didn’t ask why he’d gone to the forest on his own. Maybe they were too busy with their own grief to care. Maybe they didn’t want to know. Harry wasn’t sure he wanted them to know, either.
The onslaught of yellow and green flame glanced harmlessly up into the air, scoring the rock over their heads. Voldemort’s red eyes widened in fury and shock but before he could attack again three distinct curses bombarded him, one each sent by McGonagall, Slughorn, and Kingsley.
It was all important now. If his forced isolation in Grimmauld Place over the past few weeks had given him anything, it was the knowledge that he knew next to nothing about the magic inside him, the magic derived from Voldemort and his deaths, the magic that pumped through his veins with his blood.
Through the chaos a dark shape flew down from the sky and disappeared again into the cloud of smoke and wand-fire. Skidding to a halt before a group of centaurs stampeded over him, Harry swirled his wand in the air over his head and cried,
“Right.” He hadn’t even known there was a second dining room. “Of course. You don’t happen to remember what the plant needs, do you? Like…light or water or…”
It took him a moment to adjust, a strange sense of stepping through another barrier as he left Grimmauld Place overcoming him. The connection was still there, but it was like he’d set the house aside for the moment, freeing up his mind.
“Your hand,” Andromeda said, voice efficient and without inflection. “If you’re set on leaving, I’ll need to do a bit of preliminary healing to make sure the bones set correctly.”
Memories of Dudley sitting on his chest until he cried flickered through his trembling mind. He’d been so small, so much smaller—but he was different now. He wasn’t supposed to feel like this—
But that was the whole problem, wasn’t it? The board had been upended and he didn’t know anymore whose side he was supposed to be on.
The full weight of it didn’t register until he was pulling on his suit and robes for the last time. He’d bought a few more, again with Andromeda’s help, when he realized he didn’t want to have to clean the bloody things every night. She showed him a handy spell to smooth out the wrinkles too, to make him look less like a rumpled vagrant who collected plastic bags for fun. They were nicer too, and even he had to admit, there was a difference in the cut and the line of his body. He stared in his mirror as he adjusted his tie, smoothed down his simple grey jacket. His image doubled and shifted, reminding him unnervingly of the Mirror of Erised. He was Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, the Chosen One, the war hero, the person everyone kept expecting great things from—and then he was Harry, the kid who’d come out the other side of a war naive enough to think the world had changed.
In the brief span of time it took for Harry to shake himself out of the flashback, he caught only a few details of Goyle—long, lank hair, sunken skin, and a horrible burn mark all down the side of his face.
“I think we’re fine, Andromeda,” Bill said gently, giving Teddy a little pat on the head. “Really. You’ve done more than enough.”
His own eyes were dry the rest of the night. When he left the Burrow three days later, he hated how easy it was.
the book in which Hermione had found the process of making a horcrux. Sure enough, as Harry sorted through the books, mostly separating them into ones he could read and ones he couldn’t, he found a copy of the book nestled between another text with a long German title, and one which was unlabeled but gave off a faint heat whenever Harry touched it. Like it’d just been sitting outside in the sun or near a fire, like someone else had just been reading it.
Bellatrix shrieked as she managed to catch the edge of Draco’s sleeve on a lash of black fire. She grinned a rictus smile when more of his pale skin showed through the material, when blood began to soak through his shirt. “You were given everything,
Hermione kept prodding him as the Weasleys talked, concerned. She kept quiet, though, as if she knew Harry wasn’t going to share.
“Shall I go tell the new Minister that us poor, put-upon Slytherins don’t like being tagged and watched for a few months after a war that killed hundreds of muggleborns, perpetrated by our parents? How unreasonable, he’ll think. And I’m not even one of the others who can play the ignorance card. ”
“Do you really want to do this here? In front of a hundred reporters and the entire Ministry of Magic?”
Kreacher didn’t answer. He looked through the glass, pressing his hands on either side of his face and leaning in. He began to mumble under his breath, not the vaguely threatening gripes he’d enjoyed when Harry first met him, but a string of words, hard and consonant, quick like a fingernail tapping on stone.
Funny. He was eighteen now and he was only just starting to realize that he wanted nothing more than to never have to prove himself to anyone ever again.
“…Is Master wanting Kreacher to keep his letters? Master is getting a few every day, and Kreacher is putting them in a box…”
So much of what they’d been taught at Hogwarts was regulated and driven by concrete rules and procedures. But the spells they’d learned, the ones in their textbooks and taught by their professors—they had to have come from somewhere, and it was silly to think magic hadn’t changed over the centuries. Just like wands had been invented to allow easier control of magic, spells must have evolved to be more streamlined and easily reproducible. It was wild to think how one might trace the concept of a spell back to an original source, one ancient word or action or will, that unlocked this whole world for whoever that ancestor had been.
And there was a strange sense of urgency when he thought of marking the house, claiming it with his own blood. It felt…well, it felt rather stupid when he stopped to think about it. Stupid and troubling. If he’d heard of anyone else using blood magic to make their house more comfortable, he’d probably think they were dangerous and most definitely involved with the dark arts. That or they were just mental.
“You should set up a marquee, Potter,” Malfoy drawled, finally shifting to stare indolently down at him over the bridge of his sharp nose. “Charge a fee. Ten knuts for some hair, fifteen for a fingernail clipping, twenty for a quick tug on the old—”
He managed to transfigure the armoire a bit smaller, shifting it out of the way so he could make a little entrance for himself. The open area was a few yards square, the muted light of the grey morning outside giving it an almost cozy feel. Two sides were normal walls while the others were tightly-stacked books. Harry wondered if this hadn’t been some kind of sitting area in years past, noting scuff marks on the wooden floor which looked a bit like the legs of a chair had been dragged repeatedly across it. His gaze caught on the view outside the window. There was something odd about it, like everything had shifted slightly to the left, or something.
“I’ve heard good things, Mr. Potter. Very good things. After this nasty business is done, feel free to visit my office any time you like. We’re in need of fresh blood and you’ve got a few fans there already, as well as a personal recommendation from the Minister for Magic himself.” Robards didn’t smile but his face seemed to lose its stony edge. “Shacklebolt was one of the best aurors I ever trained. If he says you’re good, you must be extraordinary.”
The words were written in the same language as the rest of the book, only this time, they looked more like letters, letters Harry could recognize.
“Now, now, Bellatrix,” Voldemort said softly, his voice still liquid like the soft susurration of Nagini where she coiled at his feet, “exceptions might be made, and forgiven. The boy knows where he belongs. He knows his master. Don’t you, Draco?”
It was beautiful on the coast. The beach quiet and white and lonely but not in the way that made him sad. More like it filled him with an indescribable longing, the endless water and the soft susurration of the waves against the cliffs like a lullaby whose tune he couldn’t quite recall. He didn’t feel the need to pretend here, not like he had in the Burrow. He didn’t need to constantly present himself as being Okay and Fine.
Harry dropped his gaze, not really knowing how he felt about Kingsley’s being here and too keyed up to care. “Sure. That’s fine.”
Something brushed his cheek. A soft, gentle finger, catching the diamond tear which had slipped down Harry’s face.
Bill laughed, draping an arm around Harry’s shoulders and tugging him out toward the exit. “Oh, you crossed paths with Proulx, did you? Never met a man I’d like to punch more, let me tell you.”
“I said we’re not close,” Harry said, anger getting the better of him, half his mind still reeling from the idea that Malfoy would turn on his family and friends. “I’m not privy to his inner thoughts. All I can do is tell you that the kid I knew wouldn’t have turned on his family for anything, so whatever made him risk that is probably pretty damn important. I’m the last person who will sit here and defend the Malfoys, but I know that Draco and Narcissa both independently chose to save my life. So I don’t know if Draco is different, if the war changed him, but I would
Was murder justified if the man was a monster? Harry had thought so, he still did in theory, but the longer he lived as Voldemort’s killer, he wondered. He didn’t feel justified. Or vindicated, or relieved.
He took a deep breath, exhaled—and his mind went very quiet. He stared at the words, that impression of clean wind and lightness and relief from a great burden stirring under his nose. His fingers twitched again, like they were already mimicking the patterns he’d been practicing without any kind of intention, moving on the desk as he focused on the sheet. The words sat on the tip of his tongue, sounding them out in his mind like he was trying to remember a language he’d never learned. He saw again the tree in his mind—swaying in a sunny breeze, small cones dangling and jostling, clacking together softly amid the bright green leaves, the trunk splashed with faint white patches all along its length. It stood on a hill, one of—
The warmth he had always felt when he stayed at the Burrow seemed to dim every day. It didn’t feel like it used to. Safe and comforting. Like he had been given a gift he’d always wanted—a bright, warm house full of people who loved him, people he loved. Like he was living in the dream of someone else’s life.
“Here in the Ministry or here in the atrium? Funny, because I’m pretty sure he’s got as much right as anyone else to
Harry wondered what his boggart would look like now. Would it still be a dementor? Was he afraid of despair anymore? He had a feeling it’d be something a lot less simple now.
His mind flickered back on slowly, images slotting in as he thought through the last thing he remembered. Cleansing Grimmauld Place. The…
Harry shrugged. “It was pretty standard, and after a while I think they realized I didn’t have much to say. They asked me about Hogwarts kids today, mostly, which I didn’t know much about beyond…” He cleared his throat, trying not to think about Malfoy. “Just weird. They brought in people from outside Britain to help, you know.”
hadn’t pulled his attention to the door he was standing in front of. The door of the third floor bathroom, which he could already see had also decided to shift while he was asleep. The white tile was soft and luminous, no strangely threatening yellow stains along the edges, and there were towels hanging on a rack which had refused to lie straight the few times Harry had attempted to fix it. Now, it looked more than happy to stay in one place. The clawfoot tub, whose porcelain had been cracked and fixed along one side sloppily was whole, its feet a lovely blue now instead of rusted iron.
Better to just stop thinking about it, really, because he’d been through a lot recently, and he was allowed a few moments of lunacy. He’d earned them, with the kind of life he’d lived.
him, and he was asking the same unspoken question Harry had seen in his tired, red-rimmed eyes three months ago amongst the ruins of their school.
Predictably, he only slept a few scant minutes the night before he was summoned, leaving him feeling like a poorly buttered piece of toast.
Harry had never been good with feelings but this seemed pretty straight forward. He was in love or he wasn’t. He wanted her or he didn’t. And setting all of that aside, it was just sex. It shouldn’t have been this weird.
Part of him wondered if this wasn’t somehow his fault. He’d been mostly silent over the summer, stewing in his own despair and keeping to himself. Hermione, and Ron by extension, had been busy with their own lives. They were moving on, thinking about the future, making plans and
it. He didn’t hate Hermione, of course he didn’t, but she was standing there looking at him like he was a freak—and he hated that more than all the rest combined. Because she was supposed to understand. Because if anyone in this whole world knew him, it would be her.
Bill wasn’t bothering to hide his frustration and misgivings, but he looked resigned. “Were you planning on apparating to—”
“Mr. and Mrs. Bulstrode knew nothing about their daughter’s plans,” Robards continued. “They were put on a watch list of those suspected of harboring death eater sympathies after the war, but they were cleared shortly after the trials began. Millicent had apparently been distant of late, spending more and more time with friends outside of their home. Presumably, it was Gregory Goyle. They were understandably distraught when they were told what happened to her, and why. They also accepted the conclusion. No one else will be looking into this.”
“I don’t think anyone knows what Harry did that day. Albus might have. He told me what happened the night Voldemort returned but I don’t think it was anywhere near as powerful as what we saw. Albus said more than once that Harry was singularly equipped to fight Voldemort. Maybe this was what he was talking about.”
“I know you and him don’t get on,” Bill said carefully. “Frankly, I was predisposed to hate the little bastard from the start, but he’s been nothing but helpful all summer. It’s kind of annoying, actually. It’s like he gets a kick out of being accommodating just to buck our expectations. Well. Mine anyway.”
He still wasn’t sure what happened in the Forbidden Forest, when things had gone dark, and then viscerally, violently, white.
would turn out to learn the one secret he never could, to achieve the one thing he’d wanted more than anything.
Malfoy had always taken up as much space as he could, entering a room like it belonged to him, looking at other people with a benevolent smugness, like they should be happy he let them exist within his presence.
Bill’s warm hand closed over Harry’s knee. “You can’t do it all on your own, Harry,” he said quietly. “Not even you.”
Her gaze went distant. “I think it makes sense too. My parents—they were terrified when I finally told them what happened, after I…fixed them. They weren’t even mad about what I did, they just… I felt—god, Harry, I felt
“Let me wrap up your ribs, at least. Then I’ll get to work on something for your hand.” She frowned. “I’m pretty sure I still have some Skele-Gro left—”
There had to be a line between the lonely, frightening kid in the orphanage and the man who had killed Harry’s parents. He didn’t believe there had never been any saving Riddle. There had to be something human inside him which got smothered early in life. But it
His first step sent shockwaves through the golden dome. He heard the shouts of those outside through a filter of molten glass, saw the shadows move around him, but they couldn’t interfere, not anymore. No one else would die for him today.
Because he’d decided the moment he’d risen from the staircase after Ron had left that he needed to recast the Fidelius Charm on Grimmauld Place.
His fear and horror and resignation felt so far away now. All leeched from him sometime between the green light of the Killing Curse and the darkness of his own eyelids, all tucked away and hidden. Forgotten. He almost wished he was still scared. At least he would know how to deal with fear. This—hollow
A tightness settled into Malfoy’s face, a remoteness. Harry felt an echo of that weird desperation he’d felt in the aftermath of the Battle for Hogwarts, like he needed Malfoy to be angry and cross, like he needed the world to go back to the way it used to be when they were two people on opposite sides of a war that hadn’t yet started. When it was easier to remember who he was supposed to hate.
Harry tensed in Hagrid’s arms. The voice belonged to Narcissa Malfoy, who had greeted him on his return—or arrival, he couldn’t be sure—to the clearing where Voldemort had tried to kill him. Barely a whisper before, it was now calm and deep. It sounded like she was casting a spell in the horrible silence of the courtyard.
“Respectfully, my opinion doesn’t matter, Madam Yeats,” Hermione said after a long, long pause. “Furthermore, I wouldn’t wish to give my opinion if it did, because I don’t think I could give you one that was unbiased. I hope the Wizengamot will take everything they hear today into consideration when they come to their verdict, and not merely my personal—judgements.”
Harry knew this with the same resigned understanding he’d taken from Dumbledore’s office. Maybe another version of Harry would have trusted some twist of fate and luck to save him again. To let him walk away from this without blood on his hands. A better version would trust Dumbledore’s double-edged lessons about love and sacrifice, mercy and forgiveness. He would believe in the purity and power of an unbroken soul.
As if sensing Harry’s attention, he looked up, a surprising softness to his eyes. “Nymphadora asked you to be his godfather, didn’t she?”
Robards kept watching as the echo performed the same hand motion required for the Flippendo spell, and then produced a ghostly imitation of a Stunning Spell and Shield Charm.
Andromeda cupped his cheek again, just like she had a few weeks ago, and brushed her thumb over the falling tears. Her hand shook slightly against his face. “Let’s get you cleaned up, all right? Do you think you can walk?”
Malfoy looked at his watch, a sleek silver piece with black and gold threaded around the face, forming a delicate snake. “I only have seven minutes before I have to meet my nanny, and I don’t much look forward to getting reprimanded today. But sure. What do you need?”
He didn’t care how many mistakes Kingsley’d made. He didn’t care that his entire understanding of the man was built on the assumption that the people who knew what they were doing would never fail him. That if they tried, if they meant it, they would never let him down.
“Draco Malfoy has also been cooperating with the Aurors’ Office to search his family estate for powerful dark artifacts left over from Voldemort’s occupation, and to bring in any death eaters who fled after the final battle at Hogwarts.” Robards watched Harry’s reaction closely. “Based on your foreknowledge and current opinion of his motivations, would you characterize this aid as genuine?”
Harry said nothing for a long time. He saw in her eyes when the intensity shifted, when the last hope she’d been holding onto died.
Harry felt like the ground under him had shifted. It became, suddenly, painfully real, that he was being questioned about someone he’d murdered.
And if Millicent had wanted to kill him, she could have simply trailed him one day after he left the Ministry. She wouldn’t need to cast the Dissintegration of Morgan Le Fey, to put herself and so many other people in danger—and it’s not like they were trying to make a statement. As horrible as it would have been, it would have made more sense if Millicent was carrying out some terror attack. If she’d given a
The box was cool to his touch and smelled like spring. He traced the symbol at the base of the roots with his thumbnail, breathing in that fresh scent, reveling in the sense of being outside for the first time in days. Before he could stop himself, he opened the lid of the box. Sure enough, inside sat a book.
“But—,” he started, eyes burning, a heavy weight pressing down on his chest, “I—I killed someone, Bill. I can’t… I
“But we can’t say so out loud, is what you’re saying? We have the right to think what you’re doing is harsh and immoral but we can’t do anything about it. We can disagree, but only in private. Anything else is discouraged.”
He stepped into the lift. The grate slid shut. The pleasant female voice over his head announced the floors one by one, and as he looked up to pull the correct lever, his eyes caught on a pale face.
“Did you have anything else you needed Harry for?” Andromeda asked softly. He felt her eyes on his cheek, but he was still staring down at the fragments of his family he’d thought were gone forever. “I don’t mean to be rude, but—”
The longer he stared, actually, the more he came to be sure they weren’t wand movements, but finger and hand movements. The diagrams suddenly made much more sense as he recognized hands, arrows detailing which position flowed into the next, the twist of arms and palms directing energy of some kind, symbolized by more of that faint green ink.
“My pleasure,” Malfoy said flatly, giving Harry a strange look when he saw that Harry was still staring. To Bill, he said, “You should come by the Manor when you get a moment anyway. I think I figured out why that jewel box won’t open.”
He felt his disbelief, his anger, bleed into horror. His eyes burned as they stood in silence. His resolve crumpled and he took a step back, unable to stand near her.
Harry nodded. He didn’t feel any better, if anything Bill’s healing had cut through the shock and he was now feeling every place Goyle had punched him, had sunk his knife in, had caught the edge of Harry’s shield with a spell and ripped through him. His breathing grew unsteady as he tried not to devolve into racking sobs.
than them. We’re not supposed to treat them like they treated us or it’ll never end and all of this bullshit will keep happening! Kids will keep dying and breaking and no one will care! How can you not
Alarmed, he looked down. He nearly missed a small flicker of red light near that same groove. A line of red, faint enough he wouldn’t have noticed had he not been looking, ran quickly along the groove, shot off one small spark.
the same people who would kill him, or worse, if they won. He did more to win this war than anyone in the Wizengamot, but because of who he is and what he was forced to do you’ve decided point the finger at him, the easiest person you could find. He was forced to take the dark mark at
It took Harry a while to work past his surprise. Kreacher wanted time off? Obviously, he could have as much as he liked. Harry would have offered before this if he thought Kreacher was inclined to the idea.
Voldemort had been Tom Riddle once, the charming, charismatic, alluring young man who had persuaded the world to bend the knee before him.
He sat there until Kreacher arrived to call him down to dinner. When Harry got up he felt like part of his tattered, broken soul got snagged on Regulus’s notes as he left.
I SWEAR at some point this fic will stop being just a misery parade, like I have a lot of plans for it to be somewhat enjoyable, I swear, I just *looks at outline and sweats* you just gotta give me a little while to get to it
“Hey, Harry, sorry,” Bill said as he jogged over, grimacing. “Had a situation in one of the vaults we’ve—” He stopped, brow lifting as he spotted who was with Harry. “Oh. Wotcher, Draco.”
The silence around Harry shivered to a halt. For a moment there was utter nothing. The world shifted, like he’d been thrust onto a high-speed train while Harry remained motionless.
The new section he found had been hiding behind a huge armoire stuffed to the brim with field journals from an unnamed dragonologist. He’d been levitating the whole lot over to the
Or I’ve forgotten what he did to me, to you, for five fucking years? I haven’t. I remember all of it, every fucking day, and it’s
He’d searched for two days, sleeping little, until he’d found the hidden door to this underground place. Part of him thought the house had taken pity on him and shown him the way, which he took as a good thing. If the house liked him, and wanted him to cleanse it, maybe it’d step in before this…
“Sorry, Harry,” Bill said from the doorway, voice low. He sounded tired. “It’s better if we do this now, I think.”
“The important thing,” Percy said as they walked out into level nine, “is that you’re as thorough as you can be. You never know when some small detail might lead to a conviction, or a pardon.”
Robards sighed. “Gregory Goyle has no surviving immediate family. His mother—we think his mother took her own life shortly after the end of the war. We were able to notify his aunt in Germany of his death, but they weren’t close.” A pause. “She was satisfied with the results of the investigation, and will not be seeking any further answers.”
Bill looked around, making sure there was no one listening in, but the Leaky Cauldron was mostly empty now, only a group of witches in the corner who seemed sloshed out of their minds.
“I have to leave,” he murmured, his feet already pushing himself up from the couch. His legs protested and he winced, though most of his pain was still centered in his hand and chest. He wavered on a moment of vertigo, good hand reaching out for balance on the arm of the couch. “I can’t be here. Can’t—stay here. Not with—”
The courtyard rocked and erupted into a storm of shouting and dust. Harry lost sight of Malfoy in the center of the explosion when he was jerked to the side so hard he nearly lost his glasses. He rolled out of Hagrid’s hands in the chaos and pulled on his invisibility cloak. Without hesitation, he plunged forward into the crowd. He searched the center of the explosion, where Malfoy had— He must have known— Harry didn’t think it was enough to kill Voldemort but it would have killed anyone else.
“Because that’s so insane?” Harry shouted, finally letting his temper loose. “You ever think that maybe I’ve had enough of taking it all on me? Have you ever thought, after all this time, that maybe I’m done trying to be there for everyone else? Maybe I’d like to fucking
In between fevered scribblings on other sources he might consult, he had stopped to write out a short list of items Voldemort might have chosen to create his horcrux. Regulus hadn’t guessed that Voldemort might try to make more than one horcrux, the idea inconceivable even to Regulus, so his list was short. There was the locket and the diary, the latter of which had apparently been gifted to Regulus before Lucius Malfoy had taken ownership of it. A few more things Harry had never heard of—a selkie shroud which had belonged to Merope Gaunt’s mother, a pair of gold bands which had been a gift from Bellatrix. Regulus seemed to come to the same conclusion as Harry on these two—that Voldemort hadn’t cared about his grandmother or Bellatrix Lestrange. They were both meaningless to him. All he’d wanted was to prove he was better and more powerful than every other wizard alive. He wanted prestige and recognition. Not anything that reminded him he was just a sad little boy with no family, a man who refused to admit he was in any way weak like the people around him.
Harry stared at Robards, chest tight as he realized the old man would have known Tonks well, almost as well as Kingsley.
He wondered how long he could keep telling himself that before he gave up the ghost and accepted that
“I did, actually.” He wasn’t even lying. He’d closed the floo but he hadn’t known Kreacher was holding his mail. “I didn’t know you were trying to reach me.”
“Until then, I’d ask you to lay low and keep quiet.” The last Robards emphasized with a frown. “I’ll be blunt, Mr. Potter. Your penchant for honesty and transparency can only hurt you right now, and I don’t think I need to tell you that there are more than a few people at the Ministry who don’t think very well of you after your performance at the trials yesterday. The fewer people who know you were the target of two attempted murders last night, the safer you’ll be, and the easier it will be to carry out our work.”
He’d ripped his tie off the moment he got let out on the atrium, shrugged off his outer robes and sat down, and here he was nearly twenty minutes later. He checked his watch—the one Molly and Arthur had given him for his seventeenth which made him feel a bit sick with guilt—and exhaled slowly through his frustration. He still had thirty minutes until Bill was due to meet him.
Tears still tracking down his face, Harry felt a strange, confusing sorrow. The thing which had bound him to this man was gone, or…he thought it was gone. He could no longer feel it, like he had come up for air after drowning his whole life, only to find the air cold and unwelcoming. Empty, when it should have been filled with relief.
“Bleeding goblins,” Charlie muttered, still treating Harry to an oddly intent look. “I really can’t believe they haven’t been taken to court for that. Using dragons as guard dogs. Fucking monsters.”
been stupid, but he couldn’t argue with the results. His house liked him and that thing downstairs was gone. The whole feeling of Grimmauld Place had shifted overnight, or…over two nights, really. He didn’t regret that.
He clenched his hands into fists, desperately trying not to smash them into the mirror. The shattered glass instruments in Dumbledore’s office cut into his chest and he could barely breathe for wanting to break
A small trill rumbled in Fawkes’s throat, and he left. In a flash of fire and light, he flew out into the sky, disappearing behind a cloud bank on the other side of the lake.
An ugly resentment curled up inside him. He’d known the spell he’d cast was different. He shouldn’t be surprised at the reaction. He’d known how people would think he’d done something extraordinary and tell him so and expect him to thank them and be a good little prodigy.
Bill’s expression tightened, but he was clearly trying to be a comfort. He pressed a hand to Harry’s shoulder and squeezed.
Had he…meant to die with that last gambit? Before he’d seen Harry, was he surrendering, or…was he getting out, no matter what it cost him?
The slash of white disappeared behind a door. Harry ran, wanting to cry out but afraid that if he opened his mouth he wouldn’t be able to close it again. He’d drown in that oozing black. He held out his hand—white light seared into him, cracked his palm open.
Malfoy’s jaw clenched, feathering the muscles of his gaunt face. His nostrils flared and his throat worked. A glassy, horrible light burned in his eyes as they held Harry’s.
If he were the superstitious kind, it might have unnerved him. But what was one more scar, really? He had so many at this point, it kind of made sense. He wouldn’t be surprised if one day he looked down in the shower and found himself covered in them.
Kingsley turned from the window, walking out of Harry’s sight line. “So,” he started, his voice softer, “how’s our boy doing?”
He wouldn’t be surprised if they brought him in for something. A firm scolding, maybe, or some kind of public rejection of what he’d done. They had to see that getting the Famous Harry Potter to sign on to their agenda at this point was laughable. They’d probably just want him to go away, stay quiet, so they could move on.
Of course, it didn’t last. Harry had almost managed to convince himself he was feeling better, more like a person, when news came that sent a crack through his seaside life.
“I just—don’t like the way the Ministry seems to be handling this,” Harry waved his hand, unable to adequately convey what he meant, “this whole situation. It just seems harsh, that’s all.”
Nothing about its contents or why Regulus had deemed it worth including with the others. Harry frowned, wondering if Regulus had known about this second book. If the attic had been this chaotic when he was here, probably not.
Pain stabbed through his stomach just below his ribs. He wasn’t hearing any spells, how was Goyle managing to— He gasped, the wind knocked out of him as Goyle’s knee came down on his hip. Something fragile cracked. His vision blurred as involuntary tears leaked from his stinging eyes.
One of the other two, a beautiful black woman with sleek hair and a warm smile, offered her hand, her eyes a lovely dark brown. “Faye Lorelai Kamau, Mr. Potter.” Her deep, slow accent was unmistakably American and her robes were colorful without being ostentatious, the cut of them rather more sharp and masculine than those worn by British witches in the Ministry. “I’m an auror here on behalf of MACUSA, to help you all get back on your feet.” Her smile sweetened. Harry had the unhelpful thought that she reminded him of Fleur. She had that effortlessly beautiful charm that made you want to help with whatever she needed. Did America have veelas too, or was he just freaking out for no reason? He was definitely
“Don’t you have somewhere else you can go?” Harry asked sharply, hating that Malfoy’d got it in one. “Perhaps on another continent? I hear Hawaii is nice. There’s a few volcanoes you could throw yourself in.”
Blood magic was old and untaught at Hogwarts. He’d heard it mentioned once or twice by Snape in sixth year, but other than asides meant to make everyone feel like they knew nothing, Harry had assumed it was too dangerous to be taught to kids. This didn’t
Harry watched her gather up blood-stained cloths and a very empty vials, cleaning the floor with a wave of her wand before retreating to the kitchen. The sounds of her putting the kettle on seemed magnified in the sudden silence.
“You should tell someone about the cuffs,” Harry said, a bit more rough than he intended. “They’re barbaric.”
The problem was, after that, he had nothing else to do. He stood around for a few minutes in silence, his awareness of the empty house growing taut. He could try to find a book to read? Desperate times…
He laughed. “No. Not at all. It’s not an obligation. Really. Maybe I thought it would have been before I met the kid but he’s brilliant.” He wanted to hug her, or thank her, or—something. Their only connection was the little boy sleeping in the other room but he couldn’t help but feel like he could do more to comfort her. Like he owed it to Tonks, to Sirius, to Teddy, even. “I know what it’s like to grow up without a family. I don’t want Teddy to ever feel like that.”
He began to look at this attic as something closer to the Room of Requirement than a disorganized library, wandering through and letting his subconscious pick out books or scrolls or errant parchment from the whole jumbled mess. Most of them were written in another language or focused on a topic in which he had no interest. Copies of old grimoires by wizards and witches he’d never heard of, detailed family lineages for what seemed like every pureblood British, French, and German family going back a thousand years, books filled with diagrams of intricate and completely incomprehensible magical artifacts. He set aside the ones which looked mostly intact, placing the rest in a pile to go through later to see if there was anything worth salvaging amidst the mold and dust, the books whose ink had faded so long ago all that was left was a faint indentation of words. He didn’t have a chance in the world of understanding the last, but he wanted to keep them, just in case. They seemed too valuable to just discard off hand.
“Don’t worry about your adoring fans, by the way,” Malfoy added, the tone arch and artificial. “Just keep scowling like that and people will stop coming up to ask you to kiss their babies. Golden Boys aren’t nearly as attractive when they’re not eager for the attention.”
Harry watched him in alarm, mind spinning off in a slew of confusing tangents—and then he saw the metal ring around Malfoy’s ankle. He stared for what felt like a long time, not understanding at first. Some part of him was trying to figure out why Malfoy was showing him his bare ankle, if it was some kind of power play or method of distraction, until it clicked. A chill sank into the pit of his stomach.
Harry came to a stop and stared at the ground, the obvious answer floating up like an innocent cloud.
Harry hadn’t seen much of Percy that summer. Once at Fred’s funeral and then again one night when George had forced him to join them all for a drink. He still didn’t know quite how to feel about Percy but he was glad Percy seemed just as uncomfortable as he was.
Under his right hand, where his fingers had been absently moving, tracing along the table, a small circle stood out. Inside, there sat a patch of gleaming, freshly cleaned wood. Where the rest of the table was worn and scuffed, covered in the remnants of countless layers of ink and damage, the circle was clear, the wood under all of it a deep, dark reddish brown.
Harry thought for a moment the woman might start shrieking at him, but she merely drew herself up and huffed.
His mouth opened but his mind had been wiped blank. He wet his lips. “He’s—informing? Helping you, I mean?”
“Are his parents…?” Harry realized suddenly that he had no idea what happened to Malfoy and his parents after he’d apparated away. He’d assumed they’d been brought in to the Ministry, but it’s not like he checked.
Later, when he was lying awake in Ron’s room, staring at the Chudley Canons poster stuck to the slanting wall over his head and trying not to hear the small, soft sounds of crying a few floors below, he wondered if he wasn’t the smallest, most pathetic excuse for human being who had ever lived.
Something slithered up and around his neck. It was long and rough—different from the hands roving over his chest. His mouth fell open, gasping for air, moaning—something slid past his lips and his eyes rolled back into his head. It was in his throat, thick and cold, choking. He couldn’t think now. He couldn’t breathe and he didn’t want to, he wanted this, he wanted to sink down so deep nothing and no one could ever find him again. He wanted it to end. Oh, god, did he want
Harry’s brow lifted and he made a show of looking down at his watch. “It’s ten to. Pretty sure he can walk on his own to the lift. Won’t take him more than a minute. Think you might be a bit too keen on punctuality, mate.”
Robards hummed low in thought. “We have reason to believe that Goyle was under the effect of some kind of toxin or substance which enhances certain abilities. We’ve still got people identifying it, but it might explain his heightened strength and his mania. We’re not sure, yet, but our working theory is it’s a concoction meant to mimic the effects of lycanthropy. In a small way, of course.”
The only thing waiting for him would be the image of Goyle’s blank, twisted face. And though he couldn’t remember what he’d dreamed about last night, he didn’t think his subconscious would be gentle with him this time. It hadn’t been nice, whatever it was. Or…not entirely.
“Wizards are known to produce inexplicable magic when they’re pressed,” Kamau said softly. “It’s not ridiculous to say you performed wandless magic in a state of panic, when your life was on the line. It’s instinctual.”
Harry choked on a sob and turned, trying to dislodge the thing working its way up his throat. He clutched both sides of the sink, knuckles white. His head dropped as he shook with the effort of holding back a scream.
He tried to focus, every breath bringing with it another shock of pain. He couldn’t apparate. He could barely manage a spell. He needed to let someone know, but who…
justification. “I…had a suspicion Malfoy—ah, Draco, had been accepted by Voldemort between our fifth and sixth year and made a fully fledged death eater, due to—my own observations.”
“Ms. Bulstrode managed to confess one thing,” Robards said gently. “She was working with Mr. Goyle, or they were somehow allied, however it seems the curse not only works on a physical level, but a mental one as well. She had a few lucid hours after being stabilized at St. Mungo’s, but it became clear quickly that her mind was deteriorating, fast. By the time I arrived to question her myself, she was confused, rambling. She couldn’t remember her own name, let alone what her motivations were or if anyone else was involved. The healers don’t expect her to regain any cognitive control or lucidity, due to the nature of the curse.”
Did Goyle even have any family left? His father’d been a death eater, but as far as he knew, Goyle Sr. had died sometime before the Battle of Hogwarts. What about his mother? He had one, presumably. The thought of Goyle’s nameless mother sitting in a cold, dark house, waiting for her son to return—
Harry’s pulse quickened as he found himself leaning in as well, a hook somewhere deep inside him pulling him forward—toward Riddle, the handsome, charming, utterly captivating boy who seemed centuries away from the monster who’d killed Harry’s parents. Here, he was the same age as Harry. Eighteen and vital, confident to his core. Slender and tall, all neat black and white lines and angles which sat gracefully on his handsome face.
“This is the same Ministry who launched a moderately successful misinformation campaign against you for an entire year,” Malfoy said simply, frowning, “the same Ministry who caved, with very little struggle, to—Voldemort.”
Right away Harry regretted the words. They weren’t true. Malfoy had done plenty of things which were good. He’d stopped himself killing Dumbledore, he’d saved Harry, twice.
The unreality of it slammed down on him as he sat in the growing dark. Goyle had been wanted for his suspected murder of three muggles immediately following the Battle at Hogwarts. Unlike some of the other death eaters or students who’d fought with them, he’d fled. At the time Harry had thought it made no sense that Malfoy had stayed behind and Goyle had left without him.
The moment Harry stood up, he felt dizzy, his legs protesting something fierce, his body hunched and refusing to straighten out.
Where the two wands met, sparks flew thirty feet into the air. Voldemort’s lance of death-green dark magic rippled and bled, spitting huge licks onto the ground, every bit as nauseating and powerful as it had been in the graveyard where Harry had first seen the ghosts of his parents. It warped the air and sizzled where it melted stone, illuminated that horrible, waxy face so Harry could see all of him.
“I heard,” Hermione said. “It makes sense. The International Confederation of Wizards usually offers aid to countries after a war.”
“Think I couldn’t find you,” Goyle spat on his face, his hot, rank breath making Harry flinch as he tried to shove him off. His chest was pounding as he grew increasingly panicked at the lack of breath. “You take
Before he’d killed Voldemort, that life was one of the only things which kept him going. Now it just seemed like one of the many things built on top of shifting sands, washing away with the sea.
He found a potions book focusing on Eastern European recipes and ingredients, outlining the history behind each potion and the more notable potioneers. Under a pile of decaying newspapers, the charms on the front long gone dead so the images were stationary, he found a box which contained three books bound in white leather, with embossed engravings of an eye, an ear, and a mouth, respectively. The first two he recognized the moment he opened the books—tomes on the study of Occlumency and Legilimency. The third he’d never heard of—Potensimency. Presumably it was related to manipulating the mind and thoughts of either yourself or someone else, but he didn’t bother sitting down to read more than a few pages. He’d never been able to do the other two, so he figured this would be beyond him as well. He kept them, though, in the growing pile of books on the small table just inside the attic, next to the history books and the books on magical artifacts and, to his continuing shame, the old erotica. Out of curiosity, presumably. Sure.
He had tried not to stick to type, if only to avoid torturing himself. Tan brunets with light eyes were all well and good, but beauty had many forms, and Draco had explored that as much as he could. Skin tones, body types, hair color, eye color. He’d had a good sampling thus far. But he did occasionally find himself in bed with a bloke who looked vaguely like Harry, and he almost always regretted it in the morning.
Draco shrugged, feeling strange and awkward, like he was suddenly on display. “I don’t know. I guess because I’ve been wondering how you felt about it. About children, I mean. And we hadn’t talked…”
Angelina scoffed and tossed another ball of parchment his way, which hit him in the arm. “Of course I do,” she said, and then added, fondly, for good measure, “Idiot.”
“Can we talk, please?” he said. He was within a few feet of her now, and it seemed she was at least willing to stay put, for now. “It’s about the match tomorrow.”
“You know, Teddy,” Draco said, once Pipsy had scurried to the kitchen and out of sight. “I think you are Pipsy’s most favorite person she’s ever known.”
“No, you’re not,” she replied, shoving him playfully. “Now, go. Before Kyle comes to his senses and realizes how ridiculously high maintenance you are.”
Eventually Francesca declared herself tired and ready to call it a night. She eyed Longbottom hopefully, perhaps expecting him to offer to walk her back up to the castle. But Longbottom had just ordered another drink and seemed content to stay out a bit longer.
“So. I believe you mentioned something about seeing me naked. And something about me receiving oral sex. Still interested?”
Harry knew Draco was determined to handle things on his own, without the help of the Ministry or any Aurors, but Harry wasn’t going to let up completely on solving the problem. He had written to Kingsley Shacklebolt the afternoon after Draco’s attack and throughout the weekend was eagerly anticipating the reply.
Most Healers his year had not yet chosen a specialty. Strictly speaking, they weren’t supposed to. He was only a couple of months into his second year of residency, and he was kept on a strict schedule that rotated him through each department evenly. Or, at least, that was how it was supposed to work. After their first year Junior Healers could be specially requested by Senior Healers for certain cases, and Iwu did that with Draco quite frequently. It pleased Draco to no end, and became one of the many items on the list of reasons he essentially worshipped the ground she walked on.
“You do, Draco,” Harry said. He turned back to the blond, his expression sober despite all the whiskey he’d been drinking. “Why else would you be talking about pegging being emasculating, unless you somehow believe that it’s only men who should be doing the penetrating, and women are just supposed to be submissive and take it? Not that I know from direct experience, but hetero sex is as diverse as gay sex, and men and women both can have all kinds of interests and tastes that don’t threaten their masculinity or femininity or whatever genderized bullshit you want to project onto them.”
He made his way down the hall, back towards his office, thinking of Clint and how proud he would be that his advice had worked out. Kyle couldn’t wait to tell him about it.
Harry nodded knowingly. He had heard similar complaints from Fleur and Audrey. “Still, it’s almost here. You’re planning to take that maternity leave?”
That actually helped a little, although Harry mostly was able to find some energy and focus imagining his opponent was Kemp, so he could hex the living daylights out of him.
“He was ashamed,” Vesper said simply. “Not of Chloe,” she added, when she saw the look on Harry’s face. “Not of the fact that his wife was a Squib. He was ashamed because he couldn’t save her. He couldn’t make her better, he couldn’t save their daughter… he felt like he had failed her in every way.”
She joined Harry in the bathroom while Teddy took his bath, chatting about this and that while the boy played with his toy ships in the water. When he was all clean Harry wrapped him in a towel and rubbed him down, then set to persuading him into his pajamas. By the time all was said and done, Teddy was yawning, and Vesper wondered if they would even make it through a whole story before he drifted off to sleep.
“And?” Draco asked, suddenly much more excited. The fact that Neville and one of his apprentices had managed to get their hands on a few miniature Pearl Tree specimens over the summer had only made the man grow in Draco’s esteem. And they already got on pretty well, considering their shared passions.
“I keep thinking about a metal circle, like a template you would use to cut biscuits. It would have to be very sharp in order to cut through flesh like that.”
And he was absolutely mad for Draco. Absolutely, unabashedly smitten. And Draco liked that quite a bit.
Plus she needed a few extra minutes, on top of her usual routine, because she wasn’t even in her own bed. She needed to get up, go home, grab her trainee uniform, and scarf down some breakfast. She
“She thought maybe you’d left. But I saw you go out the back doors as if you were coming this way, and I didn’t see you come back, so I figured you were still out here.”
“What were you reading?” Draco asked, coming into the room and taking a place next to Harry in the bed.
Hermione stared at him. They were dramatic words, yet, in that moment, with how wrung out she was, how utterly
“I think it will. And if it doesn’t, oh well. She’ll be put out and we'll just have to deal with it.”
“Or,” he said, infusing his voice with authority. “You could be a good boy and do exactly what I tell you.”
“You still are, Harry.” Draco brushed a hand through Harry’s hair, and it took all of Harry’s willpower to remain where he was, and not move closer to Draco. Handholding was one thing, but this was another level of intimacy altogether, and it was nearly unbearable, knowing he couldn’t take what he wanted.
They picked up their pints and went over to join their fellow trainees, where they were met with enthusiasm.
She hadn’t known then what would transpire only a couple of weeks later, and of course by then Ron had already set the party preparations in motion, recruiting Molly and Fleur to do the food and sending out all the invitations. It was all already underway, and Hermione knew it wouldn’t do to cancel.
Harry ran a finger across Draco’s forehead, brushing along the edge of his fringe before descending down the side of his cheek. Even twisted in guilt Draco’s face had an ethereal beauty to it that made Harry ache, made him feel homesick even when he was right there, touching him.
But we have a little while to wait on that, so for the time being, I hope you enjoy this update on Vesper's life.
He lay there, still, listening. The only sounds were the ticking of Harry’s grandfather clock and the brunet’s soft, even breath behind him. He was safe. Everything was fine.
Victoire was running around the sitting room, squealing with delight while her uncle Ron chased her, arms outstretched, growling, “I’m gonna getcha!” All the while little Dominique screeched and tried to catch up, though crawling was currently her only mode of self-transport and she wasn’t making much headway.
“Thanks.” He realized the tech’s small talk had effectively distracted him, which he supposed was maybe the point. He found himself suddenly flush with a certain amount of gratitude for the man. “I’m realizing I didn’t catch your name.”
“Suck on my bollocks,” he instructed, knowing that once Harry put the actual cock in his mouth, this wasn’t going to last much longer. “Suck one, getting it nice and wet, and then do the other.”
“No, he takes off and gives me my privacy, if I have a guest. But he doesn’t want to watch that anyway.”
Draco smiled. “I like her. She’s good for Dudley. And it’s clear she’s a good friend to you as well.”
She put a hand on his arm, lightly but suggestively, and leaned in. “That’s good to hear, Harry. I wouldn’t want to see you hurt. I hope you find you’re able to… move on quickly. Just know that if you need me, I’m here for you.”
He sighed, finally, seeming to accept the inevitable. “It’s just that… I thought things were one way, but it’s starting to seem that they are, in fact, another.”
“At first it was about something our friends had done, a situation they were in, I guess. It was a bit of a mess and Draco and I were talking about it, and we had different opinions on the issue, and suddenly…”
. He’d warded the corridor so no one could pass through this way. Draco could feel the barrier pushing on him, encouraging him to back away.
“Sorry,” he huffed, getting control of himself. “Sorry, I’m not laughing at you, I’m laughing because… all right… well… maybe I’m laughing at you a little.” Draco made a move to go, but paused when Potter spoke again. “But only because the idea that you would need
Draco laughed. “You see, this is why I resisted getting a boyfriend. You’re going to be a bad influence on me. My marks will plummet.”
Draco didn’t know it could be like this: no words, just feeling, but he was happy to go with it, happy to explore as he was being explored. The chest in front of him was smooth and hairless, and with the sweat and heat of the club his hands slipped across the skin easily, learning the masculine ridges by touch.
Changes were slow, however, and he hardly needed the map on a daily basis to find his way around. On the other hand, it was dead useful for tracking the whereabouts of other people, as he was doing now. He usually used it to find someone he was looking for: a friend, maybe Marissa on occasion, or one of his dads if they weren’t in their usual haunts.
“All right.” He took a deep breath, then pulled the shrunk box out of his pocket. After discreetly casting a privacy charm so no Muggles would look their way, he enlarged the box before handing it to Harry.
“Oi, hold on,” she said to the two men. “I have to get in on this.” She nudge Hannah to move her seat, and Kyle was ignored when he offered her his.
“We’re a family here,” she said. “You know that full well. Professionalism is all well and good but my hope is that you will welcome him openly. My hope is that you will show him kindness. Merlin knows he…” She trailed off, closing her eyes, and Harry had to wonder what she wasn’t saying. “It would do him good to receive kindness from us, and if it comes from you, I believe it will mean even more.”
The smirk turned into a grin, a devilish one that Draco was finding he liked quite a bit. “So, there’s that,” he said. “And then you’ll also need some Muggle money, so you can buy your own drinks. Or other men drinks as it were.” He handed Draco a simple two-fold wallet. “It’s mokeskin, with an Anti-theft Charm on it, so just keep it in your back pocket. No one will be able to steal it.”
“Harry!” he cried, erupting all over Harry’s tanned torso, gray eyes never leaving green. With just a few more strokes Harry was releasing, too, and he kept his eyes open, making sure Draco could see the all the pleasure he had given him.
“Yeah?” Harry asked, unable to keep from getting his hopes up. Draco’d had to work over all of the Christmas holiday the year before, leaving them to have a rather less festive celebration on Boxing Day.
“The first one was… when I was about eight, I think? Eight or nine. Like I said, it only happened a few times.”
They’d talked more on the walk. Vesper didn’t even remember now all that they said to each other. It was likely not particularly important, just whatever came to mind. They simply seemed to like to hear each other speak.
Goddard turned to look at Bulstrode, who nodded, then turned to Hermione. “There are other treatment options,” she said. “Ones that are less invasive than Legilimency. There are charms that are designed to stimulate the mind into healing itself-“
Kyle shrugged. “Frustrating. I told you about the trouble I had with the higher-ups at my old company, their obsession with the bottom line.” Draco nodded. “Well, turns out government bureaucracy isn’t all that much better.”
Draco laughed and tried to fight him off, but then Potter was snogging him again and exploring the skin exposed by his half-open shirt, and Draco had no interest in resisting
“I sort of… well… I wouldn’t acknowledge it to myself at the time, but I sort of had a bit of a crush on Draco before I broke up with Ginny.”
Truth was, he’d always liked Aria. With her being a year below him and in a different house, they didn’t have that much chance of interacting regularly. But they still crossed paths on occasion and always ended up in interesting conversations. Perhaps it was that they had so much in common. Aria was passionate about animals and gifted in Herbology as well, and they’d had more than one opportunity to bond over the fact that they both had two dads.
wasn’t remotely nice to them for about seven years. Their dislike of me is well-deserved, and it wouldn’t surprise me if they needed some extra buttering up.”
. It’s much gentler, but still effective.” He took Draco by the wrist of his wand hand. “Point it directly at my opening,” he said. “And say the words.”
“You and Ron are a close second, of course,” she said with a smile. “I think what you two have is really amazing.”
And just like that, she stopped. She stopped trying to touch him. She stopped crying. She seemed to stop breathing, even, for a moment. Then she inhaled one shaky, painful-sounding breath, and stood.
Hermione scratched her temple lightly, thinking that over. “All right, I suppose we’ll try it,” she said.
“I was… when I was fifteen I was assaulted.” She cleared her throat. “Sexually. And um… well what is there to say besides that it kind of messed me up for a while? I was in a pretty dark place for a few months and then… I don’t know. I got a Mind Healer, obviously. My parents made sure of that. And I figured out that what I really needed was to feel safe, feel like I could take care of myself and like if something like that were to happen again I could…” She swallowed, her own words unnerving her. “Protect myself.” She risked a glance at Declan to find that he was looking at her, not with pity necessarily, but with compassion. It spurred her on. “My uncle is a world class dueling instructor and I asked him for lessons, just self-defense kind of stuff and one thing led to another and I found I really liked it. So I decided to start competing and…” She shrugged. “The rest is history.”
Harry considered that. Maybe he was just getting old, but he didn’t think he wanted to go out clubbing again for a long time. It took too much out of him. “Going out is fun,” he said. “But I think I like just being home with you better.”
“I worry that we reopened too soon. I worry that my students are in pain, being here, and they don’t know how to express it, or they are afraid to. And I worry about you.”
“No, sorry,” Vesper shook her head and let out a small huff of laughter. “That was out of nowhere. I was just thinking… What you said made me think about Blaise. When I first joined the Aurors he was getting all paternalistic on me about being safe and choosing a career where I wasn’t in danger. I mean… I
year Hufflepuff, Zeke Prewett, who he was pretty sure was a third cousin of Ron and Ginny’s, though he had very little interest in asking.
He looked down at his little cousin, who had metamorphed into a mini-Malfoy, complete with platinum blond hair and silver-gray eyes, looking much like Draco had at that age. He was staring at Matilda Sturgis with more anger than Draco had ever seen in the little boy.
“I happen to agree with you on that. I only said something to Vesper because Draco asked me to, and because she had mentioned to me that there were already two different men who had asked her out.” He saw Blaise’s jaw tighten at that. “So I thought… well, I wanted you to at least be in her thoughts, as it were, if she was considering her options.”
“You,” Draco replied, his voice equally quiet, “like this. Just like this.” He kissed Harry, slow and deep, and Harry matched him, moaning as Draco ground against him automatically.
“That’s so good, Callum,” Potter said, his voice dark and hypnotic. “Gods, look how much you can take.”
“I know,” Harry said sympathetically. “Nobody really does. But it’s just a part of life. However,” he added, getting a sudden idea, “that doesn’t mean that Toby can’t stay over here sometimes. You can have him come sleep over one weekend, or you could go over to his house for a night, if you wanted.”
“Shhhh,” Draco said. “Not relevant.” He peeled the covers from underneath Harry and then began to lay them over his naked body.
But Malfoy did no such thing. Instead, he grabbed a thick white towel from the stack by the showers and dried himself thoroughly. He wrapped that towel around his waist and then grabbed another, rubbing it furiously through his platinum locks and making them stick up in odd directions, a look that Harry found unexpectedly charming.
“Yes, she has,” Draco agreed. “But I think she’s up to something. She’s a bit too insistent that I attend
But he also knew what it took for Draco to come to him like this, to admit these feelings. Draco had, for all his articulation, a lot of trouble saying what he felt, at showing himself in any kind of vulnerable way. He turned, meeting Draco’s eyes for the first time in a long time, and he saw so much there: sadness, guilt, need, fear.
Draco adjusted his body on the bed, making the vibrator shift slightly inside him. He groaned at the pleasant sensation and knew Harry could feel the reverb of that groan on his skin. He plunged his tongue deeper, aware of Harry starting to writhe against him as he was being tongue-fucked by Draco for the first time.
"He sits there and stares at you like you're some unicorn and keeps spacing out. And don't think I didn't notice how sad he looked when the word got around that you had a little thing for that revolting Malfoy. What did you do, hit him with a love potion?!" Hannah shouts.
"Like I give a damn what Harry thinks." Draco spits but feels a pang in his chest. The sudden urge to scream comes back and he feels a teardrop on his face.
"Help." He said a bit louder. Soon he would hear Harry panting. "No!" He screamed, making Draco pop right out of his bed and stare at Harry in shock.
"Maybe we should, uh, talk somewhere else." Blaise mutters. Neville nods at him and stands up. Blaise grabs hold of his hand, which makes his heart flutter in delight, and takes him away from their peers.
Laying there on the ground is Draco Malfoy. They rush towards him and Harry lays a hand on his chest, feeling him breathing softly.
Blaise sighs, "No... If they love each other I suppose I should leave it alone. I still hate her though."
Soon enough his owl comes with a new envelope in her mouth and drops it on the desk. He was also thankful that this owl wasn't as greedy as his last one. She never pecked him continuously for food, but maybe that's because he was able to give this owl actual food.
"What the-" the door swings open, "Woah! You look like you're about to murder someone!" says a terrified Draco in front of him.
His mother rushes over with her wand and Draco followers her. His mother duels Ron while he takes on Harry. His eyes are wide and he can barely breathe and every spell he throws is blocked.
He knew he shouldn't be going anywhere with any Slytherin, but something about Blasie intrigued him. "I'd love to!" He said, maybe a bit too happily.
"Nothing! What? No I meant uh... They wanted you to come hang out with us." Harry says and shouts at himself silently. Even if it was true, Draco wouldn't want to considering everything he said to Myrtle!
What to get Neville... what to get for Neville. It's all he needed. Just something to get for him! Maybe something that will calm him down. Anything! Where even would that be?
Neville violently shakes his head, "No, no, no they won't! I've humiliated myself! My life is over!" Neville nearly screams.
"Nev..." Blaise grabs his arm, making his whole body feel as if it had just gone into shock. Why did he feel this way? "Nev... Look at me." The nickname brings shivers to his spine. He feared what would happen if he did what Blaise said.
"I..." Neville seemed to struggle as he would open and close his mouth as if debating whether or not to say something. "You scare me," Neville says suddenly. He gasps and covers his mouth.
He always found Harry's wild hair incredibly charming and his bright green eyes mesmerizing. But it seemed different now. He couldn't put his finger on it. Harry looks down at something, but Draco doesn't stop to think about what he's looking at until he feels a hand grab his own.
For the first time in a while, he isn't jealous. He doesn't need to be the only one in a persons life. For the first time in a while, he is truly happy to see Neville and Hannah sitting together.
He debates with himself for a long time on whether or not to tell Neville that he does indeed love him, very much. After almost an hour of not wanting to respond, he writes:
Everything seemed great for everyone... but there was only one problem. Harry had brought to his attention that Draco was having issues. He was harming himself!
Blaise sighs loudly, "Even Neville thinks I'd harm him... I just can't believe it! The audacity to claim he's going to care for Neville when he doesn't even bat an eye when someone picks on him!"
"B-but, I didn't want you to waste money on things for me..." Neville stares down at his shoes. The slight tint of pink upon his cheeks caused Blaise to stare. My, oh my how beautiful he was. Blaise could never ever possibly get over how angelic Neville looked and acted. How could someone be so perfect?
"From this day forward... your faith will be had in me." Voldemort says with a smirk, his pointy fingernail gesturing towards himself. "Step forward... come join me. Or die." He threatens, awaiting those to step forward.
"Oh, good." Draco says. He hears the clanking of heels getting closer and closer. Coming towards them was his mother.
Much to his dismay, he has to dodge stink bombs being thrown by Peeves at students going to their dorms. Once he got past that, he stood in the doorway of the bathroom. He could hear soft noises coming from inside. He steps closer as quietly as possible.
Blaise looks at Harry and Harry says, "Uh... Ok um... Oh, yeah! Hermione, Ron, and the other Weasley's make me the happiest. They're like my family. We can always talk and laugh together without judgement and George always is the light of the room... even without Fred... He can always turn on a light in the darkness. Ron and Hermione act like an old married couple." Harry chuckles, "It's hilarious. And Molly and Arthur are basically a mother and father to me at this point... Blaise?"
His mother sniffs, "He... Draco, show him your shoulder." Draco darts his eyes from his mother to the Auror. "Please."
Draco shakes his head, "I can't do this Harry! I don't know how to explain it! It's this weird sensation on my arms and... I need to do it or it will keep taunting me. Maybe that sounds strange but... I can't stop it! It's driving me mad."
"You never know until you try! Oh, by the way we still have the lemon glaze. Let's get to it. Get the sugar, lemon zest, and lemon juice." Hunter instructs. Blaise walks over to the cabinet and grabs the ingredients and lays them all on the counter in front of them. Suddenly a burning smell hit his nose. Oh no.
Blaise pulls away with a smile on his face, "Of course." He walks away without failing to look back at Neville and wave. Neville waves back awkwardly and notices Luna and Blaise walk out of the Great Hall together.
He held out his hands, trying to catch Trevor but miserably failing. Before he could stop at the sight of feet, he crashed into the person's legs. He groaned and laid there in defeat.
- Draco: Dragon (happiest memory: the times he has with all his friend's and family. It used to be the first time he talked to Blaise about his home life and Blaise gave him a hug)
He drew his wand, holding it tight in his hand and pointing it at Dumbledore. All he had to do was say Avada Kedavra, then everything would be ok.
"Well, maybe I shouldn't tell you this, but I helped someone enchant that bracelet. I may be wrong but I believe that person gave it to you. If it makes you feel any better, I can assure you that person cares about you very much." Dumbledore says, "But I'm getting off topic, aren't I?" He chuckles softly.
He sat beside him and Neville tried to push down the irresistible urge to hyperventilate. Blaise was surely going to do something to him and it wasn't going to be good.
He walked to potions the next day in a hurry, didn't quite know why. He sat in his seat alone, not even the teacher was here. He didn't sleep at all last night, so he just decided to stay awake. It's not too bad, actually.
He barely talked to Draco anymore so there was no way he'd be able to notice. He basically abandoned Draco! He couldn't help but wonder if it was all his fault.
"Luna!" Her father says with a bright smile. "I'm so happy you're safe. Never ever go around that boy again."
"Well, I won't say everything but he is homeless and doesn't have any food. I'm worried he'll die." Neville says with urgency, "Just please find him as quickly as possible."
"Do you need me?" Blaise asks him and he nods. He sits next to him and asks, "What do you need, mate?"
Draco sighs once more. "I... I think I like someone." He says feeling childish. Seriously, he's having a panic attack and the only thing he can say is 'I think I like someone.' What was he, six?!
"Because that is not the way to deal with things! If you never communicate anything, you'll never know what could've been."
Then, in Defense Against the Dark Arts, nothing seemed to change. Goyle still looked like he was ready to kill Neville Longbottom. Draco didn't care, but Harry seemed too invested in it to pay attention to the class.
Lucius glares at him and Draco with his teeth bared like an angry rottweiler. Draco steps backwards, bumping into a wall. His whole body begins to shake, even as he watches them drag him far away. His father is shaking like a mad man trying to get away, but fails miserably.
"I like you," Blaise states, looking into Neville's eyes with gentleness. A certain gentleness Neville never expected from any Slytherin.
"Oh, you don't know? That prat stepped into the Great Hall and said he was there to help them fight. For who? Mudbloods?!" Crabbe shouts. "We lose Goyle and now Blaise has gone mad?!"
Draco strutted down the hall in silence, thinking about why Harry suddenly was acting as if nothing happened. He felt angry and wanted to forget all about him, yet he also wanted to chase after him like a mutt. It made him hate himself much more. Only idiots would chase over someone like Potter.
"Seriously, you are hopeless. Slytherin's don't go to Honeydukes and spend all their galleons on a boy."
The doors slammed shut and Snape stomped toward Blaise with fire in his eyes. You would've thought he was going to murder him.
But that wouldn't make sense... He said he wasn't a Hufflepuff. She would be in the Ravenclaw Tower if it was a Ravenclaw. It can't be a Slytherin! That isn't possible!
Blaise lays down on the blanket, taking Neville with him. Neville makes a noise in shock, which makes Blaise chuckle at him. They clutch each other's warm hand and lay there in silence.
Giggles could be heard as soon as he entered. "Yeah-- Draco?" Pansy says from the left corner of the room. She walks towards him quickly. "Oh baby--"
Neville held Trevor closely as he walked back to the Gryffindor tower. He kept trying to slip out of his hand, like always.
"No thanks." Draco says and sits back down in his spot. Harry sighs and walks towards him. Draco puts his hand up, signalling for him to stop, and he does. "No. I want to be by myself."
When Blaise returned, not only was Snape furious but the whole class made it a goal to pester him about what just happened. That made Snape even more furious. When Snape was furious, the whole class was miserable.
The things Pansy said rang in his ears. But what if she lied? Pansy was one of the more Slytherin Slytherin's in their year and it wasn't uncommon for her to do things like this for her own personal gain.
He whined and cried like a baby, but he couldn't help it. He ached for Neville, but he would never have him. He debated many times finding a random girl to be with for at least one night or maybe two, but he decided against it. It never made him feel guilty or dirty before, but just the fact that he considered it made him disgusted with himself.
Then he began to wonder what it felt like to like boys, or Draco Malfoy for that matter. He couldn't imagine Draco, but maybe he could fall in love with a boy. Then again, what did love even feel like? Was it all just some illusion?
He sighs and places the letter onto his desk. He should've known it was stupid to try and guess. Great job, Blaise! You idiot! He plops onto the bed, just to be asked a few minutes later to lunch with Luna and her father.
Harry sighs. He admits that Draco could be right. "Fine... But look, I'll uh... I'll talk to Blaise for you, ok? I know you guys were close... or at least you seemed close."
"W-well... Who is it?" Draco asks, worried about the answer. What if it's Harry as well? I mean, every girl has a crush on Harry. It wouldn't be surprising if all gay men liked Harry too. It's not like he had a chance with Harry, but having another person over the moon for him made him worried.
He begins to wonder if this is what he made those girls feel. Maybe this is payback for all those times he's used them? He wouldn't be surprised if that was the case.
"I was confused by it for a while... But now that I said it to someone, it just feels right. It feels true." Blaise says, giving Draco a smile, "I'm glad I told you, even though I'm still terrified to tell you who it is..."
"I just wanted you to feel welcome." Maggie says sadly. "I know it's bad to go behind master Lucius's back, but I must, for you are also my master. I must punish myself after, but it's my duty either way."
"Welcome, Mister Potter." The judge says, which causes Draco's heart to stop. "Now, we ask you what are your experiences with them. What did the Malfoy's do to you?" The judge asks.
The nurse lays a metal tray onto the table beside him. It has a piece of chicken, cheese, black tea, and vegetable soup.
"He apologized to me today! For the first time ever! Well, not for everything, but for his attitude yesterday. Plus we actually had a civilized class time together today. If nothing else, I'll make him apologize to you guys too." He assures them.
"I'm sorry for your loss. I really am. If you need to take the rest of the day off, you may do so." Dumbledore suggests.
Tomorrow was Christmas break and Draco was once again in the hospital wing and failed his first attempt at the assignment. He hasn't very hopeful for his trip back home.
"You wanna talk about it?" Hannah asks. Neville nods sadly and Hannah grabs his hand, "Come on," She turns to the wall, "Jelly belly." The wall spreads apart and Hannah leads him into the room.
"Well, I'm glad. I should be thanking you, you know. I could've been starving without you." He smiles at him.
Draco thinks for a while. Maybe being with Harry can make him a better person. Maybe it can change his life for the better.
"You want payment, huh?" The owl nods its head once in response. "Well... I don't have much but I have some crackers. They aren't good though... I tried them. You want those?" Blaise asks and the owl nods once more. Blaise sighs, grabs the crackers from the kitchen and lays it in front of the owl. The owl nibbles on the crackers as he reads the letter.
"Huh," Draco got up and sat down beside Harry. He looked over his shoulder to look at the page, noticing it was transfiguration. He looked over to see that Harry's book from before had turned to ashes. "Oh, I see. Look, all you gotta do is..." Draco picked up his wand and reached over to grab a quill to experiment on. He waved his wand gracefully, watching as the quill turned into a dove. He then smiled and looked over at Harry. Their eyes met and Draco gulped. They were way too close.
Late that night he was told that Dumbledore was in the astronomy tower. This was his time. It's kill or be killed.
So much had gone on that she had nearly forgotten Draco's little crush on Harry. She noticed them giving each other strange looks. Ron seemed to notice as well.
"Trust me, he wouldn't even think about that." Luna assures, but Ron simply looks at her like he's crazy. Harry can only hope she's correct. Even if Blaise had proved his intentions before, he knows Slytherins can easily manipulate. I mean, look at Draco. He played him like he was a game of Wizard's Chess.
Snape then gave him a strange look. He couldn't pinpoint it, but he seemed to know something. He then seemed to regain back his previous emotion.
"We can go catch fireflies, maybe that'll make you feel better. Or perhaps we can go feed the thestrals." Luna suggested.
Snape gives him a look of knowing but it instantly is turned back to a stern seriousness. "This is no joke, this isn't something to put off. I will help you with your quest if you need me to, but you must do it yourself. If you don't, you and your family will be in grave danger. You must cooperate with me, Draco."
When his finishes eating much more politely and listens to the people around them talk amongst themselves, he was free to leave. His mother insisted that he go to Hogwarts and be with his friends, but most of the time he just sat alone, not wanting to be around anyone. Not to mention Blaise was being disgustingly cute with Neville and Draco didn't want to be a third wheel.
Draco didn't think his heartbeat could get wilder than this. He locks eyes with Harry and looks down at his lips. They look so soft. What would it feel like to kiss them?
"I came to tell you that we have an assignment to do," Harry says. "Remember the one Professor Sprout assigned?"
Draco rolls his eyes at her annoying voice. "Yeah me neither, we get it it's terrible. Can I enjoy lunch without being reminded of it?! Thank you." Draco finishes with a fake smile.
Harry suddenly feels depressed. Just knowing that Draco found him revolting made him feel strange. It never bothered him before, but this time it just feels terrible.
This can't be right. Does Draco wear amortentia for his cologne? No, there's no way. He smelt other things than just that cologne. Maybe he just really likes the scent of the cologne and that's why? Or he just kept smelling Draco beside him.
"Before I give this back to you... I want us to have an actual conversation about this." Harry says, "No fighting, no screaming. Just talking."
"A nurse will escort you." The lady says, gesturing to the nurse coming up towards them. They follow her and they lead them to the same room they've been to many, many, many times.
If she is thinking correctly, this means that... No, that can't be! They kissed each other! But then again, many gay guys always date girls first before they realize they're gay.
He noticed footsteps go towards the bathroom. Footsteps just heavy enough to recongnize. That's another task: get the money once he leaves the room. It seems terrible, but it's either this or starve.
His heart beats fast and all he can hear is the roaring of the fire. He suddenly crashes onto the ground. The sweet, sweet ground. He stumbles to his feet and runs away as quickly as he can. His feet burn with pain, but he pushes on. Crabbe follows closely behind him before falling to his knees.
Draco sneers at her, "Go away." He says. He glanced over at Harry, trying to be discreet. He saw Harry looking at him and Harry quickly looked away. How strange.
Neville sits in silence. How could someone go through this? How could a parent do that to their child? He scribbles angrily.
"I will do anything and that is a promise." Blaise says, not once breaking eye contact. "Just say the word."
"Nothing, mate. This happens to many people. We just need to get you professional help, that's all." Blaise says.
He just hopes he's becoming less of an arse. It shocked him when he apologized earlier, but it made him really happy to hear him say that for the first time ever. It makes him have hope for him. He walks out of the classroom with Hermione and Ron.
They deepen the kiss and Draco reaches up into Harry's hair and runs his fingers though it. It is soft, so incredibly soft.
When he came back he could hear someone say from the back of the class, "Let's hope Neville can measure this time!"
"Because I know who it is!" Hunter sings. "But, no shame here. I fully support whoever you decide to love. In fact, all love is supported from me. So, if you happen to express your feelings for that person to me, no judgement, I promise on Helga Hufflepuff's grave! But, if you don't want to tell me, I understand too." This was the most Hunter spoke at once and it made him realize just how energetic the guy was. He spoke quick and rambled on, but was really really happy about it.
"Crucio!" Bellatrix shouts. Hermione falls back the floor and screams in pain. "Crucio!" She shouts again with a giggle.
Harry sighs, "I didn't say you were! Look, I just wanna get through this stupid ball and maybe do something normal for once. Besides, I'm incredibly tired and all these nightmares aren't doing good for me. That's all. I'm just tired and stressed."
Blaise put his hand on the back of Neville's neck, deepening the kiss. Goosebumps ran across Neville's arm at Blaise's touch. Blaise pulls away and lays his hand on Neville's cheek delicately.
"I want you to try again. But this time, really concentrate on it. Imagine the blueberry is already a bird. Try it." Blaise says, handing him another blueberry.
Day's like these were drinking days for Blaise. Well, any day at home was a drinking day, but especially today. It all started last night, but he didn't expect that run in with Neville to trigger anything in him. But as soon as his body touched Neville, his whole mood shifted. He worried Neville was afraid of him because of the way he acted and the intense thoughts and emotions he had that night drove him so crazy that he was thankful that he bought lots of firewhiskey.
"I'll help you with that too! But for now we need to teach you how to fly." Blaise says, handing Neville a broom.
Blaise rests his back on the wall in front of the Hufflepuff common room entrance, waiting for a certain Hufflepuff to come into view. After waiting for quite a while and getting dirty looks from many other Hufflepuffs, including Hannah Abbott, to which he gave a scowl right back at, the Hufflepuff he needed came into view.
Maybe he's just sleep-deprived... That's it. He's not actually attracted to him, he's just stressed out and tired. Nothing is wrong with him.
- Luna: Hare (happiest memory: moments with her friends, especially when they'd take up for her and make her laugh)
"I totally am! See, me and my family always go..." The sight of dark skin and dark clothes catch his eye and make him tune Hannah out completely.
He looks at the sky to see a basket flying its way over to them. Blaise catches it flawlessly and opens it up. He pulls out a blanket and lays it on the ground below them.
The more he looked around, the more the thoughts dissipated. They finally dissappeared with his eyes found their way towards a familar looking couple. One with long red hair, the other with messy black hair. It can't be... it was. Ginny Weasley and Harry Potter.
Blaise takes hold of his hand this time. Neville suddenly feels a strange warmth not to mention a funny, but nice feeling rushing through his stomach.
"It's your feelings and it's nothing to be ashamed of. If you have feelings for a Slytherin, then great! Even if you can never ever be with them, these feelings can teach you something. Perhaps this person can teach you something. Every feeling and person you care for is there for a reason. A friend told me that, a very dear friend."
"W-wait... It's a boy?" Blaise whispers. Draco stares down at the floor and Blaise smiles. "It is!" He whispers excitedly.
"Well, first of all... It seems to me that Gryffindors attract Slytherins much more than we thought." Blaise chuckles.
Again... terrible liar. "Alright. I'll see you later!" Pansy says, giving him a bright smile and skipping away.
Blaise's dark eyes dart from Neville to the table. He could tell he was making Blaise uncomfortable, but he couldn't take his eyes away.
Harry looks at him in shock. Why did Blaise look so passionate about this?! He looks at Draco who is simply shaking his head at him.
Blaise's breath catches in his throat. No, this can't be true. Luna squeezes his hand and he squeezes it back.
Crabbe and Goyle convinced him to run after Harry. They both had decided not to fight but came back to help him duel Harry and get his wand back. Not like it would help him feel safer or more confident about it at all. He felt like a monster. But what was the point? He didn't have much to live for anyways.
Draco laid awake in his new bed thinking about his father, Voldemort, and his quest. He imagined every possible outcome. Each one seemed more horrific than the previous one.
"Want one?" He asks and Neville shakes his head in response. "Alright, well, if you go back to your dorm there won't be a punishment. I understand if you do so and I'll inform your teachers."
"That's terrible, all of it! I am so sorry you go through that. Your mother shouldn't be like that! You seem like such a kind person. You don't deserve this, you can't possibly deserve it! I know you're scared for me to know who you are, but maybe we can give you shelter at my house? My grandmother makes good food! And you'll never be ignored that's for sure. What do you say?"
"You aren't implying that we like each other, right? I simply went to the ball with her, that's all." Harry says.
Harry comes back soon with the same bottle he saw in Dumbledore's wrinkly hands just before Christmas.
"Oh... Wait, did you say him?" Neville asks. He would've been freaking out, but he couldn't seem to feel anything.
Draco took a look around. It seemed cluttered and chaotic, but oddly comforting in some way. He didn't know how to explain it. It for sure wasn't anything like his home.
"Stop!" He hears his Aunt shout. He keeps his eyes on Harry and Harry glares at him. "Drop your wands. Drop them!" She shouts at them.
Harry stands there blushing. "Uh... I'm gonna take you to Madame Pomfrey." This time, Draco doesn't fight it. He lets Harry take him by the arm and lead him to the infirmary.
"Hey... maybe we can both stay here for Christmas? We won't have to deal with our families and then you can relax." Blaise suggests.
"Narcissa and Draco Malfoy, come with me." The Auror says, walking towards the door. Draco attempts to move and notices he now is able to. His mother grabs his hand and leads him out the door with the Auror.
He didn't even make an effort to ask what bargyles even were. Blaise scoffs, "If you think I'm into Longbottom, you surely are as crazy as they say."
"What the hell?!" He shouts. Draco notices his eyes begin to get red and his chest rise and fall as he paced around the common room. "Fucking bitch! How could she?! Neville doesn't deserve her!"
They sit in silence and listen to the sounds of nature. Blaise closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. Neville watches him intently and notes how he looks in the setting sun. His skin looked golden and as he opened his eyes, he noticed they looked golden as well.
"Listen, I know Harry is with Ginny now but hey... Neville is with Hannah and I'm still sending him a gift. Just to see him smile. You want Harry to smile, right?" Blaise asks.
Draco bumps into someone and they both fall on the ground. "Sorry, I-- Potter!" Draco stands up quickly and sneers at the raven-haired boy on the ground. "This is your fault you--"
As if on cue, his potions Professor stepped into the room. For once he was glad to see him. Something about his presence at this moment made the situation seem much less terrifying.
But then he kept thinking of the possibility of Blaise Zabini being the mysterious gift-giver. It oddly made him happy, except that's not the case and Blaise Zabini is evil, just like every Slytherin.
Neville Longbottom shakily made his way to Dumbledore's office. He had no idea what the password was. He actually asked Professor McGonagall thirty minutes earlier but managed to forget all about it. He didn't even have the faintest idea what it was!
"Geez, we were just asking." Crabbe retorts, moving a chess piece only to have it destroyed by Goyle's piece. "Crap!" He grunts.
"No... I always thought I was too clumsy to. You know... everyone thought I was a squib when I was younger... Sometimes I think they were right... But then whenever I think I can't possibly do magic at all, my grandmother reminds me that I survived being dropped by Great-Uncle Algie by using my magic when I was a baby. But even then... sometimes I worry I don't have enough magic. I don't think I really belong here." Neville says, "Sorry to make it all depressing..."
Something about it dissappointed him. But, after all, he shouldn't be surprised. The only Slytherin he has hope for is Blaise Zabini due to a word going around that Neville did indeed get that present. Except no one knows it was Blaise except him. The only thing that worries him is that he is Draco's friend. But, the urgency to get the perfect gift for Neville is a good alabi for him. He just hopes he wasn't fooled.
Greyback grabs his arm and pulls him down the steps. Meanwhile he's trying his best not to freak out. Dumbledore just died... right in front of him. Professor Snape killed him!
"Not all of you, just three of you. I mean, come on! You're playing with Neville! You're making him think you wanna be his friend when really you're just planning to humiliate him! How revolting!" Harry shouts.
Blaise must be upset with the amount of times he has gotten cut off, but Draco is quite relieved she stepped in.
He knocked on the door. "Enter." says his father sternly. He slowly opens the door and gulps. His eyes are met with his father's cold ones. He sat as still as a tree in winter, which only made Draco more nervous.
"Yeah." Neville says, stretching out his back. "So... this is the place?" Neville asks, taking in the picture of the flowers beside the lake.
With that, Blaise Zabini strolls to the center of the classroom and tries the Patronus charm. A simple small light comes out and almost forms a shape, but quickly disappears.
Just then, his Aunt throws her knife right at them, only to have it clang to the floor and their enemies dissappear.
"What?!" Draco shouts back. "What do you want now?!" He couldn't stop himself, he had to shout or else he'd give all his secrets away.
Much to Neville's dismay, Snape appears in his vision. Just at the sight of him, his palms get sweaty and he worries he'll do something wrong. He does everything wrong.
When they finally get there, they walk in and Draco immediately notices Harry. It took everything in him to not walk right back out and run all the way to Antarctica.
He hesitantly lowers his button-up shirt from his shoulder and is shocked himself. He didn't realize it looked that bad. His shoulder was covered in black and blue and still ached.
Draco watches Harry walk away, feeling as if Harry just beat him in a duel in front of everyone. He suddenly feels as if he's going to scream. He runs into the nearest boy's bathroom, running into a stall and hiding. Just like at home, always finding a small little place to hide. He never knew why he felt the need to hide, all his father did was judge him and he only hit him with curses once. He's just a baby, isn't he? A weak, disgraceful, failure of a son. He'll never grow, will he?
She holds up a clutched fist and opens it, something falling from her hand. He looks down and notices that it's a bubblegum wrapper. He pockets it before dropping his mothers ring onto the table beside her. It seemed useless, it's not like they'd realize it was their engagement rings. His grandmother insisted that it would be something that would make them happy in the long run, but he seriously doubted it.
The sun beat down on him, highlighting his dark locks and the light blue of his sweater. He looked beautiful. Blaise drinks in the sight for a few seconds, admiring the boy on the grass before moving from his spot and standing in front of him.
"Says the girl who eats like a troll whenever the cupcakes come out." George says with a playful scowl.
"Mister Malfoy?" says a nurse who interrupts their conversations, "Not meaning to intrude, but your mother insists that we get you something to eat as soon as possible."
He searched the room and caught eyes with his father's enemy Arthur Weasley. He gives him a small wave followed by a small smile. Draco awkwardly gives a wave back.
"I'll definitely try." The boy smirks and is remains silent. Draco is on veritaserum? But that can't be right.
"No, how about you shut up and listen. I'm gonna tell you a little something about myself." Blaise says, making Draco's sneer turn into a look of dreadful confusion. "Let's go sit." Blaise leads him to a table full of chairs and they both sit in front of each other.
Suddenly, the room goes cold and dark. He suddenly feels empty and devoid of all happiness. Something is wrong.
He was happy for Neville to be back in his life. He even got to meet his grandmother! It was awkward, but she did make a good apple pie.
"Oh, uh no it's fine. I was just going to get a lollipop." Neville says softly, "I kinda did want one, though. No, I meant-"
"I don't need to. But if it'll ease your mind I will read it." Luna says and Neville nods eagerly. "Alright then." Luna carefully removes the letter from the envelope and reads it. Throughout the reading she begins to smile. "That's so sweet."
Blaise smiles, "He'd love that. Maybe we should organize a family dinner. Me, you, Draco, the Weasley's, all of us!"
We have very important business to attend to this weekend, me and you. The dark lord is ready to accept you and it is your time to wear the dark mark just like a true Malfoy. Be ready and do not embarrass us.
"I've seen it on the train." Blaise states. "I'm sorry if that's weird or anything... Maybe it is." He shakes his head.
He looks over, noticing Goyle grabbing a chair, only to fall right into the flames. His heart stops, but he has no time to waste. He continues to climb along with Crabbe. He slips, but quickly grabs back onto a metal bar.
The next day Professor McGonagall called both Harry and Draco down to her office. Draco was unpleasantly surprised by Harry's presence.
"Well, I get the joy of seeing Draco spill all his secrets to Potter, then Potter tells the whole school and bam! Perfect plan." Pansy smirks. "You should be happy! Remember when Draco threw your remembral at the wall and shattered it. You were pretty upset." The truth was, the remembral was for Neville, not him.
"I betrayed you. I knew you were on the good side, or at least you would be, but I went ahead and did what father wanted." Draco says.
"Fine... Fine, we can try to get along..." Draco says, making Harry smile a little. "But don't get all weird and try to be my friend."
Voldemort, he finally agrees to call him, was staring at them all amongst his followers. He stood with Luna and held her hand which was softly shaking.
He walked towards the black lake with Blaise coming into view. He noticed him with two broomsticks and rubbing something off his shoulder.
Neville does the same, trying to remind himself that he can fly. He can fly. They kick off and fly through the air. Neville tries not to stop to look at the scenery around him, although it was beautiful. His grandmother was going to be furious.
Neville, with one quick elegant swipe, slices the snake to dust. Blaise stares in awe. The dust erupts in dark smoke.
"Yeah! I wanted to say-" She stops when the door to the library opens. He follows her gaze and sees Blaise Zabini and Draco Malfoy in the doorway. Blaise glares at them and Neville stares at the floor.
His chest tightens. His father can't be dead! He never even had the chance to speak to him, to hear his voice! He can't be dead! This isn't true.
Neville reaches over and grabs it back, "I think I'd rather keep the letter private, just in case." He says.
He slept in his closet once again. What could he say? It felt much more safe then his actual bed. He never understood why, it's not like his father ever checked on him at night or at all. If he ever came up to his room it was because he did something wrong or something was needed of him.
"You made this?" He asks Maggie. She nods in response. "It's really good." He compliments and takes another bite. "Now take it back before we both get in trouble." He says, putting the fork back on the plate and leaning away from it.
"There was something else... I'm curious!" Harry says genuinely. Maybe if Draco shows him his arm he can compliment Draco and make him feel more confident? Even if the picture is traumatic for him. Then again, he didn't want to be treated like charity. Not that Harry was doing it for 'charity'.
They had taken Luna Lovegood not too long ago along with many others. They assumed that if they kept his friends prisoner, he'd have no other choice but to show up right here. Then they'd call the Dark Lord and Harry Potter would die.
