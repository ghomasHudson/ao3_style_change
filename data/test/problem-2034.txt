“What if they’re place-holders?” Michelle says tentatively. “Mr Zabini was talking about constructing a scaffolding. Sometimes, you can use switching charms to replace it with a proper structure.”
Draco’s hands relax to his side. Narcissa reacts just as fast,  smiling naturally as she stands up and hugs Draco.
Pansy’s lip curls in distaste. “Come on, tell me. If your actions were for the better good, then you don’t have anything to hide. Aegis gave you the soul orb, and you

Now, at the conclusion of the fest, all the authors in the fest now have at least one work. This would make predicting their authorship in future anonymous fests easier.
“Good day, you bastards,” she says pleasantly.
A house elf suddenly pops up next to him. “Mr Potter, be careful!”
It sounds as though Harry’s been disrespecting Sirius’s memory. But he would
“An acceptable idea,” a Ministry official says.
“Who’s to say
Harry narrows his eyes. “Why didn’t you do this earlier? I missed out on so much great sex!”
Draco has to force down his reactionary uneasiness. He should be confident in his own ability to protect the Slytherins and adopted non-Slytherins under his wing regardless of the situation.
Harry opened his eyes again, dazed. He blinked at Draco, whose face was so close that he didn’t look blurry.
And if Malfoy isn’t scared, then why should Harry be scared?
“No, no, I simply need to beat you so that, for the rest of our lives, I can say I was better than you at seeking at Hogwarts,” Harry says boldly.
It is a question of whether Draco has the power to protect his Slytherins.
Too angsty? Want something more lighthearted? Check out

The four of them hold for minutes longer, sinking magical anchors into the ground around them.
A moment later, Garren goes flying. His wand slaps into Draco’s free hand. Pain radiates across Draco’s chest, and for a beat, his heart stops. It starts again through the numbing cold of the stunner.
Harry removes his arm and finally gets under the covers, wriggling to find a comfortable position. “It’s nice to be back here properly.” His green eyes behind his glasses are serious. “Even though it’s been hard for us, Hogwarts will be better for the students coming after us.”
No Slytherin speaks to outsiders about Draco’s duel with Garren. But the

Potter’s not comforted by it. “And this week? Next week? What’s going to happen? Is someone going to

It takes a moment for Draco to switch to the topic that Potter has jumped to.
Harry laughs, while Draco sorely regrets not buying something incriminating for Pansy.
“Oh yeah, of course I’m coming.”
When they reach the Great Hall, instead of taking a seat at Slytherin table, Draco continues walking up to the front. Of all the Professors, Draco heads to Flitwick, who is seated next to Hagrid.
“Are you
Hogwarts shifts, and Blaise tilts his head imperceptibly. Harry and Draco have returned from their class-teaching, and their outpouring of magic is bolstering Hogwarts up, just a little longer.
“Wait!” Harry yells, dashing down the stairs. “What did you think I was doing?” He ends up with his face in Malfoy’s back, and it takes a moment for them to separate.

Harry nodded. His arms were still inside his burrito.
He’s faced with big watery eyes and gets his group hug a moment later.

That Friday evening, McGonagall announces that the Head of Houses will be conducting career meetings with students fifth year and up, starting from the Eighth years and working back.
Robards nods while Healer Murie and Charlie Weasley both look at Draco Malfoy in surprise.
Harry made a face of disbelief.
Draco kisses the corners of Harry’s eyes. “You can take it, baby boy. You can.”
And unlike Greyback, Draco doesn’t think he’ll be able to obliviate all these Aegis members, and so he has to hold back his spells.
Potter grins, green eyes lighting up. “They really love you, Malfoy,” Potter says easily.
“What’s the point of classes…”

“It’s the only thing you want,” Draco said plainly. “You never needed more from me. You had your dates, your friends, your family. What else could I offer that they hadn’t already given you?”

Meanwhile, to outsiders: Harry appears to be getting redder and redder. He also starts hugging himself.
Now that he has Malfoy, he doesn’t want to let go. So instead, he tightens his arms around Malfoy and apparates them straight to bed.
Draco relaxes, his lips curling up slightly. He starts clapping, leading the wave of applause. Oh, how exquisite is that expression on the Wizengamot Member’s face?

“Um, we...we should wait for Harry to recover.”
“Okay, I’ll stop teasing you. You can place an express owl order if you want. Or think about your strengths. For example, baking—”
Draco gave an exaggerated sigh. “But now I’ll have to find
Over the course of the next two days, Harry’s Christmas gift plans sprawl into being. He’s determined to do it right the first time and show everyone just how much he appreciates them. So in-between mealtimes with Malfoy, Harry rushes to discuss matters with Jamie and Blaise, he quickly follows Felicity up to the owlery, and he hurries around the castle, and carefully hides his gifts.
Harry should not be surprised about what the Slytherin Eighth Year dorm looks like after seeing the extravagant Slytherin Commons.
Draco frowns at the papers. He’s

But that’s not possible. Not even with the Resurrection Ring.
When Draco received the invitation letter to repeat his Seventh Year at Hogwarts—even though it was mandatory for him—he was relieved. It was a chance to get away from his damned father. Draco thought that as long as he stayed away from Potter, he wouldn’t be angry enough to transform while at Hogwarts. Unfortunately, Professor Garren proved him wrong.

“Okay…” Harry looked down, mentally preparing himself. It was also in the perfect position for Draco to lean down and kiss the top of his head.
“A-huh.” Potter tucks the badge away again. “With Garren?”
Harry's missed out on so much of his dad’s culture, both the wizarding and the Indian side. What about Samhain and Yule, that Draco had to teach Harry about?

Jamie especially likes how they can eat their meals in the Slytherin commons now. Mr. Malfoy still forces them to head to the Great Hall sometimes, but on the mornings that Jamie doesn’t have to go, he can sleep in!

spreads across the students and some of the braver students who have good friends among the Slytherins even dare to venture out and receive the second confirmation from the Slytherins themselves.
But for all the hustle and bustle, Draco is not entirely sure who will come. He did not expect Lovegood and her girlfriend Weasley to be the first.
“There is a web of magic that holds it up,” Draco says. “A little bit of your magic is there too. Did you feel it?”
Flitwick leans in closer, frowning.
After all, they had so much bad history. But the past was slowly fading to the back of his mind, replaced with their daily domestic interactions, of them snuggling together, of kissing and other activities.

in Hogwarts itself! It hasn’t gotten better since I resorted, has it? Malfoy?”
Draco rubbed Harry’s tummy and Harry giggled. He immediately wrapped his arms around Draco’s neck and let him carry Harry to the main bathroom.
After mumbling quietly about the story of how he and Ron infiltrated Slytherin back in Second Year, Harry finishes off with the comment that he has been waiting all evening to say:
With that kind of power, Robards wonders if Azkaban would even be enough to contain him.
Gryffindor Patil’s eyes spark with some interest. “Alright.”  The two Patils go off with Felicity.
Draco squeezes Potter’s hand tightly until Potter winces. Grumbling, Potter tugs his hand back.
The scent of sweet and buttery foods soon fill the air. Draco ushers the first and second years to have their breakfast, and inserts Harry in the middle of them.
Madame Pomfrey and Pansy and even
A warm hand rubs Harry’s head, the fingers lightly scratching. “Go to sleep, don’t worry so much. Do you want me to sing you a lullaby?”
“Do you...want to play ball?” Harry hazards.
“Mr Malfoy, are you, please?” Jamie hints. “We don’t have work due yet!”
Today is the last full day of the school year. Tomorrow, the graduating seventh and eighth years will get to leave via the enchanted boats across the lake.
Sighing inwardly, he draws his wand and casts a few little spells.
Something lightens in Aster’s chest.
A hazy light filtered through the curtains of Draco and Harry’s bedroom. The lump in bed, otherwise known as Harry, had buried his head under his pillow.
“No.” Draco makes an expression of distaste. “Potter, are you worried about me? I could get up and walk away if Madam Pomfrey will let me, you should know how overly cautious she is.”
Instead, one of them, clearly the leader, tells the Aurors, “Of course, we heard rumours of a wild dragon at Hogwarts. An unregistered dragon animagus who is also a dark wizard. You all must know our mission to cleanse Britain from dark wizards, Aurors. We are deeply sorry for accidentally damaging Hogwarts during our attempt to subdue the dangerous dragon.”
“One thread is weak, but weave many threads together and we produce strength,” Blaise says. “Here’s what we will do…”
The low sound of joyful Christmas songs builds a rich undercurrent to the clatter of cutlery and the laughter and bubbling voices.
Nolan jumps in. “If you go, I’ll go too!”

“...My parents were attacked by Aegis,” Draco finally says.
The scale of the damage is much, much greater than what Draco has faced before during his rounds with Blaise. But the details he can see are also sharper. As his fingers rest against Hogwarts, a plan to fix each part coalesces in his mind.

Cracks spread from where the hourglass once stood, across the stone floor, up the wall that backs into the Great Hall. The floor shudders.

It doesn’t make sense if we only help you on the night of the full moon...Alice?”
“I hope you understand to keep this a secret from Granger and Weasley,” Malfoy says.
They press their hands together, palm to palm. The magic in the air coalesces around them as the bond settles in their chests.
“That’s right,” multiple Weasleys agreed.
The atmosphere in the Great Hall lightens, warms, and bright chatter rises into the air.
“Okay,” Harry mumbled.
“...Mr Malfoy. What brings you here?”
“Stay still, Potter darling,” Draco retorts. A moment later, he utters an unfamiliar spell that grants Harry enhanced night vision.
As for the ‘official’ meetings, the Eighth Years have their careers meetings at the start of the new week, scattered between their free periods and the afternoon after classes.
Little does he know that Robards had already retrieved the evidence of him contacting the papers. Unspeakables and Hit Wizards have the abilities to uncover magical traces. And so, in the foreseeable future, Hitchly will never be working with sensitive information in the DMLE, and will have no legal way to punish those that he thinks should be punished. He would only be able to keep his head down against the threat of his own punishment, lest the same fate of

Draco nods. “Then by all means.” He smirks. “I won’t tell Hogwarts.”
William glares.
Draco lags back a little, placing himself between them and the Slytherins. But the Hufflepuffs don’t do anything.
Hermione Granger scoffed. “Harry is my best friend. As for what Harry is to you…”
Instead of going up to his art room, Harry stopped by his rarely used study room instead. Inside there was a rarely used desk with a rarely opened drawer, containing Malfoy’s hawthorn wand which Harry kept forgetting to return.
Harry deflated a little, but he was bolstered up again by Draco’s use of “we”. They went to get dressed together. Harry sat on the bed while Draco picked out their attire.

She suspects that Draco is indeed an animagus, but is calling himself a ‘weredragon’ as an excuse to avoid Ministry persecution. But when the ‘weredragon’ status information gets out, it’ll affect his marriage prospects negatively instead, even if she tells the other pureblood families that Draco isn’t really a weredragon.

In the privacy of Draco’s mind, he’s allowed to much prefer Lovegood and Ginevra at the Slytherin table than to Granger and Weasley. At least Lovegood and Ginevra don’t look at Draco as though he’s trying to steal their precious child.
Unfortunately, Draco has to grudgingly admit, Pansy is partially right. It’s not the visiting-the-thestrals that helps settle his magic, but the

“That’s Dad’s Patronus,” Nolan says proudly.

Harry smiles politely. “Good afternoon, Professor McGonagall, Professor Garren. I’m Draco’s second in all his duels, so I felt it suitable that I come as well.”

Everyone farewells Shacklebolt, and he floos away back to the Ministry.

Harry freezes. “Er.”

After working with Malfoy on occasion at the Ministry, she also knew that Malfoy typically disdained the company of others. He would attend various functions out of duty, but he wouldn’t go out of his way to have dinner with someone every week unless he held them in high esteem.
“Only on paper,
McGonagall’s lips quirk up, just a little. “Mr Potter may stay. He is a trustworthy wizard, and we are not discussing state secrets.”
The two of them head back to the Slytherin Commons.

Weasley shudders. “How can you smile, Harry?
Flitwick purses his lips and quickly hops off his seat and comes to the front of the stage. “This is urgent, I assume. How may I help you?”
Neville drops by again with new seedlings, and then rather unexpectedly, Blaise Zabini is at his doorstep too.
“What are you, a brat?”
Despite Harry’s blush, his countenance remains stubborn.

Harry rubs his head and pushes Malfoy back. “Yes, yes, stop standing so close to me.”
Out of all the people that Draco spends a lot of time with, doesn’t Harry best fit the bill?

Harry is really the only person with reason to go to the Great Hall for meals. He declines going at lunch, but at dinner, he does go. Draco and Pansy drop him off outside the Great Hall where Granger and Weasley await.

The next morning is Saturday, the day of the first Quidditch match. Aster’s injuries have completely disappeared. Pomfrey reluctantly lets Aster leave on the condition that they come back for a check up every day for a week.
“Then you can come out more often…” Hermione hints.
Harry nods. They shift positions and lie back down again; Pansy grabs Harry’s arm, making sure he stays close.
“Then he would become Head Auror instead,” Garren points out.
“I’m Owen Jones,” the Ravenclaw boy says, tilting his head to look down on Jamie.
Draco has no plans to lead her to the other students. Instead, he winds his way out of the Forest and then snaps a disillusionment charm on himself the moment he and Green are separated by a large tree trunk.
Draco looks over the Slytherins he’s supposed to be looking after. “Lead them out of the Forest.”
Draco twists Harry’s magic with his and with what’s left of Hogwarts to form new pillars, to block the leakage from the Black Lake into the castle…

Garren shakes his head. He stands up, smiling genially, and farewells the Headmistress.

Garren steps up and blocks the doorway. His eyes sweep across the laboratory and land on Draco. “

Harry, unsteady on his feet, blinks dazedly at him. “...You’re naked.”
“Malfoy, coming to the canteen for lunch?” one of Draco’s coworkers called out.
Hermione’s lips pursed. Her mind flashed back to a few weeks ago, when she perhaps saw Draco Malfoy exiting a jewellery store…
Castles were historically built near stone quarries, and Hogwarts is similar—of course, “close” for wizards is different from “close” for muggles. Two members of the Wizengamot team go to the nearby quarry to cut up new stones.
Harry blushes. “Oh...You look good too…” he mumbles, looking down at the ground. Draco’s chest swells with how Harry looks.
Harry’s lips curl up slightly. “Hm. And not you?”
Heh, alternate-universe!Harry’s activities may even involve a “ring” around a certain “finger”...
“But—why would they attack you?!” Granger grits her teeth. “That must be why I haven’t seen them this morning…”

“Hm, you feel familiar,” the person says, and the pressure mostly disappears.

Harry, after seeing Draco deal so easily with Nolan, decides to bring up the idea of potential children again. Draco quickly princess-carries Harry to bed and discovers (or rather, uncovers~) the special last gift that Harry prepared for him.
Nolan quickly nods.
Harry admired their hands side by side. Small hand, large hand. Brown hand, pale hand. The bronze rings glinted in the light, very eye catching.
Pansy smiles. “Don’t be so nervous! It’s not like you’re getting married yet. I won’t surprise you with a marriage official.”
“If you have any problems, come to me, understood?”
Draco’s eyebrows rise slightly. “Perhaps you should have had Blaise on your hunting team.”
“Good morning, Mr Malfoy,” McGonagall says, her voice steely. “You

Draco takes out Harry’s cake after dinner and serves himself and Harry a slice first. Only then does he give the rest to the younger Slytherins to divide among themselves.
Draco straightens. “Is something the problem?”
“There isn’t enough space,” Draco said, looking around pointedly at the living room.

McGonagall takes out a set of blueprints. “Over the last few weeks, a number of our very own students and staff have been working on a revised layout for Hogwarts, taking input and requests from many of you. We will continue to revise it as we go. But this is what the final Hogwarts will largely look like.”
Pansy whispers into Draco’s ear. “I think he wants to be corrupted.”

Once everyone is standing, Draco puts away all the blankets and cushions and quilts. Together, they leave the Forest. Harry has somewhat recovered, as he hands out some pre-prepared hot drinks from his picnic basket.

Aster nudges dark green hair out of their eyes. “Firstly, you missed lunch,” they say, pushing a basket into his stomach. “Blaise collected that for you, by the way.”
Harry says.

They both lapse into an awkward silence.

Draco checks over the bundled-up Slytherins before opening the entrance for them.

The original tables have been transfigured together into one giant rectangular table, much like the long tables in the Great Hall, except their chairs are a lot more comfortable. Blaise and Jamie, and surprisingly, Potter, have liaised with the house-elves to produce a banquet of food. There are turkey roasts and nut roasts, yorkshire puddings and tarte tatins, Christmas puddings and yule log cakes and gingerbread and mince pies...
The Ministry team sends out a press release, informing the public to: “

Harry’s eyes flicker to him. “And Merry Christmas to you, too.” But his tone is more distant than cheeky. He gives Draco a faint smile. “Aren’t you going to wake Pansy and Blaise so you can open a present?”
As Draco snaps out another shield, he knows that it’s only a matter when one of Garren’s spells lands on a bystander.
Ignoring the flushed embarrassment on Harry’s face, Draco lifts him and heads up the stairs. Harry remains quiet, not speaking until Draco sets him down on their large bed.
“Very well,” he says. “You may remain in the Commons, and I’ll request your professors for any work.”
Some students take out their musical instruments and start to play: piano and violin and flutes, and some overexcitable students start to sing (read: Jamie). In the relaxed atmosphere, some students set up daring games.

The badges will have to be given out to most vulnerable students first: the Slytherin First Years. There are not many Slytherin First Years, making the few that entered his House all the more precious, regardless of their blood status.
Draco smirks in response. He hands a piece of meat to one of the meeker thestrals, who hasn’t approached Draco yet.  “That’s right, eat up, and get big and strong like your evil herd leader,” he tells it. He stares directly back at another thestral that’s being a bit greedy. “I have my

"merlin you two are so married" pansy spitting straight facts i don't know why draco and harry are mad 🙄
“Draco-” Harry started. “SHUT UP!” Draco yelled “shut up shut up!” Draco sneered at Harry.
Draco caught on immediately. “No!” Draco shook his head, but it was true. When Harry rejected him, he was devastated, and his family was so disappointed in him for not convincing ‘The Great Harry Potter’ to join Slytherin. It was all his fault and his father made sure he knew that. Draco dreaded going home for Christmas that year, he knew his father would beat him right as he walked through the doors.
Harry was astonished, this wasn’t a game anymore, Draco actively wanted to kill him. Harry watched Draco’s thin frame heave as Draco breathed. Draco’s eyes were full of fire and malice. The power in Harry’s wand made Draco drunk with energy.
Harry wrapped his pinky finger around Draco’s and kissed his hand. “Promise” Harry said. Draco didn’t fully understand the muggle gesture, but accepted it anyway. Draco leaned forward and kissed Harry, “I want you” Draco whispered into Harry’s ear. Harry kissed Draco as their bodies melted together. Draco’s back is to the bed, they lay on top of each other. Draco felt safe with Harry laying on top of him, Harry kissed his neck softly, and caressed his face. Draco felt himself getting back into the flow of things, it felt surreal to exist here with Harry. He spread Draco’s legs and placed them over each of Harry’s shoulders. Harry grinded into Draco making him gasp. Their bodies went red with heat, and blood rushed to their eager sex. Harry removed both of their boxers and started pumping Draco’s cock gently. Draco grew hard in Harry’s hand, he moaned and rolled his hips. Harry started slowly lubing Draco’s entrance. Harry’s first finger slid in easily, breaching Draco’s sensitive ring of nerves. Draco let out a whimpered moan as Harry played with his sensitive entrance. Draco’s cock got harder as Harry pumped him faster, and his ass got stretched. Harry leaned forward, and Draco’s legs spread open more as he was trapped on Harry’s shoulders. Harry made out with Draco sensually. Draco’s pelvis lifted off the bed and Harry got a better angle to finger fuck Draco. Draco moaned into the kiss, and his body squirmed under Harry. Harry added another finger and pumped into and out of Draco’s ass. Draco’s body grew hot and aroused, his body eagerly taking Harry’s fingers and his cock taking the persistent stroking. Draco broke the kiss and gasped and moaned loudly. “Fuck me, please.” Draco whined. Harry complied as his throbbing erection was getting impatient. Harry removed his fingers and used his hand to line up his cock to Draco’s eager, throbbing entrance. Draco whined as Harry pressed his tip to Draco. The pressure built until his cock breached through Draco's tight sensitive ring of nerves. “Fuck,” Draco moaned loudly. Harry felt as if he could cum instantly, Draco’s body tightened and relaxed around Harry’s cock. Harry thrust into Draco slowly, going in an inch and pulling out to the tip and thrusting back in an extra inch each time. Draco felt surprised by Harry’s length as each thrust plunged into him deeper and deeper. Harry leaned back and grabbed Draco’s waist with both hands. Harry fucked Draco fast and hard, pumping his cock in and out of Draco harshly. Draco covered his mouth as he screamed and moaned. “You like that?” Harry spoke breathily and he fucked Draco, rocking his body. Draco’s legs lolled back and forth and he stranded his toes as he was fucked. “Y-y-yes.” Draco choked out as Harry’s thrusts broke his reply. Harry held Draco’s thighs and slowed his thrusts. Draco leaked cum as Harry fucked him deep and hard. Harry’s cock explored the depth of Draco’s ass as Harry thrusted tip to base. Harry felt himself getting close, but he took his time as he could feel Draco's body getting to the edge. Harry leaned in close and  picked up speed again. Draco’s hands grasped at the skin of Harry’s back. Draco’s hips were raised high and Harry has the perfect angle to fuck Draco deeper than before. He leaked pre cum into Draco and continued to fuck him. Draco’s tight ass stretched over Harry’s cock. He pumped in and out of Draco, his balls slapping Draco’s bare skin. Draco used his good hand and pumped himself to orgasm, shooting cum onto both of their chests. Harry felt Draco’s asshole clenched around him and he came into Draco’s ass. Harry gasped as he came hard. He pulled out a little and thrust hard as the second wave of cum flooded Draco’s insides. Draco felt the warm seed fill his body. They both collapsed onto each other, exhausted. They both breathed heavily as they recovered. Then Harry kissed Draco’s cheek and smiled into his hot and sweaty skin.
Draco felt reassured, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that Harry would walk out of here and expose him to the school.
“That's it?” Harry was thoroughly amused. He had never had a true conversation with Draco since… since they first met, when Draco was getting his robes done as a first year.
Draco held his arm defensively but didn’t make a move. Something inside him fired up, he hated Potter! Nothing could stop him from hating him.
Harry spoke, “If I accepted your friendship, what would have happened.”
Draco leaned against a pile of junk and rested. He had a new fear of Potter. He was crazy and Draco couldn’t help but relive the fight over and over. Draco’s head hitting the ground hard. Harry’s hands viciously grabbing at his shirt and arms. Harry almost had Draco pinned down. Draco could still feel Harry’s hands on him.
“Who doesn’t” Draco said, and Harry laughed, actually laughed. Draco had never seen Harry laugh, it sent blood rushing to his face. He didn’t like being trapped between Harry’s arms. Harry didn’t speak again and they stood in silence.
“You’re bloody feral! Get off of me you freak!” Draco screamed. Draco was ten times better than Harry at magic, but Harry was physically stronger, and right now he was in Harry’s domain. Harry fought defensively, he got his hands on both wands and ripped them out of Draco’s hands. Draco landed a solid kick into Harry’s chest and wiggled free, and swiped a wand from Harry’s hand. He ran as fast as he could and hid, only to realize he had Harry’s wand and not him own.
“Draco stop this.” Harry spoke, holding out his hands “it’s over.”  he spoke.
“Draco,” Harry couldn’t look away from Draco’s glorious body. Draco felt his eyes on him and relished the attention.
“Let me go!” Draco burst and tried to push Harry away. Harry grabbed Draco’s arms and brought him into a tight hug to immobilize him. Draco whimpered as Harry harshly grabbed his injured arm, then held him tight. Draco’s face fit neatly into Harry’s neck, and he let out a  breathy gasp at the contact. He couldn’t fight Harry, it was not worth the energy anymore. Harry’s hand rubbed the small of Draco’s back and the other held his shoulder. Draco hadn’t been hugged like this since childhood. It brought him closer to the edge, he wanted to scream and cry and punch Harry.  Draco started uncontrollably sobbing into Harry’s skin
“STUPIFY!” Harry yelled. The spell hit Draco right in the chest, sending him flying. Harry paused as he heard Draco’s body hit and Draco’s screaming fill the room. All of Harry’s anger disappeared in an instant, replaced by real fear.
“Your quite pathetic Potter, I expected more from you.” Draco put on a relaxed confident face, but all Harry saw was fear. Harry was disarmed and exposed.
“You don’t understand,” He sobbed. Draco’s eyes met Harry’s gaze. “They’ll kill me.” He choked out. Draco’s body trembled, Harry thought he was about to faint from how pale Draco went. Harry rushed close and held Draco in his arms. Draco screamed and tried to push him away. “No, NO, he’ll kill me, the Dark Lord, my father, he, he-” Draco choked on his own breath. Draco’s legs failed him and he fell deeper into Harry’s arms. He wrapped one arm around Harry’s back, grasping for anything to hold onto. All Draco could see was his Father beating him with his cane, all the death eaters looking at him like a diseased rat that snuck into their homes. ‘Dispose of him,” he heard the dark lord say. ‘Useless boy,’ ‘weak.’ Draco stopped crying, he was paralized, he couldn’t breathe, he was gasping for air. He felt like he was dying. Harry slowly lowered him to the floor, his voice panicking
“You should have.” Draco spoke softly.
A moment passed.
“Why do you hate me so much?” Harry coaxed, boxing Draco in so he couldn’t run away. Harry placed his hands on the wall level with Draco’s neck. Harry scanned Draco with his handsome green eyes.
One of the Gryffindor boys laugh. “If you’re not a baby Death eater, then you’re a werewolf. I heard you Slytherins holed up in your dungeons the entire Winter Break. You should go back there, we don’t want to see your face.”
“Darling Harry, can we eat? I skipped breakfast.”
“If any of you wish to come back with myself and Harry, please do. We have breakfast tables down in the Slytherin Commons.”
much? Have you no sense of jealousy?” Draco responds.
“You hate all muggle stuff, I know.”
Harry faltered for a moment, but then firmly nodded. “I think this one.”
“I’m not too heavy?” Harry asked.
Slytherin ultimately wins, but then Jamie Ottley has the idea to lead a chant of “Good game Slytherin! Good game Ravenclaw!”, which then gets shortened to “G G Rins! G G Claws!”

Gently, Draco repeated, “I can set up a publishing company for you.”

Malfoy stepped close to him, protecting him from the wind and foot traffic around them. He had his scarf in his hands, and he slowly wrapped it around Harry. Malfoy’s gaze was serious and each movement was deliberate and careful, as though he was arranging the scarf on a model, not on little old Harry.
“Yes, of course,” Griffiths says politely. “Is that all? Then, let us begin rebuilding!”
And Slytherin.
There are a lot of goblins, and they’re all glaring at Harry.

“Look,” Official #3 says, “That Slytherin Building is still standing...on Hogwarts ground.”
“...Why isn’t he waking up?” Harry grumbles.

Garren’s eyes immediately darken when he sees Draco, but he pulls a forced smile when Blaise greets him.

In Draco’s eyes, the traces of Slytherin’s magic remaining are particularly distinct. Visible cracks have already begun to appear.
Draco bits back a growl at Blaise’s provocation. “Don’t underestimate me again, understood? Not even Harry Potter can take
McGonagall is half furious, half stunned. “I do not agree! Mr Malfoy, put that

the purpose of soul orbs,” Draco says. “They were originally developed to be used on dying wizards. They were going to die regardless, and thus thought useful to harvest their magic before it dissipates back to the earth. Turning it to other uses is simple. The main bottleneck is the creation of these orbs requires expensive materials, time, and skill. And they can only be used once.”
Harry gives him a silly grin and wraps his arms around him.
Harry pouts. “No, you’re not allowed, Draco! Schedule it for tomorrow instead, I’ll be fine by then…I mean it. Or else, give me a pepper up and some coffee.”
“There’s my work. My taxes. Presents for upcoming birthdays.” Malfoy’s lips thin. “This

sneaky of you,” Pansy says. “I approve.”
Harry pours her a cup of coffee with a lot of sugar and milk, and he gets a big grateful look from Pansy. Meanwhile, Draco gets a disdainful look.
Pansy’s eyebrows now go right up. Her lips curve into a smirk. “Is that so?” She nudges Draco.

“Speak, or forever hold your silence,” Draco prods him.
Harry stares at Draco with narrowed eyes for a moment long. “Go, I

Draco’s shoulders tense. “Don’t bother,” he says, “Dear Professor Garren is not worth it.”

Although she fixed the spellwork last night, she checks them again.
I don’t want Potter to be my parent at the parent-teacher interview!
Mary Green grits her teeth. “Yes, Madame Pomfrey,” she forces out. She throws one last annoyed look at the dark trees in the Forest, but ultimately leaves.
Harry’s eyes widened. “I love you too.”
“They’ll be hypocrites!” Nolan protests. “They want to remove Slytherin anyway! We’re doing them a favour, they owe us!”
“I was thinking of starting a family,” Pansy said in a quiet voice.
“Yes, sir.”
Draco interrupts Harry’s ramblings with a kiss and a little nibble. Kisses trail over Harry’s face, down to his ear.
to the basilisk: Tell the speaker-not-prey-but-will-be-prey-very-soon to NOT TELL the gameskeeper!
Harry says nothing, his grin widening. Draco’s lips also start to curl up unknowingly.
“Yes?”
As the moon rises higher, Harry yawns. Draco takes this as a sign to start winding down for the night.
Jamie immediately leaps off the sofa. “Mr Malfoy! How about now? It’s later now!”
: Okay!
“What if she wants to host a party, or just more space to run around,” Hermione points out.
“Granger. We should talk.”
“You are!”
Nolan drops his head. “...I don’t mind if it’s you, but
“Just go fucking harder,” Harry said hoarsely.
Draco’s eyes widen slightly at the unexpected move.
“I know,
Harry makes a face. “
“The wound transfer meant that a death-killing fall was divided up between Aster and myself, leading to neither of us dying.”
“Since the
With short movements, Draco summons a separate quilt for the other students a few meters away from him, and levitates over the leftover plates of meat to them. For good measure, he casts a strong warming charm.
“It’s fine.”
And when he caught Harry’s eye across the hall, he couldn’t help but smile back.
The Vice Minister hurries to Minister Shacklebolt’s office, only to find him gone.
The four Eighth Year Slytherins gather in their dorm room. After Draco tells the context to Blaise and Harry, Harry makes a grumpy expression.

“You’re a champ, Harry,” Charlie said.
The Manor stirs in ripples of magic as the fundamental wards return to life. Narcissa releases the spell with a slow exhale. It’ll take days yet before all the wards re-establish, all the while leaving the Manor vulnerable.
Robards thinks.
“Ugh, you
, look at you, you can barely keep your eyes open!” In exasperation, Draco grabs Harry’s wrist and starts dragging him up to the dorms.
Draco pressed a number of kisses on the back of Harry’s head, hugged him tight, and went to sleep.
: I know, right? Aren't they so cool!
?” Harry protests.
Draco’s head was near Harry’s. His voice was low and husky, with a drawl that was now indulgent rather than annoying. It would change slightly as he acted out the different characters.
And finally,
Draco leans close to Harry, and whispers. “It’s the full moon.”
Nolan grumbles, but he obeys Draco and goes for a run...in what appears to be a star shape, in that he keeps running back to the clearing, then away again.
. The dragon form means that I heal faster. And that my temperature runs warmer.”
Harry comes up behind Draco. Draco turns around to him and repeats, “I was never jealous of Ginerva.”
Malfoy’s still a prick. Just a lot faster of a prick.” He leans back in his chair.
“Unless you were leaning back on your chair,” Jones says darkly. “And O’Conor said we’ll be transfiguring stones next lesson? What if those stones un-transfigure? Hogwarts will break

Draco leaves, inwardly rolling his eyes. Garren tries so hard to be threatening, but his sense of existence is extremely weak. Even the students dressing up as Aegis are more interesting to Draco.
the only one who can deal with me efficiently.”
“I didn’t know that was a muggle custom. But you’re not Christian and this room isn’t new,” Harry says, confused. “...Do you want to conduct a ritual in every room instead?”
Next week. That was a long time away… Harry was now retroactively grateful for the fact that Draco had spent the night.
Narcissa looks at his outstretched hands in silence.
Malfoy nodded solemnly. “Sweet dreams.” His slight smirk was the last thing Harry saw.
“If you make even half of what unauthorised biographies of me make, you’ll be rich,” Harry says.
Pansy starts to laugh. “Very good! Finally!”
“It doesn’t count! You can’t do that!”
Something like Blaise’s voice echoes magically,
Potter glances at him and mumbles, “Of course you would say that.” He re-adjusts his robes and runs a hand through his hair hiding the redden tips of his ears.
Draco curses. He glances back across the bedroom—Pansy, Blaise, and Harry are still sleeping. In the rooms beyond, the other Slytherins are sleeping. Their bonds tug his chest. He shouldn’t leave them.
. Okay! I agree.”
“That my parents are still alive, not in Azkaban. While many other parents are dead.”
,” more than one goblin says, and there’s more than one glint of a steel blade from the guards.
“Has someone tampered with the anti-tripping charms on the stairs?”
“Anyone else coming to the Great Hall?” Draco calls. Some of the students milling around the Slytherin Commons walk over to him, bringing with them a sharp tang of iron. Draco’s gaze narrows in on Jamie Ottley.
Draco scans over the front page news—speculations about Greyback’s movements and yet another rehash of the Greyback’s involvement with the Death Eaters during the war. On the human interest page though, there’s an article about Potter along with a grainy picture of them with Lovegood.
“I do.” He leans in, but before he kisses Draco, he jumps back onto his broom. “Catch me if you can!”
Just like that, a whole week of Greyback’s memories disappear. It’s a shame that Greyback won’t have nightmares about Draco...but needs must. After all, they can’t have the Aurors learning about their pre-arranged meeting.
Draco comes along, allowing everyone to gather in the rose garden which remains as opulent as it was during Valentines. Once everyone enters the enclosed area, Draco seals the rose wall again and casts a second privacy charm over everything.
Draco’s shoulders are tense. He can hear all the hushed gossip about
The lights burn brighter.
“We can share!” That now decided, Harry happily licked his ice cream. It misted in the cold air outside, and after he got around the weirdness of a hot ice cream, Harry enjoyed the spiced and sweet treat.
Draco narrows his eyes. There is something a little
The water was already hot and waiting for him, as were the huge fluffy white towels and pyjamas just for Harry that Draco had bought a few weeks ago.
Potter’s staring at him again with an odd look on his face. He’s also standing there doing nothing.
Draco smiles pitying at Garren. In Draco’s chest, he’s aware of all the bonds with his Slytherins. He knows all those who are watching their duel, including the portraits. If Garren is so willing to reveal how badly he failed, who is Draco to stop him?
“Don’t forget to bring your homework,” Malfoy says, turning away with his pile of papers.
brilliant.
If only Pansy knew about this development…
: Draco nibbles on Harry's ⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛.
Draco looks up. “Ready to leave?”
“Ohmygod, do you think they’re getting back together?”
“In fact, Draco also made these,” Harry added, pointing to the tray that Ron was slowly devouring.
Harry whines when he pulls out, but needs must. He lifts Harry up and takes them to the bathroom to clean up. After that, they return to the bedroom and Draco applies a healing balm to Harry and wraps them both up inside the quilt.
Well, you don’t have to be too exact but still…”
“Draco.” Blaise strides towards him, his robes flaring behind him. “Harry.”
“Who? Why haven’t I heard of this? Don’t tell me it’s a
Who dares to attack Slytherin?
Harry sneaks a look at Draco. His heart skips a beat when he accidentally meets Draco’s gaze.
The Unspeakable says softly, “You have no separated Slytherin, have you? That’s why the Sorting Hat still thinks Slytherin is a part of Hogwarts.” He draws his wand. “Don’t stop me, Headmistress, or you will be reported for obstructing the law and removed for your post.”
“AH, MR MALFOY! What a coincidence!” Hagrid’s voice carries across the grounds. He walks in big strides over to them. After a round of “Hello, Professor!” and “Hello, everyone!”, Hagrid holds up a large poster that is clearly an enlarged picture from the
“I fed them breakfast,” Draco says coolly. “You can ask Professor Hagrid and Harry Potter.”

“Unfortunately, I still require another hour on this assignment,” Draco says. “Is it that you—or Pansy—are unable to sleep without me?”
He ignores Mr Malfoy’s mutter of, “
“He’s projecting,” Pansy says with an amused tone. “Did you do your homework?”
—Except, it isn’t. (Well, they do live happily ever after, but they don’t know that yet.)
Draco’s voice breaks Harry’s thoughts.
This makes the Slytherins one of the first to move back into Hogwarts castle, after the house-elves with their newly completed kitchen and living space and after some of the paintings and Hogwarts ghosts.
Sirius hugged him. That hadn't happened in a long time. When they were little, and their mother used a riding crop to correct their manners, they hugged each other in his room. But eventually those blows stopped coming, and Sirius said hugging was for little girls.
-But he's possessed!
-Oh… That was because of a family tradition, a silly and stupid thing.
Someday the Black heir would be born from her womb, she was sure of that
Magnolia was grateful to Draco, he had saved her from war. Following Dumbledore's death, Draco had drugged Magnolia with the Living Dead Filter and taken her to the Malfoys' Gringots chamber. She was looked after while unconscious by the goblins, in exchange for a fee.
Harriet's hands had traced her back so many times that the man was surprised they hadn't already memorized it. Before he could withdraw any more, Harriet squeezed her butt with her hands and hit her.
The Potters possess many secrets and treasures as an ancient and noble family. But there is one in particular that they would die to protect. His most adored and sweet secret
-Alpha… -Her voice of hers was also adorable
Duels were an old-fashioned way of resolving conflicts, but they weren't in disuse at all. Draco Malfoy had once challenged Harriet to a duel for accidentally making him bald. The duel was tough, but Harriet won.
-She will be… Talking to the house elves. She will be asking you to take good care of you- James smiled calmly before following the others
- And why didn't James tell me about her? We are best friends!
Of course, said best friend didn't have to know that Sirius and his wife had been dating for a week. Like said best friend's wife didn't need to know that Sirius and James had slept together one day when they were drunk.
-My Alpha is Draco Malfoy. My muggle relatives abused me and the Malfoys took my custody thanks to the laws.
Harriet grabbed the portkey with Draco and felt instantly dizzy. For the emotion and the nerves
- James, you've come. - The voice was lively and sing-song. James knelt before the young woman in the room and began to kiss his hands.
Walburga got up and called out to Kreacher, the elf his father had gifted him with when it was decided they would not live in the ancestral Black mansion.
After making sure that Green is truly running back for the Gryffindor tents, Draco returns to the clearing and slips back into the blanket nest as though nothing is wrong, and pulls Harry closer to him.
: *obediently* Yes, father!
, I thought it would be awkward if we slept with you,” she says. She points to the other door. “Your bed and bathroom is through here. And I have this—” She summons a large pillow with Draco’s image on it. “This has a Long Lasting Warming Charm.” Pansy sighs sadly. “I’ll have to use this as a replacement for you.”
A foreboding fills McGonagall’s heart. She rises to her feet. “Mr Malfoy, Ms Parkinson, Mr Zabini, Mr Potter…”

“—Therefore, I hope that the Ministry will be swift in dealing with the registration. The four Houses of Hogwarts will rise once more.”

“And I’m Maira’s best friend!” Kim says firmly.
The student shrieks, turning around. It’s Mary Green, Gryffindor, wearing in black clothing with a camera in one hand and a

Draco slowly puts on the robes his Slytherins have gifted him and calls a House-wide meeting to tell them what he wants to do.
“Malfoy!” Potter exclaims, sounding completely unsurprised.
“Yes.”

If any, Hagrid’s smile grows even brighter. He sets down his buckets of meat. “I’ve lunch for these beauties, so you two are just in time to feed them!”
Hitchly’s eyes suddenly spark, a sly smile growing on his lips. “If Potter wants to help catch Greyback...then let him help. Listen to me…”

Harry grabs Draco’s hand, pressing it down on his head. “You know, since we started dating, you don’t insult my hair anymore…” Harry smirks. “Because you
Sometimes their cocks rub against each other, sometimes they rub against stomachs and groins. Either way, Harry’s mind grows blank as a whiteness of pleasure starts to override his thinking.
“Once a week is not enough. Send me your schedule and I’ll see what other days I can come by. Today, I have to leave at 10:30.”
“And for that, I’m
“We should finish our assignments,” Michelle agrees, nodding.
Back in the Slytherin Commons, the other students are waiting anxiously.
Harry stumbled to a stop, tilting his head up to look at Malfoy in confusion. He shivered as the cold wind blew across his neck. The leather jacket had no collar.

Draco finally arrives at the standoff. “Nolan, come here.”
“Ah!” Harry nearly jumps.
But among Harry’s close friends who had access to his home, none of them were particularly great cooks. Ron was too enthusiastic: he changed recipes as he pleased, adding
Draco doesn’t have time to argue. The two of them rush to get dressed. In the clatter, Blaise and Harry wake up.

Charlie Weasley glanced at Harry first before following Draco’s instruction.
“I don’t read their rubbish.”
“I’m fine.” Aster’s voice is thin and high, as though they can’t breathe enough air. “It hurt at first but it doesn’t anymore—”
Pansy steps aside, allowing Hagrid to step out. Hagrid opens the box and a large soft dragon as big as him pops out.
In Potions class, Garren’s eyes are cold and angry, tracking Draco’s movements as he works with Potter on their assigned potion. When class ends, he tells Draco to stay back. Potter diligently stays as well, trying to take on the role of protector seriously.
Draco’s eyes cut towards the strike—the other stands.
Draco leaps down from his broom, landing right between Laurel Gardiner and his Slytherins. Gardiner stumbles back.
“...You’ll only agree if I play with the kids?”

Unfortunately, by the end of the day, Draco’s actions have spread through the Hogwarts populace, no doubt initiated by one of the other student werewolves who had seen.
While Professor McGonagall and Madame Pince oversee the Ministry people’s diagnostics of the area, the extended House-unity team meets: everyone on the original team has been tasked to bring at least two other people to join in, and Professor Flitwick is one of them.

“...I am proud of everyone and their efforts to rebuild Hogwarts and the new wizarding society,” McGonagall says. “We all have learnt stereotypes and false truths, that are so ingrained that we may have a first negative reaction to others. However, that first reaction does not control you. Thoughtful consideration in conjunction with common civility will help build a more tolerant society…”

But if Malfoy inherited Garren’s wand’s allegiance, then what else did Malfoy inherit?

“Grown-up things, like carrots,” Harry says, tickling Teddy. Teddy squeals with laughter and jumps off the swing.

Harry’s smile broadens. “Yeah, they have an in-built paw-activated warming charm! Just squeeze his cute little paw…”
Harry jabs Draco in the side.
Draco rubs his temples. As the Head of Slytherin, he is responsible for the wellbeing of the students under his wings. “On the weekend,” he says sternly. “Everyone here needs to go back and do their schoolwork, and

“Was it interesting?”
Draco stopped dating after that. It was pointless. If, and when, the time came for him to have an heir, he’ll just find a surrogate. Even better—he’ll just incubate the child himself with the new medimagical technology.
...ah. Draco knows why. But he plays ignorant, answering no to all her questions. She finally casts a number of healing spells, hands him some dittany, and tells him on no uncertain terms that he’s to stay put in the bed.

In the afternoon, Minerva has tea with Irma Pince in Irma’s quarters. As the Headmistress, Minerva is particularly sensitive to the fluctuations at Hogwarts. But what she doesn’t know is whether there is any precedent.

Harry shoves some more tart into Draco’s mouth. “We’re still in school, Malfoy.”
Harry coughed guiltily. “Um. About that...”

Draco nods, not flinching when Narcissa pulls out a small diamond blade. As the focuser, Narcissa draws her blood first, and then Draco’s. The Manor’s heartstone soaks it up in an instant. Giving up his magic to his mother is instinctual at this point. He feels the way it flows from him to her, how she shapes it before letting it flow into Malfoy Manor.

It works like a charm, and Harry ignores Ron’s calculating looks between him and Malfoy. Best-out-of-three quickly becomes best-out-of-five, out-of-nine. They play twice every weekend, and on one of those days, Malfoy kits himself in a new set of quidditch leathers.
“And what’s up with you and Malfoy?” Weasley complains.
Flitwick becomes grave. “I see. Help me bring them to the Hospital Wing, and tell me exactly what happened…”
While some Aurors get to be present—guards to various Ministry visitors, especially Kingsley Shacklebolt—Hitchly can only sit in the office as a desk Auror after his demotion.

Pansy leans back on the sofa she’s sitting on, tilting her head slightly. “Ah, back so soon?” she asks with a little smirk.

Harry flushes.
Except, after the rather minor dragon incident (in the grand scheme of the War, it was hardly the most illegal or questionable thing Harry and his friends had done), withdrawing galleons is an exercise in frustrations. Harry’s last visit must have been months ago, where the guards poked at him, and none of the goblin tellers wanted to serve him, until finally a group of them did a prickly magical security search before
-Yes, blacks are one of the most extended families in the wizarding world- Draco kissed Harriet's forehead and blew her bangs to see the smooth skin- My mother will accept you better than my father because you have the same blood. In addition, your godfather is the heir to the Black house and, having no children, she has named you the heir to her house. And the Potter house is also very old and powerful. In terms of background, you are an excellent wife.

My daughter of magic and spirit, you who defeated death itself when it came to claim you, your name will be Lelwani Arate, the name of the Hittite goddess of the underworld.
Walburga just had a cookie
Severus followed the girl's back closely. Even when the tunnel moved she just kept smiling, like she knew exactly where to go. Even though her tracking spells were failing she moved as if following one. But it was impossible
-Well, I had not noticed that Magnolia's hair is slightly bluish in the light- the children tensed and Magnolia clung to the end of one of her braids- It's beautiful, you should let it loose
-Nice to meet you, Magnolia. It's a pleasure to see you again, Andromeda
-Is that your new friend Tom?
-Alice and Frank only have Neville. The Potter line would be extinguished unless one of their children took the last name from the mother line. On the other hand the Weasleys have many children
Harriet remembered how they had been arguing loudly about the best way to remove the thorns from a rose when she had somehow found herself with her underwear on the floor, her on the table and Draco between her legs.
-What do you know about the phenomenon known as “red magic”?
Ron Weasley had the honor of being the one who spread the rumor
Harry blinked as he looked at the train station. There were several trains waiting
---------------------------------
-You shouldn't talk to that boy- Hagrid looked at Rose Marie who was cooing the snowy owl they just gave her- He's a Malfoy
- We fight everyone, Rose Marie! - Lee was giving a kind of wax on her dreadlocks-Don't worry. Due to the war there was a decrease in the birth rate. But after the defeat of the dark lord there was a boom in births, so we may soon have more Omegas in school.
She had never imagined her marital life like this a few years ago.
The girls smiled and ran to their mother's store. The attractive woman was calming her youngest baby, the son of another gypsy.
Well… The bad for Albus Dumbledore was that Harriet was now part of the gypsies. Experts in curses and in removing them.
------------------------------
-------------------------------------
On a warm summer night the birth occurred. Euphemia Potter gave birth to James Fleamont Potter and that birth was announced to the entire wizarding world. But also that night was born as James' twin a girl, Heather Lyra Potter.
Harriet's parents had been furious, Ron's parents had been furious, Ron's brothers had been furious, Harriet had been furious, and Ron hadn't cared.
James looked confused
Sirius couldn't remember ever being at Potter Manor, which was weird.
Leanne had dedicated herself to gutting them and was there, reading quietly in her rusty orange silk robe in front of the fire. She hadn't even changed her clothes, she had only washed her hands
It would be fun to see if they were as naughty as the two of them.
Tom took the book and turned its pages curiously. After a few minutes an eerie laughter spread throughout the underground chamber.
-No, it was another girl, you smell like her- he said after moving away
-What?
-Yeah, what kind of sadistic jerk would send kids hunting for horcruxes?
-Is he overprotective?
- Of course it is part of my evil plan, my lord. I spend the hours dreaming and planning to bring you to my bed and to this house- She took a drink from the bottle directly- I couldn't care less what you do and what you think Orion. And you have already made clear how you feel about me. And I feel absolutely nothing towards you. Any possible respect or affection vanished with your treatment of me
Tom Riddle x Female Harry Potter.
-Me too, me too- Heather started to say as she raised her hands
-The problems of your house do not interest me- She closed the letter.
-The fact that he can do things that you cannot does not mean that he is possessed. My decision is firm, I will adopt him.
-Tom, call me Tom or I'll give you another spanking. You don't answer me truthfully so I'll be forced to do this until you do.
Part 8/8, the final!!!
Walburga leaned toward Tom.
A considerably tired brown owl came to the store and alighted outside with the mail. Zefrina took out her wand and looked at the letter
Harriet Potter came from a long line of Gryffindors. From a family of great lineage and tradition, only tainted by the addition of her Muggle-born mother. However, finding the sword a week after classes started raised it to the same position as the Purebloods. Sword that she now wore on her waist with pride, demonstrating her position as a Gryffindor princess
He seemed so far away that she felt alone and lost
Part 4/8
She only wanted to be free like the wind again.
-Slytherin ... There you would have the opportunity to grow and develop your talents, you would reach fame in a way that you have not even dreamed of. You have ambition and cunning. It's all in your head. However, there is another house you could fit into. And if I don't put you in it, Albus has threatened to transfigure me into a shoe for a whole year.
James ran his fingers over the images of magical creatures and beautiful landscapes that decorated the walls. He saw a young elf, less than ten years old, carefully cleaning the game room.
And she got fed up when she saw Ron kiss Lavender Brown
-Sirius, this ... How do you start this?- She whispered as she approached.
Few knew of the girl, since thoroughbred custom indicated that girls would be announced on their sixth birthday in patriarchal families. Only a few Blacks knew of the girl's existence, the most powerful only. And that helped protect her
In the end they went to the dining room
Orion left the room and Harry / Walburga could hear her father-in-law and mother-in-law arguing with their son over her. She sighed and watched as the dress slid off as it was now torn.
Manipulation
------------------------------
-Only you can use the bag and if you don't use them, the unused galleons will be kept in the bag- said the goblin- You were supposed to give this bag to you on the day you turn five, when your parents bring it to the bank . It is an honor to be able to give it to you at last
-Don't say that out loud- she whispered in her ear quickly- The portraits are spies of the director and if he knows that you already have your partner he will keep you away
-Yes, before mommy gave up on you, Grandpa used to bring me here because he said it was good that Heather knew children her age more sensible than James and that you
-Which train do I have to take?
The first to qualify was Draco. Of course he was a Slytherin, Rose Marie clapped, but she was the only one outside Slytherin house who did.
That's why she was taking a walk down Privet Drive at night. Although she was a natural legimens she could restrain her gift, but with such emotion the thoughts of the magicians were like screams in her ears. So she preferred to walk at night in a muggle town
-. He is going to try to get me to marry an Alpha from a light family. - Rose Marie had read of Dumbledore's opinion on destined couples in a newspaper. She was against and said that she took away free will from the Omegas
-She was classified in Gryffindor and he in Slytherin. Even so, they maintained their friendship. I hoped at that moment that one day they would become a connecting link between the two houses. End the conflict. But the young man one day insulted the girl in a moment of rage, he called her Mudblood.
That she couldn't be feminine
-Yes, Director, the cold of winter has not hit us at all.
Severus Snape woke up before dawn and got dressed to go see the greenhouses. There were three. They had told him that he could collect ingredients as long as he did so responsibly
Tom Riddle didn't seem very special, at first. A very pretty boy from a muggle orphanage who had been unlucky enough to end up in Slytherin. The day after the selection ceremony he appeared before his house leader as a parsel speaker, proving that his mother came from the Salazar Slytherin lineage. In his left hand he wore Salazar's ring, as a proud prince of Slytherin
It was not recognized in the wizarding world, but most of them considered sex a waste of time and energy.
Apparently Arcturus was very clear in his feelings towards his daughter-in-law
Tom Riddle was in the secret Slytherin library. The parsel magic books were fascinating and incredibly rare and expensive. Having access to that library found in the chamber of secrets was a joy. But he would soon graduate, so his magic was creating new copies of all the books so he could have them at his fingertips whenever he wanted.
-Good. Go practice the purification magic circle design that we are learning while in Egypt. It is useful to know a lot of magic.
-You know that you are magicians, right? - The two shook their heads
-And there you have the answer why James did not introduce you to Heather
-Draco ... - Magnolia extended her hand towards the boy but he moved further against the window of the car- Draco, what's wrong with you? - At that moment Magnolia realized that it was their first private conversation since Yule's dance with fourteen. years old and now they were eighteen
------------------------------
Harriet hadn't cared about his first girlfriend until Hermione let Ron know how rude he was with her. The girl had brought a book of engagement customs in the Lord's houses and she had then rebuked Ron for insulting her
Of course the thoroughbreds and others were laughing softly. Lelwani felt bored and surprised. Surprised that the newspapers had nicknamed her Harry Potter instead of her full name, so everyone thought she was a boy.
- Professor Snape is still in love, and I think your mother is happy in her own way. But I know they would have been even happier if they had stayed together. Don't repeat their history, make a new path
"Oh… Will I be with you more than Harry?"
A click echoed through her room as she quickly slipped into her everyday robes, preferring Muggle clothing. But that robe was the closest thing he had.
-Yes, her name is Parla- the boy proceeded to whistle and the snake replied- She greets you
There were many like her in the thoroughbred families, who although they were not squibs, were also hidden
He had to protect her
-I understand your anger, but this is for the greater good
Less than three hours later the entire castle was aware of the news that an unidentified Slytherin had been found having sex with a Gryffindor.
-Children, your father and mother were independent researchers at a university- the muggle cover of the members of the order- And they died in an explosion when you were one year old.
-Why have you challenged him?
-Yes Luna, you're right. Also, our marriage agreement makes infidelity on both sides very painful, physically speaking- Magnolia looked out the window at her fiancé who was still chatting with the blushing girl- There is no love there, only mutual benefits
In the end, the incident was not investigated, only the bodies were taken and buried in the cemetery. Millicent played her role as a slow Slytherin girl very well and the Death Eaters bought her in a second.
Draco turned to look at her and raised Magnolia's jaw a little to kiss her, was it weird that the boy tasted like strawberries?
Heather had once told Regulus that the walls were dripping with evil magic like mud. Heather had always been good at telling her which rooms or objects had a curse, something the mother had said they had to learn on their own.
Severus Tobias Snape hated a lot about his Muggle heritage
In the tent in the room of the rented apartment there was a crib with anti-tracking spells in which her daughter was asleep comfortably. Zefrina did not know what the hell that bird was crossed with, but if he saw the girl the lord of shit would know and she would not hear the end
Heather Lyra Potter looked at her twin with a smile before launching into a hug.
How the kindest boy in the world had won a duel against one of the best duelists of the course?
“It’s Dumbledore’s fault I’m with the Dursleys, he probably won’t listen to reason,” Harry says. “And besides, my life doesn’t suck

Lupin nods slowly, “Okay.”
Harry lets out a bark of laughter, “Oh, you are going to regret that.”
“You aren’t going to last very long if you keep coming to Gryffindor’s rescue,” one of the Slytherins, Harry believes his name is Darius Berrow, says.
so by the way, narcissa and lucius know this because they were death eaters, if you didn't get that, because i realize it might be confusing :)

Harry sits down, thinking hard.

Harry grins. “I’ll see you next class, then.”
“James was Genderfluid, yes,” Lupin says quietly.
hedwig and harry make me happy
Lupin lets him think for a long time, but eventually — after they’ve entered the classroom — he interrupts his thought process.
draco is absolutely pissed off that pansy and harry are bffs now but that'll change soon >:)
ron said "let me put a malfoy real quick" and ginny was NOT standing for that shit god she's my queen

Harry nods. With his mind still on his dad, he changes the subject. “I forgive you.”
'and Marcus smiles proudly' god i love this friendship so much it's unhealthy like it's just so cute
anyway

“Because nobody else does.”
“Huh? Oh, nothing,” Harry mumbles, still fuming. “What did you want me for?”

“One moment,” Harry turns back around. “Do I make myself clear?”
also idk if i've said this enough times so i'll say it again: ron stops being a dick. he does. you just gotta power through the initial asshole stage. it changes, i promise.
“And what, I’ll move in with you and we’ll live happily ever after? The end? It’s not that easy, Lupin.”
“I am,” Harry says. “The toys — they were what I played with, back when I

“You really didn’t know?”

“What are you thinking right now?” Lupin asks, setting the picture down on his desk.
marcus 🥺 he and harry have the best bromance in this story i love them so much
He knocks once on Lupin's office door before he enters. He says nothing as he walks up to Lupin desk, even when Lupin says, “Harry! How are you?” He places the picture on Lupin’s desk and steps back.
“I can’t say.”
i hope you all have a good day/night! <3
comments and kudos give me life
i love you all and thank you for all the support! <3
onto my funny notes about everything :)
“Lady Longbottom found a photo album behind her son’s wardrobe,” Harry explains. “She took out the ones of Neville’s parents to give to him and then gave me the rest. I did some research because I was too curious not to but I want you to tell me if I got it right.”
i hope you all have a good day/night! <3

“Sirius is my godfather… you were supposed to raise me if Sirius couldn’t… that the Ministry deemed you unfit to care for me because of something you can’t control…”
please tell me if i need to put any trigger warnings! <3
“So what if I am?” Harry brushes past Lupin to keep walking. Lupin follows him. “It doesn’t matter.”
“You didn’t raise me,” Harry says. “But I forgive you, because I know you feel guilty. It wasn’t your fault you couldn’t raise me, the Ministry…”
