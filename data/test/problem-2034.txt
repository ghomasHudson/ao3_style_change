The expression on Potter’s face turned abruptly grim and somewhat threatening. “It’s none of your business.”
Lucius stood up, the chair creaking against the floor. He walked to the cake, cut three slices, and placed them in his, Draco’s and Narcissa’s plates.
Harry was silent for a moment, pretending to chew and swallow as he thought what to tell her. “Erm, Malfoy was there,” he answered finally.
Instead of meeting in the Room of Requirement, Harry and Draco had agreed to meet at the Boathouse this time. The days were already so short as the darkness arrived early, and no one fancied going out if it wasn’t absolutely necessary. Besides, it had been snowing quite heavily during the past couple of days, so it felt a bit masochistic to even try to get through all the snow. Especially as there was no path to the Boathouse because no one used it during the winter months.
“Alright, alright, I’ll try my best,” Draco said, impatient. “Come here,” he said, reaching out to take Harry’s hand and pulled Harry to sit down next to him.
Both Draco and Blaise stared at Professor Snape’s back and waited until he was so far he was clearly out of the earshot.
“C’moon now, let’s go and send some love messages to your boyfriend,” Ginny said cheerfully, hooking her arm through Harry’s.
“Thank you, Potter. It was truly a pleasure,” Zabini said, clapping Harry on the shoulder before leaving Harry alone in the classroom.
Not that Harry knew what he wanted from Malfoy, either. He knew he was attracted to the git, and his instincts kept screaming for more. More kissing, more touching, more Malfoy in general. Even though they had dutifully ignored each other in Potions, the class had still felt like one of Harry’s highlights that week. He had been so aware of the Slytherin sitting next to him. He had felt Malfoy’s body radiating warmth, startled when Malfoy had accidentally touched his hand once and felt his right cheek tingling when Malfoy had reached for an ingredient for the potion and breathed warmly against Harry’s cheek for a split-second. It all felt so bittersweet because Harry’s mind was clearly pleased with the contact but at the same time, it was never enough. When Harry had been ready with chopping, he had to literally sit on his hands to be able to refrain from leaning against Malfoy and touching the other boy. Harry’s body and mind were sending him clear signals that being around Malfoy and touching him were good, positive, and even amazing things, which made his mind go giddy and his body feel warm and tingling all over. As if Harry’s mind and body were yelling to just go for it. But at the same time, Harry still knew it was Malfoy, so there was definitely something that didn’t add up.
“Even after everything you’ve done,” Andromeda said and took a deep breath. “Besides, I think it’s partly my fault. I was an adult and I knew exactly how you were treated home by your parents and other people in the pureblood circles. I should’ve tried to contact you earlier, I should’ve tried to help you. But I did nothing, I just tried to explain myself it’d have been impossible to reach out to you, but I should’ve tried harder.”
“Enough of seriousness, I want to hear you laugh,” Harry said, turning around so that his arms were on both sides of Draco.
“Yes, he has. He’s been here a couple of times with Andromeda. Such a lovely boy, smiles a lot,” Molly said, a dreamy look in her eyes. “I was actually planning to ask you about Christmas. I had thought that maybe we could ask Andromeda, Teddy, and Draco to join us as they’d celebrate Christmas all by themselves otherwise. And there are not as many of us as there used to be, either,” she continued, the look on her face turning gloomy, thinking probably about her son.
Malfoy looked anxious, but this time he seemed to be able to stay. He took a deep breath a couple of times, eyes closed.
“She may have been young and braver back then. Now there’s no way I could see her doing anything behind my father’s back, let alone fraternizing with an enemy,” Draco said sullenly as he drew lines on Harry’s stomach with his finger.
exactly? I’m afraid even the great Harry Potter might not be able to Disapparate through the wards,” Draco snarled.
!” he went on and winced abruptly as his girlfriend poked harshly at his side with her elbow. “But as I’ve said earlier, I’m not in favour of executions. Not even when they’re about to execute such a slimy bastard as Lucius Malfoy.”
“It might be better if we split. I haven’t been in the dungeons yet as it’s not very likely they’re somewhere there, but I don’t know where else to look anymore. If you go there and I check the area around the kitchens?”
“Sorry, I didn’t mean to push you. That was really stupid of me, there’s already way too much on your mind as it is,” Draco said, babbling nervously. “I just… Are we okay now?”
wandering around the castle after the curfew in the first week,” snarled a too much familiar voice somewhere near Harry. He snapped his eyes open, just to meet Draco Malfoy’s sneering face right in front of his own.
“They’re not joining us for a while. Bet they went to snogging to Ron’s room,” Ginny said, following Harry’s gaze.
“Really Draco? Are you honestly telling me the only reason why you’re not telling me are my lacking skills in Occlumency?” Harry asked, incredulous.
“I… Just drop it, Ron, please. C’mon, let’s grab some toasts. I don’t want to be late for Potions,” Harry said, motioning towards the Gryffindor table.
Harry sighed and laid down on the grass. He took the shampoo, smelled it, and closed his eyes. It did smell almost exactly like Draco, although it was lacking something spicy and essentially Draco-ish, something that was impossible to imitate. Still, right then, Harry could imagine vividly Draco being there with him, laying next to Harry, his hair tingling Harry’s nose and his scent floating in the air all around him.
Draco looked at the horizon and said nothing for a moment. “I don’t know, Harry. Everybody around me has always said Muggles and Muggle-borns are a serious threat to us. And that we’re better than them. I’ve never even considered it could be otherwise.”
After the War it had felt like Harry could spend time with other people only in small doses. He loved his friends and the Weasleys with all his heart but sometimes constant discussion about the War felt too much. When the War had ended, Harry had thought he could finally rest and start to think about more ordinary and shallow things again, but the War was still as present as it had been two months ago in every conversation, in every decision, in every expression and gesture, and in every dream.
“Next time I’ll show you the place I was talking about. We’re both going to catch a cold if we go on like this,” Harry said, tucking a strand of Draco’s hair behind his ear. “Thought maybe we could stay behind when everyone else goes to Hogsmeade on Saturday? At least all my friends are going, I could just say I’m feeling a bit sick or something.”
“Well, well, isn’t that a sweet sight,” Lucius Malfoy snarled, taking a few steps towards Draco and Harry.
"Why are we gossiping about Potter, didn't you see Granger? I didn't almost recognise her at all,” Blaise said hastily before Draco had time to react to Pansy's accusation.
Snape’s short visit at Grimmauld Place had left Harry dumbfounded. Before that, he hadn’t known a thing about Occlumency, though now, having chewed the idea for a while, he kind of got it why he needed the lessons. But having them with
“Are you sure you want to waste this on me? I’ve never drunk wine, I can’t probably appreciate this properly. Or more likely at all.”
“Don’t say you’re sorry. I was mad at you for insulting me about not having a mother. You didn’t ban me from playing Quidditch, it was Umbridge. Besides, she’d have done it anyway, our fight was just a good excuse for her,” Harry said, shrugging. It felt odd to hear Draco apologizing. Draco had never apologized to him before, and now he had done it maybe three or four times during one single conversation.
“What did Dumbledore even think when he decided to make Malfoy a prefect? I mean, even though the candidates in Slytherin aren’t anything to celebrate, there’re always better options than the ferret,” Ron huffed frustrated beside Harry.
The things between Harry and Draco didn’t change a lot after their truce as they still didn’t talk much to each other apart from an occasional ‘hi’ whenever they bumped into one another in the common room. However, Harry could still sense there was definitely
“Erm, I s’pose?” Harry answered, fiddling with his pint, and looking questioningly at Draco who was sitting next to him. He had known Draco had at least mentioned Harry in the group meetings, but he didn’t know how much exactly the other group members knew about them as a unit and their history together.
It wasn’t a success. As soon as Draco freed one of Harry’s hands for a split-second, Harry grabbed Draco’s collar and pulled him into a heated kiss.
“Put these on,” Narcissa said coolly, handing Draco new, completely white dress robes. “Come to the dining room when you’re ready.”
to have some sort of an ulterior motive behind all this fuss, it didn’t make any sense otherwise. They had never even liked Draco. Not that he had ever tried to exactly please them, which made the whole thing seem even more absurd to him.
“Fine, thank you so much for asking,” Draco answered coolly, acting to scrutinise his nails. “We had a very pleasant night.”
“Maybe they are taking a nap?” Ginny said, looking at Harry, puzzled. Andromeda didn’t usually forget their visits.
After half an hour, Harry and Ginny arrived at an almost empty playground. The sun was already setting, casting its last rays of the light for the day. They went to a bench, put their mittens on it and sat down. The bench was so wet and cold their arses would’ve gone numb in a matter of minutes if they didn’t have anything keeping the dampness and coldness away. Oh, the joys of being an underage wizard.
“Hm,” Ginny said, pensive. “As I can’t read his mind I can’t say for sure what he’s thinking, but from what I’ve seen I’m sure he loves you. A lot. I don’t think he’d be able to leave you even if he tried.”
“Don’t you think I won’t get you for this, Potter. I might not be able to dock any points from your oh-so-dear Gryffindor yet, but just wait until we get to school” Malfoy drawled threateningly and straightened his robes before leaving, Grabbe and Goyle following on his heels.
“Don’t let them get you down, it’s exactly what they are trying to do,” Hermione said encouragingly as she scrutinized worriedly her friend.
On the right side of the Room there was a rather huge bed with indigo blue curtains, grey sheets and at least a dozen pillows. For some reason, Harry blushed at the sight of the bed and studiously ignored it after the first glance.
Harry smiled and took Draco’s hand to lead him out of the kitchen. “Yes. C’mon, let’s not keep Molly waiting and thinking there was something wrong with her knitting skills.”
“I’m not sure,” Ginny said, sighing. “He’s still in France, trying to make his mother and his mother’s newest husband come back. I don’t get why his mother is so scared of coming back. There’s no way they’d be thrown into Azkaban.”
All the times they had studied each other’s bodies, wanting nothing more than to know how to make each other gasp and moan and writhe in pleasure. How to be as close to one another as humanly possible.
“Which was you,” Miriam said with a laugh, clearly oblivious to Draco’s chest constricting tighter and tighter with each breath.
“Sure,” Draco sat down heavily, closing his eyes as he leaned against the cool concrete. “Why the fuck not.”
“In the forest, after we escaped from the Ministry. I left them to die, and they almost did. I was weak and petty and selfish, and in my defense a little bit cursed by that fucking demon locket.” He shook his head.
“No, Mer--no. Christ. If anyone was the bully, it was him,” Harry said defensively, and she let out an undignified snort.
“You wouldn’t fancy a pint, would you?” She smiled, and suddenly Draco noticed it didn’t reach her eyes.
He felt his mother before he saw her, the smell of orchids and silk so familiar he rubbed his face against her skirt, too exhausted to move.
“Miriam!” he jumped, almost hitting her head hovering over her. He looked around wildly. “Where is she?”
Draco waited until her breathing evened out, and then waited some more while he figured out what to say. He shut his mouth after a moment. She had called him here anyway.
“Well-- I mean--I don’t need it. Or them. And their quiet condescension. They can take it back the whole lot of them. Malfoy’s don’t take charity, especially the emotional sort.”
Draco saw the red light before it hit her back, but too late to do anything but catch her as she fell. The shriek that came out of him was ungodly, standing there defenseless. He felt the air whoosh past him as he held her body tightly. A menacing, unintelligible whisper followed him as he twisted away from the grassy hill.
“No. It has to be this exact shape.” He realized as he spoke he would need a reason for the particularity. How was Miriam not asking more questions?
“Yes! I--no, of course not, but if it kept you safe I’d kill him and let you hate me in a second.” They were both on their feet now, air crackling.
“I did mention that a Muggle bakery might be a good choice for the party, I’ll admit. I was growing impatient and realized I was being a bit overprotective of you, though they picked Iida out all on their own.” She laughed his favorite laugh again. “As for Weasley, that was a decidedly peculiar choice and entirely against my recommendation, though he was clearly effective.”
“Miriam, I-- are you hurt? Are you all right?” He said, pulling back and looking at her face. Chin a bit scraped up (he thought he’d caught her before she hit the ground), face red, eyes a little hurt and lost but mostly angry. Angry was good. Angry was alive.
“I thought we said we weren’t going to change the look of the pasties?” Draco asked, and Miriam shook her head.
He really should take some of these home for her. She’d be pleased to see his work, and these were just her taste. Gentle bright cherry and earthy wild mushroom, blood oranges in crisp crusts speckled with veiny, crumbly cheese; even the odd Japanese perilla and salmon tea sandwich. All Mr. Iida’s creations. All heavenly.
“Yes, I’ve noticed. Get out. Miriam is coming in later today to start on the cake layers, so she can do the rest. Good for her to have a bit of extra work for once in her life.”
He looked mournfully at the half-prepped apples, but went back with renewed determination. He could always just eat the middling slice, he realized, and it was halfway to his mouth before a strong manicured hand snatched it from his grip. He startled.
“Close your eyes please, I’m going to use this scanner and the light could hurt your eyes. Just standard procedure, nice deep breaths please” he said, whipping his wand out as soon as her eyes closed and drawing clear, steady lines.
“Miriam, my dear girl, I’ve heard so much about you. I’m so sorry we had to meet like this,” Narcissa said smoothly, sweeping past her son to embrace his friend. Miriam hugged his mother out of reflex, and found herself seated on the settee-- hang on, was that there--and Narcissa looked at Harry meaningfully.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about. You must have the wrong person. My name is Mallory. Am I correct in assuming you’re the one making the absurd demand to create an entirely new pastry in the next two days?” He said coolly, hoping his eyes wouldn’t betray his desperation. She winced, turning to Miriam.
Every time, he told himself, ‘Harry, this will be your last.” And every time, he found himself there. Again.
Draco blanched. Iida hadn’t closed a single day. Ever. It was a point very well-hammered into Draco’s psyche from the interview on. Keeping tradition was important. Draco understood.
She was right. Draco was very, very good at this. Years of practicing delicate cuts, exacting stirs, and potentially fatal reactions made him a perfect fit for the fiddly, gastronomic precision that was Iida’s main business. It was the best patisserie this side of Paris (including some of them besides), and all Draco lived for. Well, most of it anyway, besides his mother.
Once again, his mouth seemed to race ahead of his brain, and he said, ‘yes’ when he was rather sure he’d meant to say ‘no’.
Miriam rolled her eyes. “You are wasted as a baker, my little Cumberbatch. You can’t fight the drama, can you?”
“Now off you fuck. If Draco catches us out here, we’ll both be murdered in our beds.” She stood up, smiling lopsidedly.
, something respectable, something he’d thought he could at least slightly enjoy, after weeks of coming home with the stench of Peri Peri making him nauseous.
“Good crisp,” she said, eyes twinkling and back bent in her best (read: terrible) Mary Berry impression. “A bit underdone it looks like, though the color looks--”
“She’s in the infirmary with Tilly. Harry tried to bring you as well but I told them I’d take care of you,” she said with a gentle urgency, and Draco forced his eyes to look at her, to notice everything. Her wand on the floor. No blood anywhere, so no splinching. The way her eyes held concern but not despair. Not fear. Miriam was all right.
He nodded forlornly, eyes downcast, and was suddenly encompassed in warm softness. Arms encircled his shoulders, and he melted into the felten cloud of old cigarette smoke and cheap ALDI fabric softener.
He put as much hatred into his glare as he possibly could, raising a shaky two finger salute as he tossed his coffee remains into the bin. She just laughed.
“Then just be out with it and have fucking done, will you?” Draco stood a little taller, crossing his arms. The man fidgeted under his steel gaze.
“No, I don’t hate you, fuck’s sake. Not my favorite discovery, I must say, but-- I’m a bit in shock, yeah? Not every day this shit comes at you.”
“Right. Yes. Of course. Erm, well, I got the call from Draco that my dad had erm… kicked him out for being useless-- he’s not usually, though, Mrs. Malfoy, he’s quite good-- and I walked out of Liams--my boyfriend’s flat. Bummed a cigarette by Belsize Park station, near the organic shop? From a friend in my band? Talked for a mo’, then went up the damn thing to talk to Draco, and then… was there a red light? Like a flash? Did a car back into us? Did a sniper try and hit us and miss?” A realization came over her.
Miriam met drunkenly accusatory green eyes with brown eyes full of enough pity and disgust that Harry immediately put his head in his hands.
He sighed as he changed his shirt, and again when he went out the door; he sighed in the barely awake line for posh coffee, and again when he binned the empty cup.
“Bit shit of a doctor, not reading the file,” she said, smirking. “But yeah still a bit sore in the lower back. Draco caught me mostly before I hit the ground, I think. Is that,” she turned to Draco, and he nodded.
“Bit early today, aren’t we,” He drawled through the juice. “Are you planning to actually accomplish anything, or simply lure unsuspecting young men into your talons?”
She brightened, and the familiar sound of her non-stop chatter lifted his spirits. This was familiar territory-- work, local, kebab, bed. He let himself settle into her stories and his cider.
He arrived back at Iida in much the same condition he left it, bag still in the front where he’d dropped it.
“Well then. Thank you, Mr. Mallory. I look forward to seeing the final product. This is-- it’s a very important night, you see. We need to show people that the old ways are no longer necessary, that we can mix together all sorts and take care of those of us who make mistakes. We normally wouldn’t be out--” she glanced at Miriam. “--here. But… well… you’re the best,” she said, slightly out of breath from all the atrocious subtext.
“Fuck. Sorry, love, this was supposed to be a pint and a chat,” Miriam said, clearing his throat and dabbing at her eyes. He shook his head.
“Acceptable?” He asked through gritted teeth, and she nodded, opening her mouth to speak. He held up a hand imperiously.
“Now go make a coffee the way she likes it, and leave it under the warmer. She’ll forgive you after the first sip-- her mother always did.” Draco nodded, dazedly turning away.
If Granger hadn’t told them already, there would be no mistaking his identity after that. At this point, he felt like a zombie, barely holding his head above water. Once they knew, they knew, and that was that. At least this way,
“Bring this to your mother. See what she thinks.” Ron handed him the parchment, and Draco took it shakily.
“Yeah, that’s what he said too.” Harry’s eyes widened as her words sank into his bones. He knew Malfoy felt remorse, but still-- hearing it from the mouth of a Muggle, in Malfoy’s confidence-- the cognitive dissonance made his brain hurt.
It wasn’t until Saturday that he realized it had all been a ruse, laughing his way into Miriam’s kitchen listening to her cousin’s elaborate story.
a story,” Potter said, mirth sparkling in his own eyes, and Draco felt something he was very worried was not just grain alcohol.
“No!” Oh, what the Trio would say if they heard this. “No. Being truthful, if anyone was bullying, it was probably me. But it’s all over now. Water under the bridge.”
“Not his problem, is it?” She said shortly. Draco opened his mouth, but shut it again quickly, and they passed the several hours till sunrise in companionable but tense silence.
“We reformed Azkaban because that isn’t fair, Malfoy. You shouldn’t have to hide out here, without-- I mean, you’re one of the Sacred Twenty--”
,he’s on his day off. He doesn’t need to know you’re here unless I decide to tell him, and papa won’t blow it, because he just thinks you’re a hungry, harmless, village idiot. Just tell me if you’re here to spy on our progress or to ruin his life.”
“I believe your scrotty little friend here has something to tell you. Doesn’t he?” She shot Potter another menacing look, and Draco laughed at the sheer absurdity.
“Oi! Draco! Unbelievable. You haven’t heard a word, have you.” Draco shook an unapologetic head. She worried her lip.
“Full disclosure, mate, your mother’s a big part of it.” He sat a little straighter, and Draco rose up to meet him. “She’s the perfect fundraiser, well-liked, respected. People we both know should be behind bars will follow her as a way to regain status they thought would never come. Others will follow because of the cause-- and others because we all know your mother throws a damn good party.” They both grinned. “Even when I hated you, I still crossed off the days before the Samhain Ball.”
“Bollocks,” Miriam said, but it was without heat as she nodded goodbye to Potter and headed back in.
“I… It;s gonna be all right. Fuck, it is, yeah? But honestly, you don’t get to say anything about Liam anymore. You have to--”
Draco was nothing if not a dutiful friend, and he and his triple shot were waiting for her on the bench, staring pensively at the expanse of grass.
“Did I ask for your opinion? Is it your name above the shop? No. Go away and come back tomorrow if you’ve decided to be competent.” Mr. Iida continues shaping loaves without a second glance, and Draco knew he had lost.
“Absolutely. Take care, Draco,” he said with infuriating kindness. Draco thought idly about slamming the roof down on his head. He waited until the ash settled in the fireplace before opening his mouth. He closed it again, not sure of what to say suddenly, and tea appeared on the side table. His mother sighed.
“Would you change it?” Miriam’s voice was strong and steady at his side, as it always was, and he was startled into looking straight into Miriam’s eyes. “If you could go back in time. Would you do it again?”
She plunked squarely on the bench, breathing heavily as she took a guzzle of the now-lukewarm drink.
“I know what it is to regret, Draco. To hate yourself enough that death sounds better than another day you know you don’t deserve.” Weasley wiped his eyes.
“Would you believe me if I said the same to you?” he asked her, and the peal of laughter she let out lifted his spirits all the way home.
“Yes to all of it Miriam. I spent six months awaiting my own trial in that prison, and I would honestly kill myself before I set foot in it again.” Draco shuddered, straightening his back.
It wasn’t that he didn’t trust Malfoy, really, it wasn’t. Bygones were very well gone, and so were the days of assuming nefarious deeds were occurring right under his nose. Malfoy was living his life as it should be-- quiet, simple, and not in Harry’s way.
Fuck. When had life become so complicated? He’d left his old life behind to live peacefully, without all the baggage that upset him. All he’d been this entire week was upset.
“All right cheers, see you in two days, this way then,” Miriam said briskly, cutting in not a moment to soon and practically dragging that earnest monstrosity out of the room. All the air went with her, and he collapsed onto the table.
Looking only slightly mollified, Miriam nodded, and they both went back to their work, allowing the day to pass in companionable silence.
“I won’t, mate. Please. I didn’t come here to argue with you. Miriam let me have it for what I said last night, and she wasn’t wrong. There’s no way to go forward if we don’t leave the past behind us,” Potter said, and his voice was so earnest and hopeful Draco was dangerously close to believing it.
I have already failed her, and she will never trust me that deeply again.” Weasley looked right into Draco’s face, green eyes glistening.
“If something… if you were… you would tell me, yeah? If you were in trouble? Or if there… I saw how you were yesterday, and I’ll call the whole thing off...you know, if… oh, bollocks!” She swore under her breath, and he felt a rush of affection.
“Could this be about the…” she whipped her head to look at Draco, and Narcissa’s eyes were a fraction too wide behind her. He looked at his mother, who nodded.
“I do hope everything is going smoothly with this big order, Draco.” The man looked at him calmly. “There is--”
“The fit brown one or the fit ginger?” she asked, and the absurdity of those two being described as such broke his restraint, and a laugh escaped.
“Yes, you did.” Weasley said evenly, and this time Draco did throw up, racing to the bin at the end of the alley. He allowed a passing fantasy that when he turned around, Weasley would be gone-- but when he finally finished retching up his morning coffee, the gangly redhead was still there, unmoving. Draco walked shakily back, pulling out his handkerchief to wipe his face.
“Erm, yes, sorry, probably does. You seem fine by our scan, with no lasting damage internally or externally. Are you sore? Where were you hit? Was there ground impact?” he asked, and she shook her head.
“Don’t think this is over, Mallory,” she said, shoulders squared as she carried out serving platters, kicking the doors open with a bang.
“Pass the cornmeal, Miriam,” he said grimly, and she cocked her head tentatively, face red from fading anger as she handed him the box. He flicked some at her face to her delighted surprise.
“Yes. If. You. Don’t. Mind.” Draco said through his teeth, counting backwards wildly as he resisted the urge to strangle him. Weasley sighed, straightening up.
“Your days are numbered, pest,” He hissed threateningly, and Draco laughed his best tinkling, deadly, Narcissan laugh.
“You cannot fathom how long I have waited for something to do, my dragon. I waited until you were ready for the challenge too. And it will be a challenge, my love. I will not be able to do it alone.”
“Well done though Draco love, really. I’m proud of you, Mister ‘I can’t bake’. Maybe we can make this a seasonal.” She paused for a moment.
“Jean-Michel. I bummed the cigarette, he… asked after you, said I was on my way to meet you. Made some jokes. But someone-- in the market. He got so...still. At your name. I remember thinking, must be an ex or summa...I can’t see his face though, in my head. Even though I got a good look, I remember I did! I looked right at him but I can’t remember. I’m sorry!” She burst into tears, and Draco bounded up to his feet in alarm.
Draco knew in a second. Of course he knew. How could he not? He’d had them every year, wrapped in hopes and love and new challenges, fresh with magic, when everything was as simple and heartbreaking as it ever would be.
“Don’t move, Green Eyes,” she shot back behind him, and Harry lamented his strange circumstances and damnable curiosity until she came back, steam blooming from the paper cup.
He walked into the spring chill with a vague sense of unease. He’d never known what to do with himself besides working, and even more so now when everything in his life seemed utterly turned around. He had no real friends to call, besides Miriam--speaking of, he probably should call her to let her know there would be extra work.
” She wiped tears from her eyes, digging around in her apron pockets. She handed him a card and a bag.
“Don’t you fret, darling, I’ll have plenty,” Draco spat out, and Liam took her waist with a smug look and walked away. Miriam glanced back, mouthing her thanks.
“Er, the 30th. Of this month.” The way she winced told Draco she’d yet to tell her father. He’d lose his mind if he found out.
“It was meant, but also correct,” said Harry. “Your mother approached us more than a year ago with the idea. We thought it was brilliant, and Ron and Hermione’s research confirmed it. We knew we wouldn’t have time until Azkaban was finished, and she wouldn’t give us the go ahead until you said yes. She also wouldn’t tell us where to find you, so you can imagine our predicament.”
“Look, I know it sounds the same, but it couldn’t be more different. No murdering, no registries, no halfbreed blood traitor Muggleborn bullshit, yeah? We’re trying to cultivate what we already have, that’s all it is. Keep what we have and grow our own even more. Show the world that pureblood wizards and witches are more progressive than ever, and ready to earn our good names back. ” Weasley looked so earnest, Draco had a powerful urge to slap him. He calmed himself.
“He told me,” Draco said with some difficulty, “that he knew what it was to regret. To want to go back and change the future. But what if it’s impossible?”
“UPSET!!!” Her yelp shot three pigeons up into the air. She sat back down with a grumble. “Alright, fair enough, bloody birds, I’m upset.”She stared at him intensely.
“You’d drop dead before you even touched me, you feculent leech. And if I see even a single blemish, I swear on my father’s--”
“Miriam, what happened...when I was younger… more… oh, how do I even start--” How could he explain what he’d done? How could he convince her not to hate him when he hated himself so intensely. “Miriam, I don’t know if I can tell you. I did some awful things. Some really, really terrible things. People go to prison for life for what I did.” He took a deep breath.
“Don’t be ridiculous, you can always tell me.” His eyes narrowed. “How long though? Why didn’t you tell me before?"
“Finally had the guts to actually come in instead of stalking about out there, then, did you?” Her smile was just dangerous enough, and Harry blanched.
He’d fallen into this line of work completely by accident-- Miriam had been one of his first friends after his release, and the only one to stick. She was a shag gone upside down, when Draco didn’t know himself, stopping halfway because he was ‘somewhere else’ and making herself a cheese toastie Draco could still taste. She’d been his guide when it was all too new and too terrifying, armed with a fierce brightness Draco adored.
“You’re horrid. Besides,” he said morosely, “we both know the problem lies less with the blond part and more with the rest of it.”
“Oh excellent, I knew I could count on you!” She beamed at him, and he smiled, feeling a pang in his heart at her open face. Why he’d picked her up in the first place.
“Erm, well first he was the fit brown one. Fair’s fair. But then he made me angry, so I called him Draco’s scrotty little friend,” she said, a bit more cheer in her eyes as well. A snort came from a corner of the room, and silk rearranged itself primly.
“Just a bit tired, sorry. Renovations, you were saying?” Miriam eyed him with the look of the unconvinced. He managed a smile, hoping it didn’t look as grim as he felt. She turned her head back to the papers.
He debated going in, and was about to turn and walk away when the door opened again. In the doorway stood a gruff-looking man with angled black eyebrows, round cheeks belying the wrinkles framing quick, severe eyes.
“Miriam invited me, I swear. She cornered me after I stopped by the other day. I don’t mean to… I mean…”
It was clear that the Chosen One was only now realizing what a very stupid decision it had been to come here, and Draco found himself deflated.
He looked at the clock. Merlin. It was nearly midnight, and he’d have to be back in the wee hours to do the regular work of morning prep besides.
“Mrs-- er, Ms? Malfoy? Do you know? Draco, what?” He watched her struggle to find the words, and he realized he hadn’t at all, in the entire walk, planned what to say to her. He opened his mouth several times before shutting it again. His mother cleared her throat primly.
“Mouth. Shut.” She set her lip stubbornly, wiping at angry tears welling in her eyes in a desperate attempt to save the chocolate. Draco knew better than to argue, and the air was thick with emotion when Mr. Iida came into the kitchen. The old man raised a furry Vulcan eyebrow.
“She’s been really improving since she’s moved out on her own. So much easier to breathe when the house is clean. Don’t you agree?” Draco put as much icy death in his eyes as he could, and Liam’s smile grew feral.
“I thought I could escape, that it would keep you safe. It was selfish, and I’m sorry. If I had known, I-- please, believe me, I would have never…”
“Don’t.” Suddenly the thought of an apology from Potter made him want to vomit. “Really. I mean it. It’s fine, you have every right to be upset. That’s why I’m here, away from you and your friends and everything else, because you have the right to feel and think everything you do, and plenty worse besides. It’s better for everyone this way.”
“Fair is fair, I suppose. The difference is, mate, your dad decided to off anyone who disagreed with him.” Draco snorted, and Weasley gave an easy smile.
“The Ministry of Magic, War Crime Division, in accordance with Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, would like to make a formal proposition to the heir of the Malfoy estate to restore and re-open Malfoy Manor as a place for those orphaned by the Second Wizarding War to practice their arts and a home base during school breaks.”
“I’ll see you around, Potter. You sounded divine, Miriam, as always.” Draco gathered up his dignity like a shroud and glided out the door.
“Malfoy, it’s the perfect place. Massive grounds, totally secluded, with enough room to house the children and an extra wing besides. Excellent security, private floo network. A small muggle town close enough to allow muggle visitors to access the grounds. Believe me, Hermione has pored over every book, run every number and statistic you can think of, and some besides. There is nowhere better in Britain than the Manor.” Weasley’s face was solemn, and Draco felt nauseous.
It was going to waste, to tell the whole truth. He’d tried dating, in the beginning, but he couldn’t stomach the lying required. He may not be using his talents in public, but life was much harder without hangover potions and scouring charms. He’d tried one-offs too, and found them exceedingly dull. He’d thrown himself fully into his work, and even Miriams sly, ‘aw, love, this is my mate Sean, sorry I gotta dash but next rounds on me yeah?’ had failed to turn up any actual possibilities.
“S’nice and warm,” she mumbled, clearly getting drowsy, and Weasley jerked his head to the seat beside her. Draco slid in, holding her steady as the clear golden rings faded. She opened her eyes.
“They’ll be back in two days. And offered enough for the trouble to give you a very nice Halloween bonus besides.” She folded onto the stool, head falling onto floured muslin. A cloud billowed around her dark hair.
“Miriam!” he said throwing her a scathing look, and she just continued laughing, standing up with some difficulty.
“Look, I’m having a little party this weekend, just me and my band. Why don’t you come along and ask him yourself, eh? It’s my house, so he can’t throw you out.” She flapped her hand at the bag, and he opened it to reveal a mouthwatering palmier as big as his face. She grinned.
He let himself get lost in the easy companionship of the work for the rest of the day. As predicted, Mr. Iida was disgruntled at his daughter’s perky demeanor, but had elected to remain silent rather than thundering at her and letting her thunder back.
“Yes. Her injuries seemed congruent with Stunning, so I believe she’ll be alright. It will--” she stopped him with a finger. “It will, of course, still require a Healer in the interest of prudence, and I’ve already sent for one,” she sniffed. “Even if it is just Mr. Weasley.”
“Don’t, yeah? I know, I know what you’re about to say but-- he’s got clean, he’s made himself better-- who am I to deny him a chance? He did it for me, getting clean and sober and I can’t...I just can’t let it be for nothing.” Her voice cracked with emotion, but the accompanying conviction dropped a stone deep into Draco’s stomach. “What can I do? I love him,” she said, continuing before he could stop her. “I love him, and he’s a cunt, but-- we went through so much together. I can’t abandon him now, Draco, yeah? You understand. He needs me,” she said quietly, and he knew all hope was lost. His eyes stung as he blinked rapidly, dread settling deep in his bones.
After taking some distance to the game Ginny and Ron were playing, Harry and Draco could still hear Ginny’s playful banter and Ron’s occasional raging ringing in their ears, but their eyes were either scrutinising the pitch hawk-like or on each other as they tried to see any signs of the other one possibly having noticed the snitch.
“We probably should, Molly won’t appreciate if we’re late,” Harry said a bit grudgingly as he was feeling so pleasantly relaxed because of the light and happy atmosphere and the few beers he had had. “It was good to see you all.”
“We could try to be friends if it’s okay for you?” Harry asked. “I’d love to have you in my life somehow.”
“It might actually work still next year. But after that it’s only going to be new broomsticks, broomsticks, and broomsticks,” Molly said. “Draco, dear, you haven’t opened all of your presents yet,” she continued, pulling a soft, medium-sized present wrapped in red papers from under the Christmas tree.
“I just hate it when people call me by my last name," Draco began, making Harry startle, surprised. "I know Weasley didn’t do it on purpose as I’m rather sure Hermione has told him to use my first name or even ferret instead, but old habits die hard, I guess,” he continued in a sad voice. “I just don’t know what to do because every time someone calls me by my last name, I remember immediately how my parents made it clear they don’t have a son and that I’m as good as dead to them.”
The rest of the day passed surprisingly quickly. Draco hadn’t exaggerated when he had mentioned there was a lot of work to follow all the moves of a half-year-old who was more than eager to put practically everything he could reach into his mouth. As there were three adults present, it wasn’t such a big problem, but Harry couldn’t understand how Andromeda was able to look after Teddy on her own most of the time when she was supposed to cook, clean, and do all the other house duties as well.
“That sounds a bit exaggerated, I rather just walked in. Couldn’t miss the chance to take part in this small, sweet get-together,” Malfoy said and leaned suddenly towards Harry. “Or more precisely the chance to see the Chosen One,” he whispered in Harry’s ear, his hot breath tingling on Harry’s cheek. Harry’s breath hitched.
“Would be nice if you could refrain from making fun of my skills in français,” Ron said, pronouncing the last word overemphasizing it ridiculously as both Harry and Hermione barked a laugh.
“What is it with everybody trying to feed me all of a sudden?” Harry asked, both slightly annoyed and amused.
“Harry Potter! Dobby is very sorry! Dobby thought mister Harry Potter had already left, so Dobby came to fetch the basket,” Dobby squeaked, looking panicked.
“I don’t expect you to say anything, I just want you to listen to what I have to say,” Zabini said calmly. “I’m quite sure I’ve known about Draco’s proclivities before he even admitted them to himself. I’ve known him practically for my whole life, and he isn’t too hard to read if you know him well. And if I’ve gathered right, there has been something going on between the two of you this autumn?”
“I don’t condone violence, but I don’t believe Draco did it on purpose,” Blaise said. “Besides, I wasn’t talking about physical ways to hurt, anyway.”
“No,” Draco said, alarmed, as his eyes snapped at Andromeda. “Thank you, but no. I don’t know how I could pay you back and I’m already a burden to you.”
Harry just rolled his eyes. “If you really must know, I had detention,” Harry said coldly and started to stalk towards the Gryffindor Tower. He was feeling so tired that even Malfoy couldn’t rile him up this time. Only Malfoy didn’t seem to let him go that easily.
“You should talk to him. You don’t have to forgive him if you don’t want to but talking with him would probably help you to understand more what he was going through and why he ended up choosing his family,” Hermione explained. “The more you know about his thoughts and feelings from the time you were together, the easier it’ll be for you to let go of all the anger and bitterness you’re carrying now.”
“I – I wanted to…,” Harry said stammering, not really knowing what to say. He cursed himself. He should have planned better what to say and not just spontaneously follow his urge to see Malfoy.
“You’ve got no idea how much he has blamed himself for leaving you at the end of the sixth year. Now he thinks you pushed him away because you haven’t forgiven him,” Ginny explained.
“Don’t be stupid,” Draco spat. “Besides, how can you be judging me all the while you’ve been busying yourself with your little Defense club?”
“I think so. The battery should be at least half full when you buy it. Let me see,” Ginny said, taking now both of the mobile phones, their batteries and the SIM cards.
“Don’t be. I don’t want my past, my parents or what they did to me to be taboo topics,” Draco said sharply.
“Kidding, kidding!” Ron hastened to say. “Just let us know when you’ve got something serious going on with someone.”
Draco sighed and laid down next to Harry, head resting on Harry’s chest and hand petting Harry’s stomach. “Could we just not think about that today? I doubt anyone’s going to come to this side of the lake.”
“Yes,” Draco said, smiling faintly back at his mother even though he didn’t know if he was looking forward to going back to the Manor. Well, it would probably be better than the cell, at least.
“No, thank you, I’m already full,” Harry said, and the corners of Molly’s mouth turned slightly down. But Harry really couldn’t eat a single forkful more, not even to make Molly happy, and not even though the food was truly delicious. It was just that the sandwiches Kreacher had made for breakfast had turned out to be a bit more filling than what Harry’s breakfast usually was. Especially because Kreacher had just happened to read how carb-rich the bread was and how important it was to maintain the nutrition balance in every meal, which is why Kreacher had decided to add some extra protein in Harry’s sandwiches.
For a moment Harry thought he had managed, but soon he could see the familiar blonde hair shining on his peripheral vision. Harry tried again, this time taking sharp turns one after another while flying at full speed. Once again he managed to elude Malfoy for a moment but somehow the brat succeeded to reach him easily after a while.
“Thanks, Gin,” Harry said, smiling faintly at her. Although he knew all the girls’ brains didn’t work exactly in the same way. And Ginny was definitely a special case anyway.
“Thank you,” Draco said softly, turning around and leaving Harry who was now strangely overwhelmed by feeling both anxious and like he wanted nothing more than call Draco back and pull him into his arms.
“Blaise wanted to see Harry once more before the holidays, so we thought we could just hang out outside for a bit,” Ginny said, eyes glinting mischievously, and Harry didn’t know whether or not to look forward to what Ginny and Blaise had in mind.
“I can’t make you that promise,” Draco said in a weak voice. “I’ve still got days when I feel like I’m all wrong and I’ve done the worst decision in my life. You know that.”
Harry started drawing circles on Malfoy’s cheek with his fingers, and Malfoy leaned immediately into Harry’s touch, closing his eyes. Harry moved his hand to Malfoy’s forehead, trying to smooth the Slytherin’s worry wrinkles with his fingers. Then he lowered his hand to cup Malfoy’s other cheek and rubbed the frostbitten and red skin as he saw the other boy relaxing and starting to smile slightly. Finally, Harry put his fingers under Malfoy’s chin, tilted it up a fraction and leaned slowly against Malfoy.
“Don’t,” Harry blurted out without thinking. “I mean, it looks nice on you. You know, as it’s, er, slightly longer and wavier and as you let it hang freely,” he tried to explain, blushing horribly, and feeling like he was just digging his own grave. “Um, nice like objectively speaking,” he added, muttering.
“Of course not. He doesn’t want anything to do with me anymore, that’s why he didn’t come to the trial,” Draco said. “I just… I think I may not be able to follow up your and father’s example, not after everything that has happened.”
“Quiet! How dare you even address me? I never raised my son to be a poof. You disgust me. You dishonour the whole family,” Lucius hissed, eyes flaming. “I don’t even know if I’ll ever be able to call you my son again.”
As they arrived at their usual spot, the moon had risen up the horizon and made now the whole world shimmer in an eerie light. The lake had a flat and extremely thin ice cover on it, and it reflected the view so strictly in detail it reminded Harry of a painting that was hanging upside down.
“I don’t know what to say to make it better. I wish I could take back what I said earlier today. And, well, during all the previous years, too,” Draco said, looking pained and honest at the same time. “I don’t even know where your boundaries are. Thought honestly I wasn’t doing anything that wasn’t okay. Not until you took this up.”
Draco's father and his friends had always ranted about Potter's pure evilness because he had killed their ever so loved Dark Lord. Therefore, Potter must be such a threat and danger, especially to the purebloods. Even as a child Draco had wondered, how the Dark Lord could have been so almighty if he managed to get himself killed by a baby, not to mention a Half-blood baby. And how a child in his age could be evil. As far as he had known, children couldn't be evil. How could they, they couldn't do magic, they couldn't defend themselves and they were just so small, weak and innocent. Once Draco had expressed his thoughts to his father and, to put it mildly, his father hadn't been very pleased. After that Lucius Malfoy had made it extremely clear to Draco to never question his opinions again.
“Maybe we should knock again,” Ginny muttered and knocked on the door, much louder than Harry had done.
Malfoy looked like he was about to freak out. His eyes widened and he looked around, alarmed. Apart from Malfoy, Harry and Zabini, there was only one small group of third-year Hufflepuffs hanging around, deep in their own conversation.
“I know! I just wanted you to know that you’re soon making it quite clear your feelings for Draco are not purely antagonistic.”
It felt fantastic and so, so liberating. Harry had always known Malfoy was an excellent flyer, but they had only ever flown together playing Quidditch on the opposite sides. This time there was no pressure or other students watching, so they were rather cheering each other to try their best. Even the usual rivalry between them had started feeling more like playful teasing from both sides.
Harry looked Draco in the eye and put his hand over Draco’s. “Yes. This is just… not at all as I imagined this to go.”
"Would you look at that, Potter doesn't even have to try to dance. He can't obviously get himself even to the dancefloor before messing up with the steps. Seems like you don't have to hex him after all,” Pansy laughed sardonically, turning her eyes to Draco. "Hey, what's gotten into you?" Pansy asked, gripping Draco's shoulder and shaking it.
His breathing comes out in harsh pants, and his eyes are watering from the smoke from nearby fires—the only light source available.
Perhaps he and Harry won’t last the rest of their lives, he’s prepared for that… But he can’t be the side-piece, and he cannot handle being cheated on. He thinks it might kill him the next time.
"He's been working a lot," Hermione says, wringing her hands and unable to look Draco in the eyes. "We'll call him when… when the time comes."
Draco laughs. He almost wishes that were the case. He actually just don’t want to face the potential shit storm that may come his way in the form of scathing or mocking letters from Potter once he finally sends his own off.
He's got permission from the parents, no matter how weird and archaic that feels (and wasn’t that just about one of the most uncomfortable conversations he's ever had with Narcissa and
“Well,” Draco says and holds his chin as he thinks. “If my understanding is correct, You-Know-Who is obsessed with Hogwarts, right?”
, exactly, but you don’t know the context! Ginny’s like my sister, Draco. Yes, we used to date, but that was
He curls over on his side just as the tears finally break free from behind his closed eyelids, sliding down the side of his face, over the bridge of his nose, down into the pillow his head rests on. He wants to fall back asleep immediately, completely fade away, and only wake again when the people he loves are back with him.
A soft knock on the door startles Draco out of his downwards spiralling thoughts. He stares at the door, waiting and saying nothing. Trying to keep his strained breathing so low whoever is on the other side of the door might even think he’s not even inside.
He hasn't had those thoughts in nearly two years now. He hasn't been on constant alert, expecting an attack at any second for nearly a whole year—comfortable and secure with Harry at his side.
your head at, darling?” Pansy’s voice sounds distinctly annoyed now. “Really, one would think you’re still entirely wrapped up in work. We’re on
When he looks up, it’s to find horrified students holding the Daily Prophet in their hands. Some of them are crying.
When he curls up in his armchair, or on the sofa, or in the grass, or in the bed, the small furry creature curls up with him. He wonders what it is, he wonders why it follows him...
He wishes he’d been wrong. That the truth really had been innocent and he’d just misunderstood that first conversation. He’d wanted to talk to Potter about it, sort it out. But then Potter had cancelled without telling him what it was about and Draco had overheard that second conversation too…
“What does it say Neville?” Ginny’s voice sounds excited, but it’s hard to tell among the screaming and raised voices in the Great Hall.
Finally he closes his eyes, drawing a deep breath. It takes him far longer to fall asleep these days, and he sleeps much lighter than ever before.
The strangers who may be his friends come to the Manor less and less. Weeks pass before he realises that they have stopped coming by entirely. It seems they weren't his friends after all.
His parents cry sometimes. At least, he thinks they do. He cannot be sure, it's so hard to hear or see anything.
Besides, he's been terrible to Hermione and it's not like he's apologised for it. It's stupid of Harry to even consider trying to make friends with Malfoy just because he can't stop thinking about maybe kissing or touching him.
Draco doesn't expect remorse from his attacker anyway, doesn't expect him to have a change of heart and turn himself in. People like that see the reality they want to see… so if the papers report in ten years that Harry is happy, then Draco's attacker will likely just think "I knew it!", regardless of how long it took.
At first it seems as empty as the hallways, but as he looks around, Harry catches the sight of another human being.
Mother and Father of course thought the idea of connecting Draco’s apartment and the Villa through a specific international floo connection was a
Well, that's not perhaps entirely accurate or fair. But this is the second time the Ministry entirely fails to ensure that it does not fall to corruption or to the hands of the “dark lord” that is trying to enslave the wizarding population of Britain.
He wonders what will happen to all of these people he loves once he’s gone. He sees their grief already, and hopelessness and naked fear in their eyes whenever they look at him.
She sniffles loudly and rubs at her eyes. The words set everyone else off, too, and soon, Draco is surrounded by crying loved ones. He hates it. He wants them to be
Draco feels like he should know that, considering his relationship with Harry… But Harry honestly doesn’t talk about her much. He talks far more about Weasley and Granger, and then the rest of the Weasleys as a monolith.
Harry’s heartbeat is loud in his ears as his heart pounds in his chest. His lungs burn as he pants for air. His legs are screaming in protests as he continues to push them to their limit, forcing himself to run ever faster.
His parents talk, the funny little creatures with the big eyes and the long ears talk, the strangers talk, the strangers who might be his friends talk.
But really, either Draco’s Other died, or they went through that ritual, found out who he is, and decided that it was worth a Core Severing to break any connection between them.
It doesn't really sound like Potter, like the person Draco used to know... But then he probably never knew him very well after all. He just thought he did, before things ended.
It's almost the best case scenario. the only thing that would have been better would have been if no Herder had stayed behind.
Hana seems to be thinking something very similar, judging by the look on her face, but she still throws a towel over her shoulder and motions for Adriana to take over the bar, and then she heads off into the kitchen.
Draco sits up—well, Pansy and Harry help him sit up—just in time for a stressed looking Ron to sweep in the room with a healer and everyone else on his heels.
Every single failure and moment of disappointment was absolutely worth it for this: an overjoyed Draco in his arms, clutching on for dear life, and expressing his want to marry Harry over and over again.
Both Father and Hermione look genuinely confused, however, so whatever their contribution, it must have been unknowing.
Sometimes his friends—are they his friends?—come by. Something in the way they act makes him think that they are... but perhaps they are strangers. They try to talk to him, try to rouse him...
Draco is alone, in more ways than one. He doesn't see his friends, he doesn't really talk to his parents, and he certainly doesn't have a partner. It's not because anyone—well, except for Potter—has forsaken him, or doesn't want to see him. It's not like his parents have disowned him or anything gauche like that. No, he's well aware that they keep putting more money into his vault to ensure that he can pay his rent and survive without struggling.
The little furry creature turns its head to look at him and lets out a noise, as if answering him. It does that every time, as if it’s responding to his call. As if it's confirming that he's right, Cassiopeia
As they step outside, Ron catches sight of Malfoy's posse of Slytherins standing in a group and seemingly arguing. He doesn't see Malfoy's blond head among them though.
Draco is still asleep, face relaxed and lips slightly parted. He's very quiet, calm, in sleep, in a way that he never is when they're awake. Awake Draco is full of manic energy and is actually kind of hard to keep up with a lot of the time. Especially when he gets going on a tangent. Not that Harry minds, really; sometimes it’s actually very nice to listen to Draco when he gets going. A lot of the time even.
His father and Hermione, though they’ve never so much as spent an hour alone together before, throw themselves into research of what kind of potion could have caused such a terrible disease and any possible antidotes. Hermione even goes so far as to contact Headmistress McGonagall to get access to the Hogwarts library to compare and contrast with Malfoy Manor’s possibly even older collection.
“I do.” Draco laughs. “I absolutely would like being spoiled rotten… But perhaps we can try and keep surprises on a more… short time-frame and make sure that they don’t get leaked out of context?”
He's almost overwhelmed by the horde of people who swarm into the room, but he takes his parents fussing and crying with ease, even as Pansy calls him an asshole for ruining her makeup. As if it's
“Just come back safe,” Draco whispers, voice so low that Harry almost doesn't hear it. “Both of you. Please, just come back safe.”
The effect is, unfortunately, ruined by how croaky his voice is. He supposes he shouldn't be surprised, he doesn't talk much these days. But it's still rather unfortunate.
don’t get into too much trouble. It’s been a real damn hassle keeping anyone from finding out and I sort of hate you all even more for it. I like to
He wonders if things would change if Harry were to come back. Would that old spark of life return to Draco? Would he be able to stop preparing for the worst? Would he finally have something to write about again?
Harry nods his head slowly. Going to Malfoy Manor is probably a bad idea, but at this point... what else can they do?
Potter’s face splits into a huge grin, and it seems as if he only barely restrains himself from leaping at Draco.
He clutches his wand even tighter and focuses on keeping his breathing even, focuses on not allowing himself to hyperventilate.
Zabini laughs. "Oh unclench, Weasley! I happen to know that Draco has a small mole on the top of his left buttock and that's not because I've gone
he’ll try to make an escape, a run for it. If he gets out, leaves the hospital, he won’t be their responsibility anymore and their oaths won’t force them to care for someone they cannot possibly think even deserves to live when so many others died.
Draco feels very thin as Harry holds him, but the arms that wrap themselves around Harry's neck seem strong at least.
As soon as everything is out in the open, it's going to be far less comfortable, far less easy. After all, his parents will no doubt demand family dinners—and by Circe, that sounds like a nightmare of awkwardness waiting to happen. There's also the possibility that Harry's family will too, and that, quite honestly, sounds even worse.
He stops right at the side of the bed, looking down at the entirely naked Malfoy, suddenly acutely aware that he's fully dressed himself.
That would get them killed almost instantly or force them to retreat, which would lose them this chance.
. Oh Circe and Morgana, Draco doesn’t even want to consider how that conversation must have gone down. Oh dear, oh no.
He falls asleep then, still choking back tears and trying to drown his angry thoughts. Amidst all of it, there is at least one single glimmer of hope: he didn’t get his friends killed. He was stopped before anything truly bad could happen.
Draco keeps his silence and waits. Sometimes it takes Harry a while to gather his words, and Draco would like this over with as quickly as possible. Usually he'd be needling Harry about it, but not now.
Draco looks at Harry, Ron, and Hermione, and sees the grim determination on their faces. They've fought the Ministry and its corruption before, they’ve worked hard to try and ensure that a properly working Ministry took its place after the war—lest the mistakes of the past be repeated. It must be hard for them to see that there’s still corruption afoot.
All those letters, all those demands, all those apologies... Never sent. Never meant to be sent. It would simply be too much for Draco to send them at all. He cannot bend himself that far. He cannot make himself so vulnerable.
"I suppose I must let you leave then..." Draco murmurs and strokes Harry's cheek gently. It is so hard to end the evenings they have together.
“If you three had known how to break into the Ministry without getting caught, we wouldn't have had to spend all that time hanging out in tents in that bloody awful forest.” Draco gives Harry a smug look.
He stares at the letters uncomprehending. He has no idea what that means. He assumes that Jean is Hermione, since he knows that her full name is Hermione Jean Granger. It would be a simple way for her to use a code but not risk someone else having found Harry's coin he supposes. But what does the rest of it mean?
have lived to see it if not for the effort of his friends and family. Draco is going to make the absolute most of his life from now on. He nearly lost his life, nearly died before his twenty-third birthday. But now… Now, he’s been given back the time that was almost stolen from him, so he’s not about to waste it.
“Well, congratulations,” Draco mutters bitterly, “I forgot to change my Floo settings when I moved.”
He hadn't waited a single second once he'd understood what Adriana was saying, instead heading directly towards... oh goodness, the God of the Sun.
“Harry…” There’s a smirk on Draco’s lips, and he draws circles with his finger against Harry’s left pectoral. “Did you adopt a kneazle?”
Draco doesn’t want to listen to his attempts of explaining all of this. There cannot possibly be an innocent explanation.
Perhaps he shouldn’t be joking about his own death like this, when it’s only just been prevented… But somehow he feels like if
The door swings open for him, revealing a concerned looking Pansy who’s now wearing a summer-dress. She and Blaise likely don’t want to be mostly-naked for this conversation either.
“Darling...” Mother’s voice is soft as she speaks, and Draco only barely suppressed the flinch. He can tell that she wants him to do it, to take this leap of faith.
Harry frowns. "Well, I still like girls too, but… I don't really think of Ginny that way anyway?" He scratches his head.
There is something extremely unsettling about the way the herders look and move. Harry wonders if it's a spell that causes that weird way their robes move around them when they walk.
Draco looks pensive, idly drawing a small pattern on the table with his index finger. "I... suppose you are right. There
The sound of her mother's voice startles Adriana out of her stupor, and she continues her way into the kitchen, cheeks flushing with embarrassment.
Filch doesn’t mess with anyone from the Inquisitorial Squad, and the other teachers have no ability to do anything to him either. As long as he’s not caught with any persona non grata in a way that can be reported to Umbridge, he’s safe.
how powerful they are, which is also why all the gods also have Spoken Names. Names that can invoke them, but hold no power in and of themselves."
Draco’s heart is hammering in his chest. He just wants his parents to be okay. He just wants them to be
"Fath.... Father..." He chokes, and his father's face is suddenly pressed into his hair. Draco can feel the tears. "Mothh... Mother..." His tongue is loosening, no longer feels as thick and useless in his mouth.
, so clearly she's not someone worth listening to right now. She has no idea what is wrong with her, but clearly something is. Why else would she act so weird about this stranger?
Draco lets out a loud inappropriate snort of laughter at that. Only Harry would think facing down Draco’s parents and telling them about their relationship is worse than facing Voldemort himself.
In the corner of his eyes, the places where everything is so foggy, he can see movement. He thinks his parents are moving, but he doesn't move his gaze from the small furry creature.
Trapped and weak in a hospital bed, surrounded by nothing but white walls and none of those he loves.
“You won't ever be able to match our place in Harry's heart. You'll only ever be second-best, not as good as us. You’re not his real friend, you're just a stand-in while we are gone. The second we deign to come back, he's going to throw you away like yesterday's trash.”
why Harry's thinking about this. He's never managed to save the world without losing people he loves before. Why would this time be different?
He’d thought he’d gotten better about that whole “spoiled” thing, but it seems his entitlement still runs so strong he was blind to the fact that Potter deceived him. And here he is, heartbroken and embarrassed.
It’s been a long road here—saying that Harry and Draco didn’t start out on the best of terms would be an understatement—but Harry knows it’s been worth it. Every fight, every tear, every apology, until they finally settled into themselves and their relationship; until finally the force of their love and passion seemed to have finally smoothed out the rough edges of their shared past.
"Cassiopeia," he says, the word falling easier from his lips now than it did before. Somehow... Somehow having said it once, saying it again is easy. He no longer chokes on his tongue as he tries to say it.
Father lets out a small anguished groan; it’s barely audible, but it still sends a shiver down Draco’s spine. He doesn’t like to see his father, either of his parents, so distraught.
Besides, what's the use of magic if he can't use it to just stay in bed all day? He's not hungry so he doesn't exactly need to go cook. And he hasn't had the strength or energy to clean for months at this point.
It’s a nice fantasy to have, Draco thinks, though he knows that his father likely considers saving his life far more important than saving his reputation. Which, considering how important the Malfoy reputation has always been to Father, is very gratifying, and Draco feels a sort of calming warmth in his chest, despite it all.
been doing these past months, but he’s not going to admit that. Not even if Potter put him under the Cruciatus Curse would he admit that!
He wants to tell Draco to hurry it up, they need to get out of here. They need to hide before anyone comes back. But he can't. Of course he can't.
Of course, a restaurant—like his first attempt—isn’t the most private of places, but he’d planned to do it quietly without drawing any attention to them. That… that would have been good enough, he thought. But the restaurant failed (though they did get a kneazle out of it) as did his attempt at the picnic (though in that case it was more that Draco nearly
“You are so bloody lucky Kreacher went running to my mother to tell her all about how he tricked you, rather than to my very-much-insane aunt.” Malfoy’s face twists into a deeper sneer. “If you go to the Ministry, you’ll play right into You-Know-Who’s hands.”
Adriana has long since memorised the Spoken Names of all the gods, for it would not do to be greeted by one of them and have nothing to call them besides their title. She wonders if she'll ever meet Harry, the God of the Sun, during his travels to find Draco, the God of the Stars, but she can only hope for it.
Draco isn't depressed. That's not what is happening here. But he does know that his parents are worried, that his friends probably think he's being weird and embarrassing. Maybe they're worrying too.
Strangers come and go, even as he slowly moves through the rooms. Some of them ignore him, too focused on what they are doing—he does not know what it is—but some of them try to talk to him. They make him sit down in the lounge, they talk and talk and talk... They brandish their wands, and he feels their magic wash over his skin like razors.
was the one to teach him Occlumency in the first place. Did Bellatrix deliberately teach him something incorrectly to cause him harm?
“But we're lucky that we at least have Hogwarts, considering that the NMO managed to lock down all of St. Mungo's and kidnap most of the healers.” Harry can't really describe how relieved he is that on just that day, Draco had gone home early and thus escaped capture.
Harry kind of wishes they could stay here forever. That they would never have to leave this room, safe and warm. He wishes that the war was already over and that they didn't have to keep hunting for Voldemort horcruxes—that there was no more risk of any one of them being injured or dying as they're doing their best to try and stop a madman from essentially trying to take over the world.
He knows that... that names can be important. The thought spins in his head as he wanders the Manor, as he eats his meals. He knows he... he had a name once. His parents have names. The funny creatures with the big eyes and the long ears must have names. The strangers he once thought might have been his friends must have names too... The strangers with the razor sharp magic must have names...
Potter looks sad, and who gave him the right? How dare he come in here and turn everything upside down again? Why is he showing up now? It's been months since he broke up with Draco, so why is he coming here and worrying now? It's not like they’ve seen each other or talked at all. Or even sent letters.
"Potter," he sneers as he moves past Harry without looking back. Instead he moves to the large bed and...
The God Wisher believed the loss of his lover would destroy the God of the Sun, for he believed love to be a weakness. He did not understand it. But the God of the Sun learned love at his mother's knee, for she was the
warded to the skies and back, so anyone who’s not me, Mother, or Father—or coming in with us—is going to be able to get in there. And since Mother and Father decided that
He backs up against the wall, moving slowly and carefully even though he's behind an invisibility cloak, keeping his eyes on the Herder the entire time.
It’s too much to think about, and Draco just lets his tears flow freely, lets his breathing hitch with sobs even as the prolonged crying bout is causing a blinding headache to start building in his skull.
And then, one day almost a year after the day Draco arrived, a stranger enters the village boundaries.
has more pride than allow themselves to be hidden away while someone plays happy family with someone else out in the open.
enthused by the idea than Draco’s, so it made perfect sense to him that they should try it out in secret.
“It’s Friday evening, Pansy. I’m sure the Leaky will be more than a little bit busy. Couldn’t we spare ourselves the trouble and take a glass of wine at either of our apartments?”
He swallows the urge and as soon as Potter and Ginny Weasley round a corner at the back of the shop, he closes the newspaper and staggers to his feet.
Hanging from Draco's raised fist, gleaming in the light of magical candles, hangs a golden pendant with a poisonously green stone in the middle of it.
“Oh please!” Draco feels genuinely affronted for his father’s sake, and resolutely ignores the loud guffaws he hears at Black’s little name-calling. “If we’d wanted to get ahead with
The strangers he once thought may be his friends return. They hold his hands, they speak at him, they cry. He still doesn't understand them, he doesn't know why they have returned now.
—doesn’t even have any proper and realistic plans to make his goals happen. Draco’s quite certain he’s entirely mad—and quite angry with his father for ever thinking that following him was a good idea. Shared ideology is not enough!
He closes his eyes and just waits for it to be over. For whoever is on the other side of the Floo to just give up. He doesn't have the energy to even bother with getting up and telling them to sod off and leave him alone.
The only time Harry really even feels okay anymore, is in these quiet moments in the middle of the night holding Draco's body close to his.
Harry knows he can get this whole thing together, knows he can make Draco the happiest man alive—Harry will even agree to some of the more outlandish wedding ideas Draco will no doubt come up with just to make him happy—he just needs to manage to finally propose.
He loses himself in the memory of being pressed against Potter’s back, screaming himself hoarse in fear and rage. Vince…
Lucius suppresses a shudder. "Of course, my Lord. I came as quickly as I could." He bows as he speaks, even as he feels cold sweat break out at the back of his neck. A private audience with the Dark Lord is never a good sign. At least he's not likely to meet an untimely death; the Dark Lord far prefers to do his
Draco feels the bed dip, and he wonders if Potter sat down on his bed. It seems like it, and that would be just like him, just taking up space wherever he wants. The covers are suddenly pulled back and Draco squints up at Potter's frowning face above him.
"How... how can you find hope in such a story?" he asked after she finished. "The God of the Sun lost his beloved, and the God of the Stars lost
Shaking his head in resignation, Draco allows himself to be pulled along into the Leaky Cauldron. It’s… far less crowded that Draco expected it to be, and there aren’t nearly as much noise as he’d feared. In fact, it seems rather… pleasant, almost. Well, as pleasant as the Leaky Cauldron ever gets, that is.
Harry turns his attention away from his thoughts and back to his lover's face. He stares at Draco as if he could burn the image into his retinas, to have it be the only thing he ever sees.
His parents pull him in close, he hears their words wash over him, his name repeated over and over among so many noises and words he doesn't understand. He wants to understand it, suddenly. He wants something else than this, something other than this bleak and blurry grey existence.
be pleased that he's being taken into the Dark Lord's confidence, a sign of his return to high status among his followers... But Lucius's instincts are screaming at him that something about this is wrong.
It's a hope, a wish, a possibly fruitless dream... But it's one of the only things that keeps Harry going. There's nothing else to really live for right now except the hope of a better future, the hope of
Smiling and humming to himself, Draco takes his empty cup over to the sink. It’s time to get ready for bed. Draco’s job as an independent potions master and researcher may allow him to set his own hours, but he enjoys having a routine so he’s up at a decent time every day anyway.
The wireless drama episode ends, and as the outro music plays, Draco feels a soft kiss pressed against his temple.
Harry takes a bite of his own pastry, just to psych himself up, and closes his eyes to properly enjoy the tastes that explode across his tongue. He thinks he tastes the tangy flavour of grapefruit,  contrasting nicely with the sweetness of the meringue and whipped cream.
The terror of this weapon caused some gods to bend before the God Wisher's will, unwilling to lose their lives to his mad rampage across the heavens.
Harry shakes his head. “You didn’t see your father’s face when I told them. I’m quite certain he was contemplating strangling me with his bare hands, not even using magic for it.” He tilts his head to the side and looks pensive. “Though I think the look your mother gave me might have been worse, like she could stare into my soul and found me lacking. It took me a few days to convince them to at least let me
He’s seen Draco eye those lovely looking pastries with whipped cream on top, and the idea of proposing to Draco when he’s got whipped cream on his nose makes something warm spread through Harry’s entire chest.
it will be as much as who it actually is. Only charlatans deal with them, preying on the desperate and lonely.
“What a convenient explanation, Malfoy. How do you even know about it? No way would an owl make it all the way here from Wiltshire in the time it’s been since Harry spoke to Kreacher. And we just used the only Floo available in the whole damn castle.”
It may be undignified of him to run away and hide, but at least it's not as undignified as bursting into tears in the middle of a public space in front of his maybe-boyfriend-maybe-cheating-asshole.
A short flicker of worry, of anguish, lances through him. What if... What if he never remembers? What if he never remembers what his parents' names are?
As the days pass with good food, lovely trips to the sea as well as places to shop, Draco slowly starts to feel better. He hasn’t even cried every night! Last night he just…
Everything around him is hazy, as if the world is perpetually covered in mist. Most of the world seems hidden from him now, he can no longer see far ahead. Instead he stumbles around, as if in a daze. He falls over, again and again, as he misjudges a step, or misses something that's in his path.
“I found out I was the side-piece, that he has someone else who he's moving in with, and I cut my losses and came here to get away from it.”
Ron turns on his heel, running back the way they came, his face feeling hot enough to fry an egg on. He hears the door close behind him, and then Zabini lets out a loud laugh.
There is no innocent explanation… Ginny Weasley loves Harry Potter, and he’s been two-timing her for
A flash of shame washes over Draco as he realises that Harry is in his apartment, looking at the mess that has built up over the months Draco hasn't bothered to clean.
He swiftly engraves the message—including his codename—asking to be given entrance. There is the emergency entrance, of course, which he would have been able to Apparate to. But that one is also heavily guarded and not some place to abuse for a swifter return to base. They only use that if they're critically injured, and will likely not make it otherwise. Like Allison… Merlin, Harry hopes she’s okay.
Neville actually laughs. “Yeah. His statement literally calls them out for printing Ministry sponsored propaganda against Harry, who he reminds everyone
"Potter's gone too?!" Oops, seems like Parkinson overheard them. She must have ears like a bloody bat. "Blaise, we have to find Draco now! Who knows what Potter might be doing to him!"
“Well… It mentions that the Death Eaters attacked the Department of Mysteries late last night, and that the Ministry was forewarned by Professor Dumbledore.” Neville scans the text. “There was an altercation, and some injuries, but luckily no one on our side died or was gravely injured. Most of the escaped convicts and several
It feels weird to think so little of his own life, but he doesn't know what else he can do. He doesn't want to tell Draco that he thinks they should do it, but at the same time he knows he can't not say it. He doesn't think Draco would really forgive him if he decides that they shouldn't try to save people. He knows that Draco thinks the world of him, and Harry just wants everything to be over and everyone to be safe.
He stops in his tracks, and turns around instantly, letting Draco run into him, even as it tangles their arms together uncomfortably.
“What did you mean when you said we were ‘welcome’ before?” Granger’s face is turned down into a look of deep suspicion: squinted eyes and pursed mouth.
Harry doesn’t answer, however; he’s too busy staring at the absolute disaster that is his third failed proposal. The ring isn’t visible in the mess, at least—so Draco won’t see it and Harry will have another chance—but that's about where the good news ends.
“Pansy’s just peeved that it’s taking longer than she’d like for her to be able to plant her tush in a chair in the sun for some tanning.” Blaise smiles slyly. “Pay her no mind. As soon as she gets a drink in her hand she’ll be just dandy again.”
"The Gryffindor way, yes. Vengeance for breaking your trust, not stopping them from doing it in the first place. You
“You what?” His throat feels tight, and anger is starting to swell besides the hurt. What gives Potter the right to come here and do whatever he feels like? Draco promised to keep quiet, didn’t he?
Maybe he only knows the names because Mother and Father have said them so many times, so many times that he learned those words. Even among all the other words that are still lost to him, still no more than mere noise.
Harry is the one who uses the amulets imbued with a protean charm to send a message to everyone else, to let them know what they're about to attempt and also where they should try to go if they fail. Just in case.
He nods at the rest of them before he heaves himself out of his chair and makes his way out of the meeting room.
“You’re not, Draco.” Pansy’s small hand suddenly close around Draco’s wrist, just as Blaise’s large hand encircles his ankle. “It’s okay if you’re not… We just… We just want you to talk to us. You don’t have to hide anything from us. Regardless of what you think, we’re not going to judge you…”
Waking up the next morning, Harry feels the best he's felt in a long time. He still misses Ron and Hermione, of course he does, but he's finally had a good night sleep after… well after having a lot of fun with Draco in various positions. Not that either of them lasted very long, but they also were ready to go again quite quickly.
He has enjoyed watching Potter's dreams of fornicating with Lucius's son... and he wants Draco to whore himself out to get a hold of that prophecy.
Harry doesn't know what to think about the fact that somehow, some way, Andromeda Tonks is here. She just... came by. Or, well, not exactly. She found someone she knew was part of the rebellion, and convinced them that she needed to speak with their leaders.
“I love you too.” Harry presses his forehead gently against Draco’s. “Before I get them, I should warn you that your mother took our finished wedding album and all the plans and has started to make the necessary bookings and appointments. She started the moment the healer said that she and Ron had made it in time and that you
But in the end, there's nothing Harry can do except accept it and hope that at least Draco doesn't leave. At least Draco will stay by his side until the end of it all, no matter what that end will be.
rather than the other person. He supposes that it’s pretty typical of him to believe that just because he wants something, it makes sense for it to come true.
It is a fact of his world, something he cannot discount or lie about. He loves his parents, possibly more than anything else, and he wants to make them happy. He wonders if there’s any way he
Looking around, Adriana realises that the town is gathering. More and more of the people come, murmurs start up, and then even Old Tobias is there.
The third of them is the King of the Gods's best friend, the lover of the God of Logic and Knowledge. He is the
He feels shaky and tired, but everything seems so... So clear... As if a veil has lifted from his eyes, and he can see much better than he used to. But things... don't seem to look much different, despite it. Everything is still in shades of grey, everything is still fuzzy around the edges... It's just... less so, somehow.
Pregnant silence falls, and Draco can't help but wonder if everyone is staring at him. He wouldn't exactly be surprised per se, but he doesn't see why they would be. He hardly said anything
“You’re going to live,” Harry says, and suddenly there are tears streaming down his cheeks, and Draco feels himself pulled into his arms.
Draco watches as Nurse Malbrook takes a glass and pours something from a small vial into it, and then something else. Probably some water and healing draught, two birds with one stone.
It's Draco's turn to shiver as Harry's warm breath washes over his lips and the sensitive skin of his face.
"Harry…" He looks pensive and awkward when Harry turns to him. "I'm sorry for doubting you. I just…"
Still, he lives a life surrounded by House elves—however weird that still is to him—so he’s simply gotten used to the fact that there is someone else who wants to cook and will likely get upset if he does it himself. So, special occasions only it is.
“That guy,” said a voice from behind him. “Looks like an absolute twat. And next to you, that’s saying something.”
The timer felt almost deafening in the quiet shop. A harried look came over the young man at the prep counter, sighing as he wiped his hands on the apron.
“Just Liam, but we keep it pretty quiet, last night was the first time I’d been to his new place anyway, just a short…” the blood drains from her face.
“No!” Weasley’s hand shot out. “No, no, everything’s fine. Sorry, I’m a bit shit at this. Everyone is fine. I just-- look, mate, d’you have a few minutes? Mind spending it on a bit of a walk?”
The green ink glittered in a distinctly magical way-- Draco wondered if Miriam had been able to see it.
Harry was sure that between House Elves and Narcissa, Draco Malfoy had never done a single chore in his life-- and yet, here he was. The image was etched in his mind like a painting: pale face smudged even paler with flour, hands red with faded burns slashing the white lengths of his arms, already thin lips pulled even thinner. Grey eyes staring in that blankly cool way that had always made him seethe with rage.
“Let me show you the backroom entrance, yeah? There’s always something in the crate by the door.” Her voice was genial and placid, but her grip on his forearm was piercing as she dragged him out into the cold and through the back alley. She dropped his arm, and opened her mouth to speak before shutting it again abruptly. She sighed.
Draco felt his own blood pumping through his head as he plunked down on the plastic crates, speechless.
“Miriam, if the salt and moisture ruins that chocolate, the replacement is coming out of your own paycheque. Get lunch and temper it after you’ve come back with yourself under control.”
“She sounds wonderful, doesn’t she,” Liam said, gesturing towards the woman on stage, looking incandescent with a mic in her hand, as Miriam always did.
“So he helped you get out? Is that when we met?” she asked. He shook his head, wiping his face and grimacing.
Draco got ready for work with little joy-- Sundays were his least favorite anyway, and he had no desire to face either a post-shag Miriam or a terrifying Mr. Iida, no doubt also annoyed by his daughter.
“You do realize I’m being very magnanimous by not asking you questions about this whole bollocking business, yeah? Just so we’re clear.”
“My dragon, do you not think you are worthy of goodwill and sympathy?” She asked, eyes filled with emotion. He sputtered.
“We’re the last of our kind, you and I,” said Weasley. Draco stopped in his tracks, blood curdling. “Our people are dying out faster than they can be replaced.” Draco turned, incredulous, sure that the vengeful ghost of Bellatrix Lestrange had suddenly inhabited his second-to-least-favorite redhead.
“That is just lovely, isn’t it. Much better than I expected. The look's still shit though. No braiding allowed? Maybe a leaf? A touch of mirror glaze?”
“Cor, I wish Hermione was here, she’s so much more diplomatic about it. Just suppose I better crack at it and be done, yeah?”
“Draco! If I wanted to waste money I’d have flushed it down the toilet.  Hold the strawberry by the stem or go be useless somewhere else.”
“If I’m fit ginger, what’s he?” Weasley gestured to Harry, all but forgotten in the corner of the room. She gave another smirk.
Sure enough, he arrived to Miriam sparkling like fresh snow, eyes growing even brighter as she took in his appearance.
“Oh, just a story about his dear old--” Draco kicked him under the table. “Er-- dear old school days,” Potter finished lamely. Draco wondered how he’d ever vanquished anything.
Draco woke up the next morning wishing he’d drank enough to black out the night before, Potter’s words ash in his already chalky mouth. They’d run through his dreams, mocking him on the wings of blackened snitches.
His mother was on her feet in a flash, grabbing his arms firmly before he even realized the ground had tilted.
“You think you’re the only one? You and I both know what we’re actually not talking about, and it certainly isn’t my scrotty little fucking friend, as you so aptly put it.”
“They want over a thousand of every seasonal item, but in miniature, if you can bloody believe it, plus miniatures of the savory items from the end of summer, though heaven can only surmise where we’ll get cherries from in fucking April and not have them be absolute rubbish. Plus a cake shaped like some dead bonkers castle, though that’ll be me, obviously.”
“While I quite understand your desire to discuss at this time, my dear, I think it’s prudent to wait for any more meaningful discussions until after your Healer arrives, which should be any minute now. Before he arrives, I would like to alert the authorities. I have already heard Draco, but I would like to know if you noticed anything extraordinary? Or strange? Have you been followed by anyone? I know it’s quite hard to collect oneself in these situations, but the more you remember now the better action we can take. If you don’t mind, I’d like to hear what happened right before...” Narcissa said, and Miriam nodded.
Draco felt his face turn white. There was the uncomfortable sense of the other shoe dropping: it figures that with this reckoning of the rest of his life, that his most solid friendship would be imploding too. He sat quietly, trying to gather his thoughts, and she seemingly understood. They sat there in the quiet for a moment before he began speaking.
“I am dying. My daughter will not accept this. She is her mother’s child-- always has been. She refuses to see reason and will give others every chance to hurt her, over and over again. We cannot stop her.” Mr. Iida’s mouth was set in a grim line, and for the first time Draco truly remembered she was his daughter. He had only ever thought about it from Miriam's side, her father an old hard taskmaster to be obeyed and respected, reluctantly or otherwise. It had never occurred to him that everything that broke his heart about his best friend would break her father's as well. “She is headstrong, and we both know telling her what to do will only cause her to draw further away. I am the only family she has left-- soon, it will be you.”
“They’re almost all done. Just the garnishes to finish and then you can put the bread in for the morning rush.” He sighed for possibly the 27th time in the last 72 hours, and wondered to himself if he wouldn’t have been better off never meeting Miriam at all. She put a hand on his arm, and he almost dropped the jar of preserved blossoms.
“No, Mother! Just regular--” if he thought any more about what it might mean to have to close Iida tomorrow, to face Miriam’s father-- ”just regular.”
Draco was frozen the whole time she was out, unable to do anything for fear of being seen. It seemed an age before she strode back in. He jumped.
“I KNOW there was a little-- Draco,” Miriam froze, finger almost comically pointed at Harry’s easy, open hands. He felt her smell all around her as she jumped in his arms, and he was glad that he’d already cried.
He almost dropped the paper. So much history. All down to those three names. He knew he should feel something-- bitterness, gratitude, something-- but he just felt tired. He stuffed it in his bag, walking home barely conscious, eyes closed for what seemed only a brief moment before his alarm blared.
.” He wiped tears from his eyes, sitting up a little straighter. “You can’t tell me that isn’t the most objectively hilarious thing since my father was chased around the manor grounds by peacocks for twenty minutes in his best clothes.
“I’m sorry about Ron, I mean, my friend, he means well, it’s just that he’s obnoxiously particular, not that we knew that before, obviously, I--”
“Right then. The financiers need doing, double the sweet basil for the gift sets. Cottage loaves’ second proofing will be done in ten. Off you fuck.”
“You’re beginning to sound like my father.” Rage was starting to simmer through his veins, and he felt a little more steady on his feet because of it. Weasley shrugged.
“They’ve asked Iida to cater the Reopening ceremony.” He used all his years of breeding to keep his voice flat as possible. She would already know about it-- A Black is a Black, after all. Her eyes went dark.
He smiled into the cherry blossom paste he was blending, carefully piping it into the buttery nests. She was the only one allowed communication (his rules), and he adored her even more than he had at age seven, hands in her skirts and stealing her canapes.
“Oh, this is so rich,” she said, still cackling. “Take your break now, love. I’ll bring him round the back,” she said, wiping her teary hands on her apron as she kicked the door open.
“Don’t ask me, it’s Draco who’ll be up late with this nonsense. If he hadn’t have said yes, you and your lot would be begging at an Ottolenghi.”
“You tit. You didn’t sleep last night, did you?” She shook her head, and his eyes widened as he stared at the array of perfect pieces, laid out like precious jewels, apricot jelly twinkling as it dripped from the brush in her hands.
“No eating at the prep counter, you know the rules,” Miriam Iida said sternly, popping the slice into her mouth with a lazy smirk. He pointed dramatically as she chewed. She shrugged.
“When they arrive, I’m guessing you’d like to stay in the back? You’re welcome to put on a mask if you’re worried. You take care of the morning baking, and and they shouldn’t be too long,” she said softly, and he nodded.
He didn’t realize he was running out of breath till he gasped for air. There was silence for a few minutes.
Sure enough, he felt the fog lift as soon as he heard three voices chorus in the dining room. It was inevitable now, and so it would be. The sooner this started (and ended), the sooner he could go back to his mundane life, and his mundane problems, and
She blinked at him. Harry held his breath, but it was unnecessary. She threw her head back and let out a laugh, a full bellied guffaw that nearly threw him back with its force; Harry liked her better for it instantly.
“It’s fine,” Draco said, voice sounding strange to himself. “It’s over. If the pasties were acceptable, take the order. He glanced up at the door to see Granger’s face, worried eyes wide, and felt a rush of anger.
“How can you.. Do you really think we can do it at all? Will this redeem us?” He said quietly. She stilled.
“Of course!” her eyes lit up. “You must have known each other at school. What was our Draco like, eh?”
“Petits in the oven, ta love.” She barely looked at him, and when she did, he saw his tiredness reflected.
“Come in!” he said automatically, and Weasley strode in in smart pastel green scrubs (his mother had such an eye for clothing transfiguration).
“What’s a story?” Miriam’s eyes were soft, and Draco could tell she was pleased. Whatever scheme she was hatching up, it clearly involved the two of them getting along.
“Take a Quiche Lorraine with you, you haven’t eaten all day!” Mr. Iida shouted through the swinging doors. Draco dutifully took one, stuffing it in his mouth and fastening his coat.
kill you myself, by the way. Whatever he’s done, it’s bad enough that he’s never felt he could turn to any of you, and never tried. Whatever weird little cult world you two are in, he has left behind for this. He screams in his sleep every night to be taken away, to not see whatever horrors you have seen. Is that not fucking apology
house, stealing my sister and torturing my family. Even in the early days, my love, this house held nothing but fear and rage. You and your father were my only joys, and once you both were gone, I had nothing to do but sit with it all. This would be a purpose, my love. A challenge.” She sat down next to him, pulling his stiff body towards him. He buried his head in her shoulder.
“Welcome to moving forward, Malfoy.” Ron clapped him on the shoulder, and Draco started. “Good to have you with us.” And before Draco could retort, he Disapparated.
Draco raised an eyebrow. Plenty of important people-- movie stars, government officials, professional athletes-- all of them had to eat, and everyone knew that the tiny bright haven of Iida was the best place to source it.
“Mother, I--” he was cut off by a second set of footsteps, and a too-fucking familiar set of spectacles and untameable hair popped up behind her. He looked at her eyes, twinkling below delicate eyebrows, and realized he’d been had.
Too late now, he thought to himself--but breathed a sigh of relief all the same when she answered the phone.
He hung his apron on the hook as he walked outside to see his archenemy and best friend glaring at each other across the alley.
Draco knew he’d regret his words before they came out of his mouth, but Potter always knew how to take away his filter.
“I’m here because we can’t afford to lose you, Malfoy, to lose anyone. Why do you think we’re doing this? Why we changed Azkaban from the ground up? The great enemies are dead. Grindelwald, Voldemort, they succeeded because we divided ourselves before they ever began. It’s time to bring back our own. You are the last of your line, and one of the only left with roots going back to the Sacred 28.”
“--staying a bit later to finish the samples? I know Papa will want to, but his backs dead fucked, and he can’t be doing such delicate work for that long. I’ll pay you time and a haaaaallllllf.” She sang in his ear, and he rolled his eyes swatting at her and feeling giddy with relief.
“You’re tetchy. Why so tetchy, my little star? Is one of them fit, is it that? No use being frightened hiding back here, you know, you’re right edible yourself, fit enough, and--”
“Miriam, there are a total of four tables, if they’re stupid enough to get lost they don’t deserve to be here,” he said snappishly. She frowned, narrowing her eyes.
“Feisty little toff, you.” Her eyes twinkled even as she acquiesced. He watched carefully, unwilling to admit his own butterflies as she bit delicately into the cooling pastry. She chewed for a moment, and Draco held his breath. What if it was wrong? What if his measurements were off? Oh Merlin, had he used kosher salt instead of caster sugar, fucking--
“Yeah, sorry, I used to be-- it’s scoliosis. Had to stop dancing but otherwise right as rain. It doesn't say that on my chart?” she asked, waving at the file in Weasley’s hand. His eyes got big.
you and you don’t like it… promise me you’ll let me keep you safe,” he said, voice thick with how many times he wished he’d said it before now, and her soft brown eyes echoed the concern in his.
“How come I didn’t hear about this on the tel? You’re telling me that no newspaper, no tv station-- this is some cult shit, murdered fuckers eve--”
“Okay wait, so why weren’t you arrested too? If your father-- I don’t understand, what about your mother?”
“Finally!” Mr Iida’s pleased voice boomed out, “About time, young man. Always good to see a reformed youth back in our doors. Come to finally buy something, have you?”
“Of course, my dove. You’ve just come upon Draco and I getting reacquainted. We’ll be seeing so much of each other from now on that I thought we might bury the hatchet.” Liam kissed her, and Draco felt ill.
“I know what to do. Tell them we’ll take it.” The words came out before he knew it, and she arched an eyebrow.
“The light was red. That hit Miriam,” he croaked out after a moment, tearing his gaze away from his mother, and she nodded.
you’re on about,” she said, her aggressive tone a stark contrast to the gentle passing of the cup. “Or who you are to my best friend, but if you continue skulking around here I’ll not hesitate to find you and murder you in your sleep.” Her voice was tight and deadly, and he opened his mouth to reassure her, but the words caught in his throat. He sipped his coffee in lieu of a reply, and was pleasantly surprised.
That night, for the first time in over a month, he firecalled his mother, her eyed crinkling like Christmas wrapping as she described her garden.
“Not to worry, they’re just old… acquaintances, from school. Brings back unpleasant memories, you know how it is, I’m sure.”
Draco felt wrung out, and Weasley looked the same. They sat in silence for what felt like an eternity.
Mr. Iida watched her go, turning to Draco a few silent moments after her footsteps left their range.
“I know, I know,” she said, as if reading his mind, “but we’ve got no special orders this month, and the compensation is enough to run the shop for months and give you a bonus besides. Anyway, someone will come by tomorrow to talk. Has to be early morning though apparently, so would you mind--?”
“Anyway, I--  my mother and I, on separate occasions, happened to save his life. Out of absolute cowardice on my part, mind you, but it was enough  to exonerate us with just a slap on the wrist and a chunk of g-gold.”
This uses events from movies rather than books for better continuity. Keep safe in these strange times.
“Right, er, sorry,” he said, stepping to the side hastily. He didn’t remember walking across the street, but here he was, face practically pressed against the glass as he stared at the glass case full of delicate pastries. The fragrance wafted over him as the man swept out, and his stomach growled loudly enough to be embarrassing.
“You’re only hurting yourself, you know,” she said, cleaning up his drink despite his feeble protests.
“I concur. I meant to do some research last night--” meaning ask Tilly, his mother’s last remaining house elf, for the recipe, “-- but I got a bit distracted talking to my mother.” He turned to the list airily, and was stopped.
“Is that how you met?” Harry blurted out, looking immediately regretful. Draco shook his head, laughing incredulously. He needed a drink. A very large, very strong drink. He raised a groomed eyebrow at the still sorrowful looking Potter, and wondered again how he ever managed his social life. Granger or Weasley, most likely.
“No, you don’t understand!” Potter pulled at his hair, and something about it was so familiar Draco’s heart ached a little.
It felt so odd to Draco, after so many years of silent darkness. Something about it felt eerie, a ghostly echo of happier times now tainted with haunting screams.
He had just enough thought in his head to think, ‘of course it’s you’ before his consciousness left him and Miriam in a pool, platinum blonde spreading thinly against a shining brown sea.
“I’m beginning to think everyone at that school of yours was dead barking,” she said with a grimace. Harry chuckled, tension leaving his body.
“Look, I-- oh fuck it, can you meet me at Primrose Hill in an hour? And bring a coffee!” she clicked off before he could answer, and his phone buzzed in his hand.
The rest of the week passed by in relative quiet compared to the excitement of the past few days. Even his day off (which he wouldn’t have bothered taking except for Miriam’s insistence) was dull, ignoring his coworker’s suggestive eyebrow wag for the comfort of his house and a cuppa. All was boring, mundane, repetitious.
“Can’t we bake them into more curved shapes? Or somehow refine them a bit? They’ll look so out of place with the others.” She picked up one half, inhaling the fragrant, softly spiced steam.
Draco thought his eyes might fall out of their sockets. Maybe there was some kind of camera, some Skeeteresque reporter ready to jump out and capture his surprise on film. He narrowed his eyes.
“Mother I think you should relay that message to Harry and bring the Healer as soon as possible. I’ll take it from here,” he said crisply, and she touched Miriam’s shoulders for a moment as Draco took her place, holding his friend close.
Weasley made a tortured face that Draco realized was an attempt at sympathy. Maybe he should go on that walk and be murdered just to never experience this level of humiliation ever again. Draco turned to head back inside.
“A little over a week, really, as far as it being, well, official-- I was always going to tell you, I meant to tell you sooner, but you were--” she made a series of flailing motions, and he groaned for the umpteenth time.
“Why are you here?” Draco felt the words burst out of him, and felt green at the desperation he heard in his own tone. “I’m not bothering you, not underfoot or in the way. I paid for my crimes, though we both know it wasn’t enough and won’t ever be enough. Can’t you leave me in peace?” To his own abject horror, he started to feel tears welling up in his eyes.
He stood till he had calmed down, and as if on cue, he heard a rustling of skirts. She looked up at him evenly.
Miriam was doubled over in laughter, clutching her sides, and Draco wasn’t sure who to kill first-- her, Potter, or himself.
The next morning he was up before dawn, London barely swirling to life around him. He loved this time of day, sky barely light, ears full of the sounds of busses rumbling to life and sleepy binmen hacking with laughter. It was a time where barely anybody took a moment to notice the posh blond with perfect posture picking his way through the streets.
“A year?” Draco said, feeling the tips of his hair crackle with magic. “You’ve been lying to me for a
“Do you have any other family? People who might be in danger?” Narcissa continued, and Miriam shook her head.
How did he end up here? What had occurred to lead Malfoy to this point? How did a pureblood darling, bastion of magic, become a Muggle baker in the middle of London?
“Cheers. Stay here,” she said, yanking open the clearly heavy steel door with the ease of a feather. Harry idly wondered if that strength was about to be used on him.
“NO!” Weasley jumped. “No no no, shite, I am fucking rubbish at this.” Weasley put his hands over his eyes.
“No, my dragon. I do not think it will. But for the first time we have a chance to make something new! How foolish would we have to be, to let our regret for a past we cannot control prevent us from creating a future we can?”
Not that Draco was all that observant today, either. He was painfully aware of exactly who would be invading his space in a few hours’ time. Would Granger have told them? She must have.
“Take me to her?” He asked, and she nodded, procuring a delicate vial of her homemade Pepper-Up from her skirts. The taste was so familiar, indulgent with love on his tongue. He burst into tears.
“Thank you,” Draco said hoarsely after a moment. “Excuse me, um, need some water,” he continued, getting up and rushing to the kitchen without glancing back.
As the potion made its way slowly towards Harry’s stomach, it made Harry shiver as if feverish at first, and then, abruptly, his senses felt awake again and the headache vanished completely. Harry sighed of relief, slumped back into his bed, and closed his eyes again. It was Friday if he wasn’t mistaken, so it wouldn’t do too much harm if he skipped the lessons one morning. Besides, he had been so tired that week he wouldn’t even be able to learn anything anyway, the brain needs sleep and rest and all that.
Harry turned his head so that he could see Draco’s eyes. “Of course I do, wouldn’t be with you if I thought you’d be the same person as when we met for the first time,” he said. “Though it doesn’t change the fact that you
“If I knew I wouldn’t run around the corridors, now would I?” Draco snapped and started to walk again at a fast pace.
They held each other for a long while, not saying anything. Harry raised his hand to Draco’s cheek and started caressing it soothingly. After a while, Harry could feel Draco relaxing in his arms, and they both seemed to be able to breathe more easily.
“Er, they don’t actually know,” Harry said as he ran his fingers through his hair. “I mean, I’ve told them I’m bent but haven’t told them I’m seeing someone.”
“Didn’t know you cared about fairness,” Draco whispered into Harry’s ear, straddling him and holding his hands tightly against the floor so that Harry had no chance to escape. “Let’s see who’s going to laugh now,” Draco said, trying to get hold of both Harry’s hands at the same time with only one hand.
Malfoy gave a bark of derisive laughter. “Really, Weasley? Do you really think the attention Potter gets is something to brag about?
But Malfoy didn’t seem to notice Harry’s stupid comment. “Right. So, what if you pick up the ingredients while I prepare everything else?”
“Yeah. I want this to work out, but I don’t want us to hurt each other. I’m fine with casual taunting, you know, Scarhead, disturbed and dangerous, Potter stinks and stuff like that, but not with… personal things. Do you get what I mean?”
“I’m curious,” Ginny said, breaking the silence. “Have you known about them all this time?” she asked, turning to Blaise.
The water felt like millions of daggers on every new inch of skin that slowly went under the surface.
On the fifth of July, Harry sat at the kitchen table at Grimmauld Place with Ron and Hermione, all three of them waiting nervously for an owl to bring the Daily Prophet. Each Sunday, the paper announced who would be executed next week and who they should therefore go and try to save by repeating the worn phrases of wrongness, cruelty, and illegality. Not that Harry had much hope left the Wizengamot would listen to them, it had just become rather a habit of sorts.
“So, you’re saying I should, what, give him another chance?” Harry asked, flabbergasted. He would have never guessed Molly wouldn’t only accept his feelings for Draco but also encourage him to follow those feelings.
To Harry’s luck, green flames burst suddenly up in the fireplace, and Hermione rushed through without saying or asking anything before appearing in the kitchen, looking furious.
Draco pulled back a little so that he could see Harry’s face. “I am not a good person, Harry. I’ve –”
“Yes. She’s a bit of a horror, though, teasing me whenever she can. But she actually covered up for me so that I could come here to see you yesterday,” Harry said and groaned as a sudden realization hit him. “I’ve no idea how I’m going to explain to Hermione and Ron where I’ve been for the whole night.”
"Did they open the doors already?" Pansy asked irritated, trying to peek between Draco and Blaise in her giant and horrifyingly pink dress robes.
“Yeah, thanks, I’ll try to keep that in mind,” Harry muttered. Though Ginny might be right, the phone was rather big, with an antenna and all, so it definitely was visible to everyone who just happened to glance at him briefly.
Hermione considered him for a moment before saying anything. “We’re alright,” she said slowly. “And I agree with Ron, keep us updated about what there’s going on in your life. Don’t shut us out like this. Ever again.”
All of a sudden Draco felt his body freeze. For some inexplicable reason, Draco felt a strong and odd pull rising rapidly towards the git. There was something about Potter's stupid, messy hair, his stupid clumsiness, stupid, ugly scar and, admittedly, quite fine dress robes that made Draco feel his mouth going dry and suddenly forgetting all the taunts and hexes he had studied fervently for this very occasion. Draco's stomach flipped as he felt an already familiar fluttery feeling in his chest, this time just much more vivid and petrifying than ever before. Draco's head was totally blank, and he could do nothing but stare at Potter with a somewhat shocked expression on his face.
“The only problem seems to be that neither of us has a place where to charge the battery. But I’m sure it should last if we had the phones turned off always when we don’t use them.”
“I can imagine,” Andromeda said. “But it would be good if you two could learn to tolerate each other in the same place. You don’t have to talk to him or even be in the same room if you don’t want to, but I’m not sending him away and I still want you to visit Teddy and me as often as you like.”
“Quite poorly,” Draco answered coolly. “Look, how much I’d love to have a little chit-chat with you, I don’t really have time for it right now. So, if you didn’t have anything else –”
“Merlin, I had no idea Muggles can do this kind of things,” Zabini said as Harry handed the phone back to Draco.
The corners of Draco’s mouth turned into a humourless smile. No matter what he would have done during the war, the result would have remained the same for him. Maybe the only way to survive would have been changing the side, but he would never have had the guts to do it. And his parents would have
Harry’s mouth fell slightly open. He had probably never experienced anything that magical, taking into account he was a wizard after all.
Draco was silent for a while. “It’s none of your business,” he said, sounding much more uncertain now.
Draco is just trying to breathe, just trying to get through this whole ordeal intact, without Umbridge finding out; without his parents being hurt. He doesn't actually
It seems Father managed to ensure that Aunt Andromeda’s daughter only lost her husband and an arm, rather than losing her life. Went quite a ways to mend things between his mother and his aunt, according to Father, anyway.
He wanders the halls of the Manor, halls where horrors seep from the very walls and foundations, until suddenly they have changed. Slowly but surely, the Manor is changing around him, it looks less and less like the place of his faded memories, and less and less like the place of his nightmares.
But he doesn't know their names. He cannot remember. He cannot call them by name, he cannot ask them to stay.
Harry shakes his head and with a swift flick of his wand makes the dirty plates and cutlery float into the kitchen towards the sink. “No, I’ve got it. You just sit tight.”
They wait long enough to hear a door slam, and footsteps disappear, and then Harry springs into action. He casts stupefy on the remaining Herder without blinking, and then he and Draco immediately Apparate down to the factory floor.
of light that occurs then, and she shrieks in shock as she quickly throws her arms up to cover her eyes.
"Well if you don't want to help me find Draco," Parkinson says, voice rising in tone until it becomes shrill, "Then go back to the compartment! Stop wasting my time!"
A god dying means a new one will be born to take their place, and their domains will remain untouched. But as the God of the Stars did not die no new god could be born. And so the stars went out in the sky, and they have not regained their glow in the century that has passed.
"I... What were they rivals about?" Draco tilts his head to the side, a bemused expression on his face.
“Yes, Healer Binns, we sent a message immediately. But they just left for the night, it’s entirely possible it won’t reach them until morning if we’re unlucky.” The second voice sounds sad.
No one tells her, of course, but the mood of the room has shifted. It’s no longer full-on panic, it’s more of a mix between fear and amusement at Umbridge’s expense. She really has made herself an enemy of most of the school; even the people who believed the Ministry lies seem to hate her.
He frowns and looks around the Room, trying to see who could have conjured a room like this, when suddenly a door to Harry's right opens and out steps...
you sighing about, Draco?” Pansy is suddenly all up in Draco’s face, and her red-painted lips scrunch together.
Setting up Apparition points as they move closer to wherever this amulet is going to lead them will be dangerous, and time-consuming, but necessary. If the amulet really will take them to the Main Crystal, the
Those cowards completely buckled beneath the Dark Lord’s corrupt regime and started sending muggleborns to Azkaban for “stealing magic”, after all. Why would they spare Draco’s father for
She lets out a loud undignified snort. If the end of the war has been good for anything, it’s certainly allowed Pansy the freedom to act as she wants, not as she’s expected to. It’s nice. Draco likes her far better like this, headstrong and wilful and entirely without any attempts to tamp it down behind the façade of a simpering, respectable pureblood lady.
"Cassiopeia... Cassiopeia... Cassiopeia..." He murmurs the name over and over as he lies on the sofa, Cassiopeia walking all over him. Up and down the length of his body.
They haven’t yet gotten on his case about grandchildren, but he’s fairly certain that’s because they’re still reeling from the war and having nearly lost him entirely. They’ll probably start hinting about wanting grandchildren to spoil sooner or later. Of course, considering the fact that Draco is—and has been for a while as far as they know—depressingly single, they’re not likely to be pushing so hard. Probably just gentle nudges wondering if he, perhaps, has someone special in his life.
and Draco would have been blissfully unaware that their relationship had been a sham all along. He would have left it slightly disappointed, maybe a bit heartbroken, but at least not… not feeling
“Darling…” Pansy’s voice is soft. “Blaise and I have refused to let Potter explain anything—though believe me, you and I will be having words regarding the whole ‘relationship with Potter’ thing later—but… If you want to hear him out, we can be there for you.”
“Oh my darling,” Mother says, tears springing up in her eyes as she clutches Draco’s hand to her chest. “I’ve been so worried for you, I’m so glad you’re finally back with us.”
Draco burrows in closer and smiles as Harry’s arm wraps around his shoulders and he feels lips press against his head. What a sap.
Ron and Hermione are gone, and he's going to have to live with that. But at least he still has Draco with him, right here on the front lines. Right here in the midst of the insanity that is teenagers trying to stop adults who are trying to murder all Muggles, and all muggle-borns, and most half-bloods.
, I am going to cast a few spells to clean us up, because I am tired of being dirty and wet. I'm going to repair the tent too.”
“I do like the sound of that,” Blaise says and they head back out into the sunshine to soak up some sun.
place. Because you've been at my current apartment a few times, and I know you haven't exactly been impressed with it." He laughs awkwardly and shrugs again. "I wasn't thinking. I fucked up. Since I wanted to keep it a secret that I wanted a nice place like that, and since I wasn't sure yet if
Malfoy, so the only reason Ron is even worried about it is because Harry's been… staring. Obsessively almost.
Potter and his ilk apparently made a sweep through the Ministry and Wizengamot and got rid of most of the old guard due to their actions during the war—Merlin’s beard, Draco doesn’t know how they got the power to do something like
It is the least dignified thing Adriana has ever seen Draco do, but without hesitation he throws himself in the man's arms, wrapping his arms around his neck and allowing the man to spin him a full circle.
A glance back at Umbridge tells Harry that she sort of looks like Malfoy just slugged her in the face.
Draco feels dizzy, he’s not quite sure what is going on, or what chances of his are supposed to be better, but he takes the potions and drinks it all down before he can even question it.
However, Harry has learned from his mistakes. This time… this time there will not be any kitchen fires, no allergies, no food dropped on the ground,
A thought of Malfoy's pink lips and the feeling of his slim body pressed against Harry's pops into Harry's head and he suddenly feels all warm.
with Draco Malfoy, his childhood enemy. Draco’s going to be sick, he’s going to throw up and scream and cry…
And so the God of the Sun lay the burden of ruling the Heavens on the shoulders of his two friends temporarily and descended down to earth in mortal form, to find his lover and bring him back to the heavens.
He follows after her at a small distance; he doesn’t want Draco to see him, but he wants to see Draco’s reaction.
Harry scrunched his nose at that, he doesn't like the sound of that at all. He's just about to tell Ron off, lie through his teeth that he wasn't staring, when Seamus speaks up.
to make sure that there will be no need for any visits to the hospital and no need to put out any fires. This time, it’s going to work out just fine.
He was stupid to think there could ever be anything nice and real between him and Potter. It was naive, without a doubt too. If the general public, most of who were never directly affected by Draco or his parents but rather just Voldemort and the Death Eaters in general, for the most part can’t stand him, why would
have plans for it, then maybe Draco should take his friends somewhere else. Perhaps the Monaco Villa instead. It’s very close, so they could easily get together with his parents if that’s the case.
His friends all breathe out loud sighs of relief, and Harry understands them. He was worried that McGonagall would have sided with the NMO and that they would have to fight her too… Not to mention somehow stage a break-in of Hogwarts to save the students.
Harry drags Malfoy inside. “Make sure he doesn’t leave!” he shouts as he runs up to their sleeping quarters, leaving Malfoy in the common room with Hermione and Ron.
Dobby straightened his back but looked still seemingly suspiciously at Draco. “Is there something Dobby can help master Draco Malfoy with, sir?”
Harry hesitated. He had already shared his fear of being possessed by Voldemort with Ginny and Hermione, but it was still bothering him so much he felt like having something itching under his skin and he couldn’t just get rid of the feeling. “I just… What if Voldemort can control me? And I just haven’t realized it yet. Nobody has.”
“Alright,” Draco said, shrugging and taking Teddy from Andromeda before he followed Ginny back outside.
As Harry was bringing up the rear, he noticed Draco was still sending nervous looks in his direction even though he was clearly trying his best to concentrate on the conversation with Hermione at the same time. Soon, Draco made his excuses to Hermione, slowed down his pacing, and came to walk beside Harry.
Draco was completely lost, not at all aware of his surroundings. When Draco arrived at a bridge that crossed over the Thames, he stopped in the middle of it. As Draco looked at the river flowing slowly underneath, he felt like his mind came back to his body, bit by bit. He had even forgotten he was crying, but now he could feel warm tears running down his face and see them fall down into the river. Suddenly, Draco had to gasp for air as the realization of what had just happened hit him. He had just been disowned. He was no longer regarded as his parents’ son.
Friday afternoon and evening at the Burrow felt pleasant but weird as Harry could hardly remember the house being as empty as it was now. Once Arthur and George had come home as well, they all ate dinner at the kitchen table where over half of the chairs were unoccupied. Harry wondered if that was how it usually felt when all of Molly and Arthur’s children had already started at Hogwarts or, like in Bill’s or Charlie’s cases, had already moved out on their own after graduating. Harry, though, had always been at the Burrow when almost all of the Weasleys had been present, so the silence and calmness felt a bit… unnerving.
On Saturday Harry said his goodbyes to Ron and Hermione, sniffling and coughing slightly just in case, before heading to the kitchens to get the picnic basket and then rushing excitedly to the seventh floor. He put his Invisibility Cloak on and waited in front of the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy. It’d be much easier and less risky to just wait for Draco inside the Room, but as this was Draco’s first time in the Room, Harry had to explain to him how to get in there.
. If there happens something bad during your childhood or adolescence, like you’re for example physically or mentally abused at home or you’re bullied at school, your brain creates a lot of toxic thought patterns that form thoughts such as
“Like why did Severus have to tell my parents about us?” Draco asked gloomily, making Harry get goosebumps. That was one of the topics Harry would love to ignore until his dying day if it only was possible. “He told me he wanted to save me, but I wasn’t safe at the Manor.”
“Oh, grow up. As if anyone cared about what I do here as long as I’m out of the way. Besides, I’ll be gone soon enough anyway,” Harry said.
,” he waved his wand again, and red sparkles erupted from the tip of it, stunning the Auror and making him collapse on the ground, unconscious.
Slowly and with trembling steps, Draco started to walk downstairs, taking support from the walls and railings while walking.
in the first place,” Draco said. “That makes us even, in case Ginny tried to cheat. Which I highly doubt.”
“Yes. It’s not really that unusual. Muggles have even specific support groups for people who have either left voluntarily or been kicked out. I doubt there’s anything similar in the Wizarding world, even though there definitely should be,” Hermione said gloomily. “Think about Padfoot, for example. He didn’t believe in blood purity nor pureblood traditions, such as marrying another pureblood and producing an heir, so he left voluntarily. His family didn’t take it well, and as you know, he was made it very clear that there’s no coming back and that he was no longer a part of their family. Padfoot was lucky to have close friends who weren’t part of the same, toxic system, so it was easier to leave. If you don’t have that kind of support it’s really scary to even think about leaving.”
“Harry!” Ron exclaimed happily, looking like he had already had a few cups of whatever Seamus had poured him.
Suddenly, a small and relieved smile appeared on Narcissa’s face. “Thank you, Draco, that’s all I’m asking for,” she said, turning around and starting to pace away from Harry’s doorstep. “Oh, and Mr. Potter?” she said abruptly, turning her face to Harry.
“No. It sounds a great idea,” Harry said, actually meaning it. It felt hard to not have a proper funeral for Sirius, so commemorating him in at least some way made Harry feel a bit better. “How did you smuggle it in?” he asked Blaise, pointing at the Firewhisky bottle.
“We as who?” Draco cut Harry short. Harry felt uneasy. He hadn’t wanted to keep DA as a secret, but it felt somehow bad to talk about it to Draco. Mainly because Draco was a prefect and knowing about DA would put him in a difficult position, but also because there were no Slytherin students in DA at all. At first, leaving the Slytherins out had felt an obvious solution, but as the autumn had proceeded, Harry had started to ponder if he and his friends were now the ones being prejudiced.
During the first days back at school, Harry tried to ignore Draco as much as possible. Which was quite a challenge as Draco kept on trying to make eye contact with Harry and following him in order to make him listen to him. Once Draco had almost managed to catch Harry but, to Harry’s luck, Hermione had just happened to appear from around the corner. She had eyed both Harry and Draco suspiciously, as if scaring them to jump at each other’s throats abruptly, until Draco had had to turn around and leave. After that Harry had made sure he never walked alone anywhere as there was no chance Draco would approach him whenever he was with his Gryffindor friends.
On the other hand, now that Harry came to think of it, the dream simply couldn’t be real at any level as Malfoy would never lower himself to ask Harry to help him. Not that Harry would even own him that. During the War, Malfoy had saved Harry and his friends at the Manor whereas Harry had saved Malfoy from the Fiendfyre, so they were perfectly even.
Draco gulped as he felt something warm spreading inside his chest. “Thank you, Dobby,” he said as the elf let go of his arm.
“This is not a laughing matter,” Draco snapped indignantly, throwing a sofa cushion in Zabini’s direction.
I thought for a long time how I'd write the Sectumsembra scene, but at this point it didn't seem plausible for Harry to use the curse on Draco. I think it somehow makes sense in the books as Harry's a bit act-before-thinking type of person, but I don't think he could see Draco as an enemy anymore in this story, no matter how angry he was at him.
“Oh, you’ve already made some tea, good,” Andromeda said, coming abruptly into the kitchen in her white nightgown, making Draco startle. “Is it camomile?” she asked, sitting down in front of him and pouring herself a cup.
For a split-second, Harry let his eyes rest on the other boy. The corridors were always quite dark in the evenings, and usually only the torches created some dim, eerie light. This night, though, the sky was clear, and the almost-full-moon shone through the windows, making Malfoy’s blond hair glisten as if small silvery stars were hiding in it. His skin looked even paler than usual, making a strong contrast with the black robes he was wearing. Even though it was dark and a bit blurry, Harry had no problem recognizing Malfoy’s characteristic sharp and slender features. He’s beautiful, Harry thought, startled.
“A bit shocked,” Draco muttered sarcastically under his breath. “But you don’t have feelings for her?” he continued, sounding uncertain.
“I’ll explain to you later. Let’s eat something? Dobby fixed us a picnic basket again,” Harry said, opening the basket.
Harry and Draco glanced at each other, terrified. They didn’t say anything as they buttoned their shirts hastily and started following Snape who strode in front of them, black robes fluttering behind him.
“Do you miss all of that? I mean, the Manor and your parents?” Harry asked, noticing that the look on Draco’s face turned grim. “Sorry, you don’t have to answer to that,” he continued hastily, regretting his big mouth. It must be the Pepper-Up Potion that made Harry’s brain feel like cotton candy and made him ask and say so stupid things that morning.
end hatred with hatred,” Hermione said. “I promise I’ll go and try to talk to both Kingsley and the Wizengamot tomorrow and present them some case examples of earlier Wizarding and Muggle wars. They have to start to listen to reason at some point.”
When the day to go back to Hogwarts came at last, Harry felt both anxious and relieved. He would finally get to see Draco. The first thing Harry would do at Hogwarts would be finding Draco and dragging him into an alcove, the Room of Requirement or the Boathouse, the place didn’t really matter as long as they would get to be alone. But the wait felt too long and the last hours on the train seemed to go by extremely slowly, and not even meeting his friends after the holidays or the lunch with Slughorn’s club seemed to make the time go faster. After the lunch, though, Harry had come up with a rather spontaneous idea to sneak into Draco’s compartment with his Invisibility Cloak and hide on the luggage rack.
After the third time they passed the Room, the doorknob appeared. Harry opened the door with slightly shaking hands, and they both stepped in.
And then, without a warning, Draco turned his broom towards the ground and dived before Harry could blink. Harry dodged the quaffle and tried to catch a glimpse of what Draco was seeing, and there it was, the snitch, hovering only a few inches above the ground in the middle of the pitch.
Zabini’s eyes widened even more if possible. “Well, well, the Golden Boy is full of surprises, isn’t he?” Zabini said as Harry squirmed, feeling a little uncomfortable. He didn’t still fancy to talk about his sorting for some reason. “Hm, I could’ve definitely seen you in Slytherin,” Zabini continued thoughtfully.
So, as you may have noticed by now, I'm trying to follow the canon quite tightly (at least still at this point). I pondered for a long time if I should include Harry and Cho's kiss in this story or not, but somehow I could see quite clearly poor Harry ending up in a situation like this.
Draco didn’t belong to those people. Actually, he was feeling exactly the opposite as he strode along the school corridors, vision blurring and heart hammering hard in his chest. Something had gone wrong. Really, really wrong.
All the Slytherins turned their heads, trying to see what Blaise was talking about. "The one with Krum, is it really the Mudblood?" Pansy shrieked, eyes widening in amaze when she saw Granger walking and smiling widely in her floaty, periwinkle-blue dress robes. Not only were her dress robes dashing, someone had done miracles to her usually-so-bushy hair as well.
“No, of course not,” Hermione said, sounding confused as none of them had noticed when and how Ginny had appeared next to them. “Just don’t be late, Harry, we’ve got Transfigurations in ten minutes,” she added as Harry snatched his bag and followed Ginny rapidly out of the Great Hall.
“I know, I don’t even want you to promise me something like that,” Harry said. “We don’t have to plan our future here and right now; we can take it slowly and see how things go. And when either of us is having a bad moment and things seem hopeless, we'll take it just one day at a time. And if a day feels too much, we’ll take it just one hour at a time. And when even that feels too much, we’ll take it just one minute at a time. Do you think you could do that?”
Harry couldn’t yet quite understand what had happened. The alcohol had definitely made him much happier and more carefree, and he had just kind of let himself follow his feelings, not really caring about the consequences nor how rational it might be to kiss a person he had so mixed feelings for.
Harry closed his eyes for a moment and took a deep breath. “I’m okay with usual taunting, I really am. But insulting my dead mum, or me not having my mum alive, it’s way beyond.”
“Look at me when I’m talking to you!” Malfoy shouted and grabbed Harry’s arms pushing him harshly against the wall and pinning him there with his body weight.
Draco’s eyes widened comically. “We’re on a pet-name basis now? Merlin, this is progressing fast. We’ve barely just started on the first-name basis.”
“Yes, I just thought… Well, we haven’t really been hanging out with each other that much and –” Draco began to ramble, but Harry cut him short.
side. He had known for a long time towards the end of the War that his family wouldn’t have survived if the Dark Lord had won. The mistakes they had made had been so huge that they had quickly descended to the lowest, most despised level in the Death Eater ranks. There was no way their mistakes would have been forgiven; the Dark Lord didn’t even know the whole fucking concept of forgiveness. But it had come as a big surprise to Draco that even the holy and pure light side had forgotten the same concept completely. After the War, he hadn’t expected any coddling or patting on the shoulder, and he hadn’t even dreamed of being able to avoid a sentence in Azkaban, but neither had he been able to even imagine that the winning side would require him to give up his life.
“Er, no, I didn’t. But that’s beside the point,” Harry said hastily and took a long breath in. “Would you like to hang out with me, the bloke I’m seeing and his friend? On Valentine’s Day. Here at Hogwarts.”
Harry flushed. “Erm, I think I started thinking about that… option more during last summer. I happened to scream Cedric’s name in my sleep quite a lot and my cousin asked if he’s my boyfriend, so, well.”
“No, you weren’t. I think he actually got quite fond of you during the fifth year, you started to treat him so much better,” Harry said softly.
Hermione narrowed her eyes. “If you’re sure,” she said suspiciously. “Can we get you something from there?”
“Ah, Draco, I think you’d appreciate this card in your collection,” Blaise said when he had checked whose picture he had got.
Harry felt a bit guilty because the idea hadn’t even crossed his mind. Now that he thought about it, Dobby had fixed them amazing picnic baskets quite a few times already, and now Harry felt like he was taking Dobby’s kindness for granted.
The following days in Harry’s life passed by like a blur. All the classes started, and there was already more than enough homework. Hermione would tell them it was because of the O.W.L.s, but Harry thought there would never be a reason big enough to justify piles and piles of homework in their first week. Adding other obligatory stuff in the mess, like eating and pleasant writing sessions with Umbridge, Harry felt like there weren’t enough hours in the day.
Coming to stand to Draco’s side, Harry’s eyes met the one person he could never have guessed to stand there on his threshold.
“I missed you, too,” Draco murmured, pulling Harry into a long, languid kiss. “Harry?” he whispered into Harry’s mouth.
“I remember I was quite horrified when Harry told me who he was seeing during the fifth year. I thought he had gone all nuts because the only version of Draco I had seen had been the infuriating git. It was quite startling to see how there actually was something good in him and how he slowly started to change as time passed,” Ginny said, thoughtful. “Anyway, I’m happy you and Draco are getting along again,” she went on, turning her gaze at Harry.
“Mm-hmm,” Harry mumbled, fiddling with an empty water glass in his hands. “And Goyle. The Wizengamot can’t just sentence them to death, too, right? They’re both barely eighteen.”
“You know, you’re the first person I’ve ever kissed,” Harry said, pulling slightly back and putting his arms loosely around Malfoy’s waist.
“Let me help you,” Hermione said and used the cleaning charm to make the blood on Harry’s clothes and face vanish. “Are you alright? Shouldn’t you go to the Hospital Wing?”
Malfoy stumbled a bit as he took a couple of steps backwards. Then he straightened himself glancing once more at Harry and Ron.
Ron snorted. “If you wanted to set an example of the House unity, why not hang out with some Hufflepuffs or Ravenclaws as we already do? Or even with Pansy Parkinson, anyone would be better than the ferret.”
“We have time. We’re wizards, Harry. We don’t need more than five minutes for packing,” Draco said, starting to kiss along Harry’s jawline and nudging the hem of Harry’s shirt.
Winter's calmness and stillness wrapped Draco tight, and he felt as if he could breathe again after his little episode in the Great Hall. Draco walked slowly around Hogwarts grounds as the glistening snow crunched under his feet and the moon created long, black shadows on the clean white snow. Draco felt his body shivering slightly when he arrived at the shore of the Black Lake, and he was sure there were at least a couple of degrees below the zero.
“And how many real witches and wizards did they manage to kill? They killed basically only each other as all the real witches and wizards could just Disapparate from their bonfires,” Harry said, rolling his eyes. “And why is it dangerous if the pureblood culture gets a bit mixed up with the one of Half-bloods or Muggle-borns? It’s rather dangerous if a culture is closed and hostile towards other cultures. All the living cultures get, and have always got, mixed up with other cultures.”
“Told them I was feeling a bit sick, have been too much out lately, so must’ve caught a cold,” Harry said, shrugging. “What did you tell?”
“It’s just… Draco told me something in Norwegian, something he didn’t want to say in English. Something ‘elsker’ or something.”
After a moment Harry felt Malfoy entwining their pinky fingers tentatively together. Harry inhaled sharply and snapped his eyes open, but he didn’t move his hand away.
“I have always thought I can feel my parents being present when I’m sitting alone by a lake or walking in a forest,” Harry said. “That sounds stupid.”
They ate in silence for a moment. Harry could feel Draco being still all tense next to him, so he leaned a bit closer to him and placed his hand on Draco’s thigh even though he knew Ginny was observing them intently from the corner of her eye. Draco relaxed a bit into Harry’s touch and put his hand on Harry’s, interlacing their fingers together.
