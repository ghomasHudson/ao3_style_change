Draco nodded. “I know. He seems alright even though it’s only been a couple of weeks.” Draco ignored the reality that it only felt like a few days for him as he was in a coma for the beginning of the healing process and continuously in and out of sleep since then. He reached for the paper. “I guess it couldn’t hurt. I’m here indefinitely anyway.”
“That’s not what I mean, Harry.” Draco said calmly, trying to regain the situation. He tried to switch gears. “Look, the moon is a few days away and I need all of the rest I can get. I don’t fancy getting sick again.”
Remus did eventually slip out to give the family some space and Draco was filled in on some of what was going on at home. Not that he’d remember too much of it seeing as he was completely looped for most of the conversation. No, they weren’t in danger for leaving. Voldemort was travelling on some sort of important personal mission he didn’t trust anyone with. Yes, they would have risked it anyway to make sure he was safe. Lucius apologized hundreds of times on deaf ears. Draco wasn’t willing to forgive that yet but he’d let him fuss over him all he wanted. Draco was careful not to feed any important information back to them: just that he was doing well in school and was keeping himself safe despite landing himself in the hospital.
Abbott laughed. “I’m honestly happy to get out of the hospital for a little while, I should be thanking
“It’s going to be okay. I had a vision. I was alive and healthy. It’s just hard waiting when you’re in the thick of it.”
Remus nodded. “Essentially, yes. And if a werewolf marks you, you get to enjoy a longer lifespan and some extra strength. Of course, it doesn’t make you invincible,” he sighed, looking over at James. “And it doesn’t stop a Confundus from working,” he glanced over at Sirius at that. “I know Draco hasn’t really been able to come to know his power or instincts yet, fighting for his life for so long, but I encourage the both of you to dig into some research. He could always come to me about it as well.”
Remus nodded. “I’ll be back in a bit.”
“Therapy isn’t a panacea, but it helps. You can’t cure depression. Or anxiety for that matter. You can manage it, though. It doesn’t make you weak. It makes you human.”
“You’ll notice,” Sirius announced, drawing silence from the group, “that there are five archways, each with their own symbol. The archway with the Hogwarts crest leads you to your rooms. This is the old Prefects wing and you will each have your own sleeping space, I’m sure you’re happy to learn.” There was a flurry of excited chatter at that. Draco wondered if they would give him his old room back. He also wondered if this was to help with his transformations, or if he would go somewhere with Remus for them. “Your names will be on the doors and your trunks have already been delivered to your room. The remaining archways, each with a symbol representing a House, will take you to your House Common Rooms.” Draco remembered this from his time here in Sixth Year. “Only House members will be allowed to use the archway to their respective Common Room and only Eighth Years have access to the archways. The only other way to obtain access to both this dorm and the House dorms is through invitation. Do
Remus nodded. “On it.”
She rolled her eyes in response. “I’m used to you acting like a complete moron over Potter. This is nothing new.”
"Wotcher, Harry," Bill said, shaking Harry's hand.
“He’s not a prisoner,” she replied. “As long as you’re feeling up to company,” she winked at Draco who turned a little red at that. “Call if you need anything,” she said, leaving the room.
When the morning arrived, Healer Markus and Bill were the first to greet him. “I’m assuming you’ve developed a plan, then?” Draco asked when the two walked in. It was weird not having a guardian in the room while all of this happened. Turning into an adult in the midst of a war made Draco feel like he shouldn’t have even gotten this far. He longed for another set of ears to pay attention to the next steps and felt so vulnerable being here alone, even if he knew Remus would come visit when he could. In the meantime, he’d have to play Gryffindor and bear it alone.
“Oh I remember, Antares.” Blaise’s eyes crinkled in humor.
Draco’s face would never return to its pale hue, he was convinced.
Sirius shrugged. “One way to find out. Let’s go.”
“Surely not,” the figure responded, “but I do need to ask you a few questions, if Healer Jacobs allows.”
He was wearing grey joggers and a dark green tshirt, wild dark hair falling messily into his eyes. His scars were prominently on display and he seemed at peace with it. “Looking very Slytherin,” Ginny commented.
“I don’t trust him completely if that’s what you’re asking. I do know he’s probably our best shot at getting out of this alive. He knows the most about how to defeat a horcrux.”
Apologies!
“How’s my mum?” Draco was single-mindedly focused on the idea that Harry had been at his home, potentially in the dungeons, and had seen his parents while everyone else was content to fuss over his nutrition. He needed answers.
“She looks different,” Harry remarked. “Happy.”
James nodded fervently. “You can’t let Him get him. He needs to be alive and happy.”
“He’ll deal with the consequences of his actions—he did what he believed he had to do.”
And he did. For the entirety of his sixteenth birthday, Harry did not leave his room. Instead, he kept himself under the covers, afraid to even see his limbs, which were now elongated to a point where he couldn’t even recognize his own fingers. He didn’t want to face his friends, embarrassed that he didn’t even know himself anymore. Mostly he was devastated that he could have had a closer relationship with Sirius when he was alive; afraid to sully the sole image of James in his head as a father figure, he found himself shying away from more parental moments with Sirius, opting for something more akin to friendship instead. In a way, he was happy that Remus was suddenly stepping into a more paternal role, not wanting to miss out again. For now, though, Harry mourned and he mourned alone.
Ron was doing his best to distract him, able to pick up the gloom radiating off of him. Ron was a good friend. Harry felt badly for blowing up at him all summer—his version of mourning truly was explosive.
Draco looked up from his tea at the rare bit of praise he’s heard Kingsley dole out. “It’s really just the stairs that get me tired,” Draco replied. “I’m feeling much better already, though. Thanks for walking with me.”
“Fair enough.” Blaise then got serious. “Are you ready to see him after everything?”
“Do you miss being an Auror?” Draco asked.
“Where’s mother?” Draco couldn’t help himself from asking.
“Harry?”
Draco sighed and rolled his eyes to the ceiling. “Didn’t need that image, thanks.”
look much better. Bill’s theory really seemed to have done the trick. He now had no trouble eating and did not require as much rest as he previously had, but his appearance seemed a little off now that he had two monsters prominently inside of him. It was enough to make Draco want to claw at himself from the inside out. “I just look so strange anymore.”
“Draco? Are you there?”
Students were beginning to put the pieces together as to who he was. He stuck by Hermione and Ron throughout the day, which was most likely the first tip off. Instead of confirming or denying their accusations, he just felt himself sinking further into the depths as he remained silent.
Harry shrugged. “I’m still wearing my dad’s pajamas. Guess he liked green?” He sat down next to her. “What are you doing up this late anyway, Gin?”
With the conversation moved away from Draco’s werewolf pack, the blonde felt more at ease. The rest of the visit was focused on Samhain and Harry’s newfound chanelling abilities.
“She won’t mind,” he replied, taking a bite. “Delicious. She’s a fantastic baker.”
“Hopefully in the next few days. I’m itching to get out of here—I can’t imagine how you’re feeling.”
Bill grinned. “Don’t we all know it. See you later, then.”
“Many students manage to sneak beverages into the castle, Minerva. Mostly schoolboy antics, wouldn’t you think? I recall his fathers doing the same.”
Draco was finally going home.
Harry just tightly nodded, not wanting to blow his cover.
“Pretty much. They did say that I’m a perfectly healthy 21 year old,” he said with a grin.
“It was dumb.”
“First time for everything, yeah?” Harry smiled at him. “Come on, I’ll help you.”
Night soon fell and Draco was sleeping while his parents watched over him. Remus ducked his head in to check on him. “Was he in terrible pain?” he asked.
Harry sighed. “Fine throughout the day, mostly. The anxiety potion has really helped. And Draco.”
“Thanks, Jack.”
“I dunno,” Draco commented wryly, “Sirius seems to have some Slytherin moxie in there somewhere with how covert he’s been about Harry’s return to the wild.”
“It’s alright,” Remus said. “You didn’t. You grabbed hold of your higher senses enough to stop it.” Draco set the mug down and put his head in his hands. “It was just Samhain—it’s going to be okay.”
Draco frowned, remembering his own public breakdown in the werewolf village just a few short months ago. “We can’t hide forever, Potter,” he said. “Let’s just get in and out, yeah?”
Sirius sighed. “Jamie, you’re such a child sometimes, honestly.” But he was smiling at him.
Regulus sat them down at a bench, bringing Harry back to the first time he found himself in the Garden. It was so peaceful here and still was. Harry just wanted peace.
Harry squeezed back and didn’t say anything, just letting the moment be what it is.
“I’m not afraid of Theo,” Draco responded, not noticing Harry was encroaching. “He still sleeps with a teddy.”
Harry was nonplussed. “He seemed surprised. Even Ron knew it was a courting gift.”
Sirius walked over and gave him a once over, frowning. “No, no I guess you aren’t, are you? You’re not shiny around the edges like him.” Draco noticed that Sirius wasn’t exactly shiny around the edges either but didn’t question it. “Who are you, then?”
“They’re putting you under?” Lucius interrupted. Draco had almost forgotten he was there, he was so quiet. Draco turned to look at his father and Lucius flinched as he got full view of his eyes.
"For now," Draco replied. "I have a feeling it will be back."
The blonde cleared his throat, begging Merlin for some nerve. “I require asylum, Professor,” he managed.
“That’s just your wolf ears, I think,” Ginny replied. She walked into the room without permission, leaning over Draco. “What are you doing?”
He must have voiced the concern because Regulus shuddered. “I wouldn’t know if my body is being used in that manner. I never looked but I doubt it. He didn’t even know I went there. It’s fuzzy, really. I was dragged down and then kind of just ended up here and I haven’t looked back since. Kreacher was at Grimmauld so I couldn’t call for him here. I just hoped that he had solved the locket.” He shook himself out of the memory after a moment, looking to Harry with a smile. “I guess my nephew cracking it works just as well.”
“Why do I have a feeling you’re about to ruin that?” Seamus piped up from the corner of the room.
Draco froze. “What do you mean?”
Draco blinked in shock. He could smell the anxiety rolling off of Weasley—it was obviously difficult for him to say that. Draco nodded. “I’m glad she gave me the opportunity to do so.” He took a deep breath. “I’m trying to be better.”
Draco handed him his glasses and some water. “I know what you mean. Do you want me to go into the city with you? Maybe we can grab lunch after your appointment.”
James pulled him into a hug and Harry melted into the warmth. He’d never get over his Dad existing with him again. It was so surreal and he would never take for granted his time with him. “Didn’t you say you were staying with Draco last night?” he asked. Harry blushed furiously at that to which the stag Animagus laughed. “I wasn’t insinuating! I just know he grounds you. I’m surprised you still had a nightmare is all.”
” Nott commented.
Harry lost his ability to speak again and looked at Sirius helplessly. “We might have been a bit naughty, Jamie.”
His magic worked like tendrils nowadays. After working on his natural healing magic day in and day out while trapped within the confines of Black Manor, Draco had honed his skillset to something more refined. He could feel out spell damage fairly quickly with physical contact and his instincts have gotten stronger in terms of knowing what was needed to be done next. If he concentrated enough, he swore he could almost see others’ magic working, weaving its way around their injuries as they worked overtime to heal.
“You created a barrier between yourself, Mr. Zabini, and everyone else. Nobody could intervene if we tried. Under control is not how I would describe the situation.”
Draco snorted. “Get used to it. You are officially a Pureblood – an Heir even.”
Dumbledore looked down in shame. “I am sorry, Harry. I have taken things too far with you in the hopes of helping wizardkind. My scope was too large, I fear.”
“I doubt your parents and tutors ever thought you would need to. We have a lot of informal disownments in my family. Most of it has to do with being unable to muster the emotional force to disown. We are vastly loyal.”
Remus, however, was back to bothering him daily. He was secretly glad for it: Harry was set for release soon and he needed someone to spend time with.
“Have you always felt this way?”
“What happened? Are you okay?” she asked.
Harry smiled back at him. “Are you ready for Samhain, Harry?” Blaise asked.
“Who’s that then?”
Draco hummed in agreement. He felt bad for leaving Hermione out of it but she’d also declare immediate Healer intervention and didn’t want to risk Harry running off into the forest or something equally as dramatic. As much as Harry worried about the Black family madness Draco didn’t want to confirm his fears even though those manic traits were definitely shining through as of late.
Harry frowned. “I’m sorry. I’m surprised they didn’t check here first.”
“Seeing as I was out for five days I don’t see 24 hours being an issue. The Healers haven’t said anything to me about it.”
“Well, not by natural means. You can die other ways, but it’s pretty uncommon if you keep yourself safe.”
Draco’s eyes narrowed. “How would you even know I want to apprentice here?” he asked, already annoyed with the prickly Healer.
Draco didn’t seem to buy it. “Oh really? Nothing to say about my family? About me?”
“Lo, Madam,” he said as he stopped in front of her, huffing a little from the run.
She gave him a sly look. “Perfectly normal, I assure you. Need anything else?”
James just laughed. “I think he’s afraid of accidentally turning you. This definitely won’t help assuage that thought.”
“I died at seventeen. He was just born. I’m sure Sirius was over the moon about it.” Regulus was looking far away again. Draco wondered if he knew something he didn’t or if he was referring to Sirius being happy his brother had died.
Draco chuckled, reaching to rest his hand on Harry’s shoulder to run his thumb over his neck. Harry shivered at the touch. “Do you even know what it entails, Harry?”
Harry looked down at that. “It’s not that I prefer him, Ron. I just don’t really have to be careful with my thoughts around him.”
King’s Cross felt different this year, Draco decided. For one, he and Blaise were grouped up with a bunch of Gryffindors including most of the Weasley clan without hiding it from the rest of the world—that certainly wasn’t the norm just a few short years ago. Second, Remus, Sirius,
Harry was happy to toast to that. He grinned at his two best mates. Ron looked to be turning a shade of purple and Hermione’s eyes began to spill over as everyone in the room echoed, “To Ron Weasley, to Hermione Granger.”
Draco’s eyebrows disappeared into his hairline. “He didn’t.”
“I’m tired,” Harry offered.
Harry to be a complete wreck?
"We're just worried about you, mate!" Ron yelled angrily. "If you would just stop blowing up at every turn..."
“I could but—”
Draco was so wrong.
The misery inside of Harry seemed to be overtaking him. He hated any surface that gave off any sort of reflection—the glossy table they were sat around on the Hogwarts Express was mocking him with Sirius’s face. It was driving him mad.
Harry just wanted to hurt Draco now that he knew he wasn’t going to get his way. “You never cared about me. You never wanted to help me. You just wanted an out from your shitty parents because you got tired of playing Death Eater.” Draco looked as if he were slapped and it set Harry over the edge. The glass shattered into a million pieces and Harry flinched, suddenly realizing what he had said. “Draco, I’m sorry.”
Remus’s eyes narrowed. “What do you mean ‘we had?’ We were all Confunded, obviously.”
Draco looked up at him, breathing heavily. “What color are my eyes?” he whispered.
Remus sighed and ran his hand through his hair. “Fine. I need to talk to you about your father.”
Harry rolled his eyes but was grinning. He’d grown used to Pansy’s sarcasm over the past weeks. “Morning,” he said, reaching for a slice of toast. Another benefit of running was that he was always hungry: it had really been helping him put some weight back on. He pecked Draco on the cheek, who flushed. “How did you sleep, love?”
“Ah. That was personal. It looks like both of you paid for your fathers’ transgressions. Too bad yours is a horrid shit who can’t even look you in the eye now.” Fenrir walked towards him and Draco shrank as far back as he could against his headboard. “I just want to check your wound, relax.”
“Just go with it okay?”
“Dru was worried about you running off this morning,” Remus commented, referring to one of the teen werewolves in the community.
Dumbledore seemed to realize that Draco was still in the room. “Draco, my dear boy, thank you for bringing this to our attention. We will figure out the best course of action from here. You’re free to go.”
Harry rolled his eyes at the nickname. “Can I have a word?” he asked. Pansy leaned forward in interest. “In
“I also heard Sirius is testifying for you. Wonder how you managed to do that after what you did to him a little over two decades ago—that was fun to find out, by the way. My father: bigot
Bill smiled. “It’s quite literally the job description. No magic at all until we clear you, alright?”
“But I need to go to the funerals—I
he willed, but knew that the Slytherin wouldn’t give up so easily.
Blaise tried to touch Draco as he said “Please don’t see it that way. I was scared.”
that you had to be turned into a werewolf in order to leave the up and coming ranks. It’s awful. But you got out and I’m thankful for that—I’m indebted to Remus for taking care of you. I owe him my life for his caring for yours.”
“I can’t just let him go. I’m running out of excuses.”
“Oh he is—you’d hear his death paraded around if he wasn’t, I’m sure of it.”
a noticeable singe mark on his healer’s garb at his left elbow—good thing Harry had shite aim when he was in a panicked state, or else Healer Turner might have found himself without eyebrows.
Harry immediately recoiled. “I don’t want to put anyone in danger.”
“Yeah, fine. I’m just behind with all the excitement going on. See you.”
” He looked up at the prickly Healer in disbelief. “They’re letting us go back?”
Bill snorted. “Anyway, don’t waste away staring down tapestries, that’s the most mind numbing thing I can think of. I’m here because Remus asked me to check out how you’re doing.”
“What’s happened to me?” he groaned. “Is Harry okay?” There was so much blood that night it was hard to believe he was somehow alive.
“Don’t,” Draco responded, “see you at school.” Draco pulled Harry away and down the block swiftly, Aurors following closely.
“If I was trustworthy? If you loved me? What? I am so sick of my emotions being yanked on by you all the time!” Harry must be rubbing off on him, Draco felt ready to pounce.
Harry barked out a laugh. It was funny how he was able to sound so much like Sirius at times. “So scientific.”
Blaise blanched. “I’m sorry, Harry. I’ll back off if you want.”
Harry, noticing Remus, stumbled his way over. “Party’s over?” he slurred, slumping next to Draco.
“Need to keep up appearances.”
? Draco wondered. “It’s just that they miss him quite terribly after what happened and I thought I’d take them here to visit.”
“Absolutely. You just saved the world, kid, let’s make sure you live to enjoy it.”
Harry blinked in quasi-recognition. Draco’s eyes narrowed at the look. “The garden?” he asked.
(See the end of the chapter for
Turner was quiet as he pressed him. “Even who, Harry?” he asked gently.
Harry scrunched his eyes shut at that, trying to keep his emotions in check. Ron was trying, but it was difficult to imagine the redhead react in anything but anger. It was like he was lying to him all this time, even though he couldn’t have possibly known himself. “I’m afraid to show you,” he said, hardly above a whisper.
Remus waved his hand in dismissal, not wanting to bother Draco with worry. “It’s about treatment and school if you’re still peaky after the hols,” he half-lied. “No worries.”
Sirius noted the two werewolves in the door way and cracked a huge grin, larger than Draco has ever seen on his face. He looked more like Harry when he smiled like that and it made Draco’s chest ache at the thought of him all alone at St. Mungo’s. “You’re back!” he exclaimed, pulling away from James’s embrace and bringing Draco into a hug, his second of the day.
“It would seem so, yes.”
Lucius looked down. “I just didn’t want the last place you saw me to be on the opposite side of the battlefield.”
"Draco, you need to hear this out. You can't just give up."
James walked into the room as Draco cried out again—it felt like his insides were at war. “What’s going on—oh shite. Got it—I’ll let Pads know too. Good luck!” he bolted out the door and cast a series of locking and protection spells before taking off to stop Harry from bursting in.
“You alright?” Draco asked as they got closer to the platform.
"Worry about yourself, Potter," Draco spat, easily falling into schoolyard rivalries.
“You are now listed as Potter-Black under the registry, due to the fact that you have two fathers.”
He finally took Severus up on his offer for tea, treading wearily into their strained godfather-godson relationship. When he arrived, Severus enveloped him in a tight hug, which was quite unlike the dour professor. It took Draco by surprise and he had to hold back the tears stinging in the corner of his eyes.
“Are you doing alright, though?” Draco asked carefully. “Trust me, I prefer you don’t damaging your liver beyond repair but being sober makes everything more real I bet.”
Ron and Harry laughed at that: the two brainiacs of their cohort were already raring to go, signaling the true start of term. They finished up breakfast in comfortable silence and headed back to their Common Room to figure out just how the school year would go.
They all shared a laugh at that, but the room was thick with malaise. It was clear that big changes were on the horizon, and their small semblance of childhood seemed to be further in the rearview of their current situation. Unsure of what was to come, all four were happy to stick it out together, and try to plan to the best of their abilities. Only time would determine the outcome.
Ron frowned. “No. Harry’s always been a bit fascinated with you, even before this whole angsty turn of events.”
Narcissa’s lips drew into a tight half smile. “I understand.”
Harry nodded. “I think that makes sense, but I’m not happy about it.”
Draco looked down, knowing Harry was right. He understood why Harry was so frightened about this vision: it frightened himself. “I can’t help my magic when someone I love is hurt,” he said finally after a few minutes of silence. “Maybe it’s you I’m healing in the vision. Maybe it’s Remus. Hell, maybe it’s Ginny or Ron or Hermione. The magic just manifests itself and takes me over. It’s almost like I’m possessed. I don’t have access to the Malfoy journals to see if any of my ancestors have learned how to curtail it.”
Harry sat and groaned. “Not you, too,” he joked. “Honestly, I’m dreading graduation because I have no clue what I want to do.” He smiled at her. “Planning on retiring?”
“You most certainly are but I don’t doubt that if You-Know-Who threatened the village on the grounds of you being handed over that he would do so without much hesitation.”
Sirius nodded dismally, knowing where this was going.
Harry thought, feeling the guilt rise in his chest. “This is fine, thanks.”
Harry laughed at the thought. “Being cordial with two Slytherins would have him committing me to St. Mungo’s.”
Remus squeezed Harry’s shoulder gently and Harry collapsed in his arms, obviously in the throes of emotional overdrive. Draco tried not to be jealous that he had to share Remus’s fatherly affections – he wasn’t used to that. “You had some time, though. You were able to get to know him a little bit.”
“Can I come in?”
Harry tutted. “It’s Black now, actually.”
Remus took it begrudgingly. “Long story, then?”
” It didn’t appear as though he had a choice because suddenly he was sprouting fur everywhere and his mouth had turned into a muzzle. Everything was beginning to feel hazy around him as the magic began to take over.
for choosing me.”
“Is that really fair to Haz, though?”
“I’m glad for your weird things. Partly why we keep you around actually,” Remus said jokingly.
“Well that’s reassuring, professor. Thanks so much,” Draco replied bitingly. Remus stared at him as if he saw a ghost. Fenrir barked out a laugh.
Turner held up a pink-colored potion. “Nutrition-potion. You need to take these at least once per day, twice if you find yourself skipping meals. These will bring your body back up to speed in a few weeks and you won’t need them after around a month or so, depending on how much magic you’re expending in healing that arm.”
"Worry about yourself, Ron!" Harry screamed back, eyes flashing. "I don't need your pity and I don't need any 'mental health checkups', Hermione. I'm fine."
Draco huffed. “Whatever. I guess I’m off. Send mother my love.”
transform,” Remus supplied, “you just didn’t wake up during it. Your core was trying to heal you.”
“Been better, honestly,” Draco replied. He gripped Remus’s hand again as he felt another shock of pain. He let out a small cry.
“Is he alive?” came an Irish accent somewhere to his left. “Should we call McGonagall?”
Draco bit the bottom of his lip, already regretting what he was about to say. “I know a place.”
“Fenrir,” Draco finally said, finding his voice and some Gryffindor courage, “I have to get to Blaise—he’s really hurt.” As he tried to push past him, he felt Greyback’s grip on him and he was suddenly transported back to that fateful moment over a year ago in his family dungeons. Overwhelmed with the terror of his turning, he halted his struggle against his sire, frozen in abject horror.
“Looks like you’ve only been disowned in name.” Draco jumped in surprise and whipped around. It was a Weasley – not one he was familiar with. This one was impossibly too cool to be associated with the rest of his family – he had long hair tucked into a low ponytail and was so tan it was impossible to tell where his freckles were. A single fang earring dangled from his left ear. “I’m Bill,” he offered. Right, Draco realized, the Weasley Heir.
“Slytherins are always so dramatic. They left me behind too, you know. And I have quite a good right hook.”
“Remus!” Fenrir smiled and enveloped him into a tight hug of obvious familiarity. “How are you? You look thin.” Fenrir’s amber eyes raked over the younger werewolf in concern, taking in his worn robes and sullen features.
“We’re the only ones with access to this place currently so no worries there.”
Draco knew it was self-destructive – he knew Harry was drinking to forget. He knew he should have told someone. But he couldn’t help but allow them to keep sneaking out, if just to see Harry come alive for a few hours each miserable day.
He was led into Healer Turner’s office before being allowed to see Harry. He asked the mediwitch to alert him when James was ready for visitors as well before settling in for the bad news about Harry’s mental state.
James let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding. “Brilliant.”
“No that’s fine—I just wanted to—I dunno what I wanted really.”
Draco sighed, a frown gracing his features. “I can wait, then. Thanks for the offer.”
Of course, as luck would have it, pushing himself so hard set him back in the healing process as he almost crippled due to magical exhaustion about 3 days into his resolved determination. Covered in sweat, he attempted a Patronus against the Healer’s wishes. He felt that familiar tearing in his chest and hit the ground.
Draco avoided Harry’s eyes, instead focusing on a wide variety of bezoars in front of him. “I’m fine.”
Regulus smiled. “I told blondie over there I was quite heroic in the end, didn’t I?”
It was James’s turn to grimace. “Not proud of it, mate. We just wanted to keep you safe. We obviously failed in that regard. I think Dumbledore never lifted the spell so you could be protected by Lily’s family.”
Draco frowned. “Why am I still in pain?”
“He’s alive.” Draco sagged with relief. So he lived without his aid. Harry would be smug about that one. “He’s in the hospital under a stasis charm while they make repairs. He got hit with a core severing hex.” Draco flinched, his hand immediately going to his chest. He knew how badly that hurt.
“Impossible. You’re Harry Potter.”
Draco sputtered. "Roommates with him?"
“I’m sorry. Reliving it was just a lot. It felt like his claws were on me again.”
Harry sighed and sat up. “Can we go out?” he asked. Draco started at that, snapping his head up to meet Harry’s eyes. He looked determined – or rather desperate.
Harry rubbed his face in guilt. “Does she think I’m cross with her?” She was the one to blurt it out the last time. Harry rushed out of the room so quickly she probably thought he didn’t want to be around her ever again, which wasn’t far from the truth in all honesty; he didn’t really want to be around anyone anymore.
That wasn’t what Draco was talking about, however he kept it to himself until he could gather more information. No use giving hope if it would only reopen the wounds.
In the months between 4th and 5th Year, Malfoy Manor had been occupied by a very unexpected visitor. Although he didn’t see him very much, Draco felt instantaneously unwelcome and uncomfortable in his home while the Dark Lord occupied it, and there seemed to be no end in sight. His father, whom Draco thought would be gleeful about Voldemort’s return, seemed as though the wind were knocked out of his sails – in fact, Draco found his father to be more frightened and skittish than anything, continually sneaking glances at him in concern whenever he got the chance. His mother, too, seemed worried. All of the glorious stories told to him as a child about the time before Harry Potter defeated Voldemort seemed to have lost their luster as his return became a reality creaking up and down the stairs at night. Draco wanted no part of it.
Harry scratched the back of his head nervously again; it seemed to be a new tic for him. It didn’t seem to fit with his new look, which was impossibly posh by default. Potter genetics are tough to outfight, Draco supposed. “Uh, yeah,” he replied lamely. At Hermione’s quirked eyebrow, he continued: “I had a horcrux inside of me.”
"It's as if you were already penning my eulogy, professor," Draco bit back sarcastically.
Sirius nodded. “It’s unplottable. Safer than Hogwarts probably. And you can see your Dad whenever you want.”
Harry looked up at him, suddenly uncomfortable. “Why would I need to go there? It’s just accidental magic.”
“Harry do you want company?” Hermione offered, a hopeful look in her dark brown eyes.
“It’s a rotting curse. Some Death Eater must have cast it on me during the battle and I missed it. It didn’t show up at first because it was dormant but now it’s full-blown. Bill is working on the counter but it’s taking some time. I have no clue who could have done it.”
The full moon, it turns out, didn’t affect Harry at all. In fact, he wasn’t presenting any werewolf-like tendencies. On the contrary, it seemed that he was doomed to be porcelain white due to the increase in vampirism into his system. They had advised him of wearing sunblock when going outside and it almost made him burst out laughing: what a lame vampire, he couldn’t help but think. His canines were slightly pointier but he wasn’t craving anyone’s blood, thankfully. Harry didn’t seem to care about more appearance changes, though. He was just glad to be alive.
“He’ll be here soon, darling,” his mother responded, “he’s on a Floo call with Auror Robards.”
“Sirius is the best for panic attacks,” James said when Harry finished his story. “I’d have them so regularly everyone was on a constant swing shift with me.”
Fenrir’s humor died as he looked on in concern. “You weren’t going to survive the next moon—I could feel
Entering Diagon Alley for the first time since his change was terrifying for Harry. Unlike Muggle London, where being recognized was nearly impossible, walking around like a mini Sirius Black was sure to arise looks, especially if he was walking with Ron and Hermione. Harry kept his head down most of the time, eager to be safely back in Grimmauld.
“He probably won’t go to Azkaban—going turncoat
rest. You can do whatever you want, now. It’s over.”
Oh man it's been awhile, hasn't it? Enjoy the update and leave me a comment if you liked it!
“Fenrir told me he was alive.” Draco’s heart couldn’t keep up with the peaks and valleys it was experiencing as he braced for more bad news. Harry had to be alive.
“It was meant to be a joke, don’t tell me I’ve lost it.”
blood, he realized with dread. And it was coming from Myrtle’s bathroom. He couldn’t get a scent of who or what it was, the taste of copper was beginning to overtake his senses.
“I’m really struggling with gaging how old everyone is here.”
The next morning Draco was feeling even worse if it were possible. He curled himself into a ball early on and hadn't moved all morning. Nobody bothered him until about midday, probably thinking he was just trying to sleep in before school resumed. He felt a hand on his forehead and blearily opened his eyes to see Remus unsurprisingly, looking very concerned. "He's been like this all morning," he heard from somewhere in the room- it was Potter. Of course. He closed his eyes again, too weak to protest.
Hermione frowned. “Seven? Only two destroyed? Horcruxes can be anything—if he was smart he’d make horcruxes out of nondescript things. This might be a fool’s errand, Harry.”
“My father would be so happy to hear you say that,” Draco joked and Hermione blushed at the notion. “Honestly, that’s been the argument for decades but of course zealots latch onto it and go full pureblood supremacy with it so the Ministry had kept everything sanitized over the years. All of the old rites are extracurricular reading for those who want to learn more. Some apprenticeships exist but they’re pretty taboo with how suffocating the Ministry has been about it. That’s why I’m surprised to hear you want to have an altar this year, Ron. I didn’t think your family would continue the tradition.”
you. I don’t love you anymore.” Draco honestly didn’t know how true that was but he wasn’t willing to start over with him right now.
“Sirius?”
Regulus frowned. “That’s always a possibility here isn’t it.” It was a statement rather than a question. He looked as though he wanted to say something. Draco wished he would. It seemed as though he was keeping something.
Draco sighed heavily. “He said I was dying.”
Harry jumped off as though he were stung. “Shit, Draco. You’re still healing.” He helped him settle back down into the pillows. He then let out a sheepish grin as he said, “sorry. I’ve just been waiting for that for a long time.”
“It’s not about his gift is it?”
Harry settled down next to him in the overstuffed armchair that everyone tended to fight over. “Do you need anything? Tea for your sweets?” he asked, eyeing the basket.
Blaise stiffened at that. “I just—I didn’t know if—I couldn’t be sure—“
Harry frowned. “I spent all of that time with the Dursleys for nothing.” All of that abuse for nothing, Harry thought bitterly. So much for family magic.
Remus entered the room fully clothed, handing Draco some pajamas to wear. They looked like Harry’s. “Thanks,” he said, voice hoarse. “I’m not sure if I can move yet, honestly.”
Harry sighed. "Sure. Are you hungry?" Draco's stomach growled in response. I'll take that as a yes. I'll go get you something."
Remus laughed at that. “Yeah, that is frustrating. But that did remind me…” Remus pulled out a hand mirror from his pocket. This one didn’t look like Sirius’s, which was pretty ornate and a mercurial silver color. This one held the same ornate pattern but was black. “James made this for you.”
“You could always sit at the Gryffindor table.”
Draco’s mercury eyes narrowed. “Why?”
Draco shrugged. “Does it work for you?”
“So now a blow to my ego too? Thanks, professor.”
want you to stay here for safety, though. You were right about that.”
“No, don’t go,” Draco said, wincing as he tried to sit up to no avail. “I need my wolf dad here.”
“Yeah, Remus told me,” he said, frowning.
Remus sighed wearily. “He’s being rather destructive.”
Harry nodded. “You’re doing a good job, I think. Remus too.”
Also sorry this update is short - I just wanted to get something out to you and it seemed like a good place to break it up.
Ron pulled her into a hug and kissed the top of her head. “I’m sure—go enjoy the feast.”
“You’re not here to haul me off to the Department of Mysteries, are you?”
Draco nodded, processing the information. “So,
is an interesting development, Draco thought.
“I have nothing better to do, seeing as I was kicked out of my room. Guess Sirius and I will use the spare tonight. Let’s go.”
Draco found his excitement at the prospect of immortality to be very short lived after his first full moon.
He began to feel as though he were apart of their circle as each day wore on, with the younger kids asking for his advice on Quidditch teams, the elder teens appreciating his sarcastic wit, and the adults offering genuine care as he healed and worried about what was happening outside. He could see himself living in the colony for the rest of his days if he didn’t feel as though it were a great cowardly cop-out of facing reality. Nevertheless, if Remus never showed, he had to admit that he wouldn’t feel angry—he might actually feel relief in the Schrödinger situation of everyone being alive and simultaneously dead in this little world of his.
Draco just nodded numbly. “Everything has been one big mess lately, hasn’t it?”
Harry laughed. “Oh yeah. Sorry.” He stood and stretched. “I’m going to get ready. Thank you for helping me.”
Harry shrugged. “I’ve been here for a few days and he’s grown on me. Prickly but knows what he’s doing.”
, but it’s not sustainable.”
“Speaking of Chosen Ones, ours locked himself in the bathroom and won’t get out,” Draco blurted, not one for subtlety this early in the morning. The older werewolf shot up at that, instantly alert. “Care to help me pry open the door?”
He was led to a doorway at the end of an unused hall. Surprisingly, Kingsley was at the front of the door in his Auror garb. “I don’t remember requesting detail?” Sirius said, tilting his head in confusion like a lost dog.
“You seemed to need the sleep more. You looked a bit dead on your feet when you came in and you didn’t budge even when Fred and George set off a Christmas cracker.” She disappeared into the kitchen and came back with a tray filled with chicken, vegetables, roasted potatoes, and a large glass of water. “Mum saved you this.” She placed the tray in Draco’s lap who took one sniff and his stomach growled, giving away his hunger.
“Anyway. I’m not sure how he found it in him to forgive me before he died. I’m not sure if he ever did. I wouldn’t blame him. I fell on family association rather than who he was.”
Instead of leaving, Harry stepped fully into the room, observing the situation. "If you're ailing with a fever all night it becomes my problem to worry about," he quipped, stepping closer. Draco really wanted him to leave.
Ron and Hermione were also in good spirits: mainly to have Harry safe and alive, but also because he was going to have the opportunity to have a living parent. Even with a war looming, everyone seemed happy for it to be Christmastime.
Draco laughed and then winced.
“You’re not his father, you have no right to his records.”
Draco sighed. “Not really, no. I’ve had a dull headache since it happened and some eye strain, but I feel fine.”
“How curious.”
“We’ll figure this out, okay? Why don’t you get something to eat – you’ve had a fright.”
The odd pairing would walk to a small café a block or two away from Grimmauld each day and eat a light breakfast. Draco would dip his chocolate croissant into his tea and listen to Kingsley attempt to make small talk with a known Death Eater’s son. Kingsley was good with people, Draco realized. He rarely mentioned the war or his parents: Kingsley would just ask his opinion on teenager things like Quidditch teams and what subjects he was interested in. He wondered if he acquired that skill when he became Head Auror and had to deal with bureaucracy at every turn.
“A bit cowardly though, don’t you think?” Harry replied.
“That’s what Remus said, yes.”
“Almost everyone did. Someone sounded an alarm—it was crazy.”
“No, sir. I’m going on my own. To be frank, I am terrified.”
The procedure went as perfectly as one could hope. Draco’s eye had lost most of the black, with only his iris remaining changed. It made him look a little odd, one eye a bright silver and the other black as the sea, but he would gladly go blind if it meant Blaise could live. Luckily, that wasn’t the case.
“And that attitude is why it will make it a difficult sell to allow you to apprentice here one day.” It was Healer Markus from the doorway.
It was Harry’s turn to frown. The headmaster seemed genuine in his remorse. “I’m not so much a child that I don’t know war requires sacrifices,” he chanced. Dumbledore looked up at him. “I just wish you would have given me some autonomy. I know the Confundus wasn’t your plan. I know you thought you were protecting me by not telling me about the horcrux. It’s just—I’m getting older, sir. I’m going to have to face Him soon. It would be better if I knew these things when I’m going into the fight, rather than finding them out in the eleventh hour.” Dumbledore’s eyes were shining as he looked at Harry. Harry didn’t know if it was in pride or remorse, or perhaps a combination of the two.
“What are you on about?”
Sirius’s eyes narrowed. “Why? What’s in her vault?”
“Oh no.” And then he finally saw his mother walk in. “Mum!”
Draco snorted. “You’ve no idea.”
Remus nodded. “I didn’t think I’d be able to.”
And just like the day in the bathroom, it was chaos all over again.
Draco jumped. “Yes? That is my name, Weasley, and you are in my room.”
Sirius sighed but nodded in affirmation, not willing to spend more energy on his malaise. Sirius lifted his head and looked James up and down, frowning. “You’re covered in blood.”
“I’m sure she had good reason to keep it from you,” Harry replied. “This channeling business is terrifying, honestly. Maybe she didn’t want to open you up to it.”
Draco was not a fighter unless it was for his own gain. Grown in the comfortable habitus of bourgeois life, Draco never fancied himself a follower. Even at Hogwarts, fellow classmates tended toward following him around, willing to fall in line behind him as he orchestrated childhood pranks and taunt against his favorite green-eyed target. The thought of giving up his independence and leadership qualities, like his father seemed to be crumbling towards, was not appealing to the Malfoy Heir.
“It’s weird he’s here isn’t it?”
“Whatever.” Theo grabbed his book and disappeared down the hall to his room without another word.
Hemione had a firm grip on his hand. Ginny was leaning on Blaise—a new development post-war. It was nice they found each other, Draco mused. He supposed they did spend quite a bit of time cooped up together before last year, and Ginny was more Slytherin than Gryffindor when it came down to it. He was happy Blaise was happy, and even gladder still that he was alive.
Regardless, Harry in withdrawl seemed to be better accidental magic-wise rather than inebriated Harry. The bouts of anger and Matilda-esque meltdowns seemed to slow now that his supplier was out. He was attending class again and was working on getting his grades up. Ron and Draco were, overall, pleased with the turn around. Of course, that was until the worst day ever for Harry thus far.
Remus laughed. “After the past few years, I don’t think anything surprises me anymore.”
Sirius wrapped an arm around Harry, who leaned into his father’s embrace. “It doesn’t have to be you, babe.”
“Ah, yes. Though you must know it’s for protection of both the humans and the pack. Wouldn’t want to accidentally make someone a snack.”
You'll notice there is a change from the oneshot in regards to when Harry receives some information.
Draco looked up in alarm. “I didn’t mean you weren’t. You’ve been—well, wonderful actually. I feel bad for being such a brat Third Year.”
Bill grimaced. "I don't think so. You're pretty sick. I'm afraid it won't take with the wolf so strong. After you transform we'll do it. Make sure you get lots of rest before hand. I'd put you on bed rest now, honestly."
Harry laughed. “For what? Saving my life? We’ve been over this, Draco.” He reached over and squeezed the werewolf’s hand.
Draco’s eyes narrowed. He was nervous to leave Harry like this; he was obviously distressed about something. “Okay, I’m going down to breakfast.” He promptly ran to find Remus.
” the two warned simultaneously, causing all of the teenagers to jump and look up. Remus cleared his throat. “We are going to Diagon Alley today,
Ginny laughed again. “Sure, ferret.”
Harry smiled at Draco, pulling him into a kiss. “It looks great, Draco. Thanks for doing this for Ron.”
Draco had whipped his head back to Blaise during the commotion, suddenly alert. “What are you talking about?”
“Remus said your inheritance was unexpected. We just want to make sure you’re alright,” Hermione pressed. Harry felt thankful for the older werewolf not giving specifics. “Whatever it is, holing yourself up in your room all day isn’t doing you any good.” He knew she was right but he was so afraid to show them what had happened. He felt guilty for that – why was he okay with Malfoy knowing his secrets but not his best friends?
“Maybe I should do the talking. Have you met him yet?”
Harry frowned.
Draco startled awake at the sound of Harry’s voice calling from his mirror. He had drifted off early in the evening after a full day of testing and visits.
“It’s going to take some time, but it will get better.”
“What will you say to him?”
“Treatment for magical exhaustion?” James suggested.
Draco was silent for a long moment. Harry was suddenly worried that he had scared Draco off. But then he said, “I know we just said we’d cool it until we healed but could you kiss me again?”
Harry looked as though he were slapped. “I thought you wanted this!” he said. “I see you watching me over there every night!”
“Dumbledore is on my list right now,” Sirius said curtly. “Don’t worry about what he said. For now, let’s just worry about Christmas, yeah?”
“You’ve said that before and look where we are.” Harry flinched at that.
“He helped me in the Final Battle. He also refused to identify me at your house, nor did Nott. I’ll have to state that about Nott as well, I suppose.”
“It’s going to get better, Draco. The cane won’t be forever and you’ve been getting on well with everyone. You’ve made so much progress.” Remus said. Draco was wiping his face with the sleeve of his sweater: a gift from Molly. It was a deep shade of blue with a white ‘D’ on the front and had almost made Draco burst into tears when he opened it.
Harry nodded solemnly. “Snatchers.”
Lucius sent him a glare. “Only temporarily when the potion ran out,” Narcissa responded. “As long as he doesn’t move around he doesn’t seem to be disturbing his core too much.”
Harry frowned. “You don’t seem fine.”
“Where’d you even get those? Mum’ll go spare if she finds out.”
Draco smiled at that. “Just in time for Christmas ham.”
Draco felt chastised and had to hold himself back from letting out a low whine in response, tilting his head to the side to expose his neck to Remus in apology. Remus blinked at the very wolf-like response but didn’t bring attention to it.
Harry was just poking around at his plate, not really touching anything. He sighed. “I know. It’s hard after bad nights. I get queasy.” He picked up a piece of toast and started working at it.
“A bit yeah,” Remus sat up. “You really shouldn’t be overexerting yourself after a full moon—not with your track record.”
Draco nodded. “All of the Ancient and Noble Houses have Manors. I think this one is in Scotland somewhere. Never quite learned the coordinates.”
Draco couldn’t keep the snark at bay any longer. “Is that a sleight in your eyes, then? Seeing as self-preservation is a Malfoy’s singular goal in life?”
James looked back and forth between the two doppelgangers. Suddenly, it made sense. “Us?”
“I know so. I think you’ve started a new Hogwarts tradition. Congrats.”
“I can always go back to school and find a way into the chamber.”
“You need to be in father mode, Sirius,” Remus began once they had settled on the back patio, away from prying eyes.
“Sort of. He’s a bit older than me. He was already a teenager when I showed up, making him more quasi uncle to be honest.”
Can you believe we're finally getting to the point that the oneshot was set at? Only took over a year ;). Obviously, this fic has turned into it's own realm so treat the oneshot as an AU to the AU as the plot has shifted and turned along the way.
She frowned, looking ahead and not meeting Draco’s eyes. “Well you and Blaise aren’t in Paris, are you? I wanted to come home.”
He found Draco preparing dinner with Jack in his living quarters, humming along to David Bowie on the radio.
“Your father disowned you informally. Your mother did not.” Remus, sensing why Draco was so touchy about the guardianship subject, squeezed his hand gently. “You’re not going back there. I promise.”
“Thanks, Hermione,” Harry said, shoulders slumping in relief. Of course the witch wouldn’t be considering Draco’s concerns. How silly of him to think so.
“Draco found me,” Harry said, puling Sirius from his thoughts.
He could hardly wait.
As he watched the two settle into a corner of his room and unpack Harry’s feelings, Draco just knew he had to be released in time to get Harry to the garden for the winter holiday. They were only two weeks away. He was more determined to get himself walking and casting at normal levels again.
“How are you sleeping?”
“You’re not. Mrs. Weasley even knit you a sweater.”
TW/CW: suicide attempt mention/depiction--nothing too visual but still important to note in case you're feeling uncomfy about it!
“Go to bed, Harrison.”
Harry flinched at the term as Draco delivered a warning glare to Blaise. “Fear of death doesn’t mean you should roll over to evil.”
“He looks so small,” Lucius said brokenly. It was obvious that seeing his son in such a state was destroying the man’s resolve.
People were beginning to look over at them to see the commotion. Draco didn’t even care. “I know you more than you want me to. This isn’t healthy.”
“How mature.” He glanced down at Harry’s plate, noticing that it was just as full as when they arrived. “You know you need to eat, right?”
“Of course,” Draco breathed, “not wanting to speak it to the living?”
“Maybe I’ll talk to him. I dunno why I’m so bent out of shape from this. I thought I moved on.”
The Healer noticed the basket in Draco’s lap and her eyebrows disappeared into her hairline. “Did you walk by yourself?”
“Is that why you didn’t get me a Mind Healer? Draco said he told you about all of my drunken nights.”
Harry turned around and smiled. “Morning, Ron.”
“Yes, well, I’ve been able to talk with him as of late.”
Harry found the strength to stand at that. “Fine, Ron. I’ll leave you alone. Thanks for being a great friend,” he spat venomously.
“Dad dropped off some things so I’m all set, thanks.”
Draco had scooted back against the headboard, curling around his mug. His head was low, trying to hide the puffiness of his eyes. “You know you can experience emotion in front of me, right? I won’t destroy your reputation by telling.”
Draco was honestly happy to see Blaise. One of the only neutral Slytherins these days, he always felt as though he could trust him. He actually frequented this club with Blaise on multiple occasions the previous summer, but they fizzled out when the school year began and Draco had begun to become more pressured by his family.
“He’s so odd,” Draco commented as he watched James dash away, spring in his step. “How is anyone that chipper in the morning?”
Harry sighed. “Nobody is sure. Remus thinks I had an adoption spell on me that changed my appearance. My full powers probably broke it down.”
Sirius was having none of it. “And? I’m sure he can administer potions and get Harry set up. Can you set his arm here?”
“Why do you suddenly care?” he snapped. “I don’t recall you being around much last year.”
“The holidays can be rough without family,” Harry remarked.
Harry laughed in response. “Your parents saved my life on at least three occasions. Despite Lucius’s long list of faults I do think he’s changed or at least changing.” He placed a soft kiss to Draco’s temple. “Plus, they made you. Can’t be all bad.
Harry sat back and considered his position. Dumbledore was reaching out to him for help? Why would he need a sixteen year old to figure things out for him? “If he made me a horcrux on accident, he has to have more than three. The books I’ve read talked about instability after the soul was split 3 times. Something to do with the numerology of it all.”
Draco perked up as he realized “It was destroyed, wasn’t it? That’s one down.”
and all.”
“Sorry,” he managed to say, “I thought since you’ve passed you could just appear.”
Harry huffed out a laugh. “What?”
Harry side-eyed him, taking a long drag. As he exhaled, his eyes slowly closed, as though willing Ron away. “I’m fine,” he replied curtly, looking over London rather than making eye contact with his best friend of five years.
At almost 40 years old, Marlene had some indications that her early youth was behind her but was still as beautiful as she was at 18. He couldn’t
“You lived with You-Know-Who for a whole year.”
The full moon left Draco retching and shivering once more. His body was so tired that he was beginning to believe that Harry leaving him behind was the right call—he was constantly on edge and the stress on his body did not help the situation. He heard groaning in the direction of the living room and dragged himself out of bed to help Remus.
“Silence,” Voldemort hissed once more. “Even so, Lucius. You have failed. You have forced us to spill pure blood, and you have embarrassed everyone. You are nothing.”
That night was awful.
Draco thought about it. “It’s not really a prophecy, though. You’re just seeing a potential timeline.”
“Don’t apologize for you pain, Hare,” he replied. “You’re the strongest person I know.”
“So I won’t age. I won’t die either?” Draco asked.
“I don’t understand why Death has a sudden obsession with me lately,” Draco mused, “guess I dodged her again, though.
Draco looked back into Voldemort’s red eyes, carefully guarding his thoughts to protect Severus. “I’m not sure,” he whispered, scared that if he spoke too loudly, he’d be joining his father on the floor.
They waited for about a minute until a figure emerged from the shadows. He looked much younger and healthier than when Harry last saw him. He looked closer to Harry than how he did after Azkaban, lines seemingly gone from his face and his skin a pale but healthy hue. When he saw the two of them, Sirius looked confused. “Reg?” He turned around and looked back comically. “How’d you do that? I was just with you over there.” He looked at Draco. “Draco Malfoy?” he said.
"No," Remus replied. "For dumping the emotional baggage you've been holding in for a month on him. Besides, the two of you are roommates and I don't need you fighting all day long."
Thanks for reading and I'll see you next time.
“He’s downstairs on a fire call with Fenrir—do you want to go see him?”
Sirius held Harry again. “I don’t know, babe. Maybe it’s the filial connection or the fact that he was the one to hoist you up and run into the house. You don’t have to feel guilty for getting your Dad back because most of the dead remain that way, though.”
him and I feel so awful about it.”
Draco felt so lost. He wasn’t sure how he could get past this new development. He felt wild and out of place. He longed for the werewolf village. “I think I should see Healer Turner.”
“How are you even here?” Sirius asked, voice hoarse. “You shouldn’t be in here.” He sat next to James, shoulder to shoulder, and leaned his head back onto the seat of the armchair.
Harry hadn’t spoken since the incident, having witnessed the murder after going on a horcrux venture with Dumbledore. He returned drenched, bruised, and bloody with a faux horcrux and a note from R.A.B.: someone had gotten to the task before they did and the whole affair seemed to be all for naught. Harry didn’t say a word, handing the locket and note to Hermione and turning back to his dorm, shutting himself away. The next morning, he didn’t show up for breakfast. When Draco managed to break into the Gryffindor dorms later that day, Harry didn’t speak: he just sat there with his head in his hands, barely responsive. It was alarming and frightening to Draco, Ron, and Hermione: it was though Harry had gone mute. Sirius, recently cleared in name, showed up to the school as soon as he could, Remus in tow, whisking Harry back home. Draco felt relieved and saddened: relieved that Harry finally had a parental figure who actually cared for him, saddened that he could do nothing to comfort him.
? And Theodore, 1
“He’s not even a real Professor,” Nott grumbled. Draco glared at him.
Harry waved him off. “It doesn’t matter.” He got suddenly serious as he said, “I’ve been having visions again. I know where the last horcruxes are.”
Draco hadn’t had much contact with Harry as of late. The Black Heir was generally off somewhere alone, aside from the odd Quidditch practice, having successfully gotten off probation a few weeks prior. He had tried to make amends with him after Harry’s last meltdown but Harry seemed to not want anything to do with anyone, spending most of his free time outside by the lake smoking, battered Odyssey in his hand. At least he wasn’t drinking anymore, even if Harry was cross with everyone.
change sides.”
“I didn’t know you were Seeing. Have you told anyone?”
Lucius’s trial went as Draco assumed—no jail, but a short-term house arrest and probationary period. His mother only took the stand to testify. The two would stay in the Malfoy residence in London while the Ministry tore apart their ancestral home board by board until all the dark magic was excavated from its depths. They would be lucky if the manor was standing by the end of it.
Draco wasn’t having it. “How am I supposed to believe you’re keeping yourself safe? How am I supposed to believe that you left me here because of safety and not because you’re tired of me?”
“Draco?” He knew that voice. “Are you awake?”
Remus bowed his head in thanks, eyes a little darker. “Yes he was. I wish I could’ve been home to mourn but there is little time for that these days.” He then turned to Draco. “I heard what happened to you. I’m so sorry about it. We’re going to get it sorted out, I promise,” he smiled reassuringly at Draco.
Harry rolled his eyes. It was almost out of place without a lit cigarette between his fingers: Draco was glad he shook the habit, even if he was scratching his hands to bits. He wondered if he should tell Remus about the new habit. “Anyway, they said I seem to be doing better but they also said I tend to swing high and low and I’m in a high swing.”
Remus laughed, too. “Yes you did.”
“Well, we’re all here for you if you need us. You know that, right?” Draco couldn’t help to feel the deep guilt surrounding him throwing Harry out when he was clearly out of control. He didn’t want to do that again; not ever.
Jack, more confused, replied “they’re silver. Like mercury. Is everything okay?”
Draco took a deep breath and said, “Mum, I think I like him. I’m afraid if I tell him that and it gets out that you two will be used as some bargaining chip later on. I feel like it’s unavoidable with the paper telling the world that I used natural healing magic on him. I think he’ll catch on on his own.”
“Uh,” was the immediate reply. He heard a but of shuffling and then a “I guess.”
As it turned out, Draco was correct with that assumption.
Harry grimaced. “I don’t think he had time to fill me in, what with the panic attack and Christmas festivities. It’s been a very long day. So everyone tricked me? That’s not great.” But Harry wasn’t angry, he was surprised to realize. He had finally reached acceptance about his true heritage: he was more confused about the reasoning than anything.
Draco refrained from tutting sarcastically while he busied himself with putting his clothing into an empty wardrobe. “Sorry for dumping all of that on you before. It wasn't fair,” he managed to say. His back was to Harry but he could feel the golden boy's eyes on him. "What?"
Remus snorted. “Trust me, it was more karma for my school days than anything. I’ve been much worse.”
He stood over his best mate, willing him to open his eyes. Draco shot a glance at the door—nobody was around. “Well,” he said, “if they won’t tell me how it’s going, I’m just going to have to find out myself, now aren’t I?” He placed a hand over Blaise’s chest and closed his eyes, trying to feel out the damage.
The two were seated on opposite sides of Ron’s four-poster, Ron leaning back with his head resting on the headboard. He looked better, with color returned to his features. Harry was laying across the bottom of the bed on his back, his legs dangling over the sides. He still looked so small despite the summer of recovery: it would be an uphill battle.
“She’s alright,” Draco commented.
Draco looked down. “I’m sorry. I wanted to tell you. I thought Regulus knew best, seeing as he pretty much lives here.”
“I know it’s not. But I want you to trust yourself: you really did something amazing last night. Not just keeping yourself in check—you helped so many people find closure. Don’t let a rogue transformation soil it or your relationship.”
He sat himself at the end of the Slytherin table, closest to the professors. He looked at the table, willing himself to see Remus there, wishing he didn’t resign back in Third Year. He needed him for this first school transformation, yet he knew he wouldn’t be there. Instead, he saw Horace Slughorn, his father’s Potions Master.
“Yeah, I think the Garden upped the vampire gene in the healing process. No blood cravings yet though so I’m not complaining. Why are you so pointy?”
It looked like he stopped at his home for a shower, as he wasn’t covered in blood and not dressed for battle, wearing a pair of jeans and a black t-shirt. Draco felt as though he could laugh at the sight if he weren’t in so much pain—not very intimidating garb for someone known as a baby snatcher.
Remus shook his head. “No but I think it’s because they’re Animagi and the wolf recognizes their counterparts as part of the pack. Harry isn’t an Animagus and he has werewolf blood. Your wolf wants to help him along: make him a part of your family.”
Harry burst out laughing. “That is not what I sound like, mate. I grew up in Surrey, not Bristol.”
"I wasn't the one who declined friendship. That was all you." Draco laid down on his bed, missing the werewolf colony more than anything at the moment. He closed his eyes.
“That would be great,” Harry replied enthusiastically. “I’ve always felt more connected with magic around me rather than channeling it through a wand—I think learning some of the Old Ways could help me hone those skills more.”
Harry answered with a kiss and his heart soared again. Draco pulled him close as the kiss deepened and Harry laughed into it, carding his fingers through his hair.
“The same it always is, dear,” Lucius responded. He looked over at Draco and Harry. “Hello, boys.”
Draco frowned. “There’s a way to find that out,” he said, mostly to himself.
Harry nodded. “He possessed Gin. She always says it felt horrible and almost like a Dementor crowding around her. I remember her being very irritable with Ron during that time. Stupid diary.”
“Of course I’m not disappointed in you! You unfortunately inherited my depression, babe. That doesn’t make you weak.” Sirius brushed Harry’s wild mane back gently with his fingers, wondering if it was a step too far. He couldn’t help but reach out after hearing how broken he was feeling.
“August.”
After a long moment, Harry broke eye contact, effectively breaking the momentary spell. “Well, I’m glad you’re here. It’s been boring.”
Blaise reached out and squeezed Draco’s hand. “You should say whatever you need to in order to heal. He’s upended your life in so many ways. You deserve closure.”
“Well of course the Early Soul,” she remarked, not looking up from her notes.
“It’s a little dim, but I can see fine.”
“Should we all be so lucky,” she sighed. “At least your son doesn’t look like you anymore or else the world wouldn’t be able to tell you apart. This happened via the Garden of Souls?”
Snape bristled at that. “What are you on about now, Potter?”
Harry looked down at the text. “It’s my favourite.”
Harry shrugged Bill’s hand off of his shoulder finally. “I feel fine.”
“I just wanted to say sorry.”
Harry had been in the foulest of moods since Remus had pulled the plug on his nightly ventures. He would either be hiding out in his and Draco’s shared room or causing a scene in the kitchen or living room. Rarely, he would give an answer to how he was feeling—if anything, it made him more irate. There was no talk of any attempted kissing; in fact, Draco thought Harry was probably too drunk to remember. Draco wasn’t willing to divulge that information either, lest he become Harry’s next object of derision.
Draco winced and turned to Harry. “Are you ready for a parental meltdown?” he asked, hearing Remus running down the stairs at the sounds of Draco’s voice.
His five companions stopped with him, sharing nervous glances. “Alright, Weasley?” Blaise asked.
“He’s not my husband, Parkinson.” Draco rolled his eyes, but he was smiling at Harry. He could tell he was very excited about this tryout. “That’s great, Haz.”
Draco wanted to get out of bed to embrace Harry at that but was still struggling to walk on his own. He could only watch from afar as Remus comforted Harry. He didn’t know what either of them did to deserve Remus in their lives but he was glad for him. He was shocked at how gentle and caring Remus could be after knowing he was raised by Fenrir Greyback who was gruff at best. However, Draco noticed the soft spot Fenrir had for Remus: he somehow found himself appreciative of the elder wolf for taking his quasi parent away from an abusive path. He wondered if that’s what Remus was trying to do for him in turn.
“Me too.” The malaise of that statement and what it meant for Harry’s life hung in the air for a while after that. Dumbledore handpicked his pawn for the greater good, it seemed.
“He’s
Harry rested his eyes on the Slytherin in disdain as he continued. “I’m in a constant state of stress. My Dad doesn’t want me to go back out there and every second I waste here, while nice, is a second more He is out there torturing and killing innocent people.” The objects around the library began to rattle as Harry felt himself coming undone. “Draco is fine—slightly smothering, yes, but I would rather have his constant attention than be left alone with my thoughts all day.”
Harry nodded, grinning. “Go do your Prefect thing.”
Draco laughed. “Yes, my boyfriend sharing a room with me is such a burden, you’re right.”
Draco’s eyes widened, suddenly remembering. He opened his mouth to ask his father how but he was suddenly surrounded by Healers. They took a bunch of vitals, asked him what year it was, and instructed him not to move too much. He wasn’t given any information as to why he was so worse for wear. Maybe they didn’t know either.
“You’re fine, Potter,” Draco reassured.
Harry opened his eyes as tears began to well up. “I just don’t understand how I deserve this. Everyone has lost so much, why do I get to have a happy ending in this?”
Sirius looked to mediwitch, who frowned. “Should be fine. Let me just grab his Healer for approval and I’ll take you to Mr. Potter.”
Draco nodded. “It’s hard, though. He’s having such a rough go.”
Alarmed, Jack, who was introducing him to everyone, knelt beside him. “Are you alright?” he asked.
Draco frowned again. “I guess.” He looked towards the door as she turned the wireless on for him. “Can you wake Potter up? I want to look at his face.”
“Draco,” Blaise tried, looking desperate and sad, face twisted in remorse.
Harry squeezed back. “I know,” he replied, “that’s why I’m so nervous.”
“You know what I mean,” he huffed. He then inched closer to Draco so that their noses were almost touching. All Draco could really see were his eyes and suddenly it was if he was with the old Harry. It made him excited and frustrated all at once. Harry made a move to wrap his arms around Draco, but Draco backed away further into his room, realizing what was being propositioned here.
“We can see if the Garden will work for you.”
He stopped at Draco’s door, frowning. He shouldn’t bother him, he thought. He was so tired, though, and he knew he’d probably let him in. He glanced over at Ron’s door. He couldn’t show up drunk in Ron’s bed—he’d be cross at him. He swallowed his nerves and chanced a knock.
Harry frowned. “He is a bit of an egomaniac isn’t he? Surprise on him, I’m a Pureblood. Bully that.”
Sirius nodded around his tea, eyes a little dark. “I know. I’ve made quite a few mistakes with him, trying to be a friend rather than a guardian. I didn’t want to step on James’s toes, you know?” Remus hummed in agreement, all too familiar with that feeling as of late. “Now that I know I’m actually his parent, I don’t feel like I’m overstepping any boundaries. He hasn’t had a parent, though, Rem. It might be too little too late.”
“You said you’re in turmoil—you’re not fine, how can they be fine?”
"Thank you."
Draco nodded, processing the information quickly. “So it may be fixable, then.”
Once out on the street, Harry leaned against the brick wall. “That was close wasn’t it?” he laughed.
The rest of the ride was quiet. Draco was dreading having to separate from the Golden Trio, so much so that he begun to question his sanity. This was some rare form of Stockholm Syndrome if he ever saw it. He needed to get a grip; being soft in front of Slytherins was suicide.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “I’m not freaking out?”
Sirius frowned but nodded, eyes still scanning the treatment page—it was quite extensive. He looked up. “Have you discussed any of this with him yet? You should know that he doesn’t like being left out of the loop—he’s dealt with that too much in his life, already.”
Bill was nonplussed. “You’re covered in blood and bruised up pretty bad. I think your dad will kill me if I take you home without getting medical attention.”
“I don’t know how to pull him out of it.”
One of the Aurors stepped in. Harry couldn’t recall his name or he never much cared to ask. “We have notice me nots on all of you, including Mr. Malfoy. This venture will be a safe one.”
“Brilliant, you can stand in line behind Harry. If we get enough members we plan to fuck off to France.”
“How are you feeling after everything?” Hermione asked.
“Who is that?”
“A long time ago sort of.”
Harry stood abruptly as Remus gave Draco a warning glare. "Well good thing he isn't then, isn't it?" He huffed. "I'm sorry that you found life at the Manor to be too droll for you to deal with, but I'm here facing real problems and issues so don't think I want to sit here and listen to your unsolicited advice about what I should and shouldn't do. A bad day for you is waking up with messed up hair so excuse me if I don't feel like hearing any opinion about the shit I have to deal with."
Just the epilogue left!
of you.”
At the sight of his father, relief swept Harry’s features. “Hi, Dad,” he said, “those professor robes look great on you.”
They didn’t have much time to chat as Sirius approached them as soon as he entered the Hall. “Lo’, Dad,” Harry said.
The elder wolf looked larger than life, his long auburn hair wild about him, muscles flexed in his plain brown robes. As Greyback’s eyes narrowed at him time seemed suspended and everything slowed. He couldn’t hear the battle going on any longer—Draco realized Greyback had somehow created a shield around them in this moment, blocking everything out. He’d have to learn this wolf trick himself, he mused, but there were more important matters to attend to.
Remus laughed lightly in response. “You’re not going crazy. The wolf just wants to bring Harry into the pack. You’re probably more possessive over him as the moon nears, yes?” Draco’s silence was all the confirmation Remus needed. “It may calm down by marking him.”
“I need a Hogwarts uniform,” he explained quietly.
Lucius sighed. “I was trying to get you out of the Manor at that point. I didn’t need Voldemort experimenting on you or ordering you to complete impossible tasks that would have marred your soul. I wasn’t letting you get dragged down with me. It’s
Luck was on his side in that regard, it turns out, because Kingsley Shacklebolt was assigned to doing morning walks around Muggle London with Draco each day to work his legs out—Healer mandated.
Panic began to bubble inside of James. Did he really want to go back out there? “Don’t you need to get back to Harry?”
“Draco shook his head. “No. Well, sort of I guess. But that’s not the reason. This is the Garden of Souls.” Harry’s face scrunched up in confusion. “The only connection to the Manor is through Grimmauld as those are Lord owned properties. Nobody who has intent to harm the Heir or Lord can come through the wards. It’s really old magic.”
Remus, taking the hint, gave Harry a quick hug. “I have to grab some things for Draco before visiting hours are over—do you need anything from home? I can leave it at the front for you.”
“You’re seeing Healer Turner today, yes?” Draco asked carefully after he had spelled away the vomit and dug out a candle from his bed side table to get rid of the smell. Hermione had bought him a bunch of scented Muggle candles over the summer after learning that scent therapy seemed to help Draco calm down and he was quickly becoming a hoarder of all things mint, lavender, and apple.
“That would go great. I’m sure Weasley would be thrilled.” Draco refused to admit that he and Ron had nightly meetings about all sorts of things, starting with protecting Harry and ending with friendly chess matches. He didn’t want Harry knowing just how worried everyone has been about him, so much so that it was ending a blood feud.
The three stepped out onto the patio the overlooked the Garden. James couldn’t help but realize that he didn’t feel as connected with it as usually. He usually felt right and calm and in tune with those in the Garden with him. Maybe it was just because he was on the patio, but he couldn’t really feel anything but his anxious nerves.
“We’ll talk about that when we get there.”
“Harry, no. It’s not solely on your shoulders.” Draco reached up, pulling Harry’s chin to face him. “Fuck the prophecy. You didn’t start this war. You weren’t the one flinging Unforgiveables left and right. Dumbledore grooming you to be a war machine ends here. Focus on healing. We’re going to help you pick up the pieces, I promise. Don’t worry about some bloody war that our parents started years ago.”
Draco nodded again, secretly happy to have Severus giving him advice again. For a while, he felt as though he had the plague. When he returned to his quarters later that evening, he felt a bit lighter. This lightness didn’t last too long, for in the next few weeks, Harry came barging in with some news.
Sirius smiled. “Re has always been the parental type. Jamie and I—more hopeless I’m afraid. You’ll have to be a bit patient.”
When he met Draco for their Hogsmeade date, he didn’t speak of the possibility that he was not only a Seer but a Medium as well. He would rather not worry the Slytherin until it was confirmed. He did tell him he would try Dreamless Sleep again tonight, though.
, he supposed. She looked good—the dark circles around her eyes had lifted and she was in a cream coloured set of robes, making her look ethereal. He smiled at her, briefly masking his exhaustion. “I’ve missed you.”
“Draco we can’t—”
Draco chose to ignore the glib insult, actually wanting to learn something new about Pureblood lines. “But I’m not loyal. I defected.”
“Not really, no,” replied Draco. “I think it’s nice.”
Eventually, Ron and Hermione had to leave and his parents had filtered back in, scaring Harry off for the rest of the day, having to go into testing anyway for the better part of the afternoon. Remus had gone off to Grimmauld at Draco’s mention that he was cold, muttering something about returning cardigans and hot chocolate, leaving him alone with his family.
“Hey.”
“Change of heart?”
“He may have scented that the wolf was hurting. Maybe you weren’t dying but that’s how it read to him.” But Jack sounded doubtful.
“You’re completely on edge. Did something happen? Is everyone alright?”
Harry patted the thestrals in thanks as Draco tried to ignore the death horses. Ginny, Ron, and Hermione were still in awe of them, having not seen them prior to the final battle. Harry glanced at them and grimaced. “Shall we?” Draco asked, offering his arm. He was trying to get more comfortable with public affection for Harry’s sake, who listed touch quite high on his love language list. Draco begrudgingly had become more accepting of the hugs and small touches his friends and family seemed so keen on post-war.
Draco frowned in confusion. “Well, yes, but I thought it was a born wolf thing, or a pack thing. I didn’t think it could happen at any time.” He suddenly grew pale. “I could have turned Harry.”
Draco turned his head quickly, seeing that yes, indeed, it was Pansy sauntering into the Great Hall. He hadn’t seen her since the end of Sixth Year, though he had heard she wanted to turn Harry in to Voldemort during the battle. Her hair was longer, falling in waves, and was in a cream jumper with black slacks. She looked happier than he’s seen her in a long time.
Draco waved him off, taking another sip of the spiked tea, thankful for Sirius. “Blaise is coming here, tonight?”
Draco smiled. “You alright? Looks like you’ve been scratching your hand raw.”
He sat on his four-poster, rubbing his face tiredly. “It’s a bit complicated,” he said.
“Uh, yeah,” he offered in return. At the ex-Malfoy’s raised brow, Remus continued. “When I was turned, my mother took it as an opportunity to abandon me. She didn’t really like the abnormal. Frankly, I think I cramped her style to begin with – not really the mothering type. My father ruthlessly persecuted werewolves for years and I think he took my mother’s abandonment as a blessing. He did continue to financially support me, though. Paying for schoolbooks, keeping the village well-kept so I didn’t suffer much. Fenrir took me in without question. I was younger than his usual victims. I got attached. Hence, dad.”
Harry crossed his arms defensively. “I know a courting gift when I see one, Blaise—didn’t he tell you no?”
“Already ruined, Potter,” Draco replied in jest. “I have a disownment and a furry little problem that I’m sure everyone will catch onto eventually.”
Draco’s first week at Grimmauld Place was decidedly lonely. Everyone tended to give him a wide berth in the vast house, especially as the rumors of his motives behind wanting asylum swirled and transformed dramatically from person to person. He heard Weasley and Granger conspiring in the corner one day about how bright his eyes seemed to be, and attempted to attribute it to being under some sort of Imperius variation. Draco resisted outing himself again – Granger was too nosy for her own good and would put two and two together soon enough. If anything, his depleting health from the looming full moon would be a dead giveaway when the time came.
Remus stared at the empty spot in the doorway that Harry left, frowning. “I do hope he’s alright.”
“Well, yes. I know it can be mind-numbing here without anyone to talk to.”
The loose objects in the room were shaking with wild magic. Papers were flying around the room in a wind tunnel and the windows were clattering. Harry was at the center of the room, sat on his bed, and had his eyes squeezed shut, looking to be concentrating on breathing. Sirius quickly sat next to him, taking his hands in his own. Harry squeezed them tightly, letting out a shuddering breath. “I’m sorry,” he said, “I thought I had this under control.”
Draco frowned. “I’m not sure if that’s a good thing. He’s already irate during the day – I can’t imagine what he’ll be like at school.”
Bill smiled softly, looking far away. “Despite always getting into trouble, Fred was a great man. I’m just glad we’re all together.”
of him it made Draco’s skin crawl. He explained for Harry anyway when he noticed the Black Heir couldn’t seem to find the words. Hermione and Ron seemed to share Draco’s nausea. Ron paled so much that he turned gray. Hermione was just shaking her head in disbelief.
Draco groaned as he opened his eyes. “Mum?” he asked, and was quickly pulled into his mother’s arms. He squeezed her back to the best of his abilities, but he felt knackered. “We have to stop meeting in St. Mungo’s,” he joked.
Remus nodded, taking his shirt off. “I know. It’s okay—it’s from Samhain. Really powerful magic—your body is just responding to Harry’s display. It’s okay.”
“Honestly I’d thought you were cleverer than that.”
Draco made a false gagging noise and Ron laughed.
James was still in the same spot, albeit resting with his back up against an armchair rather than sitting on his haunches like a dog. He startled Sirius when he realized he was just stationed there, staring blankly into space, looking like he was the one who was bleeding hours before.
“We’re having a Samhain ceremony this week,” Harry said, changing the subject to try and ease the tension in the room. Harry was more willing to forgive Lucius as he did throw him his wand at the end of the battle. They wouldn’t be sitting in peace time without him. He knew Draco’s familial wounds ran deeper than that, though.
Remus could see where Sirius was coming from. He had to look past the young face to see the 36 year old underneath. He knew he wanted to help. “You need to approach him carefully, okay? He could be manic right now.”
Harry nodded tightly. “When I-you know…I think I was here briefly. I recognize the shrubbery.”
“Do I tell him about knowing? I don’t think they told him what’s going on: violates patient-Healer privileges doesn’t it?”
He looked at the tray, which consisted of some lighter fare: toast, an apple, some orange juice, and his nutritional potion. They quickly learned that Harry really couldn’t keep much down lately.
, Draco can you take 3
“Yes. The Zabini boy. The parents were escaping to America and he refused to leave.”
Harry and Sirius made it out of Hogwarts relatively unseen. Harry felt bad for not telling Hermione and Ron where he had gone, but he was sure they were busy enough attending to Ron’s family and dealing with Hermione’s parents.
Sirius nodded. “At Grimmauld.”
Her face of concern turned to one of excitement. “Your core is healing just fine.”
Draco frowned in confusion, eyebrows furrowing. “What are you talking about—of course I can see.”
Harry meanwhile was trying his best not to let his magic loose on his dorm. He felt their stares on the back of his head when they saw that his trunk was in its usual place. It still clearly said H.J. Potter, he noticed. They seemed to notice too. When he reached into his trunk for his pajamas Seamus spoke: “What are you doing? That’s Harry’s trunk.”
Harry shrugged. “Like I got hit by a bus a little.” Sirius gently wrapped an arm around Harry and he leaned into the touch, carefully cradling the mug so the contents wouldn’t spill over. He chanced looking up at his father and was taken aback to see some tears brimming in his bright blue eyes. The guilt welled up inside of him for making things even worse than they already were post-war. “I didn’t know that cheering charms could make it worse—I’m sorry, Dad.”
Severus just shook his head. “You’re disowned so anything you do won’t befall negatively on them. They are fine. Don’t fret about them.”
“That’s enough, Draco,” Remus responded. “Theodore made the right choices in the end. I’m sure you know what it’s like to feel that kind of familial pressure.”
Harry’s eyes narrowed. “What are you saying?”
Draco took stock in himself at that. He
Harry cursed under his breath. “You’re probably right.” He sunk into the pillows and closed his eyes. “You’re right though: one down.”
Draco shrugged. “Perhaps.” He took Harry’s arm again. “Anyway, I’m not here to show you the house: I want to show you the garden.”
Sirius snorted. “I surely hope not—you’ll run them into the ground. We are going to have to get a press agent, though.”
Everything associated with Hogwarts seemed to be too difficult for Harry to bear. He thought going back to school would serve as a welcome distraction but being referred to as Mr. Black would shake him back to the harsh reality of his situation. He wished he would have just went by his actual name instead of trying to throw suspecting students off of his trail. They weren’t dumb: a new name wouldn’t keep them from the truth for long, especially when it looked as though Harry Potter was missing.
James grinned. “Cheers, mate. I’ll let you get back to it with Remus. If you see Harry, tell him we say hi.”
Hermione frowned. “Can you still speak Parseltongue?” she asked.
It was messy and desperate and had entirely too much teeth but it was the best kiss Draco ever had. It was like Harry was pouring himself into him and he was addicted. He reached up his hand to tangle it in Harry’s mane, bringing him closer. Harry climbed on top of him and Draco rose to meet him, only to cry out in intense pain. It felt like his chest was tearing.
“I know. You’re going to have to see a Healer. I know just the one. Get cleaned up, you’re coming with me.”
Draco laughed at that. Harry liked seeing the poshness fade from his face when he smiled. “I called him my wolf dad when I was on pain potions.”
Blaise raised his hands in defeat. “I’m sorry I said anything—I can’t help that you’re dead on your feet at he doesn’t know how to leave well enough alone.”
Remus only laughed again. “Well, I was a little worried, too. When I woke up and noticed you weren’t around, I wondered where you could have gone off to.”
“I’m just glad you found him, mate,” Ron said. “I don’t have any freaky healing magic that would have helped him.”
Harry insisted on following Draco to their room, despite Draco's assertions that he was not made of glass. Once he was safely in bed he expected Harry to leave. Instead, he also decided to rest. "Don't you have friends to yell at, Potter?" Draco drawled.
“Piss off Ron.” Harry swept out of the room and into Draco’s, who was a little more forgiving when he crawled into his four-poster and cried.
Remus was through the door quickly, looking a little rough himself. He felt Draco’s head, his face twisting in concern. “Okay. I’m going to have to put you in stasis again before the transformation,” Remus informed the blond.
After that first night of solace with Draco, Harry tried to squash his feelings down to no avail. He snuck out in the morning before Draco could wake up and realize that he had, indeed, spent the night curled up against him: Harry couldn’t face the rejection right now. Not like that night at the club.
“You could always Apparate with us and walk from Hogsmeade,” Sirius suggested. Sirius and Remus were joining faculty this year and Harry was thrilled to have them coming back to school with him. However, just because he was now a teacher’s kid, it didn’t suddenly mean he didn’t want to take the train, though.
“Quite. Bleeding out in the Garden apparently may result in resurrection—who knew?”
Harry shifted uncomfortably but showed him anyway, looking away in shame as Remus felt his forearms gently. He caught Draco’s eye who just gave a half grimace in return as he reached for one of the many books off of his bed stand, happy to not be in the path of Remus’s anger. “Do they hurt anymore?”
Draco nodded in affirmation, deep in thought. In their silence, an owl flew through the window, dropping a letter on Harry’s lap. It had a Ministry seal on it. “What’s that?” Remus asked.
Harry glanced at Draco quickly and back down at his plate. Draco frowned in confusion. Wasn't the Golden Boy supposed to be brazen at all times? Why was he coming off so small and sad? "Just the usual nonsense," Harry replied. The black haired wonder let out a heavy sigh. "I just can't control myself much anymore. I'm losing my mind stuck in here."
a werewolf. And Theo is a Death Eater: isn’t that right, Theo?” Theo glared daggers at him in response, standing. “Now, shall we continue to address each other by demarcations outside of our control or are you going to grow the fuck up?”
Blaise deflated at that. “Why not? I promise I will never do that again. It was stupid and cowardly and I’m so sorry.” He took Draco’s hands again, opting to kneel in front of him rather than sitting next to him, creating the illusion of begging. The few First Years that were in the Common Room began to whisper excitedly to one another. Draco sent a glare their way but it didn’t seem to quell their gossip.
Narcissa just smiled and took Draco’s hand gently into her own. “That’s not for you to worry about it, dear,” she said. Lucius didn’t say anything.
Harry just nodded. “I wish I could talk to her. I want to know why she did this to me.”
Despite Draco losing control, the night was still one to remember: Harry didn’t think he’s seen Ron so happy since the final battle. He supposed his newfound power wasn’t all bad, annoying Dark Lords and all. He would never change this night for anything, wolf incidents included.
Harry nodded, uncurling to sit up with his father. “I know that. Walburga is always screaming about you.” Sirius grimaced at that. “Is that why?”
Remus nodded and disappeared again. Harry sat on one of the overstuffed armchairs in the room, drawing a pillow to his chest. “Thanks for letting us meet here instead of the Hospital Wing. It’s so sterile over there.” He shuddered. He truly despised hospitals.
Harry took Draco’s arm with a small smile, looking more like Sirius when he brightened up like that. “Let’s go.”
“Somehow, yes.” Remus sat back at the table, gesturing Draco to join him, which he did. “We ran the gamut of questioning to ensure that it really was him, though Seer assured me that only an Heir or Lord would actually be able to apparate here. Probably splinched himself trying to bring everyone with him.”
“I’m so glad you’re okay,” James said. “It was utterly terrifying to watch it unfold and not be able to help.”
Draco, who had been sitting on the bench across from them to give them some space, couldn’t resist interrupting. “What?” he said in disbelief. “Is this what Regulus was keeping from me?”
“Not too terrible, surprisingly. He’s very quiet.”
"Why did that man put this in your head?" Remus agonized, mostly to himself. "You're not poisoning your wolf. It makes it easier to ignore base instincts when you transform – the wolf is still all there, it just makes sure you're all there with him. Besides, this will lessen the ill feelings before and after transforming and most likely save your life. There's not much to debate here, Draco."
When he next awoke, night had fallen and his parents were gone. He felt very sore as he tried to readjust himself; the pain was still quite unbearable when he was in between potions. He called for a Healer and they reupped his IV, noting that he was sleeping when it was time for a new bag and they didn’t want to wake him. He smiled in thanks and settled back into the pillows.
“Haz?”
Remus rubbed his face in his hands, clearly at some sort of mental breaking point. “Because I’m so tired of the universe rewarding you and Haz for reckless behaviour, even if I’m glad for the outcome each time. I just want one normal day where nobody I love goes charging into something insane, but I’m beginning to believe that’s too much to ask.”
Draco rested his head against the wall. “Meddlesome Weasleys.”
“Oh, so you’re familiar with the concept! Fantastic.”
Draco couldn’t shake his fever for about a week after his first full moon. His body was sore from the transformation – his arm never felt more ready to be severed from his body. He was put back up in his rooms where a little worse for wear Remus and Jack took care of him. Once again, Draco felt guilty for treating the professor poorly during his time at Hogwarts. Lupin was much too kind to someone who tried to make his life miserable, and it made Draco feel ashamed and angry all at once. “I don’t deserve this – stop making me feel guilty, already!” he burst out about midweek to a patient Remus checking his vitals.
Remus let out a laugh as he fluffed the ex-Malfoy’s pillows. “I’m going to rest a while. I’m not exactly tip-top shape myself. I’ll wake if you yell for me though.”
James reached over and pulled him into a bone-crushing hug. “I love you so much, did you know that?”
we’ve been sneaking out? We were so careful!”
he chided himself, making him feel even worse.
Still frowning, Remus gave Draco those dreaded words: “I’m going to have Bill check you out anyway.” Draco groaned in response.
He wouldn’t get a reprieve after the news of his future procedure because suddenly Sirius was knocking on the door frame with his father at his side.
“I didn’t realize he was still hurting from everything,” she said, completely shattered. “I should have.”
“You’ll do great,” Draco said, squeezing his shoulder. “Tomorrow is going to be so healing for everyone, I just know it.”
I spent some time there before Gringotts as well. I might have some valuable information for you." Bill felt Draco's head and tsked. "And let's not kid ourselves about how ill you've been in correlation with how ill other werewolves feel. You look ready to fall over and the moon is four days away."
While the year had many challenges ahead, things seemed to be alright for now, which is all they could ask for.
“He has set back our cause greatly, and, thus, must pay even greater.”
Sirius’s eyes narrowed in suspicion but he didn’t press any further. “I don’t think the Garden knew when to stop. I got thrown into Azkaban at 22. I think it reverse-aged me a bit.”
There was a smile in his voice. “’Fraid so.”
It was Remus who sprang to his feet first, pulling Draco into a tight hug. “You’re so, so, stupid. Never do that to me ever again.”
Draco nodded thoughtfully. “BPD?”
“And she can’t wait to see you,” Draco replied sarcastically.
James looked down. “Odd, isn’t it? I didn’t think I could have earthly objects affect me like this.”
Molly looked up from her knitting and offered a forced sort of smile. “We did a bit more cleaning and found it. Do you not like it?”
So Harry explained everything about his sixteenth birthday: how there was an adoption spell that broke, that Lily had to have known about it, that Remus thought they were Confunded, how hard it was getting used to his new face. He carefully edited out the parts about the manic depressive episodes and the suicide attempt. He didn’t want to completely shock his father. When he finished, Sirius was staring at him gobsmacked.
The feast felt heavy for those whose last time in the castle was a time of loss and desperation. Harry felt himself regretting not going with Ron and his father when he had the chance. Ghosts in the more Muggle sense were littered throughout the hall. Harry couldn’t look in any direction without seeing a battle remnant, a fallen friend, a hurt companion. It was quite overwhelming.
“Haven’t had a single night’s rest yet.” Harry leaned forward to rest his head on his hand propped by his elbow on the arm of the chair. Even though he had grown used to therapy, it still felt weird divulging so much personal information. “The first night was a typical nightmare. Just reliving everything in my head. But last night was strange.”
Remus nodded. “I’d like to see he’s okay with my own two eyes, anyway. I think he’s been at the colony long enough.” He looked at James. “How did this happen?”
Draco was getting nervous as he led him through the large French doors and into the garden. How would Harry react to all of this, he wondered. He knew it would eventually be a good surprise but he knew how fragile the dark-haired teen was. He didn’t want to stir anything back up.
Remus shook his head. “No. We’re not going down this road of self-loathing again, Draco. We’ve gotten past this years ago.”
Chatter broke out once again as Sirius and McGonagall dismissed everyone, but Harry felt a little ill at this news. He had no clue what he wanted to be and he wasn’t sure that shadowing a bunch of professors would be helpful. Draco looked a little put out as well, mumbling that he should just be allowed to shadow Madam Pomfrey since they all know he was headed to St. Mungo’s directly after school. Hermione looked beyond excited and immediately began to rattle off all of the special projects she hoped to accomplish. Ron didn’t seem to have any immediate reaction, just a shrug as he listened to Hermione. Nott just took a deep breath, exhaled, and left for his room. Everyone seemed to be handling the news differently.
Draco sputtered. “I’m sorry—it just slipped. We’re not—we don’t have to be—”
Blaise lit up. “So we
Hope you enjoyed this chapter. We are now entering uncharted territory past the oneshot: can't wait to share what happens next!
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco sighed. Did he really have to think through everything for the Boy Who Lived? “I’m sure there are some left over clothes from yester-year of his you can rummage through. Did you try the wardrobe?” he suggested.
“Could’ve fooled me.”
Draco felt like he was going to be sick all over again. It wasn’t as much of a surprise to him anymore, but every time Harry talked about how he had Voldemort’s soul
Harry rolled his eyes. “It’s nothing like that. It’s just that when you make those noises, my brain goes all fuzzy and I want to respond. I don’t feel the moon’s call or anything.”
When Sirius and Remus finally returned from their long conversation, Harry wasn’t anywhere to be found. Draco was looking a bit distressed although everyone else hadn’t seemed to notice, busy unwrapping gifts and playing games. When Draco saw the two men, he shakily stood with the help of his cane, wincing at the movement after being still for awhile.
“We weren’t gossiping,” Hermione offered, “We’re just concerned about you.”
“Wow,” Draco breathed.
Be on the lookout for a sequel, coming to AO3 soon!
and scowled again. “What could you possibly need from me at 4 in the morning?”
“You hurt me, Blaise,” Draco said, opting for honestly rather than saving face. Blaise winced at the confession.
Harry looked at him with wide, glassy green eyes. “You have depression?” he asked.
Draco woke up to the brightest white his eyes could take. It resulted in a splitting headache. “Ugh,” he groaned, voice sounding like he hadn’t used it in ages, closing his eyes. He felt someone stir beside him. Maybe he wasn’t dead?
"I'm not brooding," Harry growled lowly, to which Draco answered with a laugh. "Okay, maybe a little."
Draco pulled his hand away and balled it into a fist under the table as he tried to relax. Lucius’s apology didn’t make him feel happy or forgiving—it made him
"I'm sorry, didn't realize anyone was in here," Harry said. He looked at Draco. "You look ready to pass out, Malfoy."
Draco wasn’t expecting to hear that. “I heard you threw Harry your wand in the end—that should keep you out of Azkaban, don’t you think?”
“It’s not so bad, Weasley,” Draco responded evenly.
Harry huffed out a laugh. “Draco, your eye is
“You’re just on edge from the moon and from seeing your parents. Nott will eventually unclench, I hope. It’s going to take time. The battle is still fresh.”
He couldn’t keep it inside. It just bubbled out of him in rage. Harry’s tone got nastier as he said, “Like I don’t see you pining after my boyfriend day in and day out. You fucked up, not me. You lost him, get over it and stop poking your nose into others’ business.” Blaise looked at Harry in shock and anger. A vase shattered, startling Harry out of his demeanor, but the damage was done.
Ron smiled. “Thanks, Draco.”
been through and lost so much. Your life has not exactly been easy, has it? You’ve been given a gift. It’s time to enjoy life. It’s time to have family. You don’t have to play perfect soldier anymore.”
“I take offense to that,” Remus commented with a smile. “At least you’ll have someone your age around, with Ginny going to school soon.”
Remus frowned. “Not when it counted apparently. When Sirius was convicted I did nothing. Everyone thought I was the spy because of Fenrir. After all of the secrecy and eggshell walking around me for months, I felt betrayed that he’d actually be what his family was when I finally saw the paper. It was a mess. I never visited or requested a proper trial. I essentially let him rot there, too trapped in my own misery to see reason. Harry wouldn’t have had to be at the Dursleys if I demanded justice. Anyone could see it was Peter now.”
James rolled his eyes. “Why, Draco?” he lamented. “I’m 21 years old, for the love of all that is good just call me James.”
They had arrived at the meeting, thankfully, saving Draco from any further embarrassment.
Regulus sighed sadly at Harry’s revelation. “I know. War is hard, especially on those who survive it and must deal with the aftermath.” He squeezed his nephew’s hand. “I’m thankful to you, though. You finished what I started. We’re all so thankful to you, you have to know that, both living and dead.”
The Black Heir laughed in response. Draco loved that laugh. “You need to spend less time with Ron. You’ve become obsessed with food.”
Remus shook his head. “I don’t think so. I think we need to let the Healers do their jobs.”
“What? No. I’m alone. I would like to keep it that way, thanks.” Draco finally placed the voice when it was accompanied with a droll snark.
Ron let out a big breath. “Jeez.” Ron patted his knee affectionately. “Well, we’ll get this sorted, I’m sure, no sense starving yourself – come on.” Harry blinked. Was that all that was to be said?
“Did you hear anything about any objects? Any weird conversations?”
“Are you going to be cross when we need to go for rounds?” Hermione asked carefully.
"I know that it's painful. Having a crippling fever beforehand isn't great either. The Wolfsbane will help with that. It's not poisoning yourself, despite what my adoptive father likes to believe. It will give you relief. Your father has already provided more than enough funds for it from what I've heard. You won't have to worry about anything – just normal teenager stuff."
,” James replied, watching her exit and the Unspeakable to take her place by his bedside. “What can I do for you?” he asked. It wasn’t so long ago that Lily would be under that hood—he wished it were still the case.
Draco shifted uncomfortably, knowing exactly what
Harry frowned. What choice did he really have? “Fine.”
” he yelled, immediately alerting others as to where he was. Suddenly, wands were pointed at him. “Fuck,” Draco ground out as he began casting hex after hex,
Remus found himself victim of the infamous ice glare so commonly worn by members of the Black family any time he tried to speak to Harry. It was so eerily similar to Sirius’s facial expression of betrayal that it left the werewolf reeling every time it was critically aimed toward him. He was met with that stare the morning sixth year letters arrived.
“This is absurd.”
James shrugged. “Honestly, it was a suggestion of Dumbledore’s that I join: helpful to have some of those skills during a war and all that. I think I’ve had enough playing soldier to last a lifetime, though.”
“No, I’ve been just seeing Dad every day.”
Draco shook his head. “No, you misheard me. I
"Don't remind me."
Draco sighed, unable to resist the sad Potter face. “Fine. But only for tonight.”
“I dunno what to say, really. Thank you—I’ll have to speak to my guardians about it now that it’s been brought to my attention.” Draco smiled. “This is great news.”
Harry looked up from
“Something had to top you beating the shit out of Sirius all those years ago.”
“Dark magic remnants?” Ron asked, almost scared to know what that meant.
“Blaise was probably scared. Things are beginning to become very real. I’m not sure if you can find it in him to forgive him—Merlin knows if Sirius ever forgave me.”
“I wanted to make sure it would work. It did. I didn’t talk to your dad or anything.”
“I would hope not, Lucius,” the Dark Lord advised. “Lest you want to completely end your line.”
"What do you mean no?"
. You’re not risking going blind for me. I won’t have that.”
“How did it even happen?” Lucius asked. His hand twitched as though he was holding back from reaching out. Draco leaned back just in case his father actually got the urge.
Sirius nodded, facial expression solemn. “I know, Haz. But I’m your father—I know you’re not used to it but I’m here to support you no matter what. I can’t help you when you martyr yourself and suffer in silence.” He closed his eyes, pushing the despair he was feeling down. Harry was safe and alive and finally in good hands. “I’m just so glad James got to you when he did.”
Draco’s smile turned into a grimace. “Yeah, it didn’t get a proper chance to heal before the full. It ripped open this morning. Too bad I can’t heal it myself.”
Draco turned to Blaise. “How bored were you that you had to start this, then?”
Harry nodded.
“’The cause’ got compromised for you as soon as Draco turned. Don’t be daft with me,” Remus said, taking another sip of his coffee nonchalantly. It was almost wicked how he was working the sick son angle, but damn it if he wouldn’t try to bring Draco and his mum back together. “We’re going to beat him again. You don’t want to be on the wrong side of history for a second time, do you? I strongly doubt an Imperius defense will get you through it this time.”
"And growing fangs once a month," Draco replied sarcastically, but he was already feeling better. "Thanks, professor."
He sat at the fireplace willing Harry to return late that evening. It was too dangerous out there for him to be exposed in whatever sort of elements they were subject to. Draco knew, however, that Harry would not be as daft as to return to Grimmauld Place after so much time had passed: there was no way to tell if it was safe. Besides, it wasn’t as though there were anymore horcruxes lurking within the walls of that old house. No, there was no reason for Harry to return, not when the entire wizarding world rested on his shoulders.
“I know. I’m doing my best.”
"What in Merlin's name..." Draco wondered, following the voices to the kitchen. Harry was standing on the opposite side of the kitchen, red in the face from bellowing, his hair wet with sweat. Nearer to Draco was Hermione and Ron. Hermione looked like she was about to cry and Ron looked to be made of pure rage.
“Hello is a good start. Call his name.”
Draco frowned. “Shouldn’t I be asking that to you, seeing as you have a new face and all?” he replied. Ron and Hermione looked on warily, probably thinking Draco was poking a bear.
“I just realized you said you wanted to show Draco your scars. I didn’t realize they finally healed you. Can I see?”
James soon appeared and had a similar reaction to Harry’s appearance. “How did you do that, Reg?” James looked exactly like the old Harry minus the eyes. Harry felt an ache in his chest when he noticed how young his father looked: he was 22.
"Behave," Remus warned.
They headed back down to the courtyard where James spotted Lily. He stopped in his tracks at the sight of her. “Lils!” he cried. He pulled her into a tight hug and she laughed happily. “I’ve missed you so much,” he said, eyes welling up.
“Better than you, I’m assuming,” Draco replied, sipping at his coffee. “I knocked for five minutes before I realized you had already left.”
Remus frowned at the shift in facial expression. “His trial is coming up at the end of the week.”
Draco was acutely aware of how angry Harry must have felt all the time for the past few years. It made him feel wild and out of control as he spat venom in response to his father’s apologies and excuses. “Yes, very heroic. Let Voldemort stroll into our house, act as his right-hand man, help turn your 15-year-old son into a werewolf, force said son out of his home and into a werewolf colony, and manage to go turncoat right at the end to avoid prison or a Dementor’s Kiss.
“Where is Remus?”
And he was, though only bile came up. It did make him feel a bit better, though, and the dizziness faded some. Sirius ran out to the Garden and helped James back up onto the patio. “Now I
he thought to himself.
At that, Remus grabbed a piece of toast off the table and sat down, ignoring the teens. Draco looked around at the shocked faces and shrugged, joining Remus at the table. Harry,
Harry sighed. “It’s really complicated. Ron left, upset that we weren’t making enough progress, so Hermione and I moved camp. There was a Patronus of a doe and I followed it. It led me to the sword.”
Healer Turner looked like he hadn’t had much sleep either when he entered Harry’s room. His auburn hair was rivaling Harry’s old look and his dark green eyes looked a bit duller than usual. He was in Muggle looking scrubs rather than the lime green Healer’s robes Harry had become so accustomed to during his time at the hospital. “I didn’t think wizard doctors wore those,” Harry commented.
Draco squeezed back, unable to express how being called ‘good’ for once felt. “Come back later?” he opted for instead.
Remus and Jack looked between each other. “Well you
Fenrir squeezed his good arm gently. “You’re one of the pack—I protect what’s mine.” Draco didn’t expect to feel so warm from that statement and bit back a grin. He wondered if Father would be furious that he was pleased to be accepted into a werewolf pack. Fenrir glanced at the slinged arm again, frown deepening. “You know it has to heal on its own, though, right? We can’t help it along.”
“Blaise, however, noticed me too, and didn’t hate me. He saw me for who I was. We dated in secret for a long time.” Draco paused at that, lost in his own thoughts. How could he ever consider it just a fling? Why were all of these emotions suddenly bubbling over? Why was he feeling guilty thinking about if Harry saw him like this? He shook himself. “Anyway, he broke it off before Fifth Year began and today I found out it was because he didn’t trust me enough to not sell his family out to the Dark Lord.”
That was, at least, until the morning of Harry’s sixteenth birthday.
Harry pinched the bridge of his nose, closing his eyes in frustration. Would he just get off his case, already? He slammed the book shut as he said, “I love Draco, Blaise. Ever think I’m just tired rather than having ire for someone who literally saved my life?” Blaise felt a full on Potter meltdown coming on and he instantly regretted beginning the conversation in the first place. He really was only trying to help.
“Dad?” His throat
Sirius nodded, grinning. “Us,” he confirmed.
Draco shrugged, nursing his drink rather than meeting Blaise’s eyes. He was obviously on to him.
Hermione looked towards Draco and gave him a quick nod, the two anticipating that this might happen. Draco moved into action. “Give me a minute, Ron. You don’t have to go in there.” He took a deep breath and marched into the Great Hall alone, making a beeline for the teacher’s table.
“What do we do about this?”
Harry looked at her oddly, as if he had realized she was still in the room. “Uh, yeah,” he replied lamely, scratching the back of his head with his hand awkwardly. “Nothing to worry about.”
"Stop being so nice to me," Draco bit back. He felt foolish immediately after when he saw Harry recoil a little. "Sorry, it's just messing with my head."
The pain
Draco felt warm at that. Never would he imagine that coming out of Harry Potter’s mouth. “I’m your Ithaca?” he repeated lamely.
Draco nodded, wintry eyes tight with concern. “He said it was due to nicotine withdrawal. I dunno about that, though. I think he was having an anxiety attack when he noticed the two of you went off.”
He looked down at his ex-boyfriend. “I loved you, Blaise,” he said sadly.
Draco shrugged the shoulder of his dressing gown to the side to show Harry his Fenrir bite around his bicep, still a light red shade that most likely would never whiten up. Harry had never seen it before, Draco wearing long sleeves throughout the summer, and was shocked by how large the bite actually was.
“Why don’t you just tell Draco you need a break? He won’t be upset.” he asked shortly after Draco left the Black library to shower. The three of them were doing research on werewolf complications via Draco’s request. The moons have only been getting worse for him, and without Remus willing to bite him, he was left to his own devices to find a solution. Luckily, the Black library was well stocked with tomes of all subjects and they had their work cut out for them.
At the next persistent knock, Draco sighed, rolling over and trudging his feet towards the door, the guilt overwhelming him for making Harry wait so long. When he opened it, he barely had a moment to ask what was going on before having an armful of Harry bound towards him, gripping him tightly.
Another nod. “It just took me by surprise. Haven’t had one in a while.”
“Kind of hard not to.”
“I know, but that was for resting. It’s a little different when we’re ‘operating.’ You’ll probably feel a bit out of it afterwards and depending upon how much the dark magic puts up a fight while we’re working our magic, some pain too. It’ll be fine, though.”
Draco was not his father. Neither was Ron.
“But I saw you,” Lucius looked back up and stared into Draco’s eyes, this time, not cowering away from his appearance. “You were brilliant and you helped so many people. You brought pride to the family name for the first time in decades.” He reached out to grip Draco’s hand. “I’m
It was a giant side by side photo of him and Harry. The headline read
Harry laughed. “Madam Hooch, this is the most excited I’ve been all term. Thank you for thinking of me.”
Draco wished he had that level of self-confidence. “Oh look, there’s Dad.”
Harry nodded. “The diary was one of them.”
Draco looked around. “Yeah,” he replied lamely. “They were able to move me out of the emergency wing this time, I suppose.” As the kettle whistled, Draco took it off the stove top and poured into his mug. “Sure you don’t want any?” he asked, his tone a practiced even-keel.
Hermione gasped at that, apparently Harry hadn’t filled them in just yet. Draco grimaced at her in apology as Harry began to ramble.“Managed to get the un-doctored memory from Slughorn that confirmed it. He wanted to make six. He doesn’t know about me being a horcrux, and that’s gone so we don’t have to worry about it. Then there’s the diary—also gone. Dumbledore has one, but he’s been struggling to destroy it. He knows of another one that he’s trying to figure out how to get—with any luck that will be taken care of by the end of term. So that makes—why are you all looking at me like that?”
Draco to hide him away. “You did spend some time at the colony this summer. I’m sure you feel more connected.”
The blonde sighed. That was two weeks away and he needed details—he desperately needed to know if Blaise was okay. “Fine—as long as Remus arrives soon to fill me in.”
And he seemed to. In the days leading up to his birthday, Harry made more of an effort to at least sit in the same room as his best friends. Hermione seemed pleased that the two regularly would read quietly with one another, Draco joining at times as well. He and Ron would quietly convene to play chess in the evenings, Ron always besting Harry. Remus, Molly, and the other adults looked happy to see the younger group finally getting along, smiling along to their dinner conversations and willingness to work together around the vast manorhouse. The tumultuous Fifth Year seemed to be moving into the rearview, with Ron, Hermione, Harry, and Draco knitting some fragile form of kinship.
Harry sighed, rubbing his face in his hands. “The thing is, I think he was banking on my connection with Voldemort to figure out what the other objects are. I haven’t a clue and I haven’t heard a whisper from him since the horcrux is gone.”
James, you have absolutely no idea.”
“Scum of the Earth,” Remus commented bitterly.
Home. It warmed Draco’s heart that Black Manor was considered his home now, even if the world was still burning around him. Hopefully, when he got back the world wouldn’t be so shaken that the tentative bond he had forged in the lion’s den would still hold—only time would tell.
“Yep, you’re our Hogsmeade trip,” Hermione said.
Blaise nodded. “You think he’ll forgive me?”
Sirius nodded knowingly, taking the vials and placing them in the First Year cupboard. “You’re quite inseparable lately. Ah, young love.”
Regulus smiled. “That’s a nice gesture. Who is it then, Remus? How would you get in with an Order member like that?”
cousins thing?” Draco chanced.
Fenrir was pleased by this, giving him a grin when he noticed he was alright. Jack looked well-pleased too, clapping him on the shoulder for a night well-spent.
Ron sighed. “My parents wanted us to integrate with the more secular traditions but they still keep an altar. I want to pay respects to Fred but I need some help. Will you take part with me?” Ron asked again.
Harry looked a little ashamed at that and avoided everyone’s gaze as he explained. He most certainly didn’t look at Remus, who already knew why but was still a bit disappointed in him for it. “Well, that could be because I might have used an enchanted blade?” he began, using uptalk as a defense mechanism. Hermione, Ron, and Draco all looked appalled at that as they stared at the Black Heir in disbelief. Harry swallowed nervously. “The wounds will keep reopening until there is magic intervention…which they can’t do yet because of all of the testing. So they’ve just been bandaging me up really tightly until they can figure out what to do about the dark magic remnants.”
Harry nodded, forcing himself to take a few deep breaths as he absorbed the new information. “Alright. I guess take me home, then, if I can’t see him.”
“Tired—did it work, though? Is Blaise better?”
Harry thought about it. “I’m not sure what I should do, here.” He felt so lost. He wanted to honor both of his fathers, but he didn’t want to be bothered with gossip surrounding him. If he could delay that at all, he would.
“He is his wolf so no, but also these are his own feelings and emotions: he just recognizes the match. It’s probably how the two of you became so close so quickly when he arrived into the fold. He sensed it and you sensed it from him.”
“Writing Potter a letter to let him know how pissed off I am for him leaving me and how he should’ve thought twice about it,” Draco replied. Ginny let out a laugh at that.
Harry gave her a tiny smile in response. “Nah,” he said. “I think I’ll find Blaise, honestly.”
“That’d make it three down, one caught, three to go,” Harry replied in awe. “I can’t believe it was under our noses the entire time.”
He was moving around again and gaining strength back when Harry left a few days later. He felt deeply saddened by his departure. On the one hand, Draco was glad that they cleared him to leave on the condition of weekly Mind Healer sessions. On the other, Draco was fearful of what their relationship would become outside of the walls of St. Mungo’s. Would they have to hide away from the world? Would his parents be in danger? It made his head spin. Harry had just kissed him goodbye and told him not to worry about it: that it would be fine.
The blonde shrugged. “A little bit. I think we both know what the solution is and neither of us wants to say it aloud.”
Harry believed that he had seen enough bloodshed and battle before this day to be prepared for the waste about to be laid out before him—however, he had no idea what was to come. It felt like an ongoing explosion, with spells flying from every direction, some people resolving to Muggle means of fighting, and constant movement surrounding him—it was enough to feel dizzy with fear and anxiety. With little time to recognize just who had fallen and who was on whose side, Harry rushed about to gather the remaining horcruxes and destroy them, unwilling to let his mind dissolve into madness at the thought of Draco, Remus, and his father being in the depths of the castle themselves, fighting their way through. He had a mission to attend to and would kindly see a Mind Healer much later for all of the trauma he would bear witness to, thank you very much.
Severus hadn’t ever seen this level of power coming from a newly of-age wizard before. This was out of his hands and it was frightening. “Just breathe, Harry. Push it away. I apologize for feeding into it.”
Harry pinched the bridge of his nose, scrunching his eyes shut in frustration. "They're just always on me. They want me to go back to normal. I don't feel normal, why should I have to make nice for the sake of their feelings?" He agonized.
Harry was a bit downtrodden to be returning to Hogwarts. He received a letter from Dumbledore saying he was expecting him for tea when they got back. While he was excited at the prospect of getting some answers, a one on one meeting with the Headmaster seemed daunting to him: what would he even have to say?
Draco didn't realize the tears that were streaming down his face until he felt himself suddenly enveloped into a warm embrace. It was Potter. Draco didn’t realize he was making any sort of noise that would make Harry aware of his sadness, but soon realized a choked sobbing sound had been coming from him. He hadn't cried once since the summer began – he had only reacted in fear and mild annoyance. He hasn't seen his mother since Christmas – seeing her handwriting and feeling her love for him pushed Draco over the edge. He allowed Harry to hold him as he cried for everything he had lost and everything that was happening to the world. Harry rubbed his back comfortingly as he cried it all out until he was too tired to go on, succumbing to quiet hiccups and shaking slightly. "I have a headache now," he said, trying to break the awkwardness he felt from leaning on an enemy for comfort.
“Because I know you,” Remus replied, reaching up to gently wipe a tear away. “You fought off Samhain magic from a Medium last night to get yourself safely here. A Medium who is your soulmate. That is no simple feat. I’m sure it was terrifying, but you did it. And now you can transform out of the moon—you can master it. We all learn to do this.”
“That’s nice. ‘Draco, we’re so unstable a galaxy might explode between us. Happy Christmas,’” he said, trying to mimic Harry’s accent.
Draco had to physically pull Harry back at that comment, who had suddenly seen red and had leapt in the former Death Eater’s direction. “Harry it’s fine. I
Harry laughed and shook his head. “I’m alright, thanks.”
, attempting to reach his best mate and help him. As his memory alerted him that this may very well be the moment Harry was terrified about for months, giving him pause, a nasty stinging hex cut through his leg and his knees buckled. “Damn it.” He desperately looked around to see who cast it, shielding himself from an onslaught of hexes, but he could not locate the culprit. In his haste to try and continue towards Blaise, leg burning, he stumbled smack dab into none other than Fenrir Greyback. Draco’s eyes were like saucers as he realized who he was face to face with, not expecting to see him in battle or dealing with wizarding affairs at all, despite turning him almost two years ago.
Draco scrunched up his face at that. “And why not? That’s where I’d be if you didn’t come.”
“You scared me,” he laughed. He gave Draco a quick peck, happy to be away from prying eyes for the moment. “Happy Christmas.”
Thanks for reading, guys.
Draco rolled his trunk up the stairs, thankful he didn't run into anyone else on his way to his room. Suddenly he was missing his lush digs at the werewolf colony. He wondered if it was too late to try and go back, considering they were less savage than Potter was being at the moment. When he reached the room with his late cousin's name on it, he felt his heart go to his knees. He really didn't want another explosion on his hands. He swallowed down his nerve and knocked. When nobody answered, Draco spoke up. "Potter, it's me. I just wanted to put my things in here. Can I come in?" The door swung open to Draco's relief and he entered, noticing Harry was sitting stone-faced on his bed, wand nowhere to be found. "Cool trick," he chanced as he rolled his trunk to the other side of the room where a bed awaited him. "I can do that too when I'm brooding."
“It’s me.” Draco squeezed his eyes tightly shut as he willed Harry to go away. Of course, one was never that lucky. “Can I come in?”
through 8
Remus leaned forward unexpectedly. “I have been trying to pry it out of Dumbledore ever since we found out something was off but he wasn’t budging. What happened?”
Everyone looked at each other in shock, “The Burrow? Why not the Ministry itself?”
“I didn’t know you were a Black scholar.”
Remus barked out a laugh as he settled into the overstuffed armchair next to Draco’s bed. “Thought you’d be interested in today’s headline,” he replied.
James had brought them to the station this year, drawing all the attention to their group. Draco wasn’t really fond of the limelight and knew he was in for a year of stares, glares, and press. He glanced at the third difference, Frances Woolworth, their publicist. She was fantastic at keeping the crowds away from them with small shield spells and sometimes an Auror or two, depending on the situation.
Draco wrenched the door open. “Do you have a death wish, Potter?”
“Oh good. So you can speak it to the living, then?” Draco replied with a wry smile and Harry’s cheeks reddened.
“Oh great,” Draco replied. “Now I’m officially behind.”
Harry didn’t need to be told twice. The water burned his throat as it went down, but it made him feel less disoriented. He looked up at the redhead with sudden remorse. “I’m sorry about—” but Bill just held up a hand.
“All of us: Lily, you, James. Peter wasn’t romantically involved so he didn’t really know about much of it. We had Dumbledore’s help. Jamie got pregnant and it was obvious Harry was mine. The prophecy aligned with the due date: we defied him three times and he was going to be born as July died. It was us or the Longbottoms.”
His mother, sensing the malaise Draco was now experiencing, pulled him aside over the Winter Holiday while on a shopping venture, away from the darkened and suffocating Manor. “Get out,” she commanded. “I’ve made my choice, you should be able to make your own as well.” Despite Draco’s protests of not wanting to leave his mother, who he had grown quite inseparable from, Narcissa had convinced him to seek out Dumbledore for asylum without his father knowing. His heart hurt thinking about her now, but she probably saved his life.
“Can I grab Blaise?” Harry looked at Draco in disbelief. “Fine, fine, don’t get your wand in a knot.”
“Another longstay? Please, I need to finish school. Everything else is fine.” Harry couldn’t imagine being stuck in St. Mungo’s again. There was no way. He’d rather be forced to stay home in the manor with a live-in Healer, he didn’t care if it would drain his entire Gringott’s account.
Sirius opened the door when he knocked. “You’re early, Haz. Everything alright?” His eyes crinkled in concern looking over his son’s small frame after pulling him into a tight hug.
“You have Kingsley guarding your door out there.” Sirius nodded towards the entrance to his room. “You’re strong enough to break a dampner if you really needed to—this is to help keep a lid on accidental magic while you heal. Your core needs rest. You’re not like Draco with endless regeneration energy.”
Harry’s quarters were pretty expansive it turned out: Sirius had to turn a corner from a kitchen area to actually find where he was located. The room was a sterile white, reminding him that they were in a hospital and not a five star hotel, but he had a nice sitting room that was separate from the hospital bed, and it looked like the bathroom was quite spacious as well. Sometimes being the savior of the wizarding world could have its perks, Sirius supposed.
It took him until after the Battle at the Department of Mysteries for Draco to develop the backbone to approach Dumbledore, and he was all too pleased to meet with the young heir. “To what do I owe this pleasure to, Mr. Malfoy?” he asked, announcing his presence to a very startled Draco.
There was a knock at the door then. Remus stood to answer it. Of course, it was Sirius, James, and Harry. “Everything alright?” Sirius asked. Draco wished he could sink into the couch and disappear. He didn’t feel ready to face anyone.
Sirius was shocked at the proposal. “Really? Samhain? Minnie might have my head over it,” he said when Draco asked him over tea with Harry on the weekend.
“Am I interrupting something, then?” a voice called from inside the room. The two jumped apart immediately and turned towards the voice.
“Sounds riveting.”
Marlene stood and began adjusting her hood. “Right. Well, I’m off to the next room—I’ll check in on you before you leave and we’ll work out a contact schedule. It’s seriously great seeing you alive and breathing, Jamie.”
“Remus?” they heard from the door.
“Honestly, I’m not that hideous to look at, am I?” Draco quipped, shifting uncomfortably.
Draco shook his head at that. It felt too risky. “I don’t trust myself. What if I turn him?”
Harry nodded thoughtfully, running a hand through his messy hair. The new cut made his hair look more like it used to before his transformation, albeit a little more manageable, falling in soft waves. Draco resisted running his fingers through it as he took Harry in. Gray joggers and a dark green tee, his father’s set that seemed to have never vanished from his closet despite getting an entire new wardrobe over the summer. He wasn’t wearing glasses this morning, making his bright green eyes stand out even more, looking so much like his uncle with his thoughtful expression on his face. How did Draco get so lucky, he wondered.
“You’re going to tinker with my insides?” Draco asked in a small voice.
“Nothing. Let’s just go. Don’t bother him, Blaise.”
, he thought.
The anger seemed to deflate out of Remus from that and was replaced with worry. “Why would you want to go there? Through the fireplace I’m assuming?” He glanced at the fireplace in concern.
Sirius barked out a laugh at that. “You’d think so, but no. We’ll figure something out.”
Draco nodded again in understanding: sometimes he needed to grip onto Harry to make sure he was still breathing. The war had touched them all. “I get it.” He leaned into his father, who tightly wrapped his arms around him.
“Cheers, mate,” Regulus called after him. “Isn’t he all sunshine?”
Turner nodded. “And at night?”
Harry grimaced at that. “I needed to blow off steam. I was losing it holed up with everyone.”
James frowned. “We’ll talk to your Healers about it, okay?” Sirius said. “But you’re right about them wondering what you’re up to. We’ll have to say something.”
“Yep, he’s awake.”
The majority of the train ride was quiet, with Ron every so often making light conversation with Harry about nonconfrontational things—Quidditch, who the new Defense professor would be—anything to keep Potter from brooding. It was a clever plan for Weasley, who, to Draco, never seemed to have much forethought about anything.
The accidental magic was getting stronger and uncontrollable the more Harry drank, leading Draco to a dreaded meeting with Dumbledore about it.
?” he asked. He would be lying to himself if he said it never crossed his mind. The pressure to become an Auror at the time seemed too much to seriously think about it, though. “I’m a bit out of practice: wouldn’t want to embarrass myself.”
Harry sighed and laid down beside Draco on the bed, fitting easily between the space between the edge and Draco. He kept his eyes to the ceiling as he said, “I know. I read the letters.”
Harry sighed. “It’s my trunk, actually.” He pulled out a pair of his father’s joggers and an old Ramones tshirt. He hadn’t really updated his sleepwear to fit his new height, settling for Sirius’s old wear. He pulled out his copy of the Odyssey as well, setting it on his bed.
“Can’t let you wander the streets alone can I?” But Kingsley was smiling. He had taken to the demi-werewolf and his dry wit.
“You just told me Voldemort scratched your arms up, of course you are. It’s fine, it’s just stress. Madam Pomfrey will sort you out.”
Draco nodded. “Wanna give it a go?” he asked.
Draco shook himself from the memory of that day. That was the longest conversation they held in some time; Harry hasn’t stopped by the Prefect dorms since the volatile October night. After that day by the lake Harry seemed to become the perfect student, buried in his work, not even giving Professor Snape a hard time. When he wasn’t in class he was by the lake or in the library, sometimes with Hermione but most of the time alone. It was day and night, honestly and Draco didn’t know whether to feel relieved or concerned. Maybe he didn’t need a Mind Healer after all and was finally getting on with life. Still, though, Draco couldn’t help but have his mind occupied by the Black Heir, much to his chagrin and Ron’s delight, ever excited to prey on the blonde’s affections.
The blonde nodded at that, feeling slightly more at ease. “Does he know where I am?”
“I’ve never heard of Samhain,” Harry said, “is it gory or something?”
Harry sighed but nodded. He was so sick of Healers after his long stay at St. Mungo’s, but he supposed Healer Turner would be alright. “When’s Draco coming home?”
"Well that's Draco's business isn't it?"
.” He looked down, though, in apparent shame. “I did what I had to do,” he muttered, just above a whisper.
Turner looked down at his maroon garb and back up. “Fieldwork uniform—makes it easier to get around and treat—those robes are difficult to do anything in, honestly. If you were awake for your last venture, you’d find that your Healers were in blue scrubs—emergency unit garb. We’ve been petitioning to do away with the robes for ages,” he responded.
Sirius huffed. “Jamie, you never breathe.”
The next day, Draco heard Seamus loudly complaining that someone had tipped of McGonagall and his stash was taken away. Harry looked crushed but he could see the wheels turning in his head. Draco wondered if he could manage to knick Harry’s Invisibility Cloak so he couldn’t run off to a pub.
Everyone started whispering excitedly to one another, but Sirius interrupted. “Hopefully, this will provide some much needed support in your career exploration: we know many of you may have changed tracks since the war,” his eyes found his son’s at that, who looked away quickly. “Sunday morning your first assignments will be posted on the board in this common room: no trades or complaints. You will all have a chance to shadow everyone before the holidays. We’ll leave you to it.”
“I’ll grab a Healer.
He was still exhausted, but he threw a glamour at his face before they left to lighten his dark circles and put on a pair of dark jeans and a green button down shirt that he probably stole from Draco, attempting to negate any indications that he was feeling more lost than ever. He just hoped everyone bought it.
“Do you know if Blaise is alright?”
Remus bustled in before Draco can respond. “We’re getting someone new today,” he said, “Kingsley just sent a Patronus.” Well
In the weeks that followed Harry’s sudden return to Black Manor, he was beginning to feel restless, cooped up with nothing to do but plan. His father was happy to make up any excuse necessary to keep Harry safe—he knew he and Hermione and Ron could do with a recharge before going into the Big Battle, but he couldn’t help but feel that their time was running out. Despite this, Harry’s compatriots served as a welcome, yet productive distraction from his malaise.
Getting close to the end of this story--do you want a sequel? What do you want to see happen with the characters after this arc? Let me know, you might inspire a sequel!
“You’re covered in his blood. You’re in the house. You’re not shiny around the edges. You’re
Remus eyed the two teenagers suspiciously. He knew they were sharing a room but to see the two interact like the Marauders used to all the while ignoring Ron and Hermione was more than odd. It seemed as though Harry and Draco screaming at one another leveled their hatred for one another out. Remus wasn't sure how he felt about that.
Harry looked up at him in alarm as if realizing he was there for the first time. “No. Please stay.”
“I can go to the werewolf colony. I’m safer there.”
“Of course. You should definitely get a say in how the world you saved gets shaped, if you’re willing.”
“I dunno how I forgot that you were a transfiguration prodigy with so many people telling me about it through the years,” Harry joked. “That’s brilliant: I have two teacher parents, plus Remus, who is basically my Dad, too. I’ll get the highest marks.”
Draco held him as Harry had another infamous meltdown, knowing he was enabling him and knowing that he’d have to bring it to Dumbledore soon if it didn’t stop, regardless of his feelings towards the Headmaster.
), shut the blinds as soon as they got settled, keeping prying eyes away from the unlikely quad.
As always thank you for reading!
Harry thought for a moment. Should he really lie about what happened? He was terribly embarrassed that he didn’t know the basics surrounding cheering charms, and he didn’t need the world knowing that he was ready to give up after everything that had happened. He nodded. “I think I can work with that one.”
"Sorry about that," he murmured to Remus, eyes firmly rested on the table in front of him.
“Happy to be back?” she asked, sitting adjacent to him at the large, wooden table.
“Which Dad?”
So much self disclosure at once was making Draco's head spin. Soon, though, Remus came to see him. "You're looking much better," he noted, feeling his head. "The fever has tapered off. Excellent."
Harry looked better than he did when he arrived. Though still gaunt with shadows marring his eyes, a shower did him wonders—his hair was gathered in a messy bun atop his head, matching his father’s usual style as of late. He had shaved, making his bone structure stick out even more so than when he arrived and a beard hid his thinness. He looked ill but he no longer looked as wild as the splinched man of only a few hours ago. Draco was both relieved and furious to see him in the kitchen like a ghost of happier days past.
Hermione was looking over in interest now. “What’s part of the Old Ways?” she asked.
Remus rubbed small circles into Harry’s back as he had a mini-breakdown. “You’re so strong. And I’m so proud of you for sticking out therapy like you’ve been. I know how tough it can be.”
Harry rolled his eyes and sighed. “Remus has him?”
Harry looked surprised. “Here?”
“This entire summer has been weird.”
Harry looked at Neville. “It’s complicated.”
Harry grimaced. “I know how that goes. When will you have results?”
Draco closed his eyes and willed back tears. He hated how his pain potion pulled on his emotional side. “I just get so scared when I think about the Manor. As much as I miss Mother, I don’t want her to try and take me back there.”
“And what did you do, Theo?” Draco responded before he could help himself. He viewed James as family and the wolf inside him was responding in rage to his comments. “Oh, that’s right, you took The Mark because you’re a bloody coward.”
“We’re all cousins, Draco, you know that doesn’t make a difference here.”
Harry sunk further into his blankets, not wanting them to see his face. “I’m not feeling well,” he responded, hoping they would chalk up the vocal differences to a cold.
Toward the end of his recovery period, Healer Markus paid him a visit.
Sirius pulled up James to his feet. “Let’s try it then, shall we?”
He was right, as it turned out.
Remus only nodded in response. “You just need to avoid him during the fulls, Draco. Which is what you already do in coming here.”
It didn’t truly hit Draco that he was changed until he found himself deep in the werewolf colony, surrounded by Fenrir’s kin. “I can’t be here,” he said. “I need to leave.”
“Thanks,” Harry said, already eyeing the Dreamless Sleep.
“Hello Father. You usually send the car,” Draco said, covering for his surprise.
Draco just nodded, barely able to contain his laughter. “I thought my father was going to lose it.”
Harry was struck—he tried to keep his emotions at bay. He wasn’t expecting that question from her, generally one for a stiff upper lip. He chose his words carefully as he replied, “I’m doing as best as I can, given the circumstances. Thank you for asking, ma’am.”
how Harry was feeling.
Remus frowned. “I’m really not sure the garden will work for me.”
James grinned at his son. “Well, that’s what you’re here for, right? Plenty of time to figure it out.” He stood, giving Harry’s shoulder a squeeze. “Gotta run, see you later, boys.”
“Hi, Dad,” Harry said, “you’re up early.”
Harry frowned. “Lengthy and invasive. They seemed to figure it out, though. They’re calling in a specialist from America. They’ll be here tomorrow. Apparently they know how to deal with this without making things worse.” Harry seemed distraught at the prospect of being poked and prodded by someone new. “I can’t wait for them to heal my arms, though. They hurt all of the time.”
Harry discreetly threw a cheering charm at himself with a twitch of the hand and braced for a long evening.
“I know what I can and can’t handle.” Nevertheless, Draco was looking worse for wear after fixing Remus up, shaking slightly with sunken eyes.
“You’ll have time for that, I swear. You’re allowed to be happy it’s over and done with—even if you have apologies to make.”
When they stepped back through to the Eighth Year Common Room, Draco pulled him into a hug. “You’re so good with parents,” he said, “even the ones who wanted you dead.”
Blaise frowned. “It’s Harry. You love Harry. It’s okay, I get it.”
Sirius clapped his hands together. “Brilliant. Now let’s strategize.”
Harry just gave a small chuckle. “How was your trip here? Sorry I didn’t say hello before you fell asleep, I was trying to catch up on school work so I don’t completely fail out.”
“I feel like a misfit here,” Draco admitted, looking down in shame.
“You do, though,” James had shown up in the midst of Harry’s crisis, it seemed. He walked up to his son and squeezed his shoulders gently. “You ended it—you saved the world, Haz. You brought peace—Mother Magik is happy.”
Sirius smiled. “Thanks, Molly. I’m sorry too—he was only fifteen after all.”
Sorry for the delay (as per usual). School has resumed.
Harry pulled back. “You’re hurting me.” Sirius released him as though he were stung, a string of apologies on his lips. Harry cut him off, giving him a side hug. “It’s okay—I know it was reactionary.”
Now Harry was beginning to feel attacked on a level deeper than his supposed exhaustion. “Just keep trying to drive that wedge, Zabini.”
He didn’t heed Fenrir’s words and hid out for the first few days, willing his arm to heal. He couldn’t cook with the state of his arm so Fenrir’s beta would bring him food every day. Jack was apparently Fenrir’s biological son, and he was much less broad and had a kinder face. He’d tut at his wound, stressing that Fenrir didn’t need to treat him like a rag doll, but from what Draco gathered, Fenrir was under the Dark Lord’s persuasion as well. Jack would stay and eat with Draco, knowing that while he wasn’t comfortable throwing himself into pack life just yet, he was probably in need of some semblance of company. As the days wore on, Draco began to feel a little more at home, and decided to venture outside.
“Thanks, Remus,” he replied, “couldn’t have done it without you.”
find a Weasley of all people attractive. His time with so many lions must be driving him to insanity. "Let me just grab Remus and we can begin."
Draco sat up quickly and cursed when he felt the tear in his chest. He didn’t care, though. “What are you saying?”
Regulus smiled easily at him in response, making Draco weak in the knees. He seriously needed to reassess his sanity if he was finding distant relatives attractive all of a sudden, especially dead ones. He looked awfully like Harry, green eyes and all. “It’s like a halfway house here, honestly. We’re a bit more alive than dead I swear. ‘Sides no one has come looking for me in ages.” He eyed Draco, recognition shining in his features. “A Malfoy come to visit me? Oh dear what have I done now?”
“You’re probably right.” Draco sighed, rubbing his eyes tiredly. “Sirius was right: this letter thing actually works.” He was less angry at least, however he couldn’t fully shake the sadness of being left behind.
“Where is he, then?” Draco asked. Everyone else seemed to be milling about between the sitting room and kitchen.
“Scout’s honor,” Harry replied, crossing his heart.
Harry sat on Draco’s four-poster in disdain. “It’s not impossible,” he said. “Inconceivable, maybe, but not impossible.”
“Yeah actually. Very popular today. How were the tests?”
“But I haven’t done anything,” Draco tried to explain. “Why must I suffer for his transgressions?”
“He’s going to take over?” Draco asked.
“It’s not funny. I’ve just set myself back for Merlin knows how long.”
“Of course. See you.”
Harry grinned goofily at him. “I like when you do that.”
