To his surprise, Aviary moved across the floor to where Harry was sitting with Ron’s hand still on his arm, and wrapped her arms around the both of them. She wasn’t crying, but she was gripping on to the both of them tightly as she breathed heavily into Harry’s shoulder.
“That, I don't know. But I think you should start using the entrance to Mungos through the street,” Malfoy stated, “If you don't mind? Since you are already there?”
Harry plopped down into one of the chairs Draco had restored to the table, “They have never been certain if they want kids, and they’ve talked about adoption the most,” Harry murmured, “But they have mentioned surrogacy in the past. What if they’re still considering? Now that’s not an option for either of them. Unless…”
Aviary leaned back against the bar, beer grasped in her hand and eyes slightly unfocused, “Harry, sweet Harry,” she began to gesture at the pub-goers in front of her, “If I were to shag one of these fine fellows in this very pub, who shall it be?”
Draco raised his eyebrows and turned back to Aviary. He opened his mouth as if to speak, then stopped. Just like Harry, he seemed to be at a loss of what to say. When he did finally speak, it was with a deliberation that could only come from Draco.
“Did you know your father was a pureblood?” Ron asked, “And I’m not trying to accuse you of anything. I’m just wondering.”
“Harry Potter?” slurred a voice from his side. He tore his eyes away from Malfoy to address Pansy Parkinson, short black hair framing her face in a stylish bob and deep brown eyes wide.
Harry laughed. He was feeling lighter than he had in about a month. Seb was just so easy to talk to. Everything with him felt so easy. It reminded Harry of when he first got together with Ginny, when their conversations flowed so easily and their lives fit together so perfectly.
Ron nodded in agreement, “We can’t risk Malfoy getting hurt. We are breaking the oath we made as Aurors just by involving him. And you.”
She rushed over to her partner's side and looked down at her notes. After a once over, she looked at Ida, “These are the same notes I have. Did you figure out something new?”
“No, this is not important,” she shot up from the floor, “I’ve told you what I needed to. Let the record show that I had to make a special plea to get you here today, because I thought you deserved to know the truth about everything, after how much you helped yesterday. But I see now that we are not on the same page about telling each other important information.”
“Draco, that was never true,” Harry looked him directly in the eyes, “You were the reason for everything. All the things I’ve done for these past months have been about you.”
He had spoken to Padma earlier that day, so he knew Ron and Padma had a late shift that night. Well, most of their nights consisted of entire day long shifts with the aftermath of the hospital attack occupying the focus of Ministry issues. This left Hermione home by herself, as Padma had also told him Hermione had been taking calls from her house the last two days as a way to focus on organizing foreign issues without dealing with constant interruptions. He hoped she could spare time for Harry.
“Well, after a childhood of Celestina Warbeck, it was only a matter of time before I converted to muggle music,” Malfoy shuddered as he looked up at Harry, “I mean, you can only listen to ‘A Cauldron Full Of Hot, Strong Love’ so many times before you lose all faith in humanity.”
Padma rose her eyebrows at him, “Like she would actually give the position to you. I’m her twin. It’s mandatory.”
Both Draco and Harry nodded. Harry opened his mouth to ask another question, when a loud bang sounded behind them. All the Aurors, Draco and Harry whipped around to face the lift with their wands pointed.
Without another word, Draco and Harry made their way side by side to the lift. When they reached it, Harry pressed the button and waited for the doors to open. They shot open only moments later, but not to an empty lift. Ron was standing in the lift with a group of people. He instructed them to leave, then turned frantically to Harry and Draco.
“I...I can’t stay,” Harry stammered, pulling away from the table, “I’m not an Auror. I’m…” he stopped talking as he looked at their alarmed faces, “I need to go!”
“It’s a Harry-Draco situation!” Seamus whispered, “All the fighting and bickering was to cover up an undeniable sexual tension!”
“He is,” Harry whispered back, “Better than I could ever have imagined. I want to be with him, I know that now. But I don’t think it will ever be possible. Maybe this was all foolish. Maybe I should just move on.”
Harry laughed as Al said, “Of course! We all can. He’s the family kite we’re gonna use to blow the rest of neighborhood kids out of the water.”
“How could you?” Ron asked, “When she was pregnant with Rose she told me I’d probably look better if I wasn’t a ginger.”
“It is,” Ron returned a small smile, “Because she helped me to realize that you and Ginny aren’t right for each other anymore. And that’s alright, because you will both always be in each other's lives. And in my life. Things will be different, but that doesn’t matter. What matters is that you two are both happy. If that means that Ginny is with Blaise and you are with Draco, so be it. You both could do a lot worse.”
“An interview,” Draco said simply. His words still held just enough venom from his frustration that the Healer backed up a step, “I am interviewing trainee Potter here on the best way to relieve stress after a long work day.”
That left Harry, Draco, Hermione, Ron, Dean and Seamus at their table. The six of them began talking about which part of dinner was their favorite (Harry was partial to the steak) when a gasp from Draco stopped them.
Harry nodded in agreement, “That’s smart. It would be foolish to get the entire Auror department, and consequently the ministry, involved. We don’t know who we can trust.”
Harry moved to leave, but Hermione grabbed his arm, “There is no way in hell you are leaving. You needed someone to confide in, and it can be me. I know you are dying to tell me who this mystery man is, so you can. I’m here for you.”
“Because he was my competition and the whole school was pitting us against each other!” Harry reasoned.
No. Those thoughts were detrimental right now. He couldn’t waste time wondering if any part of Draco still wanted to be with him. He couldn't even waste time thinking about what all of this meant for their friendship moving forward. What mattered now was protecting Aviary and aiding in stopping Ida and Aries and whoever else was working with them in any way they could.
Malfoy mocked offense, “I knew I shouldn’t have told you. But you asked about pets and I can’t not mention Murr but mention Roger. It wouldn’t be fair.”
Harry laughed. He had a feeling the healer was talking about George, who had brought in Roxy and Fred while his kids and Luna were still in the room. The combination, while highly entertaining, was not the quietest.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow and turned to look at James and Al, who were now fighting quite loudly over whether or not the triple back flip was possible, leading to Al grabbing James’s scarf and running away wildly.
“Okay,” Ida said, moving back towards her papers, “Until then, we find more evidence that points towards Zabini. Even if we use vetrusiam, we need as much proof as we can get to justify our suspicions.”
“You and Draco will be here to help, I hope,” Ron looked Harry straight in the eye, “Harry, I was a fucking wanker last week when you and Ginny told me about the divorce. Or when James told me, to be exact. I freaked out because I never pictured you and Ginny separating. I got super protective and weird about it, especially when I thought you had cheated on her, because she’s my little sister and I couldn’t stand the fact of you hurting her and, by extension, hurting me. It felt like betrayal. But,” he reached over to grab onto Harry’s arm, “I’ve been thinking about it. A lot. And talking to Hermione. A lot.”
Angelina pulled a face at Ginny and countered, “Aviary only liked you more because you were on the Harpies! That proves nothing.”
“Draco,” he said louder than he planned, making Draco jump slightly beside him, “I’m sorry too. For a lot of things, but mainly for…” he trailed off, hoping Draco knew where he was going with this.
“It’s because it wasn’t for quidditch,” Draco declared, “Reyes was shipping Chann to himself! Being a well-renowned quidditch coach of one of the most popular teams in the world is a perfect way to disguise the fact you are destroying the lives of muggles and muggleborns. He and Ida must have been working together for years!”
Then, in typical Seamus fashion, he shook himself and began to cast silence charms around them. He began to speak, much angrier than Harry had anticipated,
He waited impatiently for Malfoy to show up as Lily finally made her way to Rose and Al and the two gave Scorpius a turn with the kite. Sorpius clearly could not have been happier. Harry was watching Scorpius trying to complete the triple back flip stunt when a familiar voice sounded at his shoulder.
Harry stared at his wife. It was all about to tumble out: his unhappiness, his confusion, his emptiness. But the look in Ginny’s eyes stopped him. They looked soft, worried, inviting. He didn’t want her to carry his own sadness.
Harry snorted, “I have someone you could talk to if you want to hear about the tragedy of a straight life. My friend Ron has been complaining steadily for thirty straight years.”
Harry gripped Ida’s hand as she finished talking. He remembered clearly the day Ida had first told him all of this when they had just become partners. Her determination and resilience is what drew him to her and assured him that she would make a fantastic partner. Now, looking over at Aviary, whose eyes were shining softly with tears and admiration, Harry knew Ida would be a source of inspiration for someone else.
“Well, I think Ron would have Ginny murdered if she left the Cannons, so I wouldn’t want that on your conscience if I was you.” Harry replied.
Mateh smiled, “You have to do what you have to do. I’ll be back later, Mr. Potter, before I leave for the day. Let me know if you need anything.”
Darius nodded and said goodbye to the three of them. When he had left, the three sat in silence, all deep in thought.
“You sure as hell won’t,” Ginny heaved a sigh and sat in a chair. Her anger seemed to dissipate as she stared blankly out in front of her. Finally, she turned to Harry and said, “Please don’t turn me into my mother. I don’t want to be the wife and mum that yells whenever anything goes wrong. Just let me know about things, okay? Stop being so distant. We’re a team.”
“Draco traced the poison to the Puddlemere team. Aries is the one who orders in things for the team, so it has to be him. We believe the two are working together,” Harry explained.
Draco held up his wand in an attempt to apparate back, but Harry was too quick for that. He cast an expelliarmus and caught Draco’s wand as it flung itself towards him. Draco huffed angrily and lunged for the wand in Harry’s hand, but Harry cast a shield around him. Ignoring Draco’s loud profanities, Harry concentrated on sending a patronus. Draco, surprisingly, quieted down as Harry gave the patronus directions.
“No, come on in!” Harry smiled. He watched as the kids filed in and gave hugs to their grandma and said hello to Draco. As Lily climbed onto his bed and curled up in a ball beside him, Harry finally began to understand how great life could be.
Ginny nodded and pulled away from Harry, “That’s precisely how I feel. I’ve been telling myself for months that there is no logical reason for me not to be with you, Harry. But lately I’ve realized that we’ve been pulled together for so long that we felt like we were expected to end up together. So while we have both lived most of our lives with the goal of breaking expectations and doing what’s right for us and our family, we have slacked majorly in the relationship department,” she paused, “I think that’s why you quit your job, Harry. You felt the same way we now both feel about our marriage,” she froze and looked up at Harry, “I mean, how I believe we both feel.”
“Anyway,” Draco continued, “While nothing came out of the stakeout, I do have important news. I believe members of Kareach, or one member, planted fake evidence connecting Russians and the pub to Kareach. I should’ve known the letter was far too unlikely to happen.”
“No time for any of this,” Harry grabbed on to one of both Draco’s and Aviary’s arms, “I’ll see you both later,” he said to Ron and Ginny as the three of them were engulfed in the familiar uncomfortable darkness of apparation.
“Harry!” Remmins demanded as Harry moved towards the door, “You can’t leave yet! You know how this works.”
“Blaise was at the hospital the day of the Imperius attacks, because of a quidditch accident,” Harry said in a rush, “And he was in charge of the quidditch match! Now he’s taking charge of security, when he has been in Games and Sports his entire careers. None of it adds up, unless he’s involved in Kareach!”
Harry checked back into reality to find Aviary peering into his eyes. Remmins was still standing at his shoulder, a ghost of a smile now upon his face.
“I’m not about to play favorites, so let’s move on,” Savant declared, as he folded his arms on the desk, “Reyes, I’m sorry to say it, but it’s a trainee or bust.”
“Draco,” Ron said now, his voice filled with a desperate urgency, “I need to be honest. I told Harry not that long ago that I wanted you off this case. I also told Harry that it was nothing personal, and while I believed that myself, the truth is I was still very weary of you. Despite what Harry has told us. But the way you came to the aid of so many muggleborns tonight, including Hermione, proves that you are the person Harry told me you are. I’m so sorry, Draco. We need all the help from you that we can get.”
The door swung open, revealing a clearly exhausted Draco. He was still dressed in the clothes he had worn to the quidditch match, which were now tattered and dirty. This was the first time Harry had ever seen Draco in anything that wasn’t spotless and somehow gleaming (he hadn’t known clothes could gleam until he met Draco). When Draco realized who it was, he shook his head and began to shut the door.
Sure enough, the newspaper on Brayan’s desk was of the interview Harry had done with Malfoy two weeks prior. To his surprise, the picture above the article wasn’t the usual cheesy affair that Harry associated with fuller Prophet articles. The picture had been taken of Harry smiling on his first day of training. He looked eager and happy, and not in an over exaggerated way. It had been taken by Hermione and Harry had submitted it to the Prophet, but he had been doubtful Malfoy would opt for the nice and put-together picture of him when he could only imagine how many pictures Brayan had submitted of he and Harry where Harry either looked exhausted or like he was overtly faking his smile. Apparently Malfoy wanted to give his article a level of sophistication, and Harry appreciated that.
Harry looked to Ron as he gave a soft smile and a “Oh, I know” in agreement. Padma was right; Ron really did love his job. He always had. It’s partly what made Harry realize he didn’t love his.
Moments later, two desks appeared in front of him. Ron was nowhere to be seen, but Padma was sitting at hers, scribbling furiously on a piece of parchment.
“Right, and get the Head of International Magical Cooperation involved,” Draco snorted, “That would go smoothly.”
Unfortunately, Draco wasn’t picking up. He couldn't blame him; it was Christmas Eve, he was probably with his kid and family. Harry suddenly felt very alone and confused.
“No, not at all,” Harry assured, “Healer Patrick asked for my help for the day, and I can’t pass that up. Not when I want to work in her department.”
“Harry…” she trailed off as she noticed his sudden anger, “Don’t be mad! We have no proof to believe these rumors!”
“A genius plan indeed,” Harry agreed, “Al has been thoroughly distracted since birth, what with Rose being his same age. Now he has Scorp as well. The three basically raise each other.”
Harry startled as something rammed into the back of his legs. Having an idea he knew exactly what it was, he turned around to face none other than Lacey Finnigan-Thomas.
Harry would have laughed if the situation they were in wasn’t so tragic. He grabbed Aviary’s hand and walked towards the first set of stairs outside of the entrance hall. Draco trailed as Harry led them to the very first room he had visited the first time he came to Grimmauld Place years ago. It was the room he and Ron slept in when he stayed here the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts.
Ginny was still at practice (they were running longer and longer as they neared the tournament, which was now officially pitting the Cannons against Puddlemere United), and his kids were at Molly and Arthur’s for the evening. This left Harry plenty of time to crash whatever plans Draco had for the evening (which no doubt already involved Kareach) and ask him to take Harry back as his ally in eradicating Dark organizations. Now, Harry thought, that was a sentence he’d never could have imagined being anything but a ridiculous joke. Telling himself to focus, he grabbed a handful of floo powder and used his wand hand to light a fire. He then threw the powder into the fireplace and shouted ‘Draco’s apartment!” He stuck his head in and watched as a living area formed around him.
“Harry! You’re still here!” she said as she slid half of her enormous stack of papers into his awaiting arms, “Ron and I just got back. He is going to be delighted to see you.”
Draco stared at him angrily for a few painful seconds, mouth agape. Harry was only looking at him out of the corner of his eye. The guilt of his last words was already washing over him.
“We heard the nurses talking, mum,” Al said, “We know that Ida tried to kill dad but then Draco tried to save him.”
Rachel signed, relieved to see that Harry wasn’t angry about her almost question. She hesitated, then said, “But you were so good! You were on your way to becoming Head Auror! I mean, Kingsley adores you.” Her words came out in a rush.
“I actually considered being a professional quidditch player before this,” Aviary continued, “But I think I made the right choice.”
“Draco?” Harry said softly, picking up a paper that seemed to be almost entirely in a foreign language, “Have you slept in the past three weeks?”
The girls all laughed at this. “He’s playing!” Aviary exclaimed. She grabbed his arm and pointed with her beer hand around the room, “If fake Zabini isn’t your first choice, then who is?”
Harry laughed at this and pointed at the book still across Seb’s lab. “‘Quidditch Through the Ages’?” he asked, “That is perhaps still one of my favorite books to read. I used to read it all the time during the summer while I was missing Hogwarts.”
Harry felt numb, Ida’s words swirling around in his head. He had always taken Ida’s advice and opinions without a doubt, but this time he felt she was, well, wrong. Draco had done many terrible things in his past, but Harry could now understand the position he was in. Draco had been scared of dying, of losing his family. Voldemort wouldn’t have hesitated to kill him or his parents if any of their assignments had gone wrong. Harry had just seen the regret in Draco’s eyes; he had heard them in his words. Draco was smart, courageous, caring. He wanted to take down the Imperious attackers and seemed to be doing more than any of the Aurors were. None of that added up to Draco trying to win Harry’s friendship for the fame, the redemption. In Harry’s eyes, he had already redeemed himself.
Harry looked at her surprise, “We will, won’t we? Isn’t that the whole point? That we have always been better as friends.”
Sure enough, a moment later, the gap between Number 11 and Number 13 began to widen. Draco and Aviary looked on in amazement as Number 12 Grimmauld Place appeared before them. Harry gripped both of their arms and led them into the house quickly.
“Well, the Ministry is, of course, trying to find the best possible security against more attacks. After the hospital attack and the quidditch attack, the Department of Security has received a lot of backlash. Apparently, they ignored many of Blaise’s suggestions that could have helped prevent the attack, leading many to think the Department of Security is lacking strong leadership. They have promoted Blaise to head of the department temporarily while Seamus runs the Department of Games and Sports. So far, it seems Blaise is doing a great job. And he volunteered for it and everything! The courage is admirable, I have to say.”
Harry nodded in what he hoped was a reassuring manner as Lily ran at his knees to wrap herself around him. He feebly tried to think of an excuse for why he was home so early when three of the four people he least wanted to see at the moment apparated into the kitchen.
“Good luck, mate,” Dean said, looking wearily at Malfoy, who was now pacing in front of the midair menu.
“I can’t believe him!” Ginny cried later that night, “My own brother! This is our choice to make, not his. He has no right to tell us we ruined our family.”
“You better,” Neville mumbled beside him, “The last person Luna told me was untrustworthy was Hannah’s brother, and she ended up being very correct.”
“Grab her,” Harry told James, who had already moved to stop his sister from escaping. Turning back towards the stairs, he yelled up at Albus once again, “We are leaving, Al!”
Harry looked at Ron. He didn’t know how to explain to Hermione that her baby, the one she was already carrying, was most likely in mortal danger.
“He did that?” Hermione whispered sadly, “I can’t believe him. You are right, Ginny. You two have the right to make the decision that works best for your family. Families come in so many different forms. Not staying together when you are both unhappy is the happiest decision you could make.”
Harry had choked a little on his tea at Seb’s mention of LGBTQ rights. The topic was a little too close to home at the moment.
“My dad should be here in a minute,” Scorpius confirmed, trying to stay engaged in his conversation with Harry while simultaneously watching the kite with rapt interest, “He left his favorite scarf at home and had to apparate back to get it.”
Malfoy looked at him with an expression Harry recognized as a mixture of excitement and worry. It was one he wore frequently.
Harry had spent all of the past two days at the hospital, working tirelessly to aid the Healers in the recovery of Muggles from the mysterious potion used by the Imperius attackers. Another attack had happened at a sports shop in the Greater London area. The attack had occurred only two weeks after the attack at the muggle shop in Yorkshire. Harry had been immersed in the consequences fully, as the scope of the attack meant the entire faculty of St. Mungo’s was instructed to help, including the trainees. He spent the entire weekend following rapid orders from Healers. Five Muggles did not recover from the poison, and over one hundred were infected and brought into Mungos. After coming home last night, despite his all-consuming exhaustion, Harry had called Ron, Padma and Ida to find out how they were holding up and whether they were any closer on leads. Technically, Harry knew it was not a wise decision to be calling the department's top Aurors looking for information on an open case, but Harry was desperate. He felt a large amount of guilt. Harry had left the Auror department while the Imperius attacks were still underway. Even though it had seemed the attacks were ending, Harry should have known better. Things like this never just disappear. Harry was part of the team working to stop the attacks that threatened Muggles and Muggleborns alike. It was irresponsible of him to leave before the case was solved. He was leaving Ron, Padma, Ida and the rest of Aurors a near impossible and dangerous case. Although he had no doubt they were the best team to bring justice to the attacks, Harry still felt like leaving to become a Healer was a reckless decision.
“I’m sorry!” Harry nearly shouted, his anger rising, “I overreacted! But you cannot sit here and tell me you don’t want me to be a part of this investigation! You know I care, Draco. I was just being a prat for one day.”
To his surprise, Draco didn’t look angry. He just looked sad. Harry watched as he sat down on a large beam and put his face in his hands.
“Oh, Padma!” Harry cried. Padma’s cousin Rana worked at the hospital as a healer. He wrapped Padma in another hug. She began to shake as she cried softly into his shoulder. In the twenty plus years he had known her, he had only seen her cry twice. Padma was never someone who led with her emotions, especially while on the job. He remembered all the stories she had told of her cousin and he felt guilt streaming through him. He could have done more.
Harry and James held back laughter as Louis turned back to his potatoes. A few more minutes passed with Fleur talking about Dom’s quidditch aspirations. When Fleur paused to get a drink of water, Molly quickly took advantage, “It’s a pity Ron and Hermione couldn’t be here today, isn’t it?” she interjected.
Harry didn’t want to answer, because that would entail explaining about how the only way Ron would still be this fearful was if Hermione was pregnant at the moment of the attack. Both he and Ron sat in a gruesome silence until Hermione huffed impatiently.
“Goodnight, Molly,” Harry wrapped his arms around her as she and Arthur prepared to leave. It was well past midnight and the last of the Christmas Eve party goers had left. Molly, Arthur, Ron and Hermione had stayed late, as usual, to talk with Harry and Ginny into the night while their kids laid passed out in various beds and sofas throughout the house. The conversation had been a bit heavier than usual, what with the unexpected shift in Dean and Seamus’s behavior. The two hadn’t told everybody about the news they had received at the hands of Harry and Draco, but everyone knew something horrible had happened. Although the topic had been skirted around, Harry could tell his friends and family were dying to ask about what had caused Harry to leave the party so abruptly and why he had to have a talk with Dean and Seamus that left them in tears. Harry knew Dean, Seamus and Ron wouldn’t be telling anyone soon, unless a situation like the one he had with them arose. Harry trusted them to understand how crucial it was to keep the identity of Chann under wraps, even from their closest friends and family.
Angelina, thankfully noticing Lily was on the verge of tears, quickly said, “Lily, I am going to need a co-spinner,” lowering her voice to a whisper, she continued, “and my cospinner gets to eat cookies after dinner.”
“Fine by me!” Harry responded. He threw the floo powder down as his feet and disappeared into the flames, watching as Ron’s livid face whirled out of sight.
“That’s not true!” Hermione exclaimed, “Barty Crouch Sr. knew more! He’s making me look bad as one of my predecessors!”
“Oh, ha ha, Malfoy,” Harry said, turning to face him, “You should be thanking me, really. My kids are bloody fantastic.”
Harry stared at her, speechless. Was Ginny giving him the same talk he had been planning to give her?
Aviary huffed, “I have to be there. This is Gani we are talking about. There’s nothing I wouldn’t do for him!”
“I’ve been instructed to have all Aurors leave the building, Ms. Bloom,” Harry said, as professionally as he could, “I’m sorry, but I don’t have any authority to go against direct instructions from the Aurors.”
Ginny shook her head, “I can’t believe this. All this time I’m pining after Blaise, worried of what my family will think, when you were developing a crush on Draco Malfoy!”
Seamus, who was bending down next to him, moved so he was sitting on the floor beside Harry, “Ginny asked me to help bring the kids home, so I did. She’s upstairs with them right now, passed out with all of them on the bed.”
Throwing more floo powder in, he announced his next location( “Ministry of Magic, Ron and Padma’s office”) before sticking his head back in the fire.
Just then, the phone booth reached the atrium of the Ministry. The doors opened and Harry followed Remmins as he made his way to the lift. Harry tried to ask more questions as they waited for the lift to reach the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. Harry abruptly stopped talking when he saw the state of level two.
“If you think you two aren’t in this for the long haul, you’re insane,” Hermione said, smirking, “I saw Draco just this morning, leaving from your room. I have never seen a Malfoy look that happy in my life.”
He was saved from that thought when a sudden flash of light stole his attention from Dean and Seamus. To his utter surprise, Draco was standing in front of him, wearing a snowman sweater and a crown from a Christmas cracker on his head.
Harry opened his mouth but Ginny held up her hand, “I need to talk. I don’t want Christmas Eve to become a battle of words and accusations. What I did, Harry, was wrong. Extremely wrong. I should have never cheated, regardless of the state of our relationship and feelings for each other. I do think you have a ton of explaining to do and that you are not clear of blame, but I do completely apologize for what I did. I want you to know that I’m terrified. But I know we can still figure this out together. Maybe this is all a bit much to say now, but I know we can figure out a way to live separately peacefully and without relationships with our kids falling apart. You mean so much to me, Harry, and you always will. As for you being queer… “ she paused.
Harry slid the scones he had spent the past hour making into the oven. He stared at the door of the oven, not allowing himself to move because he knew that as soon as he did, he would be forced to deal with his thoughts. Honestly, Harry had had enough of dealing with his thoughts to last a lifetime.
“I mean,” he continued, “I’ve been around death my entire career. It’s not like after the war the possibility of losing my loved ones just disappeared. It has just… been so long since I’ve truly had to come face to face with the possibility that I could lose more people I love. Or that they could lose me.”
“Of course I am,” Draco shook his head, “You are an incredibly annoying person to work with. But you’re all I’ve got.”
“My thoughts precisely,” Blaise agreed, “But I’m rather happy he decided to hit me. Because immediately after, he lost his balance, as no doubt he wasn’t used to making good shots, and fell and broke his arm.”
Harry thought about what Malfoy was trying to do. He wanted to essentially take down an entire organization of potentially Imperius attack starting nutters who hated nothing more than muggles, muggleborns and blood traitors. And as Harry looked at Malfoy, he started to think Malfoy was definitely not a part of the pureblood status any longer. For starters, he was now investigating a group that was rumored to hold a Voldemort-esque ideology, something Harry believed Malfoy had full faith in until only a few weeks ago. But it was also the little things Malfoy did, from his distinctively muggle clothes (he was wearing a pale blue jumper and jeans today) to his muggle phone and trips to muggle parks. He was a major threat to the mysterious Kareach. Even if Kareach wasn’t real, Harry still couldn’t shake the feeling that Malfoy was on to something dangerous and nearly impossible. His unavoidable streak of heroism was returning; he couldn’t let Malfoy investigate Kareach alone.
He rummaged around in his bag until he felt the hard metal of his phone in the palm of his hand. Harry reluctantly turned it around and nearly tossed it back onto the bed when he saw ‘Draco’ was flashing across the screen. Every fiber in his body was telling him that answering the phone for Draco would be a bad thing for his mental health, but the unhelpful and disloyal logical part of his brain reminded him that Draco would only be calling if it were crucial.
He fired another spell at Draco. Harry watched as one of the gashes grew deeper, his entire body on fire as anger attempted to burst out of him.
“I’m really starting to feel she likes you two more than us,” Seamus commented, appearing behind his husband.
“I can’t argue with that,” Harry agreed, watching as the ferret rolled over onto his back with his little paws up in the air and an imploring look in Harry’s direction, “This is about the most well behaved animal I have ever encountered. And I’ve meant numerous Animagi.”
“Excuse me?” Healer Patrick had appeared in the hallway, “We can not have this type of scene in a hospital! I’m going to have you leave, Mrs. Potter- Weasley.”
“Ida, please listen…” he started as she walked towards the door, collecting her papers with her wand as she went.
“That sounds nice,” Al said thoughtfully, using his fork now to eat his eggs, “I would like some therapy.”
Sure enough, a masked figure appeared in front of Harry and Draco, wand pointed at Draco’s face. Harry acted quickly, years of Auror training paying off, “Stupefy!” Harry shouted at the masked figure. They collapsed, and Harry moved into action, using his extreme knowledge of shield charms to build a barrier around him and Draco. The green lights began to bounce off an invisible barrier.
Harry shook his head, “No. I stopped there because… Draco and I kissed and then he acted like it was a mistake and I wanted to tell him I had feelings for him. And then he rejected me again and now I feel bad that I was there at all and I also feel bad that my main priority isn’t the attacks or seeing my family but I still want him, which is the worst part.”
“I’m your cousin too, Rose,” James pointed out, his arms crossed. He said this bitterly, which surprised Harry. He had never known James to be upset about Rose and Albus’s close relationship. James had so many cousins and friends that he never was lonely. Harry felt guilty; he knew this reaction was only due to James’s anger at the divorce.
Draco opened the door and waved his arm towards the hallway, “So, if you don’t mind, I would like some sleep.”
“Ready, you two?” George said, arm around his wife, “Or should we wait another ten minutes while you go and snog behind the broom shed?”
“That’s a fine choice,” Harry said reluctantly, “But I would have to say Zabini himself is far better looking.”
Dean turned around at this statement, “And you are all talking about me, I suppose? The man married to you?”
“Ha!” Ginny shouted, turning to Angelina. Ginny played for the Holyhead Harpies before she became the coach of the Cannons. As Angelina had always played for Puddlemere since she left Hogwarts, the two maintained a friendly rivalry over whose team was superior. And sometimes “friendly” was too kind of a term; both women were quite competitive.
Sure enough, moments later Aviary walked through. She looked someone even more exhausted than her boss, exhibited by her tangled blonde hair falling out of a messy ponytail and the large bags under her eyes.
He looked back at his wife. He was surprised at her sudden loss of anger, but that was the least strangest thing to happen in this conversation. She looked tired but relieved, a relieved look he realized that he hadn’t seen on her in years. Ginny always looked like she was holding back a secret tension. Now she looked free, unburdened.
Draco moved his head to the side to swing his hair out of his eyes, “A success. My guess is Aries is already there. If this works out the way we think it will, Ida should be at the pitch any minute now.”
“Harry, you ask that every bloody time. You know very well I am capable of watching my grandchildren,” Molly declared.
“Of course, Harry dear,” Lacey said, returning his smile, “Just don’t go telling all the other trainees. They wouldn’t leave me alone until I gave them another pot pie.”
“I know it’s hard,” Harry looked up into Draco’s eyes, intense and dark with an anger Harry hadn’t seen in him in a long time, “But we need to focus on stopping this.”
Seb pointed his chin up in a regal manner to fake his offense. This lasted for a second before his face broke out in a full grin that reached his eyes. Harry’s heart sped up slightly; he always seemed to forget the infectiousness of Seb’s smile. Which reminded him of Draco’s smile. There was no escape.
“Sir, Harry and I have crucial news to the Imperius case,” without asking, she stepped past Savant and into the room so she could set down all of her papers on his desk after clearing off his own things with her wand.
Harry thought it would be safe enough to ask what house Scorpius’s mother had been in when she was at Hogwarts, but before he could, Malfoy walked back into the room.
“It’s true, mate,” Remmins said solemnly, “We think it’s just people with a vendetta against muggles and muggleborns that are following out the once widespread beliefs of Voldemort.”
“There’s something else…” Ginny narrowed her eyes. Suddenly she let out a loud gasp, “Wait a moment… it all makes sense!
Padma wasted no time, “The bug, it worked. Ida and the entirety of Kareach are coming to the Ministry in less than an hour! Meet Ron at the phone booth as soon as possible.”
“Wolfsbane?” Harry said aloud, realizing exactly who Healer Patrick had an interview with. Trying to ignore the fact Malfoy was once again in the building, he opened the door and walked into Seb’s room, where he resumed his reading of a book, which Harry now realized was ‘Quidditch Through the Ages’.
“Nothing!” Harry burst, shoving his way between Ida and Seamus and towards the front door of the house.
Harry could see the passion sparking a fire in Seb’s eyes. He felt a surge of pride to have made a friend who was so able to take matters into his own hands. He wished he was more like that.
Ida and Harry exchanged a look and began to explain everything they knew about Blaise and how he could be involved with the attacks. When they finished sharing their theory about why Blaise was now head of security, the room felt eerily quiet. Then Aviary spoke, softly:
“Thanks, Rachel,” Harry said, smiling at her so she would know he wasn’t about to tell Ron she thought he was a poor Auror, “I’ll miss you too.”
Harry gritted his teeth, “You’re not serious? That’s it? A lapse of judgement? I didn’t get the kiss I’ve been waiting for just for you to tell me it was nothing but a mistake!”
Brayan told Harry to tell him if any more interviewers came around, as he had plenty more to say, and then gestured for Harry to sit down. Harry tried his best to ignore the not so subtle glare from a raven-haired girl he believed was named Sally as he passed her to get to his chair and take a seat. The young man next to him, whose name was Caser, whispered to Harry, “I liked your article. That’s exactly how I feel about healing, too. It’s the perfect job for someone who loves to help people but needs a break from the Dark Arts.”
Too soon, Draco pulled away, his face blossoming with red and his eyes filled with heavy lust. Harry tried to ignore the fire in his skin as he straightened his shirt and stared ahead.
Ida looked impatient, “Because you need experiences with people other than the woman you’ve been with for most of your life! How are you to know anything about who you are if you have barely begun making your own choices?!”
Harry was nursing a beer at the bar, watching the patrons around him mingle, laugh and dance. Maybe going to the bar alone wasn’t his brightest idea. Harry had never really gone alone in the past; Ron, Hermione and Ginny used to go out together all the time before they had kids. Without anyone to talk to, he was stuck with his own thoughts in a new atmosphere. He wasn’t even much of a drinker. He had been at the Leaky for almost an hour and he had just gotten about half way through his first beer. Sighing, Harry sat his beer down and wondered if he should just leave and go back home to Ginny and Lily. Harry reached into his pocket to grab a galleon when he felt a hand on his shoulder as someone lowered themselves into the empty chair next to him.
That is what he attempted to tell Aviary after he told her everything he knew about Brayan during his statement.
“Exactly!” Harry exclaimed, “That’s why you need us! Voldemort wasn’t fought by just Aurors, now was he!”
“Pulled off the green and red look? I sure hope so,” Seb said, “This hospital has too many attractive healers for me to look bad while I’m half-dead with dragon pox.”
“This,” Seamus continued, “Is exactly what the holidays are about. My family, who makes me feel safe and welcome every day of my life. About my husband, the love of my life. When Dean had…” he caught Molly’s disapproving eye, “...his health scare, it made us realize there is no time to waste. There has been something we have wanted to try for a long time, but we always found excuses as to why now isn’t the right time. What we’ve both realized lately is that there will never be a better time than now. So, Dean and I have decided to try surrogacy!”
“Well, anyway,” Seamus interrupted, as Padma looked like she was about to come back with a retort for what Parvati claimed, “My gossip is about Blaise, and it’s good. Apparently, Terry Boot believes Malfoy and Blaise shagged while they were still at Hogwarts!”
Harry nodded and followed Molly into the kitchen. Lily, Albus and James were sitting side by side at the table, all eating the largest slices of apple pie Harry had ever seen.
Draco sat up and pulled out a stack of papers covered with notes. “I took these all while on that trip to Cambodia,” he explained. He began to look urgently though the stack, stopping abruptly when he found one with a large diagram drawn on it.
“Harry,” Aviary said gently, “I know it’s hard to accept, but we’ve had a real breakthrough. We have proof that Brayan is behind all of this. It’s time to move on with your life. Maybe focus on your…” she hesitated and looked awkwardly to the side.
“Save it! How could you accuse Blaise! Haven’t you met the man? He is the least likely person to do something like this! What was this, a way to get back at me and Draco in one foul swoop?” Ginny screamed.
Harry laughed, “None taken. Everything looks good Blaise, but I can’t clear you to leave, as I’m only a trainee.”
Draco was being placed on the board across from him. Harry tried desperately to move, to shout, to do anything, but once again, nothing happened. Draco must have also been hit with the Petrificus Totalus charm, as his arms and legs were pointed stiffly downwards like Harry’s. His face was the worst sight to see. He must have been hit by some sort of gashing spell, because a large chunk of skin was peeled away from his right eye. Blood coated a large portion of his face, covering his nose, mouth, and one of his eyes. Despite all this, his features remained frozen and expressionless. Heat flooded Harry’s body and he focused every ounce of his attention on moving. He needed to fight this curse, get up and take Draco away. Harry was forced to watch helplessly as blood gathered on Draco’s collar, contrasting his soft blue shirt in a stark and heart shattering way.
“Because I can’t trust you!” Draco exclaimed, “Minutes ago, I tried to kiss you and you pushed me away! You’ve already gotten bored of me. I’m just going to be another one of your projects to keep you entertained while you work through this little mid-life crisis of yours!”
“Oi, watch where you throw that!” she shouted angrily, throwing one of her own chips square at his forehead. The man screamed with delight and began running wildly around the pub yelling “I’ve been compromised!”
So Harry floo-ed into the Weasley-Granger living room, not knowing quite what to expect. Only Rose was in the room, coloring a picture on the floor.
“Many,” Reyes looked pointedly at Harry, “Your wife is a stubborn, tactless woman who should not be allowed to coach quidditch.”
Harry opened his eyes to the bright lights of a hospital room at St. Mungos. As he gathered his bearings, he saw all three of his kids; Lily grasping his arm beside the bed and Al and James sitting on the end of it. Ginny was right behind Lily, smiling down at him.
“Here!” Ida’s voice rang out briskly as she appeared behind Harry with a large plate of scones in her hand.
“Our poor girl!” Savant spoke, “She needs to get her rest. Thanks for letting us know her whereabouts, Potter.”
“Sweetheart, don’t ever think I could hate you,” Molly said as she pulled away, “Not for this, not for the divorce. Of course I am sad that you and Ginny will no longer be together, but I understand that not all couples can last forever. You both need something different, and it sounds as if you have come to that understanding together. Both of you will always have me, my sweet Harry.”
Harry thanked Merlin for the heating charms as he sat down in his section of the bleachers. The early January air had stung his face as he walked with James, Al and Lily down to the quidditch pitch. The pitch had been set up months in advance by Blaise, Seamus and the rest of the Department of Games and Sports in the middle of a large abandoned field. Harry had used a designated portkey, just as he had many years ago for the quidditch world cup, to transport his family to the field located in the region of Cotswald.  The walk from the portkey (a large bucket this time) to the pitch, albeit short, left Harry, his kids and the multiple other families who had taken the same portkey shivering and numb in the fingers and toes. As a result, the cozy warmth charmed throughout the seats surrounding the pitch was highly appreciated. Without them, there was no way Harry could withstand the cold or the consistent whining that would inevitably come from his three kids. As Harry situated Lily into her seat beside him and watched as James and Al ran up and down their row, he couldn’t help but realize this is how all his moments with his kids would be like from now on. Just him and the three of them, no Ginny. This thought made Harry feel empty. Was he doing the right thing, getting a divorce? Giving up the family he had created? Harry knew these doubts were pointless; Ginny wanted the same thing. There was no going back. And he wasn’t happy. He knew that. Logically. But the illogical part of him still wanted to do everything he could to protect his children.
“What things?” Harry asked, his pulse increasing unnervingly, as if it was jumping through his skin like electricity.
“I’ll make sure of it,” Harry said to his son, trying to make himself feel better by thinking about how much his kids loved going to their grandparents’ house.
“Nev and I are beyond excited for the match!” Hannah chimed in, “Quidditch has been more popular than ever this year. I have to ask, Seamus, how on earth your department is handling the set-up?”
“What’s therapy?” Albus asked as he grinned at Lily and flung a bit of scrambled eggs on her plate using his fork.
Ida reached for his arm, “I know, Harry. He is, well was, a well respected healer. He donated to all kinds of charities. He was a teacher that showed nothing but kindness to the trainees. None of it makes sense, and that’s the point. He had the perfect disguise. That’s what got me thinking: the last time I talked to him, after the St. Mungos attack, he was so polite. Too polite, almost. He had so many questions about you, Harry. About whether or not you were still well connected to the Auror department. At the time, he passed it off making conversation. But the more I considered it overtime, the stranger it seemed that he would be so curious about your relationship with the Aurors after his hospital had lost twenty people from an attack. I thought about that yesterday, after Blaise didn’t work out. Brayan reminded me of Blaise, because he was a well respected and likeable man who was at both the hospital and quidditch stadium during the respective attacks. Not to mention he would have a much better access to poison as a healer than Blaise would as the head of Games and Sports. That’s when I remembered something- we saw Brayan in Diagon Alley after one of the first attacks. He was in the Owl Emporium, hiding behind some barrels. Do you remember?”
“Ron and Padma,” Harry stated, “Those are the Aurors we need to tell. I trust both of them with my life, and they are already partners so they are great at working together. Not that I don’t trust Ida, Aviary or Remmins, but I think two people is the perfect amount.”
Harry reached over to ruffle his hair. He was relieved James would still let him do this, he had been anticipating the day James ducked away and gave him an embarrassed look for a long time.
“No!” Harry snapped, trying not to raise his voice but failing, “He’s integral to all of this. You both would be nowhere without him! The notion of not involving him is ridiculous.”
“We need to buckle down and find what this poison is,” Draco declared, sliding half of his pile effortlessly into Harry’s lap.
“When my mother told stories about atrocious pure blood families, she always talked about the Reyes,” Ginny explained softly, “Remember, Ron? She would talk about how the Reyes, both the ones living in England and the ones still in the Philippines, have worked to erase this reputation as a ‘corrupt’ pure blood family and how she believed that they only did this to disguise the fact that they were still actively working against muggleborns and muggles. She told me to be wary of old pureblood families in general, because this hatred ran deep. The thing is, I didn’t think anything of Ida being a part of the Reyes family. I mean, think of Tonks and Sirius. Your family doesn’t determine who you are. But something about Ida always seemed… off.”
“They must have mistaken me for some other blonde bloke you’ve been snogging,” Draco joked, “There’s no way they want me to be your boyfriend.”
Angelina rolled her eyes. “I’ll tell Ron to bugger off. Ginny is the best coach the UK leagues have seen in a long time.”
“Yes,” Harry answered, “It was the childhood home of Sirius Black, so as the only remaining Black who had lived here, he knew the location of the house.”
So as Hermione pulled away and moved to hug Fleur, Harry purposefully did not acknowledge Ron, who was standing directly behind her, and began talking to Teddy and Victore about Hogwarts. Christmas had been the usual Weasley chaos, leaving Harry with little chance to learn about how Victore and Teddy were adjusting to their first year as Hogwarts students. The two were beyond excited to talk about their new school and the things they had learned, allowing Harry to easily slip into a conversation that had nothing to do with the attacks or relationships or sexuality. As he talked with Victore and Teddy, more people began to show up and full up their row. Molly and Arthur arrived first, followed by George and his kids, Dean, Seamus, Luna, Neville and Hannah. Harry excused himself from the conversation to go talk to Dean and Seamus after they arrived to see how they were doing. The two seemed unexpectedly happy.
Despite his ongoing panicky thoughts, Harry managed to get into the match. Both teams were fascinating to watch. When one of Ginny’s chasers swung from her broom and managed to hit the quaffle in as the Puddlemere beaters aimed the bludger at her, Harry was so impressed that he temporarily forgot to look at Draco. He appreciated his kids' company for the further distraction. Listening to Rose and Al fight over the match was both hilarious and highly entertaining.
By the look Draco gave him, he knew that Harry was only trying to distract him, but he obliged anyway, standing up and following Harry to the dance floor.
“Aviary, it was never personal,” Harry explained, “We didn’t want to involve any Aurors, really, because we thought it would be too risky. We only involved Ron and Padma because we needed to.”
“With all due respect, sir,” Harry said, walking in to stand besides Ida, “This is much more important than your carpet.”
Harry hesitated, then continued, “I don’t think we should breeze past this,” he rambled, “We should at least talk about this plate!” he grabbed the plate with him on it, “And the mug!” he pointed at Draco’s hand that still held the mug with the park scene.
“Well, I think she believes part of her job is to keep the patient happy,” Seb said thoughtfully, “So while she moves at the speed of light to finish all of her rounds, she still makes time to adhere to all her patients needs, which includes cheering them up.”
Out of the corner of his eye, Harry saw a flash of black. Someone was moving behind him. A moment later, the black silhouette began moving forward. From the back, he recognized the completely black clothed figure as a Kareach member. They were still wearing their mask, so as they turned around to face Harry, he couldn’t identify who it was. To his surprise, the figure gave a hearty laugh and bent down to pick up something else from the floor. Harry’s heart sunk when he realized what the figure was picking up.
“I worked with Ida for years and years and I never guessed any of this!” he pulled himself away from Ginny and went to stand over Ida, who was still lying stiff as a board, “I should have known!” he yelled down at her.
Ron took a deep breath, “Alright. The plan is to evacuate the entire building before Kareach gets here. Padma and Savant are with Ida in Savant’s office right now. They cast a bunch of charms that prevent her from leaving or contacting anyone from within the room. That shouldn’t hold her permanently, but as of right now she suspects nothing, so we should have some time. As they work in there, the rest of the Aurors and you all can help get anyone who is left in the building out safely.”
Deciding to forget all about the fact that they technically weren’t on speaking terms, Harry threw his arms around Ron. He guessed that the whole Auror department was in panic mode, and that Ron hadn’t stopped to grief since he received the news. Or saw the news. Harry still had no idea what had happened.
Harry pulled a face at his son and watched as he left the room laughing. The kid had Ginny’s sense of humor through and through.
“I don’t need supervision,” Al snapped as James moved to grab his hand and then Lily’s. Harry, Ginny and the rest said goodnight to his kids, watching as they made their way upstairs and out of sight.
“Wait, Potter,” he hesitated as Ida looked at him concernedly, then continued, “Dover deserves to know about what happened with the investigation.”
Harry smiled and laughed softly, “Seb, you are an amazing friend. Thank you for saying that, truly. I’ll take you up on the offer. Just not today.”
“Go cannons!” Brayan exclaimed as he clapped Harry on the back and then left to go back to his seat.
Ginny came out minutes later in the all black outfit she wore under her quidditch robes. She raised her eyebrows at Harry when she spotted him waiting on the bed.
Harry felt himself shaking violently. Draco was going to die. He had come so close today, it was only a matter of time.
Harry sighed, “Because I thought he did it, James. I swear. Much of my evidence pointed to that. Believe me, I didn’t want to accuse him. Blaise is a good bloke.”
“Harry, calm down,” Padma instructed, “First of all, no one told you because you are not an Auror. You can’t be upset with us for not telling you everything that happens…”
Despite herself, Aviary giggled, “As long as we’re together, I don’t see what the problem is. I am never going to stop loving you, Seb Haffer.”
They were heading to Seamus and Dean’s house, a large flat in London. About once a month or so, Seamus and Dean held a little get together at their house for drinks and appetizers (the appetizers being mainly for Ron: most of the guests came from lunch at the Burrow and only Ron could be hungry after that). It was a tradition Harry was quite fond of. No one knew how to have a good time like Dean and Seamus. It was also a great excuse to have a kid-free evening where he saw many of his closest friends.
This rhythm of patient after patient continued. Harry poured everything he had learned from his healing training and his long talks with Draco to revive every patient put in front of him. With Draco beside him casting the same spells he felt invincible. After he finished helping a short man with long black hair, he turned to help another patient, but no one was there. He looked around and realized that every victim was either being assisted by a healer or had been taken to an actual hospital room.
Harry looked down at the floor, “It doesn’t matter. I shouldn’t have focused so much on him, and what my new identity meant in light of him. This…” he gestured at himself, “Mess of a person is my own thing, not Ginny’s or Draco’s or anyone’s.”
Seb turned around now to see what Harry was staring at. Draco turned around on his heel and walked out of the pub.
“For my first use of magic, I made my mother fly about ten meters in the air. She was always very proud, although I don’t think pride was written across her face when she thought she was never coming down from the sky,” Angelina added.
“Trust me, this place is safe…” Harry began to explain, but he was cut off as Draco realized something.
Molly moved towards the door, revealing an awaiting Hermione with her arms outstretched, wanting her own hug.
Harry tried to think of what else to say when Draco spoke, louder and with more confidence than Harry had heard from him all evening, “I know you are wondering where this is all coming from. Truth be told, I have been meaning to tell you I’m so fucking sorry for who I was. For anything and everything I did to you as a kid. For being reckless, selfish. For aiding to the worst cause of all time. I’ve regretted everything I’ve done for most of my life. But I never have told you any of this, and I think I’ve needed to for years. You were the one that had to defeat him, and by working with him I made your life even more of a hell than it already was. I am so, so sorry for who I was.”
“Stop,” Harry instructed forcefully, reaching over to Draco to grab his arm, “You are fucking brilliant at what you do. You will find Kareach, and I will help if it kills me. And I mean that promise. I once died.”
“Yeah,” Aviary agreed, “Listen, Harry, if we made you uncomfortable, we are sorry. We weren’t planning to snog right before your statement.”
“We don’t need you to make excuses for Ron,” Ginny said tensely, “He’s my brother and Harry’s best friend. He should support us, not tell us we are ruining out family directly in front of our kids.”
So when Ginny asked him over breakfast a few weeks into his meetings with Malfoy how therapy was going, he told her about how he was starting to feel much better. This wasn’t a total lie; some days he felt brighter, purposeful. But then there were others when he felt weighed down by sadness and then confusion over his own sadness.
“We’ve already lost four muggles,” Padma added, “And who knows if we have even hospitalized everyone who was poisoned? We were in Yorkshire for hours trying to track down anyone who went to Sandy’s yesterday. Not to mention all the obliviating we had to do.”
“All those times you were out together…” she exclaimed, “I should have known! You’ve been so suspicious and dodgy about it all!”
As Padma reached her office door, she gave it a sharp kick with her foot. The door swung open a second later, and Harry could see Ron bent over his desk, wand pointed absentmindedly at the door. Harry was once again amazed at how well the two worked together. He and Ida had been a good team, but they were never as in sync as Ron and Padma.
“I have real news,” Harry grabbed Malfoy’s arm and waved his wand, focusing on the street outside of Smith and Walton’s Cafe. After the brief compressing darkness, Harry and Malfoy reappeared outside of the cafe.
Ginny knew him well enough to know he had gone into a thought spiral. She stood up and walked over to his side, peering into his eyes.
Walburga opened her eyes slowly as Draco stood in front of her. She no longer screamed whenever she heard voices in the hall, but she detested being disturbed. Harry waited for the screams to start, but nothing happened.
“So, as you all know,” Seamus said, “Dean was recently the victim of a terrible crime committed at St. Mungos.”
“I’m here to apologize, Ginny,” Harry stood up to walk towards Ron and Ginny, “And to make sure you know that what I did was never out of spite. That nothing I ever do towards you will be out of spite.”
“I told you the smoke was pointless, now didn’t I?” Ida’s voice was so casual, as if she knew she knew she had the upper hand. Harry’s blood boiled at the mere sight of her.
Harry stared at him in awe, “You thought I was some closeted and awkward basket case for all of our childhood, didn’t you?”
Harry gave a slight laugh, “If you would, throw in I think Hermione’s a wanker too. Might as well get the full truth out.”
Harry turned around and started. Scorpius Malfoy was standing next to Rose and Al, eyes fixed on the kite as Lily attempted to guide it.
“Never mind,” Harry muttered. He turned back to the fireplace, deciding not to push the topic any further.
Harry looked down at his hands as tears began to fall uncontrollably from his eyes. He almost immediately felt Hermione’s arms around him.
“Chann,” Harry whispered, everything becoming very real as he imagined Brayan talking to the same people Draco had, finding out everything about the poison for all the wrong reasons.
Seamus shrugged, “Honestly Harry, I don’t know. They are just rumors, and while Boot has his moments, he’s not always the most trusty source of information,” Seamus stopped to think, then said, “But it wouldn’t be that surprising, now would it? I mean, about half of our year ended up being queer. There’s me, Dean, Lavender, Parv, Nev, Blaise... Malfoy wouldn’t exactly be a shock.”
“Just for your information, James, Mr. Malfoy and I aren’t in a relationship,” he clarified, “But I am thankful for the… support? Reluctant acceptance?”
Ginny sent a look reminiscent of her mothers at George and snapped, “I’ll bloody kiss Harry when I please.”
Harry decided not to speak as he looked at Aviary expectantly. Ron and Ginny were frozen in their positions at each side of him with expressions of alarm and concern as they waited for what Aviary had to say.
The third part of the plan was for Draco to go to the Puddlemere field and set out bug bombs in the stadium. It was the perfect plan to get Aries to the field: as the owner of the team and stadium, he would have to go and deal with the heavy amounts of smoke the bombs would release. The bombs wouldn’t do any damage, so it would take hardly any time for the smoke to be cleared. However, the release of the bombs would raise suspicion, especially right now, as the attack on the quidditch pitch was only mere weeks ago. At least one Auror would need to be sent down there to help clear up the pitch and inspect the damage, and Harry would bet anything that Ida would volunteer, out of suspicion and the fact it would give her a chance to talk to Aries in private. No, the plan wasn’t foolproof, but it set up the perfect way for Padma to hear a conversation between Ida and Aries.
As much as Harry wanted to take the first portkey home, this was obviously not an option. Although, if his kids weren’t waiting up in the bleachers, Harry may have considered it. With Draco sitting a few rows away, this night was going to be pure torture.
Harry thought back to all the times he had theories and ideas while at Hogwarts. There were countless times both Ron and Hermione followed him blindly into the thick of action, trusting that he knew what he was talking about. But there were other times where Hermione’s sense of logic kicked in, from when she wouldn’t believe him about Draco being a Death Eater to when she was convinced Sirius wasn’t actually in danger after Harry had a vision via Voldemort’s mind. In the latter, she was right. Sirius hadn’t been in danger. Many times when Hermione’s intuition kicked in, she was right. But other times she wasn’t. Harry had a feeling that if he involved Hermione in on the threat of Kareach, she would choose logic to explain why the idea of a secret rumored society being run under the noses of Ministries throughout the world was unrealistic. As much as he loved and trusted Hermione, Draco was right.
“Where’s the cut off?” Draco said, a small smile lifting the corner of his mouth, “When you killed Voldemort?”
Tears ran down Ginny’s cheeks, “Only once,” she whispered, “Unless you count the feelings I’ve had for months, edging on a year. Harry, I’m so sorry. I made a mistake. I was lonely and sad one night, and I didn’t think. But you were so distant, and you were constantly lying. I needed another source.”
“You can still use surrogacy, if you haven’t had sex since the attack,” Draco said this half-heartedly, as he could probably tell by Dean and Seamus’s reactions that ship had already sailed.
With Ida and Aries now on the ground, Seamus and Ron turned to Draco and Harry respectively to reverse their full-body binding curses.
Healer Patrick said a goodbye to Seb and gestured for Harry to follow her outside into the hallway. But instead of speed walking down the hall to a new destination, she stopped right outside Seb’s door.
“I loved Harry, Ar,” she said, fake regret coursing through her words, “Like a brother. I knew he would never join our ranks, not with his fucked up past, but I never thought it would come to this.”
Seamus shrugged, “Say what you will, but you still talked about him too much, even if he was your competition. And then there was that whole thing with Cho Chang. Let’s just say, when you and Ginny started dating, I was very surprised at how functioning and normal you two seemed together.”
“Padma!” Aviary yelped, swatting the woman in question on her arm, “I was not staring at his arse! Stop trying to set me up, or I’ll start personally telling all the women in the room that you’re available!”
“It’s not a secret!” Harry insisted, “We haven’t even been friends for that long! I just haven’t mentioned it because of these precise reactions.”
“Seamus noticed a split second before Ida raised her wand. He grabbed Nev’s wand and cast two stupefys: one for you and one for Draco. You two collapsed just in time to avoid getting hit with the curse, and by that time the rest of us were firing so many curses at Ida and Aries that were knocked out cold within seconds,” Ginny explained.
Harry looked away quickly. He was prepared to end this conversation with Malfoy (it was quickly becoming more than he bargained for) but then he remembered another question he wanted an answer to.
Harry went to prove his point once more, but stopped at the weird look on Ginny’s face. He supposed he was being a bit overbearing with his indignation about Malfoy’s sexual preference, so he stopped and let the conversation shift from office gossip to Neville’s latest customers at his greenhouse. Despite the hilarity of the customer that managed to drop a large bag of marbles on the floor of the store and trip over them multiple times, Harry doesn’t find himself to be enjoying the evening anymore. Although he knows that Malfoy couldn’t possibly be anything but straight, he finds his mind is awfully fixated on the what-if for reasons that defy all logic.
Once their laughter died down, Harry could feel tension full the room once again. He forced himself to address Draco.
“You both probably think it is highly usually for me to invite Potter back here today,” Savant began, “But no one knows our dear Ida here as well as you, Potter! And, in all honesty, I get a little overwhelmed with all these Auror trainees. So many, all so eager!”
“When I don’t hear much of anything from you!” Draco exclaimed, “Not to mention, you were the one who choose to trust Ron and Padma!”
Ron went to her side and grasped her hand. His pale face, lined with worry, told Harry the last thing Ron wanted to do was explain to Hermione about Chann. But Ron began to speak, his voice strong despite the sadness in each word.
“Because this whole fight is ridiculous and I’m just going to bloody tell you how the stakeout went before I explode,” Draco stated.
“I know I did. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that I needed to be a part of this investigation. That and my position as an aspiring Healer would make me useful to Draco,” Harry said.
Draco shook his head. To Harry’s surprise, he laughed shortly, “That’s a way to give say ‘fuck you’ to the Death Eaters. Become rightful owner to one of their ancestral houses.”
“Hiya, sweetheart,” Harry said as he and Lily were wrapped in Rose’s arms. Smiling down at his niece, he felt like the world was making more and more sense.
“I knew it,” Ida said triumphantly, but something in her face suggested she didn’t quite believe him.
Harry looked at the scoreboard. Fifty to Seventy, with Puddlemere leading. Angelina was soaring through the air, a fist of triumph raised. She must have scored again.
The one and a half year girl let out a loud giggle and then threw her hands up into the hair, indicating that she wanted Harry to pick her up. He wasted no time, bending down to hoist her onto his hip.
Harry apparated into the living room of his house. Until he saw the shocked looks on his kids faces, he had forgotten he wasn’t supposed to be here at the moment.
“Seamus, if you want to tell them about the little Sports and Games gossip chain then just do it. No need to draw it out.”
Padma laughed loudly at this, to which Parvati turned to her sister and snapped, “You think he’s cute, too!”. To her wife, she responded, “Blaise’s attractiveness has nothing to do with this! I am allowed to be curious about what Seamus has to say.”
His brain was spinning with the sheer amount of things he was criticizing about his own life, and Harry knew that was unhealthy. He had left the Auror department so didn’t have to feel so unstable all the time. He needed to remember that. Taking a deep breath, he glanced around his room. He started to feel better as he looked at the pictures: James and Albus each holding one of Lily’s hands, swinging her between them. Ginny smiling with her arms around two of the members of her team. Ron, Harry and Hermione sitting in the backyard, caught in a bout of laughter. He laughed out loud when he saw one of the pictures had been covered completely by Ginny’s quidditch robes from yesterday. If Harry had thought he was messy, he was in for an unprecedented shock when he moved in with Ginny. Her complete lack of organization skills or a desire to organize anything was one of the things Harry loved about her. She was unapologetically chaotic in her nature. These, he told himself, are reasons his life was on track.
“Without you, Hermione could have been much worse off,” Ron said, “She may not have even made it. I can’t express my gratitude enough.”
“Let’s start with our family,” she said, “One of the oldest pureblood families in the world. By having the fortune of being born into such a prized family, I also gained the right to take over an organization my family has run for generations. My dear ina and ama decided about ten years ago that it was time to pass on Kareach to a new generation. Out of our family, which stretched across continents, Aries and I were clearly the two most viable options. It was decided that I would move to England, assimilate myself into wizarding society, and run the operation with Aries. After the fall of Voldemort, it was up to us to bring to life the ideals that supposedly died with him. Because of us, Kareach as grown to occupy purebloods from all over the world.”
“I’m not just any reporter,” Malfoy said, dipping his quill in more ink, “All I need is an answer to my question.”
Sorry was quickly abandoned as Roxy, Fred, Al and James all made their way across the room to throw themselves around Rose, Lily and Harry. Within seconds, Harry’s face had broken out into a huge grin. The confusion and the challenges of the day ebbing away, Harry said to Angelina, “Better get in on this! These kids hug like nobody’s business.”
There were plenty of grumblings, but slowly the group said their goodbyes to Hermione and told her reassurances (assuming her tears for solely trauma from the attack). Soon, the only people in the room were Ron, Harry and Rose, who was now lying on the bed, curled up in her mother’s embrace. Hermione was gently stroking her daughter’s face. She didn’t say anything. None of them did. They didn’t know what could be said.
“So,” Ron continued, “Remmins and Aviary watched Savant’s memory together after the initial interrogation. I wasn’t there, but Aviary told me everything. She said Remmins began to freak out only minutes into the interrogation. Apparently, he had realized that the way Brayan was acting unusually. He told Aviary he believed that Brayan was under the Imperius curse while he was speaking under the influence of truth serum!”
Harry’s attention was drawn away from Seamus as Ginny choked on the mead she was drinking. He gave her a curious look but she averted his gaze. Harry turns back to the conversation at hand as Ron inquires,
Bill and Fleur arrived then, walking across the row with Louis, Dom, Victore and Teddy in tow. Grateful for the distraction from his thoughts, Harry joined his kids in greeting them enthusiastically. Most of the Weasley family would be here today in support of Ginny and Angelina. They would all be sitting in the same row, making for an interesting game as support was torn between the two teams.
Harry nodded in agreement as Ron said, “I don’t blame you, mate. I would be avoiding an interview with that ferret for as long as humanly possible if I was you.”
“The Aurors were being overpowered,” Ron said, his voice hard, “You were right, Draco. There were far too many members of Kareach for the Aurors to handle alone.”
“They believe they are strong enough to take over,” Ron said, his voice still firm but a small sense of uncertainty peeking through. He was putting up a confident front, but Harry knew him well enough to know he was terrified.
“You don’t have to tell me. But you don’t have to close up and act like you did during the interview. I’m only curious,” Harry countered, looking directly at Malfoy.
When Ginny pulled away, she sent Harry a look that read ‘I’m upset you are here but I’m too happy with my brother right now to fully care’.
Harry’s whole body stiffened. He turned away from Hermione without looking her in the eye and hugged Rose and Ron. He tried to ignore the lingering stress and sadness in Ron’s eyes and instead turned to his kids and Rose, who were laughing as they compared ugly Christmas sweaters, a Potter-Weasley Christmas Eve tradition. Ron and Hermione had been his oldest source of comfort and happiness, and now they reminded him of the two most challenging things in his life; his desire to end his marriage and his failed attempts to bring an end to the attacks afflicting muggles and muggleborns. The easiest thing for him right now was to impress Rose with his Christmas tree sweater that lights up and wait for his other guests to arrive.
“It was probably coach Reyes,” Harry agreed, “Hey, since when do you guys throw around the terms ‘wanker’ and ‘prick’ like their reasonable vocabulary choices for children under ten?”
With that, she pulled the door shut behind her as she walked back to the canteen. Harry couldn’t help himself; as soon as the door was closed, he began to laugh. It was a jarring sound he barely recognized as his own. Draco gave him an alarmed look, but then slowly began to laugh along with Harry, his eyes still a mix of sadness and anger that Harry wanted desperately to erase.
Curses bounced off the shield from left and right. To Harry’s surprise, none of them were the bright green of the killing curse. Kareach wasn’t aiming to kill today. They couldn’t risk spilling any pureblood blood. But that didn’t mean they wouldn’t if they had to. Any of the Aurors were fair game.
She said this all as she re-braided her hair in a braid Harry had never seen or could ever begin to explain. Amazed at her impressive multitasking, he didn’t answer until Ida gave him a pointed look.
“My bloody luck strikes again,” Malfoy drawled, “Scorpius befriended every Potter and Weasley he could find.”
“Is it fine if I come in?” Draco asked. He looked absolutely exhausted. His eyes were bloodshot and his hair reminded Harry’s of his own throughout his childhood: wild with no sense of direction. Harry thought unwillingly about how attractive this was on him, then scolded himself for thinking of anything but Hermione at the moment.
“No, god forbid,” Harry joked. His voice was light but he doubted Draco couldn’t tell how nervous he was.
Harry decided to tell the truth. It didn’t matter anymore, he supposed, “Draco found out weeks ago. He went on a trip to Cambodia years ago and heard about the poison from locals. He hadn’t thought about it until now, when he realized the effects lined up perfectly with the state of victims after the Imperius attacks.”
“Unless they haven’t had sex and they could still save some of Seamus’s sperm,” Draco finished bluntly.
Harry nodded and didn’t speak for a second. When he did, his voice gave a strange crack, “Is it safe for you to keep investigating?”
“Once again, Harry, we can never know unless he tells us himself,” Seamus said, looking a little taken aback by Harry’s insistence.
Draco laughed lightly then abruptly pulled his arm away from Harry, his eyes darkening. He looked down at his arm. Harry followed his gaze to the faded dark mark printed on the underside of his arm.
“Harry,” Draco whispered. The word alone sent shivers up and down Harry’s spine, “We will stop this. It has to be us.”
Harry began to think, without meaning to, about Malfoy. He had been raised in a similar situation and had been an arse for most of his youth. Harry now pictured the Malfoy he had recently befriended as an adult. What did it take to become a new person? And even as a thought in the back of Harry’s mind became to question whether change was really entirely possible, he couldn’t help but believe Malfoy wasn’t the same person and never would be again.
“Aviary,” he began, “I know we hardly know each other. But I couldn’t begin to imagine what you are going through. If I were to lose… someone that close to me, I would hardly be handling it as well as you are. All we can do is promise you we will avenge his death. I promise you.”
Ginny stared for a moment, then nodded silently and made her way back inside. With that, Harry turned to Dean and Seamus.
“You can tell him, I’m not going to rat on you,” Padma announced, “I know you’re gonna tell him anyway, so I might as well get to be involved.”
Ginny nodded and said nothing. Then she enveloped him in a hug that reminded him of the hugs she would give him their first years of marriage. When their relationship was still new and filled with laughter and promise. When they thought there was nothing more to love than being with someone who brought you joy. The truth was, Ginny would always bring him joy. She would always be a huge part of his life. But maybe he needed to open his heart up to what brings him real euphoria. Whether that involved therapy and/or Draco, he did not know. What mattered was that he was now ready to find out.
“I know. I am happy for you and Gin, but I still can’t believe you two ended up with Slytherins,” Ron said.
“Al, don’t retaliate,” Ginny said firmly, as Harry said, “It’s a meeting where I go and talk to a nice person who helps me talk through any problems I have.”
Harry watched as Ron helped Hermione out of her chair and to her feet. As they made their way to the door, Ron turned around to face Draco,
He smiled at her, looking much more at ease knowing they were excited to see him, “Great, Hermione. You are looking lovely.”
“Hermione,” Harry consoled, “I haven’t fully known until this past week. I guess I had my suspicions, but it can be extremely hard to address a part of yourself you’ve buried for years. None of this has anything to do with me not trusting you. Although, I nearly didn’t tell you today.”
Harry almost smiled at this, but then the reason they were all there came crashing around him. This wasn’t a meeting. He and Draco weren’t joking over tea. Aviary’s boyfriend had been murdered by one of his best friends. He knew the truth and he had no fucking idea what to do with it.
Harry sighed as he took a bite of his sandwich. The absence of Dean felt like a sharp pain in his side. It was a constant reminder of the terrific events of last week and what they had done to his dear friend. Harry began to feel a darkness spread over him; he couldn’t be here anymore. He could no longer stand sitting with his thoughts and feelings. Standing up, he grabbed his sandwich and threw the rest of it in the bin before heading back to the Ground Floor.
Ida had told Harry all about her life as a child in the Philippines. The Minister of Magic, a bloke named Dansell Reega, had held very odd beliefs on how to run a wizarding society. He believed that the best way to keep wizards and witches safe was to make them think and act as if they were second to the rights and desires of muggles. He preached that every family should live in small houses in the middle of nowhere to prevent getting in the way of muggles in any form. So while Ida’s family had plenty of money, being one of the oldest and wealthiest wizarding families in the world, Reega’s decades-long employment as Minister forced Ida and her family to live in dreadful conditions. Only recently had the new Minister, Janika Aquino, taken over Reega’s position and begun to run the Filipino Ministry of Magic in a way quite similar to the present English Ministry. So while things in the Philippines were looking up, Ida had managed to leave, besides her parents' protests, while Reega was still in office. As a result, her entire childhood experience was surrounded by the darkness of Reega’s cruel instruction. Aries, on the other hand, had never  experienced Reega’s regime in any form. He had lived as a privileged pureblood in England his entire life.
Harry almost threw up again when he saw who it was. Dean and Seamus were making their way down the stairs, a mirror of Luna only minutes earlier (sans the lifesize Christmas tree sweater).
Arthur’s eyes lit up immediately. He had his own phone now, as he had been so desperately fascinated by them, but he still got beyond excited when Harry used his.
“Think about it,” Draco said, turning to face the two of them, “What is a group of purebloods greatest weakness? The fact that they constantly underestimate muggle inventions and ideas. People like this believe that muggles are so far beneath them that anything they think up is useless and pales in comparison to what magic can do. What we need is a way to hear what Ida is saying when she is with her fellow Kareach members, and I think I know how to do just that.”
This immediately drew in the attention of Ginny, Angelina and Seamus who launched into a conversation about quidditch faster than a snitch moved across a pitch.
“I’m not straight. I’ve never been. Maybe I’m gay, or bi, or pan, or something else. I don’t know yet. But I like blokes,” he rambled, looking to his friend for confirmation that this was okay. That he was still Harry.
As he reached the cook serving the pot pies, he gave his best smile and politely asked the witch if he could perhaps have two pies instead of one. The witch, whose name was Lacey, was one of the kindest people Harry had ever met. Harry had taken to talking to her oftentimes at the end of his lunch break when he finished with his food and the rush had died down.
“You made it!” Seamus gasped, “I thought you all would be at the Ministry all night! Even the Games and Sports department has been talking about the incident nonstop.”
“Oh, Ron will probably pass out from the shock,” Harry confirmed, “But it’s a good idea. We need every bit of civility we can get if we’re going to take down Kareach together.”
“I don’t know, Harry. I didn’t even go to Hogwarts and I still know in painstaking detail about all the times you fought with Malfoy or thought he was up to something,” Ida pointed out.
“I didn’t know Pansy was gay!” Harry whispered loudly, turning away so he didn’t appear as if he was staring.
Parvati pulled a face and said simply, “Then I’ll be forced to ask Seamus to fill the position. I’m sure he’d be honored.”
Draco looked back up and Harry’s whole body seemed to go numb. One look at the lust intensifying in Draco’s gaze could send Harry to pieces. Without thinking, he grabbed the edges of Draco’s oversized coat (something he had been dying to do for quite some time) and pulled Draco towards him. Their lips met, gently at first but then more intensely as they began to pour all of their words, spoken and unspoken, into the kiss. Harry’s senses were all Draco: his smell, vanilla and coconut and him. The feeling of his skin and hair as Harry moved his hand to grasp onto strands as if they were his own personal lifeline. He pulled Draco as close as possible, wanting more and more and not thinking he could ever have enough of this.
A woman walking with her kids had stopped behind Draco to watch them. Harry gave her a weak smile until she left. Then he pulled Draco underneath the bleachers when no one was looking, realizing they shouldn’t be talking about this at one of the most crowded wizarding functions of England.
“What is going on in here?” the woman asked, looking accusingly at the chairs laying on their sides.
“You cannot say a word, Potter,” Malfoy looked up weakly at him, “I could be fired. And as much as I hate my job at the moment, I would hate being fired more.”
“My mother told me,” Ida continued, “Not to join the muggle-loving Ministry run by one of the greatest blood traitors of our time, Kingsley Shacklebolt. But I knew that being an Auror was a genius position. It was the perfect way to know everything the Ministry suspected. A way to control the attacks we had been planning for years from the inside. To prevent the Ministry from ever suspecting me or any of my family. And it worked. Me, as a respected Auror and Aries as a respected quidditch coach. Two people who were far from likely to be a part of a plan to demolish the muggle race.”
Harry muttered “nox” outside his bedroom door so as to not wake Ginny with the bright light of his wand as he entered. Unlike Harry, Ginny was the world’s lightest sleeper. The slightest sound or hint of light could wake her within seconds. Harry slowly opened the bedroom door, being careful not to open it too far as he knew the point where the door would let out a loud screech. He managed to enter and closed the door without a sound and began to walk across the room to the bathroom when Ginny let out a loud cough.
Caser smiled at this, “I worked hard. I knew I wanted to be a Healer ever since I was little. My mother being one and all. She always inspired me.”
Harry blushed slightly as Draco rolled his eyes. The truth was, Draco had proposed a little over a week ago. The two hadn’t told anyone yet as to not draw focus from Lavendar and Parvati’s day.
“You sent my ex-wife’s new boyfriend to her house?” Harry asked, “I could laugh if this situation wasn’t so dire.”
The score was now one-twenty to one hundred with Puddlemere leading. This was causing rather foul language from Ron, who at one point shouted that, “Angelina was too fucking good to be allowed to play!”, causing a laugh of triumph from George and a scolding from Molly. Thankfully the intensity of the match was lessened as the group spotted a man wheeling a concession cart. If anything was going to bring a family together and simultaneously distract Harry from his feelings, it was food.
“I’m starting to see why she was in Slytherin,” Draco muttered. Looking back over at Harry, he said gently, “It’s now or never, Harry.”
Harry read the list and mentally prepared to do all the things asked of him. Then, bracing himself, he walked into the room.
Molly glanced over at Harry, her eyes suddenly filled with the warm concern he associated with his mother-in-law.
“No!” Draco screamed. The last thing Harry saw as the world went black was Draco diving in front of him.
Without thinking, he began to repair the gashes slowly and with a focus he didn’t know he had in him. All that mattered now was healing the cuts and bruises before any permanent damage was left.
Harry sat down beside him as Ron continued to speak, “Aviary said she didn’t recognize the voice. Which makes very little sense, because the only people in the interrogation room at the time were Savant, Ida and Padma. Not that I think it was any of them. But they are the most likely options if someone was indeed casting an Imperius curse.”
The next night Harry was lounging on the couch in his sitting room with one of Hermione’s books stretched across his lap. Harry went to Ron and Hermione’s after work the previous night and told Hermione his aspiration to help find out the poison, to which Hermione lent him any book in her library that looked like it could be of any help. The large stack was now sitting on the table beside him as he read through “Modern History of Potions” and sipped on a tea. Both Al and James were at Fleur and Bill’s house for the night, so only Harry, Lily and Ginny were left in the house. Ginny was in the next room at the kitchen table, helping Lily complete a small puzzle. Lily’s small cheers of excitement echoed around the house. Despite the comfort in this, Harry still felt on edge for multiple reasons: the gloomy weather that showed no signs of sunshine, the seemingly impossible task of finding anything helpful in the large pile books and the lingering sadness he felt all the time. Last night hadn’t made anything better. He had had one of his many recurring dreams that had been happening since the end of the war. Maybe it was because he had seen Malfoy yesterday, but he dreamed about the day he found Malfoy in the bathroom and used the Sectumsempra curse against him. After witnessing the death of numerous innocent people, Harry had felt immense guilt for almost killing Malfoy. Not that Malfoy had been guilt free; he had been trying to find a way to let the Death Eaters into Hogwarts. And while Harry was far from forgiving him for any of the things he did, he understood that Malfoy had been in an impossible situation that did not warrant death. Harry shook himself and tried to continue reading. What he absolutely did not need now was a trip into his past.
Harry opened the door of the Burrow to the smell of mashed potatoes, ham and something sweet (which Harry hoped was Molly’s blueberry crumble, his personal favorite). Weekly Sunday lunches at the Burrow never failed to be the highlight of Harry’s week. Nothing rang in the start of a new week quite like Molly Weasley’s renowned cooking and an afternoon of laughter.
Luna then launched into a story of how her father once told her that the bats in central Europe started a protest against the implications of the Bat-Bogey hex, in which Harry was finding himself wishing were true, just by the absurdity of the thought. Not long after, the group turned its attention to Dean, who had begun telling a rather bizarre story of a patient he had treated this week who had a garden growing out of his chest. Dean had just finished telling them “he rather liked the cucumbers, but the radishes needed work” when a knock sounded at the door.
“Wouldn’t we all,” Ginny mumbled. She had finished her toast and eggs at rapid speed and was now gathering up her quidditch gear that was spread across the counter.
I told him I love him. What was wrong with Harry? He tells a man he accused his best friend of a heinous crime, and then he tells him he loves him the next minute? After going home last night, he had paced around the living room. When he came to the realization that he was never going to fall asleep, he left a note for Ginny and apparated to St. Mungo’s at 5:30 in the morning. His training didn’t start until eight, but the last thing he wanted to do was walk anxiously throughout his house and wait for Ginny to work up. He knew it was selfish, but he didn’t want to explain to another person what he had done last night.
“So,” Ida said as she reached for a scone, “I don’t want to talk about work tonight. My day was hell. Well, all my days are hell, but this one was like if an extra realm of hell was added. Anyway, I’m here to talk about personal life things. Which is abnormal for me, but we’re going to give it a whirl.”
“The best of influences,” Malfoy sneered, but Harry thankfully detected no malice in his voice. Instead, he just sounded tired and a bit defeated. Harry had a strong idea why.
Harry gasped when he turned the corner. The last person he would have expected had their face engulfed in flames in Harry’s fireplace.
“You know I don’t think that,” Harry said softly, “What you are doing now is far more important than anything I’ve done in a while.”
Draco said nothing for a second, then began to straighten back up the room with his wand and move towards the door. An apology was on the tip of Harry’s tongue for the way he had been acting lately, but then a more urgent thought popped into his head.
Harry sat down on the floor in the room with his back propped against the bed. Aviary sat down next to him, her eyes wide as she took in the decor of the room. Draco sat down reluctantly opposite of them, his back against the wall.
Saying Ron’s name made him feel a jolt of sadness. Harry was so accustomed to bringing up Ron in conversation that he didn’t even register the fact that, as of right now, he and Ron weren’t on speaking terms, much less friends.
“Can we even work together, civilly?” Malfoy asked, “I mean, we have an extensive history of mistrust.”
“It is true!” Malfoy insisted, running a hand through his hair in an attempt to move the falling strands out of his eyes, “Astoria thought it would be a good way for me to get over my fear of them! And, trust me, it still surprises me how much I love the little guy.”
“Sure, but there are many ex-Slytherins working at the Ministry who I trust wholeheartedly!” Savant countered.
“Draco Malfoy, of course! Apparently he and Harry have been getting along quite fine as of late,” Seamus explained as if it were common knowledge, “Although I’m not sure what you said to him, mate. Blaise said he was almost livid with you the last time he talked to Malfoy.”
“Years ago,” Ida continued haughtily, “Brayan’s father, Gert Foget, found the poison, a rare and popularly unheard of one, in a small city in Cambodia. Once we found out the properties stunted the reproduction of whoever took it,” she emphasized, looking smugly at Harry and Draco in turn, “We knew it was the perfect poison. Kareach has arranged their entire plan to rid the world of muggles around the poison ever since. Ironically, the perfect scapegoat to go down for our crimes was none other than Foget’s son, Darius Brayan. You see, Foget’s wife, Annabelle, was a pureblood just like him. But she, being the filthy blood traitor she was, believed that Foget’s devotion to Kareach was unacceptable. She left Foget and took her son, Darius. She remarried years later to a muggle and told her son, a pureblood, that he was half muggle. While this is all very upsetting, it worked out for us. You see, Brayan has reportedly told everyone he knows that he is a halfblood, when in reality, he is descended from one of the oldest pureblood families in the world, based in Egypt. After being accused, he looked guilty. Pretending he wasn’t a pureblood? Working at the hospital as a cover-up? How could it not be him? This all made his confession that much easier. I’ve gotten so good at the Imperius curse that it was easy to cast the curse on him while my colleagues believed he was on Veritaserum. How fucking Remmins realized he was cursed, I have no idea. But he’s dead now. And soon you two will be.”
The door flung open to reveal Healer Patrick, a sharp looking witch wearing maroon Healer’s robes. Her dark hair was pulled back in a bun reminiscent of Minerva McGonagalls; not a single hair out of place. She had a pointed face that reminded him of Malfoy’s. At the sight of Harry, she pointed her wand backwards towards a large pile of papers and sent them flying towards Harry’s arms without looking. Harry thankfully had enough sense to place his arms out in front of him in order to catch them before they pelted him in his stomach.
“Oh yes, you can,” Harry forced the door open and strode into the flat. He let out a small gasp as he caught sight of the room. The entire living room had been converted into an intensive investigation center. Papers and books were stacked on every available service, and where posters had once hung on the wall were list after list of what Harry could only assume was Draco’s ideas, thoughts and research. Although Harry had been helping to find out anything he could about Chann these past couple weeks, his main focus had been on his confusing love life. All Draco focused on was putting all his available energy into learning about Chann and Kareach.
Ida shrugged, “Yes. I don’t know if you just want a relationship with him or if you want time to deal with the divorce or if you need to spend time figuring out your sexuality.”
Ginny was looking at him strangely but Harry didn’t care. There was just no way that bit of information was anything but a rumor. Harry knew Malfoy well enough to know he wasn’t gay. He was a happily married man in a heterosexual relationship. Shagging Blaise Zabini was off the table.
“Great, Luna,” Harry smiled at his friend, a little put off by how many people were asking that very question today.
Malfoy gave a short laugh and shook his head, “She’s done nothing of the sorts. As you can see,” he gestured across the bar, “She’s a little too preoccupied to talk to me at the moment.”
Harry ignored this as he walked into the cafe and made his way to their usual table. Malfoy sat down, concern now etching his face. Harry immediately began to tell Malfoy what he had heard tonight, expressing his frustration at the complete lack of belief in Kareach from his friends.
“But a pet ferret! I never would have thought…” Harry trailed off as he fell into a fit of laughter again.
“I think so. It seems like the best fit,” Caser confirmed, “I used to help Madam Pomfrey with quidditch accidents after matches, so I feel right at home.”
Draco narrowed his eyes and Harry could feel the shield between them disappear. Harry hadn’t been expecting this high level of wandless magic. Draco grabbed his wand and began to remove the shield surrounding them.
Harry, resigning to the fact he was never going to have a normal conversation with Malfoy, answered, “The pot pie is amazing. Not getting it would be a crime against pot pie itself.”
Harry shook his head, “Not true! After I told you about Ginny and Blaise you lost your shit. After I told you about Draco you only wanted to talk about me cheating!”
Words couldn’t describe the surge of gratitude he felt towards Ginny at that moment. She was right; whatever happens, they would be allies in this. For the first time, he truly began to feel like he was doing the right thing.
Draco looked up, face silently breaking, “I didn’t want you to die then either,” he hesitated, then whispered, “I would have prevented Crabbe and Goyle from getting to you. I wanted to mess things up. But Crabbe did that for me with the Fiendfyre.”
“He has been working on investigating Kareach,” Harry explained, banking on Hermione knowing about the rumors.
Dean picked up his slice of blueberry pie and took a bite, “I still can’t believe he’s allowed to coach a team with Angelina Johnson on it. She is far too good for him.”
Harry ignored Ginny’s and Ron’s looks of shock as he processed what Seamus had said. Draco was livid? He wondered desperately how whatever stakeout that Draco had been talking about went. Their fight near the lift had happened only two days prior. Harry hadn’t talked to Draco since then, not knowing what to say or think after his outburst. Now he wondered worriedly what Draco was mad about; just him being a prat, or the investigation? Or both? Or the fact Harry wasn’t there to help him? He should have called, he should have helped. He felt selfish, disloyal. But now, as he looked at the still shocked faces of Ginny and Ron, he also felt ashamed.
Harry was surprised to see Molly back so soon (she had been there a couple hours before) and he was especially surprised to see her look so excited? Upset? It was hard to tell with her sometimes.
So, he had ended up at a place he knew he’d feel safe: Seb’s apartment. The two hadn’t seen much of each other lately, what with two attacks and Christmas, but Seb took him in with open arms when Harry sent an owl.
Harry tried not to look visibly angry at this. He attempted to console himself by thinking Ginny was probably in such a bad mood after talking to coach Reyes that she didn’t think of the fact Harry would want to have a goodbye from her, especially because she wouldn’t be back until late tonight due to another team bar night.
“That one never seems to get old,” Ginny said, shaking her head at her brother, “Your level of humor never ceases to amaze me.”
“I lied earlier when I told the Aurors I didn’t know who killed Gani,” Aviary’s voice cracked at the mention of Gani’s name, but she recovered quickly to a face of firm determination. A feeling of dread creeped through Harry as he waited to hear who Aviary would say.
“That’s because you looked at him in your room for weeks, you nutter. I couldn’t find him when I needed to send a letter to Teddy!” James paused, then continued, “But nevermind that. This kite is amazing! Can I fly it?”
Ida sneered, “I know why you are being so defensive, Harry. You like someone. Like  really like someone. I’m an Auror at the top of my field. I can detect a simple infatuation. My guess is your heart is set on Seb, unless there’s someone else?”
“Unless,” Hermione whispered, trying to peer at him, “There was someone who made you realize you aren’t straight?”
“But maybe that isn’t bad?” Harry said. It was strange being the comforting role in this situation, as he had been feeling the same stresses for the past couple months, “Lily will see you happy with Blaise or whomever, and me happy with…”
“What?” Ron said, “Oh… yes. The fighting has stopped and all of the muggleborns were either evacuated to you or taken with Healer Patrick and her team. Few casualties, too; only Youll and two muggleborns so far.”
Harry looked up to see Ron in the doorway. He was dressed in his Auror robes and he was holding a large stack of paperwork.
After several attempts to get their children to go to sleep (Harry had never met someone with less of a desire to sleep than his daughter), Ginny and Harry placed a couple silencing charms around their living room and began to talk. Harry found that he rather enjoyed the quiet atmosphere of his home; he could hear everything his friends said to him and to each other. Harry also enjoyed having Ginny present. He had forgotten how much fun it used to be when they would hang out with groups like this more frequently. Ginny was an easy-going and cheerful presence that had story upon story about quidditch practices that sent the group into uncontrollable fits of laughter numerous times throughout the night. Even the slightly touchy subject of Ginny hating Ida’s cousin made for easy conversation. As it turns out, Ida really couldn’t stand her cousin, especially of late.
Everything Harry had been feeling for the past hours washed away as he kissed Draco back, not realizing how desperately he still needed this. Needed to feel whole and secure, if only for a moment. Harry wanted to feel all of Draco, against him until the end of time. He pulled on the strands of hair on the back of Draco’s neck to pull him closer. He wanted no space between them. He wanted this feeling to never stop.
Seamus laughed and gave his husband a kiss on the cheek, “No, darling, but I still fawn over you the most. We’re talking about Blaise.”
Moving towards the door, Harry was hit by a sudden bout of nerves. Quickly telling himself to snap out of it, Harry pushed the door open. He had faced much worse than an adult Malfoy in conference room B; there was no reason for him to be nervous.
Draco nodded, while Blaise piped up, “So I’m good to go? Because I need to get the hell out of this hospital. No offense or anything. I’m sure your job is fun.”
“Dad?” James said softly, “Who did you accuse of the attacks? That’s what you and Grandma were talking about. And what mom was upset about last night, right? The attacks?”
Draco took a step back, “I am here to do nothing of the sort,” he moved to swipe the curtains shut as Walburga began to protest.
“I’m glad you approve,” Ginny snorted. She sat down on the edge of Harry’s bed, “But even with all this change, I want you to know that both your father and I will always be on the same team. We are both here for you, and we still love each other and you kids with everything we have. Now we’ll just have more people to love you.”
“First of all, my Auror reflexes extend to my superhuman hearing,” she waved a wand over her papers to move them out of the path of the fireplace, “Second of all, yes you may come through.”
“Hey!” he protested as a jar of ink hit the floor and shattered, spilling ink across the carpeting, “I just got new carpet put in!”
“Then don’t,” Harry snapped, “And if most of my decisions aren’t made for me, it’s because I have three fucking kids to take care of. That comes before anything.”
Ron stood up and crossed the room to his sister until he was standing directly in front of her, “Of course,” he said softly.
“I respect that, I really do. But it kinda seems as though you gave up after looking at one page of a name book,” Malfoy said.
Ida sighed, “Harry, as much as I would like to believe that, the family you are raised with has far too much influence on who you are for Malfoy to be a completely new person with no prejudiced views. Hate and ignorance just runs too deep.”
“Hello,” Harry said, more shortly than he had anticipated. Draco gave him a confused look while Blaise boomed back, “Potter! Great to see you, mate!”
Relief was washing over Harry. So that’s why Draco was at the match! For his job. Another fluff piece.
Without any warning, Harry felt a sudden urge to run toward him and grab on to Draco. Just hold him, wrap his arms around him. All because Draco looked so serious in his attempt to look for who was no doubt Harry, most likely to talk about the investigation. Why else would he show up midday in what was without a question the most muggle outfit Harry had ever seen Draco in? He was in older looking jeans and a black t-shirt, which somehow looked laid-back and inexplicably regal at the same time. It was working almost too well for him. Harry tore his eyes and mind away from his unexpected evaluations and desires of Draco and made a quick attempt to leave the canteen, heart racing haphazardly. He was almost to the lift doors when he felt a shot of air beside him. He was soon standing directly beside, you guessed it, Draco Malfoy.
When he rounded the corner to Savant’s office, he came face to face with his ex-partner Ida Reyes, a striking woman Harry had grown close to over the past couple years. Ida had glossy black hair that she always made into some type of complicated braid; today it was wrapped around her head in such a way that she looked as if she was wearing a crown. To top it off, she had woven in golden flecks that contrasted her hair impressively. She was wearing gold robes to match, a statement Harry instantly admired. Ida was bold and unapologetic, which had proven to be the perfect offset to his more reserved side. Despite how well they worked together, Ida had been the one who told him she thought he would make a great healer. Ida was a firm believer in following your heart and not doing what was expected of you. As the daughter of a pureblood family who held high expectations for their daughter’s life in England that she continuously defied, she reminded Harry of Sirius. That is probably what drew him to Ida in the first place, and the connection they quickly formed led Savant to make them partners.
“It’s Ms. Weasley,” Ginny shot, “And I will gladly leave. Just one last thing,” she stared at Harry with venom in her eyes, “You are not welcome in my home! Do you hear me? It’s time to do what you should have done years ago and get your own apartment!”
“Are you alright, Harry?” Seb asked. He began to turn around to see what Harry was looking at, but Harry reached out and pulled Seb to him in one quick move. Without stopping to think, he kissed Seb.
“Draco! What is the meaning of this! Certainly you can agree mudbloods should not be in our house!” Walburga screamed.
She looked back at him, “Harry, what’s going on?” she looked down at Dean and Seamus, who had stopped crying to look back at her, “What did you tell Dean and Seamus? Why is everything so sad and heavy with you lately? And why is Draco Malfoy the only one you are capable of taking comfort in?”
Need him? Harry’s mind supplied unhelpfully. Were the rumors Seamus heard true? Were Draco and Blaise a couple? They were both queer, it was a possibility.
“Yeah, but we always wanted to save a child from a bad situation as well,” Dean murmured, “We can make a family, no matter what. It’s just… so hard to believe we have our right to reproduction taken away from us.”
Harry was glad he had set his tea down before Seb started talking again, he may have full on choked on it if he had been drinking when Seb said all of this. Harry had not known Seb was bi. Sure, he had a feeling Seb could be something other than straight, but the more he had spent time with Seb, the less he thought this was true. It was mainly because Seb had told him multiple stories about his ex-girlfriend Hestoria that Harry began to lean towards the straight side of things. But as Harry began to think about Seb’s words, it all made sense. Seb was still attracted to women. He could still fall in love with another woman and potentially get married. This gave him a possibility to be the Seb his friends and family had always envisioned, the one who married a woman and lived happily ever after in a heterosexual relationship. But even if that did happen, Seb was still attracted to other genders, not just females. By not coming out, he would be forever hiding a part of himself from the people he loved.
Maybe if he concentrated hard enough, he could overcome the charm. At one point he was successfully capable of fighting off the Imperius curse. Petrificus Totalus couldn’t be that much different. He focused on the counter curse, trying to do magic without his wand being anywhere in sight.
“No ‘I’m sorry I left my partner alone to stakeout some Russian wizard all by himself’ or ‘I’m sorry I take three fucking days to get over myself in order to talk to you again, Draco’,” Draco said as if Harry had not spoken. He crossed his arms and fell gracefully onto one of his couches as he looked at Harry for an answer.
“Well, I for one think that people can change,” Luna said airily, “Remember when Lavender and Parvati were mean to me? Now they want me as one of their bridesmaids!”
Harry was glad to be immediately greeted by the bouts of laughter ringing throughout the hall as he walked into his house. He wandered towards the sounds of his noisy kids, grateful that some things never change. For as much as Harry’s life has seemed to change around him for the past couple years, he knew he could count on his three kids to keep him grounded. Walking into the room, Harry was greeted with quite a sight; Angelina with a squirming Lily in her lap was accompanied by Fred, Roxy and James around a Sorry! board spread out on the floor. Apparently the dreaded Sorry had just been issued on Fred, because he grabbed Roxy’s game pieces and threw them across the room, narrowly missing Harry.
Harry looked back at Seb, trying to figure out what he wanted. Many people he met only looked for friendship with him so that they could get in the Prophet for being associated with ‘The Chosen One’. Seb, however, had never seemed phased by the fact he was talking to Harry Potter. Maybe he was just a guy who needed some more good mates and Harry fit the bill. And Harry liked Seb a lot; he seemed like just the type of person Harry would be friends with.
“You think?” Harry said wearily, not wanting to associate any of his old colleagues with the actions of Kareach.
“Remmins's new partner. He was injured in the attack,” Ron said stiffly, “Fine bloke. Don’t know if he’ll make it.”
Harry just stared at Malfoy’s head, as he had once again bent over his binder as if Harry had never shown up. So not only did Malfoy know who the Spice Girls were, he listened to them. Draco bloody Malfoy listened to the Spice Girls.
“Let me show you,” Draco bent down to riffle through a tote bag Harry now realized was sitting on the floor next to the table. Harry also saw his own coat sitting next to it in a heap. Draco must have taken his coat to get him up here. It was a way to reassure that Harry couldn’t refuse to talk to Draco.
“You did what?” Ron seethed, stepping closer to Harry, “How could you! I knew you and Draco were too close!”
“No, you would not!” she argued, “Slytherin is not a life-long sentence of evil! I now know plenty of people who are Slytherin and are nothing but kind and gracious, while also possessing the cunning and power-seeking qualities that define the Slytherin house. Power can be held for good reasons, Ron.”
“Yes, Harry, I’ve been working day and night to solve these attacks. I’m an Auror. It’s what we are all doing. Don’t look so surprised. Now,” she continued, reaching down to reorganize her papers, “Why are you here?”
“Only because I care about Ginny and don’t want her to get hurt!” Seamus said. He hesitated, then scrunched up his brow in thought, “But I guess you’re kinda right? You and Draco together doesn’t surprise me all that much.”
“Yeah,” Harry agreed, “Aries will be far too unbearable. But let’s not forget Angelina and Oliver are still on Puddlemere. I don’t want to actively root against them.”
“My friend Scorpius has read about every book imaginable on magical creatures and he had never heard of Wrackspurts,” Al insisted.
“I agree,” she said firmly, reaching out to grasp Harry’s hand, “And no more yelling. It’s fucking Christmas.”
“Oh, fucking save it, Potter,” Draco interrupted, “You blew any coincidences with this case and Blaise out of proportion because you wanted to spite me! I blew you off and you couldn’t stand that, so you took it out on my best friend.”
Draco shook his head, “No, it’s always about that. I’m an ex-Death Eater. That’s something I can never erase from myself. I will never truly be a valued part of the wizarding community.”
“You’ve given him at least twenty ‘one more minutes’,” James informed him from his side. James was holding Lily who was squirming frantically in his grasp.
He stepped onto the lift and waited in silence as he rode up to the top floor. When the lift doors opened, he came face to face with the last person he wanted to see.
The three of them sat in silence, not knowing quite what to say. They had all focused on making sure this part of the plan went smoothly that they forgot the hardest part was actually waiting to hear what information they would learn from the bug. Harry supposed he could think of it as an opportunity to have intel on the attacks he had been helping work to stop for months and months, but it felt more like waiting for disaster to strike. What if they were too late? What if something was already happening, something they weren’t aware of? What if Ida had already given a message to her fellow Kareach members?
“It’s the poison, isn’t it?” Luna asked abruptly, “That is what’s upsetting you. Whatever is in the poison harmed Dean and the other victims in an irreversible and drastic way. One that left Dean unable to reproduce, I presume, by your reaction just now?”
“But that undermines their entire foundation,” Draco argued, “They’ve remained a rumor for so long because they never cast suspicion of otherwise publicly.”
“So, I don’t know if I’m supposed to ask,” Seb asked cautiously, “But I heard from my friend, who’s a healer at Mungos, that you and Ginny…”
Harry rolled his eyes, “We are not a couple, James! None of this matters, anyhow. What matters is your mother and I making things right so that you and your siblings' lives can be as normal as possible.”
Harry moved towards the bed to tell Hermione goodbye, when Healer Patrick handed him Hermione’s chart.
Harry reached into his coat pocket and found the little bag of owl treats he liked to carry around for this reason precisely. He tossed a treat into the air, which Oba caught as she flew towards the window and away. Harry returned his attention to the letter, his head throbbing violently as he attempted to read Ida’s letter.
“...Potter and Warbock,” at the sound of his name, Harry broke out of his daze and turned his attention to Brayan. As Brayan said another pair of names with an instruction, Harry realized he had missed what his assignment for today. Sighing, Harry began to doubt even more that Brayan admired his abilities.
“What’s under there?” Aviary said nervously as Draco pulled the drawings away to reveal Sirius’s mother, Walburga Black.
Rachel nodded. She walked towards one of the fireplaces used to leave the Ministry, then turned around, “You better make these fuckers pay, Potter.”
Harry shook his head, “No. That was Dumbledore. When he died, all the people he had told became secret keepers.”
“Listen, Seb,” Harry cut in patiently, “I really can’t talk about this right now. I potentially wrecked my relationships with multiple people today. What I need right now is just to forget about all of that.”
“Harry,” Padma whispered fiercely, “Calm down! We aren’t saying Malfoy wasn’t helpful! But he’s done something important for us, and now it’s our turn to take on the dangerous part by ourselves. It’s the way it has to be.”
“Maybe what we need is Hermione skimming these books,” Harry commented. He imagined she could read his entire stack in less than a day.
The conversation carried on as smells of lunch wafted in through the kitchen. He was in the middle of discussing Healer Patrick and his week of aiding her with the group when his phone started ringing from his back pocket.
“That sounds great, Harry,” Ida said, and to his relief she didn’t seem disappointed to have her pub idea derailed.
“Ginny!” Harry called into the house as soon as he appeared in the living area, “Ginny!” he called again, when no one answered.
“Harry…” she said, “I’m so happy you’ve told me. Regardless of whether or not you’re married to a woman, it’s important that you don’t hide this.”
Dean nodded as he slung an arm around Seamus’s shoulders, “Seamus has been waiting for this day forever. It would be impossible for him not to enjoy himself.”
“Harry, what’s going on?” She whispered, eyes alight with a concern she hadn’t given Harry in a long time.
“I think you like me,” Harry blurted. He didn’t know why he was making matters worse, but he really could not control himself.
“Harry!” Draco huffed. The use of his first name made Harry’s stomach lurch, “Didn’t you notice me? I’ve been making a fool of myself at the front of the canteen for minutes!”
Harry was taken aback by how waspish Malfoy was being towards him. He had expected the interview to go a lot more smoothly after the way he had seen Malfoy talk to his son and wife. Of course, Harry reasoned, Malfoy would naturally be nice to the people he loves and cares about. Harry was nothing but a bitter reminder of schoolboy rivalries and cruel interactions.
Ida laughed, “Bes is simply slang for a good friend. I’m not committing to this little best friend fantasy you’ve dreamt up.”
Harry laughed and reached for the whiskey again, “It should have. I’m never going to let you forget you ordered me garbage whiskey in one of my lowest moments.”
“You keep tabs on her for the next hour. Stay in this room, provide general check-ups about every fifteen minutes. Do you understand?” Harry nodded, trying to hide his surprise at the level of trust Healer Patrick was giving him in this moment. However, as soon as Patrick said a brisk goodbye and left the room, he wished she had been the one to stay with Hermione. He had no idea how to comfort a woman who found out she had taken a poison that had the ability to kill her child.
“Keep your voice down!” Ida chided. “You’re not an Auror. I could be fired for things like this! Even if you are Harry bloody Potter.”
He pats her on the arm, perfectly aware this is a lame gesture after the hug Draco gave her, and then pulls back to look at her. She straightens up and looks at both of them in turn.
They both gave him a confused look but they didn’t say anything else, so Harry could only assume they were reciting his words in their minds.
“Alright, Gin, I understand,” Ron said pointedly, “But I don’t think we should all fawn over him, that’s all.”
“Thanks Ida,” Harry said, giving her a look that he hoped conveyed his gratitude. She looked weary for a moment, but then she gave him a soft smile that lit up her eyes.
Her voice cracked at this last part. Ginny’s words echoed in his head. She will always love him. He loved her, too. He really, really did. She was funny, smart and generous. She was everything he could want in a person. She was his best friend.
Draco heaved a great sigh and looked up at Harry, “We need to tell the Aurors. But not all of them. Our best bet would be to tell only one or two of them, people we truly trust, so that we have the resources of the Auror department without risking the entire ministry knowing about the poison.”
“And you cheated without telling me,” Harry said deliberately, “We’ve both been leading our own lives, haven’t we?”
“That’s how Aries got so wasted he told our Lola that she was ‘uglier than the average naked mole rat’” Ida commented disapprovingly.
Harry wasted no time. As the defenseless Auror squirmed with pain on the ground, he jumped on the back of the Kareach member, who thankfully wasn’t very large, and managed to push them to the ground. The Auror who had been tortured grabbed the wand that had rolled out of the Kareach member’s hand and used it to fire a spell at another Kareach member approaching from behind.
“They would have,” Ida said, “But somehow, somehow, only you two did that. We’ve been planning for months to take out Draco. The main purpose of the hospital attack wasn’t to poison, but to kill Draco!”
“Healer Brayan?” Harry asked. He noticed Ron shifting awkwardly in the chair besides him. There was no doubt in Harry’s mind that Ron felt immense guilt for allowing Brayan to be falsely accused.
Ida looked like she was fighting down a few choice words that would get her fired just as quickly as telling Harry about cases. “But sir” she gritted out, “Surely there is someone else I could work with? I actually talked to Remmins about being my partner and he seemed interested.”
Aviary looked as if she was tempted to laugh, which definitely raised Harry’s spirits. Being fussy about the room they were about to figure out a plan to take down a bunch of murders in was such a Draco move that things almost felt normal. Harry supposed Draco was doing it on purpose, if only to give Harry and Aviary a small laugh for a moment.
“I’m fine, Hermione,” he thought about this for a second, then shook his head, “Actually, no I am not. Fine, I mean. I need someone to say something rather big and confusing to and I was hoping it could be you. Well, I already told someone, but this someone isn’t an overly nurturing type. I mean, they were plenty accepting, but not overtly helpful…”
“It’s true,” Fleur piped up from a few chairs away, “He could barely speak French. Viktor also said his Bulgarian was frightful as well.”
He moved to pull her into another hug when he heard a knock at the bedroom door. He immediately was full with worry. His kids had been sleeping for hours, so Ginny and Harry hadn’t put up any silencing charms before talking. Whatever kid had heard their conversation was bound to be even more upset than before.
“That’s great news!” Hermione said. She was sitting in the chair next to his bed. Ron was sitting on the floor in front of her with his back propped against her legs. The two of them had been in the room for the past ten minutes. They had been in plenty of times the day before to see Harry, but they had promised to come back the following day to spend some time as just the three of them. Maybe this time it hadn’t been the three of them saving the day together, but without saying they knew they needed this. It always came back to the three of them.
“As long as I give Parvati or Lavender away, I guess I’d be fine with not getting to be maid of honor,” Seamus looked at Parvati imploringly.
“And we are all old enough to know,” James added, “We know that not everything that happens is peaches and cream!”
Harry huffed, “Well, just so you know, I think you should show people! Or even sell them! You could do something where you don’t have to keep the profit and you could give it to a charity or something.”
Harry thanked her and made his way around the house saying goodbye to the rest of his family. He then stepped out into the yard to apparate, mind envisioning the large park in the center of his neighborhood.
Harry was part relieved at this statement and part horrified. Settling for horrified, Harry said quickly, “That had nothing to do with it! I felt a bit queasy so I quickly apparated home. Thankfully, I feel much better now so it’s nothing to fret about.”
“I am not!” Roxanne cried, turning to her brother, “You’re just jealous I’ve gotten all the Sorry cards so far in the game!”
“Ginny,” he broke the silence, “I don’t hate you for cheating. You’re right. I have been distant and just plain terrible for a while now.”
“Sorry, Dean,” Harry muttered, forcing himself to look into the eyes of his concerned friend, “I just had a rough rotation. I am listening.”
“Yes,” Aviary jumped in, clearly excited at a new bit of evidence, “We have been able to use our wands to pick up traces of what wand has been used to cast the Imperius curse!”
“Harry,” Draco’s voice came out rough but strong, “Hold an anapneo while I finish these next round of charms.”
“Not all of it!” Aviary countered, swatting his arm, “You hadn’t even heard of bug bombs before I brought them up!”
“I do like being called bes,” Harry noted, “It roughly translates to “best friend’, correct? Meaning you think of me as your nearest and dearest friend?”
“They aren’t here?” Harry asked. He had assumed they were outside setting up for lunch. The weather had completely transformed itself from the previous day’s gloom, with promising sunshine and the delightful dregs of what had been a surprisingly warm autumn.
“Of course!” Harry exclaimed, “Angelina said she was always confused about how Reyes seemed to buy so much stuff for the team and yet they were still short on basic things, like spare clothes, at practices!”
“Anyway, what did happen?” Harry attempted to lessen the tension in the room, “Don’t tell me you agreed to a quidditch match with that prat?”
Al obliged, glowering as he threw James’s scarf at him and encouraged Scorpius in another attempt to get a triple back flip as Rose rolled her eyes at the lot of them.
“There’s a difference between ex-Slytherins and ex-bigots,” Aviary said fiercely. Harry looked at her, surprised. This was the harshest he had ever heard her talk to anyone.
Harry felt a pang of guilt as he wondered if Ginny was upset over the fact he was leaving so late or whether she knew he was lying. Either way, Harry decided he needed a night to himself. He hadn’t been to his favorite pub,The Leaky Cauldron (which had been redone in the past couple years and was nothing like the grimy place Harry had first encountered years ago on his first trip to Diagon Alley), in longer than he could remember. Harry reasoned with himself. He needed a night out to clear his head and remove himself from everything. Tomorrow night he would spend time with Ginny and the kids. After telling Ginny and Lily goodnight, he walked upstairs to appear as though he was going to change into his healer scrubs. Once in his room, he pulled out his wand and focused on the outside of the Leaky as he began to feel the air compressing around him…
She shut the bathroom door without addressing Harry, sending a clear message of general unhappiness with him. Harry decided to wait in his room until she came out. He dressed in his green trainee scrubs and then sat on the bed to wait.
Angelina turned to Harry and rolled her eyes, “I’m not sure how I feel about this game, Harry. It has seemed to turn my kids against each other.”
After he sat down, Aviary asked him to explain what had happened at the hospital earlier that day. Harry told them of how he had been eating with Dean when suddenly he fell onto the floor. He described his attempts to help, voice catching when he told them how Draco showed up to help. He then described how the room went dark. Harry tried to avoid anything that made it sound like his main goal was to help Draco; he had already seen Ron’s reaction to that, he didn’t need anymore questions about his relationship with Draco. After he finished his story, ending with how he was hit with a stunning spell, Aviary spoke again.
Harry stared at Luna in amazement. She said this all as if it were obvious. He sometimes forgot how observant and bright she really was. Without saying anything, he gave a short nod. Luna sighed and patted his arm softly.
He pushed away from her, “How can you hug me? I just admitted I’ve been unfaithful to my wife, your best friend, Ron’s sister!”
“Harry, you were right about there being more than one attacker. When the Aurors arrived on the scene, we could clearly see the vast amount of killing curses being fired.”
His whole body froze at the mention of his name. Everything became too real; telling people he was queer was one thing. Having Hermione know this queerness was directed almost exclusively towards Draco Malfoy was another. All of a sudden the feelings, thoughts, desires were out in the open. He couldn’t hide anymore.
“Yes,” Ida agreed, “But not our priority at the moment. We could be closer to finding a solution to stopping all of this.”
Harry tried to hide his surprise at the fact Draco had still wanted Harry to be kept up to date on things that happened with the case. He had thought Draco would permanently cut him out of the investigation after their fight.
Ginny must have been thinking the same thing, because she looked as worried as Harry felt, “Come in!” she called.
Relief flooded through him at these words, but Harry knew by Ron’s expression that there was still something he wasn’t telling him.
The room erupted in bouts of shocks and screams. Harry pointed his wand at his throat and said Sonorus to magnify his voice, “No one eat anything!” he yelled. He bent down to try and help Dean, but there wasn’t much he could do as an inexperienced trainee. Around the room, shouts rang as more muggleborns collapsed. Commotion was thick as he racked his brain for any available spells to keep Dean alive. He was keeping his panic internalized. What mattered now was his friend.
Healer Patrick moved swiftly past him and closed the door behind her with a wave of her wand. Harry quickly followed, having to take long strides to keep up with her urgency. She wasn’t even a particularly tall woman, but she walked at a pace faster than Harry thought possible without being considered a run. As they walked, she began to talk.
“I understand,” Healer Patrick said sympathetically, “However, now that you all know she is okay, I’m going to need you to clear out to give her the space she needs to recover.”
“Okay, two! Whatever. At least I’m not the fucking Prophet who won’t even take Kareach seriously anymore. Or the Aurors, who think it’s all silly rumors. I’m the only one who cares, who understands. So,” Harry paused as he realized Draco was bent over in laughter, “Why the fuck are you laughing?”
Harry looked at the portrait in surprise. He had never heard Walburga talk so kindly. She began to look almost excited as she realized who Draco was, something Harry could have never imagined on a face he had grown accustomed to having scream at him.
“Since when is everyone best mates with Blaise Zabini?” Harry wondered half to himself and half to Dean.
“I didn’t want him to have you. I thought I did, at first. But then I realized you were our hope. You were good in a world where nothing felt good anymore. So I couldn’t let him have you,” Draco said all of this to a space behind Harry on the wall.
Between Ginny and Blaise was their own daughter, Vella. Vella had been born about a year before, making her almost the same age as Lacey. Seamus and Dean had adopted Lacey a little less than a year ago.
With those words ringing throughout the small lift, the doors opened and Harry and Draco rushed into the hall, yelling for people to follow them out. Harry’s desire and anger faded away as he redirected his attention to getting people to safety. Once he and Draco had delivered the entirety of the first floor (except for Kingsley, the Minister of Magic) to the Great Hall safely, they made their way back towards the lift to head to the second floor.
“And you didn’t think to tell me?” Ida snapped, her expression odd. She looked partly angry and partly… upset? Worried? Harry suddenly felt guilty for not telling her. Did Ida think he didn’t trust her?
They remained silent on the ride to the second floor. Harry was out of the lift as soon as the doors opened, Draco closely behind him as they made their way over to the group of Aurors surrounding Savant’s office.
“I understand you’ve had a stressful last couple of days,” she said, “But you can’t just make up some excuse and sneak off to a bar. We could have planned a trip to the bar with Ron and Hermione if that’s what you needed.”
“Yes, we hated each other,” Harry relented, “But things have changed. Actually, he apologized to me about everything that happened at school. Even all the Death Eater stuff,” he finished in a whisper.
“They're expecting you,” Ron murmured to Harry as they closed the door behind them, “I’m going to go and check on Padma. Rana meant so much to her. I feel like a bloody awful Auror and friend.”
“Aviary?” Harry rushed towards her side and grabbed her arm. She looked as if she was about to faint, but as Harry touched her, she pushed him back and shook her head violently.
“You must have been a bloody terrific student,” Harry commented, “My guess is Madam Pomfrey takes nothing but the best.”
Padma and Ron exchanged looks, “We had twenty casualties,” Padma said heavily, tears shining on the corners of her eyes, “One of them being my cousin.”
His insides were burning with the need to help, to fight this, but none of that mattered. Harry watched, his heart hammering, as the Kareach member turned slowly around to face Harry once again. With excruciating slowness, the figure reached for his mask and revealed his face. Standing before Harry was Aries Reyes.
“I am at St. Mungos with Draco. We both are safe. Draco knows the best way to revive victims. Please apparate people to the Mungos canteen straightaway,” Harry said. He then focused on his patronus reaching his friends fighting at the quidditch pitch.
“Harry’s right, Aviary,” Ron interrupted, “You need to be protected. So do any other muggleborns in the Auror department. We can’t lose any more innocent lives that are in our control.”
Ida sighed and threw her arm around Harry, “Typical Harry bloody Potter. Never listening until the conversation is about him.”
“Honestly, I should probably be at Mungo’s by now,” Harry admitted, “But I would much rather talk to my two favorite Aurors.”
“You act like their kids are monsters,” Seamus teased, appearing at Dean’s side and smiling at his guests.
“I didn’t sign some kind of binding contract, now did I?” Malfoy pointed out, signaling the bartender once again for another glass of wine.
Feigning mock offense, George responded, “And let my store run itself into the ground? I thought we were mates!”
“What if someone else was in the room?” Harry asked, “Disguised so that no one knew they were there? That way all the Aurors were fooled. That was probably the same person who killed Remmins!”
“We would be honored!” Angelina chimed in, as the girls around the room chorused their own agreement.
Harry stared at Brayan, his mouth slightly agape. He knew Brayan was wrong. Hermione had solved almost all of their problems at Hogwarts by looking tirelessly through books. For Brayan to tell Harry that trying to help find the poison was a complete waste of his time was both ignorant and suggested ill judgement as an instructor. Harry, realizing he had to answer despite his rising anger, said with little inflection in his words, “I will focus on my studies, sir. What else can I help you with?”
“I’m dedicated!” Harry insisted, “I already told you I am! That doesn’t mean we aren’t allowed to spend any time on our personal lives.”
After about twenty minutes of talking to Seb, Harry had to cut him short in order to head back to his job. He made plans with Seb to meet for a tea the following week before the man walked away to go to a nurse he recognized from his time as a patient. Harry watched Seb rush over to the nurse and immediately embrace the surprised man in a hug. He laughed softly; Seb really was the brightest man he had ever met. Turning away, Harry made his way towards the third floor, where the trainees were scheduled to meet in five minutes. He was walking towards the lift when he spotted Draco standing near the entrance of the canteen, scanning the room intently as if he was looking for someone.
Harry walked into St. Mungo’s canteen, the bright lights of the large room immediately contrasting the residual gloom from outside. The smell of today’s chips wafted from the kitchen, making Harry’s stomach growl in protest. It was late afternoon, so the canteen was relatively empty except for a couple Healer’s enjoying a quick break. Harry recognized Dean Thomas, a close friend of his, and he immediately waved and began to gravitate towards his friend until he remembered he was going to be late for the real reason he was at the hospital on his day off. He gave Dean a quick, “see you tomorrow” and headed for one of the conference rooms located off of the canteen.
Hermione nodded, “I know. It means nothing from me. But we both have been having hellish weeks. That’s actually why I wasn’t there tonight; I had a meeting I couldn’t miss and I had planned to come over afterwards but I was caught up for hours. I came over as soon as Ron told me the story.”
“How can you say that?” Ginny said, “I’ve had intense feelings of longing and confusion as well for a long while! I’ve fought them off for so long because I didn’t want to mess up what we have. You’re still my best friend, Harry. No matter what. And I made a mistake. But if you have feelings for some other woman, how is that any different?”
Dean began to argue, but Harry rushed towards them, Draco and Ron hoisting up Hermione behind him, “I agree,” he said hurriedly to Dean, “Get to safety at Mungos and take Hermione with you.”
“Tosh, Ron!” Seamus said heartily, “of course it’s alright! How are you, Padma, Ida and…” he paused, not recognizing Aviary, “I don’t think we’ve met?”
It took only a moment before the three of them moved into action, grabbing their things and moving swiftly towards the door. Once outside, the three of them apparated without speaking, appearing a moment later in front of the phone booth.
Harry back away in alarm, “To see if you are alright,” he said defensively, “I saw you leave your seat and I assumed the worst.”
Harry nodded, “Yes. And we need you to believe that what is going on is more than just Ida, Aviary.”
“The cooks sure know what they are doing,” he said. He followed this statement with another large bite of pie.
“I am taking that as a compliment.” Angelina said as she began to walk towards Lily, who was now shouting her name repeatedly.
“Don't flatter yourself, Malfoy. You're not using me. It was my idea, remember?” Harry forced himself to look Malfoy in the eye.
Harry began to explain what had happened, but Aviary cut him off, “Harry, I need to know why I should trust Draco with this information. I have no reason to trust him as of right now, so I really don’t want you telling him something that could put me and so many other people in danger.”
Harry watched as Aviary, still teary-eyed, locked eyes with Draco and nodded. Harry tried to focus on this solely and not the fact Draco had hesitated when talking about someone he would be devastated to lose.
Padma rolled her eyes at her sister while Lavender told her girlfriend,“Get a grip, Parv. Even if you have a crush on Blaise, you’re stuck with me.”
Harry gave a small sigh of relief. That made things easier. He just needed to accept that he and Draco were now friends, and partners of sorts. Harry could go and talk to Draco today and apologize for being a git and ask how the stakeout went. Harry was just about dying in anticipation. Although Harry didn’t know what Draco had been staking-out, Harry could tell Draco had been beyond excited about it. He felt pangs of guilt as he pictured Draco alone, somewhere dark and vacant, searching for potential members of Kareach while Harry had been sulking at home. Harry needed to make his allegiance to the investigation clear and get past whatever awkwardness came with their new friendship. He had been feeling more alive in the past couple weeks than he had in months, maybe years. Even his job, despite how boring some training activities could get, seemed brighter, more purposeful. He loved to heal; he never regretted leaving the Aurors. But he did regret leaving the Imperius attacks behind without a strong lead or substantial evidence. This partnership with Draco was the way to do that. Harry decided that he would talk to Draco immediately after training today.
“Just act like I’m supposed to be here,” the person muttered. Harry could recognize that drawling voice anywhere. He turned to his right to look into the face of Draco Malfoy. His hair, blonder than ever, was drooping across his piercing blue eyes. He gave Harry a bright smile that made his whole face light up and made Harry’s brain spiral into overdrive. Malfoy reached out and placed his hand on Harry’s arm and gave a chirpy laugh. What in the hell was going on?
“Well,” Ginny pulled back and looked at him, “Fuck him. Fuck Ron. Fuck anyone else who treats us like shit. We are going to figure this all out. And we will always have each other for moments like this.”
Draco nodded. He looked reluctant yet determined, so Harry chose to trust that he would do as Harry had said. Harry reversed the shield and handed Draco’s wand back to him. A moment later, Hannah appeared with a young blonde woman in her arms. The woman was turning a bright orange and shaking uncontrollably. Draco immediately took her from Hannah, instructing Harry what to do as he lay her on the ground and began his round of spells. When the woman stopped shaking, Harry took this as his chance. He used a sonorus spell to magnify his voice, hoping he had properly learned to create one that reached all throughout the hospital.
Harry began to cry without meaning to, tears pouring down his face as he turned away from Draco’s intense stare. He couldn’t tell him what he had done, he just couldn’t.
“It’s a good plan, Harry,” Aviary reassured. She was sitting in an armchair in the corner of the room. Draco was perched elegantly on the edge of it. Both of them were waiting for Harry to make a firecall as he sat with a handful of floo powder in his hand.
“He has tried to follow in his father’s footsteps since your defeat of Voldemort. Get this; years and years ago, just after the second wizarding war, he went to Cambodia to search for this rare poison he had heard about from his father.”
“Then why leave? I heard it was because you thought Granger-Weasley had a particular scent to him that you just couldn’t ignore enough,” Malfoy was smiling quite annoyingly.
“No,” Harry countered, “No, a good Auror doesn’t accuse an innocent person who also happens to be the best friend of my…”
Harry looked back towards the door where Draco was standing, “Draco confirmed it! And he studied Chann in Cambodia.” Harry stood up and moved away to allow Ron to hug his wife, both crying uncontrollable tears of joy. Harry watched them for the moment: the relieved Ron and Hermione and the confused but crying Rose until he turned back to the door. Draco was still standing there, one hand on the doorframe as he watched Ron and Hermione. When he saw Harry was looking at him, however, he looked quickly away and slipped out the door without another word.
After landing on Ida, he felt the familiar sensation of the world disintegrating around him and his body feeling as if what people squeezed into an infinitesimally small space. He realized, with growing panic, that Ida had apparated as soon as Harry touched her.
Malfoy finished talking, a bit breathless, and grabbed his glass to quickly drain the dregs of his wine. He looked fierce, determined. Harry had never thought Malfoy was capable of working so hard at anything that didn’t directly benefit himself. He seemed to care an immense amount about finishing his report and working to stop the attacks. Harry didn’t know how to process this new, moral abiding Malfoy.
“Not right now, you don’t,” came a frantic voice from behind Harry. He turned around and was immediately confronted by a thick scent of strawberries and a face full of bright red hair.
“Yes, of course,” Draco answered, “Dark Wizards of this prestige can detect magical ways of ‘bugging’ a room. But what they never anticipate is muggle technology, as they often believe anything muggles invent is pointless and far beneath them.”
“Yes, you are,” Ginny said with a soft smile, “But you did hit your head on one of the boards in the room. The healer told us it’s nothing to worry about, but you have to take it easy until the swelling settles. So no jumping out of this bed and running around with excitement.”
Harry froze. He and Seb had gone to get tea twice since they talked in the canteen. Harry had enjoyed himself and he had mentioned it to Ida, but he had been so obsessed with Draco and the investigation lately that he hadn’t thought about the tea outings as anything more than two new friends getting to know each other. He supposed he did find Seb attractive, but he was nothing compared to Draco. Yet as Harry looked at Ida’s expectant face, he figured it was best to let her believe Seb was Harry’s sexual awakening for the time being.
When it came time for him to go home, he finally felt some sense of relief. He would get to go and see his kids and hopefully forget about his troubles for a while as he basked in their happiness and youthful energy. As he pulled out his wand to apparate, he realized that he didn’t have his jacket. It was one Molly had gotten for him, and he felt guilty leaving it behind. He reasoned it must be up in the canteen and took the lift to the fifth floor to search.
“Of course, Molly,” Harry reassured, giving her what he hoped was a convincing smile, “Why wouldn’t it be?”
“Harry, I guess that’s up to you,” Draco said firmly, “I don’t think anyone should know yet, as much as that pains me, but I can’t ask you to keep something like this from your friend.”
Everyone laughed as Ginny pulled them in once again for a group hug. For the first time in months, Harry was starting to truly believe that everything was going to be alright.
“Charming,” Patrick said, taking the bottle of cure from Harry and pouring it into a large cup on the table in front of her.
“Harry… Harry?” A voice broke through Harry’s deafening thoughts. He looked up to see Seamus standing next to him.
Harry was stopped from responding to Caser as a Healer came hurrying over to him and the rest of the group, who had filed into the main room of the Ground Floor.
The door opened and James appeared in the door. Harry couldn’t help but smile at his son’s morning hair. It was so reminiscent of Harry’s in its absolute refusal to stay in any singular direction. While James may have inherited Harry’s hair, his face was all Ginny’s. Everything from his bright blue eyes to rounded face suggested his mother.
That was about the last thing Harry had thought he would say, “How could any of that had made sense? We trusted Ida! She is one of the last people I would have suspected to be in Kareach!”
The room broke into chaos at this statement. Rose, Al and Ron all turned to Harry in shock and rage.
Harry pushed open the door and began to say hello to Blaise, whose whole arm was in a cast, when he spotted Draco sitting at the side of Blaise’s bed. An angry feeling began to coarse through his body, one he couldn’t identify. Draco had looked as if he had been in the room for a long while; his coat, shoes and scarf were left in various places, and he had a stack of books next to himself. How good of friends were they? Why was this upsetting to Harry?
Sure enough, just like Ida, Savant and Aviary, Draco was still awake in the dead of night (or the dead of morning, as it was almost four thirty).
To his surprise, Draco didn’t say anything else. As Harry pulled out his wand and prepared to leave, new tears building in his eyes, he whispered,
Harry rushed over to the fireplace. Before making a call, he cast silencing charms around the room. The last thing he needed was Ginny or any of his kids overhearing his suspicions.
Harry internally began to panic; Malfoy, here? After their drunken conversation only a week ago, Harry had no idea where they stood. Malfoy had seemed to regret everything he told Harry about Kareach, so Harry wasn’t giddy to face the bloke again.
Draco nodded, “I was thinking the same thing. I know Granger- Weasley would never be involved in anything like Kareach. I don’t know Padma well enough, though. That’s why I was hesitant to bring her up in the first place. Is it safe to trust more than just Granger- Weasley?”
“I sincerely have no idea, Harry,” Ron sighed heavily as he sat down on the couch, “I hope you don’t mind if I sit. I haven’t sat down in what feels like days.”
“Right,” Ron said, “Aviary said that Remmins went home after they viewed the memory. She went to check on him about thirty minutes later, as he said he would only be gone for ten. Aviary walked into his house and was about to call out Remmins’s name, when she heard someone else talking. She said this person was threatening to kill Remmins if he didn’t tell everyone he was wrong about Brayan being under the Imperius curse.”
“Are they okay?” Harry asked urgently, realizing he hadn’t seen them since Hermione’s hospital room, which could have been hours ago.
“You are all ridiculous,” Fleur pointed out as she walked over with Dom, “Dom and I are cheering for both teams.”
Harry tried not to look taken aback as he answered, “I didn’t know it was a team interview,” trying to keep any aggression out of his voice in front of Malfoy’s son.
Harry nodded, tears coming to his eyes before he could stop them. The thought of telling Dean and Seamus any of this terrified him. What if they were still seriously considering surrogacy? Of course they could adopt again, but what if that’s not what they wanted? They didn’t deserve to have this taken away, regardless of their situation.
Harry made his way across the canteen to Malfoy. He arrived at his side, fully expecting Malfoy to turn and acknowledge him. Harry hated to admit it, but Malfoy’s muggle style really fit him. He was wearing a long grey coat that was well suited to his smart black shoes and pants. Putting these observations out of his head, Harry cleared his throat in order to get Malfoy’s attention.
“I don’t think so, Harry,” Ida said, “It’s much more likely they never realized Aurors could detect the number of wands being used. And besides, it doesn’t really help us determine anything, so what would be the point of concealing it anyway?”
Harry nodded, “You’re right,” he whispered, “I should have told them right away. I just couldn’t imagine getting that kind of news before I had any kids of my own. It’s heartbreaking.”
She shook her head, “I can’t believe he did all that. I can’t believe you did all that. Without telling me.”
He looked directly at Harry as he said this, making Harry feel unnerved. Harry let out a laugh and answered, trying to sound normal, “We couldn’t have that.”
“And I love her!” George insisted, “But my wife is a quidditch player. Going against her team would be some kind of marital crime.”
As Harry turned to walk down the corridor, hoping to kill some time before apparating to the very meeting he was dreading, he spotted the perfect distraction. Padma was walking down the hallway towards her office, a large pile of papers balanced precariously on her arms.
“Yes,” Scorpius answered, “He has started to work with muggle newspapers so it only made sense for him to start using their form of communication,” he continued, giddy now,  “I only wish I could have one! I mean, owl post is wonderful, but I have many friends in school who have never even heard of owl’s being used for delivering letters!”
“What do you mean?” Ron had made his way out of the group hug and was now standing up next to his sister.
Laughing, Harry dives into a conversation with Hermione about how the French minister’s owl tripped on the windowsill while taking a letter to Hermione. Soon the whole group began listening as Hermione described how she had to bring in her assistant to deal with the owl’s broken leg while Hermione dealt with more owls and floo calls. The conversation soon shifted to how Aviary is liking working at the Ministry.
“Look who’s here!” Padma announced to Ron as she sat down at her own desk and began organizing her paperwork into piles.
“Fine,” Harry stood up and turned around to grab his own chair firmly around the sides. He then picked it up over his head and threw it as hard as he could at the opposite wall. The chair slammed into the wall with an even louder sound than before.
Ron shook his head, “No. Well, at least not yet. There isn’t solid proof that Brayan was even under the Imperius curse. The only person that heard Remmins say any of this was Aviary, and while we all trust her, we can’t place our head Auror and two of our best Aurors on trial for something they most likely are not a part of.”
Harry couldn’t believe this. While he was fretting over whether or no Draco liked him or whether them having a relationship was even a good idea, his kids had decided for him that Draco was the right decision. When did his children become so wise, so mature? For goodness sake, Lily was only three, and she was processing a divorce and her parents’ new relationships much better than he was.
Brayan nodded, tears beginning to fall down his cheeks, “Yes. Oh, Harry, you know how fantastic she was. Everything she did was for this hospital. She was one of the best Healers this hospital had ever seen. She gave her life to help save as many innocent lives as possible, and for that, we need to all remember in the best possible light.”
As he said it, Harry realized it was true. Harry had left the Ministry feeling completely lost and angry. Without thinking, he had gone to the place he needed. Where his kids were.
“None of this matters,” Ida put in, “We have solid reasons to believe that Blaise could be responsible for these attacks. He’s a pureblood, raised in a household that took blood purity extremely seriously. Trust me, as a pureblood from one of the oldest wizarding families, I know which families to watch out for. Aside from the Blacks and the Malfoys, the Zabinis have historically been the most influential wizarding family. Blaise has been raised with bigoted ideals, and while that doesn’t prove he committed anything, these pieces of evidence do. We need to bring him in.”
Draco shook his head and began to walk across the room to the door, “Personally, I don’t think there’s anything to talk about. I had a moment of weakness. I shouldn’t have lost control of myself like that. But I was sad, and lonely, and you were there with supportive, and well,  friendly, words.”
“I’ll explain,” Draco cut in before Harry could speak, “I’ve been working on an investigative paper for the prophet on the organization Kareach. I have believed for years that Kareach is a real threat to the wizarding world. I ended up talking Harry about it after the Prophet told me not to research the topic any longer, and we decided to work on it together.”
Before Harry had to dive into this discussion, Seamus spoke, “Both Oliver and Ginny are the best coaches/captains this league has to offer,” he paused for emphasis, “Which is why I, personally, am beyond excited for the upcoming championship match!”
He looked back over to Ginny, but she had bent over her own pile of vegetables, evidently not interested in addressing Harry.
Harry could feel tears forming in his eyes, “I’m sorry. For everything I did that was stupid. Especially accusing Blaise. That was never supposed to be spiteful, I really need you to know that.”
“The only problem with your interview was the pointlessness of its existence,” Malfoy deadpanned, “And I’m here to write another article, that miraculously isn’t on you.”
“Gin…” Harry whispered, his heart pounding. He couldn’t have a real, honest talk with her now, even if he had promised her just that. He didn’t have it in himself to lie to her anymore.
“You think I would if I had a choice?!” Aviary asked fiercely, “There’s no other choice! She’ll know I’m on to her if I don’t go back!”
Molly nodded, not looking entirely convinced, “Well, Harry, you know you can talk to me whenever you need, right?”
Saying Draco looked stunned was an understatement. After a moment, Draco placed his arms awkwardly around Ron and looked at Harry in confusion. Ron pulled back and began thanking Draco.
“So you both cheated?” Ron accused, “Great. Glad to know both of you threw a healthy marriage away for two Slytherins,” Rose began to wail at this, to which Ron looked away in shame.
Harry nodded and let Ron help him stand up, head still spinning slightly from the stunning spell. Once he was steady, Ron led him over to a group of Aurors standing at the front of the canteen. They were casting spells and bagging evidence in stoic silence, the events of the attack weighing heavily on them.
All he could see was white before a sharp pain reverberated throughout his body. Despite his desperation to stay conscious, he could feel his mind easing away from him...
“Look, Scorpius is right there!” Al pointed to his right, “I’ll ask if you can talk to him so you can understand where I'm coming from.”
“Okay,” Harry said hesitantly, grabbing a shot as the bartender slid it his was, “But let the record show I’m still going to be friends with Draco.”
“Good heavens, no!” Seb exclaimed, “I really was never very good. I found a new passion, thankfully. I’m a magical non-human rights activist.”
“Okay,” Ida pulled a hair tie around the end of her braid and looked at him, a concerning look of determination brewing in her dark eyes, “I have a friend. We almost dated, but nothing came of it because he’s not my type. Too cheery, you know? Wouldn’t work with my admittedly darker stance on life.”
“Harry?...” he asked, clearly concerned. There was no doubt Harry looked frantic as he reached for his wand.
At the tea shop, Harry was able to forget about his Malfoy-shaped problem for a while as Seb talked about the protest he was arranging for house-elves. Hermione, of course, had been deeply involved ever since she found out, so Harry and Seb had much to talk about. Seb described how Hermione had come back into her S.P.E.W. organization with extreme force and determination right off the bat, and Harry couldn’t help but laugh when Seb described how the pins she had made for the protest sang a song Rose had written about house-elf rights. This all reminded Harry about how he should turn more to Ron and Hermione when he was feeling as shitty as he had been the past week. They always managed to find so many small ways to cheer him up without even trying. Just hearing about Hermione and Rose brought him a deep relief. Rose hadn’t been over to their house nearly as much lately, what with Harry, Ginny, Ron and Hermione all working harder than ever before at their respective jobs. Rose still saw plenty of his kids, as they spent many nights or days at Molly and Arthur’s whenever their parents were swamped with work, but Harry missed Rose and all his nieces and nephews beyond belief. Even with Sunday lunch (which had been canceled a few times over the last couple months, an usual occurrence for a family who loved to eat and see each other), Harry still felt the absence of his family. Thankfully, Christmas was coming up in a few weeks. Harry felt confident that the focus on family time the holiday provided would help bring his inner and outer family together at a more closer level than they had been at in months.
“You’re the reason I realized… Ginny and I weren’t good for each other,” he finished nervously, “You made me realize what I had been missing in my life.”
“You know it. That one time he sent the bludger into the stands and hit Gonga’s wife? Priceless,” Draco joked. Harry watched the two laugh easily with each other. And Draco was at the match. Harry hadn’t even known about it, and there was no way Ginny hadn’t been there playing. She hadn’t even mentioned Blaise and Aries landing themselves in the hospital. But here was Draco, invited to Blaise’s match and spending the night by his side after his injury. The implications made Harry’s head spin.
“Did something else happen with your investigation?” Seamus said concernedly, “You can tell me, Harry. Dean and I are completely trustworthy.”
Seamus looked thrilled at this question, “Oh, it has been complete chaos! But we wouldn’t have it any other way! I’ve been put in charge of permits which, trust me, is hell on earth. Blaise has been working around the clock to secure a solid venue…”
“It. Was. Not. Blaise.” Draco gritted out, his voice sharp, “I’ve known him my whole life! He wouldn’t have even done something like this back at Hogwarts! He’s a good person, one who cares so much about his job and friends. There is no fucking way it was him!”
Harry had never been inside Draco’s apartment. He had only assumed the wards would hold him, figuring Draco would want Harry to be able to contact him in case of an emergency. He looked around before yelling for Draco. The room was not exactly what Harry had envisioned, but he supposed he should have known by now never to assume anything about Draco Malfoy’s life. Two red couches sat facing the fireplace, accented by soft blue walls and matching red curtains. The floor was dark hardwood, with a cream carpet placed under the two couches. The room had more small knick-knacks than Harry could take in. Everything had some kind of decoration, from the dark coffee table between the two couches to the four shelves lining the walls. Harry spotted many things that indicated travel, from a large black and white globe to countless framed postcards. Being a reporter, a serious one, must have brought him to many places. Harry felt a strange sensation, which he realized was jealousy. Draco had a kid who adored him but still got to live the life he envisioned for himself, the one that shed the dark shadow his family had cast on him. Very few people Harry talked to thought of Draco as an ex-Death Eater anymore. He was just Draco Malfoy, a man who worked for the Prophet and could write a smashing article. Harry wondered where this change started in Draco and why he had yet to ask.
