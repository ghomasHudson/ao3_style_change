“Fuck Harry, honestly,” Draco groaned out and Harry knew he wouldn’t last long. He was also hit with the notion that it was perfectly clear how it had been possible for Draco to come untouched from giving Harry head on his birthday. Looking up at Draco, he was bloody hot, so fucking beguiling he was positive that he could easily come in his pants from looking at Draco alone.

Please let me know what you think! I will post again on Saturday!
“Fuck,” Harry hissed out into Draco’s ear, making his cock twitch in agreement.
“Tuesday,” was all he breathed out, eyes looking up and searching Harry’s. They stayed like that for a moment, taking each other in, in hopeless assessment of how the other felt about
Draco’s eyes searched Harry’s once more, pausing to give the other boy a moment to process.
“This is it,” he said, laying his eyes on Draco, deeming to search, and convey, and telepathically tell Draco everything through eye contact alone. A skillset they had both grown very practiced in.
“Can’t we just feel it out?”
Draco let out a laugh at that as well and looked up to meet Harry’s gaze; green met silver and Harry was compelled to say it again.
It was only just lunch time, and Draco already felt physically and mentally exhausted. He’d spent the entire morning and early afternoon experimenting with the new persona he’d been trying to perfect all summer with Harry. He’d never really tried to be himself around other people, he’d spent most of his formative years learning how to build up walls to conceal his emotions. Now, he felt exhausted from trying to haul them all down and sort through the rubble of what he wanted to project to the world and what felt too personal. He was a mess. Although, he was beginning to understand that who he was with Harry didn’t seem to be something he wanted to share with others. He needed a balance.
“Does it make me a terrible person to be glad that I’m bonded to you, because it means that I’m safe from that fate for just a while longer?”
He knew Draco was too clever to head straight for Ron’s room, knowing full well that neither boy would feel comfortable savoring last moments with Ron in the same room but he’d checked there first anyways and silently cursed himself as he was met with Ron’s waggling eyebrows and cat calls as he exited the room.
Afterwards, Harry was dazed by both his own audacity and tact, as well as Malfoy’s willingness. Or at least Harry was choosing to take Malfoy’s apt sarcasm as acquiescence. He began to realize that while he liked the new game of glancing that they engrossed in, he also missed the repartee they often engaged in before they were both thrown into adulthood. Today had given him a taste of it, and he realized he was looking forward to more.
Before he could continue to dwell on his disappointment for much longer, he felt the warm skin pressed against him begin to shift and knew Harry was waking up. Harry let out a soft groan and buried himself into the crook of Draco’s neck, and the blonde smiled to himself, wondering how they had grown so comfortable with one another, how had they gotten here, how did Draco deserve this? He knew he was becoming addicted and spoiled, and it was only going to make the end of summer that much more agonizing.
“Okay,” Draco replied, and they left it there.
The blonde boy laid there, taking up the old hobby of losing himself in the ceiling tiles as he dreaded the conversation, he was due to have with the headmaster that was surely drawing nearer. He knew his father would be furious with him, as if somehow, he had gotten himself stuck to Potter on purpose just to aggravate him. Draco internally rolled his eyes at his father; he knew there would be consequences for this whether it was his fault or not, but Draco wasn’t stupid. He knew he wasn’t the only one who was going to feel his father’s wrath, and he also knew that his father’s anger grew from his own internal fear of accepting his own punishment from the Dark Lord, a punishment Draco knew he, himself, was only safe from for two more months.
“The Quidditch Pitch,” he replied.
Before Harry could fully process what was happening, he was being pulled by Fred into Quality Quidditch Supplies as he watched Hermione pull Draco further into Diagon Alley away from him.
With that she stood up and followed the gaggle of Weasley’s into the house and left him alone with Harry.
Draco blinked his eyes open, giving Harry one last longing look before they both lost their resolve. Pale soft skin met bronze warmth and both boys let out an audible moan and met each other in a scorching open-mouthed kiss; all tongues and teeth.
It was the first time he’d spoken to him or acknowledged him in the last two days, and Harry couldn’t even begin to count it as a win as the pain began to increase and he doubled over.
Harry let out a sigh, and Draco could feel him shift, probably to run his hand over his face and through his already messy hair. He always did when he was working things out in his mind.
SMUT ensues in this chapter, feel free to skip it if it's not your thing!
(See the end of the chapter for
There is definitely some strong bigoted, vulgar, harsh homophobic language in this chapter! Obviously, not from either Harry or Draco but I wanted to warn you all the same!
“I…” Draco blinked a few times willing himself to just say it.
Harry smiled fondly at the blonde before perching back down to nose along his strained cock. He nuzzled into the junction of Draco’s thigh’s and left open mouthed kisses along his length until the gray eyed boy was writhing and moaning beneath him.
I hope you all love it, the next chapter is very smuttttt!!!! lol so I hope that gives you something to look forward to! <3
Harry dared not to speak, his face open with acceptance and in recognition of what Malfoy was endeavoring to accomplish. Malfoy looked back up into Harry’s eyes meaningfully, “I- I’m sorry Harry.”
year common room gazing at ‘boy wonder;’ head thrown back in a carefree laugh at something Weasley had said. Draco was of course tucked away, not as keen to be caught in his own carefree staring.
“Fuck,” Draco groaned out, dragging his fingers through Harry’s thick, dark, unruly hair.
He’d hardly minded at first, a hoodie here, a t-shirt there and always returned washed, neatly folded, and placed with care back inside his dresser a stark contrast to the rumpled and haphazard piles of clothing Harry stuffed inside without a thought. How could he be cross when the items in question were returned in almost better shape than when originally thieved.
He knew that the other occupants of The Burrow were on to them in some capacity, it’s not like Harry was brilliant at being covert, though it wasn’t from lack of effort. Draco didn’t think that they’d completely found them out, but it would be clear to anyone who watched the both of them interact that they were at the very least friends, and no longer enemies.
At dinner that night Mrs. Weasley had announced that they would finally be making the trek into Diagon alley the following day, and Draco’s first thought was Harry’s belated birthday present. Draco knew Harry wouldn’t be keen to let him out of his sight all day partly because it was clear he was obsessed with the blonde, much to his own delight. But also, in large part because this would be their first time back in the wizarding world since Draco had been forced to spend the summer with Harry and forgo taking the dark mark…and also the bond.
“Oh nothing, Draco was just regaling tales of what it was like to spend two whole months with Harry’s aunt and uncle.”
“Not really, he actually didn’t seem that worried at all. He said, he sort of expected him to have the reaction he did, and that he’d come around soon enough.”
Harry’s hands carded through Draco’s hair, “you’re gonna make me come Draco, fuck.” Draco’s hands slid up to Harry’s hips holding him in place as he took him deeper, moaning around the other boy’s cock as his fingers tightened in his hair. Draco was becoming more desperate as well, his cock so painfully hard he began rutting against their cot to gain some friction.
As they entered the train, they met up with Weasley and Granger who had already settled into one of the familiar compartments. As Draco eased in, next to Harry his mind began to wander once again this time fixating on what the Weasley’s had said.
In reality, Harry did not care in the slightest what film they saw. He was merely hoping for two seats near the back of the theatre, no intention of giving the film his full attention. How could he with the long sharp lines and angles that made up Draco, Harry was growing more and more sure that the blonde would be the death of him, his attention was well and truly shot; consumed with gray eyes and pale smooth skin.
Draco managed a snigger of laughter, but his heart was clenched tight he knew Potter’s tone and the fact that he was still touching him all boded well, but for all he knew it could be the bond thrumming through them that urged Potter to touch him, and it all seemed too good to be true.
It felt like years they stayed put, eyes locked; Draco from his position cross-legged on the bed, and Harry profile towards Draco hand still poised on the knob of the door. The room was so miniscule that there was hardly any space between them, though to Draco it felt like a chasm, and he so desperately wanted to reach out, but he didn’t know if that’s what Harry wanted.
Potter was making it very difficult to focus on the new escape he had chosen for himself, the amount of physical contact was overwhelming him to the point of no return. Literally, when Draco thought he could take no more, Potter began tracing circles on Draco’s right ankle. The ankle that was still resting in Potter’s lap, where Potter himself had placed it. Draco was finding it hard not to just gape, open mouthed and wide eyed at the boy across from him. Draco tried to close his eyes and regroup, he really wanted to focus on his new book, the escape he had chosen specifically to help himself make sense of the Potter feelings that seemed to do nothing but engulf and drown him, especially now.
Draco glanced over at the window and realized the sun had set and when he looked back around the common room it was mostly empty. He briefly made eye contact with Granger who gave him a perceptive half smile, which he returned with wide eyes before quickly averting his gaze which drifted briefly over a snoring Weasley whose head was resting in Granger’s lap. When his eyes come back to Potter, he realizes he is still fully immersed in and invested in the story in front of him. Draco almost begins to let himself feel a sense of pride in the novel he’s chosen for Potter as he obviously likes it, but the feeling doesn’t last long. Ultimately Draco lets his anxiety swallow him, and the fear of the intimacy of sharing this world with Potter. Wondering if Potter will like the same parts as Draco, or what he will think of the ending…it’s too much. Draco instantly gets to his feet gathers up his own book, and without a second glance disappears up to his dormitory to fret without the looming eyes of other’s over whether or not Potter will approve of one of Draco’s acquired worlds.
Oh, but Harry was fond of the scolding. Harry found himself even more fond as Draco tidied up wearing one of his old quidditch t-shirts and a pair of loose-fitting joggers. Everything of Harry’s seemed to eat Draco up which drove him even more mad.
Hello all, I am so very sorry that it has taken me this long to post another chapter. I'm sure as with everyone right now, things have just been so hectic and crazy, so much has changed for the good but it has taken all my time and energy!
He couldn’t take it anymore, he knew he needed to confide in someone, the only rational person on the planet he could think of was Hermione. He knew she would never judge him, she only wanted what was best for him and he knew deep down he could trust her with this. Sure, Ron was his best mate, but he felt certain his brain would implode if he confessed even a small portion of how he’d passed the time with Draco that summer.
It didn’t matter anymore. The decision Severus had made for Draco pretty much paved the way for disownment as he knew he could never go back to that life again. He had never been cut out to be a death eater, and now that he knew what it felt like to be seen by Harry, he knew he could never go back. He could only go forward, which meant making amends with the other people Harry loved, and hoping that it would be enough to make the brunette want to stick around.
Harry felt himself heat more as Draco let out a laugh in response and couldn’t help but smile widely as he watched Draco uncurl and throw his head back as the laughter flushed his cheeks.
Hermione was the only one seated at the table as he entered the room, and upon his entrance looked up from a book she had hidden away in her lap. She graced him with a small smile, and he watched as she folded down the corner of the page she was on and closed the book.
“Well, yeah…I guess everyone knows now.” Harry said exhaling a breath and running his free hand over his face in admission. It wasn’t as if he’d been actively trying to hide it anyways. He was mad for Malfoy, and he was pretty sure everyone had been reading it across his dopey face since they’d gotten there.
As quietly and as unnoticeably as he could, he crossed the room and followed Draco up the stairs, careful to make sure he hadn’t been followed. As he turned the corner, headed towards Ron’s room where he knew they would all be sleeping the next week, he was met by Draco who was exiting the room, and headed for the bathroom.
Without warning, Harry was jolted from his thoughts as he began to feel sort of queasy and light headed. The room started to swirl together, and for a moment he thought that maybe he was being dragged into another one of Voldemort’s sick visions, but he mused that his scar wasn’t hurting like it typically did. He clenched his eyes shut and waited breathlessly for a scene or torture to play out, but it never came. Instead he began to feel a sharp pain deep in his gut making him cry out, and double over in agony. The pain was so intense he almost didn’t realize that Malfoy was suffering in the same way it seemed. Harry tried to look around to see if anyone else appeared to be in the same state, but before he could even turn his head in inquiry another sharp pain shot through him like the cruciatus curse and his vision went stark white.
“Shhh…” he said with a grin he knew was wicked and pushed Draco back against the wall furthest from the staircase.
“Of course, you would find yourself too good to pay attention Potter, though this is the last class of the term, it is an introduction to next term’s lessons and your summer reading.” Snape continued with his usual snarl, reserved just for Harry, “Perhaps if you were seated closer to the front, you’d be more apt to pay attention?” Harry outwardly rolled his eyes, used to this sort of beratement from Snape, and not at all looking forward to his new seating arrangement, even if it was only for the next thirty minutes. “I see there’s a seat next to Draco, you’d be wise to take it, quickly now Potter.” Harry let out a huff but couldn’t find it in himself to argue. “Just go Harry,” Hermione whispered, “it’s the last class, it’s not worth it.” He signed, gave Hermione a look of acceptance and dragged his feet all the way up to Malfoy’s desk and slumped into the seat next to the blonde-haired boy. Malfoy rolled his eyes dramatically at Harry, before turning his attention back to Snape like the teacher’s pet he was.
With one foot hooked behind the brunette’s calf and one arm snaked up the back of his shirt Draco felt he was working deftly at pulling Harry as close to his body as humanly possible. Harry didn’t seem to protest in the slightest as he eagerly pressed into Draco and moaned openly into his mouth. Draco drank it all in, he swallowed every single sound that escaped his full red lips, arched into every single swaying movement, and caressed every inch of exposed skin.
Malfoy mirrored Potter’s sigh from a few moments ago, running his own hand through his hair in a quiet frustration. “Yes, Potter, what an astute observation,” Malfoy spoke with a mild sneer from underneath the hand scrunching up his face without looking at Harry.
“Oh, come on now Potter, that can’t be true. I can’t imagine Granger or Weasley not making a fuss over golden boy’s birthday,” Malfoy retorted with a voice of fond jest.
Harry lifted up still bracketing Draco’s thighs, “Let me make you come, please” and he swears that for all intensive purposes that he intended it to come out unwavering. Instead his voice cracks on the please and he could feel his own cheeks heat and felt completely and utterly at Draco’s clemency.
Draco tries to hide the slight leap in his chest, he doesn’t know why he feels so thrilled at the idea of choosing another book for Potter from his collection, but he suspects it has something to do with the fact that Draco shared a part of himself with another person, and they didn’t immediately reject him. It could also be the fact that their game of glances just accelerated to the next level, but Draco wasn’t willing to openly admit to himself just what that meant to him yet.
Instead, he slyly grabbed hold of the sleeve of Draco’s shirt and gestured towards the staircase.
“Ron, come on. It’s not like that, you know how ‘Mione is, she knew practically before I’d even told her.”
Harry let out another laugh and did as he’d been bid.
Without thinking, and without taking full account as to who might be watching he strode back towards the pair, stopping directly in front of Mr. Weasley. He felt his cheeks heat but kept his nerve.
Harry could do nothing but let out a laugh at that, daring to glance over at Draco from the corner of his eye. Draco’s lips were drawn up in a shy smile and his cheeks a soft shade of pink; Harry’s favorite.
“It’s Malfoy though, Harry, Malfoy!” Draco mused that Weasley was starting to lose it as his whispers became a bit strained.
him, he wasn’t a stalker. But he liked looking at him, particularly, in his relaxed moments like this, laughing. Draco couldn’t really remember the last time he laughed, really laughed, especially like that; head thrown back, tears sneaking out of the corners of his eyes, making Potter’s eyes a remarkably brilliant shade of green. Not that ‘brilliant’ is a word Draco would normally use to describe someone he had spent most of his life hating.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The night of the Halloween feast Granger and Weasley made plans to spend some time alone, leaving Potter on his own with Draco. The two boys decided to spend the evening after the feast reading up in the common room in front of the fire. Draco had already situated himself into his new nook in the corner of the overstuffed sofa and was just beginning to become lost in the book wedged in his lap when Potter flopped down directly next to him. With a sigh Potter propped his socked feet up on the table in front of him and pulled some of Draco’s blanket over onto his own lap and began to read “Stardust,” Draco’s latest prescribed escape.
However, when Draco had finally determined the perfect gift, he knew he’d never be able to get it for Harry in time. He’d only be able to acquire the something he wanted for the brunette in Diagon Alley, or at the very least a wizarding shop, no muggle shop would carry this particular something. Draco knew he would have to settle and wait to pick it up when they ventured out to pick up their school supplies. He would have to settle for giving Harry a special day, and a belated gift, not that he thought Harry would truly mind, he wasn’t someone to care about gifts, he was someone to live in the moment which was one of things Draco genuinely admired about the other boy.
Harry contemplated actually sitting on his side of the sofa so as not to disturb the other boy, reasoning that from that spot he could still peer over at Malfoy from his own book. However, the pull of his desire to feel the other boy’s warmth, and the chance at feeling his skin against his own was too strong to ignore. So, without a second thought he flopped himself down into the spot directly next to Malfoy, pulling some of his blanket into his own lap as always. Harry in a moment of audaciousness pulled Malfoy by the ankles and rested the other boy’s feet in his lap, then pulled his book open and pretended he didn’t feel the heat in his cheeks, or the heat of Malfoy’s eyes on him.
“I want you to know that I’m not apologizing to you just for Harry, although I think without him it would have taken me much longer. I would have still been too afraid to face who I’ve let myself become over the years. Regardless, I’m doing this now for both of us. You and I, I mean. You have never deserved the things I’ve said and of course we both know they aren’t true in the slightest. I’m sorry for the hurt I may have caused you, just know most of it was due in large part of my own jealousy. You are incredibly smart, so smart I’ve often wondered how you ever got stuck with Potter and Weasley as your friends, surely you should have been in Ravenclaw.”
He was suddenly struck with an idea, that he thought just might work.
Harry watched the rose color flush all the way down the blonde’s pale throat enamored.
badges, the crass comments, the sneers but now he’d let himself become consumed by the boy himself; Draco and everything he truly was. Now he could hardly go a moment without being engulfed by long gazes from gray eyes, soft red lips quipped up in a half smile, pale skin pressed against his. Draco enraptured every ounce of his being in a way that was new. Yes, he’d been used to being overwhelmed by Draco but not quite like this. He never wanted it to end. When he was with Draco the looming war didn’t matter, Voldemort didn’t matter, nothing fucking mattered except for Draco’s laugh that always seemed to fill the space around him head thrown back and cheeks flushed.
“I, ugh” … “Harry, It’s not that simple.” Draco sat up fully running his hands through his hair in exasperation once again.  Draco knew Harry was asking him a question, but it was one he didn’t feel he could answer.
“Harry, I’m mad for you. It’s embarrassing to say but I’ve felt this way for quite longer than I’m willing to admit. That night, I was…I had just… I was vulnerable and afraid of how you might react to the fact that I had all the answers to your questions.”
As they pulled apart after a brief moment, Remus held Harry at arm’s length casting him a knowing look. Harry felt himself begin to flush, what exactly did he know? Did he have it written across his forehead? Remus chose not to voice it, content with keeping Harry guessing.
“What?” Draco breathed out, pulling back a bit to look at him again.
year. Many of his former classmates chose to forgo the traditional Hogwarts education as they were still busy mending aching hearts and broken families. Pansy had taken her exams earlier that summer, Blaise was interning in Switzerland, and Greg couldn’t bring himself to even consider coming back without Vincent. Therefore, no one really spared a glance towards him; Draco Malfoy reformed death eater.
“Oh, exactly like your uncle? Must be a picture of kindness and virtue then, yeah?” Draco said with a half-smile, internally chastising himself. Sure, Draco put on a cheeky, bold persona every morning and hid behind the mask of sarcasm and criticism to everyone else but to Potter, to Potter Draco was brutal. Being himself seemed dangerous territory for both boys, as it was uncharted.
“I…me too…” Harry replied, cupping the blonde’s cheeks in his hands and watching as realization dawned on Draco reddening his cheeks further before pulling his face in for another one of those kisses.
As soon as Draco’s shoulders hit the mattress both boys were twice as frenzied as before. Hands, lips, tongues, teeth, arms, legs, skin, skin, skin, it all met in the most delicious of ways. Draco felt his mind let go and let himself get lost in his favorite place; Harry.
They were both left there in the middle of the small bathroom on their knees, pulled together as tightly as their bodies would allow, grinning at each other like complete and utter idiots.
Harry looked down at the book in Draco’s outstretched hand, “I Am the Messenger” Harry stated aloud like a question.
He felt his lips quirk up into a half-smile as Draco pulled him forward, hand gripped tightly on his jumper for an intense moment of lips and teeth and tongues and groans.
“I love you.”
Harry knew at once it was Hermione. He and Draco had been so wrapped up in each other the last few days he’d almost forgotten about the outside world once again, although, this always seemed to be the other boy’s hidden talent; making time stand still. Not that he was complaining in the least.
“What do you want to happen?”
(See the end of the chapter for
….Harry knew he wasn’t typically brilliant with words anyways, but he knew he was shit now. He ran his hand from Draco’s face down his neck, and to the hem of his shirt and felt the other boy shiver, in turn making his own skin prickle. He hesitated for only a moment, before again letting his boldness overtake him, and sliding a hand under Draco’s t-shirt and over the soft warm skin of his stomach. Harry lost himself trailing along all the bumps and ridges, dragging his fingers through the line of hair running from Draco’s navel to the edge of his pajama bottoms and could feel himself blush furiously as Draco made a noise so sensuous, he thought he would burst just from hearing it.
“Oh, come on, you can’t deny it to me. I know that look, I can’t seem to wipe it off my face.” Draco continued with a small smile, “look, your secret’s safe with me. But if we’re being honest, eventually someone is going to figure you out. It definitely won’t be Weasley, but I wouldn’t put it past Harry. He’s more brilliant than he lets on, it may just take him a moment since you know, his head’s a little preoccupied with fit blondes at the moment.”
“Go, on then open it.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He reached for the chain around his neck absentmindedly looking for some reprieve as the bond continued to hum under his skin, he could see Harry’s mop of dark hair ahead of him walking between both Weasley twins. As his fingers closed around the lion, the recesses of his mind dragged him back to whispered confessions behind makeshift Quidditch sheds. Draco begins to wonder yet again about this bond, and what it will mean for the two of them should it not fade as the Headmaster, and Severus instructed.
Apparently, that was the only sort of encouragement Harry needed as he pushed Draco back gently by the shoulders and kissed his parted lips with teeth. Draco felt that perhaps Harry was showing him how he felt in lieu of saying it out loud, maybe they both were.
“I’ve heard back from Hermione.” He watched Draco perk up a little a look of trepidation gracing his soft sleepy face. Of course, after their very intimate and fucking amazing time spent reassuring each other that they had in fact made-up and they did very much love each other,
, glancing at him in those unguarded moments helped to make Harry feel calm as well. So, he vowed not to be too hard on himself, because the was only human.
She finished with a smile, one that made it almost impossible for him not to mirror back. However, in a flash it was gone and replaced with a look so stern he’d felt as though he’d been slapped, and it really wouldn’t have been the first time.
Harry sat up, cross-legged and fully faced the other boy, his heart beating madly. Perhaps, in the least likely of all places, Harry had found someone he could share this burden with. He urged Malfoy on with his eyes, not daring to speak in fear that it would break the spell and the blonde would fall silent. After all, Harry knew that either of them sharing this part of themselves with the other was risky business, and it meant mustering up a large amount of courage as well as, taking a leap of faith.
He continued his path down Harry’s torso, dipping his tongue into the brunette’s navel before nipping at the hem of the other boy’s pajama bottoms, looking up into the emerald green eyes wordlessly asking permission.
Before either boy could even open the door of the car, Potter’s uncle whipped his head around the seat to peer back at them with beady black eyes, “straight up to your room, the lot of you, I want silence. This whole ordeal has really taken a toll on your Aunt and she needs her rest before Dudley returns from Smelting’s tomorrow, you hear me boy?” Draco felt his eyes widen in response, but continued to stay silent, he’d never imagined that in a million years the beloved by all Harry Potter was not as equally adored at home. “Yes, Uncle Vernon,” was Potter’s curt response before opening his own door and going to the back for his school trunk. Draco followed Potter closely and silently as they dragged their trunks up the stairs to the other boy’s room. Draco was unused to doing things this way, he usually had a house elf to greet himself as well as his parents as they all arrived home from the station, who would apparate his trunk up to his room for him.
Once again Draco was pulled from his thoughts, but not before he could consider just how often he had let himself zone out in Potter’s presence. “This is weird, Malfoy, isn’t it?” Harry asked with a tilt of his head, Draco deliberated that there was no malice in his voice, just pure confusion and that, that Draco could relate to. “Yeah, this is weird Potter,” Draco replied with the same tone the other boy had used.
Draco knows that something has shifted between the two of them, he can feel it, and he begins to let his heart dare to dream a little if only for just a continued friendship with Potter. He knows that he could never let his heart hope for anything further, Potter was straight after all, and friendship was more than enough, and truly all his eleven-year-old self ever wanted anyways. Although, his eleven-year-old self didn’t know he was gay at the time, he ruminated to himself only slightly sarcastically.
“We’re just discussing the very extensive book list for this terms classes,” Hermione spoke matter of factly, and Draco had never been more grateful to her in that moment; lying to Harry was not something he felt he’d be proficient in…anymore at least.
Draco found that he wasn’t entirely awake, if he were, he would certainly be more startled by Harry’s presence there, in his room,
.” At this Potter looks up at Draco and gray meet green.
Harry left Draco’s room in awe of the other boy, and how staggering he was. He turned and leaned in against the door frame leading into Draco’s room, giving the boy a tender gaze. Draco leaned in against the frame as well and lifted his hand up to smooth a few of the unruly locks of Harry’s hair away from his green eyes. Harry leaned his face into Draco’s palm, and turned his face to kiss the boy’s palm before pulling away. Harry knew this wasn’t saying goodbye, he didn’t think he had the physical or emotional strength to say goodbye to the striking boy in front of him even if he wanted to, which he didn’t. However, he truly respected Draco for having the patience to sort through what this all meant before diving in head first. He supposed that it would force himself to do the same, which he ruminated that he probably needed.
Although, that morning Draco couldn’t be bothered to care about the frenzy that was probably taking place downstairs. He was adrift in the warmth of Harry, curled up into his side, face buried into the crook of his neck. For a brief moment Draco had the idle thought that he shouldn’t move, shouldn’t touch for fear of waking the sleeping brunette. However, when faced with the daunting day ahead the thought instantly vanished and he arched into Harry’s warmth pulling him into his arms more snugly, basking in the feel of their skin touching, the prickle of the bond humming through his veins.
The prattish, blonde-haired boy was laying on his back in the bed directly next to Harry, staring wide-eyed at the ceiling. Harry thought briefly how that seemed to be an effective way to avoid eye contact, but before he could attempt to slink down and immerse himself in the ceiling tiles, he heard Dumbledore clear his throat drawing Harry’s eyes back to the headmaster.
While, it wasn’t so difficult to fall in with the other Weasley boys who seemed to possess a similar sense of humor, it didn’t shake the bundle of anxiety that had been steadily forming in his stomach all day. He didn’t want to say the wrong thing or make an arse of himself as he had been so apt at doing in the past. For the first time in his entire life he wanted to work at letting people in instead of immediately freezing them out with his cold callousness.
Then Draco turned on Potter’s cousin, “you’ve made it clear you’re afraid of gays, all your snide little remarks every morning as we’re making your breakfast, keep it up and people are going to start to think you’ve got something to hide,” Draco said with his own signature smirk, “oh, and trust me if I were the reason your cousin was screaming in the middle of the night you’d know,” he finished with a wink, his biting sarcasm on full force.
Though, hate wasn’t a word he would really use to describe his feelings towards Potter anymore. The war had changed everyone, as war typically does, and it had taken its toll on Draco especially.  Though it’s not as if anyone really noticed, and he didn’t expect them to. Draco was one of the only Slytherins’ to return to Hogwarts for their 8
Shit. He was too, if he could just get a little friction…
Harry thought for a moment longer as if willing himself to get out of bed and lengthen the mile-long distance that already stretched between the two of them. With as much quiet nerve as he could muster Harry slid from bed, yanked on the first pair of trousers he could find tossed a t-shirt he found lying on the ground over his messy head, grabbed a notebook and quill from his bag, and let Hedwig free from her cage and watched only for a moment as she beelined for the window thankful she did so quietly.

Harry glances over to the sofa in front of the fire where he normally sits with Ron and Hermione. Ron is giving him a look that reads, ‘what the hell are you on about mate?’ and he can already picture Hermione’s knowing look, so he avoids her gaze altogether. He looks back towards Ron, gives him a shoulder shrug, chances one more look over at Malfoy who seems to be engrossed in his own book before opening the one in front of him and beginning to read.
As they entered the residence Draco was taken aback by just how large and cozy it was on the inside, on the outside it looked as if there was no possible way that at one point in time nine Weasley’s could have fit comfortably under this one roof.
Draco was sure Potter could read all the stages of emotion as they transpired on his face, not being very well versed in hiding from Potter these days.
“Not touching you will require all my attention too Potter,” Draco said with a laugh.
“You know when I consulted all the etiquette books there was nothing on the best gifts to give to
Draco watched as professor Lupin led the way up to the door, he felt Harry reach for his hand giving it one final squeeze before dropping it to follow their former professor’s path. Before they’d even reached the door and had a chance to knock it was swinging open, and a short, stout, kind faced woman was left there beaming at them all. It was all Draco could do not to grin back at her, her energy was entirely contagious.
Harry knew he couldn’t hide from them, and he certainly couldn’t hide them from Malfoy, oh for fucks sake,
“I’m coming,” and before he could finish his thought on friction Draco was coming down his throat and fuck if he was doing his very best to swallow it. He quickly palmed his cock through his jeans and glanced up at Draco who was lost in orgasmic bliss.
However, Harry found that before he could really force himself to face those thoughts head on, Draco was pulling on his wrist, or nudging at his shoulder to point at something, or ask him about something muggle related which Harry was beginning to find endearing, so he could never focus on where the trail would lead him for too long.
Draco only nodded his head in response, a last and longing glance down to Potter’s lips before he began to push off from the wall in resolve to head back to Privet Drive. But before he got very far Potter pulled him back, Draco was just able to brace himself back on the wall and meet Potter’s lips in a scorching kiss. He knew Potter was trying to tell him something, pour his feelings into the kiss, but it was all too much for Draco, and so when the brunette pulled away smile plastered across his lips, Draco was too fond to do anything but return the smile and follow Potter as they exited their tunnel and headed back to the Dursley’s.
Harry returned the sentiment with a groan, and a very fevered, “Fuck, Draco” which was all it took for Draco to come, a strangled “
Harry was wild tonight; his hands were raking up and down Draco’s body as if it were the last time, he’d ever feel his skin beneath his fingertips. It was driving Draco mad, mad with want. He wanted to make Harry feel good, he wanted to solidify this as the best birthday and ensure that Draco would be forever engrained in the other boy’s mind, and his skin.
Without thinking, which is usually how it went with Draco it seemed, he dropped to his knees in front of him. A vision of his thoughts from earlier--
Harry’s eyes watched Draco swallow, following his adam’s apple as it bobbed still infatuated with the blush along the column of Draco’s neck. He idly wondered how far down the flush went, Draco was so beautifully pale after all.
He began to idly wonder if Fred was in on whatever Draco and Hermione’d been whispering about last night after dinner. He definitely wouldn’t put it past him, or George for that matter.
Harry could only think about how he wanted to be closer to Draco, which seemed almost impossible as they were pressed together and clinging on to one another as though they were the other’s source of oxygen, both gasping and heaving as they clung still tighter.
“I’ll have to wear your sweaters around the house more often yeah,” Draco whispered into their shared space.
Harry nodded once an unspoken answer to the other boy’s question, “he was my godfather, my only living family, and now he’s dead.”
Initially, he thought Mrs. Weasley’s holiday invitation was just one of polite extension, knowing fully that she had meant it, and would welcome him at the holiday’s with open arms. However, Mr. Weasley’s words wrung in his head, ‘I expect we’ll see you at Christmas.’ Draco honestly hadn’t given a lick of thought to the holiday’s, his main focus on just getting through first term unscathed. Well, that and speaking with Severus about what happened in his absence. What did the Weasley’s know about, that he didn’t? Who had already decided that Draco was to spend Christmas at the Burrow, not that he was complaining in the slightest, he felt safe there, Harry was there. If anything, Draco figured that he wouldn’t be leaving the castle that year, let alone to travel for any of the holidays.
He could feel his face go warm as he gave her a sheepish smile, “I’m sorry to disappoint you Mrs. Weasley, but it was Harry who was stuck with the task of looking after me this summer.”
By the time Charms had ended Draco realized he had not paid attention and had completely missed the lesson, he hurried to catch up with Hermione and Ron hoping to both secure Hermione’s notes from the lesson he had spent agonizing over where Harry was, and to get some sort of positive glimpse into where wonder boy might be.
the next day.
Harry’s eyes darted down to the sliver of fair skin on Malfoy’s hip that had been revealed in the process, and then quickly shot his eyes back up to the other boy’s, desperately hoping to avoid a blush, but feeling his face heat anyways. His body always seemed traitorous when it came to Malfoy, and he was only just able to think of a quick lie in answer of the other boy’s question.  Bravely, he mirrored Malfoy and turned on his side, peering up and meeting his gaze, “I was just thinking about my birthday, it’s exactly a week from today.”
Weasley let out a huff and resigned to look out the window albeit, petulantly in Draco’s opinion.
“And so, now you have me here all alone. What was it you planned on doing after you got me out here?”
“Come on Harry, Were Malfoy and Potter we can’t just ‘feel it out,’ people will notice if we’re holding hands and snogging in empty corridors.”
Both boys were breathing heavily, Draco moved his hands from Harry’s face down to hold onto his wrists looking up into those green eyes and attempting to convey all his feelings for the other boy with one intense gaze as he clung to Harry’s wrists. Apparently, it was Harry’s turn to let out a loud groan, “Shit, Draco, ughh, you’re going to be the death of me,” he stated as he pulled Draco’s lips back to his own, and pulled them both back, so that they were laying down on their sides on Draco’s bed as they snogged the life from one another.
Draco could feel his face beginning to flush when Potter didn’t immediately flinch his leg away, but instead let it rest there against Draco’s easily. Of course, Draco’s mind was in a commotion, and he was willing himself not to glance over to see Potter’s reaction. Alas, his petition to dissect Potter’s feelings won out and Draco peered slyly out of the corner of his eye in his direction. Potter had the appearance of someone completely immersed in the book they were reading, but Draco found it hard not to question his sincerity in the escape, especially while Draco was trying to elude a panic attack over the feel of Potter’s thigh against his own.
The group let out a laugh and continued on into the house, Harry was shuffling his feet and Draco could sense that he was being summoned. Hermione could sense it too, “Draco,”
Potter rolls his eyes to, though with a slight quirk in his lips, “I know, but I wanted to talk to you about
Harry nodded in understanding, and Draco was grateful.
he let spill from his lips in a moan, he couldn’t even hold them back anymore. He knew he was close to coming, and the fact that Draco had admitted the same only made him all the more determined. He wanted to see that blonde head in front of him thrown back in ecstasy, with his name on the boy’s lips as he let go.
Draco paused and looked into his eyes for what felt like years before speaking, making Harry’s soft smile waver in understanding.
Who knew where they would be this time next year, and every moment counted. With that thought, he pulled Harry back to his lips for a scorching kiss that ended with Draco yanking Harry by the front of his pants back into bed. Packing long, long forgotten.
Harry moved his hands down along the other boy’s bare thighs, he could feel Draco’s arousal aptly straining against the thin material of his pants. Draco moaned openly, forehead pressing against Harry’s. When he dared to open his eyes, he was engulfed in gray, could almost feel the waves of Draco’s eyes crashing over him. It was almost too much, almost.
Harry let out a laugh, squeezing Draco’s arms gently. “The giant ‘H’ didn’t give it away as mine then?”
“I’ve been looking for you Malfoy, what’s brought you out here?”
He took a deep breath looking back up in Malfoy’s eyes before continuing, “It doesn’t matter to me who you were before this moment, and even then, who you were before this is what got us to where we are now in the first place. What matters is now, we can’t ever go back only forward, and I like this forward…with you.” Harry quirks up his lips in an earnest half smile squeezing Malfoy’s hand before reluctantly letting go and returning his hands back to his own lap.
Harry grasped Draco’s wrists and kissed them each softly before looking up to face him, “in a way, you already did return the favor.”
All Draco could do was laugh and pull the brunette to him, the relief he felt at the knowledge that Harry wouldn’t grow out of him once they got back to school was overwhelming.
“About that…I sort of think Ron already knows about Harry and I.”
Draco looked up at the sky, only briefly distracted by the first drops of rain musing only for a moment that he had predicted this earlier, the rain that is, before turning back to Dudley. From the corner of his eye he could spot that Potter was trying to use his cousin’s brief distraction to his advantage, so without thinking he put his wand away, and watched as Dudley’s face turned smug as if he had won. “I don’t need anything other than my fist to put you in your place, just ask your pathetic father, I’m sure he remembers,” Draco spat with a side glance towards Potter, trying to distract Dudley for long enough.
Alas, they said their goodbyes, there, under Potter’s curious gaze. He knew he could trust Pansy, their friendship though one of convenience initially had grown into one of mutual understanding. They came from ‘noble’ pureblood families it was expected that they be friendly with one another, ultimately, he knew that his family hoped that one day the pair would marry. Though looking over at Harry, head thrown back in laughter at something Weasley had said, he knew that would never happen. Though it wasn’t long ago that an anxious, stoic, Draco resigned to marry her or any other pureblood girl his parents pushed upon him as it would be better than the alternative, and disappointing his father hadn’t been an option until now.
The two boys began to sprint trying to put as much space between themselves and Dudley’s fat arse as they could, as well as, find shelter from the storm. Draco was trying not to think about the ache he still felt in his abdomen though it wasn’t nearly as strong as it had been before their escape, he idly wondered if Potter was feeling it too. The boys surged forward with new fervor as they spotted a tunnel ahead, Potter was back to yanking his wrist to urge him forward.
Draco did so much for Harry without knowing just how much it meant to him. Harry wanted to make sure he knew just how smitten, and fond Draco made him. He wanted to make him come undone, he wanted him to know that he didn’t have to be so careful, not with Harry.
Draco hesitates for a moment…” you didn’t like it, well look, I have a lot of other books…” Draco begins slightly exasperated but in a timid way that brings a full smile to Potter’s lips.
The next morning Draco’d been lulled awake by the distant sounds of morning at The Burrow. In the two mornings he’d spent at the Weasley’s so far, he’d learned that hardly any moment was quiet, the only time of peace was at night when every Weasley and guest was tucked sweetly into their bed. Otherwise the house was always filled with various chaotic sounds.
“I feel the same way. I know what you want, I know what you’re asking me. I just don’t know if I can.”
“You tell me Malfoy,” I replied pressing my cheek to the soft pink skin of Draco’s and letting out an unabashed sigh.
Though, that last year at Hogwarts had been different, very different he recollected in amusement. Draco and Harry had been roomed together for their eighth year to everyone’s amused shock. It had even surprised him at first, though the two boys quickly fell into a quiet routine which seemed to simply ignite Harry’s curiosity as it often had in the past. It appeared that Malfoy had been keen to keep a low profile but that only goaded Harry further.
As soon as Harry entered the room fully, Draco’s eyes met his, and Harry instantly felt hot all over. He didn’t think he’d ever fully be able to rationally understand how much he simply wanted when he looked at Draco. His instinct was to wrap the blonde up into his arms and merely hold him, and the bond thrumming beneath his skin agreed entirely.
Harry could tell that Draco was uncertain, and that it had taken a lot for him to simply come down here and place this book in his hands. He peered down at it, “Call Me by Your Name” he read aloud, looking back up at Draco the same question still in his eyes. Draco looked at him a moment longer before weaving his hands through Harry’s and stating earnestly, “just read it Harry.” With that, Draco pulled one of Harry’s hands to his lips, kissed his palm, then retreated up the stairs back to his dorm leaving Harry alone with the latest Draco escape, and the understanding that he would soon be privy to where Draco had spent the last four days and three nights.
Draco barely held back a groan of his own as Potter’s hands clenched onto his shirt bunching up the fabric that clung to his back and used it as leverage to bring their bodies even closer together, if that were even possible, as they seemed to already be fused together.
It was Ron who took notice, “Mate? You alright?”
Before long it wasn’t just meals, it was studying in the common room, sharing a desk in classes, and walks near the black lake. Harry found himself pleased that Malfoy seemed to fit in okay amongst them. Of course, Hermione was the most agreeable to the whole thing, and Harry knew that because of this Ron would at least accept it despite his objections and reservations. Harry actually found that Hermione and Malfoy seemed to get along quite well, they both shared an aptitude for studying and seemed to have the same taste in literature. Harry at times even found himself a little jealous listening to the two of them engage in discussions about books Harry had never even heard of, which truly only encouraged his digestion of books much to his own surprise, but of course only so Harry could be the one Malfoy turned to for those discussions.
“That’s it Remus, I’ll hear no arguments, you can spare a few hours here with us to eat before you head back. I’ve plans to send the leftovers with you anyways, so that’s the last I’ll hear of it.”
Draco sat up just a little, still nestled between Harry’s thighs, and pulled his t-shirt up and over his head. Relishing the moment all their exposed skin would meet for the first time. Draco leaned up over the brunette, a hand on either side of his head gray eyes searching green. Harry met his gaze equally gone, his hands came up and ran down Draco’s back slowly making him close his eyes and let out a soft groan as Harry rested his hands at the base of his spine.
Draco didn’t know what was waiting for him at Hogwarts, but he knew that things would never be the same, and as he looked around the dining room at everyone’s laughing, smiling faces for the first time in his life he felt content in the unknown.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What do you mean,” he asked face scrunching up into one of confusion.

“Well Potter, again, you’re in luck. Fancy spending your birthday with me back at the shops, maybe we could go to the theatre again, yeah?” Malfoy asked him with a face so soft and bright that all Harry could do was smile in response, and he realized that he was finding it incredibly difficult to keep himself from reaching a hand out to trail his fingertips down the softness of the other boys cheek, and then promptly felt his face begin to heat as his eyes were filled up with stormy gray.
As he pulled away, he let a smile creep to his face as he stopped to appreciate Draco’s dopey grin, before taking his arm and pulling him from the kitchen without looking back.
“And I told you that I fully intended on bestowing you with a birthday gift once we’d been to Diagon, and a Malfoy always keeps their promises Potter, honestly” he finished with a mock eyeroll.
Draco laid there silently evaluating the other boy, taking in his dark brown hair, and honey colored skin a stark contrast to the white sheets that surrounded him. Draco noticed that no one had bothered to remove Potter’s glasses from his face after he’d fallen asleep. He zoned in on the glasses, surely it must be uncomfortable for the other boy, Draco didn’t wear glasses, but he felt sure that it would be unpleasant if Potter were to roll over and crush them against his face. Draco reasoned that if they were to be living in close quarters all summer would it not be better to at least begin on the right foot, and then there was at least the rationale that Potter wouldn’t even know it was Draco who removed the glasses for him.
Draco let out a sigh, and really looked at her. He felt overcome by just how much he wanted her to understand this next bit, and hoped he was conveying it.
With that Hermione was yanking him forward from Fred and Ron’s grips and towards the small alleyway she’d appeared from.
“What’s this?” Harry asked with a tilt of his head indicating his genuine curiosity.
Before Draco could process, or react, or even take a breath really, Harry was hoisting him up to eye level once more.
Gray eyes so earnest and soft peered up at him as they reached the front of the ticket counter, “you choose, it’s your birthday,” Draco spoke a side glance towards the window.
Draco was feeling a sort of relaxed restlessness that he couldn’t really define. All Draco had wanted to accomplish that day was to make Harry feel special, and after the theatre, and the walk, and dinner, he couldn’t help but feel like the occasion was lacking something. He knew part of his trepidation was due to the fact that he had be unable to give Harry an actual birthday present.
Draco Malfoy was surprisingly keen to sit in the 8
“Why be friends with me, Potter?” Malfoy spoke in a low, soft declaration, glancing up at Harry with wide eyes.
He knew everything was different now, his Godfather was dead, Voldemort was most definitely back, and ultimately the wizarding world was on the brink of war. Harry found that he spent most of his time locked away in his thoughts, unsure of how to share them with anyone but himself. He was jolted out of his usual stupor with an elbow to the shoulder from Hermione. As his eyes blinked in acclimation, he realized he couldn’t even remember how he got to potions class. He looked up into Professor Snape’s dark eyes as the man stared down at him, he had never been more grateful that this was the last Potions class of the term, though he wasn’t much looking forward to the summer.
This was something he’d discovered over the last few days that he really liked about Draco; he always kept him on his toes. And while Harry was pretty sure he knew the other boy in ways no one else did, he also knew he had so much more to learn and he was so tightly coiled around the blonde’s finger all he wanted to do was learn; in every single way.
As always, I love love love love all of your comments! You guys are always so encouraging and uplifting its amazing!
“All right Potter,” Draco asked, daring to break the silence first.
Both boys were laughing now and yanking each other closer. Draco sighed as Harry wound himself around Draco’s limbs like a vine pressing into every angle.
It wasn’t as if Draco was used to a warm welcome home either, though. His mother would often greet him with a hug at the station, and that was where the affection died. Upon their apparation home his father would begin berating him about all the unsuitable things he had done that year at school, with a full catalogue of criticism. Draco grew up in a place where it was better to be seen, only when summoned mind you, and not heard. He mused that this unspoken rule had become even more strict since Voldemort had taken up residence, though, Draco was more than happy to oblige.
“Please,” Draco whimpered, and it was almost enough to send Harry over the edge.
“Oh Harry,” he whispered eyes alight with mirth as his fingers grazed through the sticky mess. Harry watched the blonde suck one long elegant finger into his mouth, closing his eyes as his lips sealed around the digit, tasting Harry. It was almost enough to make him hard again, and they both moaned foreheads once again resting against each other.
He knew his aching heart and itch to be close to the blonde went far beyond the bond. He’d had an inkling for a while now, he just hadn’t wanted to face it, he had been putting it off all summer and he was facing the consequences of that choice now. The fact that the only thing he’d really been able to focus on was the fact that Draco had admitted to him that he, Draco Malfoy stone faced, posh, proper, Malfoy, was in fact in love with him, only smacked him in the face more harshly with what he’d been avoiding all summer.
“Oh, definitely your arse Potter,” he said with a wink that seemed to have the effect he wanted as he was swiftly pulled flush against the other boy for a kiss that was anything but chaste.
After a few moments it seemed that the marginal amount of touch had soothed Potter enough to conclude the thrashing and shrieking, Draco took a deep breath allowing himself one long, fond, and up close look at Harry before he began to pull away, but before he could retract his hands, Potter had procured a firm grip on his wrists holding him in place against his face. When Draco had recovered from the brief moment of alarm, he looked up into the other boy’s eyes with a question in his gaze; and gray met green.
Harry watched as Draco’s eyes darted to look behind Harry and grew wide, and he almost couldn’t bring himself to detach himself from Draco’s lithe form to assess Draco’s concern. However, as he felt Draco begin to unclench from his jumper, he found the will to turn in the other boy’s arms lacing his fingers through Draco’s before being faced with a group of Weasley’s and one Hermione.
“I read the book,” Harry stated aloud as if it were the only logical statement one could make after sharing a moment like that with a former enemy, turned, friend, turned…lover? Draco couldn’t say for sure, but the twisting of knots in his gut told him that’s what he was hoping for. He looked up at Harry, with eyes that he knew were not hiding in the slightest how he felt about the disheveled boy in front of him.
Harry wasn’t entirely sure when it had started only that it had, and it drove him absolutely mad. Sure, he wasn’t the neatest flat mate and yes, he did tend to leave his clothes scattered about the various rooms of their flat, shoes too. However, that didn’t mean that his belongings were up for grabs. He’d shared a room with four other people in the dorms of Gryffindor tower and not once had anyone nicked his stuff let alone his clothing.
He didn’t want anything to change between them because it could result in Draco moving out. Their whole dynamic would change, and perhaps their friendship would cease. Harry couldn’t bear it, not with how far they’d come.
Draco was woken in the middle of the night with a jolt; someone was tapping on his door. Draco reached over to his night stand and felt around for his wand, cast a quick
Draco let out a big sigh that ended on a curt laugh and pulled back to look at Harry before responding.
, Tuesday evening to be precise.
Ron ran a hand over his face looking completely exasperated while Hermione looked a little more relieved.
Draco laughed, “of course Potter.”
if this was the first.
“Well, if I have to be someone’s insufferable Gryffindor, there’s no one else’s I’d rather be Malfoy.”
After a rowdy lunch, Draco’d been keen to decline the invitation to pick up their game where it’d left off. Of course, Harry hadn’t been keen to let him off so easy, hanging back to step into his personal space inquisitive, and pressing to know that he was okay. What he’d desperately wanted to inform Potter of was that there was no way he’d ever be okay with him constantly stepping into his space with neither of them able to touch one another the way he knew they both wanted. Instead, he settled on “I’m okay, just tired” and graced him with their signature soft half-smile.
Harry stood there, in the doorway of the kitchen for what felt like forever before he heard Remus clear his throat loudly, “Well, we best be off. Just thought everyone might want to say goodbye before we headed out.”
“I know, I didn’t say it before. You know, when you said it.” The other boy let out a sigh and continued on, almost anxious to get it all out before he lost his nerve.
Draco couldn’t pretend he wasn’t mad for Potter’s attention; he spent more time analyzing each predicament he found himself in with Potter than actually engaging in his own book as Potter was doing next to him. Draco knew the interest he had entertained only a mere moment ago in the book settled in his lap was gone the moment Potter flopped himself down next to him. In the middle of this contemplation Potter pulled his foot up underneath him and nestled into the sofa more comfortably pushing his thigh flush with Draco’s under the blanket,
And he said it so gravely, and so heartfelt that Harry could do nothing but sincerely accept his apology.
, and groaned at the time; 2:30 am. In his groggy state his mind couldn’t fully connect with who might be waking him at that particular hour. He stumbled over to the door, cracked it open an inch to peak at who was waking him so early in the morning, and then pulled the door fully open and stepped aside to let Harry Potter, boy wonder enter into his room once again.
Draco surged on before he could lose his nerve, needing to get out how he felt, “Harry I would have never dreamed you could ever harbor any sort of pleasant feelings for me in my wildest dreams. I know I’ve been a right shit to you since we started school, and this past year I’ve only begun to process that I treated you that way because I was unwilling to face how I really felt about you, because of what that might mean about me.”
“Of course Draco, it seems as though you’re stuck with us” Granger said with a smile and Draco could do nothing but smile back. “Should you both just try and bypass Professor Snape, and go straight to Dumbledore – Especially if that bond still hasn’t worn off by the time, we make it back to school?”
“Oi, what’s so funny?”
Harry knew the relationship he shared with Draco was unlike the one he shared with Hermione or Ron. He knew that their relationship had always been different. He wasn’t stupid, he knew their old rivalry went beyond that of childish jealousy and hatred. What he and Malfoy shared was special, and always had been even in the strange twisted way their relationship existed. Only now, it felt different in a way that Harry couldn’t quite understand. He only knew that he was addicted to being near Malfoy, and when he wasn’t near him, he spent his time thinking of ways or reasons to seek him out.
