"All those times I imagined what to do with this arse," Harry whispered in reverence. Draco smirked and wiggled said arse enticingly.
Draco's response was to turn away and cry even harder. Harry was always so good to him. He didn't laugh at him or judge him the first time he wet himself at the club. Even when he was pregnant and throwing a tantrum (and Merlin knows he'd thrown enough tantrums when he
Harry held the phone with trembling hands, video paused at the moment when Draco flashed Harry's username on screen.
," Harry growled, and Draco bit his lower lip so hard with his teeth that he could taste blood, toes and fingers clenched as he tried to stave of his orgasm, as he felt Harry continue to fuck him through his orgasm, the sound of come joining together with the lube becoming sloppy. "
The pair of them didn't stay as late as Pansy wanted to, although they stayed later than Hermione and Ron, because Ron had work the next day, but neither Draco or Harry wanted to leave her to dance and drink by herself and convinced her to let them pour her into a town car and send her toward her apartment before they started walking back to Harry's place, hand-in-hand.
, alright?" Draco swallowed hard, and he felt tears stinging at his eyes. "I was at this party tonight, Pansy said that I needed to stop wallowing," he wrinkled his nose, even though he knew that his best friend had only meant to make him feel better. "And there was this guy, and I was dancing, and—" Draco's eyes squeezed shut for a moment and then cut away quickly, looking down at his boots, his bottom lip pouting out a little at the smudge of dirt on one of his Chelsea boots. His voice was low and brittle, the bitterness turned inward. "I was just feeling
"Okay, but I'll pay!" Draco quickly interjected, because he knew that there was no way of talking Harry out of it now, because if he
Maybe there was some stupid, romantic notion that he had tied to it in his head, but Harry had looked almost feral when Draco had first hesitantly asked, and the way that he had seemed to make it his mission that night after piercing him to suck his life out through his cock, so something about it had obviously struck a chord with him as well.
He had no idea what he had done to deserve Harry but for some reason, Harry kept insisting, over and over again, that he didn't want to be anywhere else, except at Draco's side.
It's heated embarrassment that flushes Draco's cheeks now, knowing how needily he had been moving his hips, and he loved the way the shame made the lust feel even more potent.
"Sound so sweet, pretty baby," Harry straightened up and there was a line of drool between his lips and Draco's cock, and it made his cock twitch against his stomach, jump and smear precome and Harry smile wide before wiping the back of his hand messily across his face. He reached up, and pressed a chaste kiss to Draco's slack mouth, that the blonde tried to follow but his head felt too heavy to properly lift off the pillow. Harry just smiled at him as he pulled back, and then he was reaching into the bedside table, where he had gotten the lube earlier, and he pulled out a condom. "I don't doubt either of us are clean, baby, but we'll get tested soon so that I can fill you up properly, okay?" Harry said softly and Draco's pupils blew even wider at that implication and he nodded, trying to follow all movements even if it was hard. "Do you want that, baby?" Harry asked as he tore the corner of the edge of the condom wrapper, but his eyes were still on Draco, eyes catching every single flicker of expression on his face. Draco nodded but Harry clicked his tongue and smiled a little. "Wanna hear you say it, Dray," he prompted gently and Draco groaned lowly.
"You mean on a date?" Draco blurted the first thing on his mind, then mentally slapped himself for sounding so desperate.
Draco found it quite surprising that it was very easy to talk to the black-haired man, when they were not actively trying to kill each other. Maybe age and maturity had to do with it. He told Harry all about his work and his visits to France, when Harry asked nicely how his parents were doing. He couldn't help but wonder what it would've been like if they had been friends at Hogwarts. He stirred at his hot chocolate absently and squirmed in his seat.
"What was that all about?" she asked suspiciously. "You and Potter were getting awfully close up there."
Draco just blinked up at Harry innocently. "What did I do? Just went out shopping with James and got him some new toys, then we met up with Pansy and Blaise for tea, that's what."
"Are you alright, love?" Harry asked him, wrapping one arm across Draco's shoulders and pulling the blond to him.
Harry started to imagine rubbing his cock against Draco's covered arse. He would get the blond so worked up, Draco would whine and beg for Harry to take him right there. Harry would unzip and pull down Draco's jeans roughly and, with his spit as lubricant, push into Draco's tight hole.
Harry stroked his fingers over the marks on Draco's neck. "You're starting to bruise," he panted. "Fuck, Draco, your skin...."
Since Draco was too pregnant to bend down, he offered to hold the bucket containing all the seashells while Harry stopped to shovel at the sand, hoping to uncover more treasures.
Harry took a moment to admire his husband's flushed cheeks and lips, but they were interrupted by a loud yell from the living room, then a crash which seemed like a plate falling to the floor. "Papa!!" Harry and Draco could hear James shouting.
Draco wanted to say yes, but he remembered the childlike joy in Harry's eyes as he played in the sea and picked shells. He couldn't find it in his heart to tell Harry he just wanted to sit for a while. So, he shook his head.
"I still don't understand why you want to come," she said, sipping at her Firewhisky and gesturing to the rest of their ex-classmates mingling with each other in Seamus' home. "You're not even on speaking terms with anyone here except me."
"I'm sure it can wait," the man chuckled darkly, spinning Draco around again, holding his waist and pushing back against his arse. Draco groaned.
"No, Malfoy. Did I not tell you? This hex wears off after an hour, so you should be free to go then. Same as when you were turned into a slug. I don't know why you became a fairy this time."
Seamus had a large field behind his house, which made for a good makeshift Quidditch pitch. For once, Draco was glad he decided to go to the class reunion, if it meant he could play Quidditch again. He missed the open countryside surrounding the Manor. His flat, though sleek and modern, afforded no opportunity for him to perform loops in the air on his broom.
"I babysit him a few times each week, when Andromeda has to run errands. He's really cute and he's a Metamorphagus, you know? Just like his mother. We didn't know till recently, when his hair started changing from brown to turquoise. Andromeda and I, we were so delighted, jumping up and hugging him. I'm sure he was wondering what the fuss is about," Harry laughed.
The next weekend couldn't arrive fast enough. Saturday morning found Harry looking into his bathroom mirror and trying to flatten his hair, to no avail. He checked his watch and sighed, giving up on the messy black curls. He then spent a longer time than usual deciding what to wear, finally settling on one of the T-shirts Hermione got for him. It was a deep green, and people said it brought out the colour of his eyes. He matched that with a pair of ripped black jeans usually reserved for clubbing nights. Satisfied, Harry grabbed his car keys and left the house.
"Yeah, I didn't know what to do with it honestly. I wanted to return it to you, but I read that the Manor was sold off and I didn't know where you moved to. All my friends didn't know where you were."
Harry felt a bit guilty at that. Ever since Draco had James, their sex life had dwindled a bit. The toddler really had a lot of energy and seemed to have a knack for getting into trouble (much like his other father, Draco always said), and most times Harry and Draco were too tired at the end of the day to do anything but sleep.
Harry would rather prefer to see Draco naked, but this was good enough. His eyes greedily took in the pale expanse of skin, admiring Draco's lithe body and seeing his muscles flex as he mixed the flour, sugar and eggs. When Draco turned to the side, Harry caught a glimpse of a pale pink nipple, and he could feel his erection push angrily against his pants. Gods, he wanted to lick and suck and
Harry then launched into how he and Andromeda had been trying to make Teddy's costume. Draco listened half-heartedly. He was interested; he had never been around kids but he always wanted to have a sibling. It got too lonely in the Manor. But Draco's bladder kept reminding him of more pressing needs, and he felt it was impolite to interrupt Harry mid-conversation, especially when it was about Teddy. The man's eyes lit up whenever he mentioned his godson.
"Okay, baby?" Harry asked. He had stopped and was pouring the lube over his fingers again. Draco leaned up on his elbows and stared unabashedly at Harry coating his huge erection with more lube.
"You should do whatever you love, Draco." Harry answered. Feeling bold, he let the back of his other hand brush against Draco's cheek. "I'm glad you're making videos on YouTube now. Your recipes are interesting and I love watching you bake. I couldn't believe you picked me."
Don’t you just hate it when there’s only one cubicle and the person inside is taking forever to do their business? 😕 Poor Draco!
, Potter?" Draco spat out, his wand hand trembling slightly trying to keep the tray of potions aloft.
Draco pushed open the door of the only toilet in the diner, only to find the lone cubicle occupied. There was nowhere else he could relieve himself. He had no choice but to stand outside the cubicle to wait, bouncing up and down on his heels nervously and crossing his legs together.
"You have such an interesting scar," Draco's brow furrowed as his hand brushed across Harry's forehead. He traced the faint lightning bolt shape and Harry suppressed a shiver.
pull away, but it was so he could huff out a laugh and shake his head, and he was still gripping Harry's hand on the step between them. Harry's eyes opened wide in surprise. "I
"You're going to feel amazing around me, I know it," Harry whispered, and then one of his hands was cupping Draco's jaw while his lips were pressing against his mouth, and he was pushing inside Draco.
as he was pushed further up the bed. Harry moved himself smoothly, pushing up a little further on his knees so that there was some space between them, and then his fingers were skating lightly down Draco's chest, and more tears began to fall as his thumb pressed into the wet, weeping head of his cock, forefinger circling around. "You've been so good for me, baby. So good for daddy, pretty baby, in your pretty panties," Harry whispered and Draco's chest
"That's it, pretty baby," Harry praised him sweetly, and Draco's body just...It felt so light, feather light, as though if Harry wasn't there to anchor him with calming words and soft touches he would be floating right up and off the bed. His eyes closed again, breathing coming out a little hitched as he felt Harry run a hand down his side before he was moving, repositioning himself, and then the mattress was shifting and Draco's eyes slowly opened again, everything feeling lethargic as his lips stretched in a smile. "Baby?" Harry's voice was a lot closer, so close that Draco actually felt warm breath on his nose.
with the Equinox Gym, for too many reasons to count, but a cute little one where they didn't know anyone else and where they enjoyed the yoga sessions—but he went running almost everyday, and he played football with Ron and some of their friends pretty frequently.
," Draco's body jerked at that, nerve in his jaw jumping and white noise filling his ears for a split second at the whispered words.
, and the tears spilled over, down his cheek, and he was absently glad that Pansy Parkinson had always insisted that he wore waterproof eyeliner and mascara or else he was going to have hideous tracks down his cheeks. "No, no," Harry sounded upset and then he was moving again, kneeling in front of Draco and Draco blinked, pulling back, hands coming up to try and cover his face but Harry was stopping him. "No, baby, stop that," he said, taking Draco's hands in his own, rubbing them in his calloused palms, and circling his thumb against the back of Draco's hand.
"Okay...Okay," Harry said softly, as he breathed out his last mouthful of smoke and snubbed out his own joint before turning to Draco, and Draco forced himself to look at Harry, at least partially, holding his breath as he waited for whatever it was that the other man had to say. "So...You're saying you want something more? Yeah?"
times when they were all out clubbing. "I'm so glad I get you again, baby," Harry breathed against his mouth before he was grabbing Draco around the waist and twisting them around, manhandling him easily up the bed, and Draco gasped as he was tossed against the duvet covers, a breathy smile spreading as he let his eyes close and just lay back to take in the moment. "So glad you're going to let daddy take care of you."
. "How far do you want to go, hm?" Harry asked softly, and both his hands moved, running up and down Draco's hands outside the faux-leather pants which made Draco's skin break out in goosebumps underneath the material. "What do you need from me, baby?"
"Take a seat," Harry nodded at the barstools on the other side of the breakfast bar as he moved to take another smoothie glass out of the cupboard, Draco watching his fingers closely, the veins in his hands flexing, the gorgeous ink on the back of his hand shading and sculpting the image of a lily, a tattoo dedicated to his mother. "Is there anything here that you don't like?" He asked as he turned back around and Draco tried not to look as though he had been
"Yeah, darling?" Harry sounded just as breathless. "Does that feel good?" It didn't sound as though he required a reply, which was good, because his fingers started moving faster and Draco's eyes rolled back, unable to stop the way his hips began to roll down to meet Harry's fingers. "Oh, baby..." Harry made a disapproving clucking noise at the back of his throat and Draco's eyes opened hazily to meet Harry's. "I didn't say you could move yet, did I?"
Every now and then, Harry's hand would gently rub over his back, down his spine and splay out against Draco's bare, pale skin, which would draw the occasional shiver.
Harry caught him, and pulled him backwards easily, so that he was back on his knees, and he couldn't help but giggle at the easy help, head feeling light and fingers feeling almost disconnected from the rest of his body.
"Good boy," Harry whispered, kissing the side of Draco's head as he sat him down on the couch, resting against the cushions and the soft throw over the back. "I'm just going to get us some drinks, okay? I will be right back."
He wasn't sure if it had just developed since they began sleeping together, or if maybe it had been there before, because Harry had been open in admitting that he'd definitely had feelings for Draco before they had started sleeping together, even though they were both taking things
Draco's mind just felt so fuzzy he could barely see as he swallowed around his daddy's cock, just trying to get him to look down at him again or scratch at his hair in the reassuring way, and every time Harry did, Draco just felt everything inside him tip further into that cloudy, floating abyss.
He could have his eyes open if he wanted to, there was a reason why Harry had the TV on, but there was also a reason that Harry had it turned down so low, so that it wouldn't disturb Draco if he just wanted to let go.
, in a way that made his heart ache in his chest, starting by shuffling all the way down the bed to where Draco's feet were still in his boots, and pausing at the fluffy pink and blue socks that were hidden underneath—he paused and smiled fondly before leaning down and kissing the tips of Draco's toes over the fluffy socks and Draco couldn't help but giggle and wiggle his toes a little in response, eyes opening just a little to make out the fuzzy shape of Harry crouched between his legs before they fell shut again—and then Harry started to undo the button and zipper of his jeans and Draco's eyes snapped open as he remembered what was underneath.
shy, I just—I've had the biggest thing for you for so long, and I just—I didn't want to mess things up, because when me and Pansy found you and Hermione and Ron and Luna and Ginny—it was
"Take your time," he said softly and Draco just felt something break up inside him, hot and painful and right over his heart.
There was a black knitted jersey with a few holes in it, artfully so, and an oversized black shirt with pink lettering on the front reading
"It's okay, baby," Harry seemed to know as Draco's eyes shifted behind his eyelids, his voice soothing and low. His hands were calloused but then they were sweeping further up underneath the fabric of Harry's shirt that Draco was wearing, fingertips brushing against his nipples and Draco felt something in his brain short circuit, breath catching in his throat. "That's it," Harry whispered, pushing the shirt up further, and Draco's bones felt heavier in his body as he let Harry manhandle him, lifting him up off the mattress, his arms and his head, taking off the shirt and tossing it away so that Draco was left in just his panties, and his eyes were still closed, so he didn't see Harry's expression, but he could
to do anything, baby," Harry murmured easily, and he moved forward easily so that they were closer together again, easily still rubbing Draco's shoulders. "I'm doing this because I want to."
now, it was just...Wrapped up in Harry's arm felt like he was being tethered to the earth in a way that he had never really experienced before he had been with Harry.
And honestly, he had no grasp of how long he had slept and everything just felt a little bit like he was suspended in time now.
Draco Malfoy exhaled heavily and forced himself to rap his knuckles quickly against the apartment door before he lost his nerve.
. "I'm sorry," he actually felt tears beginning to form in the corners of his eyes, getting ready to spill over, and his head was
Draco hates her. She’s so clearly, practically perfect for Potter in every way, but she chose to run off and break the poor hero’s heart so she could shack up with Longbottom. Potter had been so distraught at losing her, Draco remembers, that the
She huffs and pushes past him, and he decides to go for the door. He’ll send Potter an owl tomorrow saying that he felt under the weather.
“Not tired,” Harry says, his eyes are on Draco’s face as if he’s never seen him before. “Wide awake.”
Harry tilts his eyes up from where he’s resting and gifts him another sweet, shy smile and says, “goodnight, Draco.”
Harry was skimming through the article for any particularly blatant falsehoods when Draco returned with a raised eyebrow.
Harry reluctantly pulls himself off and is immediately hugged by five more people. There isn’t a single photograph of him anywhere, and no one makes a single joke about Harry Potter Day, not even George.
Slowly he adds another, with much more lube than he usually uses, so Harry is dripping. He watches Harry’s body tense and clenches on the fingers inside him, trying to get more.
Andromeda shook her head at Teddy's enthusiasm and said, "it was nice to see you. We are family, Draco. Please don't be a stranger."
Draco looks at the picture; his features soften as the picture version of Harry and Teddy run around in the late summer sun. Teddy had paired his bubblegum pink hair with a darker skin tone to match Harry.
Draco laughs a little, accepting the glass and allowed Harry to fill it with water with a spell. “It was pretty spectacular.”
Draco takes a deep breath, slides his eyes to the corner of the ballroom where his supervisor is watching him like a hawk, and says, “Hello Mr. Potter. What can I get you this evening?”
Potter bites his lip but nods, and Draco makes them two Firewhiskey cocktails without the bells and whistles. Draco is honestly quite tired, after working the event last night which went late into the night and then staying on his feet all day today. He is quite looking forward to sitting down for a moment.
Potter is silent for a second, “well, yes. But I think it means he… I mean, it must mean something, right? If it was just sex, why not find someone else? Why me?”
He may be a penniless war criminal, but at least he’s a penniless war criminal who gets to watch Harry Potter’s fat ass ride his dick.
“Ever so polite, Harry,” Draco can’t help but tease, finally closing the gap between them. It’s all so much warmer than he imagined. When he thought about it when he was younger, he imagined so much more anger, so much more biting and fighting but Harry is shockingly pliant, happy to give up the fight.
“That was… amazing,” Harry says, nuzzling into Draco’s chest as if he’s trying to figure out a way inside. As if Harry hadn’t been a part of Draco since they first met.
What Draco really wants to know, is when exactly did Potter get an ass like that? He knows lusting after the Savior of the Wizarding World, the Magical Man of Mystery, is so common in the wizarding world it may as well be a cliche.
Harry whimpers against Draco’s lips, and suddenly he wants Harry so badly. He wants to take him to bed, and ravish him senseless. He wants to hear that voice, so often filled with dry sarcasm, rapturous in pleasure.
Draco knows he should stop staring, he’s like anyone of these hungry admirers, but he can’t help but be curious, and frankly a little bitter. He watches Potter and his friends have some type of playful argument that Potter loses with good humor, turning around in a dramatic huff.
Draco lifts one of Harry’s muscular thighs until Harry’s leg rests on his shoulder as he leans down to lick. Harry’s cock is leaking precum like a river at this point, and he sees Harry’s hands twisting in the sheets next to them. On a whim, he reaches a hand out to hold, and Harry clutches back desperately. Draco continues bobbing his head, enjoying his skin’s clean taste and the weight on his tongue. Harry must have showered after the party.
Draco shrugs, “I am, a little. I’m not going to pretend I’m happy with everything, that I am glad my parents and friends are no longer welcome in the country they lived in their whole lives… But, well, you saved us all. So, at the end of the day, I’d rather my father be in the Alps than sitting at the dining table with a monster.”
The first time that Draco spots Potter after the war, it is at a Ministry gala. He’s working as a bartender, unfortunately, not attending as a guest. But Draco takes a deep breath and remembers to bide his time. One of his ancestors, Septimus Malfoy, had lost nearly all of the Malfoy family wealth in the late 1700s, forcing his son Cygnus to earn it all back. Remake himself, and remake the family, just like Draco. Today it's the bar-cart at the Ministry, tomorrow it's a meeting with the Minister.
Harry glances around frantically and sees a table filled with hearty, delicious foods he loves, a no-fuss, but delicious-looking cake, and even a pick-up Quidditch pitch.
“Which of the following dangerous creature did Harry Potter survive being bit by? A.) Acromantula, B.) Basilisk, C.) Sphinx, or D.) Inferi.”
his fault. It was not his fault that his fellow trainees and Aurors were willing to stop at the first layer of inquiry. They simply wanted to find the person who committed the theft, which was mildly entertaining. But
Still, he knows it takes a lot out of his department, especially the young ones who weren’t really politically conscious during the war. It’s sweet how many of them become incredibly protective of him as his birthday rolls closer.
Harry ignores her sound of terror and pulls out two bags from his ever-expanding pockets. "Here you go, now we have matching jackets!"
“Hey Draco,” Arnold says, finally walking through the door to take over. Draco cashes out, before waving his wand to clock out.
Teddy looks thrilled at Draco, who smiles and waves his wand and charms his skin to look like scales to the delight of Teddy, who tries to imitate it.
“Need you to sign a few statements for the Aberdeen case,” Draco says, pulling several roles of parchment out of his satchel.
Harry ran a hand through his hair. He’s not normally a hardass boss, he’s actually known in the office for being a huge softy. He enjoys mentoring young Aurors starting out in their careers, and his door is always open to talk to them as they deal with how hard and terrible human beings can be to each other. He wants his employees to be happy, goddamn it. He wants them to have work-life balance, he wants jokes in the office.
Harry laughs a little at Draco's face as he leaves, but he can't help it. Dumbledore was his mentor, after all. Fawkes came back to him after the war, and now that they had both been reborn, Harry felt especially in tune with the phoenix.
“Harry!” Draco says, alarmed. Harry isn’t surprised by his tone, Harry almost never cries, and never like this but Harry pulls him into a fierce hug and weeps a little on his shoulder.
Draco gently pulls out, smiling at Harry’s low whine. Gently, he grabs his wand and casts a few cleaning charms on them and the bed. He glances at the clock on the table and sees that it’s now six in the morning. Harry looks exhausted now like he’s going to fully pass out any second.
Harry looks at him for a moment, then with swiftness he’s developed in Auror training, he pulls Draco back down and curls like a cat around him. With another hand, he summons his wand.
Draco pulls Harry gently in the direction of his bedroom. It’s as coolly modern as the rest of the apartment, with a large bed in the center and a not-insignificant chrome and black amount. It always made Draco feel a bit like he is on another planet.
“You remember that you’re lucky,” Harry says with a shrug. “I’m so lucky that I have the skills and tools available to help people, to protect people, to help people find closure. So many people worry about the people they love, but they have no means to actually protect them. We do, I would so much rather know every death threat about Hermione, because then I can protect her. I’m lucky I see them.”
So Harry looked into it when he was off the clock. It turns out that the specific curse on the painting gave instructions to other cursed pictures, and behind each cursed painting was a series of addictive potions that a more massive crime syndicate was selling on the black market.
Draco has never had sex like this, he’s burnt through with lust, but he’s also filled with this urge to make it last. He’s not in any rush. He could spend hours just doing this.
“It’s important to have a competitive skill in a crowded market,” Draco says with a smug shrug. He had been inspired by the “mixologists” of the muggle world, who turned presentation and flavor into an art form. And Draco had magic.
Harry pauses as if he’s not sure how to finish the sentence so Draco steps in, gently tugging the shirt out of Harry’s grip and pulling it off himself.
Harry’s body is beautiful, he’s built for speed. All of his muscles are long and toned, but not bulky, and his abdomen is covered in scars. There is a large circle in the center of his chest, and then there is a lightning bolt shaped scar that bisects it. There are bite marks on his arm, a long thin cut on the other, claw marks on his shoulder…
“Fuck,” Harry says, his voice garbled and breathy, “fuck. I am going to have bruises on my ass tomorrow. Fuck that’s hot.”
It has forced him into this awkward position. He can rarely date. People are willing to tolerate some mystery; it adds to the mystique. But almost no one wants a lover who won't speak about the first eleven years of their lives, who won't talk about huge chunks of their school years, who can't talk about the year they spent trying to defeat a Dark Lord. It left so little, and Harry couldn't blame them.
“Harry, then.” They sit in silence beside each other for a beat, before Draco can’t help himself. “So, can you tell me the real reason you’re here, Harry?”
"Andy!" Harry says, his hands up in surrender, "they're perfectly safe. There are about a hundred safety charms on that thing."
Draco continues thrusting and reluctantly lets go of Harry’s hand so he can wrap it instead around Harry’s dick.
“But,” Draco adds because he can never quite help himself around Potter. “I will say that this is Charpentier 25 year, and deserves better treatment.”
Jeff shrugs, "I don't know but count me out. I'm not Harry Potter; I'm not dealing with necromancy."
"No, Teddington," Harry said, dropping down, so he was eye level. "No zombies this time. I'll tell you the story when we get inside… But first! Please meet your cousin Draco, Teddy."
Draco shakes his head, “don’t do that to yourself. You also defeated several Dark Lords, I’m pretty sure they were having a hard enough time with one.”
Harry told himself. It was essentially breaking and entering, and though he often walked a thin line of legality, he didn't want Draco to think he had lost his mind,
“Forming a Dark Arts cult with the bottles of rum,” Draco replies in a dry whisper, making sure his face still has a polite smile fixed on it.
He even likes personality- Draco has come to depend on his quick, dry wit while watching muggle movies. He loves how relentless Potter is, how he’s tireless when he is interested in something. He likes how he’s kind and brave, and generous and--
"I mean, mate," Ron said with a wide smile, "it's a little true. Anyway, you rushed out of there like you have a plan."
Potter’s face dropped down to his shirt, which looked quite high quality once Draco got a good look at it, and his face had flushed with humiliation and sadness instead.
Harry looks at him, his eyes are so soft when they’re stunned and happy and Draco feels the urge again to make him look like that as often as possible. He didn’t realize Harry Potter was capable of such profound sweetness.
Draco doesn’t wait to see what threat Harry can come up with. Instead, he slicks himself up and pushes in gently. True to form, Harry lets out this little shocked gasp when he’s all the way inside. It’s so wet, and hot, and goddamn tight that Draco quietly loses his mind for a moment.
Draco looks at him, his cold grey eyes boring holes into his head. Harry has long since accepted that Draco almost always looks crisp and aloof unless he's actively happy. Finally, he nods, "I'll be there."
Refocused, he uses both arms for leverage to thrust faster and harder, keeping a firm eye on Harry’s face, which is tilted back in pleasure.
Harry hears Draco follow him, but Draco doesn’t respond for a moment, before he very quietly says, “don’t joke about that.”
Instead, Draco had been hurting the other man. Draco is not an idiot, Potter will tolerate this for a bit if he feels that he wants to, but he’s a prideful man. He’ll never endure it for long.
Draco sees Potter two days later at The Blind Dragon. He works there most nights if he hasn’t been able to find Ministry event work. It's kind of a shitty pub, but the owners don’t care what Draco does as long as he is making them money. Tonight’s drink special is a bit of an experiment- Minty Mermaid Breath. A mixture of mermaid tears, gillywater with a firewhiskey wash, so strong it’ll knock your socks off, and cure any cavities.
Still, Draco doesn’t actually make him do anything until five pm rolls around. Roughly the time one would get ready for the Ministry ball. Harry is immediately suspicious.
“I-- I didn’t know-- I didn’t know it was possible-- to feel like this,” Harry stutters out between thrusts.
Draco rolls his eyes a little but his face splits into a beam, “of course you do, Potter. As you should, here I am slaving over birthday parties for you--”
Draco can barely keep his eyes open, so with one last kiss to Harry’s forehead, he falls asleep with a smile on his face.
He closed his eyes to enjoy the feeling of Draco's warm flesh on his and the gentle kisses on his neck. Draco had learned quickly that Harry responded much better to gentle, soft touches than to rough hard ones, which even Harry hadn't known until he began seeing Draco. No other lover had ever touched him this way, so he simply didn't think he liked it.
This is the standard, bland non-answer he normally gave to people when they commented on the quality of his charms. He did this for two reasons, one is that it is a good non-answer. It doesn’t indicate where or how he learned these charms. The second is that he hopes to impress these people with the quality of his magic. With the right luck, one of these days, one of these old men is going to want to have a discussion with him.
Draco bit back a bit of hysterical laughter. Between jobs was a very funny way of expressing Potter’s current livelihood as a Hero for Hire.
The album itself wasn't bad if the reviews were to be believed, but he could have done without the not so subtle references to him and their ill-fated six-month romance.
Potter is grinning now, who knew he had dimples. Certainly not Draco, who avoids Witch Weekly covers like the plague when the Most Charming Smile Award is announced every year. He can handle staring at the mass of black curls and sharp green eyes when they are looking determined or heroic… Happy is somehow more startling.
Strangely, Harry can't help but feel like no one has ever known him better despite knowing almost nothing about him.
Draco sits up a bit, hitching Harry’s legs more firmly around his waist, and reaches down to grab Harry’s hand. With one arm resting on the bed, keeping him upright, and held tight in Harry’s unrelenting grip, Draco thrusts into him. Firm and hard but slower than he usually does. Without thinking, Draco brings Harry’s hand to his lips and presses a sweet kiss to the back of it, where a nasty scar is etched into his sin.
"I'm not very good with kids," Draco says eventually, after watching the pair in the picture for a few more minutes. "But I'll try my best."
It's a gentle prod, asking Harry without asking him, and Harry is feeling languid enough to answer. "My godfather, Sirius Black, was the best godfather I could have asked for. He was the first person who had ever been
Then Potter lays a tender kiss on his cheek, and Draco melts, which means he instinctually snaps, “don’t be so clingy.”
Draco reaches forward, and Harry finally drops his arms and lets Draco pull him into a tender kiss. Draco intends for it to be passionate and sexy, but the second he’s cradling Harry’s skull, gently cupping it with his hand, he can’t help but soften.
Granger the Red and Potter stare at him, then the glass for a long minute, before the former Weasley says, “that was bloody brilliant.”
Harry went about making it, his mind halfway with Draco and halfway with Aunt Petunia drilling the recipe into his head. Dudley had told him later, in one of their pub nights after the war ended, that it was his grandmother's recipe.
The photoshoot took all afternoon, and by the time Harry was done, all he wanted to do was curl up in bed and pass out. When he finally got back to Number 12 Grimmauld Place, it was five in the evening. He had renovated the place, of course, but with its vaulted, impressive height and plethora of empty rooms, it only ever served to make him feel more alone.
“Charming,” Harry says dully. “I can relive my childhood trauma, but at least I’ll be able to write my grocery list on my phone. Why are you here anyway?”
Draco can’t help the laugh that bubbles out of him, which causes Potter to stare at him like he’s never seen Draco smile. Which, is unfortunately, possibly true.
She looks at him like she’s never seen him before, “I can’t believe you’ve done this your whole life.”
The only benefit is the party is over. It was four in the morning, after all. Draco knocked on the door.
Harry Potter appears eventually, his dark skin standing out among the pale faces swarming the ballroom. He’s built quick and slight and has always been unnaturally light on his feet. Sharp reflexes, paired with swift, precise body movements that look exactly the same as they have for as long as Draco has known him. And as much as it pains him to admit it, he’s known Potter a long time.
"What did the Shepards pie ever do to you?" Draco asks, lightly teasing, dragging Harry back to the present.
“This was the best birthday I’ve ever had in my entire life,” Harry says, looking up at Draco’s gray eyes. “I love you too, by the way.”
With that, he twists up and swoops Teddy into his arms, carrying him clean above his head with the momentum. Teddy's answering giggle did something violent to Harry's heart.
Harry barely gets the words out before Draco attacks his lips again, causing him to laugh against Draco's tall, hard body.
Draco hadn’t realized how much he needed to hear that; his body sagged in relief. “I’m… I didn’t mean to make you think I didn’t. I just didn’t want you to think I was a fan, or a groupie, or something else detestable.”
"Oh goodness," Andromeda says, her voice some mixture of exasperated and charmed which she often is around Harry. "Let me get a picture of you two boys in your matching jackets."
However, in this particular moment, with this particular audience, all it does is serve to remind them--
Harry chuckles sheepishly, “thanks. I can’t believe I forgot about the door. You really must have fucked my brain out.”
Potter’s full lips twisted into a smirk of recognition. Now that he’s far enough from the toxic elements of war, he can see his teenage obsession more clearly now- a crush. He wishes he had known when they were in school, might have saved him some time and he could have avoided being a part of a fascist death cult.
Of all the hurdles that Harry thought he would have to overcome to become an Auror, he felt that not having his NEWTs would be the one that ultimately tripped him up.
When he woke up, it was to a soft gasp in his sleep about two hours later. Harry immediately whipped out his wand and prepared a hex on his tongue before realizing that it was Draco.
Draco feels Harry smile and presses down, “and your smile. It’s the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. It makes me want to see you smile all the time.”
The first thing he did after that meeting was going to Ron, the way that he always went to Ron first.
Draco stops what he's doing and looks at him again; this time, his eyes glitter with mirth as his lips twist into a smile. "You're a bad influence, Saint Potter."
Draco is not paying attention, instead he turns his attention to Harry’s flank, running his hands down the stretch marks and luxuriating in the feeling of warm skin against his palm. It had been much too long. Draco and Arnold, his co-worker at The Blind Dragon occasionally hook up, but truly nothing like this.
After dinner, they curl up under a quit to watch a muggle movie later, with Draco helpfully giving him very keen insight ("muggles often carry their cellphones in their back pockets," Draco replies wisely watching the protagonist slip his phone into his jeans. "I know this, having spent time among them.") They get about halfway through before Harry gets a Patronus.
“Oh, when I was in Greece last year helping out with a mild centaur problem they were having, I met this guy who needed a favor…. Has a Boggart infestation, pretty unusual actually. Don’t usually run into more than one of them, but he’s got 6 living in his basement, turning his place into a house of horrors. I’ll be going over in a week to take a look, maybe get rid of them.”
when he has the time. It is an excellent place to get some work done, and so far, none of the paparazzi have figured out where he is. Besides that, he likes watching Draco work. He likes watching his lean, elegant figure swan across space, mixing and chatting with patrons. Draco had a remarkable way of elevating everyone he spoke to, instead of condescending or seeming too good. He just acted as though everyone in the room was a Duke.
“I will,” Draco promises, pressing a kiss to the inside of Harry’s thigh. Finally, he adds a third stretching and adding more lube. Draco thinks there probably won’t be any pain, with how thoroughly he’s preparing Harry.
It had been tragic to watch, which is actually why Draco had met back up with Potter in the first place.
They try to be kind to him. Draco sees their effort; it’s just that they talk about their experiences or their work when they’re together. Nearly all of them have gone into the highest rungs of society, the perks of victory, and almost all of them occasionally mention the war. Sometimes just in passing--
Harry clutches at his arm when Draco shifts to go to the kitchen to get some glasses for water. Now that he’s focused on something else, Draco realizes he’s parched.
Legend has it that after defending a tribe of Bowtruckle against an invading band of Hippogriffs, they gave him their loyalty, and now he has a rotating cast of sentinels guarding his vegetable patch.
“Please do me the favor of shutting up, Draco,” Harry replies. They’ve worked together closely on hundreds of cases at this point, and they had long ago ceased with any real hostility. Besides, the semi-regular, semi-casual sex they have doesn’t hurt.
“Master has been brooding for three hours,” Buffy says judgmentally. They may have stayed with him out of loyalty, but they’ve gotten snarkier.
“Kiss me,” Harry says, when Draco spends another minute tracing his cheekbone and the curve of his ear. “Please.”
Draco shakes his head again, “so you… brewed a Polyjuice and, what? Broke into the Slytherin Common Room?”
"You did great with Teddy," Harry says between kisses. He feels Draco's hands reach to grab his ass and pull him slightly higher to get a better grip.
Harry, for his part, looks up at him with those sharp, gleaming eyes, and nods. “Let’s get out of here.”
"Oh Merlin, I forgot about that one. The magazine isn't talking about the raunchy ones," Harry replies with a groan, before checking the time. "Anyway, I think I'm going to head back. Hermione wants me to do a photoshoot for a charity calendar." Harry says this last bit with distaste. He knows that his calendars always sell like hotcakes, and it raises a ton of money, but it still feels uncomfortable.
Still, Draco is helpless in the face of Harry Potter and always has been. He slows down though, he’s wanted this in the back of his mind for so long so he takes the moment to savor it. Running his pale finger along Harry’s plump bottom lip, which opens immediately into a startled gasp, Draco can’t help but smirk.
Draco goes home to the Manor, which couldn’t be more different from Potter’s modern penthouse apartment. His house elves, all technically free but all of whom refused to leave, vanish his coat immediately, and he feels his shoes replaced with fluffy slippers.
The thought fills Harry with another beam of unexpected joy, so he quickly turns away and walks towards the kitchen before his soppy feelings read too clearly on his face. "I saw that you have some stuff for Shepard's pie. Does that sound good to you?
"Teddy is going to love you," Harry says sincerely because Teddy loves everyone. "This will be great."
“So, you had a good night?” Draco mutters into his ear as they slowly dance in the warm summer air. The scent of salt water fills Harry’s sense and mixes with the smell of Draco’s expensive cologne. He can’t believe that this man did all of this, made this perfect day, just for him.
“I think,” Draco says honestly because he and his therapist worked a lot on this. Honesty is key. “I think I like you. Not just for tonight, and if you’re amenable to that I would like to make you breakfast tomorrow and take you to dinner sometime. If you’re not… That’s fine, I understand. But I’m not really looking for anything casual.”
Draco smiles and pulls away gently with a tender kiss on Harry's head. "Yeah, stay. And if you want… Stay until I come back. I'd like to go to sleep with you in my bed tonight."
Harry can't quite help the glowing gooey feeling that enters his limbs, so he flings himself without much dignity into Draco's arms. He'll be embarrassed about it tomorrow, but now, still groggy from his nap, he feels quite overcome.
They played like that for another hour or two before Draco frowned reluctantly and said, "terribly sorry, aunt, and little cousin Edward… But I have a shift at work soon that I must get ready for. But I'm sure I will see you both again."
“Can I fuck you?” Draco says, pulling off Harry with a pop and gently pulling his hand out of Harry’s grip.
Harry looks taken aback, but Draco decides to distract him with a kiss. He runs his hands up and down Harry’s back, feeling for scars and indentations. For a moment, as insane as it is, he has the desire to know Harry’s body so well he could name a scar blindfolded.
Harry shakes his head, that shy grin appearing on his face again. Draco can’t believe all this time he had denied himself this, Harry Potter allowing himself to be vulnerable with him.
Harry is smirking at him, looking up through impossibly dark lashes and Draco can’t help but sigh internally. He should have guessed that Harry would be the insatiable type.
“Don’t you dare,” Harry said with a watery voice. “I’m just... This is just.. the most wonderful thing anyone has ever done for me.”
Harry laughs, burying his head into the crook of Draco’s shoulder and Draco thinks he’s going to explode. How can one person make him feel so much in such a short period of time?
Harry shoots up from his place on Draco's chest to look him in the eye. His brain buzzing with hope and terror did Draco mean it? Was its afterglow? Could it be true? "
Potter smiles and takes a sip. Draco watches as the drink hits his tongue and perks him up, the sharp tang of mint, tempered by the mellow darkness of the Gillywater blend in harmony.
If he had a partner like himself, a lover, he doesn't think he'd be able to open up. Be ready to trust them, because they so clearly don't trust him.
Not because he was ashamed, but because he didn't want to deal with the shitstorm that story would surely be without talking to Draco first.
“You take it so beautifully,” Draco says. His voice has never been lower. Harry’s thigh is shaking on his shoulder.
Harry shakes his head, “hey, no. That isn’t the point. The best Aurors never lose their sense of horror, of injustice. If you stop being hurt by these things, you start seeing people as victims or perpetrators. You forget that they were probably funny, or had friends. I know most bosses don’t tell you this, but my favorite Aurors are always the ones with thin skin.”
Harry laughs, “no, I mean, yes. I want to. It’s just… I’m quite a bit more scared than you are. Don’t want you to…”
“Well I suppose, Malfoy,” he says, standing in front of the bar. It has always amused Draco that Potter was so short, especially given the intensity that emanates off of him in waves. “I suppose, I was in the neighborhood and fancied a pint.”
Or at least, he definitely doesn’t know him the way he knew the boy he teased about Dementors. Draco wonders if Potter developed that ass in that time he took to transform from gawky teenage boy to living legend.
Draco nodded and smoothed down his beautiful hair. He was dressed well, all clean lines and soothing colors. Harry, for his part, had donned a Chudley Cannon's jersey on his way out the door that was wearing an alarming shade of orange.
He heads for the door when Potter slides in front of him. He’s flushed and happy, and he looks good like this- when he’s surrounded by people who love him and by people he loves.
Potter, luckily, is just tipsy enough not to ask why he didn’t seem sick earlier. “I’ll owl you later, get some rest.”
"That's not stupid," Harry says, his throat feeling oddly tight. "That's… Really wonderful. Thank you, Draco."
They look at each other for a moment, before Draco concedes. "I would like that; no one has cooked for me in quite some time."
Harry feels laughter bubble out of him at the rapid, immediate words followed by Andromeda's sharp, "Teddy!"
Draco doesn’t hold too much in store by rumors anyway. After all, there was a rumor that Potter time traveled in the third year.
Draco nods before he presses his lips to Harry’s neck causing the other man to sigh in pleasure. He even bites down, gently at first, before Harry’s moans encourage him to leave dark splotches on brown skin.
"I just," Draco says, "you're my priority. I want to take care of you… I guess what I'm trying to say is that I love you."
"My cousin?" Teddy says, his sweet face looking sharply away from Harry to the new person in their midst. Draco is standing awkwardly stiff, his back straight with his hand stretched out.
He kisses Harry lushly, because Harry is clearly the impatient type in bed, and he needs to be slowed down. He presses kisses down his scarred, dark chest paying attention to Harry’s intensely sensitive nipples before continuing down.
Harry also enjoyed watching Draco get more comfortable with Teddy over time, loosening up and getting downright rowdy. He glanced over to see Teddy and Draco playing 'dragon slayer' with Draco's skin again charmed into scales.
His time in Northern Ireland is less exciting than he hoped it would be. The cult got Jeff on a very weak imperius curse and then left him alone, apparently confident enough that no one would come looking for him.
Robards sighed, "yes… But you're also, well Potter; you're a bit obsessive. It almost doesn't matter what case I give you, even the simple ones you somehow manage to make complicated."
Draco writhes dramatically, and Harry is reminded of all of Draco's overdramatic and theatrical tendencies from youth. "You'll have to kill me before I concede defeat! For I am the great and ferocious Dragon!"
“Why not? They’re doing trivia this year, and I have a sneaking suspicion you’ll win, the prize is a brand new MiriPhone.”
Draco, of course, doesn’t shut up. “I’m thinking new-Auror Harry for my outfit, back when you actually wore the uniform.”
Potter thinks Draco doesn’t like him. He looks at his face in the mirror, pale, with his white-blond hair neatly combed. He was wearing dress robes, but no one else was. He thought of Potter’s face when he had turned up, dressed in his neat, traditional robes- he remembers the way his face flushed with surprise, then amusement, and then
Draco nods, feeling messy hair against his cheek. The emotions confuse him for a moment, not sure exactly how he got here or how it happened, and maybe even quietly amused by the fact that all he had to do to woo Harry Potter was not be a truly terrible person.
"Don't worry," Harry reassures, "you'll probably be a better influence on him. I'm always telling him about how I rode a dragon and fought a griffin. Andy thinks I'm going to turn him into a problem child."
This startles a clearly reluctant chuckle out of Potter, who hugs her back and straightens his spine. “I think we better get back. Soon enough, Ron is going to rev up the karaoke machine, and I need to see that shit show again.”
Draco nods, leaning forward a little. Potter is a handsome man, with his long lashes, and bright eyes popping on his dark skin. “I’m glad to be of service, Mr. Potter.”
“Oh no, Harry,” Granger the Brain says, her voice fretting. “You’re supposed to be giving a speech on the plight of merpeople who are facing climate change.”
The small circle chatting is quiet for a second before it erupts into laughter. Cho Chang cackles as she brings her drink to her lips. Draco finds this, somehow, the most challenging. When they’re not discussing pain, or trauma, or anything terrible, but instead the day to day life of a person on the run. They have these funny stories, and they’re okay to tell because, ultimately, they were on the right side.
Draco's face remains still, but his eyes flutter closed for a moment and open again like he was committing the moment to memory before nodding.
Harry laughs, “there is a muggle show, it’s called… Anyway, it doesn’t matter. What does your house-elf have to do with you being here?”
A month into training, he had been shadowing a completely incompetent Auror. Sure, she had managed to solve the simple crime of who had stolen the cursed painting of Bathilda Bagshot, but she had not been curious as to why anyone would want a cursed version of a portrait that is widely available. Bagshot has her chocolate frog for Merlin's sake.
Draco went on about his day, and how he had a brilliant idea for a new cocktail, and that he had some ideas for investors for his bar. For the thousandth time, Harry wishes that Draco was less stubborn and let Harry at least help. He's not naive enough to think that his name wouldn't be useful. But Harry wasn't stupid enough to bring it up again, the last time he had resulted in the first and most furious fight of their fledgling relationship.
“When I was on the run,” Dean Thomas, a man Draco barely knows and certainly didn’t think he had been forced to spend a year on the run, “we met these
The one that featured a sexy treacle tart that was meant to seduce him into taking a poisoned bite was strangely charming.
Harry makes a noise that makes Draco look up, and he’s surprised to see there Harry’s eyes look a bit wet.
Harry stares at him for a second before his face splits into an unbelievably radiant smile. “I like you too.”
Draco inclines his head and bites back a noise of surprise. Of course, Potter found him. Of course. Draco is currently in Telford, a small town nearly three hours from London where Potter likely lives. The Blind Dragon is the only wizarding establishment in the entire county.
"It is the land, but it also isn't the land," Jeff says with frustration. "It's like they are tapping into the general atmospheric magic, but without someone channeling it, nothing would happen."
Harry’s pretty lips split into a sunny smile, and Draco realizes this is what he’s been afraid of all along. Harry is fully capable of ruining Draco for all other men.
Almost no one knew the reason why he had quit the Aurors. Well, technically speaking, he had been fired, but since he walked out of the meeting, they had recorded it as leaving.
Harry never really meant to make his past such a mystery. Tragically, so much of what he has done and been through can't be shared. The truth of the Philosopher's Stone, what happened in the Chamber of Secrets (the fact that Ginny's name managed never to get tied to that whole mess is the single best accomplishment of Dumbledore's career as far as Harry's concerned), the time travel his third year, the Hallows, the Horcruxes, all the details about Tom Riddle's past… It is all a secret, secrets he'll take to his grave.
He says that last bit self consciously, like he’s embarrassed that even his body had trouble accommodating something that lovely.
“You know,” Harry says eventually, his fingers now tracing his cheekbones and nose, “when I saw a kid in the muggle world, all of the princes and superheroes in their story look like you do now.”
"No," Draco said, his face tightening before going very, very soft, "no. I'm glad you were here. It was nice to come back to."
"I have one more gift," Harry says, effectively distracting Teddy from Draco's shimmering blue-green scales. He pulls out the child-sized boom. It has some fairly significant height and speed restrictions and a series of auto-trigger spells if the child falls off. "Ta-da!'
“Blimey,” Potter finally says, opening the door, shirtless and exhausted, “did you forget something?”
“Or,” Draco says, “you don’t have to. Obviously. I’m just glad you’re here, with that fantastic ass.”
Harry laughed, "don't worry about me. I've been in and out of a few scrapes, besides," Harry can't help but pause for dramatic effect, "I'm never really alone."
Draco remains seated and gestures for Harry to go to the fireplace. He’s not a saint, after all, and he wants a little bit of a view. Harry looks confused but walks towards the fireplace with Draco eventually following- keeping his eyes trained on Harry’s plush ass.
Two twists later, bottles of alcohol float into the air and pour the liquid from three feet above. The liquors inside, twisting and dancing around each other, before a roaring stream of simple syrup r\took the form of an elf, and engulfed it all, before laying placidly into a glass.
Harry doesn’t answer the question, instead he turns around and presses his shoulders to the mattress while arching back. The view is undeniably spectacular, even more so when he adds a snarky, “Better get to it then.”
“Can I ask you a question you may not want to answer?” Draco asks after a calm silence. Harry nods so Draco continues, “what happened between you and the youngest Weasley girl? You just seemed so happy with her, way back when.”
Harry laughs a little, “it’s okay. It was years ago now, and they’re happy. Ginny told me later… She didn’t want to spend her whole life being the sweet wife waiting for her adventuring husband to return from battle, she wanted to be the one out there not the one waiting. And with Neville, she gets to do that.”
“What?” Potter’s voice is shy, the way it rarely is. Draco used to think Potter wasn’t capable of being shy, but he’s been proven wrong.
Buffy nods, and he does notice that he’s been staring blankly ahead in his fluffy slippers and feels a bit stiff.
Ron stopped, his gaze went calculated, and they walked out together. Harry had never been more grateful (another lie; he was thankful every goddamn day) to pick that compartment on the train all those years ago.
"I do have a plan," Harry said, power walking to an alley where they could apparate to his place. "I have a desk full of letters asking for help. And I say, you and me… Why don't we answer them."
Draco’s voice seems to shock Potter out of sleep. He covers his chest self-consciously as if he didn’t want Draco to see his body in the light, and Draco feels something twinge in him.
“I love the noises you make,” Draco growls. Harry makes another as Draco pulls back slowly and rocks in again, this gorgeous hitching sigh that he doesn’t seem fully conscious of.
Harry nods frantically, a bottle of lube flying out of the drawer before Draco can even ask, which makes him laugh. He slicks his fingers and presses one in slowly, watching Harry’s eyes roll back. Usually, Draco starts with two fingers and doesn’t give Harry much time to adjust. Draco had been scared that drawing it out would make Harry change his mind.
Draco finally manages to lean over and get a hand on Harry’s cock, stroking while Harry whines and screams below him triggering his own release.
Draco nods, because he is lonely. It’s not so bad, after all, he does have big plans even if they’re moving slower than he had hoped. Draco knows he’s going to open his big, beautiful, chic bar one day, and it’s going to be a success. He’s going to open several, and he’ll make the money back and he’ll be better than his parents were. And then their parents were. It doesn’t leave a  lot of time to worry about the state of his social or love life.
Draco isn’t sure why he decided to come to this stupid party. Well, he does know. Potter asked him to come, with those stupidly green eyes that sometimes seem half the size of his bloody face. He had even pouted, with those thick lips which regularly drive Draco to madness.
He reaches his hands down Harry’s pants, moaning as his perfectly round cheek jiggles slightly in his hands. Draco is now convinced he’s going to die.
“My parents had already been married, had a child, and died by the time they were my age,” Harry says.
Draco’s gaze turns feral, “I do so love your smart arse. I wonder if I can send you in limping tomorrow.”
It looked the same as any of the other dozens of times he had been to the cottage. Just as warm and airy, the kitchen and living room smelled like fresh bread that Draco had baked earlier that week, and Harry couldn't help himself, he laid down on the soft couch and forgot to set the alarm.
Draco raises his eyebrow at the phrase, “Harry, I think there is quite literally no way for you to do anything else. You’re a nosy, specky git and that hasn’t changed. Now tell me, what was that file you were looking at earlier?”
In the years that pass, almost no one knows the truth of why Harry Potter and Ron Weasley quit the Auror Department together. Even fewer know how they set up their company.
Even this part, Harry thought, was pretty straightforward. He wonders if he is getting better at this, or if Voldemort sets such a high standard for evil, everyone else comes up short.
"Sorry," Harry replies, double-checking that his wand was in his holster. His bag of healing potions was still inside his waterproof, mostly curse proof cloak, which had pockets that are charmed with an undetectable extension and feather-light charms. The other pocket held: nutrition and hydration potions, defensive potions, some polyjuice, a tiny bit of liquid luck, the invisibility cloak, and two portraits. One of Albus Dumbledore and one of Severus Snape that he occasionally went to for guidance. "I need to take care of something. I'll be back before Saturday, so I'll come to pick you up before we see Teddy."
Harry rolls his eyes, “one-track mind. But, no idea- I guess I was just never eating enough, because once I did… Well, it happened so quickly I have stretch marks.”
"Thank you, but don't worry, I'm not done getting ready yet." With that, Harry reached into his cloak pocket and pulled out his favorite leather jacket. He got Teddy a tiny matching version, and he couldn't wait to wear it together.
“Harry,” Draco, says to placate him, “you know this isn’t a good idea. But if you want to get a drink, I get off in two hours- why don’t you take care of whatever business brought you here and come back then? I’ll make us both drinks.”
Draco wants to take it back, but he wants to run more, so he does. He walks out of the apartment, takes the muggle elevator down twenty-five floors, and then goes to the back, where they have set up a small apparition point in the building for the magical tenants.
“You have a beautiful cock too, Harry,” Draco says, looking up to see Harry laugh in surprised embarrassment.
It was a war hero party. Potter probably wouldn’t describe it that way; he would describe it as a group of his friends. But just looking around, he can tell this is a war hero party, and it’s big. Draco never took Potter as the type to want to host, but apparently, Potter is. Potter loves hosting large gatherings for his friends and loved ones; he caters fancy food and hires a bartender. He lets Lee Jordan pick the music, and everyone has a beautiful time.
Plus, the look on Ron's face when Harry had mentioned in passing that Draco was obsessed with his ass was going to be his Patronus memory for a year.
Harry and Teddy both smile at the camera she summoned before making silly faces, and then Harry says, "I have one more gift."
"Harry?" Draco asks nervously, watching Harry deck himself out. Harry wishes this was happening at any other time. Draco hasn't seen him go back to work yet, as he was just doing some research to make sure he was around to see where this new relationship went.
When he finally came, nearly sobbing into the pleasure by the end of so much sensitivity, Draco was close behind. Harry basks in the afterglow, taking a moment to wandlessly will the sweat and body fluids off of both of them.
“What can I get you?” Draco asks, instead of saying anything. He’s too old to get into fights with Harry Potter, who Draco is not even sure really knows anymore.
“Do you have any idea how many laws I broke? I brewed an illegal Polyjuice Potion when I was twelve… And I’m not sure how to tell you this, but I didn’t try to defeat Voldemort because he violated section 3c of the tax code.”
If only all of my projects went this well, Harry thought to himself. And he got some very excellent goat's milk from grateful townspeople out of it.
Draco raises his eyebrows in surprise, not expecting Potter to fold so quickly, and without any fuss.
The thing is, Draco does like Potter. Very much. He loves him. Sometimes, after Potter has been so thoroughly fucked by Draco he literally collapses, Draco watches him sleep. He takes careful stock of the scars and the way Potter’s face looks so young when he’s asleep. On nights like those, Draco lets himself hold Potter all night, carefully stroking his hair and face while pressing gentle kisses to his hair and forehead. It’s embarrassingly tender, and Draco is lucky Potter has never noticed it.
“Oh,” Harry says, and he sounds completely overcome. Draco wants to spend the rest of his life ripping these vulnerable noises from this invulnerable man. “Oh, Draco, please. I’m so close.”
"Harry! You're back early," she exclaimed. "And who may this be?" She looked at Malfoy, who sneered at her.
In response to this, Harry gave Draco's arse a pinch, causing the blond to let out another undignified squeak.
"Coming!" Draco said. He turned around, making sure to let his arse sway enticingly. He could feel Harry's eyes on him but he didn't care. "Accio pasta," he called and Harry's food came flying into the room.
Ron looked like he was about to ask Harry a ton of questions, but thankfully they were in a meeting and he couldn't do that. Harry shoved his papers at Ron, and almost tripped on his feet while trying to stand up when the lips started sucking on his cock again. He clutched his stomach and hightailed it out of the room.
More feathers started attacking him, going from his crotch to his belly and sides, although the onslaught on his cock and hole didn't stop. It was then that Harry, the traitorous monster, joined in, his fingers digging mercilessly into Draco's belly. Harry's tongue even went into his belly button, causing Draco to curse and try to slap his face away with his belly. Harry just laughed at him, tongue poking into his belly button once more, when the feathers and Harry's fingers continued tormenting the poor blond.
"Give me a break, Malfoy. Do I look like I can see through walls? How am I supposed to know you were around the corner?" Harry rolled his eyes.
Harry Potter was standing at the other side of the doors and - Draco loathed to admit - looking quite fit in his Auror robes. He gave Draco a once over and his mouth was open wide as he took in what must be a very embarrassing scene. Draco could feel a deep blush spreading across his cheeks and down his neck.
One of the perks of being the husband of the Savior, Draco thought, was having a luxury vacation - all expenses paid - at a tropical island.
"Are you seriously going to make a sex video? My, my..." he tutted, staring at Harry's erection, but it turned into a squeak as Harry reached for him and yanked his briefs down.
"At least it's better than the Slytherin dungeons," Harry snapped back. He watched Malfoy raise a tiny eyebrow at that.
"Yes! Yes! Daddy!!!" James replied enthusiastically and gave Harry a big sloppy kiss on the cheek. "I got toys from Papa!" he proceeded to point towards the various toys stewn on the floor.
Draco usually released one video per week, and Friday night was the time for Harry to catch Draco's newest video, as well as binge watch the rest of his videos and wank to images of the blond angel.
"Don't you dare, love." Harry snarled into his ear, biting down on it and speeding up his thrusts. "You're going to come on my cock and my cock alone."
Draco seemed to have read every lewd comment on his video (some of which were from Harry himself) and responded to his fans' requests. This time round, he was wearing nothing but an apron and form fitting jeans, claiming that the weather recently had been too hot and he "didn't want to get his clothes dirty, anyway".
Draco nodded. He almost drooled at the sight of Harry's cock, the head an angry red colour, standing up proudly among a nest of black curls as messy as the hair on his head. It was bigger than anything he'd ever had, and Draco could see a drop of precome forming at the tip. He moaned.
Unfortunately, Draco got a shock when Harry carried him without warning. Coupled with another kick from their baby and the amount of pee he was holding inside, Draco finally lost control of his bladder, sobbing into Harry's shoulder as he felt pee wetting his swim trunks and upper thighs, and splashing onto the sand below.
Silver eyes widened as Draco opened the box and took out his hawthorn wand. "You kept it all this time?"
The next Friday, Harry hurriedly left the office and made a beeline for his apartment. He opened his YouTube app and was excited to see that Draco's new video had been uploaded. Draco was baking a lavender infused ice cream cake, but Harry was too nervous to concentrate on Draco's arse this time round. He anxiously scrolled towards the end of the video, praying to all the gods in the world.
"Have you fixed the lift yet?" Draco ground out from between his teeth. He could feel more pee threatening to come out.
Harry didn't give Draco a chance to say more before he spread his arse cheeks open and drove in again. "Fuck!" Draco cried out when Harry hit his prostate on the first thrust, hands grappling unsteadily at the counter, his pliant body being pushed forward at each thrust.
Harry took that as an invitation and his wandering hands reached the waistband of Draco's jeans. As he made to unbutton it, he felt his hands being pulled away.
"I recently reached 100,000 subscribers on this channel. Thank you so much; it's a great achievement for someone new like me," Draco drawled. "As a giveaway, I will be inviting one lucky subscriber to bake with me."
Harry felt as if the day had gone by in a flash. When he went to bed that night, his dreams were filled with nothing but images of platinum blond hair and soft, pale skin.
"Please...please excuse me," Harry stammered, before his boss could add any more scathing remarks. He turned to Ron, quickly telling him to cover for his presentation if he didn't return by then.
"I didn't think you'd care to know about Malfoy's whereabouts, Harry. Are you suspecting he's up to something again?"
"Can I see him?" Draco asked, while discreetly placing a hand over his crotch. He was glad the tablecloth could cover him.
. He hadn't even made it into the toilet cubicle, when the sensation of his cock pounding into the invisible throat began. It was all Harry could do to clutch at his clothed erection and let out a hissed "Fuck, Draco!" before shooting his load into his pants.
Draco nodded, his eyes fluttering shut. Pleased with himself, Harry continued his exploration of Draco's lithe body. His friends always chided him for acting before thinking, but in this situation, Harry could give himself a pat on the back for making it work to his advantage.
At this thought, Harry squeezed around his erection and moved again, so fast his wrist ached. He came with a powerful intensity, just as he imagined Draco begging for more of his cock and the delicious moans coming out of the blond as he fucked into him. Harry was so exhausted, he fell asleep right after that.
wasn't moving, and his bladder wasn't cooperating at all. If anything, he felt hungry and he needed to pee even more. What he needed was a bit of distraction. Draco started pacing around the perimeter of the lift, checking his reflection in the mirror. He frowned at the dark circles under his eyes and made a mental note to moisturise and have a good rest once he got home.
In spite of his friends' teasing, Harry was curious. "What YouTube channel?" he asked, then quickly added "I want to try baking too, if that means I get to enjoy such delicious cookies all the time."
He couldn't help it. Once he started to pee, he tried to hold it in but it wouldn't stop. The stream of piss was never ending, and Draco could feel his underwear, jeans and expensive shoes totally soaked through. He began sobbing, thinking of how the mystery stranger would call him a freak now, when the man's beefy hand brushed away some hair from Draco's forehead and turned the blond around to face him.
Draco laughed at that, the sound making Harry smile as well. "Don't worry about me, Harry, nobody gets past Goyle. He's the security guard and one of my best friends. Even though he's a bit slow sometimes, he does have good intuition when it comes to people."
Harry just gave him a mischievous smile, wrapping his arms around Draco's waist and giving him a kiss. Draco's arms instantly slipped around Harry's neck, trying to pull him closer. Harry started biting at the blond's lower lip lightly and Draco gasped at the sensation. He opened his mouth to let Harry's tongue in, his hands cupping Harry's cheeks tenderly and stroking the black stubble. Someone was moaning, either himself or Harry or both, but he couldn't be arsed to care.
. And secondly, I'm not a pet! Especially not Pot-mmmph" Malfoy's whiny voice was cut off when Harry grabbed him and clamped a finger over his mouth.
"Yeah, it's from a car accident that happened when I was a baby. My parents died, and I was the only survivor." Harry didn't know what it was about Draco that made him want to talk about his past. He usually wouldn't reveal so much personal information to a stranger, but everything came out naturally in front of Draco.
"Open up for me, yeah, sweetheart?" Harry murmured, lifting an eyebrow expectantly and Draco felt heat instantly gather in his lower stomach, drool pooling in his mouth as he opened up properly, so that Harry could slide two fingers inside. "That's good," he whispered. "Get them nice and wet for daddy, yeah?"
"Yeah, baby," Harry breathed out, and the hand through Draco's hair, curved around the back of his head. "You can call me daddy." Draco whimpered and Harry's grip was almost bone-crushing on his hand. "But, baby...I don't share. Can't stand the thought of your pretty mouth on someone elses." Draco was already nodding his head rapidly before Harry had finished talking. "Yeah, baby?"
"Um..." Draco chewed down on his bottom lip, eyes lowered, eyelashes fluttering as he stared down at Harry's shiny mouth, just wanting to get all of this over with so that they could fall into bed together. "Can I—can I call you d-daddy?" He stammered a little, but he was proud of himself for getting the question out, and he lifted his eyes to meet Harry's.
There had been some times with Harry when he had felt himself beginning to float, but it had never felt quite like this before.
idea," he sounded strained and Draco tried to help, he tried to lifted himself up onto his elbows so that Harry could take off his jersey easier, but his whole body just wasn't working, everything felt as though it was both lighter and heavier at the same time and signals that his brain was trying to send to his limbs were being interrupted by the cotton wool that was filling his veins. "You're just...So
He didn't remember everything, it got a little hazy in some places, but he remembered Harry talking about how he had wanted to look after Draco, and how he'd wanted to touch him before, but had always just been waiting, but part of Draco had just let himself think of that as pillow talk, even when he got himself off to it in the nights that followed.
"Daddy?" The word was a little slurred and Harry huffed out a small laugh before he was dropping a kiss to Draco's nose.
"It was good," Draco's words were a little slurred and heavy from sleep, and it made Harry smile and the concerned wrinkles smooth out.
they had known each other—but Harry seemed to decide against it and started filling the smoothie machine.
—I always want to look at you. Always want to kiss you," Harry threw Draco's pants on the ground, and then finally took off his socks, stroking his fingers under the arch of Draco's feet, pressing his thumbs in briefly and making Draco moan and twitch. "Always want to touch you. Always—god, you
"Want...You to fill me up properly with y-your come," Draco said quietly, his cheeks burning red, his stomach twisting in a way that made his cock leak even more, his lubed hole clenching around
It was soft, and slow, and Draco's head almost immediately felt fuzzy and he felt his body melt forward as Harry's fingers spread out, across his cheeks, and then began to push gently through his blonde hair, moving around to cup the back of his head to tilt it to the side and Draco just let himself be moved carefully.
Harry gently helped him under the covers and sheets before stripping off the top duvet and whispering to Draco he would be back in a moment and disappearing with the dirty blanket, returning within what felt like seconds later, just like he promised, with a bottle of water in one hand and another blanket thrown over his shoulder.
But he'd never trusted someone to completely let go with before, that he knew wouldn't push him too far but would still give him what he needed to reach that special place inside his head, and that would be there afterwards to look after him.
"I thought...We could make waffles?" Draco chewed down on his bottom lip, eyes darting to the side, and Harry didn't hesitate to reassure him.
"Baby," Harry leaned forward to briefly bury his face in Draco's stomach and squeeze at his hips before he was pushing up the sweater but pulling down the shirt underneath. "You have
At first, it had been okay, but it had been almost five minute now, and Draco hated being crowded as it was, and he knew he should have just waited outside the club for Pansy Parkinson or Harry Potter before coming in.
Harry slung an arm around Draco's waist as he nuzzled in a little closer, although not as close as they woke up, because they always woke up intwined together even though there was this sliver of space between them whenever they actually went to sleep, but even though Harry's breathing started to deepened and even out, and it was the early hours of the morning after a long week, there was something buzzing at the back of Draco's mind that was stopping him from being able to go to sleep.
And then Harry bit down on the sensitive cartilage of his ear and Draco stiffened before his cock jerked.
Harry went slow, but he didn't stop, his cock stretching Draco until he was fully seated inside his lover, and Draco wasn't sure when he started making a low, guttural noise at the back of his throat, but his brain just felt so foggy and Harry felt so good and he was still kissing Draco's mouth, even though Draco was barely able to respond to him.
The first press of Harry's finger inside him had Draco's eyes jolting open and moaning loudly at the stretch.
"You okay?" Harry asked with a tilt of his head as he reached out his thick, calloused fingers and ran them down the side of Draco's face until they were resting under his chin, and Draco's eyelids instantly became heavy, an automatic reaction to Harry's touch.
Harry had been the only one to tattoo Draco, and Draco wanted him to be the only one to pierce him as well.
. And...It was perfect, you know?" He looked out of the corner of his eye at Harry and he saw Harry duck his head and smile at his knees. The weight on his chest felt just a little lighter in that moment. "Everything that happened between us was perfect, and I've never—I've never felt as good as I did a-and having that with
He felt safe, and warm, and ground...And loved, but that wasn't something he was quite ready to explore just yet.
, right from the roots, so that Draco's head was pulled off the bed, his face exposed to the cooler, less stifled air of the room, and he was cut off as he heaved in a deep breath.
"Shower," he answered, licking his dry lips and Harry nodded, getting off the bed and straightening up.
Harry's thrusts were almost brutal with how hard he began to thrust and Draco's more petite body instantly began to jerk forward on the bed, completely at Harry's mercy as the brunette gripped his hips and pulled him back to meet his thrusts.
Harry pursed his lips together and for a split second, Draco thought that he was going to say no, but then he was stepping aside and jerking his head backwards.
and then the greasy bag of donuts that one of those big hands was holding, before Harry looked back over his shoulder with an amused raise of his eyebrow. "Do you need some help finding the bedroom, baby?" He asked, and there was a slight
But then Harry was shoving back inside him, filling him up, and pleasure was fraying at every nerve ending in Draco's body and he let out a strangled cry, his body jerking and back arching, weakly trying to push back against Harry in search of more friction, but Harry just made a cooing noise behind him before he was kissing Draco's shoulder and then a big hand was circling around Draco's cock, nearly making him pass out at the white-hot pleasure that came with finally being touched.
His face was soft and gentle as Draco's hazy eyes landed on him, and Harry put down the bottle of water before throwing the blanket over them, and then he slid into bed next to Draco.
"You ready?" Harry's voice was a little muffled on the other side of the door, jolting Draco forward, and he opened the door quickly. Harry was standing a little further down the hallway and Harry tipped his head to the side. "Come on," he gave Draco a smile and Draco almost tripped over his boots to quickly walk over to him. He was a bit confused as to why they were opening the bathroom door together, and then Harry was shoving up the large window inside. "I'm trying to stop smoking inside so much," Harry explained with a sheepish grin. "Is that okay?" He was already climbing out the window, hitching himself up to the waist-height windowsill.
The idea of Harry getting angry at someone in public made Draco's cock twitch again and he let out a shaky breath, long, thin fingers stretching out over the duvet covers and trying to calm himself down.
there, and while that excited Draco, he bent down to take off his shoes before moving down the short hall to the bedroom.
Most nights that they went out with Harry and his friends, either just in a small group or at a party or out clubbing, he was going home with Harry, rather than with Pansy which was what had had happened at least half the time before, and so things were changing for them, and they were both changing with them.
himself panting, it sounded almost thunderous in his ears, the only other sound reaching him was Harry's voice and the lewd, squelching sounds that came from how wet he was from the lube. "I'm going to fuck you in your pretty panties, okay, baby?"
"Are you thirsty?" He asked quietly, and Draco nodded ever so slightly, his head still feeling so heavy, and almost detached from his neck. Harry smiled as he picked up the water bottle, and he held it to Draco's lips, helping him drink while sliding a hand behind his head and cupping it to make sure his throat was open and he didn't choke. "Feel okay?" He asked and Draco managed another small nod as Harry took away the bottle and put it on the bedside table, turning off the light and sliding down so he was laying next to Draco.
you were looking at me but you would go all red when I looked back at you and would pretend that you were looking somewhere else, but—I get that now, right?" Draco swallowed so hard his throat clicked as Harry lifted his chin with a gentle finger underneath. "I get you?"
But Pansy had literally been listening to Draco drone on about Harry since he had come into their lives years ago, and...They both also knew that his time with her tonight was going to be limited.
He felt Harry move a few times, stop drawing and do something else with the hand that wasn't on Draco's neck, but he wasn't focusing on it, just letting himself sink further into his head, into a space that was safe and warm, where he really didn't have any other thoughts.
"You still want to come back to mine after?" Harry's voice was suddenly in his ear, and Draco was pulled out of the peaceful thoughts he was having, his stomach twisting darkly as he sucked his lower lip into his mouth and nodded in his head. "Good boy," Harry whispered, so low Draco almost missed it, but—he rarely missed those words from Harry.
Draco could only gurgle in response, twitching and trying not to jerk his hips upward even though he was throbbing and leaking as Harry gave him a slight reprieve to take in an adjusting breath, petting his hair.
Harry didn't say anything else, just kept holding Draco's smaller, more delicate hands in his bigger ones, rubbing them together, keeping them warm, kneeling in front of him and making a soft humming noise at the back of his throat.
Above the laughter and cheering of his ex-classmates, Draco spied Harry some ways in front of him, circling the air and looking for the Snitch. He smirked, determined to beat Harry to the snitch just once. Draco flew higher into the air, hoping to have a bird's eye view of the whole field. He ignored the protest of his bladder.
Harry spent the rest of the evening texting Draco, after they both agreed that it would be better to communicate through text message. Harry pumped his fist into the air and shouted "YES!" once he got hold of Draco's number. He knew he was behaving like a lovesick teenager, but then again, nobody was around to see him.
Harry remembered meeting the security guard - a big, hulking man - at the lobby, and knew what Draco meant. After showing Draco's address to the man, Goyle made him answer a lot of questions before he finally gave a grunt and told Harry to go ahead.
he wondered. Because Draco Malfoy was right in front of him, sunlight catching on his hair like a halo, mercurial grey eyes shining with mirth, as if he knew what Harry was thinking.
When they got to their hotel room, Harry didn't hesitate to show Draco how much he loved him all over again.
The most intense thing about Harry, Draco thought, was his eyes. It was such a bright shade of green, just like grass in the summer, and it felt like Harry was able to gaze into the depths of his soul. Draco sighed dreamily.
? With his alcohol addled mind, he couldn't remember how much exactly he'd had to drink, but it was probably a lot if it meant he was out here, drunk and dancing shamelessly and grinding his arse against the man behind him.
Draco took a deep breath, and waved his wand to cast a silencing spell. He felt so dirty doing this, but just as he was having second thoughts about relieving himself on the floor, his pee gushed out of its own accord. Draco blushed as he saw the dampening of his trousers and pee trailing down his legs and into his shoes. The white tiles were also not spared, and there was a huge puddle of pee on the floor. The splashing sound of pee hitting the floor was liberating.
"Since when did you care about them?" Pansy raised an eyebrow, following his gaze until she saw Potter. "
"Fuck you, Potter!" Malfoy spat out. Harry's smirk widened. He would put his Transfiguration skills to good use and turn Malfoy into a slug again. That way, he wouldn't be able to bother him anymore.
"Watch out, Draco!" That was Harry's voice. Draco looked around just in time to dodge a stray Bludger, groaning at the sensation his bladder made.
"This is only open to subscribers in London, and you have to come to my place so that we can discuss and film our video. In order to take part, comment to say why you'd like to bake with me! I'll pick the best answer, and contact you again. Good luck, and thanks for watching!" Draco blew a kiss and ended the video.
"I'm fine, Potter," Draco managed a weak smile. Harry didn't need to know all the details, though Draco was blushing furiously at the fact that Harry remembered what happened that fateful day. "That man was so disgusting, though. He was playing with his
Concentrating hard, Harry spoke the incantation and watched in delight as Malfoy grew smaller and smaller - and finally all that was left was a pile of clothes on the ground.
Draco jerked up in surprise when he felt some pee leaking out. His eyes widened and he looked down. Sure enough, there was a small damp spot on his trousers. Draco blushed and averted his gaze.
"Congratulations to Green Eyed Monster! Please send me a message!" Draco said, smiling as the comment in question was shown in the video.
Draco shook his head, shuffling along in the sand and holding onto Harry for support, trying to focus on the sand in between his toes and Harry's presence beside him, anything except the fact that his baby kept kicking him and he
Harry Potter knew he didn't always have the best of luck. His parents died in a car accident when he was just a baby, leaving him in the care of abusive relatives until he ran away from home at the age of sixteen. To top it off, he pretty much had a non-existent love life, and a small part of him longed to meet someone keen on a serious relationship, no matter how far-fetched the idea seemed.
Harry had to hide a smile when the fairy pulled his hair in retaliation and flew off to a corner to sulk.
"Let's go," Harry said, although he would rather stay there and kiss Draco for a longer time. The two Seekers flew back to where their classmates were waiting for them.
"Harry!!" Draco squealed, unable to help himself as he felt a ticklish sensation on his foot. Whatever Harry was doing, he was using some sort of feather to stroke his arches and in between his toes. It was unlike anything Draco experienced before. In the past, his ex-boyfriend used to tickle him lightly, and he wasn't restrained or anything, but this time round he was totally helpless. Draco tried to kick out at Harry or the feathers. Whatever it was, he needed the tickling to stop.
“What are you thinking about?” Harry asks eventually, his fingers tracing a meaningless pattern on Draco’s chest.
"Yeah, I'm fine" Draco replied breathlessly. He looked at Harry then, seeing his raven hair tousled from the wind and his eyes gleaming brightly behind his glasses. He looked so earnest that it was difficult to stay angry at him for long. "Thanks Potter," Draco added as an afterthought.
He attempted to send a private message to Draco, but his hands were still too shaky and the phone slipped from his grip again.
"Don't think I don't know what you're doing, Draco," Harry said, trailing his hands all over the round globes, soothing the reddened flesh. To his amazement, there was a bruise starting to form at the area where he slapped Draco. "Prancing about like that in your videos, bending down and giving everyone a view of your arse? You're just a naughty boy asking for trouble."
, Draco throught, trying not to salivate when Harry paused to roll his sleeves up so he'd be able to get at his food better. He could see the play of muscles beneath Harry's jumper and he had to suck in a breath.
Fed up, Draco decided to leave the party after Merlin knows how many drinks. He hated being ignored, especially by his best friend and his crush. As he was about to sneak off to the Floo, he heard Seamus' booming voice announcing "Quidditch, anyone?" This was followed by unanimous agreement from the group and everyone started forming their teams. Pansy sidled up to Draco then, her lipstick slightly smudged. Terry Boot followed her.
Harry growled and grabbed Draco's hips, making sure to hit that sensitive bundle of nerves as much as possible. He looked down, enthralled at the sight of his erection disappearing into the tight heat, admiring the sight of his boyfriend's reddened hole clenching around him, as if refusing to let him go.
Contrary to what Harry feared, things were less awkward between them after all that happened. Draco was content to sit right next to Harry, leaning into him with his legs draped over Harry's. Harry, in turn, sifted his fingers through Draco's hair, and was delighted to discover the strands were as silky as he imagined. It was surprisingly easy for Harry to talk to Draco, and they spent the rest of the day telling each other more about themselves and discussing the video.
"Whatever, Malfoy. Nobody asked you to start a fight. Let's leave you like that for a while. See how you like it," Harry poked Malfoy in the chest.
Draco woke up from his nap, feeling sated. It was rare to have this kind of opportunity to get a lie-in, what with having an energetic 3 year old around him at all times. It didn't help that his husband, Harry, had been off catching Dark wizards for the past week. Draco had finally gotten a well-deserved afternoon nap after feeding his son and tucking him into bed.
," he said in between bites as Hermione went to offer Ron some cookies. Ron too, bit into his cookie and instantly reached for 5 more. "When did you learn to bake so well?"
Draco nodded and shot Harry a smile, then chanced a look down. His stomach was protruding out slightly, probably from too much liquid intake. Harry didn't notice his companion's slight discomfort and continued on about Teddy.
He couldn't see much due to the lighting, but he was pretty sure there would be a dark stain on his jeans right now.
"Fuck," he sobbed out, pressing the heel of his hand harder into his crotch and not daring to breathe.
"Er, no. I'm just curious, is all," Harry smiled sheepishly. "Can you.. can you let me know if you see him again?"
They launched into conversation easily, and Draco didn't notice someone else walking out of the lift while he and Flora were talking animatedly about Quidditch.
"F..fuck you, Potter" Draco retorted, one hand clutching at Harry's shoulder, the other reaching up to pull harshly at Harry's inky black hair.
"Oh, I'm so sorry Harry," Draco looked genuinely upset. His hand stilled midair, and Harry took it in his hand, rubbing soothing circles all around. He felt bad for upsetting his angel.
Hermione and Ron looked at each other and smiled, then Hermione took her phone out to start finding that particular channel.
"Jamie! How have you been? Have you missed Daddy?" Harry carried his son and ruffled his messy black hair.
Draco Malfoy stepped into one of the Ministry lifts, a tray of potions vials trailing in front of him. He gave an involuntary shiver. He did not like being in the Ministry for prolonged periods of time. It was too bad that next to St Mungo's, one of his biggest clients was the Department of Mysteries. He had spent the past few weeks brewing potions they specifically ordered, and being self-employed, he had no choice but to deliver the orders himself.
"Just like what I said. You're a perv-" Draco's indignant voice was cut off when Harry kissed him again and grabbed him by the waist, hauling him up onto the kitchen counter.
Harry thought in glee. At this point in time, he didn't care if McGonagall found him and took a hundred points from Gryffindor. All that mattered was Malfoy getting what he deserved.
Draco's collaboration with Harry turned out to be a success. Their natural chemistry shone through in the video, gaining Draco many new fans and subscribers.
"Come in, I'll get you something to drink," Draco led Harry into a neatly furnished apartment. Harry's eyes slid easily from Draco's face to the glorious sight of his bubble butt walking in the direction of the open kitchen, and his breathing quickened.
"I'm going to get Snape!" Malfoy said angrily, and Harry started laughing because his voice was pitched higher than before. "It's not
"So needy," Harry growled into Draco's ear. He pushed Draco's apron aside and began licking at one nipple, dragging his nails up and down Draco's inner thighs. "You're so good for me, Draco, so desperate and hungry for my cock...I'll fuck you so hard you won't remember your name by the time I'm done with you."
There was no noise from the cubicle and Draco silently cursed. Was this person playing with one of their horrendous Muggle contraptions inside? He certainly saw a lot of such people around the restaurant. Even children were using them. Harry had referred to their little contraptions as
"Mmmmm, tastes good," Draco casually remarked and looked into the camera with half lidded eyes. Then he placed his index finger in his mouth again and sucked hard, releasing the finger with a pop, making sure to look directly into the camera as he did so.
Draco just smirked at Harry and waved a hand towards the sofa. "Go on then, make yourself comfortable. I'll be just a minute."
"You were in such a deep sleep when I got home, and I couldn't bear to wake you up. I thought we'd have some fun together," he replied.
Draco was back at the Ministry again. He heaved a sigh of relief when the lift safely brought him to Level 9 without any accidents. He had been so mortified over the incident with Potter that he had to gather up all his courage to make the trip down to the Ministry, and he was seriously considering hiring an assistant to help with some of the brewing and deliveries.
Draco didn't know how far they had walked. They'd taken short breaks along the way, but they must've walked quite a distance as there were less people along the beach now. To make things worse, his baby kept moving inside him, putting pressure on his bladder.
"Nothing, Pans," Draco hoped fervently that nobody else had noticed what exactly had happened except Harry. "Except that, he... well he kissed me. And I'm really hoping to get to know him better."
Meanwhile, Harry was most definitely not able to concentrate on his meeting. He didn't know what was happening to him.
"...You caught me right there," Draco laughed, and Harry leaned in to kiss him. "But really, I don't mind taking things further if you don't end up being a creep. I didn't expect you to be so hot, although your hair reminds me of a rat's nest." His hands tugged at Harry's black curls.
Harry grabbed his angel closer and deepened the kiss. Even though Draco was full of sharp angles, his skin - and lips - were surprisingly soft. When the blond opened his mouth slightly, Harry took this opportunity to let his tongue in. Draco tasted like Earl Grey, but Harry couldn't think of anything that tasted sweeter. He could feel his arousal grow as their tongues performed a slow dance, languidly exploring each other's mouths.
Unconsciously, Harry spat onto his own fingers and trailed a hand down to his straining erection. He kicked off his boxers, not caring where they landed, and wrapped a hand around his cock, giving it a few quick strokes and squeezing around the head. He closed his eyes and imagined it was Draco sucking him off, pink lips wrapped around his cock. Draco would want to start slow, but Harry would have none of it. He would fuck into that pretty mouth, grabbing onto soft blond hair and choking Draco on his cock. He would ruin Draco for anyone else.
Draco pressed his hand harder into his crotch and looked up. They were not even halfway to the restroom. He whimpered again, stifling a sob. He felt like crying so badly, and right now it seemed his baby was showing no mercy to his already weak bladder. Harry brushed his hair away from his face, and suddenly, he picked Draco up bridal style and made to carry him the rest of the way.
He had to admit he was too busy jerking off while watching Draco bake that he couldn't attempt to do any baking himself. When Hermione texted him to ask how his baking was going, he could only manage a weak "thanks Mione, tried out a few recipes but I'm still getting the hang of it" because there was
Harry gripped Draco's thighs and prised them wider, plunging in and out faster. "Oh yeah. Scream harder, love. Let the neighbours hear you," he teased as Draco cried out on every thrust. "Let them know what a slut you are for my big, fat cock..."
"Oh, don't be a wet blanket, Draco. Why don't you join the game, loosen up a bit?" Pansy suggested. Draco was about to reply with a scathing insult, when Terry stepped up.
"Are you sure? Do you want to fly around Hogwarts yourself? Maybe become owl fodder?" Harry asked him sweetly.
In the middle of their conversation, Draco suddenly felt the urge to pee. He didn't dare to interrupt Harry, who was telling him all about his godson Teddy Lupin. Draco had never met the boy before, nor had he met anyone from his side of the family. And since Teddy was technically Draco's cousin, he wanted to find out more.
The feathers were at Draco's feet for what felt like hours, even though it could only have been minutes. Just when Draco thought it would never stop, the feathers started to travel upwards, towards his calves, in between his knees, towards his thigh and cock. He screamed with laughter as some feathers travelled up and down the length of his erection, coaxing pre come out of the tip. Draco felt frustrated at his helplessness, but he also couldn't help feeling a bit aroused. He kept thrashing around on the bed, even as more feathers assaulted his balls and hole. He was sweating already, tears were leaking out of his eyes and he was pretty sure he was drooling too.
Harry gently stilled Draco's hips and turned him around. "I'm really sorry, love. I still have a lot to do before the meeting. When I get back, I promise I'll give you the fucking of your life." He kissed Draco long and hard, and when the blond moaned and rubbed against him, he knew he had to pull away.
"Malfoy, you better learn to keep your mouth shut if you know what's good for you." Harry brought Malfoy up to his dorm room and closed the door. He finally let go of the fairy, who flew around the room, examining his surroundings.
"Stop it," he protested, clutching his side. It was ticklish and made him want to pee even more. But Harry didn't need to know that.
Sure, he still wasn't very popular with the wizarding public, what with his Death Eater past, but Draco didn't give a flying fuck. He had his Harry, after all, and he loved it when Harry got all noble and defended his virtue.
"You're welcome," Harry gave Draco the most brilliant smile, and Draco melted inside. Harry seemed to be shining more than usual. Was it the reflection of his glasses? Oh wait.. Draco blinked a few times but the gold reflecting in the setting sun didn't disappear. The Snitch!
Draco groaned when he realised how much water he'd had to drink. He dropped the bucket of shells and held on to his stomach, trying to will the little one to stop kicking.
"Enjoy your food, Potter," Draco said flippantly without looking back, but before he went out he secretly pointed his wand at Harry and murmured a spell he had come across in the Malfoy Manor library years ago. Oh, Harry would live to regret this.
By this time, the feathers had travelled to Draco's armpits. Harry knew this was his husband's most sensitive spot (courtesy of Draco's ex boyfriend), and Draco was howling with laughter and moaning with arousal, trying to escape from the tickling but also trying to push himself deeper onto Harry's cock. Harry's fingers joined in the fun, digging into the hollows of Draco's smooth armpits. He could feel Draco start to sweat even more, and Harry dug in eagerly, alternatively wiggling into the hollows and tormenting Draco with light strokes.
But to Harry, Draco was not "just another bloke". He was Harry's angel, and he would also become Harry's undoing.
Draco nodded, leaning down to kiss Harry again and absentmindedly trailing his hands along Harry's biceps. Harry smiled against the kiss, pulling Draco closer to him. At that slight shift, he could feel both their clothed erections pressed against each other.
Harry took "all these" to mean the entirely too tight fitting clothes and the arse swaying, but he wasn't one to complain.
"Lighten up Draco, it's just a friendly game," Harry poked at his side. Draco batted Harry's hand away and flew higher up.
look like after a round of sex and felt his erection jump with excitement. He quickly tried to will it down for now, hands coming down to rest on Draco's waist.
In response, Potter took out his wand discreetly and cast a cleaning charm on Draco's clothes and the floor.
"Your comment stood out from the rest," Draco looked up at Harry, a small smirk playing on his lips, and Harry felt the urge to kiss it away. "I just had to pick you. And I'm not disappointed."
Draco was starting to breathe harshly now, burying his face in his arms as Harry reached under him to fondle his balls, driving him on the brink to insanity. "H..Harry..." he sobbed. "Please... Need you..."
Speaking of which, the man behind him reached around to wrap his beefy arms around Draco's waist, indirectly squeezing his stomach, and Draco gave a shudder. Yes, he really needed to pee right now.
But there was still a lot of planning involved for the stakeout, and Harry was hoping that the Aurors would finally catch the elusive wizards that were cursing Muggles to lose their memories, then robbing their homes. And Harry knew if he and Draco had sex, his mind would absolutely not be in the mood for work after that.
"Here, sit up a bit," Harry pushed at Draco's wet arse until he hesitantly leaned forward, his trousers making a squelching sound. Harry grew even harder when he saw the mess Draco made up close. Draco's trousers were ruined, all stained with pee, and so was his broom. Harry quickly performed a cleaning charm and kissed the blond again. This time, Draco returned the kiss shyly.
"Not yet, just give us a few more minutes, sir. Maintenance is repairing it right now and it should be ready in no time."
As usual, Harry and Draco were too tired at night to do much. Draco kissed Harry, and told him to get an early rest so that he'd have more energy the next day. Harry almost forgot about what Draco made him go through.
"Shh.. it's okay, love," Harry peppered his face with kisses, and Draco felt the wave of a wandless cleaning charm aimed at him which vanished the uncomfortable wet feeling immediately.
Harry reached for another cookie and closed his eyes in bliss as the flavour of lemons and white chocolate exploded in his mouth. Whoever this guy was, he was an angel if it meant he could bake so well. Harry nearly fell off his chair when Hermione showed him the YouTube channel.
The feather at his hole went deeper and deeper, and it must be his fucking husband that made it breach his hole slightly. Draco shrieked. He did want something in his hole, but the feather tickled so badly! He wanted to claw his insides out but he couldn't even move his limbs except to strain uselessly against his bonds.
"Oh, Ronald," Hermione shook her bushy head fondly, leaning in to kiss her boyfriend. "You know how Harry is. Once he's obsessed-"
Draco just glowered up at him. Harry rewarded him with a long, slow kiss, then carried his husband to the bath. He had already filled the bath with water and set it under a warming charm, then poured Draco's favourite bath foam inside.
"Um, my friend told me about it. Her cookies were amazing so I asked her to give me the recipe, and she showed me your videos."
Harry Potter had come into his life unexpectedly. He'd decided to hold a contest to celebrate 100,000 subscribers, and he picked Harry. When he first lay eyes on Harry, he couldn't believe his luck. The man was taller and broader than him, with what seemed like a permanent five-o-clock shadow, and looked like he worked out regularly. He wore a T-shirt that clung to his muscles in all the right places and had such a nice tan, Draco wanted to peel off all his clothes to see how far it went.
It felt like a pair of lips on his body, except of course there were definitely no lips whatsoever. The lips started with light kisses on his nipples. Harry thought that it was his imagination, because all he felt was one soft kiss, then nothing for about 5 minutes, and then another kiss. Did he miss sex
"Oh?" Harry raised his eyebrows. "And what if I turned out to be a murderer or pervert, instead? You'd just invite any stranger to your place?" Now that he gave more thought to it, he couldn't believe his angel's trusting nature.
It turned out that Draco lived about half an hour's drive away from Harry, so it was very convenient. He googled the place and was pleasantly surprised to see a sleek, modern apartment in an upscale neighbourhood.
When Draco came to, Harry handed him a glass of water, which the blond gulped down eagerly. Harry smiled at him indulgently and refilled the glass without asking. Draco tried to speak and nothing came out at first except a croak. He hit Harry on the chest, and managed to say "Next time, just stick with the spanking, Potter!"
Suddenly, Draco thought of a plan. He smirked to himself and quickly turned around so that his arse was pressed against Harry's crotch. "Just one more time, before you leave?" He began rubbing his arse against Harry, smirk widening when he felt Harry harden.
spending time with you! I'm going to get someone to reverse this transformation!" Malfoy demanded and struggled in Harry's grip.
Harry looked up and saw Hermione holding a tray full of cookies. They smelled delicious. He thanked her and took one.
"Hi Harry," Draco stood at the door, giving Harry a wide smile. He held his hand out. "Draco Malfoy."
Harry sighed in happiness. This weekend was all about lazing around and spending time with his best mates. After graduating from university, he got himself a well-paying job, but it came with consequences. Such as not having much of a social life outside of work. Ron and Hermione were also in this predicament, but at least they got together during their time at school. They now lived together and had each other for support. Harry sometimes felt like the third wheel in their relationship, but Ron and Hermione assured him that he would never be intruding in their couple time.
"Don't worry, angel. Just wanna ogle your arse from behind," Harry smirked and helped him down from the counter. Draco's legs were too wobbly and he almost fell, but Harry caught him. "Hands on the counter."
Draco could feel himself reaching the edge, so he snuck a hand down to his erection, hoping to speed up the process. Gods, he needed to come
"If you weren't going so fast, maybe you would've seen me!" Malfoy retorted, rubbing his arse. "It hurts, you big oaf!"
Harry was surprised to find that he was hard, but even though he felt like a pervert, he couldn't look away from the sight. He watched as Draco's trousers grew wetter and wetter, his pee dripping steadily onto the ground, not unlike rain. After a few seconds, the blond must have realised what was happening to him. He looked down, blushing and covering his crotch, and looked mortified when he made eye contact with Harry.
Sure enough, when Draco's hand closed around the Snitch, the pressure in his bladder finally let up. Harry watched from below, fascinated, as he saw a wet patch growing from the seat of Draco's trousers. The patch slowly became bigger, staining the wood of the broom and dripping down the legs of his trousers. Draco was peeing his pants again!
"No, Malfoy. Look, I'm really sorry," Draco looked as Potter swallowed nervously. "Why not I bring you back to mine, get you cleaned up proper and make it up to you?"
"Nobody'll miss you," Harry replied instantly, but at the murderous look on Malfoy's face, he quickly added, "Look, if you don't turn back after an hour, I'll go find Dumbledore."
"It's so hot," he couldn't help whining, wiping his face with a towel and holding out the bottle to Harry, who took it gratefully and drank it as well.
They laughed happily, glad that their best friend finally found someone to love him back. And if any of them noticed Harry's heated glances or Draco's slight limp, they were kind enough not to say anything.
"Don't distract me, Potter. I'm trying to find the Snitch," Draco rolled his eyes, making a show of turning his broom 360 degrees to try and catch a glimpse of gold.
The only thing that was annoying him, Draco thought, was that he had no chance to go to the bathroom before the game started. Everyone was too caught up in the moment and Terry Boot had all but dragged him around to go find other people to play for their team. After so many glasses of firewhisky, wine, and whatever alcohol he could get his hands on, Draco was feeling quite full, and though the game proved to be fun, the Snitch was elusive.
"He recently started this channel. It's called Draco's Baking Delights," Hermione informed him helpfully. "At first, it might seem he's doing all these for likes and subscribers, but he does have some good recipes."
"Guess I'm too late," a familiar voice sounded behind Draco. Draco turned around and almost lost his balance when he came face to face with Harry.
"Me too. I can't wait for us to be a little family," Draco whispered as Harry leaned down to kiss his bump, and their baby gave an answering kick.
The sexual tension between himself and Harry had been around ever since they first met. Draco wouldn't admit it to anyone, but he had wanked himself raw over the black haired man the past few weeks, sometimes with his fingers inside of him, imagining it was Harry's cock fucking into him instead.
Harry paused mid-wank and focused back onto his phone screen, just in time to see Draco turning around and placing the cake in the oven, bending at the waist and showing off his arse for all and sundry.
"Come on," Harry said, cutting off Draco's thoughts and attempting to unbutton the blond's shirt and trousers. Draco complied, helping him with the buttons, and soon it joined the pile of clothes on the floor.
Draco flew after the elusive golden ball as quickly as he could. The Snitch was hovering near a thicket of trees towards the other side of the field. Ignoring Potter and his protesting bladder, Draco aimed his Firebolt down and zoomed towards the trees. He heard a rush of wind, but he wasn't sure if it was Harry or his own imagination. All this time, Draco's bladder was screaming for release, and he was sure he had leaked a bit in his underwear, but he ignored it.
"Ow!" Harry felt the pain shoot through his body and made to get up, at the same time the other person said "Watch where you're going, Scarhead!"
"Nothing, come on, let's go," Harry led Draco out by the elbow. Draco's skin tingled at Harry's touch, and he was already thinking about the next time he could meet Harry.
Draco was about the leave the toilet when the door opened and Harry stepped in. He looked relieved once he saw Draco.
Draco's eyes blinked open and he raised an eyebrow. "For a pervert, you seem to be quite the gentleman," he laughed and leaned down to place a chaste kiss on Harry's lips. "The answer is yes, I've been single long enough to- mmmph" Draco was cut off as Harry kissed him again.
"You'll pay for this, Malfoy," Harry smirked down at Malfoy who was panting and wriggling hard, trying to free himself from Harry's grip.
"Well go find Parkinson to give you a massage. I don't have time for your shit," Harry made to pick his books up, only to find himself shoved to the ground again.
Harry managed to type out. He re-read it a number of times, before deeming it decent enough to hit the send button.
"Level 9," Draco muttered, avoiding those famous green eyes. He looked down at his shoes, and vaguely saw Potter pressing the button. The rest of the journey was spent in awkward silence, and when the lift reached the Department of Mysteries, Draco quickly walked out.
Sorry for the wait guys, I wasn't satisfied with the initial draft for this chapter but it should be good to go now. Enjoy!
. It was pure torture, but still, his pride prevented him from breaking down and peeing behind a coconut tree. Thankfully, Harry didn't say anything else, if not Draco might have punched Harry if he tried to say any more encouraging words. Damn those pregnancy hormones.
Draco stopped the kiss to pull Harry's glasses from his face. "They're digging into my skin," he complained and Harry laughed. The dark haired man started to pull off his T-shirt too, and soon both items had landed somewhere on the floor.
Harry quickly flew up, enveloping Draco in a hug. Draco's lips were wobbling, he was trying to stop himself from crying. Harry acted on instinct and planted a kiss on his lips, stroking his hair in what he hoped was a reassuring manner and not caring that his classmates might see them.
Before Draco knew it, Harry had maneuvered him so that he was lying on his back. The brunet was gazing down at him with so much love and adoration, and any retorts Draco thought of were quickly silenced.
If Draco hadn't been so distracted, he would have noticed the lift changing directions. It went sideways and instead of going down to the Department of Mysteries, it went up.
Harry smirked to himself. He wondered if Draco needed to pee. He remembered seeing the blond drinking a lot before the game started. He felt bad for not talking to Draco just now, but every time he tried to make his way towards him, he somehow got stopped by excited ex-classmates who wanted to catch up. He knew it was a perverted thought, but right now all he wanted was to see Draco pee his pants again, the Snitch be damned.
, you arsehole" Draco huffed, rolling his eyes and giving Potter's firm chest a shove. "Well? Aren't you going to laugh at me? Sell my story to the
After meeting Harry a few more times to rehearse their video, Harry had asked Draco to be his boyfriend, while feeding him a spoonful of treacle tart which they had baked together. How could he refuse?
Harry didn't realise he was following so closely behind Draco, longing to get his hands on that arse, when Draco suddenly turned around.
Draco did as he was told. He glanced back to see his boyfriend looking at his arse with a lustful gaze in his green eyes.
Harry rushed through the hallway, almost tripping on his robes. He was late to his first class of the day - Transfiguration. He cursed under his breath, remembering how Ron tried to wake him up but he was too tired from the previous day's gruelling Quidditch practice. He hadn't even had breakfast.
"Malfoy? Are you there?" Harry said mockingly, turning over layers of clothes to look for that infuriating bastard-turned-slug. "Malfoy?"
"Oh alright Potter, if you so insist," Draco gave a put-upon sigh, trying to feign disinterest but he could feel his heart pounding loudly. Flora gave him a wink as he walked off with Harry, and he rolled his eyes at her.
"Well, I can't say I'm surprised. You were always obsessed with Potter. But he had better treat you right or I'll hex him into next week." Pansy threatened.
Harry was gobsmacked. He reached out to shake Draco's slim hand, and couldn't help but admire how soft his hands were. His thumb unconsciously stroked the back of Draco's hand, and his angel gave a small chuckle.
He grimaced when pulled apart his robes and saw a wet spot staining the front of his trousers. Muttering a cleaning charm, Harry went into the toilet to wash his hands and splash some water on his face. He looked at his reflection and sighed. His hair was even more of a mess than usual and his glasses were askew. Harry waited for ten more minutes to ensure the curse wouldn't start again before he went back to his meeting.
"It's alright, we'll learn together," Draco fluttered long, blond eyelashes at him and Harry's heart melted. He ran a hand through his hair, partly out of habit and partly to distract himself from reaching out to touch Draco.
Since then, they'd been on several dates, where Harry had thoroughly pampered Draco and made him feel so loved, he felt like the luckiest man on the planet. All those times, he had been the perfect gentleman and they'd done nothing but kiss and hold each other, but Draco saw the way Harry stared at him sometimes and wondered when Harry would finally crack.
"You'd better hurry. I have an order to deliver," Draco said, ignoring the protest from his bladder.
The man took in Draco's crouching position and crotch holding to mean he was free to grope Draco's crotch as well. As the man's strong hand slid down his body and gave a squeeze, Draco's bladder cried out in protest one last time and let go.
All of a sudden, the lift jerked and started moving again. Draco almost sighed in relief, glancing to make sure his potions vials were all right. It wouldn't be long before he could drop off this tray with the receiptionist and quickly hightail it to the nearest loo.
But Harry did not stop. "Accio feathers," he heard Harry summoning more feathers, goodness knows how many of them, and the tickling commenced on his other foot.
It was then that Harry's green eyes darkened with lust and something else Draco couldn't place his finger on. It almost looked...
Harry had taken to collecting beautiful seashells along the shore. Draco indulged him. He knew of Harry's past with the Dursleys, and to see his husband enjoying the simple pleasures of life made Draco happy too.
Harry gazed lustfully at him, and slowly began tracing the contours of Draco's upper body over his clothes, leaving the blond hard, breathless and panting for more. Then, his hands boldly slipped under Draco's shirt, repeating the slow exploration all over again, greedily trying to touch as much skin as possible. When Harry reached Draco's nipples, rubbing and tweaking at the pale pink nubs, his angel began to moan softly.
Draco sniffed again, wiping his tears on his sleeve. "You'd better make good on your promise, Potter."
"After seeing you that day-" Harry began, but as he watched the colour drain from Draco's face, he realised it was the wrong thing to say. "No, I didn't mean anything by that. Look, I just wanted to return your wand, that's all" Harry pressed a box into Draco's hand.
Harry forgot all about Draco's nifty spell after that. He went to play with James in the living room while Draco inwardly heaved a sigh of relief and sneakily retreated back to his potions lab to check on the latest batch of Dreamless Sleep he was brewing.
"I... Thanks, Potter," Draco ran his fingers over his first wand. "My parents moved to France; we had to sell the Manor to repay the Ministry for our part in the war."
Scrolling back, he rewatched the parts he missed. And he was glad he actually bothered to watch the end of the video.
"I didn't know you were so urgent," Potter whispered in his ear, kissing his cheek tenderly. Secretly, he found it hot watching his arch nemesis lose control of his bladder and having a full-blown accident in public.
At first, Draco was hesitant to go, but all it took was an owl from Harry asking if he'd like to join. Draco didn't dare admit it, but he missed Harry badly. The raven haired man had been busy with field work and thus, Draco had not seen him on his weekly trips to the Ministry.
"Wait!" Harry reached out and made as if he wanted to touch Draco but wasn't sure if the gesture was welcome. Draco raised an eyebrow.
. He let out a whimper when Harry grabbed his hand and held it against the counter, his right hand giving Draco another firm slap on the arse.
"Yep. Everything's ready and I've started recording," Harry replied. "But before that, I want to do something."
The Snitch changed course at the last minute, flying straight up towards the sky. Luckily, Draco was alert and he wasted no time in flying upwards, his hand reaching out to catch the Snitch. When Draco felt the flutter of wings against his hand, he pumped his fist in the air triumphantly.
. Harry's heart beat faster at that. Out of 100,000 subscribers, how many actually lived in London? Did he really stand a chance? Taking a deep breath, he typed in his comment.
To be fair, his videos attracted a lot of lewd comments, and he was grossed out by some of them. But he knew that sex sells, and he
"Love you too," the sated blond replied, slumping bonelessly to the floor. Harry followed, pulling out of him once they were spooned in a comfortable position on the hard floor. When he glanced down to see the come dripping out of Draco's hole, he swiftly inserted a finger inside, massaging his come inside and making sure that nothing else leaked out.
Malfoy was about the length of his wand, with silvery dragonfly wings and a faint glow around him. He was dressed in a short tunic made entirely out of shimmering material. Harry thought he looked rather cute.
In response, Harry turned Draco's face gently and gazed into his grey eyes, shining with tears. "You're none of these things," he said firmly, pressing a kiss to Draco's lips. "You're so beautiful and strong, and now you're carrying my child, Draco. You're all I ever wanted and I love you so much."
Pansy was gaping at them both, for once unable to think of something to say. Draco snatched his hand away from Harry, blushing. Terry smiled.
"So, as we were saying..." Head Auror Robards gave him a funny look and continued on with whatever he was talking about. Which Harry had
"Fuck," Harry muttered. "Get a hold of yourself, Harry. Relax. It's just another bloke," he tried to convince himself.
He looked to be around Harry's age, and had artfully styled platinum blond hair and a pale complexion, accentuated by high cheekbones. He was a bit pointy, but in a good way which brought out his aristocratic features. To top it off, he spoke in the poshest accent Harry had ever heard. He was the complete opposite of Harry, who had a healthy golden tan from exercising in the sun and messy black hair that could never be styled no matter how he tried. When the man turned around to get some ingredients, Harry's eyes stayed glued to his body and most importantly, his delectable bubble butt. Harry's breath hitched.
"Feeling good, love?" Harry mocked as his fingers trailed lightly along Draco's neck and sensitive nipples. His husband looked so good like that, pale skin flushed and glistening with sweat. The blindfold was wet with Draco's tears, Harry couldn't help it but adjusted the bonds on his feet so that Draco's feet were pulled up towards the top of the bed posts instead. The sight of Draco's winking hole undid Harry. With a wandless lubrication spell, Harry slid a vibrating dildo inside his lover.
They were only interrupted when the waiter brought their food and drinks. The food Harry ordered for Draco was good, and the hot chocolate that accompanied it was amazing. Draco loved it so much, Harry ordered another large mug for him, but not before shooting him an indulgent smile.
Oops. Harry forgot that nobody outside of him and his friends knew about their little adventure in second year.
Surprisingly, Draco enjoyed himself, even in the presence of Muggles. He found out (probably a little too late) that Muggle clothes enhanced his lithe body and toned arse, and he was free to be himself here since nobody knew who he was and what the Dark Mark on his arm meant. He'd gotten himself piss drunk at the bar with Pansy, and was now writhing among the mass of bodies on the dance floor, hoping to get laid for the night.
Harry collapsed on top of Draco after that, but Draco did not move at all. Harry quickly undid the blindfold to see that his husband had passed out cold. Harry smiled to himself, taking a moment to brush away the hair covering Draco's forehead. He kissed Draco's swollen lips and cast a cleaning charm to clean the blond up.
attractive, so it counted for something that differentiated him among most YouTube channels about baking.
"Oh!" the blond squeaked when he saw how near Harry was, then gave an embarrassing laugh. "You okay with tea?"
"Then do it," Draco smirked, holding his legs up and giving the brunet a view of his pink hole, delighting in the sharp intake of breath that came from his boyfriend.
"No, I can't imagine what it's like to not know your parents. I get annoyed at my father sometimes, but at least he's alive, you know?" Draco said. "Mother's the one who taught me baking. She spoils me, but Father is stricter. He wants me to take over the family business someday, although I'm not too keen on it," he shrugged.
"For someone so angelic looking, you have quite the mouth on you," Harry remarked, moving his finger in and out of Draco's hole and enjoying the feel of Draco's tight heat squeezing around his finger. When the blond was moaning and begging for more, Harry added a second finger, scissoring in and out slowly.
"No thanks, I'll join Boot's team." Draco said huffily. He was still annoyed at Harry for ignoring him and only coming over when he needed him. "Aren't you playing Seeker too, Potter? It must've escaped your miniscule brain, but one team can't have two Seekers."
He also remembered Harry telling him that he was pretty, even then, even before Draco had needed to verbalize what he wanted.
The door opened, and then Harry was actually standing there, in grey sweatpants and a baggy blue shirt, glasses on rather than his contacts which probably meant he was watching TV, and his hair was all messy and shoved all out at weird angles.
His head turned to the side, and his stomach plummeted when he was greeted with an empty bed, very similar to how his morning had gone the other time he had woken up after a night with Draco, except it had been in Draco's bed last time.
He dipped his head in a nod, and then a second one, because they'd talked about this before, quite in depth, enough for the basics, the limits and desires that they both had when it came to non-sexual dominance, and Draco already trusted Harry to catch him if he sunk too deep or floated too far.
hearing Harry refer to himself as that, it made his entire brain just short circuit for one blissful second.
in Harry's face, and Harry was smiling at him and...Draco had been embarrassed about twenty seconds after this photo and pulled away from Harry, because he was still sweaty from playing and his breath probably smelt bad from the bowling alley nachos and he might have spat over Harry's face because he had been laughing
"Have a good night!" Harry called over his shoulder, ever so polite, and Draco couldn't help but snort under his breath, shaking his head.
