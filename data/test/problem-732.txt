“Bad habit I picked up in Paris. Everyone was smoking, even wizards, so I just started doing it as well. Can’t stop now, it's the only thing that calms me down.”
“So you really like giving up control?”
Draco got up and immediately went back under the blanket. “Did I wake you up?”
“Malfoy,” he said, remembering where they were. He lowered his wand, and Malfoy did the same. They both turned to look at the students, who were openly gaping at them, and started clapping as soon as they realised it was over. “Ehm, I think we got a bit carried away.” He awkwardly touched his beard, trying to find something to do with his hands.
Harry laughed at that. He figured Malfoy was right, seeing someone speaking to a snake is not really a common occurrence, not even in the wizarding world. “Fair.” They walked in silence for a few seconds, and then he couldn’t help himself and added: “I can’t do it anymore.”
"As long as it stays confidential.”
“What does it mean?” he asked, just to be sure.
“Didn't want to end so fast.” He smirked, happy to see that he still had the power to rile Malfoy up. He attacked, but Malfoy was too quick and he managed to step aside.
Malfoy literally chocked on his own spit, and Harry was forced to pat him on the back. “What the fuck,” he said, now rubbing his back.
Draco tensed a little at that, immediately sitting up straighter and trying to look more awake. “Hello, Weasley,” he said, in his usual posh voice that became more intense whenever he was trying to be polite and was really uncomfortable.
“I can’t leave you right now, sorry.”
“Like? Have you thought about this often?” And he was back again to being a little shit and flirting. Good, right headspace Harry. He let his free hand go from Draco's neck to his hip.
am adopting a cat. You are just dad’s boyfriend, until you are one hundred percent sure you want a pet, he is mine.” He took the kitten from his hand.
“Kids are like animals: they can smell your fear.” Draco stopped next to him in front of the door. “You don’t need to worry, they are already hanging from your lips.”
“What would make it better?” he asked, finally pulling his boxers down.
“I will, professor.”
“Professor, how are you feeling?” she asked, waving her wand over his body.
“Oh, I didn't know it was a competition.”
“Just take care of him.”
“Madame Pomfrey says he will be fine, she just wanted to be cautious.”
“Is it me?” he asked, not able to stand it anymore.
“You fucker,” he shouted, running behind him.
“I know what you mean. For three weeks I couldn’t sleep alone at Grimmauld place, Ron, Hermione and Ginny took turns to stay with me. There are just so many memories attached to that house. Sometimes I still get excited at the idea of seeing Sirius.”
They left with Theodore looking at them as if he was asking them to stay, and Harry had to drag Draco out of the room before he gave in.
“Don’t you dare.” He sat up and pinched his hip. “I’m going to get ready, I want to see you sitting up by the time I’m back.” He left a kiss on his shoulder, then he rolled out of bed. “Theodore, wake up your dad.” He picked up the cat from where he was sleeping on the couch, and positioned him on Draco’s head.
The rest of the evening went well, but Draco was not able to relax after their conversation, and Harry just wanted his friends to leave so that he could hold his boyfriend and kiss him to make him forget everything.
“You should go. He is passionate about what he does, and he explains things easily. He is patient and kind when they don’t get it right, and he listens.”
He deserved Harry’s elbow in his ribs, he really did. “C’mon, what are we?” he asked, hoping Draco would say what he was too scared to ask for. Draco had said he wanted to make it official after a couple of dates, but as he had pointed out, they were already spending so my much time together
“Still. I appreciate it. A lot. I can’t believe I got this lucky with you.”
“What for?” he asked, sounding way softer than usual.
“Oh, shut up, you stalked Malfoy for an entire year. I always wondered how long it was going to take you to realise you fancied him.”
“And I thought about talking at the Ministry next week. I will, if you still want me to.”
“Well we don’t have an explanation, not yet at least, but I can tell you more about what we found.”
“I’ll tell the elves to get your room ready. When can we expect you?”
“Hopefully.”
“And you are wrong. Everyone thinks we are good together. You know who made me realise you might have liked me? Ginny, my ex, and all of her family agreed. Hermione likes you, McGonagall basically told me you were pining after me. All of those people think you are good for me, and most importantly I think you are good for me.”
“I don’t deserve it.”
“Me not having fun won't stop Draco from coming here, if that’s what you are worried about.” He watched as she went to her seat and took a sip of water, clearly nervous.
“Wait for your introduction,” he said, and this time he was definitely smirking, the prick.
“It’s okay.” He started playing with his shirt, and he cursed loudly when he noticed the big hole in the middle of it. “Fucking hell, why do they keep this damn forest. And near the kids. I’ll never understand their logic.”
“We can come back tomorrow, then.”
“Just seeing his face makes me sick.”
Without realising it they were already standing in front of the gargoyle guarding the headmistress’ office. “Why is it that I'm still scared of standing here?” he mumbled, more to himself than to Malfoy.
“We can do that, yeah. Be very domestic and cute.”
He watched young Harry approach, he watched as the spirits of his loved one appeared and talked to him. Malfoy had gone very still next to him, except for his thumb that kept stroking his hand.
“Good night, sap.”
“When’s the wedding?” he asked, his voice raspy.
“Okay. That was Rowle, as you already suspected, it seems like he has been transformed into an inferius, but the transition must have been too soon after his death, because some part of his soul latched to the creature. That’s why he seemed to be vigilant and conscious. We don’t know yet who turned him, he is not that smart, but it seems like all the deaths were part of a long process to bring him back to life? Especially considering he killed a couple of unicorns.”
“I still feel like I’d be betraying her. I know it's stupid.”
“Of course,” he said, and his inner eleven-year-old started freaking out immediately. God, he hated that feeling.
“You look happy,” she said, and for the first time he couldn’t really read her expression.
“I’m taking you out more often,” he said after he had swallowed his first bite. He had manners, thank you very much.
“Do you want it too?” he asked, very careful not to put too much pressure on him. “Because it's fine if you don't, I mean I don’t know why you wouldn’t want to see me, but it’s fine.”
He arrived at the owlery and was only slightly mobbed by a couple of first years, nothing that a good smile couldn’t solve, then he was finally able to sit down to write Hermione a note that just said ‘I’ll explain Sunday, can you check these?’, before sending off the owl. It still hurt at times, seeing those beautiful birds and not seeing Hedwig next to them. He missed her so much. He had never thought he would have been able to create such a special bond with an animal, and yet Hedwig had been everything to him in those years. When everyone was against him, when not even Ron wanted to talk with him, he had her. His friends had tried to get him to buy another owl, but he just couldn’t bring himself to do it.
“It’s going to be a disaster,” he said dramatically.
“How did you find him?”
“So you still are an annoying git, thank Merlin, I was worried.”
He leaned down and kissed him, first on the lips and then on his forehead. “Good morning, love.”
Malfoy laughed against his neck, and Harry thought the death stare McGonagall was sending him was well worth it. Oh Merlin he had a crush. Less than two weeks with Malfoy and he was already whipped.
Just like that the owl took off, screeching happily and showing off, then he was out and in the sky.
When he arrived at the castle that evening, he wasn't surprised to see all the kids excited and waiting at front door, trying to take a look at him.
He knew he couldn’t get in trouble, and yet he felt his cheeks heat up at that question. “Well, you are not going to like this.” He took the Map from his pocket and opened it in the middle of their circle. “My father and his friends created it, Draco managed to alter it and extend it to the forest.”
“You are so annoying. C’mon, let’s go home.” He got up and brushed away dead leaves from his clothes, then he offered Draco his hand to help him to his feet.
“Good evening, Harry” McGonagall greeted him, nodding at the chair in front of her desk.
“That’s on you, it was pretty obvious.” He pinched his side and smiled when he flinched. “Should we go back inside? So you can tell me what you found out?”
“You called your owl Max?”
“What?” he asked, pretending not to care. He clearly didn’t want to get his hopes up, and the mere idea of Draco because sad because of him was just so incredibly heart-breaking.
“Already? It took you more than a year to take me,” she said, not at all bothered by it, just surprised.
“Just a bunch of kids obsessed with us, all good.”
“Theodore is nice,” Harry said, smiling to himself. Draco and his posh names. Who the fuck calls a cat Theodore?
“No, I actually don’t like bossy people in bed.”
“Alright. I guess taking you to the infirmary is out of question then,” he said casually, just to make sure.
“Draco, please."
“George, don’t scare our guest,” Molly said, smiling at her son.
“I missed you?”
“We won’t be long, unless you get stopped too much.”
“Harry,” he said again, now more desperate. The first thing he had discovered about Draco in bed was that he was loud, so incredibly loud that he had started putting up charms when they were at school. The second one was that his nipples were extremely sensitive, and once he had made him come just by licking his nipples and barely stroking his dick.
“Maybe if you went back now it would be different.”
“This is where I found the unicorn," Hagrid said after ten minutes, stopping in a clear spot between the trees.
is going around the forest.”
“You had a bad day, I get it.”
“I know. I’m just being stupid and dramatic.” He held him tighter, then decided to just go for it and moved to sit on his legs and wrap himself all over him.
“You know what I mean. He knows I hate him because of the war, but that man really creeps me out. Hopefully Draco will help. I think his mother will also be nice enough.”
They approached the door and someone immediately opened it for them. They thanked them man, Harry a bit lost and awkward and Draco clearly in his element.
“I'll wear it, since we are leaving your room.”
“The saviour is a sap, who would have thought,” Draco teased him, but at the same time he grabbed his hand and intertwined their fingers together.
“That’s not what I mean. I’m just worried that our personalities won't match in bed.” He got even closer to him to the kiss tip of his nose and he started caressing his neck with his knuckles. “I’m sorry I’m being so paranoid, I don’t know why I'm suddenly scared of having sex with someone.”
“I think it would be better to stay here in case of emergency.” It pained him to say so, but it was true. He was already planning to go exploring in the night, at different hours, to see if there was a difference in activity.
“Yeah, to save the failure that is my father, who's currently in his house drinking his weight in alcohol. I helped
“What did you say about wanting to keep me around?” He stopped his hand and held it in his, trying his best to ignore the weird position.
“As you said, he does have a brilliant mind. I was scared at first, not only because I didn’t know his intentions, but also of the reaction of some parents, but the kids just like him so much. Have you ever been to one of his lessons?”
Draco smiled at that and hid his face against his tummy once more.
“Okay, try to sound a bit less dead inside.”
“Okay, good.” He got up from his bed to sit next to him. “So, are we trading secrets? Wanna tell me who your first boyfriend was? Or do you currently have one?”
“Okay, we will help you if you let him go.” He was losing his patience, he knew it. Another pained noise from Draco and he was going to jump on them.
“It’s for the thing I’m doing at Hogwarts. I thought Malfoy could talk about some things with Hermione and since she is always so busy, I invited him. I hope it’s okay.”
“He's surprisingly good with them.”
“It's not like that, I-“ he stopped mid sentence and lowered his eyes.
“You can try," he said, as he made the stage disappear.
“Can we make it a tradition? A new one every year, maybe we can make some smaller so we don’t run out of space.”
“I think I want it. I like it,” he admitted, quietly, just for Harry to hear.
“We are.”
“You are ridiculous, your fucking eyes just lit up,” Draco said, shaking his head.
He sighed, relieved, and started walking toward Hagrid’s hut. Hagrid had visited them a couple times, and they had met up in Diagon Alley on several occasions, but he hadn’t visited him at home since before he had started his journey to find the Horcruxes. He stopped in front of the door and knocked on it a couple times.
“Fuck, why is this so hot.”
“By the way, I have your lists of names.” He reached for Hermione’s bag and took out a piece of paper. “Most of them are very old centaurs, but there was something weird. This one,” he pointed to a name and read it, “Thorfinn Rowle.”
“When would that be?”
“That's bullshit, you can’t compare yourself to someone else, we are all different. You can drown in one feet of water just like you can in ten feet.”
They separated right as the shop assistant came back with a carrier for the cat, bowls, brushes, food, a litter box and sand to put inside. “This should be it,” he said, looking very happy.
“I like how it sounds.”
“I know," he said, sounding way too pleased. Yeah, some things never changed. Malfoy opened the door for him, and they walked inside the hall. No one was talking anymore, they were just staring at him, mouths agape, some looked on the verge of tears.
“Good night, hope you get lost.”
“That’s amazing. I knew you could do it.” Without thinking too much about it – hello, Gryffindor? – he wrapped Malfoy in his arms and just hugged him.
“I think your dad liked red,” he said after a few seconds spent thinking about it.
Draco was still staring at him, apparently unable to form words.
“I know. I’m kinda overwhelmed at times by how much I love him, but it feels right.”
“Can we not?” he asked in a whisper. He looked pale again, and he couldn’t lift his head to meet Harry's eyes.
They spent the afternoon on the sofa, talking and reading and then talking again, Draco's legs over Harry’s for most of the time.
“You have no idea how hot you look,” he said, trying to catch his breath. He started moving the hand that was around his dick faster, and he smiled smugly when Draco threw his head back and almost shouted. “Sounds so good, love.” He leaned down to kiss his hip bone, then made a path all the way down to his ankle and then up again. Third thing about Draco in bed: he liked to be praised and adored, in every way. Words, gestures, he was even okay with smiles at times, he just needed to feel loved and like he was doing well.
The next couple of days went by very fast and smooth. Everyone was cooperating: the students were not leaving the castle and they were taking his lessons very seriously, Malfoy was working on the Map, the other teachers were doing researches, and he was starting to settle down. He still had his moments when he walked past some particular spots during his night walks, but other than that, everything was going well.
“Well yeah you can't really talk, can you?”
“No, absolutely not, the only thing that could have hurt Draco was an infection because of how many animals he had bitten. As for the rest, we managed to stop him before he could actually cause some damage to his organs.”
“Well, that’s a nice drawing?” he said.
“I’m gonna fire-call you every night before bed. And we can meet up on the weekend if I’m not on a mission.” He started caressing his head, loving the feeling of his long hair under his fingers. “And in the summer we can just leave for a couple of weeks and go around, visit new places, or even just stay at home all day and cuddle.”
“If you’d like that, then yes.”
“Why are you looking at me like this?” Draco smiled at him, slightly embarrassed.
“She picked the place?”
He cleared his throat, trying to get rid of the lump he was feeling. “The snake moves when you unlock the door.”
“I can. We are
“Not today, sorry.” Hagrid petted his dog on the head and locked him inside the house. That was a very bad sign.
“Right, you have a point.” He closed his eyes and reclined his head. He had never met the parents of anyone before. He had known the Weasleys for years before being introduced as Ginny's boyfriend, and it had all been so easy.
“That must have been fun.” He sounded almost chocked up, as if talking about Voldemort was still too much after six years.
“It’s fine, I really do understand you. The people I grew up with were horrible, I don’t really consider them as family, but yeah, I know what that’s like.”
“We don’t know for sure, it could just be his ghost.” He kissed his neck, trying to distract both Draco and himself. And here he was, worried that Draco would not get along with his friends, when clearly, they had bigger problems. He had not thought about that, at all. The only thing he had been worried about was what they were going to do once they were not living in the same place anymore, it hadn’t even crossed his mind that Draco might have found his job very scary.
“Hello, there.” Draco smiled at him as soon as the door opened. “How was your day?” he asked, taking his hand and pulling him inside. He sat back on the sofa and picked up a cup of tea, pointing to another one in offering
“Last time we saw him his dot was here,” Draco said, pointing almost in the middle of the forest, or well, the forest they knew. It went so much farther than that, but hopefully whatever they were looking for never went too far. “We noticed it because it kept going back and forth. There must be some sort of path there.”
“That's okay, this isn’t your job after all.” He tried to sound gentle and calm, he didn’t want to make him feel bad about it, or like he was judging him.
“I’m really happy, thank you. And I don’t mean for the presents. Just thank you for being you and loving me.”
“So?” Harry asked, looking at his best friend after coffee had been served.
When they arrived at the Great Hall, Harry excused himself, and under Draco's confused gaze he went to the Slytherin table. He immediately recognised the boys from that morning, and he smiled at them. “Can I sit with you for a moment?” he asked, pointing at the empty space in front of them. He could feel a lot of people staring at him, but he didn’t particularly care.
“No, sadly you have to look at the whole map.”
“Oh Merlin, I shouldn’t have let you plan our date.”
“Don’t think so hard, you’ll give yourself a migraine,” Malfoy mocked him.
type of couple.”
“How are we going to find this ghost or whatever it is?” McGonagall asked.
They finally found an alley that was secluded enough to give them a minute of peace, and still holding hands they apparated inside one of the capsule of the London eye. Thank Merlin he had actually bothered stopping by the other day, and bless Hermione and her detailed route of how to get from a restaurant to another.
“That’s kind of inevitable with your job. I know you are the best, but you are impulsive and you always need to protect others. I can’t lose you, Harry, I just can’t.” He hid his face against his neck, and fisted Harry's shirt in his hands.
“Dick.” He threw him a pillow, but missed entirely.
Harry looked up at him, and moved one hand to his left nipple, just pinching it and rubbing it between his fingers.
“Then I’ll organise the spontaneous dates.”
“But. It's what I want. I want to settle down, to have something stable. I wouldn’t start this if I wasn't one hundred percent sure that it can last.”
“I see,” was all he said. His cheeks looked quite red, and Harry never thought he would see the day he would make Malfoy blush.
“I've never seen anything like this.” If Hagrid was scared it meant it was really bad. He didn’t know of a single creature Hagrid didn’t like or find adorable.
“It was horrible,” he whispered, hiding his face against his neck.
“I’m glad you feel that way, though. If we want this to work, we have to trust each other.”
“Everything is normal.” She put her wand away and just stared at him for a moment. “The healers from the hospital are taking care of some last things, just as a precaution, but you should be able to go to your room tonight.”
“Was it supposed to sound like a threat?”
“Thank you.” He took a deep breath, and started moving around like the others were doing.
They left quickly, almost running because they wanted to reach Harry's room as soon as possible and just be able to kiss.
“I’d say co-worker,” he said after a couple of seconds spent pretending to be thinking about it.
“I guess. But only if it comes up, don’t think I’ll be running to you.”
“Can I stay?”
“Alright then,” he said, finally giving up.
“I really want to kiss you,” he said, and it pained him how much he meant it. Draco just overwhelmed him at times, and the only way to get over it was to kiss him and feel closer to him. Yeah, he was in too deep already.
Robards was fuming, his face was so red Harry thought he was going to explode. “Very well, I’ll send your work there. Don’t think you’ll have a paid vacation just like that.”
“He’s not his dad, he really is a good man now. Still so bloody posh and all, but a good person nonetheless.”
“She really does not. She's so proud of what you’ve done these past years, sometimes she just shows me articles about you like a proud grandmother. Although I think part of that is because she knew about my crush.”
“I wouldn't have asked for your help if I thought you were.” He stopped, close to the forest but still at a safe distance to see anything coming their way. “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good," he said while pointing his wand at the map. Red lines started forming, and in a couple of seconds the whole Hogwarts was in from of them.
“Doesn’t matter, let’s just start.” He quickly kissed Harry’s cheek, then walked around the table to sit in front of him. They were too far apart to be able to touch each other under the table, but at least Draco’s parents were even further away.
“You got a cat?” Ron looked shocked, as if that was the most absurd thing in the world. Maybe it was.
“I’m nervous.”
“I slept like shit, I had another nightmare.”
“What’s wrong with that? Draco changed a lot, for the better, he apologised as soon as he started working here.”
“That’s true.”
“Duty.” He smiled at her and took a sip of his tea.
“It's and inferius," he said, feeling his blood freeze suddenly. It didn’t make sense, it wasn’t possible. Why was he showing up in the Map? Who was controlling him? “Fire scares them," he said, noticing the confused expression on Tom and Mark’s faces. “But we need to get Draco back.”
“You ass looks lovely in those pants, but the stars are putting me off a little bit.”
What if Draco didn’t like the food? Or what if he hated the palace? Was he going to like just walking around London? And what if-
“I know, I never blamed you.”
“I know.” He sighed and picked at his food. “I was thinking ... I usually give a speech for the Christmas party at the Ministry, would you like to come with me? I want to bring this up, and who better to do it than a teacher?”
“I know.” He almost felt giddy with how happy he was. Never in a million years had he thought that he could like Draco, and yet there he was, kissing him. “I wanna take you out on a date. Something posh and pretentious.”
“Professor.” He sat down and took the cup she offered him. “Thank you.” For some reason, she always had tea ready. Didn’t matter the temperature or the time of the day, if you went to her office you were going to drink tea.
“You too,” one of the girls said, looking at her friend to try and figure out what was happening to her.
“Sorry, it’s just so funny. Can you let Draco use it? I want to see how long it takes him to give up and blame the phone.”
“You don’t know who it is, do you?” he asked, looking paler than usual.
“I don’t want you to save me once again,” he said, frustrated, taking another drag of his cigarette.
He went straight to Draco’s room, feeling rather nervous for some reason. He knocked, and waited patiently for Draco to let him in.
“Okay, let's go then.” Harry said, turning around to face the forest.
“It always makes me a bit sick. Not a good idea after dinner.”
“How come?”
“Yes, I’m fine.”
“I’m sorry, I’m a bit of a mess today.” He moved away and went back to what he was doing.
“I really do.” He leaned in to give him a quick peck.
“No, but I know you.” He sat up as well, bringing Theodore with him and holding him in his arms. “And I know how you show people you care.”
“I think Harry has more memories of the forest."
“I do, I trust you. I just don’t feel-“
“You are nothing if not self-aware.”
“I saw two girls holding a necklace and thought it would be perfect for my girlfriend.”
“Alright.”
“Care to share?”
The look Ron gave them when he opened the door was priceless, Harry almost thought about putting it in a pensive for when he was sad.
“Here are your menus, if you have any question don’t hesitate to ask.” He bowed slightly and left them alone to decide.
“Come here.” He gently put Theodore on the bed and he hugged Draco. “Did I freak you out?” he asked, resting his chin on his shoulder.
“That can’t be true. You are a good kitten, aren’t you?” He tried to pet him with his other hand and yeah, okay, the cat did bite him, but there was no venom behind it. It almost looked as if the cat was smiling at him, happy to have someone playing with.
“What is going on here?” McGonagall was looking at them as if they had grown a new head each, but even if Malfoy was struggling to get away from him, Harry didn’t let go.
“Sure. Maybe change.”
They eventually found a small one that gave them enough privacy and provided good coffee. It had a huge wood counter were some people were getting served, with pastries on display underneath. All the walls except the one behind the counter were windows, with a view on people walking by and going through their days.
They started following young Harry, and had it not been that he was so worried about Malfoy, he knew he would have lost his mind the second he had stepped foot inside that memory. “This is gonna take a while, I didn’t really know what path I was taking.”
“What?” Harry looked at him confused, still lost in his own thoughts.
“If I know where you are going with this, and I’m pretty sure I do, I beg you not to say anything.” His annoyed expression lasted only a couple of seconds, and he was forced to hide his grin by eating again.
“Image wise, maybe, but not for my personal needs. I wanted to settle down, to feel at peace for once in my life and get the family I always wanted and needed, Ginny wanted to explore, try new things, live at the fullest.”
“Yeah? Theodore it is, then.”
The night ended quickly, after coffee and tea they exchanged gifts – a necklace for Draco's mum and cigars for his father, a very rare book for Draco and some very expensive scarf and hat for Harry – and then they took their port key back to England.
Draco visibly relaxed at that, and it made him feel sick, the knowledge that Draco was scared for him, and that he was going to be until the day he left his job.
“Most of them aren’t even legal yet “
“Why didn’t you can the Ministry?” he asked, confused. He had not heard a single word about this at work.
He emerged right outside the forest. Everything was silent at the moment, the battle had been called off to give Harry the time to get to him, and yet he could feel it in the air, as if there was an echo of all the screams.
“Are you happy?”
“I’m not, I was just wondering if he wanted to test some products,” he said, faking innocence.
“I have to. It's my job.”
“It just tastes amazing, how do they even do this?”
“So. Who was in Slytherin that year, mmh.” He tried to think about the Slytherin boys, but none of them seemed like Malfoy's type, except Blaise maybe but he had already said it was nothing serious. “He was not in Slytherin, was he?”
“Everyone,” Ron answered, even though it wasn’t a question. “Just wait for your Christmas present, he goes over the top with those.”
“He does. You should see him with the kids, he’s so great with them." He thought about a couple hours before, how nice and understanding he had been with his students.
“It does” he said, disappointed “I can't even see us. But look, a couple of students are in the kitchens.”
“Told you. So, you still up for that dinner? Because I was thinking, what if you two come over to my house? I think it would make Draco feel less uncomfortable?”
“Well, I don’t remember much, but when he bit me, I felt like I was being drained?” Draco said, and immediately Harry’s hand tightened in his. It was good that Draco was starting to remember, but he almost wished he could just forget the whole experience.
“Do you want to come out at some point?” he asked, sounding worried, probably about Harry’s answer.
“Shit.” He moved his hips away, but it was too late. “Sorry.”
had its hand wrapped around Draco's neck. It was hard to see, but it looked very thin and all white and slimy, with those empty eyes he had seen from the grounds. And then it clicked.
“They don’t deserve this, no one does.”
“I can feel a question about the Map coming up.”
“I don’t think I’m supposed to tell you this, but it's not like he is going to hex me, is he?” Harry gave her a dubious expression, but she kept talking. “You came up a lot in our conversations. He often said how much he regretted not apologising to you, and that the more time passed, the least he could do it. He's said he has written you lots of letters, but he’s never been able to send any of them.”
“Can you decide?” he asked, barely a whisper. Which meant he wanted it, he just wanted Harry to reassure him.
“I just need to go outside if that’s okay?”
“Are you sure you want me there with you?”
“Love,” he said, sitting down next to him and touching his long hair. “Wake up, I made you breakfast.”
“Does it though?”
“Do you think I could have a look?”
“Have you? Experimented, I mean.”
“You don’t have to stay there if you don’t want to," Harry reminded Malfoy.
They quickly went to the owlery, only bumping into a couple of people, and Harry immediately started petting all the owls who let him close enough.
“I did, they told us not to worry, that it’s probably a creature gone mad and that it won’t harm the students,” she said, clearly pissed.
“Ron usually calls me around eight, what do you want to do in the meantime?” he asked once they were in the safety of his room. He sat down and brought Draco with him, immediately putting his arm over his shoulders to keep him close.
“Harry, pull it together, man,” Ron told him, smiling happily at him. “He’s talking about wine.”
“Good night, love."
“Whatever you want.”
Draco grunted in answer and opened one eye.
“Alright, I’ll see what I can do.”
“I just care about the people who are important to me, and you are one of them.”
“She what? Too many information all in one go,” he said dramatically.
“That’s fine.” He took his hand and made him walk around the desk until he was in front of him.
“Are you jealous?” He couldn’t even contain his smile at that. He looked like a kid at Christmas, or even better, the whole fucking tree lit up.
“Do you want to talk about it?”
“As if you’ve never done it.”
“Cool, yeah.” He snuggled even closer, even though it was almost impossible considering he was already half in his lap. “My first boyfriend.” Thankfully, or not, Draco was the only one who heard him giggle over that. Damn those French people and their delicious wine.
“And can I speak French in your ear while you carry me?”
He went back to his room to put away the cloak and collect what Robards had sent him, and then he left for muggle London. Apparently, a wizard had been selling real love amulets to tourists, and there had been many calls to the department to get rid of the spells.
“I'm sorry, you can feel my magic?” he asked, surprised.
“Do you really want to talk about these things with me?” he asked, surprised, unable to make sense of what was happening.
“Happy to hear that.”
“Wouldn’t it be safer for you to sleep in the castle for a while?”
“Guys, c’mon, I’m not that bad,” Hermione complained, but it was clear she didn’t really believe it either.
Malfoy sat up at that, his eyes so wide it was almost funny.
“I'll write you a letter tomorrow morning, just a list of things I will need for the lessons.”
“Of course, dear. Harry?”
“Duty," he simply said, standing up. He was ready to go home and hex himself for saying yes. He knew he was going to regret it, but he couldn’t say no to McGonagall, not when innocent students were in danger and no one of his colleagues took it seriously.
The following night was Draco's turn to be a nervous wreck. It wasn’t obvious to anyone else, but Harry could see and sense it. His legs weren’t bouncing up and down, his hands weren’t shaking, but his jaw was clenched and his eyes kept looking for Harry’s while they were cooking. Okay, Harry was cooking, Draco was sipping wine and pretending to cut vegetables. Useless, completely useless, but at least he was pretty to look at, much better than his old house elf. His energy also felt off. He couldn’t explain why, but he always felt a weird buzz under his skin when he was with Draco, and right now his skin felt very itchy.
Ever since he had started celebrating it with Ron and his family, Christmas had quickly become his favourite holiday. It was always filled with so much happiness and quality time with his loved ones, and he enjoyed spoiling his friends more than anything in the world.
“Oh, did you now?” He didn't even try to hide his grin, he knew it would have been impossible to contain it.
“I don’t care. I was attacked yesterday.”
“Hello," he said, slightly embarrassed.
“That’s amazing, good job,” he said, truly impressed. He knew Malfoy was smart, on the same level as Hermione, but he wasn’t sure he would have been able to do it and especially not so quickly. “Listen, I have lunch at the burrow tomorrow, maybe you could come with me and talk to Hermione?”
“Well, we should probably go see this unicorn, better move it before word reaches the students.” He got up and fixed his robe. “I'll let you know as soon as we find something.”
“I have. It was worth it, though.”
“You are here despite the fact that you are clearly uncomfortable, it means a lot.” He finally turned his head to look at him, still smiling softly.
“Are you staying for breakfast?” Draco asked, trying to make the moment last longer.
“Everything is a competition between us.”
“Alright,” Draco called out “that's all for today. Remember to practice the spells for next week, I'll give each of you a grade so please be prepared,” he said, as birds were flying about the classroom.
“Just try it, you big baby.”
“I can be whatever you want me to be. But no, I usually like it better when the other person is in control. Is this a problem?”
“I’m torn between thinking this can really be something but also trying not to get my hopes up in case you decide you can do better.”
“What do you mean? I’m the saviour, I can do whatever I want.”
“You don’t know how to say I love you, but you telling me I’m your family is okay? How do you even work.” And if he hugged him to hide the fact that he was close to tears, well he didn’t have to know. “Whatever happens, I’ll be there,” he whispered. “You can confirm for dinner, but you should know that there is no way we can skip Christmas with the Weasleys, so you better make sure we will be home in time.”
“Liar, your eyes were red.”
“I take that as a yes. But enough of that.”
“What happened to us?” he asked dramatically.
“We do. I wanted to take you on the London Eye but it’s already closed at this time.”
“How can you be so sure about it?”
“Sounds good.” He tried to smile, but he still seemed a bit unsure.
“How many lessons are we talking about?”
They went from a soup to roast with potatoes, green beans and carrots, and then moved on to a chocolate cake. Harry had discovered not too long ago that Draco loved chocolate more than he loved most people, and ever since he was little all cakes served at the Manor had been filled with chocolate.
“Apple pie,” Malfoy said, and the gargoyle moved, opening up in front of the staircase for them.
Suddenly it was nine thirty, and they were still in their little bubble, too wrapped up in each other to care about anything else, so they decided to take a walk. The city was still alive, and it was so weird for both of them, considering all the time they spent in the castle making sure kids were in bed early, but it gave them both a rush. They were no one there, just to people on a date, two adults with no responsibilities for the night. They could be whoever they wanted to be, and no one even cared or noticed them. It was liberating.
Harry was working on an old case, just some papers to finish and hand in at the end of the week, when Draco came running inside his bedroom.
“Answer my question,” he said, even though he already knew. He remembered that day, he dreamed about it so frequently he was sure he was never going to forget it. The blood, Malfoy on the ground, he had almost killed him.
“You saved us all in the end. And you saved me from the fire.”
“Whatever you say, babe.”
“This I just Harry talking, not pretend-therapist Harry.”
“Yeah. I told her I needed to ask you and that you’d give her an answer tomorrow. What do you say?”
He took a deep breath and considered it. He wanted to, so bad, but he didn’t know if he was ready to face all the ghosts of his pasts. On the other hand, he would have to come there everyday anyway to investigate.
As much as he had dreaded going back to Hogwarts, Harry couldn’t be happier about it in that moment. Once again, it had proved to him just how magical the place was, and yet again it had shown him that family can be anyone, even the most unexpected person.
Harry could see from his shoulders how tense Malfoy was. He looked a bit pale, and very nervous, but he was nothing if not determined.
“I am. Happier than I’ve ever been, or at least happier than I can remember being. And that’s the scary part, because my happiness depends solely on you. I know it’s not heathy, don’t go into therapist mode with me.”
“Can we go inside?” Draco asked, and Harry knew what he was doing, he really did, but Draco’s cute smile and the fact that he just wanted to see him happy made him agree easily.
“Do you need help?” he asked, unable to contain his laughter. There was something so incredibly hilarious about wizards using muggle things, especially technology.
“Okay, then. Thank you.”
At that Harry just couldn’t help himself and he kissed his cheek. “Don't try and make me feel guilty, you have tons of people around you all day.” He subtly started caressing his waist, smiling when he felt Draco just melt at his side.
“There we are.” He stopped in front of the restaurant, a large building with exposed bricks, the door was black with glass in the middle from which you could see the maître waiting inside, at the top there was the name
“If everything goes well this case will be closed by tomorrow,” he reminded him.
“Well, long time no see,” Ron said, closing the door behind himself.
“You can use this when you visit your parents, then. Here, I have one you haven’t seen yet. Do you like phoenixes?”
“Uh, you too. See you soon.”
Draco was nervous, Harry knew he was. He looked tense and like he could snap at any minute, and he was holding Theo tight against his chest, but he was trying he best. He was smiling politely to Mrs and Mr Weasley, he had said hello to everyone, Ginny included, and he had even started a conversation with Ron.
“You’ve gone pale, are you alright?”
“He's right, though. No one who lived that will ever forget, but we have to move on, and you deserve to be happy.”
“Draco?”
“Hermione loves you, she knows and trusts you, if she says she wants a kid with you, it's because she knows you can do it. You grew up with so many siblings and an amazing father, there is no way you can fuck this up. Besides, if you give your kids love that’s really all that matters, and I know you will love and support them with everything you have.”
“Yes," he simply said. Considering Harry was expecting a punch on the arm, he was pretty happy with the answer.
When they got to the metro, Harry thanked all the tourists of the day for forcing him so close to Draco. He let him hold on to a pole, then he wrapped himself around him. “I have nothing to hold on to,” he complained, smiling innocently, even though they both knew it was a blatant lie. Draco just wrapped an arm around him, and he spent the whole time hugging him, even when people started getting off.
“That bad, uh?”
“She's going to love the necklace, and you even more," one of them said, laughing. Yep, found them.
They reached the door in silence, and started walking on the wet grass, when something caught Harry’s attention. “Stop," he whispered, and stopped in his track. “There is something moving in the forest," he said, noticing Malfoy’s confused face. “Wait here.” He started walking, and rolled his eyes as soon as he heard Malfoy's steps behind him. “Go back.”
“I’ll see if I can do something about it," he said, taking pity on him. It was exhausting, he knew it. It had taken him two years to get used to people freaking out in front of him, and he still didn’t quite get it. It was one of the things that had broken him and Ginny up, although he wasn't sure they would have lasted anyway. She was amazing and she had been his first true love, but the war had changed them too much, and they weren’t what the other needed anymore. He needed stability and calm, and she was always training, trying her hardest to be free and live her life to the fullest. He was tired of that, all he wanted to do was settle down.
“The hat almost sorted me in Slytherin.”
“I want to see you, I promise.”
“It is, he keeps me company.”
“Okay, and how do you plan to do that?” he asked, and the fact that he seemed intrigued was a great relief to Harry.
“Oh, Draco.” He pushed him away just enough to look into his eyes. He wasn’t crying, but his eyes looked very red and puffy. “I’m sorry I couldn’t do that for you.”
“Okay, very lovely, I just wanted to see if you have questions about the case and then we will leave,” Ron said. He sounded slightly annoyed, but he was looking at him with very happy eyes.
“I actually came here today to find a place. He said he doesn’t need anything fancy, but I just, I wanna make him feel special, I guess? He’s never had a proper boyfriend before, I want to give him the full experience.”
It still sent a shiver down his spine whenever Draco called him ‘dear’, it made him feel special, loved. He was always so soft and nice when he was talking to him. He obeyed immediately and slowly moved his hand. When he saw that the owl was not opposed to it, he put his hand on his head and slowly petted it, while Draco kept feeding him. “Hello, Max.” The name felt funny in his mouth, but somehow it fit. It was just so ridiculously perfect.
“Tomorrow evening, I’ll let you know if something comes up.”
“I think I will have to just go and see for myself, then. Just so we can be sure,” Harry said.
“Me too. Can you please solve the case but pretend like you didn’t so you can stay here?”
“No, sorry.”
“Draco?” He put a hand on top of his shoulder and made him spin around to face him.
“She was nervous about tonight, nothing to worry about,” he said, quickly brushing it off.
“I don’t need to be wooed.” He slightly rolled his eyes, but his beaming smile betrayed him.
“Yeah, that you suck at." He let go of him and finally Draco turned around. “Hi.” He smiled at him, feeling so happy he almost started jumping on the spot. “You are supposed to kiss me.” He pointed his finger to the ceiling.
“Bittersweet, isn’t it?” Malfoy broke their precarious silence and smiled sadly at him.
“She told me the same thing in the dining room,” Harry admitted.
“Uh, yes?” He looked up, confused. Was it weird? He knew Ron and Hermione and many other married couples he knew were very attuned to each other’s magic.
“Always here for you.” He kissed his cheek, pulling him closer. “It’s going to be fine, love.”
“Is it?” He turned his head slightly, waiting for Draco to get the hint and just kiss him already. Which he did, bless his smart little brain.
The shop only had a couple of costumers inside, it wasn’t exactly the time of the year to get pets, but there were so many of them looking at him. Harry wanted them all. Yes, he was aware that it was a big contradiction to what he had said before, but he liked animals, okay?
“You are so fucked,” Ron said with a smirk. Bastard, he had been supportive of him and Hermione since the beginning, the least he could do was keep his comments to himself. Although Harry did break up with his little sister, that must have meant something.
“You’re going to love it.” He pulled him in for a kiss, letting his hands slip up to his hair and smiling in the kiss when Draco moaned softly.
“Well there was never love between us, not like there was between you and Ginevra Weasley. It was just to experiment a little, try new things and figure stuff out. Besides, I only wanted you.”
“Yes, I’m sure. Besides, I’m going to be lonely once you leave.” He pouted, a full-on pout on his lips, and he lifted the cat next to his face.
“Thanks for being here.”
“We were on different sides, that's all. You know, my muggle... relatives, let's call them that, they were racists, homophobes, basically the pure blood of their society with a lot less money. I saw how they shaped their son, how they turned their noses up at classmates they didn't like or talked shit about some of the neighbours, and he grew up to be the same, because that was all he knew. The only reason I didn't turn up that way, is because they hated me more than anyone else. I was different, a freak, I had no family. And yet, at times I still believed them, I still thought ‘oh, maybe I’m better than that person because I have this and they don’t’ and it took time, and a lot of growing, before I realised how stupid it was.”
“No one has been hurt or offended so far, so I guess we could say it's going fine," his father said, leaning back and reaching for a glass of whiskey.
“He apologised the first day I came here.”
“What do they smell like?” he asked, even though he was pretty sure he already knew the answer.
“I don't want to make a show of it,” Harry said, frustrated. But he knew that it had already been settled. Besides, if Draco really wanted to come, there was no way he was going to risk his life.
“Why are you telling me this?” he asked, confused.
He went back to his room, ready to just plop on his bed and sleep.
“I don’t think that would have ended well, " Malfoy said, still very respectful and so damn posh. He just sounded like that, there was nothing Harry could do to change it, and for some reason, he really didn’t want to. There had been a time when just hearing his voice had made him feel annoyed, but at the moment he just found it funny and almost like a friendly presence.
“Yes, chef,” he said, mocking.
“Hey, mate” Ron said, cheerful. Good sign.
Malfoy appeared next to him a second later, and he immediately started looking around.
“We try to do a week each when Harry isn’t away too much for work.” He cuddled more into his side at that, trying to be as close as possible. He really hated when Harry was on a mission or working until late, not only because they didn’t have time to talk, but also because he was constantly worried. He really hoped Hermione was going to agree and talk to him after the Christmas dinner.
“She told me to remind you that I forgive you.”
“Eat something, I’ll know if you don’t and I’ll send you some cookies.”
Draco just laughed at that and quickly kissed him, just because he could and he was happy. “Let's go inside.”
It wasn’t until dessert – a panna cotta with wild berries – that Ron remembered to bring up Harry’s case.
“I won't, promise.” He laughed when Harry lifted both of his eyebrows, clearly not convinced. “This is our first date after all, I do want to impress you and possibly make you stick around for a while.”
“Neither did I,” he admitted “and yet here we are, with a kitten.”
“Oh, that.”
“I do. A lot actually, so if you could please just-" For probably the first time in his life, Draco actually listened to him. He closed the distance between them and held on tight to his sweater, while Harry brought his hands up to his neck and toyed with the strands of hair that had escaped his bun. Their first kiss was pretty innocent, no tongue or uncomfortable scraping of teeth, but it still left Harry feeling breathless. It felt like it had been a long time coming, and they both were desperate to keep it going as long as possible and just stay in the moment forever.
“I’ve been officially invited to Sunday’s lunch. From now until the end of time. Is it alright?”
She started inspecting Draco after having disinfected his neck, and by the expressions she made she didn’t seem too worried. That was a good sign.
“I’m fine, it’s going well.” He put his free hand on his leg to squeeze it. “You?”
“Shit.” He quickly made his way back to Draco, and he offered him the glass. “Can I steal him from you just for a second?” Harry asked Mr Weasley.
“Fucking hell,” Draco and Ron said at the same time. Well, that was progress, wasn’t it?
“Can I ask you something? You don’t have to say yes.”
“It's not that easy. After a year of having
“I really don’t want to talk about this. Get some firewhiskey in me and I’ll tell you my darkest secrets, but not now.”
He tried not to look too to upset at the idea, but he wasn’t sure he did such a great job at it. “I’d like that.”
“A cat? Why did you adopt a cat?” Lucius asked.
“Do you feel mine? Maybe it’s only because I used your wand.”
“I think I panicked.”
“So, you are leaving tomorrow?”
“I’m sorry about him.” Draco said after a couple of seconds.
“Thank you,” he whispered, throwing himself at Draco and hiding his face against his neck. In all of that Theo did not move at all.
“Excuse me? I’ll put you to shame at our first lesson.”
“Very muggle-ish of me, I know.” He took a breath and blew out smoke. Great, now Harry was thinking about his lips. Thank you very much, Ginny.
“Are you drunk? Running a fever maybe?”
“I swear, they are all perverts in this school,” Draco murmured as they were almost out the door.
“Yeah, I know.” He just smiled at him. That was a side of Draco he didn't know, and frankly he didn’t need any more details to like him.
“Over my dead body, Potter.”
“I kinda do. Like, I feel when you are getting worked up.”
“Okay, stop it. We are talking about kids being in danger. I’ll go there whether you want it or not. What are you going to do, fire me?” he challenged.
“I’ve never seen Hagrid so scared, it's not like him to forbid Fang from coming with us. I would ask another professor, but since you are already here... it won't take long.”
“I don’t, but he is your father.”
“No, I personally asked him not to let you anywhere near this. You are too involved, you’d put yourself in danger,” McGonagall said, and really, he was an adult with a job and a kitten he had adopted with his boyfriend, but he was not going to say no to her.
“Do you wanna know which spell I used?” he asked, oblivious to his internal turmoil.
“Good thing you did. Don’t let this get to your head, but I-I don’t think I ever admired anyone like I did that night. You were everything I wanted to be, and you managed to stand up to him. I was so relieved when you won. I wanted him dead, and I really wanted you alive.”
He walked around London for a while, trying to detect any sign of magic, and finally he found something when he walked past two young girls who were giggling and holding a necklace each.
“I don’t know. I like Theodore. Or Timothy.”
“We’ve been closer for a while, though.” He forced him to lift his chin so he could look at him. “I like that you are open and honest about your feelings. I’ve never had this before, not even with my parents.”
“We found-" Malfoy started, but he cut him off immediately.
“It won't happen again and we will not talk about it,” he said, resolute.
“This place meant a lot to all of us, a war is not going to erase the fact that this was our home for seven years. Sometimes it's hard, I’m not going to lie. I find that my nightmares are worse here than they are when I’m home, there are days when I see a burnt spot and everything comes crashing back, and other days when I see a special spot and just remember all the nice things that happened.”
“Yeah, he’s great at that." He smiled looking down at his hands, sure that he was probably looking like a fool with a crush. “He just gets me in a way no one ever has. I know everyone lost friends and family, but with the war he lost himself too, just like I did. He wasn’t Draco Malfoy anymore, he was Draco Malfoy the Death Eater, just like I was some sort of hero. And before that, we both had to live up to impossible standards, we were indoctrinated and made to believe things that weren’t true.”
“Details, my dear.”
“No one does. Well, except some of your students.”
“Malfoy, can I ask for a favour?” he said, way more shyly than he had intended to.
“Harry!” Ginny jumped on him as soon as she saw him, and he barely had the time to catch her.
He could feel his own magic getting restless, escaping his control more and more as time went by. It was clear that that wasn’t a normal inferius, otherwise Draco would have been dead already.
“The circumstances were different. So many times, I found myself fighting only to survive and protect my friends, I don't blame you for doing the same.”
“Yes, I have to meet your parents, don’t I?” He knelt next to him, and Harry immediately wrapped an arm around him.
“Yes, let's just get this over with.”
“I wouldn’t be too sure.” Hagrid smiled at him and took a biscuit for himself. “You two always managed to bring out the worst in the other.”
“Stop it.” He tried to hide his grin, but he knew it was too late. “Do you know any nice restaurants he might like?”
The stayed like that even when Theodore jumped on the bed and sat between their faces, and didn’t move even when they knew they were both going to be late.
“Nice to see you again,” Ron said, sounding slightly less convincing, but still very polite.
“Did you have any other choice? Because I know I didn't. It was a war, Malfoy, some fight for what they believe in, others fight to stay alive, and it's valid. You got caught up in the middle of something that was bigger than you.”
“Are you thinking about it?” Ron smiled, the smug bastard. “Just... I know you don’t need my approval, but like, if you do like Malfoy, it's cool. I might not like him yet, but what he said when he came over to apologise to Hermione, and then when he came here after Fred’s funeral, it was really nice. I don’t know if I’ll ever trust him, but I want to see you happy.”
“Not ready as in dressed.” He winked at him, and he twisted his nipple before running away and up the stairs.
“Yes. I was wondering if I could use the Floo connection to get to work. Draco will send me my things in the afternoon."
“Oh, but of course. Let me see what me have here.” He opened a box over his desk and showed him its content. There were at least fifty necklaces, around twenty rings and a couple of bracelets. “We also have perfumes.”
“You only had one, you idiot.” She slapped him behind the head and he finally put her down.
“Too late.”
“He and Draco used to fool around. Not someone I’m eager to meet if I have to be honest.”
The students got up quickly, most of them left the room talking quietly between them, but a couple of Slytherin boys stopped to talk with him.
“It's a corrosive plant, it can burn the skin. Let me see if you have any weird bubbles.” He lighted up his wand and brought it closer to Malfoys’ chest. There were no bubbles on his chest, but he noticed white scars, running all over his chest, coming very close to his neck. “Did I-“ He looked up, feeling nauseous, and found Malfoy looking at him with red cheeks and an embarrassed expression. “Did I do this to you?”
“It’s gonna take me approximately five seconds to come, so.”
“That’s George. Do you really not know their names?” he asked, for some reason amused.
“For what, exactly? Hating me? We didn’t get along, nothing wrong with that.”
“Potter, you better stop.”
“I’m serious. Think about this.”
“Do you think you could point out these spots in a map?” Looking around he couldn’t find anything, either because this killer had left nothing behind or because it had been too long already, but maybe he was following a pattern.
“Why not,” he said, shrugging. “I know you hate the press just as much as I do, I’m positive you won’t give them anything, even if it means fucking me up.”
“Is he ok?” Harry asked immediately, ignoring his own nausea. The cat was sleeping, cuddled up on himself, with a cute stuffed animal next to him. “I think I’m in love,” he said, not tearing his eyes away from him.
He walked back to infirmary, much slower this time, and he wasn’t surprised at all when Madame Pomfrey threatened to cut his head if he tried to free ‘the beast’ inside her infirmary.
“Thank you."
Harry wanted to bang his head against the wall. Six years since the battle and this shit was still going on.
“Draco, language,” his mother said.
“Thanks, babe, I have a good teacher.”
“He’s here as moral support,” he protested, sitting on his chair next to Draco. “So, what did they say?”
“I felt the same when you told me about Blaise. You know, I was almost sorted in Slytherin, I had to beg the hat not to put me there. I wonder what things would have been like for us.”
“A couple of weeks and we will be in Paris together.” He hugged him, trying to squeeze him as hard as he could without hurting him. “Let me say bye to Theo.” He picked up their cat and kissed his head. “Take care of dad, yeah? He needs lots of cuddles and kisses,” he pretended to whisper in his ear. “I really have to go now.” He gave Theodore to Draco and kissed him quickly once last time, then he stepped into the fireplace and just disappeared into the flames.
“When are you leaving?” Draco asked after a couple of minutes of silence, broken only by their cat purring loudly.
He simply nodded and exited the room, followed closely by Malfoy. “You don’t have to see me out, I’m sure you have more important things to do.”
“Okay I was not stalking him because I fancied him.”
“Yes, I don't really like going alone. Usually Ron or Hermione come with me.”
The next morning he got the okay from Malfoy, and in the afternoon they decided to meet up and just do it.
“I-I keep seeing your memory from the forest. His face when he kills you. That’s reason I panicked after your memory, it wasn’t just because I saw him again, it was because I had seen you die. You have no idea how many nights I woke up screaming from a nightmare because I didn’t know if you were fine, what you were doing. And then when you showed up at the Manor, I wanted nothing more than to follow you, and help you. I wanted to protect you and I also wanted you to save me.”
“Eat quickly, I wanna kiss you.”
"Yeah, show me.”
“I think so, yeah. I enjoyed going around with you so much, I just want to be able to do it whenever and wherever we want.”
Until one morning McGonagall called him and Malfoy into her office.
“Not an animal, that’s for sure. It doesn’t even look like a human, just a creature.”
“I think I forgot to tell you that we adopted a car,” Draco finally said, taking pity on his mother and his father, who was leaning toward them, clearly curious.
“Boyfriend?” His eyes legit got bigger at that.
They stayed in silence for another ten minutes, occasionally kissing but overall just enjoying the view and each other’s presence, then they heard the clock signalling ten and they decided to head back to the castle.
“Very pretty cat, by the way.”
“Could work, yeah. Although I think seventh years won’t be pleased.”
“I’m sorry I scared you. When I saw him coming my way it was too late, I was just frozen on the spot.”
“Don’t you want to live life at the fullest?”
“Babe,” Draco called him, gently stroking his cheek.
“Yeah, I’ll get it.” He got up, gently touching her shoulder before leaving.
“Thank you, I really appreciate it.”
Ron and Hermione entered the room quickly, smiling brightly as always. “Hello,” Hermione said. She quickly reached Harry to give him a hug, then turned to Draco to shake his hand politely. “Malfoy,” she said, still sounding friendly.
“I don’t feel ready yet," he said, already knowing where Draco was going.
It was extremely creepy, he had to admit it. The silence of the forest, how dark it had suddenly gotten, the slow movements of the trees, which almost looked charmed to follow a pattern. He really wanted to just get out of there as soon as possible.
“I’m bisexual, I think? I’m more into boys at the moment, but I did love Ginny and what we had, so yeah I think bisexual is more appropriate.”
“Then we can try that.” He twisted his head to be able to kiss Draco’s forehead.
“Alright,” Malfoy started, “this is our first lesson. You won’t need to write down anything but you are allowed to if you feel the need. Just make sure you are concentrated and try to pay attention to our movements. Even better, stay away from the forest and you won’t need to use any of the spells we will be teaching you.”
“It’s going to be fine. It won’t happen for a while, right?”
“Yes, please.”
“Yes, lead the way.”
“I'm glad you like it. I was a bit scared when you said you wanted to take me to a fancy restaurant, because I know that sometimes they have questionable choices, and you really aren’t a posh person.”
“Wow, I feel so relieved,” he said, sarcastic. “I just wanted to let you know that I truly admire you and your strength. That’s also one of the reasons I hated you so much, because I was jealous of you and how you just took whatever came your way and made it work.”
“Discretion is key, understood?’
“No, apparently Draco’s had a crush on me for quite a long time, he was never really interested in Blaise.” He tried to ignore the fact that he could feel his cheeks heating up.
Draco nudged his shoulder, so he just went for it and started talking.
“Max, I want you to meet someone special.” He held his arm in front of the owl and he immediately moved over it, affectionately biting his arm. He got closer to Harry, so that the owl could see him properly. “This is Harry, and I like him, so please behave. Harry, let him see you hand.”
Harry looked up and started laughing. It was mistletoe. “Is this even the right season?” he asked, laughing against his neck.
He hid the necklaces inside his coat and walked quickly to the shop. The idiot wasn’t even trying to be subtle. Outside the shop was a huge sign shaped like a heart with ‘Happily ever after’ written on it. He shook his head, embarrassed for his own kind, and sent a message to Ron to come and get him while he kept him occupied.
“Wait, you are telling me you like pizza and we’ve never eaten one together? I thought it wasn’t posh enough for your standards.”
“Rude, I like it.”
“I know the feeling,” he said, snorting.
Harry laughed at that. He could imagine adult Malfoy shaking a little in front of the gargoyle, readying himself to be scolded for something he hadn't even done.
“I can’t say seeing you two hugging made me feel better about the whole situation.” He smiled sadly at that, almost a bit self-deprecating. “But I know you two will always be friends.”
“You’re welcome,” he whispered back, stroking his back.
“It's Hermione we are talking about, she will be so happy to know you opened up with her and talked things through. It means you are taking this seriously and you really thought about it.”
“No, it’s a surprise.”
“It's okay, I’m glad you told me. We will work on this, ok? We just need to figure out what we like and go from there. I’m sure we have more in common than you think."
“Potter,” Malfoy said, out of breath.
“C’mon, I’m trying to be nice,” he said, laughing at Harry’s disbelieving expression. “We all grew up after the war, if he can change, so can I. And if my best friend ends up falling in love with him, I need to at least stand his presence.”
“Thank you.” She opened the door with a flick of her wrist, and both boys left as quickly as they could. Old habits die hard apparently.
“I’m sorry I didn’t accept your hand.”
“Let me know,” he said, “totally up to you.”
“Lobster mousse with Aquitaine caviar and champagne butter sauce” he announced, while another waiter started filling their glasses with white wine.
“Good boy,” Draco said, reaching from one of the bowls in the owlery to give him some food. “Harry's nice, we like Harry,” he almost whispered, just for Max. “Dear, try to touch it.”
“I’m just going to get him some toys, is that alright?”
“Wow, you really suck at this,” he said, finally smiling again. “I'd like to make things official after a couple of dates, yes.”
“Yeah.”
“Yeah, hold on.” He apparated them in the cemetery, and as always he could hear people singing inside the church, celebrating Christmas, all the lights around the city were on, and even without the snow it made the atmosphere feel very festive. “This way.” He started walking, never leaving his hand.
“Of course, love.” He moved away from him and took his hand. It wasn’t very practical to walk up the stairs like that, but oh well. He needed to touch Draco, to remind him that he was there, and he was fine, and that they were going to be okay.
“Hagrid has found another dead animal,” she said, looking very tired and also a bit scared. “Another unicorn, a young one. I asked him to bring the body out of the forest, it's currently in one of the greenhouses, so that the students won’t be able see it.”
“Shut up, don't make me laugh,” he whispered back, trying to hide his smile.
“No, more about our date,” he said, suddenly looking a lot like a kid.
“What did you do with the body?”
“Indeed.” He pulled him on top of him, and kissed him, moaning into his mouth when he tasted himself. “What can I do for you?” he asked, already reaching down to touch his erection.
“It's fine, I just feel very vulnerable when I’m sleeping is all.”
“Good morning.” He smiled at him and let his hand slide down to Harry’s hair. It had taken him a while to decide, but when he had noticed how much Draco liked him with long hair, and especially how much he enjoyed pulling on it, he had simply let it grow and now it was longer than it had ever been, almost enough for a bun. “I think I was offered a blowjob?”
At lunch Malfoy seemed particularly happy. He had a weird smirk on his lips and his eyes were almost shining.
“No, I think I’ll let you wonder about my fantasies for a bit longer.” He started walking again, with no warning to Harry, who almost tripped on his own feet.
. It didn’t look special from the outside, but they had French food and good wine, things he was sure Draco would appreciate.
Draco cleared his throat way too loudly and got off his legs and back on the bed. “Do you think we could ask your friends to look after Theo?”
“That’s really great, I’m glad you two worked it out.”
“Love, would you like something to drink?” he asked, wrapping an arm around his waist.
“Then we can go there tomorrow and look at your memories.”
“How exactly did he do that?” Lucius Malfoy asked, talking for the first time in almost an hour.
“How come?” They reached a corridor and Malfoy started walking next to him. He looked kind of imposing, what with being so tall and his face so serious.
“I don’t want to fuck this up. I just- I know myself, I’m scared that at one point it will become too much or I’ll feel like I’m not worthy of your time and I’ll start pulling away from you.”
“Which means you will be covered in presents,” he told Draco, and the fact that Ron was letting in him in their jokes and being so nice made Harry feel warm all over. This was his family, the people who had chosen him, and he couldn’t be happier about it.
“Alright.” He moved closer to kiss his cheek. “Are we okay?”
“Good.”
“Are you going to make me beg?”
“I’m glad, I’m happy too.”
The next day Harry was bored. Not just bored, he was lonely. He had spent the evening before with Draco cuddled up against his side, his head resting against his shoulder and his whole body melted against his. They had cuddled until midnight, then Harry had decided to go back to his room, where he had regretted his decision because he was cold and he missed him already. Okay maybe he was a sap, so what.
He had told Draco as much when he had talked shit about his Christmas tree, and the other man had not insisted, but apparently he hadn’t forgotten about that.
“Still scary,” Harry said while they were walking down the stairs.
“Whenever I feel like, but it's usually on Friday nights. We like to drink together.”
“I don't want anyone to remember him, I wish we could just erase him completely.”
“Very well, let me see.”
“Do we have the same healer?” he said, smiling, now a lot more relaxed.
“Not fair to kiss me and ask for a favour,” he mumbled, but he was already doing it.
They went back to back, then counted to ten while walking away from each other. When they reached the end, they both turned around, wands pointed against each other, and immediately started firing. They knew each other too well, after years spent observing and obsessing over the other for really different reasons. Harry knew Malfoy was going to attack, so he immediately casted a shield, and made sure that Malfoy’s curse bounced back toward the ceiling instead of going on the students.
“You tell me. I’ve been working here for two years and I still think she’s gonna put me in detention every time she asks for me.”
“He needs help, no one can do anything here.” She put a hand on his shoulder and moved him out of the way, so that Hagrid could pick him up.
“I get that, but why? You could have anyone you wanted, why me? I treated you horribly and-"
“Babe?” he asked, still sounding half asleep.
“We saw each other two weeks ago," he said, changing back to his normal self. “Did you want to talk about something?”
“I doubt it's much better for you. But we do have one very important thing in common and I’m sure we both want to do our best for him.”
“Yes.” He looked happy, something he had seen so rarely in those weeks, and Harry was getting more and more excited as the time went by. The fact that he was the reason of that made him feel special, it gave him a weird rush.
“Then let me be. I don’t want your pity,” he spat out, as if that word was disgusting.
“Of course.” He smiled at him and opened the door to his hut. “Good night, Harry, it’s good to have you back.”
“Yes, because that wouldn't be distracting at all.”
“Sorry, I’m just happy for you.” He smiled at him, then suddenly his face fell. “Harry, you do realise who his parents are, right?”
“For the tenth time, yes, Draco. It was fine, your mum was really nice and your father was less scary than I remembered him.”
Harry laughed at that, so incredibly happy about what was going on between them. “I was also thinking about going on a date this Saturday. Would you like that?”
“Replaced by a cat.” He followed Draco, unable to stop smiling. He was so happy he couldn’t believe it. Not only because of the cat, but the reason they had gotten him. He knew Draco was still quite closed off, still not totally comfortable with showing affection if not in the middle of the night or when he was exhausted, so the fact that he was doing this for him made it all so much more special.
“You want me to come?” he asked, surprised.
“It wasn’t just that. I’ve seen them, I’ve seen their faces, their rage. Some of them wanted blood, and used the war as an excuse to get it. The good thing about the other side is that no one ever pretended to be good, on our side people thought they were better just because they were fighting against him.”
He opened his hand in front of the owl and let the animal just study him.
“Perfect. Thank you, Harry, it really means a lot.”
“How are you feeling?” he asked, trying to move the attention from himself.
“Thank you," Draco whispered as soon as he was sitting next to him.
“I think it was probably like having him in your house. Unpredictable, sometimes he showed up and took over all my attention, sometimes he disappeared for days.”
“Stop being a dick.” He pinched his side. “I just wanted to say that as long as we are together, and I plan on being with you for a long time, I will do my best to make you happy and make you feel appreciated and loved.”
“Not while I’m here,” he said, meaning it more than he would have expected.
“Maybe he just uses magic to remove the organs,” Harry suggested. “He seemed conscious enough to do that.”
Malfoy started walking again, and this time Harry followed him. He quickly realised that it still felt like home, despite all it felt familiar and safe. He could see some signs of the war, some marks left on the stone, burned pieces of wood no one had had the energy to replace, but it was still immaculate. He took his time taking it all in, looking down while the stairs were moving, watching everything carefully, as if trying to memorize every single detail like he had the first time.
“Let them be, we were also annoying,” Hermione intervened for them, smiling kindly at both of them.
are distracting me.” He moved away before Draco could hold on to him and kiss him again. “See you later.”
“That’s not true. You cut the vegetables, set the table and went out to get wine. I wouldn’t have finished alone.”
“Are you angry?” he asked, not able to understand what had caused the sudden change in his mood.
“I’ll be right back.” She left the room quickly. She clearly needed some fresh air, Harry couldn’t imagine Narcissa Malfoy doing the job of her elf.
“No, some of ours had to use several spells on him to look at his memories, then we figured it out and contacted the witch. They are still running some tests on him, I’m not sure what’s going to happen once they are done, we don’t know yet if he can die since he had some human inside of him, or if he will be like this forever.”
“I have so many people on my conscience, I will never be able to forget what I’ve done.”
“Oh so you weren’t smelling me earlier?”
“I wasn’t sure myself,” he said, going back to business. He reached her and shook her hand. “But I was curious to hear this proposition you have.” She motioned to the chair and he sat down, trying to relax.
“Did you really have a good time?” Draco asked once they were back inside Harry’s house.
“Very well," Harry said, smiling at her. “Now, this is the movement you have to practice.” He turned his back on them, and made sure everyone could see his hand before showing the correct movement. “Now try, please don’t hesitate to ask if you have any doubt, we will be walking around the hall.”
“Harry, please.” He pulled on his hair, trying to get him closer to where he really wanted him.
“What was it until now?”
When they finally parted, they were both panting and they simply refused to let go of the other.
Harry turned and found Malfoy clad in a long silk dressing gown, with only his wand to light up his path. “It feels liberating, not being scared of getting into trouble for being up late.”
The day of the date arrived way too quickly, and Harry was panicking.
“But dad.” He got closer and crouched down, keeping Theodore in front of his face. “Dad Harry is sorry.”
“I just thought you'd appreciate it.” He shrugged, making it seem like it was no big deal, when in reality it had almost driven him crazy. How was he supposed to know that there were so many different pyjamas in the world? He just wanted silk, that’s all he knew, why bother him with patterns and colours and this and that. In the end he had spent way too much money, but he had found the perfect one. Dark green, with silver threads and incredibly smooth. “Open it.” He waited, not exactly patiently, for Draco to open it.
He waited for some students to go inside the classroom, the he sneaked into the room and hid in the corner, waiting for the lesson to start.
“Of course, sir.” The guy left, leaving them alone with the kitten.
“You look cute tonight,” he said, not able to control himself. He just wanted to make him smile, to make him feel appreciated.
“I was freaking out, as you say, because I was scared you were going to realise that they were right and that I do have feelings for you.”
“Me, too,” he almost whispered.
“Of course. Now I finally realise why I spent so much time thinking about you holding on to me on that broom.”
“If that’s what you want.”
“Alright then. Christmas' Eve with my parents, and then dinner with the Weasleys. Okay, I can do it.”
“Do I?” Draco was smirking, which meant nothing good was going to happen. “I can dirty talk in French if you want.”
“If he doesn’t know already, he is not as bright as you think.”
“Maybe, but it does seem like you are becoming something for him.”
“I know what you mean. I had a couple of panic attacks when I first started training. We would be in a huge field with a lot of people, and suddenly I was back at the battle and I couldn’t move anymore, his voice was in my head and I was scared again. It happens. We were kids, we saw people die, suffer, we saw friends fighting each other, the war destroyed our families, we will never get rid of this weight, but it will get better with time.”
“Of course I have. Midnight snacks are the best.”
“You did?”
It took Harry a few seconds to catch up, and he had to remind himself not to run behind Malfoy like a lost puppy.
“Why were you scared? It's just me, we’ve been picking at each other for years.”
“Do you think he can stay with you while I have my classes? I don’t want him to be lonely.”
“Headmistress, I didn’t know you were coming," he said, moving his eyes away from Malfoy, who was checking a little girl's wrist.
“I swear to Merlin, if this happens every time they see you I’ll start giving them so many homework they won't be able to leave their rooms,” he said, frustrated, running a hand through his hair to move it from his face.
“Thank you.” He held him in place and demanded another kiss. “I’ll see you at lunch?”
“Of course you can. The sheets were changed yesterday, it's all clean and fresh.”
“None of that, I did it because I love you, not because I wanted something from you. If you don’t want to come here, just day so.”
“Have I ever not fixed a patient?” she asked, almost offended. “He will be fine, don’t worry,” she said once she realised how shaken Harry actually was.
“How are you feeling?” Draco asked, walking closer than necessary.
“Oh, I know.” He sighed and started walking, way too fast for Harry, who almost had to run to keep up with his long strides. “What do you have there?” he asked, not even turning to look at him.
“Even if you find out, I’m not going to confirm."
“Do you think he will wake up soon?”
“You said we could come to you if we had a problem.”
“We talked about you quite a lot, she really cares about you, you know?”
“That's what a good boyfriend is supposed to do, you don’t need to thank me.” He bopped his nose just because.
“Where else should I have been? I would have lost my mind.”
“Sex. Are we going to have sex?”
“Not really, no. It’s just a reminder of all the wrong choices she took. Had she said no from the beginning, we wouldn’t even be here now.”
“I would like to keep this matter as private as possible.”
“Oh, shut up.” He pushed him lightly with his shoulder, but not even the terrible lightning in the corridor could hide his red cheeks.
“We are in a magical school, most animals here are smatter than a lot of kids I know.”
Harry barely managed to hold back his laugh, instead he got up and went closer to them. “Mr Malfoy, thanks for inviting me.” He reached out, and tried his best not to shiver when their hands made contact. That man had ruined his life so many times, he had almost killed Ginny, he had summoned Voldemort, helped him rise again. And here he was, shaking hands with him, just for Draco.
“Aw, Malfoy, are you keeping up with my life? How sweet of you.”
“Are you sure about whatever it is you are doing with Malfoy?” Ginny asked.
His crush had obviously gotten worse. Now that he actually knew Malfoy and the reasons behind a lot of what he had done and what had made him hate the other boy for all those years, he couldn’t help it but like him more and more everyday. Malfoy was still an annoying prat who made fun of him, but now it felt like teasing, maybe flirting at times. He wasn’t annoyed by what he said, he was endeared.
“Okay, thank you.”
“He needs to get to the infirmary.” McGonagall stepped next to him. “Harry, let Hagrid carry him to the castle.”
“Why does she hate me?” He covered his face to take a deep breath, frustrated. “Listen-“
“Won’t that confuse him?”
“So? Never too early for Christmas.”
“I know, but do you really want to give him all this power when he’s already been defeated?”
“What?” He looked at him for a second, then lowered his gaze on his arm. “Oh.” He immediately stopped stroking his arm, and let it fall to his side. “It used to, at the beginning, but after
They tried to change subject after that, and started talking about Ginny’s practice and their various job, until the last plate was empty and everyone had had at least two servings of cake.
They managed to find a somewhat hidden corner, and together they apparated to the castle. It sounded like a better idea than going together inside a bar and asking to use their Floo.
“I will, sorry.”
“You stink.” Mature, very mature, his best come back ever.
“Thanks.” He took a deep breath and got closer to the pensive. “How bad is it?”
“You are in deep, my friend.” He reached over to pat his shoulder.
They quickly filled all the plates, and in no time everyone was eating and complimenting Harry on the food.
“So. Malfoy” Ron said.
“Sure.”
“And a dinner to plan.”
“Potter, I can feel you starting at me,” he said after a while.
“Good night."
Just like the night before, the forest felt like a totally different place, except it was even more silent that it used to be. Not even during the war, when Harry was walking to his death, had it felt so silent and creepy. It seemed as if the whole forest was still and quiet, not one single animal was moving, they didn’t dare to.
“You are succeeding.”
“Whatever, a girl was reading it in class and I saw an article saying you were getting married.”
He left quickly to go tell Draco what had just happened, but when he arrived in the room, he forgot about everything. Draco was on the sofa, in front of the fireplace, and he was reading a story to Theo, who was sleeping on his lap.
“Okay then, be careful.” He stepped inside the forest and immediately it felt like another place. It was so much quieter and dark, he could see movements all around them, but nothing that resembled what he thought he had seen.
“Stop, we do not talk about this. Not now.”
“I’ll ask Robards tomorrow. I need to take advantage of the fact that he was wrong and probably feels guilty.”
“Looks like it.” He rested his chin over his head, hugging him closer to his chest. “It doesn’t feel that different, does it? I feel like we are talking like we used to before, and when we touch it just feels so... natural?”
“Too late.” He walked to the door and just closed the door behind himself to get ready for bed. He could hear Draco moving in the room, and for some reason it felt so incredibly normal and right. He just loved knowing that he had someone to cuddle during the night, and even better he liked the fact that that someone was Draco, looking adorable in his clothes. It was a little short on him, but at the same time slightly saggy because Harry had more muscles.
From there their perfect plan went to shit. They had planned every detail of the lesson, but somehow, they found themselves casting spells and shields so fast and at times nonverbally, that none of the student even had the time to understand what was going on. And the worst thing was that it was fun. Malfoy was good, Harry already knew that, but it had been a while since he had had the chance to duel with someone who was on the same level as him and was not scared to use his full powers because he was The Boy Who Lived. Malfoy didn’t care, and perhaps he was the only one. Even his friends had treated him differently at first, Hermione too scared to make him snap by unintentionally mentioning something, Ron was still feeling guilty because of what had happened in the forest, and even Ginny couldn’t help but always worry about him.
“There is nothing to worry about,” he insisted.
“You can't stop in the past, Harry, you need to let things go. You will never forget, even if you heal, but you will be able to remember and concentrate on the good things.”
As expected, they were both sleeping when he came back. Theodore had curled up on the pillow next to him, and Draco had fallen asleep with his hand over his little tummy.
“Thank you, it means a lot. I will ask him if it’s something he would like to do one of these days.”
“This better not leave this room, Potter,” he said, because while he was working on it, sometimes he still had a hard time accepting all the love Harry wanted to pour on him. He had started feeling more worthy, he knew he deserved it, but his cheeks still went red any time Harry went over the top with his declarations and he went back to being sarcastic so that he didn’t have to answer.
“That would he brilliant. I think the best thing to do is put first and second years together, ‘cause they are still very inexperienced. Third and fourth years together and then fifth, sixth and seventh. What do you think?”
“I’m glad.”
“Hey, Potter?” he called him, holding on to his hand.
“So, will you come stay with us?” she asked, now sounding a lot more relieved. She almost looked happy, too, at the idea of having Harry back. The McGonagall of a few years prior would surely have found it ridiculous.
“It smells amazing in here.” Draco came up behind him and wrapped him in his arms, resting his chin on his shoulder. “We need to do this more often.”
“How do you see me?” he asked, almost in a whisper.
She smiled at him, her years finally catching up to her after all the stress of the last years, and she left silently.
“I really don’t think I’ll have to beg that much.” He smirked at him, relieved to know they were on the same page.
“We could apparate in there? Just sit there quietly, with no one rushing us.”
“I don't know, it’s just not something I talk about? Nothing personal, I don’t mind telling you, I just never felt the need to? I told Ron and Hermione only because I wanted to explain to them one of the many reasons me and Ginny didn’t work out. I wanted to experiment, to discover this new side of me and just finally be able to settle down with someone I loved.”
“Thanks.” He smiled at his old professor. She had always been so stern and strict, but he knew she cared more than anyone else. He trusted her just as much as he had trusted Dumbledore, or maybe just a little bit less now that he knew what he had hidden from him.
“I’m doing this for you, don't be an asshole.”
“Let’s go.” He opened the door, and quickly the voices they could hear in the corridor died down. The kids parted, and Draco started walking between them to reach the stage they had set for the lesson.
“There is nothing going on between us. We are just... friends? Maybe not even that. We talk a lot, though, we’ve been through similar things, we understand each other.”
“I am, yes. Malfoy and I went in yesterday evening ‘cause I saw something moving, but we didn’t find anything.”
“Whatever makes you sleep at night, dear.”
Then they just walked around, stopping from time to time to look at something in the shop windows but never going inside, not even for the broomsticks. That is, until they saw the pet shop.
“Of course, dear. Harry, show him the bathroom.”
“I'm not here to please them. They’ll help train the youngest if they get bored.”
“You really want that? With me?”
“Good night, Harry.” She smiled at him one last time, then went back to the papers in front of her.
“Yes.”
“Okay, fine. God, you sound like Molly.” He finally got up and stated getting dressed, while Draco seemed intent on not moving at all. “Love, you will be late.”
“Babe,” he said, giving in once again. Fuck Draco Malfoy, honestly. What was he doing to him? He reached out again to touch his cheek. “You and your cat look really cute together,” he simply said, moving his hand from him to the furry ball in his hands. The cat seemed very peaceful, not the beast the guy had made him out to be. And he knew cats were little shits who tricked you, but he had no doubt that Draco was going to give this little cat all his love anyway. “Should we go back to the castle straight away? So he can settle in?”
“Why thank you, Harry, I feel so flattered.”
“About?” he asked, not even turning around. Why did he have so many pyjamas? Sure, he loved a lazy Sunday at home, but he was an active guy, he had no need for twenty different pyjamas.
“I like sir better."
“Fair enough. But was there something between them?”
“Then I’d love to try,” he said, and he was blushing. He looked so pretty like this, with his cheeks red and his hair a bit wild, just like he had looked in school after two hours spent over a cauldron preparing a potion.
“I’m sorry, I just- Parkinson, Goyle, Bluestrode,
Harry apparated them once again, because being dragged by someone else was so much worse and feeling Draco's hand in his made him feel more grounded, and they appeared right in front of the gate.
“Of course, I’m sure Hermione will like it a lot.” He laid down and turned on his side to look at him. “Come here, cuddle me.”
“We will make this work,” he promised, resting his lips against his head and just breathing in the perfume of apples.
“I'd love that.” He rubbed his head against him, feeling needy. “Do you like sleeping here?”
“Getting a cat.” He started petting his little head, and the cat nuzzled against his hand. Fuck, he was in love already.
“No.” He lowered his eyes on his own hands, and only now Harry noticed how nervous he seemed. He was literally torturing his hands, twisting his own fingers and pinching the skin.
“Okay, just a tiny bit then.” He relaxed his grip just enough to let him move, but even then, Malfoy stayed with his head hidden against his neck. “There you go.” Without thinking about where they were and who was watching, he turned his head to bury his nose in Malfoy’s hair. Fucking hell, he just had to smell like apples didn’t he. Great.
“Yes, sir,” one of them said. Ron loved new Aurors so much, it was his favourite time of the year when they came out of training and started working with them.
“Oh, Draco. Have you taken any potion?”
“I know, I just- what if they just tell me that I have no place there?”
“Yeah, they are already obsessed with us.”
“No, I won’t. Now stop worrying your cute little head and enjoy our last moment as a free couple.” He leaned against him once again, smiling when he felt Draco’s hand caress his hip under his coat.
“Only the ones we do together.”
“Don’t worry, with all the love potions I’ve received these years I know what to do.”
They walked for over fifteen minutes, then they stopped to check the Map. Rowle’s dot had moved slightly, getting closer to them. They couldn’t be more than ten minutes away from him. He turned quickly to check on Draco, then he started walking again.
He reached out and grabbed his hand, feeling the need to keep him close. “I see you as a brilliant wizard, very smart and cultured. I see you as an amazing teacher, who’s patient and kind and who listens to his students. But I also see you as someone I could really fall for. You are the better version of yourself, you didn’t like your past so you changed it, you took everything that was wrong and made it better, and I'm so proud of you for that.” He reached out and caressed his cheek, wiping away a single tear. “You deserve peace and happiness, and I wish I will be able to give you just what you need.”
“They don’t want to believe us, they are too scared it might actually be something bad,” Malfoy answered before Harry got the chance to. “We wrote several letters, McGonagall even had a couple of fire calls with the Aurors, but they say it’s probably just a wild animal gone mad and that he will be dead in no time.”
“I can’t leave him,” he said, panicked.
“Alright.” He recovered the cloak from the closet and put it on Draco, making sure all of him was covered. “Ok, we can go now.”
“We both will be alright,” he said, now sounding more convinced. “And then I will start planning our next date.”
“Well I can assure you that Harry Potter doesn’t think these things. He is my friend, surely he should hate me more than you since I was there when it happened.” He smiled at them and waited for them to nod. “I will talk with the head of their house and make sure this doesn’t happen again, okay?”
“Mine too,” Draco reminded him. “My first ever proper relationship, really.”
“Wizard or muggle?”
“I really want him. I’ve been thinking about getting a pet for a while now. I really am lonely when I’m home alone and don’t have kids scream out of my room.”
“I love you,” he said, because now that he had said it once he didn’t seem able to stop.
“I didn’t see anything.”
“Well, Draco got a cat, I’m the adoptive father.”
“No, but you can’t say your obsession with him was just platonic.”
“Yes, just please be careful. This is the only thing I have of, you know, my dad, Sirius and Lupin.”
They finished eating and they took turns showering, then they left for the closest metro to get to the Leaky Cauldron. They barely talked the whole time, but Harry could feel Draco trying to stay as close as possible to him, even with their hands linked. It felt as if he was scared Harry was going to disappear out of nowhere.
“Yeah, I want to. As long as you will be by my side making sure I don’t get hexed.”
“So he wasn’t dangerous? No poison or things like that?”
“Yes, Cameron?”
“This is already my best Christmas ever,” he said, bringing a hand down on Harry’s head and the other behind his own neck.
“Of course it is. I love having you all here." He pulled him in for a quick kiss because he just couldn’t help himself. “Thank you for trying so hard, I appreciate it a lot.”
“What are you- Oh my god, no, you weirdo.” He sat down next to him, and leaned in way too close. “I managed to make the Map bigger, now I just need to see if I can either replicate or expand the charm to the forest. Although I think it will take time to make it accurate, we need to have a clear idea of how the forest is made.”
“Alright then. Be more carful next time, I’m sure Harry can handle it alone, you don’t have to go back to those things.”
When they got there, Madam Pomfrey basically sent away all other students complaining for a cold, and sent Hagrid to call some healer from the hospital as soon as Harry told her what had happened.
“We can try them later,” he said, smiling smugly. “Or now, so you will feel them all day.”
He managed to make a reservation without using magic, for which he was very glad considering he was an Auror, and finally he headed back when it was almost two in the afternoon.
“So you are staying to spend time with Malfoy, got it,” he said without missing a beat.
“He seems nice enough,” Hermione conceded. “And I’m really curious to work with him.”
"Alright, I’ll go see it. Can I send things over to the Headquarters? I was thinking that maybe Hermione might have an idea of what is going on.”
“I did absolutely nothing,” Draco said, sharing a private smile with him.
“I’m sure you do. But you are quite a famous guest, so,” he said, clearly trying to bite his tongue from making some nasty remarks. Some things never changed. He started walking, and Harry had to take a breath before setting foot inside the castle. “Are you alright?” Malfoy stopped and looked at him, not really worried, maybe more sympathetic. “I know the feeling of coming back for the first time.”
“Thank you.” He smiled at her, and turned quickly to look at Harry, who just nodded happily and went inside.
“Not here,” he pleaded. That was pure torture. They had only kissed so far, which he was perfectly happy with, but he couldn’t deny how attracted he was to him, or the fact that he had not had sex in way too long and most of the times their make out sessions ended with him wanking in his shower and thinking about Draco's long fingers.
Tom and Mark obeyed immediately, somehow managing to tie his legs up, and before he could fall on Draco, Harry was at his side helping him get away.
“Merry Christmas, love.”
“Yeah, let’s go.”
“Professor?” one of them asked. He was the shortest one, very small and fragile looking, but he was keeping his head up.
“Do you think she’d talk with me?”
“Yeah, okay, but did it upset you?”
“I knew you would. You don’t fool me with your simple date shit.”
“Yes. I lost friends too, you know. No matter what side, we all lost someone.”
“Why?”
“Seriously? What is it with headmasters and food?”
“It's a bit of a mess, to be honest. We’ve heard of a guy who has a pet dragon, but no one seems to be able to find him, which is just ridiculous considering you can’t really miss a dragon flying over your head. We also have another wizard selling potions to muggles, but that happens at least once a month.”
“Why not?”
They waited for both of them to leave, then Draco immediately dove in into his food, while Harry just poked it with his fork as if it was going to attack him.
“I should have known this was an ambush to get me to work more. Alright, I will look into this for you.”
“Just you, yeah. Sorry.” He closed his eyes and reclined his head against the sofa. He looked incredibly inviting like that, with his long neck exposed for him to kiss, his lips slightly parted, his hair a bit over the place. How come he had never noticed how attractive Malfoy was? Some could argue that he was busy saving the world and finding out what the boy was doing rather than paying attention to his long fingers and pretty eyes, but still. Malfoy was really good looking, he had always been, and now Harry was wondering if it could have been him instead of Blaise if only he had accepted his hand that first day. “Are you staring at me?”
“It's the memory of me going to him the day of the war. I left out the actual battle, just the interesting parts with the forest. We can go out as soon as we get there and see him, because after that I was basically dead so I don’t have a memory of the forest on the way back.”
“I said I was going to do this properly.” He leaned down and kissed him quickly. “I’m gonna plan our date, you have fun teaching.”
“They won’t let me take a holiday just to come here.”
“No one would listen to me.”
“That’s me, your sappy boyfriend.”
“I don’t know how it’s going to work between us. I guess I’m scared of what people might think, what they might see when they see me next to you. Ginny was perfect for you.”
“No, I heard Theo crying.” He hugged him and hid his face against his neck. “I’m going to miss this so much.”
“Yeah, I’ll meet you there.” He briefly touched him while walking by, and he exited his room to go see their Headmistress.
“I am,” he confirmed, sending a quick glance Draco’s way. He was listening to something Mr Weasley was saying, and nodding, pretending to be interested. It filled him with so much love to see him try and surrounded by his family. He had almost cried when Molly had given him a handmade sweater, just like the one Harry had, but green and silver.
“Neither did I, or my father for the matter.” He smirked at that, clearly proud of himself for having pissed Lucius Malfoy off.
“Not yet." He turned slightly to hide his face against his neck, and he threw an arm over his chest to hold him close.
“This is what helped me keep up with you in sixth year. It’s called the Marauder's Map, it was created by my dad and his friends. It allows you to see everyone in the school right now, I was wondering if maybe we could push our luck and see if it can be extended to the forest too.”
“I should have known you were the cheesy type.” He let go of his hand, but even if he was trying to look annoyed, there was no way to hide his cute blush or the way his eyes were crinkling.
“Very well, thank you Harry. And you too, Draco. I have to say I’m surprised you two are working so well together, we should have paired you up a lot sooner.”
“That’s what I though,” Draco said. “That’s why I didn’t pay too much attention to his name.”
The weeks went on like this and suddenly it was already November. They worked on the Map together, drank together on Friday nights, prepared their lessons together and delivered said lessons. He had never seen so much of Malfoy in his life, and yet it seemed natural. They were always talking about something, and the best thing was that they were both so open and honest. Malfoy had opened up about his father, what it had been like growing up with him and how scared he had been of disappointing him – while now it seemed like it was his life mission to piss him off -, and Harry told him all about the Dursleys, how they had treated him, what he had had to do and how his cousin had bullied him his whole life. They were so close now he thought not even Ron and Hermione knew all those things about his childhood. And it was weird, so incredibly weird, that Malfoy knew those things about him, but at the same time it had felt natural at the time. He had wanted to tell him, and he had wanted to listen to what Malfoy wanted to share with him.
“Stop it, you are a good person.” He scratched lightly behind his ear, and Draco immediately started rubbing his head against him. “And also a very cuddly one.”
“I’m really asking.” He rolled his eyes, but he was also smiling so Harry counted that as a win.
“They think we are paranoid, but even then, it would be better to be paranoid and make sure the kids are safe rather than risk it.”
“Ssh, papa is sleeping.” He hugged him against his chest and kissed his little head. “What do you want? Food?” He put him in front of his bowls and sat next to him, just looking at him.
Harry finally opened his eyes, and he had to agree. The view was simply stunning, with all the trees already covered with lights for Christmas.
“Are you okay? Because we don’t have to do this.”
“I’m glad.” He kissed him quickly after making sure Lucius wasn’t looking. “Another ten years and we will have dinner with the Weasleys too.”
From there they just started talking, Ron and Harry very excited about Quidditch and a new case at work, and Draco and Hermione bonding over their common passion for runes. Even though neither of them actually used them on the daily, they were both very fascinated by them.
“I do, I’m just scared it's going to suck.”
“Okay then, follow me, dinner is starting soon, we waited for you today.”
“That she's never seen you so happy.”
“It's a memory, it won’t hurt us.”
Draco opened it, and immediately looked up at Harry, his eyes wide and smile even bigger. Inside was a key, a very old one, and Harry had bought a snake key chain to go with it.
“Yeah ‘cause I’m making you feel so much better,” he said, sarcastic, and really pissed at himself.
“What?” both Harry and the other guy asked.
“Thank you.” In the corner of his eyes he saw Malfoy relax his shoulders. “So, how’s the Weasley girl?” he asked after a while, and Harry knew it had taken him a lot to ask it, so he decided not to make fun of him. For the time being.
“Everyone. Every time you see a kid looking at you, you look more scared than you did during the war.”
“You have to promise me you will do everything I ask you to. If I tell you to run away or hide, you do it, no question, no turning back.”
It was weird how right it all felt. Taking Draco on a date, walking hand in hand, talking about stupid things and just spending time together. And yet it was. Everything felt right. For the first time in his life, he wasn’t worried about being killed, about getting detention, about his boss shouting at him, he had Draco to look forward to at the end of a long day. The thought scared the shit out of him, and yet he was ready for their relationship.
“Okay, we will not split up for this. No matter who you are, if one of you gets away, I’m going to personally hex you," he said, looking around the circle they had formed. Everyone nodded, even McGonagall. “If someone tells you to do something, you do it without questioning it, chances are that by the time you make sure it was actually dangerous, it will be too late.” He didn’t take his eyes off Draco while saying that, and his boyfriend just nodded. “Good.”
“Well I am, I can keep you posted.”
“I’d really like to stay.” He recovered pretty quickly and straightened his back, trying to look calm and collected when he was probably freaking out on the inside.
“Yes, as I was saying, Draco is keeping me company. Give him a few glasses of whiskey and he'll become your best friend,” he said, while serving him some biscuits that did not look particularly edible.
“Can I be excused for a second before we start working?” Malfoy asked, always very polite.
They stayed like that for a while, until Harry realised Draco was drifting off so he made them lie down and just hugged him from behind.
“I just... have a hard time with death these days," he said with a bit of difficulty. “Like, grasping the concept and accepting it.”
They finished getting ready in silence, with Theodore following both of them around, especially inside the bathroom.
“Why are you not looking at me?” He gently put a hand on his waist, but he didn’t force him to turn around. “Draco, can you please look at me?” he asked in the gentles tone he could manage.
“We'll bring him.”
“That woman is something else.”
“I never thought I would hear you say something like this.”
“Oh c'mon, he hasn’t stopped looking at you for more than five seconds,” George said.
“Of course, who better then you to save me?” he joked, trying to lighten up the mood.
“And you are okay with it?” Hermione asked, very cautiously. She knew how much he had struggled after Hedwig, they all did, and all of them had tried to convince him to get a new pet and not deprive himself of that special bond.
“I’m sorry for not answering immediately. Of course I feel the same, it's just hard to say it.”
“You don’t say.” Malfoy got closer and raised his hand. Immediately the hall fell silent. “Alright, pair up and then we will give you some basic instructions,” he said, and Harry could not deny how powerful he looked. He had always known that Malfoy was born to boss people around.
“Actually, I'd like you to stay,” professor McGonagall stopped him, “I trust you two won’t kill each other.” Now she looked unsure, which almost made Harry laugh. They really had been terrible to each other.
“How was it?” Draco asked gently, putting a hand on his arm.
“I know, so try not to die and leave me alone with him.” He put his hand over Harry’s and smiled at him.
“Better him than Goyle I guess. Or Pansy. At least Malfoy never tried to turn you in to Voldemort.”
“They won’t mind,” he cut him off before he could spiral once more.
“If that’s what you want," he said, not wanting to push him too much, especially not in front of Ron and Hermione.
“What are you, an expert on love?”
“Of course, I will protect you. I always will.”
“Practically married then.” He got closer just to kiss his cheek. “In all seriousness, you don’t need to worry. Hermione is rather diplomatic, and I’ve already talked about you with Ron, he knows I really like you.”
“Can I have tea? I can’t sleep if I drink coffee too late,” Draco said, and for some reason Harry found him so adorable. There really was nothing purer than watching someone interact with their mother. No matter what, it was like they all went back in time to being a child, and even though they didn’t have the closest bond, it was like that for Draco too. He had another energy entirely around his mother, a bit childish at times but also extremely cute.
If the noise of Draco's knife hitting the floor was of any indication, he had understood what he meant with that.
“I know, I would never take it away from you.  Besides, you can you use it when you sleep here. Don’t think you will get away with checking the corridors just because it's you.”
That must have been the second most embarrassing conversation of his life, the first being telling Mr and Mrs Weasley that Ginny and him had broken up and then them finding out he was bisexual.
Maybe they could make it work.
Harry had wanted to tell him he wasn’t straight either, but for some reason he felt like keeping that information to himself a while longer. He trusted Malfoy, and he knew he had no reason to treat him any differently, but he was still scared that he might have found out about his feelings.
“Yeah, maybe I should. I know she would understand, but she was so happy at the idea, I don’t want to let her down.” He started toying with his cup, making Harry flinch every time he held it with one finger. Ron was a real mess when he was nervous, he could have dropped even the stickiest thing in the world.
“Very fucking relieved if I have to be honest. I want this kid and I want it with her, just not right now. I need to figure out something for my job first of all, I don’t want to be gone for weeks at a time and leave her alone, pregnant or with an infant, I just need time to think things through.”
“It looks fancy.” He looked excited, like it was a place he actually wanted to be in, so Harry counted that as a small win. He knew Draco wasn’t the same boy he had been in school, but he was still posh and spoilt and so picky, he really did not want to mess it up. “Good choice.”
“How were they killed?” he was curious, sue him. It was his job, after all.
“And you, that was a given, my love.”
“Draco Malfoy saving me from little kids, who would have thought.”
“Me too.”
“We don’t know for sure. What we do know is that the forest is more dangerous than ever, and kids still manage to go there. We were hoping you could scare them a bit and then teach them something if they still decide to break the rules. There is only so much we can do to stop them.”
“I’d rather not, if that’s okay.”
Their little back and forth got interrupted by their waiter bringing them their appetisers.
“Thank you, Harry.”
“Okay.” He started walking immediately, keeping his wand close and still very attentive.
“Everyone, lunch is ready,” Molly shouted, and all of a sudden people were running from the other rooms and the kitchen was so noisy he could barely hear anything.
“Shut up, you like it when I’m a sap.” He started pushing him, and soon enough they were just play fighting like little kids.
“I’ve said them and they never got printed, so I don’t think they liked it too much.”
“Really?” He looked so scared Harry almost got up to hug him, instead he settled on reaching out and putting his hand on his arm in a reassuring way.
“Well, I had a part of Voldemort inside of me, when I died and that part disappeared, I lost the ability to talk with snakes.” He noticed Malfoy shuddering at the mention of Voldemort, but he didn't point it out. He knew Malfoy had done what he had to in order to protect his family, he remembered very vividly what he had looked like in sixth year, how scared he was, how much weight he had lost and how little sleep he was getting. Sure, Malfoy wasn't the best person in the world, he had done some very horrible things even before that, but Harry knew that what he had done in sixth year wasn’t his doing.
“Deep breaths, slow and steady.” He reached out again, and because neither of them were part of the memory, he actually managed to touch him and grab his hand. “Come.”
