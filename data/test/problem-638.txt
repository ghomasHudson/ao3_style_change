Harry fidgeted with the long sleeves of his shirt. "You think?"
That got Draco’s attention but he tried to pretend it didn’t. “I don’t actually-”
Dinner was a torturously slow affair. Harry couldn’t stop fidgeting in his seat, impatient to tell someone what they knew. He hoped that it would be enough. After dinner when students were streaming out of the great hall he and Ron tried to get around them to speak to their Headmaster but Dumbledore disappeared  into the throng of students.
Throughout the whole recounting Black snarled for him to hurry up with the story.
“Oh, stop it Harry.” Pansy tossed a throw pillow in his direction. “He’s worried and honestly rightfully so. If you truly didn’t enter your name-”
“Exchange a clothing item with the player on your right.”
“Oh, Harry, it’s not that simple. It might be alright for a little while, but what about when we break up? It’ll completely ruin the group of us. It’d be so terribly awkward!” She sobbed, tears falling.
From there things only got worse. For starters his Anti-Dementor lessons weren’t going half as well as he’d hoped they’d be going at this point. All he could produce was a vague shapeless silver shadow that was too feeble to drive the Dementor away. The first time had been the worst, having to listen to the sounds of his parents distressed last words.
"You first Draco, wait for us on the other side," his mother told him, laying a gentle hand on his shoulder. He observed his parents, gone was the look of shock, replaced by steady calculation. Nodding, he followed his mothers instructions and leaned into his trolley.
Harry opened his eyes and made eye contact with Pansy. He knew without having to ask that Draco had also come out to her. It wasn’t their place to say anything though.
“Maybe so.” He could tell she was unconvinced, that she knew he was just trying to convince himself. “Maybe not. Either way, I am with you, no matter what.”
“Why not give us a house tour?” said Blaise.
“What are you talking about?” Ron demanded from the bed he was keeled over. His leg was bent at an awful angle. He held a writhing Scabbers in his hands.
When Timothy and Gabriel, the last of Harry’s teammates, left the change room Draco caught the door as it was closing and slipped through, impatient with waiting.
“You done?”
“Is it from… did you get it for me?” Harry felt quite speechless as he tore away the brown paper to reveal the latest and highly coveted magical items in Hogwarts, a Nimbus 2000. “Draco, you didn’t?’
“I’m so ready for dinner. My stomach is making weird noises I’m so hungry,” Theo whined.
Narcissa stared down at the eleven year old boy, with his ridiculous round glasses and whirlwind shock black hair. “Oh, Harry, you’re welcome at the manor anytime, alright?” She pulled him in for another hug. “See you boys!”
“What?”
He squeezed his eyes shut and gripped the arm of the chair so hard his knuckles went white. “I swear Potter if you say cool one more time.”
“Because I’m actually the one who’s gay?”
“Ethan isn’t actually gay. I made that up to see how you’d react.,” Draco confessed.
Harry felt Draco’s fingers stroke gently through his hair. He shifted his gaze, without moving his head, from the veil to Draco’s face. “Of course it hurts. It will for a long time, love.”
“Nice try, Theodore, I fucking saw that!” Pansy waved her croquet stick at him.
As he pulled out the scarf a flurry of parchment came with it. Harry knelt and meant to shove the parchment back but the writing on it wasn’t Draco’s familiar neat cursive and it made him pause. He glanced over the parchment and quickly realized it was a letter. From Griffin Clemonte. His smile fell and his face hardened as he read it.
“Eh, I mean it was mutual so it’s not really a big deal.” Theo shrugged and took out a plastic bag from his leather side bag that he carted around everywhere. “Just neither of us were really feeling it anymore.”
He waved his hand in a dismissive gesture. “Don’t be sorry. I know you see me as an annoying git who you nag about not getting high but I’m always here for you, Pans.” He chuckled and Pansy’s cheeks warmed. “I know that sounds kinda cheesy but I’ve known you for what feels like forever and I want you to be happy. “ He peered at her from under his eyelashes, bashfully.
“Nice losing to you.”
“Dare.”
Today’s quidditch match had been the most intense one Harry had ever played. Gryffindor and Slytherin had been neck in neck the entire time. There’d been a world’s worth of weight on his shoulders to catch the snitch and win the game for slytherin. His teammates were counting on him, he couldn’t let them down. Adrenaline had surged through Harry when he’d felt his fingers slip around and clasp the snitch. Relief had swept through him and he hadn’t been able to stop smiling. He knew he must have looked mad.
“It’s impossible to miss,” grumbled Draco.
Surprise came over Harry’s face. “Woah, where’s this coming from?”
“Why’s Theo so happy all of a sudden?” Blaise inquired suspiciously.
“That good?” Harry grinned.
“Wait, who?” Blaise demanded.
Draco chuckled. “I know what I’m getting you for Christmas this year.”
Then, echoing through the corridors came Professor McGonagall’s voice, magically magnified.
“-a student has been taken by the beast,” McGonagall was saying. Harry’s blood ran cold.
Harry chuckled. “Of course you’ve read ahead.”
“What’s wrong?” Pansy leaned back and pulled her hands away and stared and his tear stained face.
“But you’re going?” Draco argued.
Draco winced. “They wanted me to come with them. You too.”
“I’m not glaring.” Harry turned his eyes down to his mashed potatoes and angrily shoved a forkful into his mouth.
“That’s kind of extreme, Harry.” Pansy frowned and curled her legs beneath her.
“How’d he do it?” Harry asked.
“You look dashing. Your hair is still it’s usual birds nest though,” Pansy said laughing, running her hands through it.
A loud groan came from Theo’s bed, signalling his conscious state. The boy shoved back his hangings and stumbled to the bathroom. The sound of urine hitting the water could be heard as Theo had so thoughtfully left the bathroom door open.
Pansy walked into the infirmary, letting the doors fall closed behind her. She spotted Harry, Draco and Ron immediately. They were the only patients sitting up and moving. The rest of them were stone still, petrified.
“Come ooooon!” Theo whined, leaning forward in his seat.
"How the bloody hell did you manage to convince a couple sth years to loan you their broom."
“Thank you, Draco. Really.”
“What, like sex?”
“So?”
“Apologies Miss Parkinson. Dobby didn’t mean to frighten you. Hello to you too Young Mister Draco Malfoy, Mister Harry Potter.” The house elf waved enthusiastically.
Pansy had known it would happen for some time, that didn’t make it any easier.
“Maybe a Beauxbatons girl?”
Theo scowled. “Dare.”
It was a long time before Harry fell asleep that night. There was something so calming about falling asleep next to Draco. The other boy seemed so vulnerable and Harry found himself reveling in his ability to watch the other boy, cheek pressed to the pillow, mouth parted ever so slightly as he slept. That night when he slept he dreamed of doing the exact same thing, falling asleep and waking up in the same bed as Draco, but based on the appearance of the two of them, it was some many decades in the future.
“Maybe.” Not likely.
i think i prefer writing longer chapters less frequently though (they feel more satisfying to post) hope y'all don't mind. i have most of the rest of this story mapped out and i'm super excited for what's to come! enjoy
“I can’t believe I passed Divination,” Blaise said, following. “I barely did the homework for that class it was utter rubbish.”
Draco’s seemed to relax a little. Merlin, he really needed to get a grip.
“It’s alright,” Pansy said in a soothing voice, resting a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “Madam Hooch is coming now.” Sure enough when Draco glanced up Madam Hooch was standing over them. She knelt down next to Harry, across from Draco.
Harry stood there a few moments longer before chasing after his best friend.
“You’re a genius, Granger,” Pansy admitted. “You might really be the brightest witch of our age like they say.”
"I was a baby." He felt like Harry was looking for an excuse. Or perhaps not an excuse but answers.
Harry and Draco shared an amused look. Both of them thought Blaise’s crush on Pansy was obvious but Pansy denied it.
Pansy skipped back to the bed and rejoined them. “Do you think thirteen is too young to take shots.”
“If you tell anyone else I’ll skin you alive,” Draco threatened him.
“Real mature, Malfoy.”
“Oh get down off your high horse you big wuss. It’s not like I have you shucking corn or peeling potatoes. Your only stirring soup in a pot and making cheese plates.”
“Forget Lavender,” Blaise snorted. “Mandy is way more attractive and less annoying.”
What made him even more upset was that Pansy and Draco agreed! They all thought it was sent from Sirius Black as an attempt to jinx or hex him. To be fair it was probably the only half logical explanation as to where the broom came from but that didn’t mean Harry couldn’t be upset.
Harry scoffed, faking disdain, “We were too! What gave us away!”
“No, I guess not. I don’t like change. I think that’s what I like least about this. It makes sense why they’re splitting up. They argued all the time, couldn’t spend any time in the same room together without getting into a nasty fight.”
“Isn’t he in fifth year?”
“I’ll pay you back-”
“Are you serious?! They’re ridiculous.”
Harry breathed a little easier when he was by himself in the dormitory getting ready for bed. He ran a hand through his hair and cringed because he thought it felt a little greasy. Figuring he’d probably better take a shower he grabbed a fresh pair of boxers and headed to the bathroom. Just as he was reaching to open the door, it opened itself and he leapt in surprise.
That name made Harry’s insides roil unpleasantly. He reasoned with himself that he wasn’t being fair. Claudette was a perfectly nice girl. He still couldn’t figure out why just the mention of her made him upset. “Come again?”
Theo happily took off his striped orange, red and turquoise jumper and pulled on Blaise’s dark one. “I feel so broody now.”
“Don’t act like you’ve never smoked a joint before,” Harry teased.
“What about throwing yourself down a mountain could be fun? It sounds more dangerous than anything. You know I’ve heard a lot of muggles have died skiiboarding.”
“It isn’t?”
“Grow up-” Draco stopped talking the moment they entered the sitting room and saw that there were guests. Plural. There were multiple strangers.
A cool breeze swept over the grounds and Pansy used the hand she wasn’t using to hold her croquet racket to hold onto her wide brimmed beige hat so it didn’t blow off. It was a humid day and Draco was thankful for the breeze that blew through his loose clothes and gave him a brief relief from the heat. There was something different about this wind though. It smelled like fall.
Pansy startled and looked up from the letter, her head whipping around. Theodore was leaning on the back of the chair, his chin propped on his folded arms. Hurriedly she shoved her parents letters out of sight. To look at him she had to twist around in her chair.
“No, Hermione, listen to me. Please, calm down!” Lupin shouted.
Around what was probably an hour later the common room was mostly empty. Pansy had thrown her legs over Harry's. He had protested at first but she had won in the end.
“You can’t go back to bed here, I’m not letting you sleep in these sheets. Come on,” Draco said to Harry, turning to leave the room. Too tired to argue, Harry followed, wearily. His eyes itched he was so sleep deprived.
"Why, not good enough in bed?"
“You aren’t? But you were the person he retrieved in the second ask? From the lake?”
Harry sat back down beside Draco, heavily. He took a deep breath in, trying to hold it together, breathed out. He looked up at Draco miserably. “You should have gone with them.”
“Draco?” The throatiness of Harry’s morning voice sent delicious shivers up his spine.
“You know,” Pansy said, sighing as she lay down beside Harry. “You and Draco, I don’t know what I’d do without you.”
“Apparently so.”
Pansy pulled down the sleeves of her sweater and plastered on an unconvincing smile. “What’d’ya mean?”
Harry bit his lower lip. "Yeah."
Harry had developed a habit of taking his cloak of invisibility and the Marauders Map for a stroll down the corridors when he couldn’t sleep at night, a habit he was aware drove Draco insane. That night he went out just for that reason.
“Yep.”
Draco laughed. “Yes, that. How ridiculous.”
"Would you like to?" Draco offered. Harry's eyes left the rolling fields and turned to him. He nodded. "There are four of them. Four houses. In your first year you get sorted. You stay in that house for your seven years of schooling. In a way your house is like your team. You can win and lose points, you're tight with them, it's where you make all your closest friends." Draco knew he was rambling, probably not making much sense, the way Harry's piercing green eyes watched him made him nervous. "But anyway, the four houses, they all stand for certain values-"
Draco
“Sorry, you are?” she batted her eyelashes up at him.
“You think the beast is a Basalisk because of the spiders?”
They’d gone on to tell Harry about how they’d acquired it years back from Filch’s office then blown Harry’s mind, showing him how to get the map to reveal all of Hogwarts, secret passageways and all (“I solemnly swear that I am up to no good!” “See that there Harry? That’s a passageway that’ll get you right into Hogsmeade.” “Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs. We owe them so much.” “Make sure you wipe it when you’re done” “Or else anyone can read it.” “Just tap it again and say ‘Mischief managed’.”)
There were more attacks. Nearly headless Nick, a Hogwarts ghost, and a student, Justin Finch-Fletchley, the boy who’d cried out at Harry in the great hall when the whole of Hogwarts had realised that Harry was a Parselmouth.
“You look good,” Harry complimented.
“The day Draco isn’t unnecessarily extra will be the day I kiss Blaise’s arse.”
Blaise makes a gagging noise. “Gross. You look like a bloody Hufflepuff.”
“Draco, what if they don’t like me?”
Draco wrinkled his nose. “But then it’ll be sweaty and gross.”
“Yeah, they were extra. You’re extra. It made sense.” Harry shrugged, he knew he was instigating now but couldn’t help himself.
He liked Draco. He, Harry James Potter, liked Draco. Draco Malfoy. He groaned loudly. This could only end in disaster. He tried to think of something, anything else. However, his brain was noncompliant.
Draco and Griffin left the room together and Harry shoved down the ugly feelings rising up in his chest. There was no reason to be feeling this way.
“No, no! Pansy doesn’t count!” Theo protested as he opened a chocolate frog.
“Where’s he going?” His mother asked, following him.
Getting an idea Draco swiped Harry's glasses off his face and shoved them up his own nose. "Shut up, Malfoy," he mimicked.
“It’s pretty much a dragon,” Ron said, looking down at the illustration in the book of the Basalisk.
The other boy gave him an impatient look. Harry loved how easy it was to rile him up. “Especially not those ones. Please tell me your joking?”
“Well then I remembered something else. After every attack, at the place it occurred, there have been spiders fleeing the scene. It’s been the same every time. So I checked the books again and look what I found.” Hermione dug into her bag and pulled out a book. She flipped through the pages until she found the one she was looking for then turned it around for them to read.
Harry stood up and covered his face with his hands. His heart pounded against his chest, so hard. His thoughts were reeling.
“It’s hot.”
Harry gave Dobby a pressed lip smile. “Thanks Dobby.”
This isn’t a phase, though I have in the past wished that it was. I used to beg any higher power, if there was one, to be straight. Merlin knows my life would be a much easier one if I could choose to like girls. I’ve tried to ignore this part of me, hoping that with time maybe it would go away. However, it has not. And with this time a different outcome has come about. I used to be revolted by this part of me. Before that I was in denial that it was even true. With time though I have accepted it. I will not creep around in shame. I will not be weighed down by guilt about a part of me that I cannot change or control.
Harry was torn between wanting to understand what Draco was saying and wanting to cover his ears and storm away like a child. Merlin, he needed to grow up. But when Draco and the two girls continued to talk in french like Harry wasn’t even there he got impatient.
“Is Ginny alright?” asked Harry.
Harry had a feeling then that this year was going to be quite the difficult one, Dark Lord rising to power aside.
“Pardon?” His breathing was shallow, was Griffin getting closer? He couldn’t remember ever being this close to another person's face.
Harry was about to open his mouth to say he was probably just staying at Hogwarts when Draco, without looking up from his paper, answered for him. "He's coming home to the Manor with me."
Draco side eyed him. “Fine, I’ll refrain. Only because I quite like you with your skin.”
“Yes, well, apparently my dad left it in his possession before his death. According to Dumbledore my dad used to use it around Hogwarts when he went here for things like sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food.” They all got a laugh out of that.
Just then Theo made his entrance. “Ah, you must be the lovely Mrs Clemonte I’ve heard so much about!”
Your mother and I have been together for a long time. When I first met her we were young and infatuated. Unfortunately infatuation isn’t enough to make a marriage last. But we had you, so we’ve been trying to make this work for years. It’s been harder since you left for Hogwarts. You know how your mother is, she’s crazy. I’ll never understand that woman or her logic. She’s so bossy I just couldn’t stand her anymore.
“You found it?” The other boy stared up at him in disbelief with wide eyes. “Let’s tell the Dumbledore.”
“Malfoy isn’t it?” Lockart asked. “Malfoy, surely, as a teacher at Hogwarts you’d trust me to assist-”
“You said yourself that petrification is dark magic.”
Draco beamed and held out his hand. "So it's decided then. From Slytherin, together, we'll rise to greatness. Friends?"
“Wings?”
Pansy grimaced and gave him an apologetic look. “I realize now I should have phrased that a little differently perhaps.”
“Are you two bickering again?” Pansy asked, with a sigh.
“Ew, I don’t know!”
“He’s your best friend and you’ve developed feelings for him. You’re afraid he won’t feel the same way towards you. Or worse, that he won’t want to even be friends if you tell him.”
Harry thought he might be sick as the fat little man groveled at Black and Lupin’s feet. He began to shake when Pettigrew approached him and his friends, trying to win their sympathy. He was disgusted and almost didn’t stop Black when  he stepped forward to kill Pettigrew. But he did, and he told them they could take the shrivelled excuse of a man to the Dementors to receive the kiss, have his soul sucked from his body.
The train released a warning whistle and they hurried their goodbyes with his mother (“See you boys at christmas!”) to board the train and get a compartment. The only one that was empty enough to fit them all was the one with Theodore Nott, a Slytherin boy in their year, who was sprawled out on one of the seats, his legs up and back against the window wall.
Draco nodded and looked away, using Harry’s gift to him as an excuse to avoid eye contact. Butterflies gathered in harry’s stomach. What if Draco didn’t like what he’d gotten him? How could he possibly top the things Draco had gotten him? He honestly didn’t think it was possible. But then Draco was opening the gift and smiling up at him and the butterflies in Harry’s stomach doubled.
Draco blanched. “Well, yes-”
“Why does it make you jealous?”
Harry sat up and yawned. “Sure, mind if I shower first?’
"Oh yeah? I'd like to see how fun you are when you're blind."
“That makes Pansy the last person then,” Draco muttered under his breath.
“I’m not saying he isn’t..” Draco searched for the right word. “Talented. But something’s off about him. Trust me.”
“Never have I ever learned how to play a musical instrument,” said Harry. The rest of his friends took a shot. “All of you?”
“If I can’t ward off the Dementors I’m useless whenever they’re around.”
“Mind if we join you, Theodore?” Harry inquired.
"My name is Harry. Harry Potter."
“Why?” Theo asked, voicing what they were all wondering.
Harry was taken aback by that. He fumbled for words. “I am. Of course I am-”
“Shut up, Pansy.” Draco looked at Harry, suddenly looking very timid. “Well Potter, do you like it?”
"If you'd been listening you'd know."
“Fantasising?”
“You were probably in denial,” Pansy offered, shrugging. Of course she was right.
Wolf whistles followed this action and he went on for a good minute before he pulled away. Draco was staring at him like he’d lost his mind and that made him laugh.
“Let me know how they turn out.”
“Trouble in paradise?” Harry said.
They both leapt from their chairs, letting the blankets they’d had wrapped around them fall to the snow covered balcony. Snow flew. Sometime later, Draco pushed himself up off the ground, where he’d collapsed exhausted. “I’m going to go make some hot chocolate. Want some?”
“‘Just a bunch of plants’ my ass, Malfoy,” Harry said, looking around at the stone statues. His friends laughed like prepubescent children at the naked men and women. Oohing and ahhing at the stone animals of all sorts. Snakes, peacocks and even goats.
“Because you’re the obvious and easy answer.” Pansy seemed slightly skeptical but overall satisfied with that answer and went back to flipping through her Witches Weekly.
“There he is,” Draco said, having just spotted him. Harry was standing alone on the platform with his trolley loaded with Hedwig and his trunk. Draco watched as Pansy ran and tackled `their friend. Harry stumbled and nearly toppled over but somehow managed to stay upright. He hugged Pansy back.
"You know him?" Pansy turned to the boys behind her. "Well why didn't you say so?" Neither of them answered her. She turned back to Harry and Draco. The latter introduced himself.
Harry let Draco keep kissing him.
“Hmmph.”
Harry shook his head at the retreating figure of his best mate. “He’s gone batty.”
“You’re all nasty.” Blaise mimed vomiting. “Anyway, I wouldn’t recommend getting with her. I’d say the only one with any hope is Harry.”
“Truth or dare?” Harry persisted, rolling his eyes.
“I guess so.” When Draco didn’t answer and refused to look at him, staring downward, Harry huffed. “Why are you mad at me?’
Harry yawned wide. "Joy."
“Theodore, you know we aren’t allowed snakes!” Pansy hissed. “Cats, owls rats and toads. That’s it.” She shuddered. “Though I don’t see why you’d want either of the last two. That red headed boy from Gryffindor, the Weasley’s got a rat and Neville’s got a toad. They’re both hideous. The pets and their owners.” Pansy shook her head. “Anyway, the point is, snakes aren’t allowed.”
“Alright, well I’ll see you around, Potter,” Diggory said waving. Stupid smile. Stupid hair. Draco had better hair than that didn’t he?
It was weird not having him there to talk to, sitting beside other people in class and panicking every time they so much as made eye contact.
“I’m gay,” said Draco, bluntly. “Though, rethinking it, I’d probably kiss Pansy before I’d kiss your nasty lips, Nott. You probably have herpes, or worse.”
Draco wheezed. He was genuinely having trouble breathing. Fuck, Harry with eyeliner would be the death of him. His tombstone would read ‘Gay Panicked Too Hard’. He couldn’t stop staring at him. He wanted to. But he just couldn’t.
“It’s interesting because there’s something in common with all the attacks,” Hermione told Draco, Harry, Pansy and Ron. The five of them were sitting at a table in the library. They’d originally come together with the intention of studying for end of year exams, but like most conversations did these days it turned into one about the chamber of secrets and the attacks. “The petrifications. Now I did a bit of reading to try and figure out what the beast from the chamber of secrets could be. At first nothing made sense but then I realized something else about the attacks. No one has been killed yet. Mrs Norris saw the attacker’s reflection in the water on the floor. Collin saw the attacker through his camera. Sir Nick saw it directly, but as a ghost it’s not like he can die again and Justin saw the attacker through Nick, who was transparent, and therefore didn’t see it directly.”
"I know a bit."
“Bloody hell, mate,” Harry said, eyes wide as he gawked. “She’s something else.”
“Je pense que je pourrais t'aimer.” (I think I might/could love you)
“It’s dangerous.”
Draco looked up at him, cheeks pink from the whiskey in the eggnog. “What?”
Draco rubbed at his cheeks, his fingers came away red. “Oh.”
Narcissa had just finished removing her lightweight fur lined coat when she turned to face her son. “Calm down, I did darling.” From the folds of her robes she produced a corked bottle. “You can ingest it or spread it on the area but according to the witch I bought it from doing both will result in a more rapid healing.”
“Perhaps he managed to take a picture of his attacker,” suggested McGonagall. Creevey. That annoying slime ball of a kid who’d been annoying Harry all year trying to take his photo. Who else had a camera at Hogwarts?
“See you!” Harry turned to face Draco as they made their way to charms. “Hey, what’s new and interesting?”
He knew people were watching, knew his friends were probably staring at him as he fell apart, but couldn’t find it in himself to care enough to pull himself together.
Turned out he’d bought them all a bottle of their favourite liquor. Scotch for Draco, Whiskey for Blaise, Tequila for Harry and Krupnik (a polish honey vodka) for each of them.
"Anytime Potter." A small smirk tipped up the corner of Draco's mouth. "And you should be."
“Is there anything you’re excited to get?” Harry asked him when they were almost done and Draco still hadn’t shown a sliver of happiness about a single gift.
Harry wanted nothing more than to stay in bed, buried in the sheets. His bladder and gurgling stomach however wouldn’t allow that. He thought that maybe after breakfast he could get away without any of his friends noticing. This turned out to be wishful thinking as Pansy convinced them all to play cards in the living room, sitting on the floor around a wooden coffee table. Harry wasn’t really in the mood but he couldn’t get away from them without having to answer a number of questions he wouldn’t be able to lie well enough to be convincing.
The silence was thick.
It was him, the boy from the robe shop. Draco could see behind his mothers soft smile and caring words, he could see her panic. Draco glanced at his father and saw the panic in his eyes as well. He kept his mouth shut, not wanting to disturb his parents train of thought as they steered their trolleys through the thick gaggle of muggles who parted for the group, backing away from the other boys hooting snow white owl.
Blaise wolf whistled. “Get it, Potter. Didn’t know if you had it in you.”
“What does this mean?” Pomfrey asked.
"Sure, you're not," she said, smirking, as she twirled her quill in her fingers.
Rolling his eyes Draco started back up the stairs. “Let’s go, Potter. I bought you a souvenir on our trip.” Grabbing Hedwig’s cage and his trunk, Harry hauled them up the stairs after Draco.
Harry raised a brow. "Since when was intellectual conversationalist a requirement for you?"
“Moving on?” Blaise said, scowling at her.
Draco reached across him, holding an unfamiliar dish. “Voici. désolé, il n'essaie pas de paraître impoli. C'est seulement qu'il n'a jamais entendu parler de Bouillabaisse.” (here you go. sorry, he is not trying to come off as rude. It is only that he has never heard of Bouillabaisse)
Pansy took a shaky breath. Without giving herself time to digest she opened her father’s letter. It was significantly more negative and passive aggressive.
“What’s on your mind, Draco?” she asked in french. That was one of the nice things he enjoyed about hanging out with Claudette, getting to practice his french.
“Pansy, I-I think I like Draco.”
“Shut up, Theodore.” Pansy rolled her eyes at all their faces. “Unfold the shirts.”
After their end of year incident Harry, Draco and Pansy had grown closer with one another than ever. There are some things you do that just strengthen friendships and it can’t be helped.
“My mother and father will expect me to make some rounds and talk to people since we’re hosting but if you want I can do it fast and then excuse myself and we could, I don’t know, play some wizards chest?”
The group took their seats around him, doing their best not to disturb him.
Harry looked over to Draco who smiled. "That's the plan." Crabbe and Goyle nodded as well.
After the last month and a half of writing letters back and forth, Harry and Draco were back to normal. Things had been tense between them for awhile, even after defeating Voldemort/Tom Riddle together at the end of second year, because of their difference in opinion when it came to the importance of a witch or wizards blood status. Harry knew that Draco had been brought up his whole childhood being taught that witches and wizards with a pure magical bloodline were superior to those with muggle blood mixed into their lineage. Harry had also learned over the last two years of being best friends with the boy that Draco was a proud individual who had a hard time admitting that he was wrong. That was why Harry had believed Draco when he’d written to Harry acknowledging and apologizing for his close mindedness.
“A real one. Those are really rare.” Harry supposed Draco would know best on a matter such as this.
“You’re one of their best friends. They’d never turn their backs on you.” Draco wasn’t so certain. “You didn’t think I would, did you?” Draco could only shrug. How could he explain how terrified he’d been or how scared he was still. “Will you tell Harry?” She asked.
“Oh, do you now?” Harry cackled, he loved getting Draco riled up like this. It was great fun.
“Then what’s the problem?
"Don't forget to tell your aunt we say hello-"
“I’ll see you later,” he muttered to Draco before walking, definitely not storming, away.
Rushing up to them Harry was out of breath when he reached the small group. "Pardon me but could you show me to platform 9 and 3/4?"
Harry threw his arm around his mate. “Indeed, Blaise, as the way of love commands.”
Pansy swore colourfully. "That's tomorrow?"
“That was grumbly. No way was that a term of endearment!” Harry exclaimed, as always, completely oblivious.
Harry felt a blush rise to his cheeks, looking up at Draco he shrugged. “Well maybe not directly but if they figured it out themselves or asked us…”
Harry made a show of draping the cloak around his shoulders. It wasn’t a particularly impressive thing compared to the silver and green cloak Draco had told Harry he could keep which is why he was puzzled by Draco’s reaction. The boy sat up fast, mouth hanging open. “What the bloody hell! That’s an invisibility cloak!”
“Well you don’t have to be a prat about it,” Theo said as he made perhaps his worst move yet.
“Yeah. Why not give me a pair of your fancy silk pyjamas?” Harry joked.
They’d found it. Harry stared engraving of the snake in the girls bathroom on the second floor. He had to tell someone. He raced to go find Ron but students were streaming through the halls. What was going on? Then he realised it was dinner time. Going with the flow of students he walked into the great hall and spotted Ron immediately, not that it was hard with his shock of red hair. Walking as fast as he thought he could without being suspicious Harry went to Ron.
Feeling his stomach drop to his feet, Harry turns to Mrs Malfoy. “Yeah?”
“I also know they love you more than anything else in the world,” she argued.
“Not now-”
“Thanks.”
“Well then you’ll be pleasantly shocked.” Theo wiggled his brows.
His hand slid up to cup Griffin’s cheek and he’d never imagined kissing another boy would feel this good. It was a little messy, he had no idea what he was doing, but he couldn’t have been that bad because Griffin was making these little noises that encouraged Draco to continue what he was doing. When one of Griffin’s hands slide under his shirt and stroked his hip Draco sucked in a short breath and felt goosebumps rise all along his skin.
"I don't actually care." She waved her hand at him, dismissively. "Are you going to listen to me?"
“Stop yelling-”
Draco just shrugged and went back to looking over the balcony railing. I don’t think so, Harry thought. Scooping a handful of snow over the arm of the chair on his other side, so Draco wouldn’t see, he packed it tight before hurling it at the other boy.
“I think my parents are getting a divorce.” Her voice was all nasally from the snot clogging her nose and Harry just wanted to help but he felt so useless and didn’t know how. He leaned back to give her some breathing room.
Harry didn’t want to but when Draco was putting on that voice and looking at him that way he couldn’t help but blush. “You’re ridiculous.”
“It could take us ages to find though,” Hermione argued. “Who knows how many attacks there will have been by then.”
“Your not gonna sleep with Pansy?”
“Everyone else is seeing the idiocy behind all this right?” Blaise asked, coming up beside Harry and Draco.
Okay, so maybe he also needed to figure out who he was going to take to the Ball but the hiss of disapproval that came from Draco’s four poster bed about it being an ungodly hour and that he should go back to bed was incredibly satisfying. He wasn’t sure why he felt the need to get back at Draco, he hadn’t done anything. Harry supposed, as he wandered with his wand out, lighting the way as he wandered down the halls, that he’d figured that if he didn’t have a date to the ball..and if Draco hadn’t had a date..they could have gone together- as friends of course. But now Draco had a date so Harry would look like a  lazy sod if he didn’t have one too.
“Our house elf.”
“You gonna tell a truth or do a dare, Pans?” Blaise asked.
Draco let his head fall back down against the bed. “Pomfrey needs to check your head, Potter. You definitely hit it. There are no voices in the walls.” All of a sudden Harry was vaulting back into the bed over Draco’s head. “Wha?”
The reason behind the quick switch in Theo’s attitude became evident later on when it became clear that Pansy’s argument with Adam had not been ‘Nothing’. Adam didn’t have dinner that evening or breakfast the next morning with them. Adam seemed to have departed Parkinson manor.
“Do you hear what  you’re saying at all?” Draco demanded, his anger rising up. “It would not be cool. Everyone probably thinks it was Harry who’s been petrified Mrs Norris and Creevey.”
“Merry Christmas,” Harry yawned as he leaned over to the side table and put his glasses on.
“Dunno,” said Harry. “ It’s probably something else that’s bothering him. I’ll go talk to him.” He pushed up from the sofa, meaning to follow after his friend.
“Oh quit your moaning and just open the damn gifts, Parkinson.”
“Force him to show his true self.”
“Maybe for you. Great fun for the rest of us.” Draco’s tone turned thoughtful. “Say, I can ask Claudette if she’s got any friends you could ask?”
Harry pulled his books to his chest tightly, a wave of disorientation passing through him. “What? That random girl from a few days ago?”
“I’m not daft, Draco,” Harry snapped, bitterly, standing up and pacing. “The letter is pretty self explanatory. It’s a love letter. Clemonte goes on and on about how much that evening in the library, when he stuck his tongue down your throat, meant to him. I’d kind of caught onto the gist of it when he compared your hair to winter fire and your skin to fine porcelain. I especially liked that part when he said your lips are as pink as the petals that will bloom on the cherry blossom trees next spring and even softer to kiss-”
“Um- I don’t know-”
“Now that you know what to do, it's time for you to actually execute the transfiguration. Please get into groups to share owls.”
“You do know only powerful witches and wizards can produce a full corporeal patronus, right?” Draco told him. “Stop being so hard on yourself. Any success at all is monumental.”
“Violin.”
“Can we go back in now?” Draco grumbled from a few feet behind him.
“Oh yeah.” Harry dug around in both his pockets. “Shit. I must have left them in my room, hold on, it’ll only take a minut-”
“Lick the bottom of Theo’s foot.”
“Yes, of course, come in Potter. Shut the door behind you.” Draco stood in front of his mirror and finished with putting the gel in his hair.
The question they were all wondering was answered as they packed their trunks for Hogwarts into a red Bentley that would take them to platform nine and three quarters.
“Why not?” Pansy demanded. “How could Dumbledore be alright with Harry staying with his Aunt and Uncle but not be okay with Harry spending the summer with you?”
Harry would look back and wonder whether the map had actually done him any good that day. Hogsmeade had been wonderful at first, more magical than his friends had described, but he’d also learned a haunting truth. He’d been hiding under the cloak of invisibility in the Three Broomsticks, talking with Draco, Pansy, Blaise and Theodore when he’d overheard a conversation among Professor McGonagall, Hagrid, Professor Flitwick, Madam Rosmerta and the Minister of Magic. Without knowing he was there they’d discussed something dreadful, that Sirius Black had been his father’s best friend, that the man who was apparently his godfather had also been undercover for Lord Voldemort and been the one to betray his parents.
The morning of Christmas Harry’s eyes nearly bulged out of his skull at the sight of the living room closest to the bedrooms. There were presents stacked and covering nearly every surface.
"Sixth years actually. To be honest I just asked."
Fourth Year
“Snape is the biggest git in the whole bloody world. I’m going to strangle,” said Harry.
“Dumbledore?!”
“Harry, don’t,” she said, standing and throwing her magazine down. “Let me talk to him.” Something about the tone of Pansy’s voice made Harry still.
“Bye, guys! See you next year, Pansy!” Blaise calls to them as he passes.
“I don’t know, Potter, maybe because she’s your girlfriend?”
“I dare you to let me do your makeup,” she smirked.
“Of course I can. I’ll send him an owl this afternoon- Theo what the fuck is that?” Draco demanded. Peeking out the top of Theo’s robe sleeve was the head of a snake.
Draco buried his face in his hands again. He didn’t want to have to think about, let alone face or deal with any of this. “How could I? They’ll be weirded out by it, Pans,” he said, voice pained.
Harry was incredibly touched by Draco’s offer but worried that the Malfoy’s wouldn’t appreciate him stealing their son for the evening with so many important witches and wizards around. He shook his head. “That’s alright. Let’s go back down. I was just taken back.”
As they all took their seats Draco felt his stomach swoop when Griffin sat across from him.
Harry had never spent much time in the library at the manor but he remembered Draco showing it to him a couple years ago and sometimes he’d go with Draco to fetch another book he wanted to read. When he got there the door was open a couple inches. He pushed it open the rest of the way but saw nothing. Harry was about to start searching the first floor when he heard a faint thump from up above. When he started up the stairs and began to hear other sounds. Sounds he recognized and that filled him with a looming sense of dread but he had to see for himself.
Draco snorted. “Just wait.”
“Because the boy you’ve been dating just came out to you?”
Draco raised his eyebrows and took off his sweater, there was a white T-shirt on underneath. Pansy protested but Draco had technically accomplished the dare and they moved on.
She cupped his face in her hands, pushing his hair out of his eyes. “Don’t be sorry, silly! Why would you be sorry?”
Once it was just him and Pansy he asked the question that had been nagging him at the back of his mind all night. "So what was up with Draco? Why was he acting so weird, he seemed a bit better at the end there but still."
Pansy picked up the nail glue and applied it to the first nail. Doing her best to keep up a cool front she reached out for Theodores right hand. It was warm and smooth, exempting the calluses on his palm. She held her breath as she stuck the fake nail to his real one.
“I’ve never had anything like that,” said Harry.
The second he made it to is room he slid down to the floor, back against the door. He buried his hands in his arms crossed over his knees.
“Thank you,” she kissed him and hurried off so she wouldn’t be late.
"She has dirty blood. Her parents aren't magic," Draco explained to him.
“No. This isn’t our vacation home.”
“Friends with a Malfoy?” Black croaked, lip curled when his eyes landed on Draco, who Harry had moved to protect with his body as the tall, dark haired, gaunt man had stepped out of his hug with Lupin and toward the five of them. “I don’t think James would have wanted that.”
"My Aunt and Uncle."
“Do you not have winter boots?’
“Doesn’t make this any easier though.”
“What?”
Draco couldn’t figure out what Harry was avoiding him for. What did he have to be upset about? Was he actually homophobic? He’d said he didn’t care that Draco was gay but that didn’t seem to be true. Draco had thought their friendship was stronger than that, surely this couldn’t be the end for them.
“And you’re a bore.” There was a small crowd starting to gather and Harry’s gut started to roil. This was going to get really ugly really fast.
“What’s got his knickers in a twist?” Blaise wondered aloud, eyebrows raised.
"Dumbledore sent-"
“What’s up with you?” Harry asked gently, sitting facing his boyfriend.
Harry laughed to himself.
“Hey, Pans?”
“Goodnight Harry.”
“Just be grateful it wasn’t you.”
“Have you replaced Draco with Weasley?” When Harry didn’t answer she tried a different approach. “You’re going to have to forgive him at some point,” Pansy sighed, slouching into a plush sofa by the fire. It was late and there was no one else in the common room.
“The what now?” asked Harry. The girl asking was obviously from Beauxbatons. Her french accent was thick and he’d never once in his life heard of the dish she’d asked him to pass.
Harry said nothing, just kept his eyes closed.
“You’re awfully cocky tonight.”
Harry glanced down at the map to check that no teachers were up ahead and had a heart attack when he saw Filch’s name. Scrambling back the way he came, Harry pelted back to Slytherin common room. He was on his way back up to his dorm room when he heard a sniffle from one of the massive arm chairs by the fire. Figuring he could stay up a bit longer he took a peak.
They all sat in pensive silence, none of them wanting to voice the other possibility. The possibility that Voldemort might get to him. Harry couldn’t meet the eyes of his friends. His insides were churning as he thought about his meetings with Dumbledore. They’d started in the fall, few and far apart. However, as the year had progressed they’d become more constant. Excuses had been hard to find. There were only so many detentions from McGonagall he could pretend to get, only so many extra Quidditch meetings he could make up. The things they’d been talking about, he and the old school master haunted his waking thoughts. The dark past of Tom Riddle and his transition into the Dark Lord he was today. His mind was awake and spinning all the time now. Full with thoughts about Horcruxes. He would have to tell his friends eventually. He would have to go after them. He and Dumbledore. Wouldn’t they? The old man hadn’t actually told him his plan yet but something would have to be done, soon. Harry already missed this. Missed Hogwarts, missed his friends, missed this calm before the storm. It might have been an uneasy time but the storm hadn’t struck yet. Harry knew that when it did there would be no calm for a long time after.
“If you’re sure.”
Draco scoffed at her theatrics. “Don’t be such a child.”
“Hello Draco darling,” his mother addressed him with a pointed stare. “You remember Mrs Clemonte and her son Griffin?“
The sense of euphoria had settled into a fuzzy buzz in his chest as he showered and changed.
“The eye mask makes up for the lack of silk pyjamas,” he explained.
Draco paced the dormitory, back and forth, running his hands through his hair. Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. He kicked his trunk hard but, of course, it did nothing but make his toes hurt. A choked sob rises up in his throat and he tries so hard to keep from making a sound as silent tears slip from his eyes. Sitting down on his bed he buries his face in his hands and cries softly. Pathetic. He’s so pathetic.
“'Real mature, Malfoy.'” Seeming to not be able to help himself Draco tacked on, “And no actually I will never need to know how to manually make meals. This is servants work. I am a Malfoy.”
“Yeah, like imagine your doing a girl, or she’s sucking you off or something. Whatever gets you off.”
“You just know I got you better gifts this year.”
Draco bit his lower lip. “Even if we go to them we still don’t know the entrance to the chamber of secrets. Without that this information won’t be of much use Let’s find it and then tell them.”
“Bloody hell these chairs are uncomfortable,” Draco complained. “They give my arse pins and needles.”
"Along with everyone else it seems, " Harry said, rolling his eyes.
“Au moins tu as l’air bonne dedans, beau gosse.” (roughly translated : at least you look hot in it, hunk)
Harry grinned and winked before dashing down to the slytherin dormitory. He couldn’t help the mad grin on his face as he whipped around corners and took the stairs two at a time. Draco made him entirely too happy.
Theo, initially in the submissive position, stepped forward on his left foot and moved into Adam’s personal space. This forced Adam to reorient his hand, palm now vertical.
“What version of President have you been playing?!”
“You really suck at this game, Theodore,” Pansy frowned over her book at the chessboard containing significantly more of Harry’s pieces.
“Yes, well, it all worked out though, didn’t it?’
His eyes scanned the dancefloor and landed on Draco and Claudette. In the dark he could barely make out ones limbs from the other. Tearing his eyes away he looked at Pansy instead. Her dark eye makeup really made her eyes sparkle, he told her as much. This made her smile.
Harry felt flustered. "Nice to meet you too."
“I’m serious. I won’t invite you up again if you do.”
“It’s another attack,” Dumbledore answered. “He’s been petrified.” Draco’s heart stopped in his chest and Harry’s eyes widened. Who? Who’d been petrified?
Before I continue, I find it important to express that I have always acted in a way that I’d hoped would make you proud of me. I would never intentionally attempt to disappoint or disrespect you.
“Be my guest,” Theodore said, sitting up and making more room for them, gesturing to the space around him. “And call me Theo, or Nott. Only my mother, bless her heart, calls me Theodore.”
“I would not. I refuse to have this conversation with you-”
“You didn’t enter?”
“Oh not you, Draco dear. I know you know what a skincare routine is but none of our other clueless friends do.”
"Can we help you?" Pansy demanded. Harry looked up and saw that her question was directed at a dark skinned boy Harry knew as Blaise Zabini. They shared a dorm but the other boy was pretty quiet. Actually, Harry realized, Blaise was reasonably outgoing. It was himself and Draco who kept to themselves.
“Looked in a mirror yourself yet, Potter?”
The whole night Harry found his eyes going to Malfoy even though Pansy was all done up. She clung to his arm and whispered in his ear in the way she’d always done that he’d never found annoying before but despised for some reason that evening. She really did look lovely in a dark green, silky looking dress that swept the floor and had thin, intricate straps in the back. Her dark long hair was in a braided messy bun up the back of her head. Harry really couldn’t figure out how she’d done it.
“What will they do?”
Draco glanced up from the table and made eye contact with Griffin. It was heated and charged. This meal ought to be interesting.
“Oh please, he’s as obsessed and doe eyed over you as you are over him-” she insisted.
They were well into their classes by now and fall wind danced through their hair and rippled through their clothes. They were out on the Quidditch grounds at lunch with a pair of broomsticks, sneaking around trying not to get caught since technically first years weren't supposed to ride broomsticks outside of classes.
Recognition passed over the girls face. "You're Harry Potter. Mother said she thought it was about time you started your education. My name's Pansy Parkinson. It's a pleasure to meet you."
Draco only shrugged. “Shall we?”
"Whatever. Why would you want a potion that makes you hiccough?"
“I’ll come,” Harry told them.
He returned it. "Will do."
“Well either you can use it or continue to look like a Gryffindor banner,” Mrs Malfoy told her son, winking at Harry who grinned.
Theo turned to face her with a look darker than she’d ever seen on him before. “What’d’you care,” he snarled.
Harry wanted to go to Draco, to talk to him and understand what was wrong but he also trusted Pansy and knew that she wanted to help too. He nodded and sat back down. Harry tried to go back to talking to the other boys and their conversation as she walked up to the dorms but found that he was just too distracted with worry over Draco.
“I’m not going to be murdered,” Harry said, hard and cold. The memory of the looming black dog with glowing yellow eyes from the night he’d run away from the Dursleys washed over him.
He shook his head, despairingly. “I don’t know. I don’t think so. Not completely anyway. I’m sorry.”
He lay in bed, motionless, as he caught his breath. Harry felt totally drained and let himself sink heavily into the sheets, relaxing completely. Then the reality of what had just happened dawned on him. He’d just come at the thought of his best friend. Panic seized him and ruined his ability to marinate in the wonderful feeling he’d just achieved. It’s because we have such a close friendship, Harry tried to reason with himself.
“Oh dear boy!” Mrs Clemonte bustled forward and clasped Harry’s hands in her own. Draco drew some satisfaction from the surprised look on Harry’s face. “It’s so nice to meet you!”
“Harry, honey, you aren’t making sense.”
“Too bad. Switch.”
Dumbledore nodded. “I will notify her parents.”
so that's all of second year in one chapter. it's longer than the last few chapters by a lot because it's one long chapter instead of split up. do you guys prefer shorter chapters more frequently or longer chapters slightly less often?
“More than we can.”
“But you weren’t.”
Pansy stood and hit his shoulder playfully. “You’re so cocky,” she teased. “I’ll be back in a minute with my makeup bag.”
“Voldemort.” Draco nodded, confirming what they both already knew. “Where’d they go?”
“G’night, Draco.”
"I'm not-"
“-and I hear you, I do, but you’re name got in somehow. So what’s the most logical explanation?” Pansy asked with an expectant look on her face. Like he had any answers.
Blaise shrugged. "Sure, I'll be back in a minute."
She nodded and twirled a strand of curling dark hair between her fingers.. “Your boyfriend is a jealous one.”
Pansy paused whatever she was doing to Harry’s face to remove her bra (without removing her shirt and pulling it through her sleeve) and hand it over to Theo.
"He's right," Blaise said, agreeing with Draco, yawning as well. "We won't do well if we don't get enough sleep and are exhausted when we're writing the test."
I hope this finds you before you reach your aunt and uncle. I don't know whether they're used to owl post. I am in hiding. I won't tell you where, in case this owl falls into the wrong hands. I have some doubts about his reliability, but he is the best I could find, and he did seem eager for the job.
“One-Two-THREE!” A flash of blue left both of their wands and the five of them watched in horror as Ron’s rat writhed madly before there was another flash came and then like a fast forward video the rat transformed. First a head shot out, then limbs, and before long a short grubby man was standing before them where Scabbers had once been. He had discoloured pale skin, a balding scalp with little hair and ugly yellowed front teeth.
“I hate when you speak french. I never know what you’re saying,” grumbled Harry, though he didn’t mean it.
The young boy appeared out of the trains billowing steam so suddenly that Narcissa barely managed to catch the handle of Draco's trolley before it hit him. Time froze around Narcissa Malfoy at the sight of the bespectacled child. It couldn't be, but it was.
Draco sighed heavily. All he really wanted to do was relax but his parents had raised him to be a good host. He supposed relaxing would just have to wait. “What would you suggest?”
At least he's not going to Durmstrang, she told herself. Narcissa had barely convinced her husband not to send their son off to such a wretched, fowl, and not to mention far, place. She glanced down at Draco and shuddered. No, that most certainly was not the place for her sweet boy. He didn't need anymore coldness in his life.
“She’ll make you see a healer.”
Harry sat heavily on the bed.  “You like me?”
Seeing the distrust in Harry’s face Lupin said, “If he really is just a rat it won’t hurt him.”
“Because we’re best mates.” He wasn’t sure why he felt defensive.
“Come now, Mister Malfoy, let’s get him to the hospital wing. Madam Pomfrey will be able to help him.”
“Harry, remember right before the attack on Justin and sir Nick, how you told me you heard a voice in the walls talking about how it was going to kill?’ Harry nodded. “And how you’ve heard it before every attack? The Basalisk is a snake-”
“You have to pick someone!” Theo cackled.
Weird. So weird.
“That’s what I was saying,” Theodore nodded approvingly. “I think it’s a toss up between her and Lavender Brown.”
“Claudette! What is it?” Draco demanded, flabbergasted.
"I'm heading up as well," said Blaise.
sorry this took awhile to come out. i just got back from buenos aires! (so i haven't had much time to write)
I’ve been trying to think of what the best way to tell you is. Upon much thought and contemplation, I've come to the conclusion that instead of beating around the bush, I'll tell you out right, plainly, as it is.
“Pans, you have to know.”
“I’m not,” Harry confirmed.
“You must be Mrs Malfoy,” the young girl smiled up at her. “I’m Pansy Parkinson.” Ah, yes, Narcissa recognised Mauricius and Laurel Parkinson’s features mixed together in the girls face.
"And why's that?"
All the eyes in the dormitory swung to Harry.
“Better than,” Theo bragged. “I asked her when we broke up if she was interested in being friends with benefits cause I’d be down, she didn’t seem too interested in that idea.”
“Don’t call me a nutter when you’re hair looks like that.” Harry glanced up from his food but looked back down quickly because of the look Pansy was giving him. He hated when her eyes were all pointy like that at him. Not that he maybe didn’t deserve it right now.
Harry’s stomach sank. Was there a platonic sounding way to explain that he liked wearing Draco’s sweater because it smelled like him?
Harry looked wide eyed at the glistening silver, emerald encrusted, sword in his hands. It was perhaps the most beautiful thing Harry had ever seen. He looked up at Draco, who was trying to look cool and unbothered but Harry could see beneath it.
Harry yawned. “Yeah, okay. Never have I ever-”
"My Mother's parents weren't either," Harry said.
Mother
"No."
Pansy considered him. “We’ll see.”
Harry dropped his trunk to the floor and placed Hedwig's cage down beside it. She hooted and flapped her wings restlessly.
“You have to stop beating yourself up.”
“Not until after dinner,” Harry said. “There are too many people around who will panic. Besides everyone is safer in numbers with all of us here in the great hall.”
“Want some more coffee, Blaise?”
“Merlin, no, Draco. It’s like it’s in the walls.”
“I think his name’s Jeoffrey.”
“I’ve seen you staring at Miles Bletchley after Quidditch games, which I understand, his ass does look fine in those pants. You also got quite flustered that time that blond sixth year what’s-his-name-Arlenwoods asked you about the new common room password. There was also the time-”
Who is Adam? Harry wondered to himself.
“I found the letter,” Harry confessed, sitting up. Draco switched on the bedside light and squinted at Harry, eyes adjusting. Harry was pushing his glasses onto his face. “When I was going through your trunk to find your scarf for you. It was an accident, I shouldn’t have read it, but I found the letter from Clemonte.”
“Yes, well, I’m glad you like it.”
"My whole family has been in Slytherin. Which do you think you'll be in?"
“I don’t like him! That’s absurd!”
While Pansy went off on Theo, Draco was surprised when Harry leaned over. The weight of the other boy rested fully on Draco. “Can I sleep with you tonight? Like old times?”
Harry settled his head in Draco’s lap so he could play with his hair more easily. Harry looked into Pansy’s eyes. “You know, you’re like one of my favourite people?”
“They’re really good! I couldn’t just not get them for you,” he said, defensively, as he slid out of bed and made his way toward the bathroom. “Come on, get up, it’s present time.”
“No, I do not. I think it sounds pretentious.”
“No, you can’t”
“Can’t we just stay in bed five more minutes?” Harry moaned pitifully, pulling the duvet up to his chin.
That managed to get Harry’s attention. “‘Gifts? Seriously, Malfoy? Plural?”
“Is she married?” Theo asked, running a hand through his disorderly dirty blond hair.
“How come you never walk me to class?” Harry asked his boyfriend, faking a pout.
Harry finally looked up. “What do you mean?”
“Because when you start brainstorming about possible concoctions you mutter under your breath or write lists in the margins.”
Tears sprung to Draco’s eyes and threatened to spill down his cheeks. He blinked furiously trying to keep them from doing so.  He stabbed a finger at Harry. “YOU’RE SUPPOSED TO BE MY BEST FRIEND!”
“Gee thanks, Pansy,” said Harry, looking through them. He knew muggles had face masks but he was pretty sure they weren’t baby blue with crushed billywig wing to clear pores or chartreuse with gnome saliva to calm irritation and soothe redness.
Green lanterns hung from the ceiling on thin silver chains, they lit the room with a greenish hue. The room might have seemed cold and unwelcoming if it weren't for the crackling fire beneath an intricately designed mantelpiece and the plush furniture. On one side of the room there was a dark wooden table that appeared to be long enough for a great many students to sit at. Bookshelves lined the walls and Harry had the urge to go over and run his fingers along the spines. Harry thought it looked positively magical.
“And what Harry? As if that kid has anything on you! You’re Harry bloody Potter!”
Blaise tilted his head. “It’s the only opening this year so I’d bargain he is.”
Little did Harry know but the way he himself was looking made Draco’s insides liquify. It was evident, so crystal clear, much much they meant to one another.
Theo shrank into himself. “Sorry, that’s just what everyone’s saying in the great hall.” He turned to Harry. “We don’t care if you are by the way. It’d be pretty cool actually.”
When Draco woke the next morning, it was to a strange sensation. His legs were tangled with Harry’s and the other boy had his arm draped around Draco’s midsection. This was fine. Everything was fine. Best friends cuddled all the time. Slowly, to not wake Harry, Draco pushed his eye mask up onto his forehead so he could see.
“He just doesn’t.”
“I’m not implying anything, the stories said the beast would purge the school of all who weren’t worthy of studying magic and that’s what it’s doing, but while we’re on the subject you should probably watch your back too, blood traitor.”
“That’s some bullshit! I’m right bloody here!”
There was another knock and Draco’s door and they startled apart. “Guests will be here soon!” His mother called out.
“Nope, orange is.” Theo looked all too pleased with himself, leaning back, crossing his leg over so his ankle rested on his knee, smirking.
Then footsteps started to echo down the hall. Everyone was going down to the great hall for the Halloween great feast. He wanted to pull Harry away so no one would see them at the scene of the crime but it was too late. Kids were already starting to round the corner.
“Then let’s do something!”
“What do you mean, what do I bloody care?!”
“The Clemontes are old family friends.”
Harry vaguely remembered hearing Draco mention them. "It's a position in Quidditch, right?  Chase something called a snitch? A little gold ball or something?"
“Are you fucking kidding me, Parkinson?!” He snarled.
“Piano.”
Harry tucked his arm through his boyfriends. “So Theo likes Pansy?”
“Nah, that one’s boring since we all know who’d do who. Let’s do truth or dare.”
“Uh, yeah, you totally do.”
“Harry? Harry Potter?”
Draco rearranged his grip on his heavy trunk handle. “To find another compartment.”
Third Year
Draco snorted. "Well I know that."
“Ho ho!” Theo said. “Nice try, Malfoy. We’re going in.”
Then the train started to slow.
“I can’t,” he scoffed. No way. “It would make things too weird.”
Harry wet his lips, his mouth felt suddenly very dry as the full force of how protective he felt toward Draco washed over him. It was stronger, he realised, than the protectiveness he felt for anyone else. The notion terrified him. Draco was the one he loved above all else, the one he’d kill for.
“Yes, you do. You can’t lie to me.”
“We’re just gonna have to agree to disagree.”
That was enough to make Draco close his book all the way. Harry wasn’t sure why that made him so happy to have Draco’s full and undivided attention. “My brand?”
“Are you trying to make me throw up?”
“No, Hufflepuff.”
He saw Theo look between them both, thick brows furrowed in confusion as he attempted to figure out what was going on with them. Seeming to give up he broke the awkward silence, “Pans and I are going to Hogsmeade this weekend are you two coming?”
“I know just the spell that will help him!” Lockhart declared.
Pansy gasped and sat up so fast that watching her made Harry’s head spin. “We should make friendship bracelets!”
Draco came down the stairs to take it from her. He wore a light grey shirt and comfortable looking jeans. He was more dressed down than usual. “Thank you. Why didn’t you just send Dobby to get this and to fetch Harry?”
I’m attracted to boys. I’m gay.
It had finally happened, the most dreaded scenario. The Basilisk had taken a student down into the chamber of secrets.
“Get started. If we start now we should finish before dinner, usually when it’s just me it takes me into tomorrow.”
“I-” Pansy cleared her throat. “-I just have to hold it down so it sticks better,” she explained to Theodore.
Draco had never felt so on top of the world than in that moment standing at the top of the hill with all his friends, looking down at the view before them.
He burst into Slytherin common room and his housemates immediately crowded around them. After ten or so minutes of having passed around the broom Harry went to sit with his friends by the fire.
Narcissa quickly gathered her wits and smiled warmly at him, even while her insides were squirming. Barely capable of seeing straight from anxiety she said, "Yes, of course, come along, darling."
“I was er- gonna take a shower?”
With no warning the snitch stopped in mid air and just as Harry’s fingers slide around it a player in green slammed into him. Both of them tumbled to the ground.
“Must they?” Blaise asked, deadpanned.
"See you."
“-your need is greater than ours,” Fred said with a twinkle in his eyes. With that he produced a large piece of folded up yellowed parchment.
Draco narrowed his eyes. “Are you gonna keep being weird because I’m gay?”
“He’s on the run. That isn’t free.”
“Trust me, I don’t like it either,” Harry said, “but he’s got a plan which is more than we can say. Now come on we’ve got to hurry. We don’t have much time.”
When Harry exited the Slytherin dormitories he waved Ron over.
“Dumbledore,” she addressed the old withered man. “What in Merlin’s name is going on. Where are my boys?”
“Oh, Harry, you’re so wonderful.” She rested her cheek on his shoulder. “You’ve always been such a sweetheart. I’m shocked you don’t already have a date to the Yule Ball. I thought for sure you’d have one weeks ago. I thought I would too but that's a whole other matter.” She sniffled, nose still blocked up. Harry wished he had some tissues on him.
“But you have to-”
“So... Draco, huh?” There was an amused glint in her eyes as she gave him a small smile.
"Granger." Draco repeated the girls name. "That's not a wizards name I've heard before. Who are your parents?"
“At least I'm being honest!”
“Hey!” Harry protested.
“If I knew why I wouldn’t be asking!” Draco descended the stairwell at what was nearly a run as Harry sped walked after him. “Come back here and talk to me!”
“You boys have fun outside?” Mrs Malfoy asks, peering around the doorway of the sitting room, when they come in.
"We ended it,” She told him, face and voice both emotionless.
Pansy pulled back from Theo and pulled Harry and Draco into an equally tight embrace. “It’s so good to see my boys! I’ve missed you all so much, the summer felt so long being apart from you all for so many weeks. Blaise and Adam are already inside, c’mon in.”
The boy's lip curled. “You’re such a slut!”
“No? Why would it be a big deal?” The other boys glasses were sliding down his nose and Draco felt the urge to reach over and push them back up but resisted.
"Then what's the problem?" It annoyed Harry that Draco wouldn't look him in the eye.
“My gifts first!” Theo said as he got up from the sofa, dragging his duvet behind him, to where he bent over by the tree and turned around, arms full of similarly shaped and sized gifts.
“You don’t think it’s a big deal?”
“Ah, who cares about that. Everyone hates that dumb cat and no one much liked Creevey either. He was such a sniveling little git, always trying to get pictures of-”
Draco fished around for his wand under the sofa cushion. “Accio shot glasses!”
“I’m bored,” moaned Pansy on their first night, falling back into the sitting room sofa.
After the feast an older student had led them to the Slytherin dormitory. The way down Harry saw an assortment of strange things. The paintings that hung on the castle walls moved and talked to him, he walked through a ghost more than once and everyone seemed to be staring at him when he'd pass. The Slytherin dormitory was incredible. It was a long underground room with a low ceiling. The walls were made of rough stone and it seemed to be located beneath the lake as there were glass walls at the end that held back water. Harry pushed his face up against the glass and saw what looked like a giant squid swim by when he squinted through the murky water.
“You think you’re all the way gay?” she tried to joke.
Draco tilted his head back and clung to Harry, releasing a trembling breath. Between breathy gasps he said, “We said we’d go to Hogsmeade with them. If we don’t go soon they’ll know something’s up.”
Harry shared a knowing look with Draco.
“I think I’ve had too much whiskey,” Draco giggled, sitting back.
“We had sex, Potter, yeah.”
“You have a beautiful property, Mrs Malfoy,” Harry says, slipping off his trainers.
also sorry for spelling mistakes i wrote this on an 11 hour plane ride and i'm currently running on an hour of sleep aha
Draco waved his hands in the air. “I don’t know, Harry! Maybe because ever since you saw Clemonte and I snogging in the library you won’t even look me in the eye!”
“Could you help me with my cufflinks?” Harry asked shyly. “Like you did at the Yule Ball.”
The train ride back to Hogwarts was brutal. Draco had been trying to get Harry to talk to him but he was always around Pansy, Theo or Blaise. Now they sat on opposite sides of the train compartment, avoiding eye contact and not talking to each other unless it was indirectly.
Harry had no clue. “Dunno,” he answered honestly.
He swallowed down his fear. “I’m gay.”
"You wouldn't know them. They're dentists." Hermione puffed out her chest but at the same time her voice shrank.
“What are you going to do to him?” Ron demanded from the bed, his face twisted in pain from his probably broken leg.
Harry heard a cough from Draco’s bed and froze. He’d remembered to put up silencing charms right? Draco wouldn’t hear him?
Harry frowned, clearly confused. "House?"
Other people were crowding around them now, helping Pucey to his feet. Draco looked around for someone who could help but the only teacher present was Lockhart.
Harry sat back, pulling out of arm's reach, and tried to calm down but he was so worked up. It had come over him so fast, the overwhelming rush. “I’m so stupid. I don’t know how I just figured it out.”
“Apparently so,” said Draco fondly.
“-not to mention the trouble you’ve been getting into over the last two years has been pretty impressive-”
“We will.” Harry turned to Draco. “Now’s the time for whatever plan you said you had.’
Harry huffed in annoyance and moaned.
“What else am I supposed to say?” Draco adopted a mocking voice.  “‘Oh, Harry, do you really think so? Oh, Harry, compliment me more, Harry!’” He dropped the high tone. “I don’t think so.”
“What does it look like, idiot?”
They loved him. They loved him now, before the letter, surely they’d love him after.
“Be that as it is. Who did this? I want to see punishment.”
“You’re dad seems like he was a pretty cool guy,” Ron laughed.
“Well what am I supposed to do with it?” Theo asked. “Let it go on the grounds?”
“Uh, yeah?”
“Alright, alright, calm down, Pans.” Theo put away the plastic bag and took out a carton of cigarettes instead.
“Draco, talk to me,” She begs him, sitting beside him on his bed, her hand on his shoulder. He wants to shrug it off but resists.
“Oh stop. I was only teasing. Of course you can. Just come in after the others have gone to bed.”
“Oh leave him alone,” Draco says, helping Harry with his trunk.
He’d felt hurt before. Heart achingly upset that his best friend wouldn’t speak to him. Now anger swelled in his chest. This was ridiculous. He couldn’t take it anymore. Pushing past rowdy students, Draco left the quidditch stands.He wasn’t going to put up with this bullshit anymore.
He nodded. Pansy was probably right, she usually was about this sort of thing.
His eyes filled with sympathy. It wasn’t a look she was used to seeing on his face. Usually they just joked around and teased each other. It felt like she was seeing a new side of him. “Shit, Pans, I’m so sorry.”
“Merlin, get off my back! It’s not like you’re my fucking girlfriend!” Pansy’s hands curled into fists and her face flashed tomato red before her expression hardened. Theo paled, looking like he regretted the words the instant they’d left his mouth. But it was too late to take them back. “Pans, I’m sor-”
“Merlin, you’re all so boring,” Blaise groaned.
“Remember that time you came to the manor for Christmas in first year? And we accidentally got tipsy with the eggnog?”
Just then two Beauxbatons girls walked by. One was the girl from dinner a few nights ago and the other was a very pretty girl with long, thick, curly, dair hair and olive skin. “Claudette, c'est le garçon dont je te parlais! Il va à l'école ici et parle français!” (Claudette, this is the boy I was telling you about! he goes to school here and speaks french!)
The tears had finally stopped and he sniffed. “That doesn’t mean Draco likes me, Pansy.”
There was silence in the group.
“When the Clemontes came over. Draco did a little more than show Griffin the books his mother wanted him too. Then there was that time when we were playing cards.”
Harry lost some of his defiance. “Oh yeah.”
Harry ended up receiving a joke set of wizards chess from Theo, a hair potion from Blaise (“to at least attempt to tame that birds nest you call hair,” Blaise told him), a Chudley Cannons jersey from Ron and from Hermione he got a talking diary that says, “Do it today or later you’ll pay!” From Sirius and Remus Harry received “Practical Defense Magic and its Use Against The Dark Arts” and a luxey eagle quill and bottle green dress robes from the Malfoys.
Draco strained to hear whatever Harry was talking about but heard nothing out of the ordinary. “Hear what?”
Harry peered down and sure enough his torso was gone. Or not gone, just invisible. Harry looked up, hoping Draco would have an explanation.
By now there was a large crowd up students surrounding them, watching the scene play out from a safe distance. Aldrich’s face twisted and he spat at Harry's feet. The other boy reached for his pocket and it was only then, through his rage that Harry remembered his wand. As both of them drew their wands and were about to fire off spells a loud voice thundered, "EXPELLIARMUS!" Both Harry and Aldrich’s wands flew out of their hands.
“J’ai envie de t’embrasser.” (I want to kiss you)
“It was a rooster actually, but thanks. I just remembered what that book Hermione had shown us mentioned that it’s cry is fatal to a Basalisk.”
“None of your business.” She held up her nails and examined them, refusing to talk about her and Harry anymore. "Truth or dare, Theodore?’
Harry nodded but averted his eyes and pressed his lips together. He felt so lost.
“Potter? Bloody hell! What are you doing?” Draco demanded, cheeks bright red.
I do hope that your love for me does not change.
“Thanks. Hopefully we win this year.”
“I covered for you!” Hermione shrieked at Lupin, who’d helped Black to his feet and hugged him with deep affection. “Draco and I didn’t tell anyone! But all this time- you’ve been helping him!”
“It was the way you said it,” Harry pouted.
"We'll see you at Christmas, Draco." His Father shook his hand.
Draco hiccoughed, trying to retain his sobs, he glared daggers.  “And?”
“Did you ever tell your parents about us?” Harry said quietly, scared to break the spell over the slytherin common room. It was incredibly late, so late it was probably actually early, and every one but he and Draco were in their dorms. The fire crackled and Draco’s head rested on Harry’s chest. The light from the fire reflected orange light against the boy’s light blond hair. Harry couldn’t resist running his hands through it. Draco sighed in contentment.
“Well, alright then,” Blake chuckled. “This weekend work for you?”
“Since when’d she get one’a those?”
Pansy nodded, understanding, and Draco tried to relax his tense shoulders. His whole body was stiff with stress. “I won’t tell anyone. Don’t worry,” Pansy reassured him, voice soothing as she took his hand between both of hers and squeezed it.
Harry reached out and cupped Draco’s face in his hands to deepen the kiss. Draco gave a little breathy moan that made Harry melt. To his disappointment a second later the other boy pulled away. “We should go meet the others.”
“That’s not how you play, Theodore!” Pansy insisted.
“This is my serious face,” Theo told him, biting his lower lip to try and suppress the grin, it was totally ineffective.
Anger like he’d never felt before roared up in Harry. “YOU FUCKER! I DON”T THINK HE WOULD HAVE WANTED YOU TO BETRAY HIM AND MY MOTHER!” Harry yelled as he lunged at Black, but Draco and Pansy held him back. “LET ME GO! HE KILLED MY PARENTS AND I”M GOING TO KILL HIM!”
“Don’t argue, Potter. This way if you have another nightmare I’ll be here with you.” Something in Harry’s stomach fluttered at that. Harry slipped his hand around Draco’s wrist loosely and pulled him toward the bed in the middle of the room. The duvet was pushed back, the sheets rumpled, decorative pillows discarded on the floor. Harry felt bad for waking Draco, he hadn’t meant to. Hopefully he hadn’t been screaming loud enough for it to wake Mr or Mrs Malfoy.
“Harry, come look at this!” Pansy said from around a corner. Harry shrugged at Draco apologetically but followed the sound of her voice around a massive leafy plant.
He shakes his head and wills words to come out of his mouth but he can’t find the right ones. He’s having a hard time even looking at her. Draco crosses his ankles and blinks his eyes hard, trying to not cry anymore.
Saying goodbye to her boys at the station was incredibly hard for Narcissa. Harder than saying goodbye at the start of the school year because now she had two boys to say goodbye to. Harry had somehow wormed his way into her heart. He was a sarcastic, charming young man and she liked the way he made Draco loosen up a bit. The memory of walking in on them curled up together in their silk pyjamas and wrapped in cloaks and surrounded by christmas gifts came to the forefront of her mind. She’d spotted the eggnog and whiskey sitting, mostly empty, on one of her good wooden tables with no coatsters but had found that she wasn’t upset because the sight of her little boy so comfortable with another person made her, as a mother, happier than she’d thought it would.
“You’re such a child,” Draco huffed, crossing his arms across his chest.
“Want me to do eyeliner?” Pansy asked Harry.
Draco watched, frozen, as the snake uncurled itself from Theo’s arm and slid to the floor faster than Draco would have imagined possible. “Get it back, Nott!” Draco fumed through gritted teeth. But the snake, Cupcake, was already halfway down the great hall, slithering between the tables. Draco was about to turn to tell Theo to do something when the snake halted in front of a redheaded first year. Just as the snake reared up Harry stiffened beside him and sprung to his feet. Draco was about to follow when Harry started to hiss. But it wasn’t like anything Draco had ever heard before. The moment the hissing, strangled sounds started to leave Harry’s mouth the snake stopped in its track and turned to face Harry, hissing back to him. A thought came the the forefront of Draco’s mind that made his blood run cold. Parselmouth. Someone who could talk to snakes. Draco watched, transfixed as it sounded like Harry was egging on the snake. Before anything else could happen, Dumbledore stepped forward and uttered a spell that made the snake writhe and then shrivel up until it was an empty snakes skin in the middle of the great hall at the young redheads feet.
“Sirius is dead,” Harry said, voice cracking, sadness clouding his features.
“That’s different than rolling and -” She let out a frustrated sigh. “Just don’t okay!”
All Harry could do was stare.
“Huh, really?”
“Because it makes me jealous, alright? I’m jealous. And angry. Is that what you wanted to hear? Are you happy now?!”
“Well you’re going as friends, right?”
“I could have been naked!”
“Why not?”
"Bye."
The night of the Malfoy Christmas dinner party Draco was almost ready when there was a knock at his bedroom door. He was only a little surprised to see Harry standing on the other side.
Draco raised his eyebrows. “Boxers and a tshirt aren’t extra enough for you?”
“You’re such a dork.”
It was a few nights before the third task and it was safe to say that Harry was stressed. He felt like he was going to come out of his skin. It was late and he was exhausted and he wanted to sleep so badly but couldn’t for the life of him. Harry had been irritated the last few days because he only managed to fall asleep hours past his roomates when it was as Blaise usually called the hours “the ass crack of dawn”. Ready to smother himself with a pillow a desperate idea came to mind. Theo, of course it had been Theo, had told him about how jerking off could help lower stress and relax. He’d heard the other boys do it behind their hangings some nights when they forgot a silencing charm. It didn’t seem like there was all that much to it.
Harry was distracted from the actual words coming out of Draco’s mouth as his attention was actually currently mostly fixed on how the red and gold trimmed robes Draco was wearing brought out the pale pink blush his face had turned. When he didn’t answer Draco’s eyes wandered to meet his in the mirror’s reflection and Harry pulled himself together enough to string a sentence together. “I look stupid in these.” Harry held out his arms so Draco could see how dumb he looked in the dress robes.
“Oh, please, you guys are so close. I’ve never seen best friends like you two. It makes sense, after all these years-”
“Truth, I guess.”
Harry broke away, heavy tears falling down his cheeks. “I can’t.”
“Kiss me and give me luck,” Harry said, from behind him. Draco turned and ran his hands up his boyfriends lean chest and over his broad shoulders. He gave him a quick but firm kiss. He’d never thought of himself as much of one for PDA but with Harry…
Draco stepped toward him until Harry had to tilt his head up to see into Draco’s eyes. His head was spinning and his head was blank. He was close, so close. Close enough to feel the heat radiating from his body. Close enough to feel his breath ghosting across his lips. Harry felt light headed, Merlin, he was breathless. Draco’s pale pink lips were slightly parted and it was with great effort that Harry pulled his eyes away from them. Draco stared down at him, eyes lidded. Harry watched his grey eyes fall to his lips before flicking back up to look into Harry’s. “Can I kiss you?” Draco asked in a horse whisper.
“I can have it back? Seriously?”
Draco could almost see the dots connecting in Harry’s head. “And by someone you mean...?”
“I mean that’s kind of what happened last year.”
"You know what a seeker is?"
“What’s going on?” asked Pansy, cupping his face. “You’re all sweaty and pale.”
“That isn’t reassuring.”
“Sounds nice to me,” said Adam, sliding his arm around Pansy’s waist.
“Truth or dare, Draco?” Harry asked.
Harry raised his eyebrows at his friends dramatic response. “And?”
Draco smirked. “Come on and you’ll see.”
Pain flashed across Harry’s face. “The team is waiting for-”
“I think we both have.”
Harry obliged and tried not to squirm too much as Pansy used her teeth to pull his left sock off. She made it look really easy.
“That’s right, they’re still very young though.”
His view of the boy was locked when Mrs Clemonte, a hefty woman wearing a navy blue dress and her hair in a low bun, stood when she saw Draco. She set down her tea with a clatter that made his mother flinch. “Draco! The last time I saw you was nearly five years ago! How are you my dear?” she looked behind Draco and spotted Harry, Blaise and Pansy. “Draco are these your friends from Hogwarts? How is school going? Enjoying it I hope? I’ve heard wonderful things!”
Malfoy Manor was beautiful in the winter. Then, Harry had never seen it at any other time of the year, he was sure it looked just as incredible no matter the season. Harry stared wide eyed at the way the snow coated the manor. It was an old building with arches and spires and balcony railings. He loved the old architecture. Loved walking among the snow dusted  shrubs and trees in the sprawling gardens.
“What?”
Harry was falling and Draco was moving. He watched transfixed, running down the stairs, skipping steps to get to Harry faster. But no matter how fast Draco moved Harry was falling faster. Another player, a Slytherin, was falling with Harry. He watched in horror as Harry’s body hit the earth and went limp, the other player fell on top of him. Far away Draco could hear yelling but Draco was focused on getting to Harry. When he did he shoved Adrien Pucey, one of Slytherin’s chasers off Harry’s unmoving body.
“So, you knew then?” No answer. “You don’t like him back?”
Harry nodded. That made sense. And besides, wisdom? Courage? Harry didn't feel like he had much of either of those qualities. "Yeah, sounds alright."
However, only seconds after Gabriel and Timothy had left, their banter fading, he heard the change room door swing open again. He turned, thinking maybe one of the boys had left something behind, but froze upon coming face to face with Draco.
“No pressure or anything,” he joked, Pansy rolled her eyes. “But in all seriousness,” Harry insisted, softening, “Draco and I are no different from you and Theo, Pans.”
“Better than being wrong and having him never talk to me again.”
Blaise shoved open his hangings and stuck his head own. “Shut up you prats. It’s like the ass crack of dawn, what are you doing up?”
Draco’s hand went to his back where it rubbed circles, but he remained quiet, knowing there wasn’t anything he could say that could make up for the loss of the hope of that future he knew Harry had hoped for, to get away from his awful relatives.
"Huh?"
“Did Lucius tell you where he was taking Richard out tonight?” Mrs Clemonte asked Mrs Malfoy.
"Oh. Well it's nice to meet you but I haven't seen a toad."
“Merlin, what a bunch of wankers,” Theo muttered sourly.
“It’s not extreme,” said Harry, running his hands over his face and through his hair, frustrated with the whole situation. “Draco can’t possible think it’s okay to distinguish wizards and their worth by their blood status.”
Harry shook his head. “It doesn’t make up for anything because witches and wizards who aren’t purebloods aren’t lacking. Look at Hermione for example, both her parents are muggles and she’s a better student than any of us.”
“Truth or dare?” she asked him when his sock was off.
“So we figured-”
“Like what?” asked Blaise.
It was the last evening of the winter break and students were milling around the common room, settling back in. They’d arrived around noon on the Hogwarts express and she’d only just finished unpacking her trunk when she’d received the letters. A Hogwarts house elf had delivered them to Pansy before snapping his fingers and vanishing in a puff of smoke. She sat down in a leather chair with a high back and stared at them, dread rising in her gut. She had a good guess about the contents of the letters. They came in thick yellow envelopes, the wax seal displaying the Parkinson family crescent. The first had her name written across the front in her mother's familiar elegant cursive. The other had her name across the front in her fathers loopy scrawl. The letters themselves weren’t anything impressive. They weren’t long. Only a few lines.
“Please don’t. I don’t want to be skinned alive.”
Draco shrugged. “Must’ve been at some point this summer.”
“Oh, for Merlin’s sake you two,” Pansy snapped. “Would you stop for just two seconds with your incessant bickering!”
“S’not!” She cried.
“Well, hullo, Theo. Have a nice summer?” Harry grinned back.
“I can hear it.”
“Aren’t we going to wait for your parents?”
Harry floundered. “It’s a mistake?”
“Yup.”
Draco swept him into a tight embrace. Harry went limp in his arms and squeezed his eyes shut as the grief tore through him.
“I’m really glad you aren’t going anywhere with Clemonte ever.”
“What’s this?” Harry asked, just having come into the dormitory after spending hours writing an essay for Transfigurations. There was a long parcel, wrapped in brown paper laying on his four poster bed.
The food was good and the music was even better. Later on in the night when his feet hurt and his cheeks were sore from laughing and smiling so much he went to get him and Pansy drinks. There was nothing alcoholic of course but there was a bowl of punch at a table with goblets nearby.
She smiled at him. "Make sure Draco knows that. Of course it's fine for you to make new friends. Just remember your old ones."
“Nah, you two head on up to the party. I’ll only be a few minutes longer.”
“Never have I ever actually really liked a song by Celestina Warbeck.”
"Is that who you live with?" Hermione asked curiously. "I really am sorry about your parents by the way. I couldn't find very many good books on what happened that night and of course my parents can't tell me. It must be awful."
That night when he was falling asleep he knew he had to tell Harry. He just had to wait and try to figure out how the other boy would respond.
“I can’t believe you guys-”
"Of course. So you have no idea about houses...or just magic at all?" Draco was shocked. Magic was such a tremendous and important part of his life, he couldn't imagine not knowing about it. Harry just shrugged his shoulders. Draco couldn't believe it. The famous Harry Potter didn't know anything at all about himself or the world he was from.
Once they were mostly hidden behind the greenhouses, Harry mounted his broomstick. He hadn't actually had a class yet since his first one had been cancelled due to rain. Draco however hadn't stopped talking about Quidditch and riding a broom and Harry figured he had the general gist of it. He managed to kick off the ground well enough, as did Draco seconds later. Harry's stomach flipped around at first as he adjusted to the new sensation of not having his feet planted to the ground. It wasn't long before excitement washed away his nerves and he pulled the front of his broom up to go higher.
“I didn't kill your parents,” Black said. Harry was about to yell that he might as well have killed them by betraying them to Voldemort when Draco stepped forward.
“He mentioned possibly taking him to one of our favourite places-”
Harry chuckled nervously. “Didn’t know you were gay is all.”
“Come on, Harry, let’s go,” Draco said, turning and walking away from the house elf.
But when the weekend came around and Harry had walked into the common room Draco had been standing with Pansy and Theo looking ready to go in tight dark denim jeans and a black pea coat. He’d claimed that he needed to take a break from studying. Harry had done some fast thinking to get out of going and said he had to practice for the next quidditch game, maybe he’d go to Hogsmeade with them next time.
Harry grumbled the whole way.
Harry found himself instinctually wanting to turn to Draco to ask for his opinion but when he did he found his best mate instead preoccupied with a handful of giggling french girls.
Draco rolled his eyes, pulling the mask back in place. “Glad to hear everything is right in the world again,” he said, sarcastically.
“Don’t take your shoes off,” Pansy told them. “I’ll go tell Blaise and Adam you’re here and we can get going right away.”
“Dare.”
annoyed because i can't figure out how to keep the italics i applied to certain sentences when i write the chapters in google docs -_-
“Has the headcount come back yet? The Head boys and girls of each house did attendance did they not? Who did the monster take?” asked Madam Pomfrey.
“Lockhart.”
I believe the dementors are still searching for me, but they haven't a hope of finding me here. I am planning to allow some Muggles to glimpse me soon, a long way from Hogwarts, so that the security on the castle will be lifted.
“Possible.”
Harry snorted and stabbed at his casserole. “That’s rich coming from you.”
Harry picked up his sports bag from the bench and his broom that had been propped up against the wall. He shouldered passed Draco,  “Later-”
“He’s dead,” Harry said, choking on a sob.
“I don’t know. Maybe the dress robes my parents got you?”
Pansy led them up to her room, none of the girls she shared it with were back yet, and gestured for him to sit on her bed. He did, hesitantly, as if the bed might swallow him up. Pansy rolled her eyes to herself and knelt beside the bed. Sticking her head underneath, she peered around before spotting what she was looking for. Pansy pulled out a floral box. Sitting across from Theodore she placed it between them and took off the lid to pull out her nail kit.
“We don’t know that.”
He was so irritating. He just always had to bicker with her. Pansy stood up. “Shut up, Theodore. Come on. The kit’s up in my dorm.”
“Cut the crap, Potter,” Draco told him, impatiently. Harry pressed his lips together stubbornly.
“Has anyone ever told you that you have the most striking features?”
“What about me?” he asked, sounding defensive.
So none of his living relatives were magical. "How did you find out about Hogwarts then?"
“Never liked that prick,” Theo said happily to Harry, Draco and Blaise. “Their relationship would have never worked anyway, long distance would have been too much since he goes to school in America. Pansy told me herself, that’s why they broke up.” Theo smiled broadly. “Long distance.” He said the last words the way one might say ‘Free Firebolt’ or ‘No Homework.’ The three of them watched as Theo jogged back to the manor to grab Pany’s trunk from her and carry it to the car from her.
Harry froze with his eyes closed and Pansy stopped putting the colourful powder on his eyelids.
