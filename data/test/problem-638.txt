“I trust you” He whispered feeling incredibly tired now and he didn’t hear Draco’s reply as he drifted to sleep his dreams surprisingly free from nightmares.
“I’m reading through the potions book that Draco sent me...” He answered sheepishly and Mrs Figg smiled nodding as she pottered over to the chair and eased herself into it. “Were you sad? When you found out that you couldn’t use magic?”
?” Josephine hissed her head twisting this way and that as she tried to listen to the third female. “
“She wanted to marry and have children I wanted…Well something else…” Harry motioned vaguely with his hands before rather clumsily changing the subject. “And how are your parents?”
“Perhaps we shall, later, for now though we have an appointment at Master Pierre’s. Will you be joining us Pansy?”
“Of course, it’s a yes! You think it would be anything else?!” Remus exclaimed his amber eyes flashing with joy as he threw himself up out of the chair and into his arms. The declaration made it possible for the others in the room to speak and it was Harry who spoke first squeaking out a happy but slightly tearful
“For your project! He is quite an artist! Boy, wash your hands and come greet Master Dumbledore! He is the court advisor to his Majesty Lucius Malfoy!” Petunia said taking the bucket and grinning a grin that reminded Boy of Nimbus. Boy looked curiously around and blinked in surprise as he saw an elderly grey-haired man with a rather magnificent beard sitting resplendent in one of Petunia’s good chairs holding a delicate teacup. His eyes were a pale blue and they seemed to twinkle. What caused Boy’s surprise however wasn’t the old man but the giant of a man that was sat awkwardly beside him. Even sitting down, he was huge with untamed black hair and beard. He too was holding a teacup, but it looked more like a thimble in his giant hands. The grey-haired man smiled draining what was left of his tea before raising to his feet and bowing.
“Yes, mother, I have never felt that way before, I never thought I would want to kill...But when I saw the marks on Harry’s back, I wished that I could have killed them, am I a monster mother?”
“I need some more potions ingredients” Harry murmured lightly, the chest Severus and Remus had gotten him for Christmas had been well stocked, but he had had been using it regularly since. If it were possible for somebody to burst with pride Severus would have done so.
“Lord Potter is an extremely lucky man” The maid purred with the familiarity of having known Draco since his infancy. He tried to smile but all he managed was a grimace his heart taken by Boy and their moments together in the forest. The door to his rooms opened and his mouth swept in the large skirts of her formal dress sweeping the floor as she moved.
“Yes, Uncle Sev” Harry and Draco said together nodding quickly both knowing how delicate the brewing stage was. The man’s lips curled just a little at the nickname but he said nothing ushering them out.
“No! No he won’t! Because you won’t be going back to them! Mother and Father won’t let them! You will never have to be with them again!”
“You won’t, you and Draco have always meant to be Harry. You just took the long way in getting there.” Luna reassured him placing the cup of sweetened tea down in front of him and taking out her normal tin of biscuits that she kept just for him. Honey with little chocolate drops in them. The twins tried to grab at them, but Luna quickly picked them both up and set them down in the play pen with a collection of stuffed toys. As Harry was just polishing off his second biscuit a magical typewriter was placed down on the table and Luna cracked her knuckles. Her dreamy expression becoming serious. “Are you ready to work some more on our book?”
“Blaise, Theo, what an unexpected pleasure to see you both” Draco said smiling as he kept his hands against Harry’s. “Hadrian, may I present my friends? Heir Blaise Zabini and Heir Theodore Nott. Blaise, Theo, this is my cousin, Hadrian Black”
“With you as a father I am sure she will be” Narcissa smiled again sucking her courage into herself and holding her back straight and proud thinking of Draco and Harry. They would be at the game now, plenty of time for her to see her sister and then return home to recover from the aftershocks of exposure to the monsters of Azkaban. The tall black gate covered with iron spikes loomed ahead and Kingsley sent a spell to the centre of it forcing it to open by invisible hands. More Dementors were within and Narcissa almost wilted until she thought of Harry and the pain the boy was in. It had to be connected to Voldemort and if there was a person alive that would know it would be her sister. She needed to be here, to do this, to help Harry. “What is her name?”
I know I said plot but to be honest I’ve been having a hard couple of weeks, (who hasn’t) my boyfriend passed away suddenly a week ago due to complications with asthma and covid. My whole life has just fallen apart. I can’t even attend his funeral because of local lockdowns and restrictions and honestly I’ve felt like a zombie writing fanfiction seemed pointless but then I was hit with the need to write fluff and maybe pull myself out of my depression.
“I will have to walk my horse instead of riding him but yes, thank-you, Boy” Draco felt foolish at calling the boy, Boy, but it seemed as though the Green eyed beauty was used to it. He smiled again his head cocking to one side his green eyes flashing brightly.
I have a question…A small one that won’t really affect the story until later, but I have been playing around with the idea in my head…I have Chuck in the story from Supernatural and I am thinking of bringing Dean, Castiel, Sam and basically a bunch of others as exchange students. I have a whole plot thought out that Bobby is the head of the American school and instead of a frankly stupidly risky way of bringing the schools together in the Triwizard cup they do an exchange programme…Honestly having the characters wouldn’t change anything it would just give me a chance to show my love for Dean/Cas and maybe help my Chuck reconnect with his son…Anywho as I say it won’t matter would just love your opinion…
“Anything else?” Narcissa asked her eyes lighting as they both ignored Lucius. “Is the gossip true? Are you courting Harry Potter?”
“Hey, sorry we’re late!” Nino said pulling Draco out of his daze and he cleared his throat flushing just a little when Harry looked at him with a curious eyebrow lifted. “This is my friend Masaki Aiba! Ai-baka, these are my students. Harry and Draco”
“I went to get drinks and when I turned around you were gone. Hey boys” Sho smiled handing over the goblet of fruit punch. The twins, still grateful that they had not only been able to go to a game but hang out with the team, grinned at the reporter bobbing their heads in greeting.
“I’ve never been abroad before, or even on Holiday. The Dursley’s would go and I would be left with Mrs Figg or left with my Uncle if only Aunt Petunia and Dudley went” Harry said somewhat nervously as the doors to the Chateau opened aided by two elves who were turning the large handles on either side.
“Thank-you Aunt Cissy” Harry smiled taking the small sweet he was offered and popping it into his mouth. The burst of sugary flavour swirled around his tongue as he sucked listening to the conversation Draco was having with the half-goblin.
“It’s not that simple, I think mother and Uncle Remus have had a hand in changing it around” Draco sighed with frustration not wanting to admit that he had only ever really made it to the centre once. Fred and George were already wanting to just go through the trees instead of around them. Thankfully, there was nothing dangerous in the maze, but it was rather frustrating even in the day.
“I don’t want to be like the Dursley’s or the people that said that people like you are disgusting…”
“Catch it Harry!” Draco shouted moving his broom before throwing the ball and Harry moved with ease swooping and grabbing it away from Lucius before immediately throwing it back.
The little bat heard his cry and paused flapping his wings so he could stay hovering above his head. You are Boris the Brave?” It asked startling poor Boris who hadn’t known bats could speak. “Y-Yes, I am Boris…But I’m not Brave! I am a coward!” He said looking at the bat who was now buzzing around his head. It wasn’t how he had imagined it at all. Instead of something dangerous, the bat was rather cute with silky black wings and a fuzzy soft belly.
“That was Dumbledore’s bright idea” Mrs Figg didn’t sound as though she agreed with this Dumbledore and her face reflected that by scrunching up her nose while rolling her eyes. “He said that your aunt was the only family you had left and that he had left a note, a note? Albus Dumbledore might be the lightest wizards of our age but he isn’t the brightest, how could you explain all that in a note? I tried to get him to take you away, I’ve told him time and time again...But...It’s okay, you’ll be at Hogwarts from next year away from that worthless lot. I’m sorry for the part I played but I was worried, I thought if you came here and enjoyed it they would stop you coming. They like to sap away an pleasure you might have...”
“Eeep! If youse is sures! Thank-you Master Lucius!” Jinx beamed happily her nose almost brushing against the floor as she bobbed a bow.
“I was, I’m sorry. It was my first day of lessons. I will take you out before we go to dinner.” Harry promised and the snaked flicked its tongue for a moment brushing against him before it seemed to nod in agreement its voice muffled by his shirt when it answered sleepily.
“Perhaps, sadly there is sometimes even limits to magic but I’m sure the healer will be able to have a look, so should I send for the healer tomorrow...Dear the floo” Narcissa sighed and Harry almost screamed as he looked at the fire and saw the disembodied head of a sallow man with a large hook nose and dark eyes looking out at them.
“Yes, Mr Shurley’s mother Loretta-Amara Shurley is from a long line of seers. It was what helped the family on the stock market. It was well known that Carver Edlund’s son inherited the gift. For a man like Mr Shurley I can easily imagine that he was disturbed by such visions”
Hedwig let out a loud indignant screech pulling him from the happy fog of sleep with light streaming in from the curtains which were magically timed to open. The owl was sitting on the bedpost her yellow eyes watching him as she did a strange dance and clicked her beak. Harry grabbed his glasses sleepily, his hair sticking up at all angles as he scrambled out of the blankets and crawled over the bed. “What’s up, Girl?” He asked in confusion the owl letting out another screech before looking to the window where a brown barn owl was trying to get in. There was a parcel clutched in its talons and Harry hurried to the window and threw it open allowing the Owl to fly in and almost drop in a heap on top of Draco. The package only about the same size as a ring box hit the blonde in the forehead pulling him out of sleep.
“Because…He said that I must have cheated on my homework because all the answers were the same as Dudley. Dudley had copied mine, I didn’t cheat” He growled, it had been the last time he had truly tried on a piece of homework. Until then he had foolishly believed that if he got good grades the Dursley’s might like him. It had only gotten him into more trouble, more so when the teacher had accused him of turning the wig blue though he had no way of proving it was him.
“Thank-you, Uncle Luci” Harry cleared his throat quickly feeling a lump rising up in the back of his throat. His eyes itched and he had to blink rapidly to stop himself from crying. Lucius fluffed his hair with his fingers giving him a smile as he cleared his own throat.
“Yes, and I am very proud of him, but Draco has not had the life you have had, Harry, I hope that his magic as never once felt that it had to defend itself against me. I would never profess to be the worlds greatest father, but I have never willingly hurt my child” Lucius almost growled his grey eyes, so much like Draco’s flashing with anger that he didn’t manage to control “You cannot compare yourself with Draco. If you must make a comparison between yourself and another, you should instead think of yourself against Severus. His life was as bad as your own and he struggled greatly with wandless magic. It upset him, but it made him try harder. Would you think of him as any less of a wizard?”
“Then I will write to your parents, you may gather your things and be on the first train to London in the morning” Sinistra said with a shrug taking up her Goblet and having a sip. Harry looked over to Slytherin house noting how, if he would even end up there, Ron had thoroughly isolated himself from any friendships in that house. “For now, sit with the house that you have been assigned…”
He ran down the steps two at a time, his confidence in his belonging here having grown so much he didn’t jump at shadows any more or think that the Malfoy’s wanted to get rid of him. He saw a few house elves as he ran and waved at a few of the paintings who were more than happy to wave back. Even Uriel, Draco’s five-time great grandfather who always muttered about proper pure blood behaviour and how he didn’t have it. Still he was an interesting old painting and his eyes were as green as Harry’s. He knocked politely on the drawing room door and waited for the smooth ‘come’ from Lucius. It didn’t come, instead his Dad’s voice hummed gently
“I’m here, I’m with you. But I am disappointed. It’s your birthday you said that you would give me a name, but I already have one so now I don’t have a gift…”
With another jolt he scene was once again different. He was cowering his hands over his head as the belt came down around his ears with a crack. It cut the side of his cheek, slicing a chunk of skin away on the buckle. He didn’t even know what he had done to upset Vernon. He had just been talking about a dream he’d had about a woman laughing and waving a stick to cause bubbles to drop down around him. It had been a nice dream but Uncle Vernon had been worse than ever. He had thrown him across the floor and ranted and raved about stupid fairy tales and things about Sissies. He was still saying nasty things while the belt came down again hitting him over the shoulders.
“We shall be attending Hogwarts together next year father, and I discovered that he knows nothing of the magical world barring what I have told him and a squib”
“Please, I’m just Harry.” Harry said awkwardly rubbing the back of his neck. He didn’t scratch, but it was a painfully close thing. His skin seemed to be prickling with the recently forgotten nerves and he was glad when, as always, Draco came to save him.
“He will be fines, Little Master Harry! Youse just focuses on eaten those sandwiches!” Jinx said moving to the large range and using magic to set down a large saucepan. Harry munched his way through the first sandwich and probably would have stopped at that if Figgin hadn’t pushed another into his hand before wandering off to bark a few orders to some of the younger elves.
“I am not one to share my memories with others, but a simple apology would not be adequate very well. You do surprise me though, this protective nature you have found for Harry”
“Awesome! Okay, you are Alpha group 1-A” She said pointing to a group of four Hufflepuff girls, “I want you to write that, and your names down on the top of this piece of paper...You are beta group 1-A... Same deal on this paper...” Nino moved through the groups listing their names and giving them a large piece of paper, which seemed to crackle with magic as Harry reached out to touch it when it was finally their turn. “Sigma group 1-A... I want you to take a look at your group mates and introduce yourselves to the three people who are going to help you pass this first year of my class. Even with all the magic in the world the best possible defence is good friends, good partners who will be able to help you...From now until the end of the school year these are three people you will sit with for each and every one of my classes. So now I will rearrange the classroom, if you would all just step to the edge of the room...”
Draco turned to the double doors of the ballroom trying his best not to scowl when he saw the advisor dressed in garish orange robes complete with cap that had a deep red tassel. Dumbledore’s eyes were twinkling more than ever in the lights of the ballroom and he looked for all the world like a triumphant king rather than court advisor. Draco couldn’t see his betrothed at all but he could tell that he was there from the way people were whispering and bowing. Dumbledore stopped in front of him, bowing low before stepping to the side his arm outstretched
“They aren’t friends Harry, just people I know, and you don’t have to be sorry, you are my best friend!” Draco assured him honestly. Theo and Blaise had been surprised by everything and it would be all around noble circles by teatime but Draco didn’t give a toss, Harry was his friend and he would always put his friend first.
“I think we have got most of it down now, just got to flesh it out! It’s so exciting to have a book from a Dragon’s POV!” She said as Rolf, ever the loving and devoted husband, moved around them to make dinner.
“I promise that no harm will come to Harry” Severus swore masking his own nerves a lot better now that he had to calm somebody else’s. Narcissa didn’t look much calmer but still she gave him a thin smile and a nod.
“Mr Greenfield?” Harry gasped in surprise as they approached the table in the furthest corner of the inn recognising the sandy haired man waiting nervously as the kind student teacher who had allowed him to sit with him in breaks. Harry had requested that Snape cast a privacy charm over the table, there weren’t many people in but that didn’t mean he was comfortable in having them listen in to his conversations.
“Little Master Harry haded a badden dreams” Jinx whispered in a very elf like whisper which was pretty loud. “Master Lucius helpen him but fells to sleepen heres”
“Parents must always embarrass their children,  no matter how old they get...Tormuld clearly loves  him”
“I’m sorry about your friend” Harry whispered not knowing what else to say about that statement. She didn’t seem to think that he was being a baby and that made him feel a little bit better.
“I remembered meeting your mother once. It was not long after you had been born before you had gone into hiding. We were in a bookshop in Diagon alley. Draco was fussing and nothing I could do would settle him. Narcissa had gone into the depths of the bookshop leaving me alone with a fussing baby. I was near at my wits end, Harry, and then your mother appeared” Lucius told him keeping his hand tight about his own but using only gentle pressure and Harry blinked down at it listening to the story he was being told. “You were in a sling around her middle even then you had the shock of black hair and the most startling green eyes. She looked at me with eyes so much like your own and then looked at Draco announcing that he had wind and that if I wanted him to settle I should burp him. Well, as you can imagine I was baffled she sighed and took matters into her own hands. We, at the time, would be said to be enemies and yet she helped me settle a fussy Draco. She laughed when he burped and brought sick upon her shoulder. Once Draco was calm she handed him back fixed you to rights once more and then went on her way. It was a simple act one i had forgotten until I sat and thought about it today. It holds no great importance but I thought I would share it so you might know a little more of your mother...”
“I’m glad. As did I. I admit that it has become something of a guilty pleasure of mine, though I am a rather sentimental old fool and enjoy the art of puppetry”
“True, however I am also the man marrying the best of the Marauders in the not too distant future. I fear my future husband may be rubbing off on me”
“I’m not going into a house before you sort Harry, when you have sorted him, then you can put me in the same house. We are not being separated…”
“The will is exactly as it should be Albus. As for Lily’s spell woven into the paper completely fine and above board. It is her magical signature, I have no doubt about that. I would recognise it anywhere. She had a head for spell crafting. I had often hoped she would study for her mastery...” Filius blinked and then blew his overly large nose overcome with grief for a moment. He pushed is large poker dotted handkerchief back into his pocket and gave a watery smile. “In my opinion everything should be fine”
“Of course, how else could I bore you? Are you not going to introduce me to your friend?” She said grinning at Harry as she looked down on him. Like Draco she was taller than he was and Harry tried to stretch out his back wanting to appear taller as Draco gave an apologetic smile.
“But she has not stopped our Dragon from speaking to the boy and has even allowed him use of her owl”
“You must be excited, Draco, for the start of the new Quidditch season, who do you think will lift the cup? Will the canons get their shot this year?” Magenta said cutting over her husband who was happily talking about how many cats a Spanish heiress had and what they had done to the new carpet that was made of silk and cost a fortune.
The man looked like a thin father Christmas. He was wearing scarlet robes with golden stitching in swirling patterns around the hem. The whole thing was edged with white fur and he had a long white beard that was tucked into his belt. Small golden glasses were perched on a long thin nose that seemed to have been broken at some point. His hair was long, even longer than Lucius’s and was as white as his beard. A tall pointed hat was set on his head and blue eyes twinkled out as he gave a smile that should have been warm but to Harry, who had seen many smiles from Vernon and none of them friendly, it seemed calculating.
“Prison?” Harry repeated the word slowly and carefully his mouth suddenly feeling very dry while Narcissa played around with one of her curls that had escaped from the hairstyle she had put it in. She seemed to be distracted and Harry thought she must be thinking about losing her head and having boils.
“Dragons?” Harry squeaked loudly his eyes going to the green section on the map. The mountain that he had just seen was in the middle of that section and he felt his mouth go dry. “I can’t believe dragons are real”
“Please don’t say Malfoy!” Ron whined and Harry blinked almost afraid he had said the name out loud or something.
“Dad, Moony? Can I come in?” Harry asked rapping his knuckles on Moony’s bedroom door. The pair knew that he was coming but he was half-hoping that they wouldn’t answer. The door opened almost immediately, and Severus was standing there in only his black trousers and shirt. It was still strange seeing his dad out of his robe even though he was seeing it often these days.
“Ai means love in Japanese and Baka means idiot…Ai-Baka…Basically Lovable Idiot. Masaki is one of the best guys I know, but he is an utter idiot” Nino happily laughed her own honey eyes dancing as she looked at the back of her friend. “He’s had the name since forever. But he is like my goofy older brother”
“Black-Potter, Professor, young Harry is ward of the Malfoy family” Narcissa corrected smoothly and unlike anyone else that had been told that the tiny teacher seemed to accept it all with a smile. He bowed low and hummed;
“I am, what am I meant to say? We will be dead, shuffled off the mortal plane, it’s not gonna bother us...”
I’m alive! And back…Seriously I am so so sorry for being away for so long. Covid-19 is not a joke guys, it is absolutely awful, and I was one of the lucky ones. I have scaring on my lungs and am still recovering. It’s slow but I’m getting there, they still aren't sure of the long term damage but my doctor and nurses were absolutely amazing. Please listen to the advice being given and stay safe.
“We cannot take his past, Remus, however we are doing everything we can to ensure he is happy and healthy. I would feel better if I spoke with his mind healer, I have a strong suspicion that this is not something he has revealed but it is something that he should speak about”
“Thank you for the tickets” Harry said automatically and Sho shrugged rubbing the back of his head with his fingers. A shy, pleased smile spread over his lips and Harry wondered what Nino had told him about him.
“Remember boys the promises made to the Yule log are to be kept” Lucius hummed “So I resolve to be the best father and uncle I can be, as well as the best husband”
“Maybe he’s at the park?” Piers Polkiss suggested his ratty voice close to the Bush and quickly Harry slammed his hand over his mouth and nose so he wouldn’t accidentally breathe too loudly and alert the gang to his hiding spot.
“What your parents meant when they said that I was the reason the dark lord was after them” Severus whispered and Harry felt something niggling in his stomach at the words. He was curious, he had to admit that but if it was too much for Severus then he didn’t want to hear it now. “I was in Hogsmeade one night when I happened upon Dumbledore in one of the pubs” Severus said quickly before Harry could tell him that it could wait “He was interviewing a new divination teacher. I was so far gone with my belief in the dark lord that I listened. Most of it was absolute rubbish, I was pretty sure she couldn’t foresee snow in the artic but then, matters changed. Her voice changed and she spoke of one that would bring about the fall of the Dark Lord. I went to him, I told him what I had heard. He determined that it would be the Potters. You see Harry I am the reason you don’t have your parents...” Harry felt tears running down his face. Pain like nothing he had experience before was stabbing at his heart. His grip around the man stiffened and Severus felt it his voice low and broken as he gasped out “How they can say they forgive me...Recoil in horror Harry, hate me as I deserve...”
“Its not wrong…Not really but it doesn’t make the same strength of potion same as the pine needles, if you only add six you make a smoother potion, and it tastes better if you add a pinch of nutmeg, Dad always does it for me”
“Very well, Chuck” Lucius winced as though it was painful to say the nickname. “We are grateful that you could come, my nephew Harry has been wanting to learn the guitar for some time however it is not an instrument that is common in British pureblood circles”
“Nino gave us some, but nothing else yet.” Harry answered genuinely looking forward to the homework Nino had set. She had given all the groups different dark creatures to study. Sigma had been given Kelpies and Harry was looking forward to studying them.
“Harry, you know that you can tell us anything and we won’t be angry. But we can’t help if you don’t tell us”
“Thoughtless of him, Harry has been through enough today. An owl so we might prepare him would have been better, how may we help you Mr Jenkins?”
“Conner O’Sullivan, Aileen McCarthy, Caolan Murphy, Caitlyn Murphy…” The names continued with the crowd screaming louder each time and Harry supposed that they were the home team. They buzzed around in shades of green and blue, their movements on their brooms so skilled that Harry was left with stolen breath. A rainbow burst into the stadium and then faded away as the announcer started on the names of the Hummingbirds. “Chai Charoen Saeueng, Emiko Umeda, Daitan Yamada, Yubi Kazumi, Maki Honami…”
“Yeah, it’s from the twins from yesterday. They were sorry for what they did. They said Uncle Sev had told them off”
“I know, you do, I feel very safe here” As Harry spoke the door between his room and Draco’s opened and Draco came in in his PJ’s with Narcissa following. The pair had been out for the evening at a gala they had forgotten until the last minute. Draco had stubbornly refused to go, never quite reaching the stomping his feet stage Dudley would often use, but it had been no good. “Welcome back! Did you have fun?”
“Yes, your wardrobe, it is pretty much empty now but I am sure mother has plans to take you shopping as soon as possible so it will be full before we know it” Draco spoke cheerfully he always enjoyed shopping for new clothes but he didn’t know if Harry would enjoy it half so much. A creep of shame filled as he looked down at his body only to look both confused and surprised. His hands gripped at the green cotton fabric of the pyjamas he was wearing. “Mother changed into a pair of my pyjamas. She had to shrink them a little but green looks good on you, it brings out your eyes”
“Good, he should have boxed their ears, scaring you like that” Draco huffed scowling out at the world as he stretched back into the pillows. Harry smiled the strange fluttery feeling that came from having a friend that cared about him never not taking him by surprise. Draco gave a loud yawn and then threw back the cover hopping easily out of the bed he stretched out his back scratching his stomach “I’m going to go shower and change. How are you feeling?”
“Sleep well, Harry, Draco, Jinx will watch over you, if you should need anything” Lucius said carefully and Harry allowed himself to sink into the warm soft bed wondering if a beating from his aunt or uncle had gone too far and this was his heaven. If it was he was happy with that he decided happily falling into a happy sleep, with a warm arm wrapped around his waist, where he dreamt of a different woman, one with red hair and eyes like his own holding him against her breast as she sang a song in his ear and told him stories of magic.
“Go Harry!” Draco said circling him on his own broom and although Harry wanted to follow suit he made sure to listen to Lucius.
“Your parents names were James and Lily...” She said leaning forward and patting him on the hand. The names rolled around in his mind “I have a photo of them...Hang about a bit...” She jumped up from the chair with more agility than he would have expected from somebody of her age. She moved over to the far side of the attic where she had a small wooden desk that held an impossible amount of drawers. “Ah-hah! Here it is, I knew I had one!” She hobbled back to her chair and sat back down handing him over a black and white moving photograph of a man and a woman with a small baby. It appeared to have been taken from a newspaper and Harry gazed at it hungrily his eyes watching as the woman grinned lifting the baby Harry’s hand and getting him to wave. “They were a very happy couple”
“It’s okay! It was his own fault he was doing a handstand and Masaki is completely fine now and back to terrorising the wildlife of Asia” Nino smirked just a little but Harry had a feeling that she was in part telling the truth. “He is a magizoologist and I think part time clown and full time idiot. But I remember how much pain he was in, you are a brave kid, Harry” She reached out and ruffled his hair causing the curls to stick up at odd angles.
Once everyone had done as instructed Nino waved her hand and silently cast a spell to send all the stools and tables around the room rearranging them until two tables were grouped together with seats for four. Above each table was the name of the group and without questioning it Harry and Draco made their way to the Sigma table. It was only when the whispers started that Harry realised how strange it must have looked for the others for Nino to not only wandlessly cast a spell but also wordlessly. They had grown immune to it during their lessons but Harry could see how excited it made other people including Chao-Xing and Alice as they joined them.
“That sounds…Boring” Draco said his pointed nose wrinkling, and Harry nodded biting the head off the snake and settled himself against his headboard. Draco let out a sigh lifting an orange which was decorated with cloves and holy with a small candle stuck in the top. “I prefer our festival”
“I’m sorry Draco” He whispered a shaky hand reaching out to trace over the scars on his torso and Draco let him for a moment and then picked up his hand by the wrist bringing it to his mouth so he could kiss the palm before putting it down to his crotch which was rock hard and almost pulsating under the boxers he was wearing. “Silk Draco?”
“Harry, you’re late this morning” The wolf smiled his face older than his years but kind as he carefully pulled out the blackberry thorn and wiped the blood away with a handkerchief.
“No, but you’re sort of pretty as one...I mean to some guys...” To everyone close to them at the table they were shocked to hear that muffled confession coming from the mouth of the red head. Harry included. He had been told that he had improved over the year, he had finally gone to the mediwitch and had been given a series of potions to combat the malnutrition that he had suffered. As a result, he had grown a few inches and had filled into his body. With the potions his eyesight had improved and he no longer needed to wear his glasses. In the summer he had asked Mrs Weasley to teach him some spells to mend and fix Dudley’s cast offs but he still didn’t understand why he was suddenly being called pretty.
“Harry, you know it’s not normal for a boy to sleep in a cupboard right? Haven’t you told anybody before?”
“Norning...Arry...” He said with a moan stretching out his back. “Dobby causing trouble again? Poor sod, I really wish there was something we could do. He’s always been a little odd but these days...anyway ready to visit Paris?”
“Harry, are you still…Uncomfortable with Remus and Sev?” Draco asked getting him to hover at the farthest edge of the pitch and Harry shook his head spluttering,
“Come my Dragon, your father will meet us in Surrey” She said and Draco nodded smiling somewhat nervously as they left the manor and walked to the edge of the wards. His mother took his hand and he quickly shut his eyes as he was suddenly pulled through a drain plug. His whole body seemed to be cramped and folded before being put back to rights. His stomach swirling and churning he stumbled away from his mother and heaved over a small holly bush while Narcissa rubbed his back until he was recovered. “Are you okay my dragon?”
“Yes, I believe she did...” Severus’ eyes were wet again as he lifted out a small separate box that had the golden words for the God Father printed on the front. Opening it up Harry heard Severus gasp loudly as he lifted a vial with red liquid from the inside along with a lock of hair tied with a blue ribbon, a stamped foot print of a baby’s foot and a small photograph with the words ‘Quod verum estin nomine filii me est; Hadrien Junius Peverell’ “My true name is Hadrien Junius Peverell, Harry your mother has left me everything I need to make a blood adoption potion...”
“Pants, we spoke yesterday” Draco sighed pulling himself out of her octopus grip and rolling his eyes. “Through the Floo remember?”
“I said I would be with Harry, no matter what. I’m really surprised by Pans, who would have thought she would be in Gryffindor?”
“Not only real but numerous. I believe the ones here are the Common Welsh Greens. Do you wish to go there first?”
“Pleased to meet you!” Masaki spoke with a breathy husky sort of voice that seemed to radiate with the same joy that was reflected in his eyes. He bobbed a small bow while Nino introduced him to his and Harry’s parents.
“I’m glad I don’t know” Harry said, his cheeks bright red, and Remus barked out a laugh his arm sliding around his shoulders as he tucked his arm around Severus’ waist. The potion master stopped smiling his body going rigid at the action but then he slowly allowed himself to relax and mumbled something about his reputation again. Remus soon moved both his arms as they started walking down the path that would take them to the Chimera and Draco but even Harry could tell that Severus relaxing the way he had at the touch was a step in the right direction for their relationship.
“Yes. Uncle Luci didn’t tell us what happened at the school. I guess that most people will believe what Dumbledore says and I will end up back at the Dursley’s” Cursing the twins for bringing up such painful things when they were about to go watch Quidditch Draco hugged Harry tightly and shook his head.
“We should. I have already decided that I would like to co-adopt Harry, but as secondary parent. You will be primary…”
Draco took the stairs two at a time almost giddy with excitement as he headed to the breakfast room. The manor was large but he knew all of the short cuts to make the trip from his bedroom in the east wing to the breakfast room on the south side in record time. He had only expected his mother to be there sitting as she always was in the chair against the window her pale skin bathed in light so he was caught short when he saw his father sat at the head of the table eating a muffin while reading the Daily Prophet. The scent of expensive coffee was in the air and Draco saw that his father Lord Lucius Malfoy wasn’t wearing an outer robe but instead was wearing only breeches, a crisp white shirt held together with a tie, that held a silver pin in the style of a serpent. Narcissa was sat where she normally was and she greeted him with a smile.
“Harry...Are there any partridges on that tree?” Hermione asked softly sounding very close to squeaking with excitement like she would in class when she knew an answer to a question and nobody else did.
For the story…I hated Merlin being a student in canon. I am a practicing Pagan/Druid and Merlin is sort of like our version of Jesus so making him a student of Hogwarts irritated me so with the power of fanfiction I can change it.
“Oh…Interesting…A Malfoy, you should be in Slytherin, yes, in another time, another place…So easy…You still have that cunning, that drive for power…Slytherin would be your true…”
“You…Um…You never suspected before, that you were…Queer?” Draco watched Harry flinch at the word or perhaps the question, but he shrugged slowly and pulled at his long hair saying;
“Oh, I read them, Pants, but it was rather dry going. Did you have to talk about every cafe you have visited and every drink?” Draco sighed heavily and Pansy let out a laugh her eyebrow lifting up her face. She wasn’t as beautiful as Narcissa or even Draco but there was something about her that was pretty when she smiled even though she had an upturned nose.
“We will have a great many holidays! You will come with us to Japan, won’t he mother? And wherever else you would like to go...Is there anywhere you have ever dreamed of going?”
“Yup, well two of them…Harry and Draco…” Nino moved quickly her hands coming to rest on each of their shoulders and Harry swallowed nervously but the man, Sho, smiled in a friendly way his eyes genuinely warm. He dipped his head in a polite bow and then grinned a little wider as he motioned to Nino.
It was mostly simple, getting to know you, stuff, name, birthday, favourite games and music and soon the class had started talking with the questions being asked around the little tables. Harry pulled the paper closer to himself and then asked the first question his eyes landed on.
“Thank-you for coming, Professor, Draco has not stopped talking about you all summer. Thank-you for agreeing to teach Harry as well. You remember Draco’s uncle, Severus Snape. Severus this is Professor Kazumiko Ninomiya”
“My hero!” Harry almost drunk giggled as Lucius playfully three several snowballs onto his back instead of Harry. The Malfoy’s and the Potter-Snapes had been playing a rather long game of snowball for most of the afternoon and without warming charms Draco was sure he wouldn’t be able to feel his toes. As it was, he was feeling incredibly warm and he grinned rolling off his friend before ducking into their fort which was a carefully constructed igloo. The rules of the game stated that once in the base they were free from attack.
“Hello? Hello? Testing, one, two...JAMES!” Harry jerked in his chair at the sound of the voices coming from the paper in front of him. One sounded young and male while the other was frustrated but fond and female and he knew that these were the voices of his parents. “Sorry, Sorry, Lilis, but I never know if this is working”
“Of course, Harry, if I may be so bold, I would like to send for a healer to see you tomorrow. I believe that you may be malnourished and we should have your eyes seen too. Such pretty eyes shouldn’t be hid, behind glasses” Narcissa smiled and Harry had great difficulty trying not to blush at the statement. He had always been told his eyes were freaky. They were too green, too unnerving, too freakish. “You, you can fix my eyes?”
Urgh...Narcissa is so totally OOC sorry >.< but I really wanted her to be sweet in private in contrast to what she is in public >.<
“I need no name but if it pleases you, you can name me” Boy smiled happily, and he was delighted in the blush that Draco gave. His pale skin made it easy to show his emotions and Boy was always happy to see it. Once he had gathered enough firewood they walked back to the edge of the forest. They never travelled too far into the Forbidden Forest knowing that a great evil lurked in the centre, but sometimes, before he had met Draco, Boy had wondered if he should just walk to the centre and give himself to Voldemort. Now, with Draco visiting him, he thought he could take anything his master’s could and would give him. “I will see you again soon, Draco” He said as they once again reached Nimbus. Severus flew from his perch on Draco’s shoulder and settled back in his tree while Moony pressed against his leg. “And I will see you both again soon”
“Okay, it’s okay, Harry. I will just need to rethink, but I knew a guy like you when I was at school. Though his magic would only appear when he was happy. If he had the smallest upset, he couldn’t do magic…”
“Thank you, Hadrian” Severus murmured in a low voice that indicated he was embarrassed that his gentle side was being exposed in front of his classmates. Harry flashed him a grin his head cocking ever so slightly to one side. “If any of you weren’t listening my son is correct. The textbook isn’t wrong as such, following it will leave you with a perfectly serviceable potion however it will not produce the best potion you may wish for. Although you should always learn the basics first you may find yourself learning to adjust your potion to better suit yourselves, though be warned you should always know the properties of the ingredients you are using, why is that Hadrian?”
“It’s not your fault, the Malfoy’s and Weasley’s have never been on the best of terms after all. Harry, it’s time for your vitamins.” Draco reminded him and Harry sighed pulling the small vial of greenish blue liquid from the depths of his robe. Although he was of his potions for the most part, they hadn’t been able to fix everything and he suffered with pernicious anaemia and would need to have B12 for the rest of his life. He drank it slowly glad that his dad had fixed the taste and it didn’t just taste like he was drinking blood or rusty nails. He had just finished when the door to the carriage opened again this time to reveal the trolley witch. They bought a little of everything and shared it between each other enjoying the rest of the trip. George and Fred waved them goodbye at some point, saying they were gonna sit with their year mates, while the new first years waited with a mix of excitement and fear for what was going to come. They almost jumped out of their seats when a voice announced that it was time for them to change into their school robes and that Hogsmeade station wasn’t too far away. Ron had never come back to the carriage so his trunk was left undisturbed and Harry wondered if he would have time to change but then forgot about him as Draco clutched his hand.
“You will be fine, Harry, your dad will be there, if you need him for any reason at all you go to him, okay?” Remus told him gently, the werewolf seemingly reading his mind, though Harry knew that he couldn’t. Severus had trained him well to block his mind from all kinds of attacks.
“Uncle Severus is nothing if not efficient, imagine that he would have already started working on the potions that he thought you would need the moment he left. He says that he isn’t a healer but he knows as much as any healer” Draco explained as they left the bathroom with his nameless owl coming to rest on his shoulder once more. Her beak clicked his hair and his ear in an affectionate way though it was slightly painful against his lobe when she dug too deeply.
“Yes, she did, with the help of the Spring bride she learned that even in the dark of winter there is light and beauty. She married the Autumn knight, the twin of the spring bride, and they had the first child of magic. They were neither man nor woman beautiful to behold. That is who your costume is. The Fae child” Remus smiled approvingly at the costume “Your designer chose well the costume suits you”
Harry moaned louder and harder until he came shooting his seed over Draco’s hand and the shower wall. His entire body shuddered with the force of his orgasm his arse clenching and unclenching around the cock that was still pumping into him as Draco chased his own orgasm which wasn’t too far behind. He pulled out at the last minute and then angled his cock until ropes of white cum were splashed over the buttocks. The feeling wasn’t unpleasant and Harry moaned again as Draco pressed his forehead in between his shoulder blades sucking in a breath.
“…I see…Another death eaters brat” Bridget looked extremely unhappy her eyes moving over Harry’s face and Draco was instantly at his defence. His slender fingers curling protectively around his hand. His head tilted mimicking the stance that his father used when he was about to do battle with an idiot from the ministry. Pansy and the twins were also looking like they were ready to defend him. Seamus didn’t notice that anything was amiss however and was practically buzzing with excitement as they got closer to the teams.
“You did not want to think of such things, it is after all the moment you truly believed you lost your friend”
“Yeah, it happened every so often, I didn’t know why, mostly they would just nod or wave?” Harry explained trying to remember the faces of every one of those people, but it was impossible, it had only been brief greetings or sightings, and he didn’t think that any of those would give him the same sense of familiarity as the professor had just done. “The Dursley’s would shoo them off or drag me away. Normally they ended up locking me in my cupboard for it…”
“You’re welcome Harry, I will keep your letter for you and talk to your aunt about getting you to ‘help me’” The old woman eased herself out of her chair and very reluctantly Harry followed suit his hand going to the collection of books that had been given to him. He had had read through a few of them but he wanted to read more but he knew that he couldn’t take them with him.
After that day Draco would sneak to the forest every chance he got calling out for Boy and spending hours in his company. Boy would get him to help gather firewood, wash clothes, or gather fruits and Draco would teach him to reach and write using a stick in the mud. His days with Boy were becoming his best though he couldn’t help but notice that his friend often wore the marks of abuse on his skin and the chores always seemed harsh for somebody so fragile. Draco thought that if he could, he would take Boy to the palace and treasure him and have people take care of him.
“It isn’t all that interesting, but you will enjoy yourself at the party. After all, all our friends will be there. Oh! We should ask Mother if we can go to France instead of Diagon for our costumes! they have the best designers and I want to be a Pirate!”
“Harry dear have some butterscotch” Narrcissa hummed as they watched the clock. Dumbledore had been summoned only ten minutes after Narcissa, Draco, and Jinx had arrived and Tormuld knew for certain he had received he summons but he was making them wait. Lucius had said hat it was a tactic to try and gain the upper hand in the situation and make them nervous and Harry had to admit that it would have worked if not for Draco holding tightly to one hand while Jinx patted him gently on the knee with her long gnarled fingers. She was making soothing cooing noises while Draco asked Tormuld politely about the axes and the names etched on them.
“I am a werewolf. He didn’t outright say it in so many words, but it was implied that if I didn’t side with him in this matter I would be declared a dark creature and that by having me on your side it would be proof that you are making Harry the next dark lord”
“Hullo Harry, it seems you remember me” The man smiled from under a scrappy moustache that matched the colour of his hair perfectly. Harry felt deeply confused but he was matched in that by the way Severus was looking between them. His black hairs were unfathomable as always but his tone was light as he said softly;
“Good morning, Pants” He said his voice thick with the fringes of sleep. He had never meant to start using the same nickname as Draco but over the last few months it had fallen easily from his lips and Pansy didn’t seem to care. She grinned wide and pushed herself in between Draco and Harry as was the norm these days and curled her arm around his waist ignoring Draco who was grumbling as he was sleeping.
“If I may, I couldn’t spend a moment longer with Roman, why does mother enjoy the company of such dullards. Daddy isn’t much better, he is always chasing boys half his age!” Pansy took Draco’s other arm in her own her eyes rolling slowly.
“I’m not surprised, I was a great confidant of both Lord and Lady Potter” Dumbledore reached over the desk and pressed his wand to the wax seal on the envelope and Harry felt his heart sink to the pit of his stomach. The wax hissed and bubbled and then slowly popped off the yellowed parchment paper. The letter twitched and jerked for a moment and then rose up from the table where it formed into a pair of lips.
The last thing in the box was a thick looking envelope with a wax seal over the flap. The imprint in the centre was of a dragon and Harry smiled running his finger over it before he lifted it up and pulled out a slip of folded paper. It was written in the same hand as the front of the package and he carefully opened it out and started reading.
“How do I look?” Harry asked Moony and Severus nervously playing around with the wedding suit. It was both his birthday and the day he was to marry Draco. His stomach was fluttering with nerves, but he knew that they would vanish when he was finally in front of Draco. Moony lifted his head from his paws his amber eyes giving him a slow look over before he huffed out a breath his tongue lolling out of the corner of his mouth. The residents of Hogwarts had been surprised when their new consort came with a wolf and a crow but they had become a common enough sight in the palace now and though most people didn’t like getting too close they would watch fondly when Lord Harry was barefoot in the garden throwing a stick for the lumbering wolf while a disgruntled crow sat nearby pretending not to be interested. Harry shook his head and then brushed out his hair knowing nothing he could do would get it to lay flat on his head.
“Ah, okay, are you sure you wouldn’t be happier alone?” Harry whispered pulling the box and letter from his pocket where they had been sitting all day. Severus tapped them with his wand and slowly they resized themselves taking up most of the space on the table. The potions master slowly dragged his tongue against his lips as he shook his head his hand reaching out nervously for the letter.
“Um...This way...” Harry moved forward carefully moving passed Draco and Lucius to head to the front door. He pushed it open horrified when he saw his cousin and his gang still standing at the gate. Dudley grinned throwing a clump of mud towards his head. He almost went cross eyed as it came flying towards him only to watch as it changed direction mid air and flew back towards Dudley hitting him directly between the eyes a red welt appearing as it fell to the floor. Harry turned and saw Lucius slipping a long stick back into the cane he was holding. Dudley’s rubbery lips parted in a gasp as his hand came up to rub his head.
“See the Grindylows, Harry? They trick people into following them in the dark. The lights on their heads cause lost travellers to follow them and they lead them to the water and drown them” Remus told him lightly as a hideous creature with a faint light swam past the glass. “The best way to get away from them is by breaking their fingers. They have surprisingly good grips but delicate fingers”
“...” Harry couldn’t make any sound leave his mouth as he was too choked up by Lucius’ speech and he wondered yet again what it was about him that made the Dursley’s hate him so much. The stairs they were walking down were simple wood with the walls simply painted in a beige with wooden beams running through them. In the light of the Lantern he saw graffiti etched into the plaster. Many of them went back to the 1600’s.
“Harry doesn’t want them knowing yet, he shouldn’t worry, his true friends will be happy for him.” Luna assured him but, in spite of how much he trusted her, he couldn’t shake the feeling that it was going to go badly. Ron had never really forgiven him for not marrying Ginny, Harry was sure he was going to blow his top knowing he was actually dating their former school rival. “You should speak to Ginny first. You haven’t seen her since you’ve been back, have you?”
“Thank-you” Harry said coming to hover next to him but not lowering his feet. The broom had a delay in its response to his movements but it was only a mild one and Harry honestly thought that this was one of the best things about magic. Lucius had him practice a few more times before nodding approvingly.
“Of coursen, if youses needen mes” Jinx answered her strange little face adorned with a motherly smile and Harry grinned back. The elves were strange, Dobby the strangest, but they were kind and he loved Jinx.
“I will have to bow out on seeing them. They have never reacted well to me” Remus muttered flashing a sad smile and Harry reached out to pat his hand trying to comfort him but not really knowing how. “The Cheshire cats don’t like me very much either”
“Aww poor baby, come on boys, let’s go have fun!” Pansy laughed slinging her arms around both Harry’s and Draco’s shoulders and pushing them into the main party room. The twins followed them noticing for the first time that Nino and Sho had faded away at some point.
“He wills, Master Harrys, Master Lucius has paid for the bestest of healers for hims” Jinx assured him and when he saw that Remus was confused, he quickly explained about Dobby. The werewolf looked thoughtful his fingers running over his chin.
“You don’t trust me to be able to handle the healer?” Narcissa asked with a quark to her lips her blue eyes sparkling. Lucius laughed reaching out and taking her hand as he purred;“Of course not, my heart, I simply want to be there to stop you from doing something that you might regret”
“Madam, please be silent” Lucius waved his stick and her mouth snapped closed causing her eyes to fill with fear. “I am going to tell you what is going to happen, in just a few moments will be summoning the aurors and you will be explaining your actions to them. Child abuse is not something we take lightly”
“I learned some chords. Chuck said I did well.” He answered taking his seat and looking over at Remus who had finally woken and was looking pale. “Are you okay, Pops?”
“I have no doubt, but I was once a fine chaser, I will not let you win so easily, either of you!” Lucius announced with a chuckle and proceeded to roll up the white sleeves of his shirt. “Let us begin”
I hope that this isn’t lame, sorry for not posting yesterday but I had my last Japanese lesson of the year on Tuesday and it was super busy but no I am free for a few weeks xD
“Harry. This…Is something…” Severus started and then stopped his mouth opening and closing as he looked from Harry to the snake and then back again. Harry wondered if this was going to make the teacher hate him and wish he hadn’t adopted him, and he hung his head asking softly
Remus’ arm curled around him protectively and Severus allowed it. Their relationship was…Tentative at best. They had had a few stolen moments together, nothing that to others would make it seem like a date but to them it meant the world. It was all about rediscovering each other as the boys they had once known and learning about the men that they had become. When their shy romance had started in school it had been, innocent. Stolen glances here and there, lingering touches when it was certain nobody would see. Now it was deeper than that. In those private moments he had lain open his heart and soul to be ridiculed. It hadn’t happened, instead Remus had replied in kind. Still they hadn’t progressed further though Severus believed that the wolf would like to, and he knew that he did.
“I can’t remember…Maybe? Probably…” He answered honestly and Draco gave a small hum peering at him through the milky light. “Honestly, I don’t remember…It’s probably because it’s a strange bed, I’m fine, Dray, honest…Let’s just go back to sleep.”
“But I don’t have a passport!” Harry gasped remembering the way Dudley had waved his passport in his face when the Dursley’s had taken him to Spain for the first time. The Dursley’s had gone away every year since then. He had never been allowed to go he had been left with Mrs Figg or more often, if only Petunia and Dudley had gone, Vernon who kept him locked in his cupboard for most of the day only letting him out so he could empty his bucket and have a slice of toast.
“See, at least someone thinks I’m awesome” Nino chuckled ruffling Draco’s hair and the blonde flushed with a tiny, shy grin smoothing out his hair while Nino introduced the twins and Pansy to Sho. “Sho got us the tickets. He is following the hummingbirds for this year and doing a book about them”
“Thank-you” Narcissa’s voice was breathless her head feeling a strange mix and lightheaded and full. Her skin was pricking with chills and she was increasingly grateful for Kingsley’s warm sturdy presence at her side. She really longed for this to be over, but she knew that she had to take a moment to collect herself before facing Bella. She breathed as deeply as she dared trying her best to not take in any of the smell.
“Oh? And what did that overgrown oaf have to say?” Severus asked with a touch of a growl to his voice. He looked as if he were only moments away from stalking out of the great hall to find the giant of a man and Harry gave a smile touched by his concern.
“What you looking at, Potter?” He growled in much the same way Dudley and his gang had and Harry had to fight the sickening feeling of panic that came. A warm hand on his arm helped him push through it and he turned his nose upwards and walked out the hall listening to Chao-Xiang and Alice chat excitedly about their upcoming lessons.
“You are always too hard on yourself, Severus. There are a great many people rooting for your happiness.” Minerva sighed in a grandmotherly fashion reaching over to curl graceful fingers around his hand. Severus stared at it for a moment and then let out a near bitter laugh.
“Harry! Never think that! Of course, I care about you! I have done since I was first introduced to the tiny red-faced baby. I met you mere hours after you were born and I have cared for you since. I would be honoured to blood adopt you. However, I am a werewolf and I can’t offer you much…”
“Of course! They are Japans best team!” The twin on the right said while his brother nodded and although it was deeply ingrained into Draco to hate the Weasley’s on sight he knew that Harry liked them and he was prepared to do a lot for Harry. “Thanks for letting us come with!”
“In the stomach of a goat” Harry answered feeling a buzz of absolute happiness when Severus nodded and flashed him another smile before asking crisply;
“Jareth? Really, Lupin?” Severus tried to recover his composure, but it was impossible when he looked at his lover who was dressed as David Bowie from Labyrinth. He doubted that any of the pure bloods would know who the Werewolf was dressed as, but he knew. The white over-sized sleeves shirt and tight black waistcoat, and the skin-tight trousers with black boots. The man was even wearing the make-up and had the ornate pendent around his neck.
“Like this…” His head came almost completely off his torso with only a thin patch of skin and muscle holding it in place. The girl, Hermione, flinched her nose wrinkling while a few more children let out more vocal noises of shock and disgust Seamus on the other hand cried out happily,
“Come on boy, that attic isn’t going to clean itself” She said sharply and Harry nodded following her out. The sun was already bright as they made their way over the road to her home. Once inside Harry was amazed to see that there was a breakfast set out on the table along with another letter in Draco’s beautiful script propped up against a teapot dressed in a blue tea cosy. “Sit down and have some breakfast while you read your letter...”
“I told you, Harry, we would stay together.” Draco announced happily taking his hand and leading him to their new house table.
“Why don’t you crawl back to your mummy, Grub and leave us alone?” Pansy growled darkly looking even more fierce than the boys. Her eyes were narrowed her snub nose turned up in disgust. “We were having fun”
The boys from their dorm ignored them throughout breakfast only occasionally looking at them from the corners of their eyes but Harry found that he didn’t care. Chao-Xiang and her friend Alice talked enough for the whole table and Harry found himself enjoying the Asian girl’s bubbly personality. It was different from Draco, Pansy, or even Seamus but it wasn’t overbearing like the twins. She talked about everything and anything rarely needing prompting to continue. Alice was only slightly less talkative and neither of them seemed to care that Draco was a Malfoy.
“Narcissa Black, your magic is as graceful as ever, it was no trouble, no trouble at all. It was a true pleasure to feel Lily Evans magical signature once again” Filius grinned brushing his hair away from his face. “I am very happy to have met young Mr Malfoy and young Mr Potter...”
“Can we look at the map…Or is there anything you want to…I…” Harry mumbled once again feeling nervous around Severus even though he had been calling the man uncle Sev’ for a few weeks now. Severus gave him a smile and a nod and together they headed over to the large map that was separated by colours.
“It is possible that Minerva checked in on you, however she would have done a better job of blending in.” Remus told him his mouth thinning with anger at the mention of his cupboard and Harry felt bad for saying it. The werewolf already looked so tired that he hated adding to his stress. Remus gave him a smile his amber eyes flashing just a little showing how close his wolf was to the service. “Come on, Harry, eat your dinner” While Harry had been thinking food had appeared on the table like it did at the Malfoy’s home. “Would you care for some potatoes?”
“The true Chimera died out along with the Greeks. They have the head of a lion, the tail of a snake and the middle of a goat. The creatures here today are creatures of alchemy. There is only one wizard in the entirety of the wizarding world that has managed to successfully create them. Nicholas Flamel” Severus answered pointing to a sign that depicted a brightly coloured painting of the creature he had just described along with a blurb about Nicholas Flamel with a picture of the man himself. Like most pictures in the wizarding world this one moved giving a wink and a bow. He was an extremely old looking man with watery grey eyes and less hair on his head than he had on his chin, however his smile was bright and cheerful and there was a mischievous sparkle in his eyes that made them seem younger than the rest of him.
“Aww, Uncle Sev’, you are going to be Harry’s father at the weekend! You could be nicer” Draco pouted playfully but Severus fixed him with a hard stare colour appearing in his cheeks as he answered
“I see, Dumbledore’s doing no doubt, wanting to spare him the fate of growing up with the weight of the world on his shoulders, perhaps even mould him in someway. In a year he would then send a friendly face to Potter, a fully light wizard who will show the boy that the world is only black and white when everyone knows there are many shades of grey” Lucius hummed clicking his fingers and a House elf, thankfully not Dobby, appeared to pour him more coffee and to take away the plate. “You must help him see that the world isn’t the way some families will believe. Something your mother said intrigued me, she said that you showed her a letter and you had reason to believe that Mr Potter was ill treated with his relatives?”
“Light throughout the darkness and oranges are a healthy fruit” Draco answered, though it was clear that he didn’t fully understand it either and that he wasn’t as interested in the orange as Harry was. Probably because he was used to it. “Mother does the oranges, there is a protection charm against ill health on them. You don’t eat it until new years eve, just leave it on the bedside table. It will keep until then”
“How do you do, Pans said that you had a relative staying. I thought for sure he would be your double” Theo said his voice higher and breathy but still maintaining a level of calm and stilted politeness that Harry was sure he would never achieve. Draco stiffened just a fraction and Harry was under the impression that Theo thought he was probably Lucius’ bastard child.
“That is Umeda Mai, okay it isn’t the best image, but it was years ago” Nino rolled her eyes at their sceptical expression. “What is important is the wand in her hand…You see it? The reason Mahotokoro is the smallest school in the world is not because Japan has less magical people than anywhere else but because most Japanese wizards and witches don’t use wands to centre their magic, they focus on wandless magic and natural magic. Umeda was the first person to use a wand in Japan. She was one of the four lovers Emperor Hashimoto, some say that she was his favourite lover and I guess that she was since he built the first Mohotokoro school for her to be able to teach. The first school wasn’t on Iwo Jima but was actually located on Mount Fuji which was in the centre of Emperor Hashimoto’s territory.
“These are black birds?” Harry asked looking at the black birds in the cage. They were thinner than the Doves sleeker with black shiny feathers that seemed to be almost blue when looked at in a certain light. Their eyes were bright blue and seemed to have the same intelligence as an owl. He had to admit that he had never known what a calling bird was since hearing the song and he wasn’t sure if he was disappointed or not that they seemed rather...Not what he was expecting. “They are just black birds right?”
“They are a very sensitive flower Harry; they tend only to respond well to the person that planted them” Lucius said softly from where he was walking behind them. “But it seems that you have a softer touch than Draco, if you enjoy flowers then you should talk to Narcissa, I’m sure she would be delighted to have somebody share her interest”
“My name is Anna! You don’t remember me! But I remember you! You saved me once when the kitchen cat had me in his claws! I think you were very brave!” Boris thought about it for a moment and then shook his head. Helping a bat from a cat! How was that brave? He said as much to the bat. “It was brave to me! With out you Boris I wouldn’t be alive today! There are many types of brave Boris!” Boris was thankful that the bat said as much but he shook his head.
“Lucius was thinking about October but we will have to see how things go” Narcissa hummed very gently her hand coming to rest on Harry’s shoulder. He felt instant guilt knowing that he had made things a lot more difficult for them. He hung his head only to have it lifted by gentle fingertips. They walked the rest of the way to the hotel in silence talking again only when they were saying goodbye to Pansy in the lobby.
“Ignore Albright, his dad is a follower of Dumbledore.” Francis said softly shuffling up to the other skin and taking out a lame green toothbrush. “Not many people know what’s going on with Dumbledore and Harry, but the press is saying some stuff…Or they were…Until a few days ago.”
“Mistress Malfoy, hows can Jinx help you?” The elf asked while Draco made his way out of the room to change out of his robes only hearing his mother say softly;
“Honk!” The sound the bird let out was extremely loud and almost threatening, but she released his top and bobbed back and forth for a moment or two and then lowered herself into the grass beside him. Harry smiled at the sight and sat down beside her carefully reaching out and stroking the back of her neck. Her feathers were softer than he expected, and he giggled as the small head was lowered onto his lap.
Harry Potter woke with a groan. His entire body aching from where he had been laying on the hard cold stone floor. At some point in the night a lump of coal had found its way from the unruly pile and lodged itself squarely under his back. He had barely noticed however and now he suspected he had another colourful bruise to join the many dotted over his body. Pushing aside the hessian sack that he used as a covering he rubbed an ache out of his neck and then stretched. Listening he could hear slight movement from above stairs, and he whimpered ever so softly. He dragged himself from his bed and pulled on the oversized shirt and trousers that had been patched with the same sack fabric as his covering. Even that had long ago stopped working but he did his best to make them presentable and then stealthily slipped out of the coal scuttle door.
“Harry dear, are you quite well? Do you feel warm?” Narcissa asked moving in her chair to put a gentle hand on his forehead her ruby lips pursed in worry. “We can postpone our trip to Paris if you are feeling unwell”
“It was too sudden. Harry wasn’t ready and I didn’t trust that Dumbledore wouldn’t be there” Lucius said the same arguments he had used earlier and, like then, Harry shot him a grateful smile. Draco had said that it was okay, but he couldn’t stop himself from feeling embarrassed about how he had acted in front of Draco’s friends and they would have been there tonight, probably thinking that he was nothing but a baby and they would have teased him like Dudley and his gang.
“Yes, we decorate a log with evergreens and charm it before laying it on the fire. It will have to be kept burning until the new year when it will be doused by a dark-haired man” Draco shrugged, and Harry tried to remember the Dursley’s or any muggles doing anything like that.
“And I live with those mistakes daily” Lucius said stiffly rubbing the bridge of his nose suddenly looking a lot older than he normally would. “He is a child, Severus, younger even than Draco. Did what you saw give you satisfaction at least?”
“I want to be happy for you, Draco, please believe that. But, as you pointed out, I made many mistakes, I hurt you and your mother in ways that I know you can never truly forgive me for, but I do care for you and worry what will happen.”
“Nino is a great teacher; she was mine and Draco’s tutor last year.” Harry informed her looking over at the Japanese teacher who seemed to be reluctantly talking with Quirrell while at the same time trying not to breathe too deeply. Harry gave her an almost sympathetic smile and then turned to the last package Hedwig had brought. It was a care package, the same as Draco’s though his included a letter from Remus on the top.
“Jake Pointer” A boy with mousy brown hair that curled around his temples squeaked nervously as the door closed behind the last of the boys. Draco arched an eyebrow before moving to his trunk leaving Harry to introduce himself and his friend.
“Will it hurt Harry?” Narcissa asked cooing ever so gently to the boy who had stopped sobbing but was now sniffing loudly. The neckline of her dress was soaked with the tears he had shed but Narcissa held him just as tightly.
“The Malfoys and Blacks more than most” Pansy added helpfully reattaching herself to him when they were through the gate and onto a thicker pathway that allowed them to walk three abreast. “The only other family so well connected is the Potters”
“If I am allowed to stay” Harry muttered. He was not a boy that had ever allowed himself to hope, when he was young he had wished and wished that some mysterious family member would turn up and take him but that wish had been beaten out of him. He wanted to stay here with Draco, Narcissa and Lucius but he knew better than to hope for it. He didn’t trust the toad faced woman or Dumbledore, the man wanted him back with his aunt and uncle.
“...I got locked in my cupboard for days after that but it was worth it. What kind of accidental magic have you done? I grew my hair back over night once, cause my aunt had cut it so short it looked awful...and another time I shrank a jumper. It was one of Dudley’s old ones...Um...Sorry...I hope that you can go to Japan like you want, do you go to school? I go back next week, I’m not looking forward to it as I’m in the same class as Dudley and his gang. Um...Yours Harry...”
“That’s awesome Harry, hey maybe we can form a band! I’m awesome on drums, and Fred is a pretty decent singer…”
“I am, but what if a wand doesn’t choose me?” He whispered hesitantly some of his old insecurities coming back, his image of being confident and in control crumbling as he thought about what would happen if his magic didn’t fall in sync with one the wands. He, Draco and Pansy had learnt about wands choosing the witch or wizard and if they didn’t have the correct one then it could damage their ability to use magic. He had had nightmares of standing in the shop with Ollivander, a man he had seen in passing, shaking his head and saying sorry there had been some mistake. It had taken him a long time to grasp wandless magic after all.
“I will try” Harry said weakly attempting to give a smile but he knew that it didn’t quite reach his eyes. Narcissa’s eyes softened even more as she moved forward and pressed a light kiss to his forehead over his scar as she whispered;
“Likewise. Mr Potter, would you be able to perhaps take us to your home? I think I would very much like to speak with your aunt and uncle” Lucius sounded calm, almost serene, but Harry had the prickling feeling that he often got before a large thunderstorm. His eyes moved from Lucius to Draco and then back again. His heart was somewhere in the back of his throat absolutely terrified what his aunt and uncle would say. “Please, my dear lady wife is speaking with Mrs Figg and I would like very much to meet with your guardians”
“You are a smart boy, Harry, just like your mother” Remus smiled his face a little pale, but his amber eyes were warm. “So, you understand what it is?”
“Well, those…Muggles…Have said a lot of things to you Harry, and not even one of them is true” Draco pointed out as they reached the study they had been in with Nino earlier that day. “Sev is still Sev and Lupin is still Lupin. Why should who they are with be anyone else’s business? In truth Harry, I think more people are going to focus on Lupin being a werewolf and Sev being a former Death Eater over who they go to bed with. But don’t think about those muggles or anybody else! Be happy! This weekend they will be your fathers”
“After warm milk and Uncle Lucius read to me” Draco didn’t miss the use of Uncle Lucius over the more formal Sir or Mr Malfoy that he had been using and he wondered what had happened to make it change in the space of a night. He didn’t get to ask though as Rocky popped into the room with a crack.
“Yes, mother, c’mon Harry” Draco’s hand slapped him on the back and Harry continued to his bathroom. The bathroom held a large free-standing tub with golden feet that looked like the paws of an animal. The skin was set against a window that overlooked a lake and Harry already spent a lot of time staring out at it when he was brushing his teeth the night before. “Are you feeling better?”
“Potion lessons with the imbeciles is never fun Harry, as you have missed your lessons for today, I wish for you both to write an essay on the YingLang plant and which potions it is best used in”
A loud howl sounded from their left-hand side and Remus stiffened just a little his face going pale now. Harry looked to see where the howl had come from and gulped when he saw a huge grey and white wolf with black markings around its blue eyes staring at them as they walked. He didn’t understand wolf, but he didn’t need to, to know that it was warning the werewolf to stay away. Harry moved closer to Remus and took his hand giving it a gentle squeeze which was returned almost immediately.
“She is a skilled witch, top in several of her classes in Mahoutokoro, the Japanese school, I believe she had golden robes” Severus hummed looking to Lucius for confirmation. The blonde nodded placing the healer approved foods onto Harry’s plate while the boy looked confused his eyebrows furrowing as he hummed;
“Oi, what’s that supposed to mean?” The twins growled together their grins fading as anger flashed through their eyes and Harry felt himself reaching to claw at his neck. It had been a while but he bite of his nails calmed him until Draco reached up and took his other hand.
“Nice to meet you Harry! My name is Ninomiya Kazumiko” She said with a thick accent holding out a small, chunky hand to shake his while also bowing. “Draco has told me a lot about you in the last ten minutes”
“My dear you are babbling a little and confusing the boys” Narcissa hummed gently rolling her bright blue eyes as she took a blueberry muffin from the wicker basket on the table and broke it apart with her fingers before feeding the Pixie birds that were sitting on her shoulder. Harry hadn’t noticed them until now and he gave a smile as a pink bird took a blueberry into its beak.
“I has lefted him outsides sir” Rocky answered his upper lip curling into a sneezing sneeze added almost gloatingly “Its raining”
“You’re right, thanks Harry” She tucked her arms around his leaning her head on his shoulder as they finally reached Madam Malkins robes for all occasions. The shop was blissfully empty as they headed inside and at once Madam Malkin herself appeared from the back room, summoned by the twinkling bell above her door.
“Yes, causing me many headaches trying to find flavours that don’t ruin the potions and make them useless. However it is a small price to pay to see you recovering, brat, would anyone care for another drink? You can have a fruit juice and nothing more” Severus rose from his seat and grabbed his empty coffee cup. Remus agreed asking for a coffee himself this time while Draco asked for a fruit juice as well refusing to have another butterbeer if Harry couldn’t. It was one of the many ways Draco showed him how much he cared following the same diet plan as him and making sure that he was there at all of his healers appointments to make sure he knew what was needed.
Harry watched the Yule log crackling in the fireplace his heart warm as he sat between his fathers listening to Narcissa tell the tale of the first Yule, the wedding of the winter witch and the autumn prince. They had had a small feast with just a few adult friends of the Malfoys and Harry and Draco’s friends. It was sedate compared to a muggle new year with large drunken parties. New Year was about reflection and being with those that you loved into the new year. The fire popped again sending green and purple sparks up the chimney while the story came to an end.
“I’m the same as ever, Harry, you need some shoes, or at least sandals” The wolf tutted shrugging his shoulders so that his threadbare robe slipped down to reveal some of the mating scar Fenrir had given him. Harry didn’t look at it, but still Remus quickly pulled his robe back up. “I will walk with you to the village.”
“And that is the origin of trick and treat, in the muggle world?” Harry was awe while Draco seemed to be unimpressed and was instead looking at the large pile of books Remus had been pouring through. For Harry it made Halloween so much more interesting and he was sad that Muggles didn’t keep up with the tradition. Trick or treating wasn’t such a big thing in the UK, and nobody would dare do such a thing in their area but Dudley had always been invited to Halloween parties wearing costumes that were always too small around his large gut.
“Harry, I’m positive Uncle Sev’ knew you are a complete Ravenclaw. You can talk to him tomorrow, but don’t worry about it, ‘kay?” Draco asked slathering up his toothbrush with the minty fresh paste and Harry did the same. Jake came into the bathroom a minute later followed by Francis.
“Magic, Harry, all magic photos and paintings have the ability to move but only the really good ones have the ability to talk and retain their memories and personalities of those in the paintings. It’s like a part of their soul gets put into them when they die. Its not really, more like a memory or something but its a good way of learning about your family” Draco hummed his nose scrunching as he tried to explain it but wasn’t really sure how it worked either. He was still holding Harry’s hand leading him passed a stone spiral stair case and several large white doors that had ornate moulding around them with swirls of grapes, birds, and animals carved into them. More paintings waved and whispered with the figure of a red horse running through each painting. “I think there is blood magic used and the paintings only become sentient after the person has died”
“What!? But that’s not fair! We haven’t even got that many points, we’ll be in the negative” The boys shouted together wriggling even more in his grip as they tried to escape. Severus held them more tightly. He would never admit it aloud, even on pain of death, but he had had hopes for the twins last year. Of the red haired brood that had stepped across the threshold of Hogwarts they were the only ones that had shown any promise in potions. Unfortunately, they had soon shown themselves to be as bad as Potter and his merry band of loons. Not a day went by when they weren’t blowing something up or running wild.
Harry sent his letter back with Plum who had given him a slightly sour look before taking off through the window once more. Mrs Figg had chuckled saying that she would have to give her postal bird a rather large mouse that evening to make up for the two delivery and Harry felt guilty. He had been so excited and happy to have a possible friend that his cousin couldn’t frighten off that he hadn’t thought about the owl being tired.
I always hated how in Harry Potter it was always so clear-cut that all the rich pure bloods were bad and the poor ones were good, life is never that simple so I hope you like my version of good Pansy and the blend of Harry’s friends 😊
“Madam Sinistra is an extremely talented witch and will be an unbiased head mistress, I’m sure” Severus Snape hummed looking positively terrifying dressed up as Salazar Slytherin all be it with more hair. It was the most colour the twins had ever seen their professor in, and he was only wearing a muted green colour robe with silver accents. “Remember you have to be back at Hogwarts for nine. Hello, Harry, you suit the Fae Child character extremely well”
“I dunno, would be pretty funny” Ron snorted but Harry, if he were honest, could imagine Draco looking after baby birds. Since Hagrid had been forced to leave the position of Care of Magical creatures and they had gotten a proper teacher Draco seemed to love the subject. He had even beaten Hermione in their last test. He didn’t say that out loud however and just looked at he birds wondering why he sort of liked the idea of it being Draco
“It’s okay, he’s just a grumpy old thing, he doesn’t deliver much post these days, I don’t have may friends in the wizarding world he was my sisters owl you see but she passed away” The old woman gave him a smile her eyes reflecting the sadness that she must have been feeling. Harry swallowed a lump not knowing what he was meant to say to that. He hadn’t known the woman had a sister much less that she had died so he ended up whispering;
“You are the care of and your magical signature is needed to open it and read it” Tormuld said with the same kind of bored indifference the Goblins seemed to show everyone they served at the bank and Harry wondered if Dumbledore knew how much he was disliked.
Harry sighed, his left leg twitching frantically as he looked nervously over at the door to the small private café, he had arranged to meet Ginny in. He felt more nervous than he had in a long time, and he didn’t like it, it made him feel like that scared 11-year-old boy struggling to find the platform for 9 and 3/4. He told himself time and time again that he had done the decent thing by Ginny, he had tried to love her as he should and then, when he had figured everything out, he had broken up with her quickly. She was young enough to find somebody else and from what he’d seen and heard she had made a name for herself in Quidditch, playing not only for the Enchanting Eternals but also England as Seeker, it was believed that England had a real chance for the cup this year and he was happy for her.
“He became a magi-zoologist. He learnt to control it and you will too, I just think we need to let you know that nobody is going to hurt you, or shout at you if you do anything freakish, in fact we are going to celebrate it…”
“Skegness? I...I see, then very well we will go to Skegness” She said softly hoping her Husband would know where that was in the world. It seemed like a muggle place but if that was where Harry wanted to go she would happily take him.
“Can I really stay here? In this beautiful house with Draco?” Harry whispered in wonder clearly not believing it and Draco gave a nod happily saying;
“Maybe he is, but I can assure you that he is in the minority. Harry answer us honestly, is it the fact that we are in a romantic relationship or the fact that we are having sex that bothers you the most?”
“Nope, your eyes are beautiful, they are a unique shade of green but not unpleasant at all. It’s like a spring green” Draco hummed honestly, looking into those eyes that were hidden by the ugly glasses. Harry gave him an almost shy smile his cheeks a bright pink as he whispered;
“Black-Potter, Kingsley Shacklebolt agreed that I had rights to take him as my ward while the matter of his relatives is taken care of”
“Pleasure to meet you. Master Black” Blaise said bowing smartly and Harry, remembering the lessons both Narcissa and Lucius had been giving him, responded with a bow of his own.
“I really can’t believe he thinks of Malfoy’s as family!” A sharp voice snipped and snarled, and Harry stiffened seeing Ron walking down the hallway towards them. His face, normally pale in contrast to his hair was puffy and red and his lips were curled into a familiar, unpleasant grimace.
Any supernatural fans will find the name Chuck Shurley familiar and that is not a coincidence. Harry’s music teacher will be Chuck because I am obsessed with his character and I know he is pretty much dark side but…Rob Benedict is probably the sweetest human being I have had the pleasure of talking to so yup he will be a lovable dork who teaches Harry guitar I guess you could say my Chuck is probably more Rob...
“You should settle yourself, Quirrell, you look like you could use some tea.” Severus offered calmly holding up a silver teapot and Quirrell nodded moving slowly to sit at the teachers table while Severus ushered for them to leave. “Go have your breakfast, boys, soon you will be in lesson and your brains could use nourishment.”
“Dragon…” Narcissa whispered reaching out to clutch at his hand as Lucius rose from his chair and swept out of the room without another word spoken. Perhaps he had been too harsh, but Lucius had been cutting from the moment the first article appeared in the paper and Draco had had enough.
“Fred! George! You look amazing!” Harry said tugging Draco down the last few steps his green eyes looking them over and Fred startled realising something.
“Dragon, Harry is fine. He is with Severus and Remus” Narcissa chuckled her graceful hand coming to rest on his shoulder. Draco shot her a small smile, but he didn’t relax until he finally saw Severus and Remus coming towards them with Harry in between them. His friend looked okay but Draco knew that Harry was better at hiding his panic in public than he was in private.
Finally at half passed eight he was allowed to slip into his cupboard with a glass of water and a bucket and was told not to come out until morning. He heard the lock slide into place and then he waited for a few minutes before slowly taking out the package. For a moment he was positive that it wouldn’t be there, that he had imagined the whole thing but his fingers brushed against it and he pulled it out. The name seemed to shine in the dullness of the cupboard and the tingling feeling happened again causing the hairs on his body to stand on end as he untied the silver ribbon.
“No, I would very much like you to be here with me for this Harry” He said his finger lightly running over his name in the delicate script of Lily Potter. At the touch the letter jerked and shuddered in much the same way  it had at the bank and Harry watched as lips formed in the page.
“Honestly! Why am I wearing this crown?” She asked with a huff throwing down the chaft of wheat and the scales so she could pull the offending crown from her head. “A waste of time. My husband’s idea of course. First years of Ravenclaw, welcome to your new home, I will make your first question an easy one…Mr and Mrs Mustard have six daughters and each daughter has one brother. How many people are in the Mustard family?” The portrait gave them a smile playing around with her crown as all of the first years looked at each other. Some even started counting on their fingers until eventually Draco huffed,
“Of course Lord Malfoy, if you will follow me to my office I will insure you have privacy” Tormuld said with another bow before turning on his heel and walking down a thankfully empty corridor. It smelt almost like the school library in the muggle world. It was clean and yet it smelt of dust and trace amounts of damp. Harry had been to Tormuld’s office a week ago when  they had first asked about his parents wills and he tried not to react when the door to the small office was opened and he was presented with the sight of axes lining the walls displaying the names of his Account managers forefathers. Some of them still had blood on the blades though the handles seemed to be lovingly polished. “Please sit and talk, I will see about refreshment”
“Well! I bet that’s never happened before” Chao-Xing giggled as the rest of the sorting went off without a hitch with only two more students being sorted.
“That would be a good idea my heart, however have a care. To have her living so close to Mr Potter I can only imagine that it wasn’t coincidence” Lucius hummed and Draco chewed slowly on his own muffin his eyes fixed on the letters sat in the silver holder. The top one was from his godfather, he could see that from the neat small copperplate handwriting while the other was clearly from Harry and he wanted to ready it as soon as possible but knew that it would be rude while his parents were talking.
“Ahem…Dragon” Narcissa cleared her throat gently drawing both Draco and Harry’s attention to the king and the queen and Harry let out a startled gasp almost falling over himself to bow politely. It was stiff and awkward his body seemingly not wanting to do the gesture and Draco knew that he must have been taught it in the last two weeks.
“Very well, this is my godson Draco Malfoy, the son of Lord Malfoy and this is my son, Hadrian. Draco, Hadrian, this is Minerva McGonagall, deputy headmistress and transfiguration professor”. Severus said smoothly “You already know Lupin. He was once your student after all.”
“Harry” Severus’ tone was gentle and coaxing his long, potion stained fingers coming over to take both of his before he could start clawing at the back of his neck. He hadn’t done it in a long time, however when things became too stressful, he couldn’t help himself. “What’s going on? What are you apologising for?”
“Non! You are most welcome! You will return for more!” Gabriel seemed to be certain of that and Harry guessed that they would. Draco was just being finished as well and they walked over to Nino and Kingsley.
“So, what house do yer think yer’ll be in? I think I’m gonna be a Gryffindor” Seamus asked through a mouthful of stew managing, thankfully, not to get any on the table. The twins perked up happily from where they had been talking to Conner about Charlie.
“And...And you...” Harry smiled though it appeared to be forced and his hand squeezed at his when he heard the sound of boy’s voices. Draco turned and saw a large boy, about the same size and shape as a young hippo, wadding towards the house with a group of pasty faced youths following behind. “Dudley...”
He had overslept once again it seemed, dreaming of black dogs and a giant man with a bushy beard, and the Dursley’s would punish him if they knew. Thankfully, his earliest chore was to fetch water from the well in the centre of the village and he could always use the excuse that the line was busy, as it often was. He grabbed the iron bucket from the side of the house and then ran down the lane as quickly as his bare feet could carry him. It was long since the feel of the stones hurt him but sometimes his heel would be caught by prickles from the blackberry trees that lined the road, today was such a day and he let out a cry as a large, sharp pain stabbed into the bottom of his foot. He hobbled for a moment looking for something that he may lean on to pull out the prickle but instead a strong hand grabbed his arm. For one wild moment he thought it might be his uncle or one of the twins but then his senses caught the warm scent of spice, honey, and warm milk.
The monster an Alpha snake-shifter named Voldemort wanted to bind himself to the Omega child causing his parents to recoil in horror and disgust. They refused and sent him away from their home, sadly the snake-shifter refused to take no for an answer and one night when the moon was full, he slipped into the Potter home and slaughtered both Lord Potter and his Lady. He attempted to spirit the boy away into the night only to be destroyed by Lord Potter’s brother in all but blood Sirius Black. Black was a Dog-Shifter and a fierce and loyal friend. Sadly, the cost of defending Harry from the monster was his life. Voldemort’s final attack was to poison the dog-shifter with his fangs.
“Thank-you” Harry replied though Draco was sure that he didn’t really believe it but he was too polite to say that. “This...This is really my room?”
“His relatives? What would they do to him that he didn’t deserve? A trouble maker like his father and godfather no doubt”
“Good day, Jinx” Lucius chuckled as Narcissa cast a feather light spell onto Harry and then carrid him from the room with Draco following after.
“You must be Mr Potter’s uncle, please come join your wife” Lucius said rather calmly pointing his wand at him and although the man paled as he saw it going cross eyed at the tip he remained enraged.
“You didn’t hear this from me but...” Harry was certain that he knew all about people he had never even dreamed about and he wondered how the man learnt so much or how he remembered so many names.
“Sadly, I don’t think it will happen. Parsaltongue is a bloodline trait, it’s old magic.” Luna hummed taking Lysander from the playpen as he started to cry and handing him over to Harry who happily took his godson.
“I have no intention of letting this out, the boy will have enough difficulties next year without the entire school knowing of his troubles”
“Lady Malfoy, forgive me! It is such an open secret that I forget that some might not know it” Pansy laughed happily her cheeks flushing just a little. “I’m sorry, Harry. My mummy and daddy were promised to each other in their infancy a magical contract was signed before they could even walk. It was sadly still in place when my daddy found that he preferred the company of men. They couldn’t break the contract so they fulfilled it on the understanding that they were both free to find lovers elsewhere. Mummy and Daddy are very great friends, they often go on the hunt for men together and both have similar tastes, which is both amusing and terrifying”
“Of course, Dad, we know. I promise we will make you proud.” Harry promised, meaning every word. Pansy pulled a face, potions was not her strong suit, in fact, Severus had refused to allow her entry to the lab at Malfoy manor twice and she didn’t think that she would be any better at school.
“Ah Mr Potter, come on, come on! No need to be shy, which is your wand arm? Hold it up! Come on now my boy” Harry did as he was told watching the man hurry around the room bringing more wands over as the tape measure got to work. Harry wasn’t completely convinced that it was needed as Ollivander never seemed to refer to the measurements, but he thought it best not to say anything not when the tape was inching closer to his mouth. He really didn’t want to know how long his own tongue was. “Okay, yes, yes, we have some good candidates here Mr Potter…”
“Because I am in love with Draco” Harry answered with a laugh. Nobody knew how it had happened but the last of Voldemort’s spirit that resided in the Forest had exploded when Harry and Draco had kissed that night of the third ball. Dumbledore had led a party into the forest and found a twisted lump of bark in the centre of the forest. It could have been mistaken for a dead tree if it hadn’t been for the disgusting face. “And you shouldn’t joke about that in front of Severus. He is fond of Draco and not as fond of you since you tried to dress him as a bat” Harry chuckled looking at the bird who looked as though he wanted nothing more than to peck out the eyes of the twins. Fred and George looked nervously at the bird and then smiled.
He followed her to a messy kitchen and was directed to sit down at the table while she pottered around pouring a dark brown liquid into a glass that was slightly dusty but otherwise clean. Harry moved aside a pile of clothes disturbing another of the cats before putting his book down and looking at the woman’s hunched back as she muddled around looking through some cake and biscuit tins.
“you...you are a witch?! You know about Hogwarts ? It’s real?” Harry gasped almost choking on the slightly soft Dodger he had just put in his mouth. The elderly woman patted him on the back while letting out a chuckle;
“It is our job as parents and carers to shield you, but it is also our duty to be as open and honest as we can be. If we aren’t open with you, how can we expect that you will be open with us” Lucius said speaking for Narcissa as he came into the room. A silk robe and a pair of pyjama bottoms was all that he was wearing, and Harry almost flushed at the sight of the man’s naked torso that he could faintly see. “With this information we are a step closer to defeating the Dark Lord. For good, this time”
“And from the way my dear husband was carrying on last night you are a natural at it. I’m sure when you have spent more time with us you will be as enthusiastic as my Dragon” Narcissa smiled sipping her wine as the trio spoke back and forth. Draco was growing increasingly more animated as he spoke, his hair flopping around his angular face while his hands were moving around as if mimicking the movements of aa broom. His cheeks had gained a pink flush and his grey eyes were sparkling. Harry didn’t understand what they were talking about but he did like seeing Draco so happy.
“Boy?” He called as soon as he reached their regular meeting spot. Only the silence of the forest came to meet him, and he sank down onto a log his head in his hands. After waiting a few minutes, he turned hopeful but was bitterly disappointed only to see Moony. Moony who was carrying a note in his mouth. He took it carefully still not trusting the fangs of the beast and sobbed as he saw in Boy’s untidy scrawl
We will be having a hop skip and a jump timeline wise soon…To almost a year in the future which means Hogwarts xD I’m sorry this story is so long… Draco/Harry will start to happen more then 😊
“We saw the room with room with our own eyes, as you would have if you had even stepped foot in there” Narcissa hissed quietly her voice somehow managing to carry around the entire room and Dumbledore gave a laugh, not a harsh one but one that he seemed to hope would settle everything and Harry found himself hating the man almost as much as he hated the Dursley’s. This man had known that he was in a cupboard, that the Dursley’s hated him and yet he had done nothing about it.
“What are we doing today?” Draco asked with excitement that Harry started to feel even when Nino smirked before answering.
“Very well, I will accept that. You both did very well. Now I suggest that we all head inside and warm up before going on the sleigh ride” Lucius suggested his hand squeezing at his shoulder and Draco beamed. He grabbed Harrys’ hand and together the boys raced towards the manor. They passed their snowmen from the day before and watched as the lights from the fairies twinkled and shone brightly as they danced in the hedge rows.
“What? Is that even possible?” Harry gasped his eyes and mouth wide looking at Draco who appeared to be just as shocked. Draco shook his head and shrugged. “What did they take?”
“Yes, thank-you, sir” Harry whispered very gently as Draco guided him to one of the chairs around the breakfast table. Dobby’s words were still ringing clear in his mind. He didn’t believe them, the Malfoy’s were the nicest people he had met and Dobby was an extremely strange creature but he didn’t know why he had said them.
“I...I don’t know, but you did! If it was pity Potter...” Draco snapped pulling his reluctant eyes from Potter’s cock to his face once again surprised to see that the short arse was laughing at him. Potter actually had the nerve to sound amused when he asked;
“Ah” Draco said with a delicate shrug his expression clearing. “Well, I have no idea who Doctor who is but if he knows how to make something bigger on the inside then yes, like Doctor who. You stayed in a wizarding tent before, right Potter?” The blonde sat back in his chair swirling a ruby coloured wine around his crystal goblet and Harry gave a nod necking back his own drink enjoying the way Draco cringed at his heathen actions of drinking what was possibly a great vintage. Harry hadn’t really listened to the man that had been pouring the drink. As far as he was concerned it was expensive vinegar but he had to agree with Draco that the bar was private, mostly because it was an upscale Gentlemen's club where you were either born a member or had to be recommended. Harry hadn’t been born a member but his name had been put down when he was about a year old and they were happy to allow him full membership upon his return to the country. Draco of course was a member and had managed to keep his membership while Lucius could only come if his son was there.
“Your aunt probably said a great many things that weren’t true” Jinx popped back into the room with two bars of the best Honeydukes chocolate and she grinned happily handing them over with a bubbly;
“Dad? What are you doing here already?” Harry asked throwing open the door his skin tingling as he saw Albus Dumbledore sitting in one of the loveseats as though he owned the place completely ignoring how he was being glared at from every other person in the room. Harry’s eyes immediately went to Draco and his blonde friend was at his side in an instant. “Headmaster Dumbledore”
“Thank-you, Jinx, and thank you Ernest” Harry called to the room not knowing if the Brownie could hear him or not. He suspected he could though. He pulled on clothes that Jinx had prepared for him and then with a smile to the Elf he hurried out of the room guessing that Draco would already be in the drawing room.
“Not as much as I would like. Castiel and Michael are the only two that even write anymore. Though I do keep an eye on them as much as they will let me. Anyway, Harry, you should be going to lunch. Read through the book and I will see you on Friday.” Chuck set about clearing away his things and Harry quietly said goodbye as he put his own guitar in its case and hurried to the dining room the case in one hand and the book tucked under the arm.
“Yes! Thank-you! It was so interesting! I love finding out about different magic from all over the world. Nino teaches us a lot about Asia, I would love to know more about Africa”
“Why the hell would I do that?” Harry asked rubbings soap suds into a chest that had muscle hidden under taunt skin and yet it wasn’t dramatically so. There was also a faint dusting of black hair as dark and as messy as the hair on Potter’s head. Draco’s eyes slipped back down the body following the trail of hairs until it was circled around a cock that was smaller and fatter than his own. It was also half hard.
Harry watched the Pegasus foal for what felt like an age his eyes never leaving the blue wings as it paraded clumsily around near the edge of the enclosure under the watchful eye of the three adults. He thought he would happily spend the entire day watching the creature until movement caught his eye and he saw something he had never even imagined. It looked like a stag, like one that you would see on Scottish shortbread tins, with large antlers, only it was almost pure white with silver fur around its neck and magnificent grey wings tipped with gold, which were larger and even more impressive than the Pegasus. Its hooves were also golden shining in the light. The strange stag-bird flew in a dramatic circle and then came to land a few feet away from the Pegasus.
“Harry? Are you okay?” Draco asked reaching out to touch his shoulder recoiling when Harry let out a whimper and flinched away from him. “Sorry, how are you feeling? I am unsure what Severus made you see but I assure you he won’t get away with it”
If you can, tell him of us, tell him that the best day of our lives was the day he came into it. Tell him that we never stopped loving him. Tell him I cried when he first called me Dadda and I didn’t believe that I could have made something that perfect. Tell him that I was an idiot but he was the very best part of me, the part that made me realise how much of an idiot I had been. Tell him that he is never alone, and that his mother and father loved him enough for a thousand lifetimes. And then, tell him that you love him, that you are glad that he came into your lives and that no matter what happens you will love him.
“Yes, Mistress Narcissa! Jinx will happily be doings that for Little Master Harry!” Jinx greened putting a cup down onto the table with Narcissa’s tea. The lady of the house smiled fondly at her elf before letting out a sigh as she sipped her tea.
“Aye, that would be awesome” Chao-Xing answered happily causing a few students to grumble and Harry was positive he heard something about snakes and Malfoy’s. After a great shuffle and lots of talking the class was separated into groups and Nino nodded happily.
“So have yours, you’re a Ravenclaw now.” Harry pointed out motioning to the tie around Draco’s neck which had turned blue and bronze the moment the hat had called out his new house. Draco looked at the tie and shrugged.
In canon Dad’s get a bad name, there are very few good dads but since I have just lost my dad who was amazing, this version has good dads XD also…Unpopular opinion, I can’t stand Molly Weasley, for all that she is supposed to be a perfect mum she is horrible. She pits her kids against each other constantly and belittles them, she only seems to really like the twins and what they want to do in life when they start making money >.< Ahem, sorry… Please leave a comment or kudos if you liked it it gives me motivation to keep going! More of the train journey in the next part…
“Um…Yeah” Harry answered wondering when it would be a good time to tell his adopted parents about his ability to talk to snakes. Draco had made it seem that it was okay but had also told him that Voldemort was the only other person that could and that made him nervous.
“Not too high, Harry” Nino called after him, and Harry gave a nod doing a few laps around the pitch until Draco caught up with him.
“I would be upset, not because you weren’t a Slytherin a different house wouldn’t change anything, but because we wouldn’t be together” Draco drifted off slowly a thoughtful look coming to his face as he gave a small grin humming “All Malfoys have been in Slytherin...But maybe I could change it, father refuses to tell me how the houses are picked but, I’m pretty smart, I bet I could make Ravenclaw too”
“No fear, Professor Snape!” The twins grinned and Harry found Fred’s arm sliding around his shoulders as he led him to the desk. George followed with Draco and Harry soon found himself being introduced to Lee Jordan a cute black boy with tight braids and a huge friendly smile.
“Thank you very much" Harry smiled gratefully surprised that she was giving him anything at all. As he took the plate and glass Mrs Figh picked up his book and hummed:
“It was amazing!” Harry enthused happily meaning it. It had still stunned him to open his eyes on his 11th birthday and find a selection of gifts from his fathers’, his aunt and uncle, Draco, Seamus, the elves, and the twins. It had made him remember his tenth birthday and how much his life had changed thanks to Draco. “It was all my favourites, how did you know?”
“Ytuen is a special woman and I’m sure your daughter will do her proud” Harry said, and Kingsley gave a beaming smile clapping him on the shoulder.
“I’m very happy you wrote to me and you brought me here, Dray” Harry sighed, his voice thick with emotion and Draco gave his hand a squeeze as they entered the French doors of the manor. Warmth circled around them like a blanket and Draco happily sighed his toes glad of the relief. He stomped the snow from his boots and then grinned as Jinx appeared with a tray of her special peppermint hot-chocolate complete with red and green candy canes.
“I…Don’t know, I just feel like I’ve met her somewhere before…” Harry answered with a shrug looking back over at the old witch who was sending him looks. “When I was growing up people would come up to me all the time. Sometimes they would shake my hand or thank me before just completely vanishing…The Dursley’s hated it, partly because it meant people were talking to me and not Dudley and partly because they were wearing funny clothes…Wizarding clothes…”
“I suggest you leave” A rumbling voice tore through the room and all heads turned to see Remus leaning heavily against Kingsley. His clothes were in pieces and his face looked pinched and tired however he looked murderous and Harry realised Kingsley wasn’t holding him up but was restraining him.
“Yes, you must have noticed that house elves are extremely powerful magical creatures in their own right. Unfortunately their magic is a little wild, like wizards need wands the elves need wizards to balance them out, a focus if you will. Without a focus they can do themselves a great deal of harm, just as we can without wands. To gain that focus the elves bind themselves to powerful families or in the case of those at Hogwarts to the very building itself. The only way to break the binding is the symbolic act of giving an elf clothes. But as it is a mutually beneficial relationship that almost never happens. No matter what some may say the majority elves are as happy with the arrangement as we are...” Lucius explained slowly and although he couldn’t fully understand it Harry nodded slowly not wanting Lucius to be upset with him for being an idiot.
“Today is what the muggles call Christmas, there will be gifts downstairs…” The blonde had already emptied his own stocking out onto the bed and was eating a gummy wand while tearing the wrapper off a chocolate frog. Harry hugged his own stocking watching as Draco pulled out a card with Dumbledore’s face on it. His friend scowled and then tore it into several pieces before tossing it in the direction of the fire. “Urgh, I swear he’s on every card, he must have paid the people who made them”
“What happened last night? When we were being taken to Ravenclaw he was still refusing to go with the Slytherin prefect.”
“Now, if you want to go higher feel free but not too high. The pitch has a great many protection spells but a fall will still hurt” He said with a soft warning. “Perhaps when you feel more confident, we can play muggle in the middle”
“My dragon, you have a heart of gold, the feelings you have only prove that. You care for your friend and hate that he has suffered so, your father is the same and myself. I saw the marks and believed that Pansy was right. Perhaps we should introduce the Dursley’s to my sister”
“Everyone knows what time of year they would like to be married, Lucius, you knew before you asked me, if I recall”
“You want to see a memory? I have to have therapy once a week to get over it and I’m still on potions to counteract the Dursley’s and Dumbledore’s treatment of me…Dray, I need to use the bathroom and then we should go down to breakfast, right?”
“I wass, I thought, you were going to let me go in the groundsss…” The snake wrapped its slender body around his neck and pushed its head down in between the top two buttons of his shirt. It felt cold against his skin but not overly unpleasant.
“In my understanding they lived together even in the wild. Perhaps they found safety in numbers here comes the herd” Severus said softly and sure enough not even a second later around twenty Peryton came over. The sight was stunning their hooves and wings glinting as they circled for a moment and then came to land. “The ones without antlers are the males. Unlike regular stags, females are the dominant and will challenge each other for the rights to the best males”
“Yup! That was great!” Harry said meaning it even though he was upset that he hadn’t even felt a tingle since those first few moments. Maybe they were wrong? Maybe he wasn’t really a wizard. Draco had told him about Squibs who were born into magical families but didn’t have any magic of their own.
“Don’t you think that was an odd conversation for a ten-year-old?” Remus sighed as he and Severus settled into the large double bed later that night. He had thought so at the time, there were some things that children didn’t need to talk about and in his opinion, this was one of them, but Harry had seemed so upset like he needed to talk about it. Severus had handled it perfectly while he had done little to help the boy.
“Dad? Did he say dad?” A low murmur broke out from the other students and they all craned their necks to get a better look at them. Harry immediately felt uncomfortable and shrunk back to Draco and Severus.
“Harry, we only do what any loving family should do” Narcissa whispered as though that should be obvious as she moved quickly and pulled both him and Draco into a hug. “You are a child; you deserve to be able to live free and happy. I wouldn’t have told you this but if somebody was listening and you heard it. I was afraid that you would believe it. The last thing I would want is to hurt you”
“She thinks that I can’t use magic at the moment because…I’m happy…” Harry sighed knowing his friend wouldn’t rest till he got an answer. “She said my magic has only learnt to come out when I’m upset or scared and since I’m happy now it doesn’t need to. Her friend, the Magi-Zoologist had the same problem…Sort of. He wasn’t able to do magic if he was upset…She thinks that it might also be because I fear being a freak…”
I have my second vaccine today, I am not looking forward to it, the first one knocked me sideways a little but I know that it has to be done so wish me luck!
“Dobby! Youse is to stoppen that nows!” Jinx ordered marching smartly over to the strangest of the Malfoy elves. He had always been soft in the head and Lucius had always said he would be given clothes if he didn’t know the secrets of the Malfoy family as well as he did. Memory spells didn’t work on Elves in the way that they did others so they were forced to keep him. “Little Masters are heres!”
“For being so…So, cruel to you…” Harry muttered almost hating the tears that were slipping down his face. Both men looked confused, Severus more than Remus and the potion master shook his head saying
“Well done, Dray.” Harry said as the shadow of the teacher fell over them. She studied his toothpick for a moment and then nodded,
“I don’t mind. I will make mistakes too. I can’t believe it’s really you, that you’re here” Draco growled, and Harry moved closer and placed his hand on his chest. It was the most intimate touch they had ever shared, and Draco’s entire body heated up.
“Harry, how are you feeling?” Remus asked while Draco stroked Harry’s hands gently. His friend had started to calm down some now but Draco could see that his face was still pinched and he had bitten through his bottom lip producing a little bit of blood. The pain couldn’t have been that bad but it was the fear of the two Weasley’s that had done the damage. Remus had brought them to a private room in the inn not wanting Harry to be gawped at by strangers and it was small and cheery but Draco doubted Harry had even seen it yet.
Draco hadn’t been lying. The breakfast that was laid out on the table when they entered the breakfast room was unlike any of those, he had had at Malfoy manor thus far. Cinnamon rolls dripping with lightly spiced cream, maple syrup coated bacon and pumpkin spice hot chocolate. The centre piece on the table was a garland with fairies dancing around large red flowers that Harry didn’t know the names of. Candles were floating above the table with more garlands while in the corner there was a smaller Christmas tree. There were crackers set out on the table, not the cheap kind with plastic toys but large ones with their names on them and Draco was soon getting him to pull on a cracker and it exploded with a bang. A hat fell out, a copy of the one worn by the leader singer of the Wyrd sisters and Draco was soon wearing it while he gathered up the miniature toy quidditch set that had fallen out.
“Harry! I wish we could spend longer together! But I am sure that we will see each other again soon!” The girl said hugging him tightly and swaying him from side to side. Harry patted her back a few times but was very relieved when Draco pulled her off him.
“Yes my dragon?” She hummed clipping the dead leaves from her plant with a pair of silver sheers before turning to look at him with a smile on her face. Her eyes fell to the letter in his hand and her sculpted eyebrow lifted up her pale forehead. “Is Pansy being tedious again?”
“wherever you are, I will be, I promise Harry” He swore aware that there was a strange laughing sound from behind them. He didn’t have to turn round to know that it was Ronald. He was trying his hardest to ignore the ginger, for the sakes of his friendship with the twins, but it was clear the youngest male Weasley wasn’t going to let things slide. Before he had a chance to say anything Seamus was spinning around and growling
“I told my teachers, we had to write about our bedroom and I told them about my cupboard but the Dursley’s said I was making it up and saying that I was making them look bad because they had given me the smallest bedroom. The teachers told me I was ungrateful...Ah!” Harry gasped as a glass vase on the windowsill shattered loudly causing stagnant water to spill down a dirty wall. He watched it slowly and then looked back at Draco his eyes wide. There was movement from the attic and then Draco’s very handsome father appeared with a crack his eyes, almost identical to Draco’s only a half a shade darker, narrowed as he looked around as he asked;
“Harry, you’ve known Sev for a few months now, do you think he ever does anything because he is forced? He truly cares about you, and Remus does as well. Now stop worrying and enjoy your excitement and maybe try and get some more sleep? We have another three hours before the elves will be waking us up to get ready” Draco lightly flicked his nose and Harry let out a laugh snuggling down into his friend and hugging him tightly.
“Thank-you, Lucius” Harry whispered feeling somewhat calmer after the story of his mum. It might be unimportant to most but he thought it told him about her character. That she would help somebody that was her enemy meant she was kind and brave. There was warmth in Lucius’s grey eyes as he smiled.
“His position as supreme mugwump means that he holds a lot of power in our world, though father says that he just plays on his victory over Grindelwald” Draco said before realising that Harry probably wouldn’t know who Grindelwald was. Harry gave him an owlish stare from under his ugly glasses and with a smile Draco explained everything that his parents had told him about Grindelwald. It was a lengthy tale and he was still telling it when his mother and father came into the kitchen and stood by the door. “Mother, father? Is everything fine?”
“Nonsense Harry my dear, you handled yourself very well, the first trip is always the worst. Now, let me clean you off and then I would like to introduce you to Chateau de Malfoy” Narcissa said flicking her wand and cleaning soot from all three of them. It only took a second to have them all clean again with the spell and then she showed him around the reception room. The chateau wasn’t as overly grand as Malfoy manor, it was however more dramatic with and Narcissa often preferred to be holding court here than Malfoy manor when she was entertaining the noble families. The floor was still marble but it was more of a earthy pink tone decorated with golden flowers, of course the Narcissus flower was predominant but that was just a fancy of hers. She had always been told that she was the most beautiful of the Black sisters but she had never seen it in herself but she liked to play on the name that she had been given. “I have to confess that the Chateau was mostly my design. Barring a few changes the Manor resists all attempts to redecorate the gardens are all I am able to control there. The Chateau however enjoys to be played with”
“I know, but that won’t hurt Mummy and Daddy! Everybody knows about them even if they won’t say it. I would never talk about something that would hurt somebody, you know me better than that surely Draco”
“Please stop calling me by that silly nickname” Severus grumbled but Harry could see that he didn’t mean it. Sooner than he was expecting they were in front of the Pegasus horses and Harry stared at them with his mouth open the childish, playful, bickering lost as he saw the beautiful creatures. They were pure white with golden tips to their wings. There were three very close to the fencing and Harry was positive that they turned and flared their nostrils before going back to what they were doing.
“To be expected, but you will enjoy it when you get there.” She promised a little quill and notebook floating behind her as she went from child to child making sure to get all the measurements she needed. “You are getting taller, Harry, at least a couple of inches on you since the last time you came.” Harry smiled happily but stayed silent. He had noticed a growth spurt; the healer had told him that he would never be tall but at least he wasn’t a foot shorter than Draco anymore. They went through the motions of being measured and Harry was glad that the robes would be plain black and they wouldn’t have to sort out colours or cut. In fact, even with all three of them, it was the shortest trip he’d had to the tailor since living with the Malfoy’s.
Ravenclaw…I know most of you wanted them in Slytherin, but Harry in this isn’t Slytherin…But they are together...
“I have no idea how you can forgive me, but I promise your forgiveness will not be misplaced Harry” The potions master said and Harry hugged him ever more tightly before pulling away and eying the package still on the table.
“Potter-Lupin-Snape” He corrected nervously his overwhelming sense of politeness struggling to surface. There was something very wrong with this man, he could feel it prickling away at his skin rather like static shock. He was glad that the teacher seemed to be just as nervous as he made no effort to try and shake his hand.
“UUrh” A moan from his left pulled his attention from the book he had been attempting to read. Harry’s eyes opened slowly before closing again as he rolled onto his side curling into a protective ball. A whimper pulled its way out of the smaller boys mouth and Draco felt a flood of anger towards his god father for hurting the boy that was fast becoming his friend.
“I wasn’t expecting you to come so quickly” She huffed getting up out of her seat to greet them “But it’s more of a response than I’ve had from Dumbledore even after telling him the same things I told you”
“Charmed” She said and Harry blinked slowly taking the hand and pressing a kiss to her knuckles. This seemed to be the correct thing to do as she smiled happily “You must call me Pansy, nobody uses my full name not even Mummy and Daddy and they gave it me”
“I have never been one into the sport myself, my dear lady wife was beater for Slytherin while in Hogwarts at the same time as Lucius” Thesidious said with a smile that shone with pride and Harry nodded not completely sure what a beater was. Around them a beat seemed to be taking place between Magenta and Draco with Pansy looking on somewhat nervously before agreeing to put in a sickle on the wager
Please, don’t worry about asking questions, it is far more interesting talking to you than reading about Pant’s in Italy, she is my oldest friend but she can be a terrible bore. You don’t sound boring at all. Yours, Draco”
“Draco Malfoy you are Francis Draven, second son of the Herbert Draven. Your father works with mine on the school board. It is nice to meet you. Harry, come and get your pyjamas. Its been a long day and tomorrow will be even longer.”
“What made you want to play guitar, Mr Shurley?” He asked politely hoping that getting Chuck to talk about something he enjoyed would help soothe him. It worked the man grinned happily his light blue eyes sparkling as he talked about Elvis and Jimi Hendrix.
“No, Lupin. This time you are correct, however they normally only respond well to virgins or those that they find endearing” Severus answered his dark eyes on the golden creature which was shaking its head this way and that as though trying to scent the air. The Pegasus looked at it with almost bored expressions before grazing again as the Pegasus foal ran to the Peryton. Harry watched with his heart in his mouth however the Peryton barely seemed to notice the little winged horse as it reared back his head and let out a grunting noise. “It’s calling its herd”
“It would make the potion worthless because the mint dilutes the effects of the pine needles and then makes the potion explode” Harry almost chuckled as he remembered doing that as a part of his own lessons with Severus. Under the protective eye of his father he could run a series of experiments with different potions to see what would happen for himself. The explosion had been fun to witness but only because Severus had wrapped them all in a protective bubble or they would have been covered in a bright green slime.
“I call dibs on being right hand man!” Seamus howled with laughter slapping him hard on the back and dispelling any idea in Harry’s mind that they would seriously believe that Harry could be the next dark lord. The teasing was a little awkward for both Pansy and Draco though as they thought about their parents and everything they had been through. Yes, Lucius had joined of his own free will when Voldemort’s ideas had aligned with his. He had believed that it would be political conquest, but it had dissolved into madness and terror. He had tried to escape only to be forced with mind control spells. Now nobody believed that story and he would forever and always be known as Voldemort’s right hand. “Seriously though, he really must be off his rocker to think you’ll be the dark lord Harry…You wouldn’t hurt a mouse”
“You can’t, Uncle Sev’ and if it wasn’t you it would have been somebody else. Dumbledore planned it. Why else have a meeting in a pub during a war? I don’t understand why but he did, I’m sure of it i there a way that he could have...Known what she would say and manipulate it so she would say it where he was heard?” Harry bit on the inside of his cheek looking into the black unfathomable eyes of the Hogwarts professor who seemed to take in everything he said before slowly nodding.
“True, my heart, which is why I need you to do something I would never dream of asking” Severus own breathing stalled at the words of his friend knowing what was going to be asked of her, but Narcissa gave a smile saying easily and confidently
“You may have failed to notice, Ron, but I’m not a girl” Harry grumbled looking around the hall feeling as though everyone was looking at him. He supposed that he should be glad that a lot of students had already gone home for the winter.
“Thanks! You know…You’re only the third person that has said that to me!” Ginny told him her happy smile becoming clouded “Luna said it before I even told her, Charlie said it when I told him, and now you…”
“Dumbledore assumed control and said that there was no need. I tried to send word to Harry’s guardians but my letters went unread” Tormuld looked troubled but Harry knew that if any letters had reached the Dursley’s they would have burnt them on sight. “Is there anything else you would like to discuss about the accounts?”
“Professor Filius Flitwick of Hogwarts” Dumbledore said straight away and Narcissa nodded in a sort of agreement. The charms teacher was somebody she would have probably requested as well as he was one of the best spell casters in the country. Tormuld looked thoughtful but then nodded with a sly half-smile that nobody seemed to notice. He moved around his desk and then threw some floo powder into the fire that was burning without giving heat.
“Of all the creatures you could like, why snakes, Harry?” Draco asked as they were stood in front of a magically sealed enclosure where an emerald green snake was sitting on a rock his eyes fixed on them. It wasn’t that Draco minded, he found it rather amusing that Harry Potter the boy who lived liked snakes which was the animal of Slytherin house. Harry shifted uncomfortably his cheeks flushing in an adorable way while he cast nervous eyes around making sure nobody could hear them as he whispered;
“Oh lord, Irish, look at you!” Pansy laughed at their friend, after making sure he wasn’t hurt, and then the good-natured boy joined in wiping his face with the back of his hand.
“It is used to treat most poisons” Harry answered instantly determined to prove that he had been reading the potions book Severus had given him. It was something he devoured each night before bed even when Draco told him he was crazy. Severus rewarded him with another thin smile his dark eyes almost shining as he nodded;
The last time it had been used was when Draco had been bonded to Severus as godson it was fitting that this was where he would be officially made Severus and Remus’ son. Both men were already there standing in front of the altar dressed in their finest robes. Harry suspected Remus had borrowed from Lucius as he was sure his soon-to-be father would never pick out such a fancy robe for himself. Severus had a splash of colour on his robe.
Draco glanced at his reflection in the full-length mirror. He was wearing the traditional Malfoy colours of Green and silver with a fitted green coat which clung to his body and caused his handsome face to stand out even more. The maid styled his hair and cooed over how good looking he was, but Draco ignored her focusing instead on the scribbled letter he had still in his pocket. It had been only two weeks since he had last seen Boy but part of him was almost convinced that it had all been a dream. He had tried to return to the forest hoping that Boy would be there, but his father and mother had kept him busy with arrangements for the next three nights of balls.
“Wow” Draco and Harry said together and Draco almost blenched at the amount of work that would have to go into studying Alchemy but then he heard Nino’s voice calling to them from a short space away and he turned to see his teacher walking towards them in trousers and a mustard yellow short sleeve top. Her long hair was pulled into a messy bun complete with wand sticking out of the centre of it. There was a tall, slim Japanese Man beside her who, in Draco’s limited opinion, was the most beautiful man he had ever seen. He had a perfect oval face with dusky brown almond shaped eyes and a full mouth that almost looked bee stung. His hair was lightened brown with reddish yellow highlights and his smile was so wide that it showed off perfectly white straight teeth. His eyes crinkled in the corners and there was a smattering of moles over his face. He was wearing denim dungarees with a flannel shirt and two mismatched shoes one red and one yellow and yet it didn’t look stupid but cute.
“What is…My costume?” Harry asked looking at the costume that had arrived by special delivery along with Draco’s. It was spread out on his bed, but he still couldn’t tell what the hell it was meant to be. It was emerald green however which Draco insisted matched his eyes. There were realistic flowers around one side along with a soft floaty sort of robe that shimmered like dew in the early morning.
“Yes, Harry, be happy...We love you, so much, never forget that, we love you and I’m sorry we aren’t there.” Lily’s voice faded as the letter dropped down back to the desk and became a letter again. Her voice seemed to echo in the silent office and Harry let himself cry as he was pulled up onto Narcissa’s lap being held tightly
“No chance, you would have survived, Potter, you’re strong. But there is a real chance you would have been manipulated by Dumbledore and I would have said something stupid trying to impress you and had you hate me” Draco sighed fairly convinced of that but Harry didn’t know anything that Draco could have said that would ever make him hate him. He could be arrogant sometimes, and very rarely he could make him think of a thinner and more handsome Dudley, but over all he tried to be good and Harry knew that he cared deeply. “You would have made other friends and I would have been jealous, and we would have been something stupid, rivals, like Sev’ and your father”
“You will still be a werewolf, there would still be a risk but you would be able to keep your mind. Curl up into a nice dog bed and sleep the night away perhaps” The delivery was dry and almost cruel but Remus knew that he was only teasing. “ I admit that asking you was one of the reasons I agreed to accompany Harry today and of course because I believed he deserved somebody that would tell him some good of his father...He apologised to me, Lily wrote to me saying that she would have wanted me for the boys godfather but Potter spoke an add on, and he apologised...And forgave me...Just as Harry did”
“So, what did you think of Mr Shurley?” Lucius asked after the teacher had stepped through the floo and Harry gave a smile. He had liked Chuck. He was so completely different from any of the witches and wizards he had met so far, more like a muggle in both dress and personality, but he had a way about him that wasn’t quite muggle and when he produced a guitar out of nowhere and began playing and singing Harry was convinced that he wanted him to be his teacher.
“You are not an idiot Harry, far from it, you have just been through a lot, but you’re getting better every day”
“Little Master Draco is right little Master Harry, youse is not an idiot! Youse was just very bad hurten! But youse is getting stronger! We has gotten youse when you are feelings a little weaken!” Jinx put in gently and Harry’s arms snaked around Draco’s middle hugging him tightly.
“Always fun, last year she pulled out a pensive of Merlin from his time at Hogwarts. No idea how she manged to get it, she did say she would teach more of Japanese history this year so that would be fun. Did you know that their wizards worked with samurai?” Draco was buzzing happily as he went through to his own room and Harry continued to smile before shaking his head and going to his own bathroom. The novelty of having his own shower would never wear off, Harry was sure of that, and he sighed happily as he stepped in and turned the brass tap.
“I promise, Pants, you are my best female friend.” Harry smiled letting his head rest on the bobbed head while Draco rolled over and stuck his bum up in the air. Pansy watched him with a giggle before slapping his left butt check hard causing the Malfoy heir to let out a yelp and sit up right with his blonde hair over his face.
“Ickle Cissy…Come close…” Bella whispered and against her better judgement Narcissa did as she was bid. She leaned her face against her older sister’s mouth her stomach churning at the smell that was coming off her. A tongue darted out smearing her from chin to ear before she whispered “Horcruxes…Our Lord Made Horcruxes…Find them Ickle Cissy…Bring back our lord…”
“I wish you a very happy new year, please take this bread that you might always have something to eat in the coming year and this coal so that you might always have heat”
“Never, they always start out strong but they can never keep the pace. Of course the press will be all over them because they have just signed that Johnson fellow” Magenta said with more confidence as her daughter and Harry looked at the other two adults feeling uncomfortably like a spare part.
“Thank you.” Severus found his way to giving her a smile that reached his eyes before tilting his head to one side. “And your next question?”
Once he had washed and dried the dishes, carefully putting them away and avoiding all Dudley’s attempts to get him to drop them Harry went out into the garden. As always his aunt was wearing the only pair of gardening gloves though she just stood over him with her hands resting on her narrow hips. She would chat happily to neighbours when they walked passed but otherwise she only spoke to bark orders at him. His aunt kept him working in the garden all day, he was only allowed one stop to use the bathroom and he used the time to take some water from the tap to drink before having to go back out and clean out the shed.
“I thought so, you will need to have them as well but not yet, we have to get him healthy first. The same with fixing his bones”
“My hips, it feels like my hip is twisting off” Harry bit out reluctantly his eyes falling away from the teacher as his ears turned a bright shade of red.
Thank-you for all your good lucks! I made it through my test xD Now I should be able to relax a little >.<
“Master Draco’s room hases lots of Broomes and posters!” Jinx said happily guiding Harry to sit down in one of the chairs while clicking her fingers. Two bottles of Butter Beer appeared and Draco moved from bed to sit in the chair opposite his friend. Harry was wearing a pair of Draco’s pyjamas spelled to fit him and his hair was even more of a mess than it had been all day. His feet barely touched the floor and he had an unbelievably cute feeling all around him. Draco had never thought of himself as the protective type. Like comforting somebody he had no idea how to be protective. It wasn’t something that was needed much in his circle of friends. None of them needed either very often as they were all as self assured as he himself and yet there was something about Harry that called to him. There was no great distance in their ages, a month at most, but oddly he felt the older of the two and he wanted to look after him.
“Bella” Narcissa breathed watching as the guards left the room and shut the thick metal door behind them. For a moment her will and determination were gone. There was no way she could talk to Bella, she wasn’t strong enough.
“I do hope that the ministry is aware that Harry is the victim in all of this” Lucius said his fingers running up and down his neck soothingly and Delores gave a smile showing small almost pointed teeth. Her eyelashes fluttered at Luicus as though she thought she was attractive.
“Ms Nightingale to the manor if you please, Jinx” “Yes mistress Malfoy, Jinx is doing that right away” Jinx said excitedly and Draco rolled his eyes at her though it was with a great fondness. She had been his nanny elf as a baby and she was fiercely loyal to the Malfoy’s though she was always happy to show off the manor. “Little Master Harry, youse is to be holden tightly to Master Draco! Jinx will take care of you! No need to worry!”
With all that is going on in the world at the moment I debated with myself if I should write and post fanfiction. There are more important things after all. But I decided that the world needs distractions I hope that this helped someone to smile at least a little.
“Mister Dobble, forgive me, but might I bother you for a glass of water?” She asked delicately making herself appear as fragile as possible. It had always been a trait she had carried well knowing how to appeal to the core instinct of men making them want to do whatever she wanted them. Of course, they always believed that it was their idea. Of the three Black girls, Bellatrix, Andromeda, and herself, she had always been the smallest the one with the doll like features. Those traits had been honed to perfection by her parents who had adored dressing her in the prettiest of dresses and making her seem even more like a doll. Lucius was the only one that had seen beyond that, that had liked her for the mind she had over her pretty face.
“Thanks, Pops” Harry whispered looking at the wand wondering what his own would look like. Taking a deep breath, he handed it back over to his second father, In just a few short moments he would know.
“But what if I can never do it? What if I’m a squib?” Harry worried at his lower lip his eyes closing as a cloud moved over the face of the sun.
“I don’t hate you, Uncle Sev” Harry said eventually his face pressed into the thin chest of the older man. He smelt of herbs and spices and smoke that came from standing around cauldrons all day. He thought that he was odd, maybe he should have reacted with anger at the confession but he truly didn’t hate the man that was crying beside him. His life would have perhaps been different if Snape hadn’t have told Voldemort but was it likely? Was it normal for headmasters to conduct interviews in pubs? Didn’t they have an office? And if not why didn’t they put up a privacy spell? Uncle Lucius used them all the time when they were in public. “I think Dumbledore had been manipulating you for a long time, Uncle Sev, maybe he didn’t know that it would be you but I think he expected somebody to hear them that night”
“Nice...Nice to meet you, Professor” Harry flushed seeing the teasing light that came to her dark eyes. It was a smile that made him nervous while at the same time oddly comfortable and he tried not to stare too hard on the mole on her chin.
“Not that its any of your business but I came back because...I wanted some time...To be normal, a kid, I’ve never really had that...In the time between the end of the war and coming here...I got to thinking that ever since Hagrid came and saved me from my aunt and uncle I never really got to be me...I didn’t even get to figure out who me was...”
“Keep them as pets, you can return them after the twelve days if you don’t accept the court. But you should these are beautiful”
“Oh? From where I was standing it appeared that you were racing. Dinner is ready, you will have chance to play again tomorrow. Harry, Draco, you both looked fantastic on the broom, such a pity Hogwarts doesn’t allow first years on the team” She smiled before pointing her wand at them and muttering an incantation that brought their brooms back to earth. “I understand the boys being excited but you, Lucius dear, are supposedly an adult”
“A Malfoy never makes threats Madam only promises and I promise you if you say anything about this being character building in my hearing again I will feed you to the cats you are so fond of” As he spoke Lucius carefully lifted the back of Harry’s shirt showing the toad the marks made by his aunt and uncle. Delores didn’t react but she did clear her throat again while Mrs Figg let out a strangled sob hobbling over to him as fast as her legs could take here as she said;
The muscles in his arms twitched for a moment remembering the way Dudley would push him out of the way in the lunchroom at school and how Vernon would shove him into his cupboard. The actions had been easy, you just moved the muscles and shoved. A tingling sensation curled around his body and he tried to focus it into his hands and then towards the doll, but it soon fizzled out.
The outfit wasn’t a robe or a dress but something in between and when he investigated the mirror, he found that he liked it very much. A wand was in the box and he smiled as he picked it up laughing with delight when it shot sparks from the tip.
“Oh, she’s with her latest lover, Roman I think his name is, he is the most frightful bore I have ever known. She and Daddy will be with us for lunch but I thought I would come to the gate and meet you” Pansy said and Harry blinked slowly at the casual way she said lover while in the same breath saying that both her parents were joining them for lunch. Neither Draco nor Narcissa seemed to think anything of it and he wondered if that was normal for Wizards.
“It’s…It’s Victor, Victor Krum…” She admitted her whole face pink as she shifted nervously in her chair. Harry stared open mouthed trying to wrap his head around that confession. It had come completely out of left field. “You don’t have to look at me like that, it’s true. We’d played against each other a few times in friendlies, and he remembered me from Hogwarts, you know that year…Anyway, one game after we had just broken up, he could tell that I was off my game, and he was really sweet. It was a few years after that we decided to date, after he retired from playing professional and became under coach to EE, the rest is history. He is a really great guy.”
The Jewish ladys speech was from a survivor I met at a holocaust memorial service when I was a child. I never got her name but she was an amazingly brave woman
“It’s no trouble at all, Harry dear, you are family and Blacks take care of family” Narcissa said with a gentle smile caressing his cheek in a way that she often did when he had bumped his knee or was being awkward. Harry blinked slowly again his green eyes shining with something close to happiness. “You must be brave Harry and remember we will be with you all the time”
“Yes, sir, still have it to this day.” Remus answered tapping his wand that was carefully stored in his wand pocket on his robe.
“Don’t apologise, where does it hurt?” She asked doing the massages she had been learning. Unlike before it didn’t give him the same relief and he just felt himself growing red under the look the professor was giving him. He had only just met her and he was behaving like a child, she was going to think he was a freak or a baby. “Harry, I can’t help if you don’t say, dear”
Moony was waiting for him in his usual place his lumbering brown body hidden in the thicket of trees amber eyes watching him closely as he approached. Severus was in a tree nearby pretending not to be bothered about him as he bristled his feathers, but he soon flew down and took some of the seed he offered. Boy took it from the chickens, and it was the best feed possible as the Dursley’s spared no expense when they could show off. Severus pecked happily at the seed and was just finishing when Draco and Nimbus rode through the forest. Severus was fond of Draco and immediately flew to sit on his shoulder leaving Boy amused as he stroked Moony’s neck with his fingertips.
