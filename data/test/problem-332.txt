wasn't popular
Harry blushed when a big pair of grey eyes focused solely on him. It had been pretty easy to realize it hadn't been Malfoy, but saying so would show how much he
"Did you just copy my lie?"
"Thank you" Draco intertwined their fingers, and for a brief moment the world stood still "I have to go"
"At least they... Maybe they are thinking about it. Maybe they were silent because they didn't know what to say but-"
"You can tell me"
And so Harry leaned in, taking Draco's lips in his own, his free hand sliding in between their bodies to feel his cock, to touch him so he could feel as good as he felt.
Ron did a double take of the blonde head on his friends bed but said nothing of it, shrugging and jumping to his own bed, clearly exhausted.
Draco frowned, but only nodded "That's very kind of you"
to live in. With some magic he had made sure everything was in order and he had even placed a fireplace in one of the walls.
"Yeah, Potter, yeah they do"
Ah, right. They still had to go see Elliot and Noah about this. Harry wasn't sure about anything. He had trusted the aurors before, but right now? He trusted Draco.
Hope you liked this one! It took me a lot of time to finish it, I kept changing parts and adding others. It's a long one!
"Shush" She moved a piece of her hair away from her face, moving closer to him on the bench "Look, I don't think this is the best place to discuss this but... if someone is truly trying to take over the school we are not going to allow it" She took his hand "We have done it before"
"That's good" Lucius didn't move, waiting for him to calm down.
An uncomfortable silence fell between them and Harry started to feel anxious and awkward. He quickly sat up, knees pressed to his chest like he had seen Draco do so many times during all those nights together and how he had done all those years living under the stairs. Maybe he should just leave, forget that night ever happened and go back to his room, fall asleep, have nightmares, rinse and repeat.
Draco nodded, his cheek rubbing against the fabric of his shirt "Morning"
After switching the tea cups from one cupboard to another, he chewed down on his lower lip, looking around the room for
"Aren't you tired?"
"How about you leave?" Elliot stared at him, almost as if he was going to hit him.
"Yes, why not? I've stayed at the Tower have I not?"
"Yes, whoever did that to you is out there and I don't feel safe here"
"It's about Draco"
"Sure. I'll... I'll see you there" Harry gave a step forward, not really knowing what to do.
Draco looked up at her, right as she grabbed his left arm and pinned it down to the table, his other arm clutched now by the guy that had a hand on his shoulder.
Was Malfoy trying to soothe him?
"Granger went to sleep a while ago" Malfoy said, his back still turned to Harry and his body under the covers. Harry knew how strange it was to see him there, in his bed, and still it felt as if it had to be this way.
"It was your idea to investigate with Malfoy and the other two"
"I think he's at the Tower now"  Ron said, shrugging but it was clear they were trying to leave Harry alone. Or maybe Harry was avoiding them. Or... something. Noah had no time for other people's drama.
"Run!"
"Okay. I have the cloak"
to do" He bit down on his lower lip "Something that made me think that... the way I was... the way I
"There wasn't any. Perhaps that's what they took. Blood from... Three attacks. Or more, we don't know for how long this has been planned."
over and over, and he wasn't fine with it. Yeah, he had told himself he was and that it didn't matter but truth was he liked him so,
"No, yeah, I know. I just..." No, Harry didn't know, but he didn't know what else to say. He just imagined that surely all boys wanted to be on top, like, always?
"You can't imagine, really?"
It would have been much better if it had stayed as a shapeless mass, but it didn't. Slowly but surely it took form of something they both vaguely remembered.
but he didn't want to be leave him. What would they do then? He tried not to think about it, but an uneasiness filled around his heart, making his heartbeats more difficult and painful.
"Fine, mate, how about flying? Gin asked you for some tips, right? Maybe try and fly around a bit more? That always calmed you down"
"In fact" Draco looked at him, hurt in a way Harry couldn't explain. He had never seen such a look in his face. So bare and honest. "It was quite the opposite, you absolute tosser"
"I'm sorry, Draco" He whispered, memories of that night trying to surface. "He lied to me too"
Draco liked most of his classes -he actually liked school- but sometimes he wondered if he'd have chosen different subjects given the... freedom to do so. Maybe if he had been more passionate about his electives he would have been top of the class. Maybe.
There was a small
Also: It took me so long to write this one because for some reason I was already writting chapter 23 when I should've been writting this one hahahah
Harry looked at him by his side "So..."
"I never blamed you, but thank you for saying that"
things of his life, they had dared to spread lies about how he felt about his parents' deaths... would it be so bad to have them gossiping about his love life
if it was!"
much"
"Yes. My parents left me money. Lots of it"
"Just thinking about... Well, Lucius"
The creature lunged at them and almost as if they had practiced it both Draco and Harry ran in opposite directions. It was a nice strategy, of course, if the thing wanted to go after one of them, it would leave the other one open for an attack.
He covered himself with the sheets and pulled the blankets over both of them, knowing Draco would wake up freezing without them.
"You know I don't see you like an all-good hero, Harry or a golden boy or whatever the Prophet came up with this time"
from the slytherin. Harry almost expected him to complain or say something mean about house elves. He didn't.
Alright, it was now or never. He walked close to Malfoy to get out of Slytherin, not caring if he bumped into him or not.
? It wasn't proper and it wasn't smart. Draco couldn't remember a moment in his childhood or adolescence when he was allowed to just play in the dirt.
(See the end of the chapter for
The blond had his eyes closed and seemed a bit sleepy "Hm?"
The day the letter arrived they were already inside the Owlery. It hadn't been on purpose, and they weren't expecting it to arrive at that exact moment, but sometimes life surprises everyone. They had gone up there to check on Hedwig, who was unable to fly long distances thanks to her mangled wing. Harry remembered how she had protected him that night, saving him but falling down as if dead. He had been extremely happy to find her alive. She had been with him since the beginning, that small white thing. He loved her.
"Well, Ginny was pretty upset and I know you care about her so... I thought you would want to go talk to her"
"Friendship is not all that matters in life. That's why you would never survive in Slytherin"
The drawing was almost complete, and an exact copy to the original no less. He allowed a moment to feel pride of his plan and the way it was all coming together. He had finally repurposed the Room of Requirement to do what he wanted. It had been easy, considering the state it was in. After his magic was done, the room would probably be drained of all his remaining power.
"I should find my parents and say hello... Get us some drinks?"
"Surely Malfoy caused the situation" Weasley said, but his tone was almost a question.
something.
There was silence, both Slytherins held each other's gazes until Elliot finally nodded, defeated. Harry hadn't thought about the blood -or hair, or skin- the attacker had taken, but it could be useful.
" He didn't mean to say it  but it came out, from fear and frustration. He could feel Harry's reaction but wasn't brave enough to look at him, so instead he walked over to the bed and placed the paper over the covers "This is old magic"
Draco looked away, looking slightly less angry. "I knew his parents. They were...
"They made me sleep under the stairs, in a really small... thing. I used my cousin's old clothes. They never fit well. I had no toys, nothing was mine in there. They always told me to pretend like I didn't exist" It was almost as if he couldn't stop now that he was saying all of this "They never hit me. They would shove me, or tell me I was nothing. Once I broke my arm and it took them t-..."
Harry wanted to say how much he liked spending time with him, and how little he wanted that to change. He wanted to say he believed Draco hadn't attacked anyone.
"You care a lot about what people think"
"Each turn we say two truths about ourselves and one lie, the other one has to guess which one is the lie"
Of course this little change in their sleeping habits hadn't gotten in the way of their 'sexual awakening'. Harry was quite sure it only made him want to touch Draco more. They were as careful as they could, pulling each other into empty classrooms during free periods, or broom closets, or bathroom stalls... They hadn't gone all the way yet, neither wanting to have sex in a dusty room or in a bathroom where more than once they would be in an extremely uncomfortable position or hurrying not to get caught.
"Yeah?"
"Do you take them?"
Draco seemed at a loss, but after a few seconds, he smirked. "You sap"
Harry looked towards the closed door and wondered what was transpiring inside. Had Noah asked for Elliot to wait outside? Or had it been Bea's plea? If he could advice something, he would advice for them to keep her at arm's length but... could he? should he?
"Harry deserves..."
on him for all he had done.
Bea had a small smile on her face, standing next to Harry's chair. He could see his own wand on one of her hands, and he really wanted to reach out.
Harry's friends had come over for a couple hours almost every day, their visits were short and even though he knew it was his fault -and all the Ministry's rules- Harry never complained to him. Which was nice. Living with his father, he always heard about all the things he did wrong, how he was failing and being an utter disappointment. He didn't get that with Harry, not one bit. Harry... liked him, and accepted him for who he was. It was overwhelming at times.
"Draco, you... Don't think about that" He was alarmed, if anything happened to Draco what would he do? He couldn't even entertain the idea.
"I wouldn't consider freedom of choice a luxury," Draco tried, unsure as to what his friend was thinking. She had always been a strong willed woman, who had agreed to marry him in an attempt to satisfy his family and retain her status. At the time, he had wanted the same things... but when he called off their engagement, he had gotten the impression she was going to date who she really wanted. Hm. "It was good to see you, let's meet for tea sometime"
“I'm sure you are going to see him today, calm down” Hermione said, trying to hide her distaste for his relationship with Malfoy. It was strange, how despite the new found peace between her and Draco, she was still weary of their relationship. Harry was half sure it was because she was always looking out for him, and wasn't sure if he was the right one. Sometimes, he wanted to snap at her and just tell her off. But most of the times, he knew Draco was the one thing that felt like the future and that was enough.
If he felt safe he probably would have tried to help Malfoy. He had nothing against the older boy, yes, he knew he was a Death Eater and he knew they had done terrible things. But as far as he knew the worst thing Malfoy had done was getting other death eaters into Hogwarts. Noah was sure they would have found a way regardless of who helped them. So he couldn't hate Draco.
"I would love to"
Draco only nodded,  not quite sure what he should or shouldn't say. For some strange reason, though, he felt like he could trust Bell.
"I was proud, as well"
"You need to speak to them, tell them, Draco. They can't know otherwise"
The young slytherin smirked at him, and it chilled Harry to the bones. It was odd, seeing someone so young look so... menacing. "Nobody did this to me. You should go back to your bedroom, Potter, or I might tell the Headmistress someone came to see me"
"I wasn't over thinking things"
"Yes" Hermione nodded, opening a little parchment for her notes.
"They need to see what you are! So they won't forget" The girl was getting impatient at the other boy's hesitance "Just do it! You know it's there. You know what he
"Yeah..." Harry looked at their shoes at the edge of the lake, would they ever have another morning like this one?
Oh, Merlin. Harry was sure Draco already knew about this -he had his sources of information-, but perhaps that's why he was so jumpy lately?
Draco left his shoes and then stepped on the snow as if it was nothing, starting to slowly walk towards the surface of the frozen lake, his legs trying to keep balance.
Draco swallowed, finally taking off his green tie "I... Thank you" It was but a whisper, just enough for Harry to hear it. It was enough. More than enough. Harry smiled.
Draco barely tilted his head, a frown the only tell of his preoccupation "You act as if no one ever told you that they-..."
"Can she do that?"
With everything that had happened he couldn't risk it. Not for someone that was a stranger. For Elliot? Or Bea? Maybe.
good at it, clearly. There's... It's okay"
He remembered seeing that happen during sixth year, and after what had happened between them in that bathroom he couldn't imagine Draco going there to be comforted. Did he think about it? About how Harry almost killed him?
"Arranged, but they do love each other. I guess that's why they think I would be happy with Astoria" Draco moved from his chest, looking into his green eyes. Merlin, so green.
Harry sighed and let go of her hand, touching his forehead but nothing hurt. Voldemort was dead and he had to get used to it.
"Uh... Of course..."
"Draco, I-" He didn't know what he wanted to say, because just as he was about to speak, Draco's mouth kissed the head of his cock and it was too much. A whimper escaped his lips, his knuckles turning white from clutching the sheets. If he didn't concentrate he was going to finish way too soon. Merlin, it was so
"So that's our first task, then" She said "Does anyone know anything about the other boy?"
Elliot shrugged "Nobody is listening to us"
Harry frowned "You look relieved"
"I think it's a great idea"
"Do you have
, and you call
"Alright, enough!" Harry stopped and grabbed him by the arm, making him half-turn to look at him. "I know it's hard, but... no one blames you"
There was a small silence and Draco started walking towards the entrance of the 'maze', his steps were strong but he seemed incredibly small next to the bookcases. "Come on, Potter, light the way, will you?"
"What happened next?" Noah was quiet, and very serious.
"Do you want to?" He found himself asking, hands on Draco's waistband. He definitely wanted to have him naked again, but he wasn't sure if the blond wanted to have sex or not.
Merlin, he loved her.
I am truly sorry, this shouldnt have taken so long. I am in med school and barely got any sleep, have tons of work to do lately and it's killing me.
finishing school. He tried not to think what would happen once they left.
"If you don't want to be here" Draco said, his voice slow, awfully so "You can leave"
"Yes?" His voice still sounded a bit shaky, as if he was trying to hide some tears.
Alright, Harry hadn't been completely honest about that but she didn't need to know. Besides he was frustrated at how she had rejected his help. Or any help, really.
was” Draco crossed his arms, frowning back at her.
"I'm okay... we are okay" He repeated, and Draco kept nodding, one of his hands on one of Harry's wrists, the other one still clutching his shirt.
"Why does she do it?" Draco asked, staring at the grass underneath his shoes. The garden was one of the few places that felt close to freedom. Sadly, he felt like a bird inside a never-ending cage.
but when Voldemort came back... they were doing some weird magic"
This was how they worked: his father would hurt him and then Narcissa would try to soothe him and mend his wounds. It could be too much. Draco pressed his face to the pillow, closing his eyes and breathing as slow as possible. He wanted to stop hurting all over, to shut down his emotions... He had done it so many times, why was it hard now?
Draco didn't know what to expect when he left the kitchen, but seeing Harry standing in his living room wasn't it. His back was turned to him, and he was looking at the pictures over the fireplace. There weren't many, but just enough to make it seem as if his family was a loving one. Back at the manor they had portraits -which were much more refined and appropriate- but they had some photographs that his mother had insisted on having in this house.
He looked over at them, resting his fork next to his plate because his food was pretty underwhelming and he wasn't hungry anyway. "I am just tired"
His parents pretty much knew, now the school knew... It was just a matter of time before the press...
"Ron helped me yesterday, I don't
"I wouldn't dare" Draco got up, using their joined hands to pull the other boy up. Without really thinking, almost as if he had done this a million times, he put a hand on Harry's back to keep him in place. Harry was a bit overwhelmed by the closeness and his hand and... everything.
" Draco sneered, his eyes set over Harry's shoulder, shooting daggers to the other two that waited a few meters away. His friends knew it was better to let him handle the
"I'm not going to get
"He's pulling away from us. We are his friends and we care, could you...?"
"Why would she think that?"
Death eaters then. Harry tried to
Second family? No. The only family he knew.
"Guess you are right" he whispered, kissing him again. "We should sleep" Harry moved a bit closer to him, their legs intertwined.
That didn't mean he couldn't... try to figure it out on his own. Right?
"You would be justified if you did" He answered, his eyes finally meeting hers "I have been horrible to you. With no reason"
Their breakfast resumed its usual rhythm, or at least the one it used to have before the war. They ate and talked and laughed. It was strange seeing Ron and Hermione together. He had always been a supporter of his friends, and known this is how they were going to end up. But still, weird.
to say.
There was a small shared smile, before someone called for them from the dining table.
The winter vacations were coming quickly, and after that little note the idea of receiving letters from Draco was tempting. How much would he tell? Would he share how things went with his parents? Or would he deflect and just talk about... Anything else? Harry wanted to know much more about him, and wondered if maybe Draco would find it easier to open up via letters.
"Cuddly, are you?"
Truth was Draco needed him, his
does Harry deserve? Because everyone knows what he
"No, Narcissa. He is a man now, let him face whatever he has to on his own. He made that pretty clear, no?"
They stared at each other and started laughing. True, joyous laughter at the absurdity of everything.
"You could love someone else"
Elliot's eyes widened and he stopped pushing back for a brief second, causing extreme pain on Draco who tried to keep the door from giving in. He was about to curse or scream when the other slytherin pushed back again.
"Shut up and listen to me. In order to make it believable I
"That's... He's probably scared. I mean, it's Malfoy"
"What do you mean?"
"What do you want to talk about?"
"Get out"
"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry"  Harry hugged him, tightly. It was unexpected, but he returned the hug, breathing softly and trying to calm himself as well.
the prick? You are the
"That's impossible" He said, forgetting his hot drink and getting up from the table "I told them I didn't want to see him"
"I think we should support him, Ron"
"McGonagall wishes to see you"
"Where's the blood?"
"Let's go. It's just a couple floors up and... we are just going to check what it is. Surely it's not inside the Room anyway"
He had lived most of his childhood and teenage years in fancy dinners and balls and parties. He knew about gossip and manipulation and overindulgence.
"Yes"
What if it meant something bad was already there?
Harry was startled at that. What? Why did he want to know that? He looked back at the auror, unsure.
"In here, one moment..." He rushed to the living room, hitting his foot with a chair on the way.
"Oh" She looked truly sad, and about to start crying. He didn't mind much, because he guessed that if you are trapped inside a bathroom for eternity then you have a lot of things to cry about. Besides, he went there to do the same, didn't he?
"You got it, mate" They high fived, causing Hermione to groan and roll her eyes.
Harry saw his mistrust, even if he said the opposite. Slowly, he moved his hand down from his arm towards his hand, smiling when his palm touched Draco's warm skin.
“Did you do it?”
. Bell left the Room of Requirement hurrying towards the wing where the aurors had been given accommodations. Of course he had hidden things in 'plain sight' and
Harry closed the map for a moment, leaving it under his pillow, to lay on his side and touch Draco's cheek.
When his fingers became wrinkled and disgusting, he left the bath, drying himself with a towel like some sort of muggle. He changed quickly into a fresh pair of clothes, something informal but all black. It was a good color, it made him feel safe. And he needed
itself?"
"Noah"
"Shut up" Draco took the quill and wrote down on the paper, not letting him see until he was done.
He fixed his glasses on his face after cleaning them up with one of the sheets and reached out to touch Draco's shoulder. The blonde boy opened his eyes immediately. A light sleeper? That was also unexpected.
Draco felt his blood go cold, all of it straight to his legs. He wanted to run away, to run away from the whole world. He didn't. Instead, he did the other thing he knew: he pushed all of his feelings as deep inside of his heart as he could, unable to cope with them at the moment.
"About?"
"Then I'll shut you up myself" His words died over Draco's lips, and then they were kissing and Draco couldn't quite remember why he had been so distraught moments before. How could something so good end? He wanted to press himself against Harry so much so they would become one person. He had wanted to feel that ever since they had had sex. But they couldn't do it, not in there and not with him in house arrest.
"Mother, that's a mistake"
Lucius moved back, staring at her with confusion on his face "What do you mean? I have always given him anything he wanted"
"Congratulations?"
"This is also good" Draco finally spoke, his mind racing "Actually, this is how we catch them"
"The attacks. I've been wondering... The cuts on their arms, right here" He pointed at the inside of his left wrist "At first we thought it was to implicate me or some... Death eater, but what if that was just the cover up? What if they wanted the blood? Think about it, did you see any blood when we found Elliot?"
"I believe you had to think hard on my last one"
"I actually thought she would ask you for... Help"
Draco shrugged "They are powerful, that's why the ministry uses them"
There was a brief nod, and Draco knew that was all he could hope for. With a hand on Harry's arm, he pulled very gently. "We should go find Pansy. See you later, mom, father"
Chapter: Letters sent.
Draco looked up and nodded, holding down the page he had been reading for the last ten minutes. His mind was somewhere else, and his thoughts kept wandering around. It would be easier to just close the book and try to pass the time some other way, but what was the point?
"So? How did it go?"
Harry didn't remember. What he did remember was the war, the explosions, the smell of blood and death. Corpses. All over Hogwarts. He swallowed. "I can't remember"
Harry knew exactly where he had to go, but it didn't make it any easier.
When he looked down to his map again, he noticed a particular meeting happening inside an old classroom. Three aurors were there, all gathered up. Harry felt curiosity and his gut told him to go there, immediately, but that would mean leaving Draco alone and... No. One thing at a time.
Elliot wasn't looking at them or the papers, he was looking at some far away point. Was talking about the attack too much for him? Harry could imagine how hard it was.
I'm SO sorry it took this long to update! I was on vacation and I didn't have internet. I went to London (and the UK actually) so I had barely any time to write but I'm so inspired! It was so magical, you guys.
"Of course n-"
Draco gave him a silent stare, but it didnt say
It wouldn't be an easy path, but they were willing to walk together.
about him and he was a bit embarrassed by it. Yes, he didn't know essential things about Draco, but he had observed him so much on their sixth year that he did know
No. He had not. Last time he spoke to Pansy she had been quite clear about keeping some distance, to try and better her own reputation. He didn't blame her, but it had hurt. And Blaise? He knew nothing of him.
" Draco's tone was a warning, and he understood it immediately. Still, the aurors shouldn't talk to him that way.
"She can't do that"
Harry half groaned, sitting up and pulling at the food tray to eat a small bite of bread. It made him chuckle, but he only got up from his spot on the floor and walked towards the double bed, opening the sheets and laying down. It was soft, and they were together.
Draco grimaced "I guess that's her name" Something told Harry that the blonde knew exactly what her name was.
As if Draco didn't have a
"It's... A history book"
"He's not" Harry said firmly, causing him to stop talking "You are not a Death Eater anymore. You are not like your family. And you didn't kill his brother"
Draco gave him a look, as if wanting more information but Harry only shrugged "Fine, be mysterious."
Draco chuckled, and Harry had no idea what was funny but his lips smiled anyway.
He laughed "Everything's about you, hm? How fun...
"Professor, we-... I can help"
"You like taking risks, don't you?"
"It doesn't matter anymore"
"Ah, yes, you convinced me"
It wasn't only the panic attack, it was the memory. He remembered going through that maze with Cedric, he remembered that night in vivid detail. He remembered the soft dew and the dampness in the air, he remembered walking with wand in hand and not knowing if something bad was going to happen.
"Alright" Harry sighed and ran a hand through his hair "Stealing a wand from a professor? Totally your style" Malfoy arched an eyebrow but said nothing, probably waiting for a more thorough explanation "Hexing someone that embarrassed you? Yeah, maybe. Trying to actually murder someone? I... You are not capable of that"
"How come you were up there every night if you had this place?"
"Well, if an intruder gets inside it would give us time to... To..." Harry mumbled, looking down and pulling Draco closer to his body with his hands. It was automatic, thinking like that. Even when he tried not to, he would always be thinking ways to be safe, or to be as safe as possible. Sometimes he would catch himself finding every possible exit out of a room, and creating an escape plan inside his head. What was he expecting to happen? He wasn't sure, but his life was proof that something was always going to be lurking in the shadows.
"Merlin, Potter. Of course not"
"The ministry and us, the teachers, are working very hard to keep students safe. Alright?"
"But you might feel pressured to..."
"It's alright, Harry" Draco looked spent, his back still pressed against the wardrobe, shirt loose and a huge mark on his neck. "I'm okay" He moved away from the piece of furniture and grabbed Harry by his arms "It's just... it can't be like this"
"Thank you" Ron placed his hands around his cup of tea, giving him a worried look. Harry had no idea how he looked, but he reckoned he was exactly the same? True, he wasn't sleeping or eating much but his mental state was as good as he could remember. "The house looks..."
"Draco?" Neville stared, surprised for a few moments, before something dawned on him "Oh! We were supposed to meet at the... Oh, damn, I forgot! I saw the clouds and thought it would rain so I stayed inside and... Completely forgot. You must be pissed"
“Fine by me” Draco seized the bottle and slumped down on the floor, smiling "How did you even get the fire whiskey?" He poured some into a cup Noah had just given him and then gave the bottle back to Elliot.
I hope you enjoyed the trip, and thank you for staying if you stayed and waiting!
“I won't and neither will Elliot, trust me. He might be some cis straight guy but he gets it”
Harry knew Draco was furious, he could feel how tense he was. It was true that Draco didn't want to do anything special for his birthday, but he had managed to convince him to have dinner together and he wasn't about to let some fight fuck that up. Damn it. Even though he wanted to say a few things to the kid, he pulled at Draco's sleeve, giving him a look.
Harry felt a lump on his throat and a tightening around his heart. How to say this to her? He
of the kiss. And he had almost died moments before!
"Harry... " Draco was still there, he hadn't left and he was speaking in the same soothing voice he knew so well. Why? Why not leave him? Harry moved backwards until he hit the wall and that was enough for his knees to give up. He allowed himself to sit on the floor, knees immediately going up to his chest. In the worst moments of his life, deep down, he wished to be under the stairs again. It had been a horrible place to live, but it was small and
Whoever took him away, placed a blanket on his shoulders and said something to him, but he couldn't quite hear them. He knew what had happened but...
"How could you allow this to happen? The students are supposed to be safe"
Harry looked at him and shrugged "Yeah, he's quite alright. Maybe next time we could all go"
"It's not funny, guys" Ron said, and Harry was sure that -whatever had happened- had been bad.
of what he was feeling. "When I was... a child I would cry and... no one would come"
aurors are here now, they clearly know their job and wouldn't like us meddling"
The house needed more tidying up, so Harry left the couch and walked back to the kitchen, the one place he used the most. Not that he ate all that much, but tea was a must and it was the place where he had dinner with his friends -when they were able to visit, of course. And yes, maybe Hermione had helped him a bit to decorate, but it was a nice room.
Elliot sighed, clearly grateful for the help "What was it?"
a plan. It always seemed like they were ten steps behind whoever was doing this. Of course, if they wanted to recover the blood they would have to get a hold of Beatrice or Elliot. So they were bait.
She smirked "It's always been us three, really"
Alright. Odd.
Before Draco could say anything, a black owl arrived. Of course he recognized it, Andromeda's.
"But you..."
Draco had pressed himself harder against him, feeling the warmth of Harry's body and their bed.
"That's all I'm asking"
Of course, he wouldn't elaborate on it. He didn't want Harry thinking he was
Almost everything was set up.
His father gave him looks all night, almost as if he wanted to say something, or ask something but didn't know how to. That was a first. His father always seemed to speak his mind in his presence, but not now. Draco wanted to believe he had changed, or that he was picking his words carefully this time.
"What is it?"
"No. But the Ministry..."
Ron arched an eyebrow "That's boring"
"And where do you say we should sit?" Agh, right.
"I-" Draco tried to speak, but Harry had been so nonchalant about it that it was obvious the memory was painful. Extremely so. And he didn't know what to do or say to ease it for him. How to help someone with something like this? How to help
Harry read this letter on his bed - a double sized one because now that he could, why not? - with some bread crumbs on his chest from his breakfast. Draco's owl was eating avidly the seeds he left for her, clearly enjoying being inside. Hedgwig was not happy to have competition inside her own home so she'd try to bite his ear after the other owl had left. It was adorable.
He wasn't sure why his father was standing in front of him, he hoped he didn't want to have another talk. The past three weeks had been filled with conversations that didn't end well for him. He had tried not to 'pick a fight' with Lucius, but sometimes it was unavoidable. Especially when he felt so confused.
"Maybe she doesn't know how to talk to you about it" Draco seemed unconvinced by that. Harry knew Narcissa loved his child enough to lie to Voldemort, so this should be... a walk in the park. Right? Oh, Harry hoped so.
“I see” Draco sighed, hoping the best for them but realizing he could do nothing to help “I'm going to go to bed. Tell Harry...” He shook his head “Don't worry, he'll understand”
"What
As uncomfortable as it might be.
Draco hugged him, sitting next to him. Slowly making him lean into him. Harry wanted to hate him for doing this, for being there and making him weak but he couldn't. He pressed his face against his chest, allowing himself to be held.
, but it all felt... weird. So instead he smiled and said "Can I spend the night here?"
The burrow was bursting with sound and laughter, as there were too many people inside as usual. It only made the empty spaces left by those who left feel all the more real. Harry tried not to focus on that, but it was hard.
"How come you are such a bad student? I know you study, I've seen your books and notes" Draco frowned, his hands pressing softly against Harry's back to move him closer to his body "And now you don't have an excuse"
"Do you have your wand?"
"We will" Harry pushed his plate to the side -it was empty, thank Merlin- and got up from the table. "Draco?"
"Nothing. My three facts: I read muggle books, I actually liked aunt Andromeda as a kid, and I still have the same beliefs"
He opened his mouth to answer but it was Hermione who spoke "We are seeing this through, you don't think Harry is doing this for you, do you?"
"Really?"
And not only the cities, he wanted to hold his hand and walk through some lost forest in the middle of nowhere. He wanted to hold his hand without a care in the world, surrounded by shades of deep green, both of them suspended in time. That's how he felt in the woods.
He was pulled by the neck towards the blond, who was -sadly- taller than him. It wasn't by much, but Draco had to lean into the kiss almost every time.
to know "Just say it, Draco"
"Where do you go each night?"
Not right now, of course. He felt shocked with electricity, moving like a storm through his own living room. Hermione had visited that morning, drank some tea and smiled at his futile attempts. "You don't need to worry, Harry" she had said with that motherly tone he wondered how she got.
"I can't talk right now" He said, composed and collected. Harry wondered how much restraint it was taking him not to scream or hit him.
They kissed again, Harry pushing him down on the bed and placing himself on top of him. The pressure over his body felt good, fitting.
"I'm not saying they are" He sounded more frustrated now, but the grip on his arm was strong "I'm just saying that I trust you to keep a secret, not precisely them"
"I just knew. Always known, actually" He was whispering, clutching at his hand now. "It's just something you feel"
"Why?"
" Draco smiled, though "And no, I don't know how to... I just..." He shrugged.
"Draco, I-" And then he moved, like the Gryffindor he was, reaching out to him and grabbing his shoulders. For a moment, Draco expected to be kissed but Harry was clearly aware of the place he was at. They could be interrupted at any moment. "Are you okay?"
"I really shouldn't say"
"What else?" He asked, in a tone that no one should use with a headmistress.  If McGonagall was annoyed by it, she didn't show.
being attacked by Draco. Well, not
Harry had tried to explain to her what had happened and why they needed her help but she didn't care. After a couple minutes she had started to call Harry murderer like she had done that awful night, and they decided to leave her alone.
The loud chatter from everyone around him at the castle's entrance was deafening and his pulse started running fast. Shit. He tried to remind himself that he was
"Don't give me... t-that savior crap" Harry closed his eyes, trying to ignore the tears falling through his cheeks making him feel embarrassed
"You are cheating"
to go with him but he knew the blond wouldn't give in.
The Saturday Quidditch game had ended abruptly when the Hufflepuff's seeker caught the snitch way too early. Everyone felt cheated at how short it had been, maybe an hour? Harry had no idea as to why he had gone to watch the game, since he missed flying way too much for his own sake.
jealous half the time, but other than that it was fine. She was a quick thinker and quite skilled with a broom, it could come in handy.
It should only be a dinner, but his parents were trying to gain back on their status, so the dinner became a dinner party. Draco had immediately told Harry they shouldn't go, it would look bad for him, as if he had started to associate with dark wizards. As calm as ever, Harry told him it didn't matter, they would come up with those stories regardless of what he did. That settled some of Draco's concerns, hoping his parents wouldn't be too harsh on them.
There was no fondness towards Draco but it was fine, Harry couldn't expect everyone to treat him how he did. It would take time, but they would get there and the whole world would see how incredible Malfoy truly was.
Draco's tone was calm, as if nothing wrong was happening. He kept his gaze in both of them. Harry wanted to believe he was okay, but his bloody lip and his tussled hair told a different story.
"Oh, haven't told him about your
Draco raised an eyebrow, he was sure lots of people wanted a chance to get a candid of him and Potter but he couldn't think of one person that actually wanted to talk to him.
"This has nothing to do with how you raised me" He was getting desperate, was he never going to understand? "You wouldn't marry a man, and I wouldn't marry a woman. It's like that"
"Let's just go"
"Oh... oh no, if I'm cold, Malfoy..." Harry said, pulling him by his arm and making him fall. What happened next was something Harry should have seen coming: since Draco's body was falling due to gravity but Draco didn't want to fall face first against the ice, his hands reached out to Harry and Harry of course grabbed him -because he wasn't going to get Draco hurt- which meant one of Draco's knees hit the ice quite loudly, while the other one ended up between Harry's legs.
Silence.
After their first time together, Draco laid down on his bed unable to sleep, replaying the same things over and over. How comfortable he had felt, how safe, how loved. He had done things, and let things be done to him that were, without a doubt, shameful. Things anyone could use to embarrass him, things he wouldn't have allowed if it were anyone else. But it was Harry. The one boy he wanted, he had always wanted, really.
Noah thought it was pretty silly but always let him do it. He even waited for all their classmates to leave so he could do his thing without being seen.
Yup, that didn't make anything clearer. Malfoy must have noticed his face because he continued talking.
She sighed, frustrated and tapped a couple fingers against the desk, looking behind Harry's head. "I am sure you have noticed there is something odd with the school"
"We still haven't found what we are looking for!"
People were staring, of course, and doing nothing. It reminded him of himself and how he had stood by many situations without doing anything. The memories of muggles and muggle borns being tortured on his house's floor came to mind. In his memories, sometimes aunt Bella was holding the wand, others it was Voldemort or his father. It was rarely himself.
"It's better this way" He nodded once, keeping their eyes locked. Truth was, the other student had nothing to lose, but if they got into a fight... Worse that could happen to Harry was a nasty piece on The Prophet, but the worst that could happen to Draco was a year long stay at Azkaban. He wouldn't allow it, of course, but it could come to pass if some  ignorant kid accused him of any sort of violence.
"Everyone, everyone move away!"
He laughed and that made Harry smile a little bit, his arms around Draco. He had started to rub his back a bit, pulling him even closer.
to a lot of things, and most reactions would be exactly as you would expect in the muggle world" Alright, Harry could understand that. People were complicated with what they didn't know "But Malfoy is..."
"See you later? I'll try to find Neville"
"Yeah... I thought we needed a night out? But with, uhm, privacy"
"You didn't look like it"
“Cowards” Noah chuckled, shrugging.
"What's going on?" Neville asked, completely confused.
"Hey"
"And no one thought this was relevant?" Hermione was frowning "We could've... No, we still can. We have to look around the place of the attack"
"Standing on ice?"
Harry bit his lower lip and tried to focus on the class, but his eyes kept going to Malfoy who had left his wand over his desk and was already prepping his potion. Things had changed in Slytherin, many friendships - alliances? - had broke. He had no idea if Draco had any friends there anymore.
, he will think everything's fine"
part of the dance, right?"
"Second drawer"
Enjoy!
Alright, maybe the Room
The Ravenclaw shrugged, still occupying the empty table, but turned to talk to his friends sitting next to him.
The stairs would be a problem, considering how neither of them could stop kissing the other. Harry tried to remember where the steps were, unable to actually
Draco rolled his eyes and kicked him under the table. It wasn't done with any malice, so he laughed as well.
“What, her? She's a fun little thing” Bell said while placing strange artifacts around the circle, before taking some of the blood and drawing in the center of the circle. A smile was always on his face, as if he was getting exactly what he wanted.
Draco chuckled, smiling at the letter. He could hear Harry's voice and it only made him miss him more. Was this all they could have? Letters? For a whole year?
"And what will you do?" Ron asked, curious but not complaining. It was nice seeing his friends find love in each other, even as different as they were.
Harry chuckled "That's cause you got scared"
Harry looked at him without understanding what he was doing. Or why. McGonagall seemed surprised as well, but she nodded and looked at Harry, clearly waiting for him to leave. Harry didn't want to leave, he wanted to fight for the little safe space they had, he wanted to say
His eyes focused on her almost immediately. They were grey, the color of ice through a cloudy day, and yet she saw the fire behind them. Draco was furious, or determined, it was hard to know which. Hermione barely remembered the eleven year old she had met so long ago, the boy that was horrible but easy to read. Perhaps there had always been more to him than she thought. Did Harry see that?
Draco groaned, turning around towards his father "You told her that? I'm perfectly fine!"
"I just want to know... If this is targeted to you..."
"Yes, quidditch, sure" He said, realizing there was an uncomfortable silence and three pair of eyes on him. "After breakfast?"
Her hand was warm but limp around his wand and he managed to retrieve it immediately.
"Exactly" Ouch?
Malfoy wasn't there.
"No one is blaming anyone. I think he is trying to understand if what's happening has something to do with our family"
he had a lot to think about. "You will be moving, aren't you?"
"You and Ron should go find out what happened, talk to the victim if you can and Myrtle" Hermione said, almost giving the orders.
"It's not a mistake" She gave him a stern look "Or perhaps it is. You won't know until you have said to him what you have to say. Now go"
"I know. It's one of the many things that are wrong" Draco moved his hand but barely touched Harry's "Sorry about... you know, third year? Scaring you with the whole... Dementor thing"
There was an uncomfortable silence, no one daring to stare at the paper for too long. What if the drawing came to life? What if by staring at it they gave it power over them?
seeker"
Because being cut off from the family meant more than just losing money, it meant losing any chance at a decent job, or a good reputation or... anything.
It was nice seeing his friends, or at least
Harry decided to be the brave Gryffindor he was supposed to be and moved a bit closer, their joined hands resting over one of Draco's legs.
"I'll tell you later. Now follow me, Potter"
. He was an adult. Harry was going to be sick.
Harry felt Draco's hands on the front of his shirt and then a snapping sound followed, as the buttons of his shirt scattered in between them. He almost wanted to protest, even if his whole body reacted very well to it.
" Draco chuckled at his own words while walking down the stairs with him, he was relaxed despite everything that had happened. It made him relax as well.
"Thank you"
There was a soft knock on the door and he turned, Aurors had been given rooms inside the castle to sleep in. Nothing fancy, of course.
"If you get it wrong, then you won't know which one is a lie. I would drink if you had anything on you but I assume you don't have any alcohol?" Silence "Of course not, why would you?"
They dressed without turning their backs to each other this time, almost confusing their ties which amused Draco to no end. The room was cleaned with a simple charm, and they made their way outside through the same backdoor they had used the night before. Draco wanted to hold his hand but doing so outdoors was risky and he wasn't ready yet. He wondered if Harry wanted the same.
“You can't tell anyone...”
"You are bad at this"
"Draco"
"Granger has...
Draco left the bathroom with an uneasy feeling all over his body. It was probably from Myrtle's crying. It had to be that. He convinced himself nothing else was wrong.
The outside hallway was empty, which allowed Draco to relax a bit. What had just happened had been extremely uncomfortable and new to him, and he didn't quite know how to handle it. Truth was he wasn't sure what to do, or how he would handle this with absolutely every person he knew. For a split second he had thought to reject Noah's offering, but he hadn't had anyone to talk about this before. Maybe this was a way to get some answers.
"I guess you are right" Harry smirked, trying to find some comfort in that, because his friend was right, no? It was as simple as going down to the ministry and asking to see him. They wouldn't say no to the hero of the Wizarding world, would they?
The pressure of Draco's tongue against his shaft was more than enough to make him moan, despite his own attempts to be quiet. Underneath his hand he felt the movements of Draco's head, up and down, slow but dedicated.
Noah slumped back against the pillows, his eyes closing for a moment or two. It was no surprise he was tired, especially if he had been given sleeping potions. Draco hated them, they would make you
an explanation, but not one he wanted to give.
Draco sat down as far away from them as posible, Harry decided to close the distance forming a semi circle.
"I know" He closed his eyes, but opened them when Narcissa moved on top of him, sitting on his lap. "I'm not in the mood for..." He started, placing his hands on her waist.
"Do you want to talk about what happened today?"
"How about we ask them to wrap this for us and we go to our next place?"
"No!"
"Not... Not only in bed" Harry kept himself closer to the boy, feeling their bodies touching in every single place.
"oh, I am
"I couldn't get the information from Myrtle today..."
"No, I think I see an empty table" He pointed, and he was right. Right at the back, there was a round table with no one occupying it. And even if it was reserved, Harry was sure he would be able to convince Rosmerta to let them dine there.
"Good"
It was clear the slytherin was trying to make him feel better, to make him smile or laugh. Harry felt wrecked.
Elliot was, of course, laughing. "Nice, Gin"
"Someone had a good night" Ginny smirked, elbowing Hermione who turned pink. Harry wanted to believe his friend's cheeks were red from the cold. Oh, wait, they meant him? He tried not to look too guilty, tried NOT to smile... he almost failed.
"So you didn't believe me, back then?"
"Yeah, we heard people screaming and then he was running out of here. What happened?"
Draco simply shook his head "No, of course not. She's a... friend"
No one had ever cared, no one wanted to know what was going on with him or how he felt. It was true his friends cared, but he didn't have the heart to burden them with all of his shit. And now Draco was there, giving him an opportunity to speak. What to say? Some things were buried so deep within him that bringing them to light... terrified him. What if it broke him?
"Wait, hold it still" Harry said, reaching out and placing his hand over Draco's. The touch was soft again, and warm and Harry liked it and it made him pull away immediately.
Once they were outside, Harry took off his shoes and got up in his bed, closing the curtains and casting two charms. One to keep anyone from opening them and another one so no one could hear what they were saying.
Truth was the future had never been set in stone, nothing was. It was liberating to discover. A lot of things had been liberating after getting marked and living through pure hell. What could be worse than hearing women scream in your living room? What was worse than having blood on your hands?
"What the fuck was that?" Harry asked the moment Draco appeared again. He was angry, not incredibly angry but still. Draco had been acting so strange in there and he didn't like to be cut out of stuff like that. Not after he had been told the only thing that gave him comfort would be taken away.
"We've known Hermione for almost eight years!"
day in that bathroom, the way Malfoy had been sobbing like a child.. And how mad he had felt. He remembered that day perfectly well. It was the first time he thought he killed someone. It had been terrifying.
"Draco?"
"She's not my girlfriend. We are... friends"
The war had left him many terrible things, and he was afraid he would never look at a forest the same way, but something deep within him told him that wouldn't be the case. He would be able to walk under those gigantic trees and wave his worries away. And Draco would be right next to him.
Normally he wouldn't avoid it, he wasn't as ashamed about crying as his Father thought he should be, but right now he didn't want to. He wanted to be strong, to prove to himself he didn't care what Harry thought.
stars" his stone was sarcastic. Harry said nothing, and eventually heard a groan "Pansy only gave me the key today, alright? After our fight, she thought I needed a safe space"
"Sure" His own plate was half full but he wasn't that hungry, not really.
"Hufflepuff? They are too nice to say anything"
Elliot looked at him "So? You like her and I am not asking why"
Draco knew no one was going to be there, not at that time and not with
"He probably wishes me dead"
"How informal, Potter. Have I given you permission to call me by my first name?"
She nodded but didn't elaborate. Draco felt bad for the guy that loved her, it couldn't be good to remain forever in the shadows of another.
and he didn't need any of that.
Draco groaned, feeling something warm creep up from his neck to his ears. He hoped to not be blushing, and kept staring intently at the fireplace.
Potter would know where his loyalties were. He wasn't exactly sure that was a good thing, but it was the only way to do the
. Perhaps he would have liked that, before. Before Harry, and his stupid green eyes, and his messy hair, and his soft moans, and the way he got really cuddly after fooling around.
"Draco, what's wrong?" they had stopped kissing, and something must have reflected on his face because Harry was staring at him, worried.
ABOUT ME"
wanted to scream at people to leave him alone. He was
Draco knew it wouldn't be hard to get lost in the house without any human contact for the rest of the day, but he didn't want that. The one thing he wanted was the thing he would've been dreading years back. He wanted to talk to his mother and explain, to have an honest talk. Like the ones they seemed to be having more and more. It was partly due to selfish reasons: he wanted to know if things could work out with the three of them, or if they would fight and hurt each other incessantly, making their living situation unbearable. But his reasons weren't all about himself. He needed to know if she was alright, if he had hurt her. He wanted to apologize.
The blonde boy moved for a moment and it almost seemed as if he wanted to get up and go sit next to him. He stopped, though.
They entered the Infirmary without a worry, really, since Pomfrey and McGonagall were deep in conversation behind closed doors. It was risky to uncover themselves while they were still in there, but Harry trusted it would take them a while to sort things out.
"Maybe"
Noah raised an eyebrow "Yeah?"
Draco let go of his hand, walking past him and sitting back where he had been, shoulders straight.
He could feel Harry's gaze on him, but he didn't feel the other boy stressed or tense or anything like that. Finally, the last pieces of fabric fell away, and the skull and snake were visible.
"I was in my room trying to finish my potions' essay. I was alone"
How could he explain? Draco closed his eyes, if this was going to end, better be that it ended here and not after they... He slowly unbuttoned his own shirt, pulling it back until his chest was exposed. He didn't remove the white bandage over his left arm, of course.
With a final look at them, Harry left the office to find McGonagall.
Draco's breathing hitched and he closed his eyes, barely relaxing the hand on his shoulder. He didn't seem in pain but there was a frown on his face. Harry kissed his neck, in the places he knew he loved, while his hand moved in between his legs, trying to make him moan again. There was no guide for this, but he felt like he knew what he was doing. Some of his Gryffindor pride, perhaps.
"... I like it when you are honest" For some reason, Draco punched his shoulder. Not too harshly, of course, but it took him by surprise "Hey!"
at them... but deep down he knew they were being extremely careful with Malfoy.
"To make sure my son is fine, Draco. That's what I want"
"As in... like a date"
to live with him and
Harry felt his stomach turn "She won't help you... We will help
want me there"
"We didn't try to murder each other..."
"You can. Say yes..."
Harry groaned, moving one of his fingers and trying to do so with his whole hand.
"You know that's impossible. Just... Be...?"
Harry frowned at that, how ridiculous being wealthy seemed. Tutors for dance? Sometimes Harry could not understand the
“Do you wish to say goodbye? You might d-”
"What do you mean?"
"Elliot? I'm Harry"
They didn't kiss, because they didn't want to draw more attention to each other. Harry knew that he was being a bit of a coward, but they were living with other hundred students that might make their lives miserable if given the chance.
Harry's heart started beating faster "What is it?"
"I have a bad memory!"
"I don't care what you-..." Harry stopped himself, shit. "I'm sorry, Malfoy"
Harry sighed, pulling him slightly closer. "Okay, I'll try tomorrow"
"Yes?"
At the time Draco believed him, but as he walked through the dimly lit room he started to doubt.
"We-we could go to the Tower for a while. Finish our essays there... If-if you want"
"You can see it all year, but it's better during the Summer because then it seems like its eyes are staring right at you"
It was scary how entertaining and well put together it all was. And it was done without magic! The best part wasn't the movie itself, of course, it was cozying up together in the couch they both bought with a blanket and a warm bowl of popcorn.
"Well, try not to murder Malfoy while you are alone" Elliot said in an obnoxious tone, jumping to his feet and walking towards the door "And don't think I didn't notice how you gave me the least amount of work"
Noah shrugged "Something about
"Don't say that"
get away with it"
home... Yeah?"
"Why did you got so mad at me? You were shivering"
She rolled her eyes and told the password to the Lady. The portrait opened showing the door to them. It was good being back at the Tower. Ron didn't like school much -and to be honest a madman had tried to kill him and his best friend for most of his time there- but being at the Castle was slightly better than being back home and missing Fred all the time.
"Oh yes, because I wish to give them any more reason to hex me, Potter. Do you know anything about self preservation?"
not to look at Draco. It would've been amusing if Harry wasn't so anxious.
Harry knew exactly how he felt, but he didn't have a solution. "Me too" He was about to say something when Draco started eating, so he guessed he had said the right thing, or helped in some way. So he decided to do the same and eat. After all, they were there to enjoy themselves, not to focus on what other people thought of them.
vulnerable and could become dangerous to students. We were rebuilding steadily and fixing the wards without any big impediments before the school year started. After that..." She waved her hands around for a moment.
His friends moods improved considerably as the day went on, and once they were at Hogwarts things seemed normal again. It would have been great if Harry had stopped thinking about Draco and how the blonde boy must be feeling after that morning.
"What about it?" He tried not to be on edge, using the monotone voice he would use during dinner parties. It was imperative for a Malfoy to know how to deceive, and manipulate and use truths and half truths to have the upper hand. It was a dance -a game- he knew perfectly well. Falling back into it felt as natural as slipping inside an old pair of boots. His whole being was ready to control the situation to get whatever information or favor he desired.
"You talk about it as if it's alive"
"Uhm, you don't think it's silly to...?"
"Oh, is it?" Draco sat as well, and used only one hand to undo Harry's belt as well as his own. "You were saying...?"
"But you've never liked-... I always thought you were... I-"
him- and it had been amicable. Sometimes he was sure he had hit his head and was actually in a coma in San Mungo, dreaming all of it. It wouldn't be the first time he dreamt about Harry.
"Run!" Draco spoke rushing towards the door, clearly annoyed at the chains that still blocked their way "
There was a small chuckle and Draco elbowed him "Most of the Blacks are named after a constellation or a star, aren't they? My godfather, your aunts... Is Narcissa a constellation?"
"I did none of that" Draco sounded amused "But it does sound terribly specific. Did you ogle boys?"
"Oh so it wasn't just to save your own skin like daddy?"
"She's good" His friend smiled, and shrugged very slightly "She's getting over you"
Why had the war taken so much? Harry's heart broke every time he thought about Teddy growing up like him. Tears came to his eyes and he did his best not to let them fall. He had learned at a young age that crying got him nothing good, and was good at avoiding it. Most of the time, at least.
He had grown more than used to it. His whole childhood and adolescence had been marked by death and chaos, what was one more thing?
Maybe if he hadn't been thinking about Harry, or Charms, he would have avoided what was about to unfold.
Draco chuckled at that, shrugging "I suppose deep down I..." he trailed off and pulled away from him as the office's door opened.
at his age. "Do you, Harry Potter, agree to live in with the prisoner under the supervision of the ministry?"
"Harry, stop" Draco was almost pleading, his lip incredibly bloody and his expression exhausted.
And for some reason, he stopped. Harry stood there, staring into his eyes and fully aware of all the people around them.
Draco was struck by those words as if he had been slapped. Harry regretted them instantly but now it was done and they were both too pissed to sleep in the same bed, anyways.
Of course it was okay, it was more than okay. They were still extremely close -so close Harry could see exactly how pale Draco's eyelashes were- and Draco's back felt... Merlin, was he really thinking about that?
Harry squeezed his hand and tried to focus enough to answer what Draco had just asked.
It sounded like a question, and Harry pressed a kiss to his lips.
"Those are fierce, proud animals!"
and he had lulled himself to sleep more nights than he could count. It was the only thing he knew.
"Look, it's just..." Harry moved away, opening the microwave and pulling the bloated paper bag out. When he opened it, a hot wave of steam poured out and he had to back away a bit "that thing about feeling worthless, you know?"
When Draco saw him stare, he winked. There was something odd about that, and Harry mouthed a simple:
"Yeah, sure. After dinner?"
"You know what I can do. It's more fun to hurt someone when you know their names, don't you think so?"
Harry pulled at his hand, trying to get him a bit closer to his body but Draco didn't seem to move. Damn it, would this fuck things up? Neither of them wanted 'this' to be public knowledge but Hermione wouldn't say anything. Besides, after his talk with Ron he felt much more confident and... Loved. It was a weird feeling, yeah, but it was nice to be accepted - in a way. Even if he knew his... Whatever with Malfoy wouldn't be accepted. At least 'he' was.
Malfoy sighed and slowly sat up, his back against the wall "Christmas. I can't stay here with this... Whatever this is happening. And going home..."
"Elliot, is this some sort of prank?"
Harry chuckled and shook his head, trying not to look as amused as he was.
Something had jumped out the bathroom, a thing that moved like wildfire but had eyes and claws. Draco wasn't sure he had ever seen anything like it in his books or
Herbology wasn't a bad class. Harry liked the smell of the wet dirt and the green color of the leaves and just being outside for a while. If only his mind wasn't so lost in thought...
The auror stopped behind his desk and sat down, something on his face told Harry he was connecting the dots. Nothing changed, not really, but Harry felt very much exposed.
"Imagine living with this for years"
Right, that damned cloak.
"Apology accepted" He muttered, not quite sure if he had truly accepted it or not.
He had planned on asking her about Malfoy and the unspoken-rules of being a pureblood wizard or something, Herm probably read all about it at some point. Now? No way. If he started asking questions about Malfoy of all people his friends would think he had gone mad. And yeah, maybe he had, but he was damn free to go mad now. He was free to do whatever, right?
"I know you want to be out there with them, and you had no reason to stay behind. I know why you did"
"It's alright, really, you had to lie and you are
That was enough. Harry grabbed at his shirt, raising a fisted hand ready to punch him right in his smug face. Malfoy kept his eyes locked in his not even flinching at his violence and that alone made Harry feel... weird. Like a
me..."
Harry knew that was also true, but how could he explain without breaking down?
"You don't want to chat, you want me to tell you what happened. Well I don't want to talk to you. Get out"
He turned around knowing he was being watched and walked away. Sometimes it was easier to walk away.
Suddenly he felt even more angry, angry at the Dursleys, angry at his parents for dying, angry at Voldemort and angry at himself for having been born.
"You are insufferable, Potter"
"Malfoy" Elliot spoke when they reached the Runes classroom, making him stop by touching his arm. Strange, Draco was pretty sure that was the first time Elliot had touched him willingly.
“What about your family? Are you scared about them?” Noah pressed his back to the stone wall, still staring at him.
"Please do not think about my father" He finally looked up, pulling away from the hug "That's for me to handle... And for you to avoid during Christmas dinner"
"I did... I just... I thought maybe..." Draco sighed "I guess deep down I knew the Dark Lord was insane. I just... Wanted you to know"
"Yes, I did" Draco nuzzled his neck, pulling back and laying next to him. His hands searched for the sheets and he quickly covered himself up to his waist. Harry found it endearing, but didn't comment.
"Like how you start shivering with the lightest winter's breeze?" He smiled, holding him close to his side.
"I guess. I think he would kill me if I knew I am telling you this"
“Are you going to tell me that it's better now?”
"I am not going to...
At least nobody knew they kissed. So that was a relief.
"He's really good, mom"
It was a deep kiss, filled with all the things they didn't say, the things they couldn't say. It was a kiss for the two of them, for the rest of the World didn't exist anymore. Nothing existed then, only them.
"Then why didn't you write back? I was worried! I thought..."
The professor frowned at him and said something like the class had already ended, but that he could do whatever he wanted. Draco assumed he was going to be summoned for a chat, which made him... not as mad as he thought he would be. Bell had been the only Auror to be nice to him. And he had saved him in the weirdest of occasions.
"Great honor, yeah, yeah, I know. I'll think about it" He wasn't going to think about it. Or maybe he was, but it didn't need to be a public matter "I'm here to... I wish to visit one of your, uh, prisoners?"
"...Back to bed" he heard Malfoy's tired voice... Soft too. Harry pressed his back against the mattress again, opening his eyes and trying to see him through the shadows. They were close, he was pretty sure of... Oh. Alright. Draco was hugging him. Alright, cool. It was... Normal.
"Hey"
"Malfoy... Draco!"
"Maybe"
He closed his eyes and breathed in once, twice, three times.
case, another hurt, another battle. And you'll never..."
"Draco, I..." Harry moved closer as if possessed, cupping his face between his hands, forcing him to stare into his eyes. Green, so much green... How could something be so green?
"What, like,
"Don't be coy with me, we both know the Ministry will approve. Anything to keep my son away from me"
He smiled and got up "Of course, Astoria. My room?"
Harry wouldn't squirm.
"She didn't
"Granger,
They had been foolish. They shouldn't have done this alone. Harry looked around, trying to find a way to save both of them. Hells, he even wanted to help Bea. She was only a kid.
Harry wasn't completely daft, he knew the amount of strength Draco had to have to be in there again after what had happened.
This was long(er)! Sorry for the delay but hey, I got a 90% on my exam :D !
She shrugged and kissed his cheek before getting up "Just be careful, Harry, alright? You deserve some peace of mind"
"Friends of your family?"
"Harry, uh, well..." Harry didn't know the boy, he was a Gryffindor and was the one who found
"We know someone hurt you"
He knew better than to say 'no', so he simply closed the book and got up, feeling like a zombie. His father started walking towards the backdoor, to the garden, and he followed. He tried to keep himself calm, focus his thoughts but... It was hard. He had too many skeletons in his closet, too many regrets and he had too much to think about. His whole future was a blur.
"You don't have to have a case to be useful, you already are" He was using a calm tone, but one that said
"Hated you? Why do you say that?"
"... Thanks?"
Harry nodded, there was a small frown on his face still and Draco wondered why. They started down the corridor, silently. There was a strange urge to take Harry's hand, bubbling in his chest, but he pushed it down. It was fine that people knew about them, but public displays of affection were... Terrifying. He wasn't there yet. Was Harry ready for that? Ugh, he had so many questions, and he knew he couldn't ask most of them.
No one.
"What did you do" Harry wasn't angry, but he sounded very tired.
Harry knew allowing someone as disgusting as Bell to damage his relationship was not worth it. These kind of situations are what those people crave and Harry knew he was falling for it. But... He needed to know.
"It's not alive!" Draco repeated as if that would explain anything, allowing himself to be in an incredibly dangerous position "Get ready to run"
"Can you stop? You wanted to come here too, otherwise you wouldn't have entered the Room at all. I know you"
"Yeah"
"You are not mad?"
Neither of them had a real choice of coming back or not. Malfoy's trial had decided he had to finish his school before paying for his crimes during the war and some charity work he really couldn't remember or care.
"It's almost as if... You thought the contents of the letter were different, didn't you?"
"What happened...?"
was no longer a creature but black shiny goo again. It would only be a matter of time before the room decided on another punishment.
Lucius almost smiled. "Good" He got up, brushing the grass off his pants "I'll be inside if you need me. Hopefully your mother didn't burn down the kitchen"
The muggle world was a different story. People stared but not as much and there were more lewd comments from passing drunks -only if they went out at night in places they didn't know were safe. Draco had never even thought of going to the muggle world, much less of exploring its wonders. Harry was determined to show him everything London and the world had to offer, and it was... more romantic than he expected.
Suddenly he wanted to leave, to be on his own for a while or with someone that understood...
in Harry.
Harry nodded. "Yeah, Ron asked around"
He wasn't worried, of course he wasn't. But he needed to make the house look
Still, with every step he took he realized Draco might have a point. If no one knew the information, if they were the only two people to know... No. No, that was the slytherin way. Maybe even the Death Eater way. He wasn't like that. He would trust the friends that saved his life more than once. He would.
There was silence on the other side and some rustling "Come in" He said. She remembered the first time they had seen each other: it hadn't been special at all, they had met at Hogwarts. At the time they had been children, smiling or saying 'hi' and nothing more. When their families decided they would be wed, she hadn't been exactly happy. Of course she said nothing. She knew Andromeda was... about to do something reckless. She couldn't abandon her family, she couldn't bring more shame to it. So she agreed. Lucius represented a good future.
"Aha"
He washed his hands with a simple spell, admiring his work. The lines were straight were they had to be and curvy in the right places. The runes were his favorite part and he had taken special care with those. He knew how difficult this magic could be, how it could go south if he didn't follow the instructions.
"Thank you" He responded, touching one of Harry's hands and keeping them together over his shoulder for a brief moment.
"Yeah"
"I read a little bit about the castle and... you know, the old times" He knew better than to say 'when you died' "I... If you wanted to I could try and find your parents. They might still be alive" She got up, floating away from him and starting to sob. Draco imagined that was a horrible thing to remind her of, but he had to try. "If you wanted I could try to give them a message! I'm sure they miss you"
He was still angry, but the idea to turn around and leave alone was horrifying. So he started walking towards the hallway they both knew so well, without saying anything but so close to each other that they hands brushed as they walked.
"What does it say?"
"Really? Why?"
He didn't remember falling asleep, but it clearly had happened during the dawn. Harry moved his face away from the pale and delicate hand -how could it be so soft?- and focused on the blonde boy less than a meter away from him. If anyone had asked him, Harry would have said that he imagined Draco being one of those people that take as much space as possible while sleeping. Why wouldn't he? In Harry's mind, Draco had been raised in a home filled with luxuries, with the idea that anything he wanted was his. Harry, on the other hand, had grown up thinking he had to take as little space as possible.
"You have gone through a traumatic experience, yes, we've been told" Lucius said, almost dismissively, his eyes on both of them. Harry could see his anger, but something more in there as well. He was sure their expressions were similar to the ones they had had during the Battle, while they desperately tried to find their son. For a split second, Harry thought they were going to rush in and hug Draco. They didn't.
Somehow, he managed to sit on the grass, his father kneeling in front of him, hands still on his shoulders.
"What? Why...?"
Sadly for Draco, he didn't cross paths with his mother until later that afternoon. He had no clue where she had been, but something told him she had been in her bedroom with his father.
"I almost feel like I should make a big announcement or something" Ginny mumbled, staring at the door.
them since he was walking backwards. Draco, somehow, didn't seem to struggle at all, while his hands unbuttoned his shirt, exploring the skin immediately and almost causing Harry to trip and fall backwards.
"What?" Draco said, feeling his gaze while they took another hallway, the second floor bathroom closer and closer.
Harry sighed, he really wasn't making this easy. Well, he shouldn't have expected it to be easy.
His father arched an eyebrow "Narcissa told me she wants him to dine with us. I hope you know that's a terrible idea"
Ugh. Draco knew he shouldn't think that way, but every time he tried not to, something cold and dark squeezed at his chest until the air left his lungs. He had overhead some healers calling it anxiety but he hadn't had the strength to ask for more information. And, truth be told, no one really cared for the
"That's how mazes usually work, yes? The Room is not without logic"
"You were hard to find" He was smiling, even though his eyes showed incredible worry.
So, he clenched his teeth and tried to run faster, ignoring the pain on his legs or the left side of his abdomen.
"No! Surely you would rather be trapped with Potter!" Elliot was gritting his teeth, the veins on his neck pulsing. Their bodies gave in just a little, but the adrenaline made them push back with greater force. The thuds did not stop.
"We're obligated to search his room regularly and with no warning" The man almost seemed sorry about it. "The prisoner might hide something. We've had cases"
"I don't know... Just woke up. You got class?"
While gathering strength to get up and go back to his bedroom, he heard steps. One, two, three. They were slow but steady and Draco's heart stopped. His mind raced back to all those sleepless nights, and he pressed his back harder against the back wall, trying not to make a single sound. He knew Voldemort was dead, he knew Nagini was dead, he knew there were no Death Eaters at Hogwarts but still... He felt terrified.
"I know" Draco kept a steady tone, calm and low as if he truly understood what was going on in his head. But he didn't. Who could? "But the danger passed. We are okay, all of us"
Hope you enjoyed! xx
"I... Didn't think about that, sorry"
"Ah" He mumbled to himself, getting up and grabbing a piece of chalk from his bag. It was an odd habit, but he liked to do a small mark on every room he had been in. He had started doing it during first year, after getting completely lost in the castle and now it was almost second nature.
Harry frowned, was that a threat? He looked over at Draco, who was talking to Neville -an odd scene? Perhaps-. Hell.
"Yes"
"I think we can read the rest" He whispered, taking one of the papers with notes and leaning in to share it with Draco.
"I... I know what this is" He whispered, feeling everyone's stares "And it's not good"
Ron placed a hand on his shoulder "Mate, thank you. Now I'm not the only one that forgets birthdays"
It was so dark that even though he closed his eyes, it didn't change anything other than making him feel a bit safer.
mate" Ron sounded so nonchalant about it, it almost made Harry relax. What Ron was saying was basically that he
"His left arm was all... Hurt"
"If you haven't figured it out by now then perhaps we shouldn't tell you. Let you die with the curiosity"  Bell snickered and with a flick of his wand forced Harry to sit on another chair, his arms and legs pressed tightly to it as if iron chains were holding him.
"You know he wants to know, Ron. We can't keep it from him"  She smiled, her thumb was stroking the back of his hand and it made him feel like the king of the whole world. He smiled back.
"Alright" Ron pressed his lips tightly together and then spoke "what was in the room?"
"Are you sure you are ready to handle the rest of the day with...?"
Draco nodded, standing in front of his friends. Their morning had been chaotic, to say the least. They had all met just a little bit before sunrise, knowing everyone would be asleep inside the castle. The plan was simple enough: they would place a tracking spell on Elliot and see what they found. If the attacker had kept anything of him, they would find it. It was easy enough, but no one expected to actually
(See the end of the chapter for
"I just assume"
"Silence, you" He said, without even looking at her.
Ginny shrugged "Elliot? Do you want to start?"
"Thank you"
"I know"
"There was no need for that, Draco" His father spoke very calmly, walking away from the table that looked odd now. Who was going to eat all that food? No one was in the mood anymore. "This came in the mail for you" He dropped an unsealed letter on his lap, giving him a look. Draco didn't know if he was disappointed or angry, because he couldn't look him in the eye "I'll be with your mother, who has done nothing but support you"
"They shouldn't be... used" Harry kept his gaze on the path towards the castle, walking steadily over half melted snow.
He could remember exactly how Lucius had looked during that time. Broken. If he tried hard enough, he could recall the screaming during the nights. And Narcissa's voice trying to calm him.
"When You-know-who was coming to live here... I took precautions. Burned everything that was mine"
"Am I?" He stared back at him. "Am I
"He does a thing" Noah interjected "He... likes to put a chalk mark on the places he has been. His bag is filled with it. It's a bit annoying"
Draco moved a bit, forcing him to follow. They were far from the edge of the lake so if anything bad happened... Oh, Goodness.
"I never thought I would get to have something like this" Draco whispered in the safety of Harry's embrace. "I always thought I would end up in an unhappy marriage right after school"
Draco sighed as if he was staring at an unruly child and Harry wanted to scream.
His heart fell right to his feet again, and something inside his head tried to tell himself that he was so susceptible because of... Everything that had happened with the war and his nightmares and NOT because he couldn't be with Draco that night.
Then why did he feel so alone?
"Don't be nervous" He whispered, but Harry could hear him clearly and it was soothing, in a way. "Look, it's not even that hard. Just move forward and I will follow"
"Do you,
"I'm still not sure if I want my parents having... Access to our home" He could see in Harry's expression he wasn't sure either "And if one of my friends ever does anything that hurts you or offends you, I want you to be able to tell me"
around? or study?"
"Oh" Harry frowned, a bit confused.
Hope you liked the chapter! ;)
Harry had never been more uncomfortable in his life.
"hm?"
"You simply have more experience with dark magic than whoever did this"
Draco smirked and kissed the top of his head, shifting his body just enough to be able to keep him close to his body and be comfortable at the same time.
"Yeah... no" He sat next to her, going silent as a group of third years walked behind them "I spoke with McGonagall. It's... worse than what we thought"
He tried to move away, but Harry stopped him, a hand on his wrist.
"Harry, hey, wait-..."
Draco simply shrugged and Harry was grateful he didn't try and start a fight. Without saying anything else, Draco lay down on the bed looking up at the ceiling.
"Yes"
No, he was mad.
"Hey"
"Any decent family would teach about this. But no, we do not
He chewed on his lower lip, knowing he was going to get no answers that night. At least not the ones he wanted.
Harry felt completely spent by the time Draco was done, and he could feel every single one of his muscles. His body gave up, laying on top of Draco, trying to get his heart and breathing controlled again. They were both sticky with sweat and extremely warm, but it was the greatest feeling of them all, somehow.
"To talk to you" He tried to smile, but he was way too sad. "You are nice"
"Nah, it's fine" Harry nodded, and grabbed both the bowl and Draco's arm, pulling them to the living room again.
Another pause, Harry could see how nervous he was, how insecure. He wanted to reach out, hug him and let him know it was fine. Questioning everything is just a part of life... Harry tried to imagine young Draco trying to go against Lucius' ideals. Even inside his mind it didn't end well.
Harry tried not to laugh, he had gotten that sort of questions from Draco when they did things without magic -which meant all the time. He didn't mind, it was almost endearing and Draco wasn't being
Harry moved closer, letting go of his hand to place his arm around his waist, pulling him in. In any other situation, Draco would've said something and moved away but he didn't. He wanted that hug, he wanted to be close to him again. True, someone could see them. His father, or mother or an auror or someone... and it would make both of them feel awkward, but in that second he didn't care.
Harry had managed to enchant a piece of parchment -two, actually- to show the location of the room he had found. There had been a lot of repairs done to the school after the war, and some of the advantages of that were the empty rooms that weren't exactly finished. Or empty storage rooms that the wizards and witches had used to keep certain equipment. Apparently not everything could be done with magic.
"Yeah, so?"
"Son."
"Alright, my turn before Harry decides to fall in love with me" Harry decided to give Draco a look to reassure him, and the slytherin seemed to relax at that, almost as if saying
close to his chest and Harry's face. So close.
"Of course you do" Harry smiled and put a little pressure on his knee "It doesn't have to be the absolute
"I was just going to walk him back to Slytherin" Harry lied, his gaze defiant. He knew she wasn't trustworthy. "Why can't I? What happened?"
"Yeah well, she had no right"
Hermione nodded "I've been reading about the school as well" He seemed surprised, how could she have known about that? Hermione must have noticed his reaction, because she asked: "What? What do you know?"
"You weren't
Draco didn't know if it was having seen Harry moments ago, the warmth of his hand still on his cheek, or being fed up with his father's attitude but he fisted his hands and turned to him "Would you
"Potter, stop
"Room of Requirement" Draco said before sitting on the bed he assumed was Harry's -he was correct.
"Me too"
"Secrecy and... this is not
"What does that even mean?"
"Sorry..."
"I would also like you not knowing what it is"
Harry used the back of his hands to rub his eyes, mimicking Draco's movements the night before.
It wasn't all they could do and they both knew it. Someone could throw a curse at them while they were distracted, someone might wait until they got out of the manor to attack them. Or maybe something as simple as an insult thrown around for everyone to hear.
"He won't. It's good information for blackmail, Potter"
"Look... I..." Draco closed his eyes, trying to find it in himself to... just say the words. Just say it out loud. "I would if I could. Alright? Just... I can't. Not right now"
Harry smiled "Some things never change, huh?"
Harry didn't want to go back inside. It felt good being under the cold rain. True, it was like having ice instead of bones, but it made him feel calm. Like a balm on all his invisible wounds. Draco didn't push, standing in front of him  and probably freezing.
"What... happened to both of you?" Ron was frowning and looking at them. Was something amiss? Did they...? Could they tell they had been kissing? Oh. No. No, no, no.
"Hey, can we talk?" He whispered, pulling at one of Draco's arms while catching him in a hallway. Harry had waited until Draco left the Great Hall to follow him, because surely that was what the boy wanted. Being seen together in front of everyone was more attention than... any of them wanted. Or maybe not. Harry wasn't really sure of what he wanted.
Neville nodded and went back to his work, so Draco took it as a cue to do the same. He had a lot of studying to do if he was going to do as well as he needed, but once he got his mind into something it was very hard to get in his way. Of course, this lead to some... Overworking, but it was fine.
are keeping me out of the loop"
"Elliot? What's wrong?"
"Calm down, big spoon" His words were a bit drowsy and slow, but there was a smile hidden in the tone
Draco closed his eyes as tightly as he could, feeling his heartbeat quicken and air becoming hard to catch.
Pressing his cheek to one of his hands he started doodling on his notes. He never did something like that. He used to, when they were much younger, but after fourth year that stopped. Draco tried not to think about it too much.
It was bad, it was definitely bad.
are what he wants?"
The skrewt focused on Draco, moving its two front legs up and ready to jump at him. Harry almost couldn't look. But something he had learned was that if someone was going to die for him -
He jumped up the steps, careful not to fall on his face -that would make Malfoy laugh, surely- feeling that sort of nervousness you get when you are about to face something you waited for all day.
"It's like this since he's gone"
The moment he entered his bedroom, he kicked his wardrobe so hard he almost broke one of his toes. Why did it hurt so much? He had always, in his weirdest dreams, stood up to his father. Then why did it hurt so much?
"I'm sorry, Headmistress but I can't leave the school and I can't stop what we started. The students must be protected by us, unless we are given different orders"
Harry placed a hand on his shoulder, trying to calm him down. He wanted to say something, but knew Elliot wouldn't want to hear anything from him.
"No... I'm just better than you in the air"
"Smart"
Ah, him and his damned pride.
"I can
At least that's what Harry told himself.
"I wanted to come sooner, actually" He whispered, and it was true. Why would he lie to a ghost? A dead girl no one really believed or talked to, or cared about anymore.
his bed? This was all so weird.
“Sorry we're late, we got a bit lost. The map wasn't exactly...” Noah said, frowning to the paper they were holding. Harry tried to ignore Draco snickering next to him.
And he did, which only infuriated Draco even more. He wanted to scream, to throw something at him, and he desperately wanted to kiss him.
"Not your parents... Andromeda"
They filled him in, very briefly but the words were enough.
"They are
Harry had never kissed anyone like this, and even though their noses clashed from time to time, it only made them smile. It made him happy, kissing him like that: messy, but perfect. His hands wandered, feeling his strong back -he was more muscular than he remembered- and his hips, and a bit of his flat chest and... It almost made him dizzy. His pants had gone tight against his crotch but he tried not to focus on that. It could definitely ruin the moment.
Why wasn't he getting dry like everyone else...? Oh, right. Shit. Harry didn't want to talk to him or get close to him or do anything involving him at all, but Malfoy's lower lip was turning blue-ish and that couldn't be right. Could bodies do stuff like that? I mean, of course but... He was so pale and now he was turning blue and he was cold and...
"No, I'm fine" Draco's hand moved to his cheek and he touched it for a brief moment, before placing it on his shoulder again.
There was a small pause while Draco had the fork inside his mouth, staring at him "So you eat like someone who just came out of a war" Harry grimaced but nodded "We have to change that, Potter"
Draco knew Harry was waiting for him, it was his free period after all. He had thought about going to meet him at first, but after thinking about it he realized he couldn't. Not without making something right.
"Yeah you do, who is she?"
"Why? Are you-"
"I'm sorry it took me this long, my love"  He knew that voice.
Hermione seemed to be getting to the same conclusion he was, but much faster. She was smart, Christ.
"Harry it's only six"
(See the end of the chapter for
And without looking at them again, he turned and left the room. Once the door closed behind him, his knees almost gave. He had to lean back against the stone wall and close his eyes, every breath was pure fire inside his lungs, trying to eat him alive. Things weren't supposed to be like this. He was supposed to get the upper hand on his Father for once. Now it was all for naught. His parents had seen them, and they had a clear idea of what was going on. The moment he set foot inside his home again, it would be his downfall. Draco knew they would come up with some sort of plan, to make him right again. To
"You better not"
"I care"
"Alright"
"Who? Ah. Yes, I guess" Elliot didn't want to talk about anything involving Malfoy "How are you feeling?"
"Don't-... I know you are trying to make me feel better but don't waste your energy. I know my parents. I know what I will have to endure once I'm back home. It's... Let's not talk about it now... Please?"
His heart sank when he found the door to their own little 'common room' open. The inside wasn't thrashed, but he knew something was amiss. Thankfully there was no one there, the other aurors working around in shifts.
The door opened with a small cracking sound, and Harry stepped in, finding a burnt down room. There was nothing inside of it, not the bookcases they had seen, not a monster, nothing. Everything was burnt, the walls, and floor were dark and in the middle of it there was a drawing. Harry couldn't quite see it properly, but he was sure it was made with chalk and magic, the same one they had been searching in all of their books.
She laughed, moving a strand of her hair away from her face "Oh, darling..."
Everyone nodded, silence falling over them once more. There were certain moments when the severity of a situation settled in with those involved. Harry had realized this during his life. He had faced countless horrors in his young years, things that most of the time didn't feel real, until the moment they did. That moment was shaking everyone in the room, and a wave of guilt washed over Harry. Was this something they should be doing? He could go to McGonagall -even though she had asked him not to get involved- or he could write to Kingsley even. But...
"Good" She placed a hand on his shoulder "That's good"
She smiled, tiredly and shook his head, placing another pile of papers in front of her "They will always try to take over the school, Harry. Now go, I'm sure you have better things to do... like studying for your N.E.W.T.s"
Harry laughed loudly at that, trying to imagine Draco -and all the Malfoys- completely dying of heat but trying to keep their straight faces.
"Draco!"
He turned to see Draco, standing next to the fireplace in the middle of the room. There was silence for a brief moment, before they found their way to each other. Harry placed his hands on his hips, kissing him passionately. He could feel Draco pulling at his hair while they kissed, and it only made him want to kiss him harder.
"They thought it would be better for you to stay here..."
Draco smirked, alright maybe it hadn't been lucky to find him in there. "It's alright, something came up and I didn't show up anyway"
Malfoy stopped when they reached the huge statue and turned around, moving a hand in the air trying to get a grasp of his cloak. No one was there, so Harry decided to reveal himself, carefully tucking the cloak inside his pocket.
The kissing became less frantic the moment they touched the bed. It became slow, careful, both of them knowing there was no reason to hurry. They had taken their shirts off already, but there was too much clothes on them still. Harry had never felt so excited and nervous about something before, he wanted this to be perfect, memorable, something they would look back on years from now.
"We talked"
"Yeah, I should've known you would fall. I forgot you have two left feet"
The Headmistress gave him a look that would chill anyone's bones but didn't comment on that. Harry knew Slughorn hadn't always been the most observant with the things he kept but this seemed a bit too much.
And Harry did. Of course he did.
It took them two seconds of silence before they started laughing, loudly. Harry was clutching at his sides by the time Draco moved close to offer him his hand.
Draco sat at the edge of the bed, his back to him and his shoulders extremely tense. In that moment Harry knew that if he was too harsh, he could lose what they had. Whatever it was.
ghost that lived there. He didn't mind. Not at all. His mind was somewhere else, somewhere dark and there was no way to come back from it.
Harry huffed but eventually nodded, he
"I am not..." Harry frowned but stopped, looking away while Draco took off his vest and shoes. "Maybe a little bit"
"I'm just tired, Harry" Draco moved to his other side to face him "Today was... well, the morning was nice"
Harry swallowed, standing just behind Slughorn.
"You don't know him" Harry frowned, gripping his cup of tea a bit harder. True, Draco got scared easily, but he was much more complicated than that. And he was living his parents, the only two people in the world that could manipulate him easily. Not only that, but aurors controlled what letters came in and out of the house, so what if they were throwing his letters out? It was against the law and it probably wasn't happening but Harry worried all the same. "There's a lot going on"
The auror frowned, and quietly handled him the form. He wasn't pleased... and Harry suspected no one would be pleased when the papers ran with the story of their relationship.
"Why can't we tell my friends about this?"
Harry couldn't understand how he was so composed. They had almost died. Again.
Draco stared at him, his expression unreadable as he stood behind the auror.
Right after the war he had gone to therapy. Well, Molly Weasley had looked him straight in the eye and said
"I am not interested, Potter"
There was a brief smile on her face, that didn't quite reach her eyes and she nodded. There was almost no doubt in Draco's mind that he wouldn't be seeing her again. At least not like the friends they were, or could have been. Perhaps they would pass by Diagon Alley and she would nod courtly, a hand on her pure blood husband and a stern expression. A good pure blood witch wouldn't associate herself with someone like him.
"You didn't stole your wand back. Who hexed you?"
Harry knew that was true, but Molly Weasley had a lot to deal with and he didn't want to be a burden. Or perhaps he didn't want to be in the presence of a woman who had lost a son. Perhaps he was that selfish.
"I like it too. Did you come here often? It's a bit dangerous isn't it?"
"So you decided to just wait and see how long it took? Draco-"
"Yeah, really. Am I wrong?" Silence "So, wanna go to the Tower with me? I brought the cloak and the guys aren't going to say anything, promise"
"Maybe I could answer some of your questions..."
"Let's go? You can do your homework at the Tower, it's not so horrible in there you know?"
"I'm not so sure about that anymore" She admitted, and he gave her a sideways look, pretending like he didn't care.
to play this right? You never died, Potter. People don't come back. That one's the lie."
"Yes, I noticed that too. But it's not... We could still deny it, if you want"
"I have been looking all over for you" Harry gave a step forward but stopped himself, clearly aware of what he was doing and where "Are you avoiding me?"
Auror Bell was right there, he was a young man with an ugly scar on his neck. He had no idea how he had gotten that but... Being an Auror is probably all about scars, is it not? Draco realized he didn't want Harry to be exposed to so much danger. Not now that they had something good.
"I've been thinking..."
Why? Why understand
"I think I'm sleeping here tonight"
"Give them a chance? You said it yourself, she's the one with the plan"
"Sorry"
"You seem well, better than the last time we saw you"
"What we want and what we
Malfoy didn't look scared, was he listening to her?
He didn't have to explain, because Draco understood all too well what he meant. "Yeah, I know"
"Letters, Potter. The ones you send with that owl of yours"
"For a moment there I thought you were going to..."
"We can play again, if you want" Draco mumbled, still in the same position he had found him.
There was a long pause after that, and Draco wasn't sure how he managed to maintain eye contact without cowering in fear. His father had only hit him once, but he had never really needed to. He always knew what to say to undo him.
"Don't play dumb" He tried not to despair, but it was hard "What was all of that? One moment I'm there about to die-"
When everyone started to disperse, Malfoy moved. It was... interesting to see him in his habitat. He looked composed and calm, but his eyes were bright with a fire he hadn't seen before. What was it about this place? Was it the mind games they surely played on each other?
"Okay"
His tone was firm but also... Irreverent. Thank Merlin he was being strong. Harry tried to ignore the beating of his heart or the fact that they were about to confess something so intimate in a terrible situation. He wasn't going to allow Bell to steal that from them. They would have their declaration of love or... Whatever they wanted to declare, it wouldn't be on his terms.
. Harry loved him for that "Mate, the other day in the dorms you went... Crazy"
Harry stood there watching him walk away.
"Draco" She sounded alarmed, quickly moving to his side. "Draco... Your father... You'd be burnt from your family tree... And..."
"Thanks, but... no. I'd rather... I just... not right now"
Harry could swear he heard a small chuckle from Draco.
Harry moved, slowly and with difficulty given the small space, and closed the door behind him.
Sometimes. But he also knew his mind wasn't in the right place when he felt that. There had to be a way to get out of it, there... had to be.
the complicated one"
Draco pulled at his shirt, clearly stressed that they were still in the hallway and could be found. And he was right. Harry nodded to let him know he had realized this.
Draco blinked and felt a bit at a loss for a few moments. He knew Harry's birthday date -due to a huge obsession on him, once upon a time- but he had never seen him on that day, or given him anything for it.
When he reached his corridor he tried not to look in a hurry, or worried. But he was.
"What does it matter?" Malfoy stopped suddenly, turning around to face him. Harry had to give a step back. "They are calling in the aurors, Potter. It's pointless."
That thought alone should have been enough to take a weight of his shoulders, but it didn't. There was still a pale, barely alive boy on the floor and he had no idea who was doing this or why. Why now? Why them?
He smirked, picking up his Auror robe. "I'll be there in a minute"
"It's whatever I say"
He laid down on his side, and Harry did the same, staring into each other's eyes. "We've been having sex, haven't we?"
Harry swallowed "Yeah?" he didn't know what he was talking about. Did he mean how much the day had sucked? Or did he mean the whole argument?
Growing up the idea of being Marked just like Father was seemed an honor, something to make his ancestors proud. It had been received in a blaze of agony and fear. No glory there, and no pride in his Father's eyes either. After that, everything had gone downhill.
Sheppard was clearly the leader of the group. Harry didn't know if that was a good or a bad thing, but he was glad it wasn't that woman.
was hurting, and it was all because of him.
True, he was someone who valued his personal space, got moody more often than not and was prone to isolate himself from everyone. Despite that, he still wanted Harry close by.
Draco nodded and pulled it open, finding some rags. "Thanks"
"Can I...?" he whispered, barely slipping his fingertips under the waistband of his underwear.
"Are you enjoying the evening, Potter?"
difficult for you"
Harry arrived?
Those days had been filled with uncertainty and dread. His mind went from "what if's" to regret, day and night. And then the trials had happened, and Harry Potter had testified for him and his mother. They only stared at each other during the trial, Draco didn't know what to say.
"Oh come on, Malfoy, you can't be that uptight"
He looked down, where Draco's hand was holding his fist. Harry closed his eyes and relaxed his hand, breathing slowly and telling himself nothing was wrong and if he allowed the panic to escalate he would end up a mess again.
"I shouldn't be spending so much time at the Tower with you" Harry felt his chest tighten "but if you need me tonight..."
"Ah. So you will?" Draco was about to let go of him hand when Harry pulled at it a bit.
"Yes, you can. You will be fine"
Draco opened up his potions' notebook and moved it towards the other boy "Do you have the notes I asked for?"
"What? What look?"
They quickly repeated everything, her face slowly changing into an expression of concern.
Staring and screaming as she did when he hurt Draco.
"Yeah"
By the way, I know sometimes people don't like it when you add 'original characters', but I kinda had to for the plot! I hope you like them!
The bookcases started to melt into one another, creating something new. The wood turned into a dark liquid -more like a goo really- that started to twitch and move rapidly all over itself. Harry wanted not to look, the grip on his wand extremely tight. Neither of them said anything, their backs to the door and their eyes fixated on... The thing.
Narcissa turned to the door, displeased but conceding.
"Spoken like a true Gryffindor"
"I know"
"I don't need your pity" She looked away, blushing. Was she angry?
Draco smiled and yeah, it was nice.
Fucking great.
"Well, yes" Draco was teasing him again. Harry felt incredibly giddy and relaxed. They could talk about everything later.
Lucius stood up as well, and Draco felt a cold sensation run through his back. He didn't want to fear him, but he did. Maybe he always would.
"The lie is..." Harry looked away from him, wishing reality were different than it was "you are not afraid of the dark, otherwise you wouldn't be sitting over there"
"I figured"
"Of course not. I'm not that petty" Draco wondered if that was true, if he truly wasn't as petty as he had always been. He wanted to be a better man for him.
Noah smiled "I'm not one hundred percent sure, but I have always wanted to write. Uhm, professionally"
count- and even though he wasn't going to just get naked to get changed, he appreciated Draco giving him some room.
"I'm not being weird,
It's not like Harry had been
Harry stared how Slughorn gave Malfoy his wand at the beginning of class and how the blonde walked to his desk quickly, making eye contact with him very briefly. Some people still snickered and whispered every time Malfoy had to go and get his wand from the teachers, and Harry was half sure most of them had no idea of the damage they were doing.
Draco felt his own breathing stop, the pounding of his heart inside his chest.
"It wa-"
"And you think I do? But it's our child, Lucius"
Draco chuckled and looked at him "It's like the head and the body, like... I don't know. Mom always told me how to find it"
"I never wanted to be a... A disappointment" Draco whispered, voice breaking.
Malfoy swallowed and shook his head slightly "... I-... It truly is hard to explain, alright?"
"Malfoy" Damn it. "Truth or Dare?"
Harry was finding it hard to think clearly, he had tried so hard to deny and hide those feelings and now everything was flowing out of himself and it was... it was confusing. And it hurt. And he didn't want it.
"That's enough, Elliot"
"I will be talking to the Headmistress about this"
"Stop talking so much and kiss me" Draco whispered, moving closer and brushing his lips to Harry's.
"So that's why you were so over it"
"What. Happened."
"And you wondered why you took so long doing all the things you did" He said, but only looking at Harry. It almost felt like Draco would only talk directly to him.
"I'm sure it's a good idea, tell me"
It was difficult, speaking of these things. It was no secret Harry hated his father, and with good reason. Hearing him say things like that, supportive things, made him love Harry even more. Any other guy would have wanted for him to cut ties completely with his family. Harry was way too good to ask something like that of him.
Draco looked away from him, but he didn't look sad, he looked furious. Almost as if he were trying to restrain himself from cursing the man.
"Harry, it's better if you don't..."
From the outside, it was almost as if nothing had happened. The Castle illuminated the damp cold grass and the night sky watched over all of them. Nothing seemed amiss.  Harry remembered the eerie silence that fell over Hogwarts during that hour or so of peace they had, that hour to mourn and gather their dead while Harry prepared to face the Dark Lord in the flesh. Saying it out loud seemed as if it had happened to someone else. As if he was just telling a story. And so, he didn't spoke of it.
Draco woke up tangled in his sheets, trying to kick at something that only lived inside his nightmares. It was getting old, waking up like this. Unmoving, he tried to see through the shadows, piecing together the room he knew so well, trying to remind himself there wasn't anything in the dark.
"I'm fine. We're fine"
The weekend arrived sooner than anyone expected, it was almost as if in the rush of the exams the week had flown by and they had all lost a few good days of sleep. Hermione was extremely calm, more than he had ever seen her in years during those periods. He felt the same. How could he be stressed about something as mundane as a grade on a piece of paper? He had seen people die. If everyone was alive by the end of the week, it was a victory.
"Let's assume it has been used" Malfoy whispered, looking deep in thought "What then?"
Harry frowned "All of us?"
"It might change what you think of me. I... I don't even know what you think about this."
"Your son broke the rules of the school, placing himself in danger. We did everything we could to keep everyone safe, Mr. Malfoy. And I
"Longbottom, I-... Wanted to talk to you"
"Well, Noah found us and told us that-"
Harry found Elliot sitting outside the Infirmary, alone. It was strange to find him on his own, but Harry assumed Noah was inside the infirmary, talking to Beatrice.
He gave her a look as if he had been slapped "No, I could not"
"Try me"
"Ouch" Draco whimpered, feeling the pressure on his shoulders. They had woken up half an hour ago, tangled in each other. Even if they wanted to continue sleeping and forget about the world, they knew they had to face what had happened the night before.
"We all find a way to pass the time. You'll find yours" Draco wanted to say that he was reading and it was enough, but he knew he couldn't fool anyone with that. "Another letter came for you"
"Yes" Draco took the glasses off his hands and kept them away from him.
"You still haven't told me what happened between you two exactly"
Still, he didn't see Draco anywhere during the whole morning. It had been a bit strange not seeing him in one of the few classes they had together, but many things could have happened. He recalled a day when Draco had fallen asleep over his homework in the library and completely missed two classes.
Enjoy!
"Of course I did" She got up, all pride and elegance. Oh, if he could love her, how easy his life would be. "I'll see you later, Draco" She walked to the door and stopped for a brief moment "If you are truly going against your dad... I wish you luck"
"Don't you ever say such nonsense. Your father was... He loves you so much, Draco" She sighed "Do you think I would still be with him if he didn't?"
Malfoy snorted "Do you even
He saw Draco nod, his crossed arms tightening more, his body a bit tense "Do you wish to hear my opinion about it?"
"I-... Me too"
"Sorry"  Harry looked around and smiled when he found Ron "I was... uh, busy"
Yeah, it probably wasn't. How do you deal with being friends with someone after a terrible war? He had friends but they had all stood on the same side always and their families weren't completely insane.
Enjoy!
"Yes, yes, you go"
"I take it you solved your problems?"
and I've been horrible to you"
"We'll just go, grab something to eat and that's it. Friends eat together sometimes, you know. Maybe it's a new concept for you but..."
"Sorry, I-..."
"What? Potter, I can't be late for Potions... And shouldn't you be coming with me anyways? Come on, let's walk"
"He didn't say anything to you about this?"
"Sorry"  Harry whispered, having hit his knee against Draco's. It hurt a bit, but Draco giggled, making him laugh as well.
He didn't want to feel scared again, he didn't want to hold his breath expecting people to say nasty things at him. What if they try to hex him? He didn't have his wand outside of class, he wouldn't be able to defend himself!
He had asked Harry to throw out the old Black's family tree, unable to stare at it for too long. His father had sent a few letters and at first he had ignored them, thinking he would grow tired. When he didn't stop, he decided to read them and reply. They weren't as horrible as he thought they would be, which gave him hope. He knew he was being foolish, holding onto that hope, but what else could he do?
Ginny smiled "Hmm, I don't really know you so... What are you going to do once you get out of here?"
Why was he being so difficult? Was he uncomfortable about the kiss?
Hi! This one took longer to write than I expected! Sorry about that, I had one of the big career exams and had to focus on that for a bit. Also, the next chapter has been on my mind since I started this FF so I'm excited to finally write it down.
"Did something happen?"
What if the love his parents had for him wasn't enough? Having a gay son was not in their plans, he knew that, but... perhaps...
"Are you alright?" His friend turned slightly on the wooden bench, trying to look into his eyes. Elliot could see how worried he was.
Noah had made a full recovery in the weeks that followed the accident, but he was unable to remember anything else. Apparently the obliviate had partially worked, only causing him a strong headache if he tried to remember any details leading to his and Bea's attack. It wasn't helpful, but Harry was pleased the boy was alright and walking around again.
Draco? Shit, they were not going to like it, huh?
Dinner was brief but civilized. Draco was tempted to ask who cooked, but preferred not to. The food wasn't bad, but it didn't feel like the one the house elves produced back at the Manor.
"I-... Nothing, sorry"
"Harry Potter, I must say I didn't think much of you when we met" That was new, and refreshing and Harry hated how much he liked her for that. Way too many people suck up to him now and... Even though sometimes he enjoyed the attention, most of the time it made him feel overwhelmed and guilty for surviving. "But you have good instincts... You would make an excellent auror" She frowned "Bell had all of us tricked, he-... Was a friend" Harry remembered the betrayal on Lupin and Sirius when-...
"Yes, and you were brilliant"
Draco nodded, closing his eyes to calm himself. Why was he the one that had to give his parents time to accept this? Or to be the understanding one? Couldn't his parents do the same for him?
Draco frowned and shook his head "It's okay. I am not
But he didn't die.
Narcissa had stayed in the kitchen the whole time Harry had been in the house, and Draco wondered how much she had heard of their talk. So when he saw her, he felt a bit uncomfortable, exposed. Should he thank her? Talk to her about it? For a few seconds, he simply stood in the middle of the kitchen, not quite sure as to how normal boys talk to their mothers.
Noah nodded, thoughtful. “Coming out is never easy, but it wasn't so bad, right? I mean... I'm totally fine with it, Elliot doesn't care and Ginny seemed cool”
That's something he loved about Noah. People usually thought Elliot was dumb, but not Noah. He always listened.
"You are really dramatic, you know?"
Ron smiled at him and nodded "Sure, we... "
"Professor, may I?" the auror spoke, and Harry realized he had almost forgotten about her presence.
"They wouldn't be caught dead sleeping in a place that isn't a manor" They laughed and Draco then shrugged "I don't know, maybe they would like to stay sometimes. I... They are good people, my friends. I know I... It's just complicated to explain."
like?"
"But you marrying a woman would be natural"
"I'm the one that's worried?"
"It probably is"
"Yes" Draco's hand pulled his hair back, while they stared into each other's eyes. "Think you can open my trousers this time?"
Noah shrugged, unconvinced "we were going to investigate anyway, why not accept their help?"
"Noah... Nothing is going to happen to you"
"Yes he did" His voice was low and almost broken. Harry had a flash of sixteen year old Draco, crying in a bathroom without knowing he would be bleeding out a few moments later... "And he is right"
"It's late, we should wrap this up" Hermione was right, of course, but they were losing time already and no book seemed to hold the answers they needed.
"Yes. Potter, Malfoy, I have been told you already know Jane" ugh, where they friends? "She was instrumental in... Well, saving you two"
"Ah" A brief pause, more dirt placed around the little green plant "Well Herm says we should check the wand. If he keeps avoiding you we could just try and steal it..."
"Alright, Potter. Try keeping balance with your feet"
Draco seemed relaxed, holding his drink in one hand. Should he be worried? Was this what normal teenagers did? Was he a normal teenager?
Elliot shook his head "He likes Bea, that's all. Can you just... Find whoever did this? He's my friend and... It could have been him. What If he crossed paths with the attacker? Please, just... End this?"
Harry blinked completely shocked. Was he reading his mind or something? Of course he could deny everything, but it was pointless with Draco.
Hope you enjoyed! Please leave a comment if you can x)
"Draco? Are you here?" He whispered, fear creeping through his body. What if he wasn't there? If he was unable to find him? What if he was already...?
"Ah, yes. Uh..." Harry broke the small wax seal and started to read. Andromeda's handwriting was exquisite, it reminded him of Draco's. He had started to believe it was a pure blood thing, normal people didn't have such nice handwriting. "She... Figured some stuff out"
The mattress dipped again, Malfoy laying down face up this time. "That's a lie, but thank you"
there, but Harry seemed anxious. He didn't know how to bring it up, but he suspected it had a lot to do with his upbringing.
"Sure, I'll ask him"
It was humiliating, of course, and Draco wondered if Harry remembered how he had looked in there. Harry hadn't said a word about it. Maybe it was better this way.
The nightmares had gotten worse after sending the formal request to the Ministry. He knew it was from stress, but it wasn't like he knew how to stop it. If he did, things would be much easier.
"She is the only witness and she's not speaking to anyone. Maybe if you... If
... Draco kept giving soft, quiet kisses, his fingers touching all of him, slowly as if he wanted to torture him.
"Him? No. He wasn't. I don't think he even wanted to" Draco crossed his arms "Do you think that's why? Because they both weren't death eaters and they knew my family? Do you think someone wants to make me look bad?"
“Andromeda wrote back... We've got some details about this. Apparently it needs to happen near a great source of power”
Draco seemed about to throw up "Let him go" He begged, his voice strained as if someone were choking him "Just let him go, I'll do it. I'll do whatever you want"
There was a long silence after that, but they didn't move away from the other. Harry could see lighting far beyond Draco's head, this would be a big storm. He tried to picture the sound of the raindrops against the Tower's windows, how calming it would be. It didn't calm him now.
pretending to be okay"
"No, I-... I don't even know his name"
"You know we don't mind, right?" Noah was arching an eyebrow at them. "And if... If you have any questions about coming out and stuff, I think I might be of help"
"Hm" Noah wasn't paying attention.
"But the aurors... I think someone wishes you gone, professor"
He moved closer to the other boy, spooning him when Draco turned his back to him. "Hi there" Harry whispered, hearing a small chuckle. "Thank you for... Letting me be the one who... You know"
Harry truly wanted to say everything would be alright but he wasn't sure. At the beginning of the year he had read that book about pure blood families and he had found out how strict they were. He had seen the things for which they would disown someone. And he could only imagine that loving someone of your same gender would be enough to get you burnt from the family tree.
What? He had said something wrong and Draco wouldn't say what it was and he didn't know and... Harry looked down, but Draco didn't look up so he couldn't see his face. At least not completely. Was this about all the hugging? Did Draco not want to be friends? He wanted to. Very much so. They had many reasons not to be, and maybe Draco was being smart and realizing they would combust into flames before getting to be good friends. Maybe their differences were too grand. Harry closed his eyes, thinking maybe he should give up too.
"Nothing" Draco pinched a grape between his fingers and brought it to his lips. He saw Harry's eyes follow his movements.
"Sorry, this one's taken"
Hermione shrugged "I guess so" There was a brief pause, and Harry felt completely hopeless. He didn't want Draco to lose his family or... whatever he needed from them. Hermione placed her head on his shoulder "That's the one thing that makes me think he cares about you"
was all of those three combined.
"Just help me with this plant alright?"
Anything could've happened and Harry almost expected Draco to snap at him and scream or just say something venomous. There was silence instead.
to keep Harry interested for a whole year of long distance relationship, but he didn't know if he was
"Woah!" He had to grab one of Draco's arms for dear life because his feet were sliding and he had no clue how to keep balance in this sort of situation. He remembered how his aunt and uncle had taken Dudley ice skating a couple times, but had left him at home locked in his cupboard.
Harry smiled, he really liked to hear all those things. He wasn't sure if Draco realized how sweet all of that was. His mother -at least- seemed to love him dearly.
“They don't know... It's... complicated”
By the time he reached the second floor bathroom his feet were hurting. Draco had intended to reach the Dungeons and eventually his common room, but he didn't make it that far. The weight on his chest became so unbearable he had to stop and find a safe place to stay. That bathroom was the first thing that came to mind.
"I just... I haven't answered"
"Noah, nothing is going to happen to her. It's only a couple questions, promise"
Draco smirked and said nothing for a couple seconds "Oh am I?"
"Is that a compliment?"
"Me too" It was a whisper so low he barely heard it.
"In... In a way. Is Adam the only other boy that... That you knew that is...? I mean, the only boy that you knew was involved with another boy?" Harry felt ashamed at how hard it was for him to ask a simple question, but being honest he felt insecure about all of this. He still didn't know the wizarding world, not completely. What if it was forbidden? No... Surely he would know such a thing, right?
"Mate" Ron almost laughed and then opened their room's window. They weren't going to leave out the front door anyway.
"Oh, shut up"  Draco smirked, looking away with something that looked like a... blush? Harry tried not to look too much, but he was bad at hiding stuff like that.
"About what history?"
"You know I don't like working with Elliot, right?"
"You can't possibly believe they are guilty of this" Elliot frowned, but not exactly furious.
"It's the truth, isn't it? You think you are so smart and closed up and mysterious, well you are not. I see how you look at him"
Bell sighed and kneeled behind one couch, pulling at one of the loose floorboards where he had stashed some of the most delicate elements he needed.
"I don't want to be your enemy" Harry said.
There was a part of himself, one that he would never be able to ignore, that ached for it. A part that ached for the
"I hope you are right... Her parents are taking her off the school anyways. They are nice people, and... I guess they want to take care of their daughter" Elliot seemed conflicted for a moment, and was about to say something when the door opened and an exhausted Noah appeared. His eyes were slightly red, as if he had been crying.
"I don't know what you are talking about"
Harry arched his eyebrows and no one seemed to move.
Yeah, why? Because it was Malfoy? Because he shouldn't trust him? Or for the complete opposite? Because they kissed?
“Why else? Power is power. Oh, how sweet, you think this is the first time I've done this?” He laughed, shaking his head “I wouldn't attempt something so big without practicing first” He shrugged “I could have done this smoothly, but you had to intervene”
Hope you enjoyed!
Hermione looked annoyed at him "We studied that, Harry. Transfigurations? How are you planning on passing this year's exams?" Silence. She gave him a disapproving look "Nothing can create food or a living thing. You can transfigurate a living thing into something else but not the other way around. It's one of the laws of transfiguration"
Harry felt a bit overwhelmed at his own thoughts. This had
Draco shook his head. Harry tried not to get mad at how
"I'm happy for you... I never asked: is he...?"
"No, it wasn't" Harry got up from the bed as well, his feet touching the cold floor. It felt almost as cold as the air hitting his damp cheeks. "You hurt people, you think less of others, you were horrible, you never cared! You only switched sides to help yourself!"
Draco could feel it before he saw it, loud thumps making the floor tremble beneath their feet.
"Yeah" Harry whispered, and forced himself to pull his hand away from the other boy's. "Yeah, okay"
Malfoy sighed, covering his eyes with one arm "Why does it matter?"
Would only one of them get out?
Harry tried not to think too much about his former potions' teacher, it was a delicate subject and he had not told everything to his friends yet. He had told them to stop speaking ill of him, but nothing else. Hermione had given him a look that said "it's the trauma talking" when he 'defended' Snape's memory. And maybe she was right, but what was and wasn't a product of trauma in his life?
Falling asleep while spooning was harder than he thought and it took him a while - even after Harry fell asleep again- to stop feeling like butterflies had run over his body. So in that time he thought about the next morning and what they could do. Having a proper date was out of the question because that would mean ask him out and
"You know, we can go back to the castle, you don't have to be freezing out here"
"Good night, Harry" He gave him a small peck on the lips before getting up. Harry watched him as he went, feeling a strong urge to run after him. He didn't.
"Morning" Draco found his voice too strained, so he tried to clear his throat, trying to find some of the strength he had had the day before.
"I'm not actually going to make you have dinner with them, Harry, relax. You look terrified" He said, smiling "I... My family is not an easy subject, you know this. Let me handle it and... We'll see what happens"
Harry tightened his jaw and didn't say a word, giving her space to speak. It was clear she knew more than she was saying. Was she in on it? It was hard to imagine someone so petite harming a student like Elliot.
"Shit, just... don't..." How did Draco knew about that? And why did he have to bring it up? And why was he
"Alright, so" Harry frowned, trying to focus on the task at hand "The Room did some crazy things, almost tried to kill us" He was almost disappointed when Draco didn't fight that notion. Malfoy had been so strongly opposed to the idea of the Room trying to kill them, that he wondered if something had changed his mind or if he was just defeated in the presence of a majority of people that, probably, didn't like him.
family he had ever known. Sometimes he hated them. Sometimes he didn't know what he felt.
"Me neither, Potter"
They both knew something was wrong the moment they made it to the seventh floor. Not only it felt strange but the Room of Requirement's door was... right there. They didn't need to walk in front of it three times or wish for anything, the door was right
"I assure you, Minerva" Slughorn was speaking quickly, moving his hands "The wand was in my possession the whole time. It was impossible for Malfoy to grab it without me knowing it"
"What?"
"You are going to get sick" Draco whispered, sitting next to him. The boy-who-lived, Hero of the People, Golden Boy, and all of that was a little ball on the floor, his glasses falling from his nose. They weren't friends, but if they had been Draco would have laughed and maybe run a hand through his perfect mess of hair.
"When did you-?"
"I need to be going" Harry rose from his place, taking a long look at Draco and deciding it was best not to... come back the next night.
"You always broke the rules and suddenly being scolded by McGonagall turned you into a well behaving citizen?"
Suddenly, Harry moved his hand faster, more determined, making Draco's brain completely shut down. He kissed him as well as he could, feeling as if his body were chasing stars, the brightest and warmest of them all. Without thinking, but feeling, he pressed a bit tighter around Harry's erection, hearing him moan and slightly move his hips towards his hand. Fuck.
"What do you think she wants from us?"
He saw Ron and Hermione still in the Common Room, Neville was with them. Studying? Harry felt disconnected, and knew he was isolating himself but he just couldn't handle them at the moment. Elliot was on the other side of the castle, inside his bedroom. Sleeping? Harry looked over at Malfoy and wondered why they hated each other so badly. Why would someone think that by attacking Elliot they would implicate Malfoy?
"Me too" The Slytherin finally said, his words calculated. Hermione could see he wasn't giving any information. He was secretive, closed off, cold. Was this what Harry wanted? She thought about Ginny and how different they were - in more ways than one.
"Oh, and what? The opportunity just
"Gin, I didn't..."
"You are surprising me"
Harry placed his books and quill next to Draco's organized pile. It was incredible how neat he was, everything had a perfect order, a place. It was a bit nerve wracking, really. Harry knew he was organized as well, living with the Dursley's had given him a weird discipline, he hated it sometimes.
She shook her head "That's not what I remember... You sat next to me, made me look at you. You were so happy-"
" Harry smirked when Draco tried to push him off the couch "Just tell me why, Draco. I won't think it's stupid"
The aurors could deny his application and force him to finish his sentence in France with his parents and no one could do anything to change it. If that happened, they would have to find a way to maintain a "long distance" relationship. Not only that, but living with his parents also meant there were bigger chances of Harry crossing paths with Lucius and Draco didn't want to see that happen. Not in a million years.
Harry sat up when he heard voices coming into the room, and quickly reached for his wand to secure the curtains...
Draco threw a couple glances to his fisted hands, and crossed his arms again. Damn. He tried to relax his hands, he would never hurt him. Draco had to know that, right?
"You are fine here"
"Yes?"
" He looked at Draco.
"What's burning?" Draco turned his head towards the kitchen, barely moving from the couch. He heard a small crash and a curse.
Draco shrugged "Pointless"
"You?"
The Slytherin shook his head "I didn't expect to be captured or anything like that to happen, believe me" His hands trembled, and even though Harry was pissed he reached and held them between his own "That room was the last place I wanted to be"
Draco stared at her, grey eyes questioning her wording. She had a theory, or maybe more than one, about what was going on between him and Harry. And she also knew she couldn't just talk about it outright.
Harry read the letter again. And again. He could see the places where Draco had pressed the ink harder, or the places where his perfect traces looked insecure. He had shared so much in a small letter... Even the things he didn't say were revealing.
"Oh I just
"We got a letter from Hogwarts" She announced while he walked back to his chair, arching and eyebrow.
There was a small pause in every moment from Draco's body, his eyes focused on his face as if trying to see if he was lying or mocking him. Harry frowned, why couldn't they be friends? Never in his wildest dreams they had come to this, but it was for the better. Being enemies and rivals almost cost them everything, hell, he almost killed Draco once. And Malfoy would've probably hurt him too.
"What do you want? Just let him go"
Harry turned to leave, but felt something tug at his arm.
"No, that's you"
"I can't, Harry. Remember?" Draco pointed around himself "If the Ministry finds out..."
Ron crossed his arms "You can tell her whatever you want, we've got people who will say we were in our bedrooms all night. And right now you are the one on a hospital bed and they think
"Can't sleep?"
She laughed "Maybe. I don't mean right now, but... when you both feel ready. Your father will be your father, and I'll be me" That wasn't reassuring, but he didn't say so. "But it... we'll try"
Not without harming Draco in the process, and he wasn't about to take that loss. Besides, wasn't this what he had wanted since the end of the war? To just die?
"I think it's your duty as head of Slytherin to calm your students" Minerva was a great headmistress but she was scarier than Dumbledore. Well, Dumbledore had never been scary, at least not to him. Shit, he missed that old man. He really, really missed him. He would've seen through all of this and known that Malfoy was surely innocent. If he could see it, why couldn't she? What did they have on him that was so... damning?
"Thank you, darling" She whispered, he didn't look well. "Will you join me for dinner tonight?"
"Why?" He said, looking slightly unsettled. Was Draco giving him a scary look? He couldn't be sure. "Do you
"What is that supposed to mean?" Harry couldn't help getting angry when people thought of him like this sort of hero, of exemplary Gryffindor. He didn't want that, he had never wanted that.
Teasing was effortless, completely natural between them and it had been so
"Yes. Noah told us he was at the library and-"
"She saved you, did she not?"
Harry moved back as if he had been punched by his own words. His whole body tilted forward, trying to hug himself, trying to cover the deep wound that was inside his chest -the one no one could see. He didn't want to cry, he really didn't and he didn't feel like he was going to cry. He felt something much worse: he felt as if he was going to scream and break absolutely everything in that room.
"This is the better world, mom"
Bea was a sixth year Slytherin just like Elliot. Her hair was long and straight as an arrow, and she always seemed to be over everything. He had no idea why Noah liked her so much, but he did so he respected that. Finding her wasn't hard, but getting her to pay attention was another thing entirely.
"We can watch some other thing"
"That's so overdone, Malfoy, get wittier"
"That family was being haunted by a poltergeist and they had no wands!" There was a huge smile on Harry's face, and yeah, he had explained to him how muggles didn't
"To guide him?"
Harry looked back at Draco, seeing him struggling not to speak. "Tell him"
"Yes?" Harry stopped, of course he did. "I want to see you"
"I'm... alright" Draco looked into his eyes, seeing the shades of green he had been missing. "You?"
"We just want to talk" Ron tried, in a tone that surprised Harry: it was soothing and parent-like. It was the same tone an adult uses with a child. Merlin, they had really aged in just a few years, hadn't they?
"I mean
"Which one? I'll give you the form, but this is not handled here, Mr. Potter. You have to do it directly at Azkaban"
"Students, what happened today was terrible but the teachers already have a lead and will be putting a stop to it before it even escalates"
Shit. Where did he have his wand? He looked around, worried that if he took too long the creature would hurt Draco. Luckily the wand was right there, just in arms reach. Without thinking about his side and not wanting to look if he was truly hurt, he threw his wand to the other boy.
Harry decided to do something, instead of just wasting time so he picked up his map and opened it, tapping it with his wand and pronouncing the correct words to make it appear. It still amazed him how every single room in the castle -except the Room of Requirement- appeared with everyone's current location. If they weren't going to walk around to spy on the aurors at least he could make sure no one was doing anything suspicious.
"Draco, listen to me: you are not going to manipulate me, alright? You couldn't even if you tried" Draco raised an eyebrow and Harry shifted in place "Well, maybe you could, but... But I know you wouldn't use my feelings against me" Now he was whispering as well, moving a bit closer to him. His words seemed to have an effect on Draco, because he uncrossed his arms.
Surprisingly, Draco didn't cheat, starting at the same time as him. Well, Draco had never been a cheater. A sore loser? Definitely, but Harry didn't remember a Quidditch game where the blond tried to cheat. Hm. Harry made a mental note to ask him about Quidditch, but later.
"Noah's talking to her. They are not going to press charges or anything but she needs to go to see a therapist or something" He gave a quick glance towards the closed door. Harry knew how protective he was, and he assumed he was worried about Noah and how well he would fare against Beatrice. Of course, Harry didn't really know the story between the three but he knew Beatrice was only a child. A hurt one.
"No. Not at all. He knows it's something... He knows he can hurt me with it, he tried to make me angry or sad or whatever. I might have reacted...
"None of us are getting enough sleep, Harry... You know you can talk to us"
Elliot became tense and the hufflepuff widened his eyes completely taken by surprise.
Suddenly he wished for the night to come quickly, he still had lunch, and more lessons and maybe after all of that he could evade all of his friends and hide up in the Tower with the one person who he should be avoiding.
. Draco was thankful that Noah was being honest.
"The aurors are having a small meeting and I want to know what they are saying"
"I hate hospitals"
"Let's play a game!" Ginny smiled, looking at them "Never have I ever? Truth or Dare?"
"At first I thought it was because he knows"
I hope you liked it! Please leave a comment if you can, I got some amazing ones in the last chapter and it made me sooo happy you guys <3
"Goodnight"
Alright, so Malfoy had motive.
"There were things that needed to be done, for the good of the cause"
Harry read his letter while looking at the fireworks through his window, alone at Grimmauld. Ron had tried to convince him to spend the night with him and his family but he... simply couldn't. He closed his eyes while holding the piece of paper.
friends anymore?
She nodded, grabbing his arm and walking towards his bedroom. People
"S-so do you... like ice skating?" Draco spoke, and it was odd to hear him so nervous and insecure. Was this him out of his comfort zone? It definitely wasn't Harry's comfort zone. Touching other people? being warm and nice? Harry knew very little about that. He thought about Molly's hugs, and Hermione's and yeah that was lovely but it was different, wasn't it? Molly was the closest he had ever come to having a mother -even if it petrified him to say that out loud, for fear of being rejected by someone who already had a family- and Hermione was his friend, like a sister. This felt different.
"Well, we wanted to ask Elliot to help us" Harry said, trying to sound confident even if he didn't feel like that. What if someone else got hurt because he wanted to help? Last time he fucked up, Sirius died.
She sobbed, loudly and frantically. Her pain knew no ends, really, and Draco wanted to do something more. Try and soothe her or say the right words, but he never had the right words. Well, he knew what to say to Harry but... that had ended badly anyways.
near me?"
"Of course he's coming with-"
"We're not staying long," He added, not wanting to drag out the silence between them "I'm glad you are back on your feet"
) but he really wanted to. As far as he knew, Elliot had feelings for Noah but was too much of a coward to act on it, and apparently Noah was oblivious to all of this.
He would ruin it. Living with Harry would only make him see how pathetic he was. Draco's hands tightened on his shirt.
"I did. I mean, no. I just... Wanted to check up on you. That's all"
"Yeah? We need to tell the others" Harry frowned, not quite sure as to what his boyfriend -Merlin, his
with a respectable woman like Astoria. Of course, she knew this as well. They were friends, but only due to the situation they were in.
Draco rolled his eyes at him, but managed to squeeze his arm in passing. He hoped that would be enough to let him know something else was in the works, to make him go look for help.
"Yeah, got her wing all... Messed up because of it and... Ah! Hedwig" He jumped, looking at his fingers. She had a temper but she hadn't bit him in a while.
"Stop it with your damn hero complex, please!" Malfoy was clenching his teeth, his hands fisted at his sides. By all means he looked angry, even violent, but Harry had the distinct certainty that he was just scared, terrified even. "Stop trying to save me"
Harry couldn't remember the last time his ribs hurt that much from laughing. He received a playful shove from the blonde, but didn't respond because it might get more physical than he wanted. Harry had very much in mind that one moment when Draco had almost bled to death by his hand.
"Oh, yeah, sure"
Draco seemed to notice his doubt, because he closed the space between them and gave him a small kiss on the lips, a hand on the back of his neck. "See you"
"We are
Harry had decided that he was free to do as he pleased, and he was no one to ask him to leave, but he didn't really like having him in a place that meant so much to everyone
"What?"
"No" Draco didn't raise his voice, but his tone was definitive "No, come here"
"Don't sound so smug about it" He smirked, not knowing how to say it or if he needed to "Is it really that bad? He keeps acting as if..."
True, it wasn't anything flashy. He had limited himself to make sure the place was
They stayed in silence, hearing only the cracks of the burning wood in the fireplace. Outside the world was dark and silent.
Draco looked at him, getting up from the bed and searching for his vest and tie. It was clear whatever moment they had it was completely gone now. "Yes"
"So you did read them" Harry's thumb caressed the back of his hand, a small gesture that spread warmth all over his chest.
"That's rich coming from you"
Draco smirked and nodded "Alright"
"Oh, hello"
"Not what you think.. Probably. Just... maybe I'll tell you later"
(See the end of the chapter for
He nibbed at Draco's lower lip, feeling the softness of it, the way his breath hitched and his eyes closed. Merlin. How could someone be so beautiful?
He decided not to ask about his father because that would never go well. Lucius wasn't a good man. Was he? And Draco didn't deserve to go through whatever hell that man would put him through for this.
"Hurt?" Elliot sneered at Malfoy "Oh that's really
And that had been it. For almost a month, they both sat in the same place at night, staring at the same stars, as physically away as they could be.
"The Aurors"
He moved his hands from the grass up to his head, holding it while his knees tried to press themselves against his chest. It was easier to feel safe when he wasn't so exposed to the rest of the world. He would've liked a small room to lock himself in, preferably in the darkness. Not out there, with all the sun and the plants and the birds and...
Harry shrugged "For what I heard you were petrified... But those things sound normal to me. I get the invasion of privacy thing but it wasn't such a big deal"
He wasn't going to let them go all the way, not there. It had to be special, it had to be important. It had to.
"Neville told me what happened"
"Oh I needed help?
"Don't do that"
Sorry for the small delay - I had the worst migraine and a deadline from College so I kind of spent the last two days in bed and dying from stress.
"You look lovely today"
Deep breaths.
"There's a table outside for you both, go on now"
"Perhaps our name should die, Father" Lucius reacted as if he had been slapped, tense all around, anger in his eyes.
The almighty Ministry had decided he should finish his education. Nobody cared how Hogwarts now was a constant reminder of all the spilt blood. Perhaps they did consider that, perhaps they wanted him to be reminded of it every day and every night.
There was a brief pause and Harry almost expected to be sent back to his bedroom.
"Herm are you sure you need four books about the alchemical properties of...?"
"Does she say anything about the
"I'm just... I'm not ready. I'm eighteen... I've been doing what others wanted of me all my life and now that I have my freedom I... I just don't know what I want"
"Very well" Draco spoke, looking up with a small frown "Could I speak alone with you, Headmistress?"
"I don't..." Harry sighed "I think I don't faint anymore. It's just that I-" He looked over at Draco for a few long seconds and then back to the road "It was the first time I heard my parents, my mom actually. I heard her screaming. I was a baby when they died so I don't remember them at all. But when I heard... I knew it was her so... I..."
"Of course you do" Harry grimaced, his fingers a bit sore still. "She's basically a slytherin, proud and stubborn like you"
yet?"
“He's not dying”
Harry wanted to say how sorry he was for reacting like that, and how much he wanted to know what was going on. He also wanted to know if Draco had been avoiding him, if everything was good between them.
"We saw Noah as well" Draco whispered, sitting on Harry's bed. The curtains were now opened and it was clear they had been laying down, the sheets a bit messy and Draco's schoolbag at the end of the bed. Somehow it felt way too private for Harry and he wanted to make them look away from it.
"Thank you, headmistress" The one that was Sheppard said, smiling warmly before leaving with the rest of them in tow. Alright, at least they weren't there to take Draco to prison or blame them or anything like that.
Harry shook his head, shoulders straight and clearly trying not to show whatever it was he felt underneath all his walls. Was he jealous? Draco wanted to know. There was nothing to be jealous about, him and Astoria had only been engaged for a brief period of time, in which neither of them ever touched.
"Not until later, no"
"No hard feelings" He said raising a hand  but not stopping nor turning around.
"I think I'm getting the..." Harry said right before falling on his ass.
lower back "Is that okay?"
"What is this?!" A strong voice came from behind him and a spell must have been used because the other students were pushed away. Draco opened his eyes and quickly covered his arm again. They hadn't exposed the...
But he knew where power lead, and he had no interest in ending there.
"It's a game, Potter, surely you are familiar with it? I think your dear muggles invented it"
"I already did"
He looked down to try and undo his belt but...
Harry knew they were... but sometimes... Sometimes life was more complicated than that. Lucius Malfoy was, objectively, a bad person and yet Draco loved him. The Dursleys had been the only
Harry felt his heart sink. It wasn't fair. The aurors would surely find Draco guilty and something like this meant Azkaban. No. No. No. No.
"Harry, are you going to explain what happened?" His friends were staring at him with puzzled looks. Right.
"Slytherins are not all cowards"
-via Ron and Draco- that she had figured out what was going on between him and the slytherin. Of course it was one thing to suspect and another to have confirmation.
The real event that saturday was waiting for all of them inside the castle walls.
McGonagall turned to Jane and spoke to her for a couple of minutes, something about the wards and Azkaban -the sole mention making Draco flinch next to him- and Bea's recovery. Which-...
Draco was surprised. Perhaps he shouldn't have been, but he was. There was something in the way she said it, a longing he would never understand. He had never met any of his extended family, not in a way that could make him care
The auror had sat next to the door, and Harry knew that he would not get out from there. At least she didn't attack them. Was it because they were four and she was only one? Or was it because it was a semi-crowded place and she didn't want to get caught?
"He was... Through Snape's eyes he was a tormentor, a bully" Harry sounded so ashamed and disappointed Draco wanted to kiss him until he couldn't think anymore "I saw his memories"
Harry nodded, and felt his mouth freed again. Without looking away from the slytherin, he moved closer, trying to keep his breathing calm. Had he always been pretending? Around everyone? He knew when things weren't right, of course he knew, and he knew how families were supposed to love each other and he had no idea what had made  him so unlovable. Still, he had shrugged it off, tried not to focus on it, or simply never spoken about it in front of anyone else. It was too painful.
A pause. Neither of them moved. Harry was sure he didn't even breathe for a moment.
"If you don't have any questions I'll leave" And with that, he walked into the fireplace and left. Of course the floo network would be closed in his house but the aurors could still come and go as they pleased. Apparently it was a way to maximize Harry's
wanted her"
I hope you like it, it's shorter than I hoped it would be because I didn't want to keep you all waiting. I'm planning on one more chapter (perhaps it will be longer to compensate hehe) and the epilogue.
The first time he had pulled out his wand, quickly and without thinking. The other boy had stared at him, not surprised and not even alarmed and had done nothing to stop him. It was definitely weird, Harry had thought, how Malfoy wasn't even blinking at being pointed with a wand.
the Mark- but none of those things involved showing his true self. That wasn't the case anymore. He had shown Harry how much he cared, how much he loved him. He had showed him the things that made him cry and the ones that kept him awake at night. And Harry had stayed. Not only that but he had returned his feelings...
The blonde boy sighed and opened his eyes "You don't have to be sorry about things"
Harry felt something rising inside of him and he had to try very hard not to get up and leave. His breathing became a bit more erratic, memories of last night swarming inside his head like a bunch of bees.
Harry sat down on one of the empty chairs and rested his head on his hands, trying to breathe slowly to calm the beating of his heart. There was nothing wrong with taking some time for himself. There was nothing wrong with falling in love.
"Harry. Hey, mate..."
. How else could Harry be how he was? But he knew sometimes children have little in common with their parents.
Neither of them wanted to touch the unfinished bathrooms, so they would either have to wait until magic was available for them or ask the aurors if it was okay to hire someone. Luckily they had the en-suite bathroom and the one in the lower floor that had been remodeled by Harry already. They were simple, but clean and tidy.
Of course Bell had been aware of certain children trying to get in the way, but they were extremely inexperienced and weak. They cared about others. He knew exactly how to exploit that sort of weakness. And he would, if he had to.
"Yeah" Harry was still smiling, having no idea as to why, and feeling the air thickening inside of his body. It was odd, it had never happened before.
"You three, go see the Headmistress. NOW" The two boys and the girl glared at both of them, before walking away from the table.
"Alright, look, I have no idea who attacked me. I was going to see the game and then... it's all black."
It was a whisper but it was all he needed. Harry moved closer, kissing him with all the energy and giddiness the news had left in him. It was strange to think how bad he had felt just a couple hours ago. They were alone in a bed and Harry wasn't sure if he wanted to stop or go as far as Draco would allow.
"I'm sorry I didn't tell you what I was doing. But there was no time and you are a terrible actor. It had to be convincing"
Draco scoffed "Fucking raised by muggles, weren't you?" he meant it as an insult, great. Just great. It wasn't going to end well "People knowing my Father is weak is bad for us. Terribly so. Makes people who should be afraid of us not afraid, and it makes our allies
Harry swallowed "Thing is the Christmas break is coming and we don't have much time. Tomorrow we will examine the wand and see how much time we truly have before the aurors arrive"
They didn't move, and Draco looked as spent as he was. Harry tried not to feel guilty for not doing the same for him, but he was unable to move a single muscle.
"You walk all night?"
"Lucius, if he's not well..."
It wasn't particularly late and yet the library was almost empty. This tranquilized Harry, who had been really stressed at the idea of going inside a room filled with students that would glance at him and whisper. Some tables were packed, but it could be much worse.
The kid's arm had been carved with magic, long thick lines of blood falling to the floor.
"We are leaving as well" Noah got up, yawning a bit "I'll have to get up early anyways for... this"
"It's used to take something from one place and..."
"I think we need to leave, Potter"
"Don't say that" If there was one thing Elliot didn't like was seeing his friends hurt. Well, it's not like he had many friends... He didn't like seeing Noah hurt. Period. "I'm sure she's just... you know, Bea"
"Y-yes?"
The worst part of it was he missed his friends. Terribly so. Not only that but he didn't know if he would still have any friends once things calmed down. Pansy had proved to be... incredibly loyal to him, but she had put some distance. For her own well being, and he couldn't blame her. Blaise hadn't contacted him at all.
