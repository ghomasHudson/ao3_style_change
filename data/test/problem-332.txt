"What're you-" Draco begins, but is cut off as Harry flips them around, his cock still inside the boy, until Draco is underneath him, their faces only inches apart. Draco smirks and wraps his arms around Harry's shoulders, pecking him on the lips until Harry resumes fucking him. At this angle, with Draco's legs hooked on each of Harry's hips, he enters deeper into him. As soon as Harry thrusts into him, Draco moans uncontrollably.
"You're so fuckin cute," Harry blurts and smashes his lips on Draco's in a quick, heated kiss. "Do you need to be prepped?"
"I also have a spell for that," Draco chuckles, grabbing his wand and muttering the exact spell. Harry watched as the lube and cum disappeared from them both, leaving them clean, as if their interaction had never happened (besides the fact that Draco's hole was now even pinker). Draco scoots to one side of his bed, leaving room for Harry to lay next to him, and once both boys are laying next to each other, Draco grabs his blanket and covers them both.
"Oh fuck! Holy shit! I think you found my spot," Draco practically screams. He throws his head against the pillow and Harry kisses along his jawline while continuing to fuck Draco at that angle, knowing very well that he had just found the boy's prostate. He tucks his face into the crook of Draco's neck, taking in the boy's scent while slamming in and out of his tight hole. Harry soon feels the knot forming in his stomach, Draco's heat beginning to send him over the edge.
"Oh god, Draco. I'm gonna fucking cum," Harry grunts in Draco' ear, his hips stilling as he releases into Draco, and deep, guttural moan escaping his lips. Draco comes a second later, the combination of Harry's cock slamming into his prostate and Harry's stomach constantly rubbing against his cock pushing him over the edge. His hips just forward in a humping motion as the rest of his cum spurts out onto both of their chests. All four of his limbs wrapped around Harry tighten as his body freezes from his orgasm, forcing Harry to get even closer to him. They lay this way for a second as they come down from their high, chests' heaving with heavy pants. Harry removes his face from the crook of Draco's neck and kisses him slowly as Draco's legs fall off of Harry's waist and onto his bed. Harry breaks the kiss and rests his face against Draco's so that their cheeks were smooshed together, their eyes closed as they begin to feel their exhaustion. They lay for a moment, just enjoying each other's warmth, not wanting to move from the comfortable position.
"So this letter is checked for its authenticity by the unspeakables who will be joining us. So this note says that when some people will join us, we are going to receive some books for reading and that will sure help us for the truth. Now I hope you all will cooperate and arrive here at 9 o'clock in the morning. Thank you."
"Yeah. This git here has never cared for himself," Ron told him. "Don't give me the look mate, you know I'm right," he added noticing Harry poking his tongue out.
3. Harry tell them about the Dursleys. It's gonna be in the books and I'm sorry but we couldn't avoid that.
"So can I assume that everyone here believes our identities?" Teddy asked them getting absent minded nods from everyone.
"The guests Teddy and you will need to prove Mad-eye, you know. Remember what papa used to tell? " Lily told him.
We are going to ask for truth serum. So we wanted you to learn our identities first. Voldemort won't be able to get any information from Hogwarts, we've made sure of that. Annnd...What am I missing? "
As Draco was returning back, he was stopped by one of the girls stating that she needed his help. She took him in an old classroom and he was surrounded by those girls.
Scorpius sighed and raised his wand, “Why do  you need to be difficult always? Fine, here's your proof. I Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy, swear on my magic that everything we are telling you is truth” .  Bright light from his wand surrounded everyone and Lucius Malfoy was rendered speechless.
"Umm I'd hate to be one to bring this but we'll have to go to the great hall after some time. Don't we have things to discuss?" Neville asked them.
Harry brought out the map and began to search for the blonde's name. To his worry, the said person was alone in an old classroom with some Ravens who had a bad impression on him. That alone was enough for him to take off out of ROR towards the classroom. When he was about to open the door, though, he was stopped by a voice saying, Harry deserved better.
Luna linked her arm with Harry guiding him and everyone to the couches. Squeezing his hands for support she slowly murmured
"Liar…", Harry whispered in his ear. " Liar… who tells me I'm just a friend and then goes around making confessions…"
At this Ron snorted and everyone turned to look at him. Giving the perfect example of Weasley red face, Ron told them,
"Hey pup, remembered me now, have you?" He asked cheekily. Harry ignored his question, "Where are you Sirius?"
“I thought so too. But I guess it's a Potter thing. Not following this type of rules I mean. You can see for yourself- No one is supposed to live the killing curse, no one ok very few are able to cast Patronus charm, throwing imperius… Well, you get the list.”
“What are you talking about? No one has done anything to me and no one will. Now stop this nonsense at once”, the elder Malfoy thundered.
It was night time and most of the people had left the main hall after dinner. Draco was about to do the same. He was kept back because of his prefect duties and was alone left from the group who was yet to return back to the ROR where all of them had taken to rest.
"Yeah, Harry died with his soulmate... But before that he was forced in marriage with Ginny. Both were under the influence of love potions.”
"I don't remember any such person Harry " Sirius said after thinking hard. Everyone was the same. " But whoever they are, they are helping us, aren't they?" Neville asked timidly.
At this Harry and James, both looked at Teddy sharply. Former being astonished as to why would he ask such question and later being angry about the same. Teddy just gestured them to be silent as Sirius answered,
Here everyone present shared a smile . Luna serenely looked at Harry, "It must be nice to have friends, don't you think Harry? I've always imagined how it would be. No one liked to be friends with Loony you see."
" I... I don't know, ‘Mione " he managed to stammer out . Ron reached to him and pulling the parchment out of his hand, he read it out loud.
The readings had taken a toll on everyone. Making them feel like they were on a roller coaster and it was swinging all around. Many of the students and the visitors were also thinking that they were being manipulated into believing that potter-boy. Or else, how is it possible that many who were against him before the reading, were now a pro-Potter…
Harry stopped her firmly. "But you are my friend too, Luna." Luna teared up and hugged him thanking him again and again.
In the great hall, there was a single person who was shocked by the arrival of the past and future. He sat there fuming as no one had asked him a single thing. Not even told him what was going on and there was no way he could stop this now. Why couldn't they understand? He was doing all this for greater good. They were needed to be separated, dammit. What was he going to do?
Teddy stepped forward and helped the Potters on their feet and then turned to McGonagall, "I would like to explain them the situation in person, mam. And I need Remus Lupin, Severus Snape, the Malfoys, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Luna and Neville with me. So if I could take them in the chamber besides the great hall..."
Everyone seemed to realise that there were two people who didn't know about Sirius : Luna and Neville . Seeing their expressions Neville quickly assured them that he trusted Harry enough to believe Sirius was innocent. Luna, in her dreamy expression waved at him " hello Mr.Black . I see Buckbeak and you both are healthy . Now when are you starting another concert for your songs ? " Everyone had to cover their snort . Harry feeling relaxed now as everything was seemingly fine . Then it stuck him - maybe there were death eaters waiting for him . And after telling everyone that they all shared a good laugh. When kreacher came back Harry suddenly realised that it was related to slytherin ( by the snake sign . Imagine he knew it from chambers)
The next day couldn’t come earlier for the Potters and company. They had decided to meet in the ROR before going for breakfast. As everyone started gathering, the morning silence was turned into somewhat chaotic but warm conversations.
As James and Sirius were starting to tell about their friendship and everything that happened in the past they were stopped by the clearing of a throat.
"As we are aware, there are some things that need to be cleared and some of our guests have taken the liberty to bring a few books that they think might be helpful for us. So, we'll be taking turns in reading them. I expect you to maintain the decorum while this goes on. The classes have been suspended for the time being as we feel that the book might be taxing for us", here she sent a glare towards the trio making them duck their heads down and the others surrounding them laughed silently.
As he tidied everything up and began his journey back to ROR, he came across some girls in blue uniforms. Those Ravenclaws were few ones who always thought themselves to be the best ones… They were the ones who had kept bullying Luna and then Harry in this year. But after the times changed and people began to believe him again, he was back to be their hero.
Everyone in the hall blanched at this. Well listening that you are going to die is not the grate start of introduction. But it caught every person's attention for sure .
The said mad man was fully enjoying himself. He was sitting with his favourite godson (being the only one didn't count) and his best mates. Though one was supposed to be dead and one turned furry each month, he would not want to change them for the world.
Ron and Harry avoided looking at each other, Hermione had her face in her hands and Neville burst out laughing.Ginny looked at him compassionately.
On the other side Narcissa Malfoy went to Harry and hugged him(" Can this day get any more confusing? What's next? " Ron shouted).
" As I imagined, Everything is fine. Both of them will just be disoriented for an hour or two. Till then I can..."
"It's a very dark magic pup . It is horcrux . I have just listened about them . But I think we can destroy it ." A pair of eyes who were seeing all this silently decided now was the time to act . So Harry was suddenly grabbed and popped in front of Sirius . " Kreacher requests you to destroy it , master . " and he stood there waiting . " A little warning could be nice next time kreacher . Harry said grumbling . " kreacher is sorry little master . I is keeping in mind next time.”
"Ahem, everyone please pay attention. I have some news for you all. For some days there are rumours spreading along that you-know-who is back. So far I've taken measures to prevent them with very less success. Also I've noticed that you gave such a little cooperation to my secretary and your DADA professor Umbridge.
Harry smiled at all of them and if his eyes were little shiny, no one cared to take the notice of that. Sirius told them that he wrote letter to Remus asking him to come with twins. Then all of them took turns to explain the three everything. By the end twins were, for first time, lost for words and Remus stood there gaping.
"Some people also think that the reason Severus changed sides was Lily. And he loved her, non platonically."
“And I Prongs, welcome you to this wonderful place called Room of Requirement and a picnic spot to us for the time being.”
There was a cosy hall leading to two seperate ways where rooms for boys and girls were separated. In the hall there were many couches for relaxing one of which Sirius was occupying currently. Seeing him, Sirius stood up to hug him.
“I see a boy who is used to suffering, who isn’t afraid to risk anything for the ones he loves, who is brave and honest and loyal. But most of all, I see my kiddo, my son whom I left, who I want to be loved and cherished, who I want to protect with all my strength. I see the baby that loved to ride my bike, who happily squealed when he got his first broom or his stuffed dog. He is my baby whom I love.”  Sirius said all this in a soulless voice, but that didn’t mean it lacked the emotions that were being said. All the time while Sirius was speaking Harry had covered his mouth to avoid sobbing loudly. He felt as if a big burden was being lift-up from his shoulders. Though he had not said anything but Harry was also being affected by the opinion that Sirius saw him just a replacement for his father. But here was the proof that this was not true at all. All this time, he was seeing him as his son, jut as Harry saw him as a father-figure.
CRASHHHHH... A loud bang was heard from outside. Sirius turned into his animagus form and they walked out to see what happened. The seen met their eyes was very familiar, in fact they were in same position some time ago - a big group hug. Only this group didn't seem to have initiated it willingly.
In the great hall murmurs had broken out when James and Lily Potter were taken away with some other people. All the students were getting impatient. Why were they supposed to sit here doing nothing. When someone in 6th year mentioned this Rose, who was reminding them of resident know-it-all, looked up from her book on the Gryffindor table.
" okay don't shout at my name. I know you have read it but I still still know that you didn't realise it.
"You are right Luna. Now everyone will get to know about you-know-who. But they will also get to know about DA. What are we going to do about that?" Ginny asked.
"Do they know about the altered memories? NO,I don't think anyone will. Had I not taken any precaution, it would have been true. But the spell I used has no counterspell. Right, I don't need to worry. All my secrets are safe with me."
Rose sighed, “Oh, here I was thinking that I'll be needed to help you, you know…  To explain things. But now Mr. Potter is the one explaining so I guess we all can hear it. From the actual source this time.”
"What she said..." Ron told her awkwardly rubbing his neck. Neville laughed but agreed with him and Ginny just joined Harry in hugging her.
The dinner time in the Great hall was noisy as usual, but there were more than a few curious whispers that travelled through the students. After all, the mass murderer that everyone believed to be cruel and mad was sitting on the Gryffindor. If you ask anyone in the hall if Sirius Black was mad, the answer would probably be yes. It was just that the reasons why he was mad were different for each one.
" Teddy , everyone in the great hall is getting restless. Do you need help ? It will be faster if we both work "
It was the next day and the people inside Hogwarts were excited. Finally, they would get an explanation of what was happening and how things were going to work. It would be the first time that the great hall was packed with students and each and every one of the present, eagerly looking forward to the happenings. Soon, Prof. McGonagall stood up, as it was clear, everyone in the hall respected her and there was a pin drop silence.
And I was stuck with some works. Anyways, please be prepared for such late updates as I have a new job and I'm not really free.
Here six people stared dumbstruck at him. Now was the real question: Could they really trust this T.R.L. person? But they had no time to think now as minister had continued.
The dinner time in the Great hall was noisy as usual, but there were more than a few curious whispers that travelled through the students. After all, the mass murderer that everyone believed to be cruel and mad was sitting on the Gryffindor. If you ask anyone in the hall if Sirius Black was mad, the answer would probably be yes. It was just that the reasons why he was mad were different for each one.
" Harry I think we should see Sirius's gift first. Who knows it might help. And if not then we will go to the ministry. " Hermione added. All of them ran to the Gryffindor common rooms. Harry went into the boys' dormitory to collect the packet and came down holding it.
"Both Harry and Ginny were unaware of the potions, don't worry. None of you is to be blamed. But because of the excess amount of potions, Ginny went mad," here Ron trembled a bit.
We know you are dumb as a dodo which is like insulting the dodo but anyways. This is a letter, I'm sure you can guess that. This letter is sent to help you. If by any chance you have some self prevention, you'll go to Hogwarts and announce them that you will be reading some books. Leave rest to us we will handle it .
Seeing the encouragement on the faces of his friends, pseudo father and uncle, he took a deep breath and started talking.
At this Harry released the breath he didn’t even know he was holding back. Hermione looked at Teddy appraisingly. Ron and she had always known Harry was troubled by the same question even if he didn’t say anything and she was happy with that being cleared now. Teddy answered her with a smile and asked the next question.
" You are those who wrote the letters" she exclaimed, “Our children”, She blushed while saying the part.
It was a sweet promise between both of them. Promising a future, a bond and something more. But for now, they were happy having each other.
The Slytherin blushed again and tried to get away from him, but Harry was faster and soon Draco was caged between a wall and a sturdy chest. His escape was blocked by a pair of hands that hugged him from both sides.
The great hall was in an uproar. McGonagall and other professors were on their feet calming the students down. Teddy cleared his throat to gain everyone’s attention.
Minister choose this time to prove his idiocy, “Aurors, capture him. He will be taken for the kiss immediately”.
Draco shivered. He had not planned to get caught at all, not by anyone. And now he was stuck in sweet torture where he wasn't sure if he wanted to be free or get entangled more.
"Mr. Potter, care to explain what's going on here?" Professor Flitwick asked. He too was surprised to see the unusual group but as there was a Ravenclaw present, it was his responsibility as the head of house and he intended to do that properly.
Everyone laughed and took their seats at their respective tables. The ones from the future and past choose to sit with their parents and children. The Slytherins went back to their own places. No one seemed to realize the lack of hostility between the elder Potter and Snape or the younger ones and Malfoy. Nor did anyone pay attention to the two Gryffindors who were the only ones displeased with how things were working. And everyone chose to ignore the sulking Minister and his secretary, who were sulking because of the said attention or lack of it.
"Hermione and Ron couldn't grieve for you ‘cause after some time she had miscarriage. Luna was kept imprisoned by some death eaters who escaped and she was tortured to death. Neville died protecting Hogsmeade from attack and after some time Hermione and Ron went missing. After 4 years also we don't know anything about them. So yes, as I said this was a necessary risk."
Teddy cleared his throat, "So as you have realised we are going to read books of Harry's seven years. But before that I'm going to bring some last guests and then we can begin".
Although it proved to be a great day for some, it was worse for some. The Minister was pulled out of the great hall by Madam Bones. She was insistent on legalising the freedom of Mr Black, it seemed. He was dreading about tomorrows Daily Prophet. Doroles Umbridge could be said in the same situation. She was rescued from those filthy animals but then all the happenings in the great hall put her in a sour mood.
Was spoken in unison. And the kids burst out laughing. It was funny to see two grown-ups cowering. Lily commanded Teddy to continue.
Finally they moved, entering the great hall together and shutting everyone up quite effectively. Harry looked around, noticing the new people arrived. Present were with Hogwarts' professors, Minister, Madam Bones, Percy Weasley, Andromeda Tonks, Ted Tonks, Nymphadora Tonks, Kingsley Shacklebolt, Mad-eye, Albus Dumbledore, Minerva McGonagall who was now recovered, Hagrid, Weasleys, Lucius Malfoy, Narcissa Malfoy and to everyone's amusement very scared Umbridge.
He just turned to look at the Malfoys " Hey Luc, why are you just standing there? Come on join us" Sirius and Remus gaped at him.
“What I want to know is why Mr. Potter protecting the very person that is supposed to be the cause of his parents' murder and the said parents are helping with the same. Care to explain, Mr. Potter?”
As he was sure there were people who knew the truth, the ones who would protect him with everything, Sirius calmly went with Kingsley, allowing him to guide him towards the make-shift custody at the main table. He sat there without a fuss and let the Auror give him the truth serum. Everyone held their breath while they waited for the serum to take effect.
"Come on, Ron. Where's your sense of humour? Anyways this note is for clearing everything for you guys cause from tomorrow many things are going to be revealed about THE GOLDEN TRIO. Yes the golden trio as everyone knows you guys - Harry, Hermione and Ron.
Hermione stepped forward. "Yeah Luna. You are my friend too. I know I didn't believed in your creatures, I still don't but I believe in you."
" That was real quick for you, Jamie. Anyways I'm Rose Lavender Weasley, daughter of Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, I'm a Ravenclaw." Hermione smiled proudly here.
Sirius and Remus sat there being as supportive as they could. Twins had stopped all their jokes choosing to sit beside Hermione and listening silently.
Teddy cleared his throat, "About that Mr. Potter, as I was going to explain... their memories are changed. They don't remember. I mean they do but their memories are similar to your 5th year's OWL memories. Including Remus and Sirius's. I was going to explain this in the time that you were supposed to take to recover, but you didn't give me a chance." He shrugged his shoulders apologetically.
Thanks for the response on my last question. I've decided that Harry will be dominant but that doesn't mean Draco can't be equally possessive and protective.
There was a sudden hush in the great hall after the arrival of this group. After all 7 new people were with them and their ex professor and a dog. Every eye was solely fixed on them. Scorpius stepped forward .
Hermione gasped after hearing this. Ron's voice was thick while reading the next part and Harry stood there stunned. Luna was looking unusually sombre holding crying Ginny in her arms. Padfoot was stumped and was flopped on his four legs unable to move while Neville stood there shockingly quiet.
"Yeah they are but this time they won't. No offence Harry but I'm over you and I certainly don't wanna get mad," Ginny told them mischievously but firmly. Everyone nodded their heads in agreement and Sirius barked stating his approval.
"Ron, this is your kid. No one can react so much like you" Ginny teased her brother. Ron stuck his tongue at her.
I love him because of who he is. Not because of some stupid scar or some stupid person he defeated. I love him as a person, not as a trophy. And whatever you say is not going to change that."
"Don't worry mate. We will get out of this. We always do, don't we?" Ron said smiling. "Oh,come on! This light is being the most irritating thing now," he exclaimed as there was again the same light and again a new note carried with it.
"I swear Harry I'll never want to do this to you. I'm really sorry." Harry hugged her. "I know Gin. I believe you."
Then they agreed to spend the night together in ROR where there were separate rooms for each of them. Bidding goodbye they all went to sleep. Everyone thinking of tomorrow and the changes it would bring.
"Blimey, don't you think this letter is written by Mione? I mean see the details and the length." Here Ron was again slapped on his head by Hermione but she smiled nonetheless.
“Do people really don’t know that he is my brother? Of course, his name is Potter-Black. Mum and dad adopted him in our sixth year”, James huffed angrily. Amelia decided to continue the questioning.
If I am there with him, I'll be there with my whole heart. By his side, not behind him so that I can run away, but shoulder to shoulder.
" What's the matter, pup? Is everything ok?" Realizing that her friend was busy at the moment, enjoying seeing his godfather alive, Ginny stepped forward.
They all separated after some time. Harry smiled brightly at all of them receiving similar ones in return. It was Ginny who broke the silence.
"Give it here, Ron," Luna said, her voice was shaking but she stood firm. "You don't have to read this. I will. We all know this will be hard for you," she took the letter from him and started reading.
"At least I didn't change my response with his popularity. I was against him… even when he was famous. And if I am with him now, I plan to be with him wholeheartedly. Can you say the same thing about you? You, the one's who will be the first to get away again if something else happens?
Around the wizarding world many changes were occurring by the said blue light. But no one would notice that till the next day.
Right now the said wizard was running from the ugly toad known as Umbridge and her inquisitorial squad. He had to save his Godfather from the clutches of Voldemort. By his right side was his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Somewhat behind them were Ginny Weasley, Neville Longbottom and Luna Lovegood with whom he had come close during this year. The pain in his scar increased, forcing him to stop. His friends only a sec behind worried about him. And a sudden blue flash appeared out of nowhere.
Harry repeats the same actions a few more times, Draco writhing beneath him. Harry grips Draco's hips and hollows his cheeks sucking as hard as he can up and down Draco's shaft until Draco moans out, "Fuck! I'm gonna cum." Harry quickly pulls off and leaves Draco groaning in frustration from having his dick left hanging.
Harry continues his trail of kisses further down until he reaches Draco's cock and takes the tip in his mouth. He sucks on the tip for a second, then takes his entire shaft in his mouth until hitting the back of his throat and making him gag. Draco throws his head against the pillow and moans loudly, tugging on Harry's brown locks.
Once Harry is laying back, his rock hard cock arched, the red tip touching his stomach and begging to be touched. Draco does just that and straddles himself over Harry's cock so that his hole is in line with Harry. As he holds onto the base of Harry's cock, his tip slowly, yet easily enters him. He lets go of the base of Harry's cock and grabs his shoulders to help him balance. Harry grabs Draco's hips and helps him ease himself slowly down, quietly moaning as he feels his hole stretch over Harry's thick cock. Even though he fingers himself often, it had been a long time since he had had a cock inside him, let alone one of Harry's size, and he was in love with the burning sensation that engulfed him. Harry relishes in the way Draco's eyes squeeze shut and the way Draco's nails dig into his shoulders. Draco's mouth is slightly ajar and he desperately wants to kiss the boy, to feel the inside of his mouth with his tongue again.
"Is it too much trouble for you Potters to behave normally for once? I read each and every instruction clearly and it states that you need at least 2 hours to speak and half an hour minimum to get used to your surroundings. Apparently I can't expect that from you guys."
But the letter was blank. As he was telling them the same thing,  the doors of the great hall were opened and minister Fudge strolled in. By his side were Amelia Bones, the director of DMLE and his undersecretary, Percy Weasley. The minister went in front of the hall and pompously cleared his throat to get everyone's attention.
She then looked at the head table "As for the Aurors, may I suggest for bringing some extra veritaserum and taking notes as everything happening could be hard to remember" Aurors hurried to do just that and Mad-eye looked impressed with her.
"Aunty Luna " was all the warning she got and she was attacked in hug by bushy red head. she caught her anyways .
Was the letter they read before everyone got engulfed in the light and soon they were standing in the main hall with all students, everyone as confused. There was a flash of light that nearly blinded everyone and everything went blank.
"Forget about the DA, Mione. Didn't you listen? He said books BOOKS as in plural. So if we're going to say they are about us then they will be from the start. Remember the stone? Chamber? What about Buckbeak? " Harry burst out.
“Leave the pup be, he’ll tell us if he wants to.” Harry’s Godfather turned to him. “We’ll always be here, pup. We love you. Your parents loved you, and as I can see your friends too. And as for Moony, I can assure the same about him.”
" I'll take it from now if you don't mind, Scorp." Teddy said. Then looking at Madam Bones he added, "We would first like to prove ourselves So can you please arrange veritaserum..."
Many started to protest but were silenced by a glare by Rose. Lily helping her as much as she could. Both of them then went to see what happened in the chamber.
As Harry calmed down, he released Sirius from his grip, smiled sheepishly at his friends receiving understanding smiles in return and signaled Teddy that it was ok to lift up the spell.
"Minister Fudge, we are the ones who sent you the letter. Yes, I can prove that cause I can tell you the letter. It goes this way :
Finally, Teddy came forward. He went towards the stool where the books were kept in a protective bubble. With a tap from his wand, the bubble vanished and he could pick up the first book. Then, he turned towards the stern professor and handed her the book. It was time to learn some truths.
Everyone was transported to the main hall in Hogwarts. Being the dinner time, they shocked all the students by coming there suddenly out of air. Of course, apparating inside Hogwarts was impossible and many who knew that were dumbstruck.
Where was I? Right, Voldemort is dead so why send the books? Actually defeating Voldemort solved nothing. There was so prejudice among the people that no death eater was spared. Not even those who were forced. And many truths came out later. Let's just say that it wasn't pretty.
In the meantime, Teddy requested Madam Bones to ask just about his innocence. Afterall what happened was going to be told soon while reading the books. This made her pause for a second but soon she agreed to accept his request.
"Ok. We will make sure that she's rescued by tomorrow. Right now as I was saying, we had a lying problem. So I've decided to stop it forever. Today I found a note by name of person T.R.L."
Teddy looked at Harry and company. "Are you guys sure you'll be ok? Or do you want me to stop? I mean this truth is going to change your lives you know. And I'm sure we won't mind if we had to take a break".
And no matter what; don't forget that you have always been through thick and thin. So don't let this books affect your friendship. It's true in every sense."
All the newcomers took three drops and stated their names proving that to be truth. Everyone in hall was shocked hearing Al's name causing him to grumble. Same happening with James but he basked in all the attention he got. All the professors were panicking to have another James Potter in Hogwarts. Now all looked at the future generation in shock and somewhat awe.
. Not that she hadn’t been eating up knowledge from forbidden literature before. She just finally isn’t under the fear of getting detention for it), but it’s getting harder and harder to keep this relationship thing away from his friends. There’s only so many valid excuses he can come up with.
It’s clear that we don’t fall under those categories, so who are we? Who am I when I buy purple grapes in October because they’re your favorite, Harry? No one eats them. They ripen and rot on my table until they’re nothing but a home to a family of fruit flies and poor Blaise has to throw them out because I can’t fucking look at them without falling apart and he can’t figure out why. Who am I when I wake up in agony, seeing nothing but crimson flames and he has to hold me while I mouth
First comes Blaise Zabini with his golden shirt, unbuttoned almost all the way and that smirk that never seems to get off of his gorgeous face. After him comes Pansy Parkinson and she’s equally as stunning, wearing a two piece maroon colored suit, with nothing but a lacey bra underneath.
“Hmmmph–“ he groans, grabbing two harsh handfuls of Draco’s ass and squeezing. “You’re goin’ to be the death of me.” Draco could say the same thing back.
Draco doesn’t answer anything to that, but he does turn his face away when Harry tries to catch his lips in a kiss. He sulks a little just because he can, finding that Harry’s still chasing his mouth and placing a tiny kiss on it even when it’s pouty.
that’s no way to speak to someone who’s literally got their mouth full of your ass darling,” Harry teases and Draco knows he’s meant for it to be all playful and snarky, but fuck it comes out sexy and wanton instead and all it does is it makes Draco’s cock twitch on his stomach. “You do know I could stop at any moment–“
. All he did was snog Draco sodding Malfoy in there. But at least he’s not like Ron. He lost his pass the day after he got it. Actually, Harry’s pretty sure Hermione’s the only one that’s been using it for
“Is that what you want?” Harry asks hovering above him. He’s brushing his lips lightly over Draco cheek, then his brow and jaw.
I guess he’s right. I don’t really talk to people anymore. I don’t have anything to say to them. Last Tuesday I complimented Neville on his new robes, but that hardly counts as social interaction.
He has a feeling that the bloke he’s actually shagging will come as more of a shock to Ron and Hermione than Goyle ever could.
“That’s not what I meant and you know it,” Harry says, trying to make it come out all stern, but instead landing on gloomy and disappointed.
“You’re fucking Draco Malfoy?” Someone practically yells from behind Harry and shakes him out of his fantasy about devouring Draco on the spot. He turns around automatically, realizing it’s none other than Ron, that’s yelled the accusation in such disbelief.
“You’re not going to tell us, are you?” Hermione implicates in Harry’s silence. She’s always been able to read him. Most days even before he can read himself.
. Fuck me,” he commands and gets just the thing he wants, Harry slamming roughly into him. Draco closes his eyes focusing intently on all the sensations he feels like the slight burn of the stretch and the amazing friction Harry’s cock creates inside of him as he moves. He hears the slapping of skin onto skin, the wet sound of lube and their bed shrieking under the sheer force of Harry’s thrust and in no time he’s finding himself right on the edge again, his third orgasm impending.
like you couldn’t tell the difference. Like it was the same to you. If it was a lie, it was a damn believable one. You, repeating my name like that, calling out God’s name – that was the holiest I ever felt.
Draco doesn’t respond. He’s sitting on top of the desk still, his lanky legs dangling from it. He has his thinking face on. It’s the one that’s slightly pouty, with scrunched up white eyebrows and gentle creases between them. Harry want to straighten them with his thumb. He kisses Draco’s forehead instead.
His eyes are so green, shining brightly like two emerald gemstones behind his glasses as Draco reaches out a shaky hand to straighten the frames on his nose. They’re all crooked and disheveled just like the rest of him is and Draco is mesmerized. He doesn’t feel capable of forming any coherent sentences right now though, so he just sticks to nodding his head with a stupid dazed smile on his lips instead. It’s the special one that stretches his sharp cheeks oddly and even though his teeth are blindingly white he knows they still come off weird when he has a smile like that plastered on his face. Only a handful of chosen people get to witness it and an even smaller amount get to have it be directed their way. Harry’s one of them of course and he always claims that it’s his favorite. He always tells Draco so too.
. Maybe they should have a proper talk about it first. Harry’s already tried that, of course, but maybe this time Draco will actually listen.
I sometimes think of us as characters in one of Agatha Christie’s novels. Who’d be the cold-blooded, robbed-of-all-empathy murderer and who the naïve reckless victim?
Harry almost squeaks with joy and he probably would if he had any more time to react, but then Draco sits on his lap, tucking himself into the cradle of Harry’s arms, moving them around himself, like they’ve been doing this for eons. He smells of that citrus shampoo he loves and of chocolate pudding they had for desert. He probably tastes like it too.
He kisses down Draco sternum then, moving to circle his nipple wetly and if it were someone else Draco would probably get all flustered by the instant stiffness that the sensitive bud forms. A shiver runs down his spine morphing into an electricity shock that travels straight into his aching cock. Thank Merlin, Harry is picking up lube from the foot of the bed, popping the cap open and pouring it into his palm. He’s kneeling over Draco as he takes his cock out from his pajama pants and Draco’s heart swells with the domesticity of the situation they found themselves in. He can’t believe he gets to have these lazy cozy fucks with Harry on Sunday afternoons. It’s so lovely it makes his heart hurt.
He’s okay with leaving it nameless at the moment though. He’s quite certain it’s not going anywhere anytime soon.
He leaves the Charms classroom with a dumb smile on his face, thinking about how that last soft whisper Draco sent his way felt dangerously promising. He doesn’t want to get ahead of himself, but tonight might just be the night it finally happens. The world might just find out Harry Potter has a boyfriend. Yes. That’s what they are. He knows it. Something tells him Draco knows it too.
It’s loose and almost completely undone, dangling over his unbuttoned chest and Harry has to grip the armrest not to jump up and onto Draco.
Harry laughs at the thought of him and Gregory Goyle getting up to any activity other than cleaning the dusty Potion’s cupboard (they had to do that last week and Goyle kept purposely stepping on Harry’s foot). Then again, Harry used to laugh at him and Draco getting up to any sort of business together and look at them now. Insatiable and mad with each other.
“Or rather how,” Hermione adds. This conversation is getting more and more awkward by the second and still all Harry can think about is whether him wearing Draco’s tie means that Draco is somewhere out there walking around in a Gryffindor tie. In
“Hi,” Harry echoes mesmerized, slowly reaching out to touch Draco’s pinky finger with his own, just to have some of that skin against his. It’s warm. It’s almost never this warm.
“No!” Draco yelps pathetically, pushing Harry’s head back to where it belongs – in between his lax legs. Harry goes willingly, chuckling an adorable laugh and then it’s all uneven breaths and slurping noises that really shouldn’t be half as arousing as they are and Draco squeezes his eyes tightly shut.
Blaise is good to me. I understand this might not be what you want to hear right now, but that doesn’t change the fact that it’s true – he does make it easy. He’s easy to care for, he makes me breakfast (and doesn’t burn it), he kisses my forehead and mother loves him. He does all the things you did, except he doesn’t adore me as much. I don’t blame him though. I don’t think anyone’s ever adored me the way you did, Harry. And I’m also not sure that’s a compliment.
Harry slowly pulls out, shamelessly watching as Draco’s hole twitches and oozes his come. He hooks a thumb into it, causing Draco to flinch a little and then brings it to Draco’s lips parting them and pushing it inside. Draco gladly swirls his tongue around the bulky digit, sucking off Harry’s come and letting his eyelids flutter in what he hopes is at least a little bit attractive way for someone who’s just been fucked out of his mind. Harry smiles serenely at him, that big stupid smile that Draco could very much live off of.
“That good?” Harry asks with a rough raspy voice, his head coming up from where it’s nestled between Draco’s legs.
It’s been great fun at the beginning, what with the breathless groping in the abandoned dark corridors and the endless rutting in the library’s forbidden section (All of the Golden trio had gotten a pass to visit it freely from McGonagall back in September. Turns out defeating your generation’s darkest wizard had some advantages after all. Not that he used the pass for any actual reading.
“Why did no one tell me I was walking around in a bloody Slytherin tie all day?” He practically cries out once he’s stepped out of it, like his friends are to blame for the mismatched tie.
“We switched ties–“ Draco begins bashfully, as if Harry’s not aware of the fact. When Harry nods knowingly, Draco continues “And I… I realized I didn’t mind,” He says.
. He tastes like chocolate pudding. And like safety and comfort and something else too. Something Harry’s a little bit afraid naming. Something that feels too big for his chest, too precious to hold.
Draco finally sits completely on Harry's dick, both of the boy's sighing as they look into each other's eyes for a second. Draco lifts himself up again, groaning as he slams himself back onto Harry, wanting to get as much friction between them as soon as possible. Harry closes his eyes and throws his head back in pure pleasure, the heat surrounding his cock already making him feel as though he would cum. Draco moves up and down fast, enjoying the feeling of Harry's cock stretching him wide. Draco moves so that his hand is pushing into Harry's strong chest, his other hand stroking his own dick in time with his hips.
"Fuck. You feel so fucking good inside me Harry!" Draco loudly moans. Harry finally opens his eyes and looks at the beautiful boy riding his hard cock. He moans incredibly loud when he sees Draco's hole stretching around his cock, and the way Draco lifts himself just enough so that just his tip is still inside him, then slamming down, taking all of Harry. Draco's light hair bounces up and down with each movement he makes, his eyes still half-lidded, the boy not actually looking at one specific thing, just pleasuring himself on Harry. Harry notices the way his pink tongue wets his lips, and the bruises that were forming on his hips from how hard Harry was gripping him. The sight of Draco ride him so perfectly makes him one hundred times hornier and he gets the sudden urge to fuck the boy senseless.
Harry abruptly sits up and wraps his arms around Draco, forcing both of them to stop their movements.
Again, just like the many times before, Harry watches Draco turn his head in Harry's direction, but when Draco realizes he's been caught, his face turns beet red and he stands up, leaving his half-filled bowl of soup at his seat and waving away his friends as they begin to question him. Harry watches him walk to the entrance of the Great Hall, glance at Harry and leave the building. Harry finds this incredibly suspicious and he begins after the boy not even a second later, knowing this was most likely his one small chance to spy on Draco while he is alone. He also leaves his half-eaten food and ignores his friends as they call out to him, both of them quickly giving up a moment later and returning to their argument.
"You know, here and there," Draco chuckles, his face turning pink from the fact that his childhood crush now knows that he taught himself spells to get off.
"Draco," Harry replies smoothly, " I heard you moaning my name. You can't pretend that you didn't say it 'cause you're a pretty loud moaner." If Draco's face could get any red, he'd probably catch on fire. "Don't be embarrassed. Let me take care of you." Harry grabs Draco's cock again and uses his other hand to push Draco's chest down, attempting to get him to lay down.
Harry breaks the position and sits up, looking down at Draco's hole. He grabs the base of his own dick and slowly pulls out of Draco's hole, the boy hissing from the cold and the over stimulation. Harry quietly groans as he watches his cum slide out Draco's hole.
"That's not what happened! There was something wrong with my wand or something. I said the spell correctly, right Harry?" Ron argued, turning to Harry for support as he shoved a chicken leg into his mouth.
"No, Ron, stop arguing. You said the spell incorrectly, end of story. How else do you think your small plant turned into a frog instead of a tree?" Hermione lectured Ron while they ate their lunch in the Great Hall.
"Well, I guess me watching you could be considered spying if you think about it," Draco giggles along with Harry. Harry interrupts their laughter and kisses Draco, slowly starting to stroke him and rubbing his thumb over the wet tip. Draco moans, "God, Harry. You're good at this." They look into each other's eyes, Harry slowing the strokes, squeezing Draco's cock as he moves his hand upwards and loosening his grip as he strokes downward. "I want you to fuck me, Harry. I want to feel you inside me, to feel you stretch my hole around your cock, to feel you cum inside me. I want you to feel good." This makes Harry groan and quickly nod, feeling his bulge press against his trousers, begging to be released.
When he first enters the room, he takes a moment to observe the room. He starts scolding himself for not entering soon enough to find what room Draco was in, but he decides that he would just check every room until he found him. He assumed it wouldn't be that hard due to the fact that nobody else was there. He begins checking each room, but quickly stops himself when he hears some sort of noise. He follows where he thinks the sound is coming from, and is led to a closed door where he can hear a muffled, deep moaning. He slowly grips the door handle and turns it, letting the door steadily open until it was yawning and Harry could walk through with no problem. He is frozen in his steps when he sees Draco lying on his bed, his red cock gripped tightly in his hand and his eyes squeezed shut, oblivious to the open door. Harry starts to turn away, not wanting to invade in Draco's privacy, but stops in his tracks when he hears Draco moan and say, "Oh my god, Harry. If only you knew what your looks did to me. I wish you were fucking me right now. What I wouldn't give to feel your cock slide in and out of me."
In the circle, both James and Lily started to stir. Lily being first to open her eyes soon followed by James. The great hall gasped in sync. Slowly Teddy started to stop his wand movements. Others following one by one, Lily Luna being the last person to stop. When all 7 of them stopped, So had the circle stopped glowing.
"You think you are good for him, huh? Really, one's who turned their backs on him as soon as something happened to want to get close to him now, just because he's famous again?", he sneered.
Unknown to the six some conclusions were drawn in the Hogwarts' students. Most joining the dots and thinking about the coming changes.
Each potter rushed to explain causing everyone to laugh. Sirius was pleasantly surprised seeing how every Potter had rushed to protect him while all the girls in the group were internally gushing over it. Lily Luna came forward to explain to them, “Madam Bones, I would suggest you use the Veritaserum now. Some of us know for sure that Sirius is innocent of all the crimes he has been accused of and now would be the best time to prove that.”
Draco watched his parents warily. For the first time in his life his mum and da...Father were so emotionally open in public. And that too for Potters.
She nodded dumbfounded. Teddy then directed all of them to the chamber. Malfoys and Snape following them.
Suddenly the atmosphere changed and Harry seemed unable to look at anyone of them. Sirius held him by shoulders and made him look in his eyes.
He finished by taking a bow all the while grinning from ear to ear. No one felt the need to read the letter, Fudge's red face was very telling.
“My plans can’t go wrong this way. They are not supposed to be. Slytherins and Gryffindors can’t be together, especially this group. I have to stop them. Why can’t they learn that I am doing this for the greater good? Don’t they know I am the leader? Why is no one asking my opinion? Why?”
Harry looked at all of them. Ron and Hermione gave him assuring nods. Luna smiled held his arm like she had done in the morning. And twins and Neville smiled at him. He looked at Draco who was surprised at being included but gave a hesitant nod anyways.
"Don't worry. And as you said everyone will get to know about everything. Doesn't that mean the truth about your Godfather too?"
"Me next. Me next" James came forward . McGonagall's eye started to twitch which surprisingly was noticed by everyone. Even James himself "Aww come on Minnie. You gave the same reaction at my sorting".
"Umm, yes. For James and Lily first. James ,here everyone thinks that you and Severus were arch rivals or something like that. And You were arrogant toe-rag" He told them raising hands in surrender. "Not my words, I'm telling as I heard them”.
The Minister was pulled out of the great hall by Madam Bones. She was insistent on legalising the freedom of Mr Black, it seemed. He was dreading about tomorrows Daily Prophet. Doroles Umbridge could be said in the same situation. She was rescued from those filthy animals but then all the happenings in the great hall put her in a sour mood. The next day would certainly be a special one. Whether it’ll be good or bad was yet to be seen. The next day couldn’t come earlier for the Potters and company. They had decided to meet in the ROR before going for breakfast. As everyone started gathering, the morning silence was turned into somewhat chaotic but warm conversations.
"So while James is away, I'll take the chance to hurry up I mean, I'll continue for him. We have some books with us. They are about the 7 years Harry spent here and we are going to read them together.
"You know, we said we love you no matter what but this is whole different thing." Fred said dramatically.
A beat of silence was all that there was before what felt like millions of voices echoed Sirius’ last words. A tentative smile climbed onto Harry’s lips.
" He had a vision, Sirius . Of You-Know-Who kidnapping you. And when he floo-called, Kreacher said that you were not there." And one by one they all told him the whole story. By the end of it Sirius was seething in anger.
Rose huffed and got up from her seat. “What are these people doing? Harry and the others aren't that thick. It shouldn't be taking this long.” She decided to check herself.
She nodded and signalled Kingsley. He took out the standard veritaserum for Aurors from his robes and handed it to her.
After gasping, Neville said, "I know what that is, Harry. They are two way mirrors. If you say the name of a person in it, you can speak with him with the help of these", He said. Not sure of himself, Harry held the mirror and clearly spoke 'Sirius Black' in it. After a second or two he was able to see his godfather's cheerful face and everyone visibly relaxed.
Teddy had cast the spell in such a way that all the students in the great hall couldn’t hear anything. You could say that the ones who were able to listen were the ones that were present in the ROR and the Tonks’s, all the Weasleys, Madam Bones, and the ones that were in the order.
He hated to violet Sirius’s trust this way, but it was necessary for him to do this. He would apologize to Sirius later, but right now Harry needed this.
And soon, the conversation that was started as fun turned into a serious one. There were secrets that very few had an inkling of- some joyous, some plain crazy and some that brought them into tears. But one thing was for sure, the youngsters were becoming closer to each other. The trio was turning into a circle, and no one seemed to find anything wrong with it.
"Quiet you guys. You are here to address the students and guests not fighting between yourselves. Teddy come here and explain everything. You lot stay with us no one will speak anything till Teddy is done speaking . Understood?" Harry asked them and every teacher was astonished at the authoritative sound of him. McGonagall was impressed. Harry had single handedly stopped every voice in the hall. Talk about leadership.
Don't worry about your adventures as you can say about them. You won't be punished. So many things are going to come in light that they won't even have time to think about it.
"Right, come on guys. These are what 7 books? Of course we can handle them. And as far as I can tell, you guys are fine so there won't be any death threatening situations. I mean what can be more threatening than Azkaban escapee?"
Now, they had problems with the company that he had decided to keep, namely the Malfoys. And that's what they were going to tackle now.
Teddy continued,"Sorry Ron, but I said for the world. Anyways it's up to Draco who he wants to show his real side. So I'll just continue. Where was I? Right... Draco is snob, Harry is a mediocre wizard and he doesn't know about the titles he has or the politics".
After that it was again time for Kreacher’s tale . By the end of it Sirius was in tears. But there was a glint in his eyes - glint of determination. He told kreacher to bring the locket . In meantime they all started discussing about the mysterious letter senders . Now there were three considering the initials.
"Of course, anyone would be better than you… A Malfoy. And Harry needs someone who is studious and smart. Not a Slytherin…"
So as you guessed correctly, the books mentioned are about you guys. From year 1 to 7. The future will be changed but this are memories of our time. So we sent you the letter and at the same time another letter for the minister. His letter simply says that truth will be discovered. That's why he is agreeing for the reading.
There's a new chapter for the series. So as I figure out how to connect the two stories together in a series, you can read the chapter now. Also, please help me if you can, I'm lost here.
I really think that even though Sirius and Harry had a great bond, there were many misunderstandings in-between. So, I am trying to clear those.
“I guess it'll take more time than we thought of first. So we are tweaking the plan a bit. You guys can go outside, roam a bit or do anything you want. I am sorry but you can't go outside of Hogwarts. Just come here at 8 tomorrow and we'll start then. Thank you and Goodbye.”
"Are you ok?" Harry asked after a while of silence. After a mostly loveless childhood, he was more than willing to give all his love to his Godfather.
Another thing is Hogwarts rumour mill has spread so many lies or far fetched truths in lives of Harry, Hermione and Ron. That should be cleared.
"Are you sure you don't want to talk? Sure that you haven't said anything? It's just that I'm hearing things? Are you sure?"
"Calm down people. I know this is sudden and it will be hard on you but at least explain your actions to your children. They are baffled you see." He looked around and saw Luna's serene smile, "Except for aunt Luna that is."
Then I have my sisters here (He looked at Hermione, Ginny and Luna. Three of them looking brightly at him). And I have Ron, Neville and these gits (He pointed at twins who acted to take their hats off) as brothers. This are my family you know.
"Oh I'm so sorry,my baby. I should have done something. I should have stopped him from taking you. "
"But no. I'm not thinking about the guests right now and I'll prove Mad-eye when it's time. I think we can go, collect the people we need and explain them the situation." Teddy said talking mostly to himself.
On the other side of the Great Hall, a certain young Malfoy was thinking along the same lines. After all, he knew his parents were not fully supportive of Voldemort. However, learning the truth was even more surprising for him. His parents seemed... Loving! Oh, he knew they loved him. But expressing it in such a way!! And then there was Potter. The bindings on Potter and he had loosened, lessening their effects. And they were....!! Oh, how he blushed even after thinking about it. Although it proved to be a great day for some, it was worse for some.
"Relax. I'll let you cum once I'm fucking you." Harry smirks as Draco rolls his eyes and says, "Then hurry your ass up and fuck me."
"Draco, I don't hate you. I followed you from lunch 'cause I thought you were spying on me, but I guess not. Now, let me take care of you," Harry chuckles, and Draco relaxes in his grip.
Harry was paranoid. He always had been, considering the fact that someone (He Who Must Not be Named) tried to kill him as a small child, and had repeatedly attacked Harry on multiple occasions when he failed the first time. He knew He Who Must Not be Named had people that worked for him, trusted him, wanted to please him, were forced to obey him. So, when he repeatedly caught his childhood nemesis staring at him, he quickly became suspicious. Death Eaters were everywhere, crawling like rats under the floorboards of dirty rooms, spying on anyone and everyone every chance they got, and Harry was nearly one hundred percent sure that Draco was one of those rats, crawling under floorboards beneath his bed, searching for any type of crumb he could steal to bring to He Who Must Not be Named. Draco was easily the worst spy, and no matter how hard he tried to cover up the intense stares towards Harry that he had been caught in over the many years, Harry knew what was going on. Draco was taking notes of Harry's every move and reporting back to He Who Must Not be Named. Harry was exhausted, and desperately wanted to put an end to this.
Harry immediately feels his cock hardening. He knows he should leave and forget this ever happened, but the thought of Draco's expression when Harry fucks the shit out of him, to feel Draco's warmth around his cock is so tempting. Out of pure impulse, Harry tears off his cloak and walks up to Draco, sitting on the edge of the bed and taking the boy's cock in his hand without saying anything. Draco jumps up and tries to cover himself, knocking Harry's hand off of his cock in the process, his cheeks turning red out of embarrassment.
They don’t use cleaning charms or conjured lube on Sundays. They take a boiling hot shower instead and Harry always complains about it but stands through it nonetheless. Draco has a feeling it’s only because he washes his hair under them.
You’re too kind-hearted, Harry, you’d never do it, and I, as we’ve come to unravel once again, am weak and a coward.
He realizes now why everyone’s been looking at him weirdly all day. He was sure people were staring at him more than the usual amount, but he just brushed it off as being paranoid. Dean even asked him “if he was finally getting some” and now Harry can finally understands why.
It’s hard to find anything without his frames, but he manages to locate his tie and bag eventually, jerking when a hand lands on his forearm.
That’s not how our murder mystery ends, love. We don’t get to perform a massacre and walk out of the burning building like we did when we were kids. We are the unreliable narrator of this storybook, we built this slaughterhouse on our own shed skin and hollow bones.
Harry shifts on the bed a little, something that looks a lot like rutting and suddenly it hits Draco how sexually frustrated Harry must be. His cock is probably all red and thick against the cotton of his pajama pants and they’re probably already damp with precome. Draco came two times and he’s already feeling up for the third one and Harry’s been persistently arranging that without taking care of himself or asking Draco to do it for him in return, so he must be feeling tortured.
