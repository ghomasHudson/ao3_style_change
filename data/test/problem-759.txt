," said Malfoy, the Latin words rolling off his tongue flawlessly that for a second Harry wondered if it would be weird to request Malfoy to speak Latin all the time. "It's the incantation one says to allow souls that have not yet departed to move freely between this world and beyond. The pink carnations," he pointed to the one in Harry's open palm, "are flowers associated with safe passage and also, traditionally, are given in condolence for the dead."
"As I said, the oaf's take on wizarding history. Currently, it's simply you and Abbott taking the class in our Year."
Malfoy was onto something, it seemed. He had doubted him, wondering if Malfoy was going a little crazy after everything that had happened to him since Sixth Year and was only humoring him. However, with his conversation with Fat Friar and a comment about Salazar's relationship with the other founders of Hogwarts during History of Magic class yesterday, Harry was growingly interested in finding out more. It would give him something to focus on, something to distract him from, well, his life.
"From what I've heard, he still does not have his original memory but he's as pretentious as he always was when his memory was intact. It's as if nothing changed save from his experience teaching DADA."
He turned around and spotted a platinum blond head at the Slytherin table. Malfoy was a Pureblood, probably the most Purebloods of Purebloods he had ever come across in his lifetime. He marched towards the Slytherin table, ignoring the whispers and murmurs as a Gryffindor headed to a Slytherin table.
Harry opened his mouth then shut it. He could not remember. He remembered falling asleep, yes, but before that, nothing. Did he take one drop? Or three? Perhaps he took two and a half! It was less than five, that was for sure.
Harry had secondary flashbacks of the Yule Ball and he willed himself to not physically shake from the horrible nightmares of it.
"Ah, my students. So, so glad you're all well and good. Now, before I begin and forget, I want all of you to write an essay for the next lesson on the possible ingredients of Weedosoros." There was a collective silence of confusion around the class. "Yes, yes, I know, there is not much known on this mysterious poison but that is the point of the assignment. It could come in your NEWTS next year."
Hermione once more raised her hand. But so did Padma and Professor chose her. "The sleeping potion is the most dangerous of sleeping potions because the drinker falls into a deep slumber that can last indefinitely. A known example is Ferdinand Luther who had drank the potion and fell asleep for 461 years."
Nott was the first to spot her fast walking towards the table and slowly the Eighth Year Slytherins turned their heads towards her.
"It's not common but yes it does exist. It's very dangerous magic, Harry; one that should not be taken lightly."
Malfoy made a move to walk back towards the Great Hall. "I assure you, Potter, I couldn't care less about that old oaf."
Hermione did not seem perturbed that Malfoy was on the same train thought as she. She looked pleased, almost proud at the fact. "What happened in 1368?"
"As much as this is delightful, some of us are trying to eat in peace," Bulstrode said, glaring at Harry.
"It has to be a specific moment," he repeated. "I really cannot explain further than that. Do you think, like, Salazar was able to create one?"
Professor Slughorn clapped his hands five times, grabbing the attention of the class. "There shall be some changes to the guestlist for my dinner party tonight." Seemingly out of thin air, he produced a long blue parchment that he dramatically waved in the air. "With Headmistress McGonagall's request that we encourage inter-House unity, I shall be adding new students onto my list and dropping others."
Take this because my friend doesn't like me, but is reading this anyway. When you read this J: "c'est la vie!". This is actually more parental fluff (be warned! it gets so much worse.) Again, sorry for the short chapters, but they will pick up the pace soon, hopefully. My best writing normally comes from writing Draco and Harry interacting, so please stick around to see that!
"I'm giving you the chance to explain yourself." He stated, crossing his arms in seething anger. Aidan shook his head frantically.
He choked on a swallowed breath. How long had he been drowning? He wasn't sure. It couldn't have been too long because it felt like forever, and whenever that happened, he lost only a few minutes at the most, lifespan wasting away. His next inhale was steadier and easier, though he was aware had just stopped breathing for a moment. Apparently auto-pilot wasn't going to work whilst his body still thought it was dead. His head felt like it was still underwater, heavy and slow, and he couldn't see clearly. Someone was calling him, and he liked the voice. It sounded like rich velvet and brandy, and it was edged with love, but the right kind. The kind that didn't want back. Unrequited, he thought.
"You can have as much of a go as you can at letting them out of the cages, we won't be done for a while. Direct them over to the entrance way ask them to wait there. Just- try not to let anything potentially dangerous out, ok?" Draco rose an eyebrow dubiously. Sam didn't reply, just shrugged and headed back to where the rest of the aurors were.
"Oh well, more for me then." She said, licking her lips lecherously in what was an attempt on a provocative action, which, if she weren't the Pansy Parkinson that Draco knew, would have been exceedingly attractive.
"Really professor? Your old drinks cabinet? A little unprofessional, if you ask me." Lupin, to his surprise, laughed.
"Blaise." He said back, smiling a little. Blaise sighed and the parchment rustled. He poked the top of his head outside of the quilt, eyes becoming visible.
"How are you feeling?" She asked, perfectly monotone. Civility, she said, is the key to success, but too much raw affection will be your downfall. She had wished more for a girl than a boy.
Welcome back! I'm sorry about the general disorganisation of this (and the brief neglect), it hurts me to, you know. (As my friend has said and been immortalised on my quote wall, 'I live under a blanket of obliviousness.'), but I'm choosing to blame my brother for this.
"I think you've gotten better," She said, looking at him through the mirror that Draco recognised to be one of his own, something he had on his bedside table a few years back that had suddenly disappeared. She pretended not to notice his scathing glare.
"What's this now?" He asked predatorially, holding the picture at such an angle that Draco and Narcissa might too be able to see it. It was Draco's elected favourite picture of him and Harry, again, taken by Lily. They were standing on an icing rink in Somerset, faces so close that a hair of movement might've made them kissing, gazing into one an others eyes and smiling. Lucius saw the small frown that creased Draco's brow. He dropped the picture, shattering it. "I was told that this flat was owned by a Mr. Harry Potter, but, of course, that's not you, is it? It's the boy in the picture, or so I would hazard a guess."
He let himself sink into the serenity of it all. Let the white consume him as it had done before. Peace. Calm. He sighed gently against them and didn’t even feel the crack in his head as he fell to the floor.
An image came to him, a stormy day and a dead face. He didn't even know whose face it was. His footing was even less sure of itself now, and he slipped on hard stone, falling to the earth in a loud snap.
"What's his name?" Lupin asked, rubbing his fingers together in an attempt to make Grey approach him, a soft smile on his face.
Very sorry at the lateness of this fic, I have not had ONE fucking lie in all week, becuase this is the busiest I've been in ages, and my brother is having a few problems, so please do bear with me. (currently I am writing this at eleven thirty having gotten three hours of sleep. Rip my non-existent mental health.)
"Draco darling, you could at least tuck my shirt back in again." He said haughtily as the large wooden door swung open to reveal the rest of the year strewn around the room, all of them looking up as they entered. Draco raised an eyebrow at them and continued into the library with Blaise and Pansy at his side.
"What have you got for us Pans?" Draco asked, angling head so his chin has up, tilted to the side slightly and grinned at her in a not quite malicious look. Pansy giggled and paused for dramatic effect.
"Malfoy." A voice said from the other side of the room. It was the Weasel, glaring at him from the safety of bed.
"Well then. I've an hour before lunch, so would it be agreeable for me to be allowed to unpack in my dorm?" Draco drawled, posh and without a trace of the fact he had just told someone something he was never supposed to say, not to anyone under 'pain of death'. Fat chance he'd be offed though with Lucius in Azkaban. Looked like offing himself was something he had to himself, not that he particularly minded. Things happen. He had an image of the dorm room he would be in; he was aware that the eight years got their own common room and dorms. He supposed it would be quite nice, just him and Blaise in a small room at the top of some tower. The jokes they could make.
"I'm not a child darling, I can handle myself." Blaise muttered something under his breath that sounded a lot like 'of course you do'. "Thank you for the offer." He hastened to add, smiling gently and making for the door, letting a hand run across the length of Blaise's shoulders as he passed.
His chest heaved with each step, quivering breaths not quite powering through his adrenaline. The cold stung, some part of him thought, as his fingers grazed the surface and he began to wade more than walk. Everything started to calm down. It was still loud, and the sound overpowered his ears, but now it was just the pound of rain against the lake. The screaming became shallower, lighter till it was no longer there, and the weight on his chest seemed to ease up and let him breath easier. His father was no longer telling him to beg for his life in English, a language he barely understood. The hot pain in his arm slowed and soothed to a cold numbness, and his clouded head seemed to flood with clear serenity.
Welcome back! I shall be a lot less busy now, so my time for writing shall definitely increase, and I'll be able to get a lot more of this out to you before my school starts again next week. Online learning, here I come. (I hate my life)
It was always so far when he reached for it, but right there when he was... elsewhere. It felt like serenity here, in his cell. The cold, numbness of it all. Draco wanted to sink into it, to let it rescue him from the mar of scratches across his arms, to let it save him from everyone. In this cell, it felt like dying and Draco was perfectly aware that that was why they had put him in it. They wanted to starve him of everything, break him down till he was nothing but a shell. Something shifted inside of him, moaning in supressed pain. Draco blinked blearily at the wall.
"Quite enjoyable. I really admire it, it's very pretty." He said after a moment of consideration. "The plants really do add atmosphere, and they work well with the high ceilings and the windows." Pansy nodded, murmuring quietly.
"I can't say that I agree Draco," She eventually said, turning her head to meet Draco's eyes. "But I'll never stop loving you darling. My offer still stands." Draco's hands covered his face, feathering over it gently.
"Of course I do. Did you really think that me relinquishing him was really an option in the debate?" He dragged out the 'really' to make his point. Sam laughed again. Since he was doing it so often, it started to unnerve Draco. "Anyway, when am I being allowed the liberty to leave? It really is fucking awful here."
"He's going to be my guard dog. Who's going to come after me now that I have a kelpie protecting me? We've already agreed on it and I've promised him rather a large lake in the manor grounds at home. He would of course be eating animals and not humans, I'll see to it." He explained it all as if he were describing to the board at home why they should be having afternoon tea instead of a full meal; breezy and with the confidence that said: 'I don't need your confirmation, I've decided it all already.' Sam looked unperturbed.
They had gone to Russia. Lucius had deals that needed to be signed, and Narcissa accompanied him, because she had wanted to see Russia, see its wonder. One night, Lucius had slipped out and found that same brothel in which Nikolai had resided. The same brothel he had visited six years previously.
"She's sharing with Hermione and a few other Gryffindor girls. They won't give her trouble, I mad sure of it in the configurations."
The sound of stone steps reverberated around the walls as he climbed them, gradually getting higher and higher till he could see more, hear the sound of the wind and the rain. He reached the top, face to face with a wooden door, the door of his dreams. Pushing it open revealed the room, their secret room to be almost exactly how they had left it. It smelt less of him now, more of the faint aroma of a person. He shut the door without looking at it, fixated on the window and what lay below it. He sat gracefully on the window seat where he could hear the rain more clearly now, more deafening, but in a familiar, safe way, one that he revelled in. He had barely opened his book when the door creaked open. He didn't turn around, just looked up at the window, hands holding the book going slack.
"Don't you have things to be doing?" Grey asked him, voice husky from sleep as Draco angled himself across the warm expanse of skin that was Grey's chest. He recieved no answer to his question, only a cat like glare and arms wrapping themselves around his body.
Half of the carefully placed items in the flat were missing. He ran to the bedroom door, bursting through it, half ready to explain everything to Harry if he were only there. Tears spilled from his eyes weakly. He wasn't there. He stormed the kitchen next. Lying on the kitchen counter was a note, a buisness card, and a ring.
'Did you see Malfoy's face? Bloody brilliant,' Weasley said, laughing along with Finnigan who mimicked a look of sudden surprise, at his empty hand, as if to wonder why his wand was not there. Draco felt his cheeks flush with heat. Granger at least rolled her eyes clearly not amused by them, but it made his day noticing that Aria hadn't laughed.
"Old pure-blooded custom. Used - well it doesn't matter when. But basically, I can't lie to you, have to protect you and you're protected from most spells except one. Especially within the Manor and its grounds. I have to prove myself worthy due to the bracelets."
'I love you too,' came her soft reply, Aria was blushing slightly as she spoke, 'Yes I'll bond with you.'
It had been when she neared the Slytherin Common Room that Crabbe and Goyle had been attacked. Draco still had prefect duties to attend to and Ophelia Snape had taken the duty away from Parkinson. No wonder her old roommates had decided to attack them then.
"So we've got to kill each other in the end," Aria said thoughtfully. "Good thing, I'm still working on that."
Draco shook his head at the letter, of course, she wouldn't want to face a crowd. He should have realised that ... after learning about her nightmares. He smiled slightly to himself ...as he read the letter again, the letter that had come just four days ago; the longest letter he had received so far from Aria. She had been much more open with him since the ball ... and he had known something had upset her - he had felt her magic after all, though he was sure it was more than a mere headache - it had been the look his mother had gave him before she left, that had been the reason he didn't question Aria further. Aria's letter had not been the only one he had received ... with the return to Hogwarts fast approaching ... several of his fellow housemates that had chosen to return also had got in touch with him. He figured as Aria did not want to step into Diagon, that he might as well meet up with a few of his fellow housemates.
"I've been needing to speak with you," Aria said. "Well to ask you really. Because from someone wanting and failing miserably at it, why would someone go from trying to kill me to being overprotective of me? It doesn't make any sense. And even Draco says he has become obsessed with my protection."
Fleur had placed down the picture in front of Aria, Ginny and Hermione both leaned over to look also. The picture was definitely the two of them - Draco and Aria - sitting together in close proximity like they were locked in an intimate moment.
Aria smiled, feeling her cheeks heat up a bit, watching as Epsilon, who had clearly had enough attention now, combing herself back into perfection. 'It came to me ... it just, came to me.' And Aria was glad that for once; Hermione clearly did not know or realise everything. It wasn't that hard to figure out where the name had come from - not if one recalled Astronomy. But in Aria's defense, Epsilon did act a bit like him, and with her grey fur, Epsilon reminded Aria of him too.
Then he had an idea. He let get of Grey's head and ran to the awkwardly set up stall behind it, leaning over to grab something that really ought to be there. His hands found the fabric, and he grasped it, bringing it up to where he could see it. A bridle. A magically altered bridle. Grey sneered at it as well as it could whilst being a horse.
*The Russian is supposed to say 'I wish I had died instead', but please don't quote me on this as I have not asked the translation from my Russian friend like I normally do
"No I- I've just never heard you say it." Narcissa looked all but defeated. It wasn't as though Draco was opposed to liking women, he just never really had the chance. Unbeknownst to his parents, he had been raised amongst lesbians.
"You sure I can't say anything stupid?" Harry whispered into Draco's lips. Draco pushed into him gently with long delicate fingers that wove themselves through Harry's thick hair, the other hand against the hard of his chest.
"Have you heard anything from father?" He asked, head angled down at his food, eyes angled up at Narcissa who went stiff as a board at the mention.
Thank you again for reading, and please do leave a comment if there's anything you particularly liked/disliked, or if you just want to say hi, they really mean so much to me!
"You can drop me here, thank you mother. I'll call you a bit later, alright?" Narcissa turned to look at him, a small frown creasing her forehead.
He grasped his wand and inspected it as he walked down the stairs, admiring the opal and moonstone. Admiring its core. Humming pretty tunes under his breath proved to be a nicer distraction than most to the thoughts that plagued his mind, winding melodies as he strode through the newly empty halls.
"Come along, Draco." He called without turning around, like he knew Draco would follow him. As Draco began to uncurl himself, Lucius left the room through a large door angled at the back of the large entrance hall. He could still hear Narcissa's quiet sobs from where she lay, draped gracefully across the floor, face buried into the crook of her elbow. Draco's cheeks were wet with frightened tears, but he wiped them away and ran as gracefully as he could towards his father's disappearing footsteps.
Then it had broken, but not gradually. It was like a beautiful crystal glass you had on display that someone accidently knocked. Aidan watched it tumble in slow motion to the floor, watched it shatter into a million pieces without being able to lift even a finger against it.
It was nice enough, really. The cooking, that was. They made a silent agreement to not eat in the dining room, and Draco was glad for it, and could tell Narcissa was too. Too many bad memories, moments neither of them wanted to relive if they could avoid it.
A spluttering choke. Grey withdrew quickly. Draco's eyes were opened wide, pupils dilated, and he seemed to be panicking, clutching  at his throat with an arm that shouldn't work. He was shivering violently, and Grey had the uncomfortable feeling that it wasn't because he had been found at midnight in a lake, in the bleak midst of September.
It wasn't had to convince Lucius to let them out. Narcissa's powers of persuasion had never looked so good, and Draco wasn't sure if he'd ever properly appreciated it, the way she could control him, talk around him.
"Well, what do you want to know? I'll answer selectively to direct questions, hopefully aimed at how good I look dressed like this." Lupin looked like he was trying really hard not to sigh.
"Draco," He said, sighing again. "Please talk to me." Draco went deadly still, not even shaking, just watching Blasie with his venomous grey eyes that screamed 'don't finish that thought'. Both of them knew Draco wasn't going to move, to say anything until Blaise either played it off or made a move. It was a stalemate, and they both knew it. Neither of them made the first move, and in the recess of his psyche, Draco knew he was to much of a coward to make it when it was against Blaise. "I know," He sighed, "I know you're depressed. You hide it well, but we're your best friends." He looked at Draco with such soft eyes that they almost didn't suit his face.
"It doesn't matter too much, besides, mother is going to be back in a few days, and we can't do this when she's here." Draco's voice was also heavy from sleep, but in a way that was velvety and melodic, almost like his singing voice.
He hadn't been dragged kicking and screaming to the manor, but he certainly wasn't here on intended buisness. Draco treated it in his own mind like his own kidnapping. He had been kidnapped, once or twice, roughed up little and ransomed back to his parents. They never paid the money because, of course, they had raised Draco to be a fighter, to be a winner, and if he couldn't even get himself out of a small kidnapping situation, what kind of person would he even grow up to be?
"Lucius was just mentioning how much he loved both of us." Draco could have expected as much. He nodded, and it was the most serious topic that approached them all night.
There was someone standing over him, he realised, but he was much to wrapped up in the melodrama of dying that he payed them no heed. That was, until, he realised he was in a fucking bath. Who the fuck put someone who was drowning in a bath? There were a few things he was only just presently aware of, and the fact that it had been a lake and not a bath he had almost drowned in was, bizarrely, one of them.
"Well, it would be inappropriate for us to stay at a prisoners household," The sour looking woman said, sniffing as though both of them were beneath her. Narcissa raised an eyebrow, drawing herself up.
"Draco, thank you," She replied, holding him perhaps a little tighter and a little longer than was necessary for impressions. She looked to Draco no worse for wear than before the war, but she never was one to show things. His mother was incredibly good at powering through things without letting seemingly anything change her mood or graces, a trait that he wished she really didn't have. "I trust you have been keeping well?"
'Oh there's a lot you don't know about me, Dragon,' Aria winked at him, causing a little heat to rise in his cheeks, the next words were out of her mouth before she could stop them, 'study with me.'
She burst out of the classroom, Malfoy calling after her, shouting her name, asking her to stop, telling her once again that he thought she knew. Aria ignored him. She felt completely foolish. And for the first time, during her stay at school, she actually wanted to get the hell away from Hogwarts.
'My - the Mark - I don't know what to tell them,' he said, implying his head to the direction Emily and Dudley. 'Then what if someone from the wizarding community sees it - it could cause so much trouble.'
It was not her fault his cousin; Cygnus helped her to her feet before Draco could. Narcissa had been kind enough - escorted her from the room so she could clean herself up. And it was not her fault that said cousin, had not left her alone all night ... not her fault that Cygnus stopped her from tripping over her own feet.
It was with reluctance and Draco knew it but she gave in, silently handing him the towel she had summoned moments before.
Draco paled, true he had been struggling with his transformation, but to tell Aria she would not ... when the highest honour a Veela had to gift was their transformation ... his hands fisted. He knew something had been said to her ... though he had not heard what had been said.
'Wait a minute, you said, share with other houses - you mean Slytherins?' Ron said, 'We have to share with Slytherins? - I might not go back.'
'Aria, you will not be in the wrong - no one will. The public does not know that this engagement is just for the year, for they did not need to know that. If you go ahead or if you decide not to, that is up to both you and Draco alone.' Narcissa paused, 'the reason why we wanted to make the announcement was to protect you - both of you - as you are the Saviour and Draco a former Death Eater -'
Aria laughed childishly again, beaming at him, as he gathered her his arms. Her eyes sparkled with delight, as he led her in a slow dance, and not once did she purposely step on his feet.
'Never again!' Aria replied exasperated, 'I never knew babysitting a baby would be so much trouble - never again I tell you!'
Aria hoped that if she took away the focus upon her recent row with Ron, and focused upon how helpful Ginny and Hermione had been - Ron might just not say anything.
'Yeah ... it can get like that sometimes.' Aria said, 'It still has the ability to surprise and amaze me.'
'First off Marge is not my aunt,' Aria said, 'She's Vernon's sister, which makes her Dudley's aunt, not mine. But that didn't give you the right to get involved. I could have handled it.'
'I may not like you,' Granger said after a lengthy pause, 'but I will be civil to you for Aria's sake.'
'Yes well-' Mrs Weasley muttered into the silence. Mrs Weasley had taken the attitude she had about not saying bad things about the Dursleys in front of Aria and applied it to the Malfoy's. 'that hardly matters now. It's happened everyone will just have to get used to it.'
His fingers intertwined themselves further into her hair until he was stroking her head. Until she was subconsciously leaning into his touch, sighing sleepily. Happily. He had never seen her looking this at ease. This content in his presence before. She looked so young as she slept, her features relaxed and settled.
Aria glanced down towards her sleeve, hidden underneath it was the bracelet Draco placed upon her during her capture, the very bracelet that had given her a sense of freedom, the very bracelet that bound them together. Bound them in the ancient ways of magic.
'You know -' Aria said softly as they danced together, 'If you keep doing things like this ... I'm going to have no choice but to forgive you.'
Well, Aria supposed he had a point there, and she held the piercing gaze of Ron's blue eyes. Normally just hearing Draco's surname would explain everything.
'If you're the joker of your class or house,' Aria said, and Finnigan to a large applause from the Gryffindors made his way over to the middle of the hall, doing a little bow as he entered the square - he was joined by several others. Aria went through several more questions if they had a favourite class - and what lesson was it, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Charms, Potions. To if they were religious. If they owned or had owned owl, and she did the same with other pets allowed at Hogwarts. Longbottom did not look best pleased as he entered the center square when she called out for people who owned or had owned a toad. If they ever had an argument with a friend. If they were in a relationship.
'Yes, I know.' Aria answered simply, it was all that it required, they were after all talking about the same person. A person that she now actually knew, not the stuck-up idiot that thought he owned the ground he walked on ... well, Draco still did walk like that - but Aria tended to roll her eyes when it happened.
'I think I need to get myself checked over,' Aria said to Mrs Weasley as she refused the small plate of food when she had finally been able to drag herself down the stairs into the small kitchen. Her head pounding slightly and felt like it was spinning. 'I feel sick...'
There was a soft knock. Aria was puzzled, no one had knocked on this door before. Wand in hand in case she had to disarm the person at the door, Aria opened it slowly. To find an awkward-looking Draco Malfoy.
'Will you walk me down the aisle?' Ron blinked at her, 'I'd love you to do so ... and you know full damn well it will bug the hell out of Draco.'
'Perhaps they thought they did not need to.' Draco surmised, placing down the towel, he picked up the hairbrush from the unit instead and paused. 'I did wonder why you choose not to spend Christmas with them.'
'Last time I left alone grandmother, things were said ...' Draco replied, 'So it is not Aria disappearing, that I am concerned about.'
The shout from the distance made Aria turn her head away bashfully. Aria's cousin sure had some timing - just a few more moments - just a few more seconds - and he would have kissed her. Draco was slightly disappointed - the first time in weeks he'd been left alone with her and he let the moment slip out from the palm of his hands. But it begged the question - would Aria welcome his advances if he had kissed her? He hadn't even given her any courting gifts yet! And the bracelet that glittered from her wrist did not count. He was going to have to change that and soon - well as soon as they got back to England, luckily he only had a few more days to wait.
'You really need to stop saying that, or I'm going to take you The Den regardless of what my mother or Weasley's mother might think of it.' Draco said firmly.
'So I suggest this,' Mrs Malfoy's eyes met her own. 'A year. You will give Draco a year in which, he will be allowed to court you, to woo you,' Well that was better than Aria's first option. 'If the courtship goes well,' she said simply, 'you will marry, and if not then you are free to do what you want.'
'Of course, it's about you,' another voice said. Pansy slid into the space next to Draco. 'You are talking about Potter ignoring you - right? Because this time, I can't say I blame the girl.'
'We'll arrange it for the weekend after then Aria,' his mother said, 'normally your family would be invited to join us but Muggles have never-'
The light from the wand distinguished. For a moment Aria thought Draco had it or a least a strong enough memory for a shield to form.
"I hear that you were attacked on your first night here." Voldemort said, "I wish for you to tell me what happened."
'And you live to tell the tale,' Aria laughed, 'I can't believe you - Dudley you went up against an of age wizard, you know that right?'
'So, up until I've asked pretty natural questions - your gender, if you like Quidditch, what team you support, if you have siblings or not, and each time different houses have stepped into the center square ... have you noticed that different Hogwarts houses members have been in the middle, so, let's see what happens when we get a bit more personal with the questions.' Aria paused looking around, 'Enter the center square if the first time you ever heard of Hogwarts and magic was when you received your acceptance letter.'
Aria followed Draco, to the table but she couldn't stand the thought of food, she felt rather sick to her stomach.
'Potter hasn't spoken to you?' Blaise said, his eyebrow arching, 'Well I don't know why that surprises me - given what happened -'
Eternal love ... pure eternal love. The runes on her bracelet were not just that of protection but of the promises of everything he wanted to give her. Her heartfelt like it was going to burst and despite the embarrassment, Draco had caused her to feel, she couldn't find it within herself to be angry with him. Aria gulped as her eyes searched for the place Draco had been sitting in across the hall, until - she spotted him, Draco had been watching her, had been watching her reaction. Aria forgot everything, she forgot the hundreds of people were in the hall, she didn't listen to the whispers going on around her. Aria got to her feet, they carried her without thinking, without stopping ... the Slytherin table was steps away, Draco Malfoy looking at her ... several more steps and stormy grey eyes met hers, she sat in the empty place next to him. Aria did the only thing she could think of, she kissed him. The catcalls brought her attention back to reality and she tried to hide her face in her hands, Draco chuckled deeply as he pulled her hands away from her face.
This was even better than her first option like Draco Malfoy could woo her! It was a win-win. And Mrs Malfoy wouldn't be able to call in her debt again.
'So am I forgiven completely?' Draco smirked, eyebrows raised, looking completely pleased with himself.
Aria often wondered what love was, not the love of friendship, but actual love. She couldn't remember her parents, Sirius had died before she had the chance to really know him. Aria knew that actual love existed, she saw it every time Mr Weasley and Mrs Weasley looked at each other, she saw it in the photographs of her parents. Aria knew she loved her godson, but to love another person beyond the point of friendship? She didn't know much about that type of love. Funny how she had been willing enough to die to protect her friends, and that had protected them in the last moments of the final battle, but yet she knew nothing about it. There was no doubt that Aria loved the protectiveness of Draco's magic, but loving his magic was not the same as being in love with Draco Malfoy, was it?
'It's gone all around the school, and it wasn't hard to figure out who - well which eighth-year, blond-haired, stuck up, Death Eater, idiot they were talking about - not with how I saw someone hex you earlier -'
'I can understand why your mother proposed it at least now,' Aria said. 'Even if I'm not ready to forgive you for not telling me or explaining yourselves.' she sighed once more, 'So what happens now - what happens if we don't work out? The agreement was for a year - and if - as our magic is -'
'Today I want to honour those who gave, time and time again to the cause, please join me in a two minutes silence, and honour the fifty who to unfortunate circumstance cannot be here with us this day.'
The second part had been spoken louder. Someone was listening in. Aria gathered that much. She opened the door and let Draco into her room.
"Come." Voldemort gestured her forward. Aria took tentative steps forward until she was gestured to stop. This would be her last test in front of Voldemort before returning come the Christmas holidays.
'So as neither of us are about to fall asleep anytime soon,' Draco said, 'what should we talk about?'
Draco spotted Weasley and Granger approaching from the distance, of course, they would know where to find Aria. She too had noticed them.
'I'll be fine as soon as this stupid lesson is over,' Draco replied hotly, 'I hate Defence Against the Dark Arts.'
Aria blinked, she was pretty sure she was giving off the impression of a deranged fish, with how she was opening and shutting her mouth. And she was pretty sure that she was caught in some kind of daydream, as Draco Malfoy would never - never - apologise, and neither would he call himself several words under the sun for being a jerk.
It was not her fault that the Floo Network just hated her. No matter how many times she had used it now ... she'd always come out - well fall out - covered in soot.
'How sweet of you to visit Dudders,' the woman said, as he followed them into a small sitting room, he heard the door close behind them
'Now - now you mention it - something odd did happen -' Aria mumbled, 'I woke from a nightmare - and Dudley and Draco were in the room- it had been Draco that had woken me up - and - I - I felt - safe!'
Draco glanced in his wife's direction, how in Merlin's name had she known who the girl standing in front of them was, as far as he was aware they had never had a chance to meet before, and even Draco had been surprised to be finally introduced to the girl his son had been complaining about for years.
Aria rolled her eyes, no doubt she had just offended some type of Veela custom by asking another Veela what the runes meant. She wasn't sure ... well actually she was pretty sure why she wanted to know the meaning behind them, she disliked not knowing things after all. She just wanted to know what Draco was withholding.
'If you want to, that is,' Draco found himself adding as Aria's head and eyes had dropped to the table, he found himself approaching the table and taking the seat opposite hers, but he dared not reach out to touch her. 'It will help with your magical withdrawal -'
There was a hesitant shuffle as the boys, stepped forward going from their respective houses to the center square, and each square re-sized, the white square grows larger and the four houses squares grew smaller, once all the boys were in the middle, the magically white line turned green.
'I got a little gift for you,' Draco said, about a month after they had left Hogwarts. Aria had been a little quiet, but she seemed happy enough.
Aria's eyes snapped shut at the shout, her face creasing around her nose. It was as though she had been trying to avoid something. And it was making less and less sense to Draco with each passing moment. Draco heard the sound of footsteps and Dudley came into view.
If they were watching, wherever they were, both Godric and Salazar could see themselves in both Harry and Malfoy, and wherever they were, they knew their history was about to be written right.
"Harry, my boy," Professor Binns said with utmost urgency, "you must find a Pureblood wizard or witch as soon as possible and bring them here before it's too late for me."
"Me, Professor," Malfoy spoke coolly and his Slytherin friends all turned to him, varying degrees of shock and surprise, apart from Blaise who was chuckling silently.
Harry rolled his eyes at Blaise. "She also said a giant monkey will be in the Great Hall on Sunday at 5 o'clock and yet nothing of the sort has ever happened."
Malfoy frowned. "He's already dead? How can the dead die? Twice I might add?" Harry took a deep breath and in under 20 seconds explained what had transpired after his lesson. "He's going to the other side!"
"Before I forget, this weekend, or before our Thursday class next week, head to Hogsmead to buy several ingredients that you shall be needing for our Potions lessons. They are Sloth brain, Valerian root, Knotgrass, Peppermint, and Shrivelfig. Did you get that? Shrivelfig. We shall be brewing the Elixir to Induce Euphoria. Don't forget, my students. We want to create something amusing."
"You don't need a good reason, Malfoy. Simply being friends is all it takes to show up for those that matter to you."
"Do you remember the Mirror of Erised?" Hermione asked, taking a moment's break from her assignment. The three men nodded at her. "Cartomancy, or simply card reading, has the same effect that the Mirror has on one's magic."
"Not mine, I'm afraid. You know how to use a portkey, I'm assuming?" Draco gave him a clear look, but otherwise did not answer. The silence was short but awkward. Draco looked at Grey who effectively told him that it was his fault. Draco did not disagree with this assessment.
"Draco!" Pansy said loudly. "He's been rude to me, and now you're inviting him out to get plastered with us? The travesty. The betrayal." She moaned, slumping against him, back of her hand against her forehead in a sort of swoon.
"This is Draco," He said, arm curling around Draco's shoulders and thrusting him forward. He stumbled slightly, and with his head angled down, pupils up, he met Narcissa's gaze. He still remembered it. Whereas Lucius' had been unbridled joy, hers was unbridled fury. Her fists clutched at her sides. Draco wanted to run away. Lucius didn't need to finish his sentence; Narcissa knew exactly what was going on. "He's fixed everything for us. He's the perfect heir, and he's mine. There's only a little problem involving his blood, but other than that, don't you think he's wonderful?" The tone had been the expressive love that was often the type children yearned for, but all Draco could focus on was the anger in Narcissa's eyes as she watched him.
"You absolute dick, Draco Malfoy. Where are our letters?" She asked haughtily, folding her arms and glaring him down, one eyebrow raised ever so slightly. Blaise grinned at him, raising his own glass of red wine to his lips.
It ought to have been a Saturday, Draco thought to himself whilst gathering his limbs into a solid ball on the bed. His book wasn't in there with him, and so he searched his bedside table, pulling the silk gently back to reveal slithers of the room, bathed in the weak soft light of the early morning. It was a pretty room, especially so in the morning light that dappled it ever so, like a clearing in the wood with weeping trees that obscured the sun's gaze.
The world span. Draco curled in on himself, clutching at his throat and gasping. His head hurt. His mouth tasted metallic, it tasted like blood. The rain poured on, and so did his stream of conscious. He switched from a feverish murmuring of English to the rambling, screaming syllables of Russian, but the meaning was always the same.
"Morning. How's that hangover treating you, Blaise darling?" Pansy asked, examining her nails with supreme curiosity from one of the leather armchairs that decorated the common room.
"Ok love, I promise the next time I get out of prison I'll spend those first three minutes writing you a letter." He assures her, gathering some semblance of food as Blaise eyed him. Draco winked back. Pansy let out an over exaggerated sigh.
"Did you really think Pansy didn't know too? We've known for a while we just," He broke of, pulling himself up more, rubbing his hand over his face. "We just never mentioned it. We thought you'd tell us." Draco withdrew his leg silently and in long, snake like motions. Blaise let it go easily. He looked at Draco. "You're like a dancer when you move like that."
"A trap!" Someone called out, and soon it was a flurry of yelling at how it was a bad idea to bring him along, and that he should probably be murdered. Draco sighed. People were so vanilla with their insults nowadays. He'd heard all of them at least ten times before. He had to admit though, it was exceedingly weird that on the day of his release he would be taken by aurors to 'bust a black market'. Something had to be up. Slurs were hurled at him, but he stood, chin thrust out in disdain.
Breakfast was an entirely uneventful ordeal, really. He walked out with Blaise after a good hour in bed to meet Pansy, who had dressed for a fashion show. (Draco wasn't even going to pretend that he and Blaise hadn't done the same.)
"Thanks." Grey said from his relaxed position on the foot stool. Draco was quite certain he had near fallen asleep.
"I'll be quite fine, Draco. Having you here was company enough, and of course you'll be home for the Christmas holidays." She said, smoothing his hair down. He wasn't wearing general wizarding clothing, rather he was wearing a long overcoat, a shirt that had a few too many buttons undone and dark trousers. A Slytherin scarf hung heavy around his neck, and the weight of many snake insignia rings adorned his fingers. An unseen bandage covered the entirety of his left forearm. "You look beautiful, as always." She always used rather more feminine compliments, which Draco supposed was a mix of her desire for him to have been a girl, and the, well, beauty of his veela features.
"Very sorry sir, but I have just been made aware of something. I belive you visited her six years ago?" Lucius nodded, with not quite eagerness. The girl nodded back. "We believe that you have a son. Nikolai." And that was the moment that Draco Malfoy's life went to hell.
The breakfast he made was basic but nice, and he had told Grey that if he wanted to stick the illusion of a normal diet, he could go and hunt for a stag or something. He refused, and watched Draco eat instead, which was weird in an of itself, but Draco decided he could let that one go. He doubted he could have kept it together in the dining room without someone constantly there. Grey's presence, though he would deny it, was a balm to his inevitable loneliness and misgivings. Grey kept him steady.
It was Grey, after some profound moment of insanity, he discerned. His throat and lungs burnt, but he was at no danger of dying anymore (at least from drowning, he bitterly thought)
Grey never was any good at healing magic. He had never been taught. He had seen someone rescued from his loose morals, though, but once.
"Well, I suppose it's not so bad. Most of the time they pretend I don't exist, but it doesn't bother me." She sighed, pouting slightly. Only someone who actually knew Pansy would have seen how upset she really was. Draco put  an arm around her shoulder and squeezed.
"Is there a problem, miss?" It was an annoyed smile, now. The girl, to her credit, had the decency to look  embarrassed.
"I really hope you understand the medical implications of that." Harry mutters and heads back to bed. Incredible. Ron to leaves without much of a fuss to his own bed, huffing something under his breath that may be some very creative insults. Draco's almost impressed. He doesn't particularly want to face Blaise right now, but then again, he doesn't really want to face anyone, so who is his inner subconscious to judge? All he knew was that tomorrow's session with Lupin was probably going to sting.
"Fine. Do as you please, it's round the back of the manor. I trust you can find it?" Grey did not respond, but from where Draco stood looking over the manor grounds beyond the window, he heard the not so subtle shuffling of feet, the creaking of his carved wooden door, and then the click of the its close. He let out a breath into the empty space, one that seemed to echo around the room without the comfort of people to distil it.
She escorted him back to the house where they were promptly fussed over by the servants and slighted by Lucius who thought it was rather undignified to come back in such states. Draco lay on the bed, head lolling dangerously close to sleep. A knock on his parlour door stirred him from his not quite slumber.
He ignored the knock. He seated himself in kitchen, becuase in the inexplicable way that all drugs seemed to work for him, he wanted to see the damage. To see the blood. Any blood, really. He wasn't particularly fussed. Unwrapping the bandages seemed only to satisfy himself, because with the peeling of the white came the dripping of the red.
you on about? We share a room, Weasel, get over yourself." Was his curt response, and a snort of laughter came from Blaise's bed. Weasley gave him such a filthy look that it was almost comical. Harry reached a hand out of his own curtains (this surprised Draco, because normally he slept like the dead)
"Who else is in the room?" He asked after a moment of deliberation and calculations. He really didn't like where they were getting him.
"Mm, and we've had to put up with this far longer than you have." Pansy muttered, slapping her hand down a little on his knee. They had managed to somehow smuggle the empty bottles back with them, because Blaise wanted to keep the bottles, not just vanish them. The glass clinked as he shifted to kiss Draco in the chair. Sounds of murmuring and hushed insults drifted through to them, and they all laughed, Draco grinning into Blaise's lips, pulling apart to look mock-haughtily down the small line of shelves that separated them from the rest of the year.
And so Draco explained as eloquently as he could on the edge of a panic. He told her about the two men visiting them in the middle of the night as they celebrated, told her about how when he woke up, Harry had already packed and left. How he spent the next week barely existing in the flat. He told her, eventually, about getting high and watching his blood pour. About being taken by his parents. The more modest version, of course. She didn't need to know that Lucius Malfoy was that vile. Only the basics.
The night was a cruel one as he stumbled into it. The stars bled into the swirl of blacks and greys, midnight blues blotted out by the heavy clouds that littered the sky. It was loud. So very loud. It was wet as well, and Draco could no longer tell what was blood and what was rain and mud. He wasn't crying, not quite, but he was gasping and screaming, eyes wide, and he had no idea where he was going, why he was going there.
"You all just have no appreciation for humour. Right, then, are we leaving this alone, or am I going to have to wipe some memories?" Ron blanches, as if he really would do it, and Harry rolls his eyes.
Narcissa came forward gracefully and smiling, a greeting such as, 'I hadn't expected you back so early!' on the tip of her lips. Then she saw Draco behind the tactical retreat of Lucius' legs. Draco was sure that Lucius would have been smiling. She stopped short and gave Lucius a searching look that only nobles seemed to pull off: hands folded slightly in front of her and a raised chin that was only ever so slightly cocked. Draco had mastered that look, but added a glare to erase subtlety.
"No- but-" Grey said, clearly at a loss for comprehensible words. "You can't be, they're dead-" Draco rolled his eyes.
"Did you want to sit down so that we can talk about this?" Lupin offered, pretending that Draco had not mentioned his 'lover' in a rather odd jest. Spook. That was the words. He hated that word, the inferences you could get, the notion that he was simply an animal that was to be danced around. He wanted to growl again, but he'd just end up setting himself off. He took the chair, seating himself on it as hostile as possible, as if to protect himself from any invasive questions. Once he made sure that Draco was 'happily' seated, he began. "So your father, then. I don't want to push you, but everything you say is useful." And to this, Draco could find only one response in his head, a response that happened to be 'suck my ass'. He did not voice his opinion.
He stooped down and gathered Draco in his arms, carrying him bridal style, breaking into a run towards the house, constantly glancing down to check if his expression had changed from mystically vacant to anything that would reveal he was alive. His chest wasn't moving.
"Why?" She asked, and suddenly he had her hand on his shoulder, the other on his cheek. He thought of Narcissa, thought of the way she only showed affection that he craved when Draco talked about killing himself, which is somehow how the following sentence fell out of his mouth.
Grey, he had also decided, needed a room and clothes, but he was so far unable to obtain either. He left the bathroom with a sigh and his own clothes to let Grey dry himself and change. There were so far plenty of drying charms, but Draco was sure that Grey would weasel his way put of it and beg for Draco to dry his hair. Well, beg was a strong word, but Draco was sure he would end up seated somewhere in his own parlour combing through Grey's long hair.
"It's Grey, and I ought not to do that if I were you." He said, eyeing Grey as if to say 'go for your life.'.
"Draco." She said. Her voice was even as ever, and she met his gaze steadily. There was no waver in her voice, but he could tell she was deeply disturbed.
The door to the bathroom opened revealing one of Draco's favourite rooms. There was a large built in marble tub attached to the sides of the wall, the sides rather long so that one could sit on them, the back wall not a wall at all, rather it was panes of green enchanted glass so that you could not see in, but you could see out, and so that creatures roamed across them. It was the only room in the house that was not old fashioned, and it was the only room that did not mar his mind with memories that lurked in the shadows.
Ah, he thought to himself as the previous night's events came back to him in a haze of alcohol. Drunk sex was something he knew very well, despite his insistence that it would not happen again. He always got to this point, but it was fine. He hated himself enough to let it happen, so it didn't matter all that much.
He sighed into the air, but it came out as a strangled moan of pain. He wanted to see the moon, see the stars, but all he could see were the overcast clouds, the hard lashing of the rain that he wanted to shield his eyes against, but his energy was sapped.
"His name's Grey? Did you name him?" Draco watched the expression on Grey's face, but after seeing it not be affected, he decided that Grey was in fact, male.
Hands went to his throat, and he almost resisted before realising that they were his hands. He coughed and choked, felt his stream of thought coming back. He was dying, some part of him thought, but a conflicting part told him that, no he wasn't, he was coming back to life.
"God no. Had a fucking fit when I came home for the first time, and besides, the Blacks aren't veelas." Lupin could see it, see it clearly. He was avoiding asking what he meant, because talking to Draco was like stalking a wild animal. Step on too many sticks and they get spooked, run off.
The stack of expensive French wine bottles grew and grew, and by the dying embers of the parlour fire, they slept together in a twisted way that one only achieves from going past a certain level of drink and self hatred. It was not hateful nor passionate, simply because each of them were there with no other way to show exuberant joy for absolutely nothing.
The door slammed shut behind him, and he carried Draco as quickly and as carefully as he could to the rooms he remembered that they had used previously; the parlour and the bathroom. He lay Draco in the marble bath and took a moment to stare at him. He had no idea what to do, he realised. As a kelpie, he had only ever had to kill humans, to devour them.
"Draco," It was his mother's voice, hard and concerned as it always was. His muscles relaxed and he sat up, turning his head so that he might see her. "What are you doing out here? It's cold." It was a finalised point, stated less as question and more of a sign that she was concerned for his safety and that they should head back inside.
He gave Grey the only hoodie he had to wear, because as much as Draco appreciated Grey's build, he wasn't sure he was entirely up for seeing it all the time. This left him to wear more sophisticated wear, namely a cream knit jumper and dark trousers. The jumper, he decided, was comfortable enough, but he really could do without the trousers. Grey had also managed to weasel himself the only pair of jeans that Draco owned, deciding that they would be more comfortable than trousers. He was wrong.
"I'm going for a walk." Draco said suddenly, shutting his new 'Crime and Punishment' with a gentle slam. Blaise looked up from the desk with intrigue, a questioning look on his face.
"I'm quite fine, mother." he managed between choking fits of laughter, though he didn't quite feel out of breath. He didn't know what he felt.
And so the path of action had been paved. All the papers, the internet, would know is that the incredibly rich carriers of the Malfoy name had found their son crying in a small flat in London, upon seeing which, they had immediately taken him home, comforting him whilst he cried into their arms. If Draco weren't as fearful for torture or had more foresight whilst not being high, he probably would have made himself be dragged, kicking and screaming.
And so he did, like clockwork, as if he were back following an ordinary schedule as any teenage boy does, apart from the fact that it was really in no way normal.
The cage on the end was large and appeared to be filled by a... Horse? A very angry horse, upon second consideration. It was huge, much taller than Draco, and had to be at least twice as big as a normal horse. It didn't have normal eyes either; they were amber and glowing, intelligent, and watching everything Draco did with a unwitting glare. It threw its head back and screamed, pawing at the floor. Another senior auror came up behind him.
They walked longer than seemingly neccessary, because Draco could feel the wards reluctance to let him go once they crossed the boundary, meaning it would be fine for Lupin to apparate them to wherever they were supposed to go. He turned, opening his mouth.
"I'm quite fine, mother. I was just marvelling at the lake. It's quite pretty in the mornings, isn't it?" His mother's frown was so deep and sorrowful that he had to look away.
"Just what? Turned inanimate?" This was the third voice, the other one who loved him. Draco tried to blink, tried to see but he couldn't. It was less panicked now, more like he'd fallen and hit his head. Light seeped in and suddenly he could see, and he wasn't staring at people, more staring at the ceiling with heads hovering above him. He tried to blink. "He must've fainted. He didn't eat much yesterday." It was the same voice, calmer now. He tried to cock his head, to squint so he could see better, but was unyielding in his attempts. There were a lot of things he was unsure of.
"As they say, news of our death has been greatly exaggerated." The glamor felt nicer off, and he was reminded of the freedom he had in his own house without his father present.
And so he did, in every details other than the gory ones. He told Lupin of his triumphs, not of his downfalls, the glory an beauty that came with being a veela, not the kidnapping and selling of a few organs. (He hadn't really lost any, but they were more than glad to hand them off.) And after it all, he had shocked Lupin to silence and meandered on for so long that he had almost used up all of his time. (He kept getting distracted by Grey who would occasional wander round and break things, much to Lupin's dismay. )
The prospect of an actual father seemed so glorified to Nikolai that he didn't dare doubt the gift that had been lain in front of him. Damien watched him with a childish envy that still seemed to not interrupt their relationship, but Nikolai felt it. Lucius had swept in everyday of the week to whisk Nikolai somewhere new and exciting, and Nikolai loved the unconditionality of it.
"Well, I'm sure you wanted to see him, you looked so upset leaving the flat, and when Lucius smashed the picture." Draco sighed, miserably melancholic.
"Well, there you are. Mother, I'm gay." She looked like she was trying to accept it, she really did, but she turned her head away.
"That tree there. That's how you'll get in." It was a large oak tree with knotted roots tumbling over one an another, and if you tapped it in the right places with your wand, it open up and let you into the market. Sam still did not ask how he knew where it was, only nodded and called the others over to where they stood.
"Can I?" He asked. Draco nodded, inspecting the room. The window opened, and suddenly a large eagle owl was flying out of it, disappearing slowly into the distance. Draco watched the speck of black get smaller and smaller till it was barely visible through the haze of trees. It smelt fresh in the room to his great surprise. (Living with Blaise for a while often gave rooms the smell of French perfume, and he was sure living with a pair of untidy Gryffindors would make the room smell pretty bad.) Plants decorated this room as well, making the air crisp. Draco found himself liking the added greenery. He swiftly shut the window and unwrapped the curtains that seemed to be made of green silk, embroidered with silver, giving it a rippling effect that was more than pleasing. He found himself laughing at it and shaking the fabric to make it seem like pools of water against clean rock pools, amused at how pretty the colours looked. If only Blaise could see him now.
It was the twenty sixth of January when the crystal shattered. Everything had been perfect, or at least, it was if you blurred the edges. It was two am, and they were celebrating engagement. Of course, they had been told that they were rushing into it, to carry on dating and see where they ended up, but Harry had refused to listen, and at the time, he was exuberantly happy that he had. They were drinking champagne in their shared flat's kitchen, dancing around to whatever songs came across their old radio. It was crackly and old, but they both loved it, and Harry refused to throw it out, no matter what.
"Judging from moaning Myrtle, I think we're quite safe." Draco responded, doing the same and then reaching down to help Blaise up. "Merlin, what are you, eighty?" Blaise shot him a glare in turn of a reply and was the first to stroll down the small corridor of books, casting a glance over his shoulder to see if the pair of them were following. Pansy kissed Draco's cheek as they walked.
I have, after much deliberation, decided that this will not switch P.O.V's, which is really a shame because I do have a lot of Harry P.O.V stuff in my drafts, so I might just release a lot of that on a separate work for one-shots.
Fun fact: It took me half an hour and three friends to try and configure all of the gifts Pansy and Blaise got for Draco and we even went through a long list of car we thought he'd have fun owning, which I'm sure will now be added to my 36 questions fic!
"Yes, thank you darling." Blaise said rather loudly, cutting her off. Pansy grinned lecherously whilst Draco laughed at them. He had missed this, the stupid quarrels that didn't matter or last, the dynamic of love. It was getting dark outside.
Draco smiled at the note, and it was almost enough to make him panic, again. He didn't though. He thought instead of Grey next door, of seeing Blaise and Pansy again.
And so dinner was an odd affair, and cooking an odder one. Narcissa milled around the kitchen in the assemblance of a meal whilst Draco attempted to fetch ingredients and help out, but spent most of his time as he had a child; hovering on the counter and swinging his legs, watching with the eye of an eagle. He doubted that in his trustworthy memory would he find a moment that Narcissa had ever cooked for them.
"Draco?" How many times had grey said that? Draco couldn't tell, though he was sure he had heard it at least once.
"What do you think of this length?" Pansy asked as Draco's hands worked through her hair. "I was thinking of taking it longer, but I wasn't sure."
"No. I suppose you'll be a little unhappy that you won't receive a lovely corpse, but here I am." It was a long winding sentence for post-drowned Draco, but he got through it with minimal stuttering. He was good at this. He had had practice.
"Well I suppose Mr. Potter doesn't give me a hard time, I mean, I would even go out on a limb and say he was even trying to be nice to me. Weasley's another fucking matter, and I want to punch him."
"Naturally. His mother was, but I do believe it will work in our favour; he's even more powerful, incredibly rare and quite the asset." Narcissa snapped. It was the angriest Draco had ever seen her. In fact, he thought, it was probably the only time he had seen her angry, truly. She grabbed Draco's shoulder an thrust him roughly to the side, striding up to Lucius with a fire blazing in her eyes. She began to scream at him. Being a child of six, Draco found the whole scene, quite frankly, upsetting. He wasn't that sensitive anymore. He covered his ears and shrank himself on the floor where he had been thrown and cried as Narcissa screamed at Lucius. Lucius, however did not scream back. Draco wasn't that unknowledgeable, he had seen people scream at each other before, but it was always at each other. Lucius returned angrily, but he maintained his cool the best Draco had ever seen.
Ok, I'll admit it, most of this is basically just fluffy banter between the three Slytherins and I'm not at all sorry. I really wanted to convey their dynamic in the right way, and this is as close as I could get, so I hope you enjoy it and get a feel for their group!
He probably would have cried, but he was high and ignorant to the feelings of depression. That's why he loved it, see.
Laughter filled the flat again, but it sounded wrong. Like someone had scratched a record but was playing it anyway because there was nothing else to play. There was a slamming knock against the front door. Draco, deep in the recess of his psyche, knew who it was, seemingly the only area of his brain not affected by the drugs. There was an empty syringe in his hand.
"You're a kelpie, you can live there. It's next to a large lake and a river." Grey sounded almost delighted.
Thanks again for reading, please do leave a comment about what you liked/disliked or what you want to see more of in this fic, and I'll do my best to include it!
"His name's Draco Malfoy, and we need to know if you've seen him." The taller one seemed to do all of the talking. Harry's world was dissolving before his eyes. He must've stood like that for a while, because he was then prompted to speak again. "Have you?"
"You would be correct in thinking so. All taken by Hogwarts for the kitchens, I belive." He responded, inspecting a nail bed. "Would you like to run a bath and get clean? I can cook." Narcissa smiled with warm politeness, the closest to a real smile she could get.
"Goodness Draco, think of the rumours." Blaise murmured from underneath the sheets, drawing them steadily over his head.
"Mother." He returned, inclining her head. The cell door was opened so that they might be allowed to touch each other. Draco walked over to where Narcissa sat and set himself down  beside her. She was shaking. He put an arm around her shoulders and she lay her head across his own shoulder, one arm on his back.
"Who the fuck is calling in this late?" He joked back, pushing himself up to sit on the island, swinging his legs idly and raising an eyebrow. Harry just shrugged back. He walked the short distance to the front door, for it wasn't a fantastically large flat, just rounded the corridor to get to the main entrance. He opened the door. Two men in suits and dark glasses greeted him with cold glares. Harry wasn't quite sure what was going on.
"Of course," Draco said, grinning, slinking an arm around Blaise's waist, leaning into his scent. "Can I guess?"
Someone was laughing at him. That someone appeared to him in his drug infested mind as Pansy Parkinson, seated on a counter top. He knew what she was laughing at, so he eyed her back, like a cat. He looked a fucking mess, sitting on the floor of his shared flat's kitchen with bleeding feet, bloody hands, an empty syringe, wearing nothing but a long silk robe and a pair of Harry's old tracksuit bottoms that came up to above his ankles.
"Oh you two are no fun. Being the only girl sort of sucks in this group." She thought for a moment. "Oh, on the topic of sucking-"
Harry Potter fell in love with Aidan Baskerville in the summer of 2001, mid July. He knew this specific date because he had written it down, the first time that they had met, then the first time that they had gone out for coffee, which had turned out not to be just a single cup of coffee, it had turned out to be an entire date. This was by no means to say that Harry Potter was a man who believed in love at first sight, for he was quite the opposite. He believed that love had to be proven, that if you loved someone at first sight, then they must be an incredibly attractive.
"God, this'll be a fucking nightmare." He hissed. "Well, thank you Professor, I'm sure I'll see you at lunch in an hour. I don't suppose there's a location I could be given?" Lupin stood to match Draco.
Nikolai had been sitting is room when Marie had came to fetch him. He was reading a somewhat torn book on the origins of magical creatures, shivering under his blankets against the cold of the Russian winter. He looked up when the girl breached his doorway, looking nervously feverish. He had been six and not particularly self aware, so he followed her without any better thoughts. Looking back, he really ought not to have.
"Well darling, welcome to the Malfoy estate." He drawled, throwing his arms wide in what could have been a sarcastic gesture. Grey's facial expressions seemed to match the ones he made as a horse and came together as a sort of half way frown. "First matter of business is cleaning you up, and then we can talk about living arrangements." Draco didn't watch Grey's expression, he just turned away and strode toward the manor. A peacock trilled from the garden and he was hit with a sudden rush of fear. "Don't touch the peacocks unless you would like to meet a swift demise."
"Am I going to get somewhere to sleep?" Grey asked haughtily as Draco inspected the signs for the doors.
"My son. My son! You perfect miracle, you're going to fix everything!" He exclaimed, grabbing Nikolai and twirling him, as fathers often do with their sons. Nikolai giggled and held on tighter. Marie had smiled ruefully from behind them, watching with a longing glint in her eye. She had shown Lucius back Nikolai's room and they had sat down on the shoddy bed which creaked and waned under their combined weight.
"Well, I'll sleep there then." Draco must've looked stricken because Grey then gave him an odd look.
Imagine, he had thought to himself, imagine being Lucius Malfoy and going to such lengths to secure an heir, and instead, you get a half breed Russian who ended up accidently drowning himself at the age of sixteen. It was ironic, he had thought.
But he couldn't stop thinking of the feral panic in Aiden's- (His name, Harry reminded himself, was Draco. It always had been.) eyes. His decision had been made though, and he wasn't straying from it now. Harry Potter was impossible to sway once he had his mind made up.
good." Draco snorted and batted Blaise's hand away, leaning awkwardly and removing his hand from his shoulders so that he could plait Pansy's hair, who immediately turned round obediently, using her hands to throw her hair up so that Draco could reach it easier. Such as there friendship, they moved from the topic completely and began a new one.
"You have to have an auror down once a week for your house arrest, so be sure to ask for a man named Sam." He advised, stepping out the door. A peacock screamed in the distance. Narcissa smiled at him, and waved elegantly, as though it were a high class gesture. "Goodbye mother. I love you." He smiled back ruefully, shouldering his bags and turned his back on the house.
"Draco," It was his mother's voice. She looked like she was halfway through the stages of grief and shock.
As always, thank you so much for reading, and please do leave a comment if there is anything you particularly liked/disliked, or just because, because I absolutely love reading comments and tbh I need a little love right now lmao!
"Time to go. We're told you can find it, so you're going to accompany us." His voice was rough and gravely, but not cruel sounding. Draco hoped that his mother had been treated well under him. There was no real space for the 'I love yous' that were exchanged under quiet confidentiality, but they were said anyway. He was pleased to see that the dementors made no move to grab and drag his mother, and that she walked with an air of grace and dignity that none of the other prisoners had.
"Very well, thank you." Her voice was quiet, but not subdued. She was afraid of speaking out of place, but she knew better than to let that show, especially in front of aurors. They stayed silent for a while after that, just sitting there in the misery of their lives and the holding cell of a ministry prison. Draco wanted to scowl. "Draco," Narcissa said again, and then stopped.
"There's an ancient story about Raczidian who attempted to cast a Patronus but instead of, you know, casting one, he was eaten alive by maggots that shot out of his wand."
, his ears automatically sharpening their hearing skills, and confirmed to himself that he was not crying.
“I am very much aware that you skipped our very important meeting regarding your Apprenticeship,” she said, her tone sharp yet somehow also warm. “While these meetings are not compulsory, as not every career requires an Apprenticeship nor NEWTS, some of these are very much helpful and it would be foolish to let the opportunity pass.
he would swallow, look away, talk to someone nearby, or deliberately change the topic by asking her about her Apprenticeship which she was too eager to talk about. In a lengthy conversation that lasted over an hour, he learned she was going to work in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and thereafter become the Minister of Magic through a thoroughly detailed and itemized six-year plan.
"How about I'll harm anyone who even thinks of telling the Dark Lord anything," Draco said darkly, "because I will."
'Most likely wasn't so toxic when he set it up -' Bill said, 'some of our products can become toxic over time -'
'If you want someone to blame Ron, blame me - not Draco,' Aria said, 'besides I'll be out of here in a few hours - it's just a cough now - I'm fine.'
'Come on - let's get something to eat - no actually let's just wait by the pool.' she shook her head, 'Come on.'
'The bonding plans are coming along fine,' Aria said, though Draco knew better to think she had finished. something though Draco did not know what bothered her. 'It's just - I'm not - I can't -'
The candles had been lit, Draco glanced at the small dining table he had set up in the Manor just for himself and Aria, it was imperative that the meal went well. He was concerned as tomorrow they would be heading back to Hogwarts and with himself and Aria being in separate places of the castle, Draco thought that Aria may suffer from bonding withdrawal. The sooner they bonded, the better things would be for her. It felt so strange putting someone else's needs before his own but in a good way. Draco ran a hand through his hair, what was Aria doing to him, admittedly most of it had been his own fault, swearing an oath, promising to behave around Aria's friends. Things had gone from there.
"Very," Aria replied. She tried to not sound too proud of the fact. She guessed where this conversation was going. But Voldemort was working towards it.
'Don't ... don't come near me,' Aria said her voice breaking as she spoke, she would not break down in front of everyone. She ripped the bracelet from her wrist and throw it at him, not caring who saw or heard the commotion she caused. 'Keep it, stick it where the sun can't shine for all I care. I want nothing ... nothing to do with you.'
The words had not been a question, or if he would study with her and yet not a demand to study with her. She had been asking him to study with her ... asking to spend time with her. That had to be it ... his mother had organised him to accompany her on the holiday and Aria had said he was invited to her birthday celebrations ... she had never asked him to go.
Aria took a breath, as the students turned towards her, Draco wondered what on earth she had been planning to do.
Had she missed something in those few moments Draco had apologised or something, for her best friends to sit there calmly? She must have done. That or this was a rather weird dream.
Aria was placed, and by placed Aria was shoved into the spare room she had often used at Malfoy Manor by her new mother-in-law, the moment she appeared. She didn't even give Aria a chance to question Narcissa in regards to what happened with Celena. Perhaps it was for the best that she didn't know after all ... but still, Aria had wanted to see what the gardens now looked like considering Draco had little time to reput everything together and replace what had been destroyed by the fire.
Aria shook her head, 'It's ... I'm busy that weekend - it's my birthday ... and I've got my orders from Dudley-' Aria did not seem at all pleased, 'I'm to celebrate it the normal way.'
Aria didn't stop playing with him either, not once, while his aunt and mother chatted - well apart from when she changed him or fed him - they changed their games - Aria supported him to sit up, and helped him play with some soft blocks - building them up and knocking them down again. Put him on his stomach to encourage him to learn to crawl, the five-month-old was starting to grasp the idea that he had to move his arms and legs together to move. Until finally Teddy began to tire.
Love? Well, that was new. But then she supposed he had just sworn to respect her, which meant he couldn't taunt her with his usual nicknames of Potty or Scarhead. It was so on!
'If the Sorting Hat considered sorting you into a different house - and you're to state which one.' Aria said.
'There is an old pureblood custom,' Draco explained, 'A really old and outdated custom, but at one time an heiress hair could only be seen down and brushed by members of their family or their fiance.'
Which meant that her Muggle family had tried writing to her. The letter itself had been opened, for it had been addressed to the headmaster, but for her attention, but Hogwarts of course no longer had a headmaster. After the letter had been thoroughly checked which Professor McGonagall told Aria she had done herself, the letter had been handed over.
'We didn't exactly get on very well Aria,' Draco said calmly, 'How was I meant to know that? How was my mother?'
There was another pause. 'I believed we were right, that all Muggles were filthy, I had no reason to disbelieve it. Until the moment I checked your pulse.'
Aria nodded, she had never known him to lie to her - usually because he knew things that she didn't and he liked to gloat about it in her face. Well besides the time he had told lies about her to the press but that wasn't exactly to her, so she didn't think that quite counted as the same thing.
'Nah,' Aria grinned mischievously, and she turned to their children and Miss Reyes. 'Got everything, good, let's go.'
'I still can't believe that after all these years Sirius's last "screw you" - actually worked,' Aria said, 'and that I just had to stumble across it.'
'It's not like you had a chance to last year - is it. None of us did - Quidditch was off the cards and Prefects - well with the Carrows -' Ginny said.
She felt as well as heard the sigh Draco let out. 'You're probably still in shock, it's a lot to take in. I'm sure McGonagall will let you go.'
'Weasley's theory, again,' Draco huffed, 'Compatible magic does not work like that, and if Weasley had any sense.'
Aria smirked, glancing at the bracelet glittering upon her wrist. She had been hesitant to accept the gift, thinking maybe it had been cursed, until she remembered his oath. If it had not been for that, she doubted she would have accepted it, despite how much he clearly had spent on it. Well if Malfoy wanted to waste more of his money, she was more than happy to let him.
'All I ask ... is for you to tell me - things ... preferably before I hear them from someone else.' Aria said, 'That would be the best courting gift I could receive for now.'
The series of events had plagued him over and over, and though he had seen Potter at the trails, he had not been within reaching distance, however much he wanted to be. It had been his mother who had connected the dots, had figured out that their magic was truly compatible, even though it was his father who had the Veela inheritance. Why did he have to be Veela? And why was it an instinct, a want, a need to be with someone who had compatible magic? And why did it have to be with someone who would not want him?
Hearing all of that sucked Harry's joy out of his body like a Dementor's Kiss and what was worse was that Harry was positive he had almost, if not more, assignments as Ron and he barely had begun any of them.
That was all the information Harry needed. He had tried everything to sleep and if there was anything that was bound to work it would be this Draught. He simply needed to make sure Malfoy was not looking at him to pour himself some, lest he attracted questions from Malfoy as to why he was helping himself to the colorless Draught. It took some work but he coaxed Malfoy to hand the vial over to Professor Slughorn and in that time he speedily picked up a spare vial on the table, poured himself some of the potion and stuffed it inside his pocket.
Malfoy looked at him as if he were mad and promptly rolled his eyes. That was enough of a response. He stepped back from the potion and motioned for him to come closer. The potion was currently a pale lilac color which, according to the textbook, was the correct color.
"In the Muggle world, there are superstitions of not crossing a black cat and, like, is it the same thing?" Harry asked, deeply curious.
A lightbulb turned on above Harry's head. "Oh yes! Why didn't I think of that? Of course, he would be lots of help. He's always blabbering about Hogwarts history to anyone who would care. I think he knew a thing or two about Godric which, like, might help tell me how to get him to speak."
Malfoy made a swish-swish movement with his wand and asked what he had been meaning to say earlier. Harry frowned at the obvious change in subject but he was too excited to share the news with him to comment further.
"It's usually recurring nightmares going back to Australia, meeting my parents, and them not recognizing who I am. Sometimes I manage to reverse the Memory Charm but it doesn't work and they are doomed to never know that I am their only daughter."
"We're..." He let his sentence peter out. Were they friends? Were they acquaintances? Surely they were more than acquaintances but were they less than friends? Or were they buddies? The type of buddies that solved crimes? Who knew. "We're us."
He was stuck in his thoughts which was dangerous as the last time he was in this position, he found himself upon the Astronomy Tower writing a letter addressed to his adopted mom. His eyes looked away and settled on the fading white of the makeshift curtain surrounding his hospital bed. Malfoy had not come around to visit him. Yet. He had asked Hermione to ask Malfoy to visit him and that was a terrible conversation to have. She came back the next day, stating stiffly that Malfoy would see him when he, and she quoted,
book front to back and the year 1368 is a dry year. Trust me nothing interesting happened relating to Godric or Hogwarts. Actually, that was, like, the year when the Third Triwizard Tournament occurred."
"It could've been the apples, sweet Luna," Blaise said, his eyes glistening under the afternoon sunlight. "Apples are in season right now therefore the oranges cannot be holding Harry's sleep hostage."
"Quite right, Ms Patil but unfortunately the year is wrong. Does anyone know the correct year? Ah yes, Ms Granger?"
Harry made a mental note to research more on the concept. And find out what happened to the other few wizarding people. He supposed it was a cool concept, having magic to keep one alive but the zombie-like feeling was something he was not privy to, he hated every minute of it as he simply wanted to close his eyes and rest.
Harry faltered, "Uhhh… I think it's avocadoes." He enjoyed his chocolate frogs as Blaise and Luna buzzed about The Force. Sometimes he wondered if he was secretly bonkers based on their conversations, and also the conversations the three of them had in Divination but then he supposed why would he think so? Divination was not a crazy of a subject as everyone thought – damned be Hermione and Malfoy.
Madam Pomfrey cleared her throat, digging him out of his thoughts. "To enhance security at the Hospital Wing and quite frankly reduce the number of visitors at any one given point, with the help of Dumbledore's portrait and Headmistress McGonagall, we have devised a system whereby a patient – such as yourself, Harry – are allowed up to six visitors. Anybody to whom you have not given permission, shall not be allowed to come through. Are we clear?"
Malfoy never saw it that way, if he was being honest. He supposed being taught by a ghost that died in the 1920s was somewhat of a wonder but as Potter said, it was only because he grew up in the wizarding world and already knew what Professor Binns taught. Most probably had the entire curriculum drilled into his brain long before the Hogwarts letter arrived by owl.
Malfoy crossed his legs, his back against the chair. "I do so try to wonder why that oaf is still at the school teaching that horrendous subject."
As it so happened, Harry himself was amongst those being dropped which caused a murmur of shocked and surprised whispers across the classroom. He wondered if the reason he was dropped was because of his last experience at the Club. He had been searching more about Voldemort's past which he found out that Professor Slughorn himself had taught Voldemort, rather Tom Riddle, about the Horcruxes. He was curious, that was all, but it probably did not warrant him being uninvited from tonight's party.
"I told her I'd think about it," Harry interrupted their bickering. They both turned to look at him, Ron's eyes narrowed at him. "I do love her, don't get me wrong, but not, like, you know, romantically. I see her almost like a sister. Like, how Hermione and I would never date."
"In Fourth Year when I went home for Christmas, Mother and I would spend a lot of time looking up at the stars. She would narrate to me of Canis Major, her personal favorite, or even Cygnus who was Aquila, a little bit about the history Castor and Pollux and now, every time I look up at the stars, I find…"
"Bummer," Blaise said, examining the collection of Pixie Puffs. "Can't imagine squalling in this forsaken place for more than an hour. This is a sacrifice, darling."
"Harry," she began, her voice not in the harsh Matron voice, but a kind, motherly tone, "I am going to be very frank with you as you will have a lot of questions henceforth, are you ready?"
He was sat at a corner in the large library and on their table was Neville, Ron, and Hermione. Ron was simply there because Harry dragged him along instead of letting him play chess with his sister Ginny.
“Precisely what I mean,” Malfoy spat frustrated, but more at himself than Harry. “I can’t find it and those useless portraits in the dungeons won’t assist me. I, also, can’t seem to locate the Bloody Baron.”
Harry, not having admitted to anyone, could cast a corporeal Patronus no more, he could not summon his stag. He tried, truly, but gathering happy, joyful memories were proving difficult lately what with the War, fighting off Voldemort, learning that Dumbledore had kept him alive simply to have him die at the opportune moment and, not forgetting his mother was in love with the slimy Snape. All these tended to push down any happy thoughts he had been keeping in storage.
Harry started. The portrait was empty! There was no one in the portrait. There was, however, a painting of a lion that presumably was sleeping – it was hard to tell – in a field of green grass with the sun shining in the upper left corner of the frame. Below the portrait it was written:
Malfoy shook his head right to left. "Yes and no. Yes, because that is the legend and no, because there is no proof."
, but once it was over I thought, like, I'd feel the same but to be fair, I did not. I am grateful that we had each other, duh."
uh ohhhh did harry pay attention in class about dosages?? who knows?? apart from that, this narrative of sleeping will come through in the end, dw, everything will come out eventually. you know them mystery books like agatha christie or shows like sherlock where there are easter eggs but you ignore them cause they're so INSIGNIFICANT... well well well [;
"I read," Ron chipped in, "that the cards possess you like how Voldy possessed Ginny in Second Year."
Both Harry and Ginny looked down at the table and indeed there were plates and plates of duck. Watching the hot steam evaporate from the juicy meat, his stomach growled and immediately dug in.
kudos & comments - even the random ones, too - are HIGHLY WELCOMED as i love to read what y'all think (:
"I also have nightmares," Hermione told him, her voice low as if admitting the fact out loud for the first time.
"You grew up in this wizarding world, better yet you're a Pureblood, so everything that's being taught it's, like, ingrained in you."
"Don't worry about it! I'm just glad to hear another voice other than Pomfrey's. And I did miss you, too. Lots and lots."
"I apologize for my thoughtless comment, Harry," Madam Pomfrey said. "However, what you underwent rarely happens to ordinary wizards and witches. Naturally, magic can sustain one's needs for a longer period than usual, say, if one was on a fast, magic would be able to sustain their needs until for period of time."
In a jiffy, she was back, a floating silver tray of cups, teapot, and cakes following behind her. A silvery tray popped out of thin near Harry's head and the teapot began pouring tea into the white porcelain cup. He was never tired of magic, him. It always seemed to amaze him, even eight years after.
"Patronus?" he asked. He did not want to call Malfoy out for his blatant change of subject yet again he did not want to thank him for it so he let it be.
“It’s what I thought,” he said mournfully before blinking and looking hastily around. Thankfully no one picked up on him talking to a roasted duck.
"I understand, Harry. The War was a difficult time for anyone and if you felt differently about Ginny as an effect of it, it is okay. What is not okay is to keep her waiting."
"It happens, sometimes, with the dead when they are afraid to go to the other side of The Veil. They remain on this side, with the living, because they cannot part," he explained.
"It's just… er…" Harry faltered. How could he inform him that he was, well, dead? Professor Binns floated before him, waiting for him to continue. "Your wife… Is she… when did… the roast dinner…"
He tried to not let it get to him but it did. He was spiraling since their conversation this afternoon. Harry was thinking about his friends. Here was a misconception that people often had about him; they thought that he had lots of friends, hundreds of friends even, but truth be told he did not. He could not count all his true-blue friends on one hand. Currently, only Hermione and Ron made it on the list. He wondered if they were there by default or did he truly consider them friends?
“Interesting. Perhaps the portrait is charmed to only show to specific people? Such as those from Gryffindor.” He muttered under his breath when his Cauldron Cakes transformed into apples. He set his wand down with a loud smack and turned to Harry. “Have you perhaps gone with someone else?”
“However, I have been keeping my eye on you. There is something different about you, something that reminds me of a fish out of water.” She paused and for the first time in their interaction her eyes softened at him. “I can see your pain from afar, Harry, and it’s a surprise that no one has been able to spot it.”
He swallowed thickly before stating, “I am sorry that I did not—” She raised her hand to stop his speech of what he thought she wanted to hear.
Her bushy hair bounced to match her enthusiasm. "Of course! When I was in Second Year, I stumbled upon the charm during my extra reading for Professor Flitwick and it said that magic can sustain one's needs that one won't need to do activities such as sleep or eat. However, while the magic sustains you, it also slowly kills you. A bit of an incongruity."
"Since Trelawney insists we call each other by our first names," Blaise said, unperturbed. "And besides, Harry, Trelawney said nobody was dying this week in Hogwarts."
In no time, there were to begin the brewing process. Malfoy had slid the list of ingredients and pointed sharply towards the Potions cupboard and he marched off without another word. It was a known fact that Malfoy was superior in Potions, not just to Harry but in their year if not the whole school, as he always achieved straight Os since First Year whereas Hermione was sometimes received an EE and Harry? That was a different story.
“Mum’s the word on the change. It’s an ongoing mystery and so far, no one seems to have solved it. Not even Helena herself knows the answer.”
Harry swallowed. The last time he checked he was in an argument with his best friends over Ginny and that was never resolved. He had barely been talking to other people who were alive, that is, except for Malfoy. He did talk to Luna and Blaise and had the three of them had grown quite close but perhaps not close enough to allow visitation rights. Or perhaps they had?
"I invited him on my visitors' list because we're working on something together and hoped to get updates."
Fat Friar nodded. "They were the best of friends, those two. Tied at the hip. They got on like a house on fire."
Harry sighed and looked at the end of his bed. He stretched his feet towards the edge, his tippy toes unable to touch the end rail of his hospital bed. "What do you do about your nightmares?"
thank you for reading this far and kudos & comments - even the random ones, too - are welcomed with open arms as i love to read what y'all think (:
Malfoy sighed contentedly, leaning back against the stone wall of the Astronomy Tower, his eyes lazily looking over at the blinking stars above them. "To be honest, I don't know either but only because there's not much about him anywhere."
He looked startled, perhaps at being called out or simply being summoned by her. He slowly rose from his table, picking his bags from the floor, and followed the Matron out of the Hall and down the corridor where they were few students lurking about.
Harry turned back and, for the second time in the night, looked up at the night skies. It was full of bright stars, blinking happily and a full moon that reminding him of Lupin. He smiled small at the sight of the moonlight, smiled at the sight of the stars. For the second time since his arrival at Hogwarts, he did not look down at the grass but kept his eyes up at the starry night.
"He had a falling out with the rest of the founders due to his stance of killing Muggleborns at Hogwarts."
Malfoy stared blankly at him then promptly changed the subject, deeming Divination not a topic to be discussed deeply, or at all. "Madam Pomfrey told me you're getting out in two days."
Malfoy bit down on his tongue, feeling his anger seeping into his words. He was not angry per se at the prospect of Godric and Salazar but at his mother never having a moment to say goodbye to her husband.
"Bugger!" Ron cursed beside him. "How are we supposed to pick someone? Better yet how are Slytherins going to partner with anybody, not after what they did during the War."
Malfoy nodded. "It's not really talked about, I don't know why but I think mainly because it's a Salazar legend and," he lightly shrugged, "not many people care about him, not after his sullied reputation."
They each shared a grateful smile, a laugh here and there. Harry reached over to help himself to more candy as Hermione took the last bite of her toffee she had taken earlier.
"I don't know what I want to do." He swallowed thickly, quickly side glancing at Malfoy who was looking up at the stars in the sky. "I thought to be an Auror is what I wanted but after the War, like, I don't think I can do that anymore. Like, I don't have a lot of fight left in me."
Malfoy narrowed his eyes at him before he slid the bowl of crashed Sopophorous bean. Harry accepted it and added it to his potion.
“You can go on another pretense as to why you’re visiting the portrait, Potter. You don’t have to be literal.”
Sparks of pink carnations softly flew from the tip of his wand and surrounded Professor Binns beginning with the tips of his shoes up to his legs, covering his arms with nothing but pink carnations, and eventually they fell gently over his face. All the while Malfoy had been murmuring under his breath.
Harry smirked. Whenever Hermione failed, Blaise was always reliable. "You do forget that we do share Divination."
Apprenticeship routinely began in Fifth Year where students were to choose a profession they wanted to pursue upon graduation from Hogwarts. Students are given counseling and attend workshops at that time so that they may make informed decisions in regards to their NEWT subjects that are to be selected in the following year.
He dropped his bag to the floor, pulled out a seat, and slumped down on it. In comparison, Malfoy gracefully sat down on the stool, his back as straight as a ruler for Malfoys always had great posture, regardless.
"Ron," Hermione cried exasperated. "The War is done and over with. We're not there anymore. Besides, McGonagall advocated for inter-House unity this year and that is precisely why Slughorn has asked as to pair up with someone from another House."
Harry had to agree with Ron. Surveying those left, there were still plenty of Slytherins left but very few Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws. For some odd reason, he found himself eyeing Malfoy, and an even more odd reason, he was hoping that Malfoy did not have a partner yet.
Fat Friar, strangely, disappeared below the ground without another word. It was a bit out of character for him, but well Harry had just met the monk and did not in fact know much about him to say he was acting out of character. When he arrived on the 10
Professor Slughorn clapped his hands twice. "Excellent, Ms Granger. Quite excellent. Sharp as ever! I can wait to hear more excellence at the Slug Club dinner party tonight. Can someone remind us why the Draught of Living Death is dangerous?"
He laid the ingredients on the table and was mildly surprised to find the equipment neatly and sharply organized before Malfoy.
"The truth is I couldn't sleep," Harry explained. "During the day I was, well, like, going about my day, and come nightfall I was wide awake. I didn't know how that would work because, like, zombies don't exist in the Wizarding world so how was it possible? Apparently, my magic was keeping me alive whilst depleting at the same time, so like, while I was awake I was also dying."
Harry gave him a side glance then turned back to his Potion, biting his lips from smiling too much. He followed the new instructions from Malfoy and it was about the fourth cycle that the potion changed its color from a lilac color to clear. Harry's jaw dropped in surprise.
He looked down at the neatly arranged ingredients and picked up the sloth brain. A hard clearing of the throat alerted him that he had picked the wrong ingredient. He dropped it and picked up another, no throat clearing, and confidently threw it inside the cauldron.
If they looked up, they were looking at their future, if they looked down, they were looking at their past. He never did quite understand her cryptic words, not just this one, but then again, it was how she always spoke.
Harry nodded in understanding. He did not mean to brag but Defense Against the Dark Arts was a bore to him as all that was taught in class, he learned in the one year he was trying not to die. It was widely known he was going to get an O in his NEWTS for it.
"Well, sometimes stars do appear during the day but mostly they're better appreciated during the night."
Fat Friar twirled twice hovering higher above the floor. "We all deserve forgiveness – even if Sir Nicholas and Baron disapprove."
"Malfoy is also using this as a distraction. But he says, like, that he has nothing else left apart from solving this mysterious legend."
Harry turned and found Blaise looking at him curiously with a bemused smirk playing on his lips. Harry swallowed. How did this even happen? He was meant to partner up with Malfoy, not Blaise of all people. He already saw him enough in Divination. Why did his hands have to cramp up and point to the closest Slytherin?
This was partially true as before the arrival of his Hogwarts letter he had been taught by a private tutor, under the strict supervision of his father, of the history of Pureblood – which did include a lot about History of Magic in its generality.
Seemingly out of thin air, he produced a long parchment that he waved in the air. "I have changed the rules of admission; no longer will one need to have connections nor hold fame but simply show true promising strength in magic. Additionally, there shall be 12 students, no longer 10. Those attending shall be…"
It sounded like she was accusing him of an overdose but surely that was not what happened. He looked away from her and his eyes settled on a glass painting of a famous Healer from medieval times.
Malfoy rolled his eyes as he sat down on the chair beside his bed. "With a little persuasion, I must admit. Since when do you talk to Blaise so freely?"
Perhaps looking into crystal balls would be something, he lightly mused. For a flash second, he pictured Malfoy rolling his eyes at the suggestion that his future career involved looking deeply into foggy crystal balls.
"Do you think that their bloodline has, like, been infused with dark magic from practicing card reading for a long time?"
"You have extraordinary magic powers, I hope you know that. When you were not catching any sleep, your magic sustained your needs, in a way, it gave you energy to power through the day. You would presumably catch up to two or three hours of sleep in 24 hours and that was it. In those few hours, it was not enough rest consequently, your magic took over. It's currently the middle of October and I am assuming you have not been sleeping for a long time since the War, therefore your magic was tiring itself out, it was not able to replenish itself."
