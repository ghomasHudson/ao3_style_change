Finally, this chapter was originally longer, but in an effort to keep my hopes for a Monday chapter, and because I didn't want to weigh it down with every single interaction between our boys, it's been edited. If something seems off, please know why and point it out if you want. I'd love to correct it.
They met not far from the Astronomy Tower where Luna was having a lively discussion with a portrait of dancing quills. She had long, blonde hair and large, round blue eyes. She was a whole head shorter than him and had a dreamy sort of voice when she greeted him.
Harry cut him off by leaping into his arms. He still wasn't tall enough to reach Hagrid's neck when he did this, but Hagrid scooped him up nonetheless.
Malfoy's Slytherin friends—Crabbe, Goyle, Parkinson, and Zabini—had reached them now and were laughing at Malfoy's words. For all intense and purposes, Malfoy was mocking Harry. Degrading him and pissing on his win.
"You mean you and Weasley came down here with brooms?"
"Mate."
It was just after the start of term, and Harry and Ron had decided that just because there was no Quidditch that year, it didn't mean they had to go all year without flying. So, Harry grabbed his broom, Ron borrowed one of his own, and they made the trek to the pitch. Malfoy, apparently, had had the same idea, only Malfoy's friends, Crabbe and Goyle, weren't exactly the flying types, and being outnumbered by himself, Malfoy retreated after only a few colourful comments.
Even Professor Trelawney's usual prediction of his death didn't faze him, and he couldn't really find it in himself to care when Hagrid reported that Skeeter only wanted to talk about Harry during their interview. It was obvious she was currently looking for a new angle on Harry, as playing up the tragic hero would soon become boring.
, Harry—"
Harry nodded, unable to find words. Snape spun around, robes billowing as usual, and stalked away. Harry turned back to Luna, who appeared to be giggling either with the sculpture or at something the sculpture somehow told her.
mean that we will be relaxing the standards of behaviour we expect from Hogwarts students. I will be most seriously displeased if a Gryffindor student embarrasses the school in any way."
Draco took a breath, telling himself that this was ridiculous. He was being
"I'm very impressed," Hermione said. "It's upsetting this is even a controversial issue, but to know you preemptively have Hogwarts on your side—"
"Spit it out, Potter."
. We decided then we were going to go after Ginny—just me and Ron, mind, with Hermione petrified and all—and bring him with us."
"What was that all about?" she demanded.
He winced then sighed heavily, letting his head hang. Perhaps he simply needed to practise not associating those kinds of thoughts with something
to have a partner, and if he wanted to bring… Mortification surged through him, making him hot everywhere.
Harry was in the shower later, feeling uplifted by flight and victorious having won against an encounter with Malfoy. He always felt victorious when that happened, a warm, bright bubble of
His hair even seemed to relax when he was like this. Harry watched as some of it fell over an eye, and Malfoy simply flicked it away instead of mindfully brushing it back in its place. Harry couldn't say his shoulders were less tensed, but they were tense with perhaps excitement more than anything else. His hip cocked out as he pointed at something, and Harry wondered if he was wearing a belt. What that movement would do if he wasn't wearing a belt and his trousers were just a little big for him.
Ron pointed to Luna behind her back as if to ask if Harry was sure about this, and Harry just grinned and shrugged.
These thoughts were tricky nowadays, however. Inevitably, thoughts of his parents were quickly followed by ponderings of what they would think of
When he failed to speak, Professor McGonagall stopped him, putting both hands on his shoulders. He could see, plain as day, the concern and care in her eyes being viciously stomped down as bravery and stoicism took their place. It caused warmth to spread through him and words to crawl unbidden from his throat.
to what we're doing."
"It's only a matter of public record. I began this course last year and had an incident in the first lesson. I was injured, you see."
Harry groaned, thunking his head back on the window.
but even other Slytherins—yet it always felt like Snape expected more from Malfoy.
"I DIDN'T EXPECT TO LIVE! I KNEW I WAS DEAD! BUT I DID IT! I DIDN'T ASK ANYONE FOR IT, AND I DIDN'T ASK FOR THIS! I WANTED
The closest he came to letting himself think about it was worrying over the whole bloke-thing of the matter, but as he already had enough to worry about, he tried not to.
Hermione rolled her eyes, still grinning, and let him go.
"No," Harry agreed, chuckling. "But…"
every word that passed through his full, posh, slightly chapped lips—and
"Didn't mean to scare you," Pansy purred. Or, he was pretty sure she thought she purred. Her voice was always so high-pitched, it sounded more like a suspended squeal. "I have some potion that can help."
." He had a wild urge to tell her what happened with Professor McGonagall before the task but ignored it and only held her tighter.
The Slytherins didn't seem comfortable enough to go without robes anywhere but around the lake. Harry wasn't quite sure why so many Slytherins could be seen throughout the day going in and out of the boathouses, but most of the time, they were a lot more casually dressed. It was hard to see them in detail when not directly on the grounds, but Harry could make out the boys from the stone terraces or steps directed that way. They were usually always joking with each other, and joking Slytherins apparently entailed a lot of playful shoving. Harry could see how easy it would be, for a playful shoving back and forth could turn into—
As he walked to the hospital wing, what was going to be his third visit for the month, he thought over his symptoms—because they had to be symptoms, right? It was honestly hard to pinpoint. Draco had avoidance and denial down to an art, could probably convince himself of things quicker and more efficiently than he could other people, so it was hard to think back to how things got this bad.
journey, Harry. I daresay you will have decades to explore them all. For now, please just focus on what is immediate and at hand."
, he thought but couldn't say. It took all his strength to try to force a normal reaction and hand her back the vial.
Here, he would supposedly have the staff's support. He sure seemed to have Professor McGonagall's.
It seemed like every Quidditch Chaser at Hogwarts had a straighter torso and more muscle formed in their arms. This was true of the girls, too, but the boys' torsos were more pronounced, although Harry could only see it if one of the other House's had slung off their robes in favour of just their button-up. Meanwhile, in Gryffindor tower, students ran in and out of dorms in various stages of dress or even pyjamas. Sixth-year Kenneth Towler, for example, seemed to only wear bottoms to bed and never a shirt.
his father are already doing private reviews…"
Harry scratched the back of his head. "Er, nothing really. I guess just… everything."
Harry didn't know about partners, but if they were making a pack to just grit their teeth and do it, Harry would.
"Who? Oh, no. I just meant… when it comes to relationships, and y'know, everything
Their spells ricocheted off each other. Goyle was sent to the hospital wing, Snape brought Hermione to tears at her rapidly growing teeth, and both Harry and Ron lost Gryffindor fifty points and got detention each. If that wasn't bad enough, he was removed from Double Potions for stupid press photos and the Weighing of the Wands for the Tournament. Even if Harry wasn't having a problem wanking for girls, he had a sneaky suspicion Rita Skeeter could put him off females for life.
"Sorry, I, er… I…" He shook his head. "I have a plan, I just." He took a deep breath. "I guess, where I need to start is to ask… w-what are your thoughts… on… things…"
"Do you need material, is that why you're asking?" Malfoy smile went wide. "Imagination stretching thin after a couple of years? I've heard about Trelawney, but this, Potter, this is just too good. I must thank you. You have truly given the best yule present I could have asked for. Well, almost."

Malfoy scoffed but didn't reply. As they made their way to the Chamber, Malfoy detailed the research he had been doing, very obviously pleased with himself.
in the first place. It was pretty mild in comparison to how nasty he knew Malfoy could be.
"Oh, well, I'm sorry I didn't tell you every single little detail of that horrific night!"
Malfoy was glaring at him, but the book had skidded slowly across the damp stone floor to  Malfoy's feet. Harry noticed with Malfoy's quick glance down as it hit his shoes. He lunged for it, but Malfoy was quicker and snatched it up.

to like. I think… I think that whomever someone finds attractive isn't wrong. It is what it is."
! I'm normal! Just, forget it! Never mind, I didn't mean anything!"
"I don't know," Hermione sighed.
Ginny considered him, seeming surprised but also strangely relieved by this. "I… think so. It just depends on… well, how well you handle weird."
The Malfoy-Potions face wasn't something he let himself look at often because when his face was like that— eyebrows furrowed but not pinched, eyes narrowed critically but alit with accepting focus, lips pursed thoughtfully around his words that were smooth rather than sharp, hands relaxed with fingers twitching with his thoughts…
"Because it's
Harry thought back to his dream. The other fantasies he had had. He stared openly at Malfoy's jaw and neck right then, wondering just how long that long neck could become when thrown back to give Harry access. It was an idle wonder, one that didn't much stir anything in Harry past the descending numbness he was giving himself over to.
"Right then, this way." Harry began to lead them again. He also began noticing a bad stench getting stronger.
The bell rang then, and everyone immediately began packing up to leave. A lot of the girls were going into giggle-fits.
was and its reputation, something Luna apparently took as gospel, but Ginny ended by smiling and declaring Luna all right in her books.
It was disturbingly evident that Hagrid fancied Madame Maxime, which normally, Harry would have supported completely. Hagrid was amazing with such a big heart, and Madam Maxime, in all honesty, seemed like she could take him.
It was hard to tell because Malfoy had somehow stolen their collective
Malfoy narrowed his eyes, and Harry fought hard to keep his expression. He knew what Malfoy was talking about, of course, but he always did enjoy having one up on Malfoy.
Both of his friends grunted in acceptance and set about reading where he told them.
Malfoy was slow as he approached it, a couple of times pausing to spin in place and take in the rest of the Chamber. He spent a long time looking at Slytherin's statue, and a longer time staring at the basilisk. He even came closer to its head where the sword's fatal blow was still visible.
He punched his pillow a few times before officially curling up for bed. He was fuming, extra furious that he was still watching Malfoy on the map, where he had been in the toilets, obviously studying the sinks. Moaning Myrtle joined him, and he thought about going back under the Cloak just to see if he could find a way to eavesdrop on their conversation, hoping against hope that Malfoy was questioning the ghost about what she knew and was confirming that Harry really, actually did do what he said he did in second year.
, as a person, as a student, as a Gryffindor, and as… other things Harry was. If he let his thoughts stray toward the Dursleys, he was filled with shame and could quickly become convinced his parents would have shared their views. If he ignored thoughts of the Dursleys, he could daydream of them accepting him completely.
I have a couple more chapters mostly ready to go, just need my pathetic attempts at last read-thrus. I'll try to get them up as quickly as possible. Meanwhile, I will slowly be replying to comments.
Harry shook his head emphatically. "No. No way. I can't do that."
Harry mouthed, "
shone brightly around them, and Harry felt his face and neck heat up.
Cedric had apparently decided to bring Cho Chang, and Harry couldn't help but notice how good they both looked. They also looked happy and like they couldn't quite believe they were there with the other. Fleur was with Roger Davies, who was practically drooling after her, and Krum was with…
Hermione eyed him then sighed. "It's rather cold out—"
Harry nodded to himself, figuring it was another attempt at a greeting.
Harry deflated a little, not realising his hopes were rising until then.
Harry was sincerely concerned that he was either going to hurl or start cursing people on sight.
"Is there anything I need to know?" Luna asked, tilting her head.
He was at the end of his rope, he really was. Some of the anger he had been feeling for days and days seemed to burst through that tightness, leaving his chest shattered.
Harry now patted Ron's arm as they tried to comfort him, but he caught Hermione's eye over his head and mouthed, "
Malfoy was already hurrying to the dungeon. He sent Harry a sharp wave over his shoulder without looking back.
Harry didn't listen, however. He had been thinking about it since he first got the idea in the library, and he still wasn't sure how to approach this. He was not deluded enough to think locking himself and Malfoy in a room literally no one else in the castle could get into and begin interrogating him about his father was in any way, shape, or form even slightly a good idea. He also didn't think he was coy enough to hide any interrogation in regular conversation. He could admit to himself that he didn't exactly have a knack for subtlety.
Instead of the hardest one,
"I… I think you're confusing me with Seamus."
"Malfoy, this is gross," Harry blurted, effectively distracted again and wrinkling his nose.
"Blast-Ended Skrewts."
"Obvious hiding spot," Harry lied. It was actually a really decent one.
Malfoy stood in front of him, lips parted, face blank, and staring at Harry with eyes that shone with an emotion Harry couldn't place. Slowly, what Harry had just spewed—and to
Harry raised a disbelieving eyebrow at him.

"Potter… Potter, this is glorious. This is the best news I've heard in weeks!"
He looked mournfully across the lake.
It was tolerable. Or, used to be.
"Parseltongue," Harry grinned, knowing it was a button for the blond. "The sinks will open up and reveal a hole."
He found himself chewing his nails as he mulled over both negative and positive reactions from those closest to him. It wasn't that he hadn't ever thought about telling people before, but faced with the blunt suggestion of it made him feel like he would rather have to fend against a dragon again.
"So, you're thirsty and might have a fever." She put a hand to his forehead and frowned. "Actually, you are a bit warm." She waved her wand over him, and he fought a shiver. He had to be imagining it lately—sometimes he thought he could
"Malfoy," Ron snarled.
Draco bit back a groan, cracking his neck. The skin pulled tight, uncomfortable, and for a moment, it was like his lungs had to remember to accept oxygen. "I don't think so. Professor McGonagall will probably just bring in owls or cats or something for the practical."
. Harry figured Malfoy had been prepared for the interference of them and did some kind of complicated charm to prevent it. It made him wonder why Malfoy decided on
"Now that Mr Potter and Mr Weasley have been kind enough to act their age… I have something to say to you all.
"That should be fun," Luna said.
"Really."
They left the kitchens with arms full of sweets, and Harry laughed along with Ron about how easy it was despite Fred and George always making it seem like a grand feat. He was happy at the way Ron took a shining toward Dobby and hoped with Hermione that the other Hogwarts elves took to emulating Dobby rather than Winky.
Also, I really want to thank everyone who gave suggestions, critiques, etc. It helps improves this baby, and I appreciate it so much!
Harry didn't know what to call the moment. It felt tender, precious almost, and Harry felt a pulling in his chest and a pleasant twisting of his stomach. His heart fluttered, and he ached. A new kind of longing tugged at him. He wished he could capture Malfoy like that, with the lights and the snow, in the dress robes with his soft-looking hair. He wished he was an artist, so he could paint it and pay loving attention to every line, every colour, every shade.
He stood in horrified silence, mind desperately trying to process everything.
"Do you even know how to dance, Potter?"
"Of course."
When he barked at Harry and Luna, asking what they were doing there, Harry answered truthfully, "We're here to talk to the ice sculptures."
Malfoy sighed, but he did sound a little pleased. "Of course not. I'm sorry to cut this short, but we are on limited time, I'm afraid."
look like fun."
"—snotty git. I dare him to make another badge after today."
"Yes. It looked soft, didn't it?"
At one point, they did get into an argument because Harry was mostly convinced that Malfoy wasn't even trying anymore and was just bossing Harry around and making him speak Parseltongue for the hell of it. At another point, they got into an argument because Harry had dozed off while Malfoy was examining individual pillars for any differences among them, which Harry thought was pointless.
"Immediate and at hand" that you'll see in this chapter is something my mother always told me in times of great stress. It's become a mantra of mine lately. Right now, my mother is really sick and in a skilled facility, so if anyone wants to pass along encouraging words, please do. I will buy a card for each, writing your well-wishes inside, and send them to her. (I can't physically visit because of COVID… )
Ron, who apparently already knew this, came back with the rest, and they began chopping, mincing, smushing, and dicing and trying not to mix up their each mortars and pestles.
all this tosh shoved onto me. Go ahead and hate me, making me miserable at every turn, making me feel like shit over things that
"Don't you agree, Harry?" Ron was asking.
, not with his confession and quite literally living in a dorm with other boys. She was strict— fair, but strict—and oh god, what if she made him move? He doubted she would move him in with the girls, but what if he had to dorm by himself—everyone would figure out why, and—
Ah, so he did know about the sword. He repressed a wince. "No. I'm
That night, the three were in the library. Draco had already done his Transfiguration essay and Charms homework, but as usual, he got it done quickly because he knew his two closest friends were going to need re-teaching and a lot of help.
He thought about what it would be like. If it was simply okay to be this way, and everyone knew and accepted it. Better yet, what kind of paradise it would be if people didn't just assume he was one way or the other. All of it would be so much easier if there was already an allotment for someone like him, and he simply had to take his place. The world would still spin, and no one would blink an eye.
If anyone sees anything that needs immediate correction, please lmk!
Ron slunk back, clearly miserable, then attempted to wrangle Ginny who announced she was going with Neville. She went to leave to grab some supper, but Harry followed her, stopping her outside the portrait hole.
"Obviously," Malfoy sneered back.
**NOW the pic shown at the beginning of this is my own! I draw. It is supposed to be Harry, not even especially for this fic, and I did it by hand and scanned it. I know, I forgot the glasses. Also, it is inspired by a model, not an original design, but right now for the life of me, I can't find him again to name him. It's the first time I've drawn in a long while, but I am hoping to get back into the swing of it. I will not violate this beautiful site's Term of Service by mentioning more. If I become confident in my reliability to produce something timely, I will link to a Tumblr where you can find more details. Meanwhile, I mention this because one: I shamelessly want compliments, and two: I also want to see if my style and ability is something anyone is interested in.
was taking Hermione. Harry was curious, too, but seeing her become shy and admit she didn't want to be made fun of always stopped Harry cold.
He grinned and pulled Ron into a hug just as tight as Hermione's. "Don't do it again, wanker."
When before Harry couldn't take a step without noticing the boys, suddenly the castle seemed to be filled with nothing but girls. Giggling, whispering, blushing girls who, unfortunately, were noticing Harry right back.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione tried to stay to prevent Skeeter from locking Hagrid down to an interview, but Hagrid waved them along. They went dejectedly.
It was much, much better than just him in a towel. The dress robes gave the illusion of his shoulders being broader and his joints not so knobbly and bony. His hair was mostly dry, sticking up every which way because he was an idiot that didn't comb it while wet.
Malfoy's sneer slipped a little, probably at Harry not rising to his bait like he usually did. "You mean you don't trust your idiotic parents are watching over you?"
It probably wasn't the brightest idea. It would probably backfire on him in ways he couldn't begin to fathom. Malfoy would probably find a way to use this to make Harry's life more miserable.
to hover with Malfoy's as he began to work. Harry could tell by the set of his shoulders—and Harry
"Probably a lot, too, right. Each of them horrific?"
Luna shook her head. "I'm afraid not."
How in the world could he even consider taking a bloke to the ball when he couldn't even entertain the thought of telling his friends that he was...
Harry—laid out in front of him made his cheeks burn and his chest constrict.
But then when they met up once more, Malfoy was surprisingly neutral.
"Fuck you, Malfoy!" Harry barked loudly.
Harry began tuning out the lesson, simply writing down the answers as students gave them and they appeared on the board. He only really gave his attention when Malfoy was called on to answer.
The worst of it, or so it felt when it happened, was that Malfoy had apparently ruined wanking for Harry. Because no matter what Harry tried, if Harry actually got in the groove of it and started enjoying himself,
Harry couldn't stop his grin if he tried. "Probably wouldn't have worked with
for quite some time. It is not common practise in the wizarding world to be so open as I understand some Muggle communities have become. I have been discreet in my inquiries, but you can rest assured that if you so choose to do so, you will have the support of the staff."
. Ron was apologising, asking for forgiveness. Harry was only hesitating because he was worried about losing Ron again, losing him because of something else that wasn't in Harry's control, try as he might.
Harry quickly decided after the first minute of climbing that from then on, Harry would go first because it was a struggle not to focus on what part of Malfoy was directly in front of his face.
"Malfoy, Harry?
if maybe unusual, even to the strictest woman Harry knew. He hated that he felt anxiety at the sight of Skeeter.
Harry had no idea what to think of that or where to put it in his mind. Panic flared in him, and he held out a hand to stop Luna. "We're not… Luna, we're not…
"I…" his voice broke. He swallowed. "I don't have to kill it. Just get past it."
"I can," Harry said with conviction. "I can take you right into the Chamber of Secrets."
"Stupid boys," she huffed, clutching both of them.
He bounced a little on the balls of his feet, pulling down his sleeves over his hands. He could see his breath, and he squinted up, hoping for more snow.
"We'll save you some water," Vinny said seriously.
Harry ducked his head and took a deep, deep breath. He had
As successful as Harry had hoped that odd night was with Malfoy, the next day, Malfoy acted like nothing ever happened. Harry didn't know what he expected, but he had expected
Ginny eyed her sceptically, but Harry readily accepted.

was the one holding them up. Harry rolled his eyes and began to lead the way.
"Oh… Wait, who?"
"Sirius!" he cried, rushing to him. He had seen Mr Diggory do this over the summer, so he was able to quickly deduce it was a fire-call. He grinned as he dropped in front of his godfather who was looking tremendously better than the last Harry saw him. "How are you?"
"Indeed," Malfoy agreed, "and I for one am quite sick of it."
"Malfoy," Ron replied, waving his hand. "He's eating his own words right now! The stupid idiot didn't even have a good insult."
Harry chuckled again and leaned into her. "Thanks, Hermione. For… for everything."
The Drumstang ran drills in the afternoon. Harry assumed that they wore much thicker clothing wherever their school was, but here, even at the start of December, it was warm enough for them to dress down in sleeveless shirts and sometimes shorts. Some of the drills were obvious duelling styles and positions, contorting their bodies this way and that.
"Whatever I say…" Malfoy's smirk deepened. "If you could just make that your motto, Potter, then this will be an excellent partnership."
the Chamber of Secrets? This has to be a trick."
He briefly thought of entertaining the idea that Harry
. It felt as novel and freeing as learning he was allowed magic.
"Good luck, Harry!" Hermione whispered. "You'll be fine!"
And now, Malfoy. Harry really didn't like the way Hermione narrowed her eyes at him each time they glimpsed him at Hogsmeade. He was an idiot saying anything. None of it
Harry huffed a tired, barely-there laugh. "Sure, Malfoy. Whatever you say."
This made Hermione chuckle a bit more normally then the giggle she did earlier. "You both look great as well. You ready to dance in front of everyone?"
"I found it best, when unsure of what another's reaction will be, that introducing the theory unbiasedly usually offers plenty of opportunities to observe initial reactions."
"Not right now," Malfoy answered, sounding distracted as he too examined the hole.
"What kind of stuff?" she responded brusquely.
Ron released him, visibly relieved, and Hermione startled both of them by bursting into tears.
Harry was shocked to see Dobby, who had just recently been hired on at Hogwarts along with Winky.
Malfoy narrowed his eyes. "How?"
Harry caught her before she could get to the library, their afternoon lessons completed for the day.
"If they did, they didn't ask it loud enough," Harry agreed. "Okay, take a step back. I'm going to open it."
Soon, they were led into the Great Hall and to the champion's table that also held the judges. Finding Percy Weasley substituting for Barty Crouch was a surprise, one that turned slightly unpleasant as Percy ensured Harry sat next to him. Percy greeted him with a swift and pompous, "I've been promoted," and Harry privately resigned himself to a boring meal conversation.
Actual gasps could be heard through several parts of his little—and
Despite Draco deciding to resolutely avoid thinking about what he did and why he missed class, he could admit to himself that he felt a million times better. His back and legs were still itchy, but it was tolerable. Vinny and Greg attributed his better health and mood to his hospital wing visit, and he didn't correct them.
Hermione laughed though it sounded slightly tearful. "Oh, Harry! I'm so glad you're okay." She pushed away from him and grabbed his arm, inspecting his shoulder.
"There you are," she said stiffly. "Off you go. A good lunch will do you some good."
"Forget it, Hermione!"
"I know. But," he shrugged again, "she's not hurting anyone and enjoying herself. I won't stand in the way."
The next morning, Harry woke up already horrified because his body, apparently, had decided to get revenge for the wank-ban and give him a wet dream about
"I know, right?" Harry huffed with a small grin. "But it's not really in use anymore. Mostly because of Moaning Myrtle. She was the victim, you know, the girl that died the first time the Chamber was opened."
to please instead of expecting it handed to him. Likewise, Snape always gave Malfoy more of a break—than
"I'm sorry, Harry. I'll be more careful."
He pulled Vinny's essay over when he saw him copying from a wrong page, spelling the paragraph away and pointing him to the right passage. Draco began shaking his leg, watching and nodding in approval as Vinny dutifully began copying.
No, most of his wanks were just his body reminding him that it existed and had needs. He would do a shower routine almost daily, and occasionally, like tonight, plan out a wank in hopes of… oh, he didn't know. Stress relief? Was that a good enough excuse? Honestly, he just wanted to feel good. He loved the toe-curling experience of climaxing.
"It's Skeeter. I already don't trust it."
"Right," Malfoy said, sounding like he one-thousand-percent didn't believe him.
He released a relieved sigh, leaning back enough to splash his face and slurp water from his cupped hands. He then stuck his head under the faucet again. The cold water felt incredible to his hot skin, and he didn't know how long he stayed like that, only pulling back enough to splash his face again or to gulp on the water. By the time he got his wits together enough to realise what he was doing—and that it was
Harry smirked to himself and wondered how difficult it was on Malfoy.
Draco closed his eyes. His skin felt hot. Sweat beaded his brow. It was just the potions, he told himself. The heat from making the potions. That had to be it, that was why he was extra thirsty right then, that was why he felt hot. Just the potions.
"I mean, even Potter's been asked."
Professor Flitwick, alert at finding a student waiting in the staff room before breakfast, nodded sharply. He told Harry to wait there and left.
He actively ignored the exciting flutters in his stomach when once returned to Gryffindor Tower, he told Hermione he was going to call it an early night, grabbed his Marauder's Map and Cloak, and carefully snuck back out as the prefects were hoarding in the last of the straggling Gryffindors.
Also: the reason why there are drops of nicotine in the potion here (of which there are no known ingredients) is because nicotine is something that opens and encourages cognitive thinking. Let's take for an example, most everyone knows nicotine to be in cigarettes and other tobacco products. When stressed, people addicted to nicotine will crave more of it because stress limits cognitive thinking. For a further example, thinking BBC's Sherlock and "three-patch problem"-when faced with a problem Sherlock cannot automatically deduce, he relies on nicotine to encourage his cognitive thinking. The reason why I made it an ingredient is that the Drink of Despair (potion Dumbly drinks in book 6 in the cave) induces fear, etc, so imagine how more powerful that is when your cognitive abilities are put on the extreme.
"You know as well as I do that Parseltongue can't be taught."
Harry immediately tensed up, balling his fist and spending to where Rita bloody Skeeter was leaning against one of Hagrid's fences.
"... Okay," Harry accepted. "So, you'll go with me?"
"What?"
to be different. Quickly, he began to wonder if he had just dreamed their time in the Chamber. If that was the case, he knew he was a lost cause. Because he would have labelled that a pleasant dream, and yet it featured him being sneered at and insulted.
that was cheering for him. Hundreds of people gathered to watch him face a dragon and were cheering his victory.
Malfoy took another step toward Harry, still looking around so easily, Harry assumed he didn't realise he was doing it.
"I knew it," Hermione hissed again, but she did not sound happy.
"Therefore, you have no right to decide my comings and goings. Arguably, as the Slytherin between us, I have more of a right to return here than you do. If you don't want to be involved, then don't. Just teach me how to open and close the entrances, and I'll take it from there."
Blaise raised an eyebrow and turned a big spoon over in his hand to show Draco a distorted reflection. Draco was indeed very pale.
"Harry—we've just got to grit our teeth and do it. When we get back to the common room tonight, we'll both have partners—agreed?"
But then his words sunk in.
, "So good, Harry," let alone whisper it to him gently while running a hand through Harry's hair.
"Of course."
Draco blinked up from his thoughts. Remembering where he was, he answered clearly, "This is more advanced—the next step. Before, we had an equal understanding of what the object is and will be. In order to transfigure multiple things into one thing each, if you have a more in-depth understanding of what it will be—the rabbit—so, you won't need as much understanding of the first object."
how he could tell just by the set of his shoulders—that Malfoy was pulling all his attention on his task. Trying not to feel confused, Harry focused on his own.
Hermione bit her lip, eyes searching for him but then focusing on the ground. "O-okay, okay. I'm sorry. I was just saying, that's all. I didn't mean—"
"Mate."
"See-see, the last time, er... " He looked at Malfoy and winced seeing his thoroughly suspicious glare. "The last time, we sort of… flew… out…"

straightening his spine. He cocked an eyebrow at Malfoy.
He added '
His voice was muffled and tight as he spoke through his hands, "You… you…" he seemed to give up, turning fully to put his back to Harry. "You… you found Salazar Slytherin's legendary Chamber of Secrets… in a girls toilet, where you fought Salazar Slytherin's monster… with the Sorting Hat that somehow gave you a sword… and you left the beast dead, by having a bird fly you out…"
Harry grinned widely at her, wishing he had words to express himself, before hurrying into the tent and swallowing repeatedly to dislodge the lump in his throat.
The front entrance to the castle was now covered with fairy lights with many bushes, stone statues and ice sculptures, the tell-tale noise of fountains, and many paths dotted with benches. Harry supposed it was meant to be romantic, and he wondered what it would be like, to be there with someone he had romantic feelings for.

Malfoy looked slightly unsure of him for a moment but visibly reaffirmed his stance. "I sure as Merlin don't think you've been telling the truth."
Luna hummed. "He does take being pureblood as a responsibility. I imagine even if he didn't want to react, his parents would ask him to."
Harry just grunted, pulling out his Divination work from his bag.
he spewed it—sunk in, and he let his head fall, humiliated and exhausted, and now terrified of how this was going to be used against him. He immediately tried to think of damage control, maybe threaten hexes or something, but he didn't think he entirely had it in him.

But then again, what if it was? What if he was actually self-destructive, searching for ways to ruin his life because he was an attention-seeking liar who thrived on drama and wanted to be special so much that… what was one of the deaths Malfoy came up with? That he would choke on the realisation that he was exceedingly average?
It made Harry frown at Malfoy, knowing he looked as miserable as he felt. "Most of the things

essay and turned it in with a grin, which Professor McGonagall briefly returned.
"I'm not sure whether they hibernate or not. Thought we'd jus' try an' see if they fancied a kip… We'll jus' settle 'em down in these boxes…"
Harry grinned at him. "You don't take Divinations, do you?"
It took them two hours.
As always, Malfoy was already waiting, but this time had been waiting inside the loo, which Harry only found out when, ten minutes past their meeting time, Malfoy stuck his head out and hissed at him. Trying to convince an annoyed Malfoy that one wasn't late but was actually just stupid enough not to
"No? Interesting. Another Gryffin-doe then? Or will you be gracing the other houses with your—"
"Because you care about my opinion oh so much," Malfoy said flatly.
It pulled a real chuckle from Harry, which seemed to surprise Malfoy. Some more of his guard was dropping, and encouraged by it, reminding Harry of his daydreams and the dream the night before, Harry gave him a real smile. "I know. There's another entrance down below you might find more acceptable."

"A friend. We're just friends, Malfoy."

"Remember there'll be plenty of—"
Ignore everyone else. Just focus on the first task."
Malfoy was looking back at him, expression still hidden in the shadows. This time, Harry couldn't make out his tone as he said, "How… Slytherin of you."
Harry did practise allowing himself his 'abnormal' thoughts. Giving himself that blanket permission, however, opened him up to a whole world of distractions.
What was annoying Harry the most was Ron not letting up on
"—since the tail has been in the water this whole time, obviously. The colouring looks the same as I've read it described, so that's a good sign, I suppose. I'll have to check exactly where these creatures start rotting—"
"Partners?"
I've seen a ton of fics wherein Hermione has gay uncles. I don't know where it started nor currently find an example, but it's a headcanon I personally like. It's also a useful tool for fics like these. When I originally sketched out his coming out since with her, I had meant to put more backstory behind the uncles, but I forgot. I have a few other places I could put it in, so we'll see. (And of course, I gave the gay uncles backstories!)
mess. As he tossed the gel back onto Dean's bed, Ron groaned loudly.
"Right."
Malfoy seemed to consider him, then huffed, dismissing Harry's argument. "If it wasn't you, who the bloody hell was it?"
"Illegal?" Harry tried again, putting his own annoyance in his tone.
They stood in silence, Harry steadfast looking at the dark ground. He clenched and unclenched his fists, mind racing of how Malfoy was going to use this, pushing away his dream, his daydreams, all of it, and trying his best to remember the
Grumbling to himself, he made sure he was cleaned up and his

The second time it happened, he had been trying to think of Cho, wasn't getting off, became unbelievably frustrated, and just wanted to finish, alright? He let go of control of his thoughts, rode his hand until it was over, then as he was coming back to earth, he ended up crash-landing
Malfoy was silent a moment. "Magical animals, like Herbology, can be a large area in Potions."
As far as Harry could tell, Snape gave no actual signs one way or the other—until Malfoy went to add drops of nicotine. Snape held up a hand, and Malfoy stilled. Nothing seemed to happen. Then, Malfoy straightened and used his wand to adjust the flame underneath. Snape lowered his hand, and Malfoy added the drops.
"It means that if you don't know who exactly was behind opening the Chamber and who exactly it was that helped him do it, I honestly don't think I should—nor would you want me to be—the one to tell you."
Harry could have killed himself on the spot. Comparatively, his abnormality was the least of his problems at the moment, but perhaps it had daunted his mind for so long, it apparently took precedence. It was like in the face of having
They stayed like that for a while, in silence and just embracing. Then they slowly continued their way across the bridge as Harry told her about accidentally blurting it to Professor McGonagall, to which Hermione gasped, and all about what she said when he tried to backpedal the next day, to which Hermione laughed merrily at him, and even the conversation about the Yule Ball. By the time he had finished, they had reached the end of the bridge and found a comfortable spot on a small boulder to look out on the castle.
"Yes. Harry Potter needed a platonic partner for the ball, so we became friends." She smiled brightly, and Harry was reminded that Ginny warned Luna was bullied. It saddened him to think she was only doing this because she wanted a friend, any friend.
"Fine!" Seamus shouted, making everyone jump.
"I really don't care that much about this bloody creature," Harry whined. "It already tried to kill me once, please stop trying to finish its job by going on about its digestive system…"
"I think so. Want to dance some more?"
He entertained himself a little bit by pretending the letter in his pocket was actually from his parents, telling him to damn what others thought and ask a bloke to the ball. Remembering the actual letter in his pocket depressed him enough to move to one of the windows, curling up on the ledge and thudding his head against the glass.
"We don't know, that's why we're asking," Hermione said, stepping up beside him as they entered the castle.
"Oh, right. We haven't covered that yet though."
He nodded quickly. "Yes, Professor."
"Hello, Professor," Luna greeted. "Isn't this lovely?"
He turned, hurrying down the hall. Harry, and he still wasn't sure why he was bothering, chased after him, skidding in front of him to stop from going. "I'm not having you on. I promise. It is in there."
"Not directly," Malfoy interrupted. He had lifted his head more, but he had let his hair fall around his eyes, keeping his face mostly dark. Harry couldn't figure out his tone. "Only a strong deflection or dissuasion would work. There are only, at most, three vulnerable parts to a dragon that kills it."
"And Mr Potter? I'm proud of you."
Pansy was getting harder to get rid of. He had predicted this when she kissed him at the Yule Ball, but it didn't make it any easier. He had been happy to go along with it. She was tolerable, after all, and very entertaining. He knew she cared for him too. His parents didn't much care what he got up to during school, as long as he knew that after schooling was finished, he was to marry a respectable pureblood witch.
"I do!" Malfoy frowned. "In fact, I do more than my own share, I'll have you know."
Draco grinned, feeling fond. "Because that's what we did last year for you. This second round, we have to try to learn it properly because you don't know what the thing will be ahead of time."
"Just… remember that I didn't pick its entrance. That's all on your mate Salazar."
She tilted her head again. "Is your life at risk?"
"Pointy git," he said to himself.
"Okay," Malfoy repeated.
"Great," Harry sighed. "Thank you, so much. You wouldn't happen to know of anyone for my mate, Ron Weasley?"
"Hey… Malfoy…"

wizards and more than little sadness as Dobby immediately attempted to punish himself for saying anything.
Harry clenched his jaw.
Draco had never been a very patient person and now wasn't any different. He saddled along the wall, avoiding the other students who were noisily getting packed to leave, and went over to the sink basin. He turned on the cool water, and immediately, his heart picked up in excitement. He ignored it and barely restrained just sticking his head under the flow. Instead, he cupped his hands under it, loving the coolness, then ducked to take a few healthy gulps.
Some of the Beauxbatons boys wore their thin uniforms tighter than probably necessary, and they all seemed to sit so gracefully, even when they were shifting in their seats being rowdy during meals.
"Tonight," Harry decided. "After curfew. Meet me where the heir let his messages in our second year."
If Hagrid was raising illegal blast-ending skrewts, that could potentially spell out big problems. Specifically, since the school of governors already had put Hagrid on trial for the previous year—his
Hermione patted his arm and refocused him on their potion. Ron was still squeezing Harry's own arm.
"He should know!" Ron argued. "And bloody Malfoy. If Hagrid goes back up for review—"
Malfoy's lips quirked. Harry tried not to focus on them. "Wow, Potter. You are the most ungraceful person I have ever had the misfortune to meet."

"Warm," Blaise mocked, tone thick with posh.

"What's that supposed to mean?"
He sighed. "I… like boys."
Then, "That's a nice name. Is it Muslum?"
"Seemed more interesting than the other options."
They picked a path and began walking down it, comfortably silent. They didn't get far before they hear a familiar voice, and Snape and Karkaroff came around the corner. Karkaroff was obviously concerned about something, and Snape looked as ill-tempered as ever, blasting bushes to catch snogging students.
"Potter?" he whispered. "I swear to god if this turns out to be a trick…"

"Right, we must be off," Draco smiled at Pansy, quickly gathering his things.
feeling. For the first time in a long while, Harry really let himself remember that horrible night, and he could feel proud. He stood his ground, and he won.
Ron was admittedly getting on Harry's nerves as well as Hermione's. Ron had become fixated on the fact that Hermione had a date and by consequence, seemed to be noticing more and more things about Hermione, like her now straight teeth or that she carried too many books that her bag should be able to hold. The former, Harry already knew because it was kind of obvious, and the latter Harry never bothered to think about.
Harry pressed his lips together to keep in an incredulous laugh. If he didn't know any better, Malfoy was also trying not to laugh. Harry's own voice was a little shaky with how tight he was trying to make it. "Well… when you put it like that…"
Harry was darting back into his dorm and getting dressed before he could properly think about it. He snatched up the miniature Horntail, hoping against hope that its mere presence would give him some semblance of the courage he had the day before. What was

They had reached the middle of the bridge, and Hermione leaned against the side, biting her lip. "Well… to be perfectly honest, Harry, I wasn't sure how people would take it."

broom. Mine is still the best in the market, in case you forgot."
"Do you enjoy being this much of an idiot?"
Idly, he wondered what Malfoy would think of that.
The dragon keepers were rushing over to reign in the Horntail, and Harry turned his broom toward the entrance where he saw Professor McGonagall, Professor Moody, and Hagrid running toward him and beckoning him over. He landed smoothly just in front of them.

"Thank you."
Harry was too busy processing Malfoy to notice the boy himself getting closer. He felt a sharp kick to his shin at the same time the words, "What are you gaping at, Potter," broke through his daze.
"Oh, right." Harry blinked again. His feet automatically carried him out of the room and to his next lesson, but Harry could honestly say it wasn't consciously done.
He didn't sleep a wink that night.
The first was Malfoy not showing up at all. Harry wouldn't be surprised if he didn't. If Harry was in his shoes, he would consider not going on the off-chance it was a prank of some kind, designed as a concentrated affront to humiliate and cause as much emotional damage as possible. Or like the prank Malfoy pulled in their first year, trying to get him caught out after curfew. Harry would still have gone, though, because his curiosity was always getting the better of him, even if it would get him in trouble.
" Harry shouted. "You're
Harry was taken aback, nonpulsed at the real venom in Malfoy's voice. Harry had definitely hit a strong nerve, and he didn't like how Malfoy's face was completely in shadow, ominously, but Harry could still feel his hateful glare like a physical weight. Every single one of Malfoy's walls that Harry hadn't even known had been down now slammed back up. Harry knew that the two Slytherins favoured each other over the other professors and students, but apparently, he had no idea the extent of it.

and apparently, a few other spells at the door, including a locking one, Harry surmised when he tried to push it.
"Ha!" Ron tried to cheer with his mouth full of food.
Malfoy, however, looked more annoyed. "That's pushing it, don't you think?"
Harry gulped again.
"Thank god," Greg groaned, slamming his book shut. The noise made Draco wince a little.
"Wish I knew!" Harry yelled. "Wouldn't be the first time someone tried to kill me, though, but it is the most creative, I'll give them that.
Harry felt triumphant. Here, right in front of Malfoy, was irrefutable proof that Harry hadn't been lying. Here was the prove that Harry, at only twelve, had gone against Voldemort's memory and a basilisk and
"They've really outdone themselves, I say," he said, looking around.
Harry blinked before catching on. "Yes! Yes. I, personally, find them very, er, interesting."
Well, there was hardly a cause that could get Harry to pay attention to Potions, but now that Harry was allowing himself a more wandering eye, he was able to channel his impulse to watch Malfoy into observing his potion-making skills.
go to the Hospital Wing."
Making sure no sarcasm was in his voice, he said, "No, sir. You're right, I was being idiotic. I was not giving my full attention to the potion, which you had warned us several times is highly dangerous. I was putting myself and everyone else at risk. You trusted us to be wise enough to make this responsibly, and I was betraying that. I apologise, and I will do better."
He rode that high right up until he crash-landed the next night he met up with Malfoy.
"It is what it is? And what exactly is 'what'?" Harry asked tightly, still not looking up.
"Sure, but… are you thinking he was the one who put my name in? Because if he did, he's a really good actor. He seemed furious about it, and he wanted to stop me from competing."
The hour made that almost impossible. No one was around, and Harry had no idea where any of the professors' quarters were. In the end, he decided to wait in the staff room, purposely trying not to remember the time he and Ron were secreted there and overheard about Ginny being taken to the Chamber of Secrets. Instead, he focused on the miniature Horntail squirming unhappily in his pocket, thinking about what to do or say.
Malfoy frowned at him. "You are… odd," he said quietly, voice a little strained.
"Ooh, excellent." Luna's eyes lit up. "I wonder what stories they will tell, whether from their depictions or the water."
"Er… Let's do the one Ginny showed you when we open the ball, yeah?"
They spent that Sunday in the library researching everything they could. They piled their table with every book they could about dragons and any subject that might sound useful against them. They skipped lunch, and Harry was set to skip dinner too—he really did not have an appetite. Hermione didn't argue but ducked out to grab a quick supper herself, most likely going to grab a sandwich or something for Harry later.
setting. He needed to see Malfoy grinning in the summer sun, see him laughing across a table from Harry over a shared meal, see him proud in victory having won a Quidditch game, see him alight in excitement over something he was passionate for, see him—
He knocked on her office door, wondering if this was worth it, but his self-preservation was making him stand his ground anyway.
," like Harry was truly the vain of his existence, then went inside the toilets again. Harry thought about following, and seeing what Malfoy was going to do, but before he could make up his mind, Malfoy was audibly casting a

When he was in the peak of being uncomfortable, being terribly thirsty, and hot, and itchy, and sore, and obsessed with water, and all things, it felt like he had less access to his magical core. He got tired a lot more easily—
Harry licked his lips and nodded.
"Thank you, Luna. You're a life-savour here."
"Some girl, I suppose."
"Huh? Oh. Well, I went on…"
friend, Harry was in there all the time now too. He didn't know how often Malfoy was usually in the library, but he was all too aware of him now, and he was there just as much. He didn't seem to actually check many books out, just seemed to borrow a few, make a ton of notes and then return them. He caught Harry watching him every now and then, but that was okay because Harry caught him watching almost just as much.
"I figured you'd want to see this before going into the Great Hall," Hermione said sympathetically.
Draco froze. "What?"
"Right. Thank you, Professor," he said. He straightened, wanting to walk in there with his head held high.
Some of the Slytherins hissed, but Harry only had eyes for Malfoy. He watched as an actual, genuine grin spread on Malfoy's face, and he himself just grinned wider as Malfoy visibly pulled back his own and forced his face into a scowl. "Breathe the fresh air while you're still alive, Potter. We'll see what comes in the second task."
Keeping his plans.
"But he was released?" Harry asked slowly. "Why?"
"... and now Hagrid's just shown me what's coming in the first task, and it's dragons, Sirius, and I'm a goner."
Malfoy scoffed. "Then you'd be the only one."
Ginny introduced them after their last lessons of the term, and she had whispered warnings to him as they walked to their meeting place. Apparently, Luna was bullied quite a lot for being unusual, most often called Loony Lovegood, which immediately made Harry want to come to her defence. Ginny then warned him that the bullying didn't really seem to faze her. She explained what the
Harry blushed. He felt like one of those forward fools from one of Dudley's programmes, swagging up to a lady to ask if she was single. Judging by those sitcoms, a slap in the face should shortly follow. Instead, inexplicably, Harry and Malfoy shared small smiles.
Harry chuckled. "When Ron asked you to do that for us, you shut him down."
Harry nodded, thinking. "So… it is possible that she could have told Voldemort about the tournament, and now a Death Eater is here at Hogwarts. Do you think he's here on Voldemort's orders?"
"Yes," Malfoy snapped. "Why? Was this just a ploy to lure me out or something? Because you could have hexed me outside this morning—we were quite alone then."
"Okay, this, see?" He pointed. "This is different because
"Sorry," he mumbled, stepping around them.
"Harry!" Hermione hissed while Ron's face went red.
"Earth to scarhead!" barked a whiny voice, and Harry blinked over to finally see who was next to Malfoy. Pansy sodding Parkinson, in yellow dress robes, was hugging Malfoy's arm. Because
Harry rushed outside to the grounds and tried to find a place where absolutely no one would see him or bother him. He ended up selecting a small area among the boathouses, lake and castle. A good size boulder blocked his view of the rest of the grounds, and there weren't any windows at that part of the castle. He wasn't worried about anything from the lake seeing him, of course.
"Why just friends?" Malfoy suddenly asked, eyes back on Harry and very sharp.
Greg mumbled something that sounded like a complaint about not liking cats. Draco's fingers twitch to reach for his travel goblet. Just thinking about it made his mouth go dry, and he consciously told himself not to lick his lips.
Harry bounced once on the balls of his feet again, hands in fists in his pockets. "Yeah," he agreed, but he couldn't look away from Malfoy.
Next, Harry attempted to show off his miniature dragon, still a rather impressive doofer, if he thought so himself, but Malfoy was altogether
Harry let go, feeling lighter and freer than he had in weeks. He grabbed his Firebolt and the golden egg and followed his friends out of the tent.
"I didn't say those things," Harry said, immediately defensive.
Harry had taken qualities of himself that scared him, worried him, concerned him, and he used them not just for the greater good but to save his best friend's sister.
"Shut it, Malfoy," Harry growled.
Malfoy wore dark dress robes that were open at the top to reveal a lighter waistcoat and a deep coloured bowtie, and just how fit Malfoy was. The waistcoat hugged him like it was basking being able to wrap around his flat chest and run down his smooth stomach. The robes buckled at the hips, spotlighting his narrow frame. He somehow looked

"Pardon me," he said, smoothing down his tie.

people all along. Harry had always had Hagrid, from the day he turned eleven, and even though he hated the idea of what Hagrid could think of him if he knew Harry was… Still, Hagrid, currently… "Yeh did it! An' agains' the Horntail an' all, an' yeh know Charlie said that was the wors'—"
Malfoy seemed to not have expected that, looking surprised, then his expression soured. "Defending your girlfriend, already? You must have it bad."
Blaise seemed briefly surprised at his venomous tone but merely shrugged and looked away.
cancelled then curled onto his side. He was put out; he couldn't help it.
He felt ridiculous, but he couldn't say he minded.
There was a muted squish sound as Malfoy did something with the tools, hunched a little over the beast.
Harry stopped dancing, grabbing her shoulder. "Hermione, what's wrong?"
Now, he felt like he was trying to prove to himself that maybe Malfoy was…
"Because first of all, that would be mean and cruel of you to lead someone on who doesn't actually have a chance with you. Secondly, you would be miserable all night, pretending to be interested. Thirdly, she would be miserable because she would be able to tell, you aren't that good of an actor, Harry," she added to his scowl. "And lastly, it would take the stress off the entire situation if you brought someone who understood you are just going as friends. You could end up having a good time."
"Harry: I’m gay!
He didn't know which he wanted.
"HOW CAN SHE—SHE CAN'T DO THIS!"
All the boys were in different states of undress, mostly chatting about the ball and expectations for the night. Dean and Seamus, however, had been having a heated but quiet discussion. They had been fighting the last few days, which was unusual for them.
They didn't speak again, not even to say goodbye, for the rest of the night.
"Malfoy."
"Potter."
Harry didn't notice Hermione first mostly because of the lack of bushy hair. Instead, her hair was straight and in an elegant style. Her dress robes were also elegant, a light blue, and she was blushing fiercely but looked pleased.
Apologies for these being later than expected. Since Corona took my job, and therefore my only reliable access to my personal drive, I've had a hell of a time trying to get my old computers to work (this one's over a decade old). But I did it!
"What, Malfoy?" Harry snapped.
It may only be self-interest in the Chamber of Secrets on Malfoy's part, but Harry really did have
"How about we dance? Want to dance some more, Viktor?" Hermione asked, shoving her drink at Harry to hold.
"Five points to Slytherin. Now, anyone who has done the reading will be able to tell me the poison's main characteristic… Brown?"
"You're making me nervous," Hermione said.
He had only seen Malfoy a handful of times since the term ended. He half expected Malfoy to reach out to go into the Chamber before Christmas, but that was obviously silly of him. He had seen Malfoy around, with his friends, laughing and clearly excited about the hols— and the ball, probably. There were a few times Harry caught Malfoy looking at him, but Malfoy always looked away so quickly, Harry couldn't guess why or what he was thinking. There was a really tense moment when Malfoy overheard Ron pestering Hermione about who her date was, and the ensuing mockery, but Hermione proudly held her own, faking Malfoy out by greeting Professor Moody behind him. Malfoy looked extra bitter at that, but somehow, still, there seemed to be so much less heat in the exchange. Only this time, oddly, from both Malfoy and Hermione.
, it would help somehow. If Malfoy had to concede that Harry might have had a chance just to survive, forget winning, then maybe Harry really did.
people in the audience who—if not directly on his side—wanted him to live.
He cracked his neck again, feeling more uncomfortable. Scratchings of quills were starting to grate his nerves. His arms were itchy, and his toes were sore for some reason—not actually the muscles, maybe his nails? He blinked a few more times, willing the blurriness from his eyes, willing himself to read. Some people were whispering, and why did some people have to turn pages so loudly?
He squeezed his fists, feeling himself blush again. This time, he had to look away. "It's called a television. Or telly for short. Computers are similar, but on them, you can play games, communicate instantly over long distances, and… well, other things, but I've never used one, actually."
"How did you know I was there?"
, I can't explain it. I mean look, look how dry my skin is," he showed her his hands, "and my lips too. I can't go more than a few minutes without wanting to just chug water—I keep having dreams about water—which sounds insane, I know, but trust me, it's so much weirder experiencing it."
Guessing this had something to do with the sword fighting, he shot Ron a half-hearted glare and shuffled up to her desk. The professor waited until everyone had gone and the door was shut before facing him. She peered at him sharply, assessing.
"What?"
"There's something wrong with me. I know there is."
"Hold on a second, Malfoy—who the hell says I'll bring you back here?"
Anger spiked in Harry, and he jumped up, glaring. "I

"You guys sure you're okay?"
, Potter? Loony Lovegood? And here I thought my yule couldn't get better."
She froze and narrowed her eyes. Harry looked around and was surprised but hopeful when he saw Malfoy was quite alone.
"... Right…" Parkinson breathed.
" She stomped her foot, cheeks red. "Who does he think he is?!"
Krum's bushy brows flew up.
"That was a dismissal, Mr Potter," Professor McGonagall broke into his thoughts.
Draco eyed him, eyed the dark Chamber, seemed to want to ask something, but then he just nodded sharply.
"Why?" Malfoy asked, raising his wand slightly like he was ready to attack. Harry felt like reaching for his own, but he had a small suspicion that if he did that, they would just fall into old habits and really would hex each other. "Why would you, Potter, show
"Crap…" he whispered, scrunching up his face in light of his own poor planning.
One thing Harry knew for sure, however, was that there was no way he could take a bloke to the ball.
"Huh?" Harry asked, turning back to his friends. Ron looked furious, and Hermione was darting eyes among Harry, Ron, and the Slytherins. Harry turned again to follow her gaze only to see Malfoy turning his own head again back to them. Harry fought a blush.
LOLOLOLOLOL I wanted everyone to see!
"Gone, sir," his valet answered.
Eventually, they too had to make the trek back up to their dorms to get ready.
Ron opened and closed his mouth. Harry knew an apology was coming, and he wondered briefly if he even needed it. Privately, he thought he didn't. If Ron was willing to pull his head out of his own arse, Harry would gladly welcome him. He would
Eventually, Harry went back up and got some sleep. He woke up with a start and a shout to Dobby just inches from his face. As hardly anyone had gone home for the holiday, his shout woke everyone else in the dorm. Luckily, the Christmas presents at the foot of their beds quickly made them forgive him.
"Microvision?"
Harry was mildly curious but shrugged. If she could give Harry the chance to not say anything about himself, he could do the same. "Fine. Who for me then?"
Harry could do this. He just needed to focus on what was immediate and at hand.
"They're ice."
"No, I didn't
Ps, I hope everyone has picked up on Malfoy's jealousy in both chapters? I find trying to express how Malfoy feels in only a Harry limited narrative a really fun challenge, but do let me know if I'm doing it wrong. I'm always happy to take another swing.
"Blast," he hissed. Now he went and looked like a fool to Professor Snape.
"Potter, the champions have to come down onto the grounds now… You have to get ready for your first task."
was his date. And no matter what Malfoy said, Harry had seen her constantly swoon over Malfoy.
Hermione made a slightly annoyed sound. "I'm not saying this right." She resumed walking, and Harry followed, a step behind her. "What I mean to say is that I don't think there's anything wrong with being gay—"
"He's in there."
She gave him a look as if she couldn't tell if he was being purposefully ignorant, but was displeased regardless. "If it is your wish for your partner to be male, you can."
"How did you know?" Malfoy repeated.
Merlin, and Harry really did just ask Luna if she saw Malfoy's hair in front of him…
"Perhaps the Weaslette? Her family probably can't afford the proper robes, but I doubt you would mind, would you, Potter? Chummy with the Weasleys impoverished ascetic."
"You did!"
Malfoy somehow had slipped a note into Harry's Charms textbook, and when they met up again to go into the Chamber, they were back to a tentative normal. Harry had asked him if new creatures really were under private review, and Malfoy had scoffed and called him an idiot. It wasn't a direct answer, but Harry felt better about the whole thing. From there, they restricted any conversation to only the basilisk and the Chamber.
It was both a familiar comfort to Harry, to have a consistency somewhere in his life, and also disappointing. He wasn't sure what it was for Malfoy, however. Harry quickly learned that a simple, "I didn't mean it like that; I was complimenting you," shut Malfoy up more effectively than any silencing spell. Only for him to become a little nastier in return.
With a sigh, Harry unrolled the scroll.
"Mmh, yes, that—which still has Malfoy blood."
Malfoy huffed. "You're an idiot, Potter. Have you really thought I've been cheating all these years?"
"As ready as I'll ever be," Harry grumbled as Luna pipped up about being excited to teach Harry some of the traditional dances.
Eventually, Malfoy moved to his dorm room then reemerged a moment later. He strolled purposely out of the common room, seemingly unstopped by everyone else in there, and Harry couldn't stop a grin as he watched Malfoy expertly yet cautiously make his way to where Harry was.
"I'm…" He gulped. It was two words. Two freaking words. He could do this.
Madam Pomfrey opened her door and narrowed her eyes. "Yes, Mr Malfoy?"
But here he was, overloaded with emotion and running from, what, a
"Joy as always, Potter," Malfoy sneered, walking away.
_______
"Mr Longbottom?" Professor Snape chose to torture instead.
Harry shrugged, unable to stop his grin. He could tell Malfoy about almost being sorted Slytherin, but he figured he would save that for a time he actually could see his face. That was if he would ever tell him. "Anyway, here's where we stopped. The skin was still formed, see? Lockhart took the distraction to grab Ron's wand. He thought he had it all planned out too. He was going to curse us, go back up and maybe try to lead the professors this far or something, claim that he was too late to save us. Thing was, you remember how broken Ron's wand was all that year?"
the next day that Potter was lying-liar who tried to use his lying-lies to lure innocent victims like himself into girls' public toilets and get them into trouble. The thought actually got a very begrudged grin from Harry because wouldn't that be a hell of a follow-up for today's article.
Merlin, he felt insane just thinking about it, but there were serious conditions witches and wizards could get that affected their magic, their magical performance, or their magic getting sick itself. Rare, but possible.
On Christmas Eve night, Harry laid in his bed watching the moon slowly trek across the sky. He waited until he knew the commons would be empty, everyone asleep, before he snuck out of the dorm. Staying awake on Christmas was a habit he formed when he was little, wanting to stay up to catch Father Christmas and ask how he can start being a good enough boy for presents. He had long since stopped believing in Father Christmas, but the habit of wondering how to be better stuck.
"Right—these dragons," Sirius said quickly. "There's a way, Harry. Don't be tempted to try a Stunning Spell—dragons are strong and too powerfully magical to be knocked out by a single Stunner, you need about half a dozen wizards at a time to overcome a dragon—"
He balled his hands and shoved them under his thighs where he sat cross-legged.
"See, after he told us what he did, he tried to
Malfoy made a small sound and mumbled, "I didn't know that."
much that you don't trust me?"
to him, as if Malfoy was going to forget. Then he followed Hermione into the library where he pretended to study but was instead anxiously waiting for when it was time to meet him.
YEAR, MALFOY!
"What eloquence to match your observational prowess," Malfoy drawled.
"What?"
Harry held up his free hand. "It's a joke, I promise. Sorry! You both look great, though." He looked Krum up and down and quickly looked away before anything caught too much of his attention. "Everyone is looking great, well… you haven't seen Ron yet, but he tried."
"Malfoy," he nodded to the spot he knew Malfoy was secreted and pushed his way into the loo. Malfoy followed right as Harry was opening the sink.
"I'll guide you. It's quite easy."
"This isn't over," Hermione warned.
Harry made a face. He was curious but decided if he was still curious later, he would ask. For now, however: "Well… sorry I didn't think about the smell, but welcome to the Chamber of Secrets."
Harry, Ron, and Hermione had breakfast together in the Great Hall and spent the morning in the commons with the rest of the Gryffindors, showing off their haul and challenging each other to games. Dinner in the Great Hall was a proper feast, the house-elves outdoing themselves.
"Yeah, I know, I just saw."
Harry felt affection for her roll through him. She knew. He knew she knew. Hell, she probably had known, but here she was, carefully pretending to not know. He shook his head, feeling oddly comforted by this. And by the information. She bluntly said it wouldn't change how she felt about him, and he was so incredibly grateful.
Harry rolled his eyes. "Oh, you deign to allow me, huh?"
THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS!
Professor McGonagall nodded sharply. "Just be sure to find a partner, Mr Potter, and if it is one that would be considered unexpected, inform me immediately."
However, tried as they might, they never found Aarav and his son.
"Karkaroff. Harry, he was a Death Eater. You know what Death Eaters are, don't you?"
Harry didn't know what was safe to say or not, so he decided to risk being right about what the shifting of Malfoy's feet earlier meant. "You tell me about yours, I'll tell you about mine."
"Huh?"
Draco was
"They aren't antics, I
"Bertha Jorkins?"
Professor Snape gave a sharp nod, moving to walk away, but paused to frown at Draco. Lowering his voice, he asked quietly, "Are you quite well?"
"You expect me to believe that not only did you slay Slytherin's monster with a Gryffindor sword, but you did so inside the Chamber of Secrets whose entrance is in a girls' toilet."
know me better than probably anyone else in this damn castle!"
"Ah, crap, Malfoy," he said, rubbing his face. "Bloody hell."
Oh, if he thought his face was on fire before…
Movement down the path caught his attention, and he looked over to see none other than Malfoy. Only, Malfoy was alone, shoulders slightly hunched and hands in his pockets. Harry turned fully toward him, wanting to take that moment to observe him more, but his own movement seemed to have caught Malfoy's eye.
"Er… pushing what?"
," Harry stressed. "I really, really need to talk."
"Indeed. I didn't expect to see many of the younger students."
"I can't go on like this. I can't do this."
She didn't believe him when he said he had already drunk a couple of
"Wait… Wait… Malfoy, are you saying you brought Parkinson as… just a friend?"
Malfoy rolled his eyes. "Did you scream out all your vocabulary? It means
first, then figure out
Hagrid had thrown himself bodily on the last skrewt, and as he wrestled it into a lead to tie it back up, he asked, "Who're you?"
It was a weird dance, but Harry didn't expect anything else. Harry was slightly embarrassed, but when they passed Fred and Angelina, who were dancing so aggressively and wildly people were giving them a wide berth, he decided it could be worse.
Myrtle let out a heartbreaking wail and soared into her toilet. Overall, it was a rather tame exit for her.
Harry tried very hard not to laugh at him. His robes were terrible and clashed badly with his hair. Ron was able to use a severing charm to at least get off all the lace, but it left the seams uneven and a little matted. Still, no lace at least.
Malfoy let out an undignified snort and his head dropped down, shoulders shaking.
"Such betrayal," he breathed, hand coming up to cover his mouth. Two of his guards had come in at the signs of the Killing Curse to drag away the body, not looking at him. Nicholas ignored them, too, to come to sit by his fire.
"No trick," Harry shrugged. "And I don't know. Look… you don't have to, you know. You don't have to come with me. But I really do know where the Chamber of Secrets is, and I really did fight the basilisk. I just want to prove it to you."
Was Harry trying to somehow give Malfoy a chance? Was Harry not only willing but also wanting to reach out—to see if Malfoy would reach back, to see if there even was a possibility of a middle ground?
Harry tried to not react, and Malfoy snorted unpleasantly.
"What?" Draco shrugged, adjusting his focus to organising his things to put away. "I am."
did he have those thoughts about
Snape appeared to be towering over Malfoy and his potion, but as Harry watched, he noticed Malfoy hover a hand over whatever he was about to drop into the cauldron before dropping it in. Malfoy had lifted his head up slightly, as though assessing the professor's reaction to whatever he was about to do. The same thing happened before he pulled something over toward himself to do something with, and then again before he added it.
"Oh," Luna gasped, realisation dawning clear on her face. "Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot about homophobia."
"Why tell me anything!? What's your plan here, Potter!?"
was the only word he could think of for a moment.
"He…?" Malfoy led.
Harry, equal parts confused as curious, met eyes with Malfoy. Malfoy did a face as he followed his Slytherins, but Harry couldn't decipher it.
Ginny cleared her throat, stepping up to them again. "It'll be formal dancing, though. Specific steps and everything."
He had no idea why he was doing this. He really shouldn't be doing this. But dreams and thoughts aside, showing Malfoy exactly what he did to the basilisk sounded both satisfying and helped give him more courage about what was to come with the tournament.
Nicholas snapped his head to him. "Excuse me?"
Parkinson smirked at Lavender over her shoulder. "A deep brown colour, Professor."
"I take advantage of opportunities."
Malfoy, however, usually got second and third follow-up questions as well. He was doing that this time as well, and Harry leaned over to watch Hermione. Those questions, she had to frown and clearly think about it. She had more of a tell that way, her face frowning before lighting up and raising her hand. He looked back at Malfoy and Snape, and Malfoy didn't appear to have any particular tell, but his voice did come out more slowly and measured.
"They've left. They'll already be in hiding. He's protecting that… that..."
"Here," Harry said, pushing the whatever he was slicing toward Ron and pretending to lean over his book.
"What the fuck?" he asked himself.
Harry found himself abruptly sad at the thought. He hadn't realised he was becoming attached to an identity he couldn't even admit the words for. Was he so determined to be controversial, stubborn, and
"No as well."
Snape trusted his class enough to begin their potions to sit at his desk and go through what Harry guessed were essays, but unlike usual, he kept getting up to do circuits around the room. This, of course, made them all more nervous, but from what Harry could tell from Neville's whispers to Hermione, the more he did this, the more frightened Neville was getting about the dangerous potion in general.
When Professor Moody danced by and complimented Harry's socks, Harry proudly told them that Dobby the house-elf handmade them for him, which led to him explaining to Luna who Dobby was. For the first time that night, some shiness slid in her features when she asked if harry was willing to introduce them.
The most pathetic part, Harry concluded, was that either way, Harry was clearly someone to whom his sexuality was important, a literal defining factor, if he was up at Merlin knew what hour thinking about it in a loop.
welcome Ron. But if push shoved, would Ron always welcome him?
Malfoy huffed, clearly unimpressed. "I
Myrtle nodded and sniffed. "If I was alive, I still wouldn't go!"
"Malfoy. Parkinson," Hermione said diplomatically.
Neville audibly gulped.
"Yeah. But, so am I."
"Okay, okay. The entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is… in there," he gestured.
Ron and Hermione had waited for him, and he ran toward them, bumping into Ron on his skidded stop.
She winced again. "I'm so sorry, Harry. That woman is absolutely horrible!"
Harry slowly looked back up at him through his lashes, keeping his head down, suspicious. "... Okay?"
"Do what?"
Draco jumped sky-high, making an indignant squawk at the voice suddenly to his right and hands on his. It was Pansy Parkinson, who had apparently slipped into the seat next to him. She stared at him with wide, shocked eyes. In embarrassment, Draco glanced around him, seeing several students watching them. He felt his face heat.
Malfoy's slowly closed his eyes, letting out a long put-upon sigh, and he hid his face. It wasn't something Harry expected Malfoy to do, and he wondered if the guarded, suspicious freak that was Malfoy was actually
"I am sorry," Harry mumbled, throwing the Cloak over himself quickly. He barely covered himself before Malfoy was pausing, turning around with his mouth open and obviously about to say something. Harry froze, but so did Malfoy, looking around.
"Oh, nothing." Malfoy shrugged. "Just… working a project." He smirked at her. "Thought he'd like to know the progress."
his face so as not to let Harry know what he was feeling.
put his name in the Goblet and that someone was trying to kill him. Again.
"Ooh, trouble in paradise?" Malfoy cooed. He was back to smirking and held out a badge to Ron. "Well, here you go, Weasley, enjoy. I've got loads. But don't touch my hand, now. I've just washed it, you see; don't want Weasley slime on it."
did ten extra inches on my essay of the Summoning Charm detailing the properties that run parallel from the Vanishing Charm in order to ascertain the similarities and differences in both the theory and practical use that not only—"
"Twent—… Medium-small."
"I don't know, relationship stuff?"
"That's fine," Luna agreed. "I know the common waltz."
generous and sickeningly arse-licking—speech, from both Gryffindors and Slytherins. He could see Ron in the corner of his eye staring at him with his mouth literally hanging open. The room was dead quiet after, and Snape bored into his eyes in that way of his that made Harry suspect he had x-ray vision.
Goosegrass was probably one of Harry's favourite smells—if it was normal to have favourite smells, of course—because it was like a mixture of something earthy and sweet.
compared to
A little further down the path, they overheard Hagrid, who was speaking in a husky voice. It wasn't something Harry thought they should overhear, and he quickly hurried Luna back down the path, passing Fleur and Davies half-hidden in a bush.
"Lasso one?" Ron suggested. "Got any idea who you're going to try?"
(If I mentioned you by name and you don't want me to, just tell me. And if you want to comment but not be mentioned in the future, just let me know!)
He was just settling into this new routine when Hermione snatched up him and Ron one evening and pulled them toward the kitchens. They were scared for a moment that this was one of her S.P.E.W. traps, but for once, it wasn't.
"No," Malfoy agreed, and Harry could just make out his smirk. "But—as I do all my own work, thank you very much—I'm actually quite ahead in that class. I've been practising the Vanishing Charm all week."
He was looking at Harry now, face completely and utterly unguarded. Harry's lips parted as he forced himself to take a breath.
"Today, we will be brewing the potent poison, Weedosoros. Take great care to keep this concoction away from your hands and mouth. If you do swallow some of this poison, immediately proceed to the Hospital Wing. The rest of us shouldn't have to be bothered with your convulsing."
Draco snorted disbelieving at her but uncorked the vial. The smell of the potion hit him hard, and his head jerked back. "Blah, gah, no!" he protested, corking it again. "That smells vile, I can't possibly—"
He was so
"Mr Potter," she said when they reached her, "the champions and their partners are to wait over here." She then lowered her glasses some and gave him and Luna a sharp look. "Miss Lovegood."
"Even so… She's… odd."
"I… n-not exactly…"
"Very good, Miss Lovegood," Professor McGonagall praised. "I'm happy to see you both on the same page," she added pointedly, giving Harry an approving and knowing look. Then she shooed them off to the side where the other champions and their partners were waiting.
Harry thought it was safer if he didn't look, but something bitter twisted in him, and he had to. Sure enough, on Parkinson's thin, pointy wrist was a dark red corsage, and another was sitting neatly on Malfoy's chest.
Krum frowned. "Vhat?"
"Excellent," Malfoy smirked. "I'm picking up the last book I need today. Happy Hogsmeade, Potter."
"Whatever
, oh so noble hero, need I remind you, are the reason why I learned it, to begin with, so you could bring this cheat down here, after curfew, to illegally harvest parts of a rare, highly regulated creature. Don't know where you get off—"
The actual letter was the one from Sirius. He hadn't heard from him since the congratulations on the Horntail (the miniature of which Harry still couldn't find). The elation of the victory, the praise, and the accidental coming-out had been whittling away. The ball and his coming-out to Hermione distracted him, but with that settled, the dangers of this year were making themselves known again.
They spoke at the same time.
Harry blinked, awkwardly feeling as though his expression was now mirroring what Snape's had been.
"... Exactly?" Malfoy led. There was a wet-sounding
"Months might not be enough," Harry parroted Hermione's usual warning right as she opened her mouth. "And no, not the egg. I've just been…" he shrugged, turning to continue up the stairs and resolutely not looking toward the lake, "you know."
Also, a large part of him wanted to wait. See where this went before mucking it up with questions and suspicions.
Draco gave Blaise a thankful look, spooned their potion into a few vials, and hurried to the side table to sort them. So focused again on
"Just…
Harry received several other gifts, from sweets to Mrs Weasley's annual sweater. His favourite was from Sirius which was a pocket knife that could unlock any lock. As he played with it and practised, he realised that with this, the Cloak, and his map, he had the starting package to become a master thief.
Harry jumped, jerking his head to Snape who was directly in front of him. Beside him, Ron was viciously trying to stir their potion, presumably to stop it from getting to the bright yellow it was attempting to become.
He curled his knees up to his chest and, taking off his glasses to have them dangle in his hands, buried his face in his knees. He took slow even breaths.
Please remember I said this started as purely self-indulgent because this chapter is absolutely self-indulgent. It's almost Monday, so I decided to go ahead and post this with hopes of posting the next chapter in the morning which actually introduces more actual plot and things.
"Looking forward to it, Malfoy."
"Oh good," Ginny greeted them. "Um. I was just showing Luna the waltz everyone else will be doing tonight."
SHE—" Harry cut himself with an audible click of his jaw. He stared hopelessly at Hermione.
Luna tilted her head at the sculpture, seemingly waiting patiently until, "My name is Luna Lovegood, and this is my friend Harry Potter."
"No."
I imagine he immediately tried to dose his brain in acid right after the lesson.
, Mr Potter, is a student out of bed who is behind on his homework. You have Double Transfiguration today, and regardless of being a Hogwarts champion
Malfoy considered him. "I'll be very miffed if you cancel."
They had worked later than they usually did, and even their parting words whispered quietly in the wee hours were said with much lighter intent than they ever exchanged. Malfoy promised to let Harry know if he thought of any others and even offered to review his work for Divinations for now on. Harry, wanting to hold onto that night, agreed.
"But clearly that won't happen," Malfoy said, sounding very annoyed. "Because I promised eternal damnation to you if you die before I can finish my work here."
This time, Malfoy led the way. Harry could see his face now, and his lips were parted and eyes huge—and unguarded—as he sent his
Harry opened the entrance without further ado and threw his bag in before jumping after it. He brought with him some of his easier homework and revisions, loathed to give Malfoy an opportunity to see him struggle with his studies.
to his symptoms.
This is a double chapter update, so please lookout for the next. After these babies are up, I'll circle back to comments!
Professor Moody looked happy and proud of Harry, too, despite his magical eye dancing every which way in its socket. "Nice and easy does the trick, Potter."
Another commenter, Elaine_ORoake, said something about the last chapter that has me in fucking stitches!!!
That was it—after Potions, he was going to the hospital wing. Again.
"Oh, don't be so dramatic."
Nicholas had been assuming it was a half-blood, most likely having fooled his son Aarav into thinking she was pure. At worst—at the very worst that he could barely conceive the idea—a Mudblood. He had shivered and quickly dismissed the thought that the mother of his grandson could be a
