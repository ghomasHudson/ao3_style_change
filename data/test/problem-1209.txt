The time passed as the spoke about their time at Hogwarts and about all the different creatures that Draco couldn’t tell whether were real or not. But Luna seemed convinced about it, so Draco just tried to follow along with it.
Potter seemed to have become more comfortable in the small environment of the shop as he sauntered straight over to where Draco was and gave him a big smile.
“Ah! So good…mmm… so tight.” Harry groaned softly. The words were making Draco’s own cock pulse as his pre-come smeared onto Harry’s stomach as they clung together.
“Yeah! Grandma always lets me have more cookies than Papa does, and she lets me go to bed later too.”
I am sure by now that your lawyer has told you the whole story of why Zare picked you at the Gerewhol. You presented to her an opportunity she would not get anywhere else. I understand it was unfair to expect you to actually provide that opportunity to her, so Daneri and I helped her out. Your lawyer may have also told you that Zare and I are now involved with each other, and are quickly falling in love.
Harry nodded. He pulled out his itinerary, presenting the lists of museums, heritage sites and viewpoints his travel agent had recommended. She nodded approvingly at it.
“It might take a little longer for me to resolve this one,” Draco added, accepting the papers Harry gave him. “I won’t be able to take Scorpius to such a hot place, so I’ll have to beg my mother to watch him for a bit. I’ll be a bit delayed in leaving.”
“What if I cast an impervious? Then it would keep all the sand off of you while you’re in the pit,” Harry suggested. Scorpius shook his head.
Deciding that he was missing some crucial information, Scorpius realised it was time to look at Charles Silverthorn’s case file and piece together exactly what had happened in the plot to murder the Minister.
“And I’m guessing that also means you don’t want the potions job anymore?” she sighed, rolling her eyes when Draco shook his head.
“Yeah, we know,” Hermione grumbled. “You don’t want to be set up, you don’t want to flirt with people at the club, you don’t want to use an app or an owl dating service. You just think your soulmate is gonna fall out of the sky into your lap one day, right?”
Draco thought about that. The last seven years had been absolutely miserable, but after this week, things were looking up. He could honestly say he was on his way to being completely happy with his life. If that was really all his mother had wanted for him…
“Draco. Just because you became a Healer through a different avenue than most others does not make you any less of a Healer. We both know that you would have got accepted the first time round if it wasn’t for our society’s lingering prejudice.”
“What just happened?” he demanded. Hassan grimaced, ignoring Harry’s question as he took a steep curve. Harry was nothing if not persistent, however, and he knew it was going to be a long drive. There was no way Hassan could ignore his question forever.
“Did you really?” Draco asked, sounding both amused and awed. Harry bit his lip, feeling guilty for that. Not only had he witnessed what was probably a very emotional moment for Draco, he’d abandoned Luna in the process. She acted carefree enough that she must have still enjoyed the party, but he knew it had probably still felt awful to be left behind like that.
“I think I know you well enough that those things won’t be necessary, Draco. For paperwork’s sake, send me your resume, and I’ll write down this meeting as our interview. Poppy said it would be ideal if you could start sooner rather than later so that she has ample time to show you everything.”
“That’s odd,” the receptionist mumbled. “Um, it seems I don’t have access to Healer Malfoy’s appointments.”
“Yeah, no thanks to Linda,” he groused, though the smile he offered her conveyed that he wasn’t actually mad.
Not that he really wanted to at this point. Having three marriages under his belt felt like more than enough to last him for the rest of his life. Even if none of them had really worked out. Staring out at the dusty roads, he felt a bit of a pang in his heart at the thought that it seemed he was destined to be alone for the rest of his life. He thought back to his previous idea of teaching Scorpius to fly -- while he was sure it would be a wonderful experience, he would have loved to have children to call his own. Borrowing his friend’s son for an afternoon or two didn’t really compare.
"Is there a copy of today's paper here?" he asked, but he turned to find she had already left. At that moment he also noticed the paper sitting on the coffee table, and rolled his eyes at how dependent he'd become on an elf in the past week.
“Oh, I got this on my trip, for Scorpius. I almost forgot it was in my pocket.” He pulled the colourful kite out and enlarged it, before handing it to Draco, whose smile had grown even wider.
As Scorpius read the report for the first case, he managed to finally shake thoughts of his papa and focus on public safety, which was not very high in the Wallackson court neighbourhood, a few blocks down from Diagon Alley. Apparently the overnight Aurors had been called in multiple times over the past two weeks, with reports that cries for help were heard from one of the houses. When they went to speak to the owner, however, he said that nothing was amiss, and he had no clue why his neighbours thought he was in distress. He assured them that he was the only one living in the house, and had even invited them in one time, during which they hadn’t seen anything suspicious. After the 7th call in 10 days, they’d escalated this to the Head Auror, who had apparently decided that Scorpius would get to the bottom of it. With a sigh, he finished reading the file, grabbed his cloak, and flooed out to Diagon, deciding to make the short walk over from there.
“That’s not true. There’s a five-year-old sitting in that outer office who talks about you all the time, and not because you’ve bought him a couple of presents. I already spoil him rotten; he has all the toys in the world. No, what’s special about you is that you care enough about him to stop and talk with him, and in doing so you show him the respect and dignity that most adults never do, either because of his age or because of his family. And if the word of that five-year-old isn’t enough, I happen to know that his father will also vouch for the fact that you’re a very good friend to have, and completely worth knowing.”
“It worked!” The awe seeping through his words. He stepped back further, glad to finally have control over himself again.
He could feel the heat building up “I’m-“ Draco couldn’t finish his sentence before it was too late.
“Yeah, a doe. Quite beautiful if you must know.” Once again Draco felt pride fill him at the thought of his Patronus being such a magnificent creature.
“Oh, I also have some of this I would like you to try out, so do share it with your friend and tell me what you both think” Harry said as he put together one more box with some round type of pastry coated in sugar “It’s Berliners filled with a variation of jam and Nutella” Harry explained.
“No worries. I did get excellent help with my order.” The sudden eye contact and grin on Potter’s face was momentary but hit Draco right in the chest like a punch.
“You’re being far kinder than I deserve, Lovegood.” At that Luna just smiled gently before reaching her hand out in front of her.
Draco just nodded and turned to the back room, Potter following behind him. As Draco started gathering the ingredients, Potter decided to look through the various potion notes this time around.
“It’s… well I guess it’s pretty nice” Draco said, thinking he preferred Harry’s warm and cosy flat over this place. There were too many memories of him feeling lonely and sad for him to properly enjoy the richness of it.
Okay, maybe Draco had stretched it a bit far by including the humble part, but there was no reason for the utter denial Weasley was showing.
“I’m fine. What are you doing here at his hour?” Draco coughed, trying to make his voice sound less squeaky.
Draco could only sigh in relief that no customers were currently present when Pansy waltzed in the door exclaiming loudly, her tinted sunglasses pushed up on top of her head.
“It’s been quite a while since I’ve seen you. How are you?” Pansy walked up to Potter with no hesitation, a welcoming smile gracing her lips.
Draco gripped his broom as he and his teammates rose up into the air. He glanced over at the other end of the field seeing the red enter and joining them high above the grounds. Madam Hooch’s voice boomed out as she started the match.
Potter’s scrutinizing look turned into a frown after a moment. “With my glasses on? No, not really.” Draco rolled his eyes, before pointing to the shelf. “You’re looking at it, idiot.” Draco felt a big relief wash over him as he figured Potter must’ve missed the event all together.
He unconsciously started twiddling his thumbs as he waited for a reaction from Granger. It didn’t take more than a minute before her eyebrows raised in surprise.
wanting to save everyone, huh?” Draco jeered, knowing he was stepping close to one of the many landmines that was wired into Potter.
“Will I ever see the day where your first words in the morning aren’t some sort of insult towards me?”
“What?!” Draco’s eyes widen in surprise with the realization that Potter clearly didn’t trust him at all. Sure, it wasn’t weird for Potter not to trust him, but to think Draco hadn’t learned his lesson from the whole war and all. It made something twist uncomfortably within Draco’s stomach.
Staring up at yourself first thing in the morning wasn’t exactly something anyone would be able to handle with ease.
“How could he have lost to Malfoy?! Harry’s broom is much faster isn’t it? Bloody hell, I won’t be able to live through that gits gloating!” Ron groaned as he stomped off with Hermione at his side.
Before he could say another word, Granger stuttered out a flustered. “I’m sorry to interrupt!” Before leaving in a hurry.
“You definitely would need a reason. It’s not like you’re a bad person.” The way Harry said it like he was just stating facts was preposterous. Had he forgotten all about the years of him tormenting Harry at Hogwarts and the whole war happening.
“Oh, come off it, Potter. You used to be much more fun back in the days when you actually tried to stand up for yourself.” Draco snickered. “It hardly worked, but at least you made an effort back then. Getting old?”
Weasley seemed satisfied with the answer as he hummed in response before starting his story on how they had been ambushed while on watch. Him and Potter together with four other Auror’s had been investigating a notorious group of witches when they had been attacked and had to fight 20 witches at once.
“That…” Draco sat down slowly. Sure, Draco knew what he was there for, but it seemed more difficult to find the right words than he had originally thought. “Potter stopped by my lab.”
Draco took another deep breath and felt himself relax enough for Harry to slip a finger inside of him.
After a while both decided it was time to head to bed, and Harry had put Draco’s clothes to dry over the night.
“For being so supportive of my shop. It has changed drastically because of you. People are even starting to accept me on a rather large scale now.”
“Er… Does it matter what it’s about? I made it happen, didn’t I?” Draco felt exasperation seep through his words as he couldn’t understand why Pansy was acting like she did.
“Arms up” Harry said as he placed the apron around Draco’s waist. He leaned forward and entwined the strings around his back and then to the front tying it neatly.
Someone who had become a well-recognised face (if not already so) in his department was none other than Harry Potter himself. Draco wondered whether or not the Auror department only sent Potter out for the most high-risk missions, as he seemed to be the one to always come by with a new load of ruined gear.
Then it changes. Draco feels himself wanting to scream as he sees Voldemort standing in front of him. But he doesn’t scream, instead he lifts his wand up at the same time as Voldemort raises his. The surge of power as magic clash with magic makes it difficult to stand upright. They’re both trying to overpower the other. He turns just in time to see the last horcrux being destroyed, and as Draco lifts his wand again, he succeeds in overpowering Voldemort. He snatches his wand into his own hand and watches as Voldemort starts to dissolve into nothingness. He can finally breathe again. However, as he stands there in the wake of the battle, he takes in the view of some of his fellow students who had bravely fought yet hadn’t made it through. The guilt washed over him. He didn’t understand why, but he felt like it was all his fault. He should’ve saved them.
“I forgot my clothes, so I was just going to get them. Oh, but you should change as well” Harry said as he took the glass from Draco’s hand and grabbed hold of Draco’s sweater about to take it off.
“What?!” Draco was outraged and didn’t care to stop and think about how he was probably playing right into the redhead’s hand. “I didn’t care at all about that! I’m glad he didn’t shake it back. Who would’ve even wanted to be friends with an idiot like him?”
Peering into the casserole, Draco saw a mixture of vegetables simmering. Potter grabbed a pan and started heating it. “Steak with vegetables and rice.”
“I nearly ruined everything! At the manor I almost got you killed!” Draco yelled feeling a lump in his throat making it difficult to keep his voice steady.
“Yes, thank you ‘Mione. We’ll be counting on you then.” Potter said gracefully, either not sharing Draco’s dismay or just being able to hide it very well.
If Potter had been famous before the war, it was nothing compared to his popularity now. All eyes would probably be on him throughout the year and mistakes would be easily spotted. Draco supposed it reminded him slightly of his own situation growing up at the manor. However, the risk of punishment seemed non-existent when it came to Potter. The guy had always been exceptionally good at getting into trouble and never seemed too bothered about it.
“Hm… Yeah, thinking about someone special then? Perhaps someone with a black mop for a hair who is coincidentally a seeker as well?”
The position was awkward and all the more frightening with the forced proximity. It was almost laughable as to an outsider it would’ve been difficult to discern if a heated love scene was about to ensue, but only if you didn’t have a front row seat to the blazing glare of one Harry Potter.
“Oh! Yeah, I was lucky to even get a taste of them. My friend loved them. She told me to send her some boxes once in a while” Draco said, making Harry chuckle.
If Potter had thought that Draco spent an entirety in the bathroom, he didn’t comment on it. Instead, he gathered the documents together and went into the bathroom, using only a fraction of the time Draco had spent.
“It’s fine, I get to try out some good pastries so it’s well worth my time” Draco chuckled back. He felt a bit more relieved at how normal Harry acted.
At the end of class, they were given another long essay to write, making the students groan in dismay. Draco gathered his stuff and with a quick glance over at Potter, he exited the classroom trailing behind Granger and Weasley.
“I always assumed you were against breaking the rules. Brewing our own potion like that would be illegal.” Draco gave her an incredulous look.
It only took a second as Draco didn’t realise one of his idiotic co-workers had decided to cram a bag right beside his desk, with some tools sticking out of it. He felt himself lose balance as his foot got stuck. He tripped and to his horror the only thing to hold on to was none other than Potter himself.
Draco just stared at her wide-eyed for a moment before he could compose himself and look away. He didn’t manage to find any sort of comeback to her words, and it didn’t make it any better that he felt heat rise to his ears. He couldn’t discern if it was shame or a blush creeping over him.
“Nope! Your drink and pastry combining skills is making sales go up, so I won’t let you pay for doing a great job”.
They both packed out their things in silence. It was an understatement to say it was awkward between them. Draco tried to pay it no attention and got his things sorted before heading down to the common room where Blaise and Pansy were waiting for him.
“I’m sorry.” Harry smiled slightly before he lifted his hand to Draco’s cheek. “I’m also sorry for taking so long to come to a decision. I think I just considered it too much and got ahead of myself. I can’t say for sure that we’re meant to be, but I’m already pretty certain I like you quite a bit.”
Draco wandered off quietly into the brewing room, not able to stand the friendliness between his best friend and his damned crush. He hated himself for not being able to act as confidently as Pansy, but he couldn’t help it. After the war and after everything that followed, Draco had a much harder time suppressing whatever it was he felt for Potter. He also couldn’t hide behind their old animosity anymore, which was making everything much more difficult to handle. Now he felt like he became this weird, unnatural version of himself whenever Potter was around. It was like he became timid and overly aware of every move he made, and he wasn’t able to stop it. The double-meaning of Pansy’s words had also taken its toll on him.
Harry had spent most of the day going through the conversation he had with his sister earlier. Sure, he thought he had already properly thought it through, but maybe he needed to think about it a bit more.
year in order to allow former students a chance to take their N.E.W.T.s. Most classes will be held together with the 7
Harry kissed back more intense this time, making Draco feel light-headed. He felt Harry’s hands sweep down his chest and slip under his shirt. His fingers trailed up his stomach, making Draco shiver. Harry pulled the shirt over his head, Draco shuddered at the way he was looking at him. He could feel his own arousal as he wanted to explore Harry as well. Sure, he had seen his body before when he was switched with him, but to be seeing it from this perspective…That was something completely different. He tugged on the shirt, and Harry seemed to get the gist of it as he pulled it off, revealing the toned body that had been hidden beneath the clothing. Draco felt his own hands reach out and start to explore the defined chest and broad shoulders.
Potter had complimented him, saying it wasn’t long now until he would be able to do it. Just had to properly focus and find the strongest memory he could. It had put Draco in a good mood for several days, where he even joined Pansy in her shopping spree in the places he usually avoided.
“We need a sure way to lure them out. And I mean all of them.” Hermione turned her eyes towards Draco. “How many did you say were after you?”
Amelia sighed before running a hand through her hair “Okay… Think about it like this... How does it feel when he’s not around? Is it the same as usual?”
Draco didn’t want to sit and discuss his prior events, especially not with the two people in front of him. It would only hurt his pride and make him look like some weakling who needed someone to save him. He hated the thought of it. But he also knew that it was vital information in order to find a counter spell. He stifled a sigh trying to look as dignified as possible before starting to talk.
“You don’t believe what she said, now do you!?” Draco cried out as he hurriedly followed Harry. “Yeah, yeah… Although I must say, her statements were quite convincing, you know.”
“Harry’s been in a good mood lately. I always wondered why the sudden change came about. Perhaps it’s because of this shop?” Granger looked thoughtful as she spoke.
“I’m already so used to having you around, I’m not sure I would’ve managed if I were to come home one day and you weren’t here.”
“I’m sorry that I’m not used to acting like a pompous prick, Malfoy!” Potter retorted, earning himself a dismayed gasp from Draco.
“That wasn’t what I meant.” Potter frowned slightly but looked apologetic at the same time. “Well, not exactly at least. Sure, it would’ve been good if we had found them that way, but it would also mean that you wouldn’t have to worry anymore and could start rebuilding without the constant fear for your life.”
“This…” Harry just looked in awe for a moment “I knew you were probably well off, but this is pretty epic”.
Harry seemed to understand Draco’s desperate plea, and with a smirk leaned down to take him into his mouth.
Harry had made several obvious gestures as to wanting Draco to sleep in his room, and Draco was just happy he didn’t have to try and come up with reasons as to why it would be better for him to stay with Harry at night as well.
Granger turned her head and inspected the redhead that was now openly sleeping on the couch beside her.
But Draco’s thoughts soon drifted off, as he felt his eyelids get heavy and the warmth from the fire, combined with Potter’s slow breathing made him drift off into a deep sleep.
Pansy had just huffed loudly. “It’s fine. They just have a potion they need brewed quickly. Also, trust me, Draco, they won’t run away. More than anything, I’m concerned you’re the one who’ll run away. So please stand steadfast and greet them with a dazzling smile, alright, love?” Before Draco could say another word, Pansy ended the floo call with a heavy cough, mumbling about it being late and having to sleep.
“Yeah, well, maybe… We’ll see…” Draco was just tumbling over the words now, barely heard over Pansy’s rush of agreements to the idea.
“You were putting me on the spot so badly, I thought I would die from embarrassment, you know.” Draco chuckled.
It was just fantastic that Potter had once again sent a note asking for him to return it whenever he had the chance. At least he could try to time it with Potter’s lunch break and sneak it in without having to come across the Auror himself.
“Yeah.” Harry was finding the situation rather normal, which was only making Draco even more stunned. “I asked her about the manor, and she told me the situation. To be honest I have already made arrangements for buying it and giving it to your mother, so I might have used it a bit as an excuse to get you to behave around Ron and Hermione.”
“Oh…” Draco had to restrain himself not to roll his eyes as he could hear Weasley’s uncanny lack of knowledge when it came to potions in general, leak through his little murmur.
Draco let his gaze drop as he took in the full pink lips that were slightly parted. Only a few times in his weakest moments had he let his mind wander during the nights at Hogwarts. He had seen those lips up close a couple of times as they stared each other down, but in his dreams, they weren’t pressed together in dismay, but rather looked relaxed and slightly open and inviting just as they did right before him at this very moment. Oh, how difficult it had been to wake up from those dreams.
“I sleep fine. And exactly when did you and my mother become such good friends?” Draco felt a hint of betrayed from his mother for having told Pansy about his difficulties after the war.
‘It couldn’t go on like this’ Draco thought to himself. He wouldn’t be able to pass any of the classes, much less his N.E.W.T.s. if he never got more than a few hours of sleep. The lack of sleep had resulted in his appetite being as poor as it was, making it even harder to function as a normal human being.
Then Draco froze. He felt an icy shiver run through his body as he for a split second believed the sight in front of him to be Potter as an angel. Meaning things had gone far worse than he had previously thought.
“Do you have your wand?” Potter said as he got out his own. It was a strange feeling of habit as something inside of Draco twisted uncomfortably when seeing Potter draw his wand. Perhaps it was the numerous times they had spent hexing each other, or just the plain fact that Draco knew he would not stand a chance against Potter in a proper duel. But they were no longer fighting. No, this time around Potter had offered to teach Draco a spell just out of the goodness of his heart apparently. Draco would’ve never expected the day to come where they would act friendly towards one another and even help each other with potions and spells. How strange.
Draco desperately tried to find some sort of hair products, but he should’ve known better. As if Potter with his unruly, crazy hair would even know that hair products existed. With a sigh he gave up and could only find some comfort in the fact that his hair could never become the sort of mess that Potter was sporting.
Two days in and the homework was stacking up at a rapid pace. The faint trace of hope that the professors would go easy on them had been shattered brutally.
Just then he could hear the jingle of the doorbell as someone entered the bakery. It was already about closing time and the last of the valentine’s chocolates were already bought.
“Who else thought it was like that?” Hermione asked, before answering her own question “It was Amelia, wasn’t it?” She nodded in agreement with herself.
“I’m not even gonna argue with you on that. I’m too relived I can finally think without wanting to puke every second.” Granger sighed and sat back, relaxing into the couch before looking up at Draco.
They entered a bedroom that had a large bed and a fireplace with a couch and table surrounding it. Potter sauntered over to a big closet and pulled out something that probably should resemble a pyjama pants of some sort. As he was just about to change into it, Draco cleared his throat.
I want to thank all of you who's been reading this story and leaving comments/kudos on it. It's been fun writing it and I hope you've all enjoyed reading it! I love reading each of your comments and just hearing about your reactions and what you think of it.
Life was starting to look brighter for Draco and, of course, when things are going well, something is always going to happen.
The golden trio was surrounded by more students than usual this morning. Everyone seemed keen on telling Potter and Weasley good luck for the match. Granger looked grumpy there she sat trying to read one of her gigantic books.
“Malfoy, Weasley.” Draco glance over at Potter who seemed far too happy about his team mate. Weasley, on the other hand, was showing the proper reaction as he groaned and shuffled over to Potter. It was a bit comical to see Weasley that distraught about being teamed up with what was in reality his best friend. He just hoped Potter wouldn’t be too obvious.
Draco pulled out one of the potion books he had stored on his bedside table. He cast a charm that made the letters of the book shine bright in the darkness allowing him to read the content of the book.
“Yes, well I guess I can’t speak for someone who isn’t here. But I think you ought to consider the possibility. If not in love with you, he seems to, at least, be quite fond of you. I’m just glad he seems happier these days. That’s all I wish for.” She smiled a bit sadly at that.
The change from a small smile to a grin was definitely to blame when Draco leaned over and kissed Harry shyly on the lips. He felt himself hesitate as he was still glaringly aware of the fact that his feelings were far more developed than Potter’s.
Draco slumped down on his bed with a loud sigh as he felt the exhaustion rush over him. Having to pretend to be Harry Potter was far more tedious than he had ever imagined. The guy was supposed to have an easy life being the chosen one with all his popularity, but no… Draco had gone through too much disrespect and annoyance throughout the last week. Potter never had a minute for himself, and although Granger and Weasley were trying to help, it still felt like he was constantly being drowned in people wanting his attention.
“It’s okay, come.” Harry said in a hoarse, rough voice. Draco could feel the rhythm becoming unstable and jagged. He knew Harry was close to coming as well.
“Not really.” Potter shrugged, as if the matter at hand wasn’t nearly as serious as it was to Draco. “I just wanted to warn you and make sure you wouldn’t do anything you’d come to regret.”
Both Potter and Draco kept silent for the while it took Granger to pace back and forth in the living room, wrecking her brain. She stopped with an “oh!” and then drew her wand from under her sleeve.
As Draco brushed his teeth’s he realised just how comfortable he had become at staying over at Harry’s place. In a way it had already started to feel like he belonged here more than in his own villa.
However, Potter didn’t seem to let that stop him, as his left hand ran down Draco’s waist before sliding behind him and grabbing his ass firmly, squeezing it. The motion made Draco whimper as he felt his hips buck up and seconds later he was rubbing against Harry in a steady pace while still kissing him like there was no tomorrow.
‘What the hell just happened?’ Draco thought to himself, not really believing the event that just transpired.
Somehow the use of Harry’s first name seemed to do the trick as he leaned back a bit, his eyes filled with overflowing lust as he gazed down at Draco.
“Oh no! Harry didn’t have to. I knew once I met him a few weeks ago. He was so lovestruck that I knew you guys had finally got together.” Luna said in a happy voice.
Potter turned to look at him. His eyes scrutinizing him for a moment as it looked like he was about to say something before changing his mind. “I’m not
“Hey… I forgot to ask you before, but what shape is your Patronus?” Draco suddenly asked after having regained the ability to think and suddenly remembering Pansy’s previous comment.
It did not seem like Potter had noticed anything amiss as he dug through his cupboard and fished out what Draco assumed to be a charms homework paper.
Draco was now certain that he had never been stunned to silence so many times in such a short period of time before.
Ron had been simpler to deal with, his flaring temper and spirit had made it easier for Draco to not feel so completely ashamed of his past, and it had helped that he had been able to do something for Weasley during their encounter, which he had hoped would gain him some favour as well. Granger, on the other hand, what exactly could he do for her?
Both of them were panting heavily, and when Harry looked down at Draco’s lips, he could see that they had turned a deep red and was a bit swollen.
As he placed the note down, a small pile of pictures on the desk caught his eye. His curiosity got the better of him as he picked them up and sorted through them. There were a few pictures of the golden trio together, as well as Weasley’s sister and Lovegood. It looked like the pictures had been taken at one of the pubs in Hogsmeade.
He managed to take exactly two steps back before he felt an unseen force hurl him forward. He felt himself collide with Potter as they both let out a loud “Umph!” at the harsh impact.
Rosie tugged on Harry’s arm, urging him to lower down to her height. Draco could still hear her as she whispered to Harry. “Does he like quidditch too?”
. They’d fought all their lives. Two brief, civil conversations were no guarantee that they would get along.
“I would,” Harry said simply, setting a bowl of hot soup on the island and turning back for the other. “If you asked now,” he added at the incredulous look on Draco’s face. “I’ll admit that I was pretty angry at first.”
His inner sense of righteousness, as Hermione called it, was currently overpowering his discomfort though, and so here he was, lurking around near the entrance to the Department of Mysteries. It had occurred to him that they might have other entrances to their offices—many heads of departments had their own Floo connections, and there were secret passageways all over the place. But since he had no idea where any of those other entrances might be, his only option was to hang about here.
As usual, Harry seemed thrilled to reminisce about Teddy and Scorpius. They spent the rest of the day going through the various albums Harry had collected over the years, stopping only to eat the lentil soup he’d heard so much about. It was well past Draco’s usual bedtime by the time they resurfaced from the albums, but he wasn’t complaining. Now that he’d seen the pictures and heard the stories, it almost felt like he’d been there for the past 15 years.
“Their beauty ideals are very different from what you must be used to back in Britain,” Hassan explained. “During the Yaake, they roll their eyes, and smile very widely, to show off that their eyes and teeth are very white. They also use the makeup to make their eyebrows look wide, and their noses long.”
He put the shirt back in his closet, choosing a similarly coloured jumper to replace it. Trying not to think too much about why he was being so careful about his outfit today, Harry got dressed before deciding a walk was exactly what he needed to clear his mind.
Thankfully, working on the payroll audit seemed to take Harry’s mind off of his date for the rest of the morning. He signed the last page around lunch time, made sure the menu wasn’t mixed into the file and handed it to Hermione before heading out for his lunch break.
“That’s sweet of you, Harry, but I wouldn’t wish that on you. Scorpius, bless him, can be a handful, and since I don’t know how long I’ll be gone, it’ll probably be better for someone who really knows him to stay with him.”
“You’d think having dated an Auror would have taught this guy to update his wards,” Scorpius muttered to himself, before standing up and heading over to the floo.
“Oh, um, I had to interview him for a case this morning. He used to coach little-league Quodpot, he’ll probably know which pitch is good.”
“You found a wing, Papa!” he exclaimed, clapping his hands together. “I think we have enough pieces now!”
Harry could see the relief wash over Draco’s face, and within minutes they were settled in the building area, composing a lopsided dragon with 3 legs, half a tail, and one wing. It seemed that none of the children in the building area had enough pieces, and while some kicked their shoes off again and ran back into the sandpit to look for them, Scorpius was happy to come up with imaginative explanations as to how his dragon survived with it’s abnormal skeleton.
“It’s going okay. I keep feeling like there’s a piece that I’m missing, but I have no clue what it is. I just pulled three more files today, so hopefully I’ll find something in those. It’s gonna be a lot of reading though.”
"Papa, I really want to build a dragon," Scorpius said, staring longingly at the new wing piece that the other boy was flapping around happily.
The groan that replied when he knocked on his cousin’s office door should have been the first indicator that now was not the best time for a chat. And yet, Scorpius still pushed open the door to find Teddy looking like he hated everything, and a mess of paperwork all over the floor.
“Um, you mentioned something like epi… epigeneology?” That sounded right to Harry, but he could tell Draco was trying not to laugh.
“I never met your mother, but your father was a piece of work. I don’t blame you for changing your name, even I would want to run away from having that scum family’s history. Though you’re clearly just as disrespectful. In fact, I don’t know why Penelope hired someone like you, you—”
"If you don't want to go in the sand, we can go see the rest of the museum," Draco suggested. Scorpius bit his lip and it looked for a moment like he was going to agree, but then a young boy jumped up in the middle of the pit.
The explanation made sense, but it was another dead end for Harry’s investigation. Not that he’d had any idea how he would have read the contents of the folder anyway.
“I didn’t realise so many logistics went into sending mail,” Draco mused. “Or that it cost money, to be honest. You’re right that we have an Owlery here, so I guess sending letters doesn’t cost more than the care for the owls.”
Scorpius knew from experience that he would not be able to count the hands fast enough, unless there were very few of them. The courtroom was enchanted to record the results of official votes and present them to the Chief Warlock. The vast majority of hands did seem to be raised though, and Scorpius couldn’t help the little glimmer of hope dancing in his heart. His papa may not have to spend his entire life in prison after all.
Harry thanked whatever deity might be listening that he’d been an irresponsible adult since the end of the war and never actually registered with a General Healer. He didn’t get sick often, and when he did, a bottle of Pepper-Up, some of Molly’s root vegetable soup and a day in bed usually did the trick.
“Well, the culture there is very different. Did you know they don’t even fly? They mostly play muggle sports and use muggle transportation.” Harry took a moment to lament the fact that he hadn’t gotten to play football after all. Maybe there was something to be said for joining a group here instead. “And the lifestyle is really different too, people have to be really careful because of how hot it is. I probably spent most of the trip just renewing my sun protection charms.”
Harry shook his head. “Uh, no, I just… someone was handing them out on the street, I just shoved it into my bag. It must have got mixed up with the audit. Sorry, I’ll redo this correctly.”
“Do you want me to bring lunch for both of you?” Harry offered. He was proud of his boys, but he hated how often they seemed to skip meals when they got caught up in their work. Teddy was especially guilty, but Scorpius seemed to be picking up the habit too.
It felt nice getting into a warm place, as he had been freezing on his way over to the bakery. He hung up his soaked jacket and umbrella and took of his shoes. He realised even his shoes had become drenched from the rain. Great… Draco thought.
“That’s for looking stupid while you sleep, twat!” Draco yelled and quickly got back to his side, briskly standing up and impatiently waiting for Potter to do the same so that he could escape into the bathroom and die a little more inside.
“Well, since you all know about it now, we would really appreciate it if you do help us keep it from leaking out to anyone else until we figure it out.” Potter said, looking over at Weasley who in the end, with a distraught look on his face, nodded.
The scene unfolding in front of him was almost comical had it not been for the fact that it was his own body that had to go through it.
“You sure?” Harry asked a bit surprised. They had taken it slow and steady so far, but Harry couldn’t deny that he had wanted to take it further as well when Draco felt ready for it.
Harry leaned back, breaking the kiss as he stared into Draco’s eyes. “I say, why not see where this takes us?”
First though, he knew he had to write a letter to his mother. She looked far too concerned as he boarded the train, and he knew she would be worried sick at this point. He got out a quill and parchment and started writing. ‘Dear Mother, I have arrived at Hogwarts and everything is well. I will start lectures tomorrow and I assume the lectures and homework will create a busy schedule making the first semester pass by swiftly. I hope you are well and that you don’t feel too lonely. Until next time. Signed your son, Draco.’
Harry stood there for a moment, looking a bit surprised. He had felt like Draco was trying to keep him at a distance for a while now, and suddenly here he was, on valentine’s day, talking about making chocolate together.
“I want you. Please.” Draco felt himself plead as he gazed at Harry who was looking at him with hazy eyes.
“I- I had no idea it would have this affect.” Hermione looked stunned and unnaturally dumbfounded at what had happened.
Draco felt weird as he tied a red and golden tie around his neck. It was outrageous to be draped in the clothes of the Gryffindor house instead of Slytherin. The only relief about it was that it wasn’t his own body who had to wear these colours.
It had taken Harry a bit by surprise when he realised just how bleak the days felt once Draco stopped showing up.
Harry pushed back harder, and Draco felt the bundle of nerves inside of him being hit over and over. The fast pace and relentless thrusting made Draco moan uncontrollably as he gasped for air between the thrusts.
The next days are like a honeymoon in Draco’s eyes. Potter is being overly sweet towards him and hardly putting a limit on the affection he’s showering him with. They also started having a ritual of sorts, where they spent the evenings cuddled up in blankets on the couch, watching the fire with a cup of tea in hand and talking to each other.
It was strange to say the least, as Draco was sitting by the counter watching as Potter made them breakfast. He would have much preferred to wallow in self-loathing in the privacy of his own home or at the very least another room, but the curse that kept them stuck together wasn’t having it.
“Err… Many people like that taste, so… I thought…” Draco fumbled, his face going red whether he wanted it to or not.
“Piss of Macmillan!” Draco jumped at the sound of Weasley’s voice. He hadn’t imagined Weasley would do anything, considering it was still Draco’s body that took the hit.
“Really?” Draco felt a knot in his stomach. Sure, it would be stupid to think nobody would be trying to get a hold of the chosen one. However, it had always been something Draco refused to think about. Now, he couldn’t really get away from it.
“I won’t go all the way since I’m assuming this is new for you as well. I think it’s enough to do this much, and then we can work on getting you used to it later” Harry said as he got out some lube stashed in the cupboard.
“What do you think, Draco? Seems like there’s a new professor for potions as well. It’s gonna be interesting to see how they all teach.”
Draco opened the gift to find a book he had once told Amelia about “You actually remembered that I talked about this?” Draco said, surprised that she actually did.
“Well, I may have put a tracer on you, which alerted me if you were in serious danger. Glad I did it though, to be honest.”
“That’s… Thank you.” Draco said, letting go of Potter quickly and turning his head slightly downwards, not wanting to show the red that was already showing on his pale skin.
“If you’re serious, then let me think about it for a bit as well. I want to properly consider it as well” Harry said. Draco could only nod there he stood as Harry gave him a reassuring kiss.
“Admit it! You enjoyed that more than you’re letting on. How wonderful! Weasley already seem to see you in a more favourable light, so now you are one step closer to getting the prize.”
“So sorry about that.” Harry’s hand was still at Draco’s nape, his fingers sliding through his hair lazily tugging slightly as he did, which sent shivers through Draco’s body each time.
After a while, Harry felt Draco move his tongue, starting to press against his. He was trying to gain some control of the situation, but Harry wouldn’t let him. He was far to eager. He removed his hand from Draco’s cheek and placed it at his hip, pulling him even closer.
“Oh, Draco…” Draco jerked his head towards Pansy as he tried keeping his feelings in check. He didn’t know why he was feeling so irritated and on the defense about this. He could’ve just laughed it off, but instead he started defending himself, which wasn’t helping the current situation.
“Potter is nothing more than an idiot filled with too much raw magic for his own good. One could hardly call it talents.” Draco said, sticking his nose up to scoff at the other guy.
Draco leaned back and gasped loudly as he felt Harry engulf him completely without warning. Draco felt his hips push upwards, desperate for more contact. Harry’s mouth was warm and wet, causing Draco to cry out as he felt the overwhelming pleasure. He tangled his fingers into Harry’s messy black hair, and continued to push his hips up, while Harry hummed around him, sending tremors up his body. He could feel his cock start to build up as he was nearing the edge. He mustered up the last he had of strength as he pulled on Harry’s hair, whimpering at the loss of contact.
“You’ll know soon enough; I’m sure people will be more than willing to fill you in on everything.” Hermione said, laughing even more as Ron gave up trying to get an answer from her.
Draco walked briskly down the alley leading to a large forest. He was glaringly aware of being followed. The moment he reached the forest he sped up his pace further. He knew he had to reach the clearing before getting into contact with the ones following him.
“On what? Handsomeness?” Harry chuckled as he went up the stairs with Draco clinging to him and running his mouth with no concern whatsoever.
Draco sighed as he leaned back in his chair. Knowing his feelings like this, but not being able to express them was difficult. Just the thought of actually saying anything to Harry was terrifying though.
Everyone had gathered out on the balcony looking at the sky with big hopeful eyes. The park below had been set up with various fireworks and was waiting for the last seconds to pass by, signalling the start of a new year filled with possibilities.
“I do hope you’re aware that there’s more to dating than sharing some similarities from the past, Granger.” Draco snickered, trying to take control over the situation. “One would actually have to be attracted to the other person.”
“Also, you’re coming here almost daily, so you’re one of our best customers to start with. You deserve some free samples just for the effort, if you ask me” Amelia laughed.
Draco felt his breath stop for a second as he turned to Harry with wide eyes. “Really?” He said, almost not believing what Harry had just said.
“Um… it depends what you’re talking about,” Harry said meekly, hoping that feigning ignorance might help. It didn’t.
“Harry, he can’t hear me! He’s too far on the other side of the pit,” Scorpius whined. He tried calling his father again, but to no avail. The sounds of the other families were covering up any chance Scorpius had of drawing his father’s attention from so far away.
“I know whatever Papa did must have really hurt you. I know it’s probably really hard to talk about it. I’ve tried to be patient and to listen to you, Dad, I really have. But I can’t forget about it. I can’t stop myself from wondering what happened. I love you… but I loved him too.”
Within 30 minutes, Harrison managed to convince nearly everyone in the room that Draco had in fact thwarted the terrorist group he’d been threatened by. The interview with Silverthorn turned out to be just a snippet from a longer interview, in which he’d rambled a bit about how the Polyjuice Potion hadn’t lasted as long as he’d hoped. Scorpius had been surprised to find out that it had started wearing off before the Minister had been killed. He thought back to his dad’s statement that the Minister had died thinking Harry Potter had betrayed them. This seemed to prove otherwise. Scorpius hadn’t read or heard much about the Minister who died, but he wondered if this Minister had been perceptive enough to notice the changes in Silverthorn’s appearance, and to realise that their murderer was not, in fact, an old friend.
involved in pretending to date Malfoy. What if Malfoy figured out what his plan was? What if the Unspeakables started targeting him? What if Malfoy wanted more from a relationship than Harry was willing to give him?
Anyway, thanks for being there. At first, I thought our ruse would simply be useful misdirection, but your presence helped calm me down.
“Didn’t I tell you not to keep that cloak at the office anymore?” she demanded quietly. Harry rubbed the back of his neck, a nervous habit he’d picked up in the past few years.
Harry didn’t sleep on the ride back to Hassan’s house - his mind was reeling with everything that had happened in their last few hours before leaving the tribe behind. He couldn’t help worrying that he’d really made a mess of things this time. Would they be okay with Harry just leaving and getting divorced from that woman? Merlin, he didn’t even know her name! He knew logically that there was no way they could force him to go back and live with her, but if she wouldn’t agree to divorce him, he might never be able to marry anyone else!
While he hadn’t done very well in either muggle physics or care of magical creatures at school, Harry was sure that flight worked a little differently than the way Scorpius assumed. He didn’t see any need to point it out though—Scorpius was happy, and he and Draco were sharing knowing little looks that had butterflies racing around in his stomach.
“And why would they do that?” Harry demanded. His shock was giving way to anger, and it was only Draco’s hunched form and thin hands that stopped Harry from walking over and punching his ex-husband in the face.
"Excuse me. Is there any way for the children to assemble the skeletons without digging in the sand? Scorpius here isn't comfortable in the sand."
Draco Malfoy did not look as Scorpius remembered him. Scorpius remembered a strong, energetic man who played tag with him in the park, and took him swimming in the summers, and told him funny stories about peacocks and Abraxans. This man, however, was the opposite of strong and energetic. He was hunched over, and it looked like the majority of his weight was being supported by Adella. The exhaustion on his face gave Scorpius the impression that the only stories this man would tell were horror stories.
A young witch popped up at that moment to take their orders. McGonagall—because she’d always be McGonagall in his head—watched her go before turning her attention back to Draco.
"He want to know what you do," Camilla translated. Harry frowned as he realised telling them he was unemployed might not be the smartest move. He decided to see if he could avoid the question instead.
And among all the pictures Harry had taken over the years was one more, older and more faded than the others. It was the picture he and Scorpius had fought over all those weeks ago, the one of Harry, Draco and Scorpius smiling in the garden together. Harry felt a twinge of guilt as he remembered how rude he’d been to Scorpius about it. It was no wonder Scorpius had been so secretive about Draco’s release—Harry had never really given him any reason to believe he’d be supportive about it.
Why would he even care? Draco thought, and that was exactly what he tried to convey next. “Why would you…?” The words trailed off.
Draco just nodded slightly, startled at the sudden intimacy between them as well as Potter’s determination.
They had still not gone all the way. Harry was adamant about getting Draco used to it slowly and would only go as far as fingering him.
Draco just looked at her for a moment. It might be difficult to understand her, but she somehow always seemed like she knew more about someone than they did themselves.
Silence took over as both of them lay there, listening to the cracks and sparks of the fireplace. It had been quite a few months since Draco had last felt this safe and not in need of looking over his shoulder constantly. Of course, lying right beside the Head Auror and saviour of the wizarding world did kinda make it the absolute safest place he could imagine being.
“Sorry guys, should’ve warned you!” Was all that Draco and Harry got from Hermione as she stumbled out of the Floo followed by none other than Ron Weasley.
Potter just laughed as he gazed out over the big green field. “I can assure you I’m taking this seriously.”
“Just had a run in with some dark wizard smuggling gang during work. We got them all, but I was stupid and got distracted for a moment, managed to get hit by one of the spells.”
“He did alright, just a bit slow on the reflexes is all.” She shrugged, Draco sending her a death glare for outing him like it was nothing. “He also had this huge wish about being able to conjure a Patronus, but it’s really difficult, so…”
Draco carefully read the instructions and added a few drops of the first vial into a small cauldron before adding the crushed berries, ginger, a few other ingredients and then finally the last vial which was generously poured in. It took a moment before the concoction started changing colour as he stirred it. The book was old and didn’t say much more than the fact that the colour would change once it was ready. It didn’t specify which colour would be shown, but Draco figured it was right considering he had followed the recipe to point. He also felt out of options, so he decided it was better to chance it on a potion that might work.
“What?” Harry asked, amused at Draco’s reaction. “Tell me, now that you’ve seen mine, would you mind disclosing what memory you were thinking of when conjuring yours?”
“Oh, well… I’ve just been a bit busy…” Draco could feel himself having trouble being convincing with his words.
“Okay…” Draco was about to take the fork from Harry, when Harry held his hand and put it on the table.
“It did always seem a bit too crowded no matter the time you went there. I always felt a little bit claustrophobic there, so I can’t imagine how it would be for someone who’s deemed the most famous person in the whole wizarding world.”
“What?” Draco felt Potter trying once more to lift him, even just an inch away from his own body without any result. “It’s like there’s a sticking charm on us!” Potter huffed as he too relented his attempts at separating them.
Draco dared a proper glance at Potter now that his focus was on finding his wallet instead of blatantly staring at Draco. Taking in the sight in front of him, Draco could feel his mood sour. Why couldn’t Potter have just stayed an awkward git like he used to during Hogwarts? Sure enough, Potter was wearing blue jeans and a loose hoodie which wasn’t exactly showing off in any way, yet somehow his presence was still vastly noticeable. His face was also fairly handsome, that much Draco could grudgingly admit to.
Draco hadn’t commented on it before, because the slight increase in heartbeats and notion of butterflies in his stomach had been rather comforting in a way. But Draco had to know whether or not Harry was just overly easy-going with the touching or if he actually did it intentionally. Draco decided to go for a straightforward approach.
There had also been another issue at hand though, which they sooner or later had to address. Draco had postponed it as long as he could, until Harry one day had blurted out over dinner.
You've now reached the end of this story. I just want to thank you all and let you know that it's been such a pleasure writing it with all the support I've received from you guys. It makes me so incredibly happy whenever I read each of your comments and just hearing about your reactions and what you think of it.
“I don’t know how to get it into his head that I’m happy to help him,” Harry sighed. “He keeps acting like it’s this huge burden on me whenever he asks for help.”
Draco gave him a soft smile, and Harry felt his heart melt at the sight. He moved to the fireplace, and was just about to step in when Draco grabbed his hand and spun him around.
Harry watched, dumbfounded, as Malfoy rushed away towards a group of Aurors herding a cow with a horn down the hall. Why had Malfoy just asked him out? And more importantly, why had Harry agreed?
“I can do it,” he said gently, and once again, the kitchen cleaned itself with a flick of his wand. Harry watched in awe for a moment, before turning his attention back to Draco.
By the fourth time that Scorpius asked Harry to go help Draco during lunch, Harry had learned his lesson about being prepared. As soon as he ended the floo call with his son, Harry wandered into the kitchen and started to work. When the time finally came to go see Draco again, Harry stepped through the floo armed with his largest tupperware box.
“H-hey! Come on, you should sit down!” If Draco hadn’t been in so much pain, he probably would’ve found it slightly amusing that Granger was actually caring enough to try and make him comfortable, despite Potter being in just as much pain. Perhaps he just looked more pitiful hunched over on the cold floor.
“Isn’t he dating that Weasley girl?” Draco frowned, thinking back to the time he had learned that Potter had decided to date Weasley’s little sister of all people.
“Here you go” Draco looked up from his book to see the bakery guy position what seemed like a chocolate strawberry cake in front of him.
“So… Er…” The atmosphere was tense as they sat around the living room table after Potter had tried to awkwardly explain everything to Granger and Draco had just been quiet the whole time, arms crossed, avoiding eye contact as best as possible. “I’ll just tell you what I have so far.”
“You’re an intolerable tease.” Draco huffed, as he placed both hands on Harry’s chest showing slightly, which didn’t do much as Potter barely moved from it. Draco hesitated for a moment before letting his hands trace the lines of Potter’s muscles. It had been difficult enough not to touch him so far, and now it seemed like Draco’s hands acted on their own. Luckily for Draco, Potter stood still, accepting his touch and letting him quench his thirst for touching the chiselled tanned skin.
There was a moment of silence in which Draco took the opportunity to both realise and hate himself for how his statement about letting Pansy handle Potter’s order at a later date now fell through completely. Regardless of her handling the order, he was still the one brewing it, and now Potter knew that as well.
“Because you’re the only one who haven’t been around him long enough to see anything other than…” Potter hesitated for a moment, thinking before adding. “this particular side of him.”
The next couple of days were a hassle for Draco. He first had to deal with Weasley’s excessive gloating that, although he had predicted it, he hadn’t fully comprehended just how long Weasley could keep it going.
Harry had come to the conclusion that Draco might’ve realised that he didn’t particularly like Harry as much as he thought. Perhaps the dates had been bad enough for him to realise something
“I’m not. You’re on the same level as Hermione when it comes to potions, you might even be better than her, and that says a lot. I’m also the one who messed things up for you when we were switched, so I’m gonna set right my own mistake is all.” Harry shrugged.
“What the bloody hell?” Draco tried to take in the event that was unfolding in front of him. What had happened? Why the hell was he currently watching himself sleep? Was he still alive?
Just then Professor Shrew appeared out of thin air, seemingly unaware of the situation. He gestured for everyone to head inside and ready their cauldrons.
“The Auror department is doing their best! Only a few have still not been caught, but the Aurors are working day and night to get them.” Granger said, not letting Draco’s bitterness insult the Great Harry Potter that easily.
“It’s good… So good.” Draco breathed out almost inaudibly. Harry gasped as he leaned forward, messily kissing Draco as he tried to keep his rhythm steady.
It took a moment before Draco realised that he was being carried somewhere. “Where exactly are you taking me, Potter?” Said Draco while taking in the surroundings with concealed interest. He had only been to Grimmauld Place once as a child and hardly remembered anything besides how grim and old it had looked. It must’ve had a facelift though, as the place looked far too warm and Gryffindor-like for it to have been owned by the Black family.
Saying he was shocked was an understatement. How dense was that bloody idiot anyway? Draco felt his cheeks go a dark red and couldn’t help the feeling of embarrassment that washed over him when he realised just how much effect Potter’s actions had on him.
Draco closed his eyes, not giving another reply as he let himself properly come down from the high he had been on. Harry seemed to be doing the same, as they both lay there for a second catching their breaths, while Harry stroked Draco’s back in a slow rhythm.
It wasn’t very pleasant to be at the receiving end of her wand again, but despite that Granger was probably the last to make any mistakes with her spell casting. The fact that any spell aimed at him would most likely affect Potter as well eased the fear greatly.
He had just put the potion book aside and was reaching for the vial to put it away as well, when Potter walked into the room. He scrambled to put it in the drawer in his nightstand. If Potter had noticed something amiss, he did not show it. Draco felt his pulse steady a bit as he got hold of himself, pretending like he was sorting through his homework. He hadn’t expected Potter to be back already, and he was just relieved that he had managed to finish the potion before Potter entered the room.
“Definitely! I believe it’s wise to thread carefully. Hannah and I had to mix this ourselves, so it’s probably good to give it a bit of time so we know for certain.” Granger nodded in agreement.
Amelia had sneaked in a small “tell me if Harry does something stupid, and I’ll beat him up” when she and Draco was lagging behind the group one evening.
“I’m right here.” Draco ignored Potter wholeheartedly as he and the Weasley girl was now competing as to who would break first.
“There’s no way! No way, Potter! I’d rather die before I let Granger see me like this!” The shouting did little to change Potter’s mind, and it was infuriating to have so little control.
It all seemed to go in a direction where Draco learned more and more about Potter’s life and started sharing a bit more from his own as well.
“How charming. You might’ve been good at catching the snitch, but I’m far better at riding a broom.” Draco scoffed in response.
Draco gasped loudly feeling the whole size inside of him. Harry waited patiently for him to get adjusted to it and didn’t move an inch before Draco nodded at him.
“It’s… busy…” He said, not meeting the eyes of the man leaning against the wall of the Malfoy company.
“I think we’ve got it!” Hermione and Draco barged into the common room, which had Weasley jump and spill ink all over his homework. He groaned, while Potter tried to help clean it up which only resulted in making things worse. The few people present in the common room had been eyeing Weasley and 'supposedly' Malfoy sitting together in the common room with confusion, but now people seemed far more concerned when Malfoy started cleaning up Weasley's mess.
“Hold still.” Draco put the paste on Weasley’s arm and made sure to cover the whole burn in a thick paste.
“Okay, that’s a relief. I definitely thought you hated me.” Potter slightly relaxed, and Draco just looked at him with an incredulously look on his face.
“Sorry about that! In this town most people know each other, and it’s not often people from outside of the city comes here, so I don’t normally make a lot of introductions” the guy said back a bit apologetic.
He can hear explosions and screaming around him, and he realises where he is. The battle at Hogwarts. He runs through the halls seeing other people, students he realises, that are fighting for their lives.
“Fuck.” Draco could feel his blood boil when he saw Professor Shrew’s delighted expression as he walked over to inspect one of the Patil twin’s cauldron. Draco had been working extremely hard during potion classes, having to make sure he never messed up so that Professor Shrew couldn’t find a way to use it against him. He knew the professor hated him and would use whatever opportunity he could get to make sure Draco wouldn’t get a chance to find a job relating to potions later on.
“I’m quite surprised we got to play against each other once more this quickly.” Harry said as he was leisurely sitting on his broom, seemingly more interested in the conversation than the snitch.
“I do have Kreacher.” Potter probably tried to lighten the sudden gloomy atmosphere, but it didn’t do much to change how Draco felt. He needed to figure something out before he left, as he was sure he wouldn’t manage long with those Death Eaters out to get him.
It didn’t take long for Draco to comply and open his mouth up to Harry’s exploring tongue. It was hard to deny that Draco hadn’t been imagining how it would feel like to kiss Harry Potter, his school rival and saviour on multiple occasions. However, he had locked those thoughts far, far back in the darkest, deepest parts of his mind, making sure to never revisit them again, or at least that’s what he told himself.
“You’re quite the advisor, aren’t you, Potter?” Draco could feel his voice sounding icy as it came out. He knew Potter was trying, as always, to help those around him, but he just didn’t want to discuss this topic. He didn’t want to be just another pity case for Potter to try and save.
“Most don’t, but some absolutely do. Apparently, they are grateful for what I did, but it also made them fully aware of the fact that I have quite a bit of magical power.”
“Oh, I’m surprised too. You should’ve seen them when they had to study for it. Both looked like they would die if you put another book in front of them. Luckily they excelled in the physical exam.” Granger said, before lowering her voice a bit more. “Don’t tell him I said this, but Ron’s a mess when it comes to studying. He worked really hard though, so he managed to get through it. Harry, on the other hand, seems to hate studying, but he’s actually rather smart. Seems like when it’s part of something he wants to do, he excels easily. Surprised even me to be honest.” She winked, her eyes shining with mischief and something Draco couldn’t discern.
Harry’s eyes widen in shock for a moment before his lips slowly turned into a devious grin. “That’s cunning of you, Malfoy.” Draco felt his body strangely react to the look on Harry’s face and how he used his last name again. “I’m a Slytherin after all, aren’t I?”
Draco sighed again; he knew it would probably be too difficult to stay as friends now that he knew about his own feelings. This might be the only way to at least have a chance at staying by Harry’s side.
“Short version?” Potter said, not waiting for an answer. “That you’re not a bad person, you’ve gone through more than enough and you deserve a chance despite having a sharp tongue at times.” Potter shrugged.
“It might be a bit sudden, and you don’t have to, but I do have a guest room. So, if you’d like, you’re more than welcome to stay over”.
The look in Potter’s eyes had turned from playful to outright desire as he waited for Draco to make up his mind. “Yes.” Draco breathed, realising he had lost control of himself, unwilling to stop what was going on.
He stood up hurriedly, unaware that the person on the other side of the counter had been leaning over it and was still doing so.
“I’m with Abbott” Pansy said. “She’s alright, I guess. I’m gonna try and see if I can get closer to her. Would be nice since I’m the only girl from Slytherin who have returned.” She added forlornly.
Pansy looked more than pleased at the insinuation that she was, indeed, elegant herself. Draco could barely hold it together at her obvious delight.
“Relax, Weasley. I’m not trying to steal your little friend from you. By all means, you can have him.”
“You ran out the door at full speed two days ago, and it all just felt so rushed, so I just wondered if something was wrong, or if I did anything that made you feel uncomfortable that day”
“Quite the demanding type, huh. Were you thinking I’d just obey you like a dog?” He smiled lasciviously, as he looked far too confident in his current predicament.
“It’s one of my own makings. Don’t worry.” Draco said as Potter lifted an eyebrow at him. “I’ve cleared it with a board of healers at St. Mungo’s already. It’s completely safe to drink.”
“Good.” Draco was still trying to find the cause of the device malfunction, and it didn’t help having Granger rambling beside him.
“Bloody hell… You might be right, mate.” Weasley seemed gloomy at the realisation that he had to agree with Potter.
“Here’s something for the headache.” Harry said, placing a vial on the bedside table. “And here’s breakfast.”
Some of the customers had even started sending flowers to the shop together with a thank you card for how well the potions had helped them or their loved ones. This had been a truly remarkable change, and Draco took note of having to thank Granger once he saw her again.
“You came!” Luna looked more than thrilled as she bounced over and hugged Harry warmly. Just as Draco was about to give his greeting in the form of a handshake, a big hug attacked him, and he was forced to stay in it for a long while until Luna was content.
