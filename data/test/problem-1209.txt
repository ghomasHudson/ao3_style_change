"It's his signature move, not exactly a secret," Granger tosses over her shoulder. "Harry, don't forget about next Sunday. We're meeting at seven and you'll need to have it all sorted by then."
“Everything’s changed.”
"Hmm." Harry nods, giving it some thought. He still has bandages on his fingers but they look a lot better today. There are less now and the skin where the ones that have been removed are gone, looks smooth and new, if a little shiny.
The corner of Malfoy's mouth twitched, the ghost of a smile. "So you can conjure up three syllable words, but can't manage a decent silencing charm?"
"And you're content to let it rot whilst you flit around the world." He doesn’t bother to mask it as a question.
“This is what you call effort?” Potter scoffs. “I saved your
Draco wants to touch himself, needs the friction -- but more than that, he wants to see Harry’s face when he comes, wants to swallow him down, Harry's warm spunk filling his mouth, and then Harry shouts and and it’s happening, warm and sticky over his tongue, dribbling down his chin.
“Enjoy your drink!” he shouts, and turns to follow Madam Pomfrey as she levitates Ernie off the pitch.
“Right. So go on, then. Be your usual holier-than-thou and do something nice for me.”
"I may have spent one year following you around Hogwarts, but that doesn’t discredit the fact that you spent five of them following me."
He shakes his head. “Sprout’s going to box her ears if she keeps that up.”
Recently-dumped Simon glares. “Watch it, Weasley. Just because you dated Potter doesn’t make you special.”
“I said, sex.”
He shrugs. "It’s not up to me."
Pansy dismisses it with a wave, watching him closely. "Did you speak to him at all?"
"Malfoy. Nice pajamas."
"Oh." Draco hands the parchment back to his mother, who lowers herself onto the stairs. "I see."
Potter is as Draco works his fist to bring him off properly. Potter’s hand finds its way into his Draco’s hair, threading his fingers to grip lightly as Draco kisses along the flat of his stomach, the jut of his hip.
Karrey finally blinks.
"Yeah?" Draco strides forward and shoves with both hands. Harry's expecting the force but not the sharp jab of Draco's knee, and stumbles back wildly before hitting the ground. Draco throws himself down on top of him, straddling Harry, so that he lies winded between Draco's knees amid a sea of petals and glass.
"Draco." His mother leans forward, allowing a brush of his lips to each pale cheek.
“Get out of here, Malfoy, I don’t want to talk to you,” Potter continues. Besides him, Weasley moves to climb to his feet.
"You're drooling." Blaise looks delightfully amused.
In the evening he sits with his mother in the parlor and allows her to tell Draco about his father’s condition. It keeps his mind from wandering, from watching the clock when it reaches seven and he hasn’t heard a word.
“You’ve just missed Anders pass the bludger to Wilson. Wilson, clever lad that he is, hit it through his own team’s goal.”
Draco's had time to mull it over. The more he thought about it, the more his instincts seemed all but scream in the direction of Hangingbone’s Sorting Hat and the way it had backfired, leaving him with no response at all. Superstitious or not, it made sense to connect his wild fluctuations in mood to the unspoken pronouncement that he may be stuck in some kind of morality limbo.
"My point," Pansy continues, "is that if The Ministry’s in charge, they can’t allow anything to happen to you under their watch. No matter how demonstrative you are, it’ll be a consequence free environment. Use it to your advantage."
"What?!" He shouted, useless. If Malfoy kicked him again, he'd deserve it, but Harry could barely think over all the noise. Brows furrowed, he concentrated on Malfoy's pink lips as they formed shapes, the smooth length of his tongue.
"I don’t know why you mentioned it at all," says Pansy, her voice curling stiffly around every word. "A nice meal once a week isn’t about to clear your conscious. If it could, darling, I’d expect every Pureblood from here to Albania to be in far better shape."

Owls, maybe a hundred are more, perch on the roof of the Owlery, some circling the sky just overhead. They look like a swarm of bees or wasps, the way they seem to converge in one place, their eyes looking about as they maintain the contents of their beaks.

Like now. He descended the stairs, his pants long abandoned on the floor of Harry’s bedroom. He was careful to avoid the trick step that sent one back at the top of the stairs to begin the process once more, light on his feet.
, was the ill-fated trip to Diagon Alley where Draco’d chosen to use his words instead of his wand, and found both equally destructive.
Above their heads, the canopy of trees sway gently. Theo’s hands continue their measured strokes along the Granian’s pale coat.
"It's the B Team," Harry said gruffly, wetting his lips. "The ones on the Russia case. We just have to hold things down while they make the jump."
Behind them, Theo snorts loudly. He’s leading his horse through the garden, careful to avoid the newly planted snapdragons, who gnash their teeth as he passes. Draco whirls to face him. "I'm not!" he insists.
"I'll bet. Anything else I should know about? I'd have gone through the usual channels if I thought these dinners were more than a simple how-do."
Lovegood comes to a stop. "Here we are." Set between a corridor of identical glass doors, sits a handsome round table with five chair, porcelain dishes and gleaming cutlery.
"Most things end up being my idea when you’re skeptical of them."
“And your hair looks like more of a rat’s nest than ever,” Draco snorted. “We must make a pair.”
. Incensed, Draco snatches the hat off Hangingbone’s desk, mere seconds before she makes to grab it herself, but not before Potter lunges, fingers wrapping around the fluffy pom with a stubborn grip that makes Draco want to send his fist right into Potter’s smug face.
“Err.” Potter slowly puts down his wand. He licks his lips, his eyes bright. “What just happened?”
/flounders to keep up
Draco blinks. The suddenness of the invitation takes him by surprise. “I— Cheers, McMillan, but I couldn’t impose. I don’t think your family is as forgiving and I wouldn’t want to risk it, considering.” He gestures vaguely between them, grateful when Ernie interprets what he’s said with an understanding nod.
"Huh. You really know how to make a guy feel welcome."
"We're in a garden, with bees. And we're eating little finger sandwiches full of honey which are basically their life blood."
“Mm. And unfortunately for you, my bed is invitation only.”
"No one did, but that's never stopped you."
Draco Malfoy was quick and resourceful. He had extensive knowledge of magical social circles and actually

he’s placed it. Draco would be touched by the worry in her voice if he didn’t already know that Pansy’s presence is one part concern and two parts knowledge that Draco's favorite hiding spot has a particularly good view of the Prefect’s bathroom, which he, Pansy and Anthony Goldstein still have unfettered access, and that that privilege is one Goldstein has been known to abuse endlessly.
fucked, and Draco's hands had found their way over Harry's mouth and around his throat, even as the orgasm slammed through him with so much force that Draco had cried out, tears in his eyes.
Theo’s eyes bounce from Pansy, who isn’t paying him any mind, to the horse, which neighs in a way Draco can’t help but divine as sarcastic.
Theo shoots her the closest thing he has to a smile as they begin to walk. “Only because money was involved.”
Wouldn’t it be nice to be perfect Potter, the lauded hero who would never have to worry about being deemed as anything but that. Heroic deed after heroic deed absolving him of all the times
Harry looks up from his conversation with Hermione, his eyes startled as they move Blaise to Draco.
"It makes sense, doesn’t it?" Pansy draws her legs up, the question sounding anything but. "You're a terror when you've gone too long without a wand, or a wank."
"They'll be along. Tell me Potter, what sort of project is the golden trio working on now?"
“In one! Though we must call him ‘Father Christmas’ Mr. Thomas, as it’s the proper term in our region.
When he opens them again, Harry holds his eyes, hooks the elastic of his boxers beneath his balls, drawn up tight to his body, in order to take himself in hand. He strokes once, twice and before Draco can think, can process what he’s doing, he’s down on his knees, crawling towards Potter and pushing his hand away.
"Not quite." Draco produces a handsome flask from inside his blazer pocket and flexes his wrist. The contents inside don’t make a single sound, filled to the brim as it is.
“Tch!” Potter turns to leave and slips on the an icy patch, falling onto his arse in the snow. Draco doesn’t bother to hide his mocking laughter. But then Potter begins to laugh too, rubbing his behind in pain as his shoulders continue to shake. It’s like he can’t help it, which is strange. It’s strange because he’d been so angry just a moment ago, and while it’s perfectly natural for Draco to laugh at him, Potter has
No, Draco is not in the dungeons because he’s headed towards Gryffindor Tower.
Draco sniffs. "Far be it from me to explain the inner workings of Potter’s mind." The line inches forward. Draco swears he feels himself age. "If the best gossip to cross your desk is that I’m finally able to leave my home under the watchful eyes of DMLE escorts, you’re not getting enough work done."
“Draco!” Harry rushes towards him, falling onto his knees. “Are you alright?”
“Of course, it would just be until Hangingbone returns.”
Weasley’s eyes widen. “Are you saying that whenever you act like, like
Harry's head shot up, blinking wildly as color and sound came back into focus. Malfoy looked shocked, his entire face red, hands still pressed to his ears. At some point Harry had fallen to his knees.
"This is amazing," Potter moans next to him. "I’ve never had anything like this."
"Aren't we missing someone?" Potter interjects loudly, doing an abysmal job of trying to change the subject or lose Draco's suddenly piqued interest. Pansy's eyes light up in a way that says she scents blood as well.
“Oh?” Harry doesn’t start, just melts into him as he relaxes his stance. Draco brings his other hand around, bringing the red hat it’s white trim into Harry’s field of vision.

“You’ve been upset lately. Not sleeping. So have I. Haven’t you had times where you laughed even if something wasn’t funny? Upset when you should be happy?” Draco shoots him an accusing look. “You’re irritated right now!”
"Well now I know I haven't been sent on some kind of goose chase." Blaise offers a tight smile before he looks at their surroundings with interest. "If you'd told me back at Hogwarts you and I would be spending our Saturday night standing in the middle of a field digging brambles out of trousers, I'd have thought it would
"Mr. Draco is late. Karrey thought he would not show."
Draco leans in, noses along Harry's shaft, nuzzles his balls. Potter's smells of clean sweat, musk, arousal. Slowly he drags his tongue along the vein on Potter's underside, presses his cock onto his clenching stomach, wet with slick. "You like that, don't you?" Draco murmurs into his skin.
Draco nearly chokes, coughing as he tried not to dribble chocolate down his chin. “Piss off,” he wheezed. Potter’s face looks strangely fond as he passes Draco a napkin. He dabs at his mouth and when he’s confident he’s done making an arse of himself, he tosses his blonde hair back to great effect.
"Have you been to any games this season?" Potter jerks his head at the empty cushion beside him. There's really no way to assign seats tonight.
The walk back to to the dungeons is a strange one. Despite being chewed out by McGonagall for minutes that felt like hours, Draco feels giddy. Like he could he could skip through the castle halls. Of course, doing that would be giving Harry the satisfaction of knowing that these feelings are all about him, so Draco holds himself back. He suspects Potter knows anyway - still connected, the dopey smile on Harry’s face gives him away just as much as if he were leeching the feeling from the very core of Draco’s being.
Potter nods. His eyes seem to burn in the near-darkness, a single, lonely torch the only source of light. Shadows play across his face as he moves closer to Draco. "I know what you mean."
“Yes, Potter, don’t be so puritan about it.” Draco motions for him to get up and he leads him to the corridor at the other end of the room. “I’ll leave the door open if you’re afraid I’m going to ravish you.”
Keeping his chin raised, Draco sets his shoulders and wills himself not to quake. “I’m looking for Potter.”
, Potter,” Draco says with satisfaction. “Why would you suddenly douse your underling?”
In December, the merpeople tend to hibernate in their underwater caves, deep in the center of the lake, and there’s not much to watch in the water outside the dungeon’s windows except the gillyweed that bobs and ebbs with the current and the occasional curl of the great squid’s tentacles. Occasionally, he’ll tap them against the glass in a rhythm Draco’s come to understand as
Potter hums in agreement. After the incident at the skating rink, they’d called a truce of sorts, making efforts to work together in class, pass each other items, and be altogether pleasant. While it’d kept them from any kind of emotional outbursts, it’d had a less than stellar effect on their magic. In advanced transfiguration, Draco’s mushroom had not transformed into a brolly, but instead stretched the mushroom’s stalk until it threatened to break through the ceiling, all the while fat drops of rain splashing upon them.
“We were wondering if we’d have to go looking for you,” Theo calls from his seat in front of the fire. “Pansy put ten galleons on you sulking in that alcove you like so much.”
“It certainly explains why Malfoy’s head turns every time a bloke with dark hair enters the room.”
“Crisis?” Potter reels back. “I’d thank you not to assume things just because Gin and I have broken up and you and I have been-- been getting along.” His eyes move uncertainly to Hagrid who doesn’t seem to pick up on what Potter’s not saying, the way Draco does.
On the other hand, Potter could just be checking his reflection.
Under his robes, Draco feels the gooseflesh rise along his arms.

Draco curls his lip but doesn’t respond. There have been plenty of wanks. Therein lies the problem.
"At the moment, you're nothing to me." Draco swallows thickly. Potter has stepped closer now. The elevator can't come fast enough. "It doesn't matter anyway."
He’s moving before he realizes his feet are carrying him, and in a burst of mean satisfaction, rears back and slaps Blaise hard across the face.
"We know of each other," Boot glances at Draco. "But it might help if we break the ice a little. Maybe a round of drinks?"
"That's how you eat pizza, Malfoy!"
It’s odd, but for a moment the question throws Draco.
He draws back and her eyes remain trained on his, darting with frequency towards Abernathy’s direction. Draco offers nothing more than a vacant smile as he wordlessly continues to admire her silk robes, though he does feel a pang in his chest at the way her mouth tightens.
It’s just like Potter to make a scene because he can’t control his temper like a normal person. If the worse he’s managed is a scratch on his face or a bruised ego, Draco thinks smugly, then it serves the git right.
“Malfoy.”
instead of anger at the assumption, or annoyance at the approach — even fear, in light of the sexuality he had yet to fully step into and claim for what it was? What it might mean for his future?
“Go away?” Draco tilts his head with interest. “I never figured you for the jetsetter type, Potter.”
Blaise smiles. "If we're honest, I've forgotten what I ate for breakfast last Tuesday. I could hardly be bothered to keep track of Draco's every move at Hogwarts. That requires true dedication and I'm too selfish for that."
“Sorry, I uh..” He shakes his head, ruefully. Points to the dirty calendar page he’s folded into dragon. Ernie nods, albeit hesitantly and Draco tries to get himself under control.
Karrey appears to lead them into the conservatory and seat them at a long table. Everyone is on the same side, like a wedding party or the head table at Hogwarts, but somehow Potter's place seating is has been placed next to his once again. Karrey stares up at Draco with wide unblinking eyes as he takes his wand. He continues to stare for so long that Draco finds himself looking around to make sure he's not imagining things. Did someone cast a freezing charm?
“You’re looking
Potter cups his cheek, his elbow digging into one of several squishy pillows. “So you said you wanted to talk in private?”
The sky is a brilliant blue overhead, the sun making the freshly packed snow sparkle as Draco enters the village, careful to avoid stepping into puddles of slushy ice and the busking wizards with their lutes and violins as they sing cheery renditions of classic carols for knuts.
"In Headland's office? Chang, I haven't seen you. Are you interning under someone new?" Draco turns back to Harry feigning perfect innocence. "It would have to be a great coincidence that you happened to be coming out of the mind healer I'm currently seeing, wouldn't it?"
"You know, I’m almost relieved to know you’re as hypocritical as I am. Climb down from your fucking pedestal for once."
"She’s right." Theo stands to his feet. "You need Headland to sign off, so convince them you’ve learned your lesson. Potter may have sent you your wand, but they’ll never lift the wards if you can’t suck it up and manage this."
Draco's cheeks flush deeply. "Not many are, I'm afraid. You should count yourself lucky, ensnaring my affections is quite a feat, even for the likes of
"I’m sorry." Potter directs the words to his plate, but there’s something determined in the set of his shoulders that betrays him. The confidence to be wrong and admit it without any superfluous details. It was what made Potter the man that everyone thought he was, even if he didn’t live up to it all the time. It was a heavy crown to bear. No one could live up to it all the time. "I didn’t mean to generalize. I’m working on it."
Draco swallows. Then does one of the bravest things he’s ever done thus far and lowers himself to the ground, scooting next to Potter. “I think the hat might have ... done something to us.”
Blaise hops out of the carriage, eyes wide. "Well, well. This is quite a sight."
Color floods Potter’s face.
“It’s the change in weather. This time of year isn’t my favorite.”
“Alright all! Gather round, gather round!”
The whole experience is rather trying.
Draco sighs. "Yeah." He can’t even look at Harry right now. One of his loafers is under the bed, the other by the door. "So do I."
The guests are long gone, every candelabra extinguished, and Draco wonders if he’s responsible for that too. An empty ballroom plunged into darkness, doing nothing to hide the disquiet on Harry’s face after his eyes adjust. Some perverse side of Draco considers it a compliment. Shocking Potter, being watched by Potter, wanting Potter. He’s all too aware of the furious arousal that courses through him, watching the other man’s stance shift from relaxed to defensive in the space of a heartbeat.
It’s eerily quiet. Draco’s face flames as he turns around. “This is all your fault!” He sneers, advancing on Potter.
Draco wants to know what’s happened to the first one.
She reclines, sunglasses back on her face. "Present company excluded."
“And your sticking charms would be more efficient if you applied one to the center first,” Draco continues turning to Granger. Watching her fumble was giving him a headache. Potter had better come back soon or he’d unwrap all their presents and fix them himself. “If you want the folds to lay properly, you’ll need to start again. Here, let me show you.”
Potter’s eyes gleam with furious satisfaction when Draco wheels on him. He shoves his shoulder hard, and Potter stumbles back. “You did that on purpose!”
"Really honing those Auror skills, aren’t you Potter," Draco says breathlessly, the smile fading from his face when Potter tenses. "What are you--" Draco looks around, then back to Potter. "What are you doing here?"
“Slytherins,” Parvati sighs, “sound a lot like Gryffindors.”
“Talk to her like what? I’m politely pointing out the obvious. Like the fact that you’re not making any of this easier having a temper tantrum!” Draco throws himself down so that he’s lying on his back. It’s a cloudless day and staring up at the sky feels like he’s staring into forever. He closes his eyes and takes a few deep breathes, relieved as the tension drains out of him, slowly. To his left he hears Potter exhale in a long sigh.
His hand shoots up almost immediately. Around him, his classmates turn to look, and even the sensation of their eyes boring into him doesn’t serve to make him hesitate. “Professor!”
“Don’t put words in my mouth.”

Draco stalks back to the plot of dirt he'd left overturned. He picks up his trowel and thrusts it into the soil with unnecessary force, relishing in the minor violence. He can’t exactly blame any of them for any of this, he knows, but the knowledge doesn’t do much against quelling the urge.
Draco feels his face heat. “It’s a symptom of habit,” He refuses to turn around, suffering Pansy and Blaise’s knowing looks instead. “Potter spent an entire year playing my warden while we repaired the castle and now it’s a nervous tick. If he doesn’t see someone about it, it’s likely to continue the rest of my life.”
Draco casts her a sideways glance, entirely sure nothing good can come of her casual tone. "Did she? I’m sure it was a glowing review. Don’t leave out any of the interesting bits."
“I don’t see that anything funny about what I’ve said. See that you don’t get up to any mischief while you’re here or I’ll send you right back out that door.”
“I was just trying to—! ”
Karrey returns with two glasses, already sweaty with condensation. They both have identical looking drinks and no straws this time. The elf looks at them both as if trying to remember something. Then deliberately places one glass in front of Potter and the other in front of Draco, blinking rapidly. "Karrey hopes you will enjoy."
"Yes we-- hand me that roll of tape."
Draco nods wordlessly. He hasn’t told anyone that he’s still unable to cast a Patronus.
Blaise overhears them, propping an arm on the back of his chair. “And what are you doing then, McMillan, if it’s so boring to you? Trip to the moon?”
“Come now! You think that
"It's okay. It was an emergency, and I know you would have asked for permission if you could--"
I don’t want to leave either. The words rise unbidden and traitorous to the front of Draco’s mind. He can feel Potter’s nerve, his hope. Draco thinks the thrill of excitement and the butterflies in his stomach are all his, though. Potter’s words are vague -- an invitation but nothing more, placing the decision in Draco’s hands. He’s just not sure that even if he accepts, that it might mean what he
There was a long silence and Malfoy looked at Harry with a vaguely worried expression. Harry reviewed Malfoy's words, but he seemed to have got them right. There really was a London Special Services Police Force, specially created by the Muggle Prime Minister to deal with magical affairs, although few people other than the Prime Minister knew what the division entailed. Their Muggle-issued identification cards and papers were authentic and valid.
"Does that mean you haven't broken this bed in properly?"

Zabini rolled his eyes. "Very funny."
"A nitwit who wants complete deniability. Anyone could have left it there as a setup." Draco leaned forwards and took up an edamame pod, splitting it open with a squeeze to extract the green globules within.
"That would not surprise me, Malfoy," Harry said dryly. "Now, think about doing something terrible to me and try again."
Ron sighed with an envious expression. "I went into the wrong business."
About to deny it, Harry paused, wishing he could unburden himself, but not quite ready to do so. "Why did you tell me not to trust Eddie? Do you know something about him?"
"And what do you do with your substantial earnings, then?"
“I suppose that counts as one,” Draco said.  “Nineteen more to go.”
"Yes, I'm certain she gave him a stern talking to."
"Me? I don't know where he lives!"
Curtis' openly curious face seemed to slam shut. His eyes narrowed and his demeanour turned chilly. "About Draco? What do you want to know?"
The door opened with what seemed infinite slowness. Harry risked a quick glance to see a tall, steel-haired witch standing with the door ajar. "Ms Chang, dearie! What brings you here? Is everything all right with Liam?"
knickers. An emerald green scrap of silk and lace.
Ron nodded and spoke around a large mouthful of chocolate biscuit. “Even I knew that, mate.”
Harry glared back. He opened his mouth to say something, he had no idea what, but the lift doors opened with a ping and a huge group of yellow-and-black-clad witches and wizards entered, all talking loudly and holding banners and signs that read
"Well, goodnight, Malfoy," he said quickly and headed for the door.
The elf ignored Harry's pointed stare. "Is Master Draco needing Crassly to be bringing anything, Master Draco, sir?"
Harry opened his mouth to apologize, but sharp footsteps forestalled his comment.
"What do you know about the disappearance of Quentin Quartermain and Liam Nottingham?"
"I need to check on Ron."
"I didn't take it; I borrowed it. Are you really going to take me to task for breaking the rules, Potter?" Malfoy sat back, eyes flashing.
"Just having a difference of opinion with Potter," Malfoy said and got to his feet. Harry longed to reach out and hold him in place, to try and explain. He felt near-panicked at the thought he had lost the camaraderie they had so recently gained. Having Malfoy as a friend was so much better than having him as an enemy. Harry would just have to get past this foolish crush and let Malfoy live his life as he chose.
Tuesday, 6.7.2004
"Thought I'd get one as a gift for Tonks and Remus," he lied smoothly. He could always claim to have forgotten it. He picked up one of the Silence Chambers also, thinking it could be useful for the business. Sometimes he and Draco had conversations that clients did not need to be privy to.
Before Harry could register his words, Draco's clenched fist smashed into his jaw. The pain exploded into darkness and Harry only dimly felt Draco lower him gently to the cold floor. He struggled to retain consciousness as Draco's lips softly pressed against his. He suddenly knew the gesture was meant to be goodbye. Draco's soft mouth slid over Harry's cheek to press against the flesh next to his ear.
“I thought you were for a moment. Or a figment. A nightmare.”  The last word was added quickly, as though having a civil talk without insult would have shaken the foundations of the world more than a chance meeting.
Pansy picked it up. "I know, but take a look at that prize. Merlin, the shape of it is utter perfection. I wonder if he could be coaxed to send another." She cocked her head and licked her lips.
Malfoy straightened slowly and went back to making notes in his book. "Is Eddie
"The same thing I have always gained, Ronald. Power. Do you think I could have reached the position I now hold without clawing and fighting my way up? Do you think any woman can get ahead without playing dirty and stacking the odds in her favour?"
"Shit!" Pansy said and Disapparated. Potter blinked for a moment, but Draco knew she had only returned to Bath for warmer clothing. There was no way would she leave Draco alone with Super Auror Deluxe.
Draco considered it well worth the torment. Harry was gone.
! something inside of Harry screamed, causing his hands to tighten, holding Malfoy in place. His lips moved, pushing forward, parting just enough to pull Malfoy’s top lip between his, so that his tongue could brush the edge of it, just for a taste.
"Draco," he admonished himself, "think about this for a minute. What are you doing?" He dimmed the lights with a spell and then unbuttoned the top two buttons of the shirt he'd borrowed from Harry. Only two, though, because three would make him look like a cheesy porn star. "I am merely getting comfortable," he replied and ignored the fact that talking aloud to himself could be considered a sign of insanity.
For reply, Draco guided Harry's knees open with one booted foot. "Just lean back."
and a veritable whirlwind of magical ropes. Rosier toppled over like a fallen spruce.
"Potter."
"Where is he?" Potter's voice was a sword blade—sharp and whisper thin.
"Mentioning my mother is a terrible way to ruin the afterglow, Potter."
"Probably choke and die if they tried to eat Malfoy, anyway," Ron muttered.
Harry glanced at the queue of people, some of whom clapped. All of them smiled and he felt something loosen between his shoulders. He never knew what sort of reception he would find, and here, in Florence, well… This is where it had begun, after all.
"I'm sorry," Harry blurted.
I kissed Malfoy. I pushed the bastard up against a wall and I held his face in place and then I kissed him for what seemed like ages (and bloody hell, it was even more brilliant than I'd imagined - I'm thinking about enshrining it as a Pensieve memory) and when I pulled away that he looked just as shaken as I felt, even with the glitter on his lashes and in his hair (he was dressed as an Ice Prince) and it was amazing for about ten whole seconds. Until he punched me and Disapparated. Thus ends another eventful Halloween in the fucked up life of Harry Potter.
Potter set down the cup and licked wetness from his upper lip. "It's good. Look, are you going to have anything useful for me at all?"
Harry bent down and took one of Draco's toes in his mouth. Draco's eyes widened and he stared at the mischievous green eyes that sparkled at him beneath the black frames. Draco inhaled a surprised breath when Harry sucked on it for a moment and then raised his head with a grin.
Parkinson bumped into Harry partway into the dance, which was less of a dance and more of Malfoy grinding against Harry and nibbling on his neck. Harry was rapidly losing control under the assault.
The tour was brief and left Draco feeling less than reassured, despite Shacklebolt's confident descriptions. The safe house was actually a castle, abandoned by the Muggles and left to fall into ruin, later to be claimed and transformed by the Ministry for clandestine use. Although it sat on the very edge of a Muggle town, several charms made it appear as nothing more than a tumble-down ruin. Such a thing would normally entice curious Muggles into exploration, but Muggle-Repellent charms could be powerful when reinforced regularly. Draco imagined there were still a few cases of Muggles wandering in, likely dealt with by careful use of Obliviation and planting of judicious photos into Muggle cameras, giving them the belief they had visited the ruins.
"Oh," Harry replied and grinned as something immense seemed to loosen and relax within his diaphragm. Maybe things really had returned to normal.
"I am fairly certain that Rosier's target is Hermione Granger." Malfoy's tone did not change from his usual cheerful conversational lilt and it took Harry a moment to process it.
"When you heard about my… unnatural sexual proclivities, as it were—the fact that I'm a flaming ponce, that is—your family decided it would be a good idea to sell your services to me with the vague hope that I will use my influence to spare the Manor and your fortune. Is this correct?"
"I suggest haste."
~~~~*~~~~
"Um. You know. We'll be in costume. No one will know it's us."
"Bring Cauldron Cakes. The food here is terrible."
"Thank you. I should probably move out of your room, though."
"Not if you accept the challenge."
Yes, Pansy was absolutely right. Mark was the right choice.
Potter flushed, reminding Draco immediately of the boy he'd loved to torment.
"Come on, Uncle Harry!"
He stopped suddenly, leaving Harry a sobbing, quivering mess.  Harry strained back against his bonds, seeking more contact,
"Hey!" Seamus cried suddenly. "We should send some! You know, get ours critiqued!"
The newcomer reached the bottom of the stairs and then cocked her head and gave them both a critical stare. Something about the movement was instantly familiar and Harry felt his jaw gape open. The woman glided forwards until she stood before him, and then she pushed his mouth shut with a single finger beneath his chin.
"Since you're here, you might as well make yourself useful," Draco decided. "Consider it your punishment for creeping into my bed uninvited, Zabini." He twined his fingers with Blaise's and guided the hand downwards to slip beneath his pants. His prick was less than erect, but it was Blaise's job to fix that. Draco wrapped both their hands around his cock and then let go. Blaise's warm hand stayed where it was as though frozen.
When they reached the flat that evening, Potter went straight to his room without a by-your-leave and Draco was fine with that. Although he would never admit it, he felt slightly shaken by Potter's display of wordless rage. Sometimes it was easy to forget that Potter had taken out the world's most powerful evil wizard. Draco might do well to keep it in mind.
Draco grinned with wicked satisfaction and pushed the ottoman back.  Potter released his ankle and slipped free of his legs, but Draco said, “Don’t move.”
Harry swallowed and gently released Draco's cock before he licked his way back up Draco's flat stomach. He smiled with such triumph that Draco groaned.
A whimpering cry escaped his throat when Malfoy’s hands tightened and he thrust forward suddenly, yanking Harry hips to meet his downstroke and bury himself even deeper. Another thrust, and another, and Harry thought he might be able to come, oh Merlin he was close,
Draco's hand explored the velvety hardness, drawing a trembling shudder from Potter. Draco's smile widened and Potter dragged him down into another kiss.
“Oh, for fuck’s sake,” said Malfoy and stepped out into the hallway. He raised his wand just as Harry snapped himself out of his kissing-induced trance and hurried to join him.
"…you taste like candy floss and chocolate, and jasmine tea…"
Potter had almost kissed him.
Harry said nothing; his own preconceptions had led him to believe the worst of Malfoy until Curtis Laigle had opened his eyes. At least Auror Clark had come to the realization on his own. They sat in silence for a time. Harry Vanished his cold tea and made another cup from the Everfull Pitcher near the outer doors. Rocco entered the room, took in their bleak expressions, and said nothing, only sat down to wait with them. Shortly thereafter, Vic and Brady strolled in. Harry was cheered to see them, thinking that finally,
Harry glared at him. "I can identify him. Believe me, I'll never forget that face after what he did to Eddie."
are the ones you need to be concerned about."
"Just like you couldn't turn me over to Voldemort at the Manor when we were captured. I know you recognized me, despite my face being swollen and weird. You had to have known I'd never leave Ron and Hermione. It could only have been me. And yet you pretended you didn't know."
Eddie dropped a hand to Harry's thigh and leaned closer. "I'm healed now." His voice was husky and soft and Harry leaned in and kissed him. To his absolute shame, he kept finding himself thinking about Malfoy whenever he kissed Eddie. Harry wasn't sure what had been so different about Malfoy's kiss; perhaps it was merely that Malfoy's excess of confidence spilled into everything he did, and the kissing had been no exception. In contrast, Eddie was a tentative kisser, barely moving his lips and expecting Harry to take the lead.
They had to fly more carefully once daylight had brightened their path, staying low and avoiding Muggle-populated areas. They halted once more, just past midday, to eat a brief meal that Harry had packed along.
Harry hadn't known what to expect; his late night fantasies had consisted of little more than blow jobs and orgasms. Malfoy was taking it to a different level, mingling laughter and teasing with moments of heart-stopping intensity. Harry thought he might have opened himself up to more than he expected. It was terrifying, and yet hopeful.
"I'm afraid I don't know your name," Malfoy said and sent the shoe, cloth, and trousers out of the room as well. "Although I assume you know mine."
"I hate to interrupt,
Harry Potter, of course, was a better man than that. He sat down. A muscle twitched in his jaw and Draco watched it with a fresh wave of pain. God, how he had missed him. He wanted nothing more than to crawl into Harry's arms for comfort, but apparently that ship had sailed.
"Yes. Fine," he said and focussed on his wand.
"Or he was quite happy to see your breasts," Draco suggested dryly, glancing at them pointedly. Pansy had a habit of displaying her assets nearly to the point of obscenity.
Malfoy clapped his hands twice.  "Excellent.  Very well, Potter, come here and assume the position."
"Oh, so you want a fucking wall, do you?" Harry snarled. He picked up his wand and cast a spell, sending a metal filing cabinet shooting from the wall across the room to slam into Draco's stacked boxes. The topmost box teetered and fell over. Draco righted it without a word and went for another one.
A minute, repetitive squeaking noise penetrated his haze of dullness and he glanced up with a frown. Draco was leant back in his chair, feet up on his desk and crossed at the ankles, and he was tapping one expensive black boot against the other. The movement barely made a sound, but it caused his chair to bounce ever so slightly, resulting in a tiny
"On the reverse side, we haven't a clue what she looks like or who she is." Harry let out a frustrated sigh and combed a hand through his hair. "This is madness!"
"Ron, sometimes you are very smart," Hermione said with a proud smile.
Harry caught Malfoy's eye for a moment. The laughter fit their theory; dementors would have been drawn to the laughing, happy group. Malfoy's quill made scratching noises in the silence.
Draco squeezed his wrist once more and then let go. "By outwitting him."
They rose before dawn and packed everything of import before returning to the underground warren to collect Pansy. Harry wasn't certain what to do with Mulciber's body. He certainly did not want to drag it back to London.
Draco's mouth began to water at the word. He had considered revising his lifelong opinion of Muggles on the merits of pizza alone. Potter had introduced him to the wonders of meat, cheese, and sauce upon a round slab of dough and Draco had become instantly smitten. "Pizza is the greatest of Muggle inventions," he said to Potter when he reappeared again. “Next to coffee machines.”
He’d returned from his trip sometime in the middle of the night, with a well-behaved Grawp in tow, in hopes that visiting the Giant tribe to the north would cure Grawp’s most recent bout of homesickness. Apparently, it had been very successful, if a bit short, and the two brothers returned home in good spirits. Not a moment too soon, given Potter’s response to the other arrival of the morning. Draco hadn’t even left his dorm before Potter’s Patronus arrived to tell him he should skip breakfast and meet Potter on the edge of the grounds.
“I- I didn’t mean to,”
Draco makes a concentrated effort to keep his gaze from straying to the other side of the table from that moment on. The main course arrives: something Karry calls, "Frozen Pizza," despite the fact that from what Draco can see, not a single ingredient adorning it looks to be at room temperature, let alone frozen. None of the others look to be familiar with it, save Potter, who looks rather bemused. Once everyone has been served, Draco lifts his fork and knife.
“Haaa, Lumos,” Potter’s panting now, a small ball of light illuminating them just enough so that Draco can take in the flushed head, the precum at the tip. He touches a finger to it and a string of wet comes away when he pulls it back.
Having successfully lured him out of hiding with valuable information, Draco follows the others down the corridor line with portraits, to the staircase that connects to the other side of the third floor. As another staircase thunks into place above their heads, Draco is lost in thought. Even if he tried to answer Pansy’s question, he’s not sure he would have had one for her that didn't make him sound as mad as he’d felt lying on Scrivenshaft’s floor.
Staring into Potter’s face is what Draco imagines it’s like to enter the mouth of a lion. He’s a serpent, a beast — every creature unhinging it’s maw wide enough to fill their prey with deadly calm before their jaws snap shut. Unwavering survival versus inevitable destruction. Potter lifts his chin.
“They’re much more temperamental.” The words are out before Draco can catch them. “That is to say,” he clears his throat, “That we can at least control our thoughts. Emotions just overtake you sometimes. Feeling angry doesn’t make you an angry person.”
“No one blames you, darling,” Pansy lowers her voice, darting her eyes towards the other end of the table. Draco cranes his neck to follows her gaze.
“Your room?”
Weasley grins as the others hoot and cheer. Potter, who still seemed to be in a mood, offers a small grin, clapping Weasley on the back.
Harry allowed that to sink in while he weighed it for validity. "That's impossible. The imposter would have to keep taking Polyjuice to maintain the disguise!"
"Something dangerous," Draco admitted with a grim smile. "So dangerous you might finally be rid of me forever."
"I want something that will kill Draco Malfoy," he said without preamble.
Sometime during the wee hours of the morning, Harry had concocted a plan to learn more about Draco by using his friendship with Mark. It had seemed harmless enough; Draco had shown that he had no intention of allowing anything beyond friendship to develop with Mark, despite their rather unorthodox meeting. What Harry hadn't counted on were Mark's growing feelings for Draco. He scowled and reached for the wine bottle to refill their glasses.
Ron was still a bit sullen over having been ambushed in the third floor loo, but they had been warned to
"I don't know the bloody password because I am not a bloody Gryffindor," Draco growled. "I need to speak to bloody Potter and his bloody minions
. Therefore, you." Malfoy gestured at him with a fork.
"It's all right. I've got you," Draco said softly and then murmured the words of a Warming Charm. Blessed heat settled over Harry, feeling almost as good as the warmth of Draco's body. In a moment of clarity, he realised he was sat practically in his partner's lap. Draco's lips brushed against his temple. It did not seem accidental. Harry made a sound of contentment.
Toby nodded and levered himself up. Malfoy sat in the chair, looking as out of place as a supermodel at a hoedown. Toby activated the Vibrating Charm and Malfoy leaned his head back and sighed.
Potter's eyes, wide and green even without the magnification of his glasses—fallen to the floor some time previous—bored into Draco's and then he made a single, sharp cry and arched beneath Draco.
Harry looked at Draco accusingly. "I blame you for that."
"Not while we're here. It is password protected when occupied."
"It is. I feel like an idiot for not having noticed sooner."
"Well, you did offer to be 'something more' at one time. Or was that you talking out of your arse?"
Except for the fact that Malfoy was a complete git.
Harry nodded. "Rosier does things on a large scale with massive casualties in order to confuse the identity of the real victim. Most of his assassinations have been written off as freak accidents. Also, Malfoy thinks he's being paid by someone opposed to the House-elf Freedom Act. Possibly a pure-blood with deep pockets."
Malfoy's eyes narrowed. "You seem very full of yourself."
Malfoy paused, visibly startled at the name, but did not turn to face Harry.
"In your dreams. I went out for lunch and came back to this," Harry retorted and gestured towards Ron's rainbow-sparkle desk. "I have no idea who could have done such a dastardly thing."
"We're nearly ready to test a spell," Hermione said. Harry noticed her gaze shift to a point beyond him and knew Draco was gliding silently down the steps. It was confirmed by the snapping rage in Ron's glare.
"I should go home."
He continued on to the dining room and repeated the process, then stopped and clucked his tongue at the large painting displayed on the wall. "Van Gogh in the dining room? Honestly, and I thought these people had taste. I see now they are simply charlatans masquerading as their more cultured brethren. Such a shame."
"It was like that? Since
"But…I've been near Carmichael."
Harry stopped midway up the walk. He turned in a slow circle, scanning the hedges, pretending to look for albino peacocks. In truth, he was not quite ready to enter the Manor. He might never be ready.
," he said and focussed the lust that felt so thick it should be pooling around his feet by now. He sent it at the tip of the wand with the final syllable and then stared when a gigantic burst of violet light exploded from the wand tip and cracked against the wall on the far side of the room.
"I don't think so. You're always giving, aren't you, Potter?"
"Draco was good enough to bring you here, as instructed. Now he only need perform one more task in order to win his prize, right Pansy?"
"Hermione, will you come to the dance with me?" Ron blurted.
"If you don't mind, I would like to come back for a signed statement once we have confirmed your story regarding—" Malfoy's words cut off when Harry's fingers dug sharply into his arm. Harry had bolted from the sofa to grab his partner, whose moment of compassion had obviously been a fluke. "Unhand me, Potter."
"Would you like some tea?" Eddie asked Zabini as his hands slipped out of Harry's grasp. His tone was polite and no longer antagonistic.
Malfoy shook his head, but before he could protest again the matter was taken out of his hands. A small crowd pushed him from the corridor and into the decorated space. Vic ushered Malfoy to his chair while Tim beamed and Levitated a tray of champagne-filled glasses onto the desk. Rocco looked almost pleased and smirked while sprawling into the only guest chair.
"Enough of this gibberish!" Crabbe lifted his wand and brought it down with a swift jab. Draco refused to shut his eyes and Pansy's widened as she braced for the Killing Curse. A loud scream caused them both to jump and then Crabbe was turning away, looking at the entrance passage with a growl. "
The next three days were torment for Harry, albeit for varied reasons.  First, of course, was the fact that sitting down was extraordinarily painful.  He thought he might have bruises on top of his bruises.  Hermione was the only one who seemed to notice, thankfully, but she apparently chalked it up to Harry’s first encounter with Malfoy, being unaware of the second.  The jar of healing salve she provided helped quite a lot, but he still received a painful reminder each time he sat down.
"Sunday," Harry replied.
Harry smiled wanly. “Thanks, Hermione. I don’t know how much longer I can live with him.”
Nottingham shot him a venomous look. "Great news? Why would that be great news?"
Malfoy shot a glare over his shoulder. "You are comparing me to
"If it had been, then better I had died than the Savior of the Wizarding World, don't you think?"
Harry shut his eyes.
"We found it!" she cried.
Harry looked at Draco. "I think now would be a good time to make our exit."
Draco splayed his gloved left hand over the small of Potter’s back, something he had not done last time.  Potter gasped at the touch, but Draco’s second spanking kept him silent.  The blow was much harder than the first, and delivered to the other arse cheek.  The gloves worked splendidly, Draco noted.
"So," Draco said conversationally, "how did it happen? I've heard rumors, of course, but the truth is generally a far cry from gossip."
"You bet it is."
Harry sprawled in the chair and noted that it was very uncomfortable and sat quite a bit lower than Malfoy's chair, forcing him to look up at the man. It was a subtle, but effective, intimidation tactic. It was rather impressive.
"You're such a Slytherin."
Harry wasn't sure what to say about that. "You look…um."
Immediately, he pulled out Malfoy's old wand and pushed aside a wizard in dusty orange robes, seeking a clear shot. Rosier's other hand was clenched around a small object and his lips were moving. Harry decided on a Stupefy, but before he could cast, Malfoy stepped between them.
"You know him, then?"
“You, too!”
Draco's arm tightened around his waist and Harry prepared to kick off, sending them into the air. He noticed a moment too late that Draco had his wand out.
"No. I have no interest in Roderick."
Draco spun to stare at him. His grey eyes were wild.
Potter smirked. "Well, the dress certainly fit better before."
"We are likely walking into a trap," Draco said and strode with his usual confidence back to the main entrance chamber. He held the door open as the others entered the circular room. "Harry, open that door over there. Yes, straight across."
"I do not expect to put my entire life on hold, Weasley, for an indefinite period of time. I have business that requires attention."
"Smuggling." Draco turned away and Harry heard him swear softly. "I knew he was too good to be true."
Harry nodded, trying to maintain a professional façade when confronted with a young woman who was, for all intents and purposes, dead. Her body still functioned, but it was an empty shell, devoid of life. Harry had seen too many similar sights lately.
Setting all former differences aside, Hermione and Malfoy leaned over the table and began to hammer through potential attacks and how to counter them. Harry sat back and watched them go to it, feeling inordinately pleased with them both.
"I took care of that." It was true. Harry had spent a solid hour working on the wards. He doubted a team of trained Aurors could break through them now. Pushing aside his doubts, he leaned down and pressed a kiss to Eddie's forehead. "Ron and Hermione said they will drop in and visit when you're feeling better."
"You went to a Muggle store?"
Harry chuckled and gave him a squeeze. "You'll get wet, then. It's bound to rain sometime."
She shrugged nonchalantly and got to her feet. "I suppose it won't kill me to spend some more time with you." She winked at Harry and bid Draco and Narcissa a polite goodnight before joining Brady in the fire and leaving.
"We'll have tea in the library, Maeve." Draco spoke with the confident grace of the lord of the manor—which he was, Harry realised. He looked at Draco with grudging respect. Draco caught the look and, groaning, reached for Harry again, but Harry danced away.
"Of course it was. You know I don't have enough magic to move a speck of dust."
as though he were a bloody lapdog. Are you even listening to me?"
"I should like to do some digging under those robes." Roderick snickered and Draco jabbed him with an elbow, hard. "Merlin, Draco,
Draco looked down at the cream-colored sheets. Truthfully, he wasn't sure why he'd done it. The maneouvre had been instinctive.
"I'll stop speaking, then." Potter returned his mouth to Draco's navel… and then blissfully lower. His deft fingers removed Draco's trousers as quickly as he had unbuttoned the shirt, making Draco wonder if he had lied about losing his wand when he transformed. "Um… what do I do now?"
"He asked for you specifically. Says you’re the only one he trusts. That sounds like a load of malarkey to me, but whatever. The Veritaserum's worn off by now. Pity, that. Now we won't know if half what he's saying is true, but Kingsley insists on doing this by the book, especially after my little fuck-up, although I only dosed him because it was Quartermain's idea. Did you know Marcus Flint is a barrister?" Ron shook his head. "Wouldn't even have thought that one could read."
Harry coughed. "Perhaps we should drop the subject of birds and talk about dementors?"
"Well, we never did this."
Harry got to his feet and stopped her with a hand. "No, I should. It's my responsibility. And I've spoken with her before." The time Harry had conversed with her on a forest floor came back to him in a rush and he glanced at the closed door once more before gathering his thoughts and heading for the public Floo connection. A house-elf took the call and Narcissa came through the moment she heard the words "Draco" and "St Mungo's". For someone caught completely unawares on a random Thursday afternoon, she looked as elegant as though she had planned to attend a formal Tea. Perhaps she had.
"Certain things."
"I'll—" Harry gasped. "I'll tell you if you allow me some air."
"Why didn't you just say that to begin with? A simple person search? You could have
"Ron! Damn it, where are you!"
Malfoy stared at him for so long Harry thought Malfoy had misheard. He opened his mouth to repeat the question, but Malfoy said, "I'm a criminal, Potter. Surely you know that."
"Did you drug the wine or the food?" Draco asked and noted that his words were slurred a bit. Her face went cloudy and swam out of focus and her voice seemed to come from a great distance.
McGonagall looked at the sludgy mess of wet, gooey gingerbread and snapped, “Who is responsible for this?”
"I know. I read the book."
"Circe, I can't believe I'm actually meeting you. You're a legend."
Malfoy moved, lifting his arm and repeating the motion with Harry's hand still lightly covering his own. His shoulder shifted against Harry's chest, a small motion that seemed much larger. Harry's hand on his hip, although barely touching, seemed too-intimate, something that Malfoy would never allow under normal circumstances. Their breathing seemed synchronized, each inhalation and exhalation taken as one. Malfoy's scent filled Harry's senses.
Harry held him tightly for a moment and then helped Draco to his feet. "Let's get you out of here. The sooner Mulciber is in Azkaban, the happier I will be. And the less likely I will be to shove my wand down his throat and cast Avada Kedavra."
"Come back tomorrow?"
Harry felt a pang at that, although it was not until much later that he recognized it as flattery. "You have issues," he said, frustrated.
"Well, it wasn't me!"
Draco snatched the bird before it could take flight again. "Stop it!" he ordered. "You need to calm down. For one thing, you're the worst flyer I've ever seen."
He quickly cast a spell to wake her up. Her green eyes blinked for a moment and finally focused.
"Um… I've never been in this room before. I'll see about your loo request. Pretty sure he'll deny you the wine, though."
"Must you do that?" Harry mumbled around Draco's lips.
"You have no idea." She nodded. "It's always 'Draco this' and 'Draco that' until I actually throw something at him. It's useful to keep a Bludger on my desk, I've noticed. I sometimes think he's a bit hung up on you."
Draco scowled. "You know you're driving me stark raving mad."
to find a cure for this, Hermione.”
"I really hate you."
Shacklebolt's expression was thunderous. "You two will face disciplinary action for this breach of procedure! Auror Weasley, I believe you are allowing your emotion to cloud your professional judgment. And Quentin, I am appalled. What were you thinking?"
“Yeah.” Harry took a drink and grimaced. He hadn’t done much of anything surprising in the past three years. “How about you?”
"Who?"
himself. He certainly did NOT want Draco sharing Harry's worst suspicions.
"Well, no, three actually," George admitted.
Saturday, 27.11.2004
"Photography class," Harry mused.
"I meant to
"And you? Were you part of this
"Welcome to the House-elf Freedom Faire, sir. Please take the path to the house where you will be greeted. Enjoy your afternoon." Draco pasted on a fake smile as Wells-Barton and the woman turned away. Draco gestured at a point past the gates, effectively dismissing Wells-Barton. "Oh, is that Oliver Wood? Catch me, Auror Klein, I might swoon! Isn't he handsome?"
Harry opened his mouth to ask what Malfoy was doing when he snapped, "Tonight, Potter.  Don't make me add to your punishment for dawdling."
Sunday, 14.3.2004
"Yes. Just a drop of Veritaserum. Quite handy when asking questions of those genetically inclined to lie."
"He'll be here, Harry," Hermione said, although her voice sounded less than certain. Harry had, of course, revealed the entire story to her and Ron in a fit of near-hysteria the day before. Ron had not, surprisingly, fainted, although he had turned a shocking shade of pale that had made his freckles stand out like dots of blood. Two hours later, Ron still hadn't been able to form a coherent sentence, but shortly before they had gone to sleep he had managed to choke out five words of reassurance. "Whatever makes you happy, mate." It had been enough for Harry.
"Draco, stop. You need not turn cannibal—
Wednesday, 10.3.2004
She nodded. "Yeah. I went down and there is no mention of him on the sign-in sheet, and Delores doesn't remember seeing him. It's like he went to the Ministry and just vanished."
The Super Auror was, unsurprisingly, at a loss for words. Potter struggled to speak until Draco silenced him with a kiss. He was pleased when Potter did not resist, but only disentangled his hands—finally—from Draco's hair, only to wrap them around his shoulders.
The walk down from the café was pleasant enough. They could have taken a Muggle cab, but Harry didn't think that Draco's willingness to rub elbows with Muggles would extend as far as riding in something with a combustion engine.
"I don't know. I didn't eat any."
The bird hopped across the green bedding and took a tentative peck at the chocolate. Draco restrained his urge to snatch the creature and instead placed his other hand, palm upraised, on the blanket.
"Vermillion Violet? Well, despite the fact that you obviously haven't used this in far too long, at least you had good taste at one time. This is top notch. Very good, Harry. I approve." Draco handed the jar back and then flopped down again. His hair fanned over the pillow attractively, as he probably knew. "You may proceed."
Friday, 27.2.2004
"Do you want to do this?" Harry demanded in an irritated hiss.
“A decorating contest?” Ron asked dubiously. “Has she gone barmy? Look at this place. If it gets any more decorated we’ll have bloody reindeer and Jack Frost roaming the halls.”
"A Warming Charm helps with that. How long since you've wanked?"
"She was being careful enough to fool most people, but I've made a habit of noticing such things."
"Look, Malfoy—" Harry's eyes were on Malfoy's wand. It was new, of course, since Malfoy's old hawthorn wand resided in Harry's old school trunk, shoved away in the attic at Number 12, Grimmauld Place. That one would never bow to Malfoy's will again; Harry would make certain of that. This new one, however, was a curiosity. The wood was very pale, almost delicate-looking, straight and unadorned but for a green leather grip wrapped in silver wire.
Hermione sighed. "Well, there are certainly a lot of those, and most pure-bloods are opposed to the Act. That hardly narrows it down, but at least it explains the motive. Don't they realise that killing me at such an event might backfire? It could elevate me to the level of martyr and sway public opinion in favour of the bill as a backlash." She seemed disturbingly okay with the notion.
"Yes. Yes,
"Chocolate frog?" he offered.
"Who to?"
"Ready," Hermione replied grimly. The three of them raised their wands and began the incantation. When it was nearly complete, Harry cast his senses outwards, recalling his actions replayed in the trance.
